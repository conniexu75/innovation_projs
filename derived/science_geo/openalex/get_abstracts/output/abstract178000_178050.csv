Because the function of a protein is closely correlated with its subcellular location, with the rapid increase in new protein sequences entering into databanks, it is vitally important for both basic research and pharmaceutical industry to establish a high throughput tool for predicting protein subcellular location. In this paper, a new concept, the so-called “functional domain composition” is introduced. Based on the novel concept, the representation for a protein can be defined as a vector in a high-dimensional space, where each of the clustered functional domains derived from the protein universe serves as a vector base. With such a novel representation for a protein, the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is introduced for predicting protein subcellular location. High success rates are obtained by the self-consistency test, jackknife test, and independent dataset test, respectively. The current approach not only can play an important complementary role to the powerful covariant discriminant algorithm based on the pseudo amino acid composition representation (Chou, K. C. (2001)Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 43, 246–255; Correction (2001) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 44, 60), but also may greatly stimulate the development of this area. Proteins are generally classified into the following 12 subcellular locations: 1) chloroplast, 2) cytoplasm, 3) cytoskeleton, 4) endoplasmic reticulum, 5) extracellular, 6) Golgi apparatus, 7) lysosome, 8) mitochondria, 9) nucleus, 10) peroxisome, 11) plasma membrane, and 12) vacuole.

The current approach not only can play an important complementary role to the powerful covariant discriminant algorithm based on the pseudo amino acid composition representation (Chou, K. C. (2001)Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 43, 246–255; Correction (2001) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 44, 60), but also may greatly stimulate the development of this area. According to the localization or compartment in a cell, proteins are generally classified into the following 12 categories: 1) chloroplast, 2) cytoplasm, 3) cytoskeleton, 4) endoplasmic reticulum, 5) extracellular, 6) Golgi apparatus, 7) lysosome, 8) mitochondria, 9) nucleus, 10) peroxisome, 11) plasma membrane, and 12) vacuole. Given the sequence of a protein, how can we predict which category or subcellular location it belongs to? This is certainly a very important problem because the subcellular location of a protein is closely correlated with its biological function. Although the information about protein subcellular location can be determined by conducting various experiments, that is both time consuming and costly. Because of the fact that the number of sequences entering into databanks has been rapidly increasing, e.g. in 1986 the total sequence entries in SWISS-PROT (1Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Nucleic Acids Research. 2000; 25: 31-36Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar) was only 3,939 while the number was increased to 80,000 in 1999, the problem has become an urgent challenge. Particularly, it is anticipated that many more new protein sequences will be derived soon because of the recent success of the human genome project, which has provided an enormous amount of genomic information in the form of 3 billion base pairs assembled into tens of thousands of genes. Therefore, the challenge will become even more urgent and critical. Actually, many efforts have been made trying to develop some computational methods for quickly predicting the subcellular locations of proteins (2–13). It is instructive to point out that, of these algorithms, most are based on the amino acid composition alone without including any sequence-order effects, and some (9Chou K.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2000; 278: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 12Chou K.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 43 (Correction (2001) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet.44, 60): 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar, 13Cai Y.D. Liu X.J. Xu X.B. Chou K.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 84: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) are based on the pseudo amino acid composition that incorporated partial sequence-order effects. To further improve the prediction quality, a logical and key step would be to find an effective way to incorporate the sequence-order effects. The present study was initiated in an attempt to explore a different approach to incorporate these kinds of effects. The core of the new approach is based on a novel concept, the so-called “functional domain composition,” as will be further described below. To improve the quality of statistical prediction for protein subcellular location, one of the most important steps is to give an effective representation for a protein. This is indeed a crucial problem but meanwhile a quite subtle one, which might lead us to face the dilemma discussed below. According to common sense, an effective representation should include as much information a protein has as possible. Compared with the amino acid composition (14Nakashima H. Nishikawa K. Ooi T. J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 152-162Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 15Chou K.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 21: 319-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 16Chou K.C. Zhang C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22014-22020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the pseudo amino acid composition (12Chou K.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 43 (Correction (2001) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet.44, 60): 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar), the entire protein sequence contains of course the most complete information. Unfortunately, if using the entire sequence of a protein as its representation to formulate the statistical prediction algorithm, one would face the difficulty of dealing with almost an infinity of sample patterns, as elaborated by Chou (12Chou K.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 43 (Correction (2001) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet.44, 60): 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). Accordingly, to formulate a feasible statistical prediction algorithm, a protein must be expressed in terms of a set of discrete numbers. The earliest approach (2Nakashima H. Nishikawa K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 3Cedano J. Aloy P. P'erez-pons J.A. Querol E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 4Reinhardt A. Hubbard T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2230-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 5Chou K.C. Elrod D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) in this regard was to use the amino acid composition that consists of 20 components representing the occurrence frequencies of the 20 native amino acids in a protein. However, if using the amino acid composition as the representation for a protein, all the sequence-order effects would be missed. Therefore we are actually confronted with the dilemma that, if wishing to include the complete information, the prediction would become unfeasible; if wishing to make the prediction feasible, some important information must be ignored. In view of this, can we find a compromise scenario, i.e. a new protein representation that is constituted by a set of discrete numbers but that also contains as much of the sequence-order effects as possible? The introduction of the pseudo amino acid composition is a pioneer effort in this regard that has no doubt made one important step forward for such a goal. The pseudo amino acid composition consists of 20 + λ discrete numbers, where the first 20 numbers are the same as those in the amino acid composition and the remaining numbers representλ different ranks of sequence-correlation factors (12Chou K.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 43 (Correction (2001) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet.44, 60): 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). In this paper, we would like to introduce a completely different set of discrete numbers; i.e. instead of using each of the 20 amino acid components or each of the 20 + λ pseudo amino acid components as a vector base to define a protein, we shall use each of the native functional domains as a vector base to define a protein. By searching and clustering 139,765 annotated protein sequences, Murvaiet al. (17Murvai J. Vlahovicek K. Barta E. Pongor S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have constructed a data base called SBASE-A that contains 2005 sequences with well known structural and functional domain types. With each of the 2005 functional domains as a vector-base, a protein can be defined as a 2005-dimensional (D) 1The abbreviations used for: D, dimensional; HSP(s), high-scoring segment pair(s); SVM(s), support vector machine(s). vector according to the following procedures. 1) Use BLASTP to compare a protein with each of the 2005 domain sequences in SBASE-A to find the high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs) and the smallest sum probability (P). A detailed description about this operation can be found in Altschul (18Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). 2) If the HSP score ≫ 75 and P < 0.8 in comparing the protein sequence with the ith domain sequence, then the ith component of the protein in the 2005-D space is assigned 1; otherwise, 0. 3) The protein can thus be explicitly formulated as follows. X=x1x2⋮xi⋮x2005,Equation 1 where xi=1,when HSP score>>75andP<0.80,otherwiseEquation 2 Defined in this way, a protein corresponds to a 2005-D vectorX with each of the 2005 functional domain sequences as a base for the vector space; i.e. rather than the 20-D space (15Chou K.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 21: 319-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) of the amino acid composition approach or the (20 + λ)-D space of the pseudo amino acid composition approach (12Chou K.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 43 (Correction (2001) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet.44, 60): 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar), a protein is represented in terms of the functional domain-composition. By using such a representation, not only some sequence-order effects but also some functional information is included. In other words, the representation thus obtained for a protein would bear some sequence-order mark as well as the structural and functional type mark. Because the function of a protein is closely related to its subcellular location, the prediction algorithm established based on the new representation would naturally incorporate those factors that might be directly correlated with the protein subcellular location. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are kinds of learning machines based on statistical learning theory. The most remarkable characteristics of SVMs are the absence of local minima, the sparseness of the solution, and the use of the kernel-induced feature spaces. The basic idea of applying SVMs to pattern classification can be outlined as follows. First, map the input vectors into a feature space (possible with a higher dimension) either linearly or non-linearly, which is relevant to the selection of the kernel function. Then, within the feature space, seek an optimized linear division; i.e.construct a hyper-plane that can separate two classes (this can be extended to multi-classes) with the least error and maximal margin. The SVMs training process always seeks a global optimized solution and avoids over-fitting, so it has the ability to deal with a large number of features. A complete description to the theory of SVMs for pattern recognition is given in the book by Vapnik (19Vapnik V. Statistical Learning Theory. Wiley-Interscience, New York1998Google Scholar). SVMs have been used to deal with protein fold recognition (20Ding C.H. Dubchak I. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), protein-protein interaction prediction (21Bock J.R. Gough D.A. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), and protein secondary structure prediction (22Hua S.J. Sun Z.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In this paper, the Vapnik's Support Vector Machine (23Vapnik V.N. The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1995Crossref Google Scholar) was introduced to predict protein subcellular location. Specifically, SVMlight, which is an implementation (in C Language) of SVM for the problems of pattern recognition, was used for computations. The optimization algorithm used in SVMlight can be found in Joachims (24Joachims T. Schölkopf B. Burges C.J.C. Smola A.J. Advances in Kernel Methods-Support Vector Learning. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1999: 169-184Google Scholar). The relevant mathematical principles can be briefly formulated as follows. Given a set of n samples, i.e. a series of input vectors Xkεℜτ(k=1,…,N),Equation 3 where X k can be regarded as thekth protein or vector defined in the 2005-D space according to the functional domain composition (see Eq. 1), andℜτ is a Euclidean space with τdimensions. Because the multiclass identification problem can always be converted into a two-class identification problem, without loss of the generality, the formulation below is given for the two-class case only. Suppose the output derived from the learning machine is expressed byyk ε{+1,−1} (k = 1, … , N) where the indexes –1 and +1 are used to stand for the two classes concerned, respectively. The goal here is to construct one binary classifier or derive one decision function from the available samples that has a small probability of misclassifying a future sample. Here both the basic linear separable case and the most useful linear non-separable case for most real life problems are taken into consideration. In this case, there exists a separating hyper-plane whose function is W · X + b = 0, whose implication is shown in the following equation. yk(W·Xk+b)≥1,(k=1,…,N)Equation 4 By minimizing ∥W∥2 subject to the above constraint, the SVM approach will find a unique separating hyper-plane. Here ∥W∥2 is the Euclidean norm of W, which maximizes the distance between the hyper-plane or the optimal separating hyper-plane (25Cortes C. Vapnik V. Machine Learning. 1995; 20: 273-293Crossref Scopus (10819) Google Scholar) and the nearest data points of each class. The classifier thus obtained is called the maximal margin classifier. By introducing Lagrange multipliers αi, and using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions (26Karush W. Department of Mathematics. University of Chicago, Chicago1939Google Scholar, 27Cristianini N. Shawe-Taylor J. Support Vector Machines. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2000Crossref Google Scholar) as well as the Wolfe dual theorem of optimization theory (28Wolfe P. Q. Appl. Math. 1961; 19: 239-244Crossref Google Scholar), the SVM training procedure amounts to solving the following convex quadratic programming problem Max:∑i=1Nαi−12∑i=1N∑j=1NαiαjyiyjXi·XjEquation 5 subject to the following two conditions. αi≥0,(i=1,2,…,N)Equation 6 ∑i=1Nαiyi=0Equation 7 The solution is a unique globally optimized result, which can be expressed with the following expansion. W=∑i=1NyiαiXiEquation 8 Only if the corresponding αi > 0, are theseX i called the Support Vectors. Now supposeX is a query protein defined in the same 2005-D space based on the functional domain composition (see Eq. 1). After the SVM has been trained, the decision function for identifying which class the query protein belongs to can be formulated as f(X)=sgn∑i=1NyiαiX·Xi+bEquation 9 where sgn() in the above equation is a sign function, which equals to +1 or −1 when its argument is ≥0 or <0, respectively. For this case two important techniques are needed that are given below. To allow for training errors, Cortes and Vapnik (25Cortes C. Vapnik V. Machine Learning. 1995; 20: 273-293Crossref Scopus (10819) Google Scholar) introduced the slack variables shown below. ζi>0(i=1,…,N),Equation 10 The relaxed separation constraint is given below. yi(W·Xi+b)≥1−ζi,(i=1,…,N)Equation 11 The optimal separating hyper-plane can be found by minimizing 12∥W∥2+c∑i=1NζiEquation 12 where c is a regularization parameter used to decide a trade-off between the training error and the margin. The SVM performs a nonlinear mapping of the input vectors from the Euclidean space 194d into a higher dimensional Hilbert spaceH, where the mapping is determined by the kernel function. Then like in the linear separable case, it finds the optimal separating hyper-plane in the Hilbert space H that would correspond to a non-linear boundary in the original Euclidean space. Two typical kernel functions are listed below K(Xi,Xj)=(Xi⋅Xj+1)τEquation 13 K(Xi,Xj)=exp−r∥Xi−Xj∥2Equation 14 where the first one is called the polynomial kernel function of degree τ, which will eventually revert to the linear function when τ = 1, the second one is called the radial basic function kernel. Finally, for the selected kernel function, the learning task amounts to solving the following quadratic programming problem Max:∑i=1Nαi−12∑i=1N∑i=1NαiαjyiyjK(Xi·Xj)Equation 15 which is subject to the following equations. 0≤ai≤c,(i=1,2,…,N)Equation 16 ∑i=1Nαiyi=0Equation 17 Accordingly, the form of the decision function is given by the equation shown below. f(X)=sgn∑i=1NyiαiK(X,Xi)+bEquation 18 For a given dataset, only the kernel function and the regularity parameter c must be selected to specify the SVM. To facilitate comparison, the same dataset constructed by Chou and Elrod (6Chou K.C. Elrod D.W. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) was used to demonstrate the current method. However, as mentioned in Chou (12Chou K.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 43 (Correction (2001) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet.44, 60): 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar), because the change of code names, some protein sequences could no longer be retrieved from the SWISS-PROT data bank (1Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Nucleic Acids Research. 2000; 25: 31-36Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Of the 2319 proteins originally listed in Appendix A of Chou and Elrod (6Chou K.C. Elrod D.W. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), 2191 protein sequences were retrieved. These sequences consist of 145 chloroplast proteins, 571 cytoplasm, 34 cytoskeleton, 49 endoplasmic reticulum, 224 extracellular, 25 Golgi apparatus, 37 lysosome, 84 mitochondria, 272 nucleus proteins, 27 peroxisome, 699 plasma membrane, and 24 vacuole. During the operation, the width of the Gaussian radial basic functions was selected for minimizing the estimation of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension (19Vapnik V. Statistical Learning Theory. Wiley-Interscience, New York1998Google Scholar). The parameter cthat controlled the error-margin trade-off was set at 1000. After being trained, the hyper-plane output by the SVM was obtained. This indicates that the trained model, i.e. hyper-plane output that includes the important information, has the function to identify the protein subcellular locations. The demonstration was conducted by the three most typical approaches in statistical prediction (29Chou K.C. Zhang C.T. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 275-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar), i.e. the resubstitution test, jackknife test, and independent dataset test as reported below. The so-called resubstitution test is an examination for the self-consistency of an identification method. When the resubstitution test is performed for the current study, the subcellular location of each protein in the dataset is in turn identified using the rule parameters derived from the same dataset, the so-called training dataset. The success rate thus obtained for predicting the 12 subcellular locations of the 2191 proteins is summarized in Table I, from which we can see that 1913 proteins were correctly predicted for their subcellular locations and that only 278 proteins were incorrectly predicted. The overall success rate is 87.3%, indicating that after being trained, the SVMs model has grasped the complicated relationship between the functional domain composition and the subcellular location of proteins. However, during the process of the resubstitution test, the rule parameters derived from the training dataset include the information of the query protein later plugged back in the test. This will certainly underestimate the error and enhance the success rate because the same proteins are used to derive the rule parameters and to test themselves. Accordingly, the success rate thus obtained represents an optimistic estimation (6Chou K.C. Elrod D.W. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 15Chou K.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 21: 319-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 30Cai Y.D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 43: 336-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Zhou G.P. Assa-Munt N. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 44: 57-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the resubstitution test is absolutely necessary because it reflects the self-consistency of an identification method, especially for its algorithm part. An identification algorithm certainly cannot be deemed as a good one if its self-consistency is poor. In other words, the resubstitution test is necessary but not sufficient for evaluating an identification method. As a complement, a cross-validation test for an independent testing dataset is needed because it can reflect the effectiveness of an identification method in practical application. This is important especially for checking the validity of a training data base: whether it contains sufficient information to reflect all the important features concerned so as to yield a high success rate in application.Table IOverall rates of correct prediction for the 12 subcellular locations of proteins by different algorithms and test methodsAlgorithmInput formTest methodResubstitutionaConducted for the 2191 proteins classified into 12 subcellular locations in the training dataset as described under “Results and Discussion.”JackknifeaConducted for the 2191 proteins classified into 12 subcellular locations in the training dataset as described under “Results and Discussion.”Independent datasetbConducted based on the rule parameters derived from the 2191 proteins in the training dataset for the 2494 proteins in the independent dataset (see “Results and Discussion”).Least Hamming distance (33Chou P.Y.

Open table in a new tab As is well known, the independent dataset test, subsampling test and jackknife test are the three methods often used for cross-validation in statistical prediction. Among these three, however, the jackknife test is deemed as the most effective and objective one; see, e.g. a relevant review (29Chou K.C. Zhang C.T. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 275-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar) for a comprehensive discussion about this and a monograph (32Mardia K.V. Kent J.T. Bibby J.M. Multivariate Analysis. Academic Press, London1979: 322Google Scholar) for the mathematical principle. During jackknifing, each protein in the dataset is in turn singled out as a tested protein and all the rule parameters are calculated based on the remaining proteins. In other words, the subcellular location of each protein is identified by the rule parameters derived using all the other proteins except the one which is being identified. During the process of jackknifing both the training dataset and testing dataset are actually open, and a protein will in turn move from one to the other. The results of jackknife test thus obtained for the 2191 proteins are given in Table I as well. Moreover, as a demonstration of practical application, predictions were also conducted for an independent dataset based on the rule parameters derived from the 2191 proteins in the training dataset. The independent dataset was also adopted from Ref. 6Chou K.C. Elrod D.W. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar. However, for the same reason as mentioned in Ref.12Chou K.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 43 (Correction (2001) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet.44, 60): 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar, of the 2591 independent proteins originally studied by Ref. 6Chou K.C. Elrod D.W. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, only 2494 protein sequences were retrieved. They are: 112 chloroplast proteins, 761 cytoplasm, 19 cytoskeleton, 106 endoplasmic reticulum, 95 extracellular, 4 Golgi apparatus, 31 lysosome, 163 mitochondria, 418 nucleus proteins, 23 peroxisome, and 762 plasma membrane. None of these proteins occurs in the training dataset. The predicted results thus obtained for the 2494 proteins in the independent dataset are also summarized in Table I, from which we can see that 2037 proteins were correctly predicted for their subcellular locations, and only 478 proteins were incorrectly predicted. The overall success rate is 81.7%. Furthermore, to facilitate comparison, listed in Table I are also the results predicted by various other methods on the same datasets. From Table I the following can be observed. 1) The success prediction rates by both the functional domain composition approach and the pseudo amino acid composition approach are significantly higher than those by the simple geometry approaches (14Nakashima H. Nishikawa K. Ooi T. J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 152-162Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 33Chou P.Y. Abstracts of Papers Part I.Second Chemical Congress of the North American Continent, Las Vegas, May 1, 1980. Plenum Press, New York1980Google Scholar) and the ProtLock algorithm (3Cedano J. Aloy P. P'erez-pons J.A. Querol E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). This is fully consistent with what is expected because both of these two approaches bear the marks of some sequence-order effects although by means of different avenues. 2) A comparison between the functional domain composition approach and the pseudo amino acid composition approach indicates that the success rates by the former are higher than the latter in both the self-consistency test and independent dataset test, indicating the current functional domain composition approach is quite promising with a considerable potential for further development. However, its success rate by the jackknife test is lower than that of the pseudo amino acid approach (12Chou K.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 43 (Correction (2001) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet.44, 60): 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar) by using the augmented covariant discriminant algorithm (9Chou K.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2000; 278: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and even 1.4% lower than that of the conventional amino acid approach by using the covariant discriminant algorithm (6Chou K.C. Elrod D.W. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The setback might be due to the reason that the functional domain data base used in the current study is far from a complete one yet. Also, some subsets in the training dataset are too small (e.g. with less than 50 sequences) to have a high cluster-tolerant capacity (34Chou K.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1999; 264: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) for the 2005-D functional domain composition space. It is anticipated that with the continuous improvement of the functional domain data base as well as the training data of small subsets by adding into them more new proteins that have been found belonging to the subcellular locations defined by these subsets the setback would be naturally overcome. As a demonstration, the testing dataset was incorporated into the original training dataset to form an augmented training dataset of 2191 + 2494 = 4685 proteins, and then the jackknife test was reapplied. It was observed that the success rate thus obtained by the current functional domain composition approach was increased from 66.7 to 87.9%, but the corresponding rate by the augmented covariant discriminant algorithm was increased from 73.0 to 79.5%, convincingly indicating the strong potential of the current approach. The goal of this study is not to determine the possible upper limit of the success rate for the prediction of protein subcellular location, but to propose a novel and different approach to incorporate the sequence-order effect as well as the factors of structural and functional types that might help to open a new avenue to further increase our ability or options to deal with this very complicated and difficult problem. It should be realized that it is too premature to construct a complete or quasi-complete training dataset based on the knowledge available so far. Without a complete or quasi-complete training dataset, any attempt to determine such an upper limit would be unjustified, and the result thus obtained might be misleading no matter how powerful the prediction algorithm is. It should be pointed out that some proteins are known to be shuttled from one subcellular compartment to another and back again. For example, if a query protein is shuttled between nucleus and cytoplasm, then only half-correction should be counted even its subcellular location was predicted to be one of the two locations. However, cases like that would not happen in the current study. This is because the same dataset constructed by Chou and Elrod (6Chou K.C. Elrod D.W. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) was used to demonstrate the current method. Compared with the other datasets in this area that only cover two-five subcellular locations, the dataset used here has covered many more subcellular locations. Even though, as clearly described by the authors of Ref. 6Chou K.C. Elrod D.W. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, “Sequences annotated by two or more locations are not included because of a lack of uniqueness. For example, a protein sequence labeled with “Golgi and nuclear” or “chloroplast or mitochondria” was omitted.” Those proteins that are known to be shuttled between subcellular compartments must be annotated by two or more locations in SWISS-PROT. According to the screen procedure, they were already excluded from the dataset. The above results, together with those obtained by the covariant discriminant prediction algorithm (6Chou K.C. Elrod D.W. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and those further improved by introducing some sequence-order effects (9Chou K.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2000; 278: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 12Chou K.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 43 (Correction (2001) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet.44, 60): 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar), have indicated that the subcellular locations of proteins are predictable with a considerable accuracy. The development in statistical prediction of protein attributes generally consists of two cores: one is to construct a training dataset and the other is to formulate a prediction algorithm. The latter can be further separated into two subcores: one is how to give a mathematical expression to effectively represent a protein and the other is how to find an operational equation to accurately perform the prediction.

Chem. 1998; 17: 729-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and to the current SVM algorithm reflects the development of computation by means of different mathematical operations. One of the remarkable advantages for the pseudo amino acid composition representation is to use a set of simple and intuitive sequence-order-coupling modes to directly incorporate the sequence-order effects, while a remarkable advantage of the functional domain composition representation is to use the functional domain data base to incorporate the information of not only some sequence-order effects but also the structural and functional types. Each of the two representations has its own advantage. For some cases, the functional domain composition representation yields better results than the pseudo amino acid composition representation; but for some other cases, the outcome may be just the reverse. This is just exactly the same in comparison of the covariant discriminant algorithm with the SVM algorithm. Therefore, when we are still in the situation of lacking a complete training dataset and functional domain data base, it would be wise to complement the covariant discriminant algorithm based on the pseudo amino acid composition representation with the SVM algorithm based on the functional domain composition representation for conducting practical predictions. Finally, the functional domain composition approach might have more room and potential for further development because it incorporates both the sequence-order information and the functional type information."

By means of soybean lectin affinity chromatography, a mixture of glycoproteins was obtained from a glycine extract, and two-dimensional gel proteomics analysis led to the identification of at least 22 glycoproteins, predominantly annotated as periplasmic proteins.

Graninger M. Messner P. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 248-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 2Moens S. Vanderleyden J. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 168: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Glycosidic linkages of both the N- and O-types have been identified in a diverse group of prokaryotic organisms with a preponderance ofN-linked sugars apparent in the Archaea, whereas linkage units of the O-type predominate in glycoproteins identified thus far in the Eubacteria (1Schäffer C. Graninger M. Messner P. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 248-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 2Moens S. Vanderleyden J. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 168: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, bacterial N- and O-linkages are formed with a wider range of sugars than those observed in eukaryotic glycoproteins. Recently a gene locus was identified in the enteric pathogenCampylobacter jejuni, which appears to be involved in the glycosylation of multiple proteins and which provided the first evidence of a pathway for widespread protein glycosylation in a Gram-negative bacterium (3Szymanski C.M. Yao R. Ewing C.P. Trust T.J. Guerry P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1022-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of genes within this locus, termed pgl (for protein glycosylation), resulted in loss of immunogenicity in multiple proteins. The glycan moieties of these proteins were also shown to be recognized by antisera from experimentally infected human volunteers (3Szymanski C.M. Yao R. Ewing C.P. Trust T.J. Guerry P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1022-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Removal of the glycan moieties by pgl mutation resulted in decreased adherence and invasion in vitro and loss of mouse colonization in vivo (4Szymanski C.M. Burr D.H. Guerry P. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2242-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), suggesting that protein glycosylation influences the virulence properties of this organism. A similar genetic locus has recently been described for pilin O-glycosylation inNeisseria meningitidis (5Jennings M.P. Virji M. Evans D. Foster V. Srikhanta Y.N. Steeghs L. van der L.P. Moxon E.R.

This glycosylation pathway appears to be distinct from that involved in the glycosylation of flagellin observed for several bacterial species (7Brimer C.D. Montie T.C. J.

(11Thibault P. Logan S.M. Kelly J.F. Brisson J.R. Ewing C.P. Trust T.J. Guerry P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34862-34870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that the glycosyl moiety on the flagellin of C. jejuni consists of variants of an unusual nine-carbon sugar, pseudaminic acid,O-linked to Ser or Thr. This sugar may be considered a highly modified sialic acid (12Angata T. Varki A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 439-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). We have been identifying and characterizing post-translational modifications of proteins in C. jejuni strain NCTC 11168, the strain for which the whole genome sequence has been described by Parkhill et al. (13Parkhill J. Wren B.W. Mungall K. Ketley J.M. Churcher C. Basham D. Chillingworth T. Davies R.M. Feltwell T. Holroyd S. Jagels K. Karlyshev A.V. Moule S. Pallen M.J. Penn C.W.

Among the proteins giving rise to multiple spots on two-dimensional gels was PEB3, or Cj0289c, a major antigenic protein of C. jejuni first described by Peiet al. (14Pei Z.H. Ellison III, R.T. Blaser M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16363-16369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When purified and analyzed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, it revealed two bands with a mass difference of ∼1500 Da, both of which had N-terminal sequences corresponding to authentic PEB3. Concurrent with our observations on PEB3, Linton et al. (15Linton D. Allan E. Karlyshev A.V. Cronshaw A.D. Wren B.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) identified two putative glycoproteins from C. jejuni by use of the GalNAc-specific lectin, soybean agglutinin, one of which was PEB3, and the other a putative periplasmic protein Cj1670c, which they named CgpA. The authors also observed a number of other putative glycoproteins, based upon their ability to bind to the lectin, but these were not identified. Furthermore, protein binding to the lectin was also affected by mutagenesis of genes in the pgllocus. We have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the C. jejuni NCTC 11168 glycoprotein complement, and in this report we present data on the identification of individual glycoproteins and structural characterization of the N-linked glycan moiety, which is common to all these glycoproteins, by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. In addition, mutation of a gene, pglB, whose homology to the STT3 subunit of the N-linked oligosaccharyltransferase of Saccharomyces cerevisiaesuggested a role in glycoprotein biosynthesis (3Szymanski C.M. Yao R. Ewing C.P. Trust T.J. Guerry P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1022-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 16Wacker M. Nita-Lazar M. Aebi M. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2001; 291 Suppl. 31: 81Google Scholar), was shown to specifically affect the glycosylation of the identified glycoproteins. C. jejuni NCTC 11168 was routinely grown on Mueller Hinton agar under microaerophilic conditions (10% CO2, 5% O2, 85% N2) at 37 °C. Escherichia coli DH10B (Invitrogen) was used as the host strain for cloning experiments, and clones were grown on S-GalTM/LB agar (Sigma) or MH agar at 37 °C. When appropriate, antibiotics were added to the following final concentrations: kanamycin (30 μg/ml) and ampicillin (150 μg/ml). Plasmid pPCR-Script Amp (Stratagene) was used as the cloning vector. Cells from two plates of overnight growth were re-suspended in 10 ml of Mueller Hinton broth and used to inoculate 1 liter of MH culture medium. Cultures were grown under microaerophilic conditions at 37 °C for 24 h with shaking at 150 rpm. Bacterial cells from 12 liters of culture media were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min and immediately frozen at −75 °C. Frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice in 0.2 m glycine HCl buffer, pH 2.2 (17Logan S.M. Trust T.J. Infect. Immun. 1983; 42: 675-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and extracted for 15 min with gentle stirring. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, dialyzed against pure water (Milli-Q system, Millipore Corp.), and freeze-dried. The PEB3 protein was purified to homogeneity by cation exchange chromatography of the glycine extract as previously described (14Pei Z.H. Ellison III, R.T. Blaser M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16363-16369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Mono S HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) was used on an ÅKTA Explorer LC system (Amersham Biosciences). The column eluate was monitored for UV absorbance at 280 nm, and fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE analysis (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207139) Google Scholar) in Mini Protean II slab gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories). N-terminal sequencing of individual proteins was performed on a model 491 Procise protein sequencing system (Applied Biosystems Inc.), following transfer from SDS gels to ProBlotTMPVDF1 membrane (Applied Biosystems Inc.) as described by LeGendre et al. (19LeGendre N. Matsudaira P. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 154-159PubMed Google Scholar). The protein molecular weight profiles of selected fractions were determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using an Applied Biosystems/Sciex Q-Star hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The fractions were first dialyzed extensively to remove salts and adjusted to 30% methanol, 0.2% formic acid. The solution was infused at a flow rate of 1 μl/min, and spectra were acquired over the range m/z 600–2000. Selected fractions were digested overnight at 37 °C with modified trypsin (Promega) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and analyzed by capillary LC-tandem mass spectrometry using a capillary high-performance liquid chromatography system (CapLC, Waters) coupled with a Q-TOF2 hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass). Approximately 250 ng of each digest was injected onto a 0.3- × 150-mm PepMap C18 capillary LC column (Dionex/LC-Packings) and resolved by gradient elution (5–90% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid in 45 min). The mass spectrometer was set to operate in automatic MS/MS acquisition mode, and spectra were acquired on doubly, triply, and quadruply charged ions. Larger scale separation of the tryptic digest was carried out on a 4.6- × 250-mm Jupiter C18 LC column (Phenomenex Inc.). The fraction containing the glycopeptide was then infused at a flow rate of 1 μl/min into the microelectrospray interface of the Q-TOF2 mass spectrometer. Fragmentation of the glycopeptide prior to MS/MS analysis was achieved by front-end collision-induced dissociation (the orifice voltage was increased to 100 V from the normal 40 V). The MS/MS collision offset for the singly charged fragment ions produced in this manner was 20–25 V (laboratory frame of reference). For β-elimination experiments by the method of Rademaker et al. (20Rademaker G.J. Pergantis S.A. Blok-Tip L. Langridge J.I. Kleen A. Thomas-Oates J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 257: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), approximately half of the glycopeptide-containing fraction was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in 25% aqueous ammonium hydroxide. The solution was left at room temperature overnight, evaporated to dryness for a second time, and re-dissolved in water. The solution was then examined by infusion MS as described above. The glycoproteins from the glycine extracts were isolated by affinity chromatography on SBA lectin-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd.). The freeze-dried glycine extract was re-dissolved in PBS (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5) and passed through an SBA-agarose column previously equilibrated in PBS. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of PBS, and bound glycoprotein was eluted with 0.1 m GalNAc in PBS. Glycoprotein-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against Milli-Q water, and freeze-dried. The glycoproteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% homogeneous polyacrylamide gels (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207139) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional PAGE was performed using pre-cast IEF strips containing immobilized linear pH gradients of either pH 3–10, pH 4–7 (Bio-Rad Laboratories), or pH 6–11 (AmershamBiosciences). Proteins were solubilized in sample buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions and resolved by isoelectric focusing on the precast IEF strips followed by SDS-PAGE on homogenous 12.5% slab gels, 20 × 20 cm, for the second dimension. Gels were stained with Bio-Safe colloidal G-250 Coomassie Blue stain (Bio-Rad Laboratories) or silver-stained (20Rademaker G.J. Pergantis S.A. Blok-Tip L. Langridge J.I. Kleen A. Thomas-Oates J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 257: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For subsequent lectin probing, the gels were electroblotted onto PVDF membrane at 50 V for 1 h in 10 mm 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid buffer, pH 11, containing 10% methanol. The membrane was washed in Milli-Q water and blocked in Tris-buffered saline (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) with 0.05% Tween 20 and 2% blocking buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h at room temperature. Following blockage, blots were further incubated with SBA-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (EY Laboratories Inc.) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in the above blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed three times in Tris-saline with 0.05% Tween 20 and developed using nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in 0.1 mNaCl, 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.5, with 50 mmMgCl2. The protein spots were excised and destained with a 1:1 ratio of 30 mmpotassium ferricyanide and 100 mm sodium thiosulfate (21Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The gel spots were washed extensively with deionized water, shrunk with acetonitrile, and re-swollen with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing Promega modified trypsin (10 ng/μl), and sufficient 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added to cover the gel pieces (typically 30 μl). The tubes were sealed and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The digest solutions were removed, and the gel pieces were extracted with 50 μl of 5% acetic acid and then with 50 μl of 5% acetic acid in 50% aqueous methanol. The extracts were pooled with the digest solutions and concentrated to ∼10 μl. The peptide extracts from the intense protein spots were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS using a [email protected] mass spectrometer (Micromass). Approximately 0.5 μl of the MALDI matrix solution (10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid) was deposited on the target plate and allowed to dry. The peptide extracts were desalted using C18 ZipTipsTM (Millipore) and were deposited directly on the matrix spots. Acquisition of the MALDI-TOF MS spectra was carried out automatically. The spectra were calibrated externally using peptide standards and internally with trypsin autolysis peptides. Data base searching was carried out in batch mode using Mascot DaemonTM (Matrix Science) and against the C. jejuni NCTCSP11168 genome sequence data base. The extracts from the fainter protein spots were analyzed by NanoLC-MS/MS using the Q-TOF2 mass spectrometer. The entire samples were injected onto a 0.3- × 5-mm C18 micro pre-column cartridge (Dionex/LC-Packings). The peptides were retained while the solvent components were washed to waste. The trap was then brought online with a 75-μm × 150-mm C18Nano-Series column (Dionex/LC-Packings), and the peptides were separated with a gradient supplied by the CapLC pump (15–75% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid in 30 min, ∼300 nl/min flow rate). The mass spectrometer was set to acquire MS/MS spectra in automated mode as described above. Data base searching was carried out as described for the MALDI-TOF MS analyses. Freeze-dried total glycoprotein (5 mg) was dissolved in 250 μl of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm CaCl2, and digested with Pronase as previously described (22Young N.M. Jackson G.E. Brisson J.R. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 1083-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The digest was microcentrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was applied to a column (1 × 120 cm) of BioGel P4, 200 mesh (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The column was run in water, and the column eluate was monitored by refractive index. Fractions were screened by ESI-MS and precursor ion scanning mass spectrometry (precursors of the HexNAc oxonium ion at m/z 204) on an API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/Sciex). Fractions giving the HexNAc ion signature were pooled and freeze-dried. The glycopeptides were further purified on a 1- × 120-cm column of BioGel P2 fine grade, the fractions being monitored and screened as described above. All spectra were acquired using a Varian Inova 600-MHz spectrometer using the standard Varian software. A gradient 4-mm indirect detection high resolution magic angle spinning nano-NMR probe (Varian) with a broadband decoupling coil was used. The sample was spun at 3 kHz with dry nitrogen as the drive and bearing gas. The spin rate was not computer-controlled but remained constant to within 10 Hz of the set value. Samples in 40 μl of D2O solution were recorded at 25 °C and at 35 °C to produce sharper peaks. The pH was unknown due to the small volume. Deuterated EDTA (CDN Isotopes Inc.) was added to chelate metal ions and provide sharper peaks for bacillosamine and amino acids. Although the glycopeptide isolate from a P4 column contained some amino acid and sugar impurities, spectra were of sufficient quality to allow complete resonance assignments of the glycopeptide in the presence of 15 mm of deuterated EDTA. Much of the NMR structural work proceeded with this sample, because of the risk of loosing the bulk of the isolated glycopeptide by further purification. The derived structure was confirmed by additional NMR experiments on glycopeptide that had been purified using a P2 column, lyophilized, and dissolved in 40 μl of D2O with 1 mm deuterated EDTA. The experiments were performed with suppression of the HOD signal at 4.78 ppm (25 °C) and 4.67 ppm (35 °C). Acquisition and processing of two-dimensional experiments (COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, HMQC, HMBC) were performed as described previously (23Uhrı́n D. Brisson J.R. Barbotin J.N. Portais J.C. NMR in Microbiology: Theory and Applications. Horizon Scientific Press, Wymondham, UK2000: 165-210Google Scholar). The 1H reference was set by external acetone at 2.23 ppm. The 13C reference was set with the methyl resonance of external acetone at 31.07 ppm. The1H and 13C chemical shifts in TableI (see below) were measured from the proton spectra and from C-H cross-peaks in the HMQC and HMBC spectra. One-dimensional TOCSY experiments with various spin-lock times from 30 to 151 ms and one-dimensional NOESY with mixing times from 400 to 800 ms were performed as described previously (23Uhrı́n D. Brisson J.R. Barbotin J.N. Portais J.C. NMR in Microbiology: Theory and Applications. Horizon Scientific Press, Wymondham, UK2000: 165-210Google Scholar, 24Uhrı́n D. Barlow P.N. J. Magn.

Open table in a new tab The use of magic angle spinning (MAS) for liquid state samples in the presence of both radio frequency and magnetic-field homogeneities has been shown to influence significantly the performance of mixing sequences in TOCSY experiments and can degrade performance (25Kupce E.

The standard two-dimensional TOCSY and one-dimensional TOCSY sequences were modified so that the MLEV-17 or DIPSI-2 mixing sequence was replaced with the adiabatic WURST-2 pulses. The adiabatic (WURST-2) mixing had a single adiabatic inversion pulse length of T p = 1/MAS spin rate, a modulation depth of 8, and an adiabicity of 2. Typically, for the WURST-2 pulse, the sweep bandwidth was 24 kHz, T p = 0.333 ms (at a MAS spin rate of 3000 ± 10 Hz), B1 (max) = 8.51 kHz, and B1 (root mean square) = 4.77 kHz. The enantiomeric configurations of the Glc and GalNAc components of the P2 product were assigned by characterization of the but-2-yl glycosides in gas liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (28Vinogradov E.V. Holst O. Thomas-Oates J.E. Broady K.W. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The derivatives were analyzed using a Hewlett-Packard chromatograph equipped with a 30-m DB-17 capillary column (180–260 °C at 3.5 °C/min), and spectra in the electron impact mode were obtained with a Varian Saturn II mass spectrometer. For construction of the pglB mutant, genes Cj1121c to Cj1126c were PCR-amplified from C. jejuni NCTC 11168 using the primers: Cj1121cF (5′-ACTCACTATTGCCATTAAGATAAGC-3′) and Cj1126cR (5′-AAAACCCTTATTTAGTTTTGTTTGC-3′). The PCR product was polished with Pfu polymerase and then ligated into pPCR-Script Amp (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ligation mixture was electroporated into electrocompetent E. coli DH10B and selected for on LB S-gal agar (Sigma-Aldrich) with ampicillin. A blunt-ended kanamycin resistance cassette from pILL600 (29Labigne-Roussel A. Courcoux P. Tompkins L. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1704-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) was inserted into the filled-inXbaI restriction site of pglB, generating pEAp26. The orientation of the cassette was confirmed to be non-polar by sequencing with the ckanB primer (5′-CCTGGGTTTCAAGCATTAG-3′). DNA was sequenced using terminator chemistry and AmpliTaq cycle sequencing kits (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencer. The mutated plasmid DNA was used for electroporation intoC. jejuni NCTC 11168 (30Guerry P. Yao R. Alm R.A. Burr D.H. Trust T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the kanamycin-resistant transformants were characterized by PCR to confirm that the incoming plasmid DNA had integrated by a double cross-over event. Proteins were extracted from C. jejuni whole cells using 0.2m glycine at pH 2.2 (17Logan S.M. Trust T.J. Infect. Immun. 1983; 42: 675-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and dialyzed against water. Samples were analyzed by two-dimensional PAGE using 11-cm pH 3–10 ReadyStrips (Bio-Rad Laboratories) as above and pre-cast 12- × 8-cm 8–16% gradient Criterion slab gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue, photographed, and then partially destained by washing in water. Proteins were transferred for 1 h at 207 mA onto PVDF membranes using a Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). After blocking overnight, membranes were probed with a 1:500 dilution of HS:2 serotyping serum followed by a 1:5000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit antiserum (Sigma-Aldrich) and developed with nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PEB3 protein (Cj0289c) was identified in two-dimensional gels of a glycine extract by peptide mass fingerprinting, as a component of a group of spots focusing within a range of pH 9–10 (results not shown). PEB3 was purified from the extract by cation exchange chromatography, and re-fractionated on the same column, using a shallower NaCl gradient, resulting in the PEB3 appearing in three fractions (Fig.1). SDS-PAGE analysis showed two bands, whose N-terminal sequences were determined following their transfer to a PVDF membrane. Ten cycles of sequencing identified the lower mass species as PEB3, whereas the higher mass, more abundant component, was also PEB3 with a minor sequence corresponding to PEB4 (Cj0596). The mass spectrum and the reconstructed molecular mass profile for fraction #31 are presented in Fig. 2(a and b). Three peaks were observed in the reconstructed mass pro"

Here, employing a novel hydroxylation-specific antibody, we directly show that proline 564 of HIF-1α and proline 531 of HIF-2α are hydroxylated under normoxia. Importantly, HIF-1α Pro-564 and HIF-2α Pro-531 hydroxylation is diminished with the treatment of hypoxia, cobalt chloride, desferrioxamine, or dimethyloxalyglycine, regardless of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene. Furthermore, in VHL-deficient cells, HIF-1α Pro-564 and HIF-2α Pro-531 had detectable amounts of hydroxylation following transition to hypoxia, indicating that the post-translational modification is not reversible. The introduction of v-Src or RasV12 oncogenes resulted in the stabilization of normoxic HIF-1α and the loss of hydroxylated Pro-564, demonstrating that oncogene-induced stabilization of HIF-1α is signaled through the inhibition of prolyl hydroxylation. Conversely, a constitutively active Akt oncogene stabilized HIF-1α under normoxia independently of prolyl hydroxylation, suggesting an alternative mechanism for HIF-1α stabilization.

Tumor cell expansion requires new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) to supply oxygen and nutrients. However, tumor blood vessels tend to be highly irregular and malformed. Consequently, solid tumors are subjected to transient changes in oxygenation due to the unpredictable opening and closing of malformed vessels. These areas of lowered oxygen concentration reduce the sensitivity of the tumor to radiation and some anticancer drugs. Radiation therapy specifically requires molecular oxygen to form cytotoxic DNA double strand breaks, whereas chemotherapeutic agents require access to proliferating cells to induce cytotoxicity. In addition, hypoxia can select for expansion of tumor cells that have diminished apoptotic sensitivity to radiotherapy or chemotherapy (1Graeber T.G. Osmanian C. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Koch C.J. Lowe S.W. Giaccia A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar). Thus, hypoxia promotes both malignant progression and reduces sensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Under hypoxic conditions, the expression of glycolytic enzymes is increased to compensate for the decreased respiratory generation of ATP (2Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Analysis of the enhancer elements of many hypoxia-induced genes involved in glycolysis reveals a common hypoxia-responsive element (HRE)1 with a core sequence of 5′-RCGTG-3′. The transcription factor that recognizes this HRE has been identified as the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a member of the basic helix-loop-helix Per, AhR, andSim (bHLH-PAS) family of transcription factors (3Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar, 4Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is composed of an α-subunit, which is degraded under normoxic conditions but stabilized under hypoxic conditions, and a constitutive β-subunit. This heterodimer is able to bind target DNA sequences to initiate gene transcription. Stabilization of HIF-1 occurs through the inhibition of 4-prolyl hydroxylase activity, an enzyme that requires molecular oxygen to be functional (5Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S.

This enzyme has been proposed to be a critical oxygen sensor and regulator of the HIF-1 transcriptional response to low oxygen conditions. Hydroxylation of HIF-1α decreases protein stability under normoxic conditions (6Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

A conserved proline residue, proline 564, is hydroxylated under normoxia, allowing the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to bind HIF-1α (8Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W.

The VHL complex adds ubiquitin to HIF-1α, which is then degraded by the proteasome. Under hypoxic conditions, it is proposed that 4-prolyl hydroxylase activity decreases because of a lack of oxygen, resulting in diminished proline 564 hydroxylation and HIF-1α protein stabilization.

Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). The hydroxylation event was first identified through the use of recombinant fusion proteins that were produced in Escherichia coli and treated with rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Fusion proteins treated with reticulocyte lysates interacted with VHL, whereas untreated fusion proteins did not bind VHL. Binding assays of in vitro translated HIF-1α and VHL indicated that only HIF-1α treated with unprocessed rabbit reticulocyte lysate was able to bind VHL. Most importantly, peptides of HIF-1α in which residue 564 was changed from a proline to a glycine could not abrogate the interaction between full-length, wild-type HIF-1α and VHL, providing genetic and biochemical evidence that the conserved proline was post-translationally modified to interact with VHL. Through the use of mass spectrometry, the modification of HIF-1α was found to be the hydroxylation of proline 564. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibitors of prolyl hydroxylation such as cobalt chloride (CoCl2), desferrioxamine (DFO), and dimethyloxalyglycine (DMOG) added further support for the importance of the hydroxylation event in regulating HIF-1α under normoxic conditions. In addition to cobaltous ions and iron chelators, other stresses have been reported to stabilize HIF-1α under normoxic conditions, including transforming oncogenes such as Ras, v-Src, and Akt (12Jiang B.H.

In this study, we generated a specific antibody to the hydroxylated form of proline 564 (Pro-564) to directly determine whether HIF-1α is hydroxylated under normoxic conditions and investigate whether different stresses, including the oncogenes Ras, v-Src, and Akt, stabilize the HIF-1α protein through the inhibition of prolyl hydroxylation. MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem. CoCl2 and DFO were purchased from Sigma. DMOG was a generous gift from Dr. Wayne Zundel. Antisera to hydroxylated HIF-1α were produced in rabbits immunized with a modified peptide of amino acids 558–565 of HIF-1α conjugated to KLH (Custom Antibody Group, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Hydroxylated HIF-1α antibody was then affinity purified by binding to immobilized modified peptide (SulfoLink gel, Pierce). Dot blots were performed by serially diluting both modified and unmodified peptide onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Total peptide levels were visualized by the addition of Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad). For immunoblotting, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.75% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mmsodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, and Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were then scraped and sonicated briefly (10 s). 50 μg of protein (as determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit, Pierce) were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P, AmershamBiosciences). Total HIF-1α protein was detected with an anti-HIF-1α antibody from Transduction Laboratories (clone 54). Total HIF-2α protein was detected with an anti-HIF-2α antibody from Novus Biologicals (clone H1α67). Anti-GAPDH was from Research Diagnostics, Inc. (clone 6C5). RCC4 cells, 786-O cells, HIF-1α knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts, and mouse embryo fibroblasts with HIF-1α alleles flanked by loxP sites were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (8Maxwell P.H.

RCC4/VHL and 786/VHL renal carcinoma cell lines with reintroduced VHL were generated by transfecting full-length VHL and selecting with G418. Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE-Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. HIF-1α mutant constructs were generated as described in Ref. 10Masson N. Willam C. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar. Briefly, plasmids were generated using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange, Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing (19Shibata T. Giaccia A.J. Brown J.M. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Hypoxia treatment was carried out in a hypoxia chamber (<0.2% O2) (Sheldon Corporation). Luciferase activity was determined by mixing 10 μl of extracts from 50 × 103 cells and 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega). Light production was measured for 10 s in a Monolight 2010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). To examine the hydroxylation status of the HIF-1α protein under different normoxic stabilizing conditions, we had a polyclonal antibody made against the hydroxylated proline residue 564 of HIF-1α. A synthetic peptide of residues 558–565 of HIF-1α that contained a hydroxylated proline 564 was used to immunize a rabbit for the production of polyclonal antisera. We first probed a serial dilution of modified and unmodified peptides with pre-immune serum, total antiserum, and purified antibody by dot blot. The unpurified antiserum recognized the peptide antigens, whereas the pre-immune serum did not recognize either the hydroxylated or unhydroxylated forms (Fig.1, compare C withB). Following affinity purification of the hydroxylation-specific antibody from the antiserum, we found that the antibody recognized the hydroxylated form of HIF-1α with at least a 100-fold higher specificity than the unmodified peptide (Fig.1 D). The purified hydroxylation-specific antibody did not, however, recognize peptides made against hydroxylated or unhydroxylated proline 402 (Fig. 1 F). Coomassie-stained membranes confirmed the presence of peptide (Fig. 1, A and E). To our knowledge, this is the first antibody that recognizes a specific hydroxylation event. With the purpose of further examining the specificity of this antibody, we transiently transfected HIF-1α knockout (HKO) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and MEFs with HIF-1α alleles flanked byloxP sites (17Ryan H.E. Poloni M. McNulty W. Elson D. Gassmann M. Arbeit J.M. Johnson R.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4010-4015PubMed Google Scholar) with full-length HIF-1α as well as three mutant versions of HIF-1α: proline 402 to alanine (P402A), proline 564 to glycine (P564G), and a double proline 402 and 564 mutant (P402A/P564G) (10Masson N. Willam C. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of these mutants and a 5X-HRE-luciferase reporter construct (19Shibata T. Giaccia A.J. Brown J.M. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) into the MEFs with floxed HIF-1α or HKO MEFs demonstrated an increased ability of these HIF-1α mutants to transactivate (Fig.2, A and B). Furthermore, by Western blot analysis, these mutants showed increased stability under normoxia (Fig. 2 C). We hypothesized that proline 564 when changed to a glycine residue could not be hydroxylated and should not be recognized by a hydroxylation-specific antibody. The proline 402 mutations were used to determine whether the antibody was specific for the hydroxylated form of proline 564 or whether it recognizes other hydroxylated proline residues. Under normoxic conditions, total HIF-1α protein is modestly increased with the proline 402 and 564 alterations, but the hydroxylation-specific antibody recognized only HIF-1α with an intact proline 564 (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, mutation of proline 402 did not affect proline 564 hydroxylation, indicating that hydroxylation of one site does not affect the modification of the other. To test the hydroxy-specific HIF-1α antibody against the HIF-1α protein under hypoxic conditions, we transiently transfected full-length human HIF-1α into the HKO MEFs. 24 h after transfection, transfected cells were then treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and/or hypoxia for 6 h (Fig. 2 D). Because the half-life of the HIF-1α protein under normoxic conditions is very short, estimated to be 5 min (20Jewell U.R. Kvietikova I. Scheid A. Bauer C. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1312-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), and the abundance of HIF-1α protein as a transcription factor is relatively low, we employed the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to increase the abundance of the hydroxylated form of the protein. Western blot analysis of whole-cell extracts showed that hypoxia induced the total HIF-1α protein, and treatment with MG132 further stabilized HIF-1α. Induction of total HIF-1α by hypoxia is weak because of the already high level of expression of HIF-1α in these cells. The hydroxylated Pro-564 of HIF-1α was only detectable in normoxic cells treated with MG132. Thus, the proteasome inhibitor data support the conclusion that the hypoxia-induced HIF-1α protein is not hydroxylated at proline residue 564. To determine whether HIF-1α stabilizing factors, under normoxic conditions, inhibit endogenous HIF-1α hydroxylation and, therefore, prevent degradation, RCC4 cells (8Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4179) Google Scholar) with and without functional VHL were subjected to various HIF-1α stabilizing stresses. Immunoblot analysis of total cell extracts show that RCC4 cells lacking functional VHL had detectable levels of the hydroxylated form of HIF-1α under normoxic conditions, which was further increased with the addition of a proteasome inhibitor (Fig.3 A). In these cells, hydroxylated Pro-564 decreased under hypoxic conditions as well as under treatment with DMOG, CoCl2, and DFO. In contrast, reintroduction of VHL into RCC4 cells (RCC4/VHL) resulted in low levels of hydroxylated HIF-1α under normoxic conditions (Fig.3 B). Hypoxia-treated cells exhibited a substantial decrease in levels of hydroxylated Pro-564 despite a massive increase in total HIF-1α protein. Treatment of cells with a proteasome inhibitor slightly increased the levels of hydroxylated HIF-1α. However, treatment of cells with the prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors DMOG, CoCl2, and DFO resulted in complete abrogation of Pro-564 hydroxylation. These data indicate that hypoxia and hypoxia mimetics inhibit prolyl hydroxylation, leading to HIF-1α stabilization. Similarly, 786 cells (18Iliopoulos O. Kibel A. Gray S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), which lack both HIF-1α and VHL, and 786 cells that had wild-type VHL reintroduced (786/VHL) but still lacked HIF-1α were examined to determine the effect of different hypoxia mimetics on HIF-2α. Because the peptide sequence that we employed to generate the antibody is 100% conserved throughout species as well as 90% conserved between HIF-1α and HIF-2α, we hypothesized that the antibody should also recognize the HIF-2α protein. In the 786 cells, which are deficient in both HIF-1α and VHL, we found detectable hydroxylated HIF-2α Pro-531 under all conditions examined (Fig.3 C). Treatment with proteasome inhibitor increased hydroxylated Pro-531, whereas hypoxia, DMOG, CoCl2, and DFO decreased hydroxylation. In the 786 cells stably expressing wild-type VHL we found hydroxylated HIF-2α in normoxic cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 3 D). Similar to what we found with RCC4 cells, hypoxia-treated 786/VHL cells resulted in a substantial increase in total HIF-2α protein without the corresponding increase in hydroxylated HIF-2α. Again, the different hypoxia mimetic stresses, DMOG, CoCl2, and DFO, resulted in increases in total protein but complete abrogation of the hydroxylated form. Thus, our antibody recognizes hydroxylated forms of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in cells. Ras, v-Src, and Akt have been shown previously to stabilize HIF-1α under normoxic conditions (12Jiang B.H. Agani F. Passaniti A. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5328-5335PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zundel W. Schindler C. Haas-Kogan D. Koong A. Kaper F. Chen E. Gottschalk A.R. Ryan H.E. Johnson R.S. Jefferson A.B.

We examined whether these oncogenes increase HIF-1α protein stabilization by inhibition of the hydroxylation of HIF-1α Pro-564. HKO cells were co-transfected with HIF-1α; RasV12, v-Src, or a constitutively active Akt (myristoylated and palmitoylated Akt; and a 5X-HRE-luciferase reporter construct (in a 3:1:1 ratio). The introduction of RasV12, v-Src, and Akt had dramatic inductive effects on HIF-1α transactivation ability (Fig.4 A). Conversely, a dominant negative form of Ras, RasN17, had no effect on HIF-1α transactivation. Protein levels of total HIF-1α increased substantially with the cotransfection of RasV12, v-Src, and Akt but not RasN17 (Fig. 4 B). Surprisingly, hydroxylated HIF-1α was not detected in the cells transfected with RasV12 or v-Src, even though there was a significant increase in protein levels. This experiment indicated that the oncogenes RasV12 and v-Src increase HIF-1 transactivation potential and stabilize HIF-1α through inhibition of the hydroxylation event. Thus, loss of prolyl hydroxylase activity may be the link between oncogenic activity, HIF-1, and malignant progression under normoxic conditions. Furthermore, the loss of prolyl hydroxylase activity provides a molecular explanation for the observations that many HIF-1-inducible genes can be observed in solid tumors that possess functional VHL. It is noteworthy that hydroxylated HIF-1α Pro-564 was detected in the cells expressing a constitutively active Akt. This finding strongly suggests that a second prolyl hydroxylase-independent mechanism also exists for HIF-1α stabilization under normoxic conditions. This is the first example of a hydroxylation-specific antibody. There are numerous antibodies that specifically recognize phosphorylated or acetylated protein motifs. Previously, determination of HIF-1α hydroxylation required recombinant fusion proteins, synthetic peptides, in vitro transcription/translation (IVTT), and/or mass spectrometry (5Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W.

Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). These methods require a substantial amount of effort, skill, and, in some cases, specialized equipment. The generation of hydroxylation-specific HIF-1α antibodies will provide an easier and more direct method to investigate how diverse stimuli induce HIF-1α stabilization. In addition, such antibodies will also be useful in the development of diagnostic assays and high throughput screening for prolyl hydroxylase regulatory molecules. Because the immunizing peptide used in this study encompasses a region of HIF-1α that is conserved from rainbow trout, frog, worm, mouse, and human, it should be a useful reagent in studying HIF-1α protein throughout evolutionarily distinct organisms. We have already tested this antibody against endogenous mouse HIF-1α, finding it to be cross-reactive. 2D. A. Chan, unpublished results. Genetically and pharmacologically, we were able to demonstrate by Western blot analysis the specificity of an antibody that recognizes only the hydroxylated form of HIF-1α. This antibody solely recognizes hydroxylated proline 564 and is not a pan-hydroxylation antibody as demonstrated by the lack of detection against proline 402 (Figs. 1,D and F and 2 C). The mutation of prolines 402 and/or 564 stabilizes the transactivation-competent HIF-1α protein under normoxic conditions (Fig. 2 and Ref. 5Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). These mutations prevent the amino acid residues from being hydroxylated. In the experiments presented in this paper, only HIF-1α with an intact proline 564 was specifically recognized. The status of hydroxylation of HIF-1α Pro-402 does not appear to affect the hydroxylation of HIF-1α Pro-564 or vice versa, confirming previous reports that the two hydroxylated prolines represent two independent mechanisms of stabilization and transactivation of HIF-1α (10Masson N. Willam C. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Notably, endogenous hydroxylated HIF-1α and HIF-2α proteins were detected under all the conditions examined in the VHL-deficient renal cell carcinomas RCC4 and 786, respectively, despite oxygen status or treatment with prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors. In contrast, hydroxylated HIF-1α and HIF-2α were detected under normoxia and, to a significantly lesser extent, under hypoxia in the cells with functional VHL. VHL is the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for targeting the HIF-1α protein for proteasomal degradation. When VHL is non-functional, the HIF-1α protein is stabilized regardless of oxygen status. These results suggest that when cells shift from normoxia to hypoxia, the hydroxylated protein is degraded and de novoprotein synthesis produces HIF-1α or HIF-2α that is not modified. These findings imply that normal protein turnover is the key to eliminating hydroxylated HIF-1α rather than “de-hydroxylation” of the protein. Moreover, DMOG, cobaltous ions, and iron chelators all stabilize a non-hydroxylated form of the HIF-1α protein (5Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J.

Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4489) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with previous reports of the effects of cobaltous ions and iron chelators on prolyl hydroxylase activity and indicate that iron is a necessary cofactor in the post-translational modification of HIF-1α. Thus, cobaltous ions, which compete with iron for binding to the prolyl hydroxylase, and iron chelation, which binds available iron, act as prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors and prevent prolyl hydroxylation. These specific prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors appear to completely abolish hydroxylase activity, whereas under hypoxia there still appears to be minimal activity of the hydroxylase in the renal carcinoma cells that have reintroduced VHL. An examination of HIF-1α protein in RCC4 and HIF-2α in 786 cells indicates that there may be an additional pathway that targets the α-subunit of HIF to the proteasome, because an increase in HIF-α protein levels occurs with the addition of a proteasome inhibitor. If VHL is the sole mechanism of targeting HIF-1α or HIF-2α protein to the proteasome, then blocking the proteasome should not increase total HIF-1α or HIF-2α protein levels. Taken together with the observation that there is a low level of hypoxic induction of HIF-1α in RCC4 and HIF-2α in 786 cells, we conclude that a secondary mechanism for HIF-1α and HIF-2α degradation independent of VHL also exists. It is not yet clear what regulates this mechanism, although a recent report suggests that Hsp90 is involved in a VHL-independent HIF-1α degradative pathway (22Isaacs J.S. Jung Y.J. Mimnaugh E.G. Martinez A. Cuttitta F. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29936-29944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). A molecular chaperone protein, Hsp90, plays a key role in the conformation and function of its numerous client proteins. The data presented above suggest that the Akt oncogene, a known substrate of Hsp90 (23Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10832-10837Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), may impinge on this means of regulation. We have shown that normoxic induction of HIF-1α by the oncogenes RasV12 and v-Src appears to be mediated by inhibition of the prolyl hydroxylation event, whereas Akt stabilization appears to be independent of the prolyl hydroxylation event. The above data suggest that Akt functions through a different mechanism than RasV12 and v-Src. Total HIF-1α increases similarly, although there is no apparent hydroxylated HIF-1α following the overexpression of RasV12 or v-Src. It is possible that HIF-1α stabilization by Akt overexpression is not a prolyl hydroxylation-independent mechanism but that the increase in HIF-1α is due to increased protein translation or decreased protein degradation. More specifically, Akt overexpression could result in increased transcription or translation of HIF-1α, saturating VHL or other degradation machinery. Akt could also impede the degradation of HIF-1α through inhibition of the VHL complex either directly or indirectly. More intriguing is the prospect that normoxic induction of HIF-1α by Akt compared with RasV12 or v-Src may arise from differential regulation of the two crucial proline (Pro-402 and Pro-564) sites in the oxygen degradation domain. Interestingly, Ras and v-Src both function through the same pathway in this case, which suggests that a wide variety of disparate normoxic stabilizing stresses may induce HIF-1α through a common means. Normoxic expression of HIF-1α in oncogenically transformed cells could provide a growth advantage to tumor cells by increasing the expression of specific growth factors such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These results are in agreement with previous reports that suggest that Ras and HIF-1α cooperate to transactivate downstream target genes (24Sheta E.A. Trout H. Gildea J.J. Harding M.A. Theodorescu D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7624-7634Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these data suggest that HIF-1α may act as a protumorigenic factor, even under normoxia, through the oncogene-mediated inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase activity. Thus, inhibiting the normoxic stabilization of HIF-1α may provide a therapeutic advantage.

V-ATPases in eukaryotes appear to be exclusive proton pumps that energize intracellular membranes of all cells as well as plasma membranes in a variety of animal cells (1Wieczorek H. Brown D. Grinstein S. Ehrenfeld J. Harvey W.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 637-648Google Scholar). V-ATPases play crucial roles for many cellular processes and may also be involved in diseases such as osteoporosis and cancer (2Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Google Scholar). More than a decade ago, bafilomycin A1, a plecomacrolide antibiotic containing a 16-membered lactone ring, was reported to be a specific inhibitor of V-ATPases with a K i value of less than 10 nm (3Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Google Scholar). A structure-activity study showed that the concanamycins, 18-membered plecomacrolides, exhibit 10-fold lowerK i values and thus are better and more specific inhibitors of V-ATPases than the bafilomycins (4Dröse S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3902-3906Google Scholar). Kinetic studies of the bovine chromaffin granule V-ATPase provided the first indirect evidence that bafilomycin A1 interacts with the hydrophobic Vo complex (5Hanada H. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 873-878Google Scholar). Direct evidence came from two independent approaches, both using the bovine-coated vesicle V-ATPase (6Crider B.P. Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17379-17381Google Scholar, 7Zhang J.M. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23518-23523Google Scholar). First, a latent acid-activated proton conductance of proteoliposomes containing the reconstituted Vo complex could be blocked by 1 nm bafilomycin A1 (6Crider B.P. Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17379-17381Google Scholar). Second, reconstituted vesicles containing the Vo complex added to clathrin-coated vesicles could protect ATP-dependent proton transport from bafilomycin inhibition (7Zhang J.M. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23518-23523Google Scholar). Since considerable protection was also achieved by the reconstituted 100-kDa subunit a alone, it was concluded that the binding site for bafilomycin may reside in this subunit. Affinity chromatography of chicken osteoclast V-ATPase using bafilomycin C1-coupled cellulose led to the purification of the holoenzyme (8Rautiala T.J. Koskinen A.M. Vaananen H.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 50-56Google Scholar). In the presence of 1 mm DCCD the V-ATPase did not bind to the column, indicating that the binding site for bafilomycin is near the binding site(s) for DCCD and may thus be located in the proteolipid, subunit c. However, because DCCD, especially at the rather high concentration of 1 mm, may bind to sites different from that in the proteolipid and may bind not only to carboxyl groups but also to sulfhydryl groups or to tyrosine residues (9Azzi A. Casey R.P. Nalecz M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 209-226Google Scholar), and since the 100-kDa subunit a was not clearly resolved in this study, the bafilomycin binding subunit was still not identified. Strong hints in favor of subunit c representing the bafilomycin binding subunit were provided by recent results from analysis of Neurospora crassa strains, indicating that those with point mutations in subunit c show a higher tolerance to bafilomycin (I50 80–400 nm) compared with the wild type (I50 6.3 nm); interestingly, the tolerance to concanamycin was not changed simultaneously (10Bowman B.J. Bowman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3965-3972Google Scholar). Based on extensive screening studies of systematically modified derivatives of concanamycin, a probe was designed that still inhibits V-ATPase activity and which generates upon UV-irradiation a covalent bond between the inhibitor and the V-ATPase (11Ingenhorst G. Bindseil K.U. Boddien C. Dröse S. Gaβel M. Altendorf K. Zeeck A. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 23: 4525-4532Google Scholar, 12Dröse S. Boddien C. Gaβel M. Ingenhorst G. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2816-2825Google Scholar). In the present report we show for the first time that this derivative of concanamycin A, 9-O-[p-(trifluoroethyldiazirinyl)-benzoyl]-21,23-dideoxy-23-[125I]iodo-concanolide A (J-concanolide A), binds only to subunit c of the V-ATPase from tobacco hornworm (M. sexta) midgut. As many as 20 wholeM. sexta midguts were dissected from feeding fifth instar larvae and homogenized in ice-cold buffer A (5 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm Pefabloc SC (Biomol), 5 mm Na-EDTA, pH 8.1). After centrifugation of the crude homogenate in a fixed-angle rotor at 12,000 ×gmax for 5 min at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in buffer A and centrifuged again. The resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer A and centrifuged in a fixed-angle rotor at 233,000 × gmax for 30 min at 4 °C to yield a final pellet that was solubilized in buffer B (16 mm Tris-HCl, 0.32 mm EDTA, 9.6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% C12E10, pH 8.1) at 4 °C with a detergent to protein ratio of 2:1. After centrifugation in a fixed-angle rotor at 233,000 × gmax for 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatant was layered on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient (3 ml of 40%, 2 ml of 30%, 2 ml of 20%, and 1.6 ml of 10% sucrose (w/v) dissolved in buffer B with 200 mm KCl and a lower detergent concentration of 0.01% C12E10) and centrifuged in a vertical rotor at 339,000 ×gmax for 90 min at 4 °C. The 30% sucrose fraction was diluted 4-fold with buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, 9.6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% C12E10, pH 8.1) containing 50 mmNaCl and subjected to anion exchange chromatography using a Mono Q (Amersham Biosciences) column. The V1/Vo ATPase was eluted in a linear salt gradient (50–400 mm NaCl dissolved in buffer C) at NaCl concentrations between 250 and 280 mm. The last step in the purification protocol was gel permeation chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (AmershamBiosciences), which was performed in buffer C containing 150 mm NaCl. The final yield was ∼1 mg of V-ATPase per 20 midguts. For purification of the Vo complex, midguts of larvae starved for 16–20 h were prepared, homogenized, and centrifuged twice as described above. The second pellet was resuspended in a buffer consisting of 5 mm Tris-HCl, 0.8 m KI, 5 mm Na-EDTA, and 5 mm Pefabloc SC (pH 8.1) and incubated for 30 min on ice. Then the sample was diluted with 16 mm Tris-HCl, 0.32 mm EDTA, 9.6 mm2-mercaptoethanol (pH 8.1) to a KI concentration of 40 mmand centrifuged at 233,000 × gmax for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in the dilution buffer and centrifuged again under the same conditions. The final pellet was solubilized and purified as described above for the V1/Vo ATPase, except for the use of 20% instead of the 30% sucrose fraction after rate zonal centrifugation. The final yield of the preparation was ∼0.5 mg of Vocomplex per 20 midguts. J-concanolide A as well as its125I-labeled form were synthesized as described elsewhere (11Ingenhorst G. Bindseil K.U. Boddien C. Dröse S. Gaβel M. Altendorf K. Zeeck A. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 23: 4525-4532Google Scholar). Concanamycin A, bafilomycin A1, and bafilomycin B1 were isolated according to published procedures (12Dröse S. Boddien C. Gaβel M. Ingenhorst G. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2816-2825Google Scholar). Salicylihalamide was a generous gift from M. R. Boyd (National Cancer Institute, MD, USA). To avoid freeze thaw cycles, which have significant influence on the stability of the substances, aliquots of stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide were stored at −70 °C and thawed only once immediately before use. The actual concentrations of the stock solutions were determined spectrophotometrically. ATPase assays with a final volume of 160 μl and a pH of 8.1 contained 3–4 μg of protein, 50 mmTris-Mops, 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm sodium azide, 20 mm KCl, 0.003% C12E10, 20 mm NaCl, and 3 mm Tris-HCl. After 5 min of preincubation at 30 °C with or without inhibitors, 1 mm Tris-ATP was added, and after an additional 2 min the reaction was stopped by placing the reaction tubes in liquid nitrogen. Determination of the produced inorganic phosphate followed the protocol of Wieczorek et al.(13Wieczorek H. Cioffi M. Klein U. Harvey W.R. Schweikl H. Wolfersberger M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 608-616Google Scholar). 20 μg of the samples were incubated with varying concentrations of J-concanolide A in a volume of 30–40 μl for 1 h on ice or 3 min at room temperature and irradiated for 3 min with UV light (366 nm) on ice. After irradiation, 7.5–10 μl of 5-fold sample buffer (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) was added. The mixture was heated for 45 s at 95 °C or 30 min at 40 °C, cooled on ice, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10–15% T, 3.3% C; (15Ratajczak R. Bot. Acta. 1994; 107: 201-209Google Scholar)) or to Tricine-SDS-PAGE (16.5% T, 3% C separating gel and 10% T, 3% C spacer gel (16Schägger H. v. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar)), followed by Coomassie staining. The gels were either dried on Whatman paper or sealed in plastic wrap before they were exposed to a phosphoscreen for as many as 72 h and analyzed with the aid of a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics). After SDS-PAGE of the purified V1/Vo ATPase, the 100-kDa and the 17-kDa Coomassie-stained bands, respectively, were prepared for mass spectrometry in a procedure adapted from Shevchenko et al.(17Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Google Scholar) and Zhang et al. (18Zhang X. Herring C.J. Romano P.R. Szczepaowska J. Brzeska H. Hinnebusch A.G. Qin J. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2050-2059Google Scholar). Briefly, the proteins were digested by trypsin or chymotrypsin in the gel, and the peptides were mapped using MALDI-MS (TofSpec-2E, Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK). Fifth instar larvae of M. sexta(Lepidoptera, Sphingidae), weighing 6–8 g, were reared under long-day conditions (16 h of light) at 27 °C using a synthetic diet modified according to Bell et al.(19Bell R.A. Borg T.K. Ittycheriah P.I. J. Insect Physiol. 1974; 20: 669-678Google Scholar). The preparation of highly purified goblet cell apical membranes followed published protocols (13Wieczorek H. Cioffi M. Klein U. Harvey W.R. Schweikl H. Wolfersberger M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 608-616Google Scholar, 20Cioffi M. Wolfersberger M.G. Tissue & Cell. 1983; 15: 781-803Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE, Western blotting on nitrocellulose membranes, and immunostaining were performed as described previously (13Wieczorek H. Cioffi M. Klein U. Harvey W.R. Schweikl H. Wolfersberger M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 608-616Google Scholar, 21Wieczorek H. Putzenlechner M. Zeiske W. Klein U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15340-15347Google Scholar). The unequivocal assignment of an inhibitor such as concanamycin or bafilomycin to a special V-ATPase subunit requires experimental evidence for the existence of all constitutive subunits in the V-ATPase preparation used. Although nearly all subunits of the insect V-ATPase have been cloned and sequenced (22Wieczorek H. Grüber G. Harvey W.R. Huss M. Merzendorfer H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 67-74Google Scholar, 23Merzendorfer H. Reineke S. Zhao X.F. Jacobmeier B. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 25: 369-379Google Scholar), we had so far not been able to identify the 100-kDa subunit a of the insect V-ATPase unequivocally (24Schweikl H. Klein U. Schindlbeck M. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11136-11142Google Scholar, 25Wieczorek H. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 335-343Google Scholar, 26Merzendorfer H. Huss M. Schmid R. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17372-17378Google Scholar). Because this subunit on the one hand appeared to be very sensitive to proteolysis (27Adachi I. Arai H. Pimental R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 960-966Google Scholar), and on the other hand was proposed to be a candidate for bafilomycin binding (7Zhang J.M. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23518-23523Google Scholar), we repeatedly modified purification protocols to recover a putative subunit a, also in the insect V-ATPase. Degradation during the process of purification was evidently not responsible for our lack of evidence because even with complex cocktails of protease inhibitors we were not able to resolve subunit a (28Wieczorek H. Grüber G. Harvey W.R. Huss M. Merzendorfer H. Zeiske W. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 127-135Google Scholar). Purification of the M. sexta V-ATPase according to a new protocol as compared with previous procedures (Ref. 24Schweikl H. Klein U. Schindlbeck M. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11136-11142Google Scholar, see under “Experimental Procedures”) resulted, mainly because of the presence of 200 mm KCl during zonal centrifugation of the detergent-solubilized protein in a sucrose gradient, for the first time in the detection of a 100-kDa subunit in an insect V-ATPase preparation (Fig. 1, lane 3). The 100-kDa band reacted in immunoblots with polyclonal antibodies to the 116-kDa subunit a of the V-ATPase from bovine chromaffin granules (Ref. 29Gillespie J. Ozanne S. Tugal B. Percy J. Warren M. Haywood J. Apps D. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 69-72Google Scholar, not shown, but see below the results for the Vocomplex), suggesting the existence of a 100-kDa subunit a, also in theM. sexta midgut V-ATPase. Respective evidence had already been provided recently by the demonstration of at least two genes encoding a V-ATPase subunit a in the midgut (23Merzendorfer H. Reineke S. Zhao X.F. Jacobmeier B. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 25: 369-379Google Scholar). Definitive proof that the 100-kDa band represented the V-ATPase subunit a was finally obtained from MALDI-MS. A number of tryptic peptides were found in the map of the protein (Fig.2 A), providing 36% sequence coverage (compare Ref. 23Merzendorfer H. Reineke S. Zhao X.F. Jacobmeier B. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 25: 369-379Google Scholar with GenBankTM accession no. AJ249390).Figure 2Sequences of subunits a and c, indicating tryptic peptides found by MALDI-MS.

Dow J.A.T. Earley F.G.P. Klein U. Jäger D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5649-5653Google Scholar, 31Gräf R. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20908-20913Google Scholar). Further treatment of the membranes with chaotropic iodide (32Gräf R. Lepier A. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3767-3774Google Scholar) supported the dissociation of V1complexes, leaving virtually V1-free membranes. According to silver staining of SDS gels, the Vo complex appeared to consist of five major protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 100, 40, 26, 20, and 17 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1, lane 4). Four polypeptides could be identified as established Vosubunits by staining Western blots with specific antibodies against the Vo subunits a, d, and e, respectively (Fig. 1, lanes 6–8) or by DCCD-labeling of subunit c (Fig. 1, lane 5). The fifth major band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼26 kDa was N-terminally sequenced and appeared to be a dimer of subunit c (data not shown). J-concanolide A (Fig. 3) was synthesized as described elsewhere (11Ingenhorst G. Bindseil K.U. Boddien C. Dröse S. Gaβel M. Altendorf K. Zeeck A. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 23: 4525-4532Google Scholar). Two features of this potential inhibitor appeared to be essential for the identification of the plecomacrolide binding subunit(s). First, thep-(trifluoroethyldiazirinyl)-benzoyl group at position C9 generates, after treatment with UV light, a highly reactive carbene, which itself can be inserted into covalent bonds, especially C-H bonds. Second, the 125I at position C23 of the hemiketal ring could be used as a radioactive tracer, thus making detection of the labeled subunit by autoradiography possible. Before performing labeling experiments we tested the inhibitory efficacy of J-concanolide A on the activity of the V-ATPase holoenzyme. As shown in Fig. 4, J-concanolide A inhibited the purified V-ATPase half-maximally at a concentration of 15–20 μm, equivalent to an I50 value of ∼0.6 μmol per mg of protein. This value was 1000 times higher than that for the plecomacrolides concanamycin A and bafilomycin A1 and B1, respectively, and the benzolactone enamide salicylihalamide. All of these substances inhibited theM. sexta V-ATPase at submicromolar concentrations, with I50 values of ∼0.5 nmol per mg and with half-maximal concentrations of 10 nm. Although J-concanolide A was three orders of magnitude less inhibitory, it still was an effective inhibitor with an I50 value comparable to that of theEscherichia coli Kdp-ATPase for bafilomycins (4Dröse S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3902-3906Google Scholar). UV illumination of the purified M. sexta V-ATPase in the presence of J-concanolide A led, after SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining, and autoradiography of the gel to the detection of 125I at the exact position of the V-ATPase subunit c (Fig.5 A). The identity of the band as subunit c was proven by MALDI-MS. Analysis of tryptic and chymotryptic peptides resulted in a sequence coverage of 76% with subunit c (Fig. 2 B, compare Ref. 33Dow J.A. Goodwin S.F. Kaiser K. Gene. 1992; 122: 355-360Google Scholar with GenBankTM accession no. X65051). However, two distinct masses of 1523,9 m/z and 1739,9m/z, respectively, were not covered by the known sequence of subunit c. These fragments might derive from an isoform of the c subunit, c', which is present in V-ATPases of other species (2Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Google Scholar) but so far could not be identified in M. sexta. On the one hand, genomic Southern blots had suggested that there is only one single gene for subunit c in M. sexta, but on the other hand, Northern blots had revealed two transcripts (33Dow J.A. Goodwin S.F. Kaiser K. Gene. 1992; 122: 355-360Google Scholar). The latter finding may be interpreted as a hint in favor of a c' isoform. Nevertheless, labeling of the band representing subunit c and/or a putative isoform was specific because it was dependent on the concentration of J-concanolide A (Fig. 5 A) and because labeling with 10 μm J-concanolide A was prevented by preincubation with concentrations of concanamycin A ranging from 1 to 300 μm (Fig. 5 B). Fig. 5 B shows that a concentration of 1 μm concanamycin was not enough to displace J-concanolide A. At first glance this may appear counterintuitive, because at a concentration of 0.1 μm the V-ATPase activity was already inhibited nearly 100%. However, one has to keep in mind that already the binding of one molecule of concanamycin A to one of the probably six subunits c in a Vo complex may lead to complete inhibition of enzyme activity, whereas six molecules of concanamycin A would be needed for complete displacement of J-concanolide A. To verify the correlation between inhibition and labeling by J-concanolide A, we cut out the Coomassie-stained bands of subunit c from the SDS-PAGE gel and measured their radioactivity in a γ-counter. Indeed, a concentration-dependent correlation between bound radioactivity and inhibition of the enzyme activity was found (Fig.6). Labeling of the holoenzyme subunit c evidently was specific for plecomacrolides, because it was also prevented by bafilomycin A1 and B1, respectively (Fig. 5 C). This finding implied that the binding site for both families of plecomacrolide antibiotics, concanamycin and the bafilomycins, in general resides in subunit c. At present, we cannot explain the discrepancy between this result and the results obtained with N. crassa mutants, which exhibited a higher tolerance to bafilomycin but not to concanamycin (10Bowman B.J. Bowman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3965-3972Google Scholar). Because labeling was not impaired by salicylihalamide, we conclude that the site(s) and mechanism of inhibition for benzolactone enamides may be different from that for plecomacrolides.Figure 6Correlation between inhibition of V-ATPase activity by J-concanolide A and bound radioactivity.Bands of subunit c from the gel in Fig. 5 A were excised. The bound radioactivities were measured in a γ-counter and then compared with the enzyme activities. The background radioactivity was subtracted by using an equivalent-sized gel slice right to the lane with the lowest concentration of J-concanolide A (0.1 μm). The radioactivity of the 100 μm band was set to 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In another approach we used, in addition to the purified holoenzyme, the purified Vo complex and highly purified goblet cell apical membranes in which the V-ATPase is the predominant protein and, moreover, resides in its native lipid surrounding (Fig.7). Clear labeling of subunit c was again obtained for the Vo complex as well as for the goblet cell apical membrane. Taken together, we provided for the first time direct proof that subunit c, which forms the major part of the proton translocating Vo complex of V-ATPases, carries the binding site for plecomacrolide antibiotics. Experiments more precisely defining the site of covalent modification are in progress. We thank G.

https://openalex.org/W2069561137,"Genetic alterations of APC and CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) have been identified in a number of human cancers including tumors arising in the colon and liver. Mutations in these genes lead to abnormal accumulation of beta-catenin and constitutive activation of target genes in the Wnt signaling pathway. To clarify the precise role of accumulated beta-catenin in colorectal carcinogenesis, we searched for genes involved in the beta-catenin/Tcf signaling pathway by cDNA microarray. MT1-MMP (membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase) was among 84 genes that were down-regulated after beta-catenin had been depleted by transduction of wild-type APC in SW480 cells. Expression of MT1-MMP was elevated in 22 of 24 colon carcinomas we examined. Reporter assays and an electromobility-shift assay revealed a DNA fragment between -1169 bp and -1163 bp in the 5' flanking region of this gene to be a target of the beta-catenin/Tcf4 complex. Our results indicate that MT1-MMP is a direct down-stream target in the Wnt signaling pathway, and that one of the ways accumulated beta-catenin contributes to colorectal carcinogenesis is by transactivating this gene."

https://openalex.org/W1983889779,"Nuclear DNA damage and death receptor (CD95) activation by ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) play a major role in UVB-induced apoptosis. Removal of DNA damage combined with inhibition of death receptor activation resulted in pronounced but not complete suppression of apoptosis, indicating that a third independent pathway is involved. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause apoptosis and are induced by UVB, the radical scavenger pyrrolidene-dithiocarbamate (PDTC) was used. PDTC prevented UVB-induced apoptosis partially, H(2)O(2)-induced cell death largely, but not CD95-mediated apoptosis. The same was observed for cytochrome c release from mitochondria, another important event during apoptosis. The proapoptotic protein Bid was cleaved upon exposure to UVB or to agonistic anti-CD95-antibodies, but not to H(2)O(2), indicating that H(2)O(2) uses a different pathway. The fact that PDTC neither inhibited CD95-mediated apoptosis nor affected UV-induced DNA damage indicated that ROS generated during UVB irradiation may directly trigger mitochondrial cytochrome c release, thereby contributing to apoptosis. Accordingly, complete inhibition of apoptosis was observed when in addition to DNA damage removal via photoreactivation and blockade of CD95 signaling by caspase-8 inhibitor zIETD, PDTC was added before UVB exposure. This indicates that DNA damage, death receptor activation and ROS formation contribute to UVB-induced apoptosis in an essential and independent way."
https://openalex.org/W2335297539,"BCR/ABL fusion tyrosine kinase is responsible for the initiation and maintenance of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph(1))-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a cohort of acute lymphocytic leukemias (ALL). STI571 (Gleevec), a novel anti-leukemia drug targeting BCR/ABL kinase can induce remissions of the Ph(1)-positive leukemias. STI571 was recently combined with the standard cytostatic drugs to achieve better therapeutic results and to overcome emerging drug resistance mechanisms. We decided to search for a more specific partner compound for STI571. Our previous studies showed that a signaling protein phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3k) is essential for the growth of CML cells, but not of normal hematopoietic cells (Blood, 86:726,1995). Therefore the anti- Ph(1)-leukemia effect of the combination of BCR/ABL kinase inhibitor STI571 and PI-3k inhibitor wortmannin (WT) or LY294002 (LY) was tested. We showed that STI571+WT exerted a synergistic effect against the Ph(1)-positive cell lines, but did not affect the growth of Ph(1)-negative cell line. Moreover, the combinations of STI571+WT or STI571+LY were effective in the inhibition of clonogenic growth of CML-chronic phase and CML-blast crisis patient cells, while sparing normal bone marrow cells. Single colony RT-PCR assay showed that colonies arising from the mixture of CML cells and normal bone marrow cells after treatment with STI571+WT were selectively depleted of BCR/ABL-positive cells. Biochemical analysis of the CML cells after the treatment revealed that combination of STI571+WT caused a more pronounced activation of caspase-3 and induced massive apoptosis, in comparison to STI571 and WT alone. In conclusion, combination of STI571+WT or STI571+LY may represent a novel approach against the Ph(1)-positive leukemias."
https://openalex.org/W2076438593,"We have compared the in vitroregulatory properties of recombinant human cardiac troponin reconstituted using wild type troponin T with troponin containing the ΔLys-210 troponin T mutant that causes dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and the R92Q troponin T known to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Troponin containing ΔLys-210 troponin T inhibited actin-tropomyosin-activated myosin subfragment-1 ATPase activity to the same extent as wild type at pCa8.5 (>80%) but produced substantially less enhancement of ATPase atpCa4.5. The Ca2+ sensitivity of ATPase activation was increased (ΔpCa50 = +0.2pCa units) and cooperativity of Ca2+ activation was virtually abolished. Equimolar mixtures of wild type and ΔLys-210 troponin T gave a lower Ca2+ sensitivity than with wild type, while maintaining the diminished ATPase activation atpCa4.5 observed with 100% mutant. In contrast, R92Q troponin gave reduced inhibition at pCa8.5 but greater activation than wild type at pCa4.5; Ca2+sensitivity was increased but there was no change in cooperativity.In vitro motility assay of reconstituted thin filaments confirmed the ATPase results and moreover indicated that the predominant effect of the ΔLys-210 mutation was a reduced sliding speed.

The heart appears thin walled and distended and, at the microscopic level, there is moderate myocyte hypertrophy and death, along with replacement fibrosis. Echocardiographic screening of relatives of affected individuals suggests that ∼25–35% of cases are familial (1Keeling P.J. Gang Y. Smith G. Seo H. Bent S.E. Murday V. Caforio A.L. McKenna W.J. Br.

It was noteworthy that affected subjects did not have ventricular hypertrophy, and histology from one subject showed mildly increased interstitial fibrosis without the myocyte and myofibrillar disarray characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). These mutations therefore appear to cause dilated cardiomyopathy directly and induce a phenotype that is distinctly different from HCM. HCM is known to be caused by mutations in at least 10 genes, all but one of which encodes a sarcomeric protein (3Seidman J.G. Seidman C. Cell. 2001; 104: 557-567Google Scholar, 9Blair E. Redwood C. Ashrafian H. Oliveira M. Broxholme J. Kerr B. Salmon A. Ostman-Smith I. Watkins H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1215-1220Google Scholar). In contrast to the contractile protein gene mutations that cause DCM, the functional consequences of the HCM mutations have been extensively characterized (reviewed in Refs. 3Seidman J.G. Seidman C. Cell. 2001; 104: 557-567Google Scholar, 10Redwood C.S. Moolman-Smook J.C. Watkins H. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 44: 20-36Google Scholar, and 11Hernandez O.M. Housmans P.R. Potter J.D. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 1125-1136Google Scholar). Most mutations in sarcomeric proteins have been found to increase maximum shortening speed and/or Ca2+ sensitivity in vitro, which may result in energetic compromise through increased cost of force productionin vivo (9Blair E.

In HCM families, some individuals go on to develop a dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype, presumably through induction of apoptosis (3Seidman J.G. Seidman C. Cell. 2001; 104: 557-567Google Scholar). Thus, one plausible hypothesis to explain how different mutations in the same gene can cause different cardiomyopathies is that DCM mutations produce similar, but more severe, perturbations of contractile protein function, sufficient to result in cell death. Alternatively, the DCM mutations in sarcomeric protein genes could initiate disease through qualitatively different perturbations of contractility (6Kamisago M. Sharma S.D. DePalma S.R. Solomon S. Sharma P. McDonough B. Smoot L. Mullen M.P. Woolf P.K. Wigle E.D. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Jarcho J. Shapiro L.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 1688-1696Google Scholar, 16Marston S.B. Hodgkinson J.L. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 1-4Google Scholar). Functional analysis of different mutations within a single gene that produce the divergent phenotypes of HCM and DCM provides a valuable opportunity to investigate the triggers that discriminate between these two disease pathways. In this report, we have focused on the ΔLys-210 troponin T mutant that causes DCM. In common with the HCM troponin T mutations, it is highly likely that this apparently subtle mutation acts in a dominant-negative manner and is incorporated into the thin filament, where it affects normal thin filament function. The deleted amino acid forms one of a stretch of four lysine residues in human cardiac troponin T (amino acids 207–210). These lie within the globular C-terminal T2 domain (residues 188–288) which binds to troponins I and C as well as to tropomyosin (17Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 575-602Google Scholar) and may therefore affect thin filament function by a variety of mechanisms. We have compared the changes in thin filament function caused by the ΔLys-210 mutation with those caused by a mutation in troponin T that causes HCM. For the latter we have used the R92Q troponin T mutant, which has been extensively characterized in transgenic mouse models (13Montgomery D.E. Tardiff J.C. Chandra M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 583-592Google Scholar, 18Oberst L. Zhao G. Park J.T. Brugada R. Michael L.H. Entman M.L. Roberts R. Marian A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1498-1505Google Scholar, 19Tardiff J.C.

Ashley, unpublished data. 2R. Willott and C. Ashley, unpublished data. but has not yet been examined in reconstituted thin filaments in vitro. We found that the ΔLys-210 mutation had distinctive effects upon thin filament function: the maximally activated ATPase activity and filament sliding speed were decreased, and Ca2+ activation became non-cooperative. This pattern of changes was quite unlike the effect of the R92Q HCM mutation (increased ATPase activity and sliding speed and higher Ca2+ sensitivity with unaltered cooperativity) but closely resembled the properties of troponin extracted from end stage failing human hearts studied by the same techniques (22Purcell I.F. Bing W. Marston S.B. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 884-891Google Scholar, 23Knott A. Purcell I.F. Marston S.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 469-482Google Scholar). Rabbit skeletal muscle actin, rabbit and human cardiac muscle α-tropomyosin, and subfragment-1 (S-1) derived by chymotryptic digestion of whole rabbit skeletal muscle myosin were prepared as previously described (22Purcell I.F.

Res. 2000; 86: 1146-1152Google Scholar). Recombinant wild type human troponin subunits were overexpressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli and subsequently purified (24Redwood C.S. Lohmann K. Bing W. Esposito G.M. Elliott K. Abdulrazzak H. Knott A. Purcell I. Marston S.B. Watkins H. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1146-1152Google Scholar). pMW172 expression constructs encoding R92Q and ΔLys-210 troponin T were made, respectively, by subcloning from an existing plasmid cytomegalovirus construct (12Sweeney H.L. Feng H.S. Yang Z. Watkins H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14406-14410Google Scholar) and using a two-step PCR protocol for site-directed mutagenesis. Whole troponin complexes were formed using a development of our established protocol (25Elliott K. Watkins H. Redwood C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22069-22074Google Scholar). The subunits were mixed in a ratio of 1.5 troponin C:1 troponin I:1 troponin T in 6 m urea, 1m KCl, 10 mm imidazole, 50 μmCaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% sodium azide, pH 7.0, and the concentrations of first urea and then KCl were reduced using a stepwise dialysis protocol to 0 and 200 mm,respectively. The mixtures were centrifuged (12,300 ×g, 5 min) to remove insoluble material and intact troponin purified by gel filtration using a Sepharose 200 column. Complexes were then dialyzed into the appropriate assay buffer. The final proportions of individual subunits were measured by scanning densitometry and found to be 1.00:0.95:1.12 (troponin T:troponin I:troponin C;n = 3) for wild type and both mutants. Assays were carried out as previously described using 0.5 μm myosin S-1 and thin filaments reconstituted using either 3.5 μmactin, 1 μm tropomyosin, and 1 μm troponin or 3.5 μm actin, 0.5 μm tropomyosin, and 0.5 μm troponin in 5 mm PIPES, 3.87 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0, at 37 °C (25Elliott K. Watkins H. Redwood C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22069-22074Google Scholar). The free Ca2+ concentration was set using 1 mm EGTA and the appropriate concentration of CaCl2 as previously described (25Elliott K. Watkins H. Redwood C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22069-22074Google Scholar). The movement of thin filaments over a bed of immobilized skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin (HMM) was investigated using the in vitro motility assay as we have described (24Redwood C.S. Lohmann K. Bing W. Esposito G.M. Elliott K. Abdulrazzak H. Knott A. Purcell I. Marston S.B. Watkins H. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1146-1152Google Scholar, 26Bing W. Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 335-340Google Scholar). F-actin was labeled with rhodamine-phalloidin (φ) as described by Kron et al. (27Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Google Scholar). HMM at 100 μg/ml was infused in buffer A (50 mm KCl, 25 mmimidazole-HCl, pH 7.4, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol) to provide a coating of immobilized HMM on the coverslip. The surface was blocked by infusing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in buffer A, and then reconstituted thin filaments were infused. All experiments were carried out at 28 °C with the following final concentrations of reconstituted thin filament proteins: 10 nm rabbit skeletal actin, 30 nm human cardiac tropomyosin, 0–20 nm reconstituted human cardiac troponin in buffer A plus 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.02 mg/ml catalase, 3 mg/ml glucose, 0.5% methylcellulose, 1 mm MgATP, ± troponin at assay concentration. Both tropomyosin and troponin were titrated to determine saturating concentrations. The movement of actin (φ) tropomyosin filaments over the immobilized skeletal muscle HMM was observed under a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope (×63/1.4 objective). Four 15 s videos were recorded in each cell before any significant photobleaching had occurred. Videos were digitized, and the movement was analyzed to determine fraction of filaments moving and velocity of motile filaments using the automatic tracking program described by Marston et al. (28Marston S.B. Fraser I.D. Bing W. Roper G. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 497-506Google Scholar). Troponin complexes were reconstituted from recombinant human cardiac troponins I, C, and T using wild type troponin T, ΔLys-210 mutant troponin T, or R92Q mutant troponin T. Thin filaments were assembled using rabbit skeletal actin, rabbit or human α-tropomyosin, and wild type or mutant troponin. The functional properties of wild type and mutant troponin T were compared by assay of thin filament activation of skeletal muscle myosin S-1 ATPase activity and by thein vitro motility assay using skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin. Actin cosedimentation assays carried out as previously described (25Elliott K. Watkins H. Redwood C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22069-22074Google Scholar) showed that the binding of the wild type and both mutant troponins to actin-tropomyosin were indistinguishable (data not shown). In ATPase experiments carried out under activating conditions, the addition of wild type troponin increased ATPase activity, reaching a plateau at 207 ± 3% of the ATPase rate obtained using actin-tropomyosin alone, whereas when troponin containing ΔLys-210 troponin T was added the maximum ATPase activation was only 167 ± 6% of the actin-tropomyosin rate. This difference was consistently seen in four different troponin preparations and was highly significant (p <0.001) (Fig.1 A). At pCa 5.4, troponin increased the speed of actin-tropomyosin filament sliding in the in vitro motility assay, reaching a plateau at 10–15 nm troponin (Fig.2 A). As previously observed (24Redwood C.S. Lohmann K. Bing W. Esposito G.M. Elliott K. Abdulrazzak H. Knott A. Purcell I. Marston S.B. Watkins H. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1146-1152Google Scholar, 27Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Google Scholar), wild type troponin increased sliding velocity to 125 ± 2.6% that of actin-tropomyosin filaments. However, filaments reconstituted with troponin containing ΔLys-210 troponin T gave a significantly reduced sliding speed (111 ± 2.7% of actin-tropomyosin), and this difference was highly reproducible (p <0.0001, 11 separate experiments, Fig. 1 B). Troponin containing ΔLys-210 mutant troponin T also induced a small but significant decrease (p <0.05) in the fraction of filaments motile under activating conditions compared with wild type troponin (Figs. 1 C and 2 B). Gel electrophoresis of the reconstituted thin filaments showed that both wild type and mutant thin filaments contained a full complement of bound troponin subunits and tropomyosin (Fig. 2 C). Under relaxing conditions (pCa9), ATPase activation and filament motility of thin filaments containing wild type and ΔLys-210 mutant troponin T were indistinguishable. ATPase activity was inhibited by ∼90% (Fig. 1 A), and in vitro motility was switched off by troponin such that <10% of the filaments were moving, and the speed of the remaining moving filaments was about 40% slower than actin-tropomyosin filaments, in agreement with previous measurements (24Redwood C.S. Lohmann K. Bing W. Esposito G.M. Elliott K. Abdulrazzak H. Knott A. Purcell I. Marston S.B. Watkins H. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1146-1152Google Scholar, 29Burton D. Abdulrazzak H. Knott A. Elliott K. Redwood C. Watkins H. Marston S. Ashley C. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 443-451Google Scholar) using this system (Fig. 1, B andC). The maximum switch-off of motility required 10–15 nm troponin with both wild type and ΔLys-210 mutant troponin T. Comparing data from paired preparations of thin filaments, we found no significant difference in the fraction of filaments moving at saturating troponin concentrations (Fig. 1 C) nor at partially saturating concentrations (2.5–5 nm troponin). These results demonstrate that neither the EC50 of inhibition caused by troponin containing ΔLys-210 mutant troponin T, nor the maximum inhibition of motility, was different from wild type. Thin filaments reconstituted with troponin containing the HCM troponin T mutation R92Q reproducibly gave enhanced activation of ATPase activity (224 ± 5% of actin-tropomyosin activity compared with 207 ± 3% using wild type) and thin filament sliding velocity (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, atpCa9 thin filaments containing R92Q troponin T reproducibly gave less inhibition of ATPase (79% compared with 90% using wild type troponin) and less inhibition of filament motility than wild type (p = <0.05; see Fig. 1, A andC). We determined the Ca2+ concentration dependence of thin filament activation of S-1 ATPase activity and motility using concentrations of troponin that gave maximal inhibition of filament activity at pCa9 (1 μm for ATPase, 15 nm for motility assay; Fig. 3and Table I). A consistent pattern of results was obtained with both techniques: the Ca2+-dependent curves for ATPase activation, fraction of filaments motile, and filament velocity of thin filaments containing ΔLys-210 mutant troponin T were much less steep (i.e. less cooperative) than those obtained using wild type troponin, and 50% activation was shifted to lower Ca2+concentrations. The data were fitted to the Hill equation:rate = a + b/(1 + 10nH(pCa-pCa50)). The ΔLys-210 mutation increased calculated pCa50by 0.19 ± 0.03, 0.28 ± 0.04, and 0.31 ± 0.03pCa units for ATPase, fraction of filaments motile, and sliding speed, respectively. The apparent Hill coefficients,n H, derived from fits of the mutant troponin data were close to unity (n H = 1.24 ± 0.06, 0.88 ± 0.19, and 0.90 ± .12, respectively) and the ATPase data were well fitted by a simple saturation equation (rate =V max[Ca2+]/(EC50+[Ca2+]) with EC50 = 0.25 ± 0.03 μm), indicating that these thin filaments were not cooperatively activated by Ca2+. In contrast, the R92Q troponin T mutation had a different effect; the Ca2+ sensitivity of ATPase regulation was increased with no change in cooperativity (Table I).Table IpCa50 values and Hill coefficients (nH) for the Ca2+ activation of thin filaments containing wild type and mutant troponinATPasepCa50n HSliding velocitypCa50n HMotile fraction pCa50n HWild type troponin T6.48 ± 0.02 (n= 8)2.98 ± 0.18 (n = 8)6.59 ± 0.05 (n = 3)1.65 ± 0.13 (n = 3)6.75 ± 0.13 (n = 3)1.85 ± 0.46 (n = 3)ΔLys-210 troponin T6.67 ± 0.01 (n = 8)1.24 ± 0.06 (n = 8)6.90 ± 0.08 (n= 3)0.90 ± 0.12 (n = 3)7.03 ± 0.15 (n = 3)0.88 ± 0.19 (n = 3)R92Q troponin T6.72 ± 0.03 (n = 8)2.97 ± 0.38 (n= 8)NDaNot determined.NDaNot determined.NDaNot determined.NDaNot determined.ATPase activities were measured at 37 °C, pH 7.0, and motility was measured at 28 °C, pH 7.4.

The disease caused by both the DCM and HCM troponin T mutations is autosomal dominant, and it is likely that the cardiac thin filaments of affected individuals contain similar proportions of wild type and mutant troponin. Our previous work has shown that the effect on thin filament function of mixtures of wild type and mutant troponin is not directly predictable from the functional properties of the mutant troponin alone (24Redwood C.S. Lohmann K. Bing W. Esposito G.M. Elliott K. Abdulrazzak H. Knott A. Purcell I. Marston S.B. Watkins H. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1146-1152Google Scholar, 25Elliott K. Watkins H. Redwood C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22069-22074Google Scholar). Thin filaments were reconstituted using stoichiometric amounts (7:1:1, respectively) of actin, tropomyosin, and total troponin (either wild type, mutant, or 50:50 wild type mutant). Filaments containing an eqimolar mix of wild type and mutant gave activation relative to actin-tropomyosin at pCa4.5 that was similar to the level using 100% mutant complex and significantly less (p <0.001) than that obtained with wild type troponin (Fig.4 A). Similarly, in thein vitro motility assay the speed of sliding of a 50:50 mixture was close to that of 100% mutant (2.31 ± 0.04, 2.34 ± 0.06, 2.53 ± 0.01 μm/sec for 100% mutant, 50:50 mixture, and 100% wild type, respectively). In contrast, thin filaments reconstituted with an equimolar mix of wild type troponin T and R92Q mutant troponin T gave similar levels of activation and inhibition as 100% wild type (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, whereas 100% ΔLys-210 troponin T mutant gave an increase in Ca2+ sensitivity of ATPase activation of +0.23pCa units, the ΔLys-210/wild type mixture resulted in a significant decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity compared with wild type; ΔpCa50 = −0.27 (p <0.001;n = 4) (Fig. 4 A). The apparent Hill coefficient for the 50:50 mixture was intermediate between 100% wild type and 100% mutant and was significantly different from that obtained with wild type troponin alone (p <0.001). The same pattern of results was observed using in vitro motility assay: in thin filaments with a 50:50 mixture of wild type and ΔLys-210 troponin, the Ca2+ sensitivity of the fraction motile parameter was less than wild type by 0.07 pCa units (data not shown). Filaments containing an equimolar mix of wild type and R92Q troponin T produced an increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of regulation of ATPase activation that was intermediate between pure wild type and pure mutant filaments with no change in cooperativity (ΔpCa50 = +0.10 for 50:50 wild type/R92Q compared with ΔpCa50 = +0.18 for R92Q) (Fig.4 B). The deletion of lysine 210 in cardiac troponin T has been reported to be a cause of inherited dilated cardiomyopathy (6Kamisago M. Sharma S.D. DePalma S.R. Solomon S. Sharma P. McDonough B. Smoot L. Mullen M.P. Woolf P.K. Wigle E.D. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Jarcho J. Shapiro L.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 1688-1696Google Scholar). When human cardiac troponin T with this mutation was incorporated into reconstituted thin filaments, we found a pattern of functional changesin vitro that was distinctly different from the changes previously observed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations. The Ca2+-activated rate of actomyosin ATP hydrolysis and the thin filament sliding speed were reduced compared with wild type troponin, the Ca2+ activation curve became non-cooperative, and pCa50 was increased. It is particularly noteworthy that a 50:50 mixture of wild type and mutant troponin T, which is likely to reflect the situation in vivo, still reduced the maximally activated actomyosin ATPase and filament sliding speed to the same level as 100% mutant troponin T but gave Ca2+ sensitivity significantly lower than wild type. The deleted amino acid forms one of a stretch of four lysine residues in human cardiac troponin T (amino acids 207–210). These amino acids lie within the C-terminal chymotryptic T2 fragment known to bind tropomyosin, troponin C, and troponin I (17Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 575-602Google Scholar). Studies of peptides and deletions within this region have indicated that troponin I binds to heptad repeat sequences C-terminal to these four lysines (approximately residues 229–268) (30Stefancsik R. Jha P.K. Sarkar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 957-962Google Scholar), whereas both troponin C and tropomyosin may interact close to or directly with these residues (31Filatov V.L. Katrukha A.G. Bulargina T.V. Gusev N.B. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1999; 64: 969-985Google Scholar). The recently reported (32Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 170aGoogle Scholar) crystal structure of the T2 fragment in complex with troponins I and C shows that residue 210 forms part of a short α-helix N-terminal to the separate helix involved in a coiled coil interaction with troponin I that has no direct association with any other troponin subunit. The change in maximum sliding speed and ATPase is compatible with experiments that have shown that one function of troponin T is to determine the cross-bridge turnover rate (12Sweeney H.L. Feng H.S. Yang Z. Watkins H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14406-14410Google Scholar, 26Bing W. Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 335-340Google Scholar, 33Potter J.D. Sheng Z. Pan B.S. Zhao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2557-2562Google Scholar); the remarkable uncoupling of cooperative activation could be related to the role of troponin T in determining the size of the thin filament cooperative unit through its interaction with tropomyosin (34Geeves M.A. Lehrer S.S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 273-282Google Scholar, 35Schaertl S. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15890-15894Google Scholar). The recent report of a DCM mutation within the N-terminal T1 domain of troponin T, which only binds to tropomyosin (36Li D. Czernuszewicz G.Z. Gonzalez O. Tapscott T. Karibe A. Durand J.B. Brugada R. Hill R. Gregoritch J.M. Anderson J.L. Quinones M. Bachinski L.L. Roberts R. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2188-2193Google Scholar), and two mutations in tropomyosin itself (8Olson T.M. Kishimoto N.Y. Whitby F.G. Michels V.V. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2001; 33: 723-732Google Scholar) also suggest that alterations in tropomyosin-troponin T interactions may be responsible for the appearance of the DCM phenotype (reviewed in Ref. 16Marston S.B. Hodgkinson J.L. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 1-4Google Scholar). The decreased Ca2+ sensitivity observed with 50:50 wild type/ΔLys-210 mixtures was surprising given the significant increase in Ca2+ sensitivity obtained in experiments using 100% DCM mutant troponin T. This emphasizes our previous findings that the regulatory properties of a 50:50 wild type/mutant troponin mixture are often quite different from both wild type and mutant troponin in a way that could not be predicted from the functional properties of the mutant troponin alone (24Redwood C.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22069-22074Google Scholar, 29Burton D. Abdulrazzak H. Knott A. Elliott K. Redwood C. Watkins H. Marston S. Ashley C. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 443-451Google Scholar). The laboratory of Morimoto has recently reported a similar decreased Ca2+ sensitivity in rabbit heart trabeculae in which endogenous troponin was displaced upon incubation with human troponin T (either wild type or mutant) and human complex reconstituted in situ by the addition of human troponins I and C (37Morimoto S., Lu, Q.W. Harada K. Takahashi-Yanaga F. Minakami R. Ohta M. Sasaguri T. Ohtsuki I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 913-918Google Scholar). It appears that these treated trabeculae contained about 50% human mutant troponin T and 50% endogenous rabbit troponin T. Decreased Ca2+ sensitivity together with the decreased cross-bridge turnover rate and reduced cooperativity suggest that the expression and incorporation of this DCM troponin T mutantin vivo may result in myofilaments that are markedly less responsive to Ca2+, contract more slowly, and thus are unable to produce sufficient force during activation. Interestingly, the changes in contractility predicted to be caused by the DCM troponin T mutant closely resemble the alterations in myofilament regulation identified in end stage failing human hearts. Investigations using tissue from hearts affected by a number of aetiologies (including non-familial DCM) have shown a consistent pattern of reduced unloaded shortening speed and reduced myofibrillar ATPase activity (38Hajjar R.J. Grossman W. Gwathmey J.K. Basic. Res. Cardiol. 1992; 87 Suppl. 1: 143-159Google Scholar, 39Ruf T. Schulte-Baukloh H. Ludemann J. Posival H. Beyersdorf F. Just H. Holubarsch C. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 40: 580-590Google Scholar, 40de Tombe P.P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 37: 367-380Google Scholar). Reports are less clear over possible changes in Ca2+ sensitivity that has been suggested to be increased or unaltered; however, recent work suggests that additional factors such as sarcomere length and phosphate concentration are involved in determining which way the Ca2+ sensitivity will change (41Wolff M.R. Buck S.H. Stoker S.W. Greaser M.L. Mentzer R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 167-176Google Scholar, 42Hajjar R.J. Schwinger R.H. Schmidt U. Kim C.S. Lebeche D. Doye A.A. Gwathmey J.K. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1679-1685Google Scholar, 43van der Velden J. Klein L.J. Zaremba R. Boontje N.M. Huybregts M.A. Stooker W. Eijsman L. de Jong J.W. Visser C.A. Visser F.C. Stienen G.J. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1140-1146Google Scholar). The reduced unloaded shortening speed correlates with the reduced ATPase and sliding speed caused by the ΔLys-210 mutation in troponin T. The effects of the ΔLys-210 mutation also correlate with the altered properties of troponin extracted from failing hearts. Failing heart troponin was found to confer a slower maximum sliding speed and a higher Ca2+ sensitivity with reduced cooperativity (22Purcell I.F. Bing W. Marston S.B. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 884-891Google Scholar, 23Knott A. Purcell I.F. Marston S.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 469-482Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that a reduced maximum rate of cross-bridge turnover is a common causative feature of end stage heart failure, because a defect of this kind could not be fully compensated for by increasing Ca2+ sensitivity or modifying Ca2+ handling (44Perez N.G. Hashimoto K. McCune S. Altschuld R.A. Marban E. Circulation. 1999; 99: 1077-1083Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether these contractility changes in end stage failing hearts mediate the progress of heart failure or whether they are compensatory epiphenomena. However, the data presented here that show a troponin T mutant that is responsible for inherited DCM causing similar changes in contractility supports the notion that alterations to troponin may contribute directly to the progression of acquired forms of DCM. The functional alterations caused by the ΔLys-210 troponin T mutation are in many respects opposite from the data presented here for the R92Q HCM mutant and from our analyses of other HCM troponin T mutants (Ref. 24Redwood C.S. Lohmann K. Bing W. Esposito G.M. Elliott K. Abdulrazzak H. Knott A. Purcell I. Marston S.B. Watkins H. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1146-1152Google Scholar). 3P. Robinson, H. Watkins, and C. Redwood, unpublished data. Furthermore, this combination of properties is distinct from any other reported in vitro biochemical study on HCM troponin T mutants (21Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Google Scholar, 45Tobacman L.S. Lin D. Butters C. Landis C. Back N. Pavlov D. Homsher E. J. Biol.

Med. 2001; 11: 206-212Google Scholar), suggesting that the reduced maximal activation, depressed cooperativity, and, at an equimolar ratio with wild type troponin, diminished Ca2+ sensitivity may provide a specific stimulus for the production of the dilated, rather than hypertrophic, phenotype.

Our results are consistent with a model where cellulases can move on the surface of cellulose with a caterpillar-like displacement with free energy restrictions.

Our results are consistent with a model where cellulases can move on the surface of cellulose with a caterpillar-like displacement with free energy restrictions. The enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer on earth, is catalyzed by cellulases, which have considerable industrial and ecological importance. Most cellulases have a modular structure with a catalytic module and a cellulose-binding module (CBM) 1The abbreviations used are: CBM, cellulose-binding module; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; Cel45, H. insolens endoglucanase Cel45; R g, radius of gyration; Dmax, maximum dimension. usually joined by a glycosylated and presumably flexible linker peptide (1Gilkes N.R. Henrissat B. Kilburn D.G. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 303-315Google Scholar). Removal of the CBM results in a significantly reduced activity of the enzymes on crystalline cellulose probably because of a decreased binding capacity, but the activity on soluble cellulose oligomers is retained (2Gilkes N.R. Warren R.A. Miller Jr., R.C. Kilburn D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10401-10407Google Scholar, 3van Tilbeurgh H. Tomme P. Claeyssens M. Bhikhabhai R. Pettersson G.

Biochem. 1988; 170: 575-581Google Scholar). Inversely, isolated CBMs retain most of the binding capacity on crystalline cellulose but are devoid of catalytic action (3van Tilbeurgh H. Tomme P. Claeyssens M. Bhikhabhai R. Pettersson G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 223-227Google Scholar, 5Gilkes N.R. Jervis E. Henrissat B. Tekant B. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6743-6749Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity is sometimes affected when the interdomain linker has been shortened or completely deleted suggesting that it should be of sufficient length and/or flexibility to ensure an independent action of the two functional modules (6Shen H. Schmuck M. Pilz I. Gilkes N.R. Kilburn D.G. Miller R.C. Warren R.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11335-11340Google Scholar, 7Srisodsuk M. Reinikainen T. Penttila M. Teeri T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20756-20761Google Scholar). The catalytic modules of cellulases have been classified into several distinct families of glycoside hydrolases on the basis of amino acid sequence similarities (8Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Google Scholar, 9Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Google Scholar) while, similarly, the CBMs form several families (10Tomme P. Warren R.A.J. Miller R.C.J.

The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1999: 202-211Google Scholar). Structural data on individual cellulase modules have been accumulating over the last few years, with three-dimensional structures solved in nine families of catalytic modules and seven families of CBMs (12Bourne Y. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 593-600Google Scholar). There is no three-dimensional structure available for an intact cellulase whose catalytic module and CBM are separated by an interdomain linker longer than a dozen residues. The larger length, flexibility, and heterogenous glycosylation of fungal interdomain linkers are probably a major obstacle to protein crystallization. The only two domain cellulase known at the three-dimensional structural level is that of the bacterial endoglucanase E4 (Cel9A) of Thermobifida fusca (13Sakon J. Irwin D. Wilson D.B. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 810-818Google Scholar). However, in this particular protein, the interdomain linker is so short that the CBM is literally fused onto the catalytic module. So far, all the different experimental techniques used for structural elucidation failed to give precise information on the overall structure of full-length, multidomain cellulases bearing a long, glycosylated, and presumably flexible interdomain linker. At the end of 1980, Pilz and co-workers have reported pioneering studies using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), which provided the very first insight into the tertiary structure of two domain cellulases from Trichoderma reesei (14Abuja P.M. Schmuck M. Pilz I. Tomme P. Claeyssens M. Esterbauer H. Eur. Biophys. J. 1988; 15: 339-342Google Scholar, 15Abuja P.M. Pilz I. Claeyssens M. Tomme P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 180-185Google Scholar) and from Cellulomonas fimi (6Shen H. Schmuck M. Pilz I. Gilkes N.R. Kilburn D.G. Miller R.C. Warren R.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11335-11340Google Scholar, 16Pilz I. Schwarz E. Kilburn D.G. Miller R.C. Warren R.A.J. Gilkes N.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 277-280Google Scholar, 17Meinke A. Schmuck M. Gilkes N.R. Kilburn D.G. Miller R.C. Warren R.A.J. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 321-326Google Scholar). However, these early results were necessarily imperfect because of the lack of known three-dimensional structure for the isolated cellulase modules and the equipment available then. The data collected on conventional sources in the 1980s were undermined by relatively poor statistics, despite the huge amounts of protein used for the experiments (several hundred milligrams for one set of experiment). Besides, the high protein concentrations used may have distorted the signal (18Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Google Scholar, 19Receveur V. Durand D. Desmadril M. Calmettes P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 57-61Google Scholar). Since then, only the works of Boisset et al. (20Boisset C. Borsali R. Schülein M. Henrissat B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 49-52Google Scholar) have combined the structural information now available on isolated modules with dynamic light scattering experiments to establish a more precise estimate of the hydrodynamic dimensions of a full-length cellulase. However, it is difficult to obtain precise structural information on proteins from dynamic light scattering data as only rough models based on geometrical shape can be used. Moreover the choice of a model requires relying on preliminary assumptions. By contrast, SAXS is a method of choice to determine the average shape of a protein because it enables the direct measurement of the dimensions of a macromolecule in solution and the calculation of its envelope ab initio, without any starting hypothesis. Here, we report the first ab initio characterization of the two domain structure of cellulase Cel45 from the fungus Humicola insolens and of several of its variants by SAXS in order to shed light on the shape, dimension, and conformation of this modular protein. Cel45 has a catalytic module belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 45 carrying a CBM of family 1 via a 36 amino acid long linker peptide (21Schülein M. Tikhomirov D. Schou C. Suominen P. Reinikainen T. Trichoderma reesei cellulases and other hydrolases. 8. Foundation for Biotechnical and Industrial Fermentation Research, Espoo1993: 109-116Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the catalytic module has been determined (22Davies G.J. Dodson G.G. Hubbard R.E. Tolley S.P. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Hjort C. Mikkelsen J.M. Rasmussen G. Schülein M. Nature. 1993; 365: 362-364Google Scholar) and that of the CBM could be directly modeled from its 50% sequence identity to cellobiohydrolase I (Cel7A) from Trichoderma reesei, whose three-dimensional structure was solved by NMR (23Kraulis P.M. Clore M.G. Nilges M. Jones T.A. Pettersson G. Knowles J. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7241-7257Google Scholar). H. insolens Cel45 full-length and its isolated catalytic module (Cel45 core) were cloned and expressed in Aspergillus oryzae (24Rasmussen, G., Mikkelsen, J. M., Schülein, M., Patkar, S. A., Hagen, F., Hjort, C. M. & Hastrup, S. (1991) inWorld Patent WO 91 17, 243.Google Scholar) and purified as already described (20Boisset C. Borsali R. Schülein M. Henrissat B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 49-52Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was done using the PCR method. The expression plasmids harboring the mutated genes were transformed into A. oryzae using selection on acetamide by cotransformation using the AMDs selection as already described (25Christensen O.T. Wøldike H. Boel E. Mortensen S.B. Hjortshoej K. Thim L. Hansen M. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1419-1422Google Scholar). A variant comprising only the catalytic module and the linker (variant Cel45ΔCBM) was obtained by introducing a stop codon on the Cel45-encoding gene at a position corresponding to amino acid 247. Another variant featuring a stretch of five consecutive proline residues in the interdomain linker (variant Cel45 PP) was obtained by changing the codons for Val-240 and Gln-241 to codons for prolines. Finally, a variant having a half-size linker (variant Cel45 ΔS219-T235) was obtained by deletion of the region coding from Ser-219 to Thr-235. Variants Cel45 ΔS219-T235 and Cel45 PP, which bear a CBM, were purified using Avicel affinity as described earlier (20Boisset C. Borsali R. Schülein M. Henrissat B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 49-52Google Scholar). Variant Cel45ΔCBM was purified using ion-exchange chromatography as described for the catalytic module (Cel45 core) (20Boisset C. Borsali R. Schülein M. Henrissat B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 49-52Google Scholar). The lyophilized proteins were diluted in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 and then washed extensively through a microconcentrator equipped with a Filtron® polyvinylidene membrane in order to remove contaminating salts. Finally, each protein sample was filtered through a Rainin Microfilterfuge membrane (100,000 molecular weight cut-off) in order to eliminate nonspecific aggregates from the solution, and the filtrate was used for the SAXS experiments. The protein concentration of each sample was checked by absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficients calculated from the amino acid composition of each protein. Glycerol (1 and 10%, v/v), was added to the buffer as a radiation scavenger for SAXS experiments performed at LURE and ESRF respectively. SAXS experiments were carried out on the D24 instrument installed on the bending magnet of the storage ring LURE-DCI (Orsay, France) and on beamline ID2 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). On D24, the wavelength λ was 1.488 Å and the sample-to-detector distances were 1.32 m and 2.08 m. The vertical linear-sensitive position detector was shifted upwards with respect to the incident beam so that the scattered intensity for higher scattering angles could be measured. This setup gave access to scattering vectors q ranging from 0.015 to 0.35 Å−1 and 0.009 to 0.22 Å−1respectively. The scattering vector is defined as q = 4π/λ sinθ, where 2θ is the scattering angle. Eight to sixteen frames of 200 s were recorded depending on the protein concentration. The protein solution was continuously circulated through the evacuated quartz capillary so that no radiation-induced damage was observable. On ID2, the wavelength was 1.0 Å and the sample-to-detector distance was 3.0 m, leading to scattering vectors q ranging from 0.01 to 0.022 Å−1. The detector was a x-ray intensified optically coupled CCD camera, and 100 successive frames of 1 s with 5 s pause between each frame were recorded for each sample. A stopped-flow equipment (Bio-Logic, Claix, France) was used to mix the protein and the buffer solution at a chosen concentration, and a new solution was injected before each frame into a home-built observation cuvette made from a 1.5-mm Lindemann-type quartz capillary. Thus, no protein solution was irradiated longer than 1 s. Each frame was then carefully inspected to check for possible bubble formation or radiation-induced aggregation. No such effect was observed, and individual frames could then be averaged. Absolute calibration was made with a Lupolen sample. A series of measurements at different protein concentrations ranging from 1 to 11 mg/ml were performed for each protein to check for interparticle interaction. Background scattering was measured before or after each protein sample using the corresponding buffer solution and then subtracted from the protein scattering patterns after proper normalization and correction from detector response. All the experiments were conducted at 20 °C. The values of radii of gyration (R g) were derived from the Guinier approximation (26Guinier A. Fournet F. Small angle scattering of X-rays. Wiley Interscience, New York1955Google Scholar): I(q) = I(0) exp(−q 2 R g2/3),where I(q) is the scattered intensity andI(0) is the forward scattered intensity. The radius of gyration and I(0) are inferred respectively from the slope and the intercept of the linear fit of ln[I(q)] versus q2 at low q values. The distance distribution function P(r) indicates the distribution of the interatomic vectors of a molecule with a given length. This enables an alternative calculation ofR g using the entire scattering curve (R g is estimated from the second moment of theP(r) function). The function also provides the maximum dimension Dmax of the molecule, which is defined as the point where P(r) becomes zero. Distance distribution functions were calculated by the Fourier inversion of the scattering intensity I(q) using GNOM (27Svergun D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Google Scholar). A range of Dmax was tested, and the final choice of Dmax was based on three criteria:P(r) should exhibit positive values, theR g value from GNOM should agree with that from the Guinier analyses, and the P(r) curve should remain stable when increasing Dmax beyond the estimated macromolecular length. Calculations of the theoretical scattering functions based on crystal structures were performed using CRYSOL (28Svergun D. Baraberato C. Koch M.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Google Scholar). They were fitted to the experimental data in the case of the isolated catalytic module by taking into account the excluded volume and the scattering by a hydration shell having a slightly different density than the bulk solvent. The structural model for Cel45 core was PDB file with ID code2eng. The coordinates for the CBM were calculated by homology modeling with SwissModel (29Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Google Scholar) using the coordinates of the CBM from T. reesei cellobiohydrolase (PDB ID code: 1cbh) (23Kraulis P.M. Clore M.G. Nilges M. Jones T.A. Pettersson G. Knowles J. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7241-7257Google Scholar). The low-resolution shapes of Cel45 variants and wild type were determined ab initio from the scattering curves using the programs DAMMIN (30Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Google Scholar) and GASBOR (31Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Google Scholar). These two programs restore low-resolution shapes of protein and calculate a volume filled with densely packed spheres (dummy atoms or dummy residues, respectively) fitting the experimental scattering curve by a simulated annealing minimization procedure. Dammin minimizes the interfacial area between the molecule and the solvent by imposing compactness and connectivity constraints and can fit the scattering curve up to a resolution of 20 Å. It automatically subtracts a constant from the scattering profile in order to force it to follow the Porod Law (32Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar) as the surface between the particle and the solvent should be well defined. Gasbor calculates a three-dimensional model from the entire scattering pattern considering the protein as an assembly of dummy residues centered on the Cα positions (spheres of 3.8 Å diameter) with a nearest-neighbor distribution constraint. This provides more reliable and higher resolution models than DAMMIN if the experimental data are of sufficient quality. In our case, the cellulases are heavily O-glycosylated in the linker region. To take into account this glycosylation we have considered, for Gasbor, that a sugar residue is equivalent to ∼1.6 amino acid residues according to its electronic density and its length. We have then calculated the total number of real and equivalent amino acid residues of the cellulase knowing its primary structure and the average number of glycosides contained in the protein given by mass spectrometry measurements. We used this global number of residues for the protein in the input of the GASBOR program. In every case, several independent fits were run with DAMMIN (spheres of diameters 6, 5, and 4 Å) and GASBOR with no symmetry restriction, and the stability of the solution was checked. The isolated modules were then positioned in the envelope with respect to each other using TURBO-FRODO (33Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, California1989: 77-78Google Scholar). Intact two-domain Cel45 as well as its isolated catalytic module and three different variants altered in the interdomain linker have been studied by SAXS in order to estimate the influence of the linker on the global conformation of this cellulase. In variant Cel45 PP, two amino acids of the wild-type linker were replaced by two prolines resulting in a subsequence of five consecutive proline residues. This short sequence, which adopts a single preferred conformation in solution known as a polyproline II helix (34Kelly M.A. Chellgren B.W. Rucker A.L. Troutman J.M. Fried M.G. Miller A.F. Creamer T.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14376-14383Google Scholar), was devised in order to increase the rigidity of the linker. In variant Cel45 ΔS219-T235, the catalytic module and the CBM are joined together by a linker 17 amino acids shorter than the wild-type linker. Finally, in variant Cel45ΔCBM, the CBM has been removed resulting in a protein comprising only the catalytic module and the full-length linker peptide. The molecular weight of Cel45 and its variants has been estimated by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. 2Martin Schülein, unpublished data. Broad peaks were observed for all samples except for the isolated catalytic core due to the heterogeneous O-glycosylation of the linker. A comparison of the average molecular weight observed for each protein with that calculated from the amino acid composition gave an estimate of the overall glycosylation content of the linker: ∼ 40 sugar units for Cel45, Cel45 PP, and Cel45ΔCBM and ∼16 sugar units for variant Cel45 ΔS219-T235. This approximates to an average of about 1.7 sugars per Ser or Thr residue in the linker. The obvious glycosylation heterogeneity is likely to be accompanied by heterogeneity of conformations in solution. The average size of Cel45 and its variants was estimated by the measure of their radii of gyration. Fig.1 shows the experimental SAXS profiles in Guinier plots for all studied proteins. The scattered intensities follow closely the Guinier law in the small-q region and no sign of aggregation can be observed. The Guinier approximation is often used in the q-range corresponding toq.R g ≤ 1.3. Because the proteins studied here are probably not spherical and present a distribution of conformations, the Guinier approximation was therefore considered to be valid only up to q.R g ≤1. No concentration effect was detected, except for Cel45 PP, for whichR g was extrapolated to infinite dilution. The radii of gyration of Cel45 and of its variants are reported in TableI. The values of radii of gyration obtained for the proteins bearing a linker are much higher than what would be expected for a spherical protein with the same number of amino acids (35Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Google Scholar). This is particularly evident when one compares the radii of gyration of the isolated catalytic module (17.3 Å, 210 amino acids) with variant Cel45ΔCBM, which consists of the catalytic module and the linker only. The latter exhibits an R g of 30.0 Å although it is larger than the former by only 36 amino acids and about 40 sugar units. By contrast, the CBM (38 amino acids) does not contribute much to the average size of the protein since the intact Cel45 displays an R g of 33.6 ± 0.4 Å. Interestingly, the radius of gyration of variant Cel45 PP (R g = 35.5 ± 0.5 Å) is slightly but significantly larger than that of wild-type Cel45, indicating a substantial difference in their average size for the two proteins even though their primary structures differ only by two amino acids.Table ISize and dimensions of Cel45 WT and variantsProteinMwR gDmaxkDaÅÅCel45 WT3633.6 ± 0.4125 ± 5Cel45 core22.917.3 ± 0.345 ± 5Cel45 ΔCBM3230.0 ± 0.4100 ± 10Cel45 ΔS219-T2353123.1 ± 0.595 ± 10Cel45 PP3735.5 ± 0.6122 ± 4Cel45 CBM4aCalculated from the sequence.9.2bCalculated from the three-dimensional model.31bCalculated from the three-dimensional model.a Calculated from the sequence.b Calculated from the three-dimensional model. Open table in a new tab Distance distribution functions were deduced from the scattering intensities of Cel45 and its variants. The experimental P(r) curves and the theoretical P(r) of the CBM calculated from its atomic coordinates are presented in Fig.2. The distance distribution function of the isolated catalytic module has a bell-shape, which is characteristic of a globular protein. The experimental profile corresponds exactly to the theoretical one calculated from the crystal structure coordinates with a maximum dimension of 45 ± 5 Å. The P(r) profiles of full length Cel45 and of its variants display a biphasic pattern, clearly indicative of an elongated shape according also to the large maximum dimension obtained: 125 ± 5 Å for full-length Cel45, 122 ± 4 Å for variant Cel45 PP, 100 ± 10 Å for variant Cel45ΔCBM, and 95 ± 10 Å for variant Cel45 ΔS219-T235. This is consistent with the high values of radii of gyration measured for these molecules with respect to their molecular mass. The first peak is representative of the short intramolecular distances, mainly within the catalytic module, as evident from the superimposition on the catalytic moduleP(r) profile. The broadening to the right of the first peak indicates that there are larger distances within the parts of the cellulase other than the catalytic module or the CBM. This suggests that the linker region is rather extended. The second part of the curve characterizes interdomain distances. This second broad peak corresponds to the distances between the catalytic module and the linker region containing the peptide chain and the carbohydrate residues, as confirmed by the distance distribution function of Cel45ΔCBM. The last extension of the curve observed in wild-type Cel45 and in its CBM-containing variants corresponds to the distances between the CBM and the catalytic module and indicates that they sit at opposite ends of the molecule. The Dmax inferred from all these curves are reported in Table I. The P(r) curves of Cel45 WT and of variant Cel45 ΔS219-T235 (Fig. 2 b) have a similar pattern and differ only by the extent of the second peak. On the contrary, the wingspan of Cel45 WT and variant Cel45 PP are identical, but theP(r) profiles are not the same. These differences on the intermediate distances suggest either that the orientation of the two main modules with respect to each other is dissimilar in the two proteins (36Glatter O. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982: 167-196Google Scholar), or that the two proteins display specific chain conformations in the hinge region. Ab initio three-dimensional envelopes of Cel45 and its variants have been determined using the program packages DAMMIN and GASBOR. DAMMIN is particularly appropriate for objects displaying a sharp interface with the solvent and which follow the Porod law. However, the surface of a cellulase is not very well defined because of the loose compactness of the linker peptide and of the glycoside side chains. Indeed this group of molecules probably does not follow the Porod law. Therefore, we also used GASBOR even though this program is intended primarily for higher resolution data. Repeated fits were computed independently with the two programs. In fact, due to the intrinsic limitations of the scattering technique on solution samples, ab initio three-dimensional shape restoration from one-dimensional scattering profiles can unavoidably lead to incorrect structures fitting the data even so. Thus, repetitions of the fit, even if it cannot totally prevent it, significantly decrease the risk of inferring an erroneous structure. The results obtained with both programs were superimposed using SUPCOMB (37Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 34: 33-41Google Scholar). This showed that the calculated envelopes are nearly identical for each protein whatever the program used. The best models provided a fit to the experimental data with χ = 2.3 for Cel45 PP, 2.1 for Cel45 ΔS219-T235, and 0.97 for Cel45 WT. The fits and the resulting shapes are presented in Fig. 3. The ab initio shapes reveal elongated particles, with a globular spherical part and a more or less long and thick protuberance. The prominence is rather cylindrical in the Cel45 ΔS219-T235 variant, whereas its cross-section diameter varies in the Cel45 PP variant with tight and swollen regions in the middle part. This outgrowth is linear in Cel45 ΔS219-T235 variant, exhibits a bend in Cel45 PP variant, and several bends in different orientations in Cel45 WT. These geometries are perfectly reproducible from one fit to another with GASBOR and DAMMIN for the two variants, while there are some minor differences in the bending of the linker in the models obtained for Cel45 WT. TheP(r) profiles of Cel45 core, Cel45ΔCBM, and full-length Cel45 allowed us to position the isolated modules in these envelopes at opposite ends of the elongated shape. The central part of the envelope therefore represents the glycosylated linker peptide. The SAXS experiments on cellulase Cel45 and variants reported here enabled us to determine the global structural characteristics of a full-length cellulase and to obtain the first ab initio shape of a two domain cellulase. Our results considerably improve the first models of cellulases that Pilz and co-workers (14Abuja P.M. Schmuck M. Pilz I. Tomme P. Claeyssens M. Esterbauer H. Eur. Biophys. J. 1988; 15: 339-342Google Scholar, 15Abuja P.M. Pilz I. Claeyssens M. Tomme P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 180-185Google Scholar, 16Pilz I. Schwarz E. Kilburn D.G. Miller R.C. Warren R.A.J. Gilkes N.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 277-280Google Scholar) derived at a time when the composition and structure of individual modules were not known. Here we show that the shape of cellulase Cel45 is indeed similar to a tadpole. However the dimensions of the linker peptide inferred from our experiments are considerably more accurate and consistent with the number of residues in the linker. As a matter of fact the maximum dimensions obtained for CBHI and CBHII"

https://openalex.org/W2123537068,"We previously described two nuclear cofactors, TRRAP and TIP49, that have functional roles in Myc-mediated oncogenesis. We have now expanded the analysis of these Myc-associated cofactors to investigate their roles in apoptosis and cell proliferation. Although TRRAP and TIP49 are both essential for transformation, TIP49 modulates c-Myc-mediated apoptosis whereas disruption of TRRAP activity has no apparent effect on apoptosis. We extended our analysis of TIP49 to show that it also binds to the E2F1 transactivation domain and modulates both transforming and apoptotic activities. These results indicate that individual cofactors differentially potentiate c-Myc and E2F1 functions."
https://openalex.org/W2073711680,"JSAP1 (also termed JIP3) is a scaffold protein that interacts with specific components of the JNK signaling pathway. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK) 1 is a MAP kinase kinase kinase that activates the JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades in response to environmental stresses such as reactive oxygen species. Here we show that JSAP1 bound ASK1 and enhanced ASK1- and H2O2-induced JNK activity. ASK1 phosphorylated JSAP1 in vitro and in vivo, and the phosphorylation facilitated interactions of JSAP1 with SEK1/MKK4, MKK7 and JNK3. Furthermore, ASK1-dependent phosphorylation was required for JSAP1 to recruit and thereby activate JNK in response to H2O2. We thus conclude that JSAP1 functions not only as a simple scaffold, but it dynamically participates in signal transduction by forming a phosphorylation-dependent signaling complex in the ASK1-JNK signaling module.

The MAPK signal transduction cascade (MAPKKK-MAPKK-MAPK) is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans and plays pivotal roles in many cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. In mammalian cells, at least three MAPKs have been identified: the ERKs, the JNKs and the p38s. JNK and p38 are preferentially activated by proinflammatory cytokines and environmental stresses (1Ichijo H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Google Scholar). Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK) 1 is a member of the MAPKKK group that activates SEK1 (also termed MKK4)/MKK7-JNK and MKK3/MKK6-p38 signaling cascades (1Ichijo H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Google Scholar). Overexpression of ASK1 induces apoptosis in various cells through mitochondria-dependent caspase activation (3Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Google Scholar, 4Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26576-26581Google Scholar). We have shown by deleting ASK1 in mice that tumor necrosis factor- and oxidative stress-induced sustained activation of JNK/p38 and apoptosis are lost inASK1−/− cells (6Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Google Scholar). In addition, ASK1 was recently shown to be required for endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis (7Nishitoh N. Matsuzawa A. Tobiume K. Saegusa K. Takeda K. Inoue K. Hori S. Kakizuka A. Ichijo H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1345-1355Google Scholar). These observations indicate that ASK1 plays an essential role in stress- and cytokine-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, ASK1 may also regulate cell differentiation; low and high expression of exogenous ASK1 in certain cells induced differentiation and apoptosis, respectively (8Takeda K. Hatai T. Hamazaki T.S. Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9805-9813Google Scholar, 9Sayama K. Hanakawa Y. Shirakata Y. Yamasaki K. Sawada Y. Sun L. Yamanishi K. Ichijo H. Hashimoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 999-1004Google Scholar). These results suggest that ASK1 has a broad range of biological activities depending on cell types, cellular context, or the extent of ASK1 activation. The maintenance of signaling specificity, efficiency, and integrity in the MAPK cascades appear to be accomplished by specific molecular interactions among kinases, substrates, and scaffold proteins (10Weston C.R. Davis R.J. Science. 2001; 292: 2439-2440Google Scholar). Studies in yeast have established that the components of mating MAPK pathway interact with the scaffold protein Ste5p that is essential for the mating signal (11Mahanty S.K. Wang Y. Farley F.W. Elion E.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 501-512Google Scholar). Recent studies of the JNK signal transduction pathway have identified many types of potential scaffold proteins, which include CrkII, Filamin, β-arrestin, JNK-interacting proteins (JIPs), and JNK/stress-activated protein kinase-associated protein 1 (JSAP1) (10Weston C.R. Davis R.J. Science. 2001; 292: 2439-2440Google Scholar). CrkII has been demonstrated to bind SEK1 and JNK through SH3 domain and represents a scaffold protein in the Rac1-mediated JNK signaling pathway (12Girardin S.E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3437-3446Google Scholar). Filamin also binds to SEK1 and TRAF2 and appears to be a putative scaffold protein in the tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway (13Marti A. Luo Z. Cunningham C. Ohta Y. Hartwig J. Stossel T.P. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2620-2628Google Scholar, 14Leonardi A. Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Franzoso G. Brown K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 271-278Google Scholar). In contrast, a MAPK phosphatase termed SKRP1 was recently shown to interact with ASK1 and MKK7 but not with SEK1 and to enhance ASK1-MKK7 axis (15Zama T. Aoki R. Kamimoto T. Inoue K. Ikeda Y. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23919-23926Google Scholar). The arrestin family proteins bind to G-protein-coupled receptors and function as signaling molecules of ligand-activated G-protein-coupled receptors (16Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Google Scholar). β-Arrestin 2 has recently been shown to interact with JNK3, ASK1, and indirectly with SEK1 and thereby facilitate JNK3 activation in response to angiotensin II (17McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Google Scholar). The JIP group proteins such as JIP1 (also known as IB1) and JIP2 have been demonstrated to function as scaffold proteins in JNK signaling cascades (10Weston C.R. Davis R.J. Science. 2001; 292: 2439-2440Google Scholar). JIP1 and JIP2 bind to JNK, MKK7, and a MAPKKK termed mixed-lineage protein kinases (MLKs) (18Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z.

A genetic evidence for the critical role of JIP1 in JNK signals has recently been provided by deleting JIP1 in mice in which excitotoxic stress-induced JNK activation and apoptosis were suppressed (23Whitmarsh A.J. Kuan C.Y. Kennedy N.J. Kelkar N. Haydar T.F. Mordes J.P. Appel M. Rossini A.A. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Rakic P. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2421-2432Google Scholar). Another scaffold protein in the JNK cascades, JSAP1 (also known as JIP3), has been identified by the yeast two-hybrid screening using JNK3 as a bait (24Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Google Scholar, 25Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Google Scholar). JSAP1/JIP3 is structurally unrelated to JIP1 or JIP2 and has at least four spliced isoforms (25Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Google Scholar, 26Ito M. Akechi M. Hirose R. Ichimura M. Takamatsu N., Xu, P. Nakabeppu Y. Tadayoshi S. Yamamoto K. Yoshioka K. Gene. 2000; 255: 229-234Google Scholar). Although biochemical studies of JSAP1 have yielded several conflicting results, JSAP1 appears to interact with JNKs, SEK1, MKK7, full-length MEKK1, MLK2, and MLK3 in transfected cells (24Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Google Scholar, 25Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of JSAP1, called UNC-16, interacts genetically and physically with JNK-1 and JKK-1 that have the highest sequence similarity to mammalian JNK3 and MKK7, respectively (27Byrd D.T. Kawasaki M. Walcoff M. Hisamoto N. Matsumoto K. Jin Y. Neuron. 2001; 32: 787-800Google Scholar). JSAP1 thus serves as a functional scaffold that may be required for appropriate signaling of JNK. It was also shown that JSAP1 is phosphorylated in vivo (25Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Google Scholar); however, the role of phosphorylation of JSAP1 has not been elucidated. Moreover, little is known in general about the functional significance of posttranslational modification of scaffold proteins. In the present study, we have investigated the role of JSAP1 in the ASK1-JNK signaling pathway. Endogenous JSAP1 was found to bind ASK1 in PC12 cells, and exogenous JSAP1 enhanced ASK1- and H2O2-induced JNK3 activation. Interestingly, ASK1 phosphorylated JSAP1 in vitro and in vivo, and phosphorylated JSAP1 recruited SEK1, MKK7, and JNK3 into the JSAP1-ASK1 signaling complex. Moreover, phosphorylation of JSAP1 by ASK1 was found to be required for the enhancement of JNK activation by JSAP1. We demonstrate for the first time that stimulation-dependent phosphorylation of JSAP1 facilitates formation of a functional JNK signaling module. This may represent a novel mode of regulation of the MAPK signal transduction cascades. Rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 and human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 cells were maintained as described (8Takeda K. Hatai T. Hamazaki T.S. Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. J. Biol.

HA-p38α, Flag-p38α, HA-ERK1, Flag-ERK1, HA-SEK1, HA-MKK7γ2, were constructed in pcDNA3. Mutations were introduced to replace amino acids serine 287, threonine 291, and serine 293 with glutamic acid in pcDNA3-HA-MKK7EEE and with alanine in pcDNA3-HA-MKK7AAA. Mutations were also introduced to replace threonine 221 with alanine and tyrosine 223 with phenylalanine in pcDNA3-HA-JNK3APF and the ATP-binding lysine 93 and 94 with arginine in pcDNA3-HA-JNK3KR. Five copies of the Myc tag were inserted at the N terminus of JSAP1 (Myc-JSAP1) in pcDNA3. Transfection was performed with FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against active ASK1 (phospho-ASK1) was recently described (31Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 1091-1099Google Scholar). Antisera to ASK1 (28Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Google Scholar) and JSAP1 (32Kuboki Y. Ito M. Takamatsu N. Yamamoto K.I. Shiba T. Yoshioka K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39815-39818Google Scholar) have been described. Immunoblotting analysis has been performed as previously described (6Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Google Scholar). Blots were probed with antibodies to phospho-ERK, phospho-JNK, phospho-p38, ERK (Cell Signaling), JNK, p38 (Santa Cruz), phospho-ASK1, and JSAP1. For endogenous co-immunoprecipitation analysis, 1 × 107 of PC12 cells were lysed in the lysis buffer containing 150 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 12 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.5% aprotinin. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with control rabbit, anti-ASK1, or anti-JSAP1 antisera using protein G-Sepharose. The beads were washed twice with the washing buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm EGTA separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and immunoblotted with antibody to ASK1 or JSAP1. The amount of ASK1 and JSAP1 proteins was quantified by densitometric analysis (Quantity One program; PDI, Inc.). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis using transfected HEK293 cells has been described (28Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Google Scholar). The immune complexes were incubated with or without protein phosphatase 1 (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30 °C and washed with washing buffer (28Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Google Scholar). Phosphatase reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the expression vectors using FuGENE6. After 20 h, cells were lysed with the lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-HA antibody (12CA5; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For JNK3 kinase assay, PC12 cells were stimulated with 0.4 mm H2O2 for 60 min. Cells were lysed with the lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK3 antibody (Transduction Lab.). JNK and p38 kinase assays were done by using GST-cJun(1–79) and GST-ATF2 as substrates, respectively (28Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of GST-cJun and GST-ATF2 was analyzed by image analyzer Fuji BAS2000. The amount of JNK and p38 protein were determined by immunoblotting with rat anti-HA antibody (3F10; Roche) or anti-JNK3 antibody, and quantified by densitometric analysis (Quantity One program; PDI, Inc.). GST constructs for JSAP1 (GST-JSAP1, GST-JSAP1(1–744), GST-JSAP1(744–1305)), the N terminus-deleted ASK1 (GST-ASK1ΔN), the N terminus-deleted kinase-negative ASK1 (GST-ASK1ΔN-KR), and kinase-negative MKK6 (MKK6KN) were prepared in pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads as described (30Morita K. Saitoh M. Tobiume K. Matsuura H. Enomoto S. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6028-6036Google Scholar). GST-ASK1ΔN and GST-ASK1ΔN-KR were eluted with a buffer containing 10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 25 mm MgCl2. The beads fused with 0.1 μg of GST-JSAP1 or GST-MKK6KN were incubated with or without 0.1 μg of GST-ASK1ΔN or GST-ASK1ΔN-KR in the presence of 0.3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. Kinase reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer. Phosphorylation of GST-JSAP1 and GST-MKK6KN was analyzed by image analyzer. The amount of GST fusion proteins was determined by immunoblotting with antibody to GST (Santa Cruz). HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-Myc-JSAP1 and HA-ASK1. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were washed and incubated with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum containing 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed with the lysis buffer, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody (9E10). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Phosphorylation of JSAP1 was analyzed by an image analyzer. The amount of Myc-JSAP1 was determined by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody and quantified as described above. For MEF cells, recombinant adenoviruses encoding β-galactosidase (Ad-β-gal) and Myc-JSAP1 (Ad-Myc-JSAP1) were constructed as described (4Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Google Scholar). Sixteen h after infection with Ad-Myc-JSAP1, MEFs were washed and incubated with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum containing 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h at 37 °C. Phosphorylation of JSAP1 was determined as described above. Bacterially expressed GST-JSAP1(1–744) and GST-JSAP1(744–1305) proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were mixed with HEK293 cell lysates overexpressing ASK1 or JNK3, rotated 2 h at 4 °C, spun, and washed with washing buffer. The beads were analyzed by immunoblotting. To investigate the potential roles of JSAP1 in the ASK1 signaling pathway, we first examined whether JSAP1 physically interacts with ASK1 in transfected cells (Fig.1, A and B). Myc-tagged JSAP1 was coimmunoprecipitated with differentially tagged ASK1 (FLAG-ASK1 and HA-ASK1) in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1, A andB, lane 2), but not with p38 (Fig. 1 A,lane 3 and Fig. 1 B, lane 4) or ERK (Fig. 1 A, lane 4 and Fig. 1 B,lane 6). These results strongly suggested that JSAP1 and ASK1 can form a complex in vivo. Although many components in the JNK signaling module such as JNK, SEK1, MKK7, full-length MEKK1, MLK2, and MLK3 have been shown to associate with JSAP1 by overexpression (24Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Google Scholar, 25Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Google Scholar), their endogenous interactions have not been reported. To examine whether JSAP1 interacts with ASK1 in untransfected cells, lysates from PC12 cells were immunoprecipitated with nonimmune, anti-ASK1 or anti-JSAP1 antisera, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-JSAP1 and anti-ASK1 (Fig.1 C). Endogenous JSAP1 was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous ASK1 (Fig. 1 C, lane 2; endogenous ASK1 represented by a doublet as previously reported (28Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Google Scholar)) and vice versa (Fig. 1 C, lane 3). Quantification of coimmunoprecipitated proteins indicated that ∼7–10% of endogenous JSAP1 and ASK1 exists as a complex, suggesting that certain portion but not all of JSAP1 and ASK1 proteins forms a signaling complex under physiological conditions. JSAP1 has been known to bind JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3 but not p38 or ERK (Refs. 24Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Google Scholar, 25Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Google Scholar, and Fig. 1, A and B). JSAP1 was also shown to enhance MEKK1- and MLK3-induced activation of JNKs (24Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Google Scholar, 25Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Google Scholar). JSAP1 and JNK3 are both expressed exclusively in the brain (33Yang D.D. Kuan C.Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Google Scholar), and JSAP1 has higher affinity to JNK3 than to other JNK isoforms (24Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Google Scholar, 25Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Google Scholar). We thus examined whether JSAP1 affects ASK1-induced JNK3 and p38 activations. HA-tagged JNK3 (HA-JNK3) or p38α (HA-p38) were cotransfected with or without FLAG-tagged ASK1 (FLAG-ASK1) and Myc-tagged JSAP1 (Myc-JSAP1) in HEK293 cells, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. The immune complexes were subjected to in vitro kinase assays using GST-cJun or GST-ATF2 as specific substrates for JNK3 and p38, respectively. JSAP1 had little effect on the basal activity of JNK3 (Fig. 1 D,lane 3). ASK1-induced JNK3 activation (Fig. 1 D,lanes 5 and 6) but not p38 activation (Fig.1 E, lanes 5 and 6) was markedly enhanced by JSAP1 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that JSAP1 may serve as a scaffold protein in the ASK1-JNK3 signaling cascade. ASK1 is activated by H2O2 and specifically required for H2O2-induced sustained activation of JNK (6Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Google Scholar). If JSAP1 potentiates ASK1-JNK module as a scaffold, we would expect the expression of JSAP1 to increase the activation of JNK caused by an ASK1-specific stimulus, H2O2. Adenovirus-mediated expression of JSAP1 (Ad-Myc-JSAP1), but not control β-galactosidase (Ad-β-gal), enhanced activation of endogenous JNKs (Fig. 1 F, third panel), especially JNK3 (Fig. 1 F, top panel) in PC12 cells. In contrast, JSAP1 did not potentiate p38 or ERK activation by H2O2 (Fig. 1 F). Importantly, exogenous JSAP1 had no effect on the activity of endogenous ASK1 itself as determined by anti-phospho-ASK1 immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 1 F, fifth panel from top). These results suggest that JSAP1 functions as a molecular scaffold that specifically facilitates H2O2-induced and thus ASK1-induced JNK3 activation. Although the mechanism was unknown, activation of the components of the JNK signaling pathway has been reported to associate with increased formation of JSAP1 complexes with SEK1 and JNK (24Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Google Scholar, 25Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Google Scholar). To examine whether enhancement of ASK1-induced JNK3 activation by JSAP1 may involve increased formation of JSAP1 complexes with the downstream components, we investigated the effect of ASK1 on JSAP1 binding to SEK1, MKK7, and JNK3. HA-SEK1, HA-MKK7, or HA-JNK3 was transiently cotransfected with Myc-JSAP1 in HEK293 cells with or without wild-type (WT) and kinase-inactive (KM) forms of ASK1. In the absence of transfected ASK1, JSAP1 was confirmed to associate with SEK1, MKK7, and JNK3 (Fig.2, A, B, andC, lane 2) as previously reported (24Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Google Scholar, 25Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Google Scholar), but not with the components of the p38 signaling pathway (MKK3, MKK6, and p38; data not shown). Interestingly, these interactions were strongly increased by ASK1WT (Fig. 2, A, B, andC, lane 3), but not by the catalytically inactive mutant of ASK1 (ASK1KM; Fig. 2, A, B, andC, lane 4). In different sets of experiment, ASK1-dependent interactions were shown to be suppressed by the treatment of immunoprecipitates with protein phosphatase (Fig. 2,A, B, and C, lanes 5–7), suggesting that phosphorylation of the components within the signaling complex is required for enhanced interactions of JSAP1 with SEK1, MKK7, and JNK3. There were at least two possible explanations how ASK1 enhanced the interactions of JSAP1 with the downstream components. First, the downstream kinases activated by ASK1 might have higher affinity to JSAP1; or second, JSAP1 might be phosphorylated by the components of ASK1-JNK signaling module, and phosphorylated JSAP1 might have higher affinity to the downstream components. To test the first hypothesis, we compared the affinity of active and inactive mutant forms of MKK7 to JSAP1. MAPKKs require phosphorylation at conserved Ser/Thr residues in the activation loop of the kinase domain for activation. Substitution of these residues with charged or uncharged amino acids has been reported to generate constitutively active or inactive forms of MAPKK, respectively. Thus, we examined the bindings of JSAP1 with wild-type, constitutively active (MKK7EEE) and unphosphorylatable (therefore unactivatable; MKK7AAA) forms of MKK7 by coimmunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 2 D) (34Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Google Scholar). HA-tagged MKK7 mutants were transiently cotransfected into HEK293 cells with or without HA-ASK1 plus Myc-JSAP1, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. JSAP1 was found to associate to a similar extent with MKK7 mutants (Fig. 2 D). These results suggest that the activation status of MKK7 does not affect its binding to JSAP1. We next examined whether phosphorylation and activation of JNK3 are required to interact with JSAP1. Unphosphorylatable (therefore unactivatable; JNK3APF) and kinase-inactive (JNK3KR) mutants and wild-type JNK3 were equally bound to JSAP1 in the presence of ASK1 (Fig. 2 E, top panel), suggesting that neither activation nor phosphorylation state of JNK3 seemingly associates with its affinity to JSAP1. It was reported that prior activation of JNK3 in COS-7 cells by co-expression with MEKK1 strongly reduced the binding of JNK3 to recombinant JSAP1in vitro (24Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Google Scholar). These observations appear to contradict with our present study in that activation status of JNK3 does not affect its binding to JSAP1 in vivo. However, this may be partly explained by the different affinity of JSAP1 to JNK3 between in vitro and in vivo (see below). To test the second hypothesis, we examined whether ASK1 phosphorylates JSAP1 (Fig. 3 A). Myc-JSAP1 was cotransfected with or without ASK1WT and ASK1KM into HEK293 cells, and cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Expression of ASK1WT but not ASK1KM clearly phosphorylated JSAP1 in HEK293 cells, suggesting that ASK1 phosphorylates JSAP1 in vivo. Although JSAP1 has been reported to be phosphorylated at Thr-234/266, Thr-244/276, and Thr-255/287 residues (numbers in JSAP1a and JIP3, respectively) by JNK (24Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Google Scholar, 25Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Google Scholar), phosphorylation of these sites was shown to be unrelated to the affinity between JSAP1 and JNK (24Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Google Scholar, 25Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Google Scholar). To examine whether ASK1 can directly phosphorylate JSAP1, we performed an in vitrophosphorylation analysis using recombinant JSAP1 protein. Bacterially expressed GST fusion protein of JSAP1 (GST-JSAP1) was clearly phosphorylated by GST-ASK1ΔN (a constitutively active form of ASK1), but not by GST-ASK1ΔN-KR (a kinase-inactive mutant) (Fig.3 B, left panels). GST-JSAP1(1–744), which contains the known phosphorylation sites by JNK (25Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Google Scholar, 26Ito M. Akechi M. Hirose R. Ichimura M. Takamatsu N., Xu, P. Nakabeppu Y. Tadayoshi S. Yamamoto K. Yoshioka K. Gene. 2000; 255: 229-234Google Scholar), was bound to (Fig. 3 C) and phosphorylated by JNK3 (Fig. 3 D,lane 1) but not ASK1 (Fig. 3 D, lane 3), whereas, GST-JSAP1(744–1305) was clearly bound to (Fig.3 C) and phosphorylated by ASK1 in vitro (Fig.3 D, lane 6). These results indicated that ASK1 directly phosphorylates JSAP1 on sites different from those phosphorylated by JNK. To examine whether ASK1 is required for the phosphorylation of JSAP1, ASK1+/+ andASK1−/− MEFs were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Treatment with H2O2 clearly phosphorylated JSAP1 inASK1+/+ MEFs in a dose-dependent manner but only marginally in ASK1−/− MEFs (Fig. 3 E). These results indicate that ASK1 is an essential component for H2O2-induced phosphorylation of JSAP1. We next assessed the role for ASK1-induced phosphorylation of JSAP1 in its scaffolding activity. We have recently shown that ASK1 is specifically required for sustained activation of JNK induced by H2O2 (6Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Google Scholar). Fig. 3 F shows that H2O2-induced activation of JNK was maintained after 60 or 120 min in ASK1+/+ MEFs (Fig.3 F, lanes 3, 4) but notASK1−/− MEFs (Fig. 3 F, lanes 11, 12) as reported (6Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Google Scholar). When JSAP1 was expressed, sustained activation of endogenous JNK but not p38 (third panel from top) and ERK (fifth panel from top) was enhanced in ASK1+/+ MEFs but not at all inASK1−/− MEFs (Fig. 3 F, lanes 7, 8, 15, and 16). Moreover, H2O2-induced interaction between JNK and JSAP1 was enhanced only in ASK1+/+ but notASK1−/− MEFs (Fig. 3 G). These results strongly suggest that upon phosphorylation by ASK1 JSAP1 specifically facilitates JNK activation by recruiting downstream components of the ASK1-JNK cascade in response to oxidative stress. Here we represented a novel regulatory mechanism for JSAP1 scaffold. Phosphorylated JSAP1 by ASK1 appears to gain higher affinity to the downstream components. Our data suggest that activated ASK1 phosphorylates JSAP1 and thereby triggers the conformational change of JSAP1 from “inactive” to “active” configuration, which in turn induces the formation of a signaling complex composed of JSAP1, ASK1, SEK1/MKK7, and JNK3. JSAP1 thus functions not only as a simple scaffold but it dynamically participates in signal transduction by forming a stimulation-dependent functional complex in the ASK1-JNK module. Compared with a conventional idea in that necessary components are preset on the scaffold in order for efficient and specific signaling, this new mode of regulation of MAPK cascade appears to be advantageous for cells to prevent leaky signals generated under unstimulated conditions. Although we have not determined the phosphorylation site(s) of JSAP1 by ASK1, such a study will lead to our understanding of precise mechanism of phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of JNK signaling module. In addition, targeted disruption of JSAP1 will enable evaluation of the role of JSAP1 in stress-induced ASK1-JNK signaling pathway. Finally, whether this novel mode of regulation of MAPK cascade is applied to other MAPK pathways will be an interesting issue to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2056671431,"Human neutrophil accumulation in inflammatory foci is essential for the effective control of microbial infections. Although exposure of neutrophils to cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), generated at sites of inflammation, leads to activation of MAPK pathways, mechanisms responsible for the fine regulation of specific MAPK modules remain unknown. We have previously demonstrated activation of a TNFα-mediated JNK pathway module, leading to apoptosis in adherent human neutrophils (Avdi, N. J., Nick, J. A., Whitlock, B. B., Billstrom, M. A., Henson, P. M., Johnson, G. L., and Worthen, G. S. (2001) J. Biol. Chem.276, 2189–2199). Herein, evidence is presented linking regulation of the JNK pathway to p38 MAPK and the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A). Inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB 203580 and M 39 resulted in significant augmentation of TNFα-induced JNK and MKK4 (but not MKK7 or MEKK1) activation, whereas prior exposure to a p38-activating agent (platelet-activating factor) diminished the TNFα-induced JNK response. TNFα-induced apoptosis was also greatly enhanced upon p38 inhibition. Studies with a reconstituted cell-free system indicated the absence of a direct inhibitory effect of p38 MAPK on the JNK module. Neutrophil exposure to the Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A induced JNK activation. Increased phosphatase activity following TNFα stimulation was shown to be PP2A-associated and p38-dependent. Furthermore, PP2A-induced dephosphorylation of MKK4 resulted in its inactivation. Thus, in neutrophils, p38 MAPK, through a PP2A-mediated mechanism, regulates the JNK pathway, thus determining the extent and nature of subsequent responses such as apoptosis.

The responses of eukaryotic cells to external stimuli are regulated in part by the activation of three major MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; PP, protein phosphatase; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MEKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SEK, SAPK/ERK kinase (SEK1); MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PAF, platelet-activating factor. 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; PP, protein phosphatase; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MEKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SEK, SAPK/ERK kinase (SEK1); MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PAF, platelet-activating factor. signaling pathways, p42/44 ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK, which mediate many of the cellular processes associated with growth, survival, and death. Activation of the JNK pathway occurs in response to environmental and physiological stresses, including genotoxins, protein synthesis inhibitors, oxidative agents, and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα (1Buscher M. Rahmsdorf H.J. Litfin M. Karin M. Herrlich P. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 301-311Google Scholar, 2Sherman M.L. Datta R. Hallahan D.E. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Google Scholar), and has been linked to many important cellular functions and processes, including cell survival, death, gene expression, and embryogenesis. Our previous studies on adherent human neutrophils have focused on characterization of the TNFα-induced activation of JNK, defining both upstream signaling components and a downstream functional response of this pathway, apoptosis (26Avdi N.J. Nick J.A. Whitlock B.B. Billstrom M.A. Henson P.M. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2189-2199Google Scholar). However, mechanisms that regulate the JNK pathway remain poorly defined. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, MAPK pathways were initially conceptualized as linear hierarchies of signaling molecules that regulate the expression of specific phenotypic responses (5Errede B. Cade R.M. Yashar B.M. Kamada Y. Levin D.E. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 477-485Google Scholar, 6Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests, however, that the yeast homolog of mammalian p38 MAPK, Hog1, limits the activation of other pathways, thus altering the repertoire of MAPKs induced by osmotic stress (7O'Rourke S.M. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2874-2886Google Scholar). In a variety of eukaryotic cells, there is mounting evidence that the p38 MAPK pathway negatively regulates both the JNK and ERK signaling pathways in response to diverse stimuli. In papilloma-producing mouse keratinocytes, inhibition of p38 MAPK augments both native and okadaic acid-induced JNK and ERK activation, increases AP-1 binding to the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element, and enhances synthesis of JunD and FosB (8Rosenberger S.F. Gupta A. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3626-3632Google Scholar). Similarly, JNK activity in osmotically stressed Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (9Sheikh-Hamad D., Di Mari J. Suki W.N. Safirstein R. Watts III, B.A. Rouse D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1832-1837Google Scholar) and in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-differentiated HL-60 cells (10Wang X. Rao J. Studzinski G.P. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 425-437Google Scholar) is greatly increased in the presence of p38 MAPK inhibitors. Our group and others (11Dumont J.E. Pecasse F. Maenhaut C. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 457-463Google Scholar) define cross-talk or cross-signaling as the regulation of one signaling pathway by another. We hypothesized that p38 MAPK may regulate the TNFα-induced JNK pathway in human neutrophils via such a mechanism. However, regulation of MAPK pathways also involves the dynamic interplay between kinases and phosphatases. Because kinase-mediated protein phosphorylation is utilized in every aspect of cellular function, the requirement that the extent and amplitude of this action be tightly controlled is essential. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of phosphatase participation in such essential regulatory processes (12Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Google Scholar). Activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPKs involves a reversible/dual phosphorylation of Tyr and Thr residues, which are located in specific motifs, TEY, TPY, and TGY, respectively (13Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Google Scholar), whereas both the MAPK kinases and MAPK kinase kinases are phosphorylated at Ser/Thr residues (14Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Google Scholar). Conversely, inactivation is facilitated by the MAPK phosphatases, which include the single-specificity tyrosine phosphatases; the dual-specificity phosphatases, which dephosphorylate both Tyr and Ser/Thr residues; and the serine/threonine phosphatases (12Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Google Scholar, 15Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Google Scholar, 16Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Google Scholar), which comprise four major classes: PP1, PP2A (including PP4, PP5, and PP7), PP2B (calcineurin), and PP2C. The highly conserved and extremely abundant PP2A family (18Cohen P.T. Brewis N.D. Hughes V. Mann D.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 355-359Google Scholar) contributes extensively to the serine/threonine phosphatase activity of cells (19Cohen P.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Google Scholar). The PP2A holoenzyme comprises the core enzyme (PP2AD), consisting of a 36-kDa catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) strongly bound to the 65-kDa regulatory scaffold-like subunit A (PR65), while a third B regulatory subunit associates with the core. Knockout studies in yeast (20Kinoshita K. Nemoto T. Nabeshima K. Kondoh H. Niwa H. Yanagida M. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 29-45Google Scholar) and mice (21Gotz J. Probst A. Ehler E. Hemmings B. Kues W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12370-12375Google Scholar) have reported embryonic lethality for genes encoding the catalytic subunit of PP2A, demonstrating an absolute requirement for this enzyme (which is involved in almost every cellular process) (22Sontag E.

These results demonstrate that p38 MAPK activation has a profound inhibitory effect on the JNK pathway. We have defined the effect of p38 both on each member of the putative JNK module (JNK, MKK4/7, and MEKK1) and also on apoptosis, an important functional consequence of JNK pathway activation. Furthermore, our data support a role for PP2A downstream of p38 MAPK in the dephosphorylation of MKK4 and attenuation of JNK activation. Together, these findings advance our understanding of the regulation of the neutrophil response to pro-inflammatory stimuli and the potential effects of inhibiting the p38 MAPK pathway. This study has important implications for the clinical setting where the use of p38 inhibitors has already been proposed as an adjunct for treatment of patients in the resolution of certain inflammatory responses. Endotoxin-free reagents and plasticware were used throughout the experimental process. Neutrophils, prepared as previously described (23Avdi N.J. Winston B.W. Russel M. Young S.K. Johnson G.L.

Anti-phospho-JNK antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-PP2A antibody (clone 1D6) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Active MEKK, unactive and active GST-MKK4/SEK1, active p38, and wild-type JNK were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. c-Jun, a gift from Dr. Gary L. Johnson, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (25Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4867-4875Google Scholar). Neutrophils were preincubated as described previously (26Avdi N.J. Nick J.A. Whitlock B.B. Billstrom M.A. Henson P.M. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2189-2199Google Scholar) to promote adherence-like conditions. Stimulation with TNFα, lysis of cells, immunoprecipitation, and assays were also carried out as previously described (26Avdi N.J. Nick J.A. Whitlock B.B. Billstrom M.A. Henson P.M. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2189-2199Google Scholar). Active MEKK1 (50 ng), unactive GST-wild-type MKK4/SEK1 (250 ng), wild-type JNK (1 μg), and active p38 (25 ng) were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in cell-free assay buffer containing 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 75 mm MgCl2, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm ATP. Following this, 500 ng of c-Jun in 15 μCi [32P]ATP (3000 Ci/ml) was added for an additional 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated with 5× Laemmli sample buffer; samples were boiled; and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, which was either exposed to film for autoradiography or analyzed by phosphorimaging. Purified PP2A was protein A-Sepharose-immunoprecipitated with anti-PP2A antibody in JNK lysis buffer (26Avdi N.J. Nick J.A. Whitlock B.B. Billstrom M.A. Henson P.M. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2189-2199Google Scholar) for 2 h. The beads were washed once with JNK lysis buffer and twice with dephosphorylation assay buffer containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm imidazole HCl (pH 7.63), and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. PP2A-bound beads were incubated with active MKK4 (150 ng) in 30 μl of dephosphorylation mixture (20 μl of dephosphorylation assay buffer and 10 μl of solution buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 mm caffeine, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol) for 1 h at 30 °C. The supernatant (25 μl) containing MKK4 was transferred to a clean tube containing 35 μl of a kinase mixture (500 ng of c-Jun, 1 μg of wild-type JNK, and 15 μCi of [32P]ATP in cell-free assay buffer) and incubated for 25 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated with 5× Laemmli sample buffer at 100 °C; proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose; and phosphorylation changes were visualized by autoradiography and phosphorimaging. Two different phosphatase assays were employed. The first involved release of 32Pifrom 32P-labeled phosphorylase a, the preferred substrate for PP1 and PP2A. Neutrophils were stimulated with TNFα as described above, and cell pellets were lysed with phosphatase lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.14), 10% glycerol, 0.1% IGEPAL, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were passed five times through a 20-gauge needle and subjected to swift freeze-thawing, and phosphatase activity was determined according to the manufacturer's instructions (Protein Phosphatase Assay Systems, Invitrogen). The second method involved phosphate release from a phosphopeptide (250 μm), which was quantified using a malachite green reagent (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Ser/Thr Phosphatase Assay Kit I) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PP2A from neutrophils, lysed in JNK lysis buffer (26Avdi N.J. Nick J.A. Whitlock B.B. Billstrom M.A. Henson P.M. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Biol.

Microcentrifuge tubes were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 s at room temperature; 25 μl was transferred to an assay plate; and 100 μl of malachite green reagent was added according to the manufacturer's instructions for 15 min 30 °C. Changes in absorbance were measured at 630 nm. Phosphatase activity was determined as percent unstimulated control. Neutrophils were incubated as described previously (26Avdi N.J. Nick J.A. Whitlock B.B. Billstrom M.A. Henson P.M. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2189-2199Google Scholar) and then stimulated with TNFα for 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 h (all tubes were incubated for the same time period so that all tube reactions were terminated together). Neutrophils were cytocentrifuged onto glass slides and stained with a Hema 3 staining kit (Fisher), and apoptosis was assessed from changes in cell morphology, including nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation (27Frasch S.C. Nick J.A. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Worthen G.S. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8389-8397Google Scholar). Because it is particularly difficult in the human neutrophil to gain access to interacting points between kinase pathways, as these primary cells cannot be transfected, the delineation of such events relies at present on the use of specific pharmacological inhibitors (32Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Google Scholar, 42Eyers P.A. van den Ijssel P. Quinlan R.A. Goedert M. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451 (. P.): 191-196IGoogle Scholar). Small cell-permeant inhibitors such as SB 203580, which readily enters cells, provide certain advantages because they may be utilized to determine not only the roles and functional consequences of endogenous kinases, but also the effects of these kinases on other pathways. Previously, we have shown that TNFα induces JNK activation in human neutrophils in an adherence-dependent manner (26Avdi N.J. Nick J.A. Whitlock B.B. Billstrom M.A. Henson P.M. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2189-2199Google Scholar). To study the effect of p38 MAPK on TNFα-induced JNK signaling, human neutrophils were pretreated with SB 203580, a pyridinylimidazole that inhibits both p38αn and p38β2 MAPK (28Goedert M. Cuenda A. Craxton M. Jakes R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3563-3571Google Scholar, 29Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Google Scholar), and TNFα-induced JNK activation was determined from in vitro phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun. JNK was activated in response to TNFα, as we have previously reported (26Avdi N.J. Nick J.A. Whitlock B.B. Billstrom M.A. Henson P.M. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2189-2199Google Scholar); and this activity was significantly augmented in TNFα-stimulated neutrophils pretreated with SB 203580 (Fig.1 A). Increased JNK activity in unstimulated neutrophils following SB 203580 pretreatment was also observed, but to a lesser extent than in TNFα-stimulated neutrophils. Western blots probed with a phospho-specific antibody directed against the active form of JNK demonstrated increased JNK phosphorylation in unstimulated and TNFα-stimulated neutrophils following inhibition of p38 MAPK (Fig. 1 B), which was consistent with the observed increase in JNK activity (Fig. 1 A). Reprobing these same immunoblots with an antibody directed against JNK demonstrated that equal amounts of JNK protein had been immunoprecipitated under all conditions (Fig. 1 B), ruling out the possibility that the increase in JNK activity was due to the presence of greater amounts of JNK protein in the p38 inhibitor-pretreated samples. To validate the in vivo specificity of the enhanced TNFα-induced JNK response induced by SB 203580 and because of the reported effects of SB 203580 on other kinases at higher concentrations (24Liverton N.J. Butcher J.W. Claiborne C.F. Claremon D.A. Libby B.E. Nguyen K.T. Pitzenberger S.M. Selnick H.G. Smith G.R. Tebben A. Vacca J.P. Varga S.L. Agarwal L. Dancheck K. Forsyth A.J. Fletcher D.S. Frantz B. Hanlon W.A. Harper C.F. Hofsess S.J. Kostura M. Lin J. Luell S. O'Neill E.A. O'Keefe S.J. et al.J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 2180-2190Google Scholar, 30Nick J.A. Young S.K. Brown K.K. Avdi N.J. Arndt P.G.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2047-2054Google Scholar, 32Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Google Scholar), a structurally distinct and more highly specific p38 inhibitor, M 39, was used in parallel. Pretreatment of neutrophils with M 39 similarly increased TNFα-induced JNK phosphorylation compared with non-M 39-pretreated cells (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, TNFα-induced JNK phosphorylation in neutrophils that had been pretreated with SB 202474, a non-active analog of SB 203580, was not augmented. JNK activation can be induced by DNA-damaging agents such as UV irradiation and by protein synthesis inhibitors such as anisomycin, in addition to the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα. Therefore, we questioned whether p38 inhibition would similarly augment JNK pathway activation induced by UV irradiation and anisomycin. Pretreatment with SB 203580 and M 39 resulted in augmentation of UV-induced JNK activation (Fig.2, A and B). Although anisomycin only weakly induces JNK activation in neutrophils, pretreatment with M 39 also enhanced the anisomycin-induced JNK activation (Fig. 2 B). Thus, increased JNK activation following p38 inhibitor pretreatment occurs when the JNK pathway is activated by three mechanistically different neutrophil stimuli. The augmentation of TNFα-stimulated JNK activation observed following p38 MAPK inhibition suggests that either p38 or a downstream effector of the p38 pathway may regulate JNK activity. We hypothesized that if p38 MAPK inhibition resulted in an enhanced response to TNFα, then pre-activation of p38 MAPK in the neutrophil should cause a concomitant decreased JNK response to TNFα. To further investigate this, TNFα-induced JNK activation was studied in neutrophils in which p38 had been activated by prior exposure to PAF, a lipid mediator that we have previously shown to induce rapid activation of p38 MAPK in neutrophils (33Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Young S.K. Knall C. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 975-986Google Scholar). Under the given conditions, neither JNK (Fig.3 B) nor ERK (33Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Young S.K. Knall C. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 975-986Google Scholar) was activated by PAF. PAF pretreatment for 5 min significantly decreased the TNFα-induced JNK response by 47% in neutrophils (Fig.3 A). This reduction could be reversed upon exposure of neutrophils to a p38 inhibitor prior to PAF stimulation. To verify that p38 was indeed active at this time, we exposed neutrophils to PAF over a period of 5 min and determined p38 activity in immunoprecipitates using an in vitro kinase assay. Additionally, immunoblots from PAF-stimulated lysates were probed with an antibody directed against phosphorylated p38 MAPKs. Both of these methods of assessment indicated that p38, but not JNK, was rapidly activated by PAF and that this activation was sustained over a 5-min period (Fig. 3 B). p38 immunoblots demonstrated that equal amounts of p38 were present under all conditions, thus normalizing the p38 activity. To determine whether interaction between the p38 MAPK and JNK pathways occurs at the level of JNK itself or an upstream JNK pathway member, we studied the effects of p38 MAPK inhibition on the JNK-activating kinases MKK4 and MKK7. We have shown previously that both MKK4 and MKK7 are activated in TNFα-stimulated neutrophils (26Avdi N.J. Nick J.A. Whitlock B.B. Billstrom M.A. Henson P.M. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2189-2199Google Scholar). Neutrophils were pretreated in the absence and presence of both SB 203580 and M 39, and MKK4 activity was determined in MKK4 immunoprecipitates from TNFα-stimulated neutrophils. MKK4 activity was greatly augmented under conditions in which p38 activity was inhibited, both for SB 203580 (Fig.4 A) and for M 39 (data not shown). SB 202474, an inactive analog of SB 203580, failed to induce any augmentation of TNFα-induced MKK4 pathway activity (Fig.4 A). Western blots of these samples demonstrated that equal amounts of MKK4 protein had been immunoprecipitated under all conditions (data not shown). In contrast, p38 MAPK inhibition did not result in a similar augmentation of TNFα-induced MKK7 activity (Fig.4 B). Analysis of these samples by Western blotting again confirmed that equal amounts of MKK7 protein had been immunoprecipitated (data not shown). Although a variety of kinases appear to lie upstream of MKK4/7, we have previously shown that MEKK1 is activated in TNFα-stimulated human neutrophils (26Avdi N.J. Nick J.A. Whitlock B.B. Billstrom M.A. Henson P.M. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2189-2199Google Scholar), and others have shown that MEKK1 is involved in the JNK pathway (34Xia Y.

Biosci. 1998; 3: D1181-D1186Google Scholar). To determine whether inhibition of p38 MAPK acts upstream of MKK4 on MEKK1, neutrophils were pretreated in the absence and presence of SB 203580, and MEKK1 activity was determined in vitrowith a coupled kinase assay. Pretreatment of neutrophils with SB 203580 did not enhance the TNFα-induced MEKK1 activity compared with non-inhibitor-pretreated cells (Fig. 4 C). This observation could be interpreted to indicate that the p38 pathway may act at the level of MKK4, but does not preclude the possibility that other MEKKs may be upstream of MKK4. A cell-free system composed of recombinant components, including p38 MAPK and members of the JNK pathway module (MEKK1/MKK4/JNK/c-Jun), was developed to determine whether p38 MAPK modulates the MEKK1-mediated activation of MKK4. In vitro phosphorylation of recombinant proteins in the presence of 32P-labeled ATP was measured. Active recombinant MEKK1 greatly enhanced activation of a JNK module consisting of MKK4/JNK and c-Jun; and in its absence, MKK4 had only moderate ability to activate JNK and c-Jun (Fig.5), thus confirming previous studies showing that in vitro reconstitution behaves robustly, requires all components and results in amplification of the preceding signal (67Gerwins P. Blank J.L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8288-8295Google Scholar). In the presence of active p38 MAPK, these characteristics did not appear to change. We were unable to detect any inhibitory effects of p38 MAPK activation on the fully reconstituted system or on any of the downstream components. The inclusion of active p38 MAPK neither inhibited MEKK1-induced activation of MKK4 and the sequential substrates JNK and c-Jun nor reduced the phosphorylation of MKK4 once activated. In fact, in the presence of active p38 MAPK, a slight increase in MKK4 phosphorylation was detected, as reported by others (40Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T., Wu, I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Google Scholar). Recent evidence for the involvement of the p38-regulated protein phosphatase PP2A in MEK1 and MEK2 activity (41Westermarck J., Li, S.P. Kallunki T. Han J. Kahari V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2373-2383Google Scholar) raised the possibility that p38 MAPK may regulate TNFα-induced JNK pathway activation via its action on a phosphatase. Therefore, we investigated the effects of the PP1/PP2A inhibitors calyculin A and okadaic acid on TNFα-induced JNK activation. Pretreatment of neutrophils with calyculin A induced activation of JNK in the absence of TNFα (Fig.6 A), but did not augment the TNFα-induced response. However, if neutrophils were pretreated with M 39 prior to calyculin A exposure, a further augmentation in the JNK response was observed both in the presence and absence of TNFα. Pretreatment of neutrophils with okadaic acid resulted in enhanced JNK phosphorylation activation"

https://openalex.org/W2325847766,"We have previously shown that O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), a DNA repair protein that protects tissues against toxic and carcinogenic effects of alkylating agents, is degraded through ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis. Here, we investigated the role of the human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 protein in MGMT degradation. In three pairs of isogenic human tumor cell lines in which a member of each pair expressed the E6 protein through stable transfection (HCT116/HCT116-E6, MCF7/MCF7-E6, and RKO/RKO-E6), we found a consistent 40-55% reduction in the MGMT protein level and its activity in all E6-expressing cells compared with the parent cells (P=<0.05). E6 expression did not, however, alter the levels of MGMT mRNA. Addition of the recombinant MGMT (rMGMT) protein to extracts of HCT116/E6 cells resulted in the binding of E6 to MGMT. Further, the purified E6 protein promoted the degradation of rMGMT in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Immunoprecipitation assays showed the presence of a ternary protein complex between MGMT, E6, and the cellular ubiquitin-ligase E6-associated protein (E6-AP). Transient transfection of the p53-null H1299 lung tumor cells with an E6 construct also down-regulated the MGMT. The MGMT protein also showed structural features that are compatible for interaction with the E6, and E6-AP components. Collectively, these data suggest that the oncogenic E6 proteins enhance the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of MGMT."

The 190-kDa multidrug resistance protein, MRP1, is frequently overexpressed in drug-resistant tumor cell lines and is also expressed in a wide variety of human tumors. The xenobiotics transported by MRP1 range from complex heterocyclic natural products and chemotherapeutic agents such as vincristine, doxorubicin, and the folate antagonist methotrexate to arsenical and antimonial oxyanions (3Cole S.P.C.

MRP1 has also been shown to be an efficient ATP-dependent transporter of various conjugated organic anions, including a mediator of inflammation, the cysteinyl leukotriene LTC4, the cholestatic glucuronide conjugated estrogen E217βG, and the sulfate conjugate estrone 3-sulfate (8Leslie E.M.

To transport unconjugated drugs such as vincristine, MRP1 requires the presence of reduced GSH, or analog, which appears to be co-transported with the drug (10Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G.

MRP1 belongs to subfamily C of the ABC transporter superfamily, which, in addition to MRP2–7, includes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the sulfonylurea receptors, SUR1 and SUR2 (8Leslie E.M.

Some members of the ABCC subfamily (MRP4, MRP5, CFTR, ABCC11, and ABCC12) have a typical four domain ABC transporter structure with two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) and two nucleotide binding domains (8Leslie E.M.

However, the predicted topologies of the remaining members of this subfamily (MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, MRP6, and MRP7 as well as the K+ channel regulators, SUR1 and SUR2), together in some cases with biochemical studies, indicate that they contain an additional NH2-terminal MSD with five TM segments and an extracytosolic NH2 terminus (16Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Leslie E.M. Gerlach J.H. Grant C.E. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23623-23630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 17Kast C. Gros P.

Thus, these ABCC transporters are predicted to have 17 TM segments, assumed to be α-helices, distributed among three MSDs: (MSD1, TM1–5; MSD2, TM6–11; and MSD3, TM12–17) (Fig. 1 A). Overall, MRP2, MRP3, and MRP6 are the most closely related to MRP1 with respect to their structure and ability to transport conjugated organic anions. Like MRP1, MRP2 and MRP3 can also confer resistance to a variety of cytotoxic drugs (9Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Holland I.B. Higgins C.F. Kuchler K. Cole S.P.C. ABC Transporters: From Bacteria to Man.

It has previously been noted that MRP1 contains a significantly greater number of potentially charged amino acids in its predicted TM α-helices than P-glycoprotein (26Seelig A., Li Blatter X. Wohnsland F. Int. J. Clin. Pharmacol. Therap. 2000; 38: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Since many of the molecules recognized and transported by MRP1 contain a relatively large hydrophobic domain as well as a hydrophilic domain with at least one anionic or cationic charge at physiological pH, it seems reasonable to suggest that charged amino acids in the TM segments of this protein might well play a role in determining its substrate specificity and transport activity (26Seelig A., Li Blatter X.

Hydropathy analyses predict that the first TM helix of MSD2, TM6, spans amino acids 320–340 and contains three potentially charged amino acids (Fig. 1). In the present study, we have mutated TM6 Lys332, His335, and Asp336, which are predicted to cluster in the exoplasmic leaflet of the membrane, and show that replacing them individually with a neutral or oppositely charged amino acid markedly affects the transport activity of MRP1. Importantly, we show that substitutions of Lys332 and to a lesser extent His335selectively decrease the binding and transport of LTC4 and GSH while leaving the transport of other organic anions unchanged. In contrast, substitutions of Asp336 show no such selectivity, since mutation of this amino acid markedly reduces or eliminates transport of all MRP1 substrates and thus appears critical for the overall activity of the protein. [14,15-3H]LTC4(115.3 Ci mmol−1) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. [6,7-3H]E217βG (55 Ci mmol−1), [6,7-3H]estrone 3-sulfate, and [glycine-2-3H]GSH (40–44.8 Ci mmol−1) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [3′,5′,7′-3H]Methotrexate sodium salt (17 Ci mmol−1) was from Moravek Inc. (Brea, CA). LTC4was purchased from Calbiochem and nucleotides, GSH, acivicin, E217βG, and dithiothreitol were purchased from Sigma. The MRP1 expression vector pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP1K has been described previously (31Ito K. Olsen S.L. Qiu W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15616-15624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The template for mutagenesis was prepared by cloning a 1.88-kbBamHI-SphI fragment from pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP1K (containing nucleotides 840–2720 of the MRP1 sequence encoding amino acids 240–907) into pGEM-3Z® (Promega, Madison, WI). Mutations were generated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the individual sense strands, with the altered codons underlined and the corresponding changes in amino acids indicated in parentheses were as follows: (K332D) 5′-CTC ATG AGC TTC TTC TTC GAC GCC ATC CAC GAC CTG-3′; (K332L) 5′-CTC ATG AGC TTC TTC TTC CTG GCC ATC CAC GAC CTG-3′; (H335E) 5′-GC TTC TTC TTC AAG GCC ATC GAGGAC CTG ATG ATG-3′; (H335L) 5′-GC TTC TTC TTC AAG GCC ATCTTG GAC CTG ATG ATG-3′; (H335Q) 5′-GC TTC TTC TTC AAG GCC ATC CAG GAC CTG ATG ATG-3′; (D336R) 5′-C AAG GCC ATC CACCGG CTG ATG ATG TTT TCG-3′; (D336L) 5′-C AAG GCC ATC CACCTG CTG ATG ATG TTT TCG-3′. The presence of mutations was confirmed by sequencing and diagnostic restriction enzyme digests where restriction sites were introduced. Mutated cDNAs were then digested with BamHI and PstI to obtain an 284-bp fragment containing the altered sequence, which was used to replace the corresponding fragment in the wild-type pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP1K plasmid. After cloning, the inserts were again sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation. The 238-amino acid coding sequence of jellyfish GFP with Ser65 → Thr was cloned in frame to the 3′-end of MRP1 to generate the wild-type construct pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP1K-GFP as described (31Ito K. Olsen S.L. Qiu W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15616-15624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Mutant MRP1-GFP fusion proteins were generated by replacing the 1-kb BamHI/Bsu36I fragment in the pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP1K-GFP construct with the comparable fragment containing the desired altered cDNA sequence. Constructs containing wild-type and TM6 mutant pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP1 expression vectors were transfected into SV40-transformed human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T). Briefly, ∼7 × 106 cells were seeded in 150-mm plates, and 24 h later, DNA (16 μg) was added using FuGENE™6 (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 72 h, the HEK293T cells were harvested, and inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (32Leslie E.M. Ito K. Upadhyaya P. Hecht S.S. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27846-27854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Empty vector and vector containing the wild-type cDNAs were included as controls in all experiments. Levels of wild-type and TM6 mutant MRP1 proteins were determined by immunoblotting as described below. The expression levels of wild-type and TM6 mutant MRP1 proteins were determined by immunoblot analysis of membrane protein fractions from transfected cells essentially as described (33Hipfner D.R.

Proteins were resolved on a 7% polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to a nylon membrane. Blots were blocked with 4% (w/v) skim milk powder for 1 h followed by incubation with the human MRP1-specific murine monoclonal antibody QCRL-1 (diluted 1:10,000), which recognizes a linear epitope consisting of amino acids 918–924 (34Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Stride B.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3307-3314PubMed Google Scholar). After washing, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Pierce) followed by application of Renaissance®chemiluminescence blotting substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Relative levels of MRP1 expression were estimated by densitometric analysis using a ChemiImager™ 4000 (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). HEK293T cells were seeded at 3.5 × 105 cells/well in a six-well plate on coverslips coated with 0.1% gelatin in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and transiently transfected with the MRP1-GFP cDNA constructs (1 μg of DNA/well) using FuGENE™6 as before. Forty-eight h later, the coverslips were washed once with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were permeabilized by adding 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. The coverslips were then incubated in RNase A (10 μg ml−1 in 0.1% Triton X-100 plus 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 60 min at room temperature. The coverslips were washed again, and cell nuclei were stained in 1 ml of propidium iodide (2 μg ml−1 in PBS) for 45 min in the dark. Finally, the coverslips were placed on slides containing one drop of Antifade Solution (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and cells were examined using a Meridien InSight Plus confocal microscope equipped with an air-cooled argon laser. Images obtained with 488-nm excitation were pseudocolored and overlaid using Maxim DL software. Preparation of inside-out membrane vesicles from transfected HEK293T cells has been described previously (32Leslie E.M. Ito K. Upadhyaya P. Hecht S.S. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27846-27854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and ATP-dependent uptake of 3H-labeled substrates by the membrane vesicles was measured using a rapid filtration technique also as described previously (10Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Briefly, LTC4 transport assays were performed at 23 °C in a 50-μl reaction containing 50 nm LTC4 (50 nm; 40 nCi), 4 mm AMP or ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, creatine phosphate (10 mm), creatine kinase (100 μg ml−1), and 2 μg of vesicle protein. Uptake was stopped at selected times by rapid dilution in ice-cold buffer, and then the incubation mixture was filtered through glass fiber (Type A/E) filters that had been presoaked in transport buffer. Radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. All data were corrected for the amount of [3H]LTC4 that remained bound to the filter, which was usually <10% of the total radioactivity. Transport in the presence of AMP was subtracted from transport in the presence of ATP to determine ATP- dependent LTC4 uptake. All transport assays were carried out in triplicate, and results were expressed as means ± S.D. Uptake of E217βG was measured in a similar fashion except that membrane vesicles (2 μg of protein) were incubated at 37 °C in a total reaction volume of 50 μl containing [3H]E217βG (400 nm; 40 nCi) and components as described for [3H]LTC4transport. ATP-dependent transport of estrone 3-sulfate into membrane vesicles was measured as described above for [3H]E217βG except that the initial substrate concentration was 300 nm (200 nCi) [3H]estrone 3-sulfate, and the reaction volume was 60 μl containing 3 mm GSH and 10 mmdithiothreitol. GSH uptake was also measured by rapid filtration with membrane vesicles (20 μg of protein) incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in a 60-μl reaction volume with 100 μm[3H]GSH (300 nCi/reaction). To minimize GSH catabolism by γ-glutamyltranspeptidase during transport, membranes were preincubated in 0.5 mm acivicin for 10 min at 37 °C prior to measuring [3H]GSH uptake in the presence of apigenin (30 μm) (32Leslie E.M.

MTX uptake was also measured as described previously (35Ito K. Oleschuk C.J. Westlake C. Vasa M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38108-38114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out at 37 °C in a 60-μl reaction volume containing [3H]MTX (100 μm; 200 nCi), membrane vesicles (10 μg of protein), and other components as above. Uptake was stopped after 20 min by rapid dilution in ice-cold buffer and processed as before. K m and Vmaxvalues of ATP-dependent LTC4 transport by membrane vesicles (2.5 μg of protein) were determined by measuring uptake at eight different [3H]LTC4concentrations (10–1000 nm) for 1 min at 23 °C in 50 μl of transport buffer containing components as described above. Data were analyzed using Graph Pad Prism™ software and kinetic parameters determined by nonlinear regression analyses and Michaelis-Menten analysis. Photolabeling of MRP1 with [3H] LTC4—Wild-type and TM6 mutant MRP1 membrane proteins were photolabeled with [3H]LTC4 essentially as described (10Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Briefly, vesicles prepared from HEK293T cells transfected with wild-type and TM6 mutant MRP1 cDNAs (75 μg of protein in 50 μl) were incubated with [3H]LTC4 (0.5 μCi; 200 nm) at room temperature for 30 min and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were then alternately irradiated at 302 nm for 1 min using a CL-1000 ultraviolet cross-linker (DiaMed, Mississauga, Canada) and snap-frozen in liquid N2 10 times. Radiolabeled proteins (75 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed (isopropyl alcohol/water/acetic acid; 25:65:10) and then soaked in Amplify® (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. After drying for 2 h, the gel was exposed to Kodak X-Omat film for 1 week at −70 °C. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the three charged amino acids found in predicted TM6 of MRP1. An alignment of the amino acid sequence of MRP1 TM6 and the corresponding sequences in related ABC-C proteins revealed that Asp336 is the most highly conserved of the three amino acids, whereas His335 is the least conserved (Fig.1 B). An α-helical wheel projection of putative TM6 shows that it is highly amphipathic and, furthermore, that all three charged amino acids are on the same face of the helix within an arc of ∼100° and cluster in the outer leaflet of the membrane (Fig. 1 C). Lys332 was replaced with a nonpolar neutral amino acid (Leu) to eliminate charge and with Asp to introduce the opposite charge. Similarly, Asp336 was replaced with Leu as well as Arg. Histidine, although not positively charged at physiological pH, has a strong basic character. Consequently, in addition to substituting His335 with Leu, it was replaced with a polar neutral amino acid (Gln) and an acidic Glu residue. Expression of the wild-type and TM6 mutant MRP1 proteins was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. In all cases, the MRP1-specific monoclonal antibody QCRL-1 detected a single band of 190 kDa in membrane vesicles prepared from transfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 3 A). Densitometric analysis showed that all mutants were expressed at levels comparable with that of wild-type MRP1 (80–100%). The GFP fusion proteins of wild-type MRP1 and the TM6 MRP1 mutants were also expressed at similar levels (data not shown). To determine whether the substitutions of Lys332, His335, and Asp336 impaired trafficking of MRP1 to the plasma membrane, the subcellular localization of the MRP1 TM6 mutants was compared with wild-type MRP1 by confocal laser-scanning fluorescence microscopy. For these experiments, GFP-tagged constructs encoding wild-type MRP1 and TM6 mutant MRP1 proteins were generated and transfected into HEK293 cells. When viewed under the confocal microscope, both wild-type and mutant MRP1 proteins exhibited an exclusively plasma membrane localization, confirming that the mutant proteins were correctly routed to the cell surface. Representative confocal micrographs of cells expressing GFP-tagged wild-type MRP1 and mutants K332D, H335E, and D336R are shown in Fig. 2. To determine the effect of the TM6 mutations on MRP1 transport activity, a time course of ATP-dependent [3H]LTC4 uptake was performed using inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from transfected HEK293T cells that expressed comparable levels of MRP1 proteins (Fig.3 A). In the case of the MRP1-Lys332 mutants K332D and K332L (Fig. 3 B) and the MRP1-Asp336 mutants D336L and D336R (Fig.3 D), LTC4 uptake was reduced to levels that were indistinguishable from those observed with vesicles prepared from empty vector-transfected control cells. LTC4 uptake by the MRP1-His335 mutants was also reduced but to a lesser degree. Thus H335E and H335L and H335Q all transported LTC4at levels that were ∼50–60% of wild-type MRP1 uptake levels (Fig.3 C). These results show that LTC4 transport activity of MRP1 is adversely affected by both charged and neutral changes to all three charged amino acids of TM6. To further investigate the effect of the His335 substitutions on the reduced ability of MRP1 to transport LTC4, the kinetic parameters of [3H]LTC4 uptake by the H335E, H335L, and H335Q MRP1 mutants were determined (Fig.4). The K m(LTC4) values of the MRP1-His335 mutant proteins (154, 126, and 123 nm, respectively) were similar to those of wild-type MRP1 (122 nm), indicating that the affinity of MRP1 for LTC4 was not significantly affected by these TM6 His335 substitutions. In contrast, theV max values for the mutant proteins were reduced ∼2-fold. Thus, for wild-type MRP1, the V max(LTC4) was 101 pmol−1 mg−1min−1 compared with 69, 63, and 48 pmol−1mg−1 min−1 for the H335E, H335L, and H335Q mutants, respectively. We further explored the importance of Lys332, His335, and Asp336 for the transport activity of MRP1 by determining time courses of [3H]E217βG uptake by these mutants (Fig.5). The Lys332 mutants (Fig.5 A) and His335 mutants (Fig. 5 B) exhibited the same levels of E217βG uptake as wild-type MRP1. In contrast, substitution of Asp336 with either Leu or Arg led to a complete loss of E217βG uptake. Thus, as shown in Fig. 5 C, MRP1-Asp336 mutants D336L and D336R exhibited the same E217βG uptake activity as the empty vector control. These observations indicate that substitutions of Lys332 and His335 selectively reduce LTC4 transport but leave E217βG uptake intact, whereas replacing Asp336 eliminates MRP1-mediated transport of both conjugated organic anions altogether. Reciprocal and competitive inhibition of LTC4 and E217βG transport has been reported previously (10Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 36Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9683-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Consequently, to determine whether E217βG transport by the TM6 mutant MRP1 proteins that either no longer transport LTC4 or exhibit reduced LTC4 transport activity could still be inhibited by this cysteinyl leukotriene, [3H]E217βG uptake by the Lys332and His335 mutants in the presence of LTC4 was examined. As shown in Fig. 6 A, LTC4 at a concentration of 2 μm completely inhibited [3H]E217βG uptake by wild-type MRP1 as expected. In contrast, LTC4 had very little effect (<15%) on E217βG uptake by MRP1 mutants K332D and K332L, indicating that loss of LTC4 transport in these mutants is associated with a loss of binding of this substrate.

In the breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, HEF1 is post-translationally processed during the cell cycle and during apoptosis, giving rise to specific forms (p105, p115, p55, and p28) which differentially localize to both focal adhesions as well as the nucleus (21Law S.F.

Molecular genetic experiments have indicated that HEF1 overexpression leads to an increase in cell motility and apoptosis, consistent with a role for HEF1 in regulating integrin signaling (12Fashena S.J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the present study we have found that p115 and p105 HEF1 are expressed in dermal fibroblasts and that their expression is regulated by TGF-β1. TGF-β1 up-regulated HEF1 mRNA transcription and induced a rapid increase in total HEF1 synthesis, which resulted in a 16-fold increase in HEF1 protein levels within 4 h. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p105HEF1 was dependent on Src kinase and cell adhesion. Serine/threonine phosphorylation of HEF1 was also dependent on cell adhesion. Disruption of either cell adhesion or actin organization resulted in a rapid dephosphorylation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues. These findings demonstrate that in dermal fibroblasts, the levels of phosphorylated HEF1 are coordinately regulated by both growth factors and cell adhesion.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have found that TGF-β1 is a potent inducer of expression of the Cas family member, HEF1, in human dermal fibroblasts. An increase of more than 16-fold in HEF1 protein levels was detected when quiescent fibroblasts were treated with 1 ng/ml of TGF-β1 for 4 h. TGF-β1 induced HEF1 expression by up-regulating HEF1 mRNA transcription and had no effect on either HEF1 protein or mRNA turnover. Regulation of HEF1 gene expression by TGF-β1 was unaffected by either actin-altering drugs or by cell suspension suggesting that adhesion- or cell shape-based signaling pathways are not involved in the regulation of HEF1 expression by TGF-β1. In contrast, the induction of the plasminogen-activator inhibitor gene by TGF-β1 has recently been shown to be regulated by adhesion (37Kutz S.M. Hordines J. McKeown-Longo P.J. Higgins P.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3905-3914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Varied effects of TGF-β1 on HEF1 expression have been reported previously. In H-9 lymphoblastoid cells as well as A549 lung carcinoma cells, TGF-β1 induced a rapid decrease in HEF1 levels which was dependent on proteosome-mediated degradation (38Liu X. Elia A.E. Law S.F. Golemis E.A. Farley J.R. Wang T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6759-6769Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the A549 cells, the initial loss of endogenous HEF1 was followed by a modest (4-fold) increase in HEF1 protein which was due to an increase in gene expression (38Liu X. Elia A.E. Law S.F. Golemis E.A. Farley J.R. Wang T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6759-6769Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found no decrease in HEF1 protein levels following TGF-β1 treatment in human skin fibroblasts (Fig. 3). It has been reported that expression of HEF1 in human breast carcinoma cells is cell cycle-regulated and rapidly enhanced upon induction of cell growth (23Law S.F. Zhang Y.-Z. Klein-Szanto A.J.P. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The results presented here demonstrate that there are only slight effects on HEF1 expression by treatment of serum-starved fibroblasts with EGF, acidic FGF, basic FGF, or PDGF, which are known mitogens for fibroblasts (Fig.1). Apparently, mitogenic signals are insufficient to induce high levels of HEF1. Furthermore, TGF-β1-induced total HEF1 production is not changed in suspended fibroblasts in which cell proliferation is interrupted (Fig. 10, panels A and B). These findings suggest that the function of TGF-β1-induced HEF1 in fibroblasts may be unrelated to cell growth.Previous studies using hematopoetic cells have shown that ligation of the β1 integrin with fibronectin or with antibodies to the integrin receptor results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of HEF1 within 30 min (13Sattler M. Salgia R. Shrikhande G. Verma S. Uemura N. Law S.F. Golemis E.A. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14320-14326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Manie S.N.

Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), implicating a role for HEF1 in “outside-in” signaling through the integrin. In adherent cells, HEF1 can form complexes with Abl, as well as Src kinases, and overexpressing of either kinase has been shown to up-regulate tyrosine phorphorylation of HEF1 (11Law S.F. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 18Zhang Z. Baron R. Horne W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37219-37223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Evidence presented here indicates that HEF1 is a substrate for Src but not Abl kinase and that Src kinase is required for the adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of HEF1. These results also indicate that Src, rather than Abl, plays an important role in adhesion-regulated tyrosine phosphorylation of HEF1 in human dermal fibroblasts and that HEF1 is part of the integrin signaling pathway.In this study, we have shown that the appearance of the p115 species of HEF1 is also regulated by cell adhesion. Earlier studies in MCF-7 cells have suggested that the p115 species of HEF1 may represent a serine/threonine phosphorylated form of HEF1 (23Law S.F. Zhang Y.-Z. Klein-Szanto A.J.P. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our results support this earlier finding and extend it to show that the conversion of p105HEF1 to p115HEF1 is adhesion-dependent. Conversion of p105HEF1 to p115HEF1 occurred as a consequence of adhesion of cells to numerous matrix molecules and was sensitive to drugs that disrupt actin stress fibers. This suggests that serine/threonine phosphorylation of HEF1 arises as a consequence of cytoskeleton organization rather than from ligation of a specific integrin receptor. Serine/threonine phosphorylation of HEF1 can be distinguished from integrin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of other focal adhesion proteins. Fibronectin-dependent adhesion quickly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas to a maximal level within 15 min (Fig. 6), in a manner similar to integrin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of tensin, paxillin, and FAK (31Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hasasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Miromoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16781-16787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, the serine/threonine phosphorylation of HEF1 occurred between 1 and 2 h after adhesion (Fig. 6), suggesting that activation of serine/threonine kinases occurs subsequent to the phosphorylation of HEF1 on tyrosine.Treatment of cells with latrunculin A resulted in a rapid loss of phosphorylated species of HEF1. Tyrosine phosphorylation was lost within 30 min, while p115HEF was decreased 50% by 30 min. Similar results were seen when cells were placed in suspension. This rapid loss of phosphorylated species of HEF1 suggests that disruption of actin fibers within the cell results in an increase in both tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphatase activity. Replating of suspended cells onto a fibronectin substrate resulted in a complete restoration of p115HEF1 levels within 2 h. These findings indicate that the interconversion between p105HEF1 and p115 HEF1 may be caused by the cytoskeletal regulation of both serine/threonine kinases and phosphatases. TGF-β1 did not alter the kinetics of appearance of p115HEF1 and tyrosine-phosphorylated p105HEF1 nor the ratio of p115versus p105HEF1 and tyrosine-phosphorylated p105HEF1versus p105HEF1 protein, suggesting that TGF-β1 affects only HEF1 levels and not post-translational modifications by the kinases or phosphatases.The functional significance of the serine/threonine phosphorylation of HEF1 is not well understood. HEF1 is differentially proteolyzed by caspases to yield a 55-kDa and a 28-kDa fragment during mitosis and apoptosis, respectively (21Law S.F. O'Neill G.M. Fashena S.J. Einarson M.B. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5184-5195Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Law S.F. Zhang Y.-Z. Klein-Szanto A.J.P. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that specific HEF1 fragments have distinct activities as the 55 kDa associates with the mitotic spindle while the 28-kDa fragment causes apoptosis. The caspase cleavage site, which generates the 55-kDa fragment is immediately adjacent to a serine-rich region, raising the possibility that differential phosphorylation of serines might help regulate the sensitivity of HEF1 to caspase-mediated degradation. Another role for phosphorylated HEF1 has been proposed in a recent study, which has shown that p115HEF1 can complex with smad3 and inhibit smad3-mediated gene responses to TGF-β1 (38Liu X. Elia A.E. Law S.F. Golemis E.A. Farley J.R. Wang T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6759-6769Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, p115HEF1 may also function to negatively regulate TGF-β1 signaling pathways, which require smad3.The relationship of HEF1 to TGF-β1 function in dermal fibroblasts is not known. A role for HEF1 in growth control or apoptosis does not seem likely as TGF-β1 does not normally regulate these processes in differentiated fibroblasts. As HEF1 has been shown to be part of the signaling pathway regulated by the β1 integrin, one might speculate that HEF1 levels are coordinately increased to facilitate changes in intracellular signaling pathways, which might accompany the TGF-β1-induced changes in matrix composition. TGF-β1-mediated changes in fibronectin matrix are known to promote the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts (42Serini G. Bochaton-Piallat M.L. Ropraz P. Geinoz A. Borsi L. Zardi L.

Cell Res. 2000; 257: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), a process, which is associated with an increase in actin stress fiber formation as well as cellular contractility. The known effects of HEF on cell shape as well as integrin function suggest that HEF1 may participate in the coordination of signals from the ECM with the cytoskeleton to effect contractile-based changes in fibroblast function during wound healing and/or tumor progression. TGF-β1-promoted increases in cellular contractility participate in wound contraction as well as enhance fibronectin matrix deposition (44Allen-Hoffman B.L. Crankshaw C.L. Mosher D.F. Mol. Cell.

During tumor progression, TGF-β1 secreted by tumor cells may have a paracrine function to stimulate tumor stroma.

Further studies will be needed to determine the role of HEF1 in mediating the effects of TGF-β1 on dermal fibroblasts. Remodeling of the tissue extracellular matrix occurs as a component of a number of physiological and pathological processes including wound healing as well as tumorigenesis. Changes in tumor stroma, including deposition of extracellular matrix, activation of fibroblasts and inflammatory cells, and recruitment of endothelial cells have been proposed to mimic steps of wound healing (1Dvorak H.F.

Constructs of promoter and first intron sequences associated with the luciferase reporter gene were used to delineate the gene sequences involved in TGF-β1 control of human COL2A1 gene transcription. Cotransfection of these DNA fragments with a TβRII/I cDNA hybrid receptor, capable of inducing a TGF-β1 dominant negative effect, showed that TGF-β1 inhibits specifically COL2A1 gene transcription in RAC by a 63-bp proximal promoter. Footprint and gel retardation analyses revealed that the TGF-β1-induced inhibition effect exerted through the 63-bp promoter sequence implies a multimeric complex that binds to the −41/−33 sequence and involves Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors. Transfection of decoy Sp-binding oligonucleotides corroborated the implication of the proximal promoter in the TGF-β1-induced inhibition of COL2A1 gene transcription. In addition, TGF-β1 was found to increase the expression of Sp3 without significant changes to its binding level, but repressed both the biosynthesis and binding activity of Sp1. In functional assays, Sp3 inhibited the 63-bp promoter activity and prevented Sp1 induction of transcription. These findings suggest that TGF-β1 inhibition of COL2A1 gene transcription in RAC is mediated by an increase of the Sp3/Sp1 ratio and by the repression of Sp1 transactivating effects on that gene.

Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Smad2 and Smad3 are direct substrates of the TGF-β1 kinase receptors and interact with Smad4 (11Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J.

By contrast with receptor-activated Smads, the inhibitory Smads appear to serve as an autoregulatory negative feedback function in cellular TGF-β1 signaling by competitive interaction with the type I TGF-β1 receptor (24Hayashi H.

Other pathways, sometimes in specific contexts, may also be implicated in TGF-β1 signaling in various cell types, such as the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (28Atfi A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and MAP kinases, including extracellular signal-activated kinase and p38 MAP kinase. For example, the p38 MAP kinase plays crucial roles in the induction by TGF-β1 of the chondrogenic phenotype in chondroblastic cells (29Nakamura K. Shirai T. Morishita S. Uchida S. Saeki-Miura K. Makishima F. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In chondrogenic ATDC5 cells, TGF-β1 induced aggrecan gene transcription through cross-talk between Smad2, extracellular signal-activated kinase 1/2, and p38 MAPK pathways (30Watanabe H. de Caestecker M.P. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14466-14473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Articular cartilage, a highly specialized connective tissue, consists of relatively few chondrocytes distributed throughout an abundant extracellular matrix, including type II, IX, and XI collagens and a large proteoglycan aggrecan (31Eyre D.R., Wu, J.J. Woods P. Kuettner K.E. Schleyerbach R. Peyron J.G. Hascal V.C. Articular Cartilage and Osteoarthritis. Raven Press, New York1992: 119-131Google Scholar). These matrix components are synthesized by chondrocytes that are responsible for the maintenance of a regulated balance between the anabolism and the catabolism of the cartilage-specific macromolecules. Extracellular matrix synthesis is controlled by several factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1 and TGF-β1, whereas its degradation may be induced by proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor-α (32Pujol J.P. Loyau G. Life Sci. 1987; 41: 1187-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33van der Kraan P.M. Vitters E.L. van Beuningen H.M. van den Berg H.M. Int. J. Exp.

Alteration of type II collagen expression, an essential phenotypic marker of cartilage, is associated with a variety of joint diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (34Ala-Kokko L.

DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In cartilage degenerative diseases, chondrocytes have been found to de-differentiate (37Nimni M. Deshmukh K. Science. 1973; 181: 751-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 38von der Mark K. Kirsch T. Nerlich A. Kuss G. Weseloh G. Gluckert K. Stoss H. Arthritis Rheum. 1992; 35: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of special interest to get insight into the molecular mechanisms that regulate type II procollagen gene (COL2A1) expression in normal and de-differentiated chondrocytes. We have previously identified a 458-bp region in the first intron that mediates enhancer activity and a 266-bp short promoter that is also responsible for high level expression of the human COL2A1gene (39Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L. Takigawa M. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27421-27438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two regions contain several C-Krox-, Sp1-, and Sp3 DNA-binding sites that modulate the in vitro transcriptional activity of this gene (39Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L. Takigawa M. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27421-27438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Ghayor C. Chadjichristos C. Herrouin J.-F. Ala-Kokko L. Suske G. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36881-36895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The Sp gene family of transcription factors consists of five members, which are referred to as Sp1–Sp5, that bind with similar affinity to GC-rich motifs (41Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 42Harrison S.M. Houzelstein D. Dunwoodie S.L. Beddington R.S.P. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 358-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Whereas Sp1, Sp2, and Sp4 are transactivators, Sp3 is generally considered as a repressor of transcription (41Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). We found that Sp1 and Sp3 from RAC nuclear extracts bound to six Sp DNA-binding sites within the −266-bpCOL2A1 promoter whereby they exert their transcriptional effects (40Ghayor C. Chadjichristos C. Herrouin J.-F. Ala-Kokko L. Suske G. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36881-36895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Concomitant overexpression of the two Sp proteins revealed that Sp3 prevented the Sp1 induction of COL2A1promoter activity. Sp1 specifically activated type II collagen neosynthesis while Sp3 inhibited it, suggesting that type II collagen-specific expression in chondrocytes is likely to depend on the Sp3/Sp1 ratio (40Ghayor C. Chadjichristos C. Herrouin J.-F. Ala-Kokko L. Suske G. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36881-36895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The TGF-β1 effect on type II collagen synthesis by chondrocytes has been found to greatly vary as a function of several experimental factors, so that already reported data may appear contradictory. For example, we previously demonstrated that TGF-β1 was capable of stimulating type II collagen expression in short-term treatment (24 h), using confluent serum-deprived monolayers of RAC (43Galéra P. Vivien D. Pronost S. Bonaventure J. Rédini F. Loyau G. Pujol J.-P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 596-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A similar effect was also reported for chondrocytes cultured in alginate beads (44Yaeger P.C. Masi T.L. de Ortiz J.L.B. Binette F. Tubo R. McPherson J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 45Qi W.-N. Scully S.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that TGF-β1 exerted an inhibitory effect on collagen synthesis in a 6-day exposure of RAC cultures (46Galéra P. Rédini F. Vivien D. Bonaventure J. Penfornis H. Loyau G. Pujol J.-P. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 379-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The TGF-β1 action on type II collagen synthesis by chondrocytes may also depend on whether the cells are fully differentiated or have undergone phenotype alteration (46Galéra P. Rédini F. Vivien D. Bonaventure J. Penfornis H. Loyau G. Pujol J.-P. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 379-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although it is now proven that TGF-β1 may exert bifunctional regulation of type II collagen expression in chondrocytes, so far little information has been gained on the molecular mechanisms underlying the cytokine control of COL2A1 transcription. Horton et al. (47Horton Jr., W.E. Higginbotham J.D. Chandrasekhar S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 141: 8-15Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) demonstrated that TGF-β1 and basic fibroblast growth factor acted in a synergistic fashion to suppress the synthesis of type II collagen on embryonic chicken sternal chondrocytes through a transcriptional control involving the intronic chondrocyte-specific enhancer of the COL2A1 gene and silencer elements present in the promoter region. This mechanism was found to be dependent on protein kinase C activation (48Bradham D.M. in der Wiesche B. Precht P. Balakir R. Horton W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, a previous report has shown that the effect of TGF-β1 on type II collagen expression, in rat articular chondrocytes, could also implicate activation of extracellular signal-activated kinases and subsequent AP-1 binding (49Miyazaki Y. Tsukazaki T. Hirota A. Yonekura M. Osaki H. Shindo H. Yamashita S. Osteoarthritis Cart. 2000; 8: 378-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The preceding data suggest that the TGF-β1 effect on type II collagen production is likely to be mediated through cis-binding sequences of the promoter and/or first intron regions of theCOL2A1 gene so far uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that TGF-β1 down-regulation of COL2A1 gene transcription implicates a region covering 63-bp upstream of the transcription start site and that this effect is dependent on the increase of the Sp3/Sp1 ratio.

The reporter plasmids (10 μg each) were cotransfected with a pSV40 β-galactosidase expression vector (2 μg) as an internal control of transfection efficiency, and/or with an expression pCMV5 vector (15 μg) with or without the cDNA encoding a hybrid TGF-β1 receptor called TβRII/I. 10–15 h after transfection, the medium was changed and the cells were incubated with or without TGF-β1 (1–3 ng/ml) in DMEM with or without 10% FCS. 24 h later, the samples were harvested and the protein content, luciferase, and β-galactosidase activities were assayed. Luciferase activity was measured on total cell extracts (kit from Promega) in a luminometer (Berthold Lumat LB 9501). β-Galactosidase activity was assayed with a colorimetric assay (51Goldberg H.

Chem. 1992; 267: 19622-19630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the protein amount was determined by the Bradford colorimetric method (Bio-Rad). Luciferase activities were normalized to transfection efficiency and protein amount and expressed in relative luciferase units (RLU) as the mean ± S.D. of three independent samples. In some experiments, reporter plasmids were also cotransfected with Sp1 and/or Sp3 expression vectors (pEVR2/Sp1 and/or pRC/CMV/Sp3, respectively) as previously described (40Ghayor C. Chadjichristos C. Herrouin J.-F. Ala-Kokko L. Suske G. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36881-36895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 52Hagen G.

In these experiments, the pSV40β-gal plasmid has not been cotransfected because Sp1 is able to increase SV40 promoter activity, because of the reported presence of several Sp1 DNA-binding motifs in this promoter (40Ghayor C. Chadjichristos C. Herrouin J.-F. Ala-Kokko L. Suske G. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36881-36895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Chondrocytes have also been incubated, in some experiments, with 100 nm mithramycin (Sigma) for 24 h, following the 10–15 h transfection period, to block Sp1 and Sp3 interaction to their respective DNA-binding sites. Decoy double-stranded oligonucleotides were transfected or added to RAC cultures in an attempt to interfere with Sp1 and Sp3 binding to their cognatecis-acting elements within the 63-bp short promoter of theCOL2A1 gene. The sequences of the −67/−30wt, −67/−30mut, −50/+1wt, −35/−15wt, −35/−15mut, Sp1mcwt, and Sp1mcmut decoy oligonucleotides are presented in Table I. These oligonucleotides were cotransfected in the RAC cultures together with the reporter constructs. In certain experiments, the decoy oligonucleotides were not transfected but simply added to the fresh culture medium with or without TGF-β1 after the overnight transfection period. After an incubation of 24 h, cell lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase, β-galactosidase activities, and protein amounts.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyTFIIDa:5′-GCAGAGCATATAAAATGAGGTAGGA-3′KROXwt:5′-CTCTGTACGCGGGGGCGGTTAGAG-3′KROX mut:5′-CTCTGTACGCGGAAGTTGTTAGAG-3′AP2:5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3′En°1wt:5′-AGCGCAGCCTGGCCCCGCCCCTGCGCCGGCA-3′En°1mut:5′-AGCGCAGCCTGGCAAAGAAACTGCGCCGGCA-3′NF-κBwt:5′-GATCCGGCTGGAAAAGTCCCCA-3′−49/−28wt:5′-TCGAAAGGGGCCGGGCGCATACG-3′−44/−19wt:5′-AGGGGCCGGGCGCATATAACGGGCG-3′−67/−30wt:5′-TTGGGCGAGTTCGCCAGCCTCGAAAGGGGCCGGGCGC-3′−67/−30mut:5′-TTGGGCGAGTTCGCCAGCATCGCCACCGGCCGGGCGC-3′−35/+1wt:5′-GGGCGCATATAACGGGCGCCGCGGCGGGGAGAAGAC-3′−35/+1mut:5′-GGGCGCAGCTAACGGGCGCCGCGGCGGGGAGAAGAC-3′−50/+1wt:5′-CCTCGAAAGGGGCCGGGCGCATATAACGGGCGCCGCGGCGGGGAGAAGACG-3′−67/+1wt:5′-GGGCGAGTTCGCCAGCCTCGAAAGGGGCCGGGCGCATATAACGGGCGCCGCGGCGGGGAGAAG-3′−35/−15wt:5′-GGCGCATATAACGGGCGCCG-3′−35/−15mut:5′-GTTTCATATAACGGTTTCCG-3′−30/−15wt:5′-TATAACGGGCGCCGCG-3′−30/−15mut:5′-TATAACTTGCGTTGCG-3′−50/+1mcwt:5′-GCCTCGAAAGGGGCCGGGCGCATATAACGGGCGCCGCGGCGGGGAGAAGACGCCTCGAAAGGGGCCGG GCGCATATAACGGGCGCCGCGGCGGGGAGAAGAC-3′Sp1mcwt:5′-CCCAGGCGGGCTCCGGGGGCGGGCGGTTCCCCAGGCGGGCTCCGGGGGCGGGCGGTTC-3′Sp1mcmut:5′-CCCAAATCTGCTCCGGGAATCTTAGGTTCCCCAAATCTGCTCCGGGAATCTTAGGTTC-3′−30/+1wt:5′-TATAACGGGCGCCGCGGCGGGGAGAAGACG-3′−15/+1wt:5′-CGGCGGGGAGAAGACG-3′−48/−32wt:5′-TCGAAAGGGGCCGGGCGATT-3′−48/−32mut:5′-TCGAAAGGAACTAGGCGATT-3′Mutation substitutions are underlined.

Thus, the pGL2-0.387kb plasmid was used to obtain a 82-bp BglII-HindIII DNA fragment (−35/+47 bp of COL2A1 gene) and a 110-bpBglII-HindIII (−63/+47 bp ofCOL2A1 gene) insert by PCR, using the following primers: sense −35α1(II), 5′-CCGGAGATCTGGCGCATATAACGGGC-3′ (BglII site in bold); sense −63α1(II), 5′-CCGGAGATCTGCGATTCGCCAG-3′ (BglII site in bold); antisense +47α1(II), 5′-CCGGAAGCTTGGAGCAGGAGGAG-3′ (HindIII site in bold). PCR conditions were 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The 82- and 110-bp BglII-HindIII fragments were then subcloned in the respective sites present in the polylinker of pGL2-basic giving, respectively, pGL2-0.082kb and pGL2-0.110kb. These reporter plasmids were sequenced to confirm the accuracy of the constructions. The reporter plasmids have been also cotransfected with a pCMV5 expression vector containing the cDNA coding for a hybrid TGF-β1 receptor called TβRII/I, which induces a dominant negative effect on growth factor signaling (53Vivien D.

To measure the specificity of Sp1 and Sp3 effects, pGL2mcSp1wt and pGL2mcSp1mut reporter plasmids, previously described, have been included in the experiments (40Ghayor C. Chadjichristos C.

In the antibody interference assays, 1 μl of anti-Sp1, anti-Sp3, anti-p50, anti-p65, anti-Smad3, anti-AP2, and anti-EGR2 antibodies (Santa Cruz) were added to each reaction mixture for 15–20 min at room temperature, then the incubation was prolonged for 15 min at 4 °C. The probe was finally added in the binding reaction and a further 15-min incubation at room temperature was performed. Then, the samples were run on a 6% polyacrylamide gel, for 2 h at 150 V, in nondenaturing conditions. For DNase I footprint experiments, the SmaI-HindIII fragment of the pGL2-0.110kb plasmid was end-labeled to its 5′ SmaI extremity. Further processing of the probe including gel purification and elution was performed as previously described (39Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L. Takigawa M. Pujol J.-P.

For Southwestern analysis, 40 μg of nuclear extracts were run on a 10% polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel in denaturing conditions. After electrotransfer, the polyvinylidene difluoride nylon membrane was processed according to the method of Singh et al. (57Singh H. Clerc R.G. Lebowitz J.H.

For quantification, the autoradiogram was scanned using a StudioScan II SI scanner (AGFA). Then, the intensity of the corresponding bands was quantified by densitometric scanning using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Total RNA was extracted as previously reported (40Ghayor C.

The reaction was performed at 42 °C for 15 min, and followed by a 5-min step at 99 °C and a 5-min step at 4 °C, using an Omni-E-Hybaid thermocycler and a PCR kit (Invitrogen).

In this report, we examined the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) in suppression of JNK and the antiapoptotic effect of t-RA and the roles of nuclear receptors in the regulation of MKP-1 by t-RA. We found that not only t-RA, but also a selective agonist of retinoic acid receptor (RAR), a selective agonist of retinoid X receptor (RXR), and a pan-agonist of RAR and RXR all induced MKP-1 at the transcriptional level. Activation of RAR was required for all of these triggering effects, but activation of RXR was required only for the RXR agonist-induced MKP-1 expression. Among the three RAR subtypes, RARα and RARγ, but not RARβ, mediated the t-RA-induced MKP-1 expression. The antiapoptotic effect of t-RA on H2O2-induced apoptosis in several cell types was correlated with the inducibility of MKP-1 by t-RA. Inhibition of MKP-1 by vanadate enhanced JNK phosphorylation and attenuated the antiapoptotic effect of t-RA. Furthermore, overexpression of MKP-1 inhibited H2O2-induced JNK phosphorylation and apoptosis. To our knowledge, this is the first to demonstrate that 1) MKP-1 is inducible by retinoids at the transcriptional level, 2) RXR and individual RAR subtypes have different roles in this process, and 3) the induced MKP-1 plays a significant role in mediating both JNK inhibition and the antiapoptotic effect of t-RA in oxidative stress.

FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2924-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). The crucial roles of retinoids in controlling cell function have been extensively investigated especially using retinoic acid (RA).1For example, RA is known to be essential for the development of kidneys (2Burrow C.R. Exp. Nephrol. 2000; 8: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and is also effective in the treatment of glomerular diseases (3Wagner J. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2001; 16: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The wide spectrum of physiological and pharmacological effects of RA is attributed to both receptor-dependent (1De-Luca L.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2924-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar) and receptor-independent mechanisms (4Kang J.X. Bell J. Beard R.L. Chandraratna R.A.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22324-22330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of target genes by RA is generally mediated by nuclear receptors: retinoic acid receptors (RARα, -β, and -γ) and retinoid X receptors (RXRα, -β, and -γ) (7Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). These receptors have different ligand specificity; e.g. RARs are activated by both all-trans-retinoic acid (t-RA) and 9-cis-RA, whereas RXRs are activated only by 9-cis-RA (7Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). After ligand binding, these receptors form homodimers or heterodimers and function as transcriptional regulators. For example, t-RA binds to RARs and activates RAR-RXR heterodimers, and the complex exerts its biological effects via binding to a particular cis element, retinoic acid response element (RARE) (8Love J.M. Gudas L.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We previously reported that t-RA inhibits hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced apoptosis of renal mesangial cells and suggested that t-RA might have a therapeutic effect on glomerulonephritis by preventing oxidant stress-induced mesangial cell injury (9Konta T., Xu, Q.

Mesangial cells exposed to H2O2undergo apoptosis via activator protein 1 (AP-1)-dependent pathways (e.g. the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-c-Jun/AP-1 pathway and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-c-Fos/AP-1 pathway) (12Ishikawa Y. Kitamura M. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1078-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). t-RA inhibits H2O2-induced apoptosis by suppression of the AP-1 pathway, at least in part, by inhibition of c-fos/c-jun expression and inactivation of JNK (10Moreno-Manzano V. Ishikawa Y. Lucio-Cazana J. Kitamura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20251-20258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear how t-RA affects the JNK pathway and whether or not t-RA modulates activation of other major mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases such as ERK and p38 MAP kinase. MAP kinases, including ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinase, are activated by upstream kinases including MEK1 and -2, and MKK3, -4, and -6 (13Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). However, once activated, MAP kinases are rapidly inactivated by the family of protein phosphatases. In particular, dual specificity protein phosphatases play crucial roles in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of MAP kinases (14Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). MAP kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1), also termed CL100, 3CH134, and ERP, is a prototypic member of the family of inducible dual specificity phosphatases (15Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). It selectively dephosphorylates tyrosine and threonine residues on MAP kinases and inactivates them. Although all three MAP kinases are potential targets of MKP-1 (16Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 17Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Recently, Lee et al. (19Lee H.-Y. Sueoka N. Hong W.-K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Claret F.X. Kurie J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1973-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) reported that serum-induced phosphorylation of JNK was inhibited by t-RA in tumor cells. This was associated with a post-translational increase in the level of MKP-1 protein (19Lee H.-Y. Sueoka N. Hong W.-K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Claret F.X. Kurie J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1973-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that induction of MKP-1 might be involved in the antiapoptotic effect of t-RA on H2O2-exposed mesangial cells, especially via inhibition of JNK phosphorylation. The aim of this investigation was to test this hypothesis. Our results show that MKP-1 was induced by t-RA, unexpectedly, at the transcriptional level. RXR and individual RAR subtypes had different roles in this process (i.e.activation of RAR, but not RXR, was required for the triggering effect; among the three RAR subtypes, RARα and RARγ, but not RARβ, mediated the t-RA-induced MKP-1 expression). Furthermore, we show that the induced MKP-1 plays a significant role in mediating both JNK inhibition and the antiapoptotic effect of t-RA. Mesangial cells (SM43) were established from isolated glomeruli of a male Sprague-Dawley rat and identified as being of the mesangial cell phenotype as described previously (20Kitamura M. Taylor S. Unwin R. Burton S. Shimizu F. Fine L.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The rat fibroblast cell line NRK49F, the canine epithelial cell line MDCK, and the human endothelial cell line ECV304 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml of penicillin G, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml of amphotericin B, and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Medium containing 1% FCS was generally used for experiments. Mesangial cells that conditionally express a wild-type MKP-1 (MKP-1/SM) and vector-transfected control cells (Control/SM) were created by transfection of SM43 cells with pMEP4-MKP1 (16Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) and pMEP4, respectively. Calcium phosphate co-precipitation was used for transfection. The established MKP-1/SM cells expressed exogenous MKP-1 under the control of the human metallothionein IIa promoter. In the presence of 5 μmcadmium sulfate (CdSO4), MKP-1/SM cells but not Control/SM cells expressed abundant MKP-1. Similarly, mesangial cells stably overexpressing RARα (RARα/SM), RARβ (RARβ/SM), and RARγ (RARγ/SM) were created by transfection of SM43 cells with LRARαSN, LRARβSN, and LRARγSN plasmids (21Collins S.J.

As a negative control, vector-transfected clones (Control/SM) were established by transfection of SM43 cells with LXSN. Overexpression of exogenous RAR receptors was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Confluent cells were preincubated in 1% FCS for 24 h, treated with t-RA (0.01 nm to 10 μm; Sigma) or 9-cis-RA (1 nm to 10 μm; Sigma) for 0.5–6 h, and subjected to Northern blot analysis. Incubation with t-RA for 1 h was generally used for induction of MKP-1 expression. In some experiments, cells were co-stimulated with t-RA (0.5 - 5 μm) and H2O2 (150 μm).

To examine effects of t-RA on the basal and H2O2-induced activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinase, confluent mesangial cells were incubated in 1% FCS for 24 h, pretreated with t-RA for 1 h and exposed to 100–200 μm H2O2 for 15 min to 1 h. Phosphorylated forms of ERKs and p38 MAP kinase were detected by Western blot analysis as described before (10Moreno-Manzano V. Ishikawa Y. Lucio-Cazana J. Kitamura M. J. Biol.

To examine the effect of t-RA on the protein level of MKP-1, confluent cells were cultured in 0.5–1% FCS for 24–48 h and stimulated with 5 μm t-RA for up to 24 h. Western blot analysis was performed using MKP-1 polyclonal antibody (V-15, sc-1199; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (35Ishikawa Y. Sugiyama H. Stylianou E. Kitamura M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2290-2296PubMed Google Scholar).

Expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a loading control. The intensity of mRNAs was evaluated quantitatively by densitometric analysis. Effects of t-RA on the stability of MKP-1 mRNA were assessed using the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D (39Nagata D. Hirata Y. Suzuki E. Kakoki M. Hayakawa H. Goto A. Ishimitsu T. Minamino N.

In brief, mesangial cells were treated with or without t-RA (1 μm) for 1 h in the presence of actinomycin D (5 μg/ml; Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) for the last 0–60 min. Northern blot analysis was performed to examine the level of MKP-1 mRNA, as described above. Cells were pretreated with or without t-RA (5 μm) for 1–2 h and stimulated by H2O2 (200–500 μm) for 16–24 h. To examine roles of phosphatases in the antiapoptotic effect of t-RA, cells were pretreated with or without the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (vanadate; 100 μm, Sigma) for 1 h, treated with t-RA for 1 h, and stimulated by H2O2 for 6–12 h. Apoptosis was assessed quantitatively, as described before (10Moreno-Manzano V. Ishikawa Y. Lucio-Cazana J. Kitamura M. J. Biol.

In brief, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, stained by Hoechst 33258 (10 μg/ml; Sigma) for 1 h, and subjected to fluorescence microscopy. Apoptosis was identified using morphological criteria (i.e.nuclear condensation and/or fragmentation). Both attached cells and detached cells were used for evaluation. Mesangial cells cultured in 24-well plates were co-transfected with pBPSTR1MKP-1 (38Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) encoding MKP-1 or a control plasmid pBabe-puro (41Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar) (500 ng/well, respectively) together with pCI-βGal (170 ng/well) encoding β-galactosidase (a gift from Promega (Madison, WI)). After incubation overnight, medium was replaced with 1% FCS. After 24 h, cells were treated with H2O2 (250–300 μm, 6 h) and subjected to 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) assay (42Kitamura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7387-7391Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The percentage of shrunk/rounded blue cells against the total number of blue cells was calculated for each well, and the mean value of four wells was used to compare data in different groups. To further confirm the role of MKP-1 in apoptosis, another set of experiments were performed using pSG5-MKP1 encoding a wild-type MKP-1 and pSG5-MKP-1CS encoding a catalytically inactive MKP-1 (18Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Data were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test to compare data in different groups.p value of <0.05 was used to indicate a statistically significant difference. We previously reported that H2O2-induced apoptosis in mesangial cells was mediated by JNK and ERK but not p38 MAP kinase (10Moreno-Manzano V. Ishikawa Y. Lucio-Cazana J. Kitamura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20251-20258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Ishikawa Y. Kitamura M. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1078-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We also found that this apoptotic process was suppressed by t-RA via suppression of JNK (10Moreno-Manzano V. Ishikawa Y. Lucio-Cazana J. Kitamura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20251-20258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Based on these previous data, we first examined whether or not t-RA affects other MAP kinases including ERK and p38 MAP kinases. Mesangial cells were pretreated with or without 5 μmt-RA, stimulated by H2O2 for up to 30 min, and subjected to kinase assays. As we have previously shown (10Moreno-Manzano V. Ishikawa Y. Lucio-Cazana J. Kitamura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20251-20258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), activation of JNK by H2O2 was markedly suppressed by the treatment with t-RA (Fig.1 A). Similarly, activation of p38 MAP kinase by H2O2 was also attenuated by t-RA (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, t-RA triggered basal activity of ERK and enhanced H2O2-induced ERK activation (Fig. 1 C). MKP-1 is a prototypic member of the family of inducible dual specificity phosphatases (15Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) and preferentially inactivates JNK and p38 MAP kinase (16Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 43Slack D.N. Seternes O.M. Gabrielsen M. Keyse S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16491-16500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A previous report showed that, in some cancer cells, MKP-1 protein was increased by t-RA through a post-translational mechanism (19Lee H.-Y. Sueoka N. Hong W.-K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Claret F.X. Kurie J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1973-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To examine whether the suppression of MAP kinases by t-RA is mediated by MKP-1, we tested the level of MKP-1 protein in t-RA-exposed mesangial cells. Mesangial cells were treated with t-RA for up to 24 h, and Western blot analysis was performed. As shown in Fig.2 A, t-RA transiently increased the level of MKP-1 protein with a peak at 3–6 h. This induction was closely correlated with the preceding, transient increase of MKP-1 mRNA (i.e. the level of MKP-1 mRNA was significantly increased within 30 min, peaked to maximum at 1 h, and returned to the prestimulation level after 6 h (Fig. 2 B)). These data suggested that the induction of MKP-1 by t-RA occurs at the transcriptional level in mesangial cells. We next examined the dose-dependent effect of t-RA on the level of MKP-1 mRNA. As shown in Fig.3 A, the stimulatory effect of t-RA was observed with a wide range of concentrations at 1 nm to 10 μm. The maximum effect was observed at concentrations between 100 nm and 1 μm. MKP-1 mRNA is known to be induced by H2O2(15Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of t-RA on MKP-1 was further tested in the presence of H2O2. Cells were treated with 0–5 μm t-RA for 2 h and stimulated by H2O2 for an additional 2 h. Northern analysis showed that MKP-1 was modestly induced by H2O2, and the induction was further enhanced by the treatment with t-RA (Fig. 3 B). The up-regulation of the MKP-1 mRNA level by t-RA may be caused by transcriptional induction or increased stability of the transcript. To test the latter, the effect of t-RA on the stability of MKP-1 mRNA was examined using the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D. Mesangial cells were treated with or without t-RA for 1 h in the presence of actinomycin D for the last 0–60 min. Northern blot analysis showed that MKP-1 mRNA was rapidly degraded in the presence of actinomycin D, and treatment with t-RA did not affect the half-life of MKP-1 mRNA (Fig. 4 A). The half-lives calculated were as follows: 34 min in untreated cells and 36 min in t-RA-treated cells (Fig. 4 B). Induction of MKP-1 mRNA by t-RA was not mediated by de novo synthesis of proteins, because blockade of translation using cycloheximide did not prevent but rather enhanced t-RA-induced MKP-1 expression (Fig.4 C). The increase in the level of MKP-1 mRNA by cycloheximide is similar to induction of other immediate early genes, c-fos and c-myc (44Greenberg M.E. Hermanowski A.L. Ziff E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1050-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), by this agent. We found that rat mesangial cells constitutively expressed all RAR and RXR subtypes. Expression of RARγ and RXRα was found to be most abundant, and the level of RARα was moderate (Fig.5 A). RARβ, RXRβ, and RXRγ (data not shown) were expressed only weakly. The expression level of RXRα was not significantly affected by t-RA. In contrast, expression of RARβ and RARγ was substantially induced by t-RA with a peak at 3 and 6 h, respectively (Fig. 5 B). Expression of RARα was also slightly induced within 6 h after the stimulation with t-RA. The roles of RAR and RXR in the regulation of MKP-1 by t-RA were examined using RAR agonist TTNPB and RXR agonist AGN194204. As shown in Fig. 6, A andB, both agonists significantly increased the expression of MKP-1 dose-dependently. The minimum effective dosages were 1 and 10 nm, respectively. TTNPB binds to RAR selectively at concentrations up to 10 μm (24Agarwal C. Chandraratna R.A. Johnson A.T. Rorke E.A. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12209-12212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and AGN194204 selectively binds to RXR at concentrations up to 30 μm (25Vuligonda V. Thacher S.M. Chandraratna R.A. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 2298-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Based on these, activation of either RAR or RXR can induce MKP-1 expression. The roles of RAR and RXR in the t-RA-induced expression of MKP-1 were further tested using RAR antagonist AGN193109 and RXR antagonist HX531. Cells were pretreated with or without these antagonists for 10 min and then stimulated by t-RA, 9-cis-RA, and AGN194204, respectively. Northern blot analysis showed that the induction of MKP-1 by t-RA, 9-cis-RA, and AGN194204 was abrogated by the treatment with RAR antagonist AGN193109. In contrast, RXR antagonist HX531 did not affect the MKP-1 induction by t-RA and 9-cis-RA but completely prevented AGN194204-induced MKP-1 expression (Fig. 6, C–E). The effect of AGN193109 observed here is due to specific suppression of RAR, because both basal and H2O2-/serum-induced expression of MKP-1 mRNA was not obviously affected by AGN193109 (Fig.6 F). Since RAR is required for the retinoid-induced MKP-1 expression, we further examined roles of RAR subtypes in the regulation of MKP-1. Am580 and CD666 are known to be specific RARα and RARγ agonists at concentrations of ≤1 nm (45Taneja R. Roy B. Plassat J.L. Zusi C.F. Ostrowski J. Reczek P.R. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2315879546,"Human pancreatic cancers harbor mutations in the K-ras gene, and these mutations convert the gene oncogenic and constitutively active forms. However, in pancreatic cancer cells little is known about the activation of the downstream pathways of Ras, MEK-ERK and MEKK1-JNK, and their roles in cell survival and proliferation. An analysis of nine pancreatic cancer tissues revealed JNK activation in all tumor samples and ERK activation in three tumor samples. Colony formation assays by transfection of dominant negative mutants of Ras, ERK or MEKK1 into pancreatic cancer cell lines (BxPC-3, PANC-1, MIAPaCa-2 and AsPC-1) and an amnion-derived cell line (FL) revealed that DN-MEKK strongly inhibits the survival of colonies in pancreatic cancer cells, but not in FL cells. In vitro kinase assays and luciferase assays using the Gal4c-Jun system revealed that in pancreatic cancer cells DN-MEKK fails to inhibit JNK activation. In PANC-1 cells, c-Jun was found to be a major component of protein component binding to AP-1 site and CRE, but not in FL cells. The inhibitory effect of DN-MEKK in PANC-1 cells was thought to be the result of the inhibition of c-Jun DNA-binding. The difference of suppression in pancreatic cancer cells and non-pancreatic cancer cells suggested that the MEKK1 pathway mainly contributes to cell survival in pancreatic cancer cells and may provide an advantage for the gene therapy of pancreatic cancers using DN-MEKK expression vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2022957695,"The integrins α2β1 and α1β1 have been shown to modulate cellular activities of fibroblasts on contact with fibrillar collagen. Previously it has been shown that collagen binding to α2β1 regulates matrix metalloproteinase MMP-1 and membrane-type MT1-MMP expression. Jararhagin is a snake venom metalloproteinase of the Reprolysin family of zinc metalloproteinases, containing a metalloproteinase domain followed by disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains. Jararhagin blocks type I collagen-induced platelet aggregation by binding to the α2β1integrin and inhibiting collagen-mediated intracellular signaling events. Here we present evidence that, in contrast to the observations in platelets, jararhagin binding to the integrin receptor α2β1 in fibroblasts produces collagen-like cell signaling events such as up-regulation of MMP-1 and MT1-MMP. Inactivation of the metalloproteinase domain had no effect on these properties of jararhagin. Thus, in fibroblasts the snake venom metalloproteinase jararhagin functions as a collagen-mimetic substrate that binds to and activates integrins. Given the homology between the metalloproteinase, disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains of jararhagin and those of the members of the ADAMs (adisintegrin-like andmetalloproteinase) family of proteins, this work demonstrates the potential of the disintegrin-like/cysteine-rich domains in the ADAMs as cellular signaling agents to elicit responses relevant to the biological function of these proteins.

Several studies have localized the binding site for collagen within the I-domain of the α-chain integrin subunit. The I-domain is composed of about 200 amino acids and shares homology with the von Willebrand factor A domain (4Hughes A.L. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1992; 9: 216-234Google Scholar, 5Eble J.A. Golbik R.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1427-1436Google Scholar) and is responsible for the induction of MMP-1 synthesis (14Langholz O. Roeckel D. Mauch C. Kozlowska E. Bank I. Krieg T. Eckes B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1903-1915Google Scholar, 15Riikonen T. Westermarck J. Koivisto L. Broberg A. Kähäri V.-M. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13548-13552Google Scholar). The down-regulation of type I collagen synthesis in this system was due to collagen binding to the α1β1 integrin (14Langholz O. Roeckel D. Mauch C. Kozlowska E. Bank I. Krieg T. Eckes B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1903-1915Google Scholar). Recently, we observed that, in addition to MMP-1, MT1-MMP is also induced on both the mRNA and protein levels by the ligation of the α2β1 integrin receptor with fibrillar collagen (16Zigrino P. Drescher C. Mauch C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 68-77Google Scholar). The synthesis of the α2β1integrin was found to be up-regulated in collagen lattices, whereas the expression of other collagen integrin receptors, such as α1β1 and α3β1, was not affected (13Klein C.E. Dressel D. Steinmayer T. Mauch C. Eckes B. Krieg T. Bankert R.B. Weber L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1427-1436Google Scholar). The snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) are members of the Reprolysin family (M13) of metalloproteinases. The ADAMs (adisintegrin-like andmetalloproteinase)/MDC (metalloproteinase,disintegrin, cysteine-rich) group of proteins are also members of the Reprolysin family (17Fox J.W. Long C. Bailey G. Snake Venom Enzymes. Alaken Press, Ft. Collins, CO1998: 151-178Google Scholar). The PIII class of SVMPs and the ADAMs share homologous metalloproteinase, disintegrin, and cysteine-rich domains (18Jia L.-G. Shimokawa K.-I. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J. Toxicon. 1996; 34: 1269-1276Google Scholar). Based on these similarities, the SVMPs have served as early models for ADAM function. The PIII SVMPs have been demonstrated to be capable of proteolytically degrading extracellular matrix and inhibiting platelet aggregation by blocking collagen binding to the α2β1 integrin on platelets (17Fox J.W. Long C. Bailey G. Snake Venom Enzymes. Alaken Press, Ft. Collins, CO1998: 151-178Google Scholar). Jararhagin, a hemorrhagic metalloproteinase from Bothrops jararaca, is one of the main venom components responsible for the local and systemic hemorrhage observed in envenomed humans (19Paine M.J.I. Desmond H.P. Theakston R.D.G. Crampton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22869-22876Google Scholar). Jararhagin has been shown to degrade components of the basement membrane of the microvasculature and some plasma proteins important for hemostasis (20Kamiguti A.S. Hay C.R.M. Theakston R.D.G. Zuzel M. Toxicon. 1996; 34: 627-642Google Scholar, 21Hati R. Mitra P. Sarker S. Bhattacharyya K.K. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1999; 29: 1-19Google Scholar). Furthermore, it synergizes hemorrhage by inhibiting collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation (22Kamiguti A.S. Markland F.S. Zhou Q. Laing G.D. Theakston R.D.G. Zuzel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32599-32605Google Scholar). In the venom, the metalloproteinase domain of jararhagin is often proteolytically processed generating jararhagin-C, a fragment representing the disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains of jararhagin. The α2β1 integrin can also interact with jararhagin-C, but the interaction seems to be weaker than with jararhagin (23De Luca M. Ward C.M. Ohmori K. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 570-576Google Scholar), suggesting that additional N-terminal structures might be involved in jararhagin-α2β1 binding. Interestingly, synthetic peptides based on a sequence in the metalloproteinase domain of jararhagin have been shown to bind to the I-domain of the recombinant α2 integrin chain thereby preventing the binding of the α2-I domain to collagens I and IV, and to laminin-1 (24Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pentikäinen O. Hoffren A.-M. Hermonen J. Huttunen P. Johnson M.S. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3513-3521Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the ability of jararhagin to mimic fibrillar collagen interaction with fibroblasts to modulate the expression of the integrin α2β1 and the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1 and MT1-MMP. In contrast to previous studies performed in platelets, jararhagin binding to fibroblasts led to cellular activities similar to those induced by fibrillar type I collagen binding via the α2β1 integrin. These results suggest that other disintegrin-like/cysteine-rich domain-containing proteins, such as the ADAMs, may be capable of not only binding to integrins, as has been shown, but also signaling via integrins to alter cellular events such as gene and protein expression. The following antibodies were used: function blocking mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against the β1 (4B4; Coulter Corporation), α2 (P1E6; BIOMOL), and α3 (BIOMOL) integrin chains; monospecific mouse antibodies to MT1-MMP were raised against a peptide corresponding to the residues 160–173 of human MT1-MMP (114–1F2; Fuji Chemicals). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human MMP-1 were kindly provided by Dr. P. Angel (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany). Function-blocking mouse antibodies raised against the human α1 integrin chain, mouse antibodies against human HLA-ABC, and antibodies directed against the β1 integrin subunit antibodies used for immunoblotting were from Chemicon. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against jararhagin were a kind gift from Dr. R. D. G. Theakston (Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, UK). Jararhagin was purified from the venom of B. jararaca as previously described (19Paine M.J.I. Desmond H.P. Theakston R.D.G. Crampton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22869-22876Google Scholar). Inactivation of proteolytic activity was performed by a 5-min treatment with 5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline at 37 °C (25Kamiguti A.S. Hay C.R.M. Zuzel M. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 635-641Google Scholar). Human dermal fibroblasts obtained by outgrowth from explants were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Fibroblasts were used at passages 1–9. Three-dimensional collagen gels were prepared as described previously (9Mauch C. Hatamochi A. Scharffetter K. Krieg T. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 178: 493-503Google Scholar). Briefly, type I collagen (3 mg/ml, Vitrogen) and 10× DMEM were combined in a 10:1 ratio and neutralized by the addition of 0.1 m NaOH. Fibroblasts were seeded into collagen gels at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml and incubated at 37 °C. Alternatively, suspensions of fibroblasts were preincubated with jararhagin, 100 nm, for 20 min at 37 °C before seeding into collagen gels. Rates of gel contraction were monitored by determining the remaining surface area. For integrin binding experiments, cells were detached from confluent monolayer cultures by trypsinization, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in growth medium. Before seeding onto tissue culture plastic plates, the cells were preincubated in the presence of different concentrations of antibodies for 20 min at 37 °C. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. To detect α2 integrin, fibroblasts were cultured on chamber slides. After 48 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed with cold acetone. Staining was performed with rabbit anti-α2 antibodies against the cytoplasmic domain of the protein (Chemicon) overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 4% BSA, followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit-Cy3 antibodies (1:400 in PBS/2% BSA, Dianova) for 1 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber. Omission of the first antibody was used as a negative control. Semi-confluent fibroblast monolayer cultures were trypsinized, and the cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in DMEM containing 0.5% BSA and insulin, transferrin, and sodium selenite at concentrations as recommended by the manufacturer (Sigma). For competition assays, antibodies were added to the cell suspension before plating. Adhesion assays were performed as previously described (26Zigrino P. Gaietta G. Zambonin Zallone A. Pelletier A.J. Quaranta V. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 51-58Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 100 μl of active or 1,10-phenanthroline-inactivated jararhagin (4 μg/ml), monomeric collagen type I (40 μg/ml), or 50% FCS at 4 °C overnight. BSA coating and blockage of nonspecific binding sites were performed by 1-h incubation with heat-denatured BSA (1% BSA in Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS) at room temperature. After washing the wells twice, cells (2 × 104 cells/well) were seeded and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing twice with PBS, and adherent cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.6, and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% (v/v) methanol. The dye was released from the cells by addition of 0.1 m sodium citrate in 50% (v/v) ethanol. The optical density of the released dye solution was determined at 595 nm. Values were calculated relative to the values obtained for the control assays (FCS or jararhagin pre-coated plates), which were arbitrarily set as 100%. Statistical analysis was performed with the ANOVA Dunnett multiple comparison test. Recombinant soluble human integrin α2β1 ectodomain heterodimers were prepared in insect cells using an expression plasmid in which the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains were replaced by Fos and Jun dimerization motifs as described previously (27Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W. Gauthier L. Dersch P. Krukonis E. Isberg R.R. Hemler M.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10945-10955Google Scholar). Microtiter plates were coated with jararhagin and bovine type I collagen at concentrations of 4 and 40 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 3 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 macetic acid. After overnight incubation, the wells were blocked with heat-denatured BSA and incubated with 6 μg/ml soluble α2β1 integrin in the absence or presence of 10 mm EDTA for 2 h at room temperature. Then the wells were washed twice, and substrate-bound integrin was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a rabbit anti-human β1 integrin antiserum and alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG antibodies as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. para-Nitrophenylphosphate was used as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay substrate with the product measured at 405 nm. Each value was measured in duplicate, and standard deviations were calculated. For preparation of crude plasma membranes, cells were washed twice with PBS and scraped off the plates with PBS containing the protease inhibitors aprotinin (10 μg/ml), Pefabloc (0.25 mg/ml), and leupeptin (1 μg/ml). Cell suspensions were subjected to three cycles of freeze-thaw in a dry ice-ethanol/37 °C bath, and cell lysis was confirmed microscopically. Lysates were separated from cell nuclei by centrifugation at 500 × g. Then the supernatant was centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The crude plasma membranes were washed once with PBS/inhibitors and, after centrifugation, resuspended in PBS. For preparation of total lysates, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using a commercial assay (Bio-Rad). For Western blotting, equal amounts of protein from the membrane preparations, lysates, or conditioned media were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and transferred onto Hybond-C Super™ (Amersham Biosciences). After blockage of nonspecific binding sites with 5% skimmed milk in PBS containing 0.5% Tween (v/v), the blots were incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Bound primary antibodies were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000, Dako) and visualized with the ECL system (ECL™, Amersham Biosciences). Purified jararhagin was biotin-conjugated with biotin-XX sulfosuccinimidyl ester. Labeling and purification of biotin-labeled jararhagin were performed using the FluoReporter® Mini-Biotin-XX protein labeling kit (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). The ability of jararhagin to displace bound, biotinylated jararhagin from fibroblasts was assayed by incubating fibroblasts in the presence of biotinylated jararhagin for 24 h followed by incubation with varying concentrations of unlabeled jararhagin for an additional 24 h. Cell surface binding of total jararhagin (jararhagin and biotinylated jararhagin) and biotinylated jararhagin after the 48 h treatment was determined by Western blotting of cell lysates prepared by washing twice with cold PBS and direct lysis in reducing sample buffer. After blotting, membranes were incubated with anti-jararhagin antibodies (for visualization of total jararhagin bound) or with extravidin®-peroxidase (for visualization of only biotinylated jararhagin) (1:1000, Sigma) for 1 h and detected as above described. Cells were cultured as monolayers with or without jararhagin stimulation. At different time points, media were collected and separated (20 μl/lane) on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/ml bovine gelatin (Sigma). Then gels were washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min followed by an overnight incubation in metalloproteinase substrate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm CaCl2) (28Howard E.W. Bullen E. Banda M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13064-13069Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 and then destained in water. Total RNA was isolated by direct lysis of the cells in guanidine thiocyanate followed by phenol-chloroform extraction (29Chomezynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Total RNA (5 μg) was resolved in formaldehyde/agarose gels, blotted onto Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with random-primed32P-labeled cDNA probes for MT1-MMP (30Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Google Scholar), MMP-1 (31Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Dellus H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2256-2266Google Scholar), and the α2 integrin chain (32Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1524-1526Google Scholar). Fibroblasts showed similar adhesion levels to jararhagin- and type I collagen-coated dishes (Fig.1 A). No significant difference was observed between fibroblast adhesion to jararhagin or 1,10-phenanthroline-inactivated jararhagin. As shown in Fig.1 B, cell adhesion to jararhagin was reduced by ∼30% in the presence of blocking antibodies directed against the α2 or β1 integrin subunits; whereas no inhibition was noticed with other function-blocking antibodies directed against α1 or α3 integrins, which both can serve as collagen receptors (2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 9: 11-25Google Scholar). Using a combination of both the α2 and β1 antibodies, cell adhesion to jararhagin was inhibited by up to ∼60% in a dose-dependent manner. When fibroblasts were pre-treated with jararhagin followed by incubation of the cells within collagen lattices there was a notable delay of lattice contraction (Fig. 2). At 24 h untreated fibroblasts contracted the gels to ∼30% of the initial surface area. However, in the presence of 100 nmjararhagin, similar levels of contraction were not observed until 48 h. Cell viability was comparable in treated and untreated fibroblast cultures. Because contraction of fibrillar collagen type I lattices has been shown to be mediated by the integrin α2β1 (12Chan B.M. Matsuura N. Takada Y. Zetter B.R. Hemler M.E. Science. 1991; 251: 1600-1602Google Scholar, 13Klein C.E. Dressel D. Steinmayer T. Mauch C. Eckes B. Krieg T. Bankert R.B. Weber L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1427-1436Google Scholar, 14Langholz O. Roeckel D. Mauch C. Kozlowska E. Bank I. Krieg T. Eckes B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1903-1915Google Scholar), these results suggest that jararhagin delays the contraction by interfering with the α2β1-collagen interaction. Previous studies have shown that binding of the α2β1 integrin on platelets by PIII snake venom metalloproteinases results in an inhibition of the signaling events normally induced in collagen-stimulated platelets coupled with a potent inhibition of platelet aggregation (22Kamiguti A.S. Markland F.S. Zhou Q. Laing G.D. Theakston R.D.G. Zuzel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32599-32605Google Scholar, 23De Luca M. Ward C.M. Ohmori K. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 570-576Google Scholar). To determine whether jararhagin binds to cell surface proteins, both supernatants and crude fibroblast membranes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE after 24 and 48 h of incubation with jararhagin (Fig.3). Immunoblotting using a jararhagin-specific antibody detected a band of 55 kDa indicating the presence of jararhagin in the cell culture supernatants. An additional band of ∼33 kDa likely represents the proteolytic degradation fragment of jararhagin comprising the disintegrin-like/cysteine-rich domains (jararhagin-C) (Fig. 3 A). In membranes isolated at 24 h, a weakly stained 55-kDa band corresponding to intact jararhagin was detected. The intensity of this band was significantly increased at 48 h (Fig. 3 B). The additional band of 52 kDa might represent unreduced jararhagin or a proteolytically processed form (13Klein C.E. Dressel D. Steinmayer T. Mauch C. Eckes B. Krieg T. Bankert R.B. Weber L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1427-1436Google Scholar). Additionally, these data suggest that jararhagin binding to cell surface proteins on fibroblasts offers protection from proteolytic degradation at the site producing jararhagin-C. An assay was performed to demonstrate the specificity of binding of jararhagin to the cell surface. In these experiments, unlabeled jararhagin was used to displace biotinylated jararhagin from the cell surface of fibroblasts. As shown in Fig.4 A, unlabeled jararhagin is able to displace the cell-surface-associated biotinylated jararhagin in a concentration-dependent manner. In Fig. 4 B, the soluble ectodomain of the integrin α2β1 binds to immobilized jararhagin. However, in contrast to collagen type I, the binding of the soluble α2β1 receptor to jararhagin did not seem to be dependent upon the presence of divalent cations. This suggests the possibility of one or more different binding sites for jararhagin than that for collagen on the receptor molecule. After 24 and 48 h of growth in collagen lattices, total RNA was isolated from fibroblasts pre-treated with 100 nmjararhagin, and the transcript levels for MMP-1 and MT1-MMP were assessed by Northern blot analysis (Fig.5). Control fibroblasts grown in collagen gels showed increased transcript levels for MT1-MMP and MMP-1 at 24 h with a further increase at 48 h culture. At both time points, pre-treatment with jararhagin did not result in significant differences of these transcript levels from those observed in the untreated cells. In addition, there was a similar increase in integrin α2 mRNA level from both untreated and jararhagin-treated fibroblasts. Therefore, pre-treatment of fibroblasts with jararhagin had no apparent effect on fibroblasts grown within collagen lattices. Analysis of fibroblast cell morphology following treatment with increasing concentrations of jararhagin showed a characteristic elongated shape with protrusions of cell extensions identical to that reported for fibroblasts grown in collagen gels (9Mauch C. Hatamochi A. Scharffetter K. Krieg T. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 178: 493-503Google Scholar). Untreated fibroblasts maintained their characteristic spindle-like morphology with a flattened cell shape (Fig.6). In contrast to fibroblast growth in collagen lattices, in which no significant alterations could be detected, in monolayer cultures treatment with jararhagin produced significant differences as shown in Fig. 5. In monolayer cultures, only very low levels of MT1-MMP and MMP-1 transcripts were observed. However, fibroblasts pre-treated with jararhagin displayed a strong induction of MT1-MMP and MMP-1 mRNA expression together with increased α2-integrin transcript levels. These increases were apparent at 24 h, and by 48 h the increases were comparable to those obtained with fibroblasts cultured within collagen lattices. In addition, the induction of MMP mRNA levels was found to be concentration-dependent, showing maximal stimulation when the cells were pre-treated with 200 nm jararhagin (Fig. 7). To test whether the metalloproteinase activity of jararhagin is required for the induction of MMP-1 and MT1-MMP expression, monolayer cultures of fibroblasts were treated with active or 1,10-phenanthroline-inactivated jararhagin (22Kamiguti A.S. Markland F.S. Zhou Q. Laing G.D. Theakston R.D.G. Zuzel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32599-32605Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.8, treatment of fibroblasts with proteolytically inactive jararhagin resulted in no significant differences in MMP-1 and MT1-MMP mRNA levels when compared with fibroblasts treated with active jararhagin. The apparent slight reduction of the mRNA levels observed after treatment with inactivated jararhagin was due to the presence of the general metalloproteinase inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline as shown by the control fibroblast treatment with 1,10-phenanthroline. Western blot analysis of MT1-MMP in crude membrane preparations from cells treated with jararhagin displayed increased levels of the active 60-kDa MT1-MMP protein form at 24 h as well as at 48 h as compared with untreated fibroblasts (Fig. 9 A). A low level of an additional immunoreactive protein of 63-kDa band corresponding to the unprocessed zymogen was also detected (33Lehti K. Lohi J. Valtanen H. Keski-Oja J. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 345-353Google Scholar, 34Kurschat P. Zigrino P. Nischt R. Breitkopf K. Steurer P. Klein E.C. Krieg T. Mauch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21056-21062Google Scholar). This increase in MT1-MMP production in treated monolayer culture was paralleled by enhanced pro-MMP-2 activation as indicated by the appearance of the 62/59-kDa forms correspondent to the active enzyme (Fig. 9 B). Analysis of MMP-1 protein in supernatants of cells treated with jararhagin showed increased inactive MMP-1 forms, 52/57 kDa, as well as appearance of active MMP-1, 42/47 kDa, at both 24 and 48 h treatment (Fig. 9 C). We also assessed the possibility that the proteolytic activity of jararhagin might be directly involved in MT1-MMP and pro-MMP-2 activation. Treatment of cell membranes, prepared from an MT1-MMP-stable expressing cell line containing only the pro-form of MT1-MMP (34Kurschat P. Zigrino P. Nischt R. Breitkopf K. Steurer P. Klein E.C. Krieg T. Mauch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21056-21062Google Scholar) with jararhagin, did not result in activation of pro-MT1-MMP (data not shown). In addition, treatment of media containing pro-MMP-2 with jararhagin also failed to show activation of the zymogen (data not shown). These observations suggest that neither the activation of pro-MT1-MMP nor the activation of pro-MMP-2 was a result of the proteolytic activity of jararhagin. As shown above, jararhagin did not block the α2β1-induced MMP-1 and MT1-MMP up-regulation in fibroblasts grown in collagen lattices. Surprisingly, in monolayer cultures, the addition of jararhagin resulted in increased transcript levels for the α2-integrin subunit and MMP-1 and MT1-MMP indicating an activation rather than inhibition of this integrin receptor. It has been demonstrated that fibroblasts grown in collagen lattices respond with an up-regulation the α2β1 integrin expression, whereas there is no up-regulation when fibroblasts are grown as monolayers (16Zigrino P. Drescher C. Mauch C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 68-77Google Scholar). Treatment of fibroblasts with jararhagin followed by growth as monolayers caused a significant increase of α2β1-integrin immunostaining, whereas no specific staining was detected in untreated monolayer cultures (Fig.10 A). Western blot analysis of the α2 integrin subunit in cells treated with jararhagin displayed slightly increased protein levels at 24 h followed by a significant increase at 48 h treatment (Fig.10 B). The observed increase in α2 integrin levels displayed on the cell surfac"
https://openalex.org/W2322926939,"In mammalian cells homologous recombination is stimulated, when the replication fork stalls at DNA breaks or unrepaired lesions. The tumor suppressor p53 downregulates homologous recombination independently of its transcriptional transactivation function and has been linked to enzymes of DNA recombination and replication. To study recombination with respect to replication, we utilized a SV40 virus based assay, to follow the synchronous events after primate cell infection. gamma-ray treatment at different times after viral entry unveiled an increase of interchromosomal exchange frequencies, when the damage was introduced during DNA synthesis. Elevated recombination frequencies were fully suppressed by p53. With respect to the downregulation of spontaneous recombination, we noticed a requirement for active p53 molecules, when replication started. After a transient treatment with replication inhibitors, we observed inhibition of the drug induced recombination by p53, particularly for the elongation inhibitor aphidicolin. Consequently, we propose that p53 is a surveillance factor of homologous recombination at replication forks, when they stall as a consequence of endogenous or of exogenously introduced damage."
https://openalex.org/W1971400230,"Neuroblastoma (Nb) is a malignancy of the sympathetic nervous system which affects children in their first decade. It is the most common extra-cranial solid tumor in children with an incidence of approximately 1 in 8-10 000 live births annually and accounts for approximately 10% of all children's cancers. Ganglioneuroblastoma is a relatively benign form of Nb and consists of a mixture of fibrils, mature and maturing ganglion cells, as well as undifferentiated neuroblasts. During routine cytogenetic analysis of patients with different manifestations of neuroblastoma we have identified one patient with ganglioneuroblastoma that carries an apparently balanced t(1:13)(q21:q12) reciprocal translocation. Positional cloning of the translocation breakpoint on chromosome 13 resulted in the mapping of the breakpoint between coding exon 2 and exon 3 of WAVE3, a member of WASP gene family. Although the breakpoint region on chromosome 1 was localized to within 2 kb of genomic sequence, no gene was found to be interrupted on this chromosome. The WAVE3 transcript is mainly expressed in the nervous system and, like all the members of the WASP gene family, WAVE3 is a key element in actin polymerization and cytoskeleton organization. WAVE3, therefore, is important for cell differentiation and motility and its expression is lost in a number of low grade and stage 4S tumors. From analysis of its expression pattern and function, WAVE3 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene, at least in some forms of neuroblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2036996408,"Angiotensin II (Ang II) and adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulate aldosterone biosynthesis in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex through induction of the expression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, which promotes intramitochondrial cholesterol transfer. To understand the mechanism of this induction of the StAR protein, we have examined the effect of Ang II and forskolin, a mimicker of adrenocorticotropic hormone action, on two transcription factors known to modulate StARgene expression in opposite ways, DAX-1 and SF-1, in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells in primary culture. Ang II markedly inhibited DAX-1 protein expression in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (to 38.7 ± 12.9% of controls at 3 nm after 6 h, p < 0.01), an effect that required de novo protein synthesis and ERK2/1 activation. This effect was associated with a concomitant decrease in DAX-1 mRNA and an increase in mitochondrial StAR protein levels. Similarly, forskolin dramatically repressed DAX-1 protein and mRNA expression (to 19.6 ± 1.8 and 50.3 ± 4.7% of controls, respectively,p < 0.01). Neither Ang II nor forskolin affected DAX-1 protein and mRNA stability. The aldosterone response to Ang II was markedly reduced (to 59 ± 4% of controls,p < 0.01) in transiently transfected cells overexpressing DAX-1. Whereas Ang II was without effect on SF-1 expression, forskolin significantly increased SF-1 protein and mRNA levels in a cycloheximide-sensitive manner (to 167.4 ± 16.6 and 173.1 ± 25.1% of controls after 6 h, respectively,p < 0.01). These results demonstrate that the balance between repressor and inducer function of DAX-1 and SF-1 are of critical importance in the regulation of adrenal aldosterone biosynthesis. Angiotensin II (Ang II) and adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulate aldosterone biosynthesis in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex through induction of the expression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, which promotes intramitochondrial cholesterol transfer. To understand the mechanism of this induction of the StAR protein, we have examined the effect of Ang II and forskolin, a mimicker of adrenocorticotropic hormone action, on two transcription factors known to modulate StARgene expression in opposite ways, DAX-1 and SF-1, in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells in primary culture. Ang II markedly inhibited DAX-1 protein expression in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (to 38.7 ± 12.9% of controls at 3 nm after 6 h, p < 0.01), an effect that required de novo protein synthesis and ERK2/1 activation. This effect was associated with a concomitant decrease in DAX-1 mRNA and an increase in mitochondrial StAR protein levels. Similarly, forskolin dramatically repressed DAX-1 protein and mRNA expression (to 19.6 ± 1.8 and 50.3 ± 4.7% of controls, respectively,p < 0.01). Neither Ang II nor forskolin affected DAX-1 protein and mRNA stability. The aldosterone response to Ang II was markedly reduced (to 59 ± 4% of controls,p < 0.01) in transiently transfected cells overexpressing DAX-1. Whereas Ang II was without effect on SF-1 expression, forskolin significantly increased SF-1 protein and mRNA levels in a cycloheximide-sensitive manner (to 167.4 ± 16.6 and 173.1 ± 25.1% of controls after 6 h, respectively,p < 0.01). These results demonstrate that the balance between repressor and inducer function of DAX-1 and SF-1 are of critical importance in the regulation of adrenal aldosterone biosynthesis. The biosynthesis of aldosterone, the main mineralocorticoid hormone, in the zona glomerulosa cells of the adrenal cortex is placed under the control of three principal physiological factors, the octapeptide hormone, angiotensin II (Ang II), 1The abbreviations used are: Ang II, angiotensin II; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; DAX-1, dosage-sensitive sex reversal adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X-chromosome, gene 1; IOD, integrated optical density; P450scc, cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P450; SF-1, steroidogenic factor-1; StAR protein, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; RT, reverse transcriptase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 1The abbreviations used are: Ang II, angiotensin II; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; DAX-1, dosage-sensitive sex reversal adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X-chromosome, gene 1; IOD, integrated optical density; P450scc, cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P450; SF-1, steroidogenic factor-1; StAR protein, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; RT, reverse transcriptase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. extracellular potassium (K+), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (1Müller J. Regulation of Aldosterone Biosynthesis. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1988Google Scholar). Whereas Ang II and K+ exert their effect by recruiting the calcium messenger system in glomerulosa cells (2Capponi A.M. Rossier M.F. Davies E. Vallotton M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16113-16117Google Scholar, 3Capponi A.M. Rossier M.F. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1996; 3: 248-257Google Scholar), ACTH acts mainly by activating adenylyl cyclase and generating cAMP as an intracellular messenger (4Baukal A.J. Hunyady L. Catt K.J. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24546-24549Google Scholar). In the cascade of subsequent events leading to the final production of aldosterone, the regulated, rate-limiting step is the transfer of cholesterol from the relatively cholesterol-rich outer mitochondrial membrane to the cholesterol-poor inner mitochondrial membrane (5Jefcoate C.R. McNamara B.C. Artemenko I. Yamazaki T. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 751-767Google Scholar). Cholesterol is then converted to pregnenolone by the cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc). In all steroidogenic tissues, intramitochondrial cholesterol transfer is facilitated by the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein (6Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 221-244Google Scholar). In the adrenal zona glomerulosa cell, the expression of the StAR protein is rapidly increased by factors that activate mineralocorticoid biosynthesis. Indeed, Ang II and ACTH have been shown to stimulate StAR mRNA and StAR protein expression and to concomitantly increase aldosterone production in bovine zona glomerulosa cells (7Cherradi N. Rossier M.F. Vallotton M.B Timberg R. Friedberg I. Orly J. Wang X.J. Stocco D.M. Capponi A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7899-7907Google Scholar, 8Cherradi N. Brandenburger Y. Rossier M.F. Vallotton M.B. Stocco D.M. Capponi A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 962-972Google Scholar). Moreover, in human H295R adrenocortical carcinoma cells, which bear only very few ACTH receptors, challenge with cAMP analogs, used to mimic adenylyl cyclase activation, Ang II, or K+, leads to StAR mRNA and protein expression (9Clark B.J. Pezzi V. Stocco D.M. Rainey W.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 115: 215-219Google Scholar, 10Clark B, J. Combs R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4390-4398Google Scholar). Whereas the initial signal transduction mechanisms mediating the steroidogenic action of these activators of aldosterone biosynthesis are well characterized (3Capponi A.M. Rossier M.F. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1996; 3: 248-257Google Scholar), the events occurring downstream of Ca2+ or cAMP signal generation and leading to the induction of StAR protein expression are poorly understood. No consensus cAMP response element has been found in the ∼3.6-kilobase 5′-flanking region of the mouse, rat, human, porcine, and bovine StAR gene (11Christenson L.K. Strauss J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 175-187Google Scholar). In contrast, in all species, several putative binding sites for steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), also called Ad4BP, are present in the StAR gene promoter (10Clark B, J. Combs R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4390-4398Google Scholar,12Sugawara T. Kiriakidou M. Mcallister J.M. Holt J.A. Arakane F. Strauss J.F. Steroids. 1997; 62: 5-9Google Scholar, 13Sugawara T. Kiriakidou M.

Walther N. Ivell R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 21: 189-200Google Scholar). The number and localization of these binding sites vary from one species to the other. SF-1 is a nuclear transcription factor that was first identified in adrenal cortical cells (17Morohash K. Zanger U.M. Honda S. Hara M. Waterman M.R. Omura T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1196-1204Google Scholar). The orphan nuclear receptor SF-1 plays a critical role in adrenal and gonadal differentiation, development, and function (18Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Google Scholar). Furthermore, SF-1 has also been shown to regulate the expression of genes encoding cytochrome P450 hydroxylases and to efficiently transactivate the StARgene in transient transfection assays in various cell types (13Sugawara T. Kiriakidou M. Mcallister J.M. Kallen C.B. Strauss J.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7249-7255Google Scholar, 15Sandhoff T.W. Hales D.B. Hales K.H. Mclean M.P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4820-4831Google Scholar,16Rust W. Stedronsky K. Tillmann G. Morley S. Walther N. Ivell R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 21: 189-200Google Scholar, 19Wooton-Kee C.R. Clark B.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1345-1355Google Scholar). Although the extent of SF-1 involvement in the regulation ofStAR gene expression may present species- and cell type-dependent differences (20Silverman E. Eimerl S. Orly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17987-17996Google Scholar), it appears that activation of the cAMP-signaling pathway leads to increased phosphorylation (21Gyles S.L. Burns C.J. Whitehouse B.J. Sugden D. Marsh P.J. Persaud S.J. Jones P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34888-34895Google Scholar) and/or expression (22Aesoy R. Mellgren G. Morohashi K. Lund J. Endocrinology. 2002; 144: 295-303Google Scholar) of SF-1 protein. In addition to response elements for SF-1, the StAR gene promoter also bears a binding site for another orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, DAX-1 (dosage-sensitive sex reversal adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1) (23Yu R.N. Achermann J.C. Ito M. Jameson J.L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 5: 169-175Google Scholar, 24Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1999; 6: 185-190Google Scholar). DAX-1 has been shown to act as a powerful repressor of StARgene expression. Indeed, overexpression of DAX-1 in Y-1 mouse adrenal tumor cells inhibits steroid synthesis, and DAX-1 represses both basal and cAMP-induced StAR promoter activity by binding to DNA hairpin secondary structures on the StAR gene promoter or to the SF-1 protein itself (25Zazopoulos E. Lalli E. Stocco D. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1997; 390: 311-315Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of DAX-1 in Y-1 adrenocortical cells impairs basal and cAMP-stimulated steroid production (26Tamai K.T. Monaco L. Alastalo T.P. Lalli E. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1561-1569Google Scholar). Conversely, cAMP down-regulates DAX-1 expression in cultured rat Sertoli cells (26Tamai K.T. Monaco L. Alastalo T.P. Lalli E. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1561-1569Google Scholar). Finally, SF-1 and DAX-1 are co-localized in various endocrine and steroidogenic tissues, suggesting that these two nuclear proteins may be linked in function. Because Ang II and ACTH stimulate StAR protein expression, the present study was undertaken to investigate whether the mechanism of this response involves a modulation of DAX-1 and SF-1 expression. We report here that both Ang II, a calcium mobilizing hormone, and forskolin, used as a mimicker of ACTH action to generate a pure cAMP signal, markedly inhibit DAX-1 expression at the mRNA and protein level. We also show that forskolin significantly increases SF-1 expression. This study provides evidence that the removal of the suppressor effect of DAX-1 on StAR expression is an important mechanism through which activators of aldosterone biosynthesis increase StAR expression. Bovine adrenal glands were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Zona glomerulosa cells were prepared by enzymatic dispersion with dispase and purified on Percoll density gradients as previously reported (27Python C.P. Rossier M.F. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1489-1496Google Scholar). Primary cultures of purified glomerulosa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described in detail elsewhere (27Python C.P. Rossier M.F. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1489-1496Google Scholar). The cells were grown on 6-well tissue culture plates (3 × 106 cells/well) and kept in serum-free medium for 24 h before experiments, which were performed on the third day of culture. Cells were then washed and incubated at 37 °C in serum-free medium containing various agents for varying periods of time as appropriate. At the end of the incubation period, the media were collected, and cells were processed for protein or total RNA extraction as described hereafter. Aldosterone content in incubation media was measured by direct radioimmunoassay using a commercially available kit (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX). Aldosterone production was normalized and expressed per milligram of cellular protein. For the determination of protein expression levels, bovine glomerulosa cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate saline buffer (PBS) and lysed in PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptine. The cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and supernatants were used as cell lysates. Proteins were quantified using a protein microassay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blot analysis of DAX-1 and SF-1 proteins was carried out with a mouse monoclonal antiserum directed against DAX-1 (kindly provided by Dr. Enzo Lalli, Strasbourg, France) or a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to Ad4BP/SF-1 (kindly supplied by Dr. Ken Morohashi, University of Tsukuba, Japan). Mitochondrial StAR protein levels were determined by Western blot as previously described (8Cherradi N. Brandenburger Y. Rossier M.F. Vallotton M.B. Stocco D.M. Capponi A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 962-972Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Band intensity was quantified with a Molecular Dynamics Computing Densitometer. For transfection experiments, 800,000 bovine glomerulosa cells were seeded in 60-mm Petri dishes. Cells were transfected using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One μg of pBKCMV-hDAX-1 encoding the human DAX-1 protein was introduced into cells at a DNA:Effectene ratio of 1:50. The same conditions were used with the empty vector pBKCMV for mock-transfected cells. Cells were incubated with the transfection complexes for 8 h then washed twice with phosphate saline buffer and incubated for 48 h in fresh medium supplemented with serum. In separate experiments with pBKCMV-GFP encoding the green fluorescent protein we observed that the transfection efficacy amounted to 35–40% under the above conditions (data not shown). Cells were then challenged with Ang II, and DAX-1 protein levels were determined as described. Total cellular RNA was isolated from bovine glomerulosa cells using the SV Total RNA Isolation system (Promega, Zurich, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (500 ng) was reverse-transcribed and amplified using the Access RT-PCR system (Promega). A fragment of bovine DAX-1 cDNA (214 base pairs) was amplified using human DAX-1 primers (5′-AGGGGACCGTGCTCTTTAAC-3′ forward and 5′-ATGATGGGCCTGAAG AACAG-3′ reverse). Primers corresponded to positions +1145–1164 and 1339–1358 of the human DAX-1 (NCBI/GenBankTM accession number NM_000457). The PCR product was purified from a 1% agarose gel, cloned into pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega), and amplified in JM 109 competent cells. The plasmid insert was sequenced by automatic sequencing using the DyEnamics Terminator sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and Applied Biosystem 3100 sequencer. RT-PCR was used to evaluate DAX-1 and SF-1 mRNA abundance in response to various treatments. RT-PCR measurements of mRNA were performed using Promega reagents and 500 ng of total RNA per reaction. Reverse transcription with avian myeloblastosis virus RT (5 units/reaction, 48 °C for 30 min) primed with specific primers was followed by PCR using Tfl DNA polymerase (5 units/reaction) with the following cycling parameters: denaturation for 5 min at 95 °C followed by 30 and 25 cycles for DAX-1 and SF-1, respectively, of 95 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 30 s and a final extension at 68 °C for 10 min. The primers were bovine SF-1 (5′-GCAGAAGAAGGCACAGATTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGGTACTCAGACTTGATGG-3′ (reverse). Primers corresponded to positions +439–459 and 693–713 of the bovine Ad4BP mRNA (NCBI/GenBankTM accession numberD13569). DAX-1 primers were as described above. To correct for potential variations in RT-PCR efficiency, an internal control, a fragment of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was co-amplified in each sample using as the sense primer 5′-ATGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTG-3′ and as the antisense primer 5′-TGCAGAGATGATGACCCTC-3′. Primers corresponded to positions +82–99 and 426–444 of the human GAPDH (NCBI/GenBankTM accession number NM_002046). The combination of GAPDH and SF-1 primers yielded two products corresponding to 362 and 274 bp for GAPDH and SF-1, respectively, and that of GAPDH and DAX-1 yielded two products corresponding to 362 and 214 bp for GAPDH and DAX-1, respectively. Ten microliters of the PCR product were separated by electrophoresis on ethidium bromide-stained 1.3% agarose gels. The intensity of each band was normalized to the intensity of the corresponding GAPDH band. Bands were quantified by image analysis using the NIH Image 1.23 software (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/download.html). All amplified sequences were confirmed by automatic sequencing. Plots of product amountversus cycle number were linear, confirming that all reactions were run in the exponential part of the progress curve. The partial sequence of bovine DAX-1 has been deposited in the GenBankTM data base (Bethesda, MD) under accession number AF421373. The nucleic acid and derived amino acid sequences of DAX-1 cDNA were compared with known sequences provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD) using Blast searches. Comparison of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were performed using ClustalW. The data presented are the mean ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences between treatments was determined by one-way analysis of variance and Fisher's protected least significant difference test. Values of p < 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant. DAX-1 protein levels were high in unstimulated bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells. When cells were treated with Ang II for 6 h, a significant, concentration-dependent inhibition of DAX-1 protein expression was observed between 0.1 and 10 nm Ang II, as determined by Western blot analysis. Maximal inhibition (to 38.7 ± 12.9% of controls, n = 3–9, p < 0.01) was achieved with 3 nm Ang II (Fig.1, A and B). Concomitantly, Ang II powerfully stimulated intramitochondrial StAR protein accumulation (Fig. 1 C) and aldosterone production (Fig. 1 D) over the same range of concentrations. At 10 nm Ang II, aldosterone production into the medium was increased by 71-fold (127.2 ± 19.4 pmol/mg of proteinversus 1.8 ± 0.26 pmol/mg in control cells,n = 3, p < 0.01). To determine the kinetics of the inhibition of DAX-1 protein expression induced by Ang II, we stimulated glomerulosa cells with 10 nm Ang II for 0–6 h. As shown in Fig.2, A and B, the inhibitory effect of Ang II was time-dependent, with DAX-1 protein levels reaching 61.5 ± 4.6% (n = 5,p < 0.01) and 40 ± 3.4% of controls (n = 5, p < 0.01) after 4 and 6 h, respectively. No further decrease in DAX-1 protein expression was observed thereafter (data not shown). The progressive inhibition of DAX-1 protein expression was accompanied with a time-dependent increase in aldosterone production from Ang II-treated adrenal glomerulosa cells (Fig. 2 C). The inhibition of DAX-1 protein expression by Ang II depended upon de novo protein synthesis. Indeed, although glomerulosa cells stimulated with 10 nm Ang II for 6 h showed a significant decrease in DAX-1 protein levels (to 40.8 ± 2.6% of controls, n = 3,p < 0.01), simultaneous treatment with cycloheximide, a protein translation inhibitor, abolished the Ang II-induced inhibition of DAX-1 protein expression (Fig.3, A and B). Cycloheximide also completely abolished the aldosterone response to Ang II, as previously reported by others (28Elliott M.E. Goodfriend T.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 1519-1524Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 C). Ang II is known to activate ERK2/1 in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells (29Tian Y. Smith R.D. Balla T. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1801-1809Google Scholar). To determine whether inhibition of DAX-1 protein expression by Ang II is mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, we stimulated cells with Ang II alone or in combination with U0126 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), an inhibitor of MEK-1, the kinase that phosphorylates and activates ERK2/1. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, the inhibitory effect of Ang II on DAX-1 expression was completely abolished in the presence of U0126. In contrast, the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, SB203580, did not affect Ang II action (data not shown). To determine whether Ang II exerts its inhibitory effect directly on DAX-1 mRNA expression, we stimulated glomerulosa cells for 6 h with 10 nm Ang II alone or in combination with 10 μm U0126, and DAX-1 mRNA levels were then determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The results shown in Fig. 4, Cand D, indicate that Ang II treatment led to a significant decrease in bovine DAX-1 mRNA levels (to 68.8 ± 4.3% of controls, n = 4, p < 0.01). This down-regulation of DAX-1 mRNA by Ang II was completely prevented by the MEK-1 inhibitor U0126. The involvement of ERK2/1 in the functional response to Ang II was also observed at the level of steroid production. Indeed, as shown in Fig.4 E, two structurally unrelated MEK-1 inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059 (Alexis Biochemicals, Läufelfingen, Switzerland), significantly reduced aldosterone production elicited by Ang II. We next examined whether another inducer of StAR expression and aldosterone production, forskolin, used as a mimicker of ACTH, which mobilizes the cAMP messenger system, also affects DAX-1 expression. As shown in Fig. 5, A andB, treatment of adrenal glomerulosa cells with 25 μm forskolin for 6 h dramatically inhibited DAX-1 protein expression (to 19.6 ± 1.82% of controls,n = 3, p < 0.001). As for Ang II, inhibition of DAX-1 protein expression by forskolin was concentration- and time-dependent (data not shown). Furthermore, the inhibition of DAX-1 protein expression by forskolin was completely prevented by cycloheximide. In contrast, the MEK-1 inhibitor, U0126, had no effect on forskolin action. The inhibition of DAX-1 protein expression provoked by forskolin was associated with a 56-fold increase in aldosterone production (Fig. 5 E). The inhibition of DAX-1 expression by forskolin was also observed at the transcriptional level, as demonstrated in Fig. 5, C andD. Indeed, in glomerulosa cells stimulated with forskolin, DAX-1 mRNA levels were decreased to 50.3 ± 4.7% of control untreated cells (n = 3, p < 0.0.01). This effect was not reversed by the MEK-1 inhibitor, U0126. Moreover, actinomycin D did not affect the reduction of DAX-1 mRNA expression elicited by forskolin (data not shown). To determine whether Ang II and forskolin decreased DAX-1 protein levels by accelerating its catabolism, we incubated bovine glomerulosa cells for 6 h in the absence or presence of either agonist and then followed DAX-1 protein levels under conditions of protein synthesis blockade. As shown in Fig.6 A, DAX-1 protein levels were quite stable over time under basal conditions and in the absence of cycloheximide. In contrast, when de novo protein synthesis was prevented, the levels of DAX-1 protein decreased markedly with time, with a half-life of ∼6 h. Neither Ang II nor forskolin accelerated this process (Fig. 6 A). The inhibition of DAX-1 mRNA expression could result from changes in transcription rate and/or in mRNA turnover. We therefore examined whether Ang II affected DAX-1 mRNA stability. Glomerulosa cells were treated for 6 h in the absence or presence of Ang II (10 nm), and then actinomycin D was added. After 6 h, DAX-1 mRNA levels decayed to 45.2% of the zero time value in cells treated with actinomycin D alone and to a similar value (53.4 ± 4.9%, n = 3, p < 0.01) in cells that had been pretreated with Ang II (Fig. 6 B). Similar results were obtained with forskolin (data not shown). The role of DAX-1 on the aldosterone response to Ang II was confirmed in bovine glomerulosa cells that had been transiently transfected with DAX-1 cDNA. In cells transfected with the empty pBKCMV vector, Ang II induced a robust aldosterone production (Fig.7, Mock). Although the absolute aldosterone values were somewhat lower than in non-transfected cells, possibly because of the transfection procedure itself, the fold increase over basal was not significantly different (see, for example, Figs. 1 D, 3 C, or 4 C). This aldosterone response was associated with the expected repression of DAX-1. In contrast, in cells transiently transfected with pBKCMV-hDAX-1, which expressed 20–30-fold higher levels of the DAX-1 protein, the aldosterone response to Ang II was significantly reduced to 59.4 ± 4% of the response measured in mock-transfected cells (n = 3, p < 0.01). Because the transcription factor SF-1 is known to regulate StAR protein expression, we examined whether the induction of StAR expression induced by both Ang II and forskolin involves changes in SF-1 protein expression in adrenal glomerulosa cells. As shown in Fig. 8, Aand B, a significant increase in SF-1 protein expression was observed in cells stimulated for 6 h with forskolin (167.4 ± 16.6% of controls, n = 7, p < 0.001), whereas Ang II had no effect. The forskolin-induced increase in SF-1 protein expression was blocked by cycloheximide. We next examined whether forskolin and Ang II affected SF-1 mRNA expression. Bovine glomerulosa cells were stimulated for 6 h with 10 nm Ang II or 25 μm forskolin, and SF-1 mRNA levels were then determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The results shown in Fig. 8, C and D, indicate that forskolin treatment led to a significant increase in bovine SF-1 mRNA levels (to 173.1 ± 25.1% of controls, n= 5, p < 0.05). In contrast, Ang II had no significant effect on SF-1 mRNA expression. The forskolin-induced increase in SF-1 mRNA expression was almost completely abolished by actinomycin D (Fig. 8, C and D), suggesting a direct action of forskolin on SF-1 mRNA at the transcriptional level. The present study was undertaken in an attempt to investigate the mechanism of the known induction of StAR protein expression in adrenal glomerulosa cells in response to two physiological activators of aldosterone biosynthesis, the octapeptide hormone angiotensin II and adrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH (10Clark B, J. Combs R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4390-4398Google Scholar, 30Cherradi N. Capponi A.M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 9: 412-418Google Scholar). We have focused our attention on two orphan members of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors, DAX-1 and SF-1. Indeed, on one hand, DAX-1 has been shown to repress StAR gene expression by binding to a hairpin structure located in the StAR gene promoter and to block steroidogenesis (25Zazopoulos E. Lalli E.

On the other hand, multiple binding elements for SF-1 have been reported in the 5′-flanking region of theStAR gene and are required for maximal promoter activity (4Baukal A.J. Hunyady L. Catt K.J. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24546-24549Google Scholar). Two main conclusions can be drawn from the present work. 1) Ang II, which recruits the calcium messenger signaling system (31Cherradi N. Brandenburger Y. Capponi A.M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 249-256Google Scholar), and forskolin, used as a mimicker of ACTH action via cAMP generation, both markedly repressed DAX-1 expression, and 2) forskolin significantly increased the expression of SF-1. It is worth stressing that these observations were obtained in bovine glomerulosa cells in primary culture, expressing normal levels of only endogenous DAX-1 and SF-1, rather than in artificial overexpression systems. The inhibition of DAX-1 exerted by Ang II and forskolin was manifest at both the protein and mRNA levels. In fact, although most studies have focused on the developmental and tissular distribution of DAX-1 expression in various species ("
https://openalex.org/W2062581505,"Cbfa1 is a critical regulator of cell differentiation expressed only in the osteochondrogenic lineage. To define the molecular basis of this cell-specific expression we analyzed the murine Cbfa1 promoter. Here we show that the first 976 bp of this promoter are specifically active in osteoblastic cells. Within this region DNase I footprinting delineated a 40-bp area (CE1) protected differently by nuclear extracts from osteoblastic cells and from non-osteoblastic cells. When multimerized, CE1 conferred an osteoblast-specific activity to a heterologous promoter in DNA transfection experiments; this enhancing ability was conserved between mouse, rat, and human CE1 present in the respective Cbfa1promoters. CE1 site-specific mutagenesis determined that it binds NF1- and AP1-like activities. Further analyses revealed that the NF1 site acts as a repressor in non-osteoblastic cells due to the binding of NF1-A, a NF1 isoform not expressed in osteoblastic cells. In contrast, the AP1 site mediates an osteoblast-specific activation caused by the preferential binding of FosB to CE1 in osteoblastic cells. In summary, this study identified an osteoblast-specific enhancer in theCbfa1 promoter whose activity is achieved by the combination of an inhibitory and an activatory mechanism.

Their unique ability to deposit a matrix that can eventually mineralize explains that abnormal osteoblast differentiation and/or osteoblast function have dramatic consequences. Indeed, arrest of osteoblast differentiation often leads to lethal skeletal dysplasia whereas impaired osteoblast activity causes bone fragility with risk of fracture, a hallmark of osteoporosis, the most common degenerative disease in the western hemisphere (1Kleerekoper M. Avioli L.V. Avioli L.V. Krane S.M. Metabolic bone disease. San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar, 2Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3037-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 3Olsen B.J. Reginato A.M. Wang W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 191-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). This pivotal role of the osteoblasts in bone biology justifies the importance of identifying molecular regulators of osteoblast differentiation and function. However as of today only a few factors playing such a role have been identified, and no genetic cascade can yet be drawn showing how the differentiation of a mesenchymal cell to a fully functional osteoblast is controlled. With the long-term goal to delineate such cascade we have embarked on studying the regulation of expression of Runx2/Cbfa1 (thereafter Cbfa1), which is to date the best characterized regulator of osteogenesis (4Ducy P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 19: 461-471Crossref Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Cbfa1 is one of the three mammalian members of the runt family of transcription factors (5Kagoshima H. Shigesada K. Satake M. Ito Y. Miyoshi H. Ohki M. Pepling M. Gergen P. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 338-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Gene deletion experiments as well as overexpression studies have shown that Cbfa1 is necessary and sufficient for osteoblast differentiation (4Ducy P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 19: 461-471Crossref Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The finding that humans or mice heterozygous for Cbfa1 inactivation develop an identical phenotype termed Cleidocranial dysplasia (3Olsen B.J. Reginato A.M. Wang W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 191-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 4Ducy P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 19: 461-471Crossref Scopus (392) Google Scholar) established the remarkable conservation of Cbfa1 function during mammalian evolution. At the molecular level, Cbfa1 has been shown to directly regulate the expression of major osteoblastic marker genes such as the type I collagen genes, osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin (6Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3619) Google Scholar, 7Kern B. Shen J. Starbuck M. karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7101-7107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These findings, as well as the fact that impairing Cbfa1 function postnatally leads to osteopenia (8Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), indicate that it acts beyond development as a major regulator of bone mass via its control of the rate of bone matrix deposition by differentiated osteoblasts. This notion was recently extended to the resorption side of bone remodeling (9Gao Y.H. Shinki T. Yuasa T. Kataoka-Enomoto H. Komori T. Suda T. Yamaguchi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 10Liu W. Toyosawa S. Furuichi T. Kanatani N. Yoshida C. Liu Y. Himeno M. Narai S. Yamaguchi A. Komori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Indeed, overexpression of Cbfa1 in osteoblasts was shown to increase their ability to sustain osteoclastogenesis and therefore to regulate, although indirectly, bone resorption as well as bone formation. The Cbfa1 gene potentially gives rise to two major transcripts, TypeII/Cbfa1p57/Osf2/MASNSL and TypeI/Cbfa1p56/MRIPVD (11Xiao Z.S. Thomas R. Hinson T.K. Quarles L.D. Gene. 1998; 214: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12Drissi H. Luc Q. Shakoori R. Chuva De Sousa Lopes S. Choi J.Y. Terry A. Hu M. Jones S. Neil J.C. Lian J.B. Stein J.L.

Biochem. 2001; 82: 647-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These transcripts differ by the promoter they originate from (P1 or P2, respectively), by their 5′-untranslated region and N-terminal coding sequence and by their pattern of expression in cell lines (11Xiao Z.S. Thomas R. Hinson T.K. Quarles L.D. Gene. 1998; 214: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12Drissi H. Luc Q. Shakoori R. Chuva De Sousa Lopes S. Choi J.Y. Terry A. Hu M. Jones S. Neil J.C. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, by in situ hybridization on mouse embryos, the same pattern of expression is observed when using a probe specific to the Type II form and a probe common to the two Cbfa1 transcripts, indicating the existence of a predominant pattern of expression in vivo(6Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3619) Google Scholar). Throughout development and in adult tissues, Cbfa1expression appears to be strictly restricted to cells of the osteochondrogenic lineage, although its level of expression varies according their stage of differentiation (14Takeda S. Bonnamy J.P. Owen M.J. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Cbfa1 is initially expressed in all cells of the mesenchymal condensations prefiguring each of the future skeletal elements, beginning at 10.5 days post-coitum in mouse (4Ducy P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 19: 461-471Crossref Scopus (392) Google Scholar). When chondrocyte differentiation proceeds in these structures, Cbfa1 expression becomes restricted to pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes and to the osteoblast progenitor cells present in the bone collar (14Takeda S. Bonnamy J.P. Owen M.J. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Postnatally, osteoblasts will become the only cell type expressing Cbfa1(6Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3619) Google Scholar, 14Takeda S. Bonnamy J.P. Owen M.J. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Considering that Cbfa1 expression is restricted to the skeletal cell lineage and that Cbfa1 is an inducer of osteoblast differentiation, it is likely that the factors controlling its expression would trigger the early steps of skeletal cell commitment and/or those of osteoblast differentiation. We therefore embarked in the analysis of the mouse Cbfa1 promoter with the long-term goal to identify cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors that induce and regulate Cbfa1 expression specifically in the osteoblastic lineage. In this study we report that such a cis-acting element is present at −415/−375 in the mouse Cbfa1 P1 promoter. Despite the fact that this region binds AP1 and NF1 nuclear activities, two classes of transcription factors whose members are broadly expressed, this element acts as an enhancer only in osteoblastic cells. Our analysis therefore shows that an osteoblast-specific activity can be achieved through a specific interaction between broadly expressed factors. UMR106 and ROS17/2.8 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (DMEM/F12; Invitrogen)/10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). NIH3T3, C2C12, 3T3L1, and COS cells were cultured in DMEM/10% fetal bovine serum. F9 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM; Invitrogen)/10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method as previously described (15Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) or using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An equal amount of pSV/β-galactosidase plasmid was added to each DNA mix to monitor the efficiency of transfection (15Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed as previously described (15Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). All transfections were repeated at least 6 times with two different preparations of plasmid DNA. All promoter fragments were cloned in the pGL2basic promoter-less luciferase expression vector (Clontech). The −2800/+111 mouse Cbfa1promoter region was cloned as an EcoRI/PstI fragment excised from a mouse Sv/ev genomic clone (Clontech). This initial fragment was used to generate all deletion mutants using as 5′-ends its internalNdeI (p2164-luc), XbaI (p1389-luc),BglII (p976-luc), SacI (p780-luc),ScaI (p89-luc) restriction sites and as 3′-end its terminalPstI site. Footprint analyses were performed using as templates the BglII/HindIII (−976/−734),HindIII/StuI (−733/−342), andStuI/ScaI (−341/−89) fragments cloned in pBluescript. Multimers (five copies) of the wild-type or mutant CE1 oligonucleotides (Table I) were cloned in front of the −46/+10 adenovirus type 2 major late promoter region itself fused to the luciferase reporter gene (pAMLP-luc). The FosB, Fra1, Fra2, JunB, and JunD expression vectors were a generous gift from Dr. G. Karsenty (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas). pCMV-ΔFosB was generated by cloning a PCR fragment amplified with the following primers: 5′-CAGAGAGCGGAACAAGCTGGCTGC-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGATCACCTCGGCCAGCGGGC-3′ into pCMV5. NF1 expression vectors were a kind gift from Dr. J. Rosen (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX).Table Ia Substitution mutations are represented in boldface, insertional mutants are boxed. Open table in a new tab a Substitution mutations are represented in boldface, insertional mutants are boxed. Extractions of total RNA and Northern blot experiments were performed using standard protocols (16Ausubel, F. M. (1995) Sons, J. W., New York.Google Scholar). Membranes were successively hybridized with a Cbfa1 (6Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3619) Google Scholar) and a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe used as a control for equivalence of RNA loading. For RT-PCR analysis, DNase I-treated total RNAs were first reverse transcribed using oligo-dT primers. PCR amplifications were then carried out according to a previously described protocol (17Mukhopadhyay S.S. Wyszomierski S.L. Gronostajski R.M. Rosen J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) using the following NF1-specific degenerated primers: Deg1 (5′-TTCCGGATGA(A/G)TT(C/T)CA(C/T)CITT(C/T)AT(C/T)GA(A/G)GC-3′) and Deg2 (5′-AATCGAT(A/G)TG(A/ G)TG(C/G)GGCTGIA(C/T)(A/G)CAIAG-3′) where I is inosine. Simultaneous amplifications of Hprt exon 2 were used as internal control of the quality and equal loading of cDNAs (Hprt primers were: 5′-GTTGAGAGATCATCTCCACC-3′ and 5′-AGCGATGATGAACCAGGTTA-3′). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed according to standard procedures (16Ausubel, F. M. (1995) Sons, J. W., New York.Google Scholar) using commercial antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Buffers for the preparation of nuclear extracts contained the following protease inhibitors: 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and pepstatin. Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (15Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). DNase I footprint assays were performed as previously described (15Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) except that 50 μg of nuclear extracts and 0.4 μg of poly(dI·dC)·poly(dI·dC) were used per reaction. For electromobility shift assays (EMSAs),1 double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the wild type or mutant CE1 sites (Table I) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and the T4 polynucleotide kinase, as described (15Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Each reaction contained 5 fmoles of probe and 3 μg of nuclear extracts in 10 μl of a buffer containing 35% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm spermidine, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of leupeptin and pepstatin. Poly(dI·dC)·poly(dI·dC) (1 μg) and single-stranded DNA (500 fmoles) were used as nonspecific competitors. For supershift experiments antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated with 8 μg of nuclear extracts for 30 min at 4 °C prior to addition of the probe. Reactions were left for 20 min at room temperature then electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× Tris borate/EDTA at 160 V for 2 h. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. Cbfa1 is encoded by a single gene whose expression is restricted to cells of the osteochondrogenic lineagein vivo (4Ducy P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 19: 461-471Crossref Scopus (392) Google Scholar). To analyze the mechanisms controllingCbfa1 promoter cell-specificity we therefore relied on comparing its activity in osteoblastic and in non-osteoblastic cells. ROS17/2.8 (18Majeska R.J. Rodan S.B. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1494-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and UMR106 cells (19Forrest S.M., Ng, K.W. Findlay D.M. Michelangeli V.P. Livesey S.A. Partridge N.C. Zajac J.D. Martin T.J. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1985; 37: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) were initially chosen as osteoblastic references because they express high levels ofCbfa1 (Fig. 1 A). Both cell lines derive from rat osteosarcomas and represent a mature osteoblastic phenotype, expressing the PTH/PTHrP receptor and Osteocalcin (15Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 18Majeska R.J. Rodan S.B. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1494-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 19Forrest S.M., Ng, K.W. Findlay D.M. Michelangeli V.P. Livesey S.A. Partridge N.C. Zajac J.D. Martin T.J. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1985; 37: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). UMR106 is however expressing Cbfa1at a higher level than ROS17/2.8 (Fig. 1 A). As non-osteoblastic references we used cell lines that are, like osteoblasts, of mesenchymal origin such as fibroblasts (NIH3T3), preadipocytes (3T3L1), and myoblasts (C2C12), and cells of different embryonic origin such as F9 teratocarcinoma and COS monkey kidney cells. Cbfa1 expression was not detectable in any of these cell lines (Fig. 1 A). Using the first Cbfa1 exon as a probe we screened a mouse genomic library and isolated a clone containing 2.8 kb lying upstream of the Cbfa1 start site of transcription (20Geoffroy V. Corral D.A. Zhou L. Lee B. Karsenty G. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 54-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We first performed DNA transfection experiments using a reporter construct harboring this region (−2800/+111) fused to the luciferase gene (p2800-luc). This construct was significantly more active in osteoblastic cells than in any non-osteoblastic mesenchyme-derived cells, and it was virtually inactive in F9 and COS cells (Fig.1 B). This result suggested that the −2800/+111 region contained regulatory element(s) favoring its expression in osteoblastic cells. To localize them more precisely, activities of 5′-deletion mutants of this 2.8-kb promoter fragment were compared in UMR106 osteoblastic cells. Deletions from −2800 to −976 did not alter significantly the level of activity (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, deletion from −976 to −89 decreased by 6-fold the level of luciferase expression, indicating that critical cis-acting elements are present in this region (Fig. 1 C). To determine whether such elements could be cell-specific we compared the activity of p976-luc in osteoblastic and non-osteoblastic cell lines. As shown in Fig.1 D, p976-luc displayed a tight osteoblast-specific activity. Consistent with the difference of Cbfa1 expression in these cells (Fig. 1 A), p976-luc was more active in UMR106 than in ROS17/2.8 cells (Fig. 1 D). We therefore chose the UMR106 cell line as reference in all subsequent experiments. These results thus established the osteoblast-specificity of the −976/+111Cbfa1 promoter fragment in DNA transfection and indicated that at least one osteoblast-specific regulatory element lied between −976 and −89. DNase I footprint assays were performed to define the sites of binding of osteoblast-specific nuclear proteins within the −976/−89 area, searching for areas differentially protected by nuclear extracts from UMR106 osteoblastic cells compared with non-osteoblastic mesenchyme-derived NIH3T3 and 3T3L1 cells or F9 cells. Analysis of the −976/−734 region did not show any protected area (data not shown). In agreement with such absence of cis-acting elements, a reporter construct missing this −976/−734 region displayed a similar activity that p976-luc in UMR106 cells (p976-luc, 98260 ± 12782 Rlu; p780-luc, 106752 ± 12116 Rlu). Analysis of the −733/−342 region delineated three protected regions. First, on its lower DNA strand nuclear extracts from NIH3T3 fibroblasts protected an area between −470 and −415 (Fig.2 A, white box). This area was not protected by any other non-osteoblastic nuclear extracts and more importantly it was not protected by any extracts on the opposite strand (Fig. 2, A–C). For these two reasons this region was not further analyzed. Two other regions, we named Cbfa1 element 1 (CE1) and Cbfa1 element 2 (CE2), were also found footprinted (Fig. 2 A, gray boxes). Independently of the DNA strand analyzed CE1 laid between −375 and −415 and was protected by all three mesenchymal cell-derived but not by F9 cells nuclear extracts (Fig. 2, A–C). However, on both strands CE1 pattern of protection was different between UMR106 extracts and NIH3T3 or 3T3L1 extracts, suggesting that this region bound different nuclear proteins in osteoblastic and non-osteoblastic cells. CE2, which lies between −558 and −470 on the lower DNA strand, was protected in a similar fashion by nuclear extracts from the three mesenchymal cell-derived but was not protected by F9 cells nuclear extracts (Fig. 2 A). This suggested that this region was binding a factor widely expressed in mesenchymal cells rather than an osteoblast-specific factor. For this reason and because no protected area could be observed when we analyzed the opposite strand (Fig.2 C) this region was thus not further analyzed. Lastly, when the −341/−89 region was analyzed no cell-specific protection could be observed (data not shown). Taken together, the results of the footprinting analysis of the −976/−89 region of the mouse Cbfa1 promoter indicate that CE1, a 40-bp area lying between −415 and −375 (Fig. 2 D), is the only region binding distinct factors in osteoblastic and non-osteoblastic cells. A double-stranded oligonucleotide covering CE1 (Fig.3 A and TableI) was used as a probe in EMSA using UMR106 nuclear extracts as a source of proteins. Four DNA-protein complexes were observed (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). Computer analysis of CE1 showed that it contains two core binding sites: a 80% conserved NF1 binding site (site a, −410/−396) and a 100% AP1 consensus sequence (site b, −388/−382) (Fig. 3 A). Based on this observation we designed a series of mutant CE1 oligonucleotides harboring respectively an insertional mutation known to impair NF1 binding (Insa) (21Gronostajski R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9117-9132Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), a mutation abolishing AP1 binding (mb) (22Passegue E. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) or both mutations (Insa/mb) (Fig. 3 A and Table I), and tested them in EMSA. The Insa mutation dramatically reduced (although did not abolish) formation of complexes *1 and *4 while it did not affect formation of complexes *2 and *3 (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). This result suggested that the factors forming *2 and *3 do not bind to the NF1 site. In contrast, the mb mutation of the AP1 site led to the sole formation of complex 4 (Fig. 3 B, lane 3), suggesting that this complex does not bind to the AP1 element. Interestingly, both single mutations abolished the presence of complex *1 (Fig. 3 B,lanes 2 and 3), suggesting that it is formed by simultaneous binding of NF1 and AP1 factors. No factors bound to CE1 independently of the NF1 and AP1 sites since simultaneous mutation of these two sites abolished the binding of all complexes (Fig.3 B, lane 4). We next performed competition experiments in EMSA. Labeled wild type CE1 oligonucleotide was used as probe in the presence of 0-, 10-, or 100-fold molar excess of cold oligonucleotides containing consensus wild type or mutant NF1 and AP1 binding sites (Table I). NF1 wild type consensus oligonucleotide competed away both *1 and *4 complexes (Fig.3 C, lanes 2 and 3). When mutated using the Insa insertion (Table I) this same core sequence did not compete binding at 10-fold molar excess, but did reduce formation of complexes *1 and *4 at higher concentrations (Fig. 3 C, lanes 4 and 5). This indicates that the Insa mutant site can still bind NF1, although with a lower affinity than the wild type site. This result is consistent with the direct binding experiment presented in Fig. 3 B showing that formation of complexes *1 and *4 is reduced but not abolished by the Insa mutation (Fig. 3 B,lane 2). When we used as cold competitor an AP1 consensus site, only complex *4 formed (Fig. 3 C, lanes 6and 7). In contrast, introducing the mb mutation in this sequence (Table I) did not impair the formation of any complex, even at high concentrations (Fig. 3 C, lanes 8 and9), indicating that the mb mutation completely abolishes the ability of AP1 factors to bind to CE1. Together, the results of our direct and competition EMSA experiments indicate that complex *2 and *3 are formed by an AP1 binding activity while complex *4 binds a NF1-related nuclear protein. Complex *1 appears to contain both types of factors, suggesting that none of them inhibits the ability of the other to bind to its recognition site within CE1. To determine whether any of the complexes binding to CE1 was osteoblastic-specific, we compared EMSA patterns obtained using nuclear extracts from UMR106, NIH3T3, and 3T3L1 cells. Using wild type CE1 the major difference we could observe was the absence of AP1 binding activities *2 and *3 in non-osteoblastic cell lines (Fig.3 D, lanes 1–3). Complexes of intermediate mobility were instead present (Fig. 3 D, lanes 2and 3, black dots). Their formation was abolished by the mb mutation indicating that, like osteoblastic complexes *2 and *3, they contained AP1-binding activities (Fig. 3 D,lanes 8 and 9). We thus named them complexes *2/3 to reflect their intermediary mobility compared with complexes *2 and *3. There was a difference of migration between NIH3T3 and 3T3L1 *2/3 complexes suggesting that different AP1 activities bound to CE1 in these cells. We also observed that formation of complex *4, that binds a NF1 nuclear activity, migrated slightly faster with osteoblastic nuclear extracts than with non-osteoblastic extracts (Fig.3 D, lanes 7–9), suggesting that CE1 may bind different NF1 isoforms in these two types of cells. To investigate the function of CE1 and of the two putative binding sites it contains we performed a series of DNA transfection experiments. Multimers of either the wild type, Insa mutant, mb mutant, or Insa/mb double mutant CE1 oligonucleotides were cloned upstream of an inactive heterologous promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene (Fig.4 A). These different constructs were transfected in UMR106 cells, NIH3T3 cells, and 3T3L1 cells. Five copies of wild type CE1 (p5CE1-luc) increased the activity of an inactive heterologous promoter 44-fold in UMR106 cells compared with less than 4-fold in non-osteoblastic cells (Fig. 4 B). This stimulatory effect was independent of the orientation of the oligonucleotides, demonstrating that CE1 functions as a true enhancer. When we introduced an inactivating mutation in the AP1 site (mb) or when we mutated simultaneously the NF1 and AP1 sites (Insa/mb), CE1 activity was totally abolished in all 3 cell types (Fig. 4,C–E). In contrast, mutation of the NF1 site alone (Insa) did not significantly decrease CE1 activity in osteoblasts (Fig.4 C), indicating that the NF1 nuclear protein(s) binding to CE1 in these cells do not have a major impact on its activity. This mutation however increased more than 5-folds CE1 activity in NIH3T3 cells and 3T3L1 cells (Fig. 4, D and E), suggesting that the NF1 nuclear factor(s) binding to CE1 in non-osteoblastic cells repress its activity. Considering that Insa did not modify CE1 activity in osteoblastic cells, this result also strongly suggests that these particular NF1 factors are not present in osteoblastic cells. Together, these experiments demonstrate that CE1 acts as an activator of transcription specifically in osteoblastic cells. They also suggest that this cell-specific activity results from the binding to CE1 of NF1 inhibitory factors present in non-osteoblastic cells but not in osteoblastic cells, and from the binding of AP1 enhancing activities specific to osteoblastic cells. We next searched theCbfa1 promoter of the rat (12Drissi H. Luc Q. Shakoori R. Chuva De Sousa Lopes S. Choi J.Y. Terry A. Hu M. Jones S. Neil J.C. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. J.

At −399/−359 in the rat promoter and at −257/−217 in the human promoter we located identical regions that share a 93% sequence conservation with mouse CE1 (Fig. 5 A). More specifically, these regions harbored a 100% conserved AP1 site and an 87% conserved NF1 site compared with mouse CE1. To determine if they had similar binding abilities we performed EMSA using nuclear extracts from UMR106 and mouse CE1 (mCE1) or rat/human putative CE1 (hCE1) as probes. As shown in Fig. 5 B, identical binding patterns were obtained with these 2 probes, indicating that the same nuclear activities can bind to these elements despite their 2-bp difference in the NF1 site. Consistent with this result DNA transfection experiments in UMR106 cells showed that 5 copies of hCE1 were as active as 5 copies of mCE1 (Fig. 5 C). That the CE1 enhancer had been conserved"

Smith G.C.M. Jones O.T.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 778PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work has demonstrated that the enzyme flavin needs to be reduced for inhibition to occur, and that the reaction of the reduced flavin with iodonium compounds results in phenyl adducts of the flavin (8O'Donnell V.B. Smith G.C.M. Jones O.T.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 778PubMed Google Scholar, 10Covès J. Lebrun C. Gervasi G. Dalbon P. Fontecave M. Biochem.

Tew has proposed the mechanism shown in Scheme 1 for the formation of the flavin N5-phenyl adduct, involving the one electron oxidation of the reduced flavin to form the semiquinone, at the expense of reduction of diphenyliodonium to the corresponding diphenyliodoyl radical. The latter is known to fragment rapidly to give iodobenzene and a phenyl radical, and the flavin semiquinone and phenyl radical are proposed to undergo a radical recombination to yield a flavin-phenyl adduct (7Tew D.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10209-10215Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Flred+Ph2I+→FlH⋅+Ph2I⋅Ph2I⋅→Ph⋅+PhIFlH⋅+Ph⋅→adduct SCHEME1We have reinvestigated the reaction of a number of flavoproteins with Ph2I+, as well as the reaction of reduced FAD and FMN with Ph2I+. Ph2I+ has been demonstrated to inhibit catalysis of several enzymes that do not operate by radical mechanisms. The main criteria for inhibition appear to be maintenance of the enzyme flavin in the reduced form during the steady state of catalysis and a system redox potential sufficiently negative to act as a reductant for Ph2I+. Most flavoproteins studied formed phenyl adducts when they were reduced prior to reaction with Ph2I+ under anaerobic conditions. Our results with reaction of free reduced flavin with Ph2I+ indicate that, in addition to the simple radical pathway of Tew (7Tew D.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10209-10215Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), a substantial portion of flavin adducts formation proceeds either by direct attack of Ph2I+ on the reduced flavin or via radical recombination from a primary caged radical pair. A series of flavin-phenyl adducts have been isolated and characterized, involving the flavin C4a, N5, and C8 positions. Diphenyliodonium chloride and FAD were obtained from Sigma.

Flavodoxin from Clostridium beijenkerii was a gift from Dr. Richard Swenson (Ohio State University, Columbus, OH) and protocatechuate dioxygenase was a gift from Dr. David P. Ballou (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). For the isolation of reaction products, for practical reasons we chose to use FMN for reaction of reduced flavin with Ph2I+, because it is much more soluble than riboflavin and simpler to deal with in subsequent analytical procedures than FAD. Commercial FMN is only 85% pure, whereas commercial FAD is >95% pure, with the impurity being authentic FMN. Hence we used FAD as starting material and converted it to FMN using the phosphodiesterase of snake venom. In a typical experiment, ∼500 mg of FAD was dissolved in ∼50–60 ml of 0.01 m potassium Pi, pH 7.0, and converted to FMN by incubating overnight at 25 °C with ∼50 mg of Naja naja venom, a potent source of phosphodiesterase. The course of the conversion was monitored by the spectral change associated with the conversion (ε450 FAD = 11,300 m−1cm−1, ε445 FMN = 12,500m−1 cm−1), using suitably diluted aliquots for the spectral measurements. On complete conversion, the reaction mixture was boiled for 1–2 min to precipitate the venom and the solution was centrifuged to get rid of the precipitate. A sample was tested by HPLC to make sure that no unconverted FAD remained. The FMN solution was further purified by Sep-Pak C-18 reversed phase cartridges, eluting with 10% CH3CN in water, and concentrated to ∼250 ml using a rotary evaporator at 38–40 °C. The pure FMN solution thus obtained was brought up to 0.1 mpotassium Pi, pH 7.0; placed in a 500-ml three-necked round-bottomed flask; 20 ml of 0.3 m EDTA was added in the dark and made anaerobic by bubbling argon, at 0- 5 °C for 45 min. The argon- equilibrated solution was then irradiated with a sun-gun for 10 min until all of the green fluorescence had disappeared, indicating full reduction. Diphenyliodonium chloride, 50 ml of 0.025m, previously made anaerobic by bubbling with argon for 30 min was added to the reduced FMN solution with argon gas still flowing. The solution immediately turned orange with some precipitate, which, however, disappeared on incubating at 25 °C for ∼1 h. The reaction mixture was opened to air and left overnight on ice. The solution was then loaded on four 35-ml Sep-Pak prepacked columns, prewashed with methanol and equilibrated with water. After washing with water to remove salts, the flavin reaction products were eluted with acetonitrile-water mixtures. The columns were protected from light throughout. The solutions were concentrated as quickly as possible using a rotary evaporator. UV-visible spectra were recorded with a Hewlett-Packard diode array spectrophotometer, or a Cary (Varian) model 219 double-beam spectrophotometer. NMR spectra were recorded in D2O with a Bruker 500-MHz instrument, and chemical shift values are reported in ppm relative to tetramethylsilane. Reversed phase HPLC analyses were carried out with a Beckman System Gold instrument (model 126), using a UV detector and a C-18 250 × 10-mm column. The column was equilibrated and washed with 20% acetonitrile in 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.7, for 5 min, and then the compounds were eluted by applying a gradient to 50% acetonitrile in 20 mm ammonium acetate over a period of 30 min. The eluate was monitored at 350 nm. Stopped flow experiments were carried out using a Hi-Tech SF-61 instrument in absorbance mode. For anaerobic reactions, the system was flushed and incubated overnight with a solution containing 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (protocatechuic acid) and protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase to scavenge any oxygen (21Patil P.V. Ballou D.P. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). All buffers and Ph2I+ solutions were made anaerobic by bubbling with highly pure argon for 15 min in a syringe before use. Experiments were done at 25 °C. Analyses were conducted by fitting data to exponential equations using the Marquardt algorithm (22Press W.H. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Flannery B.P. Numerical Recipes in C, the Art of Scientific Computing. 2nd Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar) incorporated into Program A and developed by C. J. Chiu, R. Chang, J. Diverno, and D. P. Ballou at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI). Simulations were carried out by using numerical integrations of the differential equations for the reaction sequences using a fourth order Runge-Kutta algorithm (22Press W.H. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Flannery B.P. Numerical Recipes in C, the Art of Scientific Computing. 2nd Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar), also in Program A. For studies with free flavin, usually FAD was used. Typically, an ∼50 μm solution was placed in a glass tonometer in the presence of 0.05 m potassium Pi, pH 7.0, 15 mm EDTA, and 500 μm protocatechuic acid. A catalytic amount of protocatechuate dioxygenase was placed in the side arm of the tonometer. The contents of the tonometer were made anaerobic by repeated cycles of evacuation and subsequent equilibration with high quality argon, and finally left under positive pressure of argon for transfer to the stopped flow apparatus. The flavin was reduced by shining visible light from a commercial sun-gun, mixed with the protocatechuate dioxygenase, and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min (to remove any residual oxygen) before loading into the stopped flow spectrophotometer at 25 °C and mixed with various concentrations of Ph2I+ or other solutions, as described in the text. For experiments with flavoproteins, the same protocol was followed, except that reduction of the enzyme was accomplished in the tonometer by introducing the reductant from a side arm. The reaction of Ph2I+ with reduced FAD at pH 7.0 results in a relatively rapid spectral change, as shown in Fig.1. The extent of spectral change was independent of the concentration of Ph2I+, a finding of considerable mechanistic importance, as will be developed later. The progress curves at all concentrations of Ph2I+ and at all wavelengths from 320 to 500 nm were fit satisfactorily to a single exponential, yieldingk obs values that were linearly dependent on Ph2I+ concentration, and that in each case did not show any systematic variation with the wavelength of observation. Such experiments were repeated over the pH range of 6.0–8.5, with similar results in terms of the extent of spectral changes involved and the linear dependence of reaction rate constant on Ph2I+ concentration. The observed second order rate constants were, however, dependent on pH (Fig.2), indicating a pK afor the reaction of 6.7. This pH dependence strongly suggests that the primary reaction of Ph2I+ is with the reduced flavin anion, because reduced flavins are known to have an almost identical pK a value (23).Figure 2The pH dependence of the rate constant for reaction of reduced FAD with diphenyliodonium chloride. The rate constants were obtained from stopped flow experiments at 25 °C, as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In separate experiments carried out under identical conditions, but in anaerobic cuvettes, similar spectral changes to those shown in Fig. 1were observed. In those experiments it could be further shown that on exposure to air there was no further spectral change, indicating that there was no remaining reduced flavin, and that most of the reduced flavin had been consumed in formation of adducts. Some, however, had been converted to oxidized flavin in the anaerobic reaction. As will be described below, this was estimated to be ∼20% of the total flavin. Fig. 1 shows the calculated spectrum of the reaction mixture with this percentage of oxidized flavin subtracted from the observed final spectrum. The spectrum of the adduct mixture indicates species with remaining absorbance in the 400–500-nm region, as well as absorbance maxima at 370 and 330 nm. The nature of this mixture will be considered below. The results described are not fully consistent with the model of Tew and require a substantial portion of the reaction to occur through what appears to be direct reaction of reduced flavin with Ph2I+, without any radical intermediates. This conclusion is based on comparison with simulations to Scheme 2. In this scheme, reaction steps 1 and 2 represent the mechanism proposed by Tew (7Tew D.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10209-10215Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), simplified to take into account that the primary iododiphenyl radical fragments on a picosecond time scale to the more stable phenyl radical and iodobenzene (24Duplatre G. Jonah C.D. Radiat. Phys. Chem. 1984; 24: 557Google Scholar). However, this mechanism must be expanded to include reaction 4, the well known rapid dismutation of flavin radical to a mixture of oxidized and reduced flavin (25Land E.J. Swallow A.J. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2117-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The rate constants k 4 andk 5 are known, at pH 7.0, being 6 × 108 and 2 × 106m−1 s−1, respectively (25Land E.J. Swallow A.J. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2117-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 26Massey V. Palmer G. Ballou D.P. King T.E. Mason H.S. Morrison M. Oxidases and Related Redox Systems. University Park Press, Baltimore1973: 25-49Google Scholar). Thus, for an appreciable yield of adducts and finite formation of oxidized flavin, k 2 in the above scheme has to be very large, ∼ 107m−1s−1 or greater. However, in the absence of direct reaction between reduced flavin and Ph2I+ (reaction 3 in Scheme 2, with rate constant k 3), simulations show that the percentage of oxidized flavin increases markedly with the concentration of Ph2I+, the reaction time profile is frequently not fit with a single exponential, and the observed rate constants are not linear with Ph2I+ concentration, appearing to reach a saturation value at high concentrations. It is also necessary to include a step involving the nonproductive removal of phenyl radicals (exemplified by reaction 5 and rate constant k 6in Scheme 2). In the absence of such a step, simulations show frequently the transitory accumulation of oxidized flavin in excess of the final, a situation that we have never encountered experimentally. The only situation that approximates to the observed results is inclusion of k 3 that can compete effectively with the radical formation step, k 1. The best fits to the pH 7.0 data are in fact determined with a ratio ofk 1/k 3 ∼0.5, with numerical values of ∼250 and ∼500 m−1s−1, respectively, and with negligible contribution from the radical recombination step k 2. The extent of total reaction proceeding through step 2 is of course quite dependent on the initial concentration of reduced flavin. Within experimental error we have not observed dependence of the composition of the final products on the initial reduced flavin concentration, provided that the latter is no greater than one-tenth of the lowest Ph2I+ concentration used, i.e. that the observed reaction is pseudo first order. Addition of a phenyl residue to the reduced flavin ring could give rise to different products, with the phenyl substitution at the C4a, N5, or C8a positions, as shown in Structures 1–3. Reaction of reduced FMN with Ph2I+, described under “Materials and Methods,” resulted in a mixture of products, as shown by HPLC (Fig.3). A similar result was reported by Covès et al. (10Covès J. Lebrun C. Gervasi G. Dalbon P. Fontecave M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) for reaction of reduced FAD with Ph2I+.Figure 3HPLC separation of the reaction mixture from reduced FMN and diphenyliodonium chloride. The gradient used was 20% CH3CN in 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.7 (5 min), followed by 20–50% CH3CN in 20 mmammonium acetate, pH 5.7 (30 min), and products were monitored at 350 nm. The peak (marked with an asterisk) eluting at 18 min was unstable and disappeared within 1 h. It probably represents the N5-phenyl adduct.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Unfortunately, some of the products were not very stable, making identification difficult. To obtain enough material for characterization, the bulk reaction mixture obtained from reaction of reduced FMN and Ph2I+ was chromatographed on C-18-based Sep-Pak columns. After loading on the column, buffer salts and excess Ph2I+ were removed by thorough washing with water before fractionation with acetonitrile-water mixtures. The first compound, which was eluted with water and 1% CH3CN, was underivatized FMN (∼20% of the starting material). The next compound isolated from the reaction mixture was eluted with 2% CH3CN. Evaporation of the solvent yielded a compound with a blue fluorescence, characterized by an excitation maximum at 360 nm and an emission maximum at 430 nm. This compound was found to be unstable; hence, we could not obtain good NMR and mass spectral data. However, its visible spectrum showed an absorption band at 364 nm with tailing into the 400 nm region, and the absorption maximum was shifted to 342 nm in 6 n HCl. This hypsochromic shift in acid is reported to be a general characteristic of flavin N5 adducts (27Hemmerich P. Ghisla S. Hartmann U. Müller F. Kamin H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. University Park Press, Baltimore1971: 83-105Google Scholar). Based on this property, it is concluded that this adduct probably has the structure shown as Structure 2. This adduct is presumably responsible for the peak at 18 min in the HPLC separation (Fig. 3). The spectroscopic properties of this and the other isolated adducts are summarized in Table I.Table ISpectroscopic properties of isolated adductsND, not determined. Open table in a new tab ND, not determined. Elution of the Sep-Pak column with 2–2.5% CH3CN gave a fraction whose UV-visible spectrum changed slowly over the course of days, corresponding to the peak at 15 min in the HPLC profile of Fig.3. Immediate evaporation of the solvent by Speed-Vac resulted in a yellow solid with absorption maxima at 320, 332 (sh), and a broad band centered around 400 nm. The fluorescence spectrum showed excitation peaks at 320 and 460 nm with emission maximal at 530 nm. The nonagreement of the absorbance and fluorescence excitation spectra indicated that this fraction was a mixture of at least two compounds. An apoflavodoxin column (28Mayhew S.G. Strating M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 59: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was employed for further purification. Adducts were bound to the column as a pink band. After washing with 10 mm potassium Pi, 0.3 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, what proved to be still a mixture of adducts was eluted with 5% TCA in 0.3 mm EDTA. After removal of the TCA by extraction with ether, the solution was rechromatographed on a small Sep-Pak column with H2O:CH3CN mixtures. Several minor fractions were eluted with water that had 320- and 332-nm maxima, but with variable secondary bands between 360 and 500 nm. The main fraction, eluted with 5% CH3CN, and had absorbance maxima at 320, 332, and 432 nm (Fig. 4). This fraction was evaporated to dryness at room temperature to prevent any further decomposition and dissolved only when ready to use. Fig. 4 shows the titration of this adduct with apoflavodoxin in 0.05m potassium Pi, pH 7.0, resulting in a dramatic shift in the absorption spectrum. From this titration, it can be estimated that the K d for binding to apoflavodoxin is <1 μm, and the extinction coefficients of the free flavin can be calculated to be ε318 = 24,000m−1 cm−1, ε332 = 23,000 m−1 cm−1, and ε430 = 8,500 m−1cm−1. Despite the impressive isosbestic points of the spectra of Fig. 4, the1H NMR spectrum of the new flavin was quite complex and appears to be the result of a mixture of two compounds. The addition of a phenyl ring to the flavin was evidenced by the appearance of new complex signals in the aromatic region between 7.2 and 7.4 ppm, and there were three methyl signals that were shifted upfield compared with normal FMN (observed at δ 1.57, 1.61, and 1.63 ppm). An additional two-proton signal was observed at δ 4.37 ppm (Table I). From the UV-visible spectra, it was predicted that C8 of flavin is involved in the formation of this adduct and detailed analysis of the1H NMR spectrum is consistent with its being a mixture of two C8-phenyl adducts having Structures 3 and 4 in the ratio of ∼65:35, Structure 3 comprising CH3 signals at δ 1.57 and 1.63 ppm, and the signal at δ 1.61 ppm resulting from Structure FT4. Further support for Structure FT4 comes from the mass spectral data, which showed a molecular ion peak at 549 mass units; the observed increase of 94 units suggests the addition of a phenyl and a hydroxyl group to the FMN (Structure FT4). The addition of one phenyl group to FMN accounts for an additional 77 mass units, giving rise to the observed peak at m/e 533 (Structure 3). It is known that flavodoxin forms a red protein-bound chromophore on photoirradiation in presence of certain alcohols or acids (29Mayhew S.G. Massey V. Bray R.C. Engel P.C. Mayhew S.G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. de Gruyter, Berlin1984: 261-267Crossref Google Scholar). A 1,8-dihydroflavin structure with a substituent at the C8 carbon was assigned to this chromophore on the basis of detailed NMR studies (30Müller F. Vervoort J. van Mierlo C.P.M. Mayhew S., G. van Berkel W.J.H. Bacher A. Edmonson D.E. McCormick D.B. Flavins and Flavoproteins. de Gruyter, Berlin1987: 261-270Google Scholar). A flavin benzoquinoid structure with similar spectral properties was also assigned to the primary photoproduct of flavins and phenylacetate (31Brüstlein M. Knappe W.-R. Hemmerich P. Angew. Chem. Internat. Edit. 1971; 10: 804-806Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Structures 3 and 4 are also consistent with spectral changes associated with a pK a of 6.5 (λmax of the protonated species 320, 470 nm), probably because of ionization of the N1 position (data not shown). Structures 3 and 4, with extended conjugation through the benzoquinoid structure of the flavin, would also be consistent with the unusual spectral properties of the components of this fraction. An adduct with a similar spectrum has been reported by Covès et al. (10Covès J. Lebrun C. Gervasi G. Dalbon P. Fontecave M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) from reaction of Ph2I+ with FAD. Further elution of the Sep-Pak cartridges with 2.5–3% CH3CN afforded a pale yellow nonfluorescent solution with absorption maximum at 364 nm. This fraction corresponds to the double peak around 19 min in the HPLC of Fig. 3. The negative ion FAB Mass spectroscopic data showed an M+−1 at 533 mass units, consistent with the addition of a single phenyl group to FMN. The1H NMR data showed two clear singlets for the two aromatic methyls and the complex multiplets observed in the aromatic region account for the extra phenyl protons. The possible sites for the adduct formation are either N5 or C4a. Distinction between these two structures was made by making use of 13C NMR, as well as absorption spectral changes in 6 n HCl. An N5 adduct corresponds structurally to reduced flavin, and the 13C signal for the C4a carbon in an N5 adduct is expected to be around the same region as that of the reduced flavin, which is 103 ppm (32Moonen C.T.W. Vervoort J. Müller F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The13C NMR spectrum of the adduct has no signal around the region ∼103 ppm, consistent with the adduct involving the C4a position. It is reported that flavin-C4a adducts show a bathochromic shift in 6 n HCl, which is observed as a general characteristic property irrespective of the substituent (27Hemmerich P. Ghisla S. Hartmann U. Müller F. Kamin H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. University Park Press, Baltimore1971: 83-105Google Scholar). The adduct obtained in the present reaction showed a bathochromic shift of 22 nm in 6 n HCl from 364 to 388 nm, further supporting Structure 1. Addition of a phenyl group to the C4a could occur from either side of the tetrahedral carbon to give rise to two diastereomers, evidenced by the double peak at ∼19 min in Fig. 3. These two isomers could be resolved by HPLC using an isocratic run with 20% CH3CN in 20 mm NH4OAc, pH 5.7, over a period of 20 min. The two isolated peaks were identical in t"
https://openalex.org/W2312610460,"Molecular interactions among cell cycle and DNA repair proteins have been described, but the impact of many of these interactions on cell cycle control and DNA repair remains unclear. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21, is known to be involved in DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest and blocking DNA replication and repair. Participation of p21 has been implicated in nucleotide excision repair. However, the role of p21 in the base excision repair (BER) pathway has not been thoroughly studied. In the present investigation, we treated isogenic mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines containing wild-type (MEF-polbeta) or DNA polymerase beta (polbeta) gene-knockout (MEFpolbetaKO) with oxidative DNA-damaging agent, plumbagin, and examined its effect on p21 levels and BER activity. Plumbagin treatment caused a S-G(2)/M phase arrest and cell death of both MEF cell lines, induced p21 levels, and decreased p21-mediated long-patch (LP) BER by blocking DNA ligase activity in the polbeta-dependent pathway and by blocking both FEN1 and DNA ligase activity in polbeta-independent pathway. These findings suggest that plumbagin induced p21 levels play a regulatory role in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and polbeta-dependent and -independent LP-BER pathways in MEF cells."

Both IF1 and STF1 inhibit F1, whereas the proposed function for STF2 is to facilitate the binding of IF1 and STF1 to F1. The oligomerization properties of yeast IF1and STF1 have been investigated by sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation and by covalent cross-linking. Both techniques confirm that IF1 and STF1 oligomerize in opposite directions in relation to pH, suggesting that both proteins might regulate yeast F1F0-ATPase under different conditions. Their effects on bovine F-ATPases are also described. Whereas bovine IF1 inhibits yeast F1-ATPase even better than yeast IF1 or STF1, the capability of yeast IF1 to inhibit the bovine enzyme is very low and decreases with time. Such an effect is also observed in the study of the homologous inhibition of yeast F1-ATPase. Yeast inhibitors are not as effective as their bovine counterpart, and the complex seems to dissociate gradually.

Yeast inhibitors are not as effective as their bovine counterpart, and the complex seems to dissociate gradually. 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid The F1Fo-ATP synthase complex plays a central role in energy transformation in most living organisms. In mitochondria, the synthesis of ATP requires an electrochemical proton gradient across the inner membrane to drive protons back into the matrix through the membrane domain of the F1F0-ATPase, releasing energy, which is coupled to ATP synthesis. When a cell is deprived of oxygen, its electrochemical gradient collapses, and the enzyme switches from ATP synthesis to ATP hydrolysis. In mitochondria, this hydrolytic activity is thought to be regulated by the natural inhibitor protein, IF1. The binding of IF1 to ATP synthase depends on the pH value, and below neutrality, its inhibitory capacity increases (1Panchenko M.V. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1985; 184: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Bovine IF1 is a basic protein 84 amino acids in length (2Pullman M.E. Monroy G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3762-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it has two oligomeric states, tetramer and dimer, favored by pH values above and below 6.5, respectively (3Cabezón E. Butler P.J.G. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25460-25464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Dimerization of bovine IF1, the active form of the protein, occurs by formation of an antiparallel α-helical coiled-coil between the C-terminal regions of monomers (4Cabezón E. Runswick M.J. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6990-6996Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 5Gordon-Smith D.J. Carbajo R.J. Yang J.C. Videler H. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Neuhaus D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This arrangement places the inhibitory regions at distal ends of the dimer, allowing the active form to bind two F1 domains simultaneously (6Cabezón E. Arechaga I. Butler P.J.G. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28353-28355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The structure also reveals that at high pH values, dimers associate into tetramers and higher oligomers via coiled-coil interactions in the N-terminal and inhibitory regions, preventing IF1 from binding to ATP synthase. Homologues of bovine IF1 have been characterized in mitochondria from rats (7Cintron N.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3439-3443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (8Hashimoto T. Negawa Y. Tagawa K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and plants (9Norling B. Tourikas C. Hamsur B. Glaser E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Their primary sequences are well conserved, particularly over residues 14–47 (bovine numbering), which have been defined as the minimal inhibitory sequence (10Van Raaij M.J. Orriss G.L. Montgomery M.G. Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15618-15625Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, at least three proteins appear to be involved in the regulation of ATP synthase, namely, IF1, STF1, and STF2. Both IF1 and STF1 protein bind to F1, whereas STF2 binds to the Fo domain, and it has no inhibitory activity itself (11Hashimoto Y. Yoshida Y. Tagawa K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Its proposed function is to facilitate the binding of IF1 and STF1 to F1 (12Hashimoto Y. Yoshida Y. Tagawa K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because the oligomerization state of bovine IF1 determines the activity of the protein, the oligomerization properties of the yeast proteins have been investigated by sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation and by covalent cross-linking. Both techniques show that IF1 and STF1 oligomerize in opposite directions in relation to pH. Their effects on F-ATPases from other species are also described. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) or by acid hydrolysis and amino acid analysis. The molecular masses of yeast IF1 and STF1 proteins were verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a Sciex API III+ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The folding of proteins was assessed from their two-dimensional (1H,1H) nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy NMR spectra recorded with Bruker AMX 500 and DMX 600 spectrometers. Samples of proteins for analytical ultracentrifugation were dialyzed overnight against the required buffer (2 liters) in a cellulose membrane tubing with a molecular mass cutoff of 2 kDa (Spectrum Laboratories, Inc., Haverhill, UK). The expression plasmid pRKIF1 contains the coding sequence for the entire bovine IF1 (10Van Raaij M.J. Orriss G.L. Montgomery M.G. Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15618-15625Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing STF1 and yeast IF1 were made by amplification of genomic DNA from S. cerevisiae by PCR. For the IF1 gene, the forward primer TAG-GAA-TTC-CAT-ATG-TTA-CCA-CGT-TCA-CGA-TTA-GCA and the reverse primer CGA-AAG-CTT-TTA-TTT-GGT-CAT-CGA-GTC-AAT-TTT were used. The forward primer TAG-GAA-TTC-CAT-ATG-TCA-GAT-GGT-CCT-CTC-GGT-GGT and the reverse primer CGA-AAG-CTT-TCA-CTT-TGA-AAG-GTT-ATT-AAT-TTT-GTT were used for the STF1 gene. The PCR fragments were digested with NdeI and HindIII and ligated into pMW172 (13Way M. Pope B. Gooch J. Hawkins M. Weeds A.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The overexpression of bovine IF1 and the related yeast proteins was carried out as described previously (3Cabezón E. Butler P.J.G. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25460-25464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Bovine and yeast IF1 and STF1 were eluted from a S-Sepharose column at 0.35m on a linear gradient of 0–1 m sodium chloride in TEP buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.001% (w/v) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). In all cases, pooled fractions containing the protein were dialyzed against TEP buffer again and applied to a Q-Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. Whereas bovine IF1 emerged on a linear gradient of 0–1m sodium chloride at 0.4–0.5 m, yeast IF1 and STF1 did not bind to the column, and both proteins were recovered in the breakthrough. The recovery of bovine and yeast IF1 proteins was about 80 mg per 6 liters of culture. However, STF1 was overexpressed relatively poorly, and about 20 mg of pure protein was recovered per 6 liters of culture. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XLA analytical ultracentrifuge, using an An-60Ti rotor, with the proteins at either pH 5.0 (in 20 mm sodium cacodylate, 0.15m NaCl), pH 6.5 (in sodium phosphate, ionic strength 0.1m), or pH 8.0 (in sodium phosphate, ionic strength 0.1m). All experiments were performed at 5.0 °C and at speeds between 18,000 and 21,500 rpm, with scanning at 230 nm. Cells were filled almost completely (400-μl sample) to give data over a wide range of concentrations in each cell, at a variety of initial concentrations. After an initial scan, the centrifuge was overspeeded at 1.5× the final speed for 6 h to reduce the time taken to reach equilibrium (14Van Holde K.E. Baldwin R.L. J. Phys. Chem. 1958; 62: 734-743Crossref Scopus (455) Google Scholar), and then the speed was reduced, and another scan was taken, followed by additional scans at intervals of 24 h. When successive scans were indistinguishable, the later scan was taken as being operationally at equilibrium, and scans, averaging over 100 readings, were taken for analysis. Subsequently, the centrifuge was overspeeded to sediment the macromolecule away from the meniscus, before slowing to equilibrium speed and taking an additional scan to establish the effective base-line absorbance for each cell. The apparent partial specific volume (φ′), used for analysis of the data for both proteins, was measured from the density increment (∂ρ/∂c 2)μ, (15Casassa E.F. Eisenberg H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1964; 19: 287-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) for the yeast STF1 protein, at pH 5.0, by Equation1, ∂ρ∂c2μ=(1−φ′ρ0)Equation 1 where ρ is the density of a solution containing a concentration (c 2) of the macromolecular component at dialysis equilibrium with all the diffusible components, and ρ0 is the solvent density. Densities for the solution and solvent were measured using an oscillating densitometer (16Kratky O. Leopold H. Stabinger H. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 98-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) (model DMA60 with a DMA602 cell; Anton Paar, Graz, Austria). The protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. Data were analyzed initially by taking overlapping sets of 41 datum points to calculate the apparent weight average molecular mass (M̄ w,app), taken to be at the concentration of the middle point, by nonlinear regression with Equation 2 (15Casassa E.F. Eisenberg H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1964; 19: 287-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), M̄w,app=dln(c)dr22RTω2(1−φ′ρ0)Equation 2 where c is the concentration (as optical density) at radius r, and ω is the angular velocity (in radians/s), and plots of M̄ w,app against c were made, using the program Profit version 5.1.2 ppc (Quantum Soft, Zürich, Switzerland). Concentrations were calculated from the optical densities using the appropriate molar extinction coefficient for a protein monomer, which had been calculated from the spectrum and the protein concentration (again determined by amino acid analysis). Visual inspection of these plots allowed an appropriate model to be selected for further analysis of possible aggregation by directly fitting the absorbance against radius data (17Johnson M.L. Straume M. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhäuser, Boston1994: 37-65Crossref Google Scholar), using Profit with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (with error estimates in absorbance from the recorded data) for selected models. In practice, it was found that both an ideal monomer-dimer association and a nonideal monomer model were required to fit the data for the proteins (under different conditions). For both models, the following simplification of the equations was employed, ς=M1(1−φ′ρ0)ω22RTEquation 3 where M 1 is the monomer molecular mass, and ς is a scaling factor. For an ideal monomer-dimer association, the monomer concentration (c 1,0) at the reference radius (r 0) can be calculated from the total concentration by the equation, c1,0=−Kd+Kd2+8Kd(A0−δA)/ɛ14Equation 4 where K d is the dissociation coefficient,A 0 is the absorbance atr 0, ε1 is the molar extinction coefficient for monomer (and it is assumed that that for the dimer will be twice this), and δA is the base-line absorbance. The absorbance (A r) at every radius (r) was then calculated from Equation 5. Ar=ε1(c1,0exp(ς(r2−r02))+2(c1,0exp(ς(r2−r02)))2Kd)+δAEquation 5 A nonideal solute can be described by Equation 6 (15Casassa E.F. Eisenberg H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1964; 19: 287-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 18Eisenberg H. Biological Macromolecules and Polyelectrolytes in Solution. Clarendon Press, Oxford1976Google Scholar) (assuming that only the second virial coefficient need be considered), (1+2Bcr)crdcr=M(1−φ′ρ0)RTrdrEquation 6 where B is the molar second virial coefficient (inm−1), c r is the molar concentration of the macromolecules at radius r, andM is the “monomer”. This leads to Equation 7, cr=c0exp(ς(r2−r02)−2B(cr−c0))Equation 7 where c 0 is the reference concentration of macromolecules at r 0. This expression can be fitted to the data by evaluating c r againstr and then converting into absorbance with Equation 8, Ar=ɛ1cr+δAEquation 8 Because Equation 7 is transcendental (i.e. c r appears on both sides), it was evaluated numerically for each radius, by fitting c rsuccessively until the change was less than 10−5 of the final value. (The reference radius (r 0) was taken two-thirds down the column, and the reference concentration (c 0) was evaluated here.) With both models, fitting was carried out with parameters for error in the base line, as well as for K d or B,respectively. Residuals were plotted against radius to assess the goodness of fit and, in particular, to see any systematic deviation rather than random error due to noise in the data. Theoretical curves forM̄ w,app against c were also plotted onto the experimental plots, using the fitted parameters, so that the fit could be seen. Cross-linking of amino groups in IF1and STF1 with dimethyl suberimidate was carried out as described previously (3Cabezón E. Butler P.J.G. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25460-25464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The samples were dissolved at a protein concentration (determined by bicinchoninic acid method) of about 0.5 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.001% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. Then, the protein concentration was adjusted to 0.15 mg/ml by dilution with dialysis buffer, and dimethyl suberimidate (freshly dissolved at 20 mg/ml in the same buffer) was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The mixture was kept for 3 h at room temperature. After that time, samples (10 μl) were removed, dissolved in sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Activities of recombinant bovine and yeast IF1 and STF1 were assayed at two different pH values for the inhibition of ATPase activity of isolated bovine, yeast, and Escherichia coli F1-ATPase (19Lutter R. Abrahams J.P. Van Raaij M.J. Todd R.J. Lundqvist T. Buchanan S.K. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Bovine IF1, yeast IF1, or STF1 was mixed in a 2-fold molar excess with yeast F1-ATPase (3 μg) or bovine F1-ATPase (7 μg) to give a total volume of 100 μl in a buffer of 10 mmMOPS1-NaOH, pH 6.6, 1 mm EDTA, 0.001% (w/v) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The substrate MgATP (1 μl of a neutralized 200 mm solution) was added to the mixture. After incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, the ATPase activity was estimated by transferring 10 μl of the mixture to 1 ml of ATPase assay mixture at 37 °C and measuring the decrease in the absorbance of NADH at 340 nm for 3 min. Control activity (100%) was determined by prior incubation of F1 at each pH and in the absence of any inhibitor. The ATPase assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris-sulfate, pH 8.0, 50 mm potassium chloride, 2 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, pyruvate kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (20 μg/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (10 μg/ml), 0.2 mm NADH, 1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 2 mm MgATP, and either 50 mm Tris-sulfate, pH 8.0, or 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 6.6. An additional assay to measure the overall extent of the activity as the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated from ATP was used. Incubation of bovine IF1, yeast IF1, or STF1 in 2-fold molar excess with yeast, bovine, andE. coli F1-ATPase, respectively, was carried out in a similar way. After 5 min at 37 °C, 10 μl of the mixture was transferred to 600 μl of either 20 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 6.6, or 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The substrate MgATP (15 μl of a neutralized 200 mm solution) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 min. Then, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 μl of 10% SDS (w/v). A ferrous sulfate-ammonium molybdate solution (500 μl) was added, and the amount of inorganic phosphate was estimated by measuring the absorbance of the sample at 740 nm (20Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Full activity (100%) is that of F1 in the absence of inhibitors. Negative control activities were determined in the absence of enzyme. Two inhibitors (IF1 and STF1) and at least one modulator (STF2) seem to be involved in the regulation of F1Fo-ATPase fromS. cerevisiae. In this work, recombinant IF1 and STF1 have been overexpressed, purified, and characterized. The correct folding of both proteins was assessed from their two-dimensional (1H,1H) nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy NMR spectra. The spectra showed the proteins to be well structured and highly helical because the spectra were densely populated with cross-peaks including many between backbone amide signals. Their molecular masses (see TableI) were verified by mass spectrometry analysis.Table ICharacterization of yeast STF1 and IF1 proteinsɛ230aMolar extinction coefficients at 230 and 280 nm.ɛ280aMolar extinction coefficients at 230 and 280 nm.Molecular massbMolecular masses in daltons.m−1Yeast STF124,5902,2707,327.9Yeast IF114,29044.757,382.8a Molar extinction coefficients at 230 and 280 nm.b Molecular masses in daltons. Open table in a new tab The apparent partial specific volume (φ′) of STF1 was measured at pH 5.0. The densities of a protein solution at dialysis equilibrium with the buffer and also the buffer were measured as 1.012003 and 1.008537 g/ml, respectively. Amino acid analysis gave a protein concentration of 1.729 mm, corresponding to 12.60 mg/ml. These values give a (∂ρ/∂c 2)μ (density increment) of 0.2751, with φ′ = 0.7188 ml/g. This value, together with ρ0 =1.008537 g/ml, was used for all calculations of the molecular mass because the two proteins are highly homologous and have similar amino acid compositions, so it was not expected that the correct value would vary significantly between the proteins or with pH. Spectra for the proteins, together with their concentrations, gave the molar extinction coefficients shown in Table I. (It should be noted that neither protein contains any tryptophan residue and that the yeast inhibitor protein also lacks any tyrosine residues, explaining the very low molar extinction coefficients found at 280 nm.) The oligomeric states of yeast IF1 and STF1 proteins have been investigated at various pH values by sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation. Aggregation of STF1 is affected markedly by pH. At pH 5.0, a nonideal monomer is seen, withB = 500 m−1, whereas at either pH 6.5 or 8.0, a monomer-dimer association is apparent, withK d = 45 or 2 μm, respectively (Fig.1). Therefore, the protein aggregates increasingly strongly with increasing pH (i.e. the value ofK d becomes lower). By contrast, yeast IF1 shows a lesser effect of pH on the aggregation, but this is in the opposite direction, with K dincreasing with pH, giving values of 1.2, 6.0, and 9.1 μmat pH 5.0, 6.5, and 8.0, respectively (Fig.2). Therefore, the protein aggregates less strongly with increasing pH.Figure 2Effect of pH on the aggregation of the yeast IF1 protein. Plots of the apparent weight average molecular mass against total protein concentration are shown at pHs 5.0, 6.5, and 8.0 (A, B, and C, respectively). Individual calculated values from several cells are shown on theleft, together with a curve calculated from the “best fit” model (see “Materials and Methods”). Examples of plots of the residuals between the measured and calculated absorbance at each radius, from the fitting of individual cells to the optimum model, are shown on the right. In practice, all pH values were best fitted as monomer-dimer equilibria.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The oligomeric states of both proteins were also examined at pH 8.0 by covalent cross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate (Fig.3). The products from bovine IF1 contain the monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer, as described previously (3Cabezón E. Butler P.J.G. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25460-25464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In contrast, only weak dimer formation was observed with yeast IF1. Dimer and a weak trimer formation was observed for STF1, indicating that this protein aggregates at higher pH values (it should be noted that the protein concentrations used here are slightly higher than those used in the sedimentation equilibrium analysis). Therefore, these results are in good agreement with those obtained by analytical ultracentrifugation, showing in both cases that yeast IF1 and STF1oligomerize in opposite directions. No pairwise combination between the two proteins was observed. Bovine IF1 inhibits yeast F1-ATPase even better than yeast IF1 or STF1 at both pH values tested (96% and 98% of inhibition, respectively) (Fig.4). The standard ATPase activity assay carried out at pH 8 (Fig. 4 A) shows that in contrast to the stable inhibition by the bovine inhibitor protein, the yeast IF1 loses its capacity to inhibit yeast F1-ATPase during the course of the reaction, becoming almost completely inactive after 3 min. The quantitative analysis shows that yeast IF1 inhibits about 30% of the yeast F1-ATPase activity (Fig. 4 B), but the kinetic analysis (Fig. 4 A) also reveals that inhibition is lost with time. STF1 has almost no effect on the activity of yeast F1-ATPase under the conditions employed. As described under “Materials and Methods,” the complexes were previously incubated at pH 6.6 and then transferred to the reaction mixture at pH 8 for the activity assay. Therefore, the observed effect of the yeast inhibitor could be that the change in pH affects the binding, and therefore the complex is gradually dissociated. At pH 6.6 (Fig. 4, C and D), the activity assay shows that yeast IF1 and STF1 inhibit 90% and 70% of the activity of yeast F1-ATPase, respectively. However, the kinetic analysis reveals that after 3 min of reaction, the capability of yeast IF1 to inhibit the enzyme decreases slightly, an effect even more evident in the case of the STF1 protein. Therefore, yeast inhibitors seem to be much more sensitive to pH than bovine IF1, which inhibits F1 at pH 8 during the 3 min of reaction, provided that the complex has been formed at a lower pH. However, it seems that even at a low pH, yeast inhibitors are not as effective as their bovine counterpart, and the complex dissociates gradually. Yeast IF1 and STF1 have been reported to bind to yeast F1-ATPase competitively (21Hashimoto Y. Yoshida Y. Tagawa K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 102: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, when the two proteins were added simultaneously, the observed inhibition was the same as that induced by yeast IF1 alone, and there was no evidence for competition (data not shown). The presence of several inhibitors and regulators in yeast suggests that the inhibition system is complex and that a combination of them may be required to inhibit the enzyme fully. The standard ATPase activity assay carried out at pH 8 (Fig.5 A) shows that in contrast to the bovine inhibitor protein, yeast IF1 fails to inhibit bovine F1-ATPase. The protein loses its capacity to inhibit the enzyme after a few seconds of reaction, and, after 1 min, bovine F1-ATPase activity is increased more than 100% with respect to the control. The STF1 protein has no effect on bovine F1-ATPase. As described previously for yeast F1-ATPase, an explanation for the observed effect of the yeast inhibitor on bovine F1-ATPase could be that the change in pH affects the binding, and therefore yeast IF1 is quickly released from F1 under those conditions. Protein release could increase the turnover of F1, increasing the activity of the enzyme to almost 120%, as shown in Fig. 5 A. At pH 6.6 (Fig. 5,C and D), although the capability of yeast IF1 to inhibit the bovine enzyme also decreases with time, after 3 min of reaction the protein is still able to inhibit more than 40% of the activity. Yeast IF1 and STF1protein were added together to the incubation mixture, but the observed effect was the same as that of yeast inhibitor alone (data not shown). The fact that at pH 6.6 and in the presence of yeast IF1, bovine F1 is still 60% active, in contrast to the 10% activity found in the yeast enzyme, could reflect a specificity of binding for the inhibitor. However, bovine IF1 is able to inhibit yeast F1-ATPase even better than the bovine enzyme. Yeast and bovine IF1 appear to compete for the binding to bovine F1 because when the two proteins are added together to the incubation mixture, the activity of the enzyme decreases to 73% inhibition, in comparison with 60% and 95% inhibition with yeast and bovine IF1 alone, respectively. However, an alteration in the order in which both proteins are added showed a different effect. If bovine IF1 is added first, followed by yeast IF1, the one bound first is not displaced by the second, and the activity is the same as that measured for the bovine inhibitor (5%). When the proteins are added in the opposite order, the result was the same as that seen when the two proteins were added together at the same time (27% activity). 2E. Cabezón and J. E. Walker, unpublished observations. These results suggest that the binding of bovine IF1 is more stable, and, once the complex is formed, it is not affected by the presence of the yeast inhibitor. In contrast to the inhibition system in yeast, only IF1 appears to be required for the inhibition of bovine F1-ATPase. Yeast IF1, STF1, and bovine IF1 proteins are well conserved, especially in the region of the minimal inhibitory sequence (Fig.6). Dimerization of bovine IF1 has been shown to be crucial for the binding to bovine F1-ATPase (6Cabezón E. Arechaga I. Butler P.J.G. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28353-28355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The structure reveals that the inhibitory N-terminal regions are at the opposite ends of the dimer, and therefore, the protein can bind two F1 domains simultaneously. Yeast inhibitors so similar in primary sequence might be expected to inhibit in a similar way. However, the work presented here reveals that the oligomerization state of these proteins is different from that of bovine IF1. Neither of the yeast proteins tetramerize at high pH values in the range of concentrations used. An important issue surrounding the action of these yeast inhibitors is this: why is more than one inhibitor needed? Because the oligomerization states of yeast IF1 and STF1proteins are influenced in opposite directions by pH, both proteins might regulate yeast F1F0-ATPase under different conditions. Because the yeast IF1 tends to form dimers at lower pH values, and STF1 tends to form dimers at somewhat higher values, IF1 might inhibit F1-ATPase at a lower pH, and STF1 might inhibit F1-ATPase at a slightly higher pH. Because the binding of the STF1 protein is less stable, and the protein dissociates from F1-ATPase faster than IF1(Fig. 4), this faster release might be an advantage for the enzyme to switch more quickly from ATP hydrolysis to ATP synthesis at higher pH values. It has been proposed that in E. coli, the ε-subunit of F1Fo-ATPase (equivalent to the bovine δ-subunit) has two conformations and may function as a “clutch” or “ ratchet” to differentially regulate ATP hydrolysis and synthesis (22Tsunoda S.P. Rodgers A.J.W. Aggeler R. Wilce M.C.J. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6560-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It is highly improbable that the δ-subunits from mitochondrial enzymes can rearrange their structure in a similar way. Neither the chloroplast nor bacterial ATPases are regulated by an inhibitor protein, and yeast and bovine IF1 do not inhibit F1-ATPase from E. coli.2 We thank Dr. D. Muller and M. Bowler for kindly supplying yeast F1-ATPase protein. We also thank Dr. I. Feanley for the mass spectrometry analysis and D. Owen for performing amino acid analysis."

A colorectal carcinoma cell line, HCT116, which has both mutated and wild-type beta-catenin genes, was engineered by homologous recombination to investigate the significance of beta-catenin gene mutation. As expected, the mutant allele-targeted clones showed decreased beta-catenin expression and downregulation of T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF)-dependent transcription. Morphologically, targeted clones were only minimally altered under usual culture conditions, but under low serum conditions, mutant allele-targeted clones still grew in plane, in contrast to parental cell line and wild allele-targeted clones, which formed spheroids. The mutant allele-targeted clones showed no significant changes in growth rate and anchorage-independent growth in vitro, and displayed rather increased growth in vivo. Although beta-catenin stabilization affects some biological characteristics including adhesive properties, it may not have growth-promoting effects at least in some colorectal carcinomas."

Here we characterize 12 topogenic determinants in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, and identify a novel mechanism by which a charged residue is positioned within the plane of the lipid bilayer. During cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator biogenesis, topology of the C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMs 7–12) is directed by alternating signal (TMs 7, 9, and 11) and stop transfer (TMs 8, 10, and 12) sequences. Unlike conventional stop transfer sequences, however, TM8 is unable to independently terminate translocation due to the presence of a single charged residue, Asp924, within the TM segment. Instead, TM8 stop transfer activity is specifically dependent on TM7, which functions both to initiate translocation and to compensate for the charged residue within TM8. Moreover, even in the presence of TM7, the N terminus of TM8 extends significantly into the ER lumen, suggesting a high degree of flexibility in establishing TM8 transmembrane boundaries. These studies demonstrate that signal sequences can markedly influence stop transfer behavior and indicate that ER translocation machinery simultaneously integrates information from multiple topogenic determinants as they are presented in rapid succession during polytopic protein biogenesis.

These determinants encompass hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments that, together with their flanking residues, interact with cytosolic and ER translocation machinery to initiate and terminate translocation and integrate the polypeptide into the lipid bilayer (reviewed in Refs.1Johnson A. van Waes M.

In the simplest model, topology can be established cotranslationally by alternating topogenic determinants that function as signal (anchor) and stop transfer sequences (4Rothman R.E. Andrews D.W.

As the first signal sequence emerges from the ribosome, it targets the ribosome nascent-chain complex (RNC) to the ER and gates open an aqueous channel in the membrane (the Sec61 translocon) (8Crowley K. Liao S. Worrell V. Reinhart G. Johnson A. Cell. 1994; 78: 461-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Because the ribosome exit site is directly aligned with the axial pore of the translocon, newly synthesized polypeptide is cotranslationally directed into the aqueous environment of the translocon as it emerges from the ribosome (9Menetret J.

Cell. 2001; 107: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Subsequent synthesis of a stop transfer sequence gates the translocon closed to the ER lumen, terminates translocation, and provides the growing nascent polypeptide access to the cytosol (12Liao S. Lin J., Do, H. Johnson A. Cell. 1997; 90: 31-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 13Hamman B. Hendershot L. Johnson A. Cell. 1998; 92: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Through sequential iterations of these events, signal and stop transfer sequences can alternately direct the polypeptide into the ER lumen or the cytosol and thus establish topology of transmembrane segments and lumenal and cytosolic peptide loops. Not all native polytopic proteins utilize a simple cotranslational biogenesis pathway. For example, translocation of peptide loops may be initiated by either upstream (N-terminal) or downstream (C-terminal) signal sequences (14Lu Y. Xiong X. Helm A. Kimani K. Bragin A. Skach W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 568-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Ota K. Sakaguchi M. von Heijne G. Hamasaki N. Mihara K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the latter case, topology of the preceding TM segment can be established in a retrograde manner (i.e. C terminus to N terminus) as the polypeptide moves from the cytosol into the translocon and then into the membrane. Moreover, synthesis of downstream topogenic determinants can also rearrange the topology of preexisting TM segments (16Goder V. Bieri C. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17Wilkinson B. Tyson J. Reid P. Stirling C. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 11: 2973-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus initial, or cotranslational, topology is dynamic and can be subjected to constraints of folding imparted by distant peptide regions. In these latter cases, very little is known regarding how TM segments interact with the ER translocation machinery and, in particular, whether the presence of one segment may influence translocon interactions with preceding or subsequent segments. Studies of membrane integration, however, have demonstrated that TM segments may laterally exit the translocon and integrate into the lipid bilayer independently in pairs or even in groups (19Skach W. Lingappa V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23552-23561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Borel A. Simon S.

Thus the translocon complex appears capable of associating simultaneously with multiple TM segments, raising the possibility that topogenic determinants may act synergistically in directing polytopic topology. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ideal substrate for examining the mechanism of polytopic protein biogenesis. CFTR exhibits a tandem repeat structure that contains two hydrophobic TM domains (TMDs) and two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains (24Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.-S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (5977) Google Scholar). A regulatory domain connects the two halves of the molecule. Both TMDs are predicted to exhibit a similar topology composed of six TM segments with the N and C termini facing the cytosol (25Chang X.-B. Hou Y.-X. Jensen T. Riordan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18572-18575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CFTR is somewhat unusual, in that 7 of its 12 TM segments contain a total of 10 charged residues (2 Lys, 4 Arg, 3 Glu, and 1 Asp), several of which have been implicated in contributing to a channel through which chloride ions are conducted (26Sheppard D. Rich P. Ostedgaard L. Gregory R. Smith A. Welsh M. Nature. 1993; 362: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 27Akabas M. Kaufmann C. Cook A. Archdeacon P. J. Biol.

J. 1998; 74: 1320-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Charged TM residues also influence early events of CFTR folding (14Lu Y. Xiong X. Helm A. Kimani K. Bragin A. Skach W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 568-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 30Chen M. Zhang J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5471-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For example, we previously showed that residues Glu92 and Lys95markedly inhibit TM1 signal sequence activity (14Lu Y. Xiong X. Helm A. Kimani K. Bragin A. Skach W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 568-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As a result, topology of TM1 is directed in part by signal sequence activity of TM2 via a ribosome-dependent post-translational mechanism (31Skach W.R. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 825-831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Little is known about the detailed topogenic behavior of other CFTR TM segments or the effect of endogenous charged residues on the biogenesis process. However, numerous point mutations in TM segments have been implicated in causing cystic fibrosis (32Sheppard D. Welsh M. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), and defects in CFTR folding are the underlying cause of disease in the majority of CF patients (33Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanism by which CFTR assembles into the ER membrane is therefore of central importance. To define the sequence of events that establish CFTR topology, we compared the properties of topogenic determinants encoded within TMD1 and TMD2. We now show that during biogenesis of TMD1, neither TM1 nor TM3 efficiently initiates translocation. This contrasts distinctly with corresponding segments in TMD2 (TM7 and TM9), both of which function as signal sequences. Detailed examination of TM7 and TM8 further revealed that a charged residue within TM8 (Asp924) interferes with TM8 stop transfer activity and confers an unexpected flexibility on TM8 boundaries. This enables N-terminal flanking residues to extend a significant distance into the ER lumen. Moreover, TM7 was specifically required for TM8 stop transfer activity because TM8 failed to terminate translocation when engineered into an otherwise secretory protein containing a cleaved signal sequence. These studies suggest that in addition to functioning as a signal sequence, TM7 also enables ER translocation machinery to properly recognize TM8 as a transmembrane segment thus positioning D924V in the plane of the membrane. Moreover, they provide evidence that stop transfer activity can be regulated in a novel and complex manner as multiple transmembrane segments are presented to the translocon in rapid succession during polytopic protein biogenesis. Plasmids TM1–3, TM1–4, TM1–5, and TM1–6 were constructed by PCR amplification of plasmid pSPCFTR (34Hasegawa H. Skach W. Baker O. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V. Verkman A.

A methionine residue was engineered at CFTR codon 837 to initiate translation. Fragments and vector (S.L.ST.gG.P) were digested withNcoI/BstEII and ligated. Point mutations were introduced into plasmid pSPCFTR by site-directed mutagenesis using the PCR overlap extension method as described (36Ho N. Hunt H. Horton R. Pullen J. Pease P.

Oocyte homogenate was aliquoted on ice, and proteinase K (0.2 mg/ml final concentration) and Triton X-100 (1%) were added as indicated. Samples were incubated on ice for 1 h. Residual protease was inactivated by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 mm) and rapid mixing with 10 volumes of 1% SDS, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, preheated to 100 °C and incubating at 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were then diluted in 10 volumes of Buffer A (0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0). X. laevis oocytes samples were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min to remove insoluble debris. Anti-prolactin antisera (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) were added at 1:1000–1:2000 dilution and preincubated for 10–30 min, and 5.0 μl of protein A Affi-Gel (Bio-Rad) was added. Samples were rotated at 4 °C overnight and washed 3× with Buffer A and twice with 0.1 m NaCl and 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, prior to addition of SDS sample buffer. Fidelity of protease protection was typically 85–95% as determined by a secretory control protein. Following immunoprecipitation, samples were eluted from protein A beads by incubation in 0.1% SDS, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, at 100 °C for 2 min. Supernatant was split into 2 aliquots, and endoglycosidase H (100 units) was added to 1 aliquot prior to incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. Samples were dried, dissolved in SDS loading buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Samples were analyzed on 12–17% gradient gels by SDS-PAGE, EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) fluorography, and autoradiography. Representative autoradiogram were scanned using a Umax PowerBook III scanner and Adobe Photoshop software. All quantitation was performed using a Bio-Rad Personal Molecular PhosphorImager Fx (Kodak screens, Quantity-1 software). Band intensities were calculated based on background-corrected volume-averaged pixel intensity. Translocation efficiencies were calculated from protease-protected, detergent-sensitive peptide relative to non-digested material. For protected fragments, signal intensity was corrected for the fractional methionine content based on fragment size. Calculations show average of at least three experiments ± S.E. To compare the behavior of topogenic determinants encoded within CFTR TMD1 and TMD2, coding sequences were truncated after each TM segment and tagged at the C terminus with a translocation reporter derived from bovine prolactin. This reporter has been extensively studied; it contains no intrinsic topogenic information, and it passively and faithfully follows the direction of upstream topogenic determinants (4Rothman R.E. Andrews D.W. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10470-10480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Chavez R. Hall Z. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 40Shi L.-B. Skach W., Ma, T. Verkman A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8250-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Predicted topology, location of methionine residues, and truncation sites of TMD1 and TMD2 are shown schematically in Fig. 1. Fusion proteins were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes as described under “Materials and Methods.” The advantage of this system is that X. laevis oocytes efficiently process functional CFTR and thus recapitulate physiological translocation events. In addition, oocyte homogenates yield uniform right-side-out ER membranes amenable to standard protease protection assays (i.e. lumenal protein domains are protected from exogenously added proteinase K in the absence but not the presence of a non-denaturing detergent). A signal sequence N-terminal to the reporter would thus direct translocation into the ER lumen resulting in protease protection, whereas a preceding stop transfer sequence would terminate translocation and orient the reporter in the cytosol. If CFTR utilized a simple cotranslational biogenesis mechanism, then TMs 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 should function as signal anchor sequences and initiate translocation of ECLs. TMs 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 would be expected to exhibit stop transfer activity. However, within TMD1, TM1 and TM3 were very inefficient at initiating translocation (21 and 10% of nascent chains, respectively, Fig.2 A,lanes 1–3 and7–9). This is consistent with previous studies (14Lu Y. Xiong X. Helm A. Kimani K. Bragin A. Skach W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 568-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 30Chen M. Zhang J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5471-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and indicates that translocation of ECL1 and ECL2 must be facilitated by additional topogenic determinants. It has been shown previously that TM2 is both necessary and sufficient to direct topology of ECL1 (14Lu Y. Xiong X. Helm A. Kimani K. Bragin A. Skach W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 568-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and it is likely that topology of ECL2 is similarly established by signal anchor activity(ies) of TM4 or TM3–4 acting in concert. As translation continues, translocation is cotranslationally reinitiated by TM5 and terminated by TM6 to properly orient ECL3 in the ER lumen. In contrast to TMD1, translocation of TMD2 is reinitiated sequentially by signal anchor sequences within TMs 7, 9, and 11 and terminated by stop transfer sequences within TMs 8, 10, and 12 (Fig. 2 B). Thus, each TM segment acquires its final topology in a simple cotranslational manner as it exits the ribosome. Several constructs, TM7–9 and TM7–11, give rise to multiple protease-protected fragments (Fig. 2 B,lanes 7–9 and 13–15). This is likely due to the relative accessibility and cleavage of cytosolic loops by protease. One striking difference between TMD1 and TMD2 was the efficient signal and stop transfer activities of TM7 and TM8 as compared with their N-terminal counterparts TM1 and TM2. In addition, TM8 is particularly susceptible to disease-related CF mutations (Cystic Fibrosis Genetic Analysis Consortium, www. genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr). Nine point mutations involving eight residues have been reported within TM8 in CF patients, and an additional seven mutations are located in TM8 flanking regions (Fig. 3 A). We therefore focused attention on this region to better understand how TM7–8 contributes to CFTR biogenesis under normal and pathologic conditions. Initial studies examined the effect of five CF-related missense mutations on the topology of TM8. The coding region of TM7–8 was isolated and engineered upstream of the translocation reporter, and topology was determined by protease protection. This analysis was simplified by the presence of two endogenous N-linked glycosylation consensus sites between TM7 and TM8 at residues Asn894 and Asn900 in ECL4 and by a third consensus site upstream of TM7. In the wild type construct, two sites are efficiently glycosylated consistent with translocation of the TM7–8 loop into the ER lumen (Fig. 3 B). Glycosylation was confirmed by Endo H digestion (Fig. 3 C). In addition, TM8 C-terminal residues were cytosolic and accessible to protease (Fig.3 D). Because TM7 translocates its C terminus and spans the membrane with Ncyt/Clum topology (Fig.2 B), topogenic information encoded with TM7 and TM8 was thus entirely sufficient to establish proper topology of ECL4. Interestingly, none of the CF-related mutations significantly affected topology. In all cases, the nascent chain was doubly glycosylated, and the translocation reporter remained cytosolic (Fig. 3 D). Although TM8 terminates translocation when it follows TM7, the P-reporter was protected from protease in ∼14% of nascent chains. This is not excessive given the sensitivity of the assay. However, the D924V mutation consistently resulted in a 10-fold decrease in the amount of reporter translocated (Fig. 3 D). This was particularly interesting given that the hydropathy profile of TM8 reveals a weakly hydrophobic segment broadly extending from Ser912 to Ser945 (34 residues) (Fig.4 A). The D924V mutation replaces a charged residue near the middle of the predicted TM8 segment and thus significantly increases TM8 hydrophobicity. We therefore tested the effect of D924V mutation on TM8 stop transfer activity by engineering TM8 together with its flanking residues into a chimeric cassette previously used to define stop transfer sequences derived from bitopic and polytopic proteins (Fig. 4 B) (4Rothman R.E.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cassette contains an N-terminal cleaved signal sequence followed by two passenger domains derived from α-globin (N-terminal to TM8) and prolactin (C-terminal to TM8). In this context, WT TM8 was surprisingly inefficient at terminating translocation; passenger domains on both sides of TM8 were protected from protease (70%) and hence translocated into the ER lumen (Fig. 4 B and Fig. 5). Note that this chimera contains an additional glycosylation site within the globin passenger and two glycosylation sites at CFTR codons Asn894 and Asn900 and therefore frequently migrates as a doublet consisting of triply glycosylated (top band) and doubly glycosylated bands (lower band, Fig. 4 B). Glycosylation was confirmed by Endo H digestion (data not shown). Similar results were observed for TM8 containing mutations Y917C, R933S, H939D, and H939R (Fig. 5). The D924V mutation, however, markedly improved TM8 stop transfer activity and terminated translocation in ∼90% of polypeptides, all of which acquired Nlum/Ccyt topology (Figs. 4 B and 5). Although TM8 terminates translocation when it follows TM7, it does not terminate translocation when initiated by a cleaved signal sequence. Moreover, this unusual property is due in part to the presence of a charged residue, Asp924, within the hydrophobic core of the TM segment. This suggests that during biogenesis of TMD2, TM8 interacts with the Sec61 translocon in a manner different from usual stop transfer sequences. We therefore used the accessibility of N-linked glycosylation consensus sites as a means to measure these interactions. Utilization of lumenal glycosylation consensus sites in membrane proteins is dependent on their accessibility to oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), which is related to distance of the site from the ER membrane. Lumenal loops of polytopic membrane proteins exhibit a relatively sharp decrease in glycosylation when consensus sites are closer than 12 residues from the C terminus and 14 residues from the N terminus of TM segments (43Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Popov M. Tam L., Li, J. Reithmeier R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18325-18332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). CFTR residues Asn894 and Asn900 within ECL4 are thus close to the threshold needed for efficient glycosylation (see Fig.6 A). Conversion of Asn900 to Gln and introduction of a new consensus site at codon 903 revealed that Asn903 was glycosylated with the same efficiency as WT protein even though it was only nine residues from TM8 (Fig. 6 B). Glycosylation was verified by Endo H digestion (Fig. 6 C). In addition, a naturally occurring CF-related mutation T908N, which introduces a consensus site just four residues from TM8, was also efficiently glycosylated both in the WT context and in the N900Q mutant (Fig. 6 B,lanes 7–12). This latter finding is consistent with previous studies (45Hammerle M. Aleksandrov A. Chang X. Riordan J. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) showing that T908N is also glycosylated in full-length CFTR expressed in mammalian cells. Alteration of"

Phospolipase A2 (EC 3.1.1.4, PLA2) 1The abbreviations used are: PLA2, phospholipase A2; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; DLS, dynamic light scattering; r.m.s., root mean-square; DAAD, Deutsche Akademische Ausdienst. enzyme specifically cleaves the sn-2 acyl ester bond of phospholipids (1Gelb M.H. Jain M.K. Hanel A.M. Berg O.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 653-658Google Scholar). These enzymes were first described as components of snake venoms and were later identified in mammals. PLA2s of mammalian origin were found in the pancreas (2Waite M. Handbook Lipid Res. 1987; 5: 155Google Scholar), blood platelets, macrophages, and neutrophils (3Ono T. Tojo H. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. Okamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5732-5738Google Scholar, 4Kudo I. Murakami M. Hara S. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 117: 217-231Google Scholar). These are also found in fluids derived from patients with inflammatory conditions (5Green J.A. Smith G.M. Buchta R. Lee R., Ho, K.Y. Rajkovic I.A. Scott K.F. Inflammation. 1991; 15: 355-367Google Scholar, 6Smith G.M. Ward R.L. McGuigan L. Rajkovic I.A. Scott K.F. Br. J.

It is understood that the concentrations of PLA2 enzymes in serum and tissues correlate with the disease severity in several immune-mediated inflammatory pathologies in humans. These are also associated with the onset of rheumatoid arthritis (7Pruzanski W. Keystone E.C. Sternby B. Bombardier C. Snow K.M. Vadas P. J. Rheumatol. 1988; 15: 1351-1355Google Scholar, 8Jamal O.S.

Therefore, it is of great interest to develop specific inhibitors for each of these enzymes. Several crystal structures of the tetrahedral mimic inhibitors with an sn-2-phosphate, substituent, l-1-(O-octyl-2-(heptyl phosphonyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, complexed with secreted PLA2 from Chinese cobra venom (10White S.P.

Science. 1991; 254: 1007-1010Google Scholar) have been reported. Also the crystal structure of an sn-2-acyl-amino analogue of phospholipids complexed with the engineered (without the residues of the surface 62–66) porcine PLA2 (13Thunnissen M.M.G.M. Eiso A.B. Kalk K.H. Drenth J. Dijkstra B.W. Kuipers O.P. Dijkman R. de Haas G.H. Verheij H.M. Nature. 1990; 347: 689-691Google Scholar) has been determined. The crystal structures of the complexes of bovine pancreatic PLA2 with an inhibitorn-dodecyl-phosphorylcholine (14Tomoo K. Ohishi H. Ishida T. Inoue M. Ikeda K. Sumiya S. Kitamura K. Proteins: Struct. Funct. Genet. 1994; 19: 330-339Google Scholar) and human synovial PLA2 with an acyl amino analogue of phospholipids (15Cha S.-S. Lee D. Adams J. Kurdyla J.T. Jones C.S. Marshall L.A. Bolognese B. Abdel-Meguid S.S. Oh B.-H. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3878-3881Google Scholar) are also of some interest. Recently, a series of indole inhibitors of human secretory PLA2 were developed (16Schevitz R.W. Bach N.J. Carlson D.G. Chirgadze N.Y. Clawson D.K. Dillard R.D. Draheim S.E. Hartley L.W. Jones N.D. Mihelich E.D. Olkowski J.L. Snyder D.W. Sommers C. Wery J.-P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 458-465Google Scholar). Further, there is an example of a natural inhibition (17Perbandt M. Wilson J.C. Eschenburg S. Mancheva I. Aleksiev B. Genov N. Willingmann P. Weber W. Singh T.P. Betzel C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 573-577Google Scholar) where specific interactions from one molecule of a heterodimer acts as a natural inhibitor for the other. The synthetic peptides derived from the primary sequence of the PLA2 itself were also studied as specific inhibitors (18Tseng A. Inglis A.S. Scott K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23992-23998Google Scholar,19Church W.B. Inglis A.S. Tseng A. Duell R. Lei P.W. Bryant K.J. Scott K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33156-33164Google Scholar). The kinetic studies (18Tseng A. Inglis A.S. Scott K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23992-23998Google Scholar, 19Church W.B. Inglis A.S. Tseng A. Duell R. Lei P.W. Bryant K.J. Scott K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33156-33164Google Scholar) support their high inhibitory potencies. These peptide inhibitors were stable against acyl esterase as well as phospholipase A1, C, and D. Therefore, they were suited for in vivo studies where phospholipids may be more readily metabolized. As part of the program on structure-based rational design of specific potent inhibitors using a model snake venom phospholipase A2, we have synthesized a number of peptides (20Makker, J., Design, Synthesis, Structure Analysis, and Applications of Peptides Using α,β-dehydro-amino Acid Residues.Ph.D. thesis, 2002, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.Google Scholar). One of these peptides Phe-Leu-Ser-Tyr-Lys (FLSYK) was earlier reported to be binding to PLA2 (18Tseng A. Inglis A.S. Scott K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23992-23998Google Scholar, 19Church W.B. Inglis A.S. Tseng A. Duell R. Lei P.W. Bryant K.J. Scott K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33156-33164Google Scholar). It has been shown to be having a high potency to inhibit PLA2. To determine the mode of its binding and details of its interactions with PLA2, we have prepared its complex with phospholipase A2 in solution. The complex was crystallized and its detailed crystal structure is reported here. The structure clearly shows that the peptide binds to PLA2 through its hydrophobic channel and forms a number of interactions with the protein molecule including the active site residues His-48 and Asp-49. It also shows that the placement of the inhibitor with respect to PLA2 enzyme in the complex is very different than that reported earlier by modeling studies (19Church W.B. Inglis A.S. Tseng A. Duell R. Lei P.W. Bryant K.J. Scott K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33156-33164Google Scholar). Hence, the nature and number of interactions between the inhibitor and the PLA2 differ greatly in the two studies. PLA2 was purified from crude venom of Daboia russelli pulchella. The venom was obtained from Irula Snake Catchers Industrial Society Limited, Chennai, India. The purification procedure used in this work was developed in our laboratory as reported earlier (21Chandra V. Nagpal A. Srinivasan A. Singh T.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 925-926Google Scholar). It involves an affinity step on Cibacron blue matrix and an ion exchange chromatography on CM Sephadex C-25. The peptide was synthesized using an automated solid phase peptide synthesizer PS3 (Rainin). The resin used was Fmoc-Lys-Wang resin and solvent used for synthesis was dimethylformamide (DMF). In the first step, Fmoc-Lys-Wang resin was deprotected by 20% piperidine in DMF to form H2N-Lys-Wang resin. The uronium salt 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) in the presence of the baseN-methylmorpholine (NMM) activated the amino acid to form an active ester of Fmoc-Tyr-OH. This was coupled with H2N-Lys-Wang resin to get Fmoc-Tyr-Lys-Wang resin. The above procedure was repeated for the rest of the amino acids until the complete sequence Fmoc-Phe-Leu-Ser-Tyr-Lys-Wang resin was formed. The resin was cleaved from the peptide with trifluoroacetic acid. The peptide was purified by reverse phase chromatography on C18PepRPC column (1.6 × 10 cm, Amersham Biosciences). The purity of the peptide was confirmed by determining the sequence of amino acids in the peptide with the protein sequencer PPSQ-21A (Shimadzu, Japan). The purified enzyme was used for inhibition and binding studies. The inhibitory assays with 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:10, and 1:20 molar ratios of enzyme and the peptide FLSYK were carried out. 1.5 μm enzyme was incubated separately with 0.750, 1.0, 15.0, and 30.0 μm of inhibitory peptide FLSYK in 20 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0 at 25 °C for 12 h. In these experiments, the 1,2-dithio analogue of diheptanoyl phosphatidylcholine having a CMC value of 4 × 10−4m (22Lio Y.C. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1392: 320-332Google Scholar) was used as a substrate (PLA2 assay kit, Cayman Chemicals, MI). The substrate 1,2-dithio analogue of diheptanoyl phosphatidylcholine was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Upon hydrolysis of the thiol ester bond at thesn-2 position by PLA2, free thiols were liberated, which were detected using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) at 414 nm. The control reaction was carried out in the absence of inhibitor. The binding data were analyzed for saturation binding and Scatchard transforms using GraphPad PRISM software (GraphPad software, Inc. San Diego, CA 92121, www.graphpad.com). The nonlinear regression analysis was used to calculate the dissociation constant. As reported earlier (23Chandra V. Kaur P. Srinivasan A. Singh T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1117-1126Google Scholar, 24Chandra V. Kaur P. Jasti J. Betzel Ch. Singh T.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1793-1798Google Scholar) two molecules of PLA2 were found to be associated in the crystalline state and were expected to be in association in solution as well. To establish this assumption, the experiments on size distribution of PLA2 molecules were performed with DLS. The data were generated with a DLS system (Dierks & Partner, Hamburg, Germany) and analyzed using Schulze software (25Schulze, T., Ein Echtheitsystem zür Messung der dynamishen Lichtstreuung in flussigkeitenM.Sc. thesis, 1996, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.Google Scholar). The sample solutions were prepared in sodium cacodylate buffer (20 mm, pH 6.5) made with Milli Q water. To eliminate dust and other large particles, all samples were further filtered on 0.1 μm polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Millipore) prior to measurements. PLA2concentrations were varied from 0.05 to 20 mg/ml at a constant temperature of 25 °C. Samples were manually injected into the flow cell (50 μl) and illuminated by a 25 milliwatt, 600 nm solid state laser. The data were collected in five replicates for each measurement. The crystals of the complex were obtained by co-crystallization of protein with peptide FLSYK. 15 mg of purified and lyophilized PLA2 was dissolved in 1 ml of 20 mm sodium cacodylate buffer at pH 6.5. Peptide FLSYK was added to make the protein/peptide molar ratio 1:10. This solution was incubated for 24 h, and then 20 μl drops of the above mixture were setup in the hanging drop vapor diffusion method with reservoir containing 1.4 m ammonium sulfate and 3% dioxane in the same buffer. Well shaped rectangular crystals of dimensions up to 0.5 × 0.4 × 0.3 mm3 were obtained at 25 °C within 2 weeks. The crystals of the complex were stabilized in 15% glycerol as a cyroprotectant for data collection at low temperature. A single crystal was mounted in a nylon loop and frozen in a flash of nitrogen stream at 100 K. The crystals diffracted to 1.8 Å resolution. The x-ray intensity data were collected on the EMBL beamline X-11 at DESY, Hamburg with λ = 0.98 Å using MAR 345 imaging plate scanner with 1.0o rotation for each image. The data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK program packages (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 176: 307-326Google Scholar).

Several cycles of positional refinement with restrained individual B-factor refinement and rounds of 3000 K simulated annealing allowed the correct tracing of flexible loops where the conformations were found to be considerably different from the initial model. At the end of this stage, the R-factor dropped to 0.227 while R-free came down to 0.271. Both Fourier (2Fo−Fc) and difference Fourier (Fo−Fc) maps computed at this stage clearly indicated the presence of the peptide FLSYK in the binding site of molecule A (Fig. 1). On the other hand, there was no continuous density in the binding regions of molecule B. The presence of three clearly separated spherical densities were interpreted as water molecules (Fig.2). Since, the presence of FLSYK in molecule A and its absence in molecule B were unexpected results, the 2Fo−Fc and Fo−Fc maps were calculated at various cutoffs at different stages of refinement, but it did not indicate the presence of peptide FLSYK in molecule B. A further round of rigid body refinement and several rounds of positional and restrained individual B-factor refinements were subsequently performed for both molecules with the peptide FLSYK bound to molecule A in the binding region. At the end of this stage, some missing side chains appeared more clearly, and the FLSYK electron density in molecule A improved further. Four significant peaks above 3ς in Fo−Fc and 1ς in 2Fo−Fc electron density maps were identified as acetate ions according to the shape of the electron densities in the vicinity of positively charged side chains of Arg-43(A) and Arg-107(B). These maps were also used to determine the positions of 279 water molecules. The final round of 3000 K simulated annealing coupled with positional refinement and restrained individual B factor refinement, yielded an R-factor of 0.205 (R free = 0.225). The final refinement statistics are given in Table II. The final coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 1JQ9.Figure 2The difference (Fo−Fc) map showing the presence of three water molecules in the hydrophobic channel of molecule B.

However, the results of DLS showed that the mean hydrodynamic radius (RH) of PLA2 in the protein concentration ranging from 0.05 to 20 mg/ml was 2.54 nm. The molecular mass corresponding to this hydrodynamic radius was estimated to be 28 kDa (29Schmitz K.S. An Introduction to Dynamic Light Scattering by Macromolecules. Academic Press, Boston1990Google Scholar, 30Dahneke B.E. Measurement of suspended particles by Quasi Elastic Light Scattering. Wiley, New York1983: 199-236Google Scholar). The polydispersity values in these estimations were below 15% of the average radius, indicating that all the PLA2molecules existed in the dimeric form in solution (Fig.3 a). It may be mentioned here that the approximate radius calculated from the crystal structure for the monomer and dimer were 1.1 nm and 2.2 nm, respectively. Furthermore, the gel filtration profile also indicated the molecular weight of 28 kDa. Thus, the above results clearly show that the two molecules of PLA2 exist in association in the solution state. The percentage inhibition values of PLA2 by peptide FLSYK at different molar ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:10, and 1:20 of enzyme to peptide FLSYK were estimated. At all these concentrations of the peptide FLSYK the levels of enzyme inhibition were found to be lower than 50%. The higher molar concentrations of FLSYK with respect to the enzyme PLA2 were expected to show more than 50% levels of inhibition. However, the inhibition of the enzyme did not exceed the level of 50% (Fig. 3 b). The data presented in Fig.3 b indicated that the peptide FLSYK interacted only with 50% of the PLA2 molecules. It may be mentioned here that the calculated Bmax obtained from the above binding studies was 0.56 nmol, which also corresponded to the 50% binding of the enzyme molecules. As seen from Fig 3 b, it is clear that the peptide binds to one PLA2 molecule of the homodimer. On adding the micellar substrates, the portion of the second molecule of the homodimer may sit against the substrate vesicles with an attached FLYSK to the first molecule. Then in the absence of the inhibitor, in the micellar environment the two molecules separate from each other, and each binds to the phospholipid interface to produce its catalytic effects. The enzyme kinetics shows a complex behavior and hence cannot be described in terms of standard parameters. In this case, the calculated value of the dissociation constant (K d) was found to be 3.57 ± 0.05 × 10−9m. The final model consists of two asymmetrically associated PLA2 molecules, one peptide molecule bound to one PLA2 molecule, four acetate ions, and 299 water molecules. The refinement of the final model converged to an R-factor of 20.5% for all data without a ς cutoff in the resolution range of 20.0–1.8 Å excluding 5% randomly distributed reflections assigned to calculate R free(22.5%). In the Ramachandran plot (31Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1968; 23: 283-438Google Scholar), 93.3% of the residues were in the most allowed regions and the remaining 6.7% in the additionally allowed parts of the map (TableII). The structure of PLA2 is based on the well defined electron density for both molecules. The peptide FLSYK was clearly defined in molecule A with an excellent electron density (Fig. 1). The corresponding region in molecule B contained only three water molecules (Fig. 2). The dispersion precision indicator (32Cruickshank, D. W.

The gel filtration profile and the DLS scattering studies had indicated the association of two molecules in solution. Similarly the crystal structure of the complex contains two crystallographically independent molecules A and B in the form of an asymmetric dimer. The overall size of the dimer in the crystals was found to be ∼48.4 × 30.7 × 20.4 Å3 and the total interface area between the two molecules is ∼1299 Å2. In the dimer the entrance to the hydrophobic channel of molecule A opens into the interface whereas that of molecule B has its opening to the surface. The overall conformations of molecules A and B were found to be essentially similar. The r.m.s. shift for the Cα positions in the two molecules was found to be 0.8 Å. Three regions which showed significantly larger variations contained the Trp-31-containing loop (residues 25–34), the β-wing consisting of two antiparallel β-strands (residues 74–85) and the C-terminal residues 119–133. However, the most striking difference was observed in the orientations of Trp-31. The values of torsion angles ϕ, ψ, χ 1The abbreviations used are: PLA2, phospholipase A2; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; DLS, dynamic light scattering; r.m.s., root mean-square; DAAD, Deutsche Akademische Ausdienst., and χ2 for Trp-31 in molecules A and B were −109°, −19°, −166°, 78° and −129°, 172°, −57°, −86°, respectively. In the dimer, three weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds: (A) Leu-2 N ··· (B) Lys-131 O = 3.4 Å; (A) Leu-3 N ··· (B) Lys-131 = 3.4 Å; and (A) Leu-111 O ··· (B) Gln-108 Nδ2 = 3.1 Å are formed. There are additional hydrogen bonds through structured water molecules. The interface has a high concentration of hydrophobic residues producing a good number of hydrophobic interactions between the two molecules but the most important interactions were observed involving Trp-31 of molecule A, which formed van der Waals contacts with Arg-43, Phe-46, and Val-47 of molecule B. These interactions determined the orientation of the side chain of Trp-31 in molecule A. The electron density for the peptide in molecule A was exceptionally clear (Fig. 1), which allowed a detailed description of the interactions between PLA2 and the peptide FLSYK. As seen from Fig.4, the peptide is completely buried in the binding pocket of molecule A. On the other hand, the corresponding region in molecule B contained only three water molecules (Fig. 2) as the entry of the peptide to the binding site was hindered by the side chain of Trp-31 (Fig. 5). The structure shows that the binding of peptide FLSYK is stabilized by a number of hydrogen bonds (Fig. 6) and a large number of van der Waals interactions (data not shown). It is noteworthy that the lysine of the peptide interacts with the enzyme rather extensively (Fig. 6). It also nullifies the charge effect of Asp-49, which plays a major role in stabilizing substrate during catalytic mechanism (36Scott D.L. White S.P. Otwinowski Z. Yuan W. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1541-1546Google Scholar). Furthermore, the peptide also forms important hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Tyr-28, Gly-30, and Gly-32 of the Trp-31-containing loop in a manner similar to the coordinating interactions provided by calcium ion if present in the structure. Yet another important interaction involving peptide carboxylic group and His-48 Nδ1 curtails the ability of His-48, to extract a proton from crucial conserved water molecule for initiating the catalytic mechanism (36Scott D.L. White S.P. Otwinowski Z. Yuan W. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1541-1546Google Scholar). It may be noted that the critical water molecule, which bridges His-48 to Asp-49 in the native structure is absent in the present complex. It has, apparently been displaced by the peptide FLSYK.Figure 5Association of molecules A and B showing long interface. The passage to the active site via the hydrophobic channel at the interface is indicated by arrows. The opening of the channel in molecule B is constrained by the positioning of Trp-31 side chain and indicated by X. This figure was drawn with MOLSCRIPT (49Kraulis P.J. J.

https://openalex.org/W2044790709,"In its host erythrocyte, the malaria parasitePlasmodium falciparum resides within a parasitophorous vacuole, the membrane of which forms a barrier between the host cell cytosol and the parasite surface. The vacuole is a unique compartment because it contains specific proteins that are believed to be involved in cell biological functions essential for parasite survival. As a prerequisite for the characterization of the vacuolar proteome, we have developed an experimental approach that allows the selective biotinylation of soluble vacuolar proteins. This approach utilizes nonpermeant biotin derivatives that can be introduced into infected erythrocytes after selective permeabilization of the erythrocyte membrane with the pore-forming protein streptolysin O. The derivatives gain access to the vacuolar lumen but not to the parasite cytosol, thus providing supportive evidence for the existence of nonselective pores within the vacuolar membrane that have been postulated based on electrophysiological studies.

Gormley J.A. Taraschi T.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 2Ward G.E. Miller L.H. Dvorak J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 237-248PubMed Google Scholar) and, presumably, parasite-derived proteins and lipids (3Dluzewski A.R. Mitchell G.H. Fryer P.R. Griffiths S. Wilson R.J. Gratzer W.B. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 527-532PubMed Google Scholar). This membrane presents a barrier between parasite and host cell cytosol, although electrophysiological studies in Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes suggest the existence of nonselective pores within the PVM that allow passive bidirectional diffusion of small molecules (4Desai S.A. Krogstad D.J. McCleskey E.W. Nature. 1993; 362: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 5Desai S.A. Rosenberg R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2045-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). With respect to biogenesis and protein contents, the PV differs significantly from endocytic vacuoles (6Lingelbach K. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1467-1475PubMed Google Scholar), with the most apparent difference being the almost cytosolic pH of the vacuole (7Bosia A. Ghigo D. Turrini F. Nissani E. Pescarmona G.P. Ginsburg H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Wunsch S. Horrocks P. Gekle M. Lanzer M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In recent years, many observations have indicated a number of cell biologically relevant processes within the vacuole that are important for parasite survival. In the course of the infection, several parasite proteins are exported into the erythrocyte, and some of these proteins, such as the members of the PfEMP1 family, are key molecules involved in the pathogenesis of malaria (9Cooke B. Coppel R. Wahlgren M. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 416-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For at least some exported proteins, the PV is a transit compartment from which they are transported into the host cell cytosol (10Ansorge I. Benting J. Bhakdi S. Lingelbach K. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 11Wickham M.E. Rug M. Ralph S.A. Klonis N. McFadden G.I. Tilley L. Cowman A.F.

Chem. 2001; 276: 26838-26845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Translocation across the vacuolar membrane must be a selective process because other proteins are retained within the PV (13Knapp B. Hundt E. Nau U. Küpper H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 32: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Culvenor J.G. Crewther P.E. J. Protozool. 1990; 37: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that proteins destined for the parasite apicoplast, a unique plastid-like intracellular organelle of apicomplexan parasites, also may be trafficked via the PV (15Cheresh P. Harrison T. Fujioka H. Haldar K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16265-16277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the PV must contain a machinery involved in protein sorting. Upon completion of parasite development and multiplication, merozoites, the invasive stages, are released from the infected cell. Release of merozoites from the PV can be prevented by treatment of infected erythrocytes (IRBCs) with protease inhibitors (16Salmon B.L. Oksman A. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In addition, evasion of merozoites is accompanied by a specific sequential cleavage of the major merozoite surface protein 1 that is essential for the subsequent reinvasion of noninfected cells (17Guevara Patino J.A. Holder A.A. McBride J.S. Blackman M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1689-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These data suggest a role of vacuolar proteases in the release of parasites from the infected host cell. Collectively, the current observations underscore the notion that the PV is a unique intracellular compartment critical for parasite survival within the host cell and that it most likely contains novel proteins of elementary functions. The volume of the vacuole compared with the volumes of the parasite cytosol and the erythrocyte cytosol, respectively, is very small. Estimates based on morphological data suggest a 1:10,000 ratio of vacuolar volume to erythrocyte cytosol in IRBCs infected with stages of the parasite that have completed ∼30 h of the 48-h intraerythrocytic development (12Burghaus P.A. Lingelbach K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26838-26845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cell fractionation experiments on IRBCs infected with the same developmental stages show that more than 70% of the total protein are erythrocyte cytosolic proteins, predominantly hemoglobin (18Ansorge I. Jeckel D. Wieland F. Lingelbach K. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, the isolation of vacuolar proteins is difficult; consequently, only a few vacuolar proteins have been identified thus far. In this report, we describe a novel strategy for the identification of vacuolar proteins as a prerequisite for a comprehensive proteome analysis of this compartment. Biotin derivatives sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido) ethyl-1–3dithiopropionate (sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin), sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate (sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin), and streptavidin (SAv)-conjugated agarose beads were obtained from Pierce. l-[35S]Methionine was obtained fromAmersham Biosciences. Streptolysin O (SLO) was kindly provided by S. Bhakdi and prepared as described elsewhere (10Ansorge I. Benting J. Bhakdi S. Lingelbach K. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies directed against GBP, SERP, parasite aldolase, and PfBiP have been described previously (12Burghaus P.A. Lingelbach K. J. Biol.

Secondary antibodies against rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase or to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from DAKO A/S. Cy2-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Cy3-conjugated streptavidin were from Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc. Protein A-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Biosciences. Parasites of the P. falciparum FCBR strain were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% human plasma and erythrocytes of blood group A+ (Marburg Blood Bank) under standard conditions (20Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar). Trophozoite-infected erythrocytes (IRBCs) were enriched to a parasitemia of >90% by gel floatation (21Pasvol G. Wilson R.J.M. Smalley M.E. Brown J. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1978; 72: 87-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). For metabolic labeling of newly synthesized proteins, enriched IRBCs were washed twice in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium and cultivated for 1 h in plasma-free, methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium, in the presence of 50 μCi ml−1l-[35S]methionine. IRBCs were permeabilized with SLO as described previously (10Ansorge I. Benting J. Bhakdi S. Lingelbach K. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 108 IRBCs were incubated with 3–4 hemolytic units of SLO in RPMI 1640 medium at room temperature for 6 min. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 s. The pellet containing intact parasites, the vacuolar contents, and membranes was washed with 200 μl of RPMI 1640 medium before biotinylation. Complete removal of the erythrocyte hemoglobin was monitored spectrophotometrically as described previously (10Ansorge I. Benting J. Bhakdi S. Lingelbach K. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For the biotinylation of intact erythrocytes, 108 parasitized or nonparasitized erythrocytes were washed three times in PBS containing 0.6 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.6 (PBS2+), and then incubated in PBS2+ containing 1 mg ml−1 sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin for 30 min on ice. Cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 s at 4 °C. The supernatant was analyzed photometrically at 412 nm for the release of hemoglobin. To block and remove unbound biotin, cells were washed three times in PBS2+ containing 100 mm glycine. For cleavage of extracellularly exposed membrane proteins, an aliquot of the cells was treated with 1 mg ml−1 trypsin for 15 min at 37 °C. The protease was inactivated using soybean trypsin inhibitor at a concentration of 1 mg ml−1 for 15 min on ice. Cells were lysed by repeated freezing and thawing in water supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture containing antipain, chymostatin, aprotinin, trypsin inhibitor, Na-EDTA, pepstatin, leupeptin, and elastatinal, each at a concentration of 1 μg ml−1. A membrane fraction and a fraction of soluble proteins were prepared by centrifugation. For the biotinylation of internal parasite proteins and vacuolar proteins, IRBCs permeabilized with SLO were washed with PBS2+ and then resuspended in an optimal volume, routinely 800 μl, of distilled water containing the above-mentioned protease inhibitors. Lysates were prepared by three cycles of freezing and thawing. Soluble proteins contained in the supernatant after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min were biotin-labeled in PBS2+ containing 1 mg ml−1sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin for 30 min at 4 °C with frequent shaking. The solution was centrifuged at 3,000 × g using a microconcentrator (Millipore Corp.) with a size exclusion of 5 kDa to remove any free biotin. The sample was diluted with water containing the protease inhibitors. This step was repeated twice. For the labeling of soluble vacuolar proteins, permeabilized cells were incubated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin as described above. The solution was centrifuged at 4 °C at 1,300 × g for 5 min, and the sediment of parasite-containing vacuoles was washed three times in 100 mm glycine in PBS2+ to block the unreacted biotin derivative. After a final wash in PBS2+, cells were lysed and processed as above. Biotin-labeled proteins from 2 × 108IRBCs were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads at 4 °C for 2 h under constant shaking. The beads were sedimented by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 s. The supernatant was collected and stored at −20 °C until further use. Beads were washed sequentially in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl), buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, and 500 mmNaCl), buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and, finally, PBS2+. The beads were then washed with 10 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm MgCl2and 5 mm ATP. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS-PAGE sample buffer before analysis. The marker proteins SERP and GBP were precipitated from lysates of IRBCs as follows. After permeabilization of IRBCs and complete removal of the erythrocyte cytosol, parasite-containing vacuoles were lysed osmotically. Soluble proteins in a volume of 100 μl, corresponding to 2 × 107IRBCs, were diluted with 400 μl of distilled water and 500 μl of solubilization buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 4 μg ml−1phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The respective antisera were added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were sedimented by centrifugation, and the supernatant was collected. Proteins were precipitated from the supernatant with 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 10 min. The samples were centrifuged at 4 °C, and the precipitate was washed with ice-cold acetone and dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The protein A-Sepharose beads were washed sequentially with buffers A, B, and C and PBS2+ as described above, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Routinely, proteins were dissolved in SDS sample buffer and separated on 10% or 12% gels under reducing conditions. When proteins were labeled with the cleavable biotin derivative sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, separation was on 5–20% gradient gels under nonreducing conditions. Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining before exposure to x-ray film for the detection of radiolabeled proteins. For two-dimensional PAGE, soluble parasite and vacuolar proteins from 2 × 109 permeabilized IRBCs were precipitated using 3 volumes of 10% trichloroacetic acid in acetone containing 20 mmDTT for 1 h at −20 °C. The proteins were collected by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold acetone containing 20 mm DTT, and dried. Protein extracts were dissolved in 300 μl of a rehydration solution (8 m urea, 2 mthiourea, 4% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid, 4% DTT, 2% ASB (Calbiochem), and 2% immobilized pH gradient buffer pH 4–7 (Amersham Biosciences)) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After rehydration for 24 h under low viscosity paraffin oil, 13-cm immobilized pH gradient strips (AmershamBiosciences) covering a pH range of 4–7 were subjected to isoelectric focusing for 28,000 V-h. After isoelectric focusing, the individual strips were consecutively incubated in equilibration solution A and B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 murea, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, complemented with 3.5 mg ml−1 DTT (solution A) or 45 mg ml−1iodoacetamide instead of DTT (solution B)), each for 15 min. The equilibrated strips were transferred to 12% slab gels and separated in the second dimension. After drying of the gels, radiolabeled bands were visualized by autoradiography. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE or two-dimensional PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. For the detection of biotin-labeled proteins, membranes were blocked using 2% BSA in PBS, pH 7.4, for 1 h at room temperature. Filters were incubated for 20 min with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Pharmingen) diluted 1:10,000 in 2% BSA in PBS, pH 7.4. The membranes were washed three times in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl for 5 min. Biotin-labeled proteins were stained with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate following standard procedures. The same membranes were then incubated with specific rabbit antisera at a dilution of 1:500 for 16 h at 4 °C. Specific marker proteins were detected after incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature and development of the filters using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) following standard procedures. Permeabilized and biotin-treated IRBCs were spread on glass slides and air-dried. Subsequently, they were fixed in acetone-methanol (1:1) for 10 min at −20 °C. The slides were incubated with the primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The monoclonal anti-band 3 IgG was diluted 1:20, and the polyclonal rabbit antisera specific for SERP and aldolase, respectively, were diluted 1:10 in PBS, pH 7.2. After three washes with PBS, pH 7.2, slides were probed with a mixture of the corresponding secondary antibody (1:100) and Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (1:200) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Autofluorescence and nonspecific fluorescence levels were determined by viewing control samples of either biotin-treated or untreated IRBCs not incubated with Cy3-conjugated streptavidin and secondary antibodies. The cells were mounted in glycerol containing 0.1% of the antifade reagent 1,4-diazobicyclo(2,2,2)-octane. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Leica TCS SP2 laser scanning confocal microscope. The intracellular parasite depends on the acquisition of nutrients from the extracellular milieu and from the host cell cytosol. Extracellular nutrients must be taken up across three membranes, the erythrocyte plasma membrane, the PVM, and the parasite plasma membrane. In the course of infection, the erythrocyte plasma membrane undergoes major alterations. Most notably, the transport properties of the membrane change, increasing the influx rates for a number of low molecular weight solutes. The identification of the proteins that mediate these novel transport properties is being pursued intensely (for current reviews, see Refs. 22Kirk K. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 495-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 23Saliba K.J. Kirk K. Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Krishna S. Webb R. Woodrow C. Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments designed to study transport of small solutes across the erythrocyte membrane, we noticed that the membrane-impermeable sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin gained access to the interior of erythrocytes infected with trophozoite-stage parasites, but not to noninfected erythrocytes. Intact noninfected and infected erythrocytes were incubated with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. Cells were lysed in water by repeated freezing and thawing, and soluble proteins were separated from the membrane fraction by centrifugation. Whereas in noninfected cells, no biotin labeling of soluble proteins was detectable (Fig.1, lanes 1 and 3), soluble proteins were found to be biotin-labeled in infected cells (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 7). When intact erythrocytes were treated with trypsin after the biotin reaction, the pattern of biotin-labeled proteins in the membrane fraction changed, due to proteolytic cleavage of externally exposed protein domains (Fig. 1,lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). More importantly, trypsin treatment had little effect on the pattern of biotin-labeled soluble proteins in infected cells (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and7). This result demonstrates that the protease, unlike the biotin derivative, was excluded from the erythrocyte cytosol. Most likely, access of biotin into intact erythrocytes is due to the novel transport properties of the erythrocyte membrane, and we are currently investigating the pathways involved in this process. We never observed that biotin gained access to vacuolar proteins in infected erythrocytes using these experimental conditions (data not shown). We anticipate that internalization of biotin across the intact host cell plasma membrane is limited and that the excess of erythrocyte cytosolic proteins prevented efficient labeling of vacuolar proteins. Although the vacuolar membrane forms a barrier between the parasite surface and the host cell cytosol, it is most conceivable that the PVM allows the transport of nutrients essential for parasite survival. Using a patch-clamp technique, Desaiet al. (4Desai S.A. Krogstad D.J. McCleskey E.W. Nature. 1993; 362: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) measured high conductance channels that are permeable to organic and inorganic anions and cations. The channels are open 98% of the time, and they are highly abundant. In bilayers, this channel allows passage of molecules up to 1,400 Da (5Desai S.A. Rosenberg R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2045-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which is similar to the nonselective pores discovered in the PVM of the taxonomically related parasite Toxoplasma (25Schwab J.C. Beckers C.J.M. Joiner K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The existence of these pores in Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes has not been verified biochemically, but if they exist, they should allow access of membrane-impermeable biotin derivatives that are ∼600 Da in size. To increase access of biotin to the interior of the infected erythrocyte, we utilized SLO to permeabilize the erythrocyte plasma membrane. In an initial assessment of our experimental strategy, infected erythrocytes were permeabilized and, after complete removal of the erythrocyte cytosol, incubated with the membrane-impermeable sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, which was detected using a fluorescent streptavidin derivative (Fig. 2). The images show a distinct ring around the periphery of the intracellular parasite. The biotin co-localizes with the vacuolar marker protein SERP (Fig. 2 A). This location is distinct from the location of the erythrocyte membrane protein band 3 and from the location of the parasite cytosolic protein aldolase (Fig. 2, B andC). In some parts, the streptavidin and the antibody to band 3 co-localize; this is due to the fact that proteins of the erythrocyte plasma membrane also react with the biotin. Little if any biotin was detectable in the erythrocyte cytosol and in the parasite cytosol, respectively. A ring-like staining around the periphery of the parasite can be attributable to a reaction of the biotin with membrane proteins of the PVM and with soluble vacuolar proteins. Because the resolution of fluorescence microscopy does not allow discrimination between a staining of the PVM and a lumenal staining, a more detailed biochemical analysis was performed to assess the biotinylation of soluble vacuolar proteins. Because mammalian erythrocytes have lost the ability to synthesize proteinsde novo, in infected erythrocytes, radiolabeled amino acids are incorporated exclusively into parasite proteins. The following experiment was designed to optimize the biotinylation conditions and the selective isolation of biotinylated proteins by SAv-agarose. Infected cells were cultivated for 30 min in the presence ofl-[35S]methionine, and subsequently, the erythrocyte plasma membrane was permeabilized with SLO to release the soluble contents of the erythrocyte cytosol. In all experiments, the integrity of the PVM and the parasite plasma membrane was assessed as described previously (10Ansorge I. Benting J. Bhakdi S. Lingelbach K. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Parasite-containing vacuoles were lysed by repeated freezing and thawing, and the fraction of soluble proteins was collected after centrifugation. One aliquot of the lysate was treated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, and another aliquot remained untreated. Both samples were incubated with SAv-agarose beads, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer. The fractions of unbound and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 3 A). No radiolabeled proteins from the nonbiotinylated sample bound to SAv-agarose (Fig. 3 A, lane 2), whereas after biotinylation, most radiolabeled proteins were found in the fraction of bound proteins (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). It is noteworthy that the pattern of biotinylated proteins differed from that of the nonbiotinylated proteins and that the bands appeared less focused. This observation is attributable to the variant degrees of biotin labeling of individual polypeptide chains. To assess the effects of biotin incorporation on the electrophoretic motility of proteins, BSA was incubated with different molar ratios of sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the electrophoretic motility of BSA is altered depending on the degree of biotinylation. The subsequent experiments were devised to demonstrate compartment-specific biotinylation of soluble parasite proteins in permeabilized IRBCs. The so-called GBP, the SERP, and parasite aldolase (PfALD) are soluble marker proteins that are located in different compartments of the infected erythrocyte. Aldolase is restricted to the parasite cytosol (19Benting J. Mattei D. Lingelbach K. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), SERP is restricted to the vacuole (13Knapp B. Hundt E. Nau U. Küpper H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 32: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and GBP is found both inside the vacuole and within the erythrocyte cytosol (10Ansorge I. Benting J. Bhakdi S. Lingelbach K. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the first step, it was confirmed that these proteins can be biotinylated and that they bind to SAv-agarose, provided that they are accessible to biotin. This was assessed using lysates of permeabilized infected erythrocytes; infected erythrocytes were permeabilized with SLO, and after complete removal of the erythrocyte cytosol, a lysate containing soluble proteins of the parasite cytosol and of the PV was prepared. One aliquot of soluble proteins was treated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin as described above. Another aliquot remained untreated. The samples were incubated with SAv-agarose beads, and the bound and unbound proteins were analyzed separately by immunoblotting using antisera to the respective marker proteins (Fig.4 A). In the sample of nonlabeled proteins, the three marker proteins were recovered in the fraction of unbound proteins (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 1 and 2). After biotin treatment, GBP, SERP, and PfALD were recovered in the fraction of bound proteins (Fig. 4 A,compare lanes 3 and 4). In the case of GBP and SERP, recovery was almost quantitative. Although recovery was not entirely complete in the case of PfALD, these results demonstrate that the marker proteins are biotinylated and can be isolated on SAv-agarose. After confirmation that all marker proteins are biotinylatable, IRBCs were permeabilized with SLO, washed to remove the contents of the erythrocyte cytosol, and incubated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin. Upon removal of free biotin and lysis of parasites, soluble proteins were immunoprecipitated using antibodies to SERP and GBP, respectively. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Initially, the filters were probed with the SERP and GBP antibodies, and their binding was detected using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Fig.4 B, lanes 1 and 3). Subsequently, the filters were reprobed with peroxidase-conjugated SAv and analyzed by chemiluminescence (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 4). The same analysis was carried out for PfALD, but because the antiserum against aldolase does not immunoprecipitate the protein, the total lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5 and 6). The antisera specifically recognized the marker proteins. The bands that were detectable with SAv were of identical sizes as GBP and SERP, indicating that both proteins were biotin-labeled. No biotin-labeled band corresponding in size to aldolase was detectable; a protein band of smaller size reacted with SAv, but not with the aldolase-specific antibody. Affinity isolation of biotin-labeled proteins on SAv-agarose beads and subsequent analysis by immunoblotting confirmed the compartment-specific labeling of the respective proteins (Fig.4 C). In permeabilized cells, PfALD was not labeled, and, consequently, it was not found in the fraction of proteins bound to SAv, whereas GBP was quantitatively labeled with biotin and recovered. Apparently, in permeabilized cells, the accessibility of the biotin to SERP is restricted; all of the biotin-labeled SERP protein is bound to SAv-agarose beads (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1 and 2); however, a substantial proportion of the SERP molecules remained unbound, obviously because these molecules have not been labeled with biotin (Fig. 4 C, compare lanes 3 and4). A 5-fold increase of biotin in the biotinylation reaction did not result in more efficient labeling of SERP (data not shown). It is noteworthy that in lysates, i.e. when SERP is released, the protein is labeled and binds to SAv quantitatively (Fig.4 A). Although it is possible that the unlabeled protein in Fig. 4 C represents an intraparasite pool of SERP en route to the parasite plasma membrane, we consider this possibility unlikely. In previous experiments, we were unable to detect levels of SERP within the parasite, unless secretion was actively inhibited by the drug brefeldin A (19Benting J. Mattei D. Lingelbach K. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Ansorge I. Benting J. Bhakdi S. Lingelbach K. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It is more likely that, within the vacuole, at least a proportion of the molecule assumes a tight conformation that severely compromises the access of biotin. In no experiments did we detect labeled or unlabeled hemoglobin, the most abundant soluble protein in trophozoite-infected erythrocytes, indicating that the soluble erythrocyte contents had been removed efficiently from permeabilized cells. Although in none of our experiments using SLO-permeabilized erythrocytes were we able to detect biotin-labeled aldolase, we analyzed the fraction of SAv-agarose-bound proteins for the presence of several other intraparasite proteins. In the fraction of proteins that were isolated by affinity chromatography on SAv-agarose beads, we consistently detected PfBiP (26Kumar N. Koski G. Harada M. Aikawa M. Zheng H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 48: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the plasmodial homologue of BiP, a molecular chaperone and endoplasmic reticulum resident protein in eukaryotic cells (Fig.5 A). Because it is possible that some of this protein may not be retained within the parasite's secretory pathway and hence may be transported into the vacuole, we investigated whether PfBiP was biotin-labeled. Permeabilized cells were treated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin and subsequently lysed, and PfBiP was immunoprecipitated. The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. In the first reaction, binding of the anti-PfBiP antiserum was determined using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Fig. 5 B, lane 1). In a second reaction, biotin was detected by chemiluminescence using peroxidase-conjugated SAv (Fig. 5 B, lane 2). Under these conditions, biotin was undetectable, suggesting that recovery of PfBiP in the fraction of proteins that bound to SAv-agarose was due to an interaction of the chaperone with other biotin-labeled proteins. PfBiP did not bind to SAv-agarose beads in the absence of the biotin (Fig. 5 A), ruling out the possibility that the protein directly interacted with SAv or the resin. Most likely, when cell lysates are prepared, intraparasite chaperones such as PfBiP associate with biotinylated proteins bound to SAv-agarose beads and are co-isolated. In the subsequent experiments, the protocol was revised to reduce the possibility of mistaking intraparasite chaperones as putative vacuolar resident proteins. Chaperones are released from their substrates in a process that requires the hydrolysis of ATP. Therefore, SAv-agarose beads were washed in the presence of 5 mm ATP before electrophoretic analysis. This step eliminated the co-isolation of PfBiP almost entirely, but it had no effect on the isolation of SERP (Fig. 5 C) or of other biotin-labeled proteins. As a prerequisite for the identification of novel vacuolar proteins, IRBCs were labeled metabolically withl-[35S]methionine, permeabilized with SLO, and treated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin. After cell lysis, soluble proteins were separated in triplicate on different two-dimensional gels using a pH gradient of 4–7 in the first dimension. To estimate the relative abundance of proteins in permeabilized erythrocytes, one gel was silver-stained (Fig. 6 A), and one gel was stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 6 B). As expected, silver staining revealed the most complex protein pattern. The most abundant proteins were also detectable using the less sensitive Coomassie Blue stain. To compare biotinylated proteinsversus total parasite proteins, proteins of a third gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was exposed to x-ray films to analyze the pattern of radiolabeled proteins (Fig.6 C). Subsequently, biotin-labeled proteins were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated SAv (Fig. 6 D). A comparison of the biotin-labeled proteins and the radiolabeled proteins clearly demonstrates that the pattern of biotin-labeled proteins is less complex and that it does not simply reflect the pattern of the most abundant radiolabeled proteins. In contrast, the most intensely radiolabeled proteins appear not to be biotin-labeled. Considering that cytosolic housekeeping proteins of the parasite, such as enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, are likely to be highly abundant, this result underscores the notion that the incorporation of the biotin is selective. In fact, when a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis was carried out using the two most prominent spots (I and II), they were identified unequivocally as P. falciparum enolase and as P. falciparum ornithine aminotransferase, respectively (data not shown). Biotin-labeled proteins form characteristic strings of individual spots. We attribute this pattern to various degrees of biotin incorporation into the same polypeptide chain. Because each sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin adds a negative charge, molecules with a high incorporation of the derivative are expected to migrate toward the acidic end of the gradient. The shift to the acidic end of the gradient also correlates with a slight increase in molecular size. A detailed comparison reveals 12 prominent spots,circled in Fig. 6, A−D, which represent highly abundant parasite proteins that are detectable by Coomassie Blue staining. Nine of these spots appear negatively stained in Fig.6 D because of the high local concentration of nonbiotinylated protein. Thirty-nine protein spots were identified that were both biotinylated and radiolabeled and that therefore fulfill the criteria expected for vacuolar proteins. Some of these spots may represent identical polypeptides that are biotinylated to various degrees. In conclusion, the accessibility of nonpermeant biotin derivatives to the vacuolar lumen in permeabilized IRBCs has allowed the identification of candidate vacuolar proteins. These proteins are restricted in number, and they segregate into a distinct two-dimensional pattern. The sequencing of the parasite's genome has almost been completed. This will allow the rapid identification of the genes encoding vacuolar proteins, as a prerequisite for a molecular understanding of the cell biological functions of this unusual compartment in the infected erythrocyte.

https://openalex.org/W2129775573,"To examine changes that occur during the transition from an initiation complex (IC) to an elongation complex (EC) in T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP), we used nucleic acid-protein cross-linking methods to probe interactions of the RNAP with RNA and DNA in a halted EC. As the RNA is displaced from the RNA-DNA hybrid approximately 9 bp upstream from the active site (at -9) it interacts with a region within the specificity loop (residues 744-750) and is directed toward a positively charged surface that surrounds residues Lys-302 and Lys-303. Surprisingly, the template and non-template strands of the DNA at the upstream edge of the hybrid (near the site where the RNA is displaced) interact with a region in the N-terminal domain of the RNAP (residues 172-191) that is far away from the specificity loop before isomerization (in the IC). To bring these two regions of the RNAP into proximity, major conformational changes must occur during the transition from an IC to an EC. The observed nucleic acid-protein interactions help to explain the behavior of a number of mutant RNAPs that are affected at various stages in the initiation process and in termination."

To approach this hypothesis, we have focused on the putative interaction of BCK with the N-terminal lipoic acid-bearing domain (LBD) of E2b, by analogy to the binding of the L2 domain of E2p to PDK (12Liu S. Baker J.C. Andrews P.C. Roche T.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 926-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, these studies have been hampered by the fact the lipoylated LBD (lip-LBD) alone (residues 1–84) cannot bind to BCK. Here we report that the previously overlooked C-terminal hinge region of LBD is essential for the interaction of lip-LBD with BCK. Constructs containing lip-LBD and various lengths of the C-terminal hinge region are able to bind to BCK to different degrees, as measured by a newly developed solubility-based assay and by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The absence of relevant C-terminal hinge sequences may explain the previously observed weak binding of some PDK isoforms to the L2 domain of the PDC (13Tuganova A. Boulatnikov I. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 129-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More significantly, the inclusion of the C-terminal hinge region will facilitate investigations into the mechanism by which mitochondrial protein kinases, i.e. BCK and PDK isoforms, are regulated through interactions with their respective E2 cores of α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes. The di-domain (DD), which spanned residues 1–167 of human E2b, contained (5′ → 3′) the LBD, the complete C-terminal hinge region, and the subunit-binding domain (SBD). To construct the C-terminally His6-tagged DD expression vector, a sense primer, 5′-CCATGGGACAGGTTGTTCAGTTCAAGC-3′, and an antisense primer, 5′-GCTCGAGTGGCATAATTTCAGCTTTTGGTG-3′, were employed to amplify the DD using a human E2b cDNA as template (14Chuang J.L. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The amplified DD was digested with NcoI and XhoI, and the excised fragment was cloned into the Pet-28a vector from Novagen (Madison, WI). Similar strategies were used to construct vectors for the expression of LBD (residues 1–84), LBD2 (residues 1–99), LBD3 (residues 1–95), and LBD4 (residues 1–89). C-terminally His6-tagged E2 domain constructs were transformed into BL-21 cells, and the expression at 30 °C was induced by 0.75 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-purified DD and LBD proteins were lipoylated in vitro with the bacterial enzyme LplA as described previously (15Chuang J.L. Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 192-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N-terminally His6-tagged BCK (40 μm, monomers) in 400 mm arginine was combined with lipoylated or unlipoylated DD or LBD constructs (70 μm). Each of the mixtures was dialyzed at 4 °C for 16 h against 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmMgCl2, and 5% glycerol. The dialyzed mixtures were clarified by centrifugation, and aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. MBP-BCK and lip-DD or lip-LBD constructs were dialyzed exhaustively with three changes against the same reservoir of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mmKCl, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol. To carry out ITC measurements, the reaction cell of a MicroCal (Northampton, MA) VP-ITC microcalorimeter containing 1.5 ml of 100 μmMBP-BCK was equilibrated at 20 °C. The stock of 500 μmlip-DD or lip-LBD constructs in 10-μl increments was injected into the cell, and heat changes due to binding were recorded. Binding isotherms derived from the raw data were used to calculate the standard free energy of binding (ΔG 0) according to the equation: ΔG 0 = −RTlnK a, where R is the gas constant, T is absolute temperature, andK a is the association constant. From binding isotherms, the number of binding sites (n) was obtained, and changes in enthalpy (ΔH 0) and entropy (ΔS 0) were calculated according to the equation: ΔG 0 = ΔH 0− TΔS 0. Curve-fitting and the derivation of thermodynamic parameters were facilitated using the MicroCal ORIGIN software package. The concentrations of MBP-BCK and E2 domain constructs were determined by A 280 nmusing calculated extinction coefficients (in mg ml−1cm−1) of 1.09 (for MBP-BCK), 1.07 (LBD2), 1.14 (LBD3), 1.16 (LBD2), and 0.74 (DD). The construction and expression of His6-tagged BCK and MBP-BCK by co-transformation with the pGroESL plasmid overproducing chaperonins GroEL and GroES were described previously (7Machius M. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Tomchick D.R. Chuang D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11218-11223Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Meng M. Huang Y.S. Aalund G. Chuang D.T. Lau K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19861-19867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A DD (residues 1–167) construct comprising the LBD, a hinge region, and the SBD was expressed and lipoylated in vitro and designated as lip-DD. The N-terminally His6-tagged BCK is soluble to the extent of 2–3 mg/ml only in the presence of 300 mm arginine (7Machius M. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Tomchick D.R. Chuang D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11218-11223Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the requirement of high arginine concentration for solubility was circumvented when N-terminally His6-tagged BCK was allowed to bind to lip-DD. Based on this finding, a solubility-based binding assay was developed. Lip-DD was combined with the N-terminally His6-tagged BCK in the presence of 400 mmarginine. The mixture was dialyzed to remove arginine because it interferes with the binding of lip-DD to BCK (data not shown). The solubility of His6-tagged BCK was indicated by its presence in the supernatant following dialysis and centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 1, in the presence of lip-DD, His6-tagged BCK remains in the supernatant after the removal of arginine (lane 2). The monomeric subunit stoichiometry of His6-tagged BCK to lip-DD is 1:2. The presence of excess lip-DD is necessary to prevent the precipitation of His6-tagged BCK during dialysis. In contrast, incubation of His6-tagged BCK with unlipoylated apo-DD does not render the former soluble in the absence of arginine (lane 3). These data confirm the finding that the covalently attached lipoic acid is essential for the binding of holo-E2p to PDK (16Radke G.A. Ono K. Ravindran S. Roche T.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 982-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, incubation with LBD (residues 1–84) alone, whether lipoylated (lane 4) or unlipoylated (lane 5), did not prevent the precipitation of His6-tagged BCK upon the removal of arginine. The results indicate that the sequence of LBD alone is not capable of binding to BCK. The ability of lip-DD, but not lip-LBD, to maintain the solubility of His6-tagged BCK in the absence of arginine raises the question of whether the C-terminal SBD or the hinge sequence between LBD and the SBD is needed for binding. Therefore, solubility-based binding studies with His6-tagged BCK were carried out further with lip-LBD constructs containing various lengths of the C-terminal hinge region (Fig.2 A). As shown in Fig.2 B, lip-LBD2 (residues 1–99) (lane 2) and lip-LBD3 (residues 1–95) (lane 4), both C-terminally His6-tagged, confer 100% solubility of His6-tagged BCK in the absence of arginine. His6-tagged BCK is absent from the supernatant with apo-LBD2 (lane 1) or apo-LBD3 (lane 3). The addition of lip-LBD4 (residues 1–89) (lane 6) results in lower levels of soluble His6-tagged BCK compared with lip-LBD2 and lip-LBD3. Identical amounts of His6-tagged BCK were used in the solubility-based binding assays with different constructs. Similarly, apo-LBD4 did not protect His6-tagged BCK from precipitation upon the removal of arginine (lane 5). No His6-tagged BCK was present in the supernatant in the presence of either apo-LBD (lane 7) or lip-LBD (lane 8), serving as negative controls. These results establish, for the first time, that the C-terminal hinge region of LBD is essential for the binding of lip-LBD to BCK. The hinge regions containing four negatively charged residues Glu86-Glu-Asp-Xaa-Xaa-Glu that are present in lip-LBD2 and lip-LBD3 are likely to confer efficient domain binding to BCK. We utilized ITC as a direct method to study the interaction of lip-LBD2 with BCK. Measurements of heat changes by ITC require relatively large quantities of proteins especially when the binding energy is weak. For binding studies by ITC, rat BCK was expressed in Escherichia coli as a MBP fusion. MBP-BCK, unlike His6-tagged BCK, is highly soluble (∼50 mg/ml) in the absence of arginine, and the presence of MBP has no effect on BCK activity and its interaction with lipoylated E2b (11Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Meng M. Huang Y.S. Aalund G. Chuang D.T. Lau K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19861-19867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fig.3 (upper panel) shows the heat of titration with apo-LBD2 and lip-LBD2. The unchanged ITC isotherm with apo-LBD2 unequivocally demonstrates the absence of interactions with MBP-BCK (Fig. 3, lower panel). By comparison, lip-LBD2 shows a gradual rise in the isotherm, which is consistent with a weak binding to MBP-BCK. Because of the weak interaction, the titration is only ∼80% saturated under the conditions used in these experiments. From the binding isotherm, a dissociation constantK D of 8.06 × 10−6m, a binding energy ΔG 0 of −6.84 kcal/mol, and a binding enthalpy ΔH 0 of −3.68 kcal/mol were calculated (Fig. 3, lower panel). The data represent direct evidence for the interaction between lip-LBD2 containing the C-terminal hinge region and MBP-BCK. The ITC method was further employed to characterize the interactions of MBP-BCK with LBD constructs containing various lengths of the C-terminal linker region. Table Ishows that the interactions of lip-LBD2 with MBP-BCK is the most exothermic among the four LBD constructs studied. The binding enthalpy ΔH 0 of −3.68 kcal/mol is comparable with that of −3.70 kcal/mol measured with lip-DD. Significantly lower enthalpies were obtained with lip-LBD3 and lip-LBD4. Smaller differences in dissociation constants K D were observed between lip-DD and lip-LBD2 through lip-LBD4. These thermodynamic parameters confirm the conclusions derived from the solubility-based binding assays that lip-LBD2 and lip-LBD3 interact with MBP-BCK to a degree similar to lip-DD.Table IComparison of thermodynamic parameters for the interactions of LBD constructs with MBP-BCKLBD construct1-aFor these constructs, see the legend to Fig. 2 for sequences in the C-terminal hinge region.K DΔG 0ΔH 0TΔS 0mkcal/molkcal/molkcal/mollip-LBD49.26 × 10−6−6.80−1.53+5.27lip-LBD38.40 × 10−6−6.82−2.29+4.53lip-LBD28.06 × 10−6−6.84−3.68+3.16lip-DD7.75 × 10−6−6.86−3.70+3.161-a For these constructs, see the legend to Fig. 2 for sequences in the C-terminal hinge region. Open table in a new tab A prominent feature of the mitochondrial kinases comprising BCK and PDK isoforms is the up-regulation through interaction with their respective E2 cores of α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes (11Davie J.R.

Powers-Greenwood S.L. Radke G.A. Gopalakrishnan S. Chang C.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 573: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The lipoyl-containing domains of the E2 cores function both as an anchor and a modulator for activities of the mitochondrial kinases. Studies with the lipoylated inner L2 domain have been complicated by the fact that the domain alone does not interact as efficiently as holo-E2p with the PDK isoforms, except for PDK3 (13Tuganova A. Boulatnikov I. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 129-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Baker J.C. Yan X. Peng T. Kasten S. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15773-15781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this communication, we show that lip-LBD alone does not bind to BCK; however, the inclusion of various lengths of the previously neglected C-terminal hinge region results in the interaction between the lip-LBD constructs and BCK. This information has facilitated the co-crystallization of BCK with lip-LBD constructs for the ongoing structural determination by x-ray diffraction (data not shown). The L2 domain of E2p used in binding studies contained either none (13Tuganova A. Boulatnikov I. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 129-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or a portion of the hinge region (12Liu S. Baker J.C. Andrews P.C. Roche T.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 926-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Mann W.R. Dragland C.J. Vinluan C.C. Vedananda T.R. Bell P.A. Aicher T.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The omission of certain important elements in the C-terminal hinge region of the L2 domain may explain the weaker interaction of these lipoylated constructs with PDK isoforms than with holo-E2. The essential determinants in the C-terminal hinge region of E2b LBD for the binding of lip-LBD to BCK are presently uncertain. However, the inclusion of negatively charged residues Glu-Glu-Asp-Xaa-Xaa-Glu in lip-LBD2 and lip-LBD3 constructs results in binding efficiency similar to lip-DD, based on dissociation constants and binding enthalpies measured by ITC. The lip-DD construct contains the entire hinge region connecting LBD and SBD and therefore mimics holo-E2 regarding binding to BCK. The results with the lip-LBD constructs strongly suggest that the negative charged residues in the C-terminal hinge region are candidate determinants for interactions with BCK. In the BCK structure (7Machius M. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Tomchick D.R. Chuang D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11218-11223Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), a groove formed between helices BH4 and BH3 of the B domain is lined with positively charged residues that are suited to interact with the negatively charged residues present in the C-terminal hinge region of LBD, as suggested for the PDK2 structure (9Steussy C.N. Popov K.M. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Sloan Jr., R.B. Harris R.A. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37443-37450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the covalently attached lipoic acid is also essential for the binding of lip-LBD constructs to BCK. Due to the aliphatic nature of the lipoic acid moiety and the presence of hydrophobic residues in the hinge region, there may be additional weak hydrophobic interactions between lip-LBD constructs and BCK. The C-terminal hinge region of LBD is located 26 Å away from the lipoylated Lys-44 in the recently determined human LBD solution structure (20Chang C.F. Chou H.T. Chuang J.L. Chuang D.T. Huang T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15865-15873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Both structural elements are on the same side of the β barrel and represent two of the three most mobile regions in LBD (the remaining one being the large L1 loop), as indicated by the picosecond time scale of the spectral density function J(H). These dynamic properties presumably facilitate the interactions of both the essential lipoic acid moiety and C-terminal hinge region with the B domain of BCK. BCK does not form a stable complex with lip-DD or lip-LBD constructs to allow isolation by the conventional column chromatography or ultracentrifugation methods. We have therefore developed the solubility-based binding assay, which facilitates screening for the binding of domain constructs to BCK in a simple and straightforward fashion. The N-terminally His6-tagged BCK is soluble only in the presence of high concentrations of arginine. The amphipathic character of arginine presumably protects exposed hydrophobic interacting surfaces of the folded protein (21Qu B.H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The crux of the binding assay is based on the discovery that a molar excess of lip-DD can increase the solubility of N-terminally His6-tagged BCK from 2–3 mg/ml in the presence of 300 mm arginine to 20 mg/ml when arginine is replaced by lip-DD. However, arginine and lipoylated E2 domains are mutually exclusive in binding to His6-tagged BCK as indicated by the phosphotransfer/kinase activity assays (data not shown). The slow gradual removal of arginine by dialysis from His6-tagged BCK in the presence of lip-DD enables the latter to bind to BCK thereby maintaining its solubility. The molar excess of lip-DD or lip-LBD constructs in the binding assay ensures the optimal binding to His6-tagged BCK upon the removal of arginine. The ITC method offers “real time” measurements of thermodynamic parameters for protein-ligand and protein-protein binding reactions under defined solution conditions. ITC is ideal for studies of weak interactions of BCK with lip-DD and lip-LBD constructs by taking advantage of the high solubility of MBP-BCK. The dissociation constants (K D) in the 10−6m range derived from ITC measurements for lip-DD and lip-LBD2, lip-LBD3, and lip-LBD4 are consistent with the weak interactions of BCK with these E2b domain constructs. These values are four orders of magnitude higher than those estimated for the tight binding of E1p or E3 to the DD of the PDC from Bacillus stearothermophilius (22Jung H.I. Bowden S.J. Cooper A. Perham R.N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1091-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the binding enthalpy obtained by ITC measurements appears to be a more accurate parameter than the dissociation constant in differentiating binding affinity among lip-LBD constructs (Table I). The similar strongly exothermic binding enthalpies between lip-LBD2 and lip-DD indicate that the lip-LBD2 construct contains all the necessary determinants present in E2b for its interaction with BCK. Finally, for the fitting of the binding isotherm, a model based on one lip-LBD2 binding site per MBP-BCK monomer was used (Fig. 3). The best fit values generated a stoichiometry of n = 0.5, indicating that due to the weak interactions only one of the two sites in the MBP-BCK homodimer is occupied by lip-LBD2 under non-saturating conditions. This binding stoichiometry is consistent with that deduced from packing analysis of the BCK/lip-LBD2 crystals (data not shown). We are indebted to Dr. Celestine Thomas for advice and assistance in ITC measurements and Dr. Mischa Machius for helpful discussions of x-ray crystallographic data on the BCK/lip-LBD2 crystals."

The process of copper uptake as observed for the double mutant may be relevant for a better understanding of the way copper chaperones accept and transfer metal ions in the living cell. In an attempt to construct dimers of the electron transfer protein azurin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the double mutant H117G/N42C was constructed. The properties of this azurin variant in its monomeric form turned out to be quite unexpected and are the subject of the present paper. Experiments on the dimers that have been constructed from it will be described elsewhere. Azurin from P. aeruginosa is a small blue copper protein that contains a type 1 copper site. Type 1 copper sites are characterized by an intense absorption band near 600 nm (ε = 3,000–6,000 m−1 cm−1) and by EPR spectra with unusually small A ∥ values (A ∥ < 70 × 10−4cm−1) (1Solomon E.I. Baldwin M.J. Lowery M.D. Chem. Rev. 1992; 92: 521-542Crossref Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The copper ion in azurin is coordinated by three strong ligands (Sγ of Cys112 and Nδ of His117 and His46) forming a trigonal plane around the copper and two weak axial ligands (Sδ of Met121 and backbone oxygen of Gly45) (2Adman E.T.

Biol. 1991; 221: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Much has been learned about coordination geometry in cupredoxins by removal and replacement of copper ligands. An example is the replacement of His117 by glycine in azurin. The H117G mutation creates a gap in the protein surface through which the copper-containing active center becomes accessible for external ligands (4den Blaauwen T. van de Kamp M. Canters G.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5050-5052Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 5den Blaauwen T. Hoitink C.W.G. Canters G.W. Han J. Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J.

Type 1 character is maintained when monodentate ligands such as imidazole and pyridine (derivatives), halides or azide are added. The site reverts to type 2 character when bidentate ligands such as histidine and histamine are added. The introduction of an additional cysteine at position 42 produces a double mutant with unusual spectroscopic and mechanistic properties. We demonstrate in this work that the protein framework of the doubly mutated protein can undergo a major rearrangement leading to a metal site in which Cys42 acts as one of the copper ligands. This site has a unique spectroscopic fingerprint. Moreover, when the copper site is reconstituted by incubating the apoprotein with Cu(II), the Cys42 functions as an arm that catches the metal ion and carries it over to the active site where it becomes coordinated by, among others, a second cysteine, Cys112. This process may be relevant for a better understanding of the in vivoprocess of copper uptake and transfer by copper chaperones.

The extinction coefficient of the absorption at 385 nm in H117G/N42C azurin has been estimated from the ratio of the absorptions at 385 nm of the Cu-H117G/N42C azurin and 280 nm of the H117G/N42C apoazurin. For the extinction coefficient at 280 nm the value of H117G apoazurin has been used (ε280 = 9.1 × 103m−1 cm−1) (9Jeuken L.J.C. van Vliet P. Verbeet M.Ph. Camba R. McEvoy J.P. Armstrong F.A. Canters G.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 12186-12194Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Samples were measured in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, unless stated otherwise. EPR spectra were recorded at 77 K with a JEOL JESRE2X spectrometer operating at X-band frequency (within a range of 8.997 and 9.000 GHz) and interfaced with a JEOL ES-PRIT330 data manipulation system. EPR spectra were recorded in continuous wave mode with instrument settings as follows: center field, 290 mT; sweep width, 75 mT; field modulation width, 1 mT; field modulation frequency, 100 kHz; time constant, 0.1 s; sweep rate, 12.5 mT/min; microwave power, 1 mW. The magnetic field was calibrated with an external sample of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (g = 2.0036). Protein samples were freshly prepared by adding 0.5 molar eq of a Cu(NO3)2 solution (10 μl 25 mm) to H117G/N42C apoazurin (200 μl 2.5 mm in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7, with 40% glycerol). After mixing by pipetting back and forth the solution was immediately frozen, and the EPR spectrum was measured. Subsequently, the sample was quickly defrosted to add another 0.5 molar eq of Cu(NO3)2 and measure the EPR spectrum following the same procedure. H117G/N42C apoazurin at a concentration of 0.3 mm in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 5 mm dithiothreitol (to prevent formation of dimers) was reconstituted with Cu(II) as follows. All buffers and solutions were flushed with argon for 30 min before use. Dithiothreitol was removed by repeated dilution and concentration under anaerobic conditions. Concentrating the sample was performed in a Centricon 10, which was loaded into a Nalgene 250-ml centrifuge bottle with an O-ring sealing cap in the glove box and then centrifuged for 1.5 h at 5,000 rpm. After addition of 1 molar equivalent of Cu(NO3)2 the samples were concentrated to a final concentration of 3 mm. The samples were then inverted, spun into an Eppendorf, and transferred aerobically to capillary tubes for the measurement of absorption and resonance Raman spectra. The resonance Raman spectra of H117G/N42C azurin were collected in a 90° geometry with the capillary mounted in a wiggler (to minimize photodamage) with a stream of ice-cooled N2gas. For recording the spectra a custom McPherson 2061/207 spectrograph (0.67 m, 2400 groove grating) and a Princeton Instruments (LN-1100PB) liquid N2 cooled CCD detector was used with a 150-μm slit width. Rayleigh scattering was attenuated with a Kaiser optical holographic supernotch filter. The excitation source was provided by a Coherent Innova 302 krypton laser for 413 nm (25 mW power). Absolute frequencies, accurate to at least ± 1 cm−1, were obtained by calibration with aspirin. The sample was stable toward laser irradiation, and Raman spectra on the same sample could be recorded for 1.5 h. Kinetic measurements were performed on an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped flow spectrometer equipped with either a PD.1 Photodiode Array detector or an absorption photomultiplier (for single wavelength). Reactions were carried out aerobically at 20 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7. Reactions were initiated by mixing equal volumes of the apoazurin (50–100 μm) and a Cu(II) solution. Copper solutions were made from a 0.5 m stock solution of Cu(NO3)2. Data were analyzed with PC Pro-K, Global Analysis and Simulation Software (Applied Photophysics). Modeling was started by taking the crystal structure of wild type azurin and replacing His117for a glycine and Asn42 for a cysteine using Swiss-Pdb Viewer version 3.51. 2N. Guex, M. C. Peitsch, T. Schwede, and A. Diemand (1996) Swiss-Pdb Viewer 3.51, www.expasy.ch/spdbv/mainpage.html. Using the GROMACS simulation package (11van der Spoel D. van Buuren A.R. Apol E. Meulenhoff P.J. Tieleman D.P.

Biomos, Groningen, The Netherlands1996Google Scholar) Cys42 was moved inward in nine steps by putting a restraint on the distance between copper, which was constrained to sulfur(Cys42) at 2.2 Å, and a dummy atom, which was placed at the average position between sulfur(Cys112) and nitrogen(His46). Alternately, the sulfur(Cys112) and nitrogen(His46) atoms were fixed, whereas the distance restraint between copper and the dummy atom was shortened; or the copper atom was fixed, and the protein was allowed to relax. Each step was run for 20 ps. After nine steps the copper-dummy distance had decreased from 12 to 1 Å. Subsequently, bonds were added between copper and the ligands (Cys42, His46, Cys112, and Met121), but they were not constrained (input distance parameters were 2.0 Å for copper-nitrogen and 2.2 Å for copper-sulfur bonds with force constants of 105 kJ/mol·nm4). An improper dihedral between the copper and His46 was added to ensure that the copper remained in the plane of the imidazole ring (ideal improper dihedral angle: 0° with force constant of 500 kJ/mol·rad2). During a 1.1-ns molecular dynamics run the structure appeared to be stable (root mean square deviation = 1.8 Å for all heavy atoms relative to structure at 100 ps). Water was not included in this simulation. When Cu(II) is added to a solution containing H117G apoazurin (single mutation), the mixture turns green (4den Blaauwen T. van de Kamp M. Canters G.W. J.

The absorption spectrum of Cu-H117G azurin, taken after about 30 min when the maximum intensity in absorption is reached, is shown in the inset of Fig.1 A (solid line). Two absorption maxima at 420 and 628 nm are observed because of a mixture of type 2 and type 1 species, respectively (5den Blaauwen T. Hoitink C.W.G. Canters G.W. Han J. Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J.

Because water is the most abundant ligand present, it has been assumed that water coordinates the copper at the vacant position of His117 (5den Blaauwen T. Hoitink C.W.G. Canters G.W. Han J.

The optical spectrum changes dramatically upon addition of external ligands: the addition of imidazole (and derivatives), pyridine (and derivatives), chloride or bromide to the oxidized form of the H117G mutant restores the characteristic type 1 features. For example, when imidazole is added a decrease in intensity at 420 nm and an increase near 630 nm is observed as shown in the inset of Fig. 1 A (dashed line). Molecules such as histidine and histamine create copper sites with spectroscopic features characteristic of type 2 copper sites, as in H117G(H2O) (4den Blaauwen T. van de Kamp M. Canters G.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5050-5052Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 5den Blaauwen T. Hoitink C.W.G. Canters G.W. Han J. Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J.

Cu(II), when added to the colorless monomeric form of the H117G/N42C apoazurin, reacts instantaneously with the protein as can be seen from the immediate development of a yellow color. This color is caused by a strong absorption band in the optical spectrum at 385 nm with an extinction coefficient of (3.0 ± 0.5) × 103m−1 cm−1 (Fig. 1 A) and is characteristic of a type 2 copper site. It can be assigned as a RS− − Cu(II) ς → π* band (15Han J. Loehr T.M., Lu, Y. Valentine J.S. Averill B.A. Sanders-Loehr J. J. Am. Chem.

These features are strikingly different from the spectroscopic characteristics of Cu-H117G azurin mentioned above (Fig. 1 A, inset,solid line). Remarkable is that the addition of an excess of external ligands such as imidazole (50 eq) or chloride (100 eq)after copper binding does not influence the spectroscopic features (dashed lines in Fig. 1, B andC, respectively). Preincubation with a large excess of imidazole before Cu(II) is added slightly affects the spectroscopic properties. An increase in absorption at 630 nm is observed as well as a slight decrease in 385 nm absorption. The gain in 630 nm absorption agrees stoichiometrically with the loss of 385 nm absorption as calculated from the extinction coefficients of 385 nm ((3.0 ± 0.5) × 103m−1cm−1) and 628 nm ((5.3 ± 0.1) × 103m−1 cm−1, imidazole-bound H117G azurin (9Jeuken L.J.C. van Vliet P. Verbeet M.Ph. Camba R. McEvoy J.P. Armstrong F.A. Canters G.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 12186-12194Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1 B, dotted line). Preincubation with chloride has hardly any effect on the spectroscopic features (Fig. 1 C, dotted line). These observations are in contrast to H117G azurin, which changes its spectroscopic properties dramatically upon adding exogenous ligands as depicted in Fig. 1 A (inset, dashed line). From this, it can be concluded that in the case of H117G/N42C azurin externally added ligands do not significantly compete for copper binding. The open site in the coordination sphere of the copper, therefore, must be occupied by another ligand, the obvious candidate being Cys42. The involvement of cysteine 42 in copper binding was confirmed by inhibition studies with IAA, a blocking reagent that reacts specifically with surface-exposed cysteine residues. The addition of copper after preincubation of the apo monomer of H117G/N42C azurin with IAA restores the characteristic properties of the H117G mutant as shown in Fig. 1 D. Depending on (a) the amount of IAA used, (b) the protein concentration, (c) the incubation time, and (d) the temperature, the absorption at 385 nm decreases to a smaller or larger extent, whereas the absorptions at 420 and 630 nm, typical for Cu-H117G azurin, increase (Fig.1 D, dotted line). Under the conditions as used in Fig. 1 D about 70% of the Cys42 in the H117G/N42C apoazurin has reacted with IAA after 30 min, making binding of this cysteine to the copper impossible. The dotted linein Fig. 1 D (after IAA) has decreased relative to thedashed line (no IAA); the apparent slight shift of the absorption maximum to longer wavelength is caused by overlap of the remaining 385 nm absorption with the newly appearing 420 nm absorption. Thus, the original green copper site as observed for the H117G azurin mutant is partially recovered. A free position has become available in the coordination sphere of the metal site, which can be filled by externally added ligands: upon adding imidazole a decrease in 420 nm absorption and an increase in 630 nm absorption are observed (solid lines, Fig. 1 D). Under the conditions used in Fig. 1 D, a remaining absorption at 385 nm is observed caused by the presence of H117G/N42C azurin that has not reacted with IAA (about 30%). Previous studies have demonstrated that the addition of Cu(II) (1.1 molar eq) to the apo form of the N42C single mutant catalyzes the formation of dimers (7van Amsterdam I.M.C. Ubbink M. Jeuken L.J.C. Verbeet M.Ph. Einsle O. Messerschmidt A. Canters G.W. Chem. Eur. J. 2001; 7: 2398-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The copper occupies the metal site but is partially reduced as it participates in the oxidation of the cysteines 42 when they form a disulfide bond. It is thus expected that copper addition to the H117G/N42C double mutant will result in the accelerated formation of dimers. To analyze this feature an experiment was performed, in which 1.1 molar eq of Cu(II) was added to apo monomer of H117G/N42C azurin. The resulting yellow protein solution was subjected to size exclusion column chromatography. From this, two fractions were eluted with masses of 13,853 ± 2 and 27,698 ± 4 Da, respectively, as determined by mass spectrometry. This agrees with the expected mass of the apo forms of mono- and dimer, calculated as 13,852 and 27,702 Da, respectively. 3Under the acidic conditions used for electrospray mass spectrometry, the copper falls out (see also Ref.58Jeuken, L. J. C., The Role of the Surface-exposed and Copper-coordinating Histidine in Blue Copper Proteins.Ph.D. thesis, 2001, 129, 140, University of Leiden, Leiden, The Netherlands.Google Scholar). The experiment shows that during a gel filtration experiment at least 20% of the total amount of protein is converted into a dimer, independent of the protein concentration. We found that at high protein concentrations and longer incubation times, up to 80% of the total amount of monomer could be dimerized at ambient temperatures. The eluted monomer fraction still shows absorption at 385 nm, demonstrating that the yellow compound is a monomeric form of the protein, and excluding the occurrence of a possible dimer, in which a cysteine of one monomer ligates to the copper of the other monomer. The eluted dimer fraction was colorless, compatible with the copper being in the reduced state. The copper could not be reoxidized with potassium ferricyanide to the Cu(II) form as could have been expected for a H117G azurin variant (6den Blaauwen T. Canters G.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 1121-1129Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Jeuken L.J.C. van Vliet P. Verbeet M.Ph. Camba R. McEvoy J.P. Armstrong F.A. Canters G.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 12186-12194Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The possibility for the dimer being in its apo form is not likely because reconstitution with copper could not be achieved. The possibility of partial oxidation of the cysteine sulfur preventing binding of copper, however, cannot be ruled out. The possibility of zinc, instead of copper, occupying the metal site is ruled out because Zn-H117G/N42C azurin was removed prior to the gel filtration experiment by anion exchange chromatography. The formation of disulfide dimers of H117G/N42C azurin also occurs by exposure to air, in the absence of copper. This apo dimer can be reconstituted with copper by the addition of a stoichiometric amount of Cu(II) per copper site. Addition of Cu(II) to the apo dimer produces a green color with an absorption spectrum that is identical to that of the H117G single mutant (Fig.2 A, solid lines), although the intensities of absorbances of the double mutant are slightly lower (the absorbances at 420 and 630 nm amount to 76 and 57% of the H117G absorbances, respectively). Thus, upon the formation of the disulfide bond, the cysteines 42 are no longer available for copper binding, and the original spectroscopic features of the H117G mutant are restored. Just as with H117G azurin the vacant position can be filled by external ligands such as imidazole and chloride resulting in the appearance of a blue type 1 copper site (Fig. 2 B). In addition, a weak absorption band around 320 nm is observed, which is also present in the apoprotein (Fig. 2 A, dashed line). This feature might be related to the decreased intensity at 420 and 630 nm (see “Discussion”). The resonance Raman spectrum of the yellow monomeric form of H117G/N42C shows fundamentals at 300, 323, 341, and 359 cm−1 which originate from modes involving the Cu-S(Cys) stretching vibration (Fig.3 A), similar to the spectra of copper cysteinates (Table I) with tetragonal type 2 copper sites, like the His → Gly mutants of azurin (5den Blaauwen T.

The cellular abundance of prenylated proteins, as well as the stability of the thioether bond, poses a metabolic challenge to cells. A lysosomal enzyme termed prenylcysteine lyase has been identified that degrades a variety of prenylcysteines. Prenylcysteine lyase is a FAD-dependent thioether oxidase that produces free cysteine, an isoprenoid aldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide as products of the reaction. Here we report initial studies of the kinetic mechanism and stereospecificity of this unusual enzyme. We utilized product and dead end inhibitors of prenylcysteine lyase to probe the kinetic mechanism of the multistep reaction. The results with these inhibitors, together with those of other experiments, suggest that the reaction catalyzed by prenylcysteine lyase proceeds through a sequential mechanism. The reaction catalyzed by the enzyme is stereospecific, in that the pro-S hydride of the farnesylcysteine is transferred to FAD to initiate the reaction. With (2R,1′S)-[1′-2H1]farnesylcysteine as a substrate, a primary deuterium isotope effect of 2 was observed on the steady state rate. However, the absence of an isotope effect on an observed pre-steady-state burst of hydrogen peroxide formation implicates a partially rate-determining proton transfer after a relatively fast C–H (C–D) bond cleavage step. Furthermore, no pre-steady-state burst of cysteine was observed. The finding that the rate of cysteine formation was within 2-fold of the steady-statek cat value indicates that cysteine production is one of the primary rate-limiting steps in the reaction. These results provide substantial new information on the catalytic mechanism of prenylcysteine lyase.

With (2R,1′S)-[1′-2H1]farnesylcysteine as a substrate, a primary deuterium isotope effect of 2 was observed on the steady state rate. However, the absence of an isotope effect on an observed pre-steady-state burst of hydrogen peroxide formation implicates a partially rate-determining proton transfer after a relatively fast C–H (C–D) bond cleavage step. Furthermore, no pre-steady-state burst of cysteine was observed. The finding that the rate of cysteine formation was within 2-fold of the steady-statek cat value indicates that cysteine production is one of the primary rate-limiting steps in the reaction. These results provide substantial new information on the catalytic mechanism of prenylcysteine lyase. Protein prenylation is a type of posttranslational lipid modification involving the covalent attachment of either a 15-carbon farnesyl or a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl isoprenoid via thioether linkages to a conserved cysteine of many cellular proteins (1Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Google Scholar, 2Glomset J.A. Gelb M.H. Farnsworth C.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 139-142Google Scholar). The majority of prenylated proteins participate in biological regulatory events occurring at the cytoplasmic surface of cell membranes. Most prenylated proteins contain the so-called CaaX motif, in which the “C” is the modified cysteine, the “a” residues are usually aliphatic amino acids, and the X residue can be one of several amino acids. Following prenylation, most CaaX-type proteins are subject to two additional processing steps: the three C-terminal residues are proteolytically removed, and the new C-terminal prenylcysteine is subject to carboxyl methylation (3Ma Y-T. Chaudhuri A. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11772-11777Google Scholar, 4Jang G.F. Yokoyama K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9500-9507Google Scholar, 5Perez-Sala D. Gilbert B.A. Tan E.W. Rando R.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 835-840Google Scholar). Unlike many other posttranslational modifications of proteins, prenylation is a stable modification of proteins (6Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8232-8327Google Scholar, 7Epstein W.W. Lever D. Leining L.M. Bruenger E. Rilling H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9668-9670Google Scholar). Prenylated proteins comprise up to 2% of total cellular protein and have an approximate half-life of 20 h (6Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8232-8327Google Scholar, 7Epstein W.W. Lever D. Leining L.M. Bruenger E. Rilling H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9668-9670Google Scholar); however, accumulation of prenylcysteines arising from degradation of prenyl proteins is expected to place a major burden on cells. Since free prenylcysteines and analogs have a number of pharmacological effects on cells (8Xu Y. Gilbert B.A. Rando R.R. Chen L. Tashjian A.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1495-1501Google Scholar, 9Perez-Sala D. Gilbert B.A. Rando R.R. Canada F.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 319-324Google Scholar, 10Parish C.A. Brazil D.P. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2686-2693Google Scholar, 11Haklai R. Weisz M.G. Elad G. Paz A. Marciano D. Egozi Y. Ben-Baruch G. Kloog Y Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1306-1314Google Scholar), the mechanisms for cellular disposal of the prenylcysteines produced during the normal turnover of prenylated proteins are important to establish. Studies aimed at elucidating the metabolism of prenylated proteins resulted in the identification of a lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of prenylcysteines and their methyl esters (12Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Google Scholar, 13Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35802-35808Google Scholar). This enzyme has been termed prenylcysteine lyase (Pcly). 1The abbreviations used are: Pcly, prenylcysteine lyase; FC, farnesylcysteine; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GC, gas chromatography. The basic features of the chemical mechanism through which Pcly catalyzes its reaction have been elucidated (14Tschantz W.R. Digits J.A. Pyun H. Coates R.M. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2321-2324Google Scholar). The main features are as follows: (i) the products of the reaction are free cysteine and the C-1 aldehyde of the isoprenoid moiety (farnesal or geranylgeranial); (ii) the enzyme utilizes molecular oxygen as a co-substrate; (iii) Pcly uses a noncovalently bound FAD cofactor in an NAD(P)H-independent manner; and (iv) a stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide is produced during the course of the reaction. The last point presumably indicates that no oxygen atom from the molecular oxygen is incorporated into the farnesal product. A chemical mechanism for Pcly that can account for the above observations has been proposed (14Tschantz W.R. Digits J.A. Pyun H. Coates R.M. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2321-2324Google Scholar). In the proposed mechanism (Fig.1), the reaction is initiated by a hydride transfer from C-1 of the isoprenoid moiety of FC to FAD, producing reduced flavin and a probably short-lived sulfur-stabilized carbocation intermediate. Nucleophilic attack of a water molecule on the carbocation results in the formation of a hemithioacetal intermediate, which collapses to the isoprenoid aldehyde with simultaneous C–S bond breakage to produce cysteine. In addition, the hydride of the reduced flavin is transferred to molecular oxygen, resulting in hydrogen peroxide formation and reoxidation of the flavin, thus allowing the enzyme to participate in subsequent turnovers. The mechanism proposed for Pcly (i.e. oxidative cleavage of a thioether bond without net oxidation at sulfur) appears to be unprecedented in biology. The finding that cysteine is produced distinguishes it from another enzyme that might act on prenylcysteines, namely carbon-sulfur-β-lyase, which would produce a prenylthiol (15Dekant W. Vamvakas S. Anders M.W. Drug Metab. Rev. 1989; 20: 43-83Google Scholar). Furthermore, the lack of a NAD(P)H requirement suggests that Pcly uses a mechanism distinct from cytochrome P450 and flavin-containing monooxygenases that catalyze S-oxidation of FC and other thioethers (16Cashman J.R. Olsen L.D. Bornheim L.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1990; 3: 344-349Google Scholar, 17Sausen P.J. Elfarra A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6139-6145Google Scholar, 18Park S.B. Howald W.N. Cashman J.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 191-198Google Scholar). In addition, Pcly has essentially no sequence similarity to known enzymes, which also attests to its unusual mechanism of action (13Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35802-35808Google Scholar). Another interesting facet of Pcly is its possible similarity in biological function to another lysosomal enzyme called palmitoyl-protein thioesterase that catalyzes the degradation of thioesters derived from S-acylated proteins (19Lu J. Verkruyse L.A. Hofmann S.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 93: 10046-10050Google Scholar). This enzyme has been implicated in a lethal neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder, infantile neuroceroid lipofuscinosis (20Vesa J. Hellsten E. Verkruyse L.A. Camp L.A. Rapola J. Santavuori P. Hofmann S.L. Peltonen L.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 584-587Google Scholar). These observations stress the importance of understanding both the biology and the mechanism of Pcly and indicate an important biological role for enzymes involved in the metabolism of lipidated proteins. In the present work, we report studies on the mechanism of this unusual enzyme, including steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics as well as an analysis of the stereochemistry of hydride transfer. From these studies, we propose a kinetic model for Pcly. Farnesylcysteine (FC) and [35S]FC were synthesized as previously described (13Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35802-35808Google Scholar, 21Zhang L. Sachs C.W. Fine R.L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15973-15976Google Scholar). Farnesal was also synthesized as previously described (14Tschantz W.R. Digits J.A. Pyun H. Coates R.M. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2321-2324Google Scholar). (E,E)-Farnesol (trans,trans) was purchased from Sigma. The deuterium-labeled FCs, (2R,1′S)-[1′-2H1]FC and (2R,1′R)-[1′-2H1]FC, were synthesized from (E,E)-farnesol by known methods with some modifications (14Tschantz W.R. Digits J.A. Pyun H. Coates R.M. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2321-2324Google Scholar, 22Ravn M.M. Coates R.M. Flory J.E. Peters R.J. Croteau R. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 573-576Google Scholar, 23Ravn M.M. Jin Q. Coates R.M. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2000; : 1401-1410Google Scholar). Details of the synthetic procedures are provided in the supplemental information. The purity (≥95% unless indicated otherwise) of the stable intermediates was established by GC and/or 1The abbreviations used are: Pcly, prenylcysteine lyase; FC, farnesylcysteine; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GC, gas chromatography.H NMR spectroscopic analyses, and their identities were validated by correspondence of the NMR spectral data with values given in the literature references. All deuterated compounds were purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel (24Still C.W. Kahn M. Mitra A. J. Org. Chem. 1978; 43: 2923Google Scholar) except the FCs, which were purified by recrystallization. Recombinant baculovirus containing a hexahistidine-tagged Pcly was produced as previously described (14Tschantz W.R. Digits J.A. Pyun H. Coates R.M. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2321-2324Google Scholar). Several spinner cultures of Sf9 cells (18-liter total volume) in HyClone HyQ CCM-3 serum-free media were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml and then infected at a multiplicity of infection of about 1 with the human His6-Pcly virus. Cells were harvested 49 h after infection. Recombinant His6-Pcly was purified from extracts of infected Sf9 cells by a combination of nickel affinity and anion exchange chromatography as described (14Tschantz W.R. Digits J.A. Pyun H. Coates R.M. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2321-2324Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The cell pellet from an 18-liter culture of infected Sf9 cells was resuspended in 250 ml of 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.7, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors. Cells were disrupted using a glass-Teflon homogenizer, and the suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Pcly was extracted from the resulting pellet with 250 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.7, containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 and the protease inhibitor mixture, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The supernatant was loaded onto a 7-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). The column was then washed with 10 column volumes of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.7, 150 mm NaCl, 8 mm imidazole, and 0.2% CHAPS. Pcly was eluted with a 44-ml linear gradient of imidazole (8–500 mm) in the above buffer. Fractions containing Pcly activity were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.7, containing 0.2% CHAPS (buffer A). The dialysate was loaded onto a QHP 16/10 column (Amersham Biosciences), which had been equilibrated in buffer A. Pcly was eluted with a 120-ml gradient of NaCl from 0 to 500 mm in buffer A. Fractions containing Pcly were pooled, dialyzed as above, and stored at −80 °C. To determine the stereochemistry of the Pcly reaction, three separate incubations were set up in which Pcly used either unlabeled FC, (2R,1′S)-[1′-2H1]FC, or (2R,1′R)-[1′-2H1]FC as a substrate. Reaction mixtures were prepared in glass vials that were prewashed in hexane and contained the appropriate farnesylcysteine (500 μm), 12.5 μm (for the reactions with unlabeled FC and the R-isomer) or 20 μm (for the reaction with the S-isomer) Pcly, 6 mmZwittergent 3–14, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.7, and 15% glycerol. The mixtures were incubated for 1.5 h (for the reactions with unlabeled FC and the R-isomer) or 2.5 h (for the reaction with the S-isomer) at 37 °C, whereupon NaBH4 (70 mm final concentration from a stock in 14 n NaOH) was added, and the incubation continued for 30 min at room temperature. Formaldehyde (70 mm) was added to quench the NaBH4, followed by the addition of 0.4m HCl after 30 min. The labeled farnesols from the Pcly incubation solutions were extracted with heptane (10–15 μl). GC analysis of aliquots in splitless mode on a Restek Rtx-5 fused silica capillary column (5% diphenyl, 95% dimethyl polysiloxane stationary phase) showed peaks for (Z,E)- and (E,E)-farnesols (1:2 ratio; R t 13.4 and 13.7 min). Low resolution field ionization GC-mass spectrometry analyses with the same column and conditions using a VG 70-VSE instrument provided the following intensity data for the molecular ion regions and isotope contents: farnesol reference: m/z (relative intensity) (Z,E): 220 (2.55), 221 (−), 222 (100), 223 (19.75), 224 (3.35), 225 (1.51). (E,E): 220 (4.52), 221 (0.89), 222 (100, M+), 223 (16.80), 224 (1.91), 225 (−). (Z,E)-Farnesol from (2R,1′R)-[1′-2H1]FC:m/z 219 (1.55), 220 (−), 221 (−), 222 (1.12), 223 (100), 224 (16.62), 225 (9.13); 0.2% d 0, 99.8% d 1. (E,E)-Farnesol from (2R,1′R)-[1′-2H1]FC:m/z 220 (−), 221 (2.05), 222 (3.08), 223 (100.00), 224 (18.89), 225 (1.91); 2.1% d 0, 97.9% d 1. (Z,E)-Farnesol from (2R,1′S)-[1′-2H1]FC:m/z 219 (5.91), 220 (5.31), 221 (11.74), 222 (100), 223 (43.99), 224 (12.89), 225 (−); 78.6% d 0, 21.4% d 1. (E,E)-Farnesol from (2R,1′S)-[1′-2H1]FC: m/z220 (4.52), 221 (0.89), 222 (100.00, M+), 223 (16.80), 224 (1.91), 225 (−); 98.8% d 0, 1.2%d 1. The deuterium contents were calculated using an in-house program based on a standard method (25Lambert J.B. Shurvell H.F. Lightner D.A. Cooks R.G. Introduction to Organic Spectroscopy. MacMillan, New York1987: 351-353Google Scholar). The small quantities of the farnesol samples analyzed introduced scatter into lowm/z data, which results in errors in the isotope content of about ±1–2%. The anomalously highd 1 content in the (Z, E)-farnesol from the R,S-labeled substrate is attributed to a smaller quantity and background interference. Pcly activity was routinely measured by two methods. Unless otherwise noted, assays were performed in air-saturated buffers at 25 °C in which the oxygen concentration was 242 μm (26Umbreit W.W. Burris R.H. Stauffer J.F. Manometric Techniques. Burgess Publishing Co., Minneapolis, MN1964: 5-6Google Scholar). The most frequently used assay involved measuring hydrogen peroxide produced in the Pcly reaction using the H2O2 Amplex Red kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), as described previously (14Tschantz W.R. Digits J.A. Pyun H. Coates R.M. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2321-2324Google Scholar). Briefly, Pcly was incubated in assay buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 unit/ml horseradish peroxidase, and 200 μm Amplex Red reagent at 25 °C (100-μl final volume). The reactions were initiated with FC. In the presence of horseradish peroxidase, the Amplex Red reagent reacts with H2O2 to produce the highly fluorescent product resorufin. Fluorescence was measured on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorimeter using an excitation wavelength of 563 nm and an emission wavelength of 587 nm. Typically, the increase in fluorescence with time was measured for 5 min. A background fluorescence rate, determined for a control reaction lacking FC, was subtracted from experimental values. The actual reaction rates were calculated either from a resorufin or hydrogen peroxide standard curve. The second assay involved following the conversion of [35S]FC (0.3 Ci/mmol) to [35S]cysteine by TLC. Pcly was added to reactions containing [35S]FC and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.7, at 25 °C. At various time points (see legend to Fig. 6), a 20-μl aliquot of the reaction was removed and quenched with 10 μl of isopropyl alcohol/ammonium hydroxide/H2O (60:30:10), and 17.5 μl of this mixture was spotted onto a silica TLC plate (PE SILG; Whatman, Clifton, NJ). The plates were developed for 2 h in the quenching buffer mentioned above. After drying, the 35S-labeled compounds were located by autoradiography and excised from the plates, and radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation counting. To determine the steady state kinetic parametersk cat and K m, the concentration of FC was varied, and the assays were performed in air-saturated buffer as described above. Initial velocity data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1) using Kaleidagraph software (Abelbeck Software), υ=Vm[FC]/(Km+[FC])Equation 1 where υ is the initial velocity, V m is the maximum velocity, and K m is the Michaelis constant of FC. Primary deuterium isotope effects were measured using the substrates (2R,1′S)-[1′-2H1]FC and (2R,1′R)-[1′-2H1]FC and determined by comparing the values of V m andV/K m for FC in the fit of the data to Equation 1. When the oxygen concentration was to be varied, the hydrogen peroxide coupled assay was performed. The oxygen was removed from the initial enzyme reaction mixture by preparing all of the reagents in a 830-ABC series anaerobic chamber (PLAS Labs, Inc., Lansing, MI), in which the main chamber had been alternatively filled and evacuated with ultrapure nitrogen. All of the reagents except FC were added to an anaerobic quartz semimicroseptum cell. The cells were then taken out of the chamber, and different O2/N2 gas mixtures were bubbled through the solutions for 20–30 min at 25 °C to obtain final oxygen concentrations of 57, 346, 577, and 1.16 mm. Reactions were initiated by adding a saturating concentration of FC to the cuvette through a gas-tight syringe and reading the fluorescence increase with time as described above. Inhibition analysis was performed by varying inhibitor and FC concentrations at a fixed concentration of oxygen (air saturation, 242 μm). Data were analyzed by Lineweaver-Burk plots, and initial rate data were fit to Equation 2, which describes noncompetitive inhibition, using KinetAsyst software II (Intellikinetics). The best fits were determined by the relative fit errors. Subsequently, the lines (Fig. 4) are the fit of the data to Equation 2. υ=VmA/(Ka(1+1/Kis)+A(1+I/Kii))Equation 2 The nomenclature is that of Cleland (27Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 104-137Google Scholar). υ is the initial velocity; V m is the maximum velocity; Ais the substrate concentration; I is the inhibitor concentration; K a is the apparent Michaelis constant for A, and K is and K iiare the slope and intercept inhibition constants, respectively. Pre-steady-state experiments were performed on an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer using a 0.2-cm path length cell at 25 °C. The production of hydrogen peroxide was monitored by fluorescence (excitation wavelength 563 nm, 590 nm cut-off emission filter) using the coupled assay described above. Enzyme and substrates were diluted 2-fold in assay buffer. Concentrations indicated throughout or in the figure legends are the final concentrations after dilution. The time course of fluorescence can be described by a single exponential equation with a steady-state term (Equation 3), Ft=(ΔF)e−k(obs)t+vtEquation 3 where F t is the fluorescence at timet, ΔF is the amplitude of the burst,k obs is the observed first-order rate constant governing the burst phase, and υ is the linear rate of increase in fluorescence during steady state. The maximum value ofk obs, denoted k burst, was calculated according to Equation 4, kobs=kburst*[FC]/(Kapp+[FC])Equation 4 where K app is the concentration of varied substrate at one-half of the maximum value ofk burst. Farnesols stereoselectively labeled with deuterium in the pro-R and pro-S positions at C-1 were prepared by asymmetric reductions of farnesal-d 1 with (S)- and (R)-Alpine-Boranes® (Fig.2) (28Edelstein R.L.

The enantiomeric purities of the resulting (R)- and (S)-[1′-2H1]farnesols were 97 and 95% based on 1The abbreviations used are: Pcly, prenylcysteine lyase; FC, farnesylcysteine; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GC, gas chromatography.H NMR analyses of the corresponding camphanate esters (23Ravn M.M. Jin Q. Coates R.M. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2000; : 1401-1410Google Scholar, 30Gerlach H. Zagalak B. Chem. Commun. 1973; 48: 274-275Google Scholar). Chromatographic purification of the labeled farnesols proved difficult due to persistent contamination by an impurity presumed to be pinanol arising from oxidation of the pinylborane reagent. An effective purification of theS-enantiomer was ultimately accomplished by selective acetylation of farnesol, chromatography, and acetate cleavage. The labeled FC diastereomers were obtained by conversion to the farnesyl chlorides with N-chlorosuccinimide-dimethyl sulfide reagent (31Corey E.J. Kim C.U. Takeda M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1972; : 4339Google Scholar) followed by S-alkylation of cysteine (32Brown M.J. Milano P.D. Lever D.C. Epstein W.W. Poulter C.D. J. Am. Chem Soc. 1991; 113: 3176-3177Google Scholar). Since both reactions are expected to proceed by S N2 displacements with inversion of configuration (28Edelstein R.L. Weller V.A. Distefano M.D. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 5298-5299Google Scholar, 33Davisson V.J. Woodside A.B. Neal T.R. Stremler K.E. Muehlerbacher M. Poulter C.D. J. Org. Chem. 1986; 51: 4768-4779Google Scholar), the overall stereochemical outcome is retention affording (2R,1′R)- and (2R,1′S)-[1′-2H1]FCs. The diastereo purities of 91 and 95%, respectively, determined from their 1The abbreviations used are: Pcly, prenylcysteine lyase; FC, farnesylcysteine; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GC, gas chromatography.H NMR spectra in ethanol-d 6, reveal that some racemization occurred, probably in forming and/or handling the labile chloride intermediate. In the mechanism proposed previously for Pcly (14Tschantz W.R. Digits J.A. Pyun H. Coates R.M. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2321-2324Google Scholar) (See Fig. 1), a hydride from the C-1 of the isoprenoid moiety of FC is transferred to FAD, forming a sulfur-stabilized carbocation intermediate and reduced flavin. It is expected that either the pro-S or pro-R hydride will be transferred to FAD, whereas the other will be retained in the product. Pcly was incubated with unlabeled FC or with each of the deuterated isomers (see “Experimental Procedures”). After incubation, the reactions were treated with NaBH4 to reduce the farnesal product to the corresponding alcohol, farnesol. The deuterium content in the trans, trans-farnesol was determined by GC-mass spectrometry analysis. The results, summarized in Table I, reveal that Pcly action on (2R,1′S)-[1′-2H1]FC yields an isoprenoid product with essentially no deuterium retention. On the other hand, the isoprenoid product of Pcly action on (2R,1′R)-[1′-2H1]FC retains essentially all of the deuterium. These results indicate that the Pcly reaction is stereospecific and that the pro-Shydrogen of the FC substrate is transferred during the reaction.Table IDeuterium content of (E,E)-farnesols isolated from PCLase incubations with labeled FCs followed by NaBH4 reductionSubstrated 0d 1%%(2R, 1′S)FC−d 1aThe d 1 isotope descriptor denotes the presence of one deuterium atom in the predominant labeled form of the FC substrate (i.e. in the 1′-S or 1′R position).98.81.2(2R, 1′R)FC-d 1aThe d 1 isotope descriptor denotes the presence of one deuterium atom in the predominant labeled form of the FC substrate (i.e. in the 1′-S or 1′R position).2.197.9The deuterium content in the resulting farnesol was determined by GC-mass spectrometry analysis.

Initial steady-state kinetic analysis of Pcly revealed typical Michaelis- Menten behavior using FC as a substrate (Fig.3). The kinetic parameters are summarized in Table II. Pcly is a very slow enzyme, with a k cat of 0.008 s−1. Whereas this turnover number is low compared with many other oxidases (34Marcinkeviciene J. Jiang W. Locke G. Kopcho L.M. Rogers M.J.

The K m value determined for FC using the recombinant enzyme (3 μm) is similar to that obtained for Pcly purified from native tissue (12Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters were also determined for Pcly action on the two deuterated isomers (Fig. 3; TableII). No V m isotope effect was observed with (2R,1′R)-[1′-2H1]FC as the substrate. However, we did observe a primary kinetic isotope effect of 2.0 ± 0.1 on V m when (2R,1′S)-[1′-2H1]FC was the substrate (Table II). The observation of a primary kinetic deuterium isotope effect with the 1′S-isomer of FC not only confirmed the stereochemistry result discussed above but also suggested that hydride transfer is partially rate-limiting in steady-state catalysis.Table IISteady-state kinetic parameters for PCLase and isotope effectsSubstratek cat × 10−3K mk cat/K m× 10−3D k catD k cat/K ms−1μmμm−1s−1FC8 ± 0.53.0 ± 0.72.7 ± 0.6NANA(2R,1′R)−[1′ −2H1]FC7 ± 0.52.6 ± 0.72.7 ± 0.71.1 ± 0.081.0 ± 0.26(2R,1′S)−[1′ −2H1]FC4 ± 0.22.3 ± 0.61.7 ± 0.42.0 ± 0.131.6 ± 0.42Reactions were"

In HJC12 cells the tetracycline-regulated expression of pRb2/p130 increased the percentage of gamma-radiation-induced apoptotic cells from 27 to 47%. pRb2/p130 overexpression was associated with the downregulation of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 and the upregulation of the steady-state protein levels of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor p73. In particular, RT-PCR showed a significant increase in the expression of the p73delta isoform when pRb2/p130 was overexpressed. The ability of pRb2/p130 to modulate apoptosis was not associated with its role in mediating G0/G1 arrest during cell cycle progression. Our data suggest a role for pRb2/p130 in glioblastoma gamma-radiation-induced cell death, indicating that the antitumoral action of pRb2/p130 can regulate both inhibition of cell cycle progression and induction of cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2015687232,"23 amino acid substitutions were made in the C7 and C3 regions of pspFΔHTH, a protein required to convert ς54 closed promoter complexes to open complexes. These mutants were assayed for transcriptional competence, for the ability to hydrolyze ATP, for their multimerization state, and for their ability to interact with ς54 and its holoenzyme. C7 region mutants caused the protein to assume a compact form. This property could be mimicked by the addition of ATP, implying that compaction via C7 and ATP is part of the activation process. A number of C3 mutants were important for energy coupling, as indicated previously for several members of this activator family (1North A.K. Weiss D.S. Suzuki H. Flashner Y. Kustu S. J. Mol.

However, a patch within C3 influenced oligomerization. The C3 region was especially important in interacting with ς54 during the transition state but not important in inducing ς54holoenzyme to engage the nontemplate strand of the promoter.

Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8934-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Prior to transcription, both the activator and the holoenzyme are usually inactive, with the latter being promoter-bound in a closed complex. After appropriate signaling pathways are initiated, sites typically located about 100–200 base pairs upstream of the promoter become bound by the modified activator protein (4Wyman C. Rombel I. North A.K. Bustamante C. Kustu S. Science. 1997; 275: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Transcription occurs when a DNA loop is formed, allowing activator and holoenzyme to touch and use the ATPase of activator to trigger opening of the DNA by holoenzyme (5Weiss D.S. Batut J. Klose K.E. Keener J. Kustu S. Cell. 1991; 67: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 6Wedel A. Weiss D.S. Popham D. Droge P. Kustu S.

These enhancer-binding activator proteins often have three domains, as exemplified by the Salmonella typhimurium NtrC protein (8Morett E. Segovia L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6067-6074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain is needed for protein binding to the enhancer. The N-terminal domain receives the metabolic activation signal and begins its processing. The central domain is required for activation, since it contains the information that allows the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to the melting of the DNA by holoenzyme. How ATP hydrolysis is coupled to DNA melting by the activation domain is largely unknown. The central domain contains seven conserved regions termed C1 to C7. The C3 region is believed to be critical for several reasons. First, mutants have been found in this region that have significant levels of ATPase activity and bind DNA normally but fail in activating transcription (1North A.K. Weiss D.S. Suzuki H. Flashner Y. Kustu S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Second, some mutants in this region appear to be defective in interacting with ς54 (2Wang Y.K. Lee J.H. Brewer J.M. Hoover T.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Schumacher J. Jones S. Elderkin S. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar,10Lee J.H. Hoover T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9702-9706Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Third, there exists a distinct class of proteins that contain domains homologous to the central domain of ς54activators but activate forms of holoenzyme that lack ς54; these have sequences that differ primarily in the C3 region (e.g. Rhodobacter capsulatus NtrC) (11Foster-Hartnett D. Kranz R.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,12Pittard A.J. Davidson B.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Mutations within C3 generally cause a lack of energy coupling; however, the proposed roles of individual conserved amino acids have varied when different activators were studied (1North A.K. Weiss D.S. Suzuki H. Flashner Y. Kustu S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 2Wang Y.K. Lee J.H. Brewer J.M. Hoover T.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One focus of the current work will be to study the in vitro properties of mutants within this C3 region in a common context. Roles have been proposed for three of the other regions within this central activation domain. Regions C1 and C4 contain the Walker A and B motifs that interact with ATP (13Rombel I. Peters-Wendisch P. Mesecar A. Thorgeirsson T. Shin Y.K. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4628-4638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Region C7 is the site of a number of nonfunctional mutations, but its role is still unknown. Some studies suggest that it is involved in nucleotide binding (13Rombel I. Peters-Wendisch P. Mesecar A. Thorgeirsson T. Shin Y.K. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4628-4638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and others suggest a role in activator oligomerization (15Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. Cell. 1996; 86: 331-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This is an important consideration, because this class of proteins is converted from the dimer to a higher oligomer form as part of the activation process (16Porter S.C. North A.K. Wedel A.B. Kustu S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2258-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For this reason, we have also studied the properties of mutations in the C7 region. This study differs from prior ones in a number of significant ways. Prior mutations were studied in a number of different activator proteins and will now be studied in the context of a single protein. The protein chosen, pspFΔHTH, is essentially a pure activation domain; the virally induced protein contains no N-terminal signaling domain, and the natural C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA binding region has been deleted, but the dimerization region is still intact (17Klose K.E. North A.K. Stedman K.M. Kustu S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Jovanovic G. Rakonjac J. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This should allow all activation mutants to be studied in the same context in vitro, one that bypasses potential differences due to the differing influences of the unique signaling pathways of the various activators that have been studied previously (19O'Neill E. Wikstrom P. Shingler V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Wikstrom P. O'Neill E., Ng, L.C. Shingler V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 971-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, several recently developed assays related to activation (see below) can now be applied to this series of mutant proteins. To do this, we collected data on genetically screened C3 and C7 mutants from several proteins and remade them in pspFΔHTH. A few site-directed C3 mutants were added to extend coverage to every position within this critical region. The proteins were purified and assayed for transcriptional competence, for the ability to hydrolyze ATP, for their multimerization state, and for their ability to interact with ς54 and its holoenzyme. The resulting data yield proposals for the roles of the C3 and C7 regions in the context of a simple protein that acts as a pure activation domain. The plasmid pMJ15 contains His6-pspFΔHTH (18Jovanovic G. Rakonjac J. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used for site-directed mutagenesis. Escherichia coli core enzyme was from Epicentre. E. coliς54 was purified as reported (21Wang J.T. Syed A. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9538-9543Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Plasmid pHMK3′ contains K. pneumoniae ς54 with a heart muscle kinase tag attached to its 3′-end (22Casaz P. Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12145-12150Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and was purified as described previously for ς54 (21Wang J.T. Syed A. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9538-9543Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), except that induction was with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and growth was at 37 °C. pspFΔHTH and its mutants are purified as described (18Jovanovic G. Rakonjac J. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), except that a second batch purification was done. This involved elution with 330 mm imidazole and dialysis in the stated buffer without EDTA, followed by a second round of purification using the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads. Unless otherwise indicated, proteins were stored in elution buffer. In vitro activated transcription was conducted as described (23Guo Y. Lew C.M. Gralla J.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2242-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with minor changes. Briefly, 75 nm ς54 RNA polymerase was incubated with 0.5 mm GTP, 0.5 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm UTP in 1× buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) (24Dworkin J. Jovanovic G. Model P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) for 20 min at 37 °C before 1 μl of CTP mixture (50 μm CTP and 0.2 μCi/μl [α-32P]CTP) was added. This mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min at 37 °C before the sample was prepared for loading on 6% PAGE with urea. Radiolabeled RNA was analyzed with a PhosphorImager. The filter binding assay was done as described (13Rombel I. Peters-Wendisch P. Mesecar A. Thorgeirsson T. Shin Y.K. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4628-4638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor changes. Briefly, 5 μm pspFΔHTH and its mutants were incubated in 1× buffer A (25 mm Hepes at pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) before ATPγS1 mix (0.6 mm ATPγS, 69 μm [γ-35S]ATP) was added to the 20-μl reaction. This was incubated at 37 °C for 4 min. The reaction was applied to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.45-μm Immobilon P, prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions; Millipore Corp.), which sat on top of a sintered glass filter, and vacuum was quickly applied to remove liquid. 1 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Hepes at pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2) was immediately applied to the membrane followed by vacuum. The membrane was dried, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Each experiment was normalized using a parallel sample of wild type protein. In a standard Pi release assay (13Rombel I. Peters-Wendisch P. Mesecar A. Thorgeirsson T. Shin Y.K. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4628-4638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 200 nm pspFΔHTH and its mutants were incubated in 1× ATPase buffer (25 mm Hepes at pH 7.5, 20 mmMgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (18Jovanovic G. Rakonjac J. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), 0.3 mm ATP, 20 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 0.3 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP) for 15 min at 37 °C. A 1-μl aliquot was spotted onto a prerun polyethyleneimine TLC plate, and electrophoresis was with 0.75m phosphate buffer at pH 4.1. Afterward, the plate was dried and analyzed using a PhosphorImager. Sample dye was added to 2.5 μg of protein, sample was loaded onto a 4% stacking, 10% resolving native polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresis was performed as described (25). In samples that contained ATP, 4 mm ATP was incubated with the protein for 5 min on ice prior to electrophoresis in a system with 4 mm ATP in the gel and electrophoresis buffer. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking was in Buffer G (50 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7, 20 mm NaCl, and 12% glycerol). Where indicated, 4 mm ATP was incubated with 16 μm activator for 5 min at 30 °C. 160 μm glutaraldehyde was added to 16 μm protein in a 6.75-μl reaction volume. This was incubated at 30 °C for 12 min, followed by the addition of 1 μl of 1 m glycine to stop the reaction. 3 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE dye was added, heated for 2 min at 90 °C, and then loaded onto a 8% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize. Promoter probes and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were as described (26Guo Y. Wang L. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3736-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 1 nm annealed promoter probe was added to 7.5 nm holoenzyme in 1× STA buffer (25 mm Tris acetate at pH 8, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 3.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 (9Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Schumacher J. Jones S. Elderkin S. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)). Where indicated, 1.5 μm pspFΔHTH protein or 4 mm ATP concentration was present. The 10-μl reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min followed by the addition of 0.5 μl of 2 mg/ml heparin. This was incubated for an additional 5 min before analysis by 5% PAGE (Minigel system; Bio-Rad) in 1× TBE buffer. The gel was run at 300 V at room temperature. Binding of pspFΔHTH to ς54 in the presence of ADP-aluminum fluoride was as described (9Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Schumacher J. Jones S. Elderkin S. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Where indicated, 10 μm activator was added for 5 min at 30 °C to STA buffer with 150 nm32P-labeled heart muscle kinase tagged ς54, 50 ng of α-lactoalbumin, 0.2 mm ADP, 5.0 mm NaF. 0.2 mm AlCl3 was then added and allowed to incubate for an additional 10 min before being loaded onto a native protein gel. Fig.1 (top) shows the alignment of the C3 and C7 regions as well as (bottom) the mutations that were made in pspFΔHTH. Most of these replicated previously identified nonfunctional mutants within Salmonella typhimurium NtrC (1North A.K. Weiss D.S. Suzuki H. Flashner Y. Kustu S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), Rhizobium melioti DctD (2Wang Y.K. Lee J.H. Brewer J.M. Hoover T.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and Bradyrhizobium japonicum NifA (27Gonzalez V. Olvera L. Soberon X. Morett E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A few changes were based on other proteins (15Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. Cell. 1996; 86: 331-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Takata M. Guo L. Katayama T. Hase M. Seyama Y. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), as shown. Finally, four site-directed serine substitutions were made in the intensively studied and well conserved C3 region so that every residue would be covered by mutation. These four positions have not been studied previously in vitro. The C7 region is sparsely covered by previously identified nonfunctional mutants, and we have not attempted to saturate it. The set consisted of 23 individual substitutions in pspFΔHTH. These 23 proteins were purified according to Jovanovic et al. (18Jovanovic G. Rakonjac J. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with some modifications. They were then tested in anin vitro transcription assay (Fig.2 and not shown) using the ς54-dependent glnAp2promoter. All except one of the proteins, E76Q, were very defective in transcription in vitro. The lack of significant activity of all but one of these is consistent with the original mutant phenotypes (1North A.K. Weiss D.S. Suzuki H. Flashner Y. Kustu S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 2Wang Y.K. Lee J.H. Brewer J.M. Hoover T.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and, in the cases studied, with in vitrotranscription studies using the original proteins. The four site-directed mutants in C3 were also nonfunctional, confirming the general importance of residues within this region. Thus, the data confirms that mutations in pspFΔHTH largely reflect the same gross defects seen when the same changes were made in a variety of other proteins containing homologous domains. The ATPase activity of this class of activator proteins is essential for function (5Weiss D.S. Batut J. Klose K.E. Keener J. Kustu S. Cell. 1991; 67: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were subjected to an ATPase assay, and the results are shown in Table I. Six of the 23 mutants, A82N, G83D, and G87K in C3, R227H and G224V in C7, and R235H near C7, lacked detectable activity. One C3 mutant, S75F, had activity that was equal to or slightly better than wild type. All of the other mutants had lowered amounts of ATPase activity, ranging as low as 6% of wild type levels.Table IATPase and ATPγS binding assaysPspFΔHTHATPaseATPγS bindingWild type++++S75F+++S75I+/−+E76Q++/−L77S+/−+/−F78S+/−+/−G79S+/−+/−H80R++E81S++/−A82N−+G83D−+/−A84V+/−+F85A+/−+/−F85L++T86A+/−+/−T86M++T86I++G87K−+/−A88T+/−+/−G224D+/−+/−G224V−+/−R227H−−R227C+/−+R235H−+Symbols represent ATP hydrolysis relative to wild type as follows: ++, 100% and greater; + 75–25%; +/− 24–6%; −, below 6%.

For ATPγS binding: ++, 100% and greater, +, 75–30%; +/−, 29%–6%; −, below 6%. Thus, only one of the mutants in region C3 (S75F) showed no defect in ATPase activity and yet was transcriptionally deficient. This would be a strict coupling mutant. Six other C3 mutants retained on average 50% of the wild type level of activity (plus symbols in Table I) despite showing little or no transcription. These too, are very strong candidates for coupling mutants in pspFΔHTH. The locus of coupling mutations being in the C3 region is consistent with prior studies using other proteins (1North A.K. Weiss D.S. Suzuki H. Flashner Y. Kustu S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 2Wang Y.K. Lee J.H. Brewer J.M. Hoover T.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, some differences in ATPase activity are apparent in the data. The adjacent mutants S75F and E76Q failed to show activity in NtrC (13Rombel I. Peters-Wendisch P. Mesecar A. Thorgeirsson T. Shin Y.K. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4628-4638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but do here in pspFΔHTH (Table I), as a different mutation in Ser75did for DctD (S75I) (2Wang Y.K. Lee J.H. Brewer J.M. Hoover T.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). H80R also showed activity in pspFΔHTH, whereas it did not in DctD (2Wang Y.K. Lee J.H. Brewer J.M. Hoover T.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is possible that the retention of ATPase activity in these three mutants in pspFΔHTH is related to the lack of other domains that might contribute to suppression of activity. On the other hand, G87K has ATPase activity in NtrC but none here. Overall, however, the agreement between pspFΔHTH mutants and that of other proteins is quite good. The C7 region mutants showed varying degrees of ATPase activity, although on average they were more defective than those in the C3 region (Table I). In partial agreement, the C7 mutants studied previously in NtrC were all defective in ATP hydrolysis (13Rombel I. Peters-Wendisch P. Mesecar A. Thorgeirsson T. Shin Y.K. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4628-4638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the whole, the evidence indicates that the C7 region is required for ATPase activity, although whether this effect is direct or indirect is not established by the existing experimental data. ATP binding was also assayed to learn whether the lack of hydrolysis in some cases was due to a lack of binding. Since ATP binding levels in the membrane-binding assay are low, as also shown previously (13Rombel I. Peters-Wendisch P. Mesecar A. Thorgeirsson T. Shin Y.K. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4628-4638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wikstrom P. O'Neill E., Ng, L.C. Shingler V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 971-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the data obtained varied somewhat for duplicates. For this reason, data from four or five experiments were needed to obtain the average ranges shown in Table I. The procedure relies on the ability of proteins to retain the nonhydrolyzable analogue ATPγS during a membrane-binding assay. Since the assay involves washing filters, the extent of ATP binding is far less than in the equilibrium experiments below. Nonetheless, the mutant data show defects relative to wild type. The results showed that of the six mutants that could not hydrolyze ATP, two bound ATPγS well (A82N and R235H; Table I), and the others bound it either with significantly reduced affinity (G83D, G87K, and G224V) or at a level below the sensitivity of the assay (R227H). We infer that at least some of these mutants cannot hydrolyze ATP because it is poorly bound. In terms of pure coupling effects, A82N and R235H are the only two mutants that can bind ATPγS but could not hydrolyze ATP (Table I). These various ATP-related defects are very widespread in the data, despite the fact that the Walker A and B regions are still intact. This suggests that for a number of mutants the defect could be indirect. For this class of proteins, function requires the formation of higher order oligomers (4Wyman C. Rombel I. North A.K. Bustamante C. Kustu S. Science. 1997; 275: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The central activation domain has been implicated to be involved in oligomerization (29Flashner Y. Weiss D.S. Keener J. Kustu S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 700-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); however, it is not known which amino acids in this domain are involved. To assay for these, we next studied the multimerization states of the collection of mutants. PspFΔHTH has been reported to exist predominantly as a dimer (72 kDa) with higher molecular weight oligomers occurring at high concentrations of protein (18Jovanovic G. Rakonjac J. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We repeated the native gel assay to confirm this under the present conditions and to learn the multimerization status of the collection of mutants. This initial assay was conducted using normal solution concentrations of pspFΔHTH, where dimers are expected to predominate. In this assay, pspFΔHTH runs as a very broad band with an apparent molecular weight somewhat higher than that expected for a dimer (Fig. 3 A,Wt). This broad band has been seen previously (18Jovanovic G. Rakonjac J. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and may represent the different conformers of pspFΔHTH (30Volkman B.F. Lipson D. Wemmer D.E. Kern D. Science. 2001; 291: 2429-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) undergoing kinetic exchange. Although at this concentration the dimer is the predominant form in solution, it is difficult to say with certainty what forms exist within the broad band. At this protein concentration, no specific bands that would clearly represent higher order oligomers are seen. When the mutant proteins are assayed, many show smears with mobility altered slightly from wild-type or with lesser intensity. These and other results were reproducible using two different preparations of proteins. The mobility changes may represent alterations in the equilibrium population of different oligomers undergoing kinetic exchange during the native gel electrophoresis. Two patches of mutants, however, show bands that are more discrete than wild-type and also have altered mobility. One of these consists of the adjacent amino acids Leu77, Phe78, and Gly79 in the C3 region. In these cases, the broad band observed with wild type is replaced by a series of discrete bands beginning with an apparent dimer and including apparent higher molecular weight forms (Fig. 3 A, L77S, F78S, and G79Sversus wild type). These forms probably correspond to tetramers and hexamers, since the pattern resembles that seen for wild-type protein at high concentration (18Jovanovic G. Rakonjac J. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mutation of the adjacent residue Glu76 shows a sharpened band but little evidence of oligomerization (Fig. 3 A). No other mutations caused this pattern of band sharpening. We infer that this patch within the C3 region contains determinants that strongly affect the propensity of pspFΔHTH to form higher order multimers. The (E)LFG sequence is highly conserved within the ς54 family of activators (8Morett E. Segovia L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6067-6074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so this phenomenon could apply to other proteins. Alanine substitutions within this sequence in DctD led to some small defects in expression in vivo, but in vitro transcription and oligomerization state were not tested (2Wang Y.K. Lee J.H. Brewer J.M. Hoover T.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Other mutants that differed in mobility from wild type were restricted to the C7 region. In fact, all C7 mutants tested had altered mobility on native gels (Fig. 3 B). The broad band characteristic of wild type protein was converted into more discrete bands by the C7 mutations. In four of the five mutants, this band ran significantly lower on the gel (Fig. 3 B, e.g. G224D versus Wt), reducing the apparent molecular mass from 90 to 66 kDa (the theoretical dimer molecular mass is 72 kDa). Thus, the C7 region plays a role in influencing the conformational state of the pspFΔHTH dimer. In most cases, mutations convert a conformational diverse collection of states (a broad band with low mobility, Wt in Fig. 3 B) to unique species with apparently compacted conformations (narrow bands with high mobility; e.g. G224D in Fig. 3 B). Although the concentration used in this assay may be higher than found in vivo, the result shows that certain mutants alter the propensity to assume these various states. Most of the mutants show some evidence of discrete bands of differing mobility, particularly in the case of R227C. Moreover, not all the bands have precisely identical mobility. Thus, it appears that the C7 mutations create predominantly more compact forms of the protein, but many conformational states may still be accessible. We hypothesized that the C7 region mutations might be partially mimicking the effect of ATP, and so the experiments were repeated in the presence of ATP. The sample, gel, and buffer reservoir contained ATP to maximize its occupancy of the proteins during electrophoresis. The results for selected mutants of interest are shown in Fig. 3 C. The effect of ATP on the native gel mobility of the wild-type protein was dramatic. The broad band was converted to a narrow band with much greater mobility (Fig. 3, compare Wt in A withWt in C). In fact, the effect of ATP on wild-type closely mimicked the effects of C7 mutants (Fig. 3, compareWt in C and G224D in B). It appears that ATP converts a mixtur"

P53 deficiency caused abrogation of the immediate apoptotic response to each agent, but only led to increased survival after cisplatin treatment. Msh2 deficiency reduced the apoptotic response to each agent, but only led to increased crypt survival after NMNU treatment. Following cisplatin treatment, the response of (Msh2(-/-), p53(-/-)) mice paralleled that of the p53(-/-) mice. A delayed wave of apoptosis was observed in both p53(-/-) and (Msh2(-/-), p53(-/-)) mice demonstrating this phenomenon to be independent of functional Mismatch repair (MMR). We conclude that loss of either p53 or Msh2 dependent apoptosis does not predict long-term crypt survival in vivo, however genetic status clearly can modulate survival for some agents such as cisplatin."

Adenylosuccinate forms from 6-phosphoryl-IMP and l-aspartate by the movement of the purine ring into the α-amino group of l-aspartate. Adenylosuccinate synthetase (IMP:l-aspartate ligase (GDP-forming), EC 6.3.4.4) catalyzes the committed step in AMP biosynthesis (1−3). In vertebrates, the synthetase is also a component of the purine nucleotide cycle and may play roles in metabolism beyond the maintenance of adenine nucleotide levels (2Honzatko R.B. Stayton M.M. Fromm H.J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 57-102Google Scholar). In organisms responsible for malaria and related diseases, adenylosuccinate synthetase plays an integral role in a dominant salvage pathway that transforms hypoxanthine into adenine nucleotides. Potent inhibition of adenylosuccinate synthetase generally terminates growth. Hence, the synthetase is a target in the development of herbicides and in the development of drugs for the treatment of cancer and infectious disease (2Honzatko R.B. Stayton M.M. Fromm H.J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 57-102Google Scholar).The reaction for synthetases from Escherichia coli and mouse muscle (and presumably all other synthetases as well) occurs in two stages: First, the γ-phosphoryl group of GTP is transferred to the O-6 atom of IMP, forming 6-phosphoryl-IMP (6PIMP). 1The abbreviations used are: 6PIMP, 6-phosphoryl-IMP; SAMP, adenylosuccinate; PDB, Protein Data Bank. 1The abbreviations used are: 6PIMP, 6-phosphoryl-IMP; SAMP, adenylosuccinate; PDB, Protein Data Bank.

Chem. 1984; 259: 12330-12333Google Scholar), and indeed, 6PIMP appears at the active site in crystal structures of the E. coli and mouse muscle synthetases (7Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6953-6961Google Scholar, 8Iancu C.V. Borza T. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26779-26787Google Scholar). The kinetic mechanism is random sequential with a strong bias in favor of the association of l-aspartate after the formation of an enzyme·IMP·GTP complex (9Cooper B.F. Fromm H.J. Rudolph F.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7323-7327Google Scholar). The synthetase requires Mg2+, but Ca2+ or Mn2+ also support catalysis, albeit at lower rates (1Stayton M.M. Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. Curr. Top.

Subramanian M.V. Siehl D.L. Anderson R.J. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15753-15759Google Scholar) or a hadacidin-related derivative (20Hanessian S., Lu, P.-P. Sanceau J.-Y. Chemla P. Gohda K. Fonne-Pfister R. Prade L. Cowan-Jacob S.W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 3159-3162Google Scholar) provide the only basis for modeling interactions between l-aspartate and the active site. Hadacidin (N-formyl-N-hydroxyglycine) is a competitive inhibitor with respect to l-aspartate (K i ∼ 10−6m) (21Clark S.W. Rudolph F.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 437: 87-93Google Scholar), but does it faithfully represent interactions of the true substrate? TheN-hydroxyl and N-formyl groups of hadacidin together are similar in charge and stereochemistry to a protonated α-carboxyl group of l-aspartate (3Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 1-8Google Scholar). Hence, hadacidin is like the mono-anionic form of succinate. In complexes of hadacidin, theN-hydroxyl group hydrogen bonds with an aspartyl side chain essential for catalysis (Asp13 and Asp43 inE. coli and mouse muscle synthetases, respectively). An unprotonated oxygen atom from the α-carboxyl group ofl-aspartate, however, cannot hydrogen bond with this aspartyl side chain. Either the active site has different conformations in its hadacidin and l-aspartate complexes or an additional co-factor (metal cation or proton) must stabilize the interaction between the aforementioned carboxyl groups (3Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 1-8Google Scholar).On the basis of model building, the β-carboxyl group ofl-aspartate may have a catalytic function in abstracting a proton from the α-amino group of l-aspartate and in orienting the lone pair orbital of the α-amino group toward the C-6 atom of IMP (3Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 1-8Google Scholar, 5Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Google Scholar). This putative catalytic role for the β-carboxyl group may account for the absence of measurable synthetase activity with other amino acids such as glycine, serine, and asparagine. On the other hand, hydroxylamine is a substrate of the synthetase (22Gorell A. Wang W. Underbakke E. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8817-8821Google Scholar, 23Markham D.G. Reed G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 184: 24-35Google Scholar), and in a buffer system of comparable ionic strength, it supports a maximal catalytic rate comparable with that ofl-aspartate. 2E. Underbakke and R. B Honzatko, unpublished. 2E. Underbakke and R. B Honzatko, unpublished.Hence, the participation of the β-carboxyl group ofl-aspartate as a base catalyst is at best speculative.The mechanism of feedback inhibition of the synthetase by AMP is also not fully resolved. Only a single AMP complex is available for theE. coli enzyme (17Fonné-Pfister R. Chemla P. Ward E. Girardet M. Kreuz K.E. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Schaer H.P. Gruetter M.G. Cowan-Jacob S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9431-9436Google Scholar), and in that complex the enzyme itself is modified near the active site by an adduct of 2-mercaptoethanol. Potent inhibition of the synthetase, such as that observed for AMP, generally involves synergistic combinations of two or more ligands. For instance, nitrate enhances inhibition by GDP (5Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Google Scholar, 23Markham D.G. Reed G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 184: 24-35Google Scholar) and GDP/Pi enhances inhibition by hydantocidin 5′-phosphate (19Poland B.W. Lee S.-F. Subramanian M.V. Siehl D.L. Anderson R.J. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15753-15759Google Scholar, 24Walters E.W. Lee S.F. Niderman T. Bernasconi P. Subramanian M.V. Siehl D.L. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 549-555Google Scholar). A complex of AMP alone therefore may not provide a comprehensive model for feedback inhibition of the synthetase.Presented here are crystal structures of recombinant mouse muscle adenylosuccinate synthetase in complexes with AMP alone (AMP complex), AMP·GDP·Pi·Mg2+ (AMP-product complex) and SAMP·GDP·SO 42−·Mg2+(SAMP-product complex). The first two complexes reveal distinct binding modes for AMP alone and in the presence of GDP/Pi. The SAMP-product complex offers the first instance of an enzyme active site ligated by SAMP. The succinyl moiety of SAMP occupies the hadacidin pocket but requires no additional metal ion to facilitate interactions involving its “α”-carboxyl group. Moreover, interactions at the active site are consistent with the protonation of the N-1 atom of SAMP during the transition state.RESULTSData collection and refinement statistics are in TableI. The AMP, AMP-product, and SAMP-product complexes have nominal resolutions of 2.7, 2.5, and 2.4 Å, respectively. All crystals belong to the space group P43212 and are isomorphous, having but one subunit of the synthetase dimer in the asymmetric unit. In all structures, electron density is present for the whole sequence save the first 26 amino acid residues of the N terminus. Stereochemistry of the refined models is as good as or better than models derived from data of comparable resolution. No residues fall in unallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, and ∼90% of all residues lie in most favorable regions. Thermal parameters vary from 27 to 100, 19 to 75, and 15 to 88 Å2 for the AMP, AMP-product, and SAMP-product complexes, respectively.

Borza T. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26779-26787Google Scholar,25Iancu C.V. Borza T. Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42146-42152Google Scholar). The unligated structure of the mouse muscle synthetase (PDB accession code 1J4B) defines the ligand-free conformations of these dynamic components, whereas the 6PIMP·GDP·hadacidin complex (PDB accession code 1LON) defines their ligated conformations. All dynamic components in the complexes reported here lie in strong electron density. Fig. 1 provides an overview of the SAMP-product complex and defines the dynamic elements of the synthetase. The Switch loop (residues 70–83), the IMP loop (residues 152–165), the GTP loop (residues 448–452), and the Val loop (residues 304–310) are in their ligated conformations. The pre-Switch element (residues 65–69) is in its ligated conformation or nearly so. Small but significant variations in conformation of the pre-Switch element are discussed thoroughly below. The Asp loop (residues 330–336) is in its ligand-free conformation in the AMP and AMP-product complexes and in its ligated conformation in the SAMP-product complex.AMP Complex (PDB Accession Code1MF1)The IMP pocket and the β-phosphoryl site of the GDP pocket have appreciable electron density in omit maps. The electron density at the IMP pocket is consistent with a molecule of AMP (Fig. 2). The electron density associated with the β-phosphoryl site of GDP is probably an acetate molecule, given the following observations. (i) The thermal parameter of a water molecule refined at the β-phosphoryl site is approximately one-half the value of thermal parameters for nearby atoms of the protein, whereas the thermal parameters for an acetate molecule are comparable with those of nearby atoms. (ii) The mouse muscle IMP complex (PDB accession code 1IWE; resolution of 2.1 Å) has electron density at the β-phosphoryl site of GDP that clearly represents a bound acetate molecule (8Iancu C.V. Borza T. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26779-26787Google Scholar).Figure 2Stereoview of AMP bound to the active site. Electron density is from an omit map (coefficients of 2F obs − F calc, αcalc phases) contoured at 3ς using a cut-off radius of 1 Å. Dashed lines represent donor-acceptor interactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The 5′-phosphoryl group of AMP interacts with the backbone amide and side chain of Thr163 and with the side chains of Asn68, Arg177#, and Thr271(Arg177# comes from the symmetry-related subunit of the dimer). The 2′-hydroxyl group, N-7 atom, and 6-amino group of AMP hydrogen bond with backbone carbonyl 305 (Val loop), the side chain of Asn256, and backbone carbonyl 69 (part of the pre-Switch loop), respectively. The pre-Switch loop is almost in its ligated conformation (as defined by the 6PIMP·GDP·hadacidin complex), but peptide linkages between residues 68–70 have significantly different orientations (see below). One oxygen atom of Asp43 is 3.4 Å from the N-1 atom of AMP. As neither the N-1 atom nor Asp43 should be protonated at pH 7, this interaction is probably a nonbonded contact rather than a hydrogen bond.AMP-product Complex (PDB Accession Code1MF0)Electron density from omit maps is consistent with bound AMP, GDP, Mg2+ and Pi (Fig.3). Protein interactions with GDP are identical to those reported previously in other mouse muscle complexes (PDB accession codes 1LNY and 1LON). Mg2+ coordinates oxygen atoms, a total of six, from backbone carbonyl 70, Asp43, Pi, the phosphoryl groups of GDP and a water molecule (Fig. 3). The water molecule is 2.8 Å from the Mg2+, and also hydrogen bonds with Arg337. The oxygen atom from Asp43, on the other hand, has a coordination distance to the Mg2+ of 2.0 Å. These coordinate and hydrogen bonds are of significance to the proposed mechanism of the synthetase (see “Discussion”). The Pi molecule, in addition to its coordination with Mg2+, hydrogen bonds with backbone amides 43, 70, and 256, with the side chains of Lys46, His71 and Asn256, and with the 6-amino group of AMP (Fig. 3).Figure 3Stereoview of AMP-product complex.Electron density covering AMP, orthophosphate (labeled Pi), Mg2+, and GDP is from an omit map (coefficients of 2F obs − F calc, αcalc phases) contoured at 3ς using a cut-off radius of 1 Å (top). Dashed lines represent donor-acceptor interactions and coordinate bonds to the Mg2+(bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Although interactions at the 5′-phosphoryl group of AMP are identical in the AMP and AMP-product complexes, the presence of Pi, Mg2+ and GDP alters the interactions at the base of AMP. By coordinating to Mg2+, the side chain of Asp43moves toward the N-1 atom of AMP. Both oxygen atoms of the aspartyl side chain are ∼3.0 Å from atom N-1. These contacts, however, for reasons noted above, are probably not hydrogen bonds. The coordination of backbone carbonyl 70 to Mg2+ evidently triggers a rotation of 180° in the peptide linkage between residues 69 and 70. The pre-Switch loop (residues 65–69) is now in its ligated conformation. Consequently, backbone carbonyl 69 no longer hydrogen bonds with the 6-amino group of AMP (as observed in the AMP complex above), being replaced instead by backbone carbonyl 68. The side chain of Asn68 also shifts by ∼1 Å but retains its hydrogen bond with the 5′-phosphoryl group of AMP. To avoid a close contact with the Pi molecule, the entire base of AMP tilts some 25° relative to that observed in the AMP complex. As a consequence, Asn256 no longer hydrogen bonds with the N-7 atom of AMP. Furthermore, the 2′-hydroxyl group of AMP hydrogen bonds with backbone amide 306, instead of backbone carbonyl 305, as in the AMP complex. In fact, the peptide link between residues 305 and 306 has undergone a rotation of ∼180°.SAMP-Product Complex (PDB Accession Code1MEZ)Electron density from omit maps is consistent with bound GDP, SO42− (at the 6-phosphoryl site of 6PIMP), Mg2+, and SAMP at the active site (Fig.4). All dynamic loops adopt their ligated conformations. Interactions involving GDP, SO42−, Mg2+, and the AMP moiety of SAMP are identical to those above for the AMP-product complex. (The sulfate anion adopts all of the interactions of Pi in the AMP-product complex.) The tilt of the base moiety of SAMP (∼30°) is approximately the same as that observed for the base of AMP in the AMP-product complex. Interactions involving the succinyl moiety of SAMP maintain the ligated conformation of the Asp loop. One of the oxygen atoms of the “β”-carboxyl group of SAMP hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Arg335 and Thr333, whereas the other oxygen atom interacts with backbone amides 331, 332, and 333. One of the oxygen atoms of the α-carboxyl group of SAMP coordinates to Mg2+, whereas the other oxygen atom hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Arg337 and backbone amide 331.Figure 4Stereoview of SAMP-product complex.Electron density covering SAMP is from an omit map (coefficients of 2F obs − F calc, αcalc phases) contoured at 3ς using a cut-off radius of 1 Å. Dashed lines represent donor-acceptor interactions and coordinate bonds to the Mg2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Despite restraints, the base moiety of SAMP deviates from planarity. Viewed “edge-on” as in Figs. 4 and 5, the tilt of the purine base from its 6PIMP to its SAMP position is the combination of a geometric distortion (bending of the purine ring) and a rigid body rotation of the entire nucleotide. The modest resolution of the SAMP-product complex does not allow the assignment of geometric distortions with certainty to any particular subset of atoms, but the displacement of atom C-6 from the plane defined by atoms N-1, N-6, and C-5 is evident (Fig. 4). The bending of the base moiety of SAMP is opposite to that of 6PIMP, whereas the base moiety of the nucleotide in the AMP complex takes up an intermediate position.Figure 5Definition of the tilt angle of the base moiety. The alignment of 6PIMP and SAMP comes from the superposition of Cα coordinates of the 6PIMP·GDP·hadacidin complex (8Iancu C.V. Borza T. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26779-26787Google Scholar) and the SAMP-product complex. The base moiety of 6PIMP defines a tilt angle of 0°.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Close nonbonded or hydrogen-bonded contacts involving the SAMP molecule are clearly in evidence. Oxygen atoms of the α-carboxyl group have contacts of ∼2.8 Å with the N-6 and Cβ atoms, respectively, of SAMP. Perhaps of greater significance is the aberrant donor-acceptor distance of 2.3 Å between the 2′-hydroxyl group of SAMP and backbone carbonyl 305. Several alternative models were built and refined here. The rotation of the peptide linkage between Val305 and Gly306 removed the close donor-acceptor distance but introduced a nonbonded contact of 2.4 Å between backbone carbonyls 305 and 306, as well as significant electron difference density in proximity to the 2′-hydroxyl group of SAMP. Rotations about the Cα–Cβ bond of Val305 had no appreciable effect, and the conformation of the ribosyl moiety of SAMP (2′-endo) already had maximized the donor-acceptor distance in question. Backbone carbonyls of the Val loop (residues 304–310) and the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups of SAMP fall into distinct electron density in omit maps, and furthermore, the electron density between the 2′-hydroxyl group and backbone carbonyl 305 is continuous at a contour level of 1ς. The significance of geometric distortions and close contacts involving SAMP is discussed below.In models of the active site, the side chain of Asp43(Asp13 in the E. coli synthetase) makes a close contact with the α-carboxyl group of l-aspartate (5Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Google Scholar). In the SAMP-product complex, however, Asp43 has acceptable nonbonded contacts with the α-carboxyl group of SAMP of no less than 3 Å. Instead, the oxygen atom of Asp43 that coordinates Mg2+ (coordination distance is now increased to 2.5 Å) makes a contact of 2.5 Å with the N-1 atom of SAMP. As the ligands are all in strong electron density, the short contact distance above infers a hydrogen bond and a proton associated with either the N-1 atom of SAMP or the oxygen atom of Asp43. The state of protonation of the N-1 atom of SAMP is significant to the catalytic mechanism (see “Discussion”).DISCUSSIONAMP from complexes of the mouse muscle and E. colisynthetases superimposes on the productive binding mode of IMP (chain A of PDB accession code 1IWE) (8Iancu C.V. Borza T. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26779-26787Google Scholar). Yet the pre-Switch loops of these AMP complexes match the conformation of the pre-Switch loop when it binds IMP nonproductively (chain B of PDB accession code 1IWE). Backbone carbonyl 69 hydrogen bonds with the 6-amino group of AMP, whereas that same carbonyl forces the base moiety of IMP out of its pocket to relieve an unacceptable contact with the O-6 atom (8Iancu C.V. Borza T. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26779-26787Google Scholar). In crystallographic complexes, IMP binds to the GTP pocket only when the pre-Switch loop is in its nonproductive conformation. Hence, AMP ligation may favor the binding of IMP to the GTP pocket as well.GDP, Pi, and Mg2+ alter the binding of AMP and the conformation of the pre-Switch loop. The conformation of the protein in the AMP-product complex is identical to that of the 6PIMP·GDP complex (PDB accession code 1LNY) (8Iancu C.V. Borza T. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26779-26787Google Scholar), even though recognition of the base moieties of AMP and 6PIMP differ substantially. The hydrogen bond between the 6-amino group of AMP and Pi(as opposed to the corresponding covalent bond in 6PIMP) forces the base of AMP to tilt some 25° out of the space occupied by the base of 6PIMP. As a consequence, Asn256 cannot hydrogen bond with the N-7 atom of AMP in the AMP-product complex. In fact, AMP in the presence of GDP·Pi·Mg2+ binds as an analogue of SAMP, whereas AMP alone binds as an analogue of IMP.Atoms N-1, C-6, N-6, and Cα of SAMP in solution probably lie in the same plane, favoring tautomeric forms of SAMP in which either atom N-6 or atom N-1 bears a proton (Fig.6). Hence, in solution, a partial double bond covalently links atoms N-6 and C-6. The synthetase, however, stabilizes a conformation of SAMP (C-6 to N-6 torsion angle of ∼70°) that precludes the tautomeric forms of Fig. 6. By reducing the bond order between atoms C-6 and N-6 of SAMP, the synthetase enhances the basicity of the N-6 atom. In fact, the pKa of atom N-6 of enzyme-bound SAMP may approximate that of the imidazolium group of histidine. Protonation must occur at some point of the reverse reaction to stabilize the development of negative charge on atom N-6 as l-aspartate forms. Evidently, the synthetase accomplishes proton transfer to atom N-6 in its SAMP ground state complex.Figure 6Comparison of SAMP tautomers in solution and SAMP in its ground state enzyme complex. See “Discussion” for details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In the forward reaction, therefore, the neutral amino group ofl-aspartate probably participates in two hydrogen bonds: It is a proton donor to backbone carbonyl 68 (carbonyl 38 in the E. coli synthetase) and a proton donor in a bifurcated hydrogen bond with a pair of oxygen atoms coordinated to the catalytic Mg2+ (Fig. 7). This hydrogen bond network orients the lone pair orbital of the neutral α-amino group of l-aspartate toward atom C-6 of 6PIMP. Neither backbone carbonyl 68 nor the oxygen atoms coordinated to Mg2+ are effective catalytic bases in the abstraction of a proton from the α-amino group of l-aspartate. Furthermore, the SAMP complex does not support a direct catalytic role for the β-carboxyl group of l-aspartate in proton abstraction (5Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Google Scholar). Proton abstraction is unnecessary, however, if as suspected the synthetase stabilizes the N-6 protonated form of SAMP.Figure 7Model for thel-aspartate·6PIMP·GDP·Mg2+ complex.Interactions involving the two hydrogen atoms o"
