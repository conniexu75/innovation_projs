However, the role of β3-ARs in normal physiology is unknown. To address this issue, homologous recombination was used to generate mice that lack β3-ARs. This was accomplished by direct injection of a DNA-targeting construct into mouse zygotes. Twenty-three transgenic mice were generated, of which two had targeted disruption of the β3-AR gene. Mice that were homozygous for the disrupted allele had undetectable levels of intact β3-AR mRNA, as assessed by RNase protection assay and Northern blotting, and lacked functional β3-ARs, as demonstrated by complete loss of β3-agonist (CL 316,243)-induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity and lipolysis. β3-AR-deficient mice had modestly increased fat stores (females more than males), indicating that β3-ARs play a role in regulating energy balance. Importantly, β1 but not β2-AR mRNA levels up-regulated in white and brown adipose tissue of β3-AR-deficient mice (brown more than white), strongly implying that β3-ARs mediate physiologically relevant signaling under normal conditions and that “cross-talk” exists between β3-ARs and β1-AR gene expression. Finally, acute treatment of normal mice with CL 316,243 increased serum levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) (3.2-fold) and insulin (140-fold), increased energy expenditure (2-fold), and reduced food intake (by 45%). These effects were completely absent in β3-AR-deficient mice, proving that the actions of CL are mediated exclusively by β3-ARs. β3-AR-deficient mice should be useful as a means to a better understanding of the physiology and pharmacology of β3-ARs. β3-Adrenergic receptors (β3-ARs) are expressed predominantly in white and brown adipose tissue, and β3-selective agonists are potential anti-obesity drugs.

Atypical β-AR activity has been observed predominantly in white and brown adipose tissue (1Zaagsma J. Nahorski S.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 3-7Google Scholar, 2Arch J.R.S. Kaumann A.J. Med.

Pharmacol. 1988; 95: 723-734Google Scholar). Further evidence for the existence of atypical β-ARs has been the synthesis of novel β-AR agonists that potently stimulate lipolysis, energy expenditure, and gut relaxation, while having little or no effect on β1- or β2-AR-mediated processes(5Arch J.R.S.

Because atypical β-AR agonists increase energy expenditure, these compounds are currently being developed as anti-obesity agents(5Arch J.R.S. Ainsworth M.A. Cawthorne M.A. Piercy V. Sennitt M.V.

The gene encoding a third member of the human β-AR family, designated the β3-AR, has been cloned and characterized (8Emorine L.J. Marullo S. Briend-Sutren M.-M. Patey G. Tate K. Delavier-Klutchko C.

Strosberg A.D. Emorine L.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3721-3727Google Scholar) β3-AR genes have also been isolated. The RNA message encoding the β3-AR is found predominantly in white and brown adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract(9Granneman J.G. Lahners K.N. Chaudhry A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 895-899Google Scholar, 10Muzzin P. Revelli J.-P. Kuhne F. Gocayne J.-D. McCombie W.R. Venter J.C. Giacobino J.-P. Fraser C.M. J. Biol.

Pharmacologic characterization of cell lines expressing recombinant receptors has demonstrated that cloned β3-ARs are relatively resistant to blockade by conventional β-AR antagonists and are potently stimulated by atypical β-AR agonists(8Emorine L.J. Marullo S. Briend-Sutren M.-M. Patey G. Tate K. Delavier-Klutchko C. Strosberg A.D. Science. 1989; 245: 1118-1121Google Scholar, 9Granneman J.G. Lahners K.N. Chaudhry A. Mol.

Given that atypical β-AR activity and cloned β3-ARs have similar tissue distributions and pharmacologic profiles, it is generally accepted that the β3-AR is the atypical β-AR(2Arch J.R.S. Kaumann A.J. Med. Res. Rev. 1993; 13: 663-729Google Scholar, 12Emorine L. Blin N. Strosberg A.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 3-7Google Scholar). β1-, β2-, and β3-ARs all couple via Gα to adenylate cyclase, leading to an increase in cAMP. The resulting activation of protein kinase A mediates the major actions of these receptors which include stimulation of lipolysis in white adipocytes and thermogenesis in brown adipocytes (for review, see (13Lafontain M. Berlan M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1057-1091Google Scholar)). Since adipose tissue expresses all three β-ARs, it has been difficult to determine the functional significance of each subtype. A distinguishing feature of the β3-AR is that it appears to be relatively resistant to desensitization and down-regulation(14Granneman J.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 261: 638-642Google Scholar, 15Thomas R.F. Holt B.D. Schwinn D.A. Liggett S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4490-4494Google Scholar, 16Carpene C. Galitzky J. Collon P.

Krief S. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13148-13155Google Scholar). This has led to the hypothesis that its primary function might be to maintain signaling during periods of sustained sympathetic stimulation, such as that which occurs in brown adipose tissue during periods of chronic cold exposure or diet-induced thermogenesis. Murine white adipose tissue expresses β1-, β2-, and β3-AR mRNA transcripts at a ratio of 3:1:150, respectively(20Collins S. Daniel K.W. Rohlfs E.M. Ramkumar V. Taylor I.L. Gettys T.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 518-527Google Scholar), with a qualitatively similar relationship observed in brown adipose tissue, suggesting that β3-ARs might play a dominant role. Because of the absence of radioligands capable of detecting β3-ARs, however, it has been difficult to determine the relative number of β3- versus β1- and β2-AR binding sites. Historically, β-AR subtypes in adipose tissue have been quantified functionally by measuring β-AR agonist-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in isolated membrane preparations, followed by the resolution of dose-response curves into low (β3-AR) and high (β1- and β2-ARs) affinity components. Using such an approach it has been estimated that 23% of maximally stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in mouse adipose tissue is mediated by β1- and β2-ARs and that 77% is mediated by β3-ARs(20Collins S. Daniel K.W. Rohlfs E.M. Ramkumar V. Taylor I.L. Gettys T.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 518-527Google Scholar). In contrast, using rat adipocyte membranes it has been estimated that 70% of maximal stimulation is due to β1- and β2-ARs, and 30% is due to β3-ARs(14Granneman J.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 261: 638-642Google Scholar). Additional complexity is introduced when considering downstream responses such as lipolysis in white adipocytes or thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. Since only modest increases in cAMP are required to produce maximal activation(21Robinson G.A. Butcher R.W. Sutherland E.W. Cyclic AMP. Academic Press, New York1971Google Scholar, 22Steinberg D. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1976; 7: 157-198Google Scholar, 23Hales C.N. Luzio J.P. Siddle K. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1978; 43: 97-135Google Scholar), it is likely that large increases in lipolysis or thermogenesis might be observed with occupancy of only a fraction of available β-ARs (β1, β2, or β3). Studies of lipolysis using rat adipocytes have been conflicting, concluding that β1- and β2-ARs play either an important role (24Van Liefde I. Van Witzenburg A. Vauquelin G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 262: 552-558Google Scholar) or a minor role relative to β3-ARs(25Hollenga C. Zaagsma J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 98: 1420-1424Google Scholar). With respect to isolated brown adipocytes, it has been suggested that β3-ARs are predominantly responsible for mediating norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis(26Zhao J. Unelius L. Bengtsson T. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C969-C979Google Scholar). A number of in vivo studies have provided clues regarding the possible physiologic significance of β3-ARs. In genetically obese fa/fa rats (10Muzzin P. Revelli J.-P. Kuhne F. Gocayne J.-D. McCombie W.R. Venter J.C. Giacobino J.-P. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24053-24058Google Scholar) and ob/ob mice(20Collins S. Daniel K.W. Rohlfs E.M. Ramkumar V. Taylor I.L. Gettys T.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 518-527Google Scholar), β3-AR mRNA levels are significantly down-regulated, raising the possibility that decreased β3-AR function might contribute to the development of obesity in these animals. Of note, it has been reported recently that a missense mutation of the human β3-AR tends to be associated with obesity, decreased energy expenditure, reduced insulin sensitivity, and earlier onset of non-insulin-dependent diabetes(27Walston J. Silver K. Bogardus C. Knowler W.C. Celi F.S. Austin S. Manning B. Strosberg A.D. Stern M.P. Raben N. Sorkin J.D. Roth J. Shuldiner A.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 343-347Google Scholar, 28Widén E. Lehto M. Kanninen T. Walston J. Shuldiner A.R. Groop L.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 348-351Google Scholar, 29Clément K. Vaisse C. Manning B.St.J. Basdevant A. Guy-Grand B. Ruiz J. Silver K. Shuldiner A.R. Froguel P. Strosberg A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 352-354Google Scholar). These observations suggest that β3-ARs might also play an important role in humans as well. In summary, significant uncertainty exists regarding the physiologic importance of β3-ARs as well as the relative role of β3versus β1- and β2-ARs in mediating β-AR signal transduction in white and brown adipose tissue. In an attempt to clarify these issues, we have used homologous recombination to generate mice that lack β3-ARs. Using a mouse 129/SvJ genomic library (Stratagene) and published mouse β3-AR sequence(11Nahmias C. Blin N. Elalouf J.M. Mattei M.G. Strosberg A.D. Emorine L.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3721-3727Google Scholar), β3-AR genomic clones were obtained and mapped (Fig. 1). Two targeting constructs were generated: β3-KO+TK (for ES cell studies) and β3-KO (for zygote microinjections) (Fig. 1). To construct the vectors, the 5′ side of the targeting vector (from BamHI to XhoI) was directionally subcloned into PGEM-11 (Promega) to generate p5′β3-AR. A segment of β3-AR coding sequence was removed by replacing the 306-bp β3-AR NheI and XhoI fragment (corresponding to β3-AR residue 120, in the middle of the third transmembrane domain, to residue 222, at the COOH-terminal end of the fifth transmembrane domain) with a PGK-NEO-Poly(A) expression cassette, excised from pPGK-NEO-BKS (see below) with XbaI and SalI, to create p5′β3-AR+NEO. The right side of the targeting vector (from XhoI to SalI) was subcloned into PGEM-11 at the XhoI and SalI sites to create p3′β3-AR (p3′β3-AR clones with intact XhoI and SalI sites were selected). The insert was excised from p5′β3-AR+NEO with NotI and SalI and subcloned into p3′β3-AR opened at NotI and XhoI to create the mouse zygote targeting plasmid pβ3-KO. To generate the ES cell targeting plasmid (pβ3-KO+TK), the entire insert was excised from pβ3-KO with NotI and SalI and subcloned into pHSV-TK-PGEM (see below) opened at NotI and XhoI. pPGK-NEO-BKS was prepared by subcloning the PGK-NEO-Poly(A) expression cassette (30Adra C.N. Boer P. McBurney M.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 65-74Google Scholar) into bluescript KS at the EcoRI and HindIII sites. pHSV-TK-PGEM was prepared by subcloning the HSV-TK expression cassette pIC19R/MC1-TK (31Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1988; 336: 348-352Google Scholar) excised with XhoI and SalI into PGEM-11 at XhoI and SalI (clones with intact XhoI and SalI sites were selected). J1-ES cells, derived by E. Li and R. Jaenisch from a 129/terSv embryo, were cultured on γ-irradiated neomycin-resistant primary embryo fibroblasts as described previously(32Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Google Scholar). Fifteen million ES cells were electroporated with 20 μg of pβ3-KO+TK (linearized with NotI) and plated on 10 10-cm plates. On the following day, 5 plates received G418 (182 μg/ml active dose), and the other 5 plates received G418 and FIAU (0.2 μM 1-[2-deoxy,2-fluoro-β-D-arabinofuranosyl]-5-iodouracil; Bristol Meyers). Following 8 days of selection, drug-resistant clones were expanded individually, and genomic DNA was obtained for Southern blot analysis (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). Prior to injection, the β3-KO targeting vector was excised from pβ3-KO using NotI and SalI and then separated from the plasmid sequence using gel purification. Approximately 300-500 copies of the 14-kb β3-KO insert were injected into the male pronucleus of zygotes using standard techniques(33Hogan B. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Zygotes for injection were generated by mating 129/SvJ females and males (129/SvJ zygotes), FVB/N females and 129/SvJ males (FVB/N [mult] 129/SvJ hybrid zygotes), or FVB/N females and males (FVB/N zygotes). Injected zygotes were transferred to FVB/N pseudopregnant recipients as described previously(33Hogan B. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar), and genomic DNA was obtained from live born offspring for Southern blot analysis (Fig. 2). All animals had free access to food (Purina Chow 5008) and water and were handled in accordance with the principles and guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health. Genomic DNA was isolated from ES cells and mouse tails by sodium dodecyl sulfate/proteinase K digestion followed by salt precipitation(34Miller S.A. Dykes D.D. Polesky H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1215Google Scholar). The DNA was analyzed using standard Southern blotting techniques(35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue, epididymal white adipose tissue, and liver using either the guanidium-cesium chloride approach (Fig. 3) (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or RNAzol (Fig. 4) (Cinna/Biotecx Laboratory, Houston, TX). β1-, β2-, β3-AR and actin mRNAs were detected using standard Northern blotting techniques and 30 μg of total RNA(35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Murine β1-(36Cohen J.A. Baggott L.A. Romano C.

Bourlet Y. Buckingham M. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 23: 11-22Google Scholar) hybridization probes were generated using random priming from cDNA templates corresponding to codons 88-176 of the β1-AR (263 bp), codons 230-386 of the β2-AR (465 bp), codons 120-222 of the β3-AR (306 bp), and codons 220-303 of β-actin (250 bp). Note that the 306-bp probe used to detect β3-AR mRNA levels represents the same NheI-XhoI β3-AR fragment deleted during the construction of the targeting vector (Fig. 1). β3-AR and β-actin mRNAs were also detected using an RNase protection assay(39Jakubowski M. Roberts J.L. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1992; 4: 79-89Google Scholar). The radioactive β3-AR and actin cRNA probes were transcribed from the fragments described above. RNA samples (20 μg of total RNA) were hybridized with both 32P-labeled cRNA probes (0.5 ng) at 30°C for 18 h. Nonhybridized probes were digested with an RNase mixture (40 μg/ml RNase A, 2 μg/ml RNase T1) for 1 h at 37°C. The protected probes were resolved on a nondenaturing 5% acrylamide gel. The gels were dried and exposed to autoradiographic film.FIGURE 4β1-, β2-, and β3-AR mRNA levels in white and brown adipose tissue by Northern blotting. β1-, β2-, and β3-AR mRNA levels were determined by Northern blotting using 30 μg of total RNA isolated from epididymal white adipose tissue and interscapular brown adipose tissue of 5 control (C) and 5 β3-AR-deficient (K) 12-week-old male mice. Representative lanes from two control and two β3-AR-deficient samples are shown. PhosphorImager analyses of Northern blots were performed using all five control and five β3-AR-deficient samples (PhosphorImager data are described under “Results”). The blots were also hybridized with a β-actin probe. Northern blotting and the generation of probes were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The approximate sizes (in kb) of the detected signals are as follows: β1-AR, ~2.4; β2-AR, ~2.2; β3-AR, ~2.4; and β-actin, ~2.1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Studies were performed on animals that had free access to water and chow (Purina 5008) and were maintained at 23°C. All mice were of the following genotype: +/+ or -/- at the β3-AR gene locus on an inbred FVB background. Two separate experiments were performed and the results are shown in Table 2. In experiment 1, male and female control (+/+) and null (-/-) littermates of heterozygous parents were weaned at age 21 days and housed individually. Body weights were obtained at the age of 12 weeks. In experiment 2, control (+/+) offspring derived from wild type parents and null (-/-) offspring derived from null parents were weaned at age 21 days. Only offspring from litters containing 9-11 mice were used; all others were excluded. The males were housed individually, and females of similar genotype were housed two/cage. Body weight, perigenital fat pad weights (male, epididymal fat pads; female, parametrial fat pads), and carcasses were analyzed at the age of 15 weeks. For each individual animal, the paired fat pads were combined and weighed. Total body lipid content was assessed using alcoholic potassium hydroxide digestion with saponification of all fats, neutralization, and then enzymatic determination of glycerol as described previously(40Salmon D.M.W.

The animals were divided and maintained at either room temperature (23°C) or at 4°C. Three weeks later, the interscapular depot of brown fat was obtained and assessed for the following parameters: wet weight, total protein, DNA and uncoupling protein (UCP) content. Protein and UCP were determined as described previously(41Lowell B.B. Susulic V. Hamann A. Lawitts J.A. Himms-Hagen J. Boyer B.B. Kozak L.P. Flier J.S. Nature. 1993; 366: 740-742Google Scholar), and DNA was quantitated using the Hoechst dye 33258 and a Hoefer fluorometer according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA).

For analysis of adenylate cyclase activity, membranes were obtained from either isolated white adipocytes (44Greenberg A.S. Taylor S.I. Londos C. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1991; 261: R403-R411Google Scholar) by centrifugation as described previously. Isolated membranes were assayed for adenylate cyclase activity in the presence of varying concentrations of agonists over a 30-min period according to the method of Salomon(46Salomon Y. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 35-55Google Scholar), modified by the addition of tritiated cAMP to correct for cAMP recovery. For analysis of lipolysis, isolated white adipocytes (100 μl of a 10% isolated fat cell suspension) were incubated in a final volume of 500 μl, and glycerol release was measured over a 15-min period. Previous studies have demonstrated that glycerol release is linear for at least 15 min of incubation. (2)E. Tozzo and B. Kahn, unpublished data. Except when noted, the incubation medium consisted of a Krebs-Ringer-Hepes (30 mM) buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 2.5% bovine serum albumin (fraction V), 10 μM PIA (N6-[R-(-)-1-methyl-2-phenyl]adenosine), 1 unit/ml adenosine deaminase, and varying concentrations of agonists. Glycerol content of the incubation medium was determined using a sensitive radiometric assay(47Bradley D.C. Kaslow H.R. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 11-16Google Scholar), and fat cell number was assessed as described previously(48Hirsch J. Gallian E. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 110-119Google Scholar, 49Cushman S.W. Salans L.B. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 269-273Google Scholar). CL, isoproterenol, or saline was injected intraperitoneally into control and β3-AR-deficient mice; 15 min later the animals were quickly sacrificed using a small animal decapitator. Whole blood was collected and analyzed for blood glucose levels (One Touch Blood Glucose Meter, Lifescan, Inc., Milpitas, CA). Serum was then isolated and assayed for FFAs (NEFA C kit, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), glycerol (GPO-Trinder Kit, procedure 337, Sigma), and insulin (rat insulin kit, Linco Research Inc., St. Louis, MO). Oxygen consumption was measured as described previously (41Lowell B.B. Susulic V. Hamann A. Lawitts J.A. Himms-Hagen J. Boyer B.B. Kozak L.P. Flier J.S. Nature. 1993; 366: 740-742Google Scholar) in 12-week-old control and β3-AR-deficient male mice. The animals were conscious for studies using CL and isoproterenol but were anesthetized for studies using norepinephrine. Control and β3-AR-deficient male mice, 8 weeks old, were treated with an intraperitoneal injection of either saline or CL (1 mg/kg) on day 0. To acclimate the mice to injections and handling, saline was injected daily for 3 days preceding day 0 of the study. The mice were housed individually during the study. Food was weighed before injection and 24 h after, and the differences were assumed to represent g of food eaten per day. The cages were inspected for food spillage, and none was noted. All reagents, except where noted, were obtained from Sigma and were of the highest reagent grade. CL 316,243 was kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Claus and Dr. Elliot Danforth Jr. (American Cyanamid Co., Pearl River, NY). Tritiated cAMP and [α-32P]ATP were obtained from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). All statistical analyses were performed using the unpaired, two-tailed t test. The β3-KO+TK construct (Fig. 1) was electroporated into J1-ES cells and drug-resistant clones were selected. Genomic DNA was isolated and subjected to Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1 and 2A). Approximately 50% of the G418-resistant clones and 75% of the G418, FIAU doubly resistant clones had targeted disruption of the β3-AR gene (Table 1), indicating that homologous recombination events occurred at a frequency that equaled random integration events. Similarly high targeting frequencies have been observed with other genes(50te Riele H. Robanus Maanday E. Berns A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5128-5132Google Scholar).TABLE I Open table in a new tab A previous study demonstrated that homologous recombination can occur following microinjection of DNA into mouse zygotes(51Brinster R.L. Braun R.E. Lo D. Avarbock M.R. Oram F. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7087-7091Google Scholar). However, this approach appeared to be inefficient since gene targeting occurred in only 1 of 506 transgenic mice. Encouraged by the high targeting frequency observed in ES cells in the present study, a modified vector (β3-KO, Fig. 1) was then microinjected into the pronucleus of mouse zygotes to determine whether homologous recombination at the β3-AR locus might occur in the one cell embryo. Initially, injections were performed using inbred 129/SvJ mouse zygotes since these would be isogenic with the targeting vector (derived from a 129/SvJ mouse genomic library). However, the poor breeding performance of 129/SvJ mice severely limited these efforts. To circumvent this problem, hybrid zygotes were used (129/SvJ males mated with FVB/N females), and the targeting vector was injected into the peripheral, presumably male (129/SvJ), pronucleus. The targeting vector was also injected into inbred FVB/N zygotes. As shown in Fig. 2B, two transgenic lines with targeted disruption of the β3-AR were generated (B1 and B2). Further analysis revealed that the B1 founder was mosaic for the targeting event, transmitting the disrupted allele to only 2 of 31 offspring and that the B2 founder had a second integration event that was random (as shown below). B2 transmitted the disrupted allele to 17 of 35 offspring but also transmitted DNA e"
https://openalex.org/W2009225735,"Functional domains of the mouse aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) were investigated by deletion analysis. Ligand binding was localized to a region encompassing the PAS B repeat. The ligand-mediated dissociation of Ahr from the 90-kDa heat shock protein (HSP90) does not require the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt), but it is slightly enhanced by this protein. One HSP90 molecule appears to bind within the PAS region. The other molecule of HSP90 appears to require interaction at two sites: one over the basic helix-loop-helix region, and the other located within the PAS region. Each mutant was analyzed for dimerization with full-length mouse Arnt and subsequent binding of the dimer to the xenobiotic responsive element (XRE). In order to minimize any artificial steric hindrances to dimerization and XRE binding, each Ahr mutant was also tested with an equivalently deleted Arnt mutant. The basic region of Ahr is required for XRE binding but not for dimerization. Both the first and second helices of the basic helix-loop-helix motif and the PAS region are required for dimerization. These last results are analogous to those previously obtained for Arnt (Reisz-Porszasz, S., Probst, M.R., Fukunaga, B. N., and Hankinson, O.(1994) Mol. Cell. Biol. 14, 6075-6086) compatible with the notion that equivalent regions of Ahr and Arnt associate with each other. Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal half of Ahr does not affect dimerization or XRE binding but, in contrast to an equivalent deletion of Arnt, eliminates biological activity as assessed by an in vivo transcriptional activation assay, suggesting that this region of Ahr plays a more prominent role in transcriptional activation of the cyp1a1 gene than the corresponding region of Arnt.

Following ligand treatment, induction of CYP1A1 and several other enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism occurs in most tissues. Certain of these enzymes (including CYP1A1) are involved in the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to active genotoxic metabolites, and Ahr therefore plays an important role in carcinogenesis by these compounds. Ahr also mediates most, if not all, of the carcinogenic and toxic effects of the halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, although metabolism of these compounds does not appear to be involved (reviewed in (1Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Google Scholar)). aryl hydrocarbon receptor aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator Hepa-lclc7 90-kDa heat shock protein morpholinopropanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis period/aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator/single-minded single-minded period 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-ρ-dioxin xenobiotic responsive element basic helix-loop-helix chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The unliganded Ahr is located in the cytoplasm of the mouse hepatoma cell line, Hepa-1, as part of a complex that also contains two molecules of the 90-kDa heat shock protein (HSP90) and perhaps another protein of approximately 43 kDa(2Chen H.-S. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27554-27558Google Scholar). It is not known whether both, one, or neither of the HSP90 molecules bind Ahr directly. HSP90 appears to be required for ligand binding by Ahr(3Pongratz I. Mason G.G. Poellinger L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13728-13734Google Scholar). Binding of ligand leads to dissociation of Ahr from HSP90. In ligand-treated cells, Ahr is found in the nuclear fraction, from which it can be extracted in the form of a complex with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator protein (Arnt)(4Reyes H. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. Science. 1992; 256: 1193-1195Google Scholar, 5Pollenz R.S. Sattler C.A. Poland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 428-438Google Scholar). This complex is probably a heterodimer of the two proteins, although the presence of additional small protein(s) has not been rigorously excluded. Arnt appears to be a nuclear protein in Hepa-1 cells(5Pollenz R.S. Sattler C.A. Poland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 428-438Google Scholar, 6Hord N. Perdew G.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 618-626Google Scholar). Some evidence indicates that dissociation of Ahr from HSP90 occurs in the nucleus and that HSP90 may play a direct role in translocating Ahr into this organelle(7Wilhelmsson A. Cuthill S. Denis M. Wikstrom A.C. Gustafsson J.A. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 69-76Google Scholar, 8Perdew G.H. Arch. Biochem Biophys. 1991; 291: 284-290Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Arnt promotes the dissociation of Ahr from HSP90(9McGuire J. Whitelaw M.L. Pongratz I. Gustafsson J.-A. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2438-2446Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of the cyp1a1 gene results from the binding of the Ahr/Arnt heterodimer to short DNA sequences, termed xenobiotic responsive elements (XREs), located in the 5′-flanking region of the gene(4Reyes H. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. Science. 1992; 256: 1193-1195Google Scholar, 10Yao E.F. Denison M.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5060-5067Google Scholar, 11Lusska A. Shen E. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6575-6580Google Scholar, 12Watson A.J. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6874-6878Google Scholar). Both Ahr and Arnt bind directly to the XRE sequence(13Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Agbunag R.V. Ong M.S. Hankinson O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 511-518Google Scholar). Mouse Ahr and Arnt are 20% identical in amino acid sequence. They also show a striking resemblance in overall structure(14Ema M. Sogawa K. Watanabe N. Chujoh Y. Matsushita N. Gotoh O. Funae Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 246-253Google Scholar, 15Burbach K.M. Poland A. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8185-8189Google Scholar, 16Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Google Scholar). Both proteins contain bHLH motifs toward their amino termini. However, Ahr and Arnt represent a novel subclass of bHLH-containing transcription factors because they differ from most or all other such proteins in that (i) activation of the Ahr complex requires ligand, (ii) the XRE sequence differs from the E-box sequence, which is the recognition sequence for nearly all other bHLH-containing transcription factors (reviewed in (17Murre C. Baltimore D. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 861-879Google Scholar)), and (iii) both proteins contain an approximately 300-amino acid segment of sequence similarity, called the PAS domain. The PAS domains of each protein contain two copies of an approximately 50-amino acid degenerate direct repeat, referred to as the PAS A and PAS B repeats. The Drosophila proteins single-minded (Sim) and period (Per) also contain PAS domains, and this domain has been shown to mediate homodimerization of Per and heterodimerization of Per with Sim(18Huang Z.J. Edery I. Rosbash M. Nature. 1993; 364: 259-262Google Scholar). Deletion analysis indicates that both α-helices of the bHLH region of Arnt are required for dimerization with Ahr and that the basic region is required for XRE binding but not for dimerization(16Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Google Scholar). The XRE sequence is asymmetrical. Arnt binds to the side of the XRE that is identical in sequence to a half-site of an E-box, while Ahr binds to the side of the XRE not resembling an E-box half site(19Bacsi S.G. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 432-438Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that the basic region of Arnt conforms well to the consensus sequence for other bHLH proteins, while the basic region of Ahr conforms only poorly. Deletion of either the A or B segments of the PAS region of Arnt slightly reduces dimerization with Ahr, while deletion of the complete PAS region severely affects dimerization(16Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Google Scholar). Thus Arnt possesses multiple domains required for maximal heterodimerization with Ahr. We describe here a mutational analysis of Ahr that complements our previous mutational analysis of Arnt. We have used Ahr and Arnt proteins that are derived from the same species (mouse); have designed the deletion mutants such that individual functional domains are deleted precisely, so that we could accurately assess their putative roles in Ahr function; and have performed a comprehensive in vitro and in vivo phenotypic analysis of the mutants. pSportAhr, the mouse Ahr cDNA (15Burbach K.M. Poland A. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8185-8189Google Scholar) in the pSV.Sport1 expression vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) was kindly provided by Dr. Christopher Bradfield (Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL). Expression constructs for the mouse Ahr (pcDNAI/Neo/Ahr) and Arnt (pcDNAI/Neo/mArnt) cDNAs and generation of the Arnt mutants were described previously(16Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Google Scholar). The ΔC mutant of Ahr was generated by polymerase chain reaction using pSportAhr as template. The 5′ primer for ΔC was the same 5′ polymerase chain reaction primer used to generate the Ahr expression construct pcDNAI/Neo/Ahr(16Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Google Scholar), while the 3′ primer contained a four-nucleotide random sequence, a XhoI restriction site, a stop codon, and the complement of Ahr bases 1181-1191. After digestion with the appropriate restriction enzymes, the polymerase chain reaction product was ligated into the similarly digested pcDNAI/Neo vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), for in vitro and in vivo expression. Internal deletion mutants of Ahr were generated by the oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis system of Nakamaye and Eckstein (20Nakamaye K.L. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9679-9698Google Scholar) using the Oligonucleotide-Directed In Vitro Mutagenesis System, version 2.1. (Amersham Corp.). Mutagenesis of the Ahr cDNA was performed on a 1.2-kilobase SalI/BamHI fragment (1-1254 bp) from pSportAhr cloned into M13 mp18. After confirmation of each mutation by sequencing, the mutagenized fragment was transferred to pcDNAI/Neo for expression. This was accomplished by a three-way ligation of a 1.039-kilobase SacII/NarI fragment of pcDNAI/Neo/Ahr (containing pcDNAI/Neo sequence 1183-2196 bp and Ahr cDNA sequence -15 to 11 bp), a NarI/BamHI-mutagenized fragment of the Ahr cDNA (bp 11-1254 less the deletion), and a 8.715-kilobase SacII/BamHI fragment of pcDNAI/Neo/Ahr (containing pcDNAI/Neo sequences 0-1182 bp and 2258-6969 bp and Ahr cDNA sequence 1255-3077 bp). This ligation altered the 5′ region of the pSportAhr fragment to that of pcDNAI/Neo/Ahr, which resulted in a 4-fold increase in in vitro expression(16Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Google Scholar). Plasmids were prepared by the Qiagen maxiprep procedure according to the supplier's protocols (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The mouse hepatoma cell line, Hepa-1, and monkey kidney tumor cell line, CV-1, were cultured in nucleoside-free α-minimal essential medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated and dextran/charcoal-treated fetal calf serum as described previously (21Hankinson O. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 381-400Google Scholar). The Ahr and Arnt cDNAs and their mutant derivatives were all contained in the pcDNAI/Neo vector in the appropriate orientation for in vitro expression from the T7 polymerase promoter. The constructs were expressed in the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system in the presence or absence of L-[35S]methionine (final concentration, 1 mCi/ml; specific activity, >1,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham) according to the protocol from the supplier (Promega, Madison, WI). All reactions were incubated for 90 min at 30°C. The degree of expression of each construct was assayed by subjecting an aliquot from the incubation performed in the presence of L-[35S]methionine to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and subsequent quantitation on an AMBIS radioanalytic imaging system (AMBIS Inc., San Diego, CA) (henceforth referred to as β-scanning). The photoaffinity ligand 2-azido-3-[125I]iodo-7,8-dibromodibenzo-p-dioxin (specific activity 2176 Ci/mmol) was generously provided by Dr. Gary Perdew (Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN). TNT incubation mixtures containing equimolar amounts of each protein were diluted in HEDG buffer (25 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) and incubated with 0.15 μCi of ligand for 30 min at room temperature. After cooling the mixtures on ice, dextran/charcoal was added to remove unbound ligand. After centrifugation, the supernatants were irradiated at 366 nm by means of a Blak-Ray ML-49 UV lamp (UVP Inc., San Gabriel, CA) at a distance of 8 cm for 10 min. After acetone precipitation, pellets were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer(22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography. Quantitation of labeled proteins was performed on a LKB Ultroscan enhanced laser densitometer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Goat anti-mouse IgM (μ chain-specific; Pierce) was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ahr was synthesized in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine. The TNT reaction mixtures were incubated with 10 nM TCDD (in Me2SO, to a final concentration of 0.2% Me2SO) or solvent alone for 1.5 h at room temperature in the presence or absence of equimolar amounts of in vitro synthesized, unlabeled Arnt and/or 7.5 nM double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide containing mouse XRE-1. They were then diluted 100-fold with HSP immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mM MOPS, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Tween 20, and 0.02% NaN3) and incubated on ice for 2 h. Aliquots were then incubated for two more hours at 4°C with anti HSP90 monoclonal antibody 3G3 (Affinity Bioreagents, Neshanic Station, NJ) or control IgM (TEPC 183, Sigma), each preadsorbed to anti-mouse IgM-Sepharose. Pellets were washed five times with the same buffer, heat-denatured in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% gel. The dried gel was exposed to x-ray film and subsequently quantitated by β-scanning. For co-immunoprecipitation of the mutant derivatives of Ahr, the same procedure was used, except that the TNT reactions mixtures were directly diluted 200-fold in HSP immunoprecipitation buffer, in the absence of TCDD, Arnt, or XRE-1. Arnt (or its mutant derivatives) was synthesized in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine, while Ahr (or its mutant derivatives) was synthesized in the absence of isotope. The in vitro transcription and translation reactions containing equimolar amounts of Ahr (or its mutant derivatives) were mixed with 3 parts Arnt (or its mutant derivatives). The mixture was incubated with 10 nM TCDD (in Me2SO, to a final concentration of 0.2% Me2SO) or solvent alone, for 2 h at room temperature. The mixture was then adjusted to 25 mM HEPES, 1.2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4 (immunoprecipitation buffer), in a final volume of 100 μl. Excess affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to Ahr (13Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Agbunag R.V. Ong M.S. Hankinson O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 511-518Google Scholar) or the corresponding preimmune immunoglobulin G fraction was then added, and the incubation continued for an additional 2 h. The antigen-antibody complex was precipitated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Pharmacia) for 1 h at room temperature. The pellets were washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer(22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and then subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 7.5 or 15% gel. In addition to exposure to x-ray film, the dried gels were analyzed by β-scanning to quantitate the amount of radioactivity in each immunoprecipitate. The low signal generated by the preimmune IgG in the presence of TCDD was subtracted from the signal generated by the Ahr antibodies in calculating the values for the amount of co-immunoprecipitated Arnt protein in the presence of TCDD, while values obtained in the absence of TCDD were adjusted by subtracting the (low) signal generated by the preimmune IgG in the absence of TCDD. In vitro synthesized, unlabeled Ahr or its mutant derivatives were mixed with unlabeled Arnt or its mutant derivatives (1:1 molar ratio) and incubated in the presence of 10 nM TCDD (in Me2SO, to a final concentration of 0.2% Me2SO) or solvent alone at room temperature for 1.5 h. The mixture was then adjusted to 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 200 mM KCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 5 mM EDTA, 50 μg of poly(dI-dC)•(dI-dC)/ml, and the incubation continued for 20 min at room temperature. The mixture was then incubated for an additional 20 min in the presence of a 32P-labeled double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide containing mouse XRE1(16Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed on a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1 × HTE buffer (200 mM HEPES, 100 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). After exposure to x-ray film, the dried gels were used to quantitate the XRE•Ahr•Arnt complex by β-scanning. The Ahr cDNA constructs, with or without the Arnt cDNA, were cotransfected along with the CAT reporter plasmid, pMC6.3k (23Fujisawa-Sehara A. Sogawa K. Yamane M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4179-4191Google Scholar) (6 μg of each plasmid construct), into 5 × 105 CV-1 cells/60-mm dish by the method of Chen and Okayama(24Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). 16 h after transfection, cells were subjected to a 15% glycerol shock for 1.5 min and then refed media with or without 10 nM TCDD. They were harvested 24 h later. In an attempt to eliminate potential inducers of CYP1A1 in the medium used to grow the cells, the fetal calf serum was treated with dextran-coated charcoal, and the medium was stored in the absence of light. Cell lysates were produced by three cycles of freezing (dry ice/ethanol) and thawing (37°C water bath). Endogenous acetyl transferases were inactivated by incubation at 65°C for 10 min. CAT assays were performed as described previously(25Watson A.J. Weir-Brown K.I. Bannister R.M. Chu F.-F. Reisz-Porszasz S. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Sogawa K. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2115-2123Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. Results were calculated as nmol of CAT activity/mg of protein/30 min. The mutant constructs are presented in Fig. 1. Ahr mutant constructs ΔbHLH, Δb, ΔHLH, ΔH1, ΔH2, ΔAB, ΔA, and ΔB had the indicated segments excised precisely by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Since the boundaries for the Ahr basic region have not been fully defined, due to the lack of consensus with other bHLH proteins, we designed boundaries for this region according to alignments made with other bHLH proteins and also as indicated by previous investigators (14Ema M.

A. 1992; 89: 8185-8189Google Scholar) Sequence alignment of the PAS regions of Arnt, Ahr, Per, and Sim shows that these regions are most similar over the A and B repeats and immediately flanking sequences(15Burbach K.M. Poland A. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8185-8189Google Scholar, 26Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.-F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Google Scholar). The boundaries for the PAS A and PAS B deletions were chosen so as to eliminate these most conserved regions. ΔC lacks C-terminal amino acids 398-805. All constructs were inserted into the expression vector pcDNAI/Neo for in vitro and in vivo expression. Two independent clones were isolated and analyzed for each mutation. The mutant constructs were synthesized in vitro in the transcription-translation system and then analyzed for binding to the photoaffinity ligand 2-azido-3-[125I]iodo-7,8-dibromodibenzo-ρ-dioxin. A representative ligand binding assay is presented in Fig. 2. Hepa-1 cytosolic extract (first lane) and in vitro synthesized Ahr (second lane) both generated strongly labeled bands migrating in the correct position (~95 kDa) for Ahr. Furthermore, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled TCDD eliminated this band in the in vitro extract, confirming that it corresponds to Ahr (third lane). The deletion of the entire bHLH domain or segments thereof (Δb,ΔH1,ΔH2) did not affect ligand binding. Similarly, deletion of amino acids 398-805 (ΔC) resulted in a protein that maintained full ligand binding capacity. Thus, deletions outside the PAS domains had no effect on ligand binding. Deletion of the PAS A domain reduced ligand binding to 30% of that of full-length Ahr. The PAS B deletion completely abolished binding, as did deletion of the complete PAS AB region (ΔAB). The results of two independent experiments are summarized in Table 1.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Treatment with TCDD in vivo causes dissociation of Ahr from HSP90. McGuire and co-workers (9McGuire J. Whitelaw M.L. Pongratz I. Gustafsson J.-A. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2438-2446Google Scholar) demonstrated that Ahr synthesized in reticulocyte lysate associates with HSP90 that is present in the lysate. However, they did not find any effect of TCDD on the amount of Ahr that complexed with HSP90. Additional studies suggested that Arnt is required for TCDD-dependent dissociation of Ahr from HSP90. We synthesized Ahr in the presence of [35S]methionine in a coupled T7 transcription-reticulocyte lysate translation system. Binding of HSP90 to Ahr was then assayed by co-immunoprecipitating the 35S-labeled Ahr with a monoclonal antibody to HSP90 under conditions in which the antibody was limiting. We observed association of Ahr with HSP90, but in contrast to the observations of McGuire and co-workers, found that TCDD treatment reduced the amount of Ahr associated with HSP90. We also investigated whether the addition of in vitro synthesized Arnt and/or an XRE-containing double-stranded oligonucleotide enhanced the effect of TCDD. A representative experiment is presented in Fig. 3A. A slight effect of Arnt in increasing the dissociation of HSP90 from Ahr was observed. (The ratios of the amount of HSP90 co-immunoprecipitated in the TCDD-treated mixture relative to the corresponding nontreated mixture were 0.59 ± 0.03, 0.46 ± 0.15, 0.57 ± 0.14, and 0.43 ± 0.08 for the mixtures with no additions (equivalent to lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 3A), with added Arnt, with added XRE, and with added Arnt plus XRE, respectively. (The means and standard deviations are given for four separate experiments. The mean value for the ratio obtained with Arnt plus XRE is significantly different (p < 0.05) from that of the mixture with no additions.) The mean and standard deviation for the pooled values for the control mixtures and the mixtures to which the XRE was added are 0.58 ± 0.09 and differ significantly (p < 0.05) from the mean for the pooled values of the mixtures containing Arnt and the mixtures containing Arnt plus the XRE (0.44 ± 0.11). We were unable to detect Arnt in the reticulocyte lysate by Western blot analysis (data not shown) and estimate that the concentration of Ahr in the lysate after in vitro translation of the corresponding cDNA is at least 100-fold greater than the concentration of Arnt. Our experiments therefore indicate that TCDD-dependent dissociation of Ahr from HSP90 does not require Arnt and are therefore at variance with the conclusions of McGuire and co-workers. However our experiments do indicate that Arnt may enhance the dissociation of Ahr from HSP90. This effect could conceivably result from Arnt sequestering Ahr and preventing the latter's reassociation with HSP90. We also analyzed the binding of certain Ahr mutants with HSP90. The results of a representative experiment are presented in Fig. 3B. The degree of HSP90 binding to each Ahr derivative was determined by quantitative radioanalytic imaging (referred to as β-scanning). The value for each mutant relative to that for full-length Ahr in the same experiment was calculated, and the mean values for four experiments are presented in Table 1. ΔA bound HSP90 at undiminished efficiency. ΔbHLH and ΔB each bound HSP90 at approximately 50% efficiency. ΔAB did not bind HSP90. HSP90 was not precipitated by the control monoclonal antibody from any incubation. Equimolar amounts of in vitro synthesized and unlabeled full-length or mutant Ahr proteins were mixed with a 3-fold excess of [35S]methionine-labeled full-length Arnt protein in the presence or absence of 10 nM TCDD and incubated at room temperature for 2 h to allow for heterodimerization. The mixtures were then incubated with an excess of affinity-purified antibodies prepared against amino acids 12-31 of Ahr (13Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Agbunag R.V. Ong M.S. Hankinson O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 511-518Google Scholar). (Although the deletions in Δb and ΔbHLH overlap the segment to which the antibodies were raised, these two proteins were immunoprecipitated at the same efficiency as full-length Ahr (data not shown).) The resulting immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the amount, in each case, of the co-immunoprecipitated Arnt protein was determined by β-scanning. The value for each construct was calculated as a percentage of the amount of Arnt co-immunoprecipitated by full-length Ahr in the same experiment. The average values for all experiments are presented in Table 1. The results of a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 4. The first six lanes of Fig. 4 represent the controls for the co-immunoprecipitation assay and utilized full-length Ahr and Arnt incubated in the absence or presence of TCDD, and treated with preimmune IgG or Ahr antibodies, as indicated. The data demonstrate that TCDD treatment increased the amount of Arnt co-immunoprecipitated with Ahr and that very little Arnt was precipitated from the co-incubation mixture upon treatment with the preimmune IgG preparation. Deletion of the complete helix region or individual helices (ΔbHLH, ΔHLH, ΔH1, and ΔH2) resulted in proteins with greatly reduced or nondetectable ability to co-immunoprecipitate with Arnt, demonstrating a requirement for both H1 and H2 for dimerization. Deletion of the complete PAS domain (ΔAB) or either PAS A (ΔA) or PAS B (ΔB), also resulted in proteins lacking the ability to dimerize with Arnt. The dimerization activity of ΔA was much lower than its ligand binding activity, suggesting that the PAS A region may contribute toward dimerization. However, an alternative explanation is that the PAS A region is not directly involved in dimerization and that ΔA cannot dimerize because the HLH and PAS B regions of the ΔA derivative of Ahr and full-length Arnt cannot properly align (as discussed"

Nevertheless, DEM treatment induced expression of WAF1/CIP1 but not GADD45 mRNA. The fact that N-acetylcysteine, a precursor of GSH that blocks oxidative stress, prevented WAF1/CIP1 induction by DEM suggests that WAF1/CIP1 induction probably was a consequence of the ability of DEM to reduce intracellular GSH levels. DEM induced WAF1/CIP1 expression in Saos-2 and T98G cells, both of which lack functional p53 protein. DEM treatment did not produce an increase in membrane-associated protein kinase C, but ERK2, a mitogen-activated protein kinase, was phosphorylated in a manner consistent with ERK2 activation. DEM treatment also produced a dose-dependent delay in cell cycle progression, which at low concentrations (0.25 mM) consisted of a G2/M arrest and at higher concentrations (1 mM) also involved G1 and S phase delays.

We have previously reported the characteristics of the high affinity Na+/glucose cotransporter SGLT1 from rabbit, rat, and human kidney and the low affinity Na+/glucose cotransporter SGLT2 from human kidney. Because the molecular identity of SGLT2 as the kidney cortical low affinity Na+/glucose cotransporter has been recently challenged based on studies of the porcine low affinity Na+/glucose cotransporter SAAT-pSGLT2 (Mackenzie, B., Panayotova-Heiermann, M., Loo, D.

We furthermore report new data on the regulation of SGLT1 and SGLT2 during kidney development. To analyze and compare SGLT1 and SGLT2 in adult and embryonic kidney, we have cloned and characterized SGLT2 from rat kidney and determined its tissue distribution based on Northern analysis and in situ hybridization. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, rat SGLT2 stimulated transport of α-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (2 mM) in oocytes up to 4.5-fold over controls with an apparent Km of 3.0 mM. The transport properties (i.e. a Na+ to glucose coupling of 1:1 and lack of galactose transport) generally matched those of the kidney cortical low affinity system. We show that expression of rat SGLT2 mRNA is kidney specific and that it is strongly and exclusively expressed in proximal tubule S1 segments. Hybrid-depletion studies were performed to conclusively determine whether SGLT2 corresponds to the kidney cortical low affinity system. Injection of rat kidney superficial cortex mRNA into oocytes stimulated the uptake of α-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (2 mM) 2-3-fold. We show that hybrid depletion of this kidney RNA using an SGLT2 antisense oligonucleotide completely suppresses the uptake. These data strongly indicate that SGLT2 is the major kidney cortical low affinity glucose transporter. We therefore propose that SAAT-pSGLT2 be renamed SGLT3.

Giardia lamblia is one of the most common protozoan parasites of man and other vertebrates. Giardia exists in two developmental forms, trophozoites and cysts. Trophozoites, the motile dividing stage, inhabit the upper small intestine and are responsible for the epidemic and endemic diarrhea caused by this organism. Cysts, the infective form of the parasite, develop in the intestine and are excreted in the feces. Cyst formation, or encystation, is essential for the survival of Giardia outside the host intestine and for the transmission of the parasite among susceptible hosts (reviewed in (1Adam R.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 706-732Google Scholar) and (2Thompson R.C.A. Reynoldson J.A. Mendis A.H.W. Adv. Parasitol. 1993; 32: 71-160Google Scholar)).

Nakamura F. Shirakura T. Adachi J. Goto N. Okamoto K. Hasegawa M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 65-71Google Scholar), and encystation may represent an adaptive response that eukaryotes developed early in evolution to survive harmful conditions. Encystation ultimately results in the assembly of a protective cyst wall, which confers resistance to environmental factors, including hypotonic lysis(1Adam R.D. Microbiol.

Luján H.D. Cotten D.B. Bowers B. Yee J. Nash T.E. Stibbs H.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 955-963Google Scholar). The gene CWP1 predicts an acidic and leucine-rich protein of Mr 26,000 likely targeted to the secretory pathway by an amino-terminal signal peptide. The accumulation of CWP1 in a disulfide-linked form in encysting trophozoites and its five tandemly arrayed 24-residue leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) suggest that this protein is a constituent of the fibrillar component of the cyst wall(6Mowatt M.R. Luján H.D. Cotten D.B. Bowers B. Yee J. Nash T.E. Stibbs H.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 955-963Google Scholar).

Ultimately, the understanding of these processes will also facilitate the design of new therapeutic agents against this important human pathogen. In this work, we show that two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), generated against purified encystation-specific secretory vesicles and purified cyst walls, recognize a novel cyst wall protein, CWP2, which contains five tandem copies of a LRR. Expression of both CWP2 and CWP1 is induced coordinately during encystation. Soon after their synthesis, the two proteins form a stable complex and colocalize in the ESVs before release to form the cyst wall. Implications of the structure of these proteins in the biogenesis of secretory granules and in the formation of the cyst wall are discussed.

Immunol. 1988; 141: 636-641Google Scholar), were cultured in TYI-S-33 medium supplemented with 10% adult bovine serum and 0.5 mg/ml bovine bile (growth medium) as described(32Keister D.B. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1983; 77: 487-488Google Scholar). Encystation of trophozoite monolayers was accomplished by the method described by Boucher and Gillin(33Boucher S.M. Gillin F.D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3516-3522Google Scholar). To purify ESVs, Giardia trophozoites were induced to encyst, harvested, homogenized, and fractionated as reported (18Luján H.D. Marotta A. Mowatt M.R. Sciaky N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4612-4618Google Scholar). After the primary isopycnic centrifugation of the homogenate, approximately 17 fractions (400 μl each) were collected from the bottom of the gradient(18Luján H.D. Marotta A. Mowatt M.R. Sciaky N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4612-4618Google Scholar). To detect ESVs in the sucrose gradient, a 20-μl aliquot from each fraction was analyzed by immunoblotting using the mAb 5-3C(34Stibbs H.H. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1989; 27: 2582-2588Google Scholar), which is specific for CWP1(6Mowatt M.R. Luján H.D. Cotten D.B. Bowers B. Yee J. Nash T.E. Stibbs H.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 955-963Google Scholar). Fractions containing CWP1 were pooled and washed with 13 ml of 0.25 M sucrose containing 10 mM sodium phosphate by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman type 40 rotor. ESV pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 0.25 M sucrose in phosphate and loaded on a preformed Percoll gradient consisting of 1 ml each of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45% of a Percoll stock solution (90% Percoll in 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM sodium phosphate). The gradient was centrifuged for 2 h in a Beckman SW 40 rotor at 20,000 × g at 4°C; 1-ml fractions were then collected from the bottom, washed, and analyzed as described above. The fractions containing ESVs were pooled, processed for electron microscopy as described below (Fig. 1A), and assayed for malate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, and acid phosphatase activities (18Luján H.D. Marotta A. Mowatt M.R. Sciaky N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4612-4618Google Scholar) as measurement of contamination. The preparation of ESVs appeared approximately 80% pure by these biochemical criteria (results not shown) To purify cyst walls, Giardia cysts generated in vitro were collected from the supernatant medium of cells cultured for 3 days in encystation medium by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. Cells were washed twice with PBS, treated with distilled water for 12 h at 4°C, and then centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The pellet, resuspended in 5 ml of water, was then layered atop 10 ml of 1 M sucrose and centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The material obtained from the water phase was centrifuged and the pellet frozen-thawed 10 times, centrifuged again, and the resulting pellet resuspended in 5 ml of water. The suspension was sonicated 50 times (30 s, 20 A, in a Tekmar Sonic Disruptor, at 4°C), loaded on top of 10 ml of 0.5 M sucrose, and centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Unbroken cysts and debris remained in the pellet while purified cyst walls were obtained from the supernatant (Fig. 1C). Six-week-old female BALB/c mice (National Institutes of Health Frederick Cancer Research Facility) were immunized subcutaneously with either 200 μg of a purified preparation of ESVs or cyst walls emulsified in Ribi adjuvant system (Ribi Immunochem Research, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. Mice were boosted subcutaneously after 21 days with 200 μg of the same preparation, and 20 days later boosted intravenously with 100 μg of the antigen preparation. Three days later, the mice were euthanized and the spleen cells used for fusion to SP2/0 myeloma cells. Hybridomas secreting antibodies were screened by indirect immunofluorescence (6Mowatt M.R. Luján H.D. Cotten D.B. Bowers B. Yee J. Nash T.E. Stibbs H.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 955-963Google Scholar, 18Luján H.D. Marotta A. Mowatt M.R. Sciaky N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4612-4618Google Scholar) with nonencysting trophozoites, encysting trophozoites, and in vitro derived Giardia cysts. Selected hybridomas were cloned by limiting dilution. Ascites were generated as described(35McKearn T.J. Kennett R.H. McKearn T.J. Bechtol K.B. Monoclonal Antibodies Hybridomas: A New Dimension in Biological Analysis. Plenum Press, New York1980: 368-369Google Scholar, 36Hoogenraad N.L. Wraight C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 121: 375-381Google Scholar), cleared by centrifugation at 4000 × g, 15 min, filter-sterilized using 0.45-μm pore size filters, and saved at -70°C. The mAb isotype and light chain composition were determined by the mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping kit (dipstick format) from Life Technologies, Inc. For immunofluorescence analysis, cells cultured in either growth medium, pre-encystation medium, or encystation medium were harvested and processed as described previously(18Luján H.D. Marotta A. Mowatt M.R. Sciaky N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4612-4618Google Scholar). Slides were then incubated for 1 h with both fluorescein conjugated mAb 5-3C (34Stibbs H.H. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1989; 27: 2582-2588Google Scholar) and rhodamine-conjugated mAb 7D2 (IgG1) and washed as described above. mAbs were purified from ascites (37Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 298-299Google Scholar) and labeled directly as reported(38Amante L. Ancona A. Forni L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1972; 1: 289-301Google Scholar). The specimens were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and viewed on Bio-Rad laser scanning confocal microscope. Immunoblot analyses were done essentially as described(6Mowatt M.R. Luján H.D. Cotten D.B. Bowers B. Yee J. Nash T.E. Stibbs H.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 955-963Google Scholar, 18Luján H.D. Marotta A. Mowatt M.R. Sciaky N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4612-4618Google Scholar). Encysting G. lamblia were fixed by dilution of the encystation medium with an equal volume of 5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. Fixation, post-fixation, embedding in LRWhite (London Resin Co. Ltd.) were performed as reported(6Mowatt M.R. Luján H.D. Cotten D.B. Bowers B. Yee J. Nash T.E. Stibbs H.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 955-963Google Scholar). Thin sections on nickel grids were blocked for 1 h in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (BSA/PBS) and then incubated for 2 h in a 1:1000 dilution of mAb 7D2 ascites in BSA/PBS followed by a thorough rinse in PBS. Sections were then incubated for 1 h in goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to 10-nm gold particles (BioCell, Ted Pella) and rinsed in PBS and distilled water. The grids were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and carbon-coated before examination. Controls omitting the primary antibody or using purified nonimmune mouse IgG1 (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) as the primary antibody showed no label. Trophozoite monolayers in 15-ml glass tubes (approximately 15 × 108 cells) were induced to encyst as described above. After 24 h in complete encystation medium, cells were preincubated for 15 min in encystation labeling medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine pH 7.8, 10% dialyzed calf serum, 0.5 mML-cysteine, 20 μg/ml bathocuproine sulfonate, 5 mM lactic acid hemi-calcium salt, and porcine bile 0.25 mg/ml) before the addition of [35S]methionine (Trans35S-label, ICN) at a concentration of 250 μCi/ml, and pulse labeled for 5 min at 37°C. Next, labeling medium was decanted and the attached trophozoites washed twice with prewarmed complete encystation medium containing 2 mM of cold methionine. Tubes were chilled on ice for 15 min and the trophozoites collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. Cells were washed twice in PBS and then lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml E64, 5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM) Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone for 1 h at 4°C. Lysates were sedimented at 16,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant precleared in the presence of Protein G Plus-agarose beads (Oncogene) only. Subsequent nonimmune or immune precipitations were performed for 2 h at 4°C using 50 μl of mAb-protein G beads complexes (50% suspension in lysis buffer) per 100 μl of cell lysate. Under these conditions, the efficiency of the immunoprecipitation was always greater that 80%, as judged by sequential precipitations. In some experiments, sequential immunoprecipitations were performed to determine the composition of the complexes obtained in the primary precipitation. Immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and solubilized in electrophoresis sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 4-20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad) under reducing conditions. Gels were fixed in 7.5% acetic acid, 20% methanol for 15 min, soaked in Enlightning (DuPont NEN) for 30 min, dried, and analyzed by fluorography. Nucleic acids were extracted and analyzed by standard methods as described previously(6Mowatt M.R. Luján H.D. Cotten D.B. Bowers B. Yee J. Nash T.E. Stibbs H.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 955-963Google Scholar). Polyadenylated RNA was purified from total cellular RNA with the PolyATtract® mRNA isolation system (Promega Corp.). 32P-End-labeled antisense oligonucleotides oMM133 (CWP2 nts 213 through 194; GenBank(TM) U28965), oMM103 (G. lamblia CWP1 nts 272 through 253, GenBank(TM) U09330), oMM79 (G. lamblia triose-phosphate isomerase nts 289 through 270, GenBank(TM) L02120), and GDH9B (G. lamblia glutamate dehydrogenase nts 1080 through 1061, GenBank(TM) M84604) were used in RNA hybridization studies. A cDNA expression library was constructed in λgt22A using polyadenylated RNA from encysting Giardia trophozoites. SuperScript II reverse transcriptase was used to perform first strand cDNA synthesis by extension of an oligo(dT) primer modified to allow directional cloning of cDNA in the bacteriophage vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). Approximately 400,000 recombinant plaques from the amplified library were screened with mAb 7D2. Positive plaques were purified to homogeneity, and reactivities of the β-galactosidase fusion proteins were verified by immunoblotting against mAb 7D2 and isotype-matched mAbs of different specificity, including the CWP1-specific mAb 5-3C (6Mowatt M.R. Luján H.D. Cotten D.B. Bowers B. Yee J. Nash T.E. Stibbs H.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 955-963Google Scholar). The cDNA insert from one clone, λc122, was amplified using Taq polymerase and primers that flank the cloning site of λgt22A; the product was partially sequenced (see below) and cloned in pGEM-T (Promega Corp.) to yield the plasmid pMM100. The agarose gel-purified insert of pMM100 was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by extension of random hexamers (39Feinberg A. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 132: 6-12Google Scholar) and used to screen a WB/1267 Sau3AI partial genomic library constructed in λFIXII(40Mowatt M.R. Aggarwal A. Nash T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 49: 215-228Google Scholar). A 3.8-kilobase pair BamHI fragment from genomic clone λC8 was subcloned in pGEM-4 (Promega) to yield plasmid pMM109. DNA sequences were determined from double-stranded recombinant plasmid templates using Sequenase version 2.0 and from amplified DNA using the Sequenase PCR product sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequences were generated from pMM109 and pMM100 by “primer walking” on both strands using oligonucleotides designed from the newly derived sequences and made on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer model 392. The identity of each reported nucleotide was determined at least twice on each strand. DNA Strider 1.2(41Marck C.

Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar), and programs in the GCG package (44Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Google Scholar) running on the National Institutes of Health Convex System were used to analyze and format the data. To study the components of the Giardia cyst wall, as well as other secretory granule molecules expressed during encystation, we developed mAbs to these organelles. Since the purification of neither encystation-specific secretory vesicles nor cyst walls had been reported previously, we first developed methods to purify these structures (Fig. 1, A and C). Subsequently, we used these materials as immunogens to produce mAbs in mice. Among the mAbs tested in indirect immunofluorescence assays, seven demonstrated comparable reactivity with cysts produced in vitro or derived from infected gerbils. 2H. D. Luján, unpublished results. Immunoblotting revealed that mAb 7D2 (generated against cyst walls) and mAb 8G8 (generated against ESVs) bind the same antigen, the expression of which is induced during encystation; however, this antigen is distinct from CWP1 (see below). Because mAb 7D2 exhibited greater affinity for the reduced and denatured form of the protein than did 8G8, we decided to use 7D2 for further detailed analysis of its corresponding antigen, which we called CWP2. Immunoblot analysis performed on the samples used for the immunizations showed that mAb 7D2 recognizes CWP2 as a single ~26-kDa band in purified cyst walls (Fig. 1D), but reacts with bands of ~26 and ~39 kDa in the purified ESV preparation (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that a ~13-kDa fragment is removed from the 39-kDa CWP2 precursor before, and/or during, its incorporation into the cyst wall. To confirm the reactivity of mAb 7D2 with the Giardia cyst wall and to establish the subcellular location of CWP2 in encysting trophozoites, we performed immunoelectron microscopic analysis. CWP2 is concentrated in the ESVs of encysting trophozoites (Fig. 2, a and c) prior to its incorporation into the cyst wall (Fig. 2b). No labeling of encysting trophozoites or cysts was observed if nonspecific mouse IgG1 was used in place of mAb 7D2. Our previous observation that CWP1 is concentrated in the ESVs prompted us to determine whether CWP1 and CWP2 were present in the same ESVs of encysting trophozoites. To address this issue, we performed laser scanning confocal immunofluorescence microscopy on encysting trophozoites labeled simultaneously with rhodamine-conjugated mAb 7D2 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mAb 5-3C. This analysis showed that CWP1 and CWP2 consistently colocalize within the ESVs of encysting trophozoites and to the cyst wall of in vitro derived cysts (results not shown). We studied the kinetics of CWP2 expression during encystation by immunoblot analysis of total trophozoite proteins. Under reducing conditions, mAb 7D2 detected CWP2 as an antigen of ~39 kDa, the expression of which is strongly induced during encystation with kinetics identical to those exhibited by CWP1 (Fig. 3, compare left panels). Like mAb 5-3C, which detected antigens of ~35 and ~23 kDa in addition to the 26-kDa CWP1 late in encystation, mAb 7D2 detected ~26- and ~23-kDa species, as well as the predominant ~39-kDa CWP2, late in encystation if samples were reduced before electrophoresis (Fig. 3, left panels). Under nonreducing conditions, both mAbs detected a ~65-kDa species that was expressed during encystation with kinetics identical to the reduced antigens (Fig. 3, compare left and right panels). We consistently observed smearing above the ~65-kDa antigen(s) detected by the two different mAbs (Fig. 3, right panels). The ability of CWP1 and CWP2 to form disulfide bonds (Fig. 3) and their colocalization in the ESVs and the cyst wall prompted us to investigate the possibility that the ~65-kDa species observed in immunoblots of nonreduced encysting trophozoite proteins represents a complex of the two cyst wall proteins. We addressed this issue by immunoprecipitation analysis of encysting trophozoites labeled for 5 min with [35S]methionine. Cells were harvested and extracts for precipitation were prepared immediately after the 5-min pulse labeling reaction. In contrast to their clearly distinguishable patterns of reactivity in immunoblots, mAbs 5-3C and 7D2 exhibited identical immunoprecipitation profiles: ~26 and ~39 kDa (Fig. 4, lanes A and B, respectively). Control precipitations employing isotype-matched unrelated mAbs showed no precipitation (results not shown). When supernatants from the precipitations shown in lanes A and B of Fig. 4 were subsequently precipitated with the opposite mAb, the same two bands were detected, but at significantly reduced levels (Fig. 4, lanes C and D). Because mAb 5-3C does not bind recombinant CWP2 and, likewise, mAb 7D2 does not bind recombinant CWP1 (results not shown), these data indicate that CWP1 and CWP2 form a stable complex with each other within 5 min of their synthesis. We used mAb 7D2 to screen a cDNA expression library prepared from encysting trophozoite mRNA. Two identical clones were selected that contained inserts of approximately 1200 base pairs, one of which was completely sequenced. The reading frame of the cDNA fragment was coincident with the β-galactosidase gene of the expression vector. In addition, immunoblotting of crude preparations of the recombinant protein verified its reactivity with mAb 7D2 and established"
https://openalex.org/W2088828185,"A protocol has been developed for the purification of the cytochrome b6f complex from the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. It is based on the use of the neutral detergent Hecameg (6-O-(N-heptylcarbamoyl)-methyl-α-D-glycopyranoside) and comprises only three steps: selective solubilization from thylakoid membranes, sucrose gradient sedimentation, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. The purified complex contains two b hemes (α bands, 564 nm; Em,8 = -84 and -158 mV) and one chlorophyll a (λmax = 667-668 nm) per cytochrome f (α band, 554 nm; Em,8 = +330 mV). It is highly active in transferring electrons from decylplastoquinol to oxidized plastocyanin (turnover number 250-300 s-1). The purified complex contains seven subunits, whose identity has been established by N-terminal sequencing and/or peptide-specific immunolabeling, namely four high molecular weight subunits (cytochrome f, Rieske iron-sulfur protein, cytochrome b6, and subunit IV) and three ∼4-kDa miniproteins (PetG, PetL, and PetX). Stoichiometry measurements are consistent with every subunit being present as two copies per b6f dimer.

Stoichiometry measurements are consistent with every subunit being present as two copies per b6f dimer. The photosynthetic electron transfer chain, the device that provides essentially all of the free energy dissipated by living beings, comprises two membrane protein complexes that are homologous to complexes of the respiratory chain, the CF1CF0 (respectively, F1F0) proton ATP-synthase and the b6f (respectively, bc1) oxidoreductase. The bf/bc complexes transfer electrons from a liposoluble quinol to a hydrosoluble protein, plastocyanin or cytochrome c, and couple the resulting electron free energy drop to setting up a transmembrane proton electrochemical potential. Neither the structure of the b6f nor that of the bc1 complex is known in any detail, and the existence of an unique versus alternative mechanism(s) of electron transfer remains a matter of discussion (see, e.g., (1Hope A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 1-22Google Scholar, 2Trumpower B.L. Gennis R.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Google Scholar, 3Joliot P. Joliot A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Most structural studies of the b6f complex to date have been carried out either on higher plants or on cyanobacteria (for reviews, see Refs. 1, 2, and 5-8). Unicellular algae, such as Chlorella sorokiniana and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, have long been recognized as convenient organisms for combined spectroscopic, biochemical and genetic studies of the b6f complex structure and function (9Lavergne J. Delosme R. Larsen U. Bennoun P. Photobiochem. Photobiophys. 1984; 8: 207-219Google Scholar, 10Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. 1st Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1989Google Scholar). In the present article, we describe the purification of the b6f complex from C. reinhardtii. From the point of view of the experimentalist, C. reinhardtii combines a number of advantages: (i) cell suspensions are amenable to in vivo studies of the electron transfer and proton pumping processes using spectroscopic and other biophysical approaches; (ii) C. reinhardtii being a facultative phototroph, mutant strains with defective photosynthetic complexes can be generated and maintained; (iii) large fractions of its chloroplast genome have been sequenced; (iv) techniques for modification of its chloroplast and nuclear genes are being developed; (v) it is amenable to in vivo isotopic labeling; (vi) large scale growth, although not currently resorted to, is not an unrealistic objective (for a general review of C. reinhardtii laboratory use, see (10Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. 1st Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1989Google Scholar)). Previous studies have shown that the b6f complex from C. reinhardtii is similar to that of higher plants in its complement of high molecular mass subunits(11Lemaire C. Girard-Bascou J. Wollman F.-A. Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 229-238Google Scholar, 12Wynn R.M. Bertsch J. Bruce B.D. Malkin R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 935: 115-122Google Scholar). It comprises two heme-bearing subunits (cytochrome f and cytochrome b6), a protein carrying a [2Fe-2S] cluster (the so-called Rieske protein), and an integral protein devoid of prosthetic group (“subunit IV”) that is homologous to the C-terminal region of mitochondrial cytochrome b(13Heinemeyer W. Alt J. Herrmann R.G. Curr. Genet. 1984; 8: 543-549Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown that additional, very small subunits (∼4 kDa) are also present, namely: 1) the product of the petG chloroplast gene, initially identified in higher plants (14Haley J. Bogorad L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1534-1538Google Scholar, 15Schmidt C.L. Malkin R. Photosynth.

Obtaining large scale preparations of active integral membrane proteins is a major stumbling block in understanding the function of these proteins at the structural level. Two limitations are the amount of protein produced by laboratory organisms and scale limits on purification procedures. Until now, preparations of b6f complex from C. reinhardtii(11Lemaire C.

At variance with previous b6f purification protocols, the new procedure does not resort at any step to an electrically charged detergent, and it is easily amenable to scaling up: two favorable factors for growing crystals.

TMK buffer consisted of 20 mM Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 3 mM MgCl2, 3 mM KCl. C. reinhardtii DUM-1 strain (lacking the mitochondrial bc1 complex; see (21Matagne R.F. Michel-Wolwertz M.-R. Munaut C.

Matagne. Wild-type strain (WT12-) and mutant strains FuD4 (lacking the b6f complex; (11Lemaire C. Girard-Bascou J. Wollman F.-A. Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 229-238Google Scholar)) and DUM-1/BF4 (small antenna, no bc1) came from our laboratory collection and were kindly provided by Dr. J. Girard-Bascou. C. reinhardtii cells were grown in Tris acetate-phosphate medium (TAP; (23Gorman D.S. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1665-1669Google Scholar)) at 25°C under an illumination of 300-400 Lux on a rotary shaker until they reached stationary phase (about 107 cells/ml). For stationary labeling experiments, [14C1]acetate was added in TAP medium at a final concentration of 37 kBq/ml at the beginning of cell culture. Cells were harvested at 5000 × g for 10 min, and thylakoid membranes prepared as described previously (22Atteia A. de Vitry C. Pierre Y. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 226-234Google Scholar, 24Chua N.H. Bennoun P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2175-2179Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes were finally resuspended in 10 mM Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, containing protease inhibitors (200 μM PMSF, 1 mM benzamidine, 5 mM ε-aminocaproic acid) at a final chlorophyll concentration of 3 g/liter and stored at -80°C. Wild-type cells were grown in TAP medium under standard conditions until stationary phase, diluted ∼10-fold in 2 l of TAP medium containing 1/10 of the usual non-radioactive phosphate concentration and 37 MBq of sodium [32P]phosphate, and further grown under the same conditions until stationary phase. Cells grown under such conditions are in a state intermediate between State 1 and State 2 (see ref. 25). 3F. A. Wollman, personal communication. Cells were harvested, thylakoid membranes prepared, and the b6f complex purified as described for unlabeled preparations, except that all buffers contained 20 mM EGTA-NaOH, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaF, and 1 μM microcystin (26MacKintosh C. Beattie K.A. Klumpp S. Cohen P. Codd G.A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 187-192Google Scholar) as phosphatase inhibitors. In addition, the buffer in which the cells were broken contained 0.1 μM okadaic acid(27Takai A. Bialojan C. Troschka M. Rüegg J.C. FEBS Lett. 1987; 217: 81-84Google Scholar). Plastocyanin was prepared according to (28Anderson M.M. McCarty R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 189: 193-206Google Scholar) from fresh spinach leaves obtained from the local market. Subunit-specific antisera were raised against synthetic peptides as described previously (16Pierre Y. Popot J.-L. C. R. Acad. Sci. Ser. III. 1993; 316: 1404-1409Google Scholar). All peptides that yielded active antisera were either N- or C-terminal and were coupled to ovalbumin by their extremity internal to the protein (indicated below by an asterisk), one extra residue being generally added to permit coupling (cytochrome f, YPVFAQQNYANPREK* and *YKKK QFEKVQLAEMNF; Rieske protein, AAASSEVPDMNKRNY*; cytochrome b6, SKVYDWFEERLEIQC* and *YLMIRKQGISGPL; subunit IV, SVTKKPDLSDPVLKY* and *KGSTFPIDISLTLGLF; PetG, *VTAYLQYLRGDLATY; PetL, *CTLGIYLGLLKVVKLI; PetX, GEAE FIAGTALTMY*. Polypeptide composition was analyzed either on 12-18% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea (29Piccioni R.G. Bennoun P. Chua N.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 93-102Google Scholar) or on three-step gels in the absence of urea(30Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar). Heme staining was performed as in (31Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Google Scholar) and silver staining as in (32Rabilloud T. Carpentier G. Tarroux P. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 288-291Google Scholar). 14C- or 32P-labeled polypeptides were detected either by autoradiography of dried gels on Agfa Curix MR4 films or using PhosphorImager plates (Molecular Dynamics). Proteins were electrotransferred onto Immobilon PVDF membranes in a semidry blotting system at 0.8 mA/cm2 for about 30 min. Immunodetection was carried out either by the enhanced chemiluminescence peroxidase method (Amersham) or by labeling with 125I-protein A, as described previously(33Breyton C. de Vitry C. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7597-7602Google Scholar). Polypeptide purification by SDS-PAGE and transfer to PVDF membranes were performed as described previously(22Atteia A. de Vitry C. Pierre Y. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 226-234Google Scholar). Amino acid sequencing was carried out at the Service Central d'Analyze du CNRS (Vernaison, France) by L. Denoroy. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method(34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Chlorophyll concentrations were determined according to (35Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Google Scholar). Critical micellar concentrations (CMC) were estimated either by the pyrene partitioning method (36Kalyanasundaram K. Thomas J.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 2039-2044Google Scholar) or by counting drops from a Hamilton syringe with a non-beveled needle. The accuracy of quoted values for HG is probably approximately ±1 mM. UV-visible absorbance spectra were recorded either on a home-built spectrophotometer of the Joliot design(37Joliot P. Béal D. Frilley B. J. Chim. Phys. 1980; 77: 209-216Google Scholar, 38Joliot P. Joliot A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 765: 210-218Google Scholar) or on a Kontron Uvikon 930 instrument. Cytochromes were oxidized with ferricyanide and reduced either with ascorbate (cytochrome f) or with dithionite or borohydride (cytochromes bh and b1). The spectrum of oxidized preparations in the UV-visible region was obtained by recording two spectra, the first one following air equilibration and the second one after ascorbate reduction, and subtracting from the former the ascorbate-minus-air difference spectrum, scaled so as to cancel the α peak of cytochrome f. Wavelengths of absorbance maxima and isosbestic points are rounded off to the nearest nanometer. Spectroscopic scans were made on a home-built Joliot spectrophotometer(39Kramer, D. M., 1990, Parallel Instrumentational Approaches to the Study of the Bioenergetics of Photosynthesis in Chloroplasts and Intact Plants. Ph.D. thesis, University of Illinois, Urbana, Champaign, IL.Google Scholar). The monochromator was set to a 2.0 nm wavelength resolution. Purified b6f complex was diluted to a concentration of 375 nM in deoxygenated TMK buffer containing 0.3 mM LM and the following redox mediators: anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (10 μM), anthraquinone-1,5-disulfonate (10 μM), 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (10 μM), 2-hydroxy-1,5-naphthoquinone (10 μM), 2,5-dihydroxy-p-benzoquinone (10 μM), pyocyanin (4 μM), 1,4-naphthoquinone (10 μM), phenazine ethosulfate (4 μM), duroquinone (10 μM), N-ethylphenazonium phenosulfate (4 μM), trimethyl-p-benzoquinone (10 μM), 1,2-naphthoquinone (10 μM), 2,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone (10 μM), N,N, N′,N′,tetramethyl-p-phenylene diamine (4 μM), and 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-phenylene diamine (4 μM). Redox potentiometric measurements were made with a platinum electrode, using a standard calomel electrode as a reference. The data were corrected to reflect potentials against the standard hydrogen electrode. Redox poising was accomplished by additions of small quantities of concentrated solutions of sodium ferricyanide and sodium hydrosulfite. At least 3 min were allowed for equilibration after each change in ambient redox potential before spectra were scanned. The pH at the end of the titration was checked to insure that no drift had occurred. Spectral changes recorded from -250 to +450 mV were analyzed by taking the peak wavelengths (approximately 564 nm for cytochrome b6 and 554 nm for cytochrome f) and fitting the absorbance values to Nernst curves. Component spectra were obtained by redox cut analysis; the spectrum of cytochrome f was obtained by taking the average of three spectra recorded at 400 ± 10 mV and subtracting the average of four spectra taken at 230 ± 30 mV; the spectrum of cytochrome bh was obtained by subtracting from a spectrum recorded at -80 mV a spectrum recorded at 0 mV; the spectrum of cytochrome b1 was obtained by subtracting from a spectrum taken at -250 mV a spectrum recorded at -132 mV. The ratio of cytochrome b6 to cytochrome f was estimated from the redox titration curves, assuming extinction coefficients of 18,000 M-1•cm-1 (cytochrome f) and 20,000 M-1•cm-1 (average of the two b-type cytochromes) (peak absorbance minus absorbance at isosbestic point; (40Rich P.R. Heathcote P. Moss D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 892: 138-151Google Scholar)). A diethylether solution of decylplastoquinone (C10-PQ) was reduced to decylplastoquinol (C10-PQH2) by an aqueous solution of sodium dithionite and sodium borohydride with strong agitation in the dark until the solution became colorless (see (41Barr R. Crane F.L. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 372-408Google Scholar)). A small volume of chlorhydric acid was then added to eliminate the sodium borohydride in excess. The diethylether phase was collected and evaporated to dryness under N2, and the C10-PQH2 resuspended in 100% ethanol acidified with chlorhydric acid. C10-PQH2 concentration was estimated from the absorption value at 290 nm using an extinction coefficient ε290 = 3,540 M-1•cm-1(42Dawson R.M.C. Elliot D.C. Elliot W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. Clarendon Press, Oxford1986: 132Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 4°C; all buffers contained 200 μM PMSF, 1 mM benzamidine, and 5 mM ε-aminocaproic acid as protease inhibitors. For selective solubilization, thylakoid membranes of wild type cells were resuspended in ice-cold TMK buffer containing 25 mM HG at a chlorophyll concentration of 1.5 g/liter and incubated at 4°C for 15 min. with occasional agitation. The suspension was centrifuged either at 160,000 × g (80,000 rpm) for 10 min in the TLA 100.3 rotor of a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge, or at 200,000 × g (43,000 rpm) for 30 min in the 70 Ti rotor of a Beckman L8 ultracentrifuge, depending on the volume (6 or 30 ml). The solubilization supernatant was fractionated by centrifugation in 10-30% (w/w) sucrose density gradients in TMK buffer containing 20 mM HG and 0.1 g/liter egg PC. The presence of egg PC during this and the following step of purification is necessary to prevent the dissociation of the Rieske protein from the complex(43Breyton C. Tribet C. Olive J. Recouvreur M. Popot J.-L. Mathis P. Proceedings of the Xth International Photosynthesis Congress. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995Google Scholar). The gradients, onto which were layered ∼600 μl (Beckman SW41 Ti rotor) or ∼3 ml (45 Ti rotor) of supernatant, were centrifuged at 270,000 × g (40,000 rpm) for 24 h (SW41 Ti rotor), or at 180,000 × g (38,000 rpm) for 16 h (45 Ti rotor). The yellow-brown band containing the cytochrome b6f complex was collected with a syringe. The band collected from the gradient was layered onto a HA column (0.7 cm × 2 cm, or 1 cm × 3 cm) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 20 mM HG, 0.1 g/liter egg PC. The column was washed with 3 column volumes of 100-200 mM ammonium phosphate (depending on HA batches), pH 8.0, containing 20 mM HG and 0.1 g/liter egg PC. Pure cytochrome b6f complex was eluted with 400 mM ammonium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 20 mM HG and 0.1 g/liter egg PC. Typical yields are ∼600 μl of pure b6f complex at ∼6 μM cytochrome f for one SW41 rotor or ∼3 ml at ∼10 μM for one 45 Ti rotor, with larger preparations resulting in better overall yields. Our initial experiments with HG were made somewhat frustrating by irreproducible batch-to-batch results. These appeared to be due to the presence of diheptylurea, a side product from the synthesis. 4W. Klagba, personal communication. In the presence of traces of diheptylurea, abnormal migration of the b6f complex on sucrose gradient was observed, and electron transfer activity was inhibited. The presence of diheptylurea is easily detected by leaving a 20 mM solution of HG in water overnight in the cold room. Diheptylurea precipitates as a fine white powder. This problem has been solved by the manufacturer, and recent HG batches (batches 2001, 2101, WK1-20, and CP1-57) have been free from diheptylurea. From a practical point of view, we note that the CMC of HG is similar at 4°C and at room temperature 5Y. Pierre and J.-L. Popot, unpublished observations. (see also Refs. 44 and 45), but appears to be sensitive to high salt concentrations, since the CMC at 4°C dropped from ∼19.5 mM to ∼15 mM when moving from the low ionic strength TMK buffer to 0.4 M ammonium phosphate (see also (45Ruiz M.B. Prado A. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1193: 301-306Google Scholar)). Cytochrome b6f oxidoreductase activity was measured at room temperature in a Kontron Uvikon 930 spectrophotometer, using 15 μM C10-PQH2 as an electron donor and either 5 μM oxidized cytochrome c or 5 μM oxidized spinach plastocyanin as an acceptor. The reaction was initiated by adding C10-PQH2 to a solution containing 20 mM Tricine-NaOH buffer pH 8.0, 0.3 mM LM, cytochrome b6f (0.5-2 nM), and the electron acceptor. Reduction of horse cytochrome c was monitored during 2 min at room temperature by the absorbance change at 549 nm, assuming an extinction coefficient of 22,000 M-1•cm-1(22Atteia A. de Vitry C. Pierre Y. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 226-234Google Scholar). Reduction of spinach plastocyanin was monitored under the same conditions by the absorbance change at 600 nm, assuming an extinction coefficient of 4,500 M-1•cm-1(46Tan S. Ho K.-K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 111-117Google Scholar). We checked that, under the latter conditions, the rate of electron transfer is independent on the concentration of PQH2 and linearly related to that of plastocyanin. When measuring the oxidoreductase activity of thylakoid membranes or of fractions containing partially purified b6f complex, using cytochrome c as an acceptor, 1 μM antimycin was added to the solution in order to inhibit the oxidoreductase activity of the contaminating bc1 complex(22Atteia A. de Vitry C. Pierre Y. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 226-234Google Scholar). Treatment of thylakoid membrane preparations from C. reinhardtii(22Atteia A. de Vitry C. Pierre Y. Popot J.-L. J. Biol.

A. 1975; 72: 2175-2179Google Scholar) with appropriate concentrations of Hecameg (HG; see “Materials and Methods”) preferentially solubilizes the CF0CF1 ATP synthase and the cytochrome b6f complex, resulting in a ∼3-fold increase of the b6f/protein ratio (Fig. 1, lane 2, and Table 1). Distribution of the b6f complex in this and subsequent fractionation experiments was estimated on the basis of the content in two heme-stainable proteins, migrating upon urea/SDS-PAGE with apparent Mr 39.5 and 18 kDa, which have been recognized previously as the cytochrome f and cytochrome b6 holoproteins, respectively(11Lemaire C. Girard-Bascou J. Wollman F.-A. Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 229-238Google Scholar, 12Wynn R.M. Bertsch J. Bruce B.D. Malkin R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 935: 115-122Google Scholar). Fractionation of the supernatant on a 10-30% sucrose gradient in the presence of HG and lipids revealed that 18.5-, 12.5-, and ∼4-kDa proteins comigrate with the two cytochromes (Fig. 1, lane 3). Further purification on a hydroxylapatite column resulted in a preparation devoid of any other polypeptides (Fig. 1, lane 4). The overall yield of the purification was close to 50%, a 20-liter growth of wild type C. reinhardtii cells yielding 5-7 mg of pure complex.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Handling the complex under delipidating conditions, e.g. sedimenting it in a sucrose gradient containing 25 mM HG in the absence of lipids and salts, resulted in the loss of the Rieske protein and of the oxidoreductase activity(43Breyton C. Tribet C. Olive J. Recouvreur M. Popot J.-L. Mathis P. Proceedings of the Xth International Photosynthesis Congress. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995Google Scholar). Identified stabilizing factors are (i) working close to the CMC of HG and in the presence of lipids (0.01-0.1 g/liter egg PC) and (ii) adding low concentrations of salt (3 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2). The near UV-visible spectrum of a purified b6f preparation is shown in Fig. 2. Absorbance peaks in the Soret, α, and β regions of the spectrum are characteristic of the presence of cytochrome f. Additional bands at ∼460 and 483 nm indicate the presence of carotenoids and a band at 667-668 nm that of chlorophyll a. The molar ratio of chlorophyll a to cytochrome f is close to 1(47Popot J.-L. Pierre Y. Breyton C. Lemoine Y. Takahashi Y. Rochaix J.-D. Mathis P. Proceedings of the Xth International Photosynthesis Congress. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995Google Scholar), as previously observed in Synechocystis PCC6803 (48Bald D. Kruip J. Boekema E.J. Rögner M. Murata N.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4401-4409Google Scholar) b6f preparations. The reason for the presence of non-heme pigments in highly purified C. reinhardtii b6f preparations will be analyzed in more detail elsewhere. Upon addition of ascorbate, the contribution of reduced cytochrome f to the spectrum increases more or less strongly, indicating that, in air-equilibrated preparations, cytochrome f is partially to totally reduced. Further reduction with dithionite or borohydride reveals the presence of cytochrome b6. Difference spectra (Fig. 2, insets A and B) show absorption maxima at 523 and 554 nm for cytochrome f and 534 and 564 nm for cytochrome b6, and isosbestic points in the Soret region at 414 and 420 nm, respectively. Visible absorbance spectra were recorded over the redox potential range from -250 to 450 mV. They were analyzed by fitting the absorbance values at peak wavelengths (approximately 564 nm for cytochrome b6 and 554 nm for cytochrome f) to Nernst curves. A single curve with m = 1 and Em = + 330 mV was sufficient to fit the cytochrome f data (Fig. 3A). Two titration curves with n = 1 and Em = -84 and -158 mV were necessary to fit the cytochrome b6 data (Fig. 3B). Thes"

https://openalex.org/W2060610229,"To investigate the fate of nitric oxide (NO) synthesized by activated macrophages, the concentrations of NO and its principal reaction products, nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-), were measured as a function of time in suspension cultures of RAW264.7 macrophages attached to microcarrier beads. Synthesis of NO became evident 2-5 h after stimulation of the cells, and steady concentrations of NO were achieved after about 9 h. The appearance of NO in the extracellular fluid coincided with the appearance of NO2- and NO3-, which were formed thereafter at approximately equal and constant rates. Using a kinetic model based on rate constants measured previously in cell-free systems, only half of the NO2- formed could be accounted for by the reaction of NO with O2-. It is known that NO reacts with superoxide (O2) to give peroxynitrite and that NO also reacts with peroxynitrite to yield NO2, so that the latter reaction may explain the “excess” NO2 formation. Adding superoxide dismutase to the medium markedly reduced the ratio of NO3- to NO2-, consistent with the hypothesis that NO3- in the medium results primarily from the extracellular reaction of NO with O2. The addition of morpholine, a model amine, resulted in formation of N-nitrosomorpholine, concurrent with the other products. Measured rates of nitrosomorpholine formation were 6-fold lower than predictions based on kinetics in simple solutions, suggesting that in the cell culture system there were additional reactions that lowered the concentration of nitrous anhydride, the principal nitrosating agent formed from NO and O2.

It is known that NO reacts with superoxide (O2) to give peroxynitrite and that NO also reacts with peroxynitrite to yield NO2, so that the latter reaction may explain the “excess” NO2 formation. Adding superoxide dismutase to the medium markedly reduced the ratio of NO3- to NO2-, consistent with the hypothesis that NO3- in the medium results primarily from the extracellular reaction of NO with O2. The addition of morpholine, a model amine, resulted in formation of N-nitrosomorpholine, concurrent with the other products. Measured rates of nitrosomorpholine formation were 6-fold lower than predictions based on kinetics in simple solutions, suggesting that in the cell culture system there were additional reactions that lowered the concentration of nitrous anhydride, the principal nitrosating agent formed from NO and O2."

We recently reported the cloning and expression of human macrophage ACAT cDNA. In the current study, we report the production of specific polyclonal antibodies against ACAT by immunizing rabbits with the recombinant fusion protein composed of glutathione S-transferase and the first 131 amino acids of ACAT protein. Immunoblot analysis showed that the antibodies cross-reacted with a 50-kDa protein band from a variety of human cell lines. These antibodies immunodepleted more than 90% of detergent-solubilized ACAT activities from six different human cell types, demonstrating that the 50-kDa protein is the major ACAT catalytic component in these cells. In multiple human tissues examined, the antibodies recognized protein bands with various molecular weights. These antibodies also cross-reacted with the ACAT protein in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Immunoblot analysis showed that the ACAT protein contents in human fibroblast cells, HepG2 cells, or Chinese hamster ovary cells were not affected by sterol in the medium, demonstrating that the main mechanism for sterol-dependent regulation of ACAT activity in these cells is not change in ACAT protein content. As revealed by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy, the ACAT protein in tissue culture cells was located in the endoplasmic reticulum. This finding, along with earlier studies, suggests that cholesterol concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum may be the major determinant for regulating ACAT activity in the intact cells.

https://openalex.org/W2146870449,"Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP-1 and SREBP-2) are proteins of approximately 1150 amino acids each that are attached to membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In sterol-depleted cells, a protease releases an NH2-terminal fragment of approximately 500 amino acids that contains a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper motif. This fragment enters the nucleus and stimulates transcription of genes encoding the low density lipoprotein receptor and enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis. Prior evidence indicates that the SREBPs are attached to membranes by virtue of an 80-residue segment located approximately 80 amino acids to the COOH-terminal side of the leucine zipper. This segment contains two long hydrophobic sequences separated by a short hydrophilic sequence of approximately 30 amino acids. We have proposed a hairpin model in which the two hydrophobic sequences span the membrane, separated by the short hydrophilic sequence which projects into the lumen of the ER (the loop). The model predicts that the NH2- and COOH-terminal segments face the cytosol. To test this model, we constructed a cDNA encoding human SREBP-2 with epitope tags at the NH2 terminus and in the lumenal loop. The COOH-terminal region was visualized with a newly developed monoclonal antibody against this region. Sealed membrane vesicles were isolated from cells expressing the epitope-tagged version of SREBP-2. Trypsin treatment of these vesicles destroyed the NH2- and COOH-terminal segments and reduced the lumenal epitope to a size consistent with protection of the lumenal sequence plus the two membrane-spanning segments. The lumenal epitope tag contained two potential sites for N-linked glycosylation. The size of the trypsin-protected fragment was reduced by treatment with N-Glycanase and endoglycosidase H, indicating that this segment was located in the lumen of the ER where it was glycosylated. These data provide strong support for the hairpin model."

DNA transfection experiments and electrophoretic mobility shift assays have revealed the existence of five distinct regulatory regions including two positive regulatory elements and two negative regulatory elements in addition to the core promoter region. The first positive regulatory element (-219 to -172) interacts with two distinct nuclear protein complexes, at least one of which appears to be a previously unidentified transcription factor. The second positive regulatory element (+1 to +35) also interacts with two separate protein complexes, both of which appear to be novel transcription factors.

Aberrant TGF-β function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases including arthritis (Lafyatis et al., 1989), hepatitis (Castilla et al., 1991), atherosclerosis (Chen et al., 1987; Grainger et al., 1993), and glomerulonephritis (Border et al., 1990). It has also been suggested that in some cases, diminished responsiveness to TGF-β may underlie the process of malignant transformation (Wakefield and Sporn, 1990). This decreased responsiveness to TGF-β could be caused by defects not only in TGF-β expression or activation but also by defects in the regulation of TGF-β receptors. transforming growth factor-β TGF-β type II receptor rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction chloramphenicol acetyltransferase electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Much work has recently been directed toward characterizing the different types of TGF-β receptors and their intracellular signaling pathways as well as identifying their role in cell regulation and pathology (Miyazono et al., 1994; Kingsley, 1994; Massagué, 1992). Three distinct cell surface receptors, types I, II, and III, have been cloned and characterized (Wang et al. 1991; Lopez-Casillas et al., 1991; Lin et al., 1992; Moren et al., 1992; Franzen et al., 1993; He et al. 1993; Attisano et al., 1993). Type I and type II receptors are transmembrane serine/threonine kinases that together are sufficient for signal transduction. The type III receptor is a transmembrane proteoglycan without intrinsic signaling ability but that may facilitate the binding of TGF-β to the type II receptor (Wrana et al., 1992). The most commonly held model for receptor action proposes that the type I and type II receptors form a heteromeric complex that is essential for signaling responses (Wrana et al. 1994). It is therefore likely that a mutation in either receptor could result in a loss of responsiveness to TGF-β (Wrana et al., 1992; Bassing et al., 1994; Cárcamo et al., 1994). Several tumor cell lines, including retinoblastoma, pheochromocytoma, neuroblastoma, and breast carcinoma, which are resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β, also fail to express the type II receptor (Park et al., 1994; Kimchi et al., 1988; Sun et al., 1994). In a previous study, our laboratory described a series of gastric cancer cell lines in which resistance to TGF-β correlated with gross structural mutations in the type II receptor gene. There were two notable exceptions in which Southern analysis yielded a gene without gross deletions or rearrangements, but no type II receptor protein or mRNA was produced. This suggested that abnormalities in transcriptional regulation of the type II receptor may also be involved in the escape from TGF-β growth control frequently observed in the process of carcinogenesis. In order to study the transcriptional regulation of human TGF-β RII, we cloned and sequenced 1.9 kilobase pairs of the 5′-flanking region and used S1 nuclease mapping and 5′RACE PCR studies to identify five alternative transcription start sites within a region from residue -33 to +57. The human hepatoma HepG2 cell line was selected for this study because of its high level of TGF-β RII expression. Using a series of promoter-CAT deletion constructs transfected into HepG2 cells, we identified two distinct positive regulatory elements at -219 to -172 and +1 to +35. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and mutational analysis were then utilized to define two target sequences in the first positive regulatory element and one target sequence in the second positive regulatory element. One protein interacting with the first positive regulatory element may be an AP1 or CREB-like transcription factor. The other two target sequences do not share homology with any previously reported consensus sequences and may be recognized by novel transcription factor complexes. A human genomic library was obtained (Clontech) and screened by standard methods using the 5′ end fragment of the human TGF-β RII cDNA. Four overlapping clones of the promoter region were isolated, and subfragments were cloned into the pTZ18 vector (Pharmacia) and sequenced in both directions by the Sanger dideoxynucleotide method (U. S. Biochemical Corp. sequence kit). A 32P-labeled DNA probe was generated spanning the putative transcription start site(s). A plasmid containing the 2.7-kilobase pair XbaI-HindIII genomic DNA fragment (10 μg) was digested by the EagI restriction enzyme, which cut 138 base pairs 3′ of the published cDNA end (Lin et al., 1992) and left a 5′ overhang. The end was then labeled as described (Geiser et al., 1991), and the 5′ end of the probe was released by digestion with XbaI. The probe (100,000 cpm) was then hybridized to 80 μg of total RNA from human adenocarcinoma A549 and DU145 human prostatic adenocarcinoma cell lines in hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 400 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and 1 mM EDTA) overnight at 55°C. S1 nuclease digestion was then done with 150 units of enzyme (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h at 37°C. Samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitated and then loaded (in 50% formamide dye) onto a 6% denaturing acrylamide gel. Total RNA from A549 (4 μg) was reverse-transcribed (Perkin-Elmer RT-PCR kit) at 42°C for 1 h using random primers. The resulting cDNA was then tailed with dGTP using terminal transferase (Lif Technologies Inc.) to create a 5′ end with an oligo(dG) stretch. This product was then amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotide 5′-GGCCGAGGGAAGCTGCACAG (+137 to +119 relative to the published cDNA end) and an oligo(dC) (Geiser et al., 1991). The amplified product was run on an agarose gel, blotted to nytran, and hybridized to a labeled upstream oligonucleotide (+137 to +119) for evidence of amplified receptor product. The positive product was then amplified a second time using the oligonucleotide 5′-GAGTCCGGCTCCTGT CCCGAG (+118 to +98) and oligo(dC). The product was cloned into the AT cloning vector (Invitrogen), and individual clones were sequenced to determine the 5′ ends. Nuclear extracts of HepG2 cells were prepared as described (Kim et al., 1994) with minor variation. Monolayers of HepG2 cells (3 × 106 to 5 × 106) were harvested by scraping, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in 2 packed cell volumes of buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 200 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg of both leupeptin and aprotinin/ml, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 5 min at 4°C. The crude nuclei released by lysis were collected by microcentrifugation, rinsed once in buffer A, and resuspended in 2/3 packed cell volume of buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 420 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 MM dithiothreitol, and 1.0 μg of both leupeptin and aprotinin/ml). Nuclei were incubated on a rocking platform at 4°C for 30 min and clarified by microcentrifugation for 5 min. The resulting supernatants were diluted 1:1 with buffer D (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg of both leupeptin and aprotinin/ml). A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and DU145 human prostatic adenocarcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HepG2 cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transient expression assays, cells were plated at 1.2 × 106/100-cm dish and cultured for 24 h before transfection by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method with 5-10 μg of the appropriate plasmids purified by banding in CsCl. Cells were harvested 48 h after the addition of DNA. The extracts were then assayed for CAT activity. All transfections were repeated a minimum of three times. For normalization of transfection efficiencies in HepG2 cells, a growth hormone expression plasmid (pSVGH) was included in cotransfections. Growth hormone expression was quantified using a growth hormone detection kit (Nichols Institute). DNA constructs were generated by polymerase chain amplification using genomic DNA containing the 5′-untranslated region of the TGF-β type II receptor gene as a template. Amplified DNA fragments were cloned into the promoterless CAT expression plasmid (pGEM4-SV0CAT) (Kim et al., 1989) using HindIII and KpnI or XbaI restriction sites built into the oligonucleotides used for amplification. The sequences of the PCR-generated portions of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The constructs were named pTβRII-n, where n is the distance in nucleotides from the transcription initiation site. The plasmid containing the CAT gene alone was used as the control. All CAT construct plasmids were purified by two sequential CsCl banding steps. Double-stranded oligonucleotides representing the first and second enhancer regions as well as a series of mutant oligonucleotides for each region were generated using an oligonucleotide synthesizer. Two oligonucleotides, TβRII(-219/-172) and TβRII(+1/+50), were labeled using a fill in reaction with [α-32P]dCTP (50 μCi at 3,000 Ci/mmol) and the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. The fragments were then gel purified using a 6% polyacrylamide gel and autoradiography to locate the specific fragment. Binding reactions contained 10 μg of nuclear extract protein, buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, and 5% glycerol), 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 30,000 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA in a volume of 10 μl. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Competition reactions were performed by adding an unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide to the reaction mixture. Reactions were electrophoresed on a 6% NOVEX precasted nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 100 V for 1 h in a 100 mM Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Gels were vacuum dried and analyzed by autoradiography. A 5′ segment of the TGF-β RII cDNA was used to screen a human lambda phage genomic DNA library for clones containing the promoter region. Four independent clones were isolated that overlapped in the 5′-untranslated and promoter regions. Restriction fragments of the lambda phage inserts were subcloned and sequenced to derive the promoter sequence shown in Fig. 1. The sequence obtained includes 1883 nucleotides upstream and 35 nucleotides downstream of the 5′-most residue of the human TGF-β RII precursor cDNA (Lin et al., 1992). Examination of the human TGF-β RII gene sequence 5′ to the first major transcription initiation site designated as -1 reveals several notable features. No consensus CAAT or TATA boxes exist near the published cDNA end. The sequence GGGCGG is found at two positions -25 and -143 (Fig. 1) and corresponds to the sequence identified as the binding site for the transcription factor Sp1, commonly seen in the promoters of viral and cellular housekeeping genes. The consensus sequence of the transcription factor AP1 is also identified at two positions, -1213 (TGACTCA) and -195 (TTAGTCA). To identify the true start site(s) of transcription, S1 nuclease mapping was used on RNA isolated from two cell lines known to express the type II receptor, A549 human lung adenocarcinoma and DU145 human prostatic adenocarcinoma. A DNA probe was generated that would hybridize to the first 138 nucleotides of the mRNA (from the published cDNA sequence) and any RNA upstream (5′) of the published sequence. As shown in Fig. 2A, several putative start sites were repeatedly seen that represent RNA ends both longer and shorter than the published cDNA 5′ end. These heterologous start sites appear to span 90 nucleotides, from -33 to +57 relative to the cDNA 5′ end. The same probe hybridized to tRNA did not result in any protected bands, thus demonstrating the completion of the S1 nuclease digestion. Although S1 nuclease mapping of RNA ends is frequently a good indicator of transcriptional start sites, the multiple bands revealed by this assay prompted examination of the 5′ ends of the TGF-β RII mRNA through 5′ RACE PCR. Fig. 2B shows that heterogeneous clones representing heterologous start sites were observed. Of the six clones sequenced, two were longer than the published cDNA (by 4 and 35 nucleotides) and four were shorter (by 30, 36, and 38 nucleotides). These results indicate a range of transcripts spanning from -35 to +38, confirming the heterogeneous nature of transcriptional start sites observed in the S1 assays. Whereas the cloned 5′ ends approximated the S1 nuclease band sizes, some differences are evident that probably reflect deficiencies inherent in the assays (i.e. RNA secondary structure inhibiting reverse transcriptase in the 5′ RACE PCR or S1-sensitive sequence sites). To study in vitro transcriptional regulation of TGF-β RII, we selected the human hepatoma HepG2 cell line, which has been shown to have the highest basal level of expression of TGF-β RII of any line studied. In order to identify the sequences essential for transcription of the TGF-β RII gene, progressively shorter fragments of the 5′-flanking region fused with the coding region of the bacterial CAT gene in the plasmid pGEM-SV0CAT were transfected into HepG2 cells. As seen in Fig. 3, construct pTβRIIP(-1240/+50) generated a similar level of CAT activity as the longer constructs, -1430/+50, -1670/+50, and -1883/+50. Transcription doubled upon deletion of the sequence between -1240 and -504 (pTβRIIP(-504/+50)), suggesting the presence of a weak negative regulatory element in this region. Eliminating the sequence -274 to -137 (pTβRIIP(-137/+50)) resulted in a dramatic drop in transcriptional activity pointing to a very strong positive regulatory element localized to this region. Deletion of the sequence -137 to -47 (pTβRIIP(-47/+50)) led to a 10-fold increase in activity pointing to the presence of a second strong negative regulatory element within this region. Finally, the shortest construct, pTβRIIP(+2/+50), demonstrated a significant level of activity compared with the control SVoCAT construct, indicating the presence of a second functional positive regulatory element. Of all constructs evaluated, pTβRIIP-274 and pTβRIIP-504 displayed the highest level of activity. The most dramatic change in activity was seen with deletion of the region -274 to -137 containing the putative first positive regulatory element. Examination of this region reveals at least two potential recognition sequences for transcription factors AP1 (-195; TTAGTCA) and Sp1 (-143; GGGCGG, Fig. 1). To further define the first positive regulatory element (-274 to -137), an additional series of CAT deletion constructs was created from nucleotide -274 to -47, each ending at +2 (Fig. 4). Deletion of the sequences from -274 to -219 led to no significant change in the level of activity. However, removal of sequences from -219 to -200 decreased activity 20-fold, and further deletion to -172 abolished nearly all activity. This localized the positive regulatory element to within this 48-base pair sequence where there is an AP1-like binding site (-196; TTAGTCA; Fig. 1). Levels of transcription remained minimal with sequential deletion of nucleotides -172 through -100. However, when the region -100 to -67 was deleted, activity returned to previous levels, indicating the presence of a strong negative regulatory element in this region. Finally, the promoter fragment -47/+2 displayed a relatively high level of activity, which was significantly diminished by a substitution mutation of the Sp1 site, implicating a role for Sp1 in transcriptional activation from this region. To identify any nuclear proteins associating with the first positive regulatory element (-219 to -172), EMSA was performed as described above using a double-stranded 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the sequence for the first positive regulatory element. The reaction mixture was then electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide gel and viewed by autoradiography. The results are shown in Fig. 5A. In the absence of an unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide (lane 1), two strong upper bands (complex a and complex b) and multiple weak lower bands are apparent. It is clear that these bands represent specific binding of protein to the target oligonucleotide sequence, because binding to the labeled probe diminishes with increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor (lanes 2-6). Complex a was competed out more readily than complex b, suggesting that complex b binds with greater affinity or to a longer target sequence. To determine whether the observed AP1-like consensus sequences present in the first positive regulatory element are operative or whether other previously identified transcription factors might be responsible for the strong enhancer activity, a second mobility shift assay was performed. This time, the radiolabeled first positive regulatory sequence was incubated with HepG2 nuclear protein in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of the consensus sequences for AP1, AP2, and CRE. As shown in Fig. 5B (lanes 3 and 5), both the AP1 and the CRE recognition sequences were successful in competing with the first positive regulatory element (-219/+172) for binding with complex a but not complex b or the proteins represented by the lower bands. AP2 failed to compete with the first positive regulatory element for any protein. The target sequences for AP1 and CRE are very similar. Complex a may therefore represent an AP1 or CRE-like factor. The data further suggest that a novel transcription factor complex or an uncommon consensus sequence is responsible for the specific protein-DNA binding represented by complex b. To determine which sequences within the first positive regulatory element of the TGFβ RII promoter are required for specific binding to complexes a and b, we synthesized a series of mutant oligonucleotides derived from the first positive regulatory element (Fig. 6A). Each mutant oligonucleotide contained a 4-base pair substitution in which pyrimidine pairs were converted to purine pairs and vice versa. A mobility shift assay was then performed using a radiolabeled first positive regulatory element probe incubated with HepG2 nuclear protein in competition with the series of mutant oligonucleotides. As shown in Fig. 6B, substitution of nucleotides -207 to -192 (lanes 5-8, M4-M7, ACTGTGTGCACTTAGT) led to decreased competition for binding to complex b with the most marked reduction resulting from mutation of the central nucleotides -203 to -199 (lane 6, M5). The target sequence for complex b must therefore reside within this 16-nucleotide segment. Mutation of nucleotides -195 to -188 (lanes 8 and 9, M7 and M8, TAGTCATT) led to decreased competition for binding to complex a. This region shares homology with AP1 and CREB consensus sequences. The first positive regulatory element therefore contains at least two distinct sequences demonstrating specific binding to different nuclear proteins (Fig. 6C). To identify specific binding of proteins to the second positive regulatory element (+1 to +50), we employed the same strategy. An oligonucleotide representing the second positive regulatory element was synthesized and radiolabeled with 32P. HepG2 nuclear protein was combined with the labeled second positive regulatory element probe and incubated with increasing concentrations of unlabeled oligonucleotide. This assay was repeated several times, and representative results are shown in Fig. 7A. Two strong upper bands consistently appeared (complexes c and d) along with at least one weaker lower band (complex e) and represented specific binding because these bands progressively disappeared with increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor. To determine whether any of these bands represented known transcription factors, the second positive regulatory element probe was mixed with nuclear protein and incubated with the oligonucleotide target sequences for AP1, AP2, CREB, and Sp1 (Fig. 7B). There was no evidence of binding to any of these target sequences by complexes c, d, or e (lanes 3-6). Another set of oligonucleotides was synthesized in which the wild type second positive regulatory element was serially mutated with sequential 5-base pair substitution mutations (Fig. 8A). EMSA was performed using the second positive regulatory element probe, nuclear protein, and the mutant oligonucleotides. The results are shown in Fig. 8B. Competition for binding to complex c was abolished by mutation of nucleotides +16 to +20 (AAGTG, M4), whereas competition for binding to complexes c, d, and e was abolished by mutations through a longer sequence from +11 to +29 (Fig. 8B, M3-M6). Therefore, the second positive regulatory element appears to contain at least one nuclear protein recognition sequence from +11 to +29 and possibly a second nested within the first (Fig. 8C). This sequence does not match any published binding site for previously described transcription factors, suggesting that the second positive regulatory element, as well as the first positive regulatory element, may be regulated by an unidentified transcription factor(s). To evaluate the relative contributions of the first and second positive regulatory elements to the overall promoter activity levels, another series of CAT contructs was created containing various combinations of mutations and deletions in the two target sequences of the first positive regulatory element, designated X and Y, and the single target sequence of the second positive regulatory element, designated Z. Fig. 9A presents a schematic of the construct series. Construct -219/+35 contained the wild type human TGF-β RII promoter sequence from nucleotide -219 to +35. The presence of a bar represents the intact wild type target sequence, and absence of the bar indicates that the sequence has been mutated. Thus, construct -219/+35M3 carried the promoter sequence with a 5-base pair substitution mutation in Z (+11 to +16, AGTTT-CTGGG). Similarly, -219M7/+35 carried a substitution mutation in Y (-195 to -192, TAGT-GCTG), whereas -219M5/+35 carried a mutation in X (-203 to -200, TGTG-GTGT). -219M5/+35M3 combined mutations in both X and Z. -219M7/+35M3 combined mutations in Y and Z. Constructs -219M5/+2, -219M7/+2, and -219/+2 contained a truncated promoter sequence from -219 to +2 in which the second positive regulatory element was deleted. These CAT constructs were transfected into HepG2 cells, and the transcriptional activity was assayed. As anticipated, the highest level of transcription occurred with both intact first and second positive regulatory elements (-219/+35). Isolated mutations of sequences Y and X in the first positive regulatory element (-219M7/+35 and -219M5/+35, respectively) or of sequence Z in the second positive regulatory element (-219/+35M3) caused only a small decrease in activity. Among the three individual mutations, the largest decrease in activity to 82% of baseline, occurred with the isolated mutation of sequence Y, which contains the putative AP1/CRE site. Mutations in the first positive regulatory element were then paired with mutation of the second positive regulatory element and, as expected, led to much more dramatic decreases in transcriptional activity. When both X and Z were mutated (-219M5/+35M3), activity fell to 56% of baseline levels. Combined Y and Z mutations (-219M7/+35M3) decreased activity to 14% of baseline. Again, mutation of sequence Y led to a more significant decrease in transcription than mutation of X. Deletion of the second positive regulatory element decreased transcription to a greater degree than simply mutating the target sequence Z, confirming that sequence Z is essential to activity of the second positive regulatory element but suggesting that the mutation was not sufficient to inactivate the entire target sequence. Comparing all constructs, the lowest level of activity occurred with mutation of both the target sequences for the first and second positive regulatory elements. Thus, the two target sequences in the first positive regulatory element and the single target sequence in the second positive regulatory element are critical to conferring enhancer activity, and both positive regulatory elements interact to contribute significantly to basal promoter activity. In 1985, Sporn and Roberts first suggested that defects in the TGF-β receptor system might, in some situations, account for resistance to its effects on growth in some situations. There is now substantial evidence to support this early speculation. For example, human esophageal epithelial cells stably transfected with cyclin D1 are resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β1; these cells express normal levels of the type I receptor but markedly reduced levels of the type II receptor (Okamoto et al., 1994). Murine myeloid cells infected with the src oncogene express significantly higher levels of the type II receptor and show increased sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β1 (Birchenall-Roberts et al., 1991). Transfecting human breast carcinoma and hepatoma cells lacking type II receptor with wild type TGF-β RII restores sensitivity to TGF-β and decreases tumorigenicity in transplanted breast cancer cells (Sun et al., 1994; Inagaki et al., 1993). Recently, we have reported that a majority of human gastric carcinoma cell lines acquired resistance to growth inhibition by TGF-β and possessed structural mutations in TGF-β RII (Park et al. 1994). Instances in which cells failed to express RII mRNA despite the absence of apparent structural deletions or rearrangements of the gene introduced the possibility of a promoter defect and first suggested that transcriptional regulation may play an important role in controlling TGF-β RII expression. Most recently, Markowitz et al., (1995) have identified a subset of colon cancer cell lines in which defective DNA repair mechanisms consistently lead to characteristic mutations in the TGF-β RII gene causing resistance to growth inhibition by TGF-β. Inactivation of TGF-β RII may be a common occurrence in epithelial malignancies. By permitting escape from regulation by TGF-β, such mutations confer a strong growth advantage to affected cell populations. Decreased transcription of RII mRNA can have the same effect as mutation of the structural gene. In this report we present an expanded sequence for the promoter region of TGFβ RII and describe the existence of at least five distinct regulatory regions including two positive regulatory elements (-219 to -172 and +1 to +35) and two negative regulatory elements (-1240 to -504 and -100 to -67; Fig. 10) in addition to the core promoter region (-47 to -1; Fig. 10). One negative element located between 0.5 and 1.2 kilobase pairs upstream from the transcriptional start site(s) was not extensively examined in this study. Deletion of this region increased transcription approximately 2-fold. The first positive regulatory element (-219 to -172) is required for basal transcriptional activity because its deletion allows the powerful second negative regulatory element (-100 to -67) to repress transcription completely regardless of the presence of the core promoter and second positive regulatory element (see -137/+50 in Fig. 3 and -172/+2 in Fig. 5). Transcription directed by the core promoter region is dependent on an Sp1 consensus sequence at -25. Mutation of this sequence reduces transcription by 70% (-47Sp1 mt/+2 in Fig. 4). Two distinct protein complexes demonstrate specific binding to the first positive regulatory element. Complex a, which may be identical to AP1 or CREB, binds to sequence Y (-196 to -189), and complex b binds to sequence X (-207 to -197). The second positive regulatory element is also recognized specifically by two different protein complexes. In this case complexes c, d, and e all bind to the same target sequence Z (+11 to +25), although complex c appears to bind to a more limited portion (+16 to +21). Mutational analysis reveals that the two positive regulatory elements cooperate with the promoter region to sustain basal levels of promoter activity. Maximum levels of transcription were achieved with intact first and second positive regulatory elements. Mutation of individual target sequences in either first or second positive regulatory element impaired transcription only slightly; however, mutation of both first and second positive regulatory sequences together led to marked declines in transcriptional activity (Fig. 9, A and B). This study presents sequencing data for the human TGF-β RII promoter region that agrees well with a previously published report (Humphries et al., 1994) and also extends the known sequence an additional 930 base pairs upstream. However, unlike the earlier report, this study shows the heterogeneous nature of the transcriptional start sites and presents functional data regarding the regulation of transcription from the human TGF-β RII promoter region. The human TGF-β RII promoter is similar to other promoters lacking TATA and CAAT boxes in that transcription is initiated from multiple start sites separated by as much as 90 nucleotides surrounding the previously published cDNA 5′ end (Lin et al., 1992). The identification of start sites at +30 and further downstream complements the recognition of a positive regulatory element at +11 to +25. Sequence analysis reveals multiple sites homologous to known transcription factor consensus sequences. Two putative Sp1 sites are located at -143 and -25. The -25 site is responsible for at least 70% of basal activity from the -47/-1 core promoter region. Two putative AP1/CREB binding sites have also been recognized at -669 and -196. The -669 site is located in a region that contains a weak negative regulatory element, but further analysis is required to determine if this site is functional. The -196 site is located in the first positive regulatory element and corresponds to the binding site for complex a (Fig. 6C). EMSA performed with the labeled first positive regulatory element and HepG2 nuclear extract in competition with unlabeled AP1 and CRE consensus sequences confirmed that complex a specifically bound to AP1/CRE-like sequences. Purified AP1 and CRE/ATF protein also demonstrated specific binding to the first positive regulatory element. (2)D. H. Kim, M. T. Chung, A. B. Roberts, and S.-J. Kim, unpublished data. This study has shown that the promoter region of the human TGF-β RII gene contains multiple components including two positive regulatory elements and two negative regulatory elements in addition to the core promoter. Such a high level of structural complexity suggests a correspondingly high level of functional intricacy. Multiple nuclear proteins have been shown to bind specifically to the two positive regulatory elements, and it is likely that these proteins include previously unidentified transcription factors. Studies are currently underway to define the activity of the TGF-β RII promoter in different cell lines as well as to purify and characterize the involved binding proteins. We thank Herbert Y. Lin and Harvey F. Lodish for the TGF-β type II receptor cDNA as well as Erwin Böttinger, David Danielpour, and Robert Lechleider for helpful suggestions."

However, Cu(OP)2 had no effect on mitochondria. The transport of ADP via the carrier through submitochondrial particle membranes was found to be inhibited in parallel with the progress of intermolecular cross-linking. Analysis of the cross-linked site showed that a disulfide bridge was formed only between two Cys56 residues in a pair of the first loops facing the matrix space. The transport inhibitor bongkrekic acid, which locks the m-state conformation of the carrier, had no effect on disulfide bridge formation catalyzed by Cu(OP)2, but carboxyatractyloside, which locks the c-state conformation by acting from the cytosolic side, completely inhibited the cross-linking. These results show that the ADP/ATP carrier functions as a dimer form, and a pair of the first loops protrudes into the matrix space in the m-state, but possibly intrudes into the membrane in the c-state. Thus, it is suggested that a pair of the first loops acts as a gate and that its opening and closing are regulated by their translocation.

The 30-kDa ADP/ATP carrier present in the inner mitochondrial membrane mediates the transport of ADP and ATP from both the cytosolic and matrix sides of the mitochondrial inner membrane, and its structural properties including its primary structures in preparations from various sources have been well studied(1Aquila H.

In this model, each repeat consists of a pair of transmembrane segments linked by a hydrophilic matrix-facing loop. These loops are referred to as M1, M2, and M3. The functional unit of the carrier is considered to be a dimer form(7Riccio P. Aquila H. Klingenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1975; 56: 133-138Google Scholar, 8Hackenberg H. Klingenberg M.

Chemical modifications of certain amino acid residues provide useful information about the structure of proteins.

Moreover, we concluded that loops M1 and M2 act as gates in the transport of ADP and ATP. The role of loop M3 is not yet clear. Based on these results, we proposed a model of adenine nucleotide transport involving changes in the locations of pairs of M1 loops and M2 loops in the dimer form of the carrier(13Majima E.

Later, Joshi and Torok reported that an ADP/ATP carrier contaminating the preparation of ATPase was the protein modified by Cu(OP)2 and that Cu(OP)2 caused intermolecular and intramolecular disulfide bridges in electron transport particles from bovine heart mitochondria(20Joshi S. Torok K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12742-12748Google Scholar), but it seemed to induce only intramolecular cross-linking of the carrier present in the preparation of H+-ATPase(21Torok K. Joshi S. FEBS Lett. 1985; 182: 340-344Google Scholar). They also suggested that Cys159 and Cys256 were associated with the intramolecular cross-linking. As we proposed previously that the ADP/ATP carrier is responsible for the uncoupling induced by Cu(OP)2(22Shinohara Y. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 890: 387-391Google Scholar), these results prompted us to study which cysteine residues are responsible for the intermolecular cross-linkage and which of the intermolecular or intramolecular disulfide bond(s) is formed predominantly in the membrane-bound carrier. Therefore, we examined the effects of Cu(OP)2 on bovine heart submitochondrial particles under various conditions. Based on our present results, we discuss changes in configuration of the loops in the ADP/ATP carrier in relation to its transport function.

BKA and rabbit anti-ADP/ATP carrier serum were gifts from Prof. Duine (Delft University of Technology) and Prof. Klingenberg (University of Munich), respectively. Submitochondrial particles containing 5 mM ATP were prepared from bovine heart mitochondria as described previously(12Majima E. Koike H. Hong Y.-M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22181-22187Google Scholar), and CATR-preloaded submitochondrial particles were prepared in a similar way from mitochondria that had been incubated with 4 nmol of CATR/mg of protein at 25°C for 10 min. Amounts of protein in mitochondria and submitochondrial particles were determined with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce) in the presence of 1% SDS using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cu(OP)2 was prepared just before use by mixing CuSO4 with o-phenanthroline in a molar ratio of 1:2 in a solution of 250 mM sucrose and 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), and its concentration was expressed in terms of Cu2+. A solution of Cu(OP)2 was mixed with an equal volume of submitochondrial particle suspension (8 mg of protein/ml) in the same medium at 0°C for various periods, and the reaction was terminated by addition of EDTA and NEM, each at a final concentration of 5 mM. For assay by SDS-PAGE, the samples of particles after treatment with Cu(OP)2 were mixed with an equal volume of 2% SDS in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8) containing 20% glycerol and incubated at 25°C for 30 min. Electrophoresis of 10-μg protein samples was carried out according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) on 12% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, and the staining intensity of bands was measured at 560 nm in a Shimadzu Chromatoscanner (Model CS-9000). The effects of test compounds on the cross-linking of the ADP/ATP carrier were examined by their preincubation with submitochondrial particles at 0°C for 10 min. Proteins in the gel after electrophoresis were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) in a semidry blotter (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) with anode buffer (No. 1) consisting of 0.3 M Tris and 20% methanol; anode buffer (No. 2) consisting of 25 mM Tris and 20% methanol; and cathode buffer consisting of 25 mM Tris, 40 mM 6-amino-n-caproic acid, and 20% methanol in the presence of 0.02% SDS for 1 h at 3 mA/cm2. Unoccupied free binding sites on the membrane were blocked by incubation with 10% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Then the membrane was incubated overnight with TBS (25 mM Tris-HCl and 0.15 M NaCl (pH 7.4)) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and rabbit anti-ADP/ATP carrier serum (1:1000 dilution) at 4°C. After washing three times with TBS, the membrane was incubated with TBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000 dilution; Cappel) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with TBS, and then incubated with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (0.17 mg/ml) and hydrogen peroxide (0.015%) in TBS for 10-60 min at room temperature. Color development was terminated by rinsing the membrane with distilled water and then drying it. Submitochondrial particles with or without Cu(OP)2 treatment were suspended at 2 mg of protein/ml in a solution of 250 mM sucrose, 1 μg of oligomycin/mg of protein, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2). Then [3H]ADP (specific radioactivity, 185 kBq/μmol) was added at a final concentration of 20 μM, and the mixture was incubated for 10 s at 0°C. Transport was stopped by addition of BKA at a final concentration of 20 μM. Extraparticular ADP was removed by passing the suspension of particles through a column of AG 1-X8. Fractions containing the particles were pooled, and incorporated ADP was determined from the radioactivity(12Majima E. Koike H. Hong Y.-M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22181-22187Google Scholar). To identify the cross-linked cysteine residues of the ADP/ATP carrier, we isolated the intermolecular cross-linked 60-kDa carrier and the native carrier (30 kDa), referred to as (AAC)2 and AAC, respectively, from submitochondrial particles with or without Cu(OP)2 treatment by a method reported previously (12Majima E. Koike H. Hong Y.-M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22181-22187Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The isolated proteins, which had been treated with NEM, were reduced with DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide. By these treatments, the remaining free SH groups were modified by NEM, and the SH groups responsible for disulfide bonds were carboxamidomethylated. Details of the procedure were as follows. Particles (10 mg of protein) that had been incubated with or without 100 μM Cu(OP)2 for 20 min at 0°C were treated with 5 mM EDTA and 5 mM NEM to terminate the reaction and to alkylate free SH groups, respectively. Then they were solubilized in a solution of 5% Triton X-100, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 10 mM MOPS (pH 7.2) for 10 min at O°C. The solubilized sample was passed through a hydroxylapatite column, and the flow-through fraction was treated with 5 volumes of acetone at -20°C overnight. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with diethyl ether, and dried under vacuum. The dried sample was dissolved in 6 M guanidine HCl containing 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM NEM, and 100 mM MOPS (pH 6.8) and incubated for 60 min at 25°C to alkylate the free SH groups with NEM completely. Then (AAC)2 or AAC was isolated by gel filtration on a G4000SWXL column (0.78 × 30 cm; Tosoh Co., Tokyo) with 63% acetonitrile containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The fractions containing (AAC)2 (5 nmol) or AAC (10 nmol) were concentrated in a SpeedVac concentrator and denatured with 10 volumes of 6 M guanidine HCl solution containing 1 mM EDTA and 0.5 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5). Disulfide bonds in proteins were reduced by incubation with 2 μmol of DTT for 2 h at 37°C under a stream of nitrogen, and the resulting reduced cysteine residues were carboxamidomethylated with 4.2 μmol of iodoacetamide for 30 min at 25°C in the dark. These preparations are referred to as RC-(AAC)2 and RC-AAC, respectively. The solutions were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid and subjected to HPLC on a G4000SWXL column with 63% acetonitrile containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Peak fractions containing RC-(AAC)2 or RC-AAC were concentrated to 50 μl and diluted four times with 200 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), and samples were digested with lysylendopeptidase (2%, w/w) at 37°C for 24 h. After addition of 5 volumes of 7 M guanidine HCl, the digested peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a TSKgel ODS-120T column (0.46 × 15 cm; Tosoh Co.) using a linear gradient of 12-52% acetonitrile containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in 80 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The elution was monitored by the absorbance at 210 nm. As a reference, the ADP/ATP carrier was isolated from the particles without Cu(OP)2 treatment by the same procedure as described above. The isolated carrier was denatured with guanidine HCl and reduced with DTT. Then all its cysteine residues were either alkylated with NEM or carboxamidomethylated with iodoacetamide. The carriers thus obtained are referred to as RNEM and RCAM, respectively. First, we examined the effect of Cu(OP)2 oxidation on the SH groups of the ADP/ATP carrier. For this, submitochondrial particles were incubated with various concentrations of Cu(OP)2 at 0°C for 10 min; the reaction was terminated by addition of EDTA to trap free and complexed Cu2+; and then NEM was added to modify the remaining free cysteine residues. The particles were solubilized with SDS; the solution was subjected to SDS-PAGE; and the Coomassie Blue staining intensities of the bands on the gel were determined. As shown in Fig. 1, the staining intensity of a band at 30 kDa, which was identified as that of the ADP/ATP carrier by amino acid sequence analysis(12Majima E. Koike H. Hong Y.-M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22181-22187Google Scholar), specifically decreased with an increase in the Cu(OP)2 concentration, and concomitantly, a 60-kDa band appeared. Both these bands reacted with antibody against the ADP/ATP carrier (Fig. 2A). The 60-kDa band changed back to the 30-kDa band on treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol, as described below (cf.Fig. 4). From these results, the 60-kDa protein was concluded to be formed by intermolecular cross-linking of the ADP/ATP carrier. After treatment with >50 μM Cu(OP)2, we detected a faint immunostained band at 28 kDa on longer color development of the blotted membrane (Fig. 2B). As the 28-kDa protein in this band changed to the 30-kDa protein on treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol, it was presumably an intramolecular cross-linked carrier, as reported previously(20Joshi S. Torok K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12742-12748Google Scholar). Hereafter, we refer to the 30-kDa ADP/ATP carrier, the intermolecular cross-linked 60-kDa carrier, and the intramolecular cross-linked 28-kDa carrier as AAC, (AAC)2 and AAC′, respectively.Figure 2Immunostaining of the ADP/ATP carrier in submitochondrial particles treated with Cu(OP)2. After SDS-PAGE as shown in Fig. 1, the proteins in the gel were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated with rabbit anti-ADP/ATP carrier serum (1:1000 dilution). The membrane was further incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000 dilution) and then developed with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (0.17 mg/ml) and 0.015% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min (A) or 60 min (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Effects of various compounds on cross-linking of the ADP/ATP carrier catalyzed by Cu(OP)2. The effect of 2 mM NEM was examined by its incubation with bovine heart submitochondrial particles (20 mg of protein/ml) for 10 min at 0°C in medium consisting of 250 mM sucrose and 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) in a similar way to that described previously(12Majima E. Koike H. Hong Y.-M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22181-22187Google Scholar). For examination of the effects of solubilization with detergents, the particles (8 mg of protein/ml) were treated with either 1% SDS or 3% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 0°C in medium consisting of 150 mM Na2SO4 and 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.4), which is a commonly used medium for reconstitution in experiments on the ADP/ATP carrier(25Krämer R. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4209-4215Google Scholar). All samples (4 mg of protein/ml) were treated with 100 μM Cu(OP)2 as described for Fig. 1 and then subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (left) or under reducing conditions with 4% 2-mercaptoethanol (2ME) (right). SMP indicates submitochondrial particles without any treatment, and None indicates submitochondrial particles treated only with Cu(OP)2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 3 shows the changes in the amounts of AAC, (AAC)2, and AAC′ determined from the intensities of the immunostained bands shown in Fig. 2 as functions of the Cu(OP)2 concentration. With an increase in the concentration of Cu(OP)2, the amount of AAC decreased rapidly up to 100 μM Cu(OP)2, and then more gradually. With 400 μM Cu(OP)2, 90% of the carrier was modified. With a decrease in the amount of AAC, on treatment with Cu(OP)2 up to 100 μM, the level of (AAC)2 increased ~60% and then decreased gradually due to formation of aggregates, which remained at the origin of the gel (cf.Fig. 1). In contrast, formation of AAC′ increased slightly but steadily with an increase in the Cu(OP)2 concentration, attaining a plateau level of ~10% of the original amount of AAC at 400 μM Cu(OP)2. Similar changes were observed in the Coomassie Blue staining intensities of the AAC and (AAC)2 bands shown in Fig. 1. However, their levels were not superimposable on those of the corresponding immunostained bands. Results with AAC are shown in Fig. 3, the intensity level being consistently higher than that of the immunostained band due to overlapping of the AAC band with some other protein bands of ~30 kDa. These results showed that Cu(OP)2 caused formation of mainly (AAC)2 and then higher aggregates. During these changes, transformation of AAC to AAC′ also took place, but to a much lesser extent. At higher temperatures, such as 25°C, and at alkaline pH values, such as pH 8, the effect of Cu(OP)2 was more pronounced, and formation of higher aggregates proceeded so rapidly that the 60-kDa band was hardly observable (data not shown). It is noteworthy that under these conditions, formation of intramolecular cross-linked AAC′ became significant. As the formation of higher aggregates and intramolecular cross-linking were very low at Cu(OP)2 concentrations of <100 μM at 0°C, these mild conditions were suitable for quantitative analyses of the effect of Cu(OP)2. As shown in Fig. 4, the 60-kDa band of (AAC)2 formed by treatment of the particles with 100 μM Cu(OP)2 for 10 min at 0°C completely disappeared on further treatment with SH-reducing reagents such as 2-mercaptoethanol, and instead, the 30-kDa band of AAC was restored to the same level as in the untreated particles. Pretreatment of particles with NEM for 10 min completely inhibited the formation of (AAC)2. These results indicate that Cu(OP)2 oxidizes SH groups of the carrier, resulting predominantly in the formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges. When submitochondrial particles were solubilized with 3% Triton X-100 and then treated with Cu(OP)2, no 60-kDa (AAC)2 band was observed, and the amount of 28-kDa AAC′ increased significantly in association with the disappearance of the 30-kDa band (Fig. 4). Moreover, treatment of the ADP/ATP carrier in submitochondrial particles first with 1% SDS and then with Cu(OP)2 caused the appearance of a band at ~29 kDa distinct from that at 28 kDa formed on treatment with Triton X-100. As these two bands were reversed to the band of 30 kDa by treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 4), they were concluded to be due to intramolecular cross-linking of cysteine residues catalyzed by Cu(OP)2 and to have slightly different conformations from 30-kDa AAC, resulting in their higher electrophoretic mobilities on SDS-PAGE. Next, we examined the time course of the cross-linking of the carrier by Cu(OP)2 and the effect of this cross-linking on ADP transport. For this, we incubated submitochondrial particles with 100 μM Cu(OP)2 at 0°C for various periods, terminating the oxidation of cysteine residues by addition of EDTA. Then we subjected part of the preparation to SDS-PAGE and used another part for determination of the ADP transport activity. As shown in Fig. 5A, within the first 10 min, the Coomassie Blue staining intensity of the carrier at 30 kDa decreased rapidly with an increase in that of (AAC)2. Subsequently, the rate of decrease in intensity of the 30-kDa band became slower, while that of the 60-kDa band attained a plateau level due to formation of higher aggregates. The ADP transport activity of the ADP/ATP carrier was inhibited by Cu(OP)2 in accordance with a decrease in the amount of the 30-kDa carrier (Fig. 5B). The time-dependent decrease in intensity of the band of AAC stained with Coomassie Blue was qualitatively, but not quantitatively, similar to that of ADP transport inhibition because the AAC band overlapped those of other proteins of ~30 kDa, as described above (cf.Fig. 3). As the relative transport inhibition (~26%) after treatment with 100 μM Cu(OP)2 for 10 min at 0°C was consistent with the relative amount of AAC determined by the immunostaining (~20%) shown in Fig. 3 under the same incubation conditions, cross-linking of the carrier was concluded to be associated with inhibition of transport. Incubation of the mitochondria with 100 μM Cu(OP)2 for up to 60 min resulted in no appreciable change in the 30-kDa band (data not shown), showing that Cu(OP)2, which oxidizes SH groups on the membrane surface(17Klingenberg M. Appel M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 123-131Google Scholar, 24Duncan D.D. Lawrence D.A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1988; 68: 137-152Google Scholar), interacted only with SH groups on the matrix side, not with those on the cytosolic side. To identify the cysteine residues responsible for the formation of the intermolecular disulfide bond in the ADP/ATP carrier catalyzed by Cu(OP)2, we isolated 60-kDa (AAC)2 from the particles after treatment with 100 μM Cu(OP)2 for 20 min at 0°C, conditions under which formation of the intermolecular cross-linkage was highest (cf.Fig. 5). Then we treated the particles with NEM to alkylate residual free SH groups and solubilized them with Triton X-100. The solubilized preparation was passed through hydroxylapatite gel, and (AAC)2 in the flow-through fraction was precipitated with acetone, solubilized, and denatured with guanidine HCl containing NEM to alkylate free SH groups completely. The preparation was then subjected to gel filtration with 63% acetonitrile containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid to isolate (AAC)2 (Fig. 6A). As a control, the ADP/ATP carrier without Cu(OP)2 treatment was also isolated from the particles by the same procedure. (AAC)2 isolated from particles treated with Cu(OP)2 and AAC isolated from particles without Cu(OP)2 treatment each gave a single band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6B) and were used for further analyses. In addition, we prepared ADP/ATP carrier in which all the cysteine residues were alkylated with NEM or carboxamidomethylated with iodoacetamide. These carrier preparations are referred to as RNEM and RCAM, respectively. RNEM and RCAM were digested with lysylendopeptidase, and their peptide fragments were separated by reversed-phase HPLC. As shown in Fig. 7(A and B), peaks due to the peptides Gly147-Lys162, Gly245-Lys259, Gln49-Lys62, and Gln107-Lys146, containing Cys159, Cys256, Cys56, and Cys128, respectively, were observed. We identified these four peaks of peptides containing cysteine residues by amino acid sequence analysis as described previously(12Majima E. Koike H. Hong Y.-M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22181-22187Google Scholar). The peptides alkylated by NEM are referred to as N159, N256, N56, and N128, respectively, and those carboxamidomethylated as C159, C256, C56, and C128, respectively, according to the cysteine positions in these peptide fragments. For identification of the cysteine residues involved in formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds catalyzed by Cu(OP)2, (AAC)2 was isolated, denatured, and alkylated with NEM under nonreducing conditions. Then the preparation was treated with DTT to reduce all the disulfide bonds, and the resulting free SH residues were carboxamidomethylated. As all the free cysteine residues in denatured (AAC)2 had been alkylated with NEM, the cysteine residues that were carboxamidomethylated should be involved in the intermolecular disulfide bonds. We also treated isolated AAC with iodoacetamide under reducing conditions after denaturation and alkylation by NEM following the same procedure. These carboxamidomethylated AAC and (AAC)2 preparations are referred to as RC-AAC and RC-(AAC)2, respectively. They were digested with lysylendopeptidase and then subjected to reversed-phase HPLC. The elution profile of peptide fragments from RC-AAC showed four peaks due to N159, N256, N56, and N128, but no peak due to peptides containing carboxamidomethylated cysteine residue was observed (Fig. 7C), indicating that all the cysteine residues in AAC had been alkylated with NEM before reduction and carboxamidomethylation and that no disulfide bridge exists in intact ADP/ATP carrier. In contrast, the elution profile of RC-(AAC)2 showed a peak due to C56 besides those due to N159, N256, and N128, which were almost the same heights as those of RCAM and RNEM. No peak due to N56 or to C159, C256, or C128 was detected (Fig. 7D). These results clearly show that Cys56 is responsible for disulfide bridge formation catalyzed by Cu(OP)2 and that no other cysteine residues form cross-linkages. We concluded that a disulfide bond was formed specifically between two Cys56 residues in a pair of M1 loops of the dimeric ADP/ATP carrier. CATR and BKA inhibit transport by acting from the cytosolic and matrix sides, respectively. The effects of these inhibitors on cross-linking of the carrier were examined by incubation of submitochondrial particles first with these inhibitors at various concentrations for 10 min at 0°C and then with 50 μM Cu(OP)2 for 10 min at 0°C. As shown in Fig. 8, addition of up to 40 μM BKA to the submitochondrial particles from the matrix side, which completely inhibits transport, did not inhibit the formation of disulfide bridges. In contrast, CATR added from the cytosolic side, but not from the matrix side, completely inhibited the formation of (AAC)2. Next, the effects of 50 μM Cu(OP)2 on the disulfide bond formation of the carrier in submitochondrial particles, which had been pretreated with these inhibitors at 40 μM, were examined at various incubation times with Cu(OP)2 at 0°C. The time courses of changes in Coomassie Blue staining intensities of AAC and (AAC)2 are shown in Fig. 9. The decrease in the amount of AAC and the increase in the amount of (AAC)2 were more gradual than those on treatment with 100 μM Cu(OP)2 (cf.Fig. 5). As expected, BKA added from the matrix side had no effect on the formation of (AAC)2, but CATR added from the cytosolic side completely inhibited loss of AAC and formation of (AAC)2 even on long incubation (60 min) with Cu(OP)2. As BKA from the matrix side and CATR from the cytosolic side fix the m-state and c-state conformations of the carrier, respectively(6Klingenberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 1-14Google Scholar), we conclude that the m-state, but not the c-state, conformation of the carrier favors formation of the disulfide bridge catalyzed by Cu(OP)2. The cross-linking reagent Cu(OP)2 has been reported to cause specific intermolecular and intramolecular cross-linking of the ADP/ATP carrier in submitochondrial particles (20Joshi S. Torok K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12742-12748Google Scholar) and apparently to catalyze formation of only intramolecular cross-links associated with Cys159 and Cys256 in the carrier contaminating a preparation of H+-ATPase(21Torok K. Joshi S. FEBS Lett. 1985; 182: 340-344Google Scholar). Therefore, the susceptibility of the membrane-bound ADP/ATP carrier to Cu(OP)2 may be different from that in the isolated preparation. In this study, we confirmed that Cu(OP)2 caused cross-linking of the carrier in bovine heart submitochondrial particles, but did not affect the carrier in mitochondria. Our results show that four cysteine residues (Cys56, Cys128, Cys159, and Cys256) in the carrier are not exposed to the cytosolic side, as we reported previously(12Majima E. Koike H. Hong Y.-M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22181-22187Google Scholar, 13Majima E. Shinohara Y. Yamaguchi N. Hong Y.-M. Terada H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9530-9536Google Scholar). Formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges took place predominantly under mild oxidation conditions with Cu(OP)2, whereas formation of the intramolecular bridge occurred under rather strong oxidation conditions. It is noteworthy that the carrier solubilized by Triton X-100 and that denatured by SDS did not form the dimer (AAC)2 even under mild conditions, but instead formed intramolecular cross-links with different conformations as reflected by different electrophoretic mobilities on SDS-PAGE. Therefore, even the carrier solubilized by the “mild” detergent Triton X-100, which has been commonly used to isolate the ADP/ATP carrier for reconstitution experiments(25Krämer R. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4209-4215Google Scholar), may have a different conformation from that of the membrane-bound carrier. This is consistent with the predominant formation of intramolecular cross-links of the ADP/ATP carrier in isolated preparations of H+-ATPase(21Torok K. Joshi S. FEBS Lett. 1985; 182: 340-344Google Scholar). Our results suggest that under mild oxidation conditions, Cu(OP)2 could be a useful probe to monitor the integrity of the ADP/ATP carrier in the membrane. Interestingly, only Cys56 in loop M1 was associated with intermolecular cross-linking, indicating that this loop is exposed to the matrix space, as we suggested previously(12Majima E. Koike H. Hong Y.-M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22181-22187Google Scholar, 13Majima E. Shinohara Y. Yamaguchi N. Hong Y.-M. Terada H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9530-9536Google Scholar). The Cys56 residues are not always located very close together because they did not form disulfide bridges in “intact” submitochondrial particles in the absence of Cu(OP)2. Probably, they fluctuate in position in the membrane as observed with the C-terminal peptide of uncoupling protein, a member of the mitochondrial solute carrier family like the ADP/ATP carrier(17Klingenberg M. Appel M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 123-131Google Scholar). The present results also confirm that the dimer form of the ADP/ATP carrier is its functional unit (7Riccio P. Aquila H. Klingenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1975; 56: 133-138Google Scholar, 8Hackenberg H. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 548-555Google Scholar, 9Block M.R. Zaccaï G. Lauquin G.J.M. Vignais P.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 109: 471-477Google Scholar) and that two carrier molecules are located in the membrane facing each other in the same orientation. As intermolecular cross-linking inhibited ADP transport via the ADP/ATP carrier, a pair of M1 loops may act as a gate in adenine nucleotide transport. In contrast, intermolecular cross-linking of cysteine residues in the C-terminal region of uncoupling protein did not inhibit H+ transport, showing that this peptide chain does not act as a gate(17Klingenberg M. Appel M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 123-131Google Scholar). It is known that the ADP/ATP carrier has two conformational states, the c- and m-states, and that adenine nucleotides are transported due to interconversion of these two states(6Klingenberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 1-14Google Scholar, 13Majima E. Shinohara Y. Yamaguchi N. Hong Y.-M. Terada H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9530-9536Google Scholar). The transport inhibitors CATR, acting from the cytosolic side, and BKA, acting from the matrix side, fix the c-state and m-state conformations, respectively(2Klingenberg M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 447-457Google Scholar, 3Brandolin G. Le Saux A. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J.M. Vignais P.V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 459-472Google Scholar). In the m-state conformation fixed by BKA, the carrier easily formed intermolecular cross-links on treatment with Cu(OP)2 (in a similar manner to that without BKA), but in the c-state conformation fixed by CATR, cross-linking was completely inhibited, indicating that in the m-state, a pair of M1 loops is located in such a way that it protrudes from the membrane, whereas in the c-state, it possibly intrudes into the transport path consisting of 12 transmembrane segments of the dimeric carrier, as depicted schematically in Fig. 10. Therefore, translocation of M1 loops from the matrix side to the membrane segment should be associated with the opening and closing of the gate consisting of a pair of M1 loops, namely, the gate is open in the m-state and closed in the c-state. The findings that the loops facing the matrix side of the ADP/ATP carrier are susceptible to site-specific proteases (26Brandolin G. Boulay F. Dalbon P. Vignais P.V.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9530-9536Google Scholar) only in the m-state, but not in the c-state, support this model of open-closed transconversion of a pair of M1 loops. In addition, these changes in the location of loop M1 should be responsible for the large conformation change of the carrier between the m- and c-states monitored by its intrinsic fluorescence (29Block M.R. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 374-379Google Scholar) and by extrinsic fluorescent derivatives of ADP and ATP bound to the carrier (30Klingenberg M. Mayer I. Appel M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3650-3659Google Scholar). In a previous paper(13Majima E. Shinohara Y. Yamaguchi N. Hong Y.-M. Terada H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9530-9536Google Scholar), we proposed a transport model of ADP and ATP via the ADP/ATP carrier based on the discrete labelings of the four cysteine residues of the carrier with the maleimide SH reagent eosin 5-maleimide in the presence and absence of BKA and CATR. According to this model, the binding of the transport substrates ADP and ATP from the matrix side to their primary binding site, loop M2, causes opening of the gate formed by a pair of these loops associated with the closing of the gate consisting of a pair of M1 loops. Transport of adenine nucleotides from the matrix side to the cytosolic side is accomplished by the opening and closing of these gates, and the carrier is thereby converted from the m-state to the c-state conformation. Similarly, the binding of adenine nucleotides from the cytosolic side results in the closing of the gate consisting of a pair of M2 loops associated with the opening of the gate consisting of a pair of M1 loops. In this study, we showed that the gate consisting of a pair of M1 loops is open in the m-state conformation and closed in the c-state conformation by binding of BKA and CATR, respectively, to their primary binding site, loop M2, which is consistent with the above model. Recently, the translocation of the loop segment of the colicin Ia channel has been reported to be associated with its transport function (31Slatin S.L. Qiu X.-Q. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A. Nature. 1994; 371: 158-161Google Scholar). Based on this result, Simon (32Simon S. Nature. 1994; 371: 103-104Google Scholar) proposed that swinging of the loop(s) regulates the transport activity of this channel. Therefore, it is possible that cooperative swinging of pairs of loops of the ADP/ATP carrier is directly associated with the opening/closing of the gates, and adenine nucleotide transport is achieved by these changes. Further study to examine this possibility is under way."

This altered response to IL-6 stimulation was accompanied by a moderate increase in STAT protein activation.

To date, no studies have examined the mechanisms by which this receptor undergoes rapid homologous desensitization. Therefore, a functional hemagglutinin epitope-tagged A3AR has been stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and its regulation by the AR agonist 5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) has been studied. Cellular exposure to NECA induces rapid (t-= ∼1 min) A3AR phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues. This is associated with a functional desensitization and a 30-40% reduction in the number of high affinity agonist binding sites as determined by radioligand binding assays. Activation of second messenger-regulated kinases could not mimic the effect of NECA, suggesting a role for G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). In vitro phosphorylation assays demonstrate that phosphorylation of agonist-occupied A3ARs is enhanced by GRK2 and that cellular pretreatment with NECA dramatically inhibits subsequent GRK2-mediated phosphorylation in vitro.

Biochemical and molecular cloning studies have demonstrated the existence of four AR subtypes designated A1, A2a, A2b, and A3(1Olah M.E. Stiles G.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 581-606Google Scholar). A3AR cDNA clones were initially isolated from rat testis and brain libraries(2Meyerhof W. Muller-Brechlin R. Richter D.

Characterization of the pharmacological properties of the recombinant rat A3AR led to the realization that the A3AR is the “atypical” AR expressed in a rat mast cell-derived tumor cell line RBL-2H3(6Ali H.

Despite its relatively recent discovery, A3AR activation has already been implicated in contributing to several important physiological effects of adenosine, including vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, and cardioprotection(8Linden J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 298-306Google Scholar). Moreover, evidence has been presented to suggest that these effects are initiated by A3AR activation of mast cells, thereby leading to the release of allergic mediators that are directly responsible for the observed phenomena(8Linden J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 298-306Google Scholar). Therefore, an understanding of how A3AR signaling is regulated would be a significant advance toward controlling these events. The initial characterization of the A3AR expressed in RBL-2H3 cells demonstrated that agonist-stimulated calcium mobilization is subject to a rapid, homologous desensitization(6Ali H. Cunha-Melo J.R. Saul W.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 745-753Google Scholar, 7Ramkumar V. Stiles G.L. Beaven M.A. Ali H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16887-16890Google Scholar). However, the molecular events responsible for this effect are currently unknown. Rapid termination of signaling by G-protein-coupled receptors is typically initiated by receptor phosphorylation events catalyzed by either second messenger-activated kinases or G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs)(9Lohse M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-189Google Scholar). The latter constitute a growing family of proteins that specifically phosphorylate agonist-occupied receptors. To date, six such kinases, termed GRKs 1 through 6, have been cloned from mammalian sources but, with the exception of GRK1 (rhodopsin kinase), the spectrum of receptor substrates for each GRK in vivo remains unknown(10Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Google Scholar). To examine a role of receptor phosphorylation in regulating A3AR signaling, a functional hemagglutinin epitope-tagged rat A3AR has been expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. We report the first visualization of a recombinant A3AR and the first detailed characterization of adenosine receptor phosphorylation both in situ and in vitro. Moreover, evidence is presented that supports a role for a specific GRK isoform in mediating A3AR phosphorylation and desensitization. 125I-AB-MECA was synthesized and purified by high performance liquid chromatography as described previously(11Olah M.E. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 978-982Google Scholar). IB-MECA (12Gallo-Rodriguez C. Ji X.D. Melman N. Siegman B.D. Sanders L.H. Orlina J. Fischer B. Pu Q.L. Olah M.E. van Galen P.J.M. Stiles G.L. Jacobson K.A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 636-646Google Scholar) was the generous gift of Dr. Kenneth Jacobson (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Cell culture supplies were from Life Technologies Inc. Radionuclides were from DuPont NEN. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and biotin LC-hydrazide were from Pierce. Cellulose-coated plastic-backed chromatography plates were from Eastman Kodak Co. Monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was from Berkeley Antibody Company. Sources of other materials have been described elsewhere(11Olah M.E. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 978-982Google Scholar, 13Palmer T.M. Gettys T.W. Stiles G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16895-16902Google Scholar). The six amino acid influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope, DVPDYA, recognized by monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (14Niman H.L. Haughten R.A. Walker L.E. Reinsfeld R.A. Wilson I.A. Hogle J.M. Lerner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4949-4953Google Scholar) was inserted at both the amino and carboxyl termini of the rat A3AR by insertion of polymerase chain reaction products generated using the previously described pCMV5/rat A3AR cDNA as a template (11Olah M.E. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 978-982Google Scholar). Correct introduction of the epitope sequences was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The resulting plasmid was termed pCMV5/HA-A3AR. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines stably expressing the epitope-tagged A3AR cDNA were generated by co-transfecting cells with pCMV5/HA-A3AR and pSV2Neo in a 20:1 ratio using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation/glycerol shock procedure previously described(15Olah M.E. Ren H. Ostrowski J. Stiles G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10764-10770Google Scholar). After selection in G418, resistant colonies were isolated, expanded, and screened for receptor expression by radioligand binding using 1 nM125I-AB-MECA(11Olah M.E. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 978-982Google Scholar). Cells were propagated in T-75 flasks with Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a 37°C humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HA-A3AR-expressing CHO cells were plated into 6-well dishes at a density of approximately 1 × 106 cells/well and cultured overnight in regular media. The next day, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 90 min at 37°C with the same medium supplemented with 1 unit/ml adenosine deaminase and 200 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. After stimulation with the indicated agonists, reactions were terminated by placing the cells on ice and washing the monolayers twice with 3 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were scraped into 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of soybean trypsin inhibitor, leupeptin, and pepstatin A), transferred to microfuge tubes, and lysed by vigorous vortexing. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 10 min) and solubilized by resuspension in 150 μl of lysis buffer supplemented with 1% (w/v) SDS followed by brief sonication and heating to 65°C for 15 min. After chilling to 4°C, 600 μl of a concentrated nonionic detergent mixture was added to the solubilized membranes such that the final mix contained 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% (w/v) SDS, and 150 mM sodium chloride in lysis buffer. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 10 min), and the supernatant precleared by incubation for 1 h at 4°C with protein A-Sepharose in the presence of 0.2% (w/v) IgG-free bovine serum albumin. The precleared supernatant was then incubated for 2 h at 4°C with protein A-Sepharose and 7 μl of 12CA5 ascites. Immune complexes were isolated by centrifugation, washed twice with detergent buffer containing 0.2 M ammonium sulfate and once with detergent buffer alone, and eluted from the protein A-Sepharose by the addition of electrophoresis sample buffer and incubation at room temperature for 45 min. Analysis was by SDS-PAGE using 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide resolving gels and autoradiography. Quantitation of phosphorylation experiments was by excision from the dried gel and Cerenkov counting of bands of interest. This was performed on cells in 6-well dishes basically as described by Lisanti et al.(16Lisanti M.P. Le Bivic A. Sigiacomo M. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2117-2127Google Scholar). Briefly, cell monolayers were washed with ice-cold PBS and then treated with 10 mM sodium periodate in PBS for 30 min at 4°C in the dark. After removal of the periodate solution and further washing with PBS, cells were washed once with 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and then incubated for 30 min at 4°C with 2 mM biotin LC-hydrazide in the same buffer; this procedure labels all cell surface carbohydrate residues with biotin. Cells were then washed prior to membrane preparation and immunoprecipitation with 12CA5 as described above. After SDS-PAGE, resolved proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and nonspecific protein binding sites blocked by a 60-min incubation in blocking buffer (5% (w/v) skimmed milk solution in PBS containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.02% (w/v) thimerosal). The membrane was then incubated for 60 min at room temperature with 1 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin in a high detergent skimmed milk solution. After three washes in blocking buffer and two washes in PBS, reactive proteins were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence protocol in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Renaissance, DuPont NEN). Recombinant bovine GRK2 was purified from Sf9 cells by previously published procedures 48 h after infection with the appropriate baculovirus construct(17Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Benovic J.L. Receptor. 1993; 3: 39-55Google Scholar, 18Kanapuli P. Onorato J.J. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1099-1105Google Scholar, 19Benovic J.L. Gomez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19521-19527Google Scholar). Using light-activated rhodopsin as a substrate, the specific activity of the purified enzyme was approximately 1 μmol/min/mg protein. After treatment of HA-A3AR cells in T-75 flasks with or without agonist, incubations were terminated by placing the cells on ice, rapidly washing three times with ice-cold PBS, and scraping the cells into lysis buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 0.25 M NaCl, 10 μg/ml each of soybean trypsin inhibitor and leupeptin, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After Dounce homogenization on ice (20 strokes), membranes were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in GRK assay buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 2.5 mM EDTA, and 7.5 mM MgCl2) supplemented with 1 unit/ml adenosine deaminase and protease inhibitors for immediate use. Assays consisted of 40 μl of membrane suspension, 40 μl of kinase mixture (GRK assay buffer supplemented with 0.25 mM ATP, 0.88 mM dithiothreitol, 0.15 μM okadaic acid, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), 10 μl of vehicle or purified GRK, and 10 μl of vehicle or NECA. After incubation at 30°C for 5 min, reactions were terminated by placing the tubes on ice and adding 0.5 ml of ice-cold stop solution (0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 10 mM EDTA). Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 10 min), and the resulting pellets were solubilized in 1% (w/v) SDS prior to dilution in nonionic detergent buffer as described above. After centrifugation to remove insoluble material, detergent extracts were equalized by protein assay prior to immunoprecipitation with 12CA5 and analysis by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described above. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After overnight autoradiography, the region of the membrane corresponding to the phosphorylated HA-A3AR was excised, hydrated, and hydrolyzed at 110°C in 200 μl of 5.7 M HCl for 90 min. The resulting hydrolysate was lyophilized and resuspended in chromatography buffer supplemented with phosphoamino acid standards. After spotting onto cellulose-coated plates, samples were subjected to ascending chromatography in an isobutyric acid, 0.5 M ammonium hydroxide (5:3, v:v) buffer system(20Duclos B. Marcandier S. Cozzone A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 10-21Google Scholar). Standards were visualized by ninhydrin staining, and 32P-labeled amino acids were visualized by autoradiography. Saturation binding experiments employing 125I-AB-MECA were performed and analyzed as we have described previously(11Olah M.E. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 978-982Google Scholar, 15Olah M.E. Ren H. Ostrowski J. Stiles G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10764-10770Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase assays were performed exactly as described previously using IB-MECA(11Olah M.E. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 978-982Google Scholar). Dose-response curves were analyzed by a previously validated curve-fitting program(21DeLean A. Hancock A.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 22: 3099-3108Google Scholar). Saturation binding analysis of transfected cell membranes demonstrated that the expressed receptor bound the high affinity A3AR agonist radioligand 125I-AB-MECA with Kd and Bmax values of 2.04 ± 0.38 nM and 0.89 ± 0.38 pmol/mg, respectively (four experiments) (Fig. 1A). The Kd value observed is similar to that exhibited by the untagged rat A3AR after expression in CHO cells and by the native rat A3AR in RBL-2H3 cells (11Olah M.E. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 978-982Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase assays demonstrated that the A3AR agonist IB-MECA inhibited 5 μM forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 48.3 ± 11.3 nM, three experiments) producing a maximal inhibition of 75 ± 5% (three experiments) (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the addition of HA-epitope sequences to the A3AR fails to diminish its ability to either bind agonist radioligand with high affinity or interact productively with Gi-proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. To identify the HA-A3AR protein, we utilized the presence of three predicted sites for N-linked glycosylation within the A3AR sequence(3Zhou Q.-Y. Li C. Olah M.E. Johnson R.A. Stiles G.L. Civelli O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7432-7436Google Scholar). Cell surface carbohydrate residues were covalently labeled with biotin by sequential treatment of cell monolayers with periodate and biotin LC-hydrazide. After immunoprecipitation with 12CA5 and SDS-PAGE, immunoprecipitated glycoproteins were visualized by probing blots with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. 12CA5 specifically immunoprecipitated a 50-70-kDa glycoprotein from HA-A3AR-expressing cells but not from nontransfected CHO cells, demonstrating that this labeled protein represents the expressed HA-A3AR (Fig. 1C). This also demonstrates that HA-A3AR is appropriately processed with respect to utilization of glycosylation sites and is expressed on the cell surface, thereby rendering it accessible to agonist. To address any possible role of protein kinases in regulating A3AR signaling, we directly examined receptor phosphorylation after exposure of transfected cells to the nonselective AR agonist NECA. Fig. 2A shows that 12CA5 immunoprecipitated a 50-70-kDa phosphoprotein from transfected cells after pretreatment with 10 μM NECA for 10 min. This protein migrated exactly with the HA-A3AR as identified by biotin labeling (Fig. 1C) and was not immunoprecipitated from nontransfected CHO cells (Fig. 2A). Therefore, the HA-A3AR protein is rapidly phosphorylated upon cellular exposure to agonist. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that phosphorylation was predominantly on threonine residues with some phosphoserine also being detected but no phosphotyrosine (Fig. 2B) In an attempt to identify which kinases may be responsible, transfected CHO cells were exposed to activators of several second messenger-regulated kinases. However, activation of protein kinase C by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, Ca2+-calmodulin kinases by the calcium ionophore A23187, or cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases by forskolin and 8-bromo-cyclic GMP all failed to stimulate HA-A3AR phosphorylation under conditions in which NECA was effective (Fig. 2C). The ability of NECA to stimulate HA-A3AR phosphorylation was dose-dependent (Fig. 3A). Modelling of data pooled from three experiments produced an EC50 of 0.16 ± 0.04 μM (Fig. 3A). Time course experiments revealed that HA-A3AR phosphorylation was extremely rapid. Phosphorylation was detectable at the first time point examined (15 s) and was half-maximal by 60 s (Fig. 3B). The response was maximal by 4 min and was sustained for at least 20 min in the presence of agonist (Fig. 3B). To determine whether HA-A3AR phosphorylation was associated with changes in receptor function, transfected cells were treated with 10 μM NECA for 10 min prior to membrane preparation for radioligand binding. These experiments demonstrated that agonist pretreatment resulted in a 34 ± 10% reduction in the Bmax for 125I-AB-MECA binding (p < 0.05, four experiments) compared with untreated controls without significantly changing the Kd (control, 2.04 ± 0.38 nM, versus treated, 2.54 ± 0.10 nM, four experiments) (Fig. 4A). This reduction in agonist binding sites was associated with a desensitization of HA-A3AR function, as manifested by an 8-fold increase in the IC50 value for IB-MECA-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (Fig. 4B, Table 1). Therefore, exposure of transfected cells to agonist under conditions that promote receptor phosphorylation results in a loss of high affinity agonist binding sites and a functional desensitization.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Two observations were consistent with the hypothesis that one or more GRKs was responsible for HA-A3AR phosphorylation in situ. Firstly, phosphorylation was dependent upon the presence of agonist but not activation of second messenger-regulated kinases (Fig. 2C). Secondly, agonist treatment resulted in a reduction in high affinity agonist binding and a desensitization of HA-A3AR function (Fig. 4). Therefore, to directly assess the ability of HA-A3AR to act as a substrate for GRKs, in vitro phosphorylation experiments were performed using membranes from transfected cells and a purified recombinant GRK isoform. The effects of GRK2 on HA-A3AR phosphorylation were examined because this protein has been extensively studied, is ubiquitously expressed, and has been shown to phosphorylate G-protein-coupled receptors from several different receptor families(10Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Google Scholar). In the absence of any added GRK, membranes from transfected cells exhibited an endogenous agonist-dependent receptor kinase activity (Fig. 5). The addition of GRK2 increased the level of agonist-dependent phosphorylation by 2.4 ± 0.3-fold over that observed in its absence (three experiments, Fig. 5). No such phosphoprotein was immunoprecipitated from nontransfected cells, demonstrating that the observed protein is the HA-A3AR (Fig. 5). To determine whether the agonist-stimulated phosphorylation of HA-A3AR was indeed due to a GRK, in vitro phosphorylation experiments were performed on membranes from cells that had been pretreated with NECA under conditions that produced optimal HA-A3AR phosphorylation in situ (10 μM NECA, 10 min). Compared with membranes from cells treated without agonist, NECA pretreatment resulted in a 60% reduction in the ability of both endogenous GRK activity and exogenously added GRK2 to stimulate HA-A3AR phosphorylation in the presence of NECA in vitro (Fig. 6, A and B). Therefore, it appears that NECA pretreatment of intact cells results in the phosphorylation of HA-A3AR in situ on at least some of the residues that are phosphorylated by GRK2 in vitro. Also, agonist pretreatment resulted in the appearance of an agonist-independent component of HA-A3AR phosphorylation, which was more pronounced in reactions containing GRK2 (Fig. 6, A and B). This phenomenon was not simply a reflection of residual agonist carried over from the cellular pretreatment, because it could be diminished in a time-dependent manner with replacement of the agonist-containing media and washing of cell monolayers prior to harvest (data not shown). Therefore, it may reflect an increased susceptibility to GRK-mediated phosphorylation induced by agonist pretreatment. The presence of agonist in vitro did not significantly enhance HA-A3AR phosphorylation any further in these membranes (Fig. 6, A and B). Despite the growing appreciation of the contribution of A3AR activation toward mediating some of the physiological effects of adenosine, only limited information is available on how A3AR function is regulated. We have recently demonstrated that chronic exposure of A3AR-expressing CHO cells to the agonist NECA induces a functional desensitization that is associated with the specific down-regulation of Giα-3 and G-protein β-subunits(13Palmer T.M. Gettys T.W. Stiles G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16895-16902Google Scholar). However, the time-course of G-protein down-regulation (t-= ∼6 h) would suggest that although this event may be an important adaptive mechanism to prolonged agonist exposure, it cannot account for the rapid functional desensitization observed for the native rat A3AR in response to acute agonist treatment(6Ali H. Cunha-Melo J.R. Saul W.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 745-753Google Scholar, 7Ramkumar V. Stiles G.L. Beaven M.A. Ali H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16887-16890Google Scholar). By examining the effects of agonist exposure in CHO cells expressing a recombinant epitope-tagged A3AR, the current study now provides a testable working model with which to explain the phenomenon of rapid A3AR desensitization. The validity of the model system we have chosen is proven by two observations. Firstly, both native and recombinant epitope-tagged A3ARs undergo a rapid functional desensitization (Fig. 4B and (6Ali H. Cunha-Melo J.R. Saul W.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 745-753Google Scholar) and (7Ramkumar V. Stiles G.L. Beaven M.A. Ali H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16887-16890Google Scholar)). Secondly, in membranes from transfected CHO cells (Fig. 4A) and RBL-2H3 cells, ( (2)T. M. Palmer, unpublished data.) this desensitization is associated with a 30-40% reduction in the number of agonist binding sites recognized by 125I-AB-MECA in radioligand binding assays. Therefore, it is likely that similar adaptive processes operate to diminish A3AR signaling in CHO and RBL-2H3 cells. Several lines of evidence support a role for G-protein-coupled receptor kinase involvement in A3AR desensitization. Firstly, the A3AR is rapidly phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner, and this cannot be mimicked by simple activation of second messenger-regulated kinases alone. Moreover, the EC50 value for NECA-stimulated A3AR phosphorylation (∼0.15 μM) is essentially the same as its Ki value for displacing 125I-AB-MECA binding from the A3AR(11Olah M.E. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 978-982Google Scholar). Such a correlation between extents of receptor occupancy and phosphorylation coupled with the lack of any effect of second messenger-regulated kinases strongly suggest that one or more GRK isoforms is responsible for A3AR phosphorylation, because these kinases specifically phosphorylate agonist-occupied receptors(9Lohse M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-189Google Scholar, 10Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Google Scholar). A specific role for GRK2 or a related kinase is suggested from the in vitro phosphorylation experiments, which demonstrated that GRK2 was capable of enhancing the agonist-dependent A3AR phosphorylation observed in isolated membranes. Although it is theoretically possible that GRK2 mediates its stimulatory effect on A3AR phosphorylation in vitro indirectly via interaction with nonreceptor proteins present in the membrane preparation, this is unlikely considering the high degree of substrate specificity that GRKs exhibit toward G-protein-coupled receptors(17Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Benovic J.L. Receptor. 1993; 3: 39-55Google Scholar, 18Kanapuli P. Onorato J.J. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1099-1105Google Scholar, 19Benovic J.L. Gomez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19521-19527Google Scholar, 22Chen C.-Y. Dion S.B. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7825-7831Google Scholar, 23Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Google Scholar). Therefore, it is most likely that the agonist-occupied A3AR is directly phosphorylated by GRK2 in vitro. More importantly, pretreatment of transfected cells with agonist reduced the subsequent level of GRK2-stimulated, agonist-dependent A3AR phosphorylation observed in vitro. The simplest explanation for this phenomenon would be that agonist pretreatment induces A3AR phosphorylation in situ on some of these residues by GRK2 or a very similar kinase such that they are not available for subsequent phosphorylation in vitro. However, interpretation of these results is complicated by the observation that agonist pretreatment in situ results in an agonist-independent component of endogenous kinase- and GRK2-mediated receptor phosphorylation in vitro. Because this effect is reversible in a time-dependent manner with agonist washout, it cannot be simply due to the carry-over of residual NECA from the cellular treatment. Because agonist pretreatment would result in A3AR activation and a resulting dissociation of Gi-proteins in the proximity of the receptor, it is possible that localized release of βγ-subunits near the receptor may be sufficient to translocate sufficient GRK2 such that in the absence of agonist some receptor phosphorylation can occur. The ability of βγ-subunits alone to stimulate low level GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of antagonist-occupied β2-adrenergic receptors in vitro has been previously described(24Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor on specific residues in situ primes the receptor for subsequent agonist-independent phosphorylation in vitro. Such a sequential model of protein phosphorylation, whereby phosphorylation at specific residues is required in order to observe phosphorylation at other sites, has been well described for the kinases that control the enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism(25Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14139-14142Google Scholar). Moreover, recent experiments using synthetic peptide substrates(22Chen C.-Y. Dion S.B. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7825-7831Google Scholar), as well as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the COOH-terminal sequence of the fMet-Leu-Phe receptor (26Prossnitz E.R. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1130-1137Google Scholar), have indicated that GRK2 may utilize such a sequential phosphorylation mechanism. Cellular pretreatment with agonist does not completely abolish subsequent A3AR phosphorylation in vitro. Therefore, it seems likely that the A3AR may contain multiple sites for GRK phosphorylation with only a subset of these being utilized in CHO cells in situ such that incubation with GRK2 in vitro results in the phosphorylation of some of the remaining sites. This is not an unexpected finding because studies of GRK-mediated phosphorylation of rhodopsin and the β2-adrenergic receptor have demonstrated that although high phosphorylation stoichiometries are reported in vitro, the stoichiometries exhibited by receptors in situ are much lower(27Ohguro H. Palczewski K. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. Johnson R.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5718-5724Google Scholar, 28Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676Google Scholar). Although A3AR phosphorylation is associated with the onset of functional desensitization, we cannot directly determine whether the phosphorylated receptor is impaired in its ability to signal downstream. This will require the purification of the receptor and its reconstitution with inhibitory G-proteins in order to directly measure the receptor's signaling capacity in the absence of any other components. It is possible that additional factors, such as arrestins, are required to elicit a profound desensitization in response to GRK phosphorylation, as has been shown for rhodopsin and the human β2-adrenergic receptor(29Lohse M.J. Andexinger S. Pitcher J. Trukawinski S. Codina J. Faure J.-P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8558-8564Google Scholar). Unfortunately, we were unable to determine the stoichiometry of A3AR phosphorylation. This will be possible if either an A3AR antagonist radioligand is developed or purified preparations of HA-A3AR become available to allow us to accurately measure receptor content in 12CA5 immunoprecipitates. However, a knowledge of the A3AR sequence (3Zhou Q.-Y. Li C. Olah M.E. Johnson R.A. Stiles G.L. Civelli O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7432-7436Google Scholar) and the substrate preference for GRK2 (22Chen C.-Y. Dion S.B. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7825-7831Google Scholar, 23Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Google Scholar) can allow us to make some predictions as to where the phosphorylation sites for GRK2 may reside. Studies utilizing synthetic peptide substrates have demonstrated that GRK2 prefers to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues flanked on their NH2-terminal side by acidic amino acids and/or phosphoamino acids(22Chen C.-Y. Dion S.B. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7825-7831Google Scholar, 23Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Google Scholar). Inspection of the A3AR sequence shows that the region of the COOH-terminal domain immediately following the predicted palmitoylation site is particularly enriched in such residues (sequence reads as 305CQTSDSLDSNLEQTTE). Hence this may be a useful domain within which to begin mutagenesis experiments to determine which residues are phosphorylated by receptor kinases in situ. Perhaps more interestingly, the identification of GRK2 as an A3AR kinase in vitro, and possibly in the intact cell, as well as the association of receptor phosphorylation with desensitization, suggests that A3AR responsiveness in a given cell type may be controlled by overexpressing recombinant wild type and mutant forms of this kinase. The potential utility of such an approach has already been demonstrated for recombinant thrombin receptors co-expressed with GRK3 in Xenopus oocytes (30Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1125-1130Google Scholar) and native β2-adrenergic receptors in a human bronchial epithelial cell line after expression of a catalytically inactive GRK2 mutant that could function as a dominant negative β2-adrenergic receptor kinase(31Kong G. Penn R. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13084-13087Google Scholar). Therefore it would be of interest to determine the effects of expressing wild type and mutant GRK2 on the functioning of the native A3AR in RBL-2H3 cells and, given the synergism exhibited between the responses elicited via the A3AR and IgE receptor in these cells(6Ali H. Cunha-Melo J.R. Saul W.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 745-753Google Scholar), whether expression would affect cellular responses to antigen. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that the A3AR is rapidly phosphorylated in response to agonist exposure and that this event is associated with the onset of functional desensitization. Furthermore, in vitro phosphorylation studies strongly support a role for GRK2, or a kinase of similar substrate specificity, in mediating this phosphorylation, and these results suggest a potential strategy with which to manipulate A3AR signaling in the intact cell. Experiments to determine the usefulness of this approach and to identify the sites of A3AR phosphorylation are currently underway. We thank Drs. Mark Olah, Neil Freedman, Hydar Ali, and Teri O'Halloran for helpful discussions and Linda Scherich for preparation of the manuscript."

We have named this protein podocalyxin-like protein 1. INTRODUCTIONPodocalyxin is the major sialoprotein of the glycocalyx lining the foot processes of glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes) where it is thought to maintain foot process structure and function in part by virtue of its negative charge(1Kerjaschki D. Sharkey D.J. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1591-1596Google Scholar). Podocalyxin was first identified by Kerjaschki, Sharkey, and Farquhar (1Kerjaschki D. Sharkey D.J. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1591-1596Google Scholar) as an Alcian blue staining 140-kDa sialoprotein. Subsequent studies have shown that the negative charge is contributed by sulfate as well as by sialic acid (2Dekan G. Gabel C. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5398-5402Google Scholar) and that podocalyxin is present on the surface of endothelial cells as well as glomerular epithelial cells(3Horvat R. Hovorka A. Dekan G. Poczewski H. Kerjaschki D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 484-491Google Scholar, 4Dekan G. Miettinen A. Schnabel E. Farquhar M.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 913-927Google Scholar).The interdigitating foot processes of neighboring podocytes create the huge intercellular surface area for glomerular filtration. The importance of charge for maintenance of this structure has been demonstrated by experiments where charge neutralization with polycations or desialylation with neuraminidase is associated with loss of the interdigitating foot process structure of the podocyte(5Seiler M.W. Venkatachalam M.A. Cotran R.S. Science. 1975; 189: 390-393Google Scholar, 6Seiler M.W. Rennke H.G. Venkatachalam M.A. Cotran R.S. Lab. Invest. 1977; 36: 48-61Google Scholar, 7Andrews P.M. Kidney Int. 1979; 15: 376-385Google Scholar). Similarly, the induction of podocyte foot process effacement in rats by injection of puromycin aminonucleoside is accompanied by leakiness of the glomerular filter, podocyte foot process detachment, and a reduction in sialylation of podocalyxin(8Kerjaschki D. Vernillo A.T. Farquhar M.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 118: 343-349Google Scholar, 9Whiteside C. Prutis K. Cameron R. Thompson J. Lab. Invest. 1989; 61: 650-660Google Scholar).From these studies we have the concept of podocalyxin as an intensely negatively charged molecule present in large amounts on the podocyte foot processes and lining the surface of endothelial cells. At these sites podocalyxin may function in part by charge repulsion to maintain the distance between foot processes of neighboring cells and between circulating cells and the endothelium (“anti-adhesion molecule”). We report here the molecular structure of a transmembrane glycoprotein that we have cloned and sequenced as part of an effort to understand in molecular terms how the glomerular filter works and how it becomes dysfunctional in children and adults with the nephrotic syndrome. We have named this protein podocalyxin-like protein 1 (PCLP1).

MATERIALS AND METHODSPreparation of Monoclonal AntibodiesmAbs 5F7 and 4B3 were produced from BALB/C mice immunized with isolated rabbit glomeruli (10,000/immunization) by standard methods as described previously(10Goyal M. Wiggins R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1991; 1: 1334-1342Google Scholar). The resulting hybridomas grown out in 96-well plates were selected and subcloned based on immunofluorescence pattern assayed on cryostat sections of rabbit renal cortex.Glomerular Isolation, Protein Extraction, and Western BlotsRabbit glomeruli were isolated from New Zealand White rabbits (2.0-2.5 kg) by iron oxide magnetization as described previously(11Downer G. Phan S.H. Wiggins R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 998-1006Google Scholar). For glomerular extraction, 5 × 104 glomeruli were suspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mMN-ethylmaleimide, 2 mM EDTA, and 8 M urea and sonicated in six short bursts of 10 s as described previously(10Goyal M. Wiggins R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1991; 1: 1334-1342Google Scholar). Iron oxide and debris were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was stored at -70°C. Glomerular extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For Alcian blue staining, gels were fixed in 25% isopropanol overnight, stained with 0.1% Alcian blue in 2% acetic acid, and destained with 1% acetic acid. Blots (model SBD-1000 polyblot, American Bionetics, Hayward, CA) were performed as described previously(12Thomas P.E. Wharram B.L. Goyal M. Wiggins J.E. Holzman L.B. Wiggins R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19953-19962Google Scholar). After transfer, lanes were excised and nitrocellulose strips were incubated with 125I-wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). Some strips were preincubated with neuraminidase (0.05 units/ml) (Sigma) in 50 mM sodium acetate at 37°C for 24 h and then incubated with 125I-WGA. Western blots were incubated with the primary antibody 4B3, 5F7, or a control mAb (BB5) that does not recognize rabbit tissues. All mAbs were subclass IgG1. Alternatively blots were incubated with polyclonal guinea pig anti-PCLP1 fusion protein antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Preimmune serum from the guinea pig at the same dilution was used as a control. After a wash step, blots were incubated with 125I-anti-mouse IgG (DuPont NEN) or 125I-protein A (ICN) and then exposed for autoradiography.Immunoelectron MicroscopyGold-labeled immunoelectron microscopy was performed on paraformaldehyde-lysine periodate fixed, methanol-dehydrated, and Lowicryl K4M-embedded thin rabbit kidney cortex sections on formvar-coated nickel grids as described previously(13Whiteside C.I. Cameron R. Munk S. Levy J. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1641-1653Google Scholar). mAbs 4B3 or BB5 were used as primary antibodies, followed by a polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, Philadelphia, PA) and then gold conjugated polyclonal goat anti-rabbit antibody (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA)(14Geohegan W.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1977; 25: 1187-1200Google Scholar). Before each antibody incubation, the sections were washed and incubated for 5 min in 1.0% skim milk (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 0.01 M PBS with 0.02% polyethylene glycol 6000 and 0.02% Tween 80. The final rinse was with distilled water, and all incubations and washes were done at room temperature. Sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate and examined using a Hitachi H-7000 transmission microscope(13Whiteside C.I. Cameron R. Munk S. Levy J. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1641-1653Google Scholar).Immunoperoxidase and Immunofluorescence StudiesKidney segments (1 mm) were microwaved in 0.5% glutaraldehyde according to the protocol of Login et al. (15Login G.R. Schnitt S.J. Dvorak A.M. Lab. Invest. 1987; 57: 585-591Google Scholar). Sections (2 μm) were cut on a cryostat for subsequent analysis using the immunoperoxidase methodology according to Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). For immunofluorescence, cryostat sections of rabbit renal cortex were used. Immunoperoxidase and indirect immunofluorescence was performed using the primary antibodies described for Western blot.cDNA Library, Screening, and Sequence AnalysisTotal RNA was prepared from isolated glomeruli and renal cortex by modification of the CsCl/guanidine isocyanate method of Chirgwin et al. (16Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Google Scholar) as described previously(17Merritt S.E. Killen P.D. Phan S.H. Wiggins R.C. Lab. Invest. 1990; 63: 762-769Google Scholar). Polyadenylated RNA isolated from these preparations was used to construct random primed directional glomerular and cortical libraries in Uni-ZAP XR and Lambda ZAP II vectors through the custom library services of Stratagene, Inc. (La Jolla, CA). These libraries were screened using the 4B3 and 5F7 mAbs by the method of Young and Davis (18Young R.A. Davis R.W. Genet. Eng. 1985; 7: 29-41Google Scholar). The cDNA inserts were rescued in Bluescript SK- phagemid by the in vivo excision protocol of Stratagene or by excision and ligation into Bluescript SK- plasmid. Subsequent screens were performed using cDNA inserts as probes(19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA sequencing was done by the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger et al.(20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). For regions of high secondary structure dimethyl sulfoxide 10% (v/v) was added to the reactions(21Seto D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5905-5906Google Scholar). All clones shown were sequenced in both directions. 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed using 2 μg of glomerular RNA and a kit from Life Technologies, Inc. according to the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR product was ligated into the pAMP vector (Life Technologies Inc.) and used to transform DH5α-competent cells. Data base management and sequence analysis was done with version 8.0 of the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Data base searches were performed using the Blast Network Service from the National Center for Biotechnology Information on the “nonredundant” data base from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, Genbank, EMBL, PIR, and SwissProt data bases(22Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar).Construction and Purification of Fusion ProteinsThe fusion protein derived from the extracellular domain was prepared as follows. A region of the PCLP1 extracellular domain (bases 490-1002) was PCR-amplified using the primers TTTGAATTCGGGCGTCAGTGTCGAAGGCTT and TTTGGATCCAACACTACACCCATGACGACG. The expression vector pGEX-KT and the PCR product were digested with EcoRI and BamHI, purified, and ligated. The ligation mixture was used to transform competent Escherichia coli TG1. The reading frame was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Fusion protein expression was performed as described by Smith and Johnson(23Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar). Fusion protein purification was performed as described by Guan and Dixon(24Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Google Scholar).Immunoadsorption StudiesmAbs 4B3 and 5F7 culture supernatants were assayed by dilution using immunofluorescence intensity as an end point. In the experiment shown, mAb 4B3 (1/25 dilution in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin) was incubated with the purified PCLP1-GST fusion protein (20 μg) or a fusion protein derived from the extracellular domain of GLEPP1 (20 μg) constructed in the same fusion protein system(12Thomas P.E. Wharram B.L. Goyal M. Wiggins J.E. Holzman L.B. Wiggins R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19953-19962Google Scholar).Northern Blot AnalysiscDNA fragments were labeled with [32P]dCTP using a random prime DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Prehybridization, hybridization, and washings were carried out as described by Sambrook et al.(19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Conditions for the final wash were 0.2 × SSC at 60°C.Expression Construct, in Vitro Transcription/Translation, and Transfection ExperimentsA PCLP1 cDNA from bases 1-2943 was ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). This construct (0.5 μg) or pcDNA3 vector without insert (0.5 μg) was used for [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro transcription and translation using the TnT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI) system with and without 1.5 μl of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (Promega) in 25-μl reactions per the manufacturers protocol.For transfection experiments COS-7 cells were plated at 2.7 × 105 cells/60-mm dish overnight in DMEM (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) with 10% newborn calf serum. Cells were washed once with serum-free DMEM before DMEM with Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) 6 μl/ml and 2 μg of either the PCLP1 mammalian expression construct or pcDNA3 vector. After 6 h of incubation, one volume of DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum and 10% newborn calf serum was added. Cells were lysed and extracted at 24 h after transfection in 200 μl of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mMN-ethylmaleimide, 2 mM EDTA, and 8 M urea. Protein content of the extracts were analyzed by a modified Bradford technique (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA).Partial Purification of PCLP1 and Digestion with GlycosidasesRabbit glomerular extract from 450,000 glomeruli was prepared in 9 ml of glomerular extraction buffer (PBS containing 1% Brij 35, 2 mM EDTA, leupeptin (2 μg/ml), and aprotinin (2 μg/ml)). The extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C, and the supernatant was allowed to bind to 5 ml of wheat germ agglutinin agarose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with glomerular extraction buffer and transferred to a column, washed with 10 column volumes of PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and eluted with glomerular extraction buffer containing 120 mMN-acetyl glucosamine. The first three 5-ml fractions containing the PCLP1 were dialyzed against four changes of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and finally against distilled water. These fractions were then lyophilized, and the dry powder was dissolved in a minimum volume of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5.The wheat germ agglutinin purified fraction of PCLP1 (8 μl containing 16 μg of total protein) was mixed with 1 μl of 2% SDS and 1 μl of 1 M 2-mercaptoethanol and kept in boiling water bath for 5 min. The mixture was diluted to 200 μl in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. 20-μl aliquots of the above preparation were digested with heparinases I and II, heparitinase mix (0.5 units each), chondroitinase ABC (0.5 units), N-glycosidase F (0.4 units), O-glycosidase (2 milliunits), and neuraminidase (0.1 unit) by incubating at room temperature overnight followed by an additional 3 h at 37°C (endo-β-galactosidase and N- and O-glycosidase were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim; the other enzymes were obtained from Sigma). Multiple enzyme digestions were done similarly by adding the enzymes simultaneously to the aliquot of denatured PCLP1 buffer mix. For endo-β-galactosidase digestions, 8 μl of wheat germ agglutinin fraction was boiled as described above but diluted with sterile distilled water. Endo-β-galactosidase digestion was performed in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.8, with 5 milliunits of the enzyme. Aliquots without the addition of any enzyme incubated under identical conditions served as controls. After incubation an equal volume of 2 × SDS gel loading buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol was added, and the reaction mixtures were kept in boiling water bath for 5 min, separated on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with 4B3 and BB5 mAbs as described above.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCharacterization of mAbs 5F7 and 4B3 Recognizing PCLP1mAbs prepared from splenocytes of mice immunized against whole rabbit glomeruli were selected based upon immunofluorescent patterns on cryostat sections of rabbit renal cortex. mAbs 5F7 and 4B3 showed the following properties.Immunostaining Pattern on Cryostat Sections of Renal CortexmAbs 5F7 and 4B3 produced an intense reaction product in glomeruli and also stained endothelium of arteries, veins, and peritubular capillaries (Fig. 1a).Western BlottingBlots of extracts from isolated glomeruli developed with mAbs 5F7 and 4B3 showed a major band at 140 kDa under reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1b).Alcian Blue BindingA major band at 140 kDa was also recognized by Alcian blue (Fig. 1b).125I-WGA BindingA major band at 140 kDa was also bound by 125I-WGA on a Western blot of rabbit renal glomerular extract.Abolition of 125I-WGA Binding by Prior Neuraminidase Treatment125I-WGA binding was abolished by prior neuraminidase treatment of the blot (Fig. 1b). In all reduced gels in this experiment, a second band at lower molecular mass was recognized by each detection system, thereby providing further data that the same target molecule was being recognized by the mAb, Alcian blue, and WGA.Ultrastructural Localization of mAb Binding to Podocyte Foot Processes and EndotheliumFig. 1c shows immunogold labeling of PCLP1 localized to the nonbasement membrane surface of the epithelial foot processes and to a lesser extent the endothelial plasma membrane. No immunogold staining was observed in the absence of primary antibodies or the presence of nonspecific anti-rabbit IgG. These characteristics are identical to those defined by Kerjaschki, Sharkey, and Farquhar (1Kerjaschki D. Sharkey D.J. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1591-1596Google Scholar) for rat podocalyxin. We therefore elected to call the molecule recognized by these mAbs podocalyxin-like protein 1.Cloning and Sequencing of PCLP1 cDNAsA rabbit glomerular cDNA library was constructed in Uni-Zap XR vector and screened with mAbs 5F7 and 4B3 in a bacterial expression system. Six positive cDNA clones were isolated with overlapping nucleotide sequence. 42 additional cDNAs were obtained by using these cDNAs as probes and by anchored PCR strategies. Fig. 2(upper panel) shows in diagrammatic form nine selected overlapping cDNAs used to construct the nucleotide sequence.FIGURE 2Diagrammatic illustration of PCLP1 cDNA and derived protein structure. Top, diagrammatic representation of the cDNAs used to derive the PCLP1 nucleotide structure. Clone Jo3 is one of the cDNAs cloned with the mAbs 5F7 and 4B3. Clone RACE 10 was cloned by PCR techniques. The remainder of the cDNAs shown were obtained using labeled cDNAs as probes. All clones were sequenced in both directions. Clone GN2 contains a 60-nucleotide amino acid putative alternative splice region in the coding region (see below). Bottom, diagrammatic representation of PCLP1 protein structure derived from the nucleotide sequence and aligned with a Kyle-Doolittle amino acid hydropathy plot. A single putative 26-amino acid transmembrane region is shown (solid black box). The N-terminal domain contains a hydrophobic 21-residue putative signal peptide (horizontal striped box). In addition are shown a serine-proline-rich region (diagonal striped box), a putative alternate splice region (vertical striped box), three potential sites for N-linked glycosylation (arrows), a potential glycosaminoglycan attachment site (V), cysteines for possible disulfide linkage (C), acidic areas (lightly shaded boxes), and a highly acidic C-terminal region (darkly shaded box). The binding region for the mAbs is between amino acids 63 and 246 and is based on the distribution of the cDNAs identified with the mAbs. This region is known to be extracellular because the mAbs 4B3 and 5F7 bind to nonpermeabilized glomeruli.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Northern blot analysis was performed to determine the approximate length of the transcript and to show the pattern of mRNA tissue expression. Northern blots performed using a 3.5-kb PCLP1 clone showed a major band at approximately 5.5 kb with minor bands at 7.1 and 4.4 kb (Fig. 3). Screening of different tissues shows the relatively much greater amount of mRNA in glomerulus as compared with other tissues (Fig. 3). This relative distribution of PCLP1 mRNA is similar to PCLP1 protein distribution as assessed by immunofluorescence using the 5F7 and 4B3 mAbs.FIGURE 3Northern blot developed using a 3.5-kb PCLP1 cDNA as a probe. Glomerular RNA was loaded in lanes A (30 μg) and B (5 μg). Lanes C-H were each loaded with 30 μg of RNA from renal cortex (lane C), liver (lane D), lung (lane E), intestine (lane F), spleen (lane G), and muscle (lane H). The major transcript is at 5.5 kb, with minor bands at 4.4 and 7.1 kb. The intensity of the signal is comparable between lane B (5 μg of glomerular RNA) and lane C (30 μg of renal cortical RNA), confirming that the amount of transcript detected is highest in the glomerular RNA sample. The positions of the 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNA bands are shown (arrowheads). The blot was stained with methylene blue prior to transfer to confirm comparable loading of RNA onto lanes A and C-H with 6-fold less RNA loaded onto lane B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The full length of the nucleotides sequenced from the overlapping cDNA clones spans 5313 base pairs (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). An initiator methionine (base pairs 304-306) was identified by the following criteria, (a) The amino acid sequence was consistent with Kozak's consensus sequence (first methionine in the open reading frame, purine in position -3)(25Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Google Scholar); (b) this methionine was followed by a 21-amino acid putative signal peptide containing 12 consecutive hydrophobic amino acids (ALALAALLLLLL) (Fig. 4)(26von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4691Google Scholar); (c) the presence of numerous CpG-rich “islands” is compatible with this region being 5′-untranslated sequence (underlined in Fig. 4)(27Wolfe S.L. Molecular and Cellular Biology. Wadsworth Publishing Co., Belmont, CA1993: 708-709Google Scholar).FIGURE 4PCLP1 nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences obtained from cDNA sequencing. The initiation methionine was identified as the first ATG in the open reading frame and obeys Kozak's consensus. The underlined nucleotides in the putative 5′-untranslated region represent probable CpG regions. The underlined N-terminal 21 hydrophobic amino acids represent a putative signal peptide. The double underlined 26 hydrophobic amino acids represent a putative transmembrane region. Potential sites of N-linked glycosylation (black triangles), O-linked glycosylation (dotted underlines), glycosaminoglycan attachment (dashed underlines), and disulfide linkage (black circles) are shown. The 60-nucleic acid sequence number 1324-1383 (lowercase) was found only in clone GN2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A stop codon was found at base pairs 1957-1959, indicating the end of the open reading frame (Fig. 4). This would correspond to an open reading frame of 1653 base pairs or a total of 551 amino acids. If the putative signal peptide (21 amino acids) is cleaved off in post-translational processing, then the mature protein will be 530 amino acids long, and the N-terminal amino acid would be glutamine. This conclusion has not been confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. The putative PCLP1 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 54.9 kDa and a calculated isoelectric point of 4.8. A Blast search of the available data bases showed no significant similarities to published nucleotide or protein sequences.Analysis of the derived amino acid sequence showed a single 26-amino acid hydrophobic sequence compatible with a single transmembrane region (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). Immediately C-terminal to the putative transmembrane region are positively charged amino acids (HQRLSHRK) as is typically found at the cytoplasmic side of a transmembrane region(28Boyd D. Beckwith J. Cell. 1990; 62: 1031-1033Google Scholar). This orientation relative to the cell membrane is also supported by the fact that the clone Jo3 isolated using the mAbs codes for the region of the molecule N-terminal to the transmembrane region and that these two mAbs also bind to nonpermeabilized isolated rabbit glomeruli as assessed by immunofluorescence (data not shown). Thus the region of the molecule N-terminal to the putative transmembrane domain must be extracellular.Analysis of the Extracellular DomainAs indicated above, the N-terminal 21 amino acids of the PCLP1 open reading frame are typical of a signal peptide sequence. The remaining 429 amino acids of the extracellular region were analyzed for the presence of potential O- and N-linked glycosylation sites. Analysis of the putative PCLP1 amino acid sequence using the Motifs program of the Genetics Computer Group sequence software package indicates there are three potential sites for N-linked glycosylation (Fig. 4). One of these potential N-linked sites (amino acid 333) is flanked by leucines as has been described in chick lumican(29Blochberger T.C. Vergnes J.-P. Hempel J. Hassell J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 347-352Google Scholar). The putative PCLP1 amino acid sequence has five serine-threonine clusters providing potential acceptor sites for O-linked oligosaccharides (Fig. 4). Rat podocalyxin has been suggested to contain at least two N-linked oligosaccharide groups (8Kerjaschki D. Vernillo A.T. Farquhar M.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 118: 343-349Google Scholar) and O-linked oligosaccharide groups(1Kerjaschki D. Sharkey D.J. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1591-1596Google Scholar, 2Dekan G. Gabel C. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5398-5402Google Scholar). There is one potential glycosaminoglycan attachment site (amino acids 215-218) that contains the consensus sequence (SGXG) found in small proteoglycans(30Bourdon M.A. Krusius T. Campbell S. Schwartz N.B. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3194-3198Google Scholar). There are four other glycine-serine or serine-glycine groups that could also potentially serve as attachment sites for glycosaminoglycan chains, although they lack associated acidi"
https://openalex.org/W1608402362,"We have determined the primary structure of a novel γ subunit (γ12, previously designated γS1) of G protein purified from bovine spleen. The mature γ12 protein composed of 68 amino acids had acetylated serine at the N terminus and geranylgeranylated/carboxylmethylated cysteine at the C terminus. This was consistent with the C-terminal prenylation signal in the amino acid sequence, which was predicted from γ12 cDNA isolated from a bovine spleen cDNA library. Western blots with the specific antibody against γ12 showed that γ12 is present in all tissues examined. Among various γ subunits (γ 1, γ 2, γ 3, γ 7, and γ12), γ12 has a unique property to be phosphorylated by protein kinase C. The phosphorylated amino acid residue was Ser1 (or Ser2). The phosphorylated βγ12 associated with Goα more tightly than the unphosphorylated form. Exposure of Swiss 3T3 and aortic smooth muscle cells to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and NaF induced phosphorylation of γ12. Stimulation of aortic smooth muscle cells with natural vasoactive agents such as angiotensin II and vasopressin also induced phosphorylation of γ12. The extent of phosphorylation of βγ12in vitro was suppressed by a complex formation with Goα, which was relieved by the addition of guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) or aluminum fluoride. These results strongly suggest that γ12 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C during activation of receptor(s) and G protein(s) in living cells.

https://openalex.org/W2007858156,"The substitution of arginine at position 210 in the a subunit of Escherichia coli F0F1-ATPase by either lysine or alanine causes dominance in complementation tests with a chromosomal c subunit mutation. Reversal of dominance was achieved for the a R210K mutation but not for the a R210A mutation by the presence of an aspartic acid residue at position 50 or at position 252 in the a subunit. It was concluded that position 210 in putative helix 4 of a previously proposed model of the a subunit is close to position 252 in putative helix 5 and to position 50 in putative helix 1. The juxtaposition of residues 252 and 210 was also indicated by the observation that the double mutant a R210Q/Q252R was partially functional. A revertant of the partially functional double mutant, isolated on succinate medium, was found to contain a third mutation resulting in Pro-204 in the a subunit being replaced by threonine. That the revertant phenotype was due to the a P204T change was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. ATP synthesis in the revertant strain was at near normal levels as judged by growth yield experiments, but the revertant strain was unable to pump protons in response to ATP hydrolysis.

ATP synthesis in the revertant strain was at near normal levels as judged by growth yield experiments, but the revertant strain was unable to pump protons in response to ATP hydrolysis. The F0F1-ATPase enzyme complex catalyses the terminal step in oxidative phosphorylation and photophosphorylation and is located in mitochondrial, chloroplast, and bacterial membranes. In Escherichia coli, the enzyme comprises eight nonidentical subunits, a, b, c, α, β, γ, δ, and ɛ, encoded by the genes uncB, F, E, A, D, G, H, and C, respectively(1Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 164-200Google Scholar). The a, b, and c subunits are integral membrane proteins and form the F0 portion of the complex, which can function as a proton pore. The α, β, γ, δ, and ɛ subunits are peripheral membrane proteins forming the F1-ATPase portion of the complex, which retains ATP hydrolytic activity when removed from the membrane. The a, b, and c subunits of the proton pore are present in a stoichiometry of 1:2:6-12(2Senior A.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 7-41Google Scholar), and all are required for proton translocation. Residues essential for proton translocation have been found in the a and c subunits(2Senior A.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 7-41Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the proton pore involves four amino acids: Arg-210, Glu-219, and His-245 on the a subunit and Asp-61 on the c subunit(3Howitt S.M. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 74-80Google Scholar). Of these, only Arg-210 is absolutely conserved, but all c subunits contain an acidic residue equivalent to Asp-61. In E. coli, neither Arg-210 nor Asp-61 can be substituted by other residues without complete loss of proton-coupled ATP synthesis(4Lightowlers R.N. Howitt S.M. Hatch L. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894: 399-406Google Scholar, 5Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10043-10050Google Scholar, 6Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol.

The remaining two residues required for proton translocation are not strictly conserved, and some amino acid substitutions at either position retain some proton translocating activity(4Lightowlers R.N. Howitt S.M. Hatch L. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894: 399-406Google Scholar, 5Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10043-10050Google Scholar, 6Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J.

Acta. 1988; 933: 241-248Google Scholar). In order to understand the mechanism of proton translocation, information on the positions of these essential residues is required. There is a considerable body of evidence indicating that the c subunit forms a helical hairpin structure, placing Asp-61 in the center of the membrane (for review, see (12Fillingame R.H. Krulwich T.A. The Bacteria: A Treatise on Structure and Function. Vol XII. Academic Press Inc., New York1990: 346-391Google Scholar)). However, the structure of the a subunit is less clear, with a number of different models being proposed(2Senior A.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 7-41Google Scholar, 13Cox G.B. Fimmel A.L. Gibson F. Hatch L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 849: 62-69Google Scholar, 14Howitt S.M. Cox G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 9799-9803Google Scholar, 15Vik S.B. Dao N.N. Biochim.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 31-34Google Scholar). These models differ in the positioning, within the membrane, of the amino acid residues essential for proton translocation. The use of site-directed mutagenesis in combination with analysis of second site revertants has proved a powerful tool in investigations of structure and function. For example, the finding that the essential aspartic acid residue in the c subunit can be moved to position 24 on the other helix and still retain some activity provides confirmation of the hairpin structure of the c subunit(18Miller M.J. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4900-4904Google Scholar). We have previously identified amino acid changes in second-site mutants that suppress dominance of the a subunit mutant in which Arg-210 is replaced by lysine(14Howitt S.M. Cox G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 9799-9803Google Scholar). Analysis of these revertants suggested that position 50 on putative helix 1 was adjacent to Arg-210 on helix 4 in the five-transmembrane helix model of the a subunit(14Howitt S.M. Cox G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 9799-9803Google Scholar). In the present study, we have extended this work to show that Arg-210 is also close to position 252 on putative helix 5. Furthermore, the residues at positions 210 and 252 can be exchanged with partial retention of function. All chemicals and enzymes used were of the highest quality commercially available.

Snoswell A.M. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. J. 1970; 117: 551-562Google Scholar). The minimal salts medium in the fermenters was supplemented with 5% (v/v) Luria broth(23Luria S.E. Burrous J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1957; 74: 461-476Google Scholar). Turbidities of cultures were measured with a Klett-Summerson colorimeter. Growth yields were measured as turbidities after growth had ceased in minimal medium containing limiting (5 mM) glucose and supplemented with 5% Luria broth as well as specific requirements.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Single-stranded “template” DNA was prepared as described for the oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis system (Amersham Corp.). Replicative form DNA and plasmid DNA were prepared by the alkaline lysis method(24Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 1: 1513-1523Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA for sequencing was prepared as described by Messing(25Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 20-89Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was carried out using the Amersham oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis system. The method used was that described in Ref. 42. The oligonucleotide primers were designed to be between 17 and 25 nucleotides in length, to contain the mutant sequence approximately in the middle, and to have GC-rich N and C termini. The mutant codons are shown in Table 1. Single-stranded template was derived from the replicative from of M13mp18 in which a 2.4-kilobase HindIII/EcoRI fragment carrying the uncB, uncE, uncF, and uncH genes was cloned into the multiple cloning site. The presence of each mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain-terminating method of Sanger et al.(26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). The USB T7 sequenase kit version 2.1 and 35S-labeled dATPαS were used. A 2.2-kilobase HindIII/ClaI fragment carrying the mutated uncB gene as well as the uncE and uncF genes was subcloned from the recombinant M13mp18 replicative form into the vector pAN174, as described previously(3Howitt S.M. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 74-80Google Scholar). The correct plasmid was identified where possible as one that conferred on a strain with a chromosomal mutation in the b subunit AN1440 (uncF469) (27Jans D.A. Hatch L. Fimmel A.L. Gibson F. Cox G.B. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 764-770Google Scholar) the ability to grow on succinate minimal medium. In the cases where no succinate positive colonies were obtained and it was suspected that the mutation in the uncB gene might exert a dominant effect on complementation of the uncF gene, approximately 50 colonies isolated from the nonselective plate (glucose nutrient medium with chloramphenicol) were sectored onto succinate minimal and glucose nutrient medium. After 3 days, colonies showing no background growth on succinate but a large number of revertants were subcultured from the corresponding nutrient plate and retained for further study. In all cases, the presence of the correct insert was confirmed by restriction analysis. At least three independent isolates, with the correct restriction pattern were characterized in each case. Plasmids containing the correct insert were then used to transform strains AN727 (uncB402) and strain AN943 (uncE429). Several independent isolates from each transformation were compared for growth characteristics and growth yield on limiting glucose. One typical isolate was retained for biochemical studies. Two control plasmids were also transformed into appropriate background strains; a coupled control in which wild-type uncB, uncE and uncF genes were subcloned into pAN174 as described and an uncoupled control consisting of the vector pAN174. The growth of the cells in 10-liter fermenters, fractionation, and subsequent washing procedures have all been described previously(28Cox G.B. Jans D.A. Gibson F. Langman L. Senior A.E. Fimmel A.L. Biochem. J. 1983; 216: 143-150Google Scholar). Mg-ATPase activity was determined as described previously(29Hatch L. Fimmel A.L. Gibson F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 183-189Google Scholar). Inhibition of membrane-bound ATPase activity was determined by assaying the membranes after dialysis to release the bound ATPase(28Cox G.B. Jans D.A. Gibson F. Langman L. Senior A.E. Fimmel A.L. Biochem. J. 1983; 216: 143-150Google Scholar). The dicyclohexylcarbodiimide sensitivity of membrane bound Mg-ATPase was determined by sampling at timed intervals a reaction mixture containing membranes, reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM ATP, pH 8.0) and 12 μg/ml dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.9 ml of the above reaction mixture to 100 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid on ice. The ATPase activity was determined by the use of King's reagent to measure inorganic phosphate released(30King E.J. Biochem. J. 1932; 26: 292-297Google Scholar). Atebrin fluorescence quenching activities were measured as described previously(21Gibson F. Cox G.B. Downie J.A. Radik J. Biochem. J. 1977; 164: 193-198Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using Folin's phenol reagent with bovine serum albumin as standard(31Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). A mutant in which lysine was substituted for Arg-210 in the a subunit of the E. coli ATP synthase was found previously to be unable to translocate protons. Unexpectedly, a plasmid carrying this mutation, along with wild-type genes encoding the c and b subunits, failed to complement a chromosomal c subunit mutation(14Howitt S.M. Cox G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 9799-9803Google Scholar). Second-site mutations were obtained that were able to complement a chromosomal c subunit mutation, and among these was a G53D mutation(14Howitt S.M. Cox G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 9799-9803Google Scholar). Further experimentation indicated that an aspartate at positions 50 or 46 had the same effect, whereas substitutions on other faces of a putative helix had little or no effect(14Howitt S.M. Cox G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 9799-9803Google Scholar). It was concluded that the effect was due to a salt bridge formed between the aspartate at positions 46, 50, or 53 and the lysine at position 210 and that putative helix 1 of a previously proposed model (3Howitt S.M. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 74-80Google Scholar) was close to helix 4. Helices 3 and 5 in addition to helix 1, flank helix 4 in the proposed model (3Howitt S.M. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 74-80Google Scholar) and it was therefore of interest to see if aspartate residues in appropriate positions in helices 3 or 5 could overcome the dominant effect of the R210K mutation. A series of mutagenesis experiments was carried out in order to substitute aspartate residues for amino acids 252-257 in helix 5 and amino acids 156-168 in helix 3 (see Table 1). Plasmids carrying these mutations along with wild-type uncE and uncF genes were transformed into a strain with a chromosomal c subunit mutation AN943(uncE429). Substitutions in particular positions in both helices did overcome the dominant effect of the R210K mutation as judged by growth yield determinations. Helical periodicity was observed in helix 3 but not in helix 5 (Fig. 1). There were substitutions in three positions that resulted in almost complete reversal of the dominance of the R210K mutation. These positions were 163 in helix 3, and 252 and 253 in helix 5. Aspartic acid at position 163 may form a salt bridge with Lys-167 since these two residues are one turn of a helix apart, and this interaction may be responsible for the reversal of dominance. To exclude this possibility, both Lys-167 and Lys-169 were replaced by glutamine in the presence of the R210K and F163D mutations. The K167Q/K169Q double mutation had previously been shown to have no effect on ATP synthase function(4Lightowlers R.N. Howitt S.M. Hatch L. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894: 399-406Google Scholar). The strain carrying the four mutations showed the same reversal of dominance as the R210K/F163D double mutant. This indicated that this phenotype was not due to a charge pair between aspartic acid at 163 and lysine at 167. It is possible, however, that an aspartate residue in any of the positions 163, 252, or 253, or indeed in position 50, is exerting its effect directly and not via salt bridge formation with lysine at position 210. The R210A mutation was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and subcloned, along with genes encoding the wild-type c and b subunits, into the vector pAN174. This plasmid was used to transform a strain carrying a chromosomal a subunit mutation (AN727 uncB402). The resultant strain was unable to grow on succinate and gave an uncoupled growth yield on a growth-limiting concentration of glucose (see Table 3). Membranes prepared from the R210A mutant strain, surprisingly, appeared to have proton-leaky membranes, as judged by NADH-dependent atebrin fluorescence quenching activity (see Table 3). The ATPase activity was the same as the coupled control.TABLE III Open table in a new tab The R210A mutation was similar to the R210K mutation in that it was found to be dominant in complementation tests with a chromosomal c subunit mutant. If the reversal of dominance by aspartate at positions 50, 163, and 252 in the R210K mutant was due to salt bridge formation with lysine, then reversal of dominance should not be achieved in the R210A mutant. Reversal of dominance did not occur in the R210A/V50D or the R210A/Q252D double mutants, but it did occur in the R210A/F163D double mutant (Table 2). The F163D mutation is therefore exerting its effect directly. These results suggest that position 210 is close to positions 252 and 50 but not to position 163. Helix 4 is therefore oriented in such a way that Arg-210 is close to helix 5 rather than to helix 3. Such an orientation would also mean that Glu-219 and His-245 do not directly interact(10Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6606-6612Google Scholar).TABLE II Open table in a new tab If Arg-210 is close to Gln-252, then it might be possible to switch these two residues and retain function. Plasmids were therefore prepared that carried the a subunit mutations R210Q or Q252R or the double mutation R210Q/Q252R. These plasmids were used to transform a strain with a chromosomal a subunit mutation AN727 (uncB402). As expected(4Lightowlers R.N. Howitt S.M. Hatch L. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894: 399-406Google Scholar), the R210Q mutant was unable to grow on succinate as sole carbon source (Fig. 2). However, both Q252R and the double mutant R210Q/Q252R were able to grow on succinate (Fig. 2), although not at the wild-type rate. These results indicate that the ATP synthase is at least partially functional, and this was confirmed by the values obtained for growth yields (Table 3). The Q252R mutant gave a slight increase in growth yield compared with the vector control. The R210Q mutant gave a lower growth yield than the vector control but was significantly increased when the R210Q mutation was combined with the Q252R mutation. Membranes were prepared from each of the three strains and assayed for ATPase activity and atebrin fluorescence-quenching activity. The ATPase activities indicated that there was a somewhat reduced assembly in each of the mutant strains, with the R210Q/Q252R double mutant the most severely affected (Table 3). This double mutant also gave the largest inhibition of ATPase activity when F1 was bound to the membranes (see Table 3). ATP-dependent fluorescence quenching was absent in the R210Q mutant, as found previously(4Lightowlers R.N. Howitt S.M. Hatch L. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894: 399-406Google Scholar), and was also essentially absent in the R210Q/Q252R double mutant (Table 3). The Q252R mutant showed a low ATP-dependent atebrin fluorescence quenching activity (Table 3). The R210Q/Q252R double mutant grows slowly on succinate media (see Fig. 2). Revertant colonies appeared at high frequency on prolonged incubation. Many such revertants were isolated, and one was found to carry the reversion on the plasmid. The plasmid-borne revertant caused wild-type growth on succinate media (see Fig. 2). The uncB gene on the revertant plasmid was sequenced and in addition to the mutations causing the R210Q and Q252R substitutions a C at position 610 was replaced by an A. This resulted in a CCA codon being changed to an ACA codon, and the proline residue at position 204 being replaced by threonine. The growth yield of the revertant strain on limiting glucose was increased compared with the parental R210Q/Q252R double mutant (Table 3) to a near wild-type level. The level of ATPase activity in membrane preparations was increased compared with the parental double mutant, but this was due to less inhibition of activity on binding to the membrane (Table 3), and there was essentially no ATP-dependent atebrin fluorescence quenching activity. The reversion therefore exerts its effect in the direction of ATP synthesis rather than in the direction of ATP-dependent proton pumping. However the measurement of atebrin fluorescence quenching activity was carried out using an in vitro system, and for this mutant, proton pumping activity may have been lost during the preparation of membranes. In order to confirm that the phenotype of the revertant was due to the P204T mutation (and not some other undetected change in the c or b subunit) a plasmid was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis that carried the three identified changes in the a subunit, namely R210Q, Q252R, and P204T. When transformed into AN727 the resulting strain had identical properties to the spontaneously occurring revertant strain. The P204T mutation alone was also prepared by site-directed mutagenesis and was similar to wild-type (Table 3), although the ATP-dependent atebrin fluorescence quenching activity was about 50% of the coupled control. The arginine residue at position 210 of the a subunit of the E. coli ATP synthase is absolutely conserved and is essential for proton-coupled ATP synthesis. Previously, evidence had been obtained that position 210 was close to position 50 in the folded a subunit structure(14Howitt S.M. Cox G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 9799-9803Google Scholar). The work described here leads to the conclusion that position 210 is also close to position 252. If this is the case, then it would preclude any direct interaction between His-245 and Glu-219 (10Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6606-6612Google Scholar) but would be consistent with a close interaction between Gly-218 and His-245 (32Hartzog P.E. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32313-32317Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3). The evidence for the latter interaction would appear to be stronger in that the double mutant G218K/H245G is essentially wild-type(32Hartzog P.E. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32313-32317Google Scholar), whereas the double mutant E219H/H245E is only marginally different in energy coupling from the H245E mutant(10Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6606-6612Google Scholar). Furthermore the E219H mutant can be changed from essentially uncoupled to fully coupled by a second mutation R140H(33Howitt S.M. Lightowlers R.N. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 264-268Google Scholar), which is also consistent with this face of helix 4 being close to helix 3 rather than helix 5. The positions of these residues in a five-helix model of the a subunit are shown in Fig. 3. Arg-210 is placed close to position 50 in helix 1 and position 252 in helix 5 and is also able to interact with Asp-61 in the c subunit. The other two residues required for proton translocation, Glu-219 and His-245 of the a subunit, are also placed where they can interact with the c subunit Asp-61. The a subunit helices are positioned such that Arg-210 and Glu-219 are able to interact with the Asp-61 of different c subunits. Work described by Vik and Antonio (34Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Google Scholar) is difficult to rationalize with this model in that they have concluded that position 252 is close to 219. They found that the double mutants Q252E/E219G and Q252E/E219K were functional. However Q252E alone is also functional so it might be that lysine or glycine at position 219 can functionally replace glutamate or allow other residues to take over that role even when the wild-type residue glutamine is at position 252. The other difference between the data reported by Vik and Antonio (34Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Google Scholar) and that reported in the present work is the effect of the replacement of Gln-252 by arginine. Their finding that the Q252R mutant was unable to grow on succinate may be due to different background strains used. The retention of function after switching residues 210 and 252, albeit at a reduced level, is strong evidence for the juxtaposition of Arg-210 and Gln-252. The result is directly analogous to that obtained by Miller et al.(18Miller M.J. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4900-4904Google Scholar) when they demonstrated retention of function in a mutant in which the essential aspartate at position 61 in the c subunit was shifted to position 24. A further similarity between the Asp-61 shift in the c subunit and the Arg-210 shift in the a subunit is the ability to improve function by additional mutations in helix 4 of the a subunit (35Fraga D. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2562-2567Google Scholar). The major difference between the Asp-61 shift and the Arg-210 shift is the observation that in the latter case ATP-dependent proton pumping is lost, whereas ATP synthesis is retained. In the Asp-61 shift experiments, both of these activities were retained(18Miller M.J. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4900-4904Google Scholar). This difference may be rationalized by a consideration of the different positions the c subunit Asp-61 and the Arg-210 of the a subunit occupy in the proton-translocating pathway. It would appear that the c subunit Asp-61 is located at about the center of the bilayer (12Fillingame R.H. Krulwich T.A. The Bacteria: A Treatise on Structure and Function. Vol XII. Academic Press Inc., New York1990: 346-391Google Scholar) and is intimately involved in the movement of protons in both directions. Evidence has been obtained that a subunit residues Glu-219 and His-245 are also involved in proton translocation, and it has been proposed that Arg-210 interacts with the c subunit Asp-61 from the opposite side of the bilayer to the residues Glu-219 and His-245(14Howitt S.M. Cox G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 9799-9803Google Scholar). The results reported in the present work would indicate that Arg-210 of the a subunit is placed between the cytoplasm and the c subunit Asp-61. Thus Arg-210 would normally receive protons for transfer to Asp-61 during ATP hydrolysis, but the shift of the arginine residue has disrupted the pathway, presumably within the a subunit, by which the proton reaches Arg-210 from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. This disruption would not affect ATP synthesis since the movement of protons from the periplasm to the c subunit Asp-61 via His-245 and Glu-219 of the a subunit would proceed normally and arginine at position 252 is still able to interact with Asp-61 of the c subunit. Given that there are 6-12 c subunits and one a subunit and that the Asp-61 in each c subunit is required for activity(36Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3896-3903Google Scholar), movement of the a subunit with respect to the c subunits is also required for activity. If the movement is a rotation of the a subunit within a ring of c subunits(13Cox G.B. Fimmel A.L. Gibson F. Hatch L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 849: 62-69Google Scholar), then it is reasonable that, despite the considerable shift in the position of the key arginine residue, some function could be retained provided that the new position is in the same plane of the membrane. The same argument would apply to the shift in the aspartate residue in the c subunit from position 61 to position 24(18Miller M.J. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4900-4904Google Scholar). The concept of rotation now forms the basis of many models for the mechanism of the ATP synthase.(34Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Google Scholar, 37Boyer P.D. Kohlbrenner W.E. Selman B. Selman-Reiner S. Energy Coupling in Photosynthesis. Elsevier, Amsterdam1981: 231-240Google Scholar, 38Cross R.L.

Due to an overlapping substrate specificity, multiple forms of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent aminotransferases are apparently able to catalyze this reaction(1Deshmukh D.R. Mungre S.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 761-768Google Scholar). Differences probably exist in the various tissues and among different animal species regarding which enzyme form is predominantly responsible for the biosynthesis of kynurenic acid. A soluble form of KAT has recently been identified and cloned from rat(2Mosca M. Cozzi L. Breton J. Speciale C. Okuno E. Schwarcz R. Benatti L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 21-24Google Scholar, 3Alberati-Giani D. Malherbe P. Köhler C. Lang G. Kiefer V. Cesura A.M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1448-1455Google Scholar), and it was found that the amino acid sequence of this pyruvate-preferring form of KAT is identical to that reported for rat kidney cysteine S-conjugate β-lyase(4Perry S.J. Schofield M.A. MacFarlaine M. Lock E.A. King L.J. Gibson G.G. Goldfarb P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 660-665Google Scholar), also referred to as glutamine transaminase K (GTK, EC 2.6.1.64)(5Cooper A.J.L. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 27: 71-113Google Scholar). The human form of this aminotransferase with KAT, GTK, and β-lyase activity has also been cloned and shown to have 82% amino acid similarity to the rat protein(6Perry S. Harries H. Schofield C. Lock T. King L. Gibson G. Goldfarb P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 277-280Google Scholar).In rat kidney, a 2-oxoglutarate-preferring aminotransferase with KAT activity has also been described. This protein corresponds to α-aminoadipate aminotransferase (AadAT, EC 2.6.1.39), an enzyme involved in the metabolism of lysine (1Deshmukh D.R. Mungre S.M. Biochem.

Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 309-379Google Scholar)), particular attention has recently been devoted to the presence of KAT isoenzymes in cerebral tissues. Kynurenic acid is, in fact, an antagonist at the glycine site of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, and increased levels of kynurenic acid may exert a neuroprotective action in some pathological conditions(11Carpenedo R. Chiarugi A. Russi P. Lombardi G. Carlà V. Pellicciari R. Mattoli L. Moroni F. Neuroscience. 1994; 61: 237-244Google Scholar). Two different aminotransferases able to produce kynurenic acid appear to be present in human brain (12Okuno E. Nakamura M. Schwarcz R. Brain Res. 1991; 542: 307-312Google Scholar, 13Schmidt W. Guidetti P. Okuno E. Schwarcz R. Neuroscience. 1993; 55: 177-184Google Scholar, 14Baran H. Okuno E. Kido R. Schwarcz R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 730-738Google Scholar). A cDNA clone from rat brain encoding an aminotransferase with KAT activity has been recently isolated(3Alberati-Giani D. Malherbe P. Köhler C. Lang G. Kiefer V. Cesura A.M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1448-1455Google Scholar), and it has been found that this protein corresponds to the rat kidney β-lyase/GTK enzyme cloned by Perry et al.(4Perry S.J. Schofield M.A. MacFarlaine M. Lock E.A. King L.J. Gibson G.G. Goldfarb P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 660-665Google Scholar). Rat brain also contains a mitochondrial form of this aminotransferase, which differs from cytosolic KAT/GTK exclusively for the presence of an NH2-terminal leader peptide, which targets the protein to the mitochondrial matrix(15Malherbe P. Alberati-Giani D. Köhler C. Cesura A.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 141-144Google Scholar). Whereas it has been claimed that in rats, a single pyruvate-preferring enzyme with KAT activity may be of physiological relevance in the cerebral synthesis of kynurenic acid(16Okuno E. Du F. Ishikawa T. Tsujimoto M. Nakamura M. Schwarcz R. Kido R. Brain Res. 1990; 534: 37-44Google Scholar, 17Okuno E. Schmidt W. Parks D.A. Nakamura M. Schwarcz R. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 533-540Google Scholar), whether in rat brain other aminotransferase forms are involved in the biosynthesis of kynurenic acid remains to be established. Noteworthy, the presence of AadAT activity has also been described in rat brain (see (18Huck S. Grass F. Hörtnagl H. J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 2650-2657Google Scholar) and references therein), therefore suggesting that this aminotransferase may represent a second synthetic enzyme for kynurenic acid in the central nervous system of this animal species.In the present work, we describe the molecular cloning and the functional expression of a soluble aminotransferase from rat kidney displaying both KAT and AadAT activity (KAT/AadAT).MATERIALS AND METHODSEnzymatic Activity DeterminationKAT activity was assayed as described previously(3Alberati-Giani D. Malherbe P. Köhler C. Lang G. Kiefer V. Cesura A.M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1448-1455Google Scholar). For routine analysis, aliquots of the enzyme preparation were incubated (1 h at 37°C) in the presence of 1 mML-kynurenine and 1 mM 2-oxoglutarate in a final volume of 200 μl of 150 mM Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 70 μM PLP. Kynurenic acid formed was quantified by HPLC with spectrophotometric detection at 330 nm(3Alberati-Giani D. Malherbe P. Köhler C. Lang G. Kiefer V. Cesura A.M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1448-1455Google Scholar). 3-Hydroxykynurenine aminotransferase activity was determined using L-3-hydroxykynurenine as substrate and by measuring the production of xanthurenic acid by HPLC with UV detection at 340 nm.AadAT activity was assayed as described in (19Nakatani Y. Fujioka M. Higashino K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 198: 219-228Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation of the enzyme preparation in the presence of 1.7 mM 2-oxoadipate and 16.7 mML-glutamate, 2-oxoglutarate formed was measured using the glutamate dehydrogenase assay. Aminotransferase activity toward other L-amino acids was measured essentially as described previously(14Baran H. Okuno E. Kido R. Schwarcz R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 730-738Google Scholar).Kinetic constants were calculated by fitting the experimental data to Michaelis-Menten equation using a computer program (Ultrafit, Biosoft).Purification of KAT/AadAT from Rat KidneyRat kidneys were homogenized in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (containing 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 μM PLP, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin), with an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer. After centrifugation at 45,000 × g, the supernatant was subjected to heat treatment (1 min at 60°C) and to ammonium sulfate fractionation. The protein was then purified by chromatography on Fast-Flow DEAE-Sepharose 6B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), followed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose and by ion exchange on a Mono Q HR 5/5 FPLC column (Pharmacia). KAT/AadAT was eventually submitted to chromatofocusing on a Mono P FPLC column (Pharmacia) (see legend to Fig. 1).Protein content was measured by the Pierce Coomassie Plus protein assay kit.Rat Kidney KAT/AadAT Digestion, Peptide Mapping, and Amino Acid SequencingThe purified protein (∼100 μg) was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel-electrophoresis on a 12.5% mini-gel and subsequently electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-Psq, Millipore) (20Malherbe P. Köhler C. Da Prada M. Lang G. Kiefer V. Schwarcz R. Lahm H.-W. Cesura A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13792-13797Google Scholar). After Ponceau S staining, digestion of blotted KAT/AadAT with modified trypsin (Promega, Zürich, Switzerland) and extraction of the resulting peptides were performed as described previously(20Malherbe P. Köhler C. Da Prada M. Lang G. Kiefer V. Schwarcz R. Lahm H.-W. Cesura A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13792-13797Google Scholar, 21Bauw G. Van Damme J. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Gesser B. Ratz G.P. Lauridsen J.B. Celis J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7701-7705Google Scholar). KAT/AadAT tryptic peptides were then separated by reverse-phase HPLC (for details on the chromatographic conditions used, see (3Alberati-Giani D. Malherbe P. Köhler C. Lang G. Kiefer V. Cesura A.M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1448-1455Google Scholar)) and directly subjected to amino acid sequence analysis by means of an Applied Biosystem model 475A protein sequenator (Forster City, CA) with on-line phenylthiohydantoin-derivative detection.Preparation of Poly(A)+ RNATotal RNA was extracted from different adult rat tissues by the guanidinium isothiocyanate/cesium chloride method(22Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. Mac Donald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was obtained by two purification cycles on oligo(dT)-cellulose spun columns (Pharmacia).Isolation of Rat Kidney KAT/AadAT cDNA by RT-PCRRT reactions were carried out in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dATP, 1 mM dCTP, 1 mM dGTP, 1 mM dTTP, 20 units of RNase inhibitor, 100 pmol of antisense primer, 1 μg of rat kidney poly(A)+ RNA, and 50 units of cloned Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Perkin Elmer Corp.), in a final volume of 20 μl at 42°C for 60 min. PCR was performed in a final volume of 100 μl containing 20 μl of the reverse transcription reaction, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dATP, 0.2 mM dCTP, 0.2 mM dGTP, 0.2 mM dTTP, 100 pmol of sense primer, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer). Cycling was performed at 95°C (1 min), 56°C (1 min), and 72°C (1 min) for 35 cycles. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies Inc. (The Woodlands, TX).The final PCR product was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel. The major band of 1058 base pairs (bp) was cut from the gel, subcloned into the SmaI site of the vector pBC/CMV(23Bertocci B. Miggiano V. Da Prada M. Dembic Z. Lahm H.-W. Malherbe P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1416-1420Google Scholar), and sequenced.Screening of cDNA LibraryA rat kidney cDNA library (Uni-ZAP™XR) was purchased from Stratagene and screened following previously described procedures (24Huynh T.V. Young R.A. Davies R.W. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1984: 49-78Google Scholar). Colonies were grown overnight on duplicate nitrocellulose filters (HA 0.45 μm, Millipore). After prehybridization for 4 h at 42°C, the filters were hybridized with a 32P-labeled nick-translated 1058-bp rat kidney cDNA probe (5•105 cpm/ml) for 16 h in 6 × NET solution (900 mM NaCl, 90 mM Tris-HCl, 6 mM EDTA, pH 8.3), 10 × Denhardt's solution (0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Ficoll, 0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone), 20% deionized formamide, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1% SDS, 100 mM ATP, 7 μg/ml poly(A)+ RNA, 6 μg/ml Escherichia coli DNA, and 500 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Following washing for 30 min at room temperature in 6 × SSC (900 mM NaCl, 90 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and a 1-h wash in 6 × SSC containing 0.5% SDS, the filters were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat™AR film with intensifying screens.From a total of ∼9 × 105 plaques, 10 positive clones were obtained and purified through an additional round of screening at lower plaque density. Bluescript plasmids (pBSK, Stratagene), carrying the cDNA inserts, were then isolated from positive phages via in vivo excision.DNA SequencingAll DNA sequences were determined by the method of Sanger et al.(25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar), as modified for plasmid double-stranded DNA sequencing (Sequenase version 2.0; U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequencing from the plasmid vectors, T3 and T7 Bluescript primers, and a set of consecutive inner primers were used. DNA sequence assembly, analysis, and translation were performed using the Gene Jockey 1.3 software package (Biosoft Ltd., Cambridge, Unite Kingdom).Northern Blot AnalysisPoly(A)+ RNAs (3 μg) isolated from various rat tissues were electrophoresed on a 1.1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. After vacuum blotting (PosiBlot, Stratagene) onto an Amersham Hybond-N® filter (Amersham Life Science, Little Chalfont, UK, RPN 1520N), RNAs were then cross-linked by UV irradiation. After prehybridization for 3 h at 42°C, the RNA blot was hybridized for 20 h with a 32P-labeled nick-translated rat kidney cDNA probe (106 cpm/ml) in 50% deionized formamide, 5 × SSC (750 mM NaCl, 75 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 50 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The filters were washed once with 2 × SSC (300 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0) for 30 min at room temperature and finally with 1 × SSC (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0) containing 0.5% SDS for 1 h at 55°C.Expression of Recombinant Rat Kidney KAT/AadAT in HEK-293 CellsThe 1.8-kilobase cDNA insert encoding rat kidney KAT/AadAT was subcloned into the blunt-ended SmaI site of the expression vector pBC/CMV(23Bertocci B. Miggiano V. Da Prada M. Dembic Z. Lahm H.-W. Malherbe P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1416-1420Google Scholar), placing transcription of the cDNA under control of the strong immediate early promoter of human cytomegalovirus. Human embryonic kidney fibroblast cells (HEK-293 cell line, ATCC CRL 1573) were transfected with sense and antisense cDNA as described previously(20Malherbe P. Köhler C. Da Prada M. Lang G. Kiefer V. Schwarcz R. Lahm H.-W. Cesura A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13792-13797Google Scholar). 2 days after transfection, the cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at -80°C until analysis. For activity determination of the recombinant enzyme, the transfected cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 15 mM Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.0 (containing 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 50 μM PLP), and homogenized in a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica AG). After centrifugation at 28,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, aliquots of the supernatant were assayed for enzymatic activity as described above.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPurification of Rat Kidney KAT/AadAT and Internal Peptide SequencingKAT/AadAT was purified from rat kidney following the procedure described in Table 1. The purification of the enzyme was monitored by measuring KAT activity in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate, its preferred aminoacceptor. The purified enzyme also displayed AadAT activity with a specific activity of 9.4 μmol min-1 mg protein-1. After chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, this aminotransferase form was well separated from KAT/GTK, a distinct enzyme with KAT activity and preference for pyruvate as cosubstrate (Fig. 1). In accordance with previous reports on rat kidney KAT isoforms(9Hartline R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 664-672Google Scholar, 26Mawal M.R. Mukhopadhyay A. Deshmukh D.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 595-599Google Scholar), FPLC chromatofocusing indicated pI values of approximately 6.4 and 5.4 for KAT/AadAT and KAT/GTK, respectively (see also (3Alberati-Giani D. Malherbe P. Köhler C. Lang G. Kiefer V. Cesura A.M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1448-1455Google Scholar)). The native molecular mass of KAT/AadAT was in the 90-100-kDa range (as determined by gel filtration on a Pharmacia Superose 12 FPLC column) and was composed of two subunits of equal size. In fact, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purified protein under reducing conditions showed a single major band of ∼45 kDa (not shown).TABLE I Open table in a new tab To obtain information on the amino acid sequence of KAT/AadAT, the polyvinylidene difluoride-blotted protein was directly submitted to Edman degradation to see if its NH2 terminus was accessible to sequencing. No sequence information could be obtained, indicating that the NH2 terminus of the protein was modified either as the result of a posttranslational event or due to protein handling. The amino acid sequences of internal peptides were then obtained after digestion with trypsin and separation of the resulting peptides by reverse-phase HPLC. The sequence of six tryptic peptides (denominated T2a, T2b, T3, T6, T10, and T12, see FIGURE 2:, FIGURE 3:) was determined. No significant matches were found in the Swiss-Prot and Protein Identification Resource Protein data banks.Isolation of Rat Kidney KAT/AadAT cDNAUsing the amino acid sequences of the analyzed tryptic peptides of purified rat kidney KAT/AadAT, we were able to obtain the corresponding cDNA using RT-PCR. Two amino acid sequences from the least degenerate regions of peptides T3 and T10 were selected to construct synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides. Because the relative order of the two tryptic peptides within the protein was not known, degenerate sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the tryptic peptide sequences were synthesized (Fig. 2, panels A and B). Poly(A)+ RNA extracted from rat kidney was reverse-transcribed using each degenerate antisense oligonucleotide as a primer, and the resulting cDNA was used as a PCR template with each possible combination of degenerate sense and antisense oligonucleotides from the two tryptic peptides. After 35 rounds of amplification, one distinct PCR product was detected by agarose gel electrophoresis for the primer combination sense-T3/antisense-T10 (Fig. 2C, lane 2). DNA sequence analysis revealed that the 1058-bp fragment contained an open reading frame coding for a polypeptide of 352 amino acids, starting with the codon of the first amino acid phenylalanine (TTT) of peptide T3 and ending with the second nucleotide of the last glutamine codon (CA) of the T10 sequence. Moreover, this cDNA fragment encoded the tryptic peptides T2a, T2b, and T12, confirming that it was indeed a partial cDNA for rat KAT/AadAT.FIGURE 2:Isolation of rat kidney KAT/AadAT cDNA fragment by RT-PCR. A, the amino acid sequences of two tryptic peptides from purified rat kidney KAT/AadAT are shown. The regions of peptides that were selected for the synthesis of degenerate oligonucleotides are overlined. B, degenerate sense (S) and antisense (A) oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the peptide sequences in A are indicated (Y→C/T, W→A/T, S→G/C, R→A/G; I indicates inosine). C, two combinations of sense and antisense oligonucleotides (lane 1, sense-T10/antisense-T3; lane 2, sense-T3/antisense-T10) were used in RT-PCRs of rat kidney poly(A)+ RNA. RT-PCR products from each reaction (lanes 1 and 2) were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. The arrow points to a 1058-bp fragment containing the KAT/AadAT protein sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Molecular Cloning of Rat Kidney KAT/AadAT cDNAA rat kidney cDNA library (Uni-ZAP™XR) from Stratagene was screened with the partial cDNA probe of rat kidney KAT/AadAT. Screening of 9 × 105 recombinants revealed 10 positive clones with inserts ranging from 950 to 1828 bp. The four longest clones, designated as rkKAT-8, rkKAT-14, rkKAT-3, and rkKAT-9, were chosen for further characterization. DNA sequence analysis showed that all clones were identical, except for two nucleotide differences. Only one of these nucleotide differences was contained within the coding region, and it did not result in a change in amino acid sequence. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 3. Analysis of the combined DNA sequence (nucleotides 1-1828) indicated the presence of a single 1275-bp open reading frame with a predicted initiation codon (ATG) at nucleotide 113 and termination at nucleotide 1388 with the stop codon TAA. This open reading frame codes for a polypeptide of 425 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 47,789 Da. It is preceded by a 112-nucleotide 5′-untranslated region containing two in-frame stop codons at positions 32 and 71, and a 422-nucleotide untranslated region in the 3′-end. The predicted initiation codon (nucleotide 113) is embedded in the sequence GAGACATG, which does not match perfectly with the consensus sequence CCACCATG frequently found for eukaryotic translation initiation(27Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Google Scholar). No further ATG was found upstream of this predicted initiation codon, indicating a complete coding sequence.FIGURE 3:Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of cloned rat kidney KAT/AadAT. The deduced amino acid sequence of the encoded polypeptide is shown in single-letter code below the nucleotide sequence in bold face type and is numbered beginning with the initiating methionine. Nucleotides are numbered in the 5′ to 3′ direction. The tryptic peptides (T6, T3, T2a, T2b, T12, T10) isolated from rat kidney KAT/AadAT are boxed. The asterisk denotes the 3′-terminal stop codon. Nucleotide variation between several clones is indicated above the appropriate nucleotide (C→T at nucleotide position 145 (rkKAT-14); C→T at nucleotide position 1784 (rkKAT-8)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Comparison of the complete sequence with the EMBL DNA sequence data base using the Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis software (GCG, University of Wisconsin), indicated that the sequence was unique and had not been isolated previously. Analysis of the hydrophilicity plot of the predicted amino acid sequence for KAT/AadAT showed no evidence for membrane-anchoring or -spanning regions, consistent with the soluble nature of the isolated protein. A mitochondrial form of KAT/AadAT has also been described(8Takeuchi F. Otsuka H. Shibata Y Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 743: 323-330Google Scholar, 9Hartline R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 664-672Google Scholar). However, no structural features resembling those of leader peptides for mitochondrial import (28von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Google Scholar) were observed in the predicted amino acid sequence of rat KAT/AadAT. Therefore, whether mitochondrial KAT/AadAT is encoded by a different gene or by a splice variant of the isolated form carrying an additional signal-peptide sequence remains to be established. Four potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn, Xaa, Ser/Thr) (29Marshall R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1972; 41: 673-702Google Scholar) were found in the predicted amino acid sequence of rat kidney KAT/AadAT at Asn residues 2, 57, 101, and 202. No information, however, is presently available indicating whether the native protein is glycosylated.KAT/AadAT Sequence Comparison with Other AminotransferasesBinary alignment of the protein sequences of KAT/AadAT and KAT/GTK (4Perry S.J. Schofield M.A. MacFarlaine M. Lock E.A. King L.J. Gibson G.G. Goldfarb P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 660-665Google Scholar) using the GAP program contained in GCG showed only 18.4% amino acid identity with 14 gaps located mainly in the NH2- and COOH-terminal parts of the two sequences. Considering conservative amino acid substitutions, the two KAT isoforms displayed 46.2% similarity (not shown). Similar degrees of amino acid identity and similarity were observed after comparison with other aminotransferases from different species, including isoenzymes, such as human serine:pyruvate aminotransferase(30Okuno E. Minatogawa Y. Nakamura N. Nakanishi J. Makino M. Kido R. Biochem. J. 1980; 189: 581-590Google Scholar), which have been reported to display KAT activity. Sequence homology among aminotransferase isoenzymes is not easily recognizable by standard algorithms for sequence comparison. A multiple sequence alignment of aspartate aminotransferases from various organisms with KAT/AadAT and KAT/GTK showed that several residues in the central region of the sequences are totally conserved, therefore suggesting that the corresponding three-dimensional structures might also be conserved. In fact, despite the low degree of amino acid identity, most aminotransferases appear to constitute a group of structurally homologous proteins that originated from a single universal ancestor protein(31Mehta P.K. Hale T.I. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 549-561Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows an alignment of KAT/AadAT and KAT/GTK with E. coli aspartate aminotransferase (AAT), whose three-dimensional structure has been solved in detail. The structure of E. coli AAT consists of three parts, an NH2-terminal loose segment and two compact domains, and shows the same fold and active site structure of vertebrate isoenzymes ((32Jaeger A.U. Moser M. Sauder U. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 285-305Google Scholar) and references therein). The alignment of the larger domain of E. coli AAT (from Thr47 to Ser299, Swiss-Prot data base numbering) shows only 15.5 and 13.3% sequence identity with KAT/AadAT and KAT/GTK, respectively, whereas the sequence identity between the two KAT isoforms in this region is 21.2%. A preliminary model for this domain of KAT/AadAT and KAT/GTK was built by exchanging the amino acids of E. coli AAT for those of the two KAT isoenzymes according to the sequence alignment shown in Fig. 4 and optimized using the Moloc molecular modeling software (Moloc)(33Gerber P. Müller K. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1995; 9: 251-268Google Scholar). For both isoenzymes, the scores calculated by the three-dimensional profile method (34Lüthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Google Scholar) indicated that the model exhibits features of a correctly folded protein. According to the model obtained from the sequence alignment, Lys263 of KAT/AadAT and Lys247 of KAT/GTK correspond to the lysine residue (position 246) of the E. coli enzyme, which forms an aldimine linkage with the PLP aldehyde group. In addition, several of the AAT residues involved in the binding of the cofactor (32Jaeger A.U. Moser M. Sauder U. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 285-305Google Scholar) appear to be conserved in KAT/AadAT and KAT/GTK (see Fig. 4). Sequence similarities in the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions were too low for molecular modeling. This suggests that KAT/AadAT and KAT/GTK should resemble AAT in the large domain comprising the active site but may be different in the domain composed by the N"
https://openalex.org/W1983665472,"The cell adhesion molecule L1 has been implicated in mediating cell-cell adhesion and in promoting neurite outgrowth. The extracellular region of L1 contains six immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains in the amino-terminal region, followed by five fibronectin type III-like repeats. L1 is capable of undergoing homophilic binding as well as heterophilic interactions. To map the homophilic binding domain in L1, three glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (GST-Ig1-2-3, GST-Ig4-5-6, and GST-Fn) were prepared and coupled to Covaspheres and their homophilic binding activity was determined using the Covasphere-to-substratum binding assay. Only GST-Ig1-2-3 was capable of homophilic binding. Next, His-tagged recombinant Ig-domain proteins (His-Ig1-2, His-Ig1, and His-Ig2) were expressed and subjected to similar assays. Only His-Ig1-2 and His-Ig2 were capable of homophilic interactions. Binding of His-Ig2-conjugated Covaspheres to substrate-coated His-Ig2 was inhibited by anti-Ig1-2-3 Fab and soluble His-Ig2. These results indicate that the L1 homophilic binding site resides within Ig2. To examine effects of these L1 recombinant proteins on neurite outgrowth, neural retinal cells were cultured on different substrate-coated fusion proteins. Both GST-Ig1-2-3 and His-Ig2 were potent inducers of neurite extension. These results thus indicate that the L1 Ig-like domain 2 alone is sufficient to mediate L1-L1 interaction and promote neurite outgrowth from retinal cells.

Intercellular adhesion plays an important role during neural development, when specific synaptic connections are established primarily by extension of axons along restricted pathways(1Carpenter E.M. Hollday M. Dev. Biol. 1992; 150: 160-170Google Scholar, 2Martini R. J. Neurocytol. 1994; 23: 1-28Google Scholar). The molecular basis of these processes involves cell adhesion molecules and diffusible factors. In recent years, an increasing number of cell adhesion molecules have been found associated with neuronal cells. These cell adhesion molecules have been categorized according to their structure into three major groups: the cadherins(3Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Google Scholar), the integrins (4Reichardt L.F. Tomaselli K.J. Annu. Rev.

L1 was first described as a 200-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein in the central nervous system, and it belongs to the Ig superfamily(7Lindner J. Rathjen F.G. Schachner M.

L1 consists of six C2-type Ig-like domains in the amino-terminal region, followed by five fibronectin type III-like repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain(8Moos M. Tacke R.

L1 can undergo homophilic binding as well as heterophilic interactions with several other cell adhesion molecules, such as NCAM(21Kadmon G. Kowitz A. Altevogt P. Schachner M. J.

Edelman G.M. Cell Adh. Commun. 1993; 1: 177-190Google Scholar). Some of these heterophilic interactions are known to modulate L1 functions. For instance, NCAM has been shown to undergo cis-interactions with L1, which in turn facilitates L1-L1 homophilic binding(21Kadmon G. Kowitz A. Altevogt P. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 193-208Google Scholar). Neurocan, in contrast, binds to L1 and inhibit neuronal adhesion and neurite extension promoted by the L1 substrate(29Friedlander D.R. Milev P. Karthikeyan L. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Grumet M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 669-680Google Scholar). L1 has been implicated in a wide range of neuronal cell differentiation. Substrate-coated L1 is a potent inducer of neurite outgrowth from a number of primary neurons(14Hlavin M.L. Lemmon V. Genomics. 1991; 11: 416-423Google Scholar, 30Williams E.J. Doherty P. Turner G. Reid R.A. Hemperly J.J. Walsh F.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 883-892Google Scholar, 31Seilheimer B. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 341-351Google Scholar). Axonal growth involves both adhesion and the transmission of extracellular signals into the interior of a growth cone to activate intracellular events (32Brümmendorf T. Rathjen F.G. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1207-1219Google Scholar, 33Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1992; 2: 595-601Google Scholar). L1 appears to play an important role in this signal transduction process(34Schuch U. Lohse M.J. Schachner M. Neuron. 1989; 3: 13-20Google Scholar, 35Williams E.J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1029-1037Google Scholar). A L1-Fc chimeric protein has been reported to induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation in neuronal cells (36Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Google Scholar) as well as promote neurite outgrowth(37Doherty P. Williams E. Walsh F.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 57-66Google Scholar), suggesting that the clustering of L1 molecules may trigger the signaling pathway leading to neurite extension. It is evident that the formation of adhesion complexes via L1 homophilic binding may serve as an initiation point for many important signaling events. However, very little is known about the homophilic binding site of L1 and the mechanism of its interaction. In this report, experiments were carried out to investigate the relationship between L1 homophilic binding and its neuritogenic activity. We found that the second Ig-like domain of L1 was capable of binding to cell membrane-associated L1, as well as undergoing homophilic binding by itself. In addition, the Ig-like domain 2 of L1 was capable of promoting neurite outgrowth from retinal neurons, suggesting an intimate relationship between L1 homophilic binding and L1-mediated neurite outgrowth. The pGEX-3X plasmid and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Toronto, ON). The pQE-8 plasmid and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin were purchased from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). Covaspheres were obtained from Duke Scientific Corp. (Palo Alto, CA). Freund's adjuvant, trypsin, α-minimal essential medium, and N2 supplement were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.(Toronto, ON). Poly-L-lysine was purchased from Sigma, DiI from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The BCA (bicinchoninic acid) protein assay kit from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Standard recombinant DNA methods were followed in the construction of expression vectors(38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA fragments encoding different portions of L1 were obtained using appropriate restriction enzymes or PCR amplification. The cDNA fragment coding for the Ig-like domains 1, 2, and 3 (Ig1-2-3) between amino acid positions 24 and 351 (amino acid and nucleotide numbering according to Hlavin et al.(14Hlavin M.L. Lemmon V. Genomics. 1991; 11: 416-423Google Scholar)) was released by NarI at nucleotide position 113 and BamHI at nucleotide position 1114, followed by treatment with Klenow enzyme and addition of EcoRI linkers at both ends. This fragment was subcloned into the unique EcoRI site of the pGEX-3X vector for expression of the fusion protein glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Ig1-2-3. The cDNA fragment coding for the Ig-like domains 4, 5, and 6 (Ig4-5-6) between amino acid positions 352 and 595 was obtained by BamHI digestion of a PCR product, which was generated using the forward primer 5′-GCCCCGGGACCATGGTCATCACGGAACAGTCT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GCGAATTCTGGGATCCCGGCCCAGGGCTCCCCAC-3′. This fragment was subcloned into the unique BamHI site of the pGEX-3X vector for expression of the fusion protein GST-Ig4-5-6. The fragment coding for all the five fibronectin type III-like repeats (Fn) between amino acid positions 596 and 1094 was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5′-CCGGATCCCCATGGTGCCACGGCTGGTGCTG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGGAATTCTGAGATCTAGGGAGCCTCACGCGGCC-3′. The PCR product was digested by EcoRI and BamHI and then subcloned into these two sites of pGEX-3X. GST was fused to the amino terminus of all three fusion proteins. DNA fragments coding for Ig-like domains 1 and 2 (Ig1-2) between amino acid positions 17 and 209, Ig-like domain 1 (Ig1) between amino acid positions 17 and 113, and Ig-like domain 2 (Ig2) between amino acid positions 114 and 209 were also obtained by PCR amplification. Oligonucleotide primers 5′-AGGGATCCGTCATCACGGAACAGT-3′ and 5′-GTGGATCCGACCCGGAGGTCAATG-3′ were used for generating the Ig1-2 cDNA, primers 5′-AGGGATCCGTCATCACGGAACAGT-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCCATGAGCCGGATCTCA-3′ for Ig1 cDNA, and primers 5′-TGGGCGCCTCATGGCCGAGGGTGC-3′ and 5′-GTGGATCCGACCCGGAGGTCAATG-3′ for Ig2 cDNA. These DNA fragments were either digested with BamHI or ligated with BamHI linkers and then subcloned into the BamHI site of the pQE-8 plasmid, which was designed to fuse a His6-tag to the amino terminus of the recombinant protein. The nucleotide sequences of these inserts were confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing using a T7 Sequencing™ kit (Pharmacia). The Escherichia coli strain JM101 was used for the transformation of pGEX-derived plasmids and the E. coli strain M15 for the transformation of pQE-derived plasmids. To produce GST-L1 fusion proteins, transformed E. coli cells were grown at 37°C in 250 ml of LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Protein synthesis was induced by adding 1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside when A600 reached 0.6-0.8. Cells were collected 3 h after induction by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1 M DTT). The fusion protein was isolated as inclusion bodies by sonication of the cell suspension on ice, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4°C. Inclusion bodies were washed two times using washing buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1 M DTT, 0.05% deoxycholate, and 1% Triton X-100) followed by washing once with lysis buffer. Then they were solubilized by overnight incubation at 4°C in 10 ml of 6 M guanidine buffer, containing 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, and 10 mM DTT. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min to remove the insoluble material, the supernatant was slowly diluted by adding 40 ml of dilution buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 0. 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT) and was allowed to sit at 4°C overnight. Then the denaturant and reducing reagents were slowly removed by dialyzing against the storage buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 M KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA). The refolded GST fusion proteins were passed through a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column according to the manufacturer's protocol. Eluted proteins were dialyzed against PBS at 4°C. His-Ig1-2, His-Ig1, and His-Ig2 were purified and refolded as described previously(39Rao Y. Zhao X. Siu C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27540-27548Google Scholar). In brief, column fractions containing His-tagged proteins were pooled and adjusted to ~2 mg/ml. They were reduced by adding β-mercaptoethanol to 0.1 M, followed by incubation at 37°C for 90 min. To reoxidize, His-tagged proteins were dialyzed against 8 M urea, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, at 4°C overnight. Samples were diluted 1:20 in PBS and concentrated by ultrafiltration, followed by overnight dialysis against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to reduce the denaturant. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against the purified and refolded GST fusion proteins: GST-Ig1-2-3, GST-Ig4-5-6, and GST-Fn. 100 μg of protein was used in the first immunization; 50 μg of protein was used in three subsequent boosts at 2-, 2-, and 4-week intervals. To prepare acetone powder of GST-expressing bacteria for absorption of antisera, E. coli cells transformed with pGEX-3X were induced to synthesize GST for 3 h and then collected and resuspended in 2 ml of saline (0.9% NaCl). The cell/saline suspension was kept on ice for 5 min. Then 8 ml of acetone (-20°C) was added and mixed vigorously. The acetone suspension was kept on ice for 30 min, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended with fresh acetone and mixed vigorously. The mixture was kept on ice for another 10 min. The pellet was collected and air-dried at room temperature. The dried acetone powder was added to the antiserum at a final concentration of 1%, and the mixture was incubated at 4°C overnight with gentle rotation. After spinning at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was dialyzed and passed through an Econo-Pac serum IgG purification column (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Green or red MX Covaspheres (50 μl) were briefly sonicated before the addition of 10 μg of fusion protein, and the final volume was adjusted to 100 μl with PBS. After rotation at room temperature for 75 min, excess active sites on Covaspheres were blocked with 1% BSA. The Covaspheres-to-substratum attachment assay was carried out as described previously(39Rao Y. Zhao X. Siu C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27540-27548Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins (5 μl of a 1 μM solution) or anti-domain IgG (5 μl at 10 μg/ml) in PBS was used to coat spots (~2.5 mm in diameter) on 35-mm plastic Petri dishes at room temperature for 1 h, followed by blocking with 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min. Then 2 μl of fusion protein-conjugated Covaspheres were added to 100 μl of PBS and dispersed with sonication for 5 min in a chilled water bath sonicator. Samples of the diluted Covaspheres (30 μl each) were added to the coated spots and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After five gentle washes with PBS, the binding of Covaspheres to the substratum was observed by epifluorescence microscopy and recorded images were analyzed using the NIH Image program. The relative amounts of bound Covaspheres per unit area were calculated. In competition experiments, Covaspheres were incubated with competitors at room temperature for 10 min before the binding assay. Neural retinal cells from day 6 chick embryos were isolated as described previously (40Rao Y. Wu X.F. Yip P. Gariepy J. Siu C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20630-20638Google Scholar) and cultured on coverslips for 5 to 6 h at 37°C. Coverslips were then blocked with 1% BSA in HBSS for 5 min and incubated with Covaspheres at room temperature. In inhibition studies, inhibitors at different final concentrations were incubated with cells for 25 min at room temperature after blocking with BSA. After the removal of excess inhibitor and one gentle wash with HBSS, 100 μl of fusion protein-conjugated Covaspheres were added on to the coverslip. All coverslips were incubated for 45 min at room temperature on a platform shaker. After washing several times with PBS, cells were observed using epifluorescence microscopy. Cells with more than 5 Covaspheres attached on the surface were scored positive, and generally 100-200 cells were scored for each coverslip. Neural retinal cells from day 5 chick embryos were isolated as described previously(41Sandig M. Rao Y. Siu C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14841-14848Google Scholar). Round glass coverslips (12-mm diameter) were coated with 0.01% (w/v) poly-L-lysine at room temperature for 3 h. After washing three times with water, 80 μl samples of recombinant proteins at 1 μM were used to coat the coverslips overnight at 4°C. To determine the efficiency of protein coating, protein adsorbed to coverslips was solubilized by 1% SDS (10 μl) at 37°C for 10 min. The relative amounts of bound and unbound protein were determined using the BCA protein assay. Protein samples were adjusted to a final volume of 50 μl and transferred to a 96-well plate. Then 200 μl of working reagent was added to each well, followed by incubation at 37°C for 2 h, color development was stopped by rapid cooling, and absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a microtiter plate reader. Approximately 60% of the input protein was found adsorbed to the substratum. Similar results were obtained for both GST fusion proteins and His-tagged proteins. The unbound protein was removed by washing with water, and the coverslips were blocked with 1% BSA in α-minimal essential medium at room temperature for 30 min. These coverslips were then transferred to 24-well Linbro plates, and retinal cells suspended in N2 medium were seeded on top of them. Rat L1 protein was either adsorbed on to a nitrocellulose substrate according to the method of Lagenaur and Lemmon (42Lagenaur C. Lemmon V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7753-7757Google Scholar) or on to a poly-L-lysine substrate. In inhibition studies, Fab or recombinant proteins were used to precoat either the substratum or the retinal cells at final concentrations of 250 and 40 μg/ml, respectively. Neurite extension was allowed to proceed for 16-18 h. Retinal cells were fixed for 20 min in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS by gradually replacing the culture medium with the fixative. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in vinol, containing 1,4-diazabicyclo(2,2,2)octane and p-phenelenediamine, to retard photobleaching. Samples were examined by epifluorescence microscopy. Retinal neurons bearing neurites were recorded, and ~100 neurites were measured in each experiment. To investigate the structure/function relationships of L1, cDNA fragments encoding three different extracellular segments of L1 were fused to GST for expression in E. coli (Fig. 1A). These three GST fusion proteins contained Ig-like domains 1, 2, and 3 (GST-Ig1-2-3), Ig-like domains 4, 5, and 6 (GST-Ig4-5-6) and fibronectin type III-like domains 1 to 5 (GST-Fn), respectively. Samples of purified and refolded proteins were analyzed by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Under reducing conditions, fusion proteins migrated with apparent Mr of 65,000, 55,000, and 85,000 for GST-Ig1-2-3, GST-Ig4-5-6, and GST-Fn, respectively (Fig. 1B). These values corresponded closely to the expected molecular size of these fusion proteins. Several minor bands of lower molecular size were observed. Since these bands were recognized by anti-GST antibodies (data not shown), they were probably partially degraded products of the recombinant proteins. The yield of fusion protein was ~5 mg of protein/liter of bacteria culture in all three cases. To obtain L1 domain-specific antibodies, rabbits were immunized with the purified fusion proteins. The antisera were absorbed against acetone powder to remove antibodies that recognized bacterial protein and the GST moiety of these fusion proteins. The IgG fraction was isolated from each antiserum to obtain L1 domain-specific antibodies. Western blots were carried out using these purified IgG to ensure that they did not cross-react with the other two fusion proteins (data not shown). To determine which fusion protein contained the L1 homophilic binding activity, a Covasphere-to-substratum attachment assay was developed. Fusion proteins were conjugated to Covaspheres, which were tested for their ability to adhere to different substrate-coated proteins. As a positive control, IgG that recognized specific L1 segments was adsorbed on to Petri dishes for Covasphere binding (Fig. 2a). Covaspheres were also incubated on substrate-coated GST to monitor background resulting from GST-to-GST interactions (Fig. 2b). Covaspheres conjugated with GST-Ig1-2-3 attached very well to the GST-Ig1-2-3 substrate, whereas the level of binding on GST-Ig4-5-6 was close to background level (Fig. 2, c and d). The relative percentages of Covaspheres bound per unit area were estimated by normalizing the results to the level of Covasphere binding on the IgG-coated substrate (Fig. 3). The amount of GST-Ig1-2-3-conjugated Covaspheres bound to the GST-Ig1-2-3 substrate was ~25-fold higher than that attached on the GST substrate. In contrast, binding of GST-Ig4-5-6-conjugated Covaspheres to the GST-Ig4-5-6 substrate was at the background level (Fig. 3). In the case of GST-Fn-conjugated Covaspheres, a higher background level of binding to the GST substrate was observed, but there was no significant difference between the level of binding to the GST-Fn substrate and the level of binding to GST (Fig. 3). Furthermore, GST-Ig1-2-3-conjugated Covaspheres did not attach to substrate-coated GST-Ig4-5-6 or GST-Fn (data not shown). It was evident that the Ig-like domains 1, 2, and 3 did not interact with other extracellular segments of L1. These results thus demonstrate that the L1 homophilic binding site resides within the first three Ig-like domains, and that the last three Ig-like domains and the fibronectin domains may not be directly involved in L1 homophilic interactions. The dose effect of substratum-associated GST-Ig1-2-3 on Covasphere binding was also examined. When equal amounts of Covaspheres were loaded onto substrates coated with different concentrations of GST-Ig1-2-3, Covasphere attachment was found to be dose-dependent and maximal binding was achieved when the substratum was coated with 1 μM GST-Ig1-2-3 (Fig. 4A). When binding was carried out on a GST-coated substratum, no significant binding was observed up to a concentration of 5 μM. To demonstrate the specificity of Covasphere binding, competition experiments were carried out using either anti-Ig1-2-3 Fab or soluble GST-Ig1-2-3. Anti-Ig1-2-3 Fab blocked the binding of GST-Ig1-2-3-conjugated Covaspheres to substrate-coated GST-Ig1-2-3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). Fifty percent inhibition was achieved at ~35 nM anti-Ig1-2-3 Fab. However, the effects of anti-Ig4-5-6 Fab was negligible up to a concentration of 5 μM. The attachment of GST-Ig1-2-3-conjugated Covaspheres to substrate-coated GST-Ig1-2-3 was also inhibited by soluble GST-Ig1-2-3 (Fig. 4C). The inhibition was dose-dependent, and 50% inhibition was achieved at ~80 nM soluble GST-Ig1-2-3. In contrast, the attachment of GST-Ig1-2-3 Covaspheres to GST-Ig1-2-3 substrate was not affected by GST or GST-Ig4-5-6, up to a concentration of 3 μM. To identify the domain that contains the homophilic binding site, smaller fragments of the extracellular portion of L1 were expressed as fusion proteins using the pQE expression vectors (Fig. 5A). His-Ig1-2 contained the first two Ig-like domains of L1; His-Ig1 and His-Ig2 contained the first and the second Ig-like domain, respectively. The recombinant proteins were refolded proteins, and SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis revealed that they were at least 90% pure (Fig. 5B). The fusion proteins were used to coat Petri dishes and then assayed for their ability to bind GST-Ig1-2-3-conjugated Covaspheres. A large number of GST-Ig1-2-3-conjugated Covaspheres attached to the His-Ig1-2 substrate, suggesting that the third Ig-like domain of L1 is not needed for homophilic interactions. When recombinant proteins containing a single Ig-like domain were tested, Covaspheres attached to the His-Ig2 substrate, but not to the His-Ig1 substrate (Fig. 6A), suggesting that it is Ig2, and not Ig1, that is directly involved in L1-L1 binding. Consistent with this observation, His-Ig2 was able to function as a competitor to displace GST-Ig1-2-3-conjugated Covaspheres in the attachment assay. Only residual binding (~5%) was observed when binding was carried out in 10 μM soluble His-Ig2 (Fig. 6A). In contrast, a relative level of 70% binding was retained when the same concentration of His-Ig1 was included in the assay. To determine whether Ig2 can bind to Ig2, His-Ig2-conjugated Covaspheres were assayed for their ability to attach to substrate-coated His-Ig2. Binding of Covaspheres was observed on the His-Ig2 substrate, but not on GST (Fig. 6B). Positive results were also obtained when these Covaspheres were deposited on substratum coated with either GST-Ig1-2-3 or His-Ig1-2. However, His-Ig2-conjugated Covaspheres did not bind to substrate-coated His-Ig1. These results are consistent with the notion that L1-L1 binding is mediated by homophilic interactions between the second Ig-like domains of two apposing L1 molecules. Whether His-Ig2 was able to interact with L1 molecules expressed by neural retinal cells was also examined. Retinal cells were isolated from day 6 chick embryos and cultured on coverslips. His-Ig2-conjugated Covaspheres were deposited on top of these cells, and the number of cells showing positive Covasphere binding was estimated. About 40% of retinal cells were decorated with His-Ig2-conjugated Covaspheres, whereas binding of His-Ig1-conjugated Covaspheres to these cells was at the background level (Table 1). To determine whether His-Ig2 was interacting with L1 molecules on the surface of retinal cells, cells were first incubated with either soluble His-Ig2 or anti-Ig1-2-3 Fab. After removal of the excess protein, His-Ig2-conjugated Covaspheres were placed on the precoated cells. Precoating the cells with either soluble His-Ig2 or anti-Ig1-2-3 Fab blocked the binding of Covaspheres to retinal cells, and the inhibition was dose-dependent.

We have shown previously that these lipids activate calcium-independent protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms in vitro (Toker, A., Meyer, M., Reddy, K. K., Falck, J. R., Aneja, R., Aneja, S., Parra, A., Burns, D. J., Ballas, L. M. and Cantley, L. C.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 32358-32367). Activation of platelet PKC in response to TRAP is detected by the phosphorylation of the major PKC substrate in platelets, the p47 phosphoprotein, also known as pleckstrin. Here we provide evidence for two phases of pleckstrin phosphorylation in response to TRAP. A rapid phase of pleckstrin phosphorylation (<1 min) precedes the peak of PtdIns-3,4-P2 production and is unaffected by concentrations of wortmannin (10-100 nM) that block production of this lipid. However prolonged phosphorylation of pleckstrin (>2 min) is inhibited by wortmannin concentrations that block PtdIns-3,4-P2 production. Phorbol ester-mediated pleckstrin phosphorylation was not affected by wortmannin and wortmannin had no effect on purified platelet PKC activity. Phosphorylation of pleckstrin could be induced using permeabilized platelets supplied with exogenous γ-32P[ATP] and synthetic dipalmitoyl PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 and dipalmitoyl PtdIns-3,4-P2 micelles, but not with dipalmitoyl phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. These results suggest two modes of stimulating pleckstrin phosphorylation: a rapid activation of PKC (via diacylglycerol and calcium) followed by a slower activation of calcium-independent PKCs via PtdIns-3,4-P2.

https://openalex.org/W2008921565,"We have shown previously that the active form of avian sarcoma virus integrase (ASV IN) is a multimer. In this report we investigate IN multimerization properties by a variety of methods that include size exclusion chromatography, chemical cross-linking, and protein overlay assays. We show that removal of the nonconserved C-terminal region of IN results in a reduced capacity for multimerization, whereas deletion of the first 38 amino acids has little effect on the oligomeric state. Binding of a full-length IN fusion protein to various IN fragments indicates that sequences in both the catalytic core (residues 50-207) and a C-terminal region (residues 201-240) contribute to IN self-association. We also observe that the isolated C-terminal fragment (residues 201-286) is capable of self-association. Finally, a single amino acid substitution in the core domain (S85G) produces a severe defect in multimerization. We conclude from these analyses that both the catalytic core and a region in the nonconserved C terminus are involved in ASV integrase multimerization. These results enhance our understanding of integrase self-association determinants and define a major role of the C-terminal region of ASV integrase in this process.

https://openalex.org/W2062804266,"Abstract Lysolipids have been reported to inhibit various membrane fusion events, and it was suggested that inhibition was due to their “inverted cone” shape, which hinders the formation of intermediate lipid structures required for fusion (Chernomordik, L. V., Vogel, S. S., Sokoloff, A., Onaran, H. O., Leikina, E. A., and Zimmerberg, J.(1993) FEBS Lett. 318, 71-76). Here, the effect of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) on fusion mediated by the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus was investigated. Virus-liposome fusion was inhibited by LPC if the lysolipid was added to the membranes from an aqueous stock solution but not if LPC was symmetrically distributed over both leaflets of the liposomal bilayer. These findings would be consistent with an effect of LPC on lipid intermediate formation, but inhibition increased with increasing acyl chain length and thus a less pronounced inverted cone shape of the lysolipids suggesting that the mechanism of inhibition might be different. At low pH, due to the exposure of the fusion peptide of HA, followed by its insertion into the liposomal membrane, virus acquires the ability to bind to zwitterionic liposomes lacking receptors for HA. This type of binding was inhibited by LPC. Moreover, leakage of calcein from receptor-containing liposomes, induced by purified HA at low pH, was inhibited by LPC. Therefore, the inhibition of influenza-induced fusion by LPC was caused by the binding of LPC to fusion peptides, thereby preventing their interaction with the target membrane rather than an effect on intermediate lipid structures."
https://openalex.org/W2104831072,"Diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR), which is identical to the membrane-anchored form of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (proHB-EGF), has a high affinity for heparin. We studied the effect of heparin-like molecules on the binding of diphtheria toxin (DT) to DTR/proHB-EGF. Mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells deficient in heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans were about 15 times less sensitive to DT than wild type CHO-K1 cells. When free heparan sulfate or heparin was added to the culture medium, DT sensitivity of the mutant cells was fully restored. Studies of binding of 125I-labeled DT to HS-deficient CHO cells transfected with human DTR/proHB-EGF cDNA indicated that the increased sensitivity to DT after addition of heparin is due to increased binding of DT to cells. Vero cells display a relatively large amount of heparan sulfate residues compared to CHO-K1 cells or L cells. Enhancement of DT binding by the addition of heparin was also observed with CHO-K1 cells and L cells that had been transfected with human DTR/proHB-EGF cDNA, but the degree of enhancement was less than that observed with the HS-deficient CHO cells. Addition of heparin did not affect DT binding or DT sensitivity of Vero cells. Heparin-dependent binding was observed when intact Vero cells were treated with heparitinase or when the cell membrane was solubilized with a neutral detergent. Scatchard plot analysis for the binding of DT to a recombinant HB-EGF in vitro and to L cells expressing human DTR/proHB-EGF revealed that heparin increases the affinity of DTR/proHB-EGF for DT but does not change the number of binding sites. Although DRAP27/CD9 is known to enhance DT binding to DTR/proHB-EGF, the results indicate that heparin and DRAP27/CD9 increase DT binding by independent mechanisms. Thus, heparin-like molecules, probably in the form of heparan sulfate proteoglycan on the cell surface, are a third factor required for maximal DT binding activity of cells.

The process of DT cytotoxicity includes (i) binding of DT to a specific receptor on the cell surface, (ii) internalization of the toxin by receptor-mediated endocytosis, (iii) translocation of the enzymatically active A fragment from endosome to the cytosol, and (iv) inactivation of elongation factor-2. Although a number of cellular factors are involved in this process, binding of DT to the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) is a key step(3Middlebrook J.L. Dorland R.B. Leppla S.H. J. Biol.

DTR, the principal protein involved in binding of DT to cells, was first identified and purified from monkey Vero cells(4Mekada E. Okada Y. Uchida T. J.

A cDNA-encoding DTR was cloned from this cell line(7Naglich J.G. Metherall J.E. Russell D.W. Eidels L. Cell. 1992; 69: 1051-1061Google Scholar). DTR is identical to the precursor form of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (proHB-EGF) (7Naglich J.G. Metherall J.E. Russell D.W. Eidels L. Cell. 1992; 69: 1051-1061Google Scholar, 8Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Google Scholar) which was originally identified as a heparin-binding growth factor(9Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J. Fiddes J.C. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Google Scholar). While proHB-EGF is cleaved by an unidentified protease on the cell surface to yield the soluble mature growth factor (HB-EGF)(10Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Google Scholar), a significant amount of proHB-EGF is left uncleaved on the cell surface, where it acts as a membrane-anchored growth factor (11Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Google Scholar) and as a DTR. Although proHB-EGF is expressed in species including human, monkey, rat, and mouse with a similar tissue distribution, cells derived from mice and rats are resistant to DT(6Middlebrook J.L. Dorland R.B. Can. J. Microbiol. 1977; 23: 183-189Google Scholar, 12Lennox E.S. Kaplan A.S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1957; 95: 700-702Google Scholar, 13Gabliks J. Solotorovsky M. J. Immunol. 1962; 88: 505-512Google Scholar). The insensitivity of mouse and rat cells to DT is due to amino acid substitutions in the EGF-like domain of proHB-EGF that reduce binding of DT(14Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1015-1019Google Scholar). DTR/proHB-EGF forms a complex with DRAP27/CD9(8Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Google Scholar, 15Iwamoto R. Senoh H. Okada Y. Uchida T. Mekada E. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1389-1399Google Scholar). Although direct interaction of DRAP27/CD9 with DT has not been observed, DRAP27/CD9 greatly up-regulates the binding of DT(8Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Google Scholar) of DTR/proHB-EGF. Thus, DRAP27/CD9 is a second factor determining binding of DT to cells. Although the mechanism of up-regulation by DRAP27/CD9 is still not clear, it is neither due to increased expression of the DTR/proHB-EGF gene nor increased DTR/proHB-EGF protein on the cell surface(8Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Google Scholar). Scatchard plot analysis shows that DRAP27/CD9 increases the number of DT-binding sites but does not change their affinity for DT(8Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Google Scholar). DTR/proHB-EGF shows strong affinity for heparin and heparan sulfate (HS)(18Ono M. Raab G. Lau K. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol.

Because the binding site of DTR/proHB-EGF for DT seems to overlap with or be located in close proximity to the binding site for the EGF receptor(14Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1015-1019Google Scholar), we examined whether heparin influences binding of DT to DTR/proHB-EGF. The results indicate that DT requires cell surface heparin-like molecules for maximal binding to DTR/proHB-EGF. Heparin-like molecules on the cell surface, possibly in the form of HSPG, are a third factor influencing binding of DT to cells. DT was produced as described previously(25Uchida T.

HS (from bovine intestinal mucosa), dermatan sulfate (from bovine mucosa) sodium salts, heparitinase (EC 4.2.2.8, catalog no. 100703), chondroitinase ABC, and mouse anti-HS monoclonal antibody HepSS1 (26Kure S. Yoshie O. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3900-3908Google Scholar) were purchased from Seikagaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Heparin (from bovine intestinal mucosa) and N-desulfated heparin (from porcine mucosal heparin) sodium salts were purchased from Sigma. Chondroitin sulfate A and C (from shark cartilage) sodium salts were obtained from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). Rabbit anti-human HB-EGF antibody (H6 antibody) was obtained as described previously(8Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E.

Esko (Department of Biochemistry, University of Birmingham, AL). CHO-K1 cells and mutant 677 cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin as described previously(20Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Google Scholar). Vero cells and VeroH cells (10Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Google Scholar) were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. LH cells and LCH cells (8Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were detached by EDTA treatment and suspended in WS buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM phosphate buffer, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM MgCl2, 3 mM NaN3, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2). For detection of HS, cells were incubated with HepSS1 antibody (diluted 500-fold in WS buffer) for 1 h at 4°C. Cells were washed twice with WS buffer and incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody for 1 h at 4°C. For detection of DTR/HB-EGF, cells were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with anti-HB-EGF antibody H6 (diluted 500-fold in WS buffer), washed twice with WS buffer, and then incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody for 1 h at 4°C. After incubation with the FITC-conjugated antibody, cells were washed twice with WS buffer and resuspended in PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2). Fluorescence intensity of single cells was measured with an EPICS XL flow cytometer (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). For each measurement, 10,000 events were collected, and aggregated cells were gated out. DT cytotoxicity was assayed by measuring the inhibition of protein synthesis as described previously (28Umata T. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21940-21945Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells or mutant 677 cells were transfected with pRcHBEGF (8Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Google Scholar) by the calcium phosphate method(29Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for 48 h and further cultured for 7 days in the presence of 200 μg/ml G418. Colonies growing in the selection medium were isolated and assayed for DT binding activity. Positive clones were isolated and subcloned again. K1H cells derived from CHO-K1 cells and 677H cells from 677 cells were the clones with the highest expression of human HB-EGF. Binding of 125I-labeled DT to cells was measured as described previously (8Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Google Scholar) except for the binding medium. The binding medium used in this study was Ham's F-12 containing 20 mM HEPES, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 3 mM NaN3, pH 7.2. Specific binding was determined by subtracting the counts obtained with cells incubated with 125I-DT and excess unlabeled DT (nonspecific binding) from the counts obtained with 125I-DT alone (total binding). In some experiments, values of specific binding were plotted as described by Scatchard (30Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Google Scholar) to determine the number of DT-binding sites and the binding affinity of DTR/proHB-EGF for DT. Chlorate and heparitinase treatments were carried out as described previously(23Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 933-940Google Scholar). For treatment with chlorate, CHO cells were incubated for 48 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed bovine calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 30 mM sodium chlorate. For treatment with heparitinase, cells were washed with binding buffer, incubated for 1.5 h at 37°C with 0.02 unit/ml heparitinase in the binding buffer. After washing twice with PBS(+) (PBS containing 0.2 mM CaCl2 and 0.2 mM MgCl2), DT binding to the treated cells was measured by 125I-DT-binding assay. Cells grown in monolayers were labeled with NHS-LC-biotin, and the cell lysate was prepared as described previously(8Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Google Scholar). The cell lysate was incubated with 650 ng/ml DT in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml heparin for 6 h at 4°C followed by incubation with anti-DT antibody-conjugated Sepharose as described previously(8Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Google Scholar). A part of the supernatant was treated with 0.02 unit/ml heparitinase for 1.5 h at 37°C, then precipitated with DT and immobilized anti-DT antibody. Material recovered from the Sepharose gels was subjected by SDS-PAGE, transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Nihon Millipore Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and biotinylated cell surface proteins in the precipitate were detected as described previously(8Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Google Scholar). A 75-amino acid form of human recombinant HB-EGF (19Thompson S.A. Higashiyama S. Wood K.

After washing with buffers at pH 8.0 and at pH 5.0, the gel was suspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM NaN3. HB-EGF-conjugated gel was incubated with the indicated concentrations of 125I-DT (5 ng/ml-200 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of heparin (0-100 μg/ml). After incubation for 4 h at 4°C, the gel was washed three times with WS buffer. The radioactivity bound to the gel was counted with a γ-counter. Specific binding of 125I-DT to the recombinant HB-EGF molecules was calculated by subtracting the radioactivity of a sample with an excess unlabeled DT from that of the sample without unlabeled DT. All measurements were made in duplicate. A mutant of CHO cells, pgsD-677, lacks both N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase and glucuronosyltransferase, enzymes required for the polymerization of HS chains, and does not produce HSPG on the cell surface(32Esko J.D.

Flow cytometric analysis of 677 cells and K1 cells stained with anti-HS antibody verified that there are no detectable HS residues on the cell surface of 677 cells while a significant amount of HS was observed on the cell surface of K1 cells (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2, the ED50 for inhibition of protein synthesis by DT for 677 cells, 230 ng/ml, was 15 times greater than for wild type cells, which had an ED50 of 15 ng/ml.Figure 2DT sensitivity on wild type CHO cells and HS-deficient cells. CHO-K1 cells (open circles) and mutant 677 cells (closed circles) were incubated with various concentrations of DT for 2 h at 37°C, followed by incubation with [3H]leucine for 1 h at 37°C.

Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, DT sensitivity of the 677 cells was increased in a dose-dependent manner by addition of HS to the medium. At 100 μg/ml HS, the ED50 of 677 cells was about 10 ng/ml, which is similar to the value for wild type cells in the absence of HS. DT sensitivity of wild type cells was not increased at low concentrations of HS (0.1-1.0 μg/ml), but was slightly increased at high concentrations (10-100 μg/ml) (Fig. 3B). The sensitivity of 677 cells to DT was also increased by addition of heparin (Fig. 3C). The ED50 for 677 cells at 0.1, 1, and 10 μg/ml heparin was 60, 28, and 24 ng/ml, respectively, while ED50 in the absence of heparin was 180 ng/ml. Heparin at high concentration (10-100 μg/ml) increased DT sensitivity of the wild type cells as well, but the effect of heparin was less in K1 cells than in 677 cells (Fig. 3D). Heparin was more effective than HS for both cell lines, as was reported for bFGF(34Walker A. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 931-935Google Scholar, 35Bashkin P. Doctrow S. Klagsbrun M. Svahn C.M. Folkman J. Vlodavsky I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1737-1743Google Scholar). The fact that the addition of HS or heparin restores DT sensitivity in 677 cells indicates that the decreased sensitivity of 677 cells is due to the absence of HSPG in this mutant cells and that heparin-like molecules are involved in determining DT sensitivity. Other related glycosaminoglycans (GAG) were tested. N-Desulfated heparin, chondroitin sulfate A, chondroitin sulfate C, and hyaluronic acid did not increase DT sensitivity, but dermatan sulfate was as effective as heparin (data not shown), as was previously observed for FGF(35Bashkin P. Doctrow S. Klagsbrun M. Svahn C.M. Folkman J. Vlodavsky I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1737-1743Google Scholar, 36Roghani M. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22156-22162Google Scholar). These results suggest that both the saccharide core structure and the level of sulfation influence the enhancing effect. To examine whether the effect of heparin and HS on DT sensitivity is due to an increase of DT binding or some other mechanism, binding of 125I-labeled DT to K1 cells and 677 cells was studied in the presence or absence of heparin. Because specific binding of DT to CHO-K1 cells is too low to detect(37Mekada E. Kohno K. Ishiura M. Uchida T. Okada Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 109: 792-799Google Scholar), we transfected wild type CHO-K1 cells and mutant 677 cells with human DTR/proHB-EGF cDNA. K1H cells and 677H cells, stable transfectants expressing human HB-EGF, were used for DT-binding experiments. Specific binding of 125I-DT to 677H cells and K1H cells was clearly observed without heparin. Fig. 4A shows that binding of125I-DT to 677H cells is much higher in the presence of 10 μg/ml heparin. K1H cells also showed increased DT binding after addition of heparin, but the effect was smaller than with 677H cells. Fig. 4B compares the effect of heparin on DT binding by the two cell lines. Because 677H cells and K1H cells have different levels of expression of DTR/proHB-EGF, DT binding for each cell line was normalized to the value in the absence of heparin. In the presence of 0.1 μg/ml heparin, specific binding of 125I-DT to 677H cells was increased 5.4-fold, whereas binding to K1H cells was increased 2.3-fold. The effect of heparin on DT binding is well correlated with the effect on DT sensitivity, indicating that the decreased DT sensitivity of 677 cells is due to reduced binding of DT to DTR/HB-EGF in the absence of heparin or HS molecules. Chlorate is an inhibitor of sulfation. The requirement for heparin-like molecules for binding of DT was further studied by treating cells with chlorate to reduce the amount of cell surface HS residues. K1H cells and 677H cells were incubated with chlorate for 48 h, then the specific binding of 125I-DT to the cells was measured. In K1H cells, the chlorate treatment diminished the binding of 125I-DT to 40% of the value for untreated controls (Fig. 5). When heparin was added to the medium, binding of 125I-DT to chlorate-treated cells was restored. In the presence of heparin binding of DT to both chlorate-treated cells and untreated cells was about 1.5 times higher than that observed with untreated cells without heparin. Binding of similar amounts of DT to both chlorate-treated cells and untreated cells in the presence of heparin rules out the possibility that chlorate treatment diminished the amount of DTR/proHB-EGF. In the case of 677H cells, binding of DT was not affected by chlorate treatment, which is consistent with the HSPG deficiency of 677 cells. We concluded that heparin-like molecules are involved in DT binding at least in CHO cells, and that DT sensitivity of 677 cells is reduced due to the deficiency in HSPG. To examine whether heparin-dependent DT-binding is a general property of DTR/proHB-EGF or specific to CHO cells, the requirement of heparin-like molecules for binding of DT to Vero cells was examined. Addition of heparin up to 50 μg/ml did not enhance DT sensitivity (data not shown) or DT binding (Fig. 6A). Flow cytometric analysis of cells stained with anti-HS antibody showed that the amount of HS-GAG on Vero cells was about 80 times higher than the amount on CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 1). When cell surface HS-GAG was diminished by treatment of Vero cells with heparitinase, heparin-dependent binding was observed. Heparitinase treatment greatly diminished cell surface HS contents, but did not affect the amount of DTR/proHB-EGF (data not shown). Under these conditions, binding of 125I-DT to heparitinase-treated Vero cells was about 50% of the binding to untreated cells. Binding was fully restored by addition of exogenous heparin (Fig. 6A). Heparin-dependent binding of DT was also observed in Vero cells lysates. VeroH cells, Vero cells overexpressing DTR/proHB-EGF, were surface-biotinylated and lysed. The lysate was precipitated with DT and immobilized anti-DT antibody in the presence or absence of exogenous heparin. The precipitated materials were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Similar species of HB-EGF/DTR with molecular masses of 21-28 kDa were precipitated from the cell lysate in the presence or absence of heparin, but much more DTR/proHB-EGF was precipitated in the presence of heparin (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, when cell lysate was first treated with heparitinase and then precipitated with DT and anti-DT antibody, the amount of DTR/proHB-EGF precipitated was greatly diminished. Addition of heparin to heparitinase-treated cell lysate restored the precipitation efficiency. These results indicate that heparin-like molecules are involved in DT binding by Vero cells. A human recombinant HB-EGF corresponding to residues 73-147 of the DTR/proHB-EGF precursor was immobilized on CH-activated Sepharose 4B gels, and binding of 125I-DT to the Sepharose gels was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of heparin. Fig. 7A shows that heparin-dependent binding was observed with the immobilized HB-EGF as well. Saturation binding experiments were also performed with increasing concentrations of125I-DT in the presence or absence of heparin (Fig. 7B). Scatchard plot analysis showed that the Ka values in presence of heparin was 7.7 × 108M-1, compared to 2.6 × 108M-1 in the absence of heparin. Bmax values were similar with or without heparin, indicating that heparin potentiates DT binding activity of HB-EGF by increasing the affinity and of DTR/proHB-EGF for DT rather than by increasing the number of binding sites. DRAP27/CD9 is known to enhance DT binding activity in the presence of DTR/proHB-EGF(8Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Google Scholar, 16Mitamura T. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Yomo T. Urabe I. Tsuneoka M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1389-1399Google Scholar), and we showed in this study that heparin-like molecules are required for maximal DT binding. To determine whether heparin and DRAP27/CD9 potentiate DT binding by independent mechanisms, we examined the effect of heparin on the binding of DT to LH cells and LCH cells. LH cells are stable transfectants of mouse L cells expressing human DTR/proHB-EGF alone, and LCH cells are stable transfectants of mouse L cells expressing both DTR/proHB-EGF and DRAP27/CD9(8Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Google Scholar). LH cells and LCH cells express similar amounts of DTR/proHB-EGF on the cell surface, but LCH cells bind DT 15-30 times more than LH cells due to the enhancing effect of DRAP27/CD9. Fig. 8A shows the binding of DT to LH cells and LCH cells in the presence or absence of heparin. Binding of DT to LH cells was increased about 2-fold by addition of heparin. However, the amount bound was much lower than with LCH cells, indicating that heparin cannot replace the effect of DRAP27/CD9. DT binding to LCH cells was increased similarly by addition of heparin, indicating that the effects of heparin and DRAP27/CD9 are additive for in LCH cells. The amount of HS-GAG displayed on the surface of L cells was slightly higher than on CHO-K1 cells, but only about 3% of the amount on Vero cells (Fig. 1). As with CHO-K1 cells, addition of exogenous heparin may increase DT binding to LH cells and LCH cells because of the relatively low amount of HSPG on the cell surface. Scatchard plot analysis more clearly demonstrates the difference in mode of actions of DRAP27/CD9 and heparin-like molecules. Heparin increased the affinities of both LH cells and LCH cells for DT but did not change the binding site numbers. The Ka values for LH cells in the presence or absence of heparin were 6.8 × 108M-1 and 1.7 × 108M-1, respectively, while the Ka values for LCH cells in the presence or absence of heparin were 1.5 × 109M-1 and 0.56 × 109M-1. DRAP27/CD9 increased DT-binding site numbers rather than changing the affinity(8Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Google Scholar, 17Brown J.G. Almond B.D. Naglich J.G. Eidels L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8184-8188Google Scholar). The difference in the affinities for DT of the LH cells and LCH cells used here is probably due to clonal variations. We conclude that DRAP27/CD9 and heparin potentiate DT binding to DTR/proHB-EGF by independent mechanisms. DTR/HB-EGF has a strong affinity for heparin and HS(18Ono M. Raab G. Lau K. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31315-31321Google Scholar, 19Thompson S.A. Higashiyama S. Wood K. Pollitt N.S. Damm D. McEnroe G. Garrick B. Ashton N. Lau K. Hancock N. Klagsbrun M. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2541-2549Google Scholar), suggesting that the effect of heparin on the binding of DT is due to the interaction of heparin with DTR/proHB-EGF. Although there is no reason to expect direct interaction between DT and heparin, the possibility that heparin also interacts with DT and modifies directly the receptor-binding property of DT was remained. To examine whether DT itself binds heparin, 125I-DT was incubated with heparin-Sepharose and binding of 125I-DT to heparin-Sepharose gels was measured. As shown in Table 1, only 1.1% of the radioactivity of 125I-DT added remained to heparin-Sepharose gels in normal saline, and this value was almost similar to that obtained by using control Sepharose gels. When 125I-DT was incubated with heparin-Sepharose gels in the presence of the recombinant HB-EGF, more than 34% of DT added was adsorbed to heparin-Sepharose gels. These results clearly indicate that DT binds to heparin-Sepharose in the presence of HB-EGF but does not directly interact with heparin.TABLE I Open table in a new tab DT specifically binds to the diphtheria toxin receptor, the DTR/proHB-EGF molecule. Binding of DT to the receptor is one of the key steps in the intoxication process, and the sensitivity of cells to DT is primarily determined by the number of receptors(3Middlebrook J.L. Dorland R.B. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7325-7330Google Scholar, 37Mekada E. Kohno K. Ishiura M. Uchida T. Okada Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 109: 792-799Google Scholar, 38Kohno K. Uchida T. Mekada E. Okada Y. Somatic Cell Genet. 1985; 11: 421-431Google Scholar). Our recent studies revealed, however, that a second factor, in addition to DTR/proHB-EGF itself, is required for maximal DT binding activity. The membrane protein DRAP27/CD9 up-regulates DT binding and DT sensitivity as a co-factor of DTR/proHB-EGF(8Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Google Scholar, 15Iwamoto R. Senoh H. Okada Y. Uchida T. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20463-20469Google Scholar, 16Mitamura T. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Yomo T. Urabe I. Tsuneoka M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1389-1399Google Scholar). We showed here that heparin-like molecules, probably in the form of HSPG on the cell surface, are a third factor required for maximal DT binding and DT sensitivity. The requirement for heparin-like molecules for full DT binding activity is indicated by the following evidence: (i) HS-deficient CHO mutant 677 cells are less sensitive to DT than the wild type CHO-K1 cells, and the decreased DT sensitivity is restored by the addition of free HS or heparin; (ii) 677H cells bind 125I-DT in a heparin-dependent manner; (iii) treatment with chlorate or heparitinase to diminish cell surface HS decreases the binding of DT; (iv) binding of 125I-DT to a recombinant HB-EGF in vitro is heparin-dependent. We propose that the heparin-like molecules responsible for enhancing DT binding probably exist as HSPG rather than as proteoglycans with dermatan sulfate or free heparin, because DT binding activity of Vero cells and Vero cell lysates was greatly diminished by treatment with heparitinase, which hydrolyses HS-GAG, but not dermatan sulfate or heparin. Increased binding of DT after addition of free heparin or HS was most striking in HS-deficient 677 cells, but was also observed to a lesser extent in CHO-K1 cells and L cells expressing human HB-EGF (LH and LCH cells). No increase of DT binding was observed when heparin was added to Vero cells. The difference in heparin dependence among cell lines can be explained by differences in the amount of cell surface HS-GAG. The amount of HS on the surface of Vero cells is about 70 times higher than on CHO-K1 cells and about 35 times higher than on L cells. The amount of HS on CHO-K1 cells and L cells does not appear to be sufficient for interaction with all of the DTR/proHB-EGF, thus exogenous heparin or HS increases the binding of DT to these cells, although the effect is less than that seen with 677 cells. Since DTR/proHB-EGF molecules are overexpressed in LH and LCH cells, much more HSPG may be required for maximal DT binding by these cells, making the heparin dependence more apparent. Vero cells contain abundant HS on the cell surface, and exogenous heparin is not required for maximal binding. However, when cell surface HS is removed by the treatment with heparitinase, or when the cell membrane is solubilized, Vero cells show heparin-dependent binding of DT. How is the binding of DT to the cells increased by heparin-like molecules? DTR/proHB-EGF, like mature HB-EGF, binds heparin tightly, while DT itself is not bound to heparin-Sepharose (Table 1). Therefore, the effect of heparin on the binding of DT must result from the interaction of heparin with DTR/proHB-EGF molecules. Highly cationic amino acids clusters located within and upstream of the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF form the putative heparin-binding domain(19Thompson S.A. Higashiyama S. Wood K. Pollitt N.S. Damm D. McEnroe G. Garrick B. Ashton N. Lau K. Hancock N. Klagsbrun M. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2541-2549Google Scholar). We have previously shown that DT binds to the EGF-like domain of DTR/proHB-EGF molecule. Because cells expressing a deletion mutant of DTR/proHB-EGF, HΔ (63-105) that lacks most of the heparin-binding domain still bind DT(14Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1015-1019Google Scholar), it is likely that the heparin-binding domain modulates the binding activity for DT rather than forming the binding site itself. Therefore, we propose that binding of heparin, or HSPG, to the heparin-binding domain brings about a conformational change in the DTR/proHB-EGF molecule, resulting in increased affinity for DT by an allosteric effect, similar to the induced-fit model shown originally in the interaction of bFGF with heparin(20Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Google Scholar). Heparin and DRAP27/CD9 potentiate the binding of DT by different mechanisms. Heparin increases the affinity of DTR/proHB-EGF for DT but does not change the number of binding sites, while DRAP27/CD9 increases the number of DT-binding sites but does not changes the Ka value(8Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Google Scholar, 17Brown J.G. Almond B.D. Naglich J.G. Eidels L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8184-8188Google Scholar). The Ka for DT of L cells expressing both DTR/proHB-EGF and DRAP27/CD9 for DT is still lower than that of Vero cells(8Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Google Scholar, 17Brown J.G. Almond B.D. Naglich J.G. Eidels L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8184-8188Google Scholar). We showed here that Ka values of LH cells and LCH cells for DT in the presence of heparin are similar to that of Vero cells. Therefore, the lower abundance of heparin-like molecules on the cell surface is likely to be responsible for the lower affinity of L cells. We propose a model for the role of HSPG and DRAP27/CD9 in the binding of DTR/proHB-EGF molecule with DT (Fig. 9). Although the precise mechanism for the enhancing effect of DRAP27/CD9 is not clear, we speculate that DTR/proHB-EGF alone may not be stably retained on the cell surface. Association of DRAP27/CD9 with DTR/proHB-EGF may stabilize DTR/proHB-EGF, and thus DRAP27/CD9 would up-regulate DT binding and mitogenic activity. Cell surface HSPG, or exogenous heparin, binds to the heparin-binding domain of DTR/proHB-EGF, and changes the conformation of the EGF-like domain, resulting in increased of affinity for DT. The present studies demonstrate that full DT binding activity is achieved in the presence of heparin-like molecules. DT sensitivity is higher at low cell densities than under confluent conditions(39Schaefer E.M. Moering J.M. Moering T.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 135: 407-415Google Scholar), indicating that close contacts between cells are not required for the maximal DT sensitivity. This implies that DTR/proHB-EGF on the cell surface can interact with its HSPG on the same cell. We showed recently that the complex comprising DTR/proHB-EGF and DRAP27/CD9 associates with integrin α3β1 as well(40Nakamura K. Iwamoto R. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1691-1705Google Scholar). DTR/proHB-EGF may form a large functional complex including DRAP27/CD9, integrin α3β1 and HSPG. Although present study does not define whether a specific class of HSPG is involved in the interaction with DTR/proHB-EGF, studies of specificity of HSPG interacting with DTR/proHB-EGF may provide further understanding of the physiological role of DTR/proHB-EGF as a membrane-anchored growth factor, as well as the DT receptor. We wish to thank Dr. Judy Abraham for providing recombinant HB-EGF. We are grateful to Dr. Ryo Iwamoto for valuable suggestions and to Dr. Michael R. Moynihan for critical reading of the manuscript."

Med. 1992; 176: 751-760Google Scholar). A characteristic shared by immunophilins is peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase (PPIase) activity(8Siekierka J.J. Hung S.H.Y. Poe M. Lin C.S. Sigal N.H.

Uehling D.E. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1989; 341: 755-757Google Scholar). However, the inhibition of PPIase activity in itself does not appear to be responsible for the immunosuppressant effect of the drugs(7Dumont F.J. Staruch M.J. Koprak S.L. Siekierka J.J. Lin C.S.

This report describes the molecular cloning, sequencing, and biochemical characterization of a novel 65-kDa protein, FKBP65, isolated from a NIH3T3 fibroblast cDNA library. We show that this protein, as well as containing four peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase domains, possesses PPIase activity comparable to other FKBPs and appears to be a new and distinct FKBP family member. L-[35S]Methionine, [35S]dATPαS, [α-32P] dCTP, [32P]orthophosphate, and protein molecular weight markers were from Amersham. Methionine- or phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, heat-inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, and agarose were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Penicillin/streptomycin and L-glutamine were from MediaTech (Washington, D. C.). Peptides corresponding to amino acids 369-386 (Pep 2) and 566-581 (Pep 4) were synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Macromolecular Resources, Colorado State University, Ft. Collins, CO). Rabbits were immunized with Freund's adjuvant in accordance with National Cancer Institute and National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Anti-Pep 2 antiserum was used to screen a JB6 murine epidermal cell (18Colburn N.H. Wendel E. Abruzzo G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6912-6916Google Scholar) cDNA expression library (Stratagene). A 2468-bp clone was isolated and sequenced(19Simek S.L. Kozak C.A. Winterstein D. Hegamyer G. Colburn N.H. Genomics. 1993; 18: 407-409Google Scholar). A 1700-bp (EcoRI-SacI) segment of the 2.4-kb clone was then used to screen a λ Zap NIH3T3 fibroblast cDNA library (Stratagene). Hybridization was performed at 42°C for 48 h in 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 40% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA. The most stringent wash was done at 0.2 × SSC with 0.1% SDS at 65°C. Autoradiography was carried out at -70°C for 24 h with an intensifying screen. Eight positive clones were excised from the phagemid library and sequenced. Both strands of the largest insert (2.6 kb) were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method with Sequenase Version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp./Amersham Life Science) using [35S]dATP and the Sequa Gel urea gel system (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). Total RNA (20 μg) from various mouse tissues (Clontech, San Francisco, CA) was electrophoresed in a 3.9 M formaldehyde, 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.6, 1.0% agarose gel, transferred to MagnaNylon Membrane (Micron Separations Inc., Westborough, MA), and hybridized with the 1.7-kb cDNA probe (described above) in FastPair (Digene, Silver Spring, MD) at 42°C for 48 h. The most stringent wash was in 0.4 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 65°C. NIH3T3 fibroblast cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated calf serum, 2 mML-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C, 5% CO2. A 1600-bp segment of the FKBP65 clone was subcloned into the pET21d+ vector, and protein was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (Novagen, Madison, WI). Cell pellets were treated with lysozyme (Sigma), sonicated in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol, pelleted at 20,000 × g, and solubilized in 6 M guanidine-HCl, 40 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1% β-mercaptoethanol(20Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Google Scholar). Further purification was by RP-HPLC (μBondapak C18 PrepPak cartridge 10 μm, 125 Å, 25 × 100 mm, Waters, Bedford MA) and verified as FKBP65 by peptide sequencing. Recombinant FKBP65 (rFKBP65) was renatured prior to using in the PPIase assay. The isomerization activity of the renatured rFKBP65 was assayed as described (8Siekierka J.J. Hung S.H.Y. Poe M. Lin C.S. Sigal N.H. Nature. 1989; 341: 755-757Google Scholar, 9Standaert R.F. Galat A. Verdine G.L. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1990; 346: 671-674Google Scholar) with minor modifications, using N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (Sigma) as substrate at a final concentration of 108 μM, preincubated with rFKBP65 (8-80 nM final concentration) at ambient temperature. α-Chymotrypsin (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 27 μM. Absorbance readings were taken immediately upon mixing in a Perkin Elmer Lambda 6 spectrophotometer at 395 nm at 0.2-s intervals for 180 s. Drug inhibition studies were performed as described above except various amounts of FK506 or rapamycin (27-200 μM final concentration) were added to the substrate/FKBP65 mixture using 16 nM FKBP65. The kcat/Km was determined by plotting the observed rate constants (kobs) versus rFKBP65 concentration (data not shown). The first order rate constant (kobs) was calculated from the slope of the plot of the log of the difference between absorbance at steady state and absorbance at time t plotted against time(21Harrison R.K. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1684-1689Google Scholar, 22Harrison R.K. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3813-3816Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 1 h at 37°C, 5% CO2. The cells were labeled for 3 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham) and then lysed in TNT (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) with 1% Aprotinin and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C and precleared with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia-LKB, Uppsala, Sweden) and preimmune serum followed by immune precipitation with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B and Pep 4 antiserum with or without peptide competitor. Samples were electrophoresed using the method of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and the gels were enhanced with Fluoro-Hance (Research Products International, Mt. Pleasant, IL), dried, and exposed to film for 24 h at -70°C. NIH3T3 cells were labeled in vitro with [35S]methionine and immune-precipitated as described above, after which samples were denatured by boiling, cooled to 37°C prior to adding 0.4 unit of Endo-F (endoglycosidase F, N-glycosidase F-free; Boehringer Mannheim), and incubated for 3 h at 37°C(24Plummer T.H. Elder J.H. Alexander S. Phelan A.W. Tarentino A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10700-10704Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed as described above. The in vivo [32P]orthophosphate labeling has been described in detail previously(25Simek S.L. Kligman D. Patel J. Colburn N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7410-7414Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in TNT, immune-precipitated and electrophoresed (described above), electroblotted onto ImmobilonP™ (Millipore), and exposed to film. Western blotting was performed on the membranes after the 32P had decayed by incubating overnight with a 1:1000 dilution of Pep 4 antiserum. The filter was washed and then incubated with 5 × 105 cpm/ml 125I-protein A and exposed to film. A unique 2468-bp clone was isolated from a mouse JB6 epidermal cell cDNA λ Zap expression library and sequenced(19Simek S.L. Kozak C.A. Winterstein D. Hegamyer G. Colburn N.H. Genomics. 1993; 18: 407-409Google Scholar). We considered this clone to represent a partial gene sequence because the first methionine residue did not completely comply with a Kozak consensus initiation sequence(26Kozak M. Nucleic Acid Res. 1984; 12: 857-870Google Scholar), and an upstream stop codon was not encoded within the 5′ region of the JB6 clone. To obtain additional 5′ and 3′ sequences, an internal 1.7-kb segment of the 2.4-kb clone was used to screen an NIH3T3 fibroblast λ Zap cDNA library. A 2636-bp clone was obtained and sequenced as described under “Experimental Procedures” (GenBank™ accession L07063). The 2.6-kb clone was identical with the 2.4-kb clone except that it contained an additional 5′ sequence, which included a TAG stop codon 48 bp upstream from the first methionine, a polyadenylation signal (AATGAAA) located at bp 2431-2437, a 3′-untranslated region from nucleotides 1837-2597 (Fig. 1A), and a 39-nucleotide poly(A) tail (data not shown). This clone contained an ORF of 1743 nucleotides (nucleotides 94-1836) encoding a protein of 581 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 64,683 daltons and a calculated pI of 5.43 and predicted molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 52,170. The predicted amino acid sequence of FKBP65 revealed a highly hydrophobic region (residues 14-23) suggesting an NH2-terminal signal sequence (Fig. 1A, bold sequence). We analyzed the amino acid pattern of FKBP65 using the method of Von Heijne (27Van Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Google Scholar) for predicting potential cleavage processing sites in a pre-protein. Based on this method, we predict that FKBP65 is cleaved after Arg33, resulting in a mature protein with a calculated molecular mass of 60,576 daltons. Additionally, there is a potential membrane-spanning segment (amino acid residues 244-258) consisting of hydrophobic residues (Fig. 1A, italicized sequence), as well as an ER retention sequence (HEEL) at the COOH terminus(28Pelham H.R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 15: 483-486Google Scholar). Analysis of the 2.6-kb clone, using the University of Wisconsin GCG software analysis program(29Devereaux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acid Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Google Scholar), revealed a domain containing significant amino acid sequence similarity to members of the FK506/rapamycin-binding protein (FKBP) family(19Simek S.L. Kozak C.A. Winterstein D. Hegamyer G. Colburn N.H. Genomics. 1993; 18: 407-409Google Scholar). In accordance with the convention for naming FKBP family members corresponding to their calculated molecular weights(17Peattie D.A. Harding M.W. Fleming M.A. DeCenzo M.T. Lippke J.A. Livingston D.J. Benasutti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10974-10978Google Scholar), we have renamed the protein previously designated FKBPRP (19Simek S.L. Kozak C.A. Winterstein D. Hegamyer G. Colburn N.H. Genomics. 1993; 18: 407-409Google Scholar) as FKBP65. Overall, FKBP65 shares 46% and 43% amino acid sequence identity with human FKBP12 and FKBP13, respectively, and 35% and 26% sequence homology with human FKBP25 and FKBP52 (FKBP59, hsp56, or HBI). Additional sequence analysis of the 2.6-kb FKBP65 clone revealed four peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase (PPIase) signature domains as defined by the Motifs program (GCG, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI; (29Devereaux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acid Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Google Scholar)). These four domains are located at amino acid residues 61-149, 173-261, 285-373, and 398-485 and represent 67% of the protein (Fig. 1B). The regions flanking the four PPIase domains share 30% similarity; however, they appear to be unique as they show no homology with other FKBP family members or any sequences reported in available data bases. The FKBP65 PPIase Domain II conforms to the PPIase consensus motif, whereas the other three domains each contain one mismatch (Fig. 1B). Crystallographic studies of FK506 bound to human FKBP12 (hFKBP12) have identified two regions within the PPIase domain that appear to be important for FK506-binding interactions. There are five amino acid residues (Tyr26, Phe99, Val55, Ile56, and Trp59) proposed to form the hydrophobic drug binding cavity and three amino acid residues (Ile56, Asp37, and Tyr82) of hFKBP12 that appear to form hydrogen bonds with FK506(30Moore J.M. Peattie D.A. Fitzgibbon M.J. Thomson J.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 248-250Google Scholar, 31Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Science. 1991; 252: 839-842Google Scholar). These seven amino acids are conserved in all FKBPs that have been identified to date. Sequence alignment of hFKBP12 with the four PPIase domains of FKBP65 reveals that Domains I-III of FKBP65 strictly conserve six of these seven amino acid residues and Domain IV conserves five of the seven amino acids (Fig. 1B). Unlike the ubiquitously expressed FKBPs identified to date, FKBP65 mRNA shows restricted expression. Northern blot analysis reveals a unique 2.6-kb RNA band in mouse lung, spleen, heart, and brain that hybridizes to a radiolabeled 1.7-kb (ORF) fragment of the FKBP65 clone (Fig. 2). The testis mRNA appears to contain two transcripts, the 2.6-kb band and an additional 3.5-kb band. Although RNA was visualized in all lanes, by either ethidium bromide staining of the gel prior to blotting or hybridization with an actin probe (data not shown), no FKBP65-specific hybridization in liver RNA was seen. To determine if FKBP65 possessed PPIase activity, recombinant FKBP65 (rFKBP65) was expressed using the pET21d+ expression vector (20Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Google Scholar) and purified by RP-HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 3A, lane 2). The purified rFKBP65 was renatured and utilized in the coupled peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase assay developed by Fischer et al.(32Fischer G. Wittmann-Liebold B. Lang K. Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X. Nature. 1989; 337: 476-478Google Scholar). The PPIase assay measures the cis to trans isomerization of the prolyl peptide bond in the peptide, N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide. Chymotrypsin readily cleaves the trans form of the peptide, releasing p-nitroanilide, which is quantitated spectrophotometrically (Fig. 3B). The initial burst observed in the progress curves is a result of the large percentage of the peptide that exists in the trans conformation at ambient temperature. When rFKBP65 is preincubated with the peptide substrate (Fig. 3B, curve a), the rate of cis to trans isomerization is significantly higher than the chymotrypsin control (Fig. 3B, curve e). Recombinant FKBP65 appears to be fully active, and we have calculated the kcat/Km of rFKBP65 (described under “Experimental Procedures”) for the cis-trans isomerization of N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide of 0.64 × 106M-1•s-1, which is comparable to the PPIase activity of the other FKBPs(21Harrison R.K. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1684-1689Google Scholar, 22Harrison R.K. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3813-3816Google Scholar). Additionally, the PPIase activity of rFKBP65 is specifically inhibited by the addition of FK506 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B, curves b-d). Since the assay is not under pure Michaelis-Menten conditions, only an IC50 rather than a Ki can be obtained. An IC50 value of 45 nM was found for FK506 (data not shown). The PPIase activity of rFKBP65 is also potently inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by rapamycin (27-200 nM), but is unaffected by the addition of 5 μM Cyclosporin A (data not shown). To detect FKBP65 protein, two polyclonal antisera (Pep 2 and Pep 4) were raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides derived from the predicted sequence of FKBP65, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Although both peptide antisera gave similar results, we used Pep 4 antiserum, raised against the carboxyl terminus of FKBP65 (Fig. 1A, underlined sequence) because it reacted more strongly in immune precipitations and Western blots. Pep 4 antiserum was used to immunoprecipitate total cell lysates of [35S]methionine-labeled NIH3T3 cells. Despite the calculated molecular mass of 64,683 or 60,576 for the NH2-terminal cleaved protein, two prominent bands migrating at approximately 72 and 68 kDa were observed (Fig. 4, lane 2) that were specifically competed when peptide was added during immune precipitation (Fig. 4, lane 3). The discrepancy between apparent and calculated molecular masses is observed with other FKBP family members(9Standaert R.F. Galat A. Verdine G.L. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1990; 346: 671-674Google Scholar, 10Harding M.W. Galat A. Uehling D.E. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1989; 341: 755-757Google Scholar, 12Jin Y.-J. Albers M.W. Lane W.S. Bierer B.E. Schreiber S.L. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6677-6681Google Scholar, 14Galat A. Lane W.S. Standaert R.F. Schreiber S.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2427-2434Google Scholar, 16Lebeau M.-C. Massol N. Herrick J. Faber L.E. Renoir J.-M. Radanyi C. Baulieu E.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4281-4284Google Scholar, 33Tai P.K.K. Albers M. Chang H. Faber L.E. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1992; 256 (1315-1059)Google Scholar). The increase in apparent molecular weight may be due to the presence of post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and/or phosphorylation. The predicted amino acid sequence contains seven potential N-glycosylation sites and 14 potential casein kinase II phosphorylation sites. Additionally, FKBP65 contains one cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site, one protein kinase C phosphorylation site, and two tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, FKBP65 contains nine proline-proline sequences that may alter the protein structure resulting in an altered migration on SDS-PAGE and increasing its apparent size. To determine if FKBP65 was glycosylated, NIH3T3 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, precipitated with Pep 4 antiserum, and incubated for 3 h with N-endoglycosidase F (Endo-F; Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 5) or in Endo-F buffer alone (Fig. 4, lanes 1-3). The Endo-F-treated FKBP65 migrates at an apparent molecular weight of 58,000 (Fig. 4, lane 4). To confirm that the 58-kDa band was the unglycosylated form of FKBP65, Western blot analysis of Endo-F-treated lysates was performed (data not shown), and an immunoreactive 58-kDa band was visualized. Additionally, when NIH3T3 cells are pretreated with either 2-deoxyglucose or tunicamycin, agents that interfere with protein glycosylation, the unglycosylated 58-kDa species also was observed. These results demonstrate that FKBP65 is a glycoprotein. The observance of two precipitated bands may reflect the difference between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of FKBP65 or alternatively may represent the product from a different translational start site. There is a second methionine residue 60 amino acids downstream from the first ATG sequence. This second ATG contains a nearly perfect Kozak consensus sequence (26Kozak M. Nucleic Acid Res. 1984; 12: 857-870Google Scholar) and may encode a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 57,000; however, typically only a single 2.6-kb transcript is seen (Fig. 2). To determine if FKBP65 also is phosphorylated, NIH3T3 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate followed by immune precipitation with Pep 4 antiserum as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The immune precipitates were visualized by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE and electroblotting onto ImmobilonP™. A specific band at a relative molecular mass of 72,000 (Fig. 5A, lane 2) was observed. The 32P-labeled blot was allowed to decay prior to Western blot analysis (Fig. 5B), and alignment of the two autoradiographs confirms that the 32P-labeled protein is FKBP65 and represents the top 72-kDa band observed during immune precipitation. We have identified a mouse gene encoding a 65-kDa protein (FKBP65) that shares homology with members of the FK506-binding protein class of immunophilins. In this study, we report the cloning, sequencing, and biochemical characterization of a unique 2636-bp clone isolated from a NIH3T3 fibroblast λ Zap cDNA library. The 2.6-kb FKBP65 clone contains an ORF encoding a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 64,683 daltons; however, the presence of a hydrophobic leader sequence and a predicted cleavage site would result in a mature protein with a molecular mass of 60,576. Amino acid sequence comparison of FKBP65 to other FKBP family members revealed from 26% (human FKBP52) to 46% (hFKBP12) overall sequence homology. Additionally, FKBP65 contains four FK506-binding protein PPIase signature domains. The regions flanking the four PPIase domains retain 30% similarity and appear to be unique as they are not homologous to other FKBPs or any sequences reported in available data bases. The first three domains of FKBP65 conserve six of the seven amino acid residues reported to be involved with FK506-binding interactions. We have expressed rFKBP65 in the pET21d+ expression vector and demonstrate that rFKBP65 has PPIase activity with kinetics similar to other FKBPs that is inhibitable by FK506 and rapamycin, but not Cyclosporin A. Although FKBP65 is approximately the same relative size of the larger, multidomain FKBP52 that associates with steroid receptors(16Lebeau M.-C. Massol N. Herrick J. Faber L.E. Renoir J.-M. Radanyi C. Baulieu E.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4281-4284Google Scholar, 17Peattie D.A. Harding M.W. Fleming M.A. DeCenzo M.T. Lippke J.A. Livingston D.J. Benasutti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 2868-2871Google Scholar), FKBP65 is distinct from FKBP52 that contains three FKBP12-like PPIase domains. Likewise, FKBP65 appears to be distinct from p50 and p54, two FKBP-related proteins recently shown to complex with the avian progesterone receptor(36Smith D.F. Baggenstoss B.A. Marion T.N.

Collectively, these observations strongly suggest that FKBP65 is a new FKBP family member. Another distinguishing factor of FKBP65 is the tissue distribution. A unique 2.6-kb mRNA band was found in lung, spleen, heart, and brain, but not in liver. This result suggests that FKBP65, unlike other FKBP family members, may not be ubiquitously expressed. The second, larger band detected in the testis may reflect a related protein or an alternate form of FKBP65. We have recently isolated a partial human clone 1M. Coss and S. Simek, unpublished results. that, when used as a probe, detects a 3.5-kb band in human mRNA. Using a rabbit polyclonal peptide antibody, two specific bands (72 and 68 kDa) were detected by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis in NIH3T3 cell lysates. The appearance of two precipitable bands may be the product resulting from a second, downstream methionine or reflect a difference in phosphorylation states. When cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, only the upper, 72-kDa band was visualized; however, both bands are observed on Western blot analysis. Although FKBP65 appears to be a phosphoprotein, there is no identified ATP binding site within the sequence. We have shown that FKBP65 is a glycoprotein, an observation that can account for the difference observed between the calculated and apparent molecular weights; however, the unglycosylated form migrates at an apparent molecular weight of 58,000 that is smaller than the predicated molecular weight of 60,576. This additional difference may be due in part to the large number of proline residues (37 in the mature protein) including nine Pro-Pro sequences that may alter protein structure leading to an altered migration on SDS-PAGE. The functional diversity of the FKBP family members may be due to their distinct subcellular localization and association with different protein complexes. The multidomain FKBP52 has been shown to associate with hsp90, hsp70, and the unactivated steroid receptors(16Lebeau M.-C. Massol N. Herrick J. Faber L.E. Renoir J.-M. Radanyi C. Baulieu E.-E. J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1945; 92: 1784-1788Google Scholar), both of which mediate calcium release processes. The predicted amino acid sequence of FKBP65 reveals a potential ER retention sequence and a possible membrane-spanning sequence, suggesting localization to the ER. Using various cellular fractionation protocols, we have localized FKBP65 to the membrane and cytosolic fractions; however, due to the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides, the appearance of FKBP65 in the cytosolic fraction may be a result of inadequate fractionation and/or contamination from the ER fractions. The presence of four PPIase domains of FKBP65 suggest that they may function to interact with more than one molecule within a complex of proteins or act stoichiometrically with the same molecule. We are currently investigating proteins that associate with FKBP65, using affinity-purified protein and NIH3T3 lysates with or without FK506 or rapamycin treatment. To identify the possible functions of FKBP65 and associated proteins, we are currently generating FKBP65 mutants to assess the functional roles of the four PPIase domains. Using the Pep 4 polyclonal antibody, immunoreactive FKBP65 also has been detected by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting techniques in human cell lines,2 and we are currently in the process of isolating the human homologue of FKBP65. This will allow precise comparisons of the various human FK506-binding proteins and possible detection of additional genes related to FKBP65. We thank Drs. Dan L. Longo and Raymond V.

https://openalex.org/W2127800756,"The mammary gland is a unique biosynthetic tissue that produces a variety of species-specific glycoconjugates, but the factors regulating the production of specific glycoconjugates are not well understood. To explore the underlying regulation, a fusion gene containing a cDNA encoding the human α1,2-fucosyltransferase (α1,2FT), which generates the H-blood group antigen, flanked by the murine whey acidic protein promoter and a polyadenylation signal, was introduced into mice. Milk samples from transgenic animals contained soluble forms of the α1,2FT, as revealed by Western blots of milk samples using an anti-α1,2FT antiserum and by the demonstration of α1,2FT enzyme activity. Milk from transgenic animals also contained large quantities of 2′-fucosyllactose (Fucα1-2Galβ1-4Glc) and modified glycoproteins containing the H-antigen, whereas milk from control animals lacked these glycoconjugates. Expression levels of 2′-fucosyllactose were high in most animals and represented to nearly of the total milk oligosaccharides. These results demonstrate that heterologous transgenic expression of a glycosyltransferase can result in the expression of both the transgene and its secondary gene products and that the structures of milk oligosaccharides can be remodeled depending on expression of the appropriate enzyme. Furthermore, these results suggest that the lactating mammary gland may be a unique biosynthetic reactor for the production of biologically active oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates.

Furthermore, these results suggest that the lactating mammary gland may be a unique biosynthetic reactor for the production of biologically active oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates. Despite the fact that animal oligosaccharides are important in many biological and pathological processes (Karlsson, 1989; Kornfeld, 1992; Drickamer and Taylor, 1993; McEver et al., 1995), little is known about the regulation of animal cell glycoconjugate biosynthesis. Biosynthesis is influenced by expression of appropriate glycosyltransferases, correct targeting of the enzymes to the Golgi apparatus, sugar nucleotide levels, competition between enzymes, residence time of glycoconjugates in intracellular compartments, acceptor specificity of the enzymes, and many other factors (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985; Kobata and Takasaki, 1992; Cummings, 1992; Baenziger, 1994). Experimental modulation of these factors has been difficult. One approach that has proven somewhat successful in vitro is to attempt to alter oligosaccharide biosynthesis by genetic manipulation of glycosyltransferases (Lee et al., 1989; Smith et al., 1990; Lowe et al., 1990). This approach has so far been limited to cultured and immortalized cell lines and has been useful in producing neoglycoconjugates for biological studies (Lowe et al., 1990). One major site for glycoconjugate biosynthesis in animals, and one that has been of enormous historical importance in the field of glycobiology, is the lactating mammary gland. Milk contains, in addition to lactose, numerous glycoproteins (Patton et al., 1990; Fiat and Jollès, 1989) and a variety of free oligosaccharides (Kobata et al., 1972). The structure and composition of the free oligosaccharides in milk differ between mammals, but the human lactating mammary gland synthesizes the most complex mixture of free, reducing oligosaccharides, many of which contain fucose and other determinants for human blood groups, including the ABO and Lewis system. The structures of some of these oligosaccharides in humans are determined genetically by the expression of glycosyltransferases during lactation and the availability of sugar nucleotide substrates (Hill and Brew, 1975; Ginsburg, 1972; Smith et al. 1987), but the precise mechanisms regulating differential expression of individual milk oligosaccharides are not known. Recent advances in transgenic technology have resulted in successful expression of transgene-encoded proteins in animal milk (Wilde et al., 1992; Paleyanda et al., 1991; Archer et al., 1994). Using this methodology, we have begun to explore factors regulating glycoconjugate biosynthesis. Our analyses of normal mouse milk demonstrated that it is deficient in fucose-containing oligosaccharides, and in particular it lacks oligosaccharides containing the H-blood group antigen. Based on this information, we chose to use a cDNA encoding a human α1,2-fucosyltransferase (α1,2FT) ( (1)The abbreviations used are: α1,2FTα1,2-fucosyltransferaseHPAEChigh performance anion exchange chromatographyFACEfluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis3-FL3-fucosyllactose (Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)Glc)DFLdifucosyllactose (Fucα1-2Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)Glc)WAPwhey acidic proteinkbkilobase(s)FBSfetal bovine serumbGHbovine growth hormoneUEA IU. europaeus agglutinin I.) responsible for synthesis of the blood group H-antigen Fucα1-2Galβ1-3(4)-R (Rajan et al., 1989; Larsen et al., 1990). Our studies demonstrate that the human α1,2FT can be successfully introduced into transgenic animals causing the lactating mammary gland to synthesize relatively large quantities of oligosaccharides containing the H-antigen and at least one major glycoprotein containing this determinant. These studies provide new insights into the factors regulating biosynthesis of milk oligosaccharides within the lactating mammary gland and a new approach for studying factors controlling glycoconjugate biosynthesis. α1,2-fucosyltransferase high performance anion exchange chromatography fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis 3-fucosyllactose (Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)Glc) difucosyllactose (Fucα1-2Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)Glc) whey acidic protein kilobase(s) fetal bovine serum bovine growth hormone U. europaeus agglutinin I. The human α1,2FT was cloned by polymerase chain reaction from an epidermal carcinoma cell line (A431) cDNA library using primers derived from the previously published α1,2FT gene sequence (Larsen et al., 1990). Direct sequencing of the α1,2FT cDNA confirmed its identity with the known sequence. To demonstrate that the cDNA encoded a functional α1,2FT enzyme, the α1,2FT cDNA was inserted into an expression plasmid (pMet-FucT-bGH) and introduced into mouse L cells, which do not contain either α1,2FT enzyme activity or H-blood group antigens. This plasmid utilizes the mouse metallothionein-I promoter (Bayne et al., 1987) to direct expression and contains the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal (bGH poly(A)) for proper mRNA processing. Recombinant enzyme activity was demonstrated in the mouse L cells by indirect immunofluorescent staining of positive transfectants with Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA I) (Sigma), which reacts with H-blood group antigen, and a monoclonal antibody against H-blood group antigen (Dako Corp.). To generate antibody to the α1,2FT, the cDNA encoding the α1,2FT was subcloned into an inducible expression vector (pQE11) (Qiagen, Inc.) in frame with a 6 × histidine tag. This 6 × histidine-tagged protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography and injected in rabbits to generate polyclonal antibodies to the α1,2FT. For transgenic studies, the cDNA fragment encoding the α1,2FT was inserted into a second expression plasmid, pWAP-α1,2FT (Fig. 1). This plasmid contains bGH poly(A) and utilizes the murine whey acidic protein (WAP) promoter (Pittius et al., 1988) to direct gene expression primarily to lactating mammary gland tissue. An EcoRI-BamHI DNA fragment containing the WAP-α1,2FT-bGH poly(A) sequences was isolated from this plasmid and injected into fertilized mouse (B6/SJL) eggs as described previously (McGrane et al., 1988). The WAP promoter was generously provided by Dr. Lothar Hennighausen (National Institutes of Health). Individual milk samples were obtained from transgenic and non-transgenic mothers after nursing the pups for 5-12 days. Samples were collected using a mammary suction apparatus consisting of a 23-gauge needle and a vacuum line connected to a trap test tube. Samples were frozen on dry ice and stored at -70°C. Oligosaccharide extracts were prepared using a method modified from Kobata et al.(1972). Typically, 50-100-μl milk aliquots were centrifuged for 15 min at 11,000 × g. The resulting lipid pads were removed from the top, and the liquid layer was transferred to a clean vial. A 2-fold volume of cold ethanol was added with mixing, and the samples were then centrifuged as before. The clear supernatants were transferred to clean vials and dried for further analysis. Precipitates, containing the proteins, were dried and stored at -70°C until used for further analysis. Oligosaccharides were separated, detected, and quantified by high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) and fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE). HPAEC was performed by a method adapted from Reddy and Bush(1991). Oligosaccharide standards for HPAEC and FACE were obtained from V-Labs Inc. (Covington, LA). Individually dried oligosaccharide extracts from mouse milk, prepared as above, were resuspended in water to the original volume of their respective milk samples. Aliquots (20 μl) were injected onto a Dionex CarboPac-PA1 analytical column. Analytes were detected using a pulsed electrochemical detector equipped with a gold working electrode and a pH reference electrode. Elution was started with a solution of 100 mM NaOH (RICCA Chemicals, Arlington, TX) held steady for 12 min and changed to 7% of 600 mM sodium acetate in 100 mM NaOH. After 8 min, this percentage was increased to 10% and held constant for 7 min. Flow rate was maintained at 1 ml/min. The column was washed in a mixture of 50% 100 mM NaOH, 50% 600 mM sodium acetate in 100 mM NaOH and equilibrated for 15 min in starting solution before reuse. After detection, the elution stream was desalted using a Dionex AMMS-II anion micromembrane suppresser fitted with an AutoRegen apparatus equipped with an anion exchange cartridge and 0.15% H2SO4 regenerant solution. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and immediately frozen for lyophilization. Fractions obtained by HPAEC (or glycosidase digests from these fractions) were submitted to FACE analysis (Jackson, 1990; Stack and Sullivan, 1992). Electrophoresis equipment, imager, labeling, and reducing reagents for fluorophore labeling were from Glyko Inc. (Novato, CA). Manufacturer's procedures were followed. Fucosidases from Corynebacterium sp. (α1-2 specific) and Streptomyces (α1-3/4 specific) were from Takara Panvera (Madison, WI), and Escherichia coli galactosidase was from Boehringer Mannheim. All other chemicals used were from the highest purity available and, unless otherwise indicated, were from Sigma. The milk protein pellets obtained by ethanol precipitation as described above were tested for the presence of the α1,2FT polypeptide by immunoblot using antisera raised against the recombinant enzyme. Pellets were resuspended in a volume of SDS equal to that of the original volume of the milk sample. Aliquots (5 μl) of resuspended pellets were electrophoresed on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels (Laemmli, 1970). Resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 1 h at 100 volts. The resulting membranes were blocked by incubation in 50 mM TBS, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 M NaCl and 2% gelatin. Membranes were washed three times in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and were incubated for 18 h in 1% gelatin/TBS containing 1:500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-α1,2FT. Membranes were then incubated with 1% gelatin/TBS containing goat anti-rabbit IgG previously conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and washed with TBS-Tween. Proteins were visualized by incubating in 50 ml of TBS containing 0.018% hydrogen peroxide and 10 ml of methanol containing 30 mg of 4-chloro-napthol. Blotted proteins on nitrocellulose membranes were probed for the presence of α1,2-linked fucose by incubating for 18 h in a 2% gelatin/TBS containing a 1:500 dilution of the peroxidase labeled UEA-I (Sigma). The resulting membranes were then washed, and proteins were visualized by incubating in a mixture of 50 ml of TBS containing 0.018% hydrogen peroxide and 10 ml of methanol containing 30 mg of 4-chloronapthol (Bio-Rad). To determine a suitable glycosyltransferase for mammary gland-directed transgenic expression in mice, we analyzed mouse milk oligosaccharides using HPAEC. Mouse milk contains lactose, sialyllactoses, and other oligosaccharides (Fig. 2, panel A). One of the minor oligosaccharides of murine milk coeluted with authentic 3-fucosyllactose (3-FL, Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)Glc). Its identity was further confirmed by fucosidase digestion and FACE analysis (data not shown). This demonstrates that mouse milk contains detectable but low levels of 3-FL. 2′-Fucosyllactose (Fucα1-2Galβ1-4Glc), which is an isomer of 3-FL, was not detected in the milk of control animals. In a separate experiment, a milk sample was exhaustively treated with a mixture of fucosidases, and the amount of released fucose was determined by HPAEC. Mouse milk was found to contain approximately 1 nmol of fucose per 100 μl. Although the amounts of total fucose and 3-FL in mouse milk are minuscule, their presence indicates that lactating mouse mammary glands most likely contain GDP-Fuc, which is the donor sugar nucleotide for fucosyltransferases. The absence of 2′-FL in mouse milk suggests that the lactating mammary gland of the mouse lacks α1,2-fucosyltransferase activity. A fusion gene containing a cDNA encoding the human α1,2FT was prepared and injected into mouse embryos as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A total of 85 pups were obtained from these injections, and 9 of these animals (8 male and 1 female) were found to contain at least one copy of the transgene by quantitative slot blot hybridization (McGrane et al., 1988). Six of the transgenic animals (all male) were mated to normal mice, resulting in a total of 98 F1 progeny. 38 of these animals (19 males/19 females) contained the α1,2FT gene. 15 of the females were bred with normal mice. Subsequent generations (F2 and F3) were obtained by interbreeding transgenic animals. Milk samples from transgenic and control non-transgenic animals were either directly tested for enzyme activity or, alternatively, treated with ethanol to obtain oligosaccharide extracts and protein pellets described under “Experimental Procedures.” Milk samples from transgenic animals contained detectable α1,2FT activity as determined by a method modified from Rajan et al.(1989), while activity was absent in samples from control animals (data not shown). These results demonstrate that active α1,2FT enzyme was expressed in milk from transgenic animals. The presence of α1,2FT polypeptide was determined by immunoblot analysis of milk protein using a polyclonal rabbit antibody against α1,2FT, as shown in Fig. 3. No immunoreactive protein was present in milk from control animals, whereas milk from transgenic animals contained four immunoreactive species of apparent molecular mass of 46, 32, 30, and 25 kDa (Fig. 3). The α1,2FT cDNA encodes the full-length type-2 transmembrane form of the enzyme that has a predicted size of approximately 46 kDa when fully glycosylated. Whether the 46-kDa form of the α1,2FT observed in transgenic milk represents a full-length form of the enzyme or a partly degraded form with altered glycosylation is not yet known. Nevertheless, the presence of discrete lower molecular weight forms of the enzyme in milk indicates discrete proteolytic cleavages of the polypeptide resulting in the species observed. These lower molecular weight forms were not found in cell extracts of α1,2FT transfected mouse L-cells. The potential proteolytic cleavage sites of the recombinant enzyme are under investigation. Oligosaccharide extracts of milk samples from transgenic mice were analyzed for the presence of fucosylated oligosaccharides expected to be synthesized by the expressed α1,2FT. Milk oligosaccharides from two transgenic animals were analyzed by Dionex-HPAEC and compared to those in milk from a control mouse (Fig. 2, panels B and C). A major neooligosaccharide found in the milk of the transgenic animals eluted on Dionex-HPAEC identically to authentic 2′-FL. Analysis of milk from other donors revealed that this neooligosaccharide was present in all milk samples obtained from transgenic animals of all generations with the exception of one F1 donor. To confirm that the neooligosaccharide in the milk of transgenic animals was 2′-FL, the purified oligosaccharide collected after Dionex-HPAEC was subjected to FACE analysis and specific enzyme degradation. An electrophoretogram of the neooligosaccharide before and after treatment with α1,2-specific fucosidase from Corynebacterium sp. is shown in Fig. 4. The fluorophore-labeled neooligosaccharide (lane 4) comigrated with authentic 2′-FL (lane 2), and, like the standard 2′-FL, it was susceptible to the action of the α1,2-specific fucosidase (lanes 3 and 5). The neooligosaccharide was also exhaustively treated with a combination of the α1,2-specific fucosidase and E. coli β-galactosidase. This combined treatment resulted in the release of equimolar amounts of fucose, galactose, and glucose, as determined by FACE analysis (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the neooligosaccharide present in the milk of transgenic animals expressing the human α1,2FT is 2′-FL. A minor oligosaccharide that coelutes with the human milk tetrasaccharide difucosyllactose (DFL, Fucα1-2Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)Glc) was also detected in the chromatographic profiles from transgenic animals (Fig. 2, panels B and C). Fractions corresponding to the elution time of this oligosaccharide were pooled and analyzed by FACE. The resulting band obtained from transgenic animal milk comigrated with authentic DFL (data not shown). Results were consistent with the presence of this oligosaccharide only in milk from transgenic animals. It is expected that this product is generated by the sequential action of the α1,2FT and the endogenous α1,3FT. The milk proteins of transgenic and control animals were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. These blots were then assayed for the presence of Fucα1-2Galβ1-R determinants using the plant lectin UEA-I, which displays high affinity for H-blood group determinants (Allen et al., 1977; Hindsgaul et al., 1982). The milk of control animals lacked glycoproteins reactive with UEA-I, whereas milk of transgenic animals contained a major reactive glycoprotein of apparent molecular mass of 35-40 kDa in addition to a minor reactive band of 29 kDa (Fig. 5). This pattern is different from that observed for the recombinant α1,2FT (Fig. 3). This major fucosylated glycoprotein may be casein, but this is under investigation. These results demonstrate at least one major glycoprotein is an acceptor for the transgenically expressed human α1,2FT and becomes highly modified by the enzyme, whereas other glycoproteins in the milk appear to be less efficiently modified. Table 1 is a summary of results for control and transgenic animals generated by different founders and belonging to different generations. Transgenic mice obtained from founders 28 and 34 (Table 1) produced typical amounts of 2′-FL (average 2.2 g/liter). In one case, the amount of 2′-FL (Ho-29-129) was almost one-half of the total milk oligosaccharides, demonstrating that it was present at a level approximately equal to that of lactose. The transgene has been stable through the germ line for three generations as reflected by the ability to synthesize 2′-FL. Interestingly, the ability to synthesize α1,2-fucosylated glycoconjugates seems to be independent of the number of transgene copies as determined by tail biopsy analyses (Table 1).TABLE I Open table in a new tab Results presented in this report demonstrate that it is possible to dramatically alter the structure of the milk oligosaccharides and glycoproteins by the transgenic introduction of a heterologous glycosyltransferase under the control of a lactogenically induced expression of the enzyme. We chose the human α1,2FT as a model enzyme to explore its expression within the mammary gland and the consequences of its expression on biosynthesis of milk glycoconjugates. We found that 2′-FL, which is lacking in normal mouse milk, was a major oligosaccharide in the milk of transgenic animals and was present at levels rivaling that of lactose. In addition, active human α1,2FT and an oligosaccharide that coelutes with difucosyllactose were found in the milk, and at least one milk glycoprotein was a major substrate for the transgenic α1,2FT. Biosynthesis of milk oligosaccharides from lactose would be expected to be directly related to the expression of particular glycosyltransferases, but other factors, such as sugar nucleotide availability, lactose availability, enzyme localization, enzyme secretion, etc., could profoundly alter biosynthesis. We reasoned that the experimental introduction of the transgenic α1,2FT would test many of these factors. For example, we considered the possibility that the low levels of 3-FL, the absence of 2′-FL, and the low amount of fucose in mouse milk might be due to a low expression of GDP-Fuc. The high level expression of 2′-FL we observed, however, indicates that the Golgi apparatus of the lactating mammary gland must be sufficiently adaptable in regard to GDP-Fuc uptake to accommodate the need of the transgenic α1,2FT. We also considered the possibility that the transgenic α1,2FT might be proteolytically processed within the lactating mammary gland and be either inactivated or quantitatively secreted without being functionally present in the Golgi apparatus. It is conceivable that some other glycosyltransferase genes expressed as transgenes within the lactating mammary gland will not be functional and be unable to cause the efficient remodeling of milk glycoconjugates. Further studies with other genes are required to address the generality of this phenomenon. All samples from homozygous animals analyzed so far contained more 2′-FL than those of hemizygous descendants of the same founder. There were, however, variations of 2′-FL content among milk samples from hemizygous animals descending from the same founder. We have found that in humans, milk oligosaccharide content varies between samples from the same donor (data not shown). In mice, lactation stage, number of pups, age, and nutritional status are some of the factors that may contribute to the observed differences. The functions of milk oligosaccharides are not known, but free oligosaccharides are known to influence the adhesion of pathogenic bacteria to human tissue in vivo (Andersson et al., 1986), suggesting that milk oligosaccharides may have a protective function in the infant. The ability to remodel milk oligosaccharides by the heterologous expression of glycosyltransferase genes should facilitate future experiments aimed at defining the biological functions of the lactose-derived oligosaccharides. In addition, the transgenic expression of glycosyltransferases in lactating mammary glands presents a unique opportunity to develop technology that may result in the synthesis of large amounts of neooligosaccharides and substantially modified glycoproteins with therapeutic or industrial value.

https://openalex.org/W1535233331,"The alternative forms of the DnaX protein found in Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, τ and γ, were purified from extracts of strains carrying overexpressing plasmids mutated in their frameshifting sequences such that they produced only one subunit or the other. The purified subunits were used to reconstitute the τ andγ complexes which were characterized by functional assays. The γ complex-reconstituted holoenzyme required a stoichiometric excess of DNA polymerase III core, beyond physiological levels, for activity. The τ subunit stimulated theγ complex 2-fold, but could not be used to reconstitute a holoenzyme with γ complex and stoichiometric quantities of core. In the presence of adenosine 5′-O-(3′-thiotriphospate) (ATPγ S), the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme behaves as an asymmetric dimer; it can form only initiation complexes with primed DNA in one-half of the enzyme (Johanson, K. O., and McHenry, C. S.(1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 4589-4595). An asymmetric distribution of two products of the dnaX gene, γ and τ, has been postulated to underlie the asymmetry of holoenzyme. To provide a direct test for this hypothesis, we reconstituted holoenzyme containing only the γ or τ DnaX proteins. We observed that, although γ could function in the presence of ATPγ and high concentrations of DNA polymerase III core, it was nearly inert in the presence of ATPγ S. In contrast, τ -containing holoenzyme behaved exactly like native holoenzyme in the presence of ATPγ S. These results implicate τ as a key component required to reconstitute holoenzyme with native behavior and show that τ plays a key role in initiation complex formation. These results also show that γ is not a necessary component, since all of the known properties of native holoenzyme can be reproduced with a 9-subunit τ -holoenzyme.

Like many other complex mechanisms of macromolecular synthesis, the fundamental mechanisms of DNA replication are conserved throughout biology. The chemistry and direction of synthesis, the requirement for RNA primers, the mechanisms of semi-discontinuous replication with Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand, and the need for well defined origins are shared. There are also striking similarities between the individual components of the complex machinery responsible for this process.

The replicative polymerase assumes its special role because of its ability to interact with other specialized proteins at the replication fork. In E. coli, the DNA polymerase III core (α-ε-θ) interacts with a β subunit sliding clamp to enable maximum processivity (LaDuca et al., 1986). The gene 45 protein of T4 and eukaryotic PCNA exhibit similar properties (Burgers and Yoder, 1993; Reddy et al., 1993). The sliding clamp in all replication systems is a bracelet-like multimeric protein clasped around DNA. It contacts the polymerase, providing a tether to increase processivity. The crystal structures of yeast PCNA and E. coli β are nearly superimposable (Kong et al., 1992; Krishna et al., 1994). Functional and structural studies of the T4 gene 45 sliding clamp indicate that it forms similar structures and functions like β and PCNA (Hacker and Alberts, 1994; Kaboord and Benkovic, 1993; Gogol et al., 1992; Venkatesan and Nossal, 1982). In E. coli, the β sliding clamp is set by either of two DnaX complexes that contain either of two products of the dnaX gene, γ or τ, in a complex with δ -δ′ and χ-ψ (McHenry et al., 1986; Maki and Kornberg, 1988; O'Donnell and Studwell, 1990). The activity of this complex requires the ATPase activity of the DnaX proteins, presumably to couple ATP hydrolysis to β assembly on primed DNA (Lee and Walker, 1987; Hawker and McHenry, 1987; O'Donnell et al. 1993, Oberfelder and McHenry, 1987). Two additional proteins, δ and δ′, are required to assemble a functional clamp loader (Onrust and O'Donnell, 1993). The χ-ψ proteins are also participants; they bind to DnaX and increase its affinity for δ -δ′ so that they can cooperatively assemble a functional complex at physiological protein levels (Olson et al., 1995). In eukaryotes, a 5-protein complex (Activator 1, RFC) is responsible for transferring the sliding clamp onto a primer terminus in an ATP-dependent reaction (Lee et al., 1991; Bunz et al., 1993). The proteins exhibit sequence homology between eukaryotes and both Gram-negative and -positive prokaryotes, and would be expected to act by a similar mechanism (Carter et al., 1993; O'Donnell et al., 1993). Asymmetric replicative complexes have been proposed in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. In eukaryotes the δ polymerase has been suggested as the leading strand polymerase and ε as the lagging strand (Turchi and Bambara, 1993; Araki et al., 1992; Hübscher and Thömmes, 1992; Burgers, 1991; Nethanel and Kaufmann, 1990). In E. coli, the replicative complex apparently forms a dimer (McHenry, 1982; Studwell-Vaughan and O'Donnell, 1991) that behaves asymmetrically (Johanson and McHenry, 1984; McHenry and Johanson, 1984), and proposals have been made concerning the enzyme having a distinguishable leading and lagging strand, capable of performing the distinct specialized functions expected of each polymerase (Hawker and McHenry, 1987; McHenry, 1988; Maki et al., 1988). The initial observation that provided functional evidence for asymmetry and led to the formulation of the asymmetric dimer hypothesis came from the use of the ATP analog ATPγ S in initiation complex formation in native holoenzyme in a concerted reaction where the DnaX complex assembled the β clamp in the presence of associated polymerase (Johanson and McHenry, 1984; McHenry and Johanson, 1984). All of the enzyme formed initiation complexes in the presence of ATPγ, but only one-half of the enzyme entered functioning initiation complexes in the presence of ATPγ S (Johanson and McHenry, 1984). This asymmetry in the presence of ATPS was not an equilibrium artifact, since the 50/50 distribution was independent of ATPγ S concentration once the enzyme was saturated, and the reactions did not progress beyond the 50% level with increasing time. It was proposed that this asymmetric behavior arose not from two distinct populations of enzymes in solution, but from a difference between two halves of an asymmetric dimeric DNA polymerase with distinguishable leading and lagging strand halves. Efforts to determine the basis of this functional asymmetry have focused on the two products of the dnaX gene, τ and γ (Hawker and McHenry, 1987; McHenry, 1988; Maki et al., 1988; O'Donnell and Studwell, 1990). Translation of dnaX mRNA produces full-length τ (71,000 Da) and a product resulting from -1 translational frameshifting into a frame with a stop codon, γ (47,400 Da) (McHenry et al., 1989; Tsuchihashi and Kornberg, 1990; Blinkowa and Walker, 1990; Flower and McHenry, 1990). These two products were found within the same holoenzyme assembly (Hawker and McHenry, 1987) and it was suggested that an asymmetric holoenzyme may arise from an asymmetric assembly of these two DnaX proteins (Hawker and McHenry, 1987; McHenry, 1988; Maki et al., 1988). Consistent with this hypothesis, τ has been shown to influence synthesis on the two strands asymmetrically on natural coupled replication forks (Wu et al. 1992). Despite the attractive hypothesis concerning asymmetric placement of τ and γ within holoenzyme, a definitive test has not been made. In this report, we describe our use of a DnaX overproducing strain engineered to produce only τ or γ. This enabled purification of γ, free of possible proteolytic breakdown products of τ, and provided a rich source of the τ subunit, free of possible contaminating γ. We used these purified subunits to explore the functional differences in their contribution to the holoenzyme reaction and to definitively test whether DnaX protein placement underlies the functional asymmetry of holoenzyme. Plasmid pJF119EH was obtained from Peter Fürste (Fürste et al., 1986) and pDM1 was obtained from Mead et al.(1985). Plasmid pMWZ1101, containing the wild-type apt, dnaX genes, and a portion of orf12, was constructed by M. Welch in this laboratory. E. coli strain HB101 (F-, Δ(gpt-proA)62, leuB6, supE44, ara-14, galK2, lacY1, Δ(mcrC-mrr) rpsL20(Strr), xyl-5, mtl-1, recA13) was used for transformations and for protein expression. Oligonucleotide 1 (see Fig. 1A) was inserted into EcoRI- and PstI-digested plasmid pJF119EH. Oligonucleotide 1 was constructed such that it introduced an optimal Shine-Dalgarno sequence (Reznikoff and Gold, 1986), a start codon, frequently used codons in place of the rare codons in the initial dnaX sequence, and a NarI cloning site (used in the next cloning step). The remaining dnaX sequence was obtained from a NarI-PstI fragment of pMWZ1101. The resulting plasmid, pBBMD11, produced both τ and γ when induced with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside. To provide a plasmid suitable for production of single-stranded DNA for mutagenesis, we cloned the fl phage origin (obtained as a HincII fragment from pDM1) into the NaeI site of PBBMD11 resulting in plasmid pRT610. Plasmid pRT610 was transformed into strain XL-1 Blue (recA1, endA1, gyrA96, thi, hsdR17 (rk-,mk+), supE44, relA1, λ-, lac-, {F′, proAB, lacIqZΔM15, Tn10(tetr)}, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to obtain single-stranded DNA. Oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis of pRT610 was performed as described by Kunkel (1985) and Kunkel et al.(1987). The resulting plasmids were sequenced to verify the incorporation of the proper mutations. These were: buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% (w/v) sucrose, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM benzamidine, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride); buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% (w/v) sucrose, 2 M NaCl, 0.3 M spermidine); buffer TBP (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20% (w/v) glycerol, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM benzamidine, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride); buffer SP (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 5 mM dithiothreitol); and buffer N (20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 50 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl2) and Buffer H (25 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 25 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA). The τ and γ subunit overproducing strains, HB101/pRT610-A and HB101/pRT610-B, were grown in 200 liters of F medium (14 g/liter yeast extract, 8 g/liter tryptone, 12 g/liter K2HPO4, 1.2 g/liter; KH2PO4, pH 7.2) + 1% glucose, and 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37°C. Cells were induced (OD600 = 1.2) with isopropyl-β-D-thio-galactoside (1 mM final concentration) for 3 h before harvesting (OD600 = 3.1). Cells were harvested in a Sharples continuous flow centrifuge and resuspended in buffer A at 50% (w/v). Cells were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. All procedures were performed at 4°C unless otherwise stated. For both the τ and γ purifications, 120 g of frozen cells (240 g of cell paste) were resuspended in 330 ml of buffer A and 30 ml of buffer B. Lysozyme (120 mg in 8 ml of buffer A) was added, and cells were lysed for 1 h on ice and for 4 min at 37°C. The lysate was centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 1 h to remove debris. Supernatants were pooled to yield fraction I (Cull and McHenry, 1995). Fraction I was precipitated with 107 g of ammonium sulfate (0.226 g for each ml of fraction I, 40% saturation) and centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 30 min. Pellets were backwashed by resuspension in a Dounce homogenizer with 100 ml of buffer TBP + 0.1 M NaCl containing 0.2 g/ml ammonium sulfate (35% saturation), and recentrifuged as before. A second backwash using 50 ml of 0.17 g/ml ammonium sulfate (30% saturation) in buffer TBP + 0.1 M NaCl was done as above. The final pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored frozen at -80°C as fraction II. One-half of fraction II pellets were dissolved in buffer SP and diluted to a conductivity of 50 mM NaCl (226 ml). This material was loaded onto a 900-ml SP Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., 7.5 × 20 cm) column equilibrated with buffer SP. After loading, the column was washed with 1-column volume of buffer SP and developed with a 9-column volume gradient of 50-350 mM NaCl in buffer SP at a flow rate of 160-ml/h; 160-ml fractions were collected. Contaminant proteins did not bind to the column and were eluted during the initial wash. τ (fractions 31-33, conductivity = 250 mM NaCl equivalents) eluted as the only peak during the gradient. Fractions were pooled at one-half peak height (by activity) as fraction III. Fraction III was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (55% saturation) and centrifuged at 28,000 × g for 30 min. The fraction III pellet was dissolved in 19 ml of buffer H and centrifuged (28,000 × g, 30 min) to clarify. Fraction III was then applied to a 700-ml S-400 HR (Pharmacia) column (44:1 height:diameter ratio) equilibrated with buffer H. The column was developed in the same buffer at a flow rate of 22 ml/h, and 20-ml fractions were collected. τ (fractions 28 and 29) eluted as the only peak. These fractions were pooled, distributed in aliquots, which were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C as fraction IV. One-half of fraction II pellets were dissolved in buffer SP and diluted to a conductivity of 50 mM NaCl (244 ml). This material was loaded onto a 900-ml Q Sepharose (Pharmacia, 7.5 × 20 cm) column equilibrated in buffer SP. After loading, the column was washed with 1-column volume of buffer SP, then developed with a 9-column volume gradient of 50-400 mM NaCl in buffer SP at a flow rate of 160 ml/h, and 160-ml fractions were collected. γ (fractions 38-40, conductivity = 330 mM NaCl equivalents) was completely separated from a minor contaminant protein (40 kDa) which eluted five fractions earlier. Fractions were pooled at one-half peak height (by activity, fractions 38-40) as fraction III. Fraction III was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (55% saturation) and centrifuged at 28,000 × g for 30 min. The fraction III pellet was dissolved in 11 ml of buffer H and centrifuged (28,000 × g, 30 min) to clarify. Fraction III was applied to a 700-ml Sephacryl S-300 HR (Pharmacia) column (44:1 height:diameter ratio) equilibrated with buffer H. The column was developed in the same buffer at a flow rate of 17 ml/h, and 21-ml fractions were collected. γ (fractions 21-28) eluted as a single broad peak. These fractions were pooled and stored at -80°C as fraction IV in small aliquots. Assays of the τ and γ subunits contained 4 pmol of core (unless otherwise stated), 400 fmol of β, 540 pmol of M13Gori (as nucleotide), 500 fmol each of δ, δ′, and γψ, 60 units of DnaG primase, and 1.6 μg of E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB). Reactions were carried out in a volume of 25 μl in a buffer containing 50 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 M potassium glutamate, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20, 10 μM ATP, 48 μM dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, and 18 μM [3H]TTP (specific activity 520 cpm/pmol dTTP). Assays were incubated at 30°C for 5 min and quenched by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The unit definition for τ and γ activity is 1 pmol of total nucleotide incorporated into acid insoluble DNA in a 5-min reaction at 30°C. The τ and γ complexes used here were prepared and assayed as described in Dallmann and McHenry(1995). Initiation complexes were assayed as described by Johanson and McHenry(1984). Holoenzyme was reconstituted with core (typically 240 fmol unless otherwise stated), β (400 fmol), and the τ or γ complex (100 fmol) and compared to native holoenzyme. The above proteins were mixed with DnaG primase-primed, SSB-coated, M13Gori in the presence of nucleotide (ATP or ATPγ S), and incubated for 5 min at 30°C. Anti-β-IgG (8 μg) was added as a trap to prevent further initiation complex formation (Johanson and McHenry, 1984). Initiation complexes were quantitated by measuring DNA synthesis after the addition of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP (to 48 μM) and [3H]TTP (to 18 μM; specific activity, 520 cpm/pmol dTTP). The extinction coefficients of the τ and γ subunits were determined in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol, in the presence and absence of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. Spectra of τ and γ were measured on a Hewlett-Packard 8450A diode array spectrophotometer between 200 and 320 nm. The λmax for both proteins was 280 nm. Extinction coefficients for τ and γ in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride were calculated from the number of tryptophan and tyrosine residues in each protein as described by Edelhoch(1967). The ratio of the absorbance of the native proteins to the absorbance of the proteins in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride was used to correct the calculated extinction coefficients to obtain the coefficient for the native protein. The extinction coefficient for τ (monomer) was determined to be ε280 = 42,577 liters mol-1 cm-1, and that for γ (monomer), ε280 = 25,216 liters mol-1 cm-1. Chromatographic supports, proteins, holoenzyme subunits, and nucleic acids were obtained and/or prepared as described in Olson et al.(1995) and Johanson and McHenry(1984). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and protein determinations were performed as de-scribed in Olson et al.(1995). ATPγ S was purified to remove residual ATP as described in Johanson and McHenry(1984). To provide large quantities of τ and γ, we constructed a vector that contained the dnaX gene, modified to achieve maximal expression. This was accomplished by replacement of the region in front of the gene with oligonucleotide 1 (Fig. 1A) containing an optimal Shine-Dalgarno site and by replacement of rare codons in the first codons of the gene with common ones for the same amino acids (Reznikoff and Gold, 1986). This enabled expression of the two products of the dnaX gene to approximately 20% of the total E. coli protein (data not shown). Although this overexpression permitted purification of large quantities of γ and τ, this strategy suffered from two shortcomings: 1) the quantity of τ obtained was considerably lower than that of γ, presumably because of increased levels of frameshifting at high expression levels, and 2) the possibility existed that some of the γ obtained was contaminated by proteolyzed τ. ( (2)τ is particularly sensitive to E. coli proteases under specific conditions, yielding a protein close to γ in molecular weight (Blinkova et al. 1993).) To avoid these problems, we introduced specific mutations in dnaX at the site of frameshifting to construct plasmids that expressed only γ or τ. The plasmid producing only τ, pRT610A, was created using oligonucleotide 2 (Fig. 1B), which eliminated the frameshift region by altering two codons in the sequence, AAA AAG, to AAG AAA, without altering the corresponding Lys-Lys in the protein. The G → A mutation stabilized an A-U interaction between the mutant mRNA and the anticodon, perhaps discouraging slippage, but more importantly, the A → G mutation eliminated frameshifting by placing a G residue at a nonwobble position in the -1 frame where G-U base pairs are not possible (Flower and McHenry, 1990). This construct allowed the expression of τ only. The plasmid producing only γ, pRT610B, was created using oligonucleotide 3 for mutagenesis. This included the same mutations as in the τ -overproducing plasmid, eliminating frameshifting, but also included an in-frame codon for glutamate, followed by a stop codon, allowing expression of a protein equivalent to authentic frameshifted γ. The τ and γ subunits of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme were overexpressed and purified for use in functional analyses of τ and γ in holoenzyme and to provide sufficient material for structural studies (see Dallmann and McHenry (1995)). Both proteins were purified from E. coli strains containing expression plasmids that produced either τ or γ, not both subunits simultaneously (Fig. 1). τ and γ were purified to homogeneity (Figure 2:, Figure 3:) and retained high specific activities throughout their purifications (Table 1 and Table 2). Both proteins are stable at -80°C for over 1 year and for 1 week on ice.TABLE I Open table in a new tab TABLE II Open table in a new tab Preliminary experiments in which τ and γ were purified from a strain containing the expression plasmid pBBMD11, which contained the wild-type dnaX sequence and co-expressed both τ and γ, indicated that mixed τ/γ oligomers do not form to a significant extent in the absence of other overproduced subunits in vivo. Fig. 4A shows the protein and DNA synthesis activity profile of fraction II prepared from a strain containing pBBMD11 chromatographed on an S-Sepharose ion exchange column. Gel electrophoresis of the two major peaks in the profile revealed only γ in the first peak, while the second peak contained only τ (Fig. 4B). A mixed τ/γ oligomer would be expected to elute at a position between pure τγ; however, no such peak was seen. This observation implies that τ and γ do not form mixed oligomers in vivo when co-expressed, consistent with the results of Tsuchihashi and Kornberg(1989), who also purified τ and γ from a co-expressing plasmid and observed no mixed oligomers of τ and γ. Functional asymmetry in DNA polymerase III holoenzyme was originally demonstrated by the observation that the ATP analogue, ATPγ S, promoted only half the amount of initiation complex formation than ATP (Johanson and McHenry, 1984). Although the basis of this asymmetry was unknown, it was suggested that an asymmetric placement of the τ and γ subunits in holoenzyme was responsible and reflected properties of the leading and lagging strand polymerases (Hawker and McHenry, 1987). Both subunits have been isolated in subcomplexes of holoenzyme. The γ subunit has been isolated in the γ complex (γδδ′χψ) (McHenry et al., 1986; Maki and Kornberg, 1988), while τ has been isolated bound to core (αεθ) in DNA polymerase III′ (McHenry, 1982). Both τ and γ share the same 446 N-terminal residues and can interact with δ, δ′, and χψ to form “DnaX complexes” (Onrust and O'Donnell, 1993; Xiao et al., 1993). Olson et al.(1995) have shown that the assembly of DnaX complexes is cooperative and that χψ increases the affinity of δ -δ′ for τ and γ. The availability of overproduced, purified subunits allowed reconstitution of DnaX complexes (Dallmann and McHenry, 1995) and reexamination of the effect of ATPγ S on holoenzyme reconstituted with either τ or γ to directly test whether one of these subunits uses ATPγ S uniquely. Initiation complexes were formed using ATP or ATPγ S with τ complex, core, and β (Fig. 5A), with γ complex, high concentrations of core, and β (Fig. 5B) and with native holoenzyme purified from E. coli (Fig. 5C). Using native holoenzyme, ATPγ S resulted in approximately one-half the amount of initiation complexes formed compared to ATP, in agreement with the results of Johanson and McHenry (1984). As expected, ATP also supported initiation complex formation with both τ and γ complexes, whereas ATPγ S did not support initiation complex formation with γ complex and only supported half the amount of initiation complex formation with τ complex, compared to ATP. The result with τ complex-reconstituted holoenzyme was identical to that observed with native holoenzyme (Fig. 5C) (Johanson and McHenry, 1984). Thus, the τ subunit/complex must play a major role in loading β subunit clamps onto primed DNA in native holoenzyme. A striking result from this experiment was that τ complex-reconstituted holoenzyme was indistinguishable from native holoenzyme, whereas γ complex-reconstituted holoenzyme was very different. Clearly the asymmetric behavior of holoenzyme, as revealed by the differential effects of ATP and ATPγ S, was not due to asymmetric placement of τ and γ within holoenzyme, but instead reflects properties of the τ subunit alone. To exclude the possibility that the above result reflected partial proteolysis of the τ subunit to a γ -like protein (Blinkova et al. 1993), an experiment was carried out in which initiation complexes prepared using τ complex with ATP and ATPγ S were purified by gel filtration over Bio-Gel A5m (Bio-Rad) columns (Johanson and McHenry, 1984), and fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using an anti-τ/γ polyclonal antibody. No cleavage of τ to a γ -like protein was observed. Furthermore, activity assays of the column fractions showed that only half the amount of initiation complex was obtained with ATPγ S compared to ATP (data not shown), consistent with the above results. Early in the development of assays for the τ and γ complexes, it was noted that, under our standard assay conditions containing 100 mM potassium glutamate, γ complex required large amounts of core before any significant DNA synthesis activity was observed. In experiments in which core was titrated into γ and τ complex assays (Fig. 6). τ complex showed maximal activity at the lowest amount of core used (240 fmol); however, γ complex required 4 pmol of core to achieve an activity comparable to that of τ complex. Evidently the interaction of the τ subunit with core (McHenry, 1982; Studwell-Vaughan and O'Donnell, 1991) produced a more active polymerase than enzyme reconstituted with γ complex and core, which are not known to interact directly. Because both τ and γ are present in native holoenzyme as currently isolated, we asked whether titration of the τ or γ subunits into the τ or γ complexes affected activity. Titration of the γ subunit into the τ or γ complex assays produced no effect (data not shown), whereas titration of the τ subunit into the τ or γ complex assays stimulated the reaction (Fig. 7). Titration of τ (0-1600 fmol) into τ complex (100 fmol/assay, 4 nM) caused a 2-fold inhibition of DNA synthesis, presumably due to competition between τ and τ complex in binding core. Titration of the τ subunit (0-1600 fmol) into γ complex (100 fmol/assay, 4 nM) consistently gave a 2-fold stimulation of DNA synthesis regardless of the amount of core used in the assays. As described above, γ complex required a large excess of core (∼40-fold) to achieve activity levels comparable to those with τ complex performed with stoichiometric amounts of core (Fig. 6 and, in Fig. 7, compare DNA synthesis levels at 0 fmol of τ in γ complex assays). The titrations of τ into γ complex assays in Fig. 7 were performed at decreasing levels of core (γ complex:core ratios, 1:10, 1:4, and 1:2) to determine whether τ could recruit the γ complex into a reconstituted holoenzyme. If τ acts as an organizing center for the assembly of a holoenzyme that includes the γ subunit, one might expect that the addition of τ to γ complex assays performed at stoichiometric levels of core would yield DNA synthesis activities at least comparable to that of τ complex alone. Alternatively, the effect of added τ in γ complex assays may only be related to the dimerization of core or due to conformational changes induced by the τ -α contact, and not due to a recruitment of γ complex into holoenzyme. At decreasing levels of core, τ only caused a 2-fold stimulation of γ complex activity and did not appear to promote more efficient recruitment of γ complex into holoenzyme (Fig. 7). The 2-fold stimulation of γ complex by τ might also be explained by a reequilibration of the γ complex subunits during assays and the formation of significant amounts of τ complex in situ. However, when the τ subunit was preincubated with the γ complex at 15°C for various times before assaying, no time-dependent increase in activity occurred (Fig. 8). A control assay in which no τ was added gave 39 pmol of DNA synthesis. All other assays showed a 2-fold stimulation independent of preincubation time. This result suggests that any reequilibration of γ complex into τ complex in these assays is not responsible for the observed stimulation. The τ and γ subunits of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme were purified from overexpressing plasmids which produce only the τ or γ subunits (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:; TABLE I, TABLE II) in order to investigate the functions and physical properties of each subunit alone, without interference from the other. Experiments with an overproducing plasmid that co-expressed both τ and γ from the wild-type dnaX gene showed that the τ and γ subunits, overexpressed by themselves, do not form detectable quantities of mixed oligomers in vivo (Fig. 4), consistent with the observation of Tsuchihashi and Kornberg (1989). It has been suggested (Stukenberg et al., 1994; O'Donnell, 1994) that a mixed γτ assembly can be formed in vitro by incubation of γ with τ in the absence of other holoenzme subunits. However, our observation that γ and τ do not form detectable mixed assemblies in vivo shows that this assembly is not favored, at least not in the absence of other overproduced proteins.Figure 3:Purification of γ. Samples of Fractions I to IV were boiled in SDS sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Lane 1, fraction I (cell lysate); lane 2, fraction II (ammonium sulfate); lane 3, fraction III (Q-Sepharose peak); lane 4, fraction IV (Sephacryl S-300 HR peak). All lanes contain 80,000 units of γ (equivalent to 5 μg of fraction IV).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The purified τ and γ subunits were used to reconstitute the τ complex (τδδ′χψ) and γ complex (γδδ′χψ) (Dallmann and McHenry, 1995). These complexes were then mixed with polymerase III core and the β subunit in order to test the hypothesis that an asymmetric distribution of τ and γ in holoenzyme (Hawker and McHenry, 1987) was responsible for the asymmetric activity of holoenzyme when assayed with ATPγ S (Fig. 5C) (Johanson and McHenry, 1984). In these experiments, ATPγ S supported only half the amount of initiation complex formation as ATP. A possible interpretation is that only one of the DnaX components, either τ or γ, can hydrolyze ATPγ S to form initiation complexes, reflecting their asymmetric placement in holoenzyme. The prediction for the reconstitution experiment was that one of the τ - or γ -reconstituted holoenzymes would be inactive with ATPγ S and the other would display the same activity with ATPγ S as with ATP. Consistent with this prediction, ATPγ S did not support initiation complex formation with γ complex-reconstituted holoenzyme; however, with τ complex-reconstituted holoenzyme, ATPγ S supported only half the amount of initiation complex formation, compared to ATP, i.e. the τ complex reconstituted holoenzyme behaved exactly as native holoenzyme. This clearly indicated that the asymmetric behavior of holoenzyme, as revealed by the effect of ATPγ S, was not due to an asymmetric placement of τ and γ within holoenzyme, but reflected properties of the τ subunit alone. This result also demonstrated that the τ subunit/complex plays a role in loading β subunit clamps onto primed DNA in native holoenzyme, a point that was not previously clear. The above results raised a number of questions about the role of γ in holoenzyme. The τ subunit also functions to dimerize core (McHenry, 1982; Studwell-Vaughan and O'Donnell, 1991) and might serve as an organizing center for holoenzyme, recruiting the γ complex into holoenzyme (Stukenberg et al., 1994; O'Donnell, 1994). The data in Fig. 6 appeared to support this suggestion, since, in the absence of τ, γ complex required large amounts of core to yield activities comparable to that of τ complex with stoichiometric amounts of core. To address this possibility, we titrated τ into γ complex assays at various ratios of γ complex to core to determine whether τ can efficiently recruit γ complex into a holoenzyme that could function at stoichiometric levels of core (Fig. 7). Although τ caused a 2-fold stimulation of γ complex activity, this level of stimulation was seen at all concentrations of core used. This observation indicated that τ did not promote more efficient recruitment of γ complex into holoenzyme over the 5-min time course of the assay, a time sufficient for the synthesis of ∼300 Okazaki fragments. If it had, the stimulation by τ would have been expected to be more dramatic at lower enzyme concentrations, due to the greater effective concentration achieved because of proximity effects as γ complex was recruited into a holoenzyme complex. The possibility that dissociation of δ, δ′, and χψ from the γ complex, and assembly of significant amounts of τ complex accounted for the results in Fig. 7 was ruled out in an experiment in which the τ subunit and the γ complex were preincubated (Fig. 8). The lack of any increase over the 2-fold stimulation seen previously indicated the absence of any stripping of δ, δ′, and χψ from γ complex by the τ subunit within the time frame of the experiment. Additionally, the half-life for the dissociation of DnaX complexes was 1.4 h at 20°C (Olson et al., 1995), making the possibility of reequilibration of subunits unlikely in a 5-min assay. Holoenzyme reconstituted with the γ complex as the sole β clamp loader is functionally impaired when compared to native holoenzyme or to holoenzyme reconstitued with τ complex. In 100 mM potassium glutamate, a salt concentration that approximates the lower end of physiological ionic strength, the γ complex requires core at concentrations of ∼160 nM in order to achieve DNA synthesis levels approaching those of τ complex reconstituted with ∼10 nM core. If an E. coli cell contains 10-20 copies of holoenzyme (McHenry and Kornberg, 1977), its intracellular concentration would be ∼14-28 nM based on a cell volume of ∼1 fl (Ingraham et al., 1983). Clearly γ complex only appears to function at nonphysiological concentrations of core, whereas τ complex exhibits maximal activity at physiological concentrations. This study has provided a functional explanation for the observations of Blinkova et al.(1993) who found that mutant E. coli strains which do not express γ are viable, but that a temperature-sensitive mutation which interferes with τ function is lethal. Their additional observation of rapid proteolysis of τ to a γ -like protein, plus the functional aspects of γ activity presented here, raise the possibility that the γ subunit seen in the physical holoenzyme complex could result from cleavage of τ. Of course, the γ complex may have another ancillary role in DNA replication or repair. For example, mismatch repair requires a product of the dnaX gene (Lahue, et al. 1989) and would not be expected to require assembly of a dimeric replication fork. It is also possible that γ complex could serve a role for unloading β sliding clamps left behind during holoenzyme cycling (Stukenberg et al., 1994). After this manuscript was under review, a paper by O'Donnell and colleagues (Onrust et al., 1995) appeared reporting a γ -τ mixed complex requiring an excess of γ; significant complex formation did not occur at a 1:1 ratio between τ and γ, even at high, nonphysiological protein concentrations. We interpret this as further evidence that τ -τ and γ -γ interactions are favored over mixed DnaX protein assemblies in the absence of other holoenzyme subunits. In the absence of other interactions that pull equilibria favoring mixed DnaX assemblies, these would not be expected to form at significant levels in vivo. However, our finding does not exclude more complex mechanisms involving other holoenzyme or cellular proteins not present at adequate levels in the DnaX-overproducing cells to redirect the assembly pathway. In another report in the same series (Xiao et al., 1995), holoenzyme assembled with ATPase mutants of γ exhibited diminished replication activity, while enzyme assembled with ATPase mutants of τ appeared fully active. Our results with ATPγ S show that the full activity of holoenzyme can be reconstituted with τ only and that γ by itself is ineffective. The most direct interpretation of these results would be that τ serves as an ATPase to reproduce ATPγ S-dependent initiation complex formation with holoenzyme. Alternatively, τ could alter the conformation of γ within holoenzyme, enabling it to use ATPγ S as an effective substrate. We infer that τ can also participate in the ATPase-coupled initiation complex formation of native holoenzyme."

The DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, ( 1The abbreviations used are: holoenzymeE. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzymecoreE. coli DNA polymerase III core (α-ε-θ)γ complex(γ -δ -δ′χ -ψ)τ complex(τ -δ -δ′χ -ψ)DnaX complexa complex containing either product of the dnaX gene (γ or τ) with associated δ, δ′χψ, andSSBE. coli single-stranded DNA binding proteinMes2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographypol IIIpolymerase III.) the replicative polymerase of Escherichia coli, contains three essential subassemblies: (i) a polymerase that is able to interact with other specialized proteins at the replication fork, (ii) a β sliding clamp that tethers the polymerase to the template, enabling high processivity, and (iii) a DnaX complex that loads the sliding clamp onto the primer-template (see the companion study in this series, Dallmann et al.(1995), for a more thorough explanation and references). The holoenzyme is dimeric and functions asymmetrically, presumably because it contains distinct leading and lagging strand polymerases. We have demonstrated that the asymmetric function of the holoenzyme can be reconstituted using only the τ subunit, eliminating the possibility that an asymmetric placement of γ relative to τ is responsible for this asymmetry (Dallmann et al., 1995). E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme E. coli DNA polymerase III core (α-ε-θ) (γ -δ -δ′χ -ψ) (τ -δ -δ′χ -ψ) a complex containing either product of the dnaX gene (γ or τ) with associated δ, δ′χψ, and E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid high performance liquid chromatography polymerase III. In addition to the finding that τ alone permits reconstitution of native holoenzyme, other evidence implicates τ as a key essential component and relegates γ to nonessential roles that can be replaced by τ. Olson et al.(1995) demonstrated that the salt resistance of native holoenzyme required a τ -χ -ψ complex; γ -χ -ψ would not substitute. This suggests that τ is found complexed with auxiliary clamp loading subunits within holoenzyme. Blinkova et al.(1994) showed that E. coli are viable when their dnaX gene is mutated so that they cannot frameshift and only the τ product is produced. DNA polymerase III* isolated from these strains starts out in the γ -less form, but during purification, τ is rapidly proteolyzed to γ. We (Dallmann et al., 1995) and others (Tsuchihashi and Kornberg, 1989) have demonstrated that overproduction of both τ and γ in vivo from the wild-type dnaX gene results only in assembly of τ and γ oligomers; no mixed γ -τ oligomers are detectable. We have also shown that only τ complexes function at low, physiologically relevant concentrations of pol III core and that addition of free τ, although it stimulates the reactions, does not efficiently recruit γ complexes into an efficient holoenzyme during the 5-min time course of the reaction, a time adequate for replication of 300 Okazaki fragments in vivo. As a step toward resolving these issues, we analyzed formation of DnaX complexes under conditions that allow accurate determination of their stoichiometry and analysis of their interactions. We demonstrate that both τ and γ can form well defined complexes with δ -δ′ and χ -ψ, but that only the τ complex can efficiently enter holoenzyme. This work has led to a model for the DNA polymerase III* component of holoenzyme: (α-ε-θ)2(β2)2(DnaX4-δ -δ′-χ -ψ), where DnaX can be τ4 with preservation of all of the known properties of native holoenzyme. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis was carried out with a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. The buffer used for all experiments was 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol. Experiments were done using six-sector cells with multiple protein concentrations for each subunit (2.5, 5 and 10 μM for γ; 0.7, 1.4, 2.8, 7, 14, and 28 μM for τ). Both τ and γ were sedimented over a 60-h period at 15,000 rpm (4°C) in a Beckman An-Ti60 rotor. Radial absorbance scans (280 nm) were taken every 5 h. Only scans which indicated that equilibrium had been reached were used for analysis (typically >30 h). Data were analyzed using the IDEAL1 fitting program provided with the Beckman analysis software (version 2.0, 1993). The underlying model of this program assumes a single, ideal, sedimenting species. To calculate a native molecular weight the data were fit to : A(x)=e(HM(X2-x02))+E(Eq. 1) where A(x) is absorbance at radial position x; A0 is absorbance at radial position x0; H = (1-νρ)ω2/RT; ν = protein partial specific volume; ρ = solvent density; ω = angular velocity; R = gas constant; T = temperature (K); M = native molecular weight, and E is the base-line offset. Sedimentation velocity analysis of τ and γ was carried out in the same buffer as described above. Both τ and γ were sedimented at 30,000 rpm (4°C) at concentrations of 20 μM and 33 μM, respectively. Radial absorbance scans (280 nm) were taken at 30-min intervals. Data were analyzed using the second moment/boundary spreading (Muramatsu and Minton, 1988) and g*(s) (Stafford, 1992) methods provided with the Beckman analysis software. The τ and γ complexes were prepared by mixing the τ or γ subunits (10 nmol of monomer) with an excess of the δ and δ′ subunits and the χ -ψ complex (20 nmol monomer, each) in a volume of 0.5 ml (2.5 μM DnaX complex equivalent) unless otherwise stated. Proteins were mixed by gentle vortexing and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 15 min before chromatography to remove unincorporated subunits from the complexes. τ and γ complexes were isolated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) fast protein liquid chromatography column. The column was developed in buffer N (20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 50 mM NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl2) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the point of injection. Under these conditions τ complex eluted between fractions 25 and 28, and γ complex between fractions 27 and 30. Unincorporated δ, δ′, and χψ eluted between fractions 33 and 39. The τ and γ complexes were also isolated by anion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q (Pharmacia) fast protein liquid chromatography column. The column was developed using a 15-ml linear gradient from 50 to 400 mM NaCl in buffer N at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected from the point of injection. All subunits and complexes eluted at unique conductivites in the following order: χψ (80 mM NaCl equivalent), δ′ (170 mM NaCl equivalent), δ (240 mM NaCl equivalent), δδ′ complex (270 mM NaCl equivalent), τ and γ subunits (260 mM NaCl equivalent), and τ and γ complexes (280 mM NaCl equivalent). DnaX complexes prepared by the methods described above were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% acrylamide gels, 0.75-mm thickness). Four samples (2.5, 5, 10, and 15 μg) of each purified complex plus eight standards were analyzed. The standards were made up of DnaX complex constituent subunits mixed according to the DnaX:δ :δ′:χ :ψ ratios of 2:1:1:1:1 and 4:1:1:1:1 (2.5, 5, 10, and 15 μg of each, as determined by extinction coefficient). The gels were stained for at least 12 h in 0.05% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad), 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid to ensure complete staining of the proteins. Gels were destained in three changes of 20% methanol, 5% acetic acid, and scanned using a Molecular Dynamics laser densitometer. The subunits in the purified DnaX complexes were quantitated by linear least squares fitting to standard curves derived from plots of the subunit standards. Assays of the τ and γ complexes described above contained 4 pmol of core (unless otherwise stated), 400 fmol of β, 540 pmol of primed (DnaG primase), and SSB-coated M13Gori (as nucleotide). Reactions were carried out in a volume of 25 μl in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 M potassium glutamate, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20, 10 μM ATP, 48 μM dATP, dCTP and dGTP and 18 μM [3H]TTP (specific activity = 520 cpm/pmol TTP). Assay mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 5 min, and quenched by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The unit definition for τ and γ complex activity is 1 pmol of total nucleotide incorporated into acid-insoluble DNA in a 5-min reaction at 30°C. Protein-protein interaction studies were performed using a Pharmacia Biosensor BIAcoreTM instrument. CM5 research grade sensor chips (Pharmacia Biosensor) were used for all experiments. Protein immobilizations to the sensor chip flow cells were done in buffer HBS (10 mM HEPES KOH, 150 mM NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, 0.005% P-20 detergent (Pharmacia Biosensor)) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min (20°C). The carboxylmethyl dextran matrix of the sensor chip was activated using a 30-μl (6 min) injection of a mixture of 0.2 M 1-ethyl-3-[(3-dimethylamino)propyl]-carbodiimide and 0.05 MN-hydroxysuccinimide in water. This mixture reacts with caboxyl groups of the sensor chip matrix to yield an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, which is susceptible to nucleophilic attack by amino groups of proteins and results in an amide linkage of the protein to the sensor chip. The τ, γ, δ, and δ′ subunits were immobilized to activated sensor chips in buffers and at concentrations optimized for each subunit. Immobilization conditions are as follows; τ, 50 μg/ml, 5-μl injection, 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4); γ, 50 μg/ml, 10-μl injection, 20 mM Mes, pH 6.0; δ, 300 μg/ml, 7-μl injection, 20 mM Mes, pH 6.0; and δ′, 100 μg/ml, 30-μl injection, 20 mM Mes, pH 6.0. Unreacted N-hydroxysuccinimide ester groups were quenched by a 30-μl injection of 1 M ethanolamine HCl, pH 8.0. Protein-protein interaction studies were carried out in buffer HKGM (50 mM HEPES KOH (pH 7.4) 100 mM potassium glutamate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 0.005% P-20 detergent (Pharmacia Biosensor)) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min at 20°C unless otherwise stated. Since the binding signals obtained using the BIAcoreTM are directly proportional to mass bound, stoichiometries could be estimated using : Stoichiometry=(RUanalyte/RUligand)*(Mligand/Manalyte)(Eq. 2) where RU is the measured response (units) obtained at binding saturation and M is the molecular weight. The availability of large amounts of purified τ and γ allowed us to perform hydrodynamic studies using analytical ultracentrifugation. The stoichiometries of the τ and γ subunits relative to other subunits in holoenzyme subcomplexes have previously been estimated by densitometry of stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Maki and Kornberg, 1988; McHenry, 1982) and by gel filtration and glycerol gradient centrifugation (Tsuchihashi and Kornberg, 1989; Studwell-Vaughan and O'Donnell, 1991). These methods suffer inherent problems, such as differences in dye binding affinity between subunits when defined standards are unavailable and significant dependence on molecular shape, which often yield misleading results. By contrast, sedimentation equilibrium analysis in the analytical ultracentrifuge does not involve these problems and provides the most reliable estimate of native molecular weight (Hansen et al., 1994; Minton, 1990; Schachman, 1989). In combination with sedimentation velocity studies, a more accurate description of the hydrodynamic properties of a protein can be obtained. Sedimentation equilibrium and velocity experiments were performed on the τ and γ subunits. Native molecular weights were determined from equilibrium data by nonlinear curve fitting to in the IDEAL1 fitting routine. Sedimentation and diffusion coefficients (s20,w and D20,w) were calculated using the methods of Muramatsu and Minton(1988) and Stafford(1992) which were also provided with the data analysis software. The results are summarized in Table 1 and representative data, curve fits, and residual plots are shown in Fig. 1, A and B. At the concentrations used in this analysis, both τ and γ sediment as single, ideally behaved particles with molecular weights equivalent to tetramers. The sedimentation coefficients, s20w, for the τ and γ subunits were found to be 8.1 and 7.3, respectively. The frictional ratios for both τ and γ were 1.6 and the Stokes radii were 66 and 47 Å, respectively (Table 1).TABLE I Open table in a new tab τ and γ complexes (DnaX complexes) were prepared by mixing and incubation of their constituent subunits and purified by either gel filtration or Mono Q anion exchange chromatography. In all cases a 2-fold molar excess of δ, δ′, and χψ over the DnaX subunit was used to ensure that all of the DnaX protein entered a complex. Both purification methods allowed base-line separation of the resulting DnaX complex from unincorporated δ, δ′, and χψ. However, gel filtration chromatography could not separate the DnaX complexes from unincorporated DnaX subunits. Anion exchange chromatography was used to separate DnaX subunits from their resulting complexes and to assess the degree of incorporation of τ and γ into complexes under the conditions used. The complete inclusion of both DnaX proteins into their complexes when prepared by Mono Q anion exchange demonstrated that significant amounts of free DnaX protein did not contaminate DnaX complexes prepared by gel filtration (data not shown). Both preparation methods yielded complexes with comparable specific activities (Table 2). Furthermore, assay of these complexes for DNA synthesis with additional amounts of δ, δ′, and χψ revealed no stimulation of their activities (Fig. 2), indicating that the complexes were replete in these subunits.TABLE II Open table in a new tab Preliminary studies on the reconstitution of DnaX complexes indicated no preferential order of addition of subunits and no requirement for prolonged stepwise preincubations or for ATP or Mg2+ in obtaining maximal activity yields. The DnaX complexes could be quantitatively assembled at various concentrations in buffer N at room temperature for 15 min before purification (Fig. 3). Stoichiometries of the τ and γ complexes prepared by both gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography were determined by laser densitometry of the complexes and known amounts of standard proteins (determined using their extinction coefficients) subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. To ensure complete staining of all subunits, thin gels (0.75 mm) were run and subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue for at least 12 h to allow complete diffusion of the dye into the gels. Gel destaining was monitored, and gels were scanned immediately after destaining was complete. Stoichiometries of the τ and γ complexes were identical regardless of the purification method and were τ4δ1δ′1χ1ψ1 and γ4δ1δ′1χ1ψ1 (Table 2). The stoichiometries of the DnaX complexes were consistent with the subunit stoichiometries determined for the DnaX subunits by analytical ultracentrifugation, but inconsistent with previously reported stoichiometries, which assumed two copies of the DnaX component in the DnaX complexes (Maki and Kornberg, 1988; Onrust and O'Donnell, 1993). The reconstitutions of the τ and γ complexes described above were carried out at fairly high protein concentrations (2.5 μM DnaX tetramer equivalent), raising the possibility that the observed stoichiometry reflected the use of nonphysiological protein concentrations far exceeding the DnaX dimer-tetramer equilibrium dissociation constant. To rule out this possibility, τ complexes were reconstituted and prepared by ion-exchange chromatography at concentrations approaching the estimated intracellular holoenzyme subunit concentration (∼30 nM assuming 20 copies of holoenzyme/cell) ( (2)Concentration calculated based on a cell volume of ∼1 fl/cell during balanced growth (Ingraham et al., 1983). One molecule/cell would have a concentration of 1.4 nM.) (McHenry and Kornberg, 1981) to determine whether the stoichiometry of τ decreased in these complexes. Visual inspection of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel of samples of τ complex prepared at 1.25 μM, 180 nM, and 50 nM τ complex equivalents, along with a standard of τ complex prepared by gel filtration (Fig. 3), indicated no obvious changes in the stoichiometry of the τ complexes. Laser densitometry of each of these samples and comparison to defined standards indicated that stoichiometry of all τ complexes was the same as the values reported in Table 2, with four to five copies of τ for each of δδ′, χ, and ψ. A Pharmacia Biotech BIAcoreTM instrument (Malmqvist and Granzo, 1994; Malmqvist, 1993; Fagerstam et al., 1992) was used to investigate whether the inclusion of τ in various complexes precluded the binding of other subunits to τ. The BIAcoreTM instrument uses the optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance to monitor biospecific interactions in real time. A ligand protein is chemically linked to a sensor chip made up of a sandwich of gold film between glass and a carboxylmethyl dextran matrix to which the ligand is immobilized. The sensor chip is mounted on a fluidics cartridge which forms flow cells through which analyte proteins can be injected. Ligand-analyte interactions on the sensor chip are detected as changes in the angle of a beam of polarized light reflected from the chip surface. The binding of any mass to the chip alters surface plasmon resonance in the gold layer. This is essentially a change in the electrical field in the gold layer which interacts with the reflected light beam and alters the angle of reflection proportional to the amount of mass bound. The reflected light is detected on a diode array and translated to a binding signal expressed as response units (RU). Because the response is directly proportional to the mass bound, it is possible to measure kinetic and equilibrium constants, and binding stoichiometries for protein-protein interactions. If the role of τ in holoenzyme includes loading β clamps (in concert with the δ, δ′, and χψ subunits) and dimerizing core, a single τ assembly must be able to bind both the core polymerase and DnaX complex subunits. The τ complex activity assays described in Dallmann et al.(1995) strongly implied that core and χψ bind the same τ assembly, and we have shown that the Kd for the τ -χψ interaction is ∼ 2 nM (Olson et al. 1995) and the τ -core interaction is <1 nM. ( (3)D.-R. Kim and C. McHenry, manuscript in preparation.) We used BIAcoreTM analysis to directly determine whether immobilized τ simultaneously binds both core and the χψ complex. τ was immobilized and core and χψ were injected sequentially over the immobilized τ (Fig. 4). In the first phase of the injection in sensorgram 1 (χψ injection), it was clear that the immobilized τ was completely saturated with χψ (as shown by the plateau in the injection phase indicating no further binding), yet in the next phase (core injection), it was also clear that a large amount of core bound to the τ -χψ complex. Sensorgram 2 shows the sequential injection of core followed by χψ. Again τ was saturated with core as indicated by the plateau in the binding signal. In this sensorgram, the χψ binding signal was partially obscured due to its relatively small magnitude and the simultaneous dissociation of core. Subtraction of sensorgram 1 from sensorgram 2, aligned such that the background of core dissociation could be eliminated, was done to obtain a representation of the χψ binding signal. This yielded a χψ binding curve (indicated by the thick line) identical to that seen in sensorgram 1. In both sensorgrams, the τ :χψ binding ratio was estimated from the plateau of the binding phase using and was found to be approximately 4:1, consistent with a τ tetramer binding a χψ heterodimer. The τ :core binding ratio was similarly estimated to be 2:1, consistent with a τ tetramer dimerizing two copies of core. These results indicate that τ binds core and χψ simultaneously at nearly the expected stoichiometries determined above and in Olson et al.(1995). τ and γ complexes were reconstituted on the BIAcoreTM via δ or δ′ immobilized to the sensor chips (Fig. 5) (Olson et al., 1995). Both complexes had dissociation half-lives of 1.4 h and were stable over the time course of all experiments (typically 30 min). The calculated relative binding stoichiometries for both complexes were inconsistent with either the DnaX4δ1δ′1χ1ψ1 or DnaX2δ1δ′1χ1ψ1 stoichiometries, suggesting that a significant proportion of the immobilized δ or δ′ did not participate in τ or γ complex formation on the BIAcoreTM chip. This was likely due to a preferential orientation of a subpopulation of these proteins on the sensor chip during coupling that did not favor complex formation. However, the amount of DnaX complex that was ultimately formed appeared to be capable of binding stoichiometric quantities of other components as described below. The DnaX complexes were tested for their ability to bind core, β, and the τ subunit (Fig. 5). The τ complex bound core rapidly to form a stable complex with a dissociation half-life of 1.5 h and an apparent binding stoichiometry consistent with 2 core moieties bound to a τ4δ1δ′1χ1ψ1 complex. The γ complex did not bind core (Fig. 5). The signal observed for the injection of core over the γ complex was equal to the signal seen when the core sample was injected over a blank sensor chip, indicating no specific binding. Additionally, core did not bind to immobilized δ or δ′. Clearly, the participation of τ in a complex with the δ, δ′, χ, and ψ subunits did not prevent the binding and dimerization of core by τ. The DnaX complexes act to load the β subunit onto primed DNA. To determine whether the τ and γ complexes bind β, the β subunit was injected over the τ and γ complexes assembled on the BIAcoreTM. As expected, β rapidly bound to both complexes (∼400 RU) and dissociated fairly rapidly (as indicated by a more pronounced exponential decay of the signal seen after the end of the β injection) (Fig. 5). The apparent binding stoichiometry was calculated to be 1 β monomer per DnaX4δ1δ′1χ1ψ1 complex, although this represents a minimal estimate since the β concentration was not varied to ensure that it was saturating. To test the postulate that the τ subunit functions to recruit the γ complex into holoenzyme (O'Donnell, 1994; Stukenberg et al. 1994), we analyzed whether the τ subunit could bind to either τ or γ complexes assembled on the BIAcoreTM (Fig. 5). Under the conditions used, no binding of either τ or γ complex to immobilized τ subunit was detected. Additional experiments showed no binding of τ to γ immobilized on the BIAcoreTM, or γ to τ immobilized on the BIAcoreTM (data not shown). Because τ complex could bind all components of a τ -reconstituted holoenzyme, we attempted to reconstitute a τ -dependent “initiation complex” on a BIAcoreTM sensor chip via immobilized δ. As shown in Fig. 6, the β subunit and primed, SSB-coated, M13Gori bound strongly to the τ complex-core assembly (dissociation half-life, 1.5 h). We do not know whether binding of the primed M13 template requires the presence of the RNA primer. This experiment showed that all the components of an initiation complex can participate in a large multiprotein-DNA assembly which is dependent on the presence of the τ subunit. We have used sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation to determine the native molecular weights of τ and γ (Fig. 1, Table 1). Both proteins sedimented as ideally behaved particles at molecular weights consistent with a tetrameric quaternary structure. Numerous previous studies implied stoichiometries from dimer to trimer for DnaX (Tsuchihashi and Kornberg, 1989; Studwell-Vaughan and O'Donnell, 1991; O'Donnell, 1994). These studies were conducted using gel filtration and glycerol gradient centrifugation which are affected by molecular properties other than molecular weight (such as particle shape and frictional ratio), whereas sedimentation equilibrium is dependent only on the weight of the sedimenting particle and not on molecular shape factors (van Holde, 1971). Thus, our determination of the native molecular weights of τ and γ must be considered the most reliable estimate to date. Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation of τ and γ was also performed (Table 1). For τ, the sedimentation coefficient, Stokes radius and frictional ratio determined here were comparable to those determined by Studwell-Vaughan and O'Donnell(1991). The frictional ratios for both τ and γ indicate that they are asymmetric. The purified τ and γ subunits were used to reconstitute DnaX complexes along with the δ and δ′ subunits and the χψ complex. These complexes were readily assembled with no requirement for stepwise preincubation of subunits or requirement for ATP or Mg2+ before purification. Previous reports (Blinkova et al., 1993; Stukenberg et al., 1994) have indicated that a stepwise preincubation of subunits is required for the reconstitution of τ complex and holoenzyme before purification. We attribute this requirement to the use of ψ that had been purified in 6 M urea from inclusion bodies (Xiao et al., 1993). Presumably this procedure reflects the time required for the refolding of ψ and its recruitment into a reconstituted holoenzyme. The ψ used in our study was co-expressed with the χ subunit as a soluble complex which has been shown to readily interact with the DnaX proteins and is required for cooperative assembly of δ and δ′ into DnaX complexes (Olson et al., 1995). The τ and γ complexes were purified by either gel filtration or anion exchange chromatography. Both methods yielded complexes that were indistinguishable by activity and subunit stoichiometry (Table 2). Stoichiometries of the τ and γ complexes were found to be τ4δ1δ′1χ1ψ1 and γ4δ1δ′1χ1ψ1, respectively, inconsistent with a previous report of γ complex stoichiometry (γ2δ1δ′1χ1ψ1) (Maki and Kornberg, 1988), which was estimated by densitometry of stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels using relative staining intensity for quantitation. We believe that the stoichiometries determined here are reliable and can be used to infer the stoichiometry of DnaX complexes in vivo for a number of reasons. (i) Defined amounts of each subunit (determined from subunit extinction coefficients) were used as standards in the quantitation, not relative staining intensity. (ii) Reconstitutions of τ complex at low protein concentrations (down to 50 nM τ complex) approaching the estimated intracellular holoenzyme subunit concentration (∼30 nM2 assuming 20 copies of holoenzyme/cell) (McHenry and Kornberg, 1981) produced complexes with stoichiometries identical to complexes prepared at high concentrations (Fig. 3). (iii) Addition of δ, δ′, and χψ to τ and γ complex assays (Fig. 2) caused no stimulation, indicating that the complexes were replete in these subunits. This last point implies that the dissociation constant for the DnaX dimer-tetramer equilibrium is no higher than 4 nM, the concentration of DnaX complex used in a typical assay and below the estimated intracellular concentration. If the τ4δ1δ′1χ1ψ1 or γ4δ1δ′1χ1ψ1 stoichiometry were an artifact due to high protein concentration favoring DnaX tetramer formation, the observed stoichiometry might have been caused by the use of protein concentrations far exceeding the dimer-tetramer dissociation constant. In that case, addition of δ, δ′, and χψ to τ and γ complex assays (Fig. 2) should have caused a stimulation of DnaX complex activity at the high dilutions used in the assay as the DnaX tetramer reequilibrated to the dimer form. This was not observed. The participation of the τ and γ subunits in higher order multiprotein complexes with other holoenzyme subunits and subcomplexes was qualitatively examined using the Pharmacia Biosensor BIAcoreTM instrument (Malmqvist and Granzow, 1994). Optimally, the BIAcoreTM can be used to determine kinetic and equilibrium constants for simple A + B → AB associating systems (Fagerstam et al., 1992). For the interactions studied in this report, where binding cooperativity (Olson et al., 1995) and the assembly and dissociation of multisubunit complexes are involved, kinetic and equilibrium constants could not be determined without more extensive experimentation and mathematical modeling. The qualitative results presented here can be considered analogous to protein-protein cross-linking. We have shown that the τ subunit, when immobilized to the BIAcoreTM, can simultaneously interact with core and the χψ complex (Fig. 4), as expected based on the ability of τ complex to reconstitute holoenzyme with stoichiometric amounts of core and β (Dallmann et al., 1995). We are confident that the final complexes assembled in this experiment represent a core-τ -χψ complex and not a mixed population of τ -χψ and τ -core complexes since the intermediate τ -χψ and τ -core complexes were formed to completion, leaving no free τ subunit present during the next injection phase. The core-τ -χψ complex also appeared to assemble at the expected 2:4:1 core:τ :χψ ratio. The τ and γ complexes were reconstituted on BIAcoreTM via δ or δ′ coupled to the sensor chip (Olson et al., 1995). Not surprisingly, both τ and γ complexes bound β (Fig. 5). The τ complex readily bound a stoichiometric amount of core to form a complex with a dissociation half-life of 1.5 h; the γ complex did not (Fig. 5), consistent with previous results (Dallmann et al., 1995) showing that the γ complex requires a large excess of core for activity. These results can be interpreted as a mass action effect. The activity of γ complex increases with increasing core since the interaction of core with β (required for high processivity) (Fay et al., 1982) on the primed DNA will be diffusion-limited in the absence of any core-γ complex interaction. With τ complex, core-β interaction can be established rapidly since the polymerase, β-clamp loader and β are all associated in one large complex (Figure 5:, Figure 6:), effectively increasing the local concentration of core relative to β. We do not detect any interaction between the γ complex and the τ subunit on the BIAcoreTM (Fig. 5). The small effect of the τ subunit on γ complex activity assays (Dallmann et al., 1995) also supports our present observation. All the components of a γ -less initiation complex can be assembled on the BIAcoreTM via the δ subunit as a large, stable multiprotein-DNA complex dependent on the presence of the τ subunit (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the apparent binding stoichiometry of core was consistent with the presence of tetrameric DnaX complexes, as expected based on the DnaX subunit stoichiometry determined by analytical ultracentrifugation and DnaX complex stoichiometry determined by quantitative gel scanning. The results presented in this report and elsewhere (Olson et al., 1995; Dallmann et al., 1995; Blinkova et al. 1993) indicate γ is a dispensible subunit, both in vitro and in vivo. Asymmetry in the function of holoenzyme can be conferred by the τ subunit alone (Dallmann et al., 1995) without apparent requirement for the γ subunit/complex. In Fig. 7, we present a model for a γ -less DNA polymerase III holoenzyme that possesses all of the properties of native holoenzyme. When γ is present in this complex, it must replace two τ s at a position away from the two τ s that dimerize pol III core. This model is also consistent with the results of Blinkova et al.(1993), who reconstituted and purified a functional γ -less holoenzyme from the α, ε, θ, τ, δ, δ′, χ, and ψ subunits, and additionally found that expression of τ, but not γ, was essential for cell viability. We have also observed that holoenzyme reconstituted from all 10 subunits fractionates upon gel filtration into a 9-subunit holoenzyme, lacking γ (data not shown), indicating that the mechanism of γ entry is complex. The model shown in Fig. 7 remains an asymmetric complex, considering that the interaction of the single copy δ, δ′, χ, and ψ subunits with the tetrameric τ subunit is an inherently asymmetric arrangement. An analogous situation can be observed in the recently determined crystal structure of bovine heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase (Abrahams et al. 1994) where the interaction of the single copy γ, δ, and ε subunits impose asymmetry in the tertiary structures in each copy of the 3 α and 3 β subunits. The asymmetric placement of δ, δ′, χ, and ψ on the tetrameric τ subunit could then confer the asymmetric properties of the leading and lagging strand polymerase halves of holoenzyme. While this manuscript was under review, a paper by O'Donnell and colleagues (Onrust et al., 1995a) concluded that γ and τ exist principally as dimers and that the stoichiometry of the γ and τ complexes are γ2δ1δ′1χ1ψ1 and τ2δ1δ′1χ1ψ1, respectively. Our data consistently indicate a tetrameric assembly for both γ and τ, based on the molecular weight determinations for γ and τ obtained by the more rigorous method of sedimentation equilibrium. Note that no discrepancy exists when the stoichiometry assigned by O'Donnell and colleagues for the γ complex (their Table 2) is divided by the yield obtained in the HPLC experiment used to separate them (HPLC section of their “Experimental Procedures”). In the same series of reports (Onrust et al., 1995b), O'Donnell and co-workers described a method for reconstituting γ into holoenzyme that depends on the presence of limiting amounts of τ and a molar excess of γ in the reconstitution mix. Furthermore, the presence of δ -δ′ during the early stages of reconstitution blocked the entry of γ into holoenzyme. Those results are also consistent with a tetrameric DnaX assembly within holoenzyme. Our observations that DnaX assemblies are tetrameric and that δ -δ′ bind to (and presumably stabilize) this tetrameric complex provide additional insight into holoenzyme assembly. With τ present in limiting concentrations and γ present in excess, the formation of a mixed γ -τ complex ( (4)Even if energetically unfavorable, such an arrangement would occur if the τ -α interaction is stronger than the energy lost in converting a τ2τ2 interaction into an γ2τ2 interaction.) is the only way to accommodate the maximal quantity of energetically favorable α-τ contacts (KD<1 nM3) while preserving a tetrameric DnaX arrangement. If δ -δ′ binding to γ stabilizes a tetrameric assembly, it may not be able to dissociate to γ2, a requisite for assembly with α2τ2. It seems unlikely to us that a lengthy stepwise incubation in the absence of δ -δ′ represents a biologically relevant pathway for holoenzyme assembly. Given our finding that τ4 is the favored assembly state and that pol III can bind τ and form pol III′ containing a τ dimer (McHenry, 1982; Studwell-Vaughan and O'Donnell, 1991), formation of this complex may provide an assembly intermediate for the entry of γ into holoenzyme. In any case, γ appears to be dispensable, since all of the known functional properties of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, including functional and structural asymmetry can be reconstituted in γ -less holoenzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1601866365,"We used a novel approach to study the role of the Asn-linked oligosaccharides for human thyrotropin (hTSH) activity. Mutagenesis of Asn(N) within individual glycosylation recognition sequences to Gln (Q) was combined with expression of wild type and mutant hTSH in cell lines with different glycosylation patterns. The in vitro activity of hTSH lacking the Asnα52 oligosaccharide (αQ52/TSHβ) expressed in CHO-K1 cells (sialylated oligosaccharides) was increased 6-fold compared with wild type, whereas the activities of αQ78/TSHβ and α/TSHβQ23 were increased 2-3-fold. Deletion of the Asnα52 oligosaccharide also increased the thyrotropic activity of human chorionic gonadotropin, in contrast to previous findings at its native receptor. The in vitro activity of wild type hTSH expressed in CHO-LEC2 cells (sialic acid-deficient oligosaccharides), CHO-LEC1 cells (Man5GlcNAc2 intermediates), and 293 cells (sulfated oligosaccharides) was 5-8-fold higher than of wild type from CHO-K1 cells. In contrast to CHO-K1 cells, there was no difference in the activity between wild type and selectively deglycosylated mutants expressed in these cell lines. Thus, in hTSH, the oligosaccharide at Asnα52 and, specifically, its terminal sialic acid residues attenuate in vitro activity, in contrast to the previously reported stimulatory role of this chain for human chorionic gonadotropin and human follitropin activity. The increased thyrotropic activity of αQ52/CGβ suggests that receptor-related mechanisms may be responsible for these differences among the glycoprotein hormones.

These hormones are structurally related heterodimers consisting of a common α subunit and a distinct β subunit that confers the biological specificity for each hormone (1Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1846) Google Scholar).

After subcloning the wild type and mutant α constructs into pAXNeoRx, the resulting constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutagenesis of the hTSHβ minigene (24Joshi L. Murata Y.

BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a primer encompassing the desired mutation (AAC to CAA, TSHβ Asn23 to Gln) was used to amplify a 196-base pair 5′ fragment of the gene, and this fragment (the megaprimer) was used in a second polymerase chain reaction together with a 3′ primer to amplify the entire gene. After subcloning into the pLBCMV expression vector(24Joshi L. Murata Y. Wondisford F.E. Szkudlinski M.W. Desai R. Weintraub B.D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3839-3848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the entire polymerase chain reaction product was sequenced to verify the mutation and to rule out any undesired polymerase errors. CHO-K1 cells were maintained as described(22Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Zeng H. Kraiem Z. Ji I. Tropea J.E. Ji H.T. Weintraub B.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 948-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CHO-LEC cell lines 2 and 1 were grown in α-modified minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml) and glutamine (4 mM). 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented as above. Cells were transiently cotransfected in 60-mm culture dishes with wild type or mutant pAXNeoRx/α, wild type or mutant pLBCMV/TSHβ minigene, or pcDNAI/neo/hCGβ using a liposome formulation (Lipofectamine reagent, Life Technologies, Inc.) in a protocol modified according to the manufacturer's instructions(22Grossmann M.

After culture in CHO-serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 48 h, supernatants, including control medium from mock transfections using the expression plasmids without gene inserts, were harvested, concentrated with Centriprep 10 concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and stored at -70°C to prevent neuraminidase digestion. Wild type and mutant hTSHs were quantified using four different hTSH immunoassays. Two third-generation assays utilizing different monoclonal antibodies (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA, and ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) were used, following the manufacturers' instructions. Further, wild type and mutant hTSHs were measured with two different polyclonal antibodies by radioimmunoassay using polyclonal antibodies NIADDK-anti-hTSH-3 and NIDDK-anti-hβTSH-IC-2 (22Grossmann M.

Intracellular immunoreactivity in the cell lysates was determined after four freeze-thaw cycles on a methanol/dry ice mix and in a 37°C water bath, respectively. Wild type and mutant hCG was measured with a specific third-generation immunoassay without cross-reactivity to other glycoprotein hormones (Nichols Institute). Conditioned media were chromatographed on a Superdex 75-HPLC column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and eluted at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), using hCG as internal standard. hTSH and hCG immunoreactivities were monitored by immunoassay (Nichols Institute). Conditioned media were concentrated, fractionated on ConA-Sepharose (Pharmacia), reconcentrated, and denatured by boiling in 0.25% SDS, 0.5%β-mercaptoethanol. After digestion with N-glycanase, samples were resolved on 14% Tris/glycine polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated overnight with a rabbit antibody directed against the hTSH α subunit. Antigen-antibody complexes were subsequently visualized by chemiluminescence using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG and a luminol substrate (Boehringer Mannheim). Concentrated conditioned media were incubated with 250 microunits of neuraminidase/10 mg of total protein in 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, for 12 h at room temperature, followed by 1 h at 37°C. After separation of the agarose-beaded neuraminidase by spinning in a microcentrifuge, media were washed, concentrated, and reassayed for hTSH immunoreactivity. Similarly, N-glycanase digestion was performed for 20 h at 37°C with 12.5 units/10 mg of protein in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.6. Confluent CHO cells stably expressing the rhTSH receptor (JP09) (26Costagliola S. Swillens S. Niccoli P. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. Ludgate M. Endocrinology. 1992; 75: 1540-1544Google Scholar) and FRTL-5 cells expressing the endogenous rat TSH receptor (27Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Parks L.A.M. Coon H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3455-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar) were incubated in 96-well tissue culture plates for 2 h at 37°C, 5% CO2 with serial dilutions of wild type and mutant hTSH or hCG as well as control medium from mock transfections. The amount of cAMP released into the medium was assayed by radioimmunoassay(22Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Zeng H. Kraiem Z. Ji I. Tropea J.E. Ji H.T. Weintraub B.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 948-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown with wild type hTSH, αQ52/TSHβ, or concentrated mock medium for 48 h. 24 h after adding 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine/well (DuPont, Wilmington, DE), cells were washed and solubilized, and [3H]thymidine uptake was determined as described(16Szkudlinski M.W. Thotakura N.R. Bucci I. Joshi L.R. Tsai A. East-Palmer J. Shiloach J. Weintraub B.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1490-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The receptor-binding activity of wild type and hTSH mutants was determined by their ability to displace 125I-bTSH from a solubilized porcine thyroid membrane receptor preparation (Kronus, Dana Point, CA) as described previously(11Thotakura N.R. Desai R.K. Szkudlinski M.W. Weintraub B.D. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The in vivo bioactivity of various mutants was determined using a bioassay recently developed and characterized in our laboratory(28East-Palmer J. Szkudlinski M.W. Lee J. Thotakura N.R. Weintraub B.D. Thyroid. 1995; 5: 55-59Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, male albino swiss Crl:CF-1 mice were given 3 μg/ml of T3 (Sigma) in their drinking water for five to six days to suppress endogenous TSH secretion. Wild type and mutant hTSH as well as mock-concentrated medium at equal volumes was injected intraperitoneally, and blood samples for determination of T4 (T4 Kit, Nichols Institute) and hTSH values were obtained from the orbital sinus 6 h later. The serum disappearance rate of wild type hTSH and selected mutants was determined in the rat by injecting 200-300 ng of the recombinant hormones intravenously and then measuring serum hTSH concentrations from 1-120 min. Experimental details of this procedure are given elsewhere(16Szkudlinski M.W. Thotakura N.R. Bucci I. Joshi L.R. Tsai A. East-Palmer J. Shiloach J. Weintraub B.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1490-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). hTSH bears three N-linked oligosaccharide chains at positions Asn52 and Asn78 of the α subunit and at Asn23 of the β subunit(1Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1846) Google Scholar, 2Green E.D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 25-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Thotakura N.R. Blithe D.L. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To prevent the cotranslational attachment of individual oligosaccharides to the hTSH molecule, we disrupted the respective glycosylation recognition sequences NX(T/S), widely considered to be an absolute requirement for glycosylation to occur. In the α subunit (individually and in a composite mutation) and in the TSHβ subunit we mutated Asn at each position to Gln, thus creating genes coding for the following mutant subunits: αQ52, αQ78, αQ52.Q78, and TSHβQ23. The conservative mutation of Asn to Gln is unlikely to affect protein conformation and has not been reported to influence the tertiary structure of the related glycoproteins hCG and hFSH, when used to generate mutants lacking individual oligosaccharide attachment sites(7Matzuk M.M. Keene J.L. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 264: 2409-2414Google Scholar, 8Bishop L.A. Robertson D.M. Cahir N. Schofield P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 722-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9Flack M.R. Froehlich J. Bennet A.P. Anasti J. Nisula B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14015-14020PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the observed effects on the hTSH expression, binding, and activity should be primarily due to changes in the carbohydrate chains. The shift in the elution profiles of the hTSH mutants observed using gel filtration (Fig. 1A) and the differences in gel migration using Western blotting (Fig. 1B) were consistent with the absence of individual oligosaccharides. After N-glycanase digestion, wild type hTSH, αQ52/TSHβ, and αQ78/TSHβ had similar profiles (Fig. 1, A and B), further demonstrating that the differences prior to N-glycanase treatment were due to differences in glycosylation. To rule out any potential changes in the specific epitope recognized by an antibody and to avoid inaccurate quantitation of the hTSH mutants, we used four different immunoassays to quantitate wild type and mutant hTSH from the different cell lines (see “Experimental Procedures”). Comparable results were obtained for the selectively deglycosylated hTSH mutants in all four immunoassays. In addition, the slopes of the displacement curves of wild type hTSH were parallel to those for the hTSH mutants using the Nichols immunoassay (data not shown). By cotransfecting wild type and mutant human α and TSHβ subunits in various combinations into CHO-K1 cells, we generated the following recombinant proteins: αQ52/TSHβ, αQ78/TSHβ, αQ52.Q78/TSHβ, α/TSHβQ23, αQ52/TSHβQ23, and αQ78/TSHβQ23. Elimination of the carbohydrate at a single site reduced expression 2.5-10-fold compared with wild type, and deletion of more than one site decreased levels even further (Table 1). The concomitant decreases of intracellular and secreted immunoreactivity suggest that these reductions were not due to intracellular retention of the hTSH mutants. In fact, >90% of total hTSH immunoreactivity was detected in the medium in all cases, indicating efficient secretion of the mutants. This is in accord with the proposed role of the oligosaccharide chains in early cotranslational events in promoting proper folding and maintaining the intracellular stability of TSH(4Magner J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 345-385Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 29Lash R.W. Desai R.K. Zimmermann C.A. Flack M.R. Yoshida T. Wondisford F.E. Weintraub B.D. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1992; 15: 225-233Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we could not detect any significant production of completely deglycosylated hTSH (αQ52.Q78/TSHβQ23). This is in agreement with previous findings on hFSH (8Bishop L.A. Robertson D.M. Cahir N. Schofield P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 722-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and emphasizes the essential role of carbohydrates in the biosynthesis of the glycoprotein hormones. Similar reductions of the mutants tested were also observed in 293, CHO-LEC2, and CHO-LEC1 cells (data not shown), indicating that these reductions were independent of differences in the overall carbohydrate pattern. Next, we assessed the ability of wild type and mutant hTSH expressed in CHO-K1 cells that produce highly sialylated carbohydrate chains (15Smith P.L. Kaetzel D. Nilson J. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 874-881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Szkudlinski M.W. Thotakura N.R. Bucci I. Joshi L.R. Tsai A. East-Palmer J. Shiloach J. Weintraub B.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1490-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) to stimulate cAMP production in CHO cells stably transfected with the rhTSH receptor, JP09(26Costagliola S. Swillens S. Niccoli P. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. Ludgate M. Endocrinology. 1992; 75: 1540-1544Google Scholar). Whereas the maximal cAMP stimulatory activity of the mutants was unchanged, there was a highly significant (p < 0.001) 6-fold, 2-fold, and 3-fold lower EC50 of mutants αQ52/TSHβ, αQ78/TSHβ, and α/TSHβQ23 compared with wild type (Fig. 2, Table 2). Further, αQ52/TSHβ was significantly more active than αQ78/TSHβ and α/TSHβQ23 (p < 0.001). Due to the dramatically reduced expression levels, it was not possible to obtain full dose-response levels for mutants lacking more than one carbohydrate chain. However, there was no significant cAMP stimulation of mutant αQ52.Q78/TSHβ at 0.5 ng/ml, whereas wild type hTSH at the same concentration induced cAMP 3-fold over base-line levels, indicating that the presence of at least one oligosaccharide of the α subunit is required to activate the TSH receptor. This is in accord with previous findings on pituitary bovine TSH, which suggested that enzymatic deglycosylation of the α subunit led to a decrease of bioactivity (11Thotakura N.R. Desai R.K. Szkudlinski M.W. Weintraub B.D. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). At 2 ng/ml, αQ52/TSHβQ23 was twice as active as wild type hTSH (p = 0.02, n = 3), whereas there was no difference between wild type hTSH and αQ78/TSHβQ23. In FRTL-5 cells expressing endogenous rat TSH receptor(27Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Parks L.A.M. Coon H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3455-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), we observed, relative to wild type (EC50 = 12.6 ± 2.1 ng/ml), a similar 6-fold decrease in the EC50 of αQ52/TSHβ (EC50 = 2.0 ± 0.7 ng/ml, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3). We next expressed mutants αQ52/TSHβ, αQ78/TSHβ, and α/TSHβQ23 in 293 cells. In contrast to CHO-K1 cells, 293 cells express N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferase and GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2Manα4-sulfotransferase and produce oligosaccharides terminating in >70% in sulfated N-linked carbohydrate moieties(19Smith P.L. Skelton T.P. Fiete D. Dharmesh S.M. Beranek M.C. MacPhail L. Broze Jr., G.J. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19140-19146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since we previously found that 293 cells produce small amounts of free α subunit(29Lash R.W. Desai R.K. Zimmermann C.A. Flack M.R. Yoshida T. Wondisford F.E. Weintraub B.D. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1992; 15: 225-233Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we initially cotransfected the hTSHβ minigene alone to assess whether significant amounts of wild type hTSH would be produced. This, however, was not the case, indicating that significant contamination of the mutants with wild type hTSH did not occur. Wild type hTSH, expressed in 293 cells had increased cAMP inducing activity, evidenced by a 5.6-fold left shift in the EC50 compared with wild type expressed in CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 4, Table 2) (p < 0.001). However, in relation to the increased wild type activity, there was no difference in activity between wild type and the selectively deglycosylated hTSH mutants (Fig. 4, Table 2). To further understand which carbohydrate components may be associated with the increase of bioactivity upon expressing the hTSH mutants in CHO-K1 cells, we also transiently transfected CHO-LEC2 and"

SK(16-414) and SK(16-378) could activate HPlg as efficiently as the authentic SK. SK(60-414), which had been preincubatd with SK(1-59), could also activate HPlg. SK(91-414), SK(127-414), and SK(158-414), at a concentration of one-tenth of HPlg, all failed to activate HPlg. However, the truncated SK peptides in complexes with equimolar HPlg could form amidolytically active virgin enzymes that slowly converted to human plasmin (HPlm) after a lag period of 15 min. SK(16-316) could not activate HPlg. No virgin enzyme was detected when SK(16-316) was incubated with equimolar HPlg, but the HPlg in the complex was modified to HPlm after reaction for 20 min. SK(220-414) and SK(16-251) had no ability to transform HPlg to virgin enzyme or to HPlm in equimolar complex with HPlg, although they could bind to HPlg.

Region a is important in stabilizing the conformation of the SK molecule, and region b is essential for HPlg activation. Region c is required for induction of the conformational changes of HPlg to virgin enzyme. Regions c and d are required for the conversion of HPlg to HPlm in the HPlg•SK equimolar complex. Coordination of regions c, d, and e of SK is essential for a virgin enzyme formation, and coordination of regions b, c, d and e is required for an effective SK-type HPlg activator.

INTRODUCTIONStreptokinase (SK) ( 1The abbreviations used are: SKstreptokinasePlgplasminogenPlmplasminHPlghuman plasminogenHPlmhuman plasminPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reactionHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography.) is a single-peptide secretory protein of 414 (1Malke H. Roe B. Ferretti J.J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 34: 357-362Google Scholar) or 415 (2Jackson K.W. Tang J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6620-6625Google Scholar) amino acid residues produced by various strains of β-hemolytic Streptococcus(1Malke H. Roe B. Ferretti J.J.

The SK and human plasminogen (HPlg) can form an equimolar activator complex that catalyzes the conversion of plasminogens (Plgs) to plasmins (Plms) of different mammalian species(4Ling C.M. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4213-4218Google Scholar, 5Wulf R.J. Mertz E.T. Can. J. Biochem. 1969; 47: 927-931Google Scholar, 6McClintock D.K. Bell P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Plm is a potent protease that in turn catalyzes the hydrolysis of fibrin, which causes the dissolution of blood clots. SK, therefore, is used as a thrombolytic agent clinically to relieve thromboembolic blockages in blood vessels, such as acute myocardial infarction.Studies of the activation of HPlg by SK suggest that more than one intermediate step is involved in the entire process. In the first step, a 1:1 stoichiometric complex of HPlg and SK is formed, and the conformation of the catalytic domain of HPlg is altered to expose its enzyme-active center(6McClintock D.K. Bell P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 43: 694-702Google Scholar, 7Reddy K.N.N. Markus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1683-1691Google Scholar, 9Reddy K.N.N. Markus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4851-4857Google Scholar). The HPlg moiety in the complex has been named virgin enzyme since it has similar catalytic activity to human plasmin (HPlm), but the activating peptide bond of Arg560-Val561 is not cleaved(12Summaria L. Wohl R.C. Boreisha I.G. Robbins K.C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2056-2059Google Scholar). In the second reaction step, the HPlg•SK complex is converted to HPlm•SK, and then in the final reaction step, the HPlm•SK catalyzes the hydrolysis of the specific activating peptide bond of Arg560-Val561 on substrate HPlg, resulting in the formation of HPlm(5Wulf R.J. Mertz E.T. Can. J. Biochem. 1969; 47: 927-931Google Scholar, 8Schick L.A. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4315-4321Google Scholar, 13Gonzalez-Gronow M. Siefring Jr., G.E. Castellino F.J. J.

Chem. 1976; 251: 3913-3920Google Scholar).The exact interaction sites of SK with HPlg and their functions, however, have not been determined. Proteolytic SK fragments obtained in the reactions of SK with human, rabbit, and dog Plg(m)s have been used to study the functions of the SK molecule(15Siefring Jr., G.E. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3913-3920Google Scholar, 16Brockway W.J. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2063-2070Google Scholar, 17Reddy K.N.N. Kline D.L. Thromb. Res. 1976; 9: 407-411Google Scholar, 18Rodriguez P. Fuentes D. Munoz E. Rivero D. Orta D. Alburquerque S. Perez S. Besada V. Herrera L. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8: 276-285Google Scholar). A 36 and a 25.7-kDa fragment obtained in the reaction with HPlm and dog Plg, respectively, can activate HPlg(15Siefring Jr., G.E. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3913-3920Google Scholar, 16Brockway W.J. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2063-2070Google Scholar, 17Reddy K.N.N. Kline D.L. Thromb. Res. 1976; 9: 407-411Google Scholar). A 17-kDa SK fragment consisting of Val143 (Glu148) to Arg289 (Lys293) obtained in the reaction with Sepharose-immobilized HPlg (HPlm) is the smallest SK fragment that can bind to HPlg(18Rodriguez P. Fuentes D. Munoz E. Rivero D. Orta D. Alburquerque S. Perez S. Besada V. Herrera L. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8: 276-285Google Scholar). A SK fragment, SK-o, Ser60-Lys333 (or Ser60-Lys332 according to the numbering used in this paper), is essential for minimal SK activator activity(19Shi G.Y. Chang B.I. Chen S.M. Wu D.H. Wu H.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 235-241Google Scholar). Obviously, the COOH-terminal peptide of SK-p, Ala334-Lys387 (or Ala333-Lys386), is required for strong binding with HPlm. The NH2-terminal 59-amino acid peptide is important in maintaining the proper conformation of SK for full activator activity(19Shi G.Y. Chang B.I. Chen S.M. Wu D.H. Wu H.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 235-241Google Scholar). These studies imply that domain-like structures may exist in the SK molecule that exert various functions in HPlg activation. This study was undertaken to elucidate the functions of various domains of SK and to determine more precisely the interaction sites between SK and HPlg using a series of truncated SK peptides lacking NH2 and/or COOH-terminal amino acid residues.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsEnzymes used in DNA manipulation were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, Life Technologies, Inc., or Promega and were used according to the Cold Spring Harbor Manual or the recommendations of the suppliers. The two oligonucleotides used in SK gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were custom synthesized by Pan Asia Hospital Supply Co. (Taiwan, Republic of China). The oligonucleotide for sense primer was 5′-GGAGGGATCCATGAAAAATTACTTATCT-3′ (nucleotide position 809-836 by the numbering convention for the PstI fragment containing SK) and for antisense primer was 5′-AAGAGGATCCTTATTTGTCGTTAGGGTT-3′ (nucleotide position 2151-2124)(1Malke H. Roe B. Ferretti J.J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 34: 357-362Google Scholar). For cloning convenience, BamHI recognition sequences (underlined) were created by replacing some of the nucleotides. Blue-Sepharose CL 6B, Lys-Sepharose, and DEAE-cellulose were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. NH2-D-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide (S-2251) was obtained from Sigma. SK antibody was prepared in our laboratory from mice. All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available.Proteins and EnzymesHPlg was prepared from pooled human plasma by a modification of the Deutsch and Mertz method(20Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Google Scholar). Forms 1 and 2 of native HPlg were separated by chromatography on Lys-Sepharose column(21Brockway W.J. Castellino F.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 151: 194-199Google Scholar). Form 2 of HPlg was used throughout this study. HPlm was prepared by activating HPlg with Sepharose-bound urokinase as described previously(22Wu H.L. Shi G.Y. Bender M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8292-8295Google Scholar). Native SK (Behringwerke AG, Marburg, Germany) was further purified by passing it through a Blue-Sepharose CL 6B column to remove serum albumin(15Siefring Jr., G.E. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3913-3920Google Scholar).Construction of SK and Truncated SK GenesThe SK gene was amplified by PCR by the standard procedure from Streptococcus equisimilis H46A (ATCC 12449). The 1.3-kilobase DNA fragment was then cloned into the BamHI site of the multicloning region of pGEM-3Z vector (Promega) and propagated in Escherichia coli JM109. Unidirectional deletion of the SK gene was carried out with exonuclease III using the Erase-a-Base system (Promega) to construct truncated SK genes from the NH2 or COOH terminus. Nucleotide sequences of the SK and truncated genes were determined by dideoxy sequencing method(23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar, 24Chen E.Y. Seeburg P.H. DNA (N. Y.). 1985; 4: 165-170Google Scholar).Expression and Purification of Recombinant Truncated SK PeptidesTruncated SK genes were subcloned in-frame into the BamHI site of the overproducing plasmid pET-3 (Novagen), in which the cloned genes were inducibly expressed under the control of T7 promoter in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. Bacterial cells were grown to mid-log phase at 37°C, and target gene expression was induced after shifting the incubation temperature to 33°C and adding 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. 3 h later, cells were harvested, washed, and disintegrated by French press, then the proteins were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The precipitated proteins were dialyzed and loaded onto a DEAE cellulose column. After elution with salt gradient, the active fractions were detected by HPlg activation with S-2251. Because the HPlg activator activities of some short peptides of SK were too low to detect, the fractions containing SK peptides were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Quantitation of the activities of truncated SK peptides in each purification step was conducted in flat bottomed 96-well plates by activating HPlg to hydrolyze S-2251. A serially diluted native SK (93,750 IU/mg) solution was used as standard.Protein ConcentrationProtein concentrations of SK peptides were determined with Folin reagent (Merck) by the Lowry method (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar).Preparation of SK(1-59) by HPLCThe NH2-terminal peptide SK(1-59) was prepared by incubating native SK (5 μM) with immobilized HPlm (10 μM) at 25°C for 90 min and purified by HPLC as described previously(19Shi G.Y. Chang B.I. Chen S.M. Wu D.H. Wu H.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 235-241Google Scholar). The amount of SK(1-59) was determined by amino acid composition analysis.Amino Acid Sequence AnalysisThe amino acid sequence of the truncated SK peptide was determined by Edman degradation in an Applied Biosystems Sequencer (model 477A).SDS-PAGE Analysis and Western BlottingProtein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli(26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The electrophoresed proteins on the gel were transferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore), and Western blotting was carried out (27Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Google Scholar).Steady-state Kinetic Parameters of Activation of HPlg by SK and Truncated SK PeptidesA one-stage assay as described previously was used to measure the kinetics of HPlg activation by SK and truncated SK peptides(28Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2005-2013Google Scholar, 29Shi G.Y. Chang B.I. Wu D.H. Ha Y.M. Wu H.L. Thromb. Res. 1990; 58: 317-329Google Scholar). Briefly, HPlg at final concentrations ranging from 0.04 to 4 μM was incubated with 0.5 mM S-2251 in an assay cuvette containing 150 μl of 0.05 M Tris buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.1 M NaCl. Activation was initiated by adding an SK peptide of fixed concentration, and the change in absorbance at 405 nm was monitored at 37°C in a Hitachi 330 spectrophotometer. The increments of absorbance between 10 and 300 s after addition of SK peptides were used to measure the initial rate of HPlg activation. Initial reaction rates were determined from the slopes of plots of absorbance versus t2, and double-reciprocal plots were then constructed. HPlg activation parameters, Kplg (the apparent Michaelis constant for the HPlg substrate) and kplg (the catalytic rate constant of activation), were calculated as described by Wohl et al.(28Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2005-2013Google Scholar). The ɛ1 m at 405 nm employed for p-nitroanilide was 9559.Discontinuous Assays of Amidolytic Activity for Determination of the Maximal Formation of HPlg•SK-Peptide ComplexesIncubations of equimolar HPlg and truncated SK peptides (final concentration, 2 μM) were carried out at 25°C in 10 mM HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4. Aliquots were removed at various intervals to assay the amidolytic activity. The amidolytic activity was measured by adding aliquots of the HPlg•SK-peptides (final concentration, 0.2 μM) in an assay cuvette containing 0.5 mM S-2251 in 0.05 M Tris buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.1 M NaCl. The absorbance at 405 nm was monitored between 10 and 90 s. The initial reaction rate was calculated, and the duration to achieve maximal amidolytic activity was determined as described by Chibber et al.(30Chibber B.A.K. Radek J.T. Morris J.P. Castellino F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1237-1241Google Scholar).Continuous Assays of Amidolytic Activity for HPlg•SK-Peptide Virgin Enzyme ComplexesIncubations of equimolar HPlg and truncated SK peptides (final concentration, 2 μM) at 25°C in 10 mM HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, for a time interval determined by the above method to achieve maximal active-site formation. The amidolytic activity was measured by adding aliquots of the HPlg•SK-peptides (final concentration, 0.2 μM) in an assay cuvette containing 0.5 mM S-2251 in 0.05 M Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and 0.1 M NaCl. The absorbance at 405 nm was monitored.Amidase Parameters of the HPlg•SK-Peptide Virgin Enzyme ComplexesHPlg (final concentration, 2 μM) was incubated with equimolar SK peptides in 10 mM HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, at 25°C for 4-7 min to achieve the maximal active-site formation. The amidolytic activity of the stoichiometric complex (final concentration, 0.2 μM) was measured with various concentrations of S-2251 ranging from 0.2 to 4 Km, at 37°C and in 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 M NaCl. The changes in absorbance at 405 nm were monitored. The initial rate and substrate concentration data were analyzed on a Lineweaver-Burk plot.Binding of Truncated SK Peptides to HPlgSK or truncated SK peptide was labeled with 125I by the method described previously(31Wu H.L. Wu I.S. Fang R.Y. Hau J.S. Wu D.H. Chang B.I. Lin T.M. Shi G.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 703-711Google Scholar, 32Wu H.L. Chang B.I. Wu D.H. Chang L.C. Gong C.C. Lou K.L. Shi G.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19658-19664Google Scholar). The binding analysis was carried out by coating a radioimmunoassay strip plate (Costar) with 0.2 ml of HPlg (2 mg/ml) in 0.05 M carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6 for 36 h at 4°C, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After washing, 125I-labeled SK or truncated SK peptide at increasing concentrations was added to the wells and incubated at 4°C for 1 h. The unbound peptide was thoroughly washed out with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and the radioactivity was determined with a LKB γ-counter. Nonspecific binding of the tested peptide was measured in the presence of a 30-fold excess of each unlabeled peptide and was subtracted from the total binding.RESULTSThe SK gene of 1.3 kilobases was amplified by PCR with standard procedures from S. equisimilis H46A and was constructed into pGEM-3Z and pET3 plasmid. Unidirectional deletion of SK gene from either end was carried out with exonuclease III. Nine truncated SKs were prepared and designated SK(16-414), SK(60-414), SK(91-414), SK(127-414), SK(158-414), SK(220-414), SK(16-378), SK(16-316), and SK(16-251). The numbers in the parenthesis indicate positions of the initial and terminal amino acids of the corresponding truncated SK peptide according to the published amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of SK gene(1Malke H. Roe B. Ferretti J.J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 34: 357-362Google Scholar, 33Misselwitz R. Kraft R. Kostak S. Fabian H. Welfle K. Pfeil W. Welfle H. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1992; 14: 107-116Google Scholar). In sequencing the PCR-amplified full-length SK DNA, one silent mutation at Lys61 (AAA → AAG) and one mutation at Arg401 to Pro (CGT → CCT) were detected as compared with the SK gene sequences(1Malke H. Roe B. Ferretti J.J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 34: 357-362Google Scholar). The slightly modified SK DNA was used for preparation of truncated SK peptides without correction of these mutations. Apparently the alteration had no effect on the HPlg activator activity of recombinant SK since purified SK(16-414) had a specific activity of 118,755 IU/mg (Table 1), which is comparable with purified commercially available native SK. The expressed recombinant SK and its truncated peptides were also sequenced and found to be identical to the published sequence (1Malke H. Roe B. Ferretti J.J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 34: 357-362Google Scholar, 2Jackson K.W. Tang J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6620-6625Google Scholar) except that an additional fusion peptide of 14-18 amino acid residues derived from the pET-3 plasmid was attached at their NH2 termini. The SK(16-414) DNA was used to prepare COOH-truncated SK, since SK(16-414) protein had the same HPlg activator activity as native SK, and the SK peptides without NH2-terminal 15 amino acids were more easily overexpressed in the E. coli cells than the full-length SK. In general the NH2- and COOH-truncated SK peptides overexpressed in the E. coli system consisted of more than 70% of the total amount of proteins in the crude extracts of the E. coli cells. Homogeneous SK peptides were obtained after ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE column chromatography as shown in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). All of the SK peptides could be detected by a polyclonal antiserum raised against the native SK. The recovery and specific activities of SK peptides during each purification step are summarized in Table 1. The specific HPlg activator activities of purified SK(16-414) and SK(16-378) were higher than 100,000 IU/mg and were comparable with that of the purified commercial native SK. SK(60-414), SK(91-414), SK(127-414), SK(158-414), and SK(16-316) had low specific HPlg activator activities (Table 1). The HPlg activator activities of the two short peptides, SK(16-251) and SK(220-414), were too low to detect.TABLE I Open table in a new tab SK(16-414) and SK(16-378) at a catalytic concentration (0.02 μM) could effectively catalyze the conversion of HPlg (2 μM) to HPlm, and an increasing rate of substrate hydrolysis was observed as more HPlm was produced (Fig. 2A). The conversion of HPlg to HPlm was completed in 10 min as confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The bands of HPlg (94 kDa) disappeared, and both the heavy (65 kDa) and light (26 kDa) chains were detected (Fig. 2B). The second-order rate constants of HPlg activation, kplg/Kplg, of native SK, SK(16-414), and SK(16-378) were similar (Table 2). SK(60-414) had low HPlg activator activity (Table 1). However, its activator activity could be dose-dependently enhanced by incubating with a catalytic amount of SK(1-59), which was prepared by limited digestion of native SK with immobilized HPlm and purified by HPLC (Fig. 2A). After 10 min of incubation, about half of HPlg was activated by SK(1-59) modified SK(60-414)*, while complete activation occurred after 30 min of incubation (Fig. 2B). This result suggests that SK(1-59) may induce a conformational change in SK(60-414) to form an efficient activator. SK(91-414), SK(127-414), or SK(158-414) alone at a catalytic amount could not activate HPlg nor in the presence of SK(1-59).Figure 2Activation of HPlg by SK(16-414), SK(16-378), and SK(60-414)*.

The equimolar HPlg and SK(91-414) had a maximal amidolytic activity after reaction for 7 min (Fig. 3A). However, no cleavage of the activating peptide bond, Arg560-Val561, of HPlg was observed at up to 13 min determined at intervals as shown by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3B), suggesting that a virgin enzyme, which consisted of intact HPlg and SK(91-414) equimolar complex, was induced. However, after reaction for more than 15 min, some HPlg was hydrolyzed, heavy and light chains of HPlm were detected, and SK(91-414) was degraded (Fig. 3B, lanes e and f). The cleavage of the activating peptide bond was also confirmed by NH2-terminal amino acid determination of the HPlm light chain. Virgin enzymes could also be induced in stoichiometric complexes of HPlg and other truncated SK peptides, although different durations of incubation were required to reach maximal amidolytic activities. For example, to achieve the maximal amidolytic activities, it took 4 min for HPlg and SK(16-414) or SK(16-378), but 7 min for HPlg and SK(91-414), SK(127-414), or SK(158-414). The rates for hydrolysis of S-2251 by the virgin enzyme complexes of HPlg and truncated SK peptides are shown in Fig. 4A. The HPlg•SK(16-414) and HPlg•SK(16-378) had similar second-order reaction constant (kcat/Km) as HPlm in hydrolysis of substrate S-2251 (Table 3). The virgin enzymes of HPlg•SK(91-414), HPlg•SK(127-414), and HPlg•SK(158-414) had lower reaction constants (Table 3). Initially, no HPlm conversion was observed in each HPlg•SK-peptide virgin enzyme complex, since only HPlg and the corresponding SK peptide were detected by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4B). However, after incubation for 15 min, HPlm formation was also observed in the equimolar complexes of HPlg•SK(127-414) and HPlg•SK(158-414) as that of HPlg•SK(91-414), suggesting that the activation peptide bond in these complexes was also cleaved.Figure 3Discontinuous assay for measuring the rates of active-site generation in HPlg and SK(91-414) complex.

It also failed to induce a virgin enzyme formation in an equimolar stoichiometric complex with HPlg under the same conditions described previously. However, enzyme activity of HPlm converted from HPlg in HPlg•SK(16-316) equimolar complex could be detected after incubation for 20 min and reached its maximum after 30 min (Fig. 5A). Cleavage of the activating peptide of HPlg in the HPlg•SK(16-316) complex was observed after 20 min of incubation as analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5B). The SK(16-316) in the complex was degraded as the HPlm appeared (Fig. 5B). The truncated peptides, SK(220-414) and SK(16-251), could neither induce catalytically active virgin enzyme in the stoichiometric complexes with HPlg nor activate HPlg to HPlm in the complexes. However, the isotope-labeled SK(220-414) and SK(16-251) could bind to HPlg (Fig. 6).Figure 5Discontinuous assay for measuring the amidolytic activity of HPlg and SK(16-316) complex.

Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9915-9922Google Scholar) except for SK(60-414). This result suggests that the recombinant truncated SK peptides were suitable for the study of structure-function relationship of SK. SK(60-414) had a majority of disordered secondary structure according to the CD spectroscopy. It also had a lower HPlg activator activity compared with the SK-p, Ser60-Lys387 (or Ser60-Lys386 according to the numbering used in this study) obtained by limited digestion of native SK(19Shi G.Y. Chang B.I. Chen S.M. Wu D.H. Wu H.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 235-241Google Scholar). The fusion peptide of 14 amino acid residues in the NH2-terminal of SK(60-414) might interrupt the proper conformation of SK(60-414). However, after incubation with SK(1-59), SK(60-414) was shifted to SK(60-414)*, with elevation of HPlg activator activity. This might be due to a conformational change in SK(60-414) induced by SK(1-59). Therefore, SK(1-59) was important in maintaining the proper conformation of the core region of SK (19Shi G.Y. Chang B.I. Chen S.M. Wu D.H. Wu H.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 235-241Google Scholar).Since SK(16-414) and SK(16-378) were as active as native SK in HPlg activation, the peptides Ile1-Asn15 and Ser379-Lys414 were of little functional importance for SK. The study in which two SK gene products, cSKL, Ile1-Ala384 (or Ile1-Ala383 according to the numbering used in this study), and cSKS, Ile1-Leu383 (or Ile1-Leu382 according to the numbering used in this study), were cloned suggested that Ala384 (or Ala383) was essential for activator activity of SK(35Jackson K.W. Malke H. Gerlach D. Ferretti J.J. Jordan T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 108-114Google Scholar), since Ile1-Ala384 (or Ile1-Ala383) had full activator activity, while Ile1-Leu383 (or Ile1-Leu382) retained only 25% activity. However, SK(16-378) prepared in this study was as active as native SK in HPlg activation and also had a properly folded secondary structure. The low activator activity of cSKS might be due to reasons other than Ala384 (or Ala383) directly involved in activation of HPlg.In this report, we defined five important regions in SK molecule as a HPlg activator. These regions were as follows: a, Ile1-Lys59; b, Ser60-Asn90; c, Val158-Arg219; d, Tyr252-Ala316; e, Ser317-Ala378 as shown in Fig. SI.Figure SIScheme IView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Region a functioned to stabilize the conformation of SK in maintaining its full activator activity. SK(60-414), which contained regions b, c, d, and e, was a competent HPlg activator, although the activation rate was slower than those of SK(16-414) and SK(16-378) (Fig. 2A). SK(91-414), at a molar ratio of one-tenth of HPlg, could not activate free HPlg. However, an equimolar complex of HPlg and SK(91-414) was amidolytically active. The complex of HPlg and SK(127-414) or SK(158-414) had properties similar to SK(91-414). Therefore, the SK peptide, which contained regions c, d, and e, had the ability to form a so-called virgin enzyme complex with HPlg, and region b was essential for HPlg activation. The conversion of HPlg to HPlm in these one-to-one complexes of SK peptides and HPlg was detected after a lag period of 15 min (Fig. 3B). The reason of this slow HPlg conversion to HPlm in the complexes remains unclear. It is possible that the conformation of HPlg is transformed in the complex and the activating peptide bond is more vulnerable for hydrolysis by the less effective activators. In regard to the formation of virgin enzyme complex with HPlg, SK(220-414), which contained regions d and e, lost this ability. Therefore, the region c, Val158-Arg219, was thought to possess one of the essential interaction cores for virgin enzyme formation. The COOH-terminal truncated SK(16-378) had all the essential regions to form a virgin enzyme complex with HPlg and to catalyze HPlg activation. The SK(16-316), which consisted of regions a, b, c, and d but not e, could not form virgin enzyme and could not catalyze the activation of HPlg into HPlm as a typical SK-type HPlg activator. However, the HPlg moiety was slowly converted to HPlm in equimolar HPlg•SK(16-316) complex but not in HPlg•SK(16-251), in which SK(16-251) contained only regions a, b, and c. Therefore, region d apparently was involved in the induction of the conformational changes in HPlg, so that it could be activated in the complex.In conclusion, by studying with the truncated SK peptides, five regions of defined functions in SK molecules were deduced. The functional studies of the truncated SK peptides provided the evidence that more than one region on SK could interact with HPlg. By comparing the functions of the truncated SK, we were able to define the function of each region of SK. These findings were consistent with the results of NMR and CD spectroscopy studies of SK in which a flexible structure of SK with existence of at least three or four domains was proposed(36Teuten A.J. Broadhurst R.W. Smith R.A.G. Dobson C.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 313-319Google Scholar, 37Damaschun G. Damaschun H. Gast K. Gerlach D. Misselwitz R. Welfle H. Zirwer D. Eur. Biophys. J. 1992; 20: 355-361Google Scholar). The elucidation of the function of each of these specific regions of SK molecule is very important for understanding the molecular mechanism of its interaction with HPlg. Further studies on the functions of specific point mutation of SK in different regions might provide more critical information needed for the delineation of the intriguing interaction between SK and HPlg.

Roe B. Ferretti J.J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 34: 357-362Google Scholar) or 415 (2Jackson K.W. Tang J.

The SK and human plasminogen (HPlg) can form an equimolar activator complex that catalyzes the conversion of plasminogens (Plgs) to plasmins (Plms) of different mammalian species(4Ling C.M.

Plm is a potent protease that in turn catalyzes the hydrolysis of fibrin, which causes the dissolution of blood clots. SK, therefore, is used as a thrombolytic agent clinically to relieve thromboembolic blockages in blood vessels, such as acute myocardial infarction.Studies of the activation of HPlg by SK suggest that more than one intermediate step is involved in the entire process. In the first step, a 1:1 stoichiometric complex of HPlg and SK is formed, and the conformation of the catalytic domain of HPlg is altered to expose its enzyme-active center(6McClintock D.K. Bell P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 43: 694-702Google Scholar, 7Reddy K.N.N. Markus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1683-1691Google Scholar, 9Reddy K.N.N. Markus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4851-4857Google Scholar). The HPlg moiety in the complex has been named virgin enzyme since it has similar catalytic activity to human plasmin (HPlm), but the activating peptide bond of Arg560-Val561 is not cleaved(12Summaria L. Wohl R.C. Boreisha I.G. Robbins K.C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2056-2059Google Scholar). In the second reaction step, the HPlg•SK complex is converted to HPlm•SK, and then in the final reaction step, the HPlm•SK catalyzes the hydrolysis of the specific activating peptide bond of Arg560-Val561 on substrate HPlg, resulting in the formation of HPlm(5Wulf R.J. Mertz E.T. Can. J. Biochem. 1969; 47: 927-931Google Scholar, 8Schick L.A. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4315-4321Google Scholar, 13Gonzalez-Gronow M. Siefring Jr., G.E. Castellino F.J. J.

Proteolytic SK fragments obtained in the reactions of SK with human, rabbit, and dog Plg(m)s have been used to study the functions of the SK molecule(15Siefring Jr., G.E. Castellino F.J. J. Biol.

A 17-kDa SK fragment consisting of Val143 (Glu148) to Arg289 (Lys293) obtained in the reaction with Sepharose-immobilized HPlg (HPlm) is the smallest SK fragment that can bind to HPlg(18Rodriguez P. Fuentes D. Munoz E. Rivero D. Orta D. Alburquerque S. Perez S. Besada V. Herrera L. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8: 276-285Google Scholar). A SK fragment, SK-o, Ser60-Lys333 (or Ser60-Lys332 according to the numbering used in this paper), is essential for minimal SK activator activity(19Shi G.Y. Chang B.I. Chen S.M. Wu D.H. Wu H.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 235-241Google Scholar). Obviously, the COOH-terminal peptide of SK-p, Ala334-Lys387 (or Ala333-Lys386), is required for strong binding with HPlm. The NH2-terminal 59-amino acid peptide is important in maintaining the proper conformation of SK for full activator activity(19Shi G.Y. Chang B.I. Chen S.M. Wu D.H. Wu H.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 235-241Google Scholar). These studies imply that domain-like structures may exist in the SK molecule that exert various functions in HPlg activation. This study was undertaken to elucidate the functions of various domains of SK and to determine more precisely the interaction sites between SK and HPlg using a series of truncated SK peptides lacking NH2 and/or COOH-terminal amino acid residues."

It is particularly abundant in T-lymphocytes, granule cells of the cerebellum and meiotic male germ cells (Ohmstede et al., 1991; Means et al., 1991; Hanissian et al., 1993; Jones et al., 1991; Miyano et al., 1992). Although CaM kinase IV is the product of a unique gene in both mouse and human (Sikela et al., 1989, 1990), two isoforms of the enzyme are present in the cerebellum with relative Mr of about 62,000 (α) and 64,000 (β) (Ohmstede et al., 1989). The cDNA of the smaller α isoform, which has a calculated Mr of 53,159, has been expressed in Escherichia coli and baculovirus systems, and many properties of the enzyme have been determined (Cruzalegui and Means, 1993; Okuno and Fujisawa, 1993; Mosialos et al., 1994; Kitani et al., 1994; Enslen et al., 1994; Tokumitsu et al., 1994; Selbert et al., 1995). The relationship between the α and β isoforms is controversial. It has been suggested that β is a post-translational modification of α (Mosialos et al., 1994). However, McDonald et al.(1993) provided evidence that β could not be converted to α by dephosphorylation and argued for an independent gene product. The latter contention was strengthened by Sakagami and Kondo(1993) who obtained a cDNA from a rat brain library thought to encode the larger β isoform. The calculated Mr was 55,705, and it differed from the α isoform only by a unique 28-amino acid N-terminal extension. Whereas the β mRNA was distributed differently from α in parasagital sections of the brain, the properties of CaM kinase IVβ have yet to be reported. The α form of CaM kinase IV requires phosphorylation on a threonine residue in the “activation loop” (Thr177) by a CaM kinase IV kinase for full activity (Selbert et al., 1995). This phosphorylation stimulates subsequent autophosphorylation on several serine residues, resulting in a significant amount of Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activity (McDonald et al., 1993; Selbert et al., 1995). Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV cAMP response element 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside kilobase pair(s) base pair(s) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase polymerase chain reaction phosphate-buffered saline. The C-terminal 169 amino acids of CaM kinase IV comprise a separate protein called calspermin that is expressed exclusively in postmeiotic male germ cells (Ono et al., 1989; Means et al., 1991). This is the most abundant calmodulin-binding protein in spermatozoa but is of unknown function. In heterologous cell lines, the transcript of calspermin can be initiated from a promoter within an intron of the CaM kinase IV gene (Means et al., 1991; Jones et al., 1991; Ohmstede et al. 1991; Sun et al., 1995) and, with the exception of the first 130 nucleotides, is identical to the corresponding region of the CaM kinase IV transcript (Means et al., 1991). Transcription from this promoter in NIH3T3 cells requires two cyclic AMP response elements (CRE) at -70 and -50 bp relative to the transcription start site (Sun et al., 1995). These CREs bind the transcription factors CREB or CREMτ and either factor markedly stimulates activity of the basal promoter defined by Sun et al.(1995) as the genomic DNA fragment extending from nucleotide -80 to nucleotide +361. However, the addition of 120 bp to the 5′ end of the basal promoter markedly inhibits transcription in NIH3T3 cells. Some activity could be restored by cotransfection of CREMτ (or CREB) together with CaM kinase IV (or protein kinase A). We have suggested that the -200 to +361 fragment might be sufficient to produce germ cell-specific transcription. We have cloned the entire CaM kinase IV gene which spans greater than 42 kbp. The organization of this gene suggests that CaM kinase IVβ and -α and calspermin are all produced by alternative transcriptional initiation. The longest transcript would produce CaM kinase IVβ. The CaM kinase IVα promoter is located within the first intron, whereas the promoter and first exon of calspermin are located in intron 10. We also show the -200 to +321 region of the calspermin gene is sufficient to target expression of a reporter gene in transgenic mice. Expression of the transgene is restricted to postmeiotic male germ cells and shows the correct developmental pattern during the initiation of spermatogenesis. However, transgene expression can be induced in primary cultures of skin fibroblasts by transfection of expression vectors encoding CREMτ and CaM kinase IV. Genomic clones were obtained by screening two rat genomic libraries with cDNA probes derived from various portions of the full-length cDNA (Means et al., 1991). One library was in Charon 35 and the other was a λ-DASH library from Stratagene. Subgenomic EcoRI fragments were subcloned into either pGEM or pUC plasmids for sequencing. The location of the EcoRI sites is shown in Fig. 1B. Nucleotide sequence was obtained using sequencing kits from Amersham Corp. In many cases sequencing was extended by the use of synthetic oligonucleotides based on the previous sequencing reaction results as primers. All exons, intron/exon junctions, and 1100 bp of 5′-flanking DNA were completely sequenced on both strands. Some of the large introns were not completely sequenced, so the 42 kbp is probably an underestimate of the gene size. The sequence of 5′-flanking region presented in Fig. 3 has been deposited in the EMBL data base under accession number X91964.FIGURE 3:The nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the rat CaM kinase IV gene. The numbers are relative to the A of the ATG encoding the initiation codon for CaM kinase IVα which is +1. The numbers above the nucleotide sequences represent significant regions of the 5′-flanking region: A-211, the transcriptional start site of CaM kinase IVα (Means et al., 1991); B+1 and B-69 the translation initiation site and first nucleotide of the cloned cDNA for CaM kinase IVβ as described by Sakagami and Kondo (1993); -350 -460 -500, and -1060 are the 5′ nucleotides of the promoter constructs used to generate the data in Fig. 4. All of these DNA fragments ended at -11. The vertical lines depict exon/intron and intron/exon junctions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Different fragments of CaM kinase α promoter were amplified from a 6-kbp genomic DNA fragment by PCR according to the conditions described by Boehringer Mannheim for its Taq DNA polymerase. In order to subclone the PCR fragments into pCAT basic vector (Promega), the 5′ primers (synthesized using an Applied Biosystem 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer) were designed to contain a PstI site, and the 3′ primer was designed to contain a XbaI site. PCR products (amplified by a Perkin-Elmer DNA thermal cycler), which were digested by PstI and XbaI, were then subcloned between the PstI and XbaI sites of the pCAT basic vector. In all cases the PCR-derived fragments were sequenced to ensure that no errors had been introduced. The oligonucleotide sequences used in the construction of different length promoter fragments are available upon request. Transfections and CAT assays were performed as described by Sun et al.(1995). The β-galactosidase plasmid was created by cloning the -200 to +321 DNA fragment of the calspermin gene into the XbaI and PstI sites of pUC19/AUG β-galactosidase (a gift from Dr. Eric N. Olson, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). The KpnI fragment containing the -200 to +321 promoter fragment, the β-galactosidase gene, the SV40 splicing junction, and poly(A) addition site was microinjected into the male pronuclei of one-cell stage embryos, and transgenic founder mice were generated by the Transgenic Core Facility of the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center. X-Gal β-galactosidase assay: fresh tissues were removed from mice and then fixed for 30 min at 4°C in a solution containing 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.02% Nonidet P-40. After fixation, tissues were stained for 5 h at 37°C in a solution containing 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 3 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 3 mM K4Fe(CN)6, and 1 mg/ml X-gal. β-Galactosidase converts X-gal into a water-insoluble blue product which allows visual identification of the tissues containing β-galactosidase activity. Cultured cells were washed twice with PBS and then fixed for 5 min at room temperature in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3. The cells were washed twice with PBS after fixation and stained in X-gal solution at 37°C for 24 h. X-Gal solution contains 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 3 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 3 mM K4Fe(CN)6, and 1 mg/ml X-gal. 100 μg of protein from homogenized fresh tissues of transgenic mice were used for β-galactosidase activity assay. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bradford, 1976). 100 μg of protein from the supernatant was added to 600 μl of Z buffer (60 mM Na2HPO4, 40 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 4 mM chlorophenored-β-D-galactopyranoside). After 20-min to 1-h incubation at 37°C, the reaction was terminated by placing the samples on ice. If β-galactosidase activity was present, the solution became a red color, which could be readily visualized. The optical density was recorded at 420 nm, and enzyme activity was calculated as described (Macgregor et al., 1991). Antibody to β-galactosidase was obtained from 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., (Boulder, CO). Immunohistochemistry was performed using the staining procedure provided by Vector Laboratory (Burlingame, CA). The frozen sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, and the endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating the sections for 30 min in 0.3% H2O2. After washing the sections with phosphate-buffered normal saline solution (PBS) for 20 min, the sections were incubated for 20 min with diluted normal blocking serum, which was prepared from the species in which secondary antibody was made. The blocking serum was washed away with PBS, and the sections were incubated at 37°C with β-galactosidase antibody which was diluted 500 times with 1 × PBS, 0.02% sodium azide, 1% bovine serum albumin. The slides were washed in PBS for 15 min and incubated with diluted secondary antibody solution at room temperature for 30 min. After washing the sections for 15 min with PBS, the sections were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were washed again with PBS for 15 min and then the sections were incubated in peroxidase substrate, 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine with 0.3 mg/ml nickel, for 2-7 min or until the desired stain intensity developed. The sections were washed for 5 min in water and counterstained with hematoxylin for 30 s to 5 min. The skin from a 2-day-old transgenic mouse was cut into 1-mm small pieces and transferred to a 60-mm tissue culture dish. The skin tissue was air-dried for 10 min in the culture dish before adding the medium. This step ensures that the skin tissue attaches to the culture dish so it will not float away when the medium is added. Five ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum was added into each culture dish and maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C for several days. It usually took 1-2 days for fibroblasts to migrate out of the skin and attach to the culture dish. The medium was changed every 3 or 4 days until the cells became confluent, which required 1-2 weeks. After that the fibroblasts were passaged as regular cell lines. The transfections were performed with a Bio-Rad gene pulser transfection apparatus. 10 μg of DNA and 0.8 ml of cell suspension (1 × 106 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) were placed in a 0.4-cm gene pulser cuvette. The DNA and cells were thoroughly mixed by pipetting. This mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature prior to electroporation. The cuvette was placed into the chamber and electroporated once at 250 V and 960 microfarads. A pCMV-CAT construct was cotransfected as an internal control. The cells were then incubated at room temperature for 10 min before being plated into culture dishes. The cells were grown for 4 days for the purpose of the β-galactosidase and CAT assays. The organization of about 42 kbp of genomic DNA representing the entire CaM kinase IV gene is shown in Fig. 1B. It is comprised of 12 exons (Roman numerals) and 11 introns (capital letters). An expanded diagram representing the translational initiation codons of the β and α isoforms, based on cDNA sequences of Sakagami and Kondo(1993) and Means et al. (1991), respectively, is shown in Fig. 1A. This analysis predicted that the promoter for the α-kinase would reside in intron A. The region in intron J containing the promoter and testis-specific exon required to produce the calspermin transcript is illustrated in Fig. 1C. The nucleotide sequence of -1930 to +361 has been previously published by Sun et al.(1995). The nucleotide sequence of all exon/intron junctions and the amino acid sequence of the cDNA interrupted by each are shown in Fig. 2. The sequence of 1100 nucleotides of the region flanking the translation initiation codon of the α-kinase isoform (where the A of the ATG is designated as +1), the sequence of exon II, encoding the first 50 amino acids of the α-kinase, and 34 nucleotides of intron B are shown in Fig. 3. The A of the ATG predicted to encode the initiating Met of the β-kinase by Sakagami and Kondo(1993) is at -524 in what we have termed exon I. Exon I encodes the first 8 amino acids of β-kinase and ends with the first exon/intron junction at -504. This intron A contains the transcription initiation site of the α kinase at -211 as defined by Means et al.(1991). The boundary between intron A and exon II occurs at -60. Whereas the sequence from -60 to +1 is noncoding in the α-kinase, it encodes amino acids 8 through 28 of the β-kinase. The remainder of the α- and β-kinase sequence is identical and Met1 of the α isoform would be Met29 of the β isoform. Since the ATG site for CaM kinase IVα is separated from the predicted CaM kinase IVβ ATG by an intron (intron A, Fig. 1B), we tested whether this intron might contain a promoter that could be used to drive transcription of CaM kinase IVα. Different segments of DNA upstream of the ATG site for CaM kinase IVα were amplified by PCR and linked to a CAT reporter gene. The sequence of the DNA fragments linked to CAT is shown in Fig. 3. The ability of each construct to direct expression of the CAT gene was analyzed following transfection into HeLa cells by the CaPO4 method. The results shown in Fig. 4 were obtained 48 h after transfection. For quantitation of CAT activity, an internal control, pRSV-β-gal, and a negative control, pCAT basic (a promoterless CAT), were included. Although the longer DNA fragments (-460/-11, -500/-11, and -1060/-11) did not generate significant CAT activity, the DNA from -350 to -11 resulted in CAT activity similar to that produced by the SV40 promoter, suggesting that the upstream region of the CaM kinase IVα harbors a promoter element. Our previous studies demonstrated that DNA extending from -80 to +361 (Fig. 1C) relative to the calspermin transcription initiation site had strong promoter activity in NIH3T3 cells (Sun et al., 1995). However, promoter activity was severely inhibited in these cells by extending the 5′-flanking sequence to -200, unless CREMτ or CREB expression vectors were cotransfected. We tested whether this -200 to +321 promoter region could be expressed in testis and was sufficient to produce germ cell-specific transcription. As illustrated in Fig. 1D, the -200 to +321 calspermin promoter fragment was linked to a lacZ reporter gene. The KpnI restriction fragment was microinjected into the male pronuclei of one-cell stage embryos to generate transgenic mice. Five positive founder mice were identified by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). In order to localize β-galactosidase activity, extracts from various tissues were prepared from postpubertal transgenic and nontransgenic littermates. Enzyme activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and a typical result is shown in Fig. 5. Offspring from the three surviving lines of transgenic mice showed high levels of β-galactosidase activity in testis, and testis from the transgenic mice was the only tissue analyzed that specifically expressed elevated levels of β-galactosidase activity. Different absolute levels of β-galactosidase activity were measured from testes of mice from the different transgenic lines which was likely the result of integration of the transgene into different locations in the genome and/or the presence of different copy numbers. Testes from postpubertal transgenic mice were removed, briefly fixed, and then soaked in an X-gal solution for 5 h. The transgenic testis stained an intense blue as shown in Fig. 6A. A testis from an age-matched nontransgenic littermate was treated in an identical way and is shown in Fig. 6B. The control testis remained unstained and thus contained little β-galactosidase activity. Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine which cell types expressed β-galactosidase in postpubertal testis as shown in Fig. 6. The immunoreactive β-galactosidase protein was stained black as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the tissue sections were counterstained with hemotoxylin. β-Galactosidase was localized primarily in the central portion of the seminiferous tubules in testis from transgenic mice as indicated by the arrow (in Fig. 6C). Fig. 6E is a higher magnification of one representative tubule. β-Galactosidase is present predominantly where elongating spermatids are located. No β-galactosidase expression was detected in testis from nontransgenic mice (Fig. 4D). These results reveal that β-galactosidase is expressed from the calspermin promoter specifically in postmeiotic germ cells during the late stages of spermiogenesis. Expression of the transgene was also examined as a function of postnatal development. The first cycle of spermatogenesis begins at birth and is completed at about day 34 (Russell, 1990). Spermatogonia constitute the predominant germ cell population in 6-8 day mice. Leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes appear at day 10, pachytene spermatocytes at day 14, round spermatids at day 19-20, and elongating spermatids at day 23-25 (Bellve et al., 1995). β-Galactosidase activity of testis from transgenic mice of various postnatal ages was measured as shown in Fig. 7. There was no significant change in β-galactosidase activity before day 19. The first obvious increase of β-galactosidase activity occurred between days 22 and 24, correlating with the initial appearance of elongating spermatids. β-Galactosidase activity continued to increase until day 35 when the first round of spermatogenesis is completed. Similar changes of β-galactosidase activity during testis development were observed in the other two lines of transgenic mice (data not shown). Collectively the observations suggest that expression of the lacZ transgene is primarily restricted to postmeiotic germ cells. To test the hypothesis that the lack of expression of the -200 to +321 calspermin promoter in somatic tissues was due to an insufficient concentration of CREM (Sun et al., 1995), we prepared primary cultures of skin fibroblasts from transgenic mice. As shown in Fig. 8, these cells did not express β-galactosidase, confirming the in vivo results. The remainder of Fig. 8 reports results of a typical experiment designed to restore transgene expression. Expression vectors for CREMτ, CaM kinase IV, or both were transfected into the fibroblasts. After 4 days the cells were stained for X-gal and the number of blue cells within 10 random microscopic fields were counted. Whereas neither CREMτ or CaM kinase IV alone was effective, cotransfection of CREMτ and CaM kinase IV resulted in β-galactosidase expression in all transfected cells. Since cAMP dependent protein kinase can also phosphorylate CREB and CREB is present in the fibroblasts, cell cultures were treated with forskolin to elevate cAMP. This treatment also failed to restore transgene expression. These results demonstrate that high levels of transcriptionally competent CREMτ produced by phosphorylation by CaM kinase IV are sufficient stimulus to restore expression of the calspermin promoter-driven transgene in a somatic cells that is otherwise unable to express the normally testis-specific promoter. The rat CaM kinase IV gene spans at least 42 kbp of DNA and contains 12 exons. With the exception of the second (362 bp) and last (456 bp) exons, the other nine average only 82 bp in length. This complicated structural organization, if the norm, might explain why other genes encoding calmodulin-dependent enzymes from multicellular organisms have yet to be sequenced in their entirety. The location of the introns in the coding region seems to disrupt at random, and without other CaM kinase gene structures to compare, little else can be concluded. The unusual aspect of the CaM kinase gene organization is that alternative promoters exist in the first and penultimate introns. The intron 1 promoter presumably directs transcription of the smaller or α form of CaM kinase IV which is the enzyme on which most of the biochemical characterization has been performed. We show that a fragment extending about 150 bp from the transcriptional start site at -211 (Fig. 3) can function as a promoter in HeLa cells. This 150-bp fragment contains GC-rich regions typical for those present in a variety of genes but does not contain a TATA box. In the only other published study evaluating regulation of the expression of a CaM kinase gene, Olson et al.(1995) show the importance of a TATA box at -162 of the CaM kinase IIα gene. Extending the 150-bp promoter fragment of the CaM kinase IV gene 100 bp or more at the 5′ end severely reduces transcription in HeLa cells. Since CaM kinase IV α expression is generally limited to thymic lymphocytes, cerebellum, and testicular germ cells undergoing meiosis, perhaps the silencing due to addition of additional 5′ sequences reflects such cell specificity. Alternatively, it is possible that expression of CaM kinase IV requires regulation, and HeLa cells do not contain such putative regulatory factors. For example, a preliminary report suggested that expression of the enzyme in an embryonic stem cell-derived neuronal culture required thyroid hormone and the thyroid hormone receptor α (Larson et al., 1995). The availability of the 5′-flanking region of the CaM kinase IV gene will allow a mechanistic approach to this problem. The organization of the CaM kinase IV gene also allows a plausible explanation for how the β and α isoforms of the enzyme are generated. Sakagami and Kondo(1993) reported the isolation of a rat brain cDNA that encoded a different form of CaM kinase IV than that cloned by Means et al.(1991). The only differences were the presence of a 92-bp extension of unique sequence at the 5′ end and the absence of 151 bp of 5′-nontranslated region present in the clone obtained by Means et al.(1991). The 92-bp extension was predicted to change the start site of translation resulting in an additional 28 N-terminal amino acids not present in the CaM kinase IVα. The first 8 amino acids would be encoded by the last 24 bp of the unique sequence, whereas the remaining 20 amino acids would be encoded by nucleotides present as part of the 5′-nontranslated sequence of the α cDNA. Whereas Sakagami and Kondo(1993) did not formally show the presence of a protein containing the extra 28 amino acids, they did utilize in situ hybridization to reveal that the unique segments of the two cDNAs differently hybridized to anatomical structures present in parasagital sections of rat brain. As shown in Fig. 3, the flanking region of the CaM kinase IV gene contains all the unique nucleotides present in both α and β CaM kinase cDNA clones. The 92 bp unique to β are separated from the initial common segment, also suggested to be present by Bland(1993), by an intervening 464 bp. We have interpreted this intervening segment to represent an intron due to the presence of donor and acceptor splicing sites. The fact that the first 151 bp of the α cDNA constitute the last segment of this intron implied that additional sequences in the intron might function as a promoter. Preliminary evidence supporting this possibility is shown in Fig. 4. Whereas our data cannot prove the existence of two CaM kinase IV isoforms derived from one gene, they do support the contention of Sakagami and Kondo(1993) that α and β are the products of distinct mRNAs. What our results have proven is that the 10th intron of the CaM kinase IV gene contains the testis-specific promoter responsible for the production of the calspermin protein. The -200 to +321 region of the calspermin promoter fragment was sufficient to target expression of β-galactosidase to postmeiotic germ cells in a cell- and developmentally specific manner that mimics expression of the endogenous gene judged from in situ hybridization analyses (Means et al., 1991). Sun et al.(1995) had shown that the -200 to +361 region of the calspermin gene contained at least three elements that influenced expression. First the -80 to +361 fragment could be expressed in a variety of cultured cells. One required element included the two CREs at -70 and -50. The second element was the 111-bp intron sequence separating the 3′ end of the testis-specific calspermin exon from the 5′ end of exon XI that is common to both CaM kinase and calspermin (Fig. 1C). This intron was subsequently shown to function in an orientation-dependent but distance-independent manner and was required for stimulation of transcription by CREMτ (Sun and Means, 1995). The third element was contained in the DNA between -200 and -80, since the addition of this 120 bp largely inhibited transcriptional activity in NIH3T3 cells. We postulated that these negative elements could contribute to the inhibition of calspermin gene expression in somatic tissues in vivo. The fact that the transgene driven by the -200 to +321 is not expressed in any somatic tissues examined in the present studies supports this suggestion (Fig. 5). Although the -200 to +361 calspermin promoter had very little activity when acutely transfected into NIH3T3 cells, some activity could be restored by cotransfection of expression vectors encoding CREB or CREMτ together with a protein kinase capable of specifically phosphorylating the transcription factors on Ser133 or Ser117, respectively (Sun et al., 1995). This modification is required for the transactivation function (deGroot et al., 1993). Since NIH3T3 cells contain CREB, which is found at low levels in most cells, we questioned whether an important factor in the expression of the calspermin promoter might be the concentration of CRE-binding protein. Indeed the pattern of expression of CREMτ is very similar to that of calspermin and the calspermin promoter transgene. The mRNA for the transcriptional activating form of the CREM gene is first produced in very late meiotic cells (Foulkes et al., 1992), but the protein does not appear until later and accumulates to very high levels in cells undergoing the late stages of differentiation during spermiogenesis (Delmas et al., 1993). Therefore high concentrations of CREMτ are present in the same cells that transcribe the endogenous calspermin gene (Means et al., 1991) or the transgene driven by the -200 to +321 portion of the calspermin promoter (Fig. 6). We reasoned that the transgene would have integrated in a random fashion and conducted preliminary experiments, suggesting that the site of integration was different in all three transgenic lines (data not shown). Thus, if our hypothesis was correct, transgenic expression should be restored in somatic cells by simply increasing the cellular content of CREMτ. The data in Fig. 8 show, indeed, that the transgene can be expressed in primary skin fibroblasts but only when the cells are transfected with expression vectors for CREMτ and CaM kinase IV. Although the data shown are from a single transgenic line, similar results were obtained with cells derived from all three lines (data not shown). We would argue that one critical factor responsible for the cell-specific expression of the calspermin gene is the availability of high levels of CREMτ in those cells at the developmentally correct time. Clearly, the abundance of CREMτ cannot be the only factor required for calspermin gene expression, or its presence would be sufficient to activate the endogenous gene in somatic cells which is not the case (Fig. 8 and Sun et al., 1995). This has been aptly shown for the testis-specific promoter of the angiotensin converting enzyme gene which also contains a requisite CRE that binds CREMτ (Goraya et al., 1995). Although this 85-bp regulatory region is sufficient to faithfully target testis-specific expression in transgenic mice (Howard et al., 1993), it is not active in heterologous cells even when cotransfected with CREMτ. As shown by Goraya et al. (1995), mutation of the cryptic TATA box (TCTTATT) to a consensus TATAATT results in a promoter that can be expressed in heterologous cells and is responsive to CREMτ. Thus a second important factor for germ cell-specific expression could be the nature of the basal promoter elements. A third likely contributing factor could be a reorientation or modification of the gene that occurs as chromatin is remodeled following meiosis. One of the mechanisms determining the accessibility of promoters to transcription factors is DNA methylation. DNA methylation is thought to play a role in the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression (Cedar, 1988). Methylation inhibits gene expression by interfering with transcription factor binding to DNA. Studies on the DNA methylation patterns of testis-specific genes reveal a very good correlation between undermethylation and gene expression. The testis-specific histone H2B (Choi and Chae, 1991), TP1 (Trasler et al., 1990), and PGK2 (Ariel et al., 1991) genes are undermethylated in testis, but more methylated in somatic tissues where they are not expressed. It would be interesting to study the methylation patterns of the calspermin transgene and the endogenous calspermin gene and evaluate the accessibility of CREMτ to the CRE motifs in the promoter regions of both genes. Since CRE motifs are conserved within promoters of many postmeiotic germ cell specific genes (Howard et al., 1993; Delmas et al., 1992), it is tempting to speculate that they also are exposed during meiosis by chromatin rearrangement and/or demethylation and in this state also respond to the high levels of CREMτ. Were this true, then the rate-limiting signal could be the stimulus that results in the production of the CREMτ transcript from the CREM gene primary transcript. That this event is controlled by follicle-stimulating hormone (Foulkes et al., 1993) might provide one explanation for the requirement of this hormone for complete spermatogenesis (Means et al., 1976). We thank Dr. Li Jizhu (Population Council, New York) for preparing testis cryosections. Thanks and gratitude are also extended to Cheryl Bock, Director of the Transgenic Core Facility of the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center for microinjection of the lacZ construct and generation of founder transgenic mice. Finally we appreciate the efforts of Dr. Iswari Subbaraya for help in the initial stages of DNA sequencing and Dr. Donna Crenshaw for carefully reading and critiquing the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1964147271,"To better understand the regulation of gene expression by amino acids, we studied the effects of these macronutrients on fatty acid synthase (FAS), an enzyme crucial for energy storage. When HepG2 cells were fed serum-free media selectively deficient in each amino acid, the omission of any single classic essential amino acid as well as Arg or His (essential in some rapidly growing cells) resulted in FAS mRNA levels that were about half of those in complete medium. Control message levels were unaffected and omission of nonessential amino acids did not alter FAS expression. FAS mRNA levels peaked 12-16 h after feeding complete and Ser (nonessential)-deficient media but did not increase in cells fed Lys (essential)-deficient medium. With Lys, FAS mRNA increased over the physiologic concentration range of 15-150 μM, and low concentrations of lysine decreased FAS but not apoB protein mass. Transcription inhibitors mimicked treatment with Lys-deficient media, and nuclear run-off assays showed that Lys-deficient media abolished FAS but not apoB transcription. After treatment with Lys-deficient media, the intracellular Lys pool was rapidly depleted in association with an increase of uncharged (deacylated) tRNALys from <1 to 64% of available tRNALys. Even in the presence of the essential amino acid His, increasing the levels of uncharged tRNAHis with histidinol, a competitive inhibitor of the histidinyl-tRNA synthetase, blocked FAS expression. Tyrosinol treatment did not alter FAS mRNA levels. These results suggest that essential amino acids regulate FAS expression by altering uncharged tRNA levels, a novel mechanism for nutrient control of gene expression in mammalian cells. To better understand the regulation of gene expression by amino acids, we studied the effects of these macronutrients on fatty acid synthase (FAS), an enzyme crucial for energy storage. When HepG2 cells were fed serum-free media selectively deficient in each amino acid, the omission of any single classic essential amino acid as well as Arg or His (essential in some rapidly growing cells) resulted in FAS mRNA levels that were about half of those in complete medium. Control message levels were unaffected and omission of nonessential amino acids did not alter FAS expression. FAS mRNA levels peaked 12-16 h after feeding complete and Ser (nonessential)-deficient media but did not increase in cells fed Lys (essential)-deficient medium. With Lys, FAS mRNA increased over the physiologic concentration range of 15-150 μM, and low concentrations of lysine decreased FAS but not apoB protein mass. Transcription inhibitors mimicked treatment with Lys-deficient media, and nuclear run-off assays showed that Lys-deficient media abolished FAS but not apoB transcription. After treatment with Lys-deficient media, the intracellular Lys pool was rapidly depleted in association with an increase of uncharged (deacylated) tRNALys from <1 to 64% of available tRNALys. Even in the presence of the essential amino acid His, increasing the levels of uncharged tRNAHis with histidinol, a competitive inhibitor of the histidinyl-tRNA synthetase, blocked FAS expression. Tyrosinol treatment did not alter FAS mRNA levels. These results suggest that essential amino acids regulate FAS expression by altering uncharged tRNA levels, a novel mechanism for nutrient control of gene expression in mammalian cells. Fatty acid synthase (FAS) 1The abbreviations used are: FASfatty acid synthasePBSphosphate-buffered salineMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromideapoBapolipoprotein BPipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. is a large multifunctional protein that synthesizes the fatty acid palmitate from acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and NADPH(1Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. Joshi V.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 537-579Google Scholar). This process is essential for the conversion of dietary calories into a storage form suitable for use during periods of fasting. Although several enzymes are critical for the synthesis of fatty acids, it appears that FAS is rate-limiting in the long term control of lipogenesis(2Volpe J.J. Vagelos P.R. Physiol. Rev. 1976; 56: 339-417Google Scholar). fatty acid synthase phosphate-buffered saline 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide apolipoprotein B 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. Feeding increases FAS expression(3Strauss A.W. Alberts A.W. Hennessy S. Vagelos P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4366-4370Google Scholar). The intake of high carbohydrate diets following periods of fasting increases FAS mRNA levels and enzyme concentration(4Goodridge A.G. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1987; 7: 157-185Google Scholar). Hormones, many of which are affected by feeding and fasting, play a role in this regulation. In diabetic rats, insulin increases hepatic FAS transcription, mRNA levels, and enzyme levels 5-15-fold(5Katsurada A. Iritani N. Fukuda H. Matsumura Y. Nishimoto N. Noguchi T. Tanaka T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 427-433Google Scholar). Dexamethasone enhances FAS mRNA induction by insulin in primary rat hepatocyte cultures(6Fukuda H. Katsurada A. Iritani N. J. Biochem. 1992; 111: 25-30Google Scholar). Triiodothyronine stimulates FAS gene transcription in cultured chick embryo hepatocytes (7Stapleton S.R. Mitchell D.A. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18442-18446Google Scholar) and mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes(8Moustaid N. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18550-18554Google Scholar). Progesterone stabilizes FAS mRNA levels(9Joyeux C. Rochefort H. Chalbos D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 4: 681-686Google Scholar). Hormonal regulation of FAS expression has appropriately been the focus of many previous studies. However, individual dietary components, especially macronutrients, can also affect FAS expression. The carbohydrate glucose stabilizes FAS mRNA levels in HepG2 cells cultured in serum-free media(10Semenkovich C.F. Coleman T. Goforth R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6961-6970Google Scholar, 11Semenkovich C.F. Coleman T. Fiedorek Jr., F.T. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1507-1521Google Scholar). Polyunsaturated fatty acids are potent inhibitors of FAS gene transcription in rats(12Blake W.L. Clarke S.D. J. Nutr. 1991; 120: 1727-1729Google Scholar). But the role of amino acids in FAS regulation is ill-defined. Maximal induction of transcription, mRNA levels, and enzyme activity in fasted rats requires feeding of both carbohydrate and protein(5Katsurada A. Iritani N. Fukuda H. Matsumura Y. Nishimoto N. Noguchi T. Tanaka T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 427-433Google Scholar). In cultured rat hepatocytes, a combination of essential and nonessential amino acids is necessary for maximal induction of FAS protein levels(13Fukuda H. Iritani N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 920: 56-61Google Scholar), but nothing else is known about the effects of individual amino acids on FAS gene expression. An active role for amino acids in gene regulation is not without precedence. Starvation for a single essential amino acid induces differentiation of the human promyelocytic leukemia line HL-60 into mature granulocytes(14Pilz R.B. Van den Berghe G. Boss G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1006-1009Google Scholar). Asparagine synthetase mRNA levels are increased by essential amino acid starvation in baby hamster kidney and HeLa cells(15Gong S.S. Guerrini L. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6059-6066Google Scholar). In yeast, deficiencies of various amino acids will induce the respective amino acid synthetic pathway by activating the transcription factor GCN4(16Hope I.A. Struhl K. Cell. 1985; 43: 177-188Google Scholar). Therefore, we used human HepG2 cells, known to functionally resemble hepatocytes(17Semenkovich C.F. Ostlund Jr., R.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4987-4992Google Scholar), to test the hypothesis that amino acids regulate FAS expression. In this paper, we present data supporting this hypothesis and show that the effect of amino acids is likely mediated by changes in the intracellular concentrations of uncharged tRNA. HepG2 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium prepared by the Washington University Tissue Culture Support Center containing 10% fetal bovine serum purchased from Intergen. Experiments were performed using a modified RPMI 1640 media prepared in our laboratory with Life Technologies, Inc. Select-Amine kits. Amino acid concentrations in the modified RPMI 1640 (see Table 1) were specifically selected to correspond to human serum levels(18Efron M.L. Bixby E.M. Pryles C.V. N Engl. J. Med. 1965; 272: 1299-1309Google Scholar, 19Sarwar G. Botting H.G. Collins M. J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 1991; 10: 668-674Google Scholar). Bovine albumin, actinomycin D, cordycepin, dichlororibofuranosylbenzimidazole, histidinol, and tyrosinol were purchased from Sigma.TABLE I Open table in a new tab For most experiments, cells were split 1:25 from 90% confluent T-75 flasks to 100-mm tissue culture dishes on day 1. On day 3 or 4, cells were fed modified RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 2 or 3 days when the cells were 50-75% confluent, the media were removed, the dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the cells were fed modified RPMI 1640 with 3% bovine serum albumin. Viability was tested using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) in kit form (Sigma). The reagent was sterilely reconstituted in media, and 0.1 ml was added to cluster wells containing 1.0 ml of media. After incubation for 2 h at 37°C, acidified isopropanol was added to dissolve the purple crystals resulting from the cleavage of MTT by mitochondria of living cells. The products were quantitated by determining absorption at 570 nm after subtracting the absorption of blanks generated using media not exposed to cells. RNA was prepared essentially as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi(20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). FAS, apolipoprotein B (apoB), and γ-actin mRNA levels were determined by RNase protection as described previously(11Semenkovich C.F. Coleman T. Fiedorek Jr., F.T. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1507-1521Google Scholar, 21Levy R.A. Ostlund Jr., R.E. Schonfeld G. Wong P. Semenkovich C.F. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1005-1015Google Scholar). Protected fragments were either analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 12% gels followed by autoradiography or collected on filters followed by liquid scintillation counting with the appropriate subtraction of assay blanks containing tRNA instead of HepG2 RNA. For each experiment, cells received serine-deficient medium or medium containing 1.5 μM lysine (100-fold less than complete medium). After 12-15 h, the plates were rinsed with PBS, 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM Pipes (pH 6.8), 100 mM KCl, 300 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100) was added to each dish, and then cells were scraped from the plates on ice and homogenized via Dounce. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were recovered, and protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). Samples were Western blotted by standard techniques using 6% (for FAS blots) or 3-16% gradient gels (for apoB blots). Filters were incubated with rabbit anti-human FAS or anti-apoB antibodies (10Semenkovich C.F. Coleman T. Goforth R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6961-6970Google Scholar) at 1:500-1000 dilutions for 24 h and then with 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody for 12-18 h, followed by washing and exposure to film. Cells were treated with either serine-deficient or lysine-deficient media. 4 h later, nuclei were isolated exactly as described previously (10Semenkovich C.F. Coleman T. Goforth R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6961-6970Google Scholar) and stored at -70°C for up to 4 weeks. Preliminary experiments demonstrated no difference in transcriptional efficiency between nuclei utilized immediately after isolation and those stored for this period of time. Samples from several isolation procedures (representing the nuclei from a total of 120 separate dishes, 60 each for serine-deficient and lysine-deficient conditions) were pooled for each assay prior to in vitro transcription in order to generate sufficient counts for detectable hybridizations. Elongation reactions, previously shown to be inhibited by 2 μg/ml α-amanitin(10Semenkovich C.F. Coleman T. Goforth R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6961-6970Google Scholar), were carried out in several aliquots to maximize the yield of radiolabeled transcripts as described(10Semenkovich C.F. Coleman T. Goforth R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6961-6970Google Scholar). The transcription products were dissolved in hybridization buffer (as in (10Semenkovich C.F. Coleman T. Goforth R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6961-6970Google Scholar) with the addition of 50 μg/ml yeast tRNA) and pooled for each condition. Gel-purified FAS and apoB cDNA inserts as well as linearized pBluescript were denatured and then neutralized(10Semenkovich C.F. Coleman T. Goforth R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6961-6970Google Scholar), and 10 μg of DNA per slot was applied to nitrocellulose filters using a slot blot apparatus. After UV irradiation and prehybridization at 42°C for 12-18 h, filters were hybridized with equal amounts of radiolabeled transcripts (10-35 × 106 cpm) per condition for 48-72 h at 42°C, washed, and exposed to film with intensifying screens for 7 days. Data were quantitated by image processing analysis using ImagePro Plus software. Cells were fed either complete, serine-deficient, or lysine-deficient media as described above. At various time points after feeding, each dish was rinsed twice with cold PBS, 5% trichloroacetic acid solution was added to each dish, and then cells were scraped from the dish and mechanically homogenized by Dounce. After incubation on ice for 1 h to precipitate amino acids, the extract was spun at 3300 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was extracted with cold ether and then vacuum-dried and dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Amino acids were partially purified via passage through a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters). The eluent was vacuum-dried, dissolved in 100 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O:MeOH (70:30), and then norleucine was added as an internal standard. Samples were analyzed using a Beckman model 6300 amino acid analyzer (equipped with System Gold software for instrument control and data reduction), which involves separation of amino acids by ion-exchange chromatography, reaction with ninhydrin, and detection at 570 nm. The method used to determine levels of charged (aminoacylated) tRNA in vivo was modified from a periodate oxidation method described by Vaughn and Hansen(22Vaughan M.H. Hansen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7087-7096Google Scholar). The assay involves isolating tRNA, a fraction of which is charged with an amino acid and a fraction of which is not. One aliquot is oxidized, which prevents any initially uncharged tRNA from subsequently being acylated with an amino acid. Oxidation does not affect the ability of initially charged tRNA to be reacylated in vitro after the attached amino acid is removed because the presence of the amino acid protects the 3′ terminus of the tRNA from damage by periodate. A second aliquot is left unoxidized, allowing the determination of the total charging capacity of tRNA. The percentage of charged tRNA is determined by dividing the counts from in vitro charging reactions (using radiolabeled amino acids) using oxidized samples by the counts from reactions using unoxidized samples. For each experiment, cells were fed complete, serine-deficient, or lysine-deficient media (twenty 100-mm diameter dishes/condition). 2 h later, total RNA was isolated from these cells under mildly acidic conditions and divided into two aliquots for each condition. One aliquot was oxidized with 2 mM sodium periodate at 25°C for 15 min in the dark, and the other was left unoxidized. All samples were ethanol precipitated, washed with 70% ethanol, dissolved in 0.17 M Tris (pH 8.8), incubated for 3 h at 37°C to strip tRNA of bound amino acids, and then again ethanol precipitated. A partially purified aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase preparation suitable for the charging assay was obtained in a procedure modified from that in (23Hansen B.S. Vaughan M.H. Wang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3854-3857Google Scholar). Cells from ten 100-mm diameter dishes were washed with cold PBS, scraped into 15 ml of 0.01 M NaCl, 0.0015 M MgCl2, 0.01 M Tris (pH 7.5), briefly sonicated with a Branson Sonifier 185, and then centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. This supernatant was recovered and applied by batch to DEAE-52 (Whatman) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 EDTA. The extract was rotated for 1 h at 4°C, centrifuged at 900 × g for 5 min; then DEAE-52 was washed with equilibration buffer, and a crude aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase fraction was eluted with equilibration buffer raised to 0.3 M NaCl(23Hansen B.S. Vaughan M.H. Wang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3854-3857Google Scholar). The eluted protein was quantitated with the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). The actual charging assay was performed as follows after preliminary experiments showed these conditions yielded results within the linear response range of the assay. The assay mixture for each sample contained 500 μg of total RNA, 50 μg of partially purified aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, 2.5 mM ATP, 0.25 mM CTP, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 2.5 μCi of 14C-lysine (or 14C-serine), 100 mM unlabeled lysine (or serine) in a total volume of 500 μl. The samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 min, precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid solution containing 1 mg/ml unlabeled lysine (or serine), applied to 2.4-cm filters (Whatman 540), washed twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid and once with 95% ethanol, and then dried. Radioactivity was quantitated with a Beckman LS 2800 scintillation counter. Each assay included blanks consisting of assay mixtures without RNA. The degree of in vivo charged tRNA was calculated by dividing the charging capacity of periodate-oxidized RNA by the charging capacity of unoxidized RNA. The data are expressed in Table 3 as the percentage of uncharged tRNA (determined by subtracting the percentage of charged tRNA from 100).TABLE III Open table in a new tab When HepG2 cells were incubated for 12 h in serum-free experimental media resembling the amino acid composition of human serum (Table 1), the omission of a single essential amino acid, lysine, resulted in lower FAS message levels compared with complete medium as shown by the RNase protection gel depicted in Fig. 1. Omission of histidine, essential in infancy in humans (24Linder M.C. Linder M.C. Nutritional Biochemistry and Metabolism with Clinical Applications. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1991: 87-109Google Scholar), had the same effect, but the omission of serine, a nonessential amino acid, did not affect FAS mRNA levels. These analyses were extended to all 20 amino acids (Fig. 2). HepG2 cells were cultured for 12 h in complete medium and in 20 separate media, each selectively deficient in a single amino acid. Fig. 2 shows the relative levels of FAS (Fig. 2A) and apolipoprotein B (apoB) (Fig. 2B) mRNA expression after incubation in selectively deficient media with data expressed relative to complete medium containing all 20 amino acids. Each one-letter amino acid abbreviation on the horizontal axis of Fig. 2 denotes the amino acid absent from the medium. FAS mRNA levels were unchanged relative to complete medium after 12 h of deficiency in any one of the 10 amino acids on the left half of the panel: alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, or tyrosine. All are nonessential; they can be synthesized from precursors. However, deficiency in any one of the 10 amino acids on the right half of the panel resulted in a ~50% decrease in FAS message level. This group includes the 8 classic essential amino acids: isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine(25Irwin I.M. Hegsted D.M. J. Nutr. 1971; 101: 539-566Google Scholar). Deficiency of arginine or histidine also resulted in lower FAS mRNA. These two amino acids have been shown to be functionally essential in rapidly growing cell lines(26McCoy T.A. Maxwell M. Kruse Jr., P.R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1959; 100: 115-118Google Scholar). The effect appeared to be relatively specific for FAS, because message levels for apoB (B) and γ-actin (data not shown) were unchanged by amino acid deficiency. Omission of a single essential amino acid blocked the time-dependent induction of FAS expression after feeding (Fig. 3). 2-4 hours after feeding complete or serine (nonessential)-deficient media, FAS mRNA levels (Fig. 3A) began to increase and peaked 12-16 h post-feeding. No FAS induction occurred when cells were fed lysine (essential)-deficient medium (Fig. 3A, open circles). No differences in apoB expression were observed after feeding the experimental media (Fig. 3B). Two lines of evidence suggested that decreased cell viability did not explain the effect of lysine-deficiency on FAS expression. First, when cells were cultured for 12 h in lysine-deficient, serine-deficient, or complete media followed by addition of MTT (cleaved by mitochondrial dehydrogenases of living cells), MTT cleavage products (quantitated as described under “Materials and Methods”) in each of the three media were virtually identical (data not shown). Second, the inhibition of FAS mRNA induction by essential amino acid deficiency was reversible (Fig. 4). Cells incubated in lysine-deficient medium from 0-12 h showed no increase in FAS mRNA, but replacing lysine-deficient with complete medium at 12 h resulted in the expected increase in FAS message at 24 h (Fig. 4A, inverted triangles). ApoB expression was again unchanged by incubation in these experimental media (Fig. 4B). The effect of the essential amino acid lysine on FAS expression was concentration-dependent (Fig. 5). HepG2 cells were incubated for 12 h in different concentrations of lysine from 0-300 μM(18Efron M.L. Bixby E.M. Pryles C.V. N Engl. J. Med. 1965; 272: 1299-1309Google Scholar). FAS expression increased linearly over this physiologic range, reaching a peak at approximately 150 μM lysine. ApoB mRNA levels were unaffected by lysine concentration. To determine if the regulation of FAS mRNA by essential amino acids is reflected at the protein level, FAS mass was assayed by Western blotting (Fig. 6). Obviously, cells deprived of an essential amino acid will be unable to synthesize proteins containing that amino acid. So instead of lysine-deficient medium, cells were cultured in medium containing 1.5 μM lysine, a low concentration empirically found to be sufficient for protein synthesis. Fig. 6 shows Western blots of FAS and apoB protein after incubation in serine-deficient and 1.5 μM lysine medium for 12 h, longer than the half-life of the FAS protein in HepG2 cells(10Semenkovich C.F. Coleman T. Goforth R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6961-6970Google Scholar). ApoB is a suitable control protein for this experiment because it is extremely short-lived(27Furukawa S. Sakata N. Ginsberg H.N. Dixon J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22630-22638Google Scholar). FAS protein mass was strikingly lower in the 1.5 μM lysine medium whereas apoB protein was not, confirming that the cells had sufficient lysine for protein synthesis. In fact, apoB protein levels were higher in the low lysine medium, consistent with previous studies showing that incubation of HepG2 cells in low concentrations of amino acids increases apoB synthesis(28Zhang Z. Sniderman A.D. Kalant D. Vu H. Monge J.C. Tao Y Cianflone K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26920-26926Google Scholar). For both FAS and apoB protein, mass was the same in complete and serine-deficient media (not shown). These results suggest that changes in FAS message levels induced by changes in essential amino acid concentrations can be reflected at the level of the FAS protein. To address the possibility of transcriptional regulation of FAS expression by essential amino acids, cells were cultured for 4 h in complete, serine-deficient, or lysine-deficient medium in the presence of the transcriptional inhibitors actinomycin D, cordycepin, and dichlororibofuranosylbenzimidazole. Although these compounds inhibit transcription by different mechanisms, each mimicked the effect of essential amino acid deficiency on FAS message levels (Fig. 7). In the same cells, there were no differences in apoB mRNA levels between cells cultured in complete, serine-deficient, or lysine-deficient medium in the absence of transcriptional inhibitors, and there were no differences in apoB mRNA levels between cells cultured in the different media in the presence of transcriptional inhibitors (data not shown). These results suggest that essential amino acid regulation of FAS is transcriptional. Nuclear run-off assays provided more direct evidence of transcriptional regulation. As shown in Table 2, there was no detectable initiation of FAS transcription after 4 h of incubation in lysine-deficient medium. ApoB transcription also decreased under these conditions but to a lesser extent than FAS. Unlike FAS, the decrease in apoB transcription was not associated with changes in apoB message levels (see FIGURE 2:, FIGURE 3:).TABLE II Open table in a new tab To explore how deficiency of a single essential amino acid might affect FAS transcription, the role of uncharged or deacylated transfer RNA (tRNA not bound to its cognate amino acid) was studied. Uncharged tRNA is known to regulate transcription in bacteria(29Grundy F.J. Henkin T.M. Cell. 1993; 74: 475-482Google Scholar). One way to alter uncharged tRNA levels is to change intracellular amino acid concentrations(30Allen R.E. Raines P.L. Regen D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 190: 323-336Google Scholar). If amino acids alter uncharged tRNA levels to regulate FAS expression, the effect must be rapid. Message levels increase within 2-4 h of feeding (Fig. 3), and substantial changes in amino acid pool sizes should precede this increase. As shown in Fig. 8, feeding lysine-deficient medium depleted intracellular lysine pools within 1 h (Fig. 3A). In contrast, there was no decrease in intracellular serine pools (Fig. 3B) after incubation in serine-deficient medium, an expected result because cells readily synthesize this amino acid. To determine if the decrease in intracellular lysine affects uncharged tRNA levels in HepG2 cells, the amount of uncharged tRNA was assayed by a periodate oxidation method described under “Materials and Methods.” 2 h after feeding lysine-deficient medium, 64% of available tRNALys was uncharged as shown in Table 3. At the same time point, the uncharged fraction accounted for less than 1% of available tRNALys in cells fed complete or serine-deficient medium. As expected, the percentage of uncharged tRNASer did not increase in serine-deficient medium. Uncharged tRNASer levels in complete medium were substantially higher than those of uncharged tRNALys but similar to uncharged tRNASer levels reported in Escherichia coli(31Yegian C.D. Stent G.S. Martin E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 839-846Google Scholar). If uncharged tRNAs for essential amino acids regulate FAS expression, then inhibiting the charging reaction for an essential amino acid, even in the presence of normal concentrations of that nutrient, should mimic the effect of essential amino acid deficiency. Amino acid alcohols are competitive inhibitors of the specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that facilitate the binding of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs(23Hansen B.S. Vaughan M.H. Wang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3854-3857Google Scholar, 32Calender R. Berg P. Cantoni G.L. Davies D.R. Procedures in Nucleic Acid Research. 1. Harper & Row, New York1966: 384Google Scholar). Compounds such as histidinol (the alcohol of the essential amino acid histidine) and tyrosinol (the alcohol of the nonessential amino acid tyrosine) increase uncharged tRNAHis and tRNATyr, respectively, even at normal amino acid concentrations. As shown in Fig. 9A, culturing HepG2 cells for 12 h in complete medium with 2 mM histidinol had the same effect on FAS expression as histidine-deficient medium; FAS mRNA levels were unaffected by incubation in complete medium with 2 mM tyrosinol and tyrosine-deficient medium. The effects of histidinol on FAS expression were dose-dependent (data not shown) and these amino acid alcohols did not affect HepG2 viability within the time frame of these experiments. These data support the hypothesis that essential amino acids regulate FAS expression by altering levels of uncharged tRNA. In this paper, we present evidence that essential amino acids in HepG2 cells regulate the expression of a critical enzyme in lipogenesis, fatty acid synthase. Deficiency of a single essential amino acid in serum-free media reversibly blocks the induction of FAS normally associated with feeding, and essential amino acid effects are concentration-dependent. Essential amino acids appear to regulate FAS expression via a transcriptional mechanism mediated through uncharged tRNA. There is precedence for the involvement of amino acids in gene regulation. Global deprivation of amino acids predictably produces a myriad of effects. Removal of all amino acids from the culture medium up-regulates several types of amino acid transporters in the bovine renal epithelial cell line NBL-1(33Plakidou-Dymock S. McGivan J.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 749-755Google Scholar). In primary rat hepatocyte cultures, such amino acid deprivation decreases gene transcription of IGF-I while simultaneously increasing mRNA abundance for one of its binding proteins(34Pao C. Farmer P.K. Begovic S. Villafuerte B.C. Wu G. Robertson D.G. Phillips L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1561-1568Google Scholar, 35Thissen J.-P. Pucilowska J.B. Underwood L.E. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1570-1576Google Scholar). Deficiencies of single amino acids also evoke responses. In bacteria, starvation for an individual amino acid typically increases the level of its cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase(29Grundy F.J. Henkin T.M. Cell. 1993; 74: 475-482Google Scholar, 36Nass G. Neidhardt F.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 134: 347-359Google Scholar). Asparagine deprivation increases expression of asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase in baby hamster kidney and HeLa cells(15Gong S.S.

Amino acid synthetic pathways are induced in yeast by deficiency of the respective amino acid(16Hope I.A. Struhl K. Cell. 1985; 43: 177-188Google Scholar). Deficiency of a single essential amino acid induces differentiation of the human promyelocytic leukemia line HL-60 into mature granulocytes(14Pilz R.B. Van den Berghe G. Boss G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1006-1009Google Scholar). This effect is mimicked by treatment with the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitor histidinol (also used in the current study, see Fig. 9), suggesting an important role for tRNA during HL-60 differentiation. The tRNA molecule carries out the adapter function necessary for translation of the genetic code from nucleic acid to protein. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (37Saks M.E. Sampson J.R. Abelson J.N. Science. 1994; 263: 191-197Google Scholar, 38Biou V. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S. Science. 1994; 263: 1404-1410Google Scholar, 39Belrhali H. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Larsen K. Berthet-Colominas C.

Science. 1994; 263: 1432-1436Google Scholar) catalyze the aminoacylation of tRNAs with the correct amino acids. tRNA is not simply a passive conduit in this reaction. Each tRNA contains sequence, independent of the anticodon trinucleotide, and structure information targeting it to the appropriate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase(40Schimmel P. Ribas de Pouplana L. Cell. 1995; 81: 983-986Google Scholar). The tRNA itself can also signal amino acid availability through its covalent modification by amino acids(41Persson B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1011-1016Google Scholar). Uncharged tRNA (tRNA not bound to its cognate amino acid) increases when the intracellular pool of that amino acid falls(30Allen R.E. Raines P.L. Regen D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 190: 323-336Google Scholar). This species can regulate gene expression in some systems. In addition to the induction of HL-60 differentiation discussed above (14Pilz R.B. Van den Berghe G. Boss G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1006-1009Google Scholar), uncharged tRNA is involved in transcriptional regulation of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes in Bacillus subtilis(29Grundy F.J. Henkin T.M. Cell. 1993; 74: 475-482Google Scholar). In this system, uncharged tRNATyr likely has a conformation that stabilizes an antiterminator structure allowing transcription of the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase gene. Thus when Tyr levels are low in this bacteria, uncharged tRNATyr signals the increased expression of the enzyme that attaches Tyr to its tRNA resulting in more efficient utilization of the remaining low levels of Tyr. Our data suggest that uncharged tRNA is also involved in the regulation of FAS expression. An amino acid itself or a related factor could be responsible, but the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase inhibition studies (Fig. 9) argue otherwise. Even in the presence of histidine, increasing uncharged tRNA levels by inhibiting the histidinyl-tRNA synthetase mimicked the effect of essential amino acid deficiency. Our data further suggest that there are fundamental differences between the tRNAs for essential and nonessential amino acids because increased uncharged tRNAs for nonessential amino acids have no effect on FAS expression. About half of tRNASer (nonessential) molecules were always uncharged (similar to results reported in bacteria) (31Yegian C.D. Stent G.S. Martin E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 839-846Google Scholar) without affecting FAS expression; a similar level of uncharged tRNALys (essential) was associated with inhibition of FAS (Table 3). Increasing uncharged tRNATyr (nonessential) levels with tyrosinol (Fig. 9) did not affect FAS message levels. How might uncharged tRNAs regulate FAS expression? Similar to the antitermination mechanism discussed above, uncharged tRNA may regulate FAS by interacting with the FAS transcriptional apparatus. However, unlike prokaryotes, components of transcription and translation are separated by the nuclear membrane in eukaryotes, and it is unknown if cytoplasmic uncharged tRNAs have access to the nucleus. A second potential mechanism involves tRNA genes as transcriptional repressor elements. Scattered throughout eukaryotic genomes are moderately to highly repeated RNA polymerase III promoters(42Okada N. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1991; 1: 498-504Google Scholar), sequences that include tRNA genes. These may influence RNA polymerase II promoters (43Carlson D.P. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3278-3282Google Scholar, 44Tomilin N.V. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 69-72Google Scholar) to affect mRNA levels. At least 1300 tRNA genes and pseudogenes are scattered throughout the human genome(45Hatlen L. Attardi G. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 56: 535-553Google Scholar), but their locations are largely unknown. If a tRNA gene or pseudogene exists near the human FAS gene, activation of this locus in response to decreased levels of essential amino acids could influence transcription of the nearby FAS gene. Consistent with this mechanism, tRNA genes have been recently shown to act as repressor elements for RNA polymerase II transcription in yeast(46Hull M.W. Erickson J. Johnston M. Engelke D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1266-1277Google Scholar). A third and perhaps the most likely mechanism underlying uncharged tRNA regulation of FAS expression would involve a transcription factor essential for FAS expression. This transcription factor would be under predominantly translational control; elevated levels of uncharged tRNAs for essential amino acids would inhibit translation of this factor, thereby blocking FAS expression. A similar mechanism is responsible for the activation of the transcription factor GCN4 in yeast after amino acid starvation(16Hope I.A. Struhl K. Cell. 1985; 43: 177-188Google Scholar). Uncharged tRNA binds and activates a kinase, GCN2, which phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2, which stimulates translation of GCN4(47Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Google Scholar, 48Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Jackson B.M. Freeman B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5801-5815Google Scholar, 49Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Google Scholar). We speculate that uncharged tRNAs for essential amino acids interact with translational components in the cytoplasm to block translation of a critical FAS transcription factor and prevent FAS induction with feeding. In summary, depriving HepG2 cells of any essential amino acid prevents the induction of FAS expression normally associated with feeding. The likely role of tRNA in this process represents a novel form of gene regulation in mammalian cells. Obvious next steps include the overexpression of authentic uncharged transfer RNAs for essential amino acids in hepatocytes, and an appropriate search for tRNA response elements in the FAS gene.

https://openalex.org/W1983457088,"Crystallographic analysis and site-directed mutagenesis have been used to identify the catalytic and oligosaccharide recognition residues of peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase F (PNGase F), an amidohydrolase that removes intact asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chains from glycoproteins and glycopeptides. Mutagenesis has shown that three acidic residues, Asp-60, Glu-206, and Glu-118, that are located in a cleft at the interface between the two domains of the protein are essential for activity. The D60N mutant has no detectable activity, while E206Q and E118Q have less than 0.01 and 0.1% of the wild-type activity, respectively. Crystallographic analysis, at 2.0-Å resolution, of the complex of the wild-type enzyme with the product, N,N′-diacetylchitobiose, shows that Asp-60 is in direct contact with the substrate at the cleavage site, while Glu-206 makes contact through a bridging water molecule. This indicates that Asp-60 is the primary catalytic residue, while Glu-206 probably is important for stabilization of reaction intermediates. Glu-118 forms a hydrogen bond with O6 of the second N-acetylglucosamine residue of the substrate and the low activity of the E118Q mutant results from its reduced ability to bind the oligosaccharide. This analysis also suggests that the mechanism of action of PNGase F differs from those of L-asparaginase and glycosylasparaginase, which involve a threonine residue as the nucleophile.

Y., Brasseur, G., Brivet-Chevillotte, P., and Colson, A. M.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 4221-4226). These mutations are located in the center N domain (QN).All the revertants exhibited a modified heme b562 maximum, confirming that part of the NH2-terminal region is in the vicinity of the extramembranous loop between helices IV-V and heme b562. Based on measurements performed on the maximal activities occurring in each segment of the respiratory chain, the decrease observed in the NADH oxidase activities of several revertants was correlated with some bc1 complex activity impairments; this may also explain why a moderate decrease in bc1 complex activity does not limit the succinate oxidase activity. The decrease in the rate of reduction of cytochrome b via the center N pathway is responsible for the impairment of the bc1 complex activity of these revertants.The three double-mutated revertants (S206L/N208K or -Y; S206L/W30C) are temperature-sensitive in vivo, and their mitochondria like that of the original mutant S206L are thermosensitive in vitro. Isolating the W30C mutation does not yield a thermosensitive phenotype: the replacement of serine 206 by leucine is therefore responsible for the thermoinstability of these strains; this temperature sensitivity is reinforced by additional mutations N208K or N208Y, and not by W30C. These data suggest that serine 206 and asparagine 208 are involved in the thermostability of the protein.When bc1 complex activity is lost after incubating mitochondria at a nonpermissive temperature (37°C), heme b is still present, but can no longer be reduced by physiological substrate. The progressive loss of bc1 complex activity seems to be initially linked to a change in the tertiary structure of cytochrome b, which occurs drastically at center N and much more slowly at center P, as shown by kinetic study on the two cytochrome b redox pathways. Seven new structures of cytochrome b have been recently identified by isolating and sequencing revertants from cytochrome b respiratory deficient mutants (Coppée, J. Y., Brasseur, G., Brivet-Chevillotte, P., and Colson, A. M.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 4221-4226). These mutations are located in the center N domain (QN).

The progressive loss of bc1 complex activity seems to be initially linked to a change in the tertiary structure of cytochrome b, which occurs drastically at center N and much more slowly at center P, as shown by kinetic study on the two cytochrome b redox pathways. The cytochrome bc1 complex is an integral multisubunit membrane enzyme that spans either the inner mitochondrial membrane or the plasma membrane of bacteria. It transfers electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, and this electron transfer is linked to proton translocation across the membrane. This mechanism is best described by the Q-cycle model introduced by Mitchell (1Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Google Scholar) and recently reviewed by Brandt and Trumpower(2Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Google Scholar). This mechanism requires two distinct quinone reaction sites, the hydroquinone oxidation (QP) and the quinone reduction (QN) centers, which are located on opposite sides of the membrane, and linked to cytochrome b565 (bL) and b562 (bH) heme, respectively. The bis-heme cytochrome b therefore plays a central role, since it is responsible for the electrogenic electron transfer through the membrane. An eight-transmembrane α helix folding model accounts for the topological organization and heme arrangement (3Rao J.K. Argos P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 896: 197-205Google Scholar, 4Crofts A.

Chem. 1988; 263: 12571-12575Google Scholar). Upon comparing about 800 cytochrome b mitochondrial sequences, Degli Esposti et al.(6Degli Espoti M. de Vries S. Crimi M. Ghelli A. Patarnéllo T. Meyer A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 243-271Google Scholar) found only 9 invariant amino acids, and this number was not affected by adding bacterial sequences. Upon examining the most highly conserved amino-acids among 900 sequences, including the four histidine ligands to the hemes, Brandt and Trumpower (2Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Google Scholar) pointed out that 10 are located at center N and 14 at center P. These well conserved amino acids are natural targets for site-directed mutagenesis, which has been successfully carried out on bacteria (7-14; for review, see (15Gennis R.B. Barquera B. Hacker B. van Doren S.R. Arnaud S. Crofts A.R. Davidson E. Gray K.A. Daldal F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 195-209Google Scholar)). In some cases however, inducing mutation of invariant amino acids did not impair the function (11Yun C.H. Wang Z.G. Crofts A.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol.

Acta. 1992; 1101: 162-165Google Scholar) and only a few of the evolutionary conserved residues chosen as targets seem to be essential for the functioning of the bc1 complex. In eucaryotes, cytochrome b is the only subunit of the bc1 complex which is encoded by the mitochondrial genome, while all other subunits (nine in yeast) are of nuclear origin: this means that an eucaryotic organism is not the most suitable for performing site-directed mutagenesis on cytochrome b. This obstacle can be circumvented by selecting respiratory growth-deficient mutants of cytochrome b(16Lemesle-Meunier D. Brivet-Chevillotte P. di Rago J.P. Slonimski P.P. Bruel C. Tron T. Forget N.

Pâques F. Risler J.-L. Netter P. Slonimski P.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 804-811Google Scholar), which has yielded many interesting phenotypes and led to identifying structurally and/or functionally implicated residues without any preconceived notions as to which amino acids will be involved. Our previous paper (20Coppée J.Y. Brasseur G. Brivet-Chevillotte P. Colson A.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4221-4226Google Scholar) has described the isolation of non-native intragenic revertants selected from two cytochrome b respiratory deficient mutants located at the center N domain, namely mutant S206L and frameshift 204. Serine 206 is not an invariant residue, but replacing it by leucine would be lethal in the context of a strictly aerobic organism. These revertants have pseudo-wild type phenotypes, showing discrete but significant differences from the wild type, especially in the case of those which are thermosensitive (they do not grow at 37°C with respiratory substrate as carbon source). The aim of this study was to specify the role of the amino acids involved in these modifications and to determine the structure-function relationships of the cytochrome b center N domain, in particular as regards the bc1 complex activity and its thermal stability. The wild type strain and the original mutants were from the Gif collection. Parental strain (wild type box+): the diploid KM91 was obtained by crossing 777-3A α ade1 op1 rho+mit+ with KL14-4A a his1 trp2 OP1 rho0.

These were as described previously(24Meunier-Lemesle D. Chevillotte-Brivet P. Pajot P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 151-159Google Scholar, 25Chevillotte-Brivet P. Meunier-Lemesle D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 161-169Google Scholar). Cells were grown with galactose medium (2% yeast extract, 1% bactopeptone, 2% galactose, 0.1% glucose, 1.2 g/liter of ammonium sulfate). Mitochondria were extracted from cells in the early stationary phase of growth. Growth yield and specific growth rate with ethanol medium were determined as described by Coppée et al.(20Coppée J.Y. Brasseur G. Brivet-Chevillotte P. Colson A.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4221-4226Google Scholar). In vitro RC and phosphate to oxygen ratios, as defined by Chance and Williams(26Chance B. Williams G.R. Adv. Enzymol. 1956; 17: 65-98Google Scholar), were determined polarographically with a Gilson oxygraph. The following buffers were used: MR3 buffer (0.65 M sorbitol, 10 mM KH2PO4, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM MgCl2, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, pH 6.5) and phosphate buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate, 50 μM EDTA, pH 7.4). Low temperature spectra were recorded at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K); heme b562 was obtained by difference spectra of succinate-reduced minus ascorbate-reduced mitochondria.

The activity of segment I of the respiratory chain (NADH-decylubiquinone-reductase activity) was measured by NADH oxidation monitored at the 340/425-nm wavelength pair with DB as quinone electron acceptor. Complex II activity (succinate-decylubiquinone-reductase) was measured by DB reduction at 280/325 nm with succinate as electron donor. Complex IV activity (cytochrome c-oxidase) was measured as described previously, with a Gilson oxygraph(27Chevillotte-Brivet P. Salou G. Forget N. Meunier-Lemesle D.

Reactions were followed at 562/575 nm with the dual wavelength spectrophotometer DW2A Aminco Chance using the rapidly stirred reaction cuvette procedure; NADH was used as electron donor, because it is a better substrate for mitochondrial cytochrome b reduction, especially through center N, than DBH2. Antimycin (20 μM) and myxothiazol (40 μM) were used at saturating level in order to observe the center P and center N kinetic reduction pathways, respectively. Reactions were also monitored with the rapidly stirred reaction cuvette procedure at 562/575 nm. DB was used as electron acceptor after heme b562 has been entirely reduced with endogenous substrate in the presence of KCN. Myxothiazol (40 μM) was added at saturating level to prevent reduction by the center P pathway. SDS-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) was performed using 10-14% acrylamide gels as in the Laemmli's method (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) modified with Tricine running buffer (100 mM Tris, 100 mM Tricine, 1% SDS, pH 8.3). Immunoblotting was carried out as described previously (29Chevillotte-Brivet P. Salou G. Meunier-Lemesle D. Curr. Genet. 1987; 12: 111-117Google Scholar) using a polyclonal antibody raised against purified wild type bc1 complex. This antibody mainly cross-reacted with the two core proteins, the iron sulfer protein and the subunit 8 of the bc1 complex. The purified cytochrome bc1 complex was prepared as described by Chevillotte-Brivet et al.(27Chevillotte-Brivet P. Salou G. Forget N. Meunier-Lemesle D. Biochimie (Paris). 1987; 69: 25-36Google Scholar). Non-native intragenic revertants have been selected (20Coppée J.Y. Brasseur G. Brivet-Chevillotte P. Colson A.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4221-4226Google Scholar) from two respiratory deficient mutants of cytochrome b gene which are unable to grow on respiratory substrates (ethanol or glycerol). As recently described(16Lemesle-Meunier D. Brivet-Chevillotte P. di Rago J.P. Slonimski P.P. Bruel C. Tron T. Forget N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15626-15632Google Scholar), the mis sense mutant S206L is well assembled, synthesizes reducible cytochrome b, and retains a partial electron transfer activity. The frameshift 204 mutant synthesizes a truncated apocytochrome b without any heme. Immunoblot analysis of mitochondria isolated from this mutant and from the wild type strain with polyclonal antibodies raised against the isolated bc1 complex showed that the assembly of the complex is affected with the frameshift mutant; in particular, a loss of core protein I was observed together with that of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (Fig. 1). Together with the complete absence of the mature FeS protein in this mutant, a band of higher molecular weight is detected (Fig. 1, lane 2) which is not present with the bc1 complex and the wild type mitochondria and might be the premature FeS protein; this would mean that the Rieske iron-sulfur protein is synthesized and imported into the mitochondria with the frameshift mutant, but due to the cytochrome b mutation leading to an absence of apoprotein and heme of this cytochrome, the FeS protein is not matured and not assembled into the bc1 complex. When grown at 28°C, the revertants isolated from the two cytochrome b respiratory deficient mutants S206L and frameshift 204 exhibited phenotypes which were almost similar to that of the parental strain (box+). In particular, these revertants had identical growth yields on galactose and ethanol as substrates, while the two original mutants did not grow at all on respiratory substrate(20Coppée J.Y. Brasseur G. Brivet-Chevillotte P. Colson A.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4221-4226Google Scholar). From these data, the phosphorylation efficiencies in vivo were deduced with the revertants grown on ethanol, which were found to be identical to that of the wild type (±5%), as summarized in Table 1. This identity was confirmed by directly measuring the coupling characteristics using the polarographic method (with ethanol as substrate) on the mitochondria isolated from these strains. The phosphate to oxygen ratios (moles of ATP synthesized from added ADP/atom of consumed oxygen) were between 1 and 2 (Table 1), as expected with the yeast S. cerevisiae, which has only two phosphorylation sites(30Ohnishi T. FEBS Lett. 1972; 24: 305-309Google Scholar).TABLE I Open table in a new tab At this growth temperature of 28°C, only differences in the doubling time of some revertants were observed when cells were grown on respiratory substrates such as ethanol (Table 1). Moreover, three revertants exhibiting these significantly modified doubling times also turned out to be thermosensitive strains, because they did not grow on ethanol at 37°C (Table 1). The increase in the doubling time of the three double-mutated revertants might reflect some changes in the kinetic parameters of these mutants, which were tentatively investigated in this study. NADH and succinate oxidase activities have been measured in the various strains, and the results are given in Table 2. The NADH oxidase activity decreased in the three double-mutated revertants isolated from the original mutant S206L, while the succinate oxidase activity remained similar to that of the wild type in all the revertant strains. With the two respiratory deficient mutants, these two activities either decreased considerably (S206L) or were practically abolished (frameshift 204).TABLE II Open table in a new tab With a view to explaining the discrepancy between the decrease in the NADH oxidase and the stability of succinate oxidase activities with some revertants, the maximal activities of each of the four segments of the respiratory chain were investigated in the wild type strain, the revertants, and the two original mutants which exhibited nil specific growth rate on ethanol(20Coppée J.Y. Brasseur G. Brivet-Chevillotte P. Colson A.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4221-4226Google Scholar). In each trial, the cytochrome b and aa3 contents of the strain were determined as previously (20Coppée J.Y. Brasseur G. Brivet-Chevillotte P. Colson A.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4221-4226Google Scholar) and used to express the change in the specific activity at the complex III and IV level (turnover). As shown in Table 2, point modifications in cytochrome b gene in the respiratory deficient mutants lead to a drastic decrease not only in complex III activity but also in complex II and IV activities in the case of S206L and frameshift 204 mutants. The situation is quite different with the revertants isolated from these two box mutants (Table 2), since complex II shows no change as compared with the wild type value. In all the cases studied, NADH-DB activity (segment I) remained stable (±10%), as did the complex IV activity. With the three thermosensitive double mutants isolated from S206L, the only significant variation was that observed at the complex III level, which decreased by 30-40% in comparison with the wild type value (box+), while S206T and S206V revertants recovered activities similar to that of the wild type strain (Table 2). These variations observed at the complex III level were correlated with, and were probably mainly responsible for, those recorded in the NADH oxidase activity. The maximum activity values measured in each segment of the respiratory chain (Table 2) provide a means of accounting for the differences observed between the unmodified succinate and the decrease in the NADH oxidase activities of the revertants exhibiting a decrease in complex bc1 activity. Assuming that the excess ubiquinone is a mobile carrier linking dehydrogenases with cytochrome chains, Kröger and Klingenberg (31Kröger A. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 358-368Google Scholar) described the overall oxidase activity (V) as follows. V=V1×V2V1+V2(Eq. 1) V1 (or Vred) was defined as the maximum velocity of the ubiquinone-reducing system and V2 (or Vox) as the maximum velocity of the ubiquinol-oxidizing system. A similar formulation has been described based on the enzymatic kinetic formalism, taking into account the measured concentration of endogenous quinones in the chain (in excess as in the above Q-pool hypothesis) and the presence of excess oxidant(32Meunier D. Chevillotte-Brivet P. J. Theor. Biol. 1977; 64: 137-163Google Scholar). In, V1 is proportional to the maximum velocity of dehydrogenases, and V2 might be expressed as the maximum rate of the cytochrome chain (bc1 complex if taking V to stand for succinate or NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity, the whole cytochrome chain (CIII + CIV) in the presence of oxygen, taking V to stand for succinate or NADH oxidase activity). If V2r is the modified bc1 complex activity with the revertant and Vr the resulting succinate or NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity, then the relative rate of the revertant (referred to that of the wild type Vwt) can be expressed from, as follows. VrVwt=(1+V1V2)×V2rV2V1V2+V2rV2(Eq. 2) If only complex III activity is modified in revertants, this relative rate will vary hyperbolically with the relative activity V2r/V2 of complex III, and the concavity of the curve will depend on the value of V1/V2 where V1 is the succinate or NADH-ubiquinone reductase maximum activity and V2, the complex III activity in the wild type strain. As it can be deduced from the legend of Table 2, this ratio V1/V2 is lower with succinate than with NADH as substrate. Hence, clearly illustrates the fact that partial loss of bc1 complex activity affects NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity to a greater extend than succinate cytochrome c reductase activity: when the bc1 complex activity is reduced to 50% of the wild type value, the NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity declines to about 60%, while the succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity only declines to 85% of the respective wild type values. The fact that a decrease occurred in the NADH oxidase activity and not in the succinate oxidase activity can therefore be explained in terms of a decrease at the complex III level and the restricted flux occurring in complex II in comparison with those recorded in complexes I and III; complex III is rate-limiting as regards the NADH oxidase but not the succinate-oxidase activity. The respiratory deficient cytochrome b mutant S206L exhibits a specific red shift of heme b562 absorption maximum of 1.5 nm which can be observed in the α and γ bands, at room temperature as well as at liquid nitrogen temperature(16Lemesle-Meunier D. Brivet-Chevillotte P. di Rago J.P. Slonimski P.P. Bruel C. Tron T. Forget N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15626-15632Google Scholar). This shift toward the red (bathochromic effect) may correspond to a decrease in the energy transition barrier of this heme. The frameshift cytochrome b mutant exhibited no cytochrome b heme. Low temperature spectral analysis of the revertants, having a new cytochrome b configuration at center N, has been carried out and the data on the α band maximum of the two hemes are summarized in Table 3. This study showed that the heme b562 maximum has intermediate positions between that of the original mutant S206L (561 nm) and that of the wild type strain (559.5 nm) (Table 3). Reversions S206T and S206V in the same position 206 than the original mutation (S206L) and mutations in positions 204 and 205 (H204Y and H204S/G205C) induce the greatest shift in the heme b562 absorption maximum (between 560.1 and 560.6 nm, Table 3) as compared with the reversions in position 208 (S206L/N208K, S206L/N208Y) which induce a heme b562 absorption maximum at 559.8 nm. It thus emerges that the heme b562 characteristics might be affected by changes in environmental amino acids other than the pair of histidines 96 and 197 which coordinate the heme, whether the cytochrome b resulting from the new conformation is functional (revertants) or practically not (mutant S206L). This also confirms the proximity of position 30 to heme b562 in the tertiary cytochrome b structure. The heme b565 was not modified in any of the strains tested, which is in agreement with the localization of this heme on the positive side of the inner mitochondrial membrane (center P).TABLE III Open table in a new tab The growth of three double-mutated revertants on respiratory substrates such as ethanol or glycerol is abolished at 37°C (Table 1): these thermosensitive strains have the original mutation S206L together with the proximal mutation N208K or N208Y or with the distal mutation W30C located on the NH2-terminal part of the protein. In order to test the phenotype arising from the reverse mutation alone in the revertant S206L/W30C, a recombinant strain carrying the wild type serine in position 206 and the mutated codon in position 30 was obtained(20Coppée J.Y. Brasseur G. Brivet-Chevillotte P. Colson A.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4221-4226Google Scholar). This strain carrying only the mutation W30C grows at 37°C on nonfermentable substrate such as the parental strain. Similarly, the other two revertants, S206V and S206T, as well as the revertants from the original frameshift cytochrome b-deficient mutant in position 204, namely H204Y and H204S/G205C, are also nonthermosensitive strains. It therefore seems likely that the replacement of serine 206 by leucine might confer thermosensitivity on the cells. However, since mutant S206L is respiratory growth-deficient and is unable to grow on non fermentable carbon sources at any temperature, it is impossible to determine whether or not it may be thermosensitive in vivo. Mitochondria were isolated from the parental strain (box+) and the original mutant S206L and its revertants grown at permissive temperature (28°C) on galactose medium. Under these conditions, the revertants synthesized cytochrome b contents in proportion quasi-identical to that of the wild type strain (about 90%) and exhibited an appreciable level of bc1 complex activity; the respiratory growth-deficient mutant S206L was found to synthesize less cytochrome b (44%) and to still show a low bc1 complex activity (Table 2). To determine whether the activity of the bc1 complex is affected by the temperature when the cells are grown at the permissive temperature (28°C), under the conditions where the complex is well folded and assembled, the DBH2-cytochrome c reductase activity was measured as a function of the incubation time at nonpermissive temperature (37°C). As shown in Fig. 2, the in vitro bc1 complex activity of the wild type box+ and of the nonthermosensitive revertants (exemplified by S206V) were quite stable. The three in vivo thermosensitive revertants, as well as the original mutant S206L, are liable to be inactivated at high temperature (Fig. 2): this inactivation is particularly fast with the proximal revertant S206L/N208K, which loses half of its bc1 complex activity after exposure of its mitochondria at 37°C for only 1 h (t50) and which is completely devoid of bc1 complex activity after 4 h. The distal revertant S206L/W30C, which exhibits a t50 of about 4 h, is the least severely disturbed thermosensitive strain. The behavior of the isolated mutation W30C was also tested after incubating mitochondria at 37°C, and the activity was found to be as stable as that of the parental strain, in line with the results obtained in the in vivo growth study. Control experiments were carried out in which mitochondria isolated from thermosensitive and nonthermosensitive strains were incubated at 0°C and at the permissive temperature 25°C for several hours: no significant decrease in the bc1 complex activity was observed. With all the revertants, the temperature sensitivity in vitro at the bc1 complex level was found to be correlated with that observed in vivo. This thermoinactivation of bc1 complex activity is an irreversible phenomenon: the decrease in"
https://openalex.org/W1972979168,"A dysfibrinogenemia was attributable to a single amino acid substitution from glycine to cysteine at residue 15 of the Bβ chain in a fibrinogen molecule designated as fibrinogen Fukuoka II. The fibrinogen Fukuoka II showed prolonged thrombin and reptilase times and impaired fibrinopeptide B release by thrombin, resulting in abolition of fibrin monomer repolymerization under physiological conditions. Repolymerization of the des-(Bβ 1-42)-fibrin monomers, however, was not distinguished from the normal pattern of des-(Bβ 1-42)-fibrin monomers, suggesting that no other abnormality existed in fibrinogen Fukuoka II. Although an additional cysteine was substituted at residue 15 of the Bβ chain, fibrinogen Fukuoka II had no free sulfhydryl group within the molecule. Instead, fibrinogen Fukuoka II formed a disulfide bond with cysteine, albumin, another mutated Bβ chain within the same molecule, or intermolecular dimeric fibrinogen Fukuoka II. The mutation in fibrinogen Fukuoka II was the same as that in fibrinogen Ise published previously (Yoshida, N., Wada, H., Morita, K., Hirata, H., Matsuda, M., Yamazumi, K., Asakura, S., and Shirakawa, S.(1991) Blood 77, 1958-1963). Fibrinogen Ise, however, has been described as having prolonged thrombin time but normal reptilase time. Reasons for the discrepancy were not clear. Analysis of the Bβ 1-42 fragment showed that fibrinogen was heterogeneous at position 31 of the Bβ chain with respect to proline or hydroxyproline.

Analysis of the Bβ 1-42 fragment showed that fibrinogen was heterogeneous at position 31 of the Bβ chain with respect to proline or hydroxyproline. Fibrinogen molecules contain two copies each of three different polypeptide chains that are designated as Aα, Bβ, and γ. During clotting, the Aα chain is cleaved by thrombin at position 16 to produce peptide A (fibrinopeptide A, FPA) (1)The abbreviations used are: FPAfibrinopeptide AFPBfibrinopeptide BTBSTris-buffered salineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and the α chain. Similarly, the Bβ chain is cleaved at position 14 to produce peptide B (fibrinopeptide B, FPB) and the β chain. These cleavages and the resulting dissociation of the small peptides FPA and FPB from the molecule convert fibrinogen to fibrin(1Henschen A. Lottspeich F. Kehl M. Southan C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 408: 28-43Google Scholar, 2Doolittle R.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 195-229Google Scholar). The six peptide chains in fibrinogen are held together by 29 disulfide bonds(1Henschen A. Lottspeich F. Kehl M. Southan C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 408: 28-43Google Scholar), and interchain disulfide bonds have important roles in the assembly and secretion of fibrinogen molecules during its biosynthesis(3Yu S. Sher B. Kudryk B.

After thrombin cleavage of fibrinogen, many disulfide cross-linked, six-chain fibrin molecules assemble into large polymers. Immediately after assembly these noncovalent intermolecular complexes or polymers (fibrin clots) can be dissociated into the individual fibrin molecules in acetic acid, which are designated as fibrin monomers. Congenital abnormalities of fibrinogen molecules have been reported as dysfibrinogenemia(5Ebert R.F. Ebert R.F. Index of Variant Human Fibrinogens.

Dysfibrinogenemia with prolonged thrombin and reptilase times has been attributed to the impaired release of FPB from abnormal fibrinogen molecules by thrombin due to this Arg to Cys substitution. Fibrinogen with a deletion of the Bβ 9-72 region, fibrinogen New York I, also shows the prolonged thrombin and reptilase times(15Al-Mondhiry H.A.B. Bilezikian S.B. Nossel H.L. Blood. 1975; 45: 607-619Google Scholar, 16Liu C.Y. Koehn J.A. Morgan F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4390-4396Google Scholar). However, fibrinogen Ise, an abnormal fibrinogen with a substitution of Gly to Cys at residue 15 of the Bβ chain shows a prolonged thrombin time but a normal reptilase time, although the release of FPB is strongly impaired(17Yoshida N. Wada H. Morita K. Hirata H. Matsuda M. Yamazumi K. Asakura S. Shirakawa S. Blood. 1991; 77: 1958-1963Google Scholar). Thus, participation of the FPB release with polymerization of fibrin monomers in detail are still controversial. In the present communication, we report an abnormal fibrinogen designated as fibrinogen Fukuoka II with a substitution of Gly to Cys at residue 15 of the Bβ chain, which is the same mutation as described for fibrinogen Ise. As shown for fibrinogen Ise(17Yoshida N. Wada H. Morita K. Hirata H. Matsuda M. Yamazumi K. Asakura S. Shirakawa S. Blood. 1991; 77: 1958-1963Google Scholar), the Bβ chain of fibrinogen Fukuoka II was resistant to a low concentration of thrombin and clotting time with thrombin was prolonged. Unlike fibrinogen Ise, however, fibrinogen Fukuoka II showed a prolonged reptilase time and formed a disulfide complex with cysteine or albumin, an intramolecular disulfide bond formation, or an interchain disulfide bond with another fibrinogen Fukuoka II molecule at the mutated Cys residue.

Platelet-depleted plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Samples were divided into aliquots and stored at -80°C until use. Fibrinogen concentrations in plasma were determined by the thrombin time method of Clauss (19Clauss A. Acta Haematol. 1957; 17: 237-246Google Scholar) and by single radial immunodiffusion using chicken anti-human fibrinogen antibody. Thrombin and reptilase times were determined according to the method of Matsuda et al.(20Matsuda M. Baba M. Morimoto K. Nakamikawa C. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1034-1041Google Scholar).

Biophys. 1951; 32: 317-324Google Scholar) were 95% and 96%, respectively. Purified fibrinogen in Freund's complete adjuvant was injected subcutaneously into a chicken several times. About 2 months after the first injection, yolk IgG was purified from eggs according to the method of Jensenius et al.(24Jensenius J.C. Andersen I. Hau J. Crone M. Koch C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1981; 46: 63-68Google Scholar). Monospecific anti-fibrinogen antibody was then obtained using purified fibrinogen that had been coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. Fibrinogen (1 mg/ml) was dissolved in TBS containing 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 M NaCl, and 25,000 IU/ml aprotinin and was incubated with bovine thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) or reptilase (2 μg/ml) at 37°C for 1 h. In some experiments, fibrinogen was incubated with a high concentration of thrombin (50 units/ml) at 37°C for 6 h followed by incubating at 4°C for another 12 h. The incubated fibrinogen solutions were boiled for 10 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Fibrinopeptides (FPA and FPB) released into supernatant were analyzed by HPLC on a reversed-phase column of Cosmosil 5C18-P (4.6 × 250 mm) with a linear gradient of 5-20% CH3CN containing 0.025 M ammonium acetate (pH 6.0) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.(25Kehl M. Lottspeich F. Henschen A. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1981; 362: 1661-1664Google Scholar). Fibrin monomer repolymerization was studied essentially as described by Gralnick et al.(26Gralnick H.R. Givelber H.M. Shainoff J.R. Finlayson J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1971; 50: 1819-1830Google Scholar). In brief, fibrinogen (1 mg/ml in TBS) and des-(Bβ 1-42)-fibrinogen (1 mg/ml in 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) were clotted by incubation with bovine thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) or reptilase (2 μg/ml) at 37°C for 2 h. Fibrin clots were collected, washed four times in TBS, and dissolved in 0.02 M acetic acid to a concentration of 2 mg/ml. Repolymerization of fibrin monomers was initiated by diluting an aliquot of this solution into a 25-fold excess of Tris buffers (pH 7.4) with different ionic strength: 0.05 M Tris-HCl (ionic strength, μ = 0.04); 0.05 M Tris-HCl in 0.03 M NaCl (μ = 0.07); 0.05 M Tris-HCl in 0.06 M NaCl (μ = 0.1); 0.05 M Tris-HCl in 0.1 M NaCl (μ = 0.14). Fibrin monomer repolymerization was examined by monitoring increments of absorbance at 350 nm by a spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3210) at room temperature. C. atrox proteinase III was purified from C. atrox venom as described previously(27Pandya B.V. Budzynski A.Z. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 460-470Google Scholar). Fibrinogen (2 mg/ml in TBS containing 5 mM EDTA) was digested with C. atrox proteinase III (1 μg/ml) at 37°C for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 1 mM and des-(Bβ 1-42)-fibrinogen was precipitated by 25% ammonium sulfate. Precipitated des-(Bβ 1-42)-fibrinogen was dissolved in 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), dialyzed against the same buffer, and stored at -80°C until use. C. atrox proteinase III digests of fibrinogen were heated at 56°C for 10 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. An aliquot of Bβ 1-42 fragments was reduced and S-pyridylethylated as described previously(28Kawano Y. Okubo K. Tokunaga F. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Hamasaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8232-8238Google Scholar). Pyridylethylated Bβ 1-42 fragments and the nonreduced fragments were fractionated by HPLC on a reversed-phase column of TSK gel ODS-120T (4.6 × 250 mm) with a linear gradient of 20-30% CH3CN containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Analysis of Bβ 1-42 fragments was done by SDS-PAGE (7-20% acrylamide) (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) under either reducing or nonreducing conditions. Fibrin clots (2 mg/ml) produced by reptilase (2 μg/ml) were dissolved in acetic acid, diluted with 25-fold TBS, and mounted on a glow discharged carbon/formvar-coated grid. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, the samples were negatively stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Electron microscopy was performed using a Joel JEM 2000EX transmission electron microscope (Japan Electron Optics Laboratory Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Fibrinogen Fukuoka II and normal fibrinogen were diluted to 20 μg/ml in TBS containing 50% glycerol, sprayed onto mica discs, and rotary shadowed with carbon platinum at an angle of 3 degrees. The rotary shadowed sample was floated on distilled water, loaded on a glow discharged carbon/formvar-coated grid, and examined by transmission electron microscopy. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood cells according to Hoar(30Hoar D. Can. Fam. Physician. 1987; 33: 401-404Google Scholar). Exon II of the fibrinogen Bβ chain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with a sense primer (5′-TGAGGGAATTCGAATAGTTACATTCC-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-CTTTCTCTAGATGAGAGAGCCACCACT-3′)(31Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction products were inserted into pUC19 plasmid and transfected into competent cells derived from E. coli strain DH5α. Plasmids were isolated from the transformed E. coli by the method of Sambrook et al.(32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.25-1.28Google Scholar). Following alkaline treatment of plasmids, the inserts were sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method(33Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). Total protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al.(34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.I. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed after blotting SDS-PAGE gels to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using the method of Towbin et al.(35Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). Free sulfhydryl groups of fibrinogen were determined using Ellman's procedure(36Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis of Bβ 1-42 fragments was performed using a Picotag system (Waters, Millipore Corp.) according to the method of Heinrikson and Meredith (37Heinrikson R.L. Meredith S.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 65-74Google Scholar). After treatment with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase, Bβ 1-42 fragments were sequenced using a gas phase sequenator (Applied Biosystems, model 476A, Foster, CA), and the phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were identified using an on-line Applied Biosystems 120A phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. A 1-year-old Japanese boy was referred to us for investigation of hypofibrinogenemia. The propositus and his family had no other clinical symptoms, and consanguinity was not found in his pedigree. Coagulation studies on plasma and purified fibrinogen from the propositus and his family are shown in Table 1. In the propositus and his father, the fibrinogen concentration determined by thrombin time assay was much lower than that determined by the immunological assay. The reptilase as well as thrombin clotting times for plasma and purified fibrinogen were also prolonged with or without calcium ions. After digesting fibrinogen molecules of the propositus and his father with a low concentration of thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) at 37°C for 1 h, the release of FPB from fibrinogen was about 50% of that from normal fibrinogen, whereas the release of FPA from the propositus molecule was normal (Fig. 1a). The retarded release of FPB, however, was restored to almost 80% of normal when the molecule was extensively digested with a high concentration of thrombin; under these conditions fibrinogen molecules were cleaved at multiple additional sites in the Aα and Bβ chains (Fig. 1b). Essentially the same results were obtained using fibrinogen from the father of the propositus (data not shown). In subsequent experiments, plasma and purified fibrinogen molecules from the father were used unless otherwise noted. The abnormal fibrinogen in this study is designated hereafter as fibrinogen Fukuoka II. Release of FPA by reptilase instead of thrombin was not different between normal fibrinogen and fibrinogen Fukuoka II (Fig. 1c).TABLE I Open table in a new tab Normal fibrinogen and fibrinogen Fukuoka II were digested with thrombin or reptilase to form fibrin clots, and fibrin monomers were obtained by dissolving the fibrin clots in acetic acid as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In contrast to normal fibrin monomers, Fukuoka II fibrin monomers started to repolymerize after a longer lag time with a decreased maximum rate and a lower ultimate turbidity at physiological ionic strength as well as at low ionic strength (μ = 0.04-0.14) (Fig. 2, a and b). When fibrin monomers obtained with reptilase instead of thrombin were compared, Fukuoka II fibrin monomers also showed a slow maximum rate of repolymerization and a decreased ultimate turbidity at all ionic strengths examined (μ = 0.04-0.14) (Fig. 2, c and d). At physiological ionic strength (μ = 0.14), Fukuoka II fibrin monomers obtained with either thrombin or reptilase were most extensively impaired (Fig. 2, b and d). These observations were consistent with the prolonged thrombin and reptilase times of propositus plasma and purified fibrinogen Fukuoka II. C. atrox proteinase III cleaves the Bβ chain of fibrinogen at the carboxyl side of Arg-42(9Pandya B.V. Cierniewski C.S. Budzynski A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2994-3000Google Scholar). Des-(Bβ 1-42)-fibrinogens prepared from either normal fibrinogen or fibrinogen Fukuoka II by pretreating with C. atrox proteinase III were digested with reptilase to form fibrin clots. Repolymerization of normal des-(Bβ 1-42)-fibrin monomers did not occur at physiological ionic strength but did occur at lower ionic strengths, although the ultimate turbidity was lower than when uncleaved fibrin monomers were used (Fig. 2, c and e). Repolymerization of Fukuoka II des-(Bβ 1-42)-fibrin monomers was identical to normal des-(Bβ 1-42)-fibrin monomers (Fig. 2, e and f), suggesting that the susceptible fibrinogen Fukuoka II structural abnormalities are located within the first 42 residues of the Bβ chain. The ultrastructure of repolymerized fibrin monomers at physiological ionic strength was examined. In repolymerized normal fibrin monomers produced by reptilase, the clot matrix was predominantly composed of thick branching striated fibers with few thin fibrils (Fig. 3a). In contrast to normal fibrin monomers, the clot matrix of fibrin monomers Fukuoka II contained mainly thin fibrils with only a few thick fibers (Fig. 3b). Using genomic DNA from the propositus as well as the father, we amplified exon II of Bβ chain, which codes for amino acids from Bβ 9 to 72, inserted it into a pUC19 plasmid, and sequenced it. As shown in Fig. 4, a single base substitution was found. This mutation changed the codon GGT (Gly) to TGT (Cys) at the 15th residue of Bβ chain. The normal sequence was also observed, indicating that fibrinogen Fukuoka II is heterozygous. Purified fibrinogens from a normal control and the affected individuals were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using nonreducing conditions. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 5a). Normal fibrinogen showed two bands with molecular masses of 340,000 and 300,000 daltons, corresponding to high molecular mass fibrinogen and low molecular mass fibrinogen (38Mosesson M.W. Galanakis D.K. Finlayson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4656-4664Google Scholar) (lane 1 in Fig. 5a). Fibrinogen Fukuoka II contained two additional minor bands with molecular masses of 400,000 and 700,000 daltons as well as several faint bands (lanes 2 and 3 in Fig. 5a). After digesting with C. atrox proteinase III, the des-(Bβ 1-42)-fibrinogen Fukuoka II showed only two bands, which migrated slightly faster than the high or low molecular mass fibrinogen (lane 4 in Fig. 5a). Immunoblot analysis using an anti-fibrinogen antibody showed that the additional slow moving bands as well as the major bands were fibrinogen (lanes 2 and 3 in Fig. 5b) and that these slow moving bands disappeared when des-(Bβ 1-42)-fibrinogen Fukuoka II was formed (lane 4 in Fig. 5b). Immunoblot analysis using anti-albumin antibody showed that the band of high molecular mass at 400,000 daltons contained albumin (lanes 2 and 3 in Fig. 5c). The other band of molecular mass at 700,000 daltons was determined to be a dimer of fibrinogen molecules by eluting the band followed by reanalysis using SDS-PAGE after reducing the sample (data not shown). Thus, the replacement of Gly with Cys at residue 15 of the Bβ chain in fibrinogen Fukuoka II results in the formation of albumin-fibrinogen complexes as well as dimeric fibrinogen complexes through a disulfide bond involving the mutated Cys residue. The albumin-fibrinogen complex was selectively removed from an aliquot of purified fibrinogen Fukuoka II using an immobilized anti-human albumin antibody column. At physiological ionic strength, repolymerization of the fibrinogen Fukuoka II was not improved after removing the albumin-fibrinogen complex (data not shown). The number of free sulfhydryl groups in fibrinogen molecules were examined using Ellman's procedure(36Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Google Scholar). Less than 0.05 mol of -SH group/mol of fibrinogen (0.05 ± 0.01, mean ± S.D., n = 3) was observed in normal fibrinogen as well as fibrinogen Fukuoka II, indicating that the mutated Cys at residue 15 of the Bβ chain in fibrinogen Fukuoka II is disulfide cross-linked to a sulfhydryl group in other molecules including albumin, cysteine, and fibrinogen Fukuoka II itself (see below). Normal fibrinogen or fibrinogen Fukuoka II molecules were digested with C. atrox proteinase III, and the Bβ 1-42 fragments were separated from the precipitable des-(Bβ 1-42)-fibrinogen molecules by heating at 56°C for 10 min. The supernatant was analyzed using SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue and immunoblotting using anti-human albumin antibody (Fig. 6). Both undigested and digested samples contained several bands above 67,000 daltons, which must be due to contamination in the purified fibrinogen fractions (lanes 1-4 in Fig. 6, a and b). Residual unprecipitable fibrinogen (lanes 1 and 4 in Fig. 6a) or des-(Bβ 1-42)-fibrinogen molecules (lanes 2 and 3 in Fig. 6a) remained at the top of the gel under nonreducing conditions. When normal fibrinogen was digested with C. atrox proteinase III, the Bβ 1-42 fragment was detected by SDS-PAGE as a single band at 4,500 daltons under either reducing or nonreducing conditions (lane 2 in Fig. 6, a and b). Two new bands of 9,000- and 65,000-dalton molecular mass were observed when fibrinogen Fukuoka II was digested with C. atrox proteinase III under nonreducing conditions (lane 3 in Fig. 6a). The 9,000-dalton band disappeared under reducing conditions (lane 3 in Fig. 6b). Immunoblot analysis using anti-human albumin antibody confirmed that the protein at 65,000-dalton molecular mass was albumin (lane 3 in Fig. 6, c and d). Further analysis of the Bβ 1-42 fragments using either reducing or nonreducing conditions was performed by reversed-phase HPLC (TSK gel ODS-120T, 4.6 × 250 mm) using a linear gradient of 20-30% CH3CN containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Using nonreducing conditions, the normal and mutated Bβ 1-42 fragments were separated into two peaks (B1 and B2) and seven peaks (B3-B9), respectively (Fig. 7a, i and ii). Using reducing conditions, the Bβ 1-42 fragment of fibrinogen Fukuoka II was separated into four peaks (B10-B13) (Fig. 7a, iii), whereas the elution pattern of normal Bβ 1-42 fragments were not changed by reduction. The separated peaks were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. Bβ 1-42 fragments in peaks B1 through B6 appeared as a single band on SDS-PAGE at 4,500 daltons under either nonreducing or reducing conditions (Fig. 7, b and c). In contrast, peaks B7, B8, and B9 showed bands at 9,000 daltons under nonreducing conditions that shifted to 4,500 daltons under reducing conditions (Fig. 7, b and c). Peaks B1-B9 were sequenced on a gas phase sequenator after treating with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase (Table 2). These results showed that the sequence of Bβ 1-42 in peak B2 was the normal sequence(1Henschen A. Lottspeich F. Kehl M. Southan C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 408: 28-43Google Scholar), but the Bβ 1-42 in peak B1 had hydroxyproline instead of proline at residue 31 in the Bβ chain as previously observed by Henschen(39Henschen A.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 42-47Google Scholar). Bβ 1-42 in peaks B4 and B6 had the same normal sequence as those in peaks B1 and B2, respectively. Bβ 1-42 in peaks B3 and B5 had the Gly to Cys mutation at residue 15 as deduced from the genomic DNA analysis. These results are consistent with the genomic DNA analysis, which shows that the propositus and his father are heterozygous (Fig. 4).TABLE II Open table in a new tab The Bβ 1-42 fragments from peaks B10 and B12 confirmed that they were the mutated fragments, and those from peaks B11 and B13 had the normal sequence. Judging from the peak heights of B10-B13 in Fig. 7a (iii), we concluded that fibrinogen Fukuoka II was expressed at almost the same level as normal fibrinogen in these heterozygosis patients. Cysteine was shown to disulfide cross-link to fibrinogen Fukuoka II in an equilimolar ratio. The results of amino acid composition and of sequence analysis of all Bβ 1-42 fragments were consistent with the exception of peaks B3 and B5. Amino acid composition of those two fragments indicated that an additional Cys residue was associated with Bβ 1-42 in peaks B3 and B5 (Table 3). The additional Cys was lost after reducing those samples with dithiothreitol (see B3′ and B5′ in Table 3). Thus, a cysteine-fibrinogen Fukuoka II complex was formed through a disulfide bond at the mutated Cys of residue 15.TABLE III Open table in a new tab Fibrinogen molecules were directly observed by electron microscopy. Examination of normal fibrinogen molecules revealed the usual tridomainal structures (Fig. 8a), whereas in addition to the tridomainal structures, extra globular domains situated near the fibrinogen E domain and dimers of the tridomainal structures were observed in fibrinogen Fukuoka II (Fig. 8b). It is reasonable to assume that the extra globular domain structure and the dimer of tridomainal structure correspond to the albumin-fibrinogen complex as reported in fibrinogen Dusart (40Siebenlist K.R. Mosesson M.W. DiOrio J.P. Soria J. Soria C. Caen J.P. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1993; 4: 61-65Google Scholar) and the dimers of fibrinogen Fukuoka II. Statistic analysis on electron micrographs showed that about 5% (10 out of 200) and 2% (4 out of 200) of fibrinogen Fukuoka II molecules formed albumin-fibrinogen complexes and intermolecular dimeric fibrinogen complexes, respectively. This proportion was consistent with the density of bands on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5). A congenital heterozygous abnormal fibrinogen designated as fibrinogen Fukuoka II is characterized by prolonged thrombin and reptilase times (Table 1), retarded release of FPB, normal release of FPA (Fig. 1), and disrupted repolymerization of fibrin monomers (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Genomic DNA analysis on exon II of Bβ chain indicated that fibrinogen Fukuoka II had a single base substitution in the codon normally coding for Gly at residue 15 of the Bβ chain. This substitution changed the codon from GGT (for Gly) to TGT (for Cys) (Fig. 4), and amino acid sequencing of Bβ 1-42 peaks confirmed the mutation (Table 2). Normal repolymerization of des-(Bβ 1-42)-fibrin monomers of fibrinogen Fukuoka II was recovered (Fig. 2, e and f), indicating that the abnormal repolymerization behavior of intact fibrinogen Fukuoka II is due to the mutation at residue 15 of the Bβ chain. Titration of sulfhydryl groups showed that fibrinogen Fukuoka II contained no detectable free sulfhydryl groups, indicating that the mutated Cys residue forms a disulfide bond with a sulfhydryl group from other compounds. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis showed that this mutated Cys residue could form a disulfide bond with a sulfhydryl group in albumin as shown in other abnormal fibrinogens(14Koopman J. Haverkate F. Grimbergen J. Engesser L. Novakova I. Kerst A.F.J.A. Lord S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3478-3482Google Scholar, 40Siebenlist K.R. Mosesson M.W. DiOrio J.P. Soria J. Soria C. Caen J.P. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1993; 4: 61-65Google Scholar). In addition, dimeric fibrinogen Fukuoka II was also formed via a intermolecular disulfide bond (Fig. 5). Rotary shadowing of the affected fibrinogen molecules indicated that 5 and 2% of fibrinogen Fukuoka II fraction formed albumin-fibrinogen complexes and intermolecular dimeric fibrinogen complexes, respectively. This means that approximately 10 and 4% of the mutated fibrinogen forms albumin-fibrinogen and dimeric fibrinogen complexes, because the examined patients were heterozygous for this mutation. Analysis by HPLC of the Bβ 1-42 peptides from fibrinogen Fukuoka II produced seven peaks (B3-B9), whereas normal fibrinogen produced only two peaks (B1 and B2). Peak B1 contained hydroxyproline instead of proline at normal residue 31 of the Bβ chain, and peak B2 contained proline at this position (Table 2). When multiple individuals were examined, the ratio of peak B1 to peak B2 ranged from 0.2 to 0.7. Bβ 1-42 in peaks B7 and B9 were homodimers of the mutated Bβ 1-42 fragment that contained hydroxyproline and proline at position 31, respectively (Table 2). Peak B8 was a heterodimer of Bβ 1-42 that contained hydroxyproline or proline. These data show that normal fibrinogen molecules have a random distribution of proline or hydroxyproline at position 31 of the Bβ chain. The functional significance of this heterogeneity is not currently understood. Peaks B3, B5, B7, B8, and B9 contained the Gly to Cys mutation at position 15 of the Bβ chain (Table 2). Bβ 1-42 in peaks B3 and B5 were disulfide cross-linked to cysteine (Table 3). Peaks B7-B9 were Bβ 1-42 dimers cross-linked by disulfide bonds through the mutated Cys (Fig. 7, b and c) and indicated that two fibrinogen Fukuoka II molecules were cross-linked to form a 700,000-dalton dimer. A rough estimation from Fig. 7a (ii) shows that the amount of fibrinogen in peaks B3 and B5 was almost equal to that in peaks B7-B9, indicating that the amount of cysteine-fibrinogen complex is similar to the sum of intermolecular cross-linked dimeric fibrinogen molecules and intramolecular cross-linked fibrinogen molecules. Under reducing conditions, all peaks of B3, B5, and B7-B9 were reduced into two peaks B10 and B12 (Fig. 7a, iii). The peak heights of B10 and B12 were almost equal to the heights of peaks B11 and B13, indicating that normal fibrinogen and fibrinogen Fukuoka II are equally expressed in the heterozygous patients. Taken together with statistic analysis on rotary shadowing electron micrograph, we estimated that the proportions of the cysteine-fibrinogen Fukuoka II complex, the intramolecular cross-linked fibrinogen Fukuoka II, the albumin-fibrinogen Fukuoka II complex, and the intermolecular cross-linked dimeric fibrinogen were approximately 45, 40, 10, and 5%, respectively. In fibrinogen Fukuoka II, almost half of the mutated molecules complexed with cysteine. The same mutation designated as fibrinogen Fukuoka II has been reported as fibrinogen Ise(17Yoshida N. Wada H. Morita K. Hirata H. Matsuda M. Yamazumi K. Asakura S. Shirakawa S. Blood. 1991; 77: 1958-1963Google Scholar). However, fibrinogen Ise showed prolonged thrombin time with normal reptilase time and defective release of FPB by thrombin but normal repolymerization of fibrin monomers pretreated with reptilase. Contrary to fibrinogen Ise, no repolymerization occurred from des-(A)-fibrin monomer Fukuoka II at physiological ionic strength (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Despite the same mutation from Gly to Cys at residue 15 of the Bβ chain, analytical data on the fibrinogen Ise and Fukuoka II mutants were not consistent with each other. The most important differences are the effects of the mutated Bβ chain on repolymerization, i.e. repolymerization of fibrinogen Fukuoka II was disrupted as long as the Bβ chain associated with the original fibrinogen molecule. The bulky amino-terminal region of the Bβ chain sterically disturbed the repolymerization of fibrinogen Fukuoka II but did not affect the structure of the Aα chain, because the release of FPA by thrombin or reptilase was not depressed (Fig. 1c) as in the case of fibrinogen Ise. Steric hindrance of fibrin monomer repolymerization by the amino-terminal region of mutated Bβ chain has been reported. Abnormal fibrinogens with a substitution of Arg to Cys at position 14 of the Bβ chain (11Kaudewitz H. Henschen A. Soria C. Soria J. Bertrand O. Heaton D. Müller-Berhaus G. Sheefers-Borchel U.

Wada H. Morita K. Hirata H. Matsuda M. Yamazumi K. Asakura S. Shirakawa S. Blood. 1991; 77: 1958-1963Google Scholar). Another difference between fibrinogen Ise and fibrinogen Fukuoka II is that the mutated Cys in fibrinogen has been reported in the free sulfhydryl form(17Yoshida N. Wada H. Morita K. Hirata H. Matsuda M. Yamazumi K. Asakura S. Shirakawa S. Blood. 1991; 77: 1958-1963Google Scholar), whereas our results show that all mutated Cys residues are disulfide-bonded to other molecules. The basis for the discrepancies between fibrinogen Ise and fibrinogen Fukuoka II described above is not clear but may involve additional mutations in the fibrinogen Ise molecule that have not yet been determined.

Here, we report the unusual property of rat Nb2-11 cells, a prolactin-dependent pre-T-cell line, to display reduced HSP expression following exposure to elevated temperature. After heat stress (41°C, 1 h), there was no evidence of inducible members of the 70 kDa HSP family, a response common to other cell culture and tissue systems. Moreover, expression of constitutive members of the HSP70 and HSP90 families decreased during the heat stress, apparently reflecting a decrease in mRNA stability. Gel shift assays revealed that heat shock factor (HSF) was activated in spite of the lack of expression of inducible HSP70 transcripts, although its DNA binding rapidly deteriorated. Immunoblotting, using an antibody specific to HSF1, indicated that proteolysis of HSF1 may be responsible for this rapid termination of heat shock element binding. CCAAT binding, a component of constitutive HSP70 expression, was also reduced by heat stress in Nb2-11 cells and may account for the decline in constitutive HSP70 expression. Prolactin pretreatment prevented the fragmentation of HSF1, protected heat shock element and CCAAT binding, prevented the decline in constitutive HSP70 and HSP90 expression, and restored a modest expression of inducible HSP70 following heat treatment.

Results of this study describe a unique regulatory defect in HSP expression in Nb2-11 cells, possibly a common characteristic of other hormone-dependent tumors. At both the cellular and organismic level, heat and other metabolic and environmental stressors are known to cause a rapid and massive synthesis of a set of highly conserved proteins termed heat shock proteins (HSPs( 1The abbreviations used are: HSPheat shock proteinHSFheat shock factorsHSEheat shock elementPRLprolactinkbkilobase(s).) ; for review, see (1Welch W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 1063-1081Google Scholar) and (2Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperons. 26. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 1-30Google Scholar)). HSPs have been identified in evolutionarily diverse organisms ranging from bacteria and plants to humans and are categorized based on their molecular masses(1Welch W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 1063-1081Google Scholar). The four major families, each of which is comprised of multiple genes, include proteins of approximately 110, 90, 70, and 27 kDa. Some members of HSP families are expressed constitutively in the absence of stress(3Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 993-998Google Scholar, 4O'Malley K. Mauron A. Barchas J.D. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3476-3483Google Scholar). Other HSPs are stress-inducible; they are expressed only after the cells have been exposed to an appropriate stimulus(1Welch W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 1063-1081Google Scholar, 2Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperons. 26. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 1-30Google Scholar). While the precise function of HSPs may depend on the context in which they are studied, they are believed to mediate protection or adaptation in response to cellular stress and to aid in the translocation of metabolically important proteins to their proper intracellular compartments. heat shock protein heat shock factors heat shock element prolactin kilobase(s). The molecular regulation of heat shock protein expression has been studied extensively in cultured cells. Expression of the human constitutive HSP70 gene(s) is cell cycle regulated (5Milarski K. Morimoto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9517-9521Google Scholar) and is induced by both serum (6Wu B. Morimoto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6070-6074Google Scholar) and the adenovirus E1a protein(7Wu B. Hurst H. Jones N. Morimoto R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2994-2999Google Scholar). Constitutive HSP70 transcription is regulated by a “basal” promotor, whose activity is predominantly controlled by the CCAAT element at position -70 relative to the transcription initiation site (8Greene J. Larin Z. Taylor I. Prentice H. Gwinn K. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3646-3655Google Scholar, 9Wu B. Kingston R. Morimoto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 629-633Google Scholar) but also involves other cis-acting elements such as Sp1 and activating transcription factor(10Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Google Scholar). The regulation of stress-inducible HSPs is controlled by preexisting protein factors (heat shock factors (HSFs)) that can be activated by heat shock or treatment with specific chemical agents(11Holmgren R. Corces V. Morimoto R. Blackman R. Melselson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3775-3778Google Scholar, 12Pellham H.R.B. Cell. 1982; 30: 517-528Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the exact mechanism of this activation appears to involve the association of two or more HSF proteins. The multimerization of HSF confers DNA binding activity, which allows the complex to bind to a conserved and repetitive DNA sequence (heat shock element (HSE)) that has been identified in the promotor region of the HSP70 gene(13Wu C. Clos J. Giiorgi G. Haroun R.I. Kim S.-J. Rabindran S.K. Westwood J.T. Wisniewski J. Yim G. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperons. 26.

Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperons. 26. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 417-456Google Scholar). DNA-bound HSF then becomes activated, resulting in an increased transcription of the HSP70 gene. In murine and human cells, two genes (HSF1 and HSF2) encoding unique forms of HSF have been identified(15Sarge K.D. Zimarino V. Holm K. Wu C. Morimoto R.I. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1902-1911Google Scholar, 16Schuetz T.J. Gallo G.J. Sheldon L. Tempest P. Kingston R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6910-6915Google Scholar). HSF1 and HSF2 are activated by distinct mechanisms (17Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2087-2099Google Scholar) but may be simultaneously activated in vivo(14Morimoto R.I. Jurivich D.A. Kroeger P.E. Mathur S.K. Murphy S.P. Dakai A. Sarge K. Abravaya K. Sistonen L.T. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperons. 26. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 417-456Google Scholar), suggesting that mammalian cells possess complex forms of heat shock gene regulation (14Morimoto R.I. Jurivich D.A. Kroeger P.E. Mathur S.K. Murphy S.P. Dakai A. Sarge K. Abravaya K. Sistonen L.T. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperons. 26. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 417-456Google Scholar). Presumably, HSP expression in all organisms is regulated by similar molecular response elements. In this report, we demonstrate that defects in HSP transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and mRNA stability may be responsible for an atypical response of Nb2 cells to heat stress. The prolactin (PRL)-dependent rat Nb2 lymphoma cell line was originally derived from a lymph node from an estrogen-treated Noble rat (18Gout P.W. Beer C.T. Nobel R.L. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 2433-2436Google Scholar) and is dependent upon lactogens (PRL, placental lactogens, or human growth hormone) for proliferation. A partially synchronous growth arrest in the early G1 phase of cell cycle can be induced in exponentially-growing cultures by an 18-24-h incubation in lactogen-deficient medium. The addition of picogram quantities of PRL to such stationary cells reinitiates cell cycle progression(19Buckley A.R. Buckley D.J. Gout P.W. Liang H. Rao Y-P. Blake M.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 98: 17-25Google Scholar). Thus, this line has proven invaluable for the study of PRL receptor coupling to a growth response. In addition to the hormone-dependent lines, several PRL-independent Nb2 sublines have been developed by lactogen starvation and cloning of surviving cells(20Gout P.W. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 1751-1755Google Scholar). One such line, designated Nb2-SFJCD1, is completely autonomous but retains a partial sensitivity to the mitogenic effects of PRL(19Buckley A.R. Buckley D.J. Gout P.W. Liang H. Rao Y-P. Blake M.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 98: 17-25Google Scholar). Compared with parent PRL-dependent Nb2 cultures, which are relatively indolent when transplanted into Noble rats, Nb2-SFJCD1 cells are highly metastatic; they rapidly develop into lethal lung, kidney, liver, and heart malignancies(21Gout P.W. Horsman D.E. Foc K. Dejong G. Ma S. Bruchovsky N. Anticancer Res. 1994; 14: 2485-2492Google Scholar). Therefore, the PRL-dependent Nb2 cells, together with the autonomous Nb2-SFJCD1 subline, provide a useful model system to investigate the molecular consequences of tumor progression from hormone (or growth factor)-dependence to tumor cell autonomy(21Gout P.W. Horsman D.E. Foc K. Dejong G. Ma S. Bruchovsky N. Anticancer Res. 1994; 14: 2485-2492Google Scholar). We have determined that exposure of lactogen-dependent Nb2 cells to heat shock does not result in expression of inducible members of the HSP70 gene family and actually reduces the level of constitutively expressed members of the HSP70 and HSP90 families. This unusual heat-stress response appears to reflect a decreased mRNA stability and a defect in HSP transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that is partially restored by pretreating the cells with PRL. This novel defect in HSP gene regulation in Nb2 cells may have important consequences in the progression of hormone-dependent tumors. The PRL-dependent rat T-lymphoma cell line, Nb2-11, originally cloned by Dr. H. G. Freisen (Winnipeg, Canada) and the PRL-independent subline, Nb2-SFJCD1, developed from the parental line by lactogen starvation and cloning of surviving cells were obtained from Dr. P. W. Gout (Vancouver, Canada). Nb2-11 cells were maintained at 37°C in Fischer's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) as a source of lactogen, 10% horse serum (BioWhittaker), 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME, 10-4M), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) as described by Gout et al.(18Gout P.W. Beer C.T. Nobel R.L. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 2433-2436Google Scholar). For various experiments, cells were growth arrested in the early G1 phase of cell cycle by an 18-24-h preincubation in lactogen-free medium, i.e. Fischer's medium supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol, antibiotics, and 10% nonmitogenic gelding serum (ICN, Irvine, CA) (assay medium). When utilized for comparative purposes, Nb2-SFJCD1 cultures were similarly preincubated in assay medium for 18-24 h prior to commencement of the experimental procedures. Growth-arrested Nb2-11 or similarly pretreated Nb2-SFJCD1 cells were suspended in pregassed assay medium (1-2 × 106 cells/ml) in a 50-ml conical culture tubes immersed in a water bath maintained at 41°C for 60 min. Subsequent to heat exposure, the cultures were returned to 37°C. The cultures were harvested at various time points through 4 h after commencement of heat exposure for use in Northern and immunoblotting of HSPs and gel shift assays. In some experiments, a maximally mitogenic concentration of PRL (20 ng/ml; ovine prolactin (O-19), NIH Pituitary Hormone and Antisera Program, Bethesda, MD) was added to stationary Nb2-11 or similarly preincubated Nb2-SFJCD1 cultures 6 h prior to commencement of heat stress. Following exposure conditions, Nb2-11 and Nb2-SFJCD1 cells were disrupted in RNAzol (Tel-Test, Inc.) using a Polytron tissue homogenizer (Brinkman Inst.) at high speed for 10 s. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the manufacturers protocol (Tel-Test, Inc.) and was quantitated spectro-photometrically. For Northern analysis, RNA samples were denatured in formaldehyde and fractionated in 1.0% agarose gels containing 2.2 M formaldehyde. RNA was transferred to Genescreen Plus membranes (DuPont) according to the manufacturer's recommended conditions in 10 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 M sodium chloride, 0.015 M sodium citrate) and then baked for 2 h at 80°C. Filters were hybridized and washed at 65°C according to the procedure of Church and Gilbert(22Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Google Scholar). Nb2-11 and Nb2-SFJCD1 cells were homogenized on ice in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.4 M NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mM leupeptin. Insoluble cellular material was pelleted by microcentrifugation (4°C; 5 min). Protein content in the resulting supernatant was determined using a modification of the Lowry assay (DC protein assay, Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Assays were performed using the GELSHIFT kit supplied by Stratagene (catalog no. 201001, Los Angeles, CA). Ten μg of protein from tissue lysates were incubated with 1 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the HSE (5′-GCCTCGAATCTTCGCGAACTTTCG-3′) or to the CCAAT element (5′-CTCGGTGATTGGCTCAGAAGG-3′) on ice for 30 min in incubation buffer containing poly(dI-dC)•(dI-dC) (Sigma). Specificity of the binding activity was determined by incubation of reaction lysates in the presence of competing unlabeled HSE or CCAAT (1, 5, and 25 ng) or in the presence of 25 ng of unlabeled SP-1 and AP-1 oligonucleotides. Incubation reactions were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, dried, and then apposed to x-ray film for visualization. Cellular protein was extracted from Nb2-11 and Nb2-SFJCD1 cells by homogenization in ice-cold buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.5 mM MgCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.4 M NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mM leupeptin at 4°C. Insoluble material was removed by microcentrifugation (5 min), and protein was determined spectrophotometrically (Bio-Rad) in the supernatant. Individual protein samples (20 μg/lane) were fractionated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to Immuno-Lite blotting membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk, and immunoblotting was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognize HSF1 or HSF2 (graciously provided by Dr. R. I. Morimoto). A goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1:3000) was used as a secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized utilizing a chemilluminescent reaction (Immun-Lite assay kit, Bio-Rad) followed by exposure to x-ray film. A cDNA for HSP70, isolated from a Chinese hamster ovary cell line(23Fornace A.J. Alamo I. Hollander M.C. Lamoreaux E. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 182: 61-74Google Scholar), was provided by Dr. Albert J. Fornace, Jr. HSP89α and HSP89β cDNAs were obtained from Stress-Gen (Victoria, BC, Canada). Purified inserts were labeled with [32P]dCTP (DuPont NEN) using the random primer method(24Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Google Scholar). Nb2-11 and Nb2-SFJCD1 cultures in lactogen-free medium were heat stressed for 1 h as described above. The cells were harvested at 0, 15, 60, 75, and 90 min after the initiation of the heat stress. Subsequent to heat exposure, some cells were replaced in a 37°C incubator for an additional 15 or 30 min before harvesting. Therefore, the 75 and 90 min time points represent 15 and 30 min of recovery at 37°C. Total RNA was extracted from cells at each time point, and HSP70, HSP89α, and HSP89β mRNA levels were determined by Northern blotting (Fig. 1). An HSP70 transcript that migrated at approximately 2.3 kb was apparent in unstressed cells of both lines (zero time point). The magnitude of expression of this transcript was consistently greater in Nb2-SFJCD1 cells. This transcript corresponds to a constitutively expressed HSP70 gene observed in other cells and tissues that hybridized with our cDNA probe, as it is similar in size and present in unstressed cells. Surprisingly, expression of this transcript declined after 60 min of heat exposure in Nb2-11 cells and remained depressed during the 30-min recovery period. In addition, there was no evidence of inducible forms of HSP70 in any sample. In contrast, expression of the constitutive HSP70 transcript did not change in Nb2-SFJCD1 cells during the exposure conditions, and low levels of inducible HSP70 transcripts (2.8 kb) were detectable in these cells at 60, 75, and 90 min of exposure. As with HSP70, HSP89α and HSP89β are expressed constitutively in both cell lines with slightly higher expression noted in Nb2-SFJCD1 cells. HSP89α mRNA expression was increased by 30 min of heat exposure in Nb2-11 and Nb2-SFJCD1 cells. Additionally, several smaller bands were also present at 30 min and later time points that may represent HSP89α fragments. HSP89β expression during the exposure conditions was quite different from that observed for HSP89α, but very similar to the changes observed in constitutive HSP70 expression. HSP89β levels were greatly reduced at 60, 75, and 90 min in Nb2-11 cultures, whereas expression did not change noticeably in Nb2-SFJCD1 cells. Virtually all cells respond to heat stress by increased expression of HSP70 mRNA transcripts. Therefore, it was unusual that HSP70 was not induced by heat in the Nb2-11 line. Even more remarkable was that constitutive HSP70 mRNA levels were actually reduced by heat shock. However, the heat shock response is known to be dependent upon the nature and relative severity of the stress that elicits it. Thus, several experiments were performed to further characterize the heat shock response in Nb2-11 and Nb2-SFJCD1 cells. Initially, Nb2-11 and Nb2-SFJCD1 cells were exposed to 37, 39, 41, 43, or 45°C for 30 or 60 min in a water bath. Control samples were taken from cultures maintained at 37°C in an incubator. No inducible HSP70 transcripts were expressed at any temperature/time point in Nb2-11 cells (Fig. 2). Consistent with previous experiments, constitutive HSP70 was reduced after a 60-min exposure to 41°C. Constitutive HSP70 expression was also reduced after exposure to 43°C and 45°C for 30 and 60 min. There was a small amount of inducible HSP70 transcripts in Nb2-SFJCD1 cells exposed to 41°C for 60 min as observed previously. Constitutive HSP70 in Nb2-SFJCD1 cells was unaffected at any temperature after 30 min, although constitutive levels dropped slightly after 60 min at 43 and 45°C. Since both cell lines displayed an unusual sensitivity to heat stress, we determined the viability of Nb2-11 and Nb2-SFJCD1 cells after the respective treatments described above. Very few nonviable cells were detected in either cell line at temperatures of 41°C or below (Fig. 3). Although there were generally more nonviable Nb2-11 compared with Nb2-SFJCD1 cells in any given population, the percentage of nonviable cells from either line was typically 10% or less at these temperatures. The number of nonviable cells in each line increased after 30 min of exposure to 43 and 45°C. Even greater increases were observed in cultures treated at these temperatures for 60 min. Thus, exposure to 41°C is sufficient to induce the response in the Nb2 lines but does not significantly affect cell viability. To determine the time course for generation of the heat shock response in Nb2-11 and Nb2-SFJCD1 cells, both lines were exposed to 41°C followed by the determination of HSP70 expression at time points to 6 h. In Nb2-11 cultures, HSP70 expression was limited to the constitutive transcript and was again reduced after 1 h of heat exposure (Fig. 4, upper panel). Importantly, levels of expression began to increase notably by 4 h and returned to near control levels by 6 h after initiation of the heat shock. In unstressed Nb2-SFJCD1 cells (Fig. 4, lower panel), levels of constitutive HSP70 actually showed a slight decrease over time. Constitutive HSP70 expression was not reduced by heat shock in this line, and again there were larger, heat-inducible HSP70 transcripts evident at 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after heat exposure. Heavy metals are known to induce an HSP response in many systems. Therefore, cadmium was used to provide additional characterization of the HSP response in Nb2-11 and Nb2-SFJCD1 cells. Cadmium (25 μM) increased constitutive HSP70 mRNA expression after 3 h of exposure, but no increases in inducible transcripts were detected at any time (data not shown). Collectively, these results indicated that at least two separate events were responsible for the heat-induced decline of HSP70 transcripts in Nb2-11 cells: a decline in constitutive mRNA and a lack of expression of inducible transcripts. The regulation of expression of constitutive and inducible HSP70 genes is mediated by distinct mechanisms. Thus, it was likely that several factors contributed to the decline in constitutive HSP70 and the lack of inducible transcripts in Nb2-11 cells. Initially, it was important to determine whether the cause of these observations resulted from reduced transcription of HSP70 genes or from a decreased stability of HSP70 messages in this cell line. To assess HSP70 mRNA stability, Nb2-11 and Nb2-SFJCD1 cells were subjected to a 1-h heat stress (41°C) and then treated with actinomycin-D (5 μg/ml). Control cultures received no heat treatment. HSP70 mRNA expression was then determined in all cultures at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after actinomycin-D treatment. Constitutive HSP70 transcripts appeared quite stable since actinomycin-D treatment had little effect on these transcripts in nonheated Nb2-11 and Nb2-SFJCD1 cells (Fig. 5). However, in heat-stressed Nb2-11 cells, constitutive HSP70 mRNA levels were reduced and continued to decline during the 2 h after treatment. Additionally, smears were evident below 2.3 kb in these cells, indicating that the stability of this message was reduced by heat. In Nb2-SFJCD1 cells, the signal intensity of the 2.3-kb transcript did not decline as dramatically compared with Nb2-11 cultures, but degraded products were again evident. Inducible HSP70 transcripts were present early after heat treatment but declined during the 2 h after actinomycin-D treatment. The preceding experiment indicated that reduced stability of constitutive HSP70 transcripts contributed to their heat-induced decline but did not rule out the possibility that changes in transcriptional regulation were also involved, nor did it address the cause of the lack of expression of inducible HSP70 transcripts. Expression of inducible HSP70 genes by heat is mediated by activation of HSF(13Wu C. Clos J. Giiorgi G. Haroun R.I. Kim S.-J. Rabindran S.K. Westwood J.T. Wisniewski J. Yim G. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperons. 26. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 395-416Google Scholar). Concomitant with the decline in constitutive HSP70 mRNA, no inducible transcripts were apparent in heat-stressed Nb2-11 cells (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 4). To determine whether the lack of inducible HSP70 transcripts could be attributed to a reduced capacity to activate HSF in Nb2-11 cells, HSE binding was assessed by gel mobility shift assay in both cell lines exposed to the identical heat shock conditions described in Fig. 1. Prior to heat exposure (zero time point), no HSE binding was observed in either line (Fig. 6). However, after 15 min, substantial HSE binding was evident in both cell lines. In Nb2-11 cells, this binding was still distinct after 30 min, but it appeared to deteriorate with continued exposure. Not only did the magnitude of the binding decline, but the bands also became less distinct and began to smear below the size of the bands present at 15 and 30 min. The magnitude of HSE binding also declined in Nb2-SFJCD1 cells during the heat exposure, but the overall signal at each time point was greater in these cells compared with the Nb2-11 line. Moreover, the bands did not appear to become degraded or smeared in the Nb2-SFJCD1 cells, as observed in Nb2-11 cultures. These results indicated that HSF was activated by heat in Nb2-11 cells, yet no inducible HSP70 transcripts were expressed. Although HSE binding was induced by heat exposure, this activity was short lived and appeared to degrade after 1 h. The smearing of the HSE binding signal in the gel shift assays led us to suspect that HSF may be adversely affected by heat stress in the Nb2-11 line. To determine the effects of heat exposure on HSF, the identical protein samples used in the gel shift assays were immunoblotted with an antibody that specifically recognizes HSF1. A single band migrating at about 90 kDa was recognized by the HSF1 antibody in unstressed Nb2-11 and Nb2-SFJCD1 cells (Fig. 7, zero time point). By 0.5 h after heat exposure, a second protein band was evident in Nb2-11 lysates that was smaller in molecular weight. Additional smaller protein bands were detected in Nb2-11 cells at 1, 2, and 4 h, suggesting that HSF may undergo proteolysis subsequent to heat exposure. In contrast, no such fragmentation of HSF1 was apparent in Nb2-SFJCD1 cells at any time during or after the exposure. Identical samples of heat-treated Nb2-11 and Nb2-SFJCD1 cells were immunoblotted with an antibody that recognizes HSF2. However, no HSF2 immunoreactivity was detected in any sample from either cell line (data not shown). A CCAAT response element has been identified in the regulatory region of constitutively expressed HSP70 genes and is thought to contribute to their transcriptional regulation(25Lum L.S.Y. Sultzman L.A. Kaufman R.J. Linzer D.I.H. Wu B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6709-6717Google Scholar, 26Morgan W.D. Williams G.T. Morimoto R.I. Greene R. Kingston R.E. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1129-1138Google Scholar). Since constitutive levels of HSP70 mRNA decreased in Nb2-11 cells during heat exposure, CCAAT binding was determined by gel shift assay in protein samples used in Fig. 3. Considerable CCAAT binding was evident in samples of Nb2-11 cells prior to heat exposure (Fig. 8). The intensity of CCAAT binding activity decreased throughout the 60-min heat exposure and continued to decline during the 30-min recovery period. In unstressed Nb2-SFJCD1 cells (zero time point), strong CCAAT binding activity was evident. Although there was a slight decline in this binding during the treatment regimen, the magnitude of this decline was not as great as that observed in Nb2-11 cells. In addition to its mitogenic actions, we have demonstrated that PRL augments constitutive HSP70 mRNA expression in Nb2-11 cells(19Buckley A.R. Buckley D.J. Gout P.W. Liang H. Rao Y-P. Blake M.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 98: 17-25Google Scholar). To determine the effect of PRL on the heat shock response in Nb2-11 and Nb2-SFJCD1 cells, heat-induced HSP70, HSP89α, and HSP89β mRNA expression was assessed in each cell line in the presence or absence of PRL (Fig. 9). Exposure to 41°C resulted in reduced constitutive HSP70 and HSP89β mRNA levels, and an increased HSP89α by 90 min in Nb2-11 cells as previously observed. By comparing the zero time points of treated and untreated Nb2-11 cells, it was evident that PRL pretreatment resulted in elevated levels of constitutive HSP70 and HSP89β. Moreover, there was no reduction in constitutive HSP70 or HSP89β expression in lactogen-treated Nb2-11 cells. Thus, PRL prevented the heat-induced decline in constitutive HSP70 and HSP89β mRNA levels in these cells. The pattern of HSP89α expression in response to heat treatment did not differ between PRL-treated and -untreated Nb2-11 cells. In Nb2-SFJCD1 cells, HSP transcripts were not reduced by heat stress nor did PRL pretreatment affect expression of any HSP species in response to heat. The effect of PRL on HSE and CCAAT binding was also determined in Nb2-11 and Nb2-SFJCD1 cells subjected to the treatment conditions described in Fig. 9. A smearing and reduced magnitude of HSE binding was again apparent in heat-shocked Nb2-11 cells at 90 min of exposure (Fig. 10). Pretreatment with PRL prevented the smearing of the HSE binding signal in these cells albeit the magnitude of the signal was still reduced at 90 min. The decline in CCAAT binding activity following heat stress was less apparent in PRL-treated Nb2-11 cells (Fig. 8). Additionally, the hormone appeared to prevent the loss of one of three bands comprising the CCAAT binding signal (see arrows in Fig. 11). PRL did not appear to substantially affect HSE or CCAAT binding in Nb2-SFJCD1 cells (Figure 10:, Figure 11:).Figure 11:Prolactin conserves CCAAT binding activity in heat-stressed Nb2-11 cells. The same protein samples used in Fig. 7 were incubated with a radiolabeled CCAAT probe and fractionated on polyacrylamide gels as in other mobility shift assays.

PRL treatment greatly reduced the fragmentation of HSF1 in these cells (Fig. 12). Apparently, PRL treatment increases the stability of HSF1 in Nb2-11 cells to that found in Nb2-SFJCD1 cells Although members of several families of heat shock proteins are induced by exposure to different stressors, the HSP70 family has received the preponderance of investigation in response to heat. Constitutive members of the HSP70 family are expressed in unstressed cells. Following heat exposure, there appears to be a slight increase in constitutive HSP70 expression. More notably, additional heat-inducible members of the HSP70 family are expressed at magnitudes significantly greater than that of constitutive HSP70. In this report, we demonstrated that lactogen-dependent Nb2-11 lymphoma cells display a unique response to heat stress (Fig. 1). Two unusual aspects of this response involves members of the HSP70 family. First, no inducible HSP70 mRNA transcripts were apparent following heat exposure, and second, levels of constitutive HSP70 mRNA transcripts declined during heat exposure. Expression of members of the HSP90 family also displayed unique characteristics. Similar to constitutive HSP70, HSP89β mRNA also declined during heat exposure. In contrast, HSP89α increased during heat stress but displayed a very splintered pattern of expression. A large portion of the decline in constitutive HSP70 mRNA expression in Nb2-11 cells appears to be attributable to reduced mRNA stability after heat exposure. The levels of this transcript remained stable in unheated actinomycin-D-treated cultures, whereas it was dramatically reduced in heated cultures (Fig. 5). The degradation products observed below the 2.3 kb band further reflected the instability of this message. In Nb2-SFJCD1 cells, the 2.3-kb transcript appeared more stable during heat stress since the 2.3-kb transcript signal intensity did not decline as much as in Nb2-11 cells. Alternatively, Nb2-SFJCD1 cells may be able to replace lost transcript by an increased transcription. Collectively, these data indicate that reduced stability contributes to the heat-induced decline in constitutive HSP70 mRNA transcripts but do not address changes in the transcriptional regulation of these genes that may occur concurrently. As previously indicated, the molecular regulation of the heat shock response has been the subject of intense investigation yielding a wealth of information regarding the control of HSP expression. Due to the unusual pattern of HSP mRNA expression observed in PRL-dependent Nb2 cells, we initiated experiments addressing the regulation of HSP expression in response to heat in Nb2-11 and Nb2-SFJCD1 cell lines. Gel mobility shift assays were used to determine whether the lack of inducible members of the HSP70 gene family in Nb2-11 cells following heat stress occurred as a result of altered HSE binding (Fig. 3). Strong HSE binding was apparent in extracts from both cell lines 15 min after initiation of heat treatment. By 60 min, the intensity of HSE binding had begun to decline in both lines and displayed a further decline during the 30 min recovery period. While the reduction in HSE binding in Nb2-SFJCD1 cells could be attributed to a decreased signal intensity, the reduced HSE binding in Nb2-11 cells was qualitatively distinct. In addition to a reduced signal intensity, HSE binding in the Nb2-11 cells became diffuse and smeared below the level of the bands observed at the 15 min time point. These data suggest that protein factors capable of interacting with HSE, while retaining their DNA binding activities, were being rapidly altered so as to increase their mobility through the polyacrylamide gels. Based on these results, we concluded that HSF itself was adversely affected by heat stress in Nb2-11 but not in Nb2-SFJCD1 cells. To determine whether the changes in DNA binding were due to alterations in protein factors binding to the HSE, the identical protein samples used for the gel shift assays were immunoblotted using HSF1 and HSF2 antibodies. Fragmentation of HSF1 was apparent by 30 min of heat exposure in Nb2-11 cells. This apparent degradation intensified throughout the rest of the treatment. In contrast, HSF1 in heat-stressed Nb2-SFJCD1 cells did not appear to suffer the same proteolytic demise, although there did seem to be a gradual loss of signal intensity. These results indicate that the decline in HSE binding activity in Nb2-11 cells may be due to a rapid decay of HSF. The rapid loss of HSF binding may be ultimately responsible for the lack of inducible HSP70 mRNA transcripts in these cells. In Nb2-SFJCD1 cells, there was no fragmentation but HSE binding and HSF1 protein levels declined with time after heat stress. Apparently, these cells maintain a modest ability to respond to heat stress through the expression of inducible HSP70 mRNA transcripts. However, despite their improvement in HSP expression relative to Nb2-11 cells, the heat-stress response of Nb2-SFJCD1 cells is less than that observed in many other cell types(27Blake M.J. Gershon D.

While HSF appears responsible for activation of inducible HSP expression, CCAAT binding factors play a major role in expression of constitutively expressed HSPs. The importance of CCAAT in the regulation of constitutive HSP70 expression prompted us to investigate whether alterations in CCAAT binding may explain the decline in constitutive HSP70 mRNA expression in heat-stressed Nb2-11 cells. CCAAT binding displayed a steady decline in Nb2-11 cells during the heat stress conditions (Fig. 5). By 90 min after initiation of the heat treatment, the intensity of the CCAAT binding signal was reduced by over 80%. There was also an apparent loss of binding by one of three CCAAT binding factors as indicated by the loss of one of the bands comprising the signal. In Nb2-SFJCD1 cells, CCAAT binding also declined but, as with HSE binding, the magnitude of the decline was much less than in Nb2-11 cells. CCAAT was originally identified as a potential promoter element for a number of eukaryotic genes(28Efstradiatis A. Posakony J. Maniatis T. Lawn R. O'Connell C. Spritz R. DeRiel J. Forget B. Weissman S. Slightom J. Blechl A. Smithies O. Baralle F. Shoulders S. Proudfoot N. Cell. 1980; 21: 653-668Google Scholar). Subsequently, multiple CCAAT binding activities have been reported(29Barberis A. Superti-Furga G. Busslinger M. Cell. 1987; 50: 347-359Google Scholar, 30Chodosh L. Baldwin A. Carthew R. Sharp P.

Although it is difficult to assess the relationship among these activities, the current data suggest that different CCAAT elements are recognized in vivo by different factors. While our results do not specifically identify which of the several CCAAT binding factors are affected by heat stress in Nb2-11 cells, they do suggest that their reduced binding may contribute to the decline in constitutive HSP70 mRNA expression in these cells. Pretreatment with PRL prevented the heat-induced reduction of constitutive HSP70 in Nb2-11 cells. The hormone also afforded Nb2-11 cells a meager ability to express inducible HSP70 transcripts in response to heat shock. Both HSE and CCAAT binding were improved in PRL-treated Nb2-11 cells. Perhaps more significantly, PRL treatment also prevented the fragmentation of HSF1 in Nb2-11 cells, thus providing a possible explanation for the change in HSE binding characteristics and mRNA expression. Essentially, the effect of PRL pretreatment on Nb2-11 cells was to transform their heat shock response to one similar to that observed in lactogen-independent Nb2-SFJCD1 cells. Prolactin binds to its receptor initiating a cascade of intracellular events that stimulate proliferation of Nb2-11 cells. Apparently, the cellular events initiated by PRL are responsible for improvement of the heat shock response in these cells. Importantly, PRL-provoked Nb2 cell mitogenesis is coupled to the activation of several tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases that most likely participate in the transcriptional regulation of growth-related genes(32Rui H.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 1235-1244Google Scholar). Since the transcriptional regulation of the heat shock genes has been reported to involve specific phosphorylation events(9Wu B. Kingston R. Morimoto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 629-633Google Scholar), it is likely that one or more of the kinases activated as a consequence of PRL stimulation is directly involved in restoring the heat shock response in Nb2-11 cells. Conversely, the lack of an appropriate HSP response in untreated Nb2-11 cells may directly contribute to the hormone-dependent phenotype of these cells. Delineation of the cellular events responsible for the conversion of the HSP response in Nb2-11 cells to one similar to that of Nb2-SFJCD1 cells may provide important insights into the nature of oncogenic progression from growth factor dependence to tumor autonomy, a clinical occurrence with disastrous consequences."

The inhibitors are bound with their backbones in an extended conformation, and their side chains occupying the S5 to S1' pockets. A (2-amino-4-thiazolyl)methyl side chain at the P2 position shows stronger hydrogen-bonding and van der Waals interactions with renin than the His side chain, which is present in the natural substrate. The ACHPA-gamma-lactam transition state analog has similar interactions with renin as the dihydroxyethylene transition state analog."
