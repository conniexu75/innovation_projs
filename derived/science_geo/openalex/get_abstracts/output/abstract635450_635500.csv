https://openalex.org/W2956135855,"APOBEC3A hairpin passenger hotspots Genomic features are often examined at extremes to determine the impact of mutations. These genomic regions span from the trinucleotide context to megabases that underlie chromatin and chromosomal features. Examining mutational dynamics at the mesoscale, the intermediate span of the genome, Buisson et al. characterized the mutational dynamics of cancer (see the Perspective by Carter). They found that mutations caused by the APOBEC enzyme in DNA stem-loops, a mesoscale feature of the genome, could drive recurrent mutations. Many of these types of mutations have been identified as likely drivers of cancer. However, APOBEC-generated mutations outside of stem-loops were more likely to be cancer driver mutations, providing a genomic context for separating cancer driver from passenger mutations.

https://openalex.org/W2954171316,"Twisted light fields carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) provide powerful capabilities for applications in optical communications, microscopy, quantum optics and microparticle rotation. Here we introduce and experimentally validate a new class of light beams, whose unique property is associated with a temporal OAM variation along a pulse: the self-torque of light. Self-torque is a phenomenon that can arise from matter-field interactions in electrodynamics and general relativity, but to date, there has been no optical analog. In particular, the self-torque of light is an inherent property, which is distinguished from the mechanical torque exerted by OAM beams when interacting with physical systems. We demonstrate that self-torqued beams in the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) naturally arise as a necessary consequence of angular momentum conservation in non-perturbative high-order harmonic generation when driven by time-delayed pulses with different OAM. In addition, the time-dependent OAM naturally induces an azimuthal frequency chirp, which provides a signature for monitoring the self-torque of high-harmonic EUV beams. Such self-torqued EUV beams can serve as unique tools for imaging magnetic and topological excitations, for launching selective excitation of quantum matter, and for manipulating molecules and nanostructures on unprecedented time and length scales."

We used bulk RNA sequencing of genetically labeled neurons and electrophysiological analyses to define ion channel contributions to the intrinsic electrical properties of DRG neuron subtypes. The transcriptome profiles of eight DRG neuron subtypes revealed differentially expressed and functionally relevant genes, including voltage-gated ion channels. Guided by these data, electrophysiological analyses using pharmacological and genetic manipulations as well as computational modeling of DRG neuron subtypes were undertaken to assess the functions of select voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv1, Kv2, Kv3, and Kv4) in shaping action potential (AP) waveforms and firing patterns.

Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons are the first-order neurons in the somatosensory afferent pathway, transducing physical, thermal, and chemical stimuli acting in the periphery into electrical signals and conveying these signals to the CNS for action and perception. DRG neurons are pseudo-unipolar, with one axonal branch that innervates peripheral tissues, including the skin, and another that projects to the spinal cord and, in some cases, the dorsal column nuclei of the brainstem (Abraira and Ginty, 2013Abraira V.E. Ginty D.D. The sensory neurons of touch.Neuron. 2013; 79: 618-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Decades of research has shown that DRG sensory neurons exhibit a wide range of peripheral ending morphologies, central projection patterns, and physiological properties and that they are tuned to distinct modalities or features of sensory stimuli. DRG neurons are thus classified into distinct subtypes (Abraira and Ginty, 2013Abraira V.E. Ginty D.D.

How do DRG neuron subtypes transduce sensory stimuli into patterns of action potentials (APs) that propagate to the CNS? Stimuli impinging on the skin and other organs activate transduction receptors or ion channels on peripheral terminals of DRG sensory neurons, resulting in the generation of receptor potentials. Transduction channels include thermosensitive and mechanosensitive cation channels, such as TrpV1, TrpM8, and Piezo2 (Julius, 2013Julius D. TRP channels and pain.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Suprathreshold receptor potentials trigger activation of voltage-gated ion channels at initiation sites to generate APs that propagate along the length of the axon, into its central axonal branches and terminals. Although the transduction machinery determines the general stimulus modality to which DRG sensory neurons respond, voltage-gated ion channels modulate generator currents and control AP thresholds, AP firing patterns, propagation, and synaptic transmission (Du et al., 2014Du X.

It has long been established that a wide range of voltage-gated sodium (Nav), calcium (Cav), and potassium (Kv) channels are expressed in DRG neurons, and several of these ion channels are now appreciated as targets for developing drugs to treat pain (Dib-Hajj et al., 2010Dib-Hajj S.D.

Most electrophysiological studies have focused on small-diameter DRG neurons, most (but not all) of which correspond to unmyelinated nociceptors, with some studies distinguishing subpopulations of small-diameter neurons based on lectin binding or capsaicin sensitivity (Du and Gamper, 2013Du X.

Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 3401-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Much less is known about the complement of ion channels in physiologically defined DRG neuron subtypes (for example, mechanoreceptors) or how they relate to the firing behaviors in these subtypes, especially medium- and large-diameter DRG neurons, which comprise a highly heterogeneous population. Therefore, a major current challenge is determining how intrinsic electrical properties of the diverse, physiologically distinct mammalian somatosensory neuron subtypes are specified. Recent advances in the development of mouse genetic tools to interrogate the major classes of DRG sensory neurons afford an opportunity to investigate the relationship between patterns of voltage-gated ion channel expression and the intrinsic physiological properties of DRG neuron subtypes. Genetic tools now exist for labeling five principal low-threshold mechanoreceptor subtypes (LTMRs) (i.e., touch receptors) that innervate hairy skin: these are the C-LTMRs, Aδ-LTMRs, Aβ RA-LTMRs, Aβ SA1-LTMRs, and Aβ field-LTMRs (Zimmerman et al., 2014Zimmerman A.

Here, we used genetic tools to identify intrinsic molecular determinants of the physiological properties of LTMR subtypes and, for comparison, nociceptor subtypes and proprioceptors (Hippenmeyer et al., 2005Hippenmeyer S.

Topographically distinct epidermal nociceptive circuits revealed by axonal tracers targeted to Mrgprd.Neuron. 2005; 45: 17-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). We employed genetic labeling to purify these DRG neuron subtypes and performed deep RNA sequencing to identify candidate genes that underlie their subtype-specific intrinsic electrophysiological properties. Our analysis revealed many genes, including voltage-gated ion channels, that are differentially expressed across the five LTMR subtypes, peptidergic and polymodal nonpeptidergic nociceptors, and proprioceptors. Guided by these gene expression profiles, we performed electrophysiological experiments and computational modeling to define contributions of differentially expressed Kv channels to sensory neuron subtype-specific intrinsic electrical properties. Our findings reveal the distinct voltage-gated ion channel constellations that support unique intrinsic properties of the major DRG sensory neuron classes. The availability of mouse genetic tools for selective labeling of functionally defined sensory neuron subtypes in vivo enables a comprehensive analysis of subtype-specific intrinsic physiological properties of these subtypes. We focused on eight major classes of DRG sensory neurons labeled in vivo using genetically modified mice. These are the MrgD+ polymodal nonpeptidergic nociceptors, the broad class of CGRP+ (peptidergic) nociceptors, five functionally defined LTMR subtypes (C-LTMRs, Aδ-LTMRs, Aβ RA-LTMRs, Aβ SA1-LTMRs, and Aβ field-LTMRs), and proprioceptors. The genetic tools used to label each of these neuronal populations are MrgDEGFP mice to label MrgD+ nonpeptidergic nociceptors (Zylka et al., 2005Zylka M.J. Rice F.L. Anderson D.J.

To define the intrinsic electrical properties of DRG neuron subtypes, neurons from each of the genetically labeled mouse lines were acutely dissociated and used for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. The neuron subtypes displayed distinct electrophysiological signatures. MrgD+ nonpeptidergic nociceptors and C-LTMRs both showed repetitive low-frequency firing in response to current injection, reaching maximum frequencies of ∼12 Hz and ∼26 Hz, respectively (Figures 1A, 1B, and 1H ). C-LTMRs exhibited a distinctive delayed firing pattern with a long latency to the first AP followed by regular repetitive spiking (Figure 1B). Aδ-LTMRs showed strong adaptation, firing 5 or 6 spikes in the first few hundred milliseconds and then becoming silent (Figures 1C and 1H). Αβ RA-LTMRs and proprioceptors both fired repetitively over a wide range of frequencies, with the frequency increasing with current amplitude to a maximum of ∼180 and ∼220 Hz, respectively (Figures 1D, 1G, and 1H). Both Aβ field-LTMRs and Aβ SA1-LTMRs typically displayed very strong adaptation, firing only in the first 50 ms of current injection (Figures 1E, 1F, and 1H). Strikingly, Aβ SA1-LTMRs fired no more than two spikes, regardless of the current intensity used for stimulation. The finding that Aβ SA1-LTMRs fire non-repetitively in response to sustained current injection in vitro is counterintuitive because these neurons fire repetitively and adapt slowly to sustained skin indentation in vivo (Wellnitz et al., 2010Wellnitz S.A. Lesniak D.R. Gerling G.J. Lumpkin E.A. The regularity of sustained firing reveals two populations of slowly adapting touch receptors in mouse hairy skin.J.

The gentle touch receptors of mammalian skin.Science. 2014; 346: 950-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether Aβ SA1-LTMRs could fire repetitively in vitro by applying a train of short current pulses (250 μs). Indeed, all Aβ SA1-LTMRs faithfully followed pulse stimulation up to ∼300 Hz (Figure 1E). In vivo, Aβ SA1-LTMR cutaneous endings are associated with Merkel cells, which are themselves mechanosensitive and transmit excitatory signals to Aβ SA1-LTMRs (Chang et al., 2016Chang W. Kanda H. Ikeda R. Ling J. DeBerry J.J. Gu J.G. Merkel disc is a serotonergic synapse in the epidermis for transmitting tactile signals in mammals.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Lumpkin E.A. et al.Piezo2 is required for Merkel-cell mechanotransduction.Nature. 2014; 509: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). These in vitro results are thus consistent with the notion that the repetitive firing of Aβ SA1-LTMRs in response to static indentation in vivo depends on their association with Merkel cells. Proprioceptors could follow repetitive stimulation at even higher frequencies (400–600 Hz) than Aβ SA1-LTMRs, and maximal firing frequencies of both were far higher than that achieved by C-LTMRs (30–100 Hz). The DRG neuron subtypes also display different AP waveforms. MrgD+ nonpeptidergic nociceptors and C-LTMRs have much wider APs (widths ∼2 ms at half spike height) than other LTMR subtypes and proprioceptors, with AP widths <0.5 ms (Figures 1B and 1D). The broad APs seen in MrgD+ nonpeptidergic nociceptors and C-LTMRs agree with previous results showing broad APs in cell bodies associated with unmyelinated C-fibers in rats (Harper and Lawson, 1985Harper A.A. Lawson S.N. Electrical properties of rat dorsal root ganglion neurones with different peripheral nerve conduction velocities.J. Physiol. 1985; 359: 47-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Broad APs may facilitate AP propagation in small unmyelinated axons with short-length constants, which are susceptible to spike failure, especially at the T-junction within the dorsal root ganglion (Gemes et al., 2013Gemes G. Koopmeiners A. Rigaud M. Lirk P. Sapunar D. Bangaru M.L. Vilceanu D. Garrison S.R. Ljubkovic M.

Our electrophysiological analyses of MrgD+ nonpeptidergic nociceptors, the five LTMR subtypes, and proprioceptors indicate that these populations are largely homogeneous in terms of within-group firing patterns and AP waveforms. On the other hand, the CGRP+ peptidergic nociceptors displayed a range of firing patterns and AP waveforms (Figure S1), consistent with the idea that CGRP labels a large, functionally and morphologically heterogeneous group of neurons that can be further subdivided based on their intrinsic physiological properties (Arcourt et al., 2017Arcourt A.

To assess intrinsic mechanosensitivity of the major DRG sensory neuron subtypes, genetically labeled DRG neurons were used for in vitro whole-cell mechanoclamp experiments in which a controlled mechanical stimulus was applied to the cell body using a piezo-driven glass probe and resulting currents were recorded (Hao and Delmas, 2011Hao J.

Mechanical transduction by rat dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro.Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 273: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). All labeled neuronal types were used for this analysis, except for CGRP+ peptidergic nociceptors, which were excluded because of their heterogeneous firing properties (Figure S1). With a series of 500-ms mechanical stimulations of increasing displacement, all five LTMR subtypes and proprioceptors displayed obvious mechanically activated inward currents (Imechs) (Figures 1M–1S), and most MrgD+ nonpeptidergic nociceptors displayed minimal Imechs indistinguishable from noise (100 pA; Figures 1L and 1S). Imech in DRG neuron subtypes also displayed different decay kinetics. Imechs of Aδ-LTMRs, Αβ-LTMRs, and proprioceptors have fast relaxation kinetics with a time constant mostly shorter than 30 ms (Figure 1T). In comparison, Imech of C-LTMRs decays slower with an average time constant around 100 ms. Taken together, these in vitro electrophysiological recordings indicate that most functionally distinct DRG neuron subtypes are distinguished by unique combinations of firing patterns, AP waveforms, and mechanical sensitivities; Aβ field-LTMRs and Aβ SA1-LTMRs displayed similar intrinsic properties despite major differences in their in vivo responses to mechanical stimuli acting on the skin, likely reflecting their unique peripheral terminal morphologies and the skin cell types with which they associate (Zimmerman et al., 2014Zimmerman A.

Differences in intrinsic physiological properties among the subtypes are likely due to differences in ion channels and components of the mechanotransduction machinery that they express. To explore the molecular basis of the distinct intrinsic membrane properties and other distinguishing features of DRG neuron subtypes, we undertook an RNA sequencing approach to generate transcriptome profiles for each of the eight major DRG neuron subtypes. We made use of the aforementioned genetic tools that selectively label each of these subtypes with fluorescent reporters, first purifying labeled neurons to homogeneity using flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting [FACS]) and then extracting RNA from these purified neuronal populations (Figures 2A and 2B ). DRGs from all axial levels were used for FACS, except for proprioceptors, which were purified from thoracic ganglia, because the PVIRES-Cre; Ai14 proprioceptor labeling strategy was found to label a subset of limb level cutaneous LTMRs as well.

Does the human hippocampus also replay activity sequences, even in a nonspatial task, such as, for example, decision-making? Schuck and Niv studied functional magnetic resonance imaging signals in subjects after they had learned a decision-making task. While people rested, the replay of activity patterns in the hippocampus reflected the order of previous task-state sequences. Thus, sequential hippocampal reactivation might participate in decision-making in humans. Science , this issue p. eaaw5181"
https://openalex.org/W2954273212,"A new phase in egg biology Chromosome segregation typically requires centrosomes, which generate the microtubule spindle. However, mammalian eggs build a spindle and segregate chromosomes without centrosomes. How acentrosomal spindles are organized has remained elusive. So et al. show that centrosomal and microtubule-associated proteins are repurposed into a large “liquid-like meiotic spindle domain” (LISD) in eggs. The domains localized to spindle poles and also extended to the spindle fibers that connect to kinetochores. LISDs formed by phase separation and were required for spindle assembly, serving as reservoirs that locally sequester and mobilize spindle assembly factors within the large egg cytoplasm.

Flexible parametric models were applied to compute adjusted female-to-male hazard ratios (aHRs) and standardized survival proportions over follow-up including age, calendar year, education, marital status, birth country, health care region, performance status, smoking history, comorbidities, and tumor location in the final model.Women presented with better performance status, were younger, and more often never-smokers. Women with adenocarcinoma also had lower comorbidity burden, less advanced stage, and were more often EGFR positive. Men with adenocarcinoma had a consistently poorer lung cancer-specific survival across stage; HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.63-0.76 (stage IA-IIB) to 0.94; 95% CI 0.88-0.99 (stage IIIB-IV), remaining largely unchanged after adjustments; aHR 0.74; 95% CI 0.66-0.82 to 0.84; 95% CI 0.81-0.87. The same pattern was observed in squamous cell carcinoma, except in stage IIIA disease, where we found no sex differences in survival.Men with non-small cell lung cancer have a consistently poorer prognosis, even after careful adjustments for a wide range of prognostic factors. While the pattern was similar in both squamous cell and adenocarcinoma, it was larger and more consistent in the latter."

In this study, we use MALDI-TOF on intact cells combined with a refined analysis framework to demonstrate discrimination between methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) Staphylococcus aureus. By combining supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, we firstly show that the mass spectroscopy data contains strong signal for the clustering of MSSA and MRSA. Then we concentrate on applying supervised learning to extract and verify the important features. A new workflow is proposed that allows for extracting a fixed set of reference peaks so that any new data can be aligned to it and hence consistent feature matrices can be obtained. Also note that by doing so we are able to examine the robustness of the important features that have been found. We also show that appropriate size of the benchmark data, appropriate alignment of the testing data and use of an optimal set of features via feature selection results in prediction accuracy over 90%. In summary, as proof-of-principle, our integrated experimental and bioinformatics study suggests a novel intact cell MALDI-TOF to be of great promise for fast and reliable detection of MRSA strains."
https://openalex.org/W2953612643,"Background Few randomized controlled trials have assessed the effects of laughter therapy on health-related quality of life (QOL) in cancer patients. This study aimed to evaluate these effects as an exploratory endpoint in cancer patients as part of a randomized controlled trial conducted at a single institution in Japan. Methods The Initiative On Smile And CAncer (iOSACA) study was an open-label randomized controlled trial conducted in 2017 in which participants aged 40–64 years with cancer were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (laughter therapy) or control group (no laughter therapy). Each participant in the intervention group underwent a laughter therapy session once every two weeks for seven weeks (total of four sessions). Each session involved a laughter yoga routine followed by Rakugo or Manzai traditional Japanese verbal comedy performances. We assessed QOL as a secondary endpoint in this intention-to-treat population using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). The questionnaire was completed at baseline (Week 0) and at Weeks 3 and 7. Mixed-effects models for repeated measures were developed to compare time-dependent changes in each QOL domain from baseline between the intervention and control groups. Results Four participants retracted consent and one participant was retrospectively excluded from analysis due to unmet inclusion criteria. The analysis was conducted using 56 participants, with 26 in the intervention group and 30 in the control group. Questionnaire completion rates were high (>90%), with similar QOL scores reported at baseline in both groups. The mixed-effects models showed that the intervention group had significantly better cognitive function and less pain than the control group for a short period. Conclusion Laughter therapy may represent a beneficial, noninvasive complementary intervention in the clinical setting. Further studies are needed to verify the hypotheses generated from this exploratory study."

A set of 20 technical and tactical performance indicators namely; shot back-third, shot mid-third, shot front-third, pass back-third, pass mid-third, pass front-third, shot in box, shot outbox, chances created, interception, turnover, goals scored 1st period, goals scored 2nd period, goals scored 3rd period, goals scored extra time, tackling, fouls committed, complete save, incomplete save and passing error were observed during the beach soccer Asian Football Confederation tournament 2017 held in Malaysia. A total of 23 matches from 12 teams were notated using StatWatch application in real-time. Discriminant analysis (DA) of standard, backward as well stepwise modes were used to develop a model for the winning (WT) and losing team (LT) whilst Mann-Whitney U test was utilized to ascertain the differences between the WT and LT with respect to the performance indicators evaluated. The standard backward, forward and stepwise discriminates the WT and the LT with an excellent accuracy of 95.65%, 91.30% and 89.13%, respectively. The standard DA model discriminated the teams from seven performance indicators whilst both the backward and forward stepwise identified two performance indicators. The Mann-Whitney U test analysis indicated that the WT is statistically significant from the LT based on the performance indicators determined from the standard mode model of the DA. It was demonstrated that seven performance indicators namely; shot front-third, pass front-third, chances created, goals scores at the 1st period, goals scored at the 2nd period, goals scored at 3rd period were directly linked to a successful performance whilst the incomplete save by the keeper attribute towards the poor performance of the team. The present finding could serve useful to the coaches as well as performance analysts as a measure of profiling successful performance and enables team improvement with respect to the associated performance indicators."
https://openalex.org/W2954468625,"Background Misuse of antibiotics is a well-known driver of antibiotic resistance. Given the decentralized model of the Indian health system and the shortage of allopathic doctors in rural areas, a wide variety of healthcare providers cater to the needs of patients in urban and rural settings. This qualitative study explores the drivers of antibiotic use among formal and informal healthcare providers as well as patients accessing care at primary health centers across Paschim Bardhaman district in West Bengal. Materials and methods We conducted 28 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with four groups of healthcare providers (allopathic doctors, informal health providers, nurses, and pharmacy shopkeepers) as well as patients accessing care at primary health centers and hospitals across Paschim Bardhaman district. Qualitative data was analyzed using the framework method in an inductive and deductive manner. Results Our results indicate that patients demand antibiotics from healthcare providers and seek the fastest cure possible, which influences the prescription choices of healthcare providers, particularly informal health providers. Many allopathic doctors provide antibiotics without any clinical indication due to inconsistent follow up, lack of testing facilities, risk of secondary infections, and unhygienic living conditions. Pharmaceutical company representatives actively network with informal health providers and formal healthcare providers alike, and regularly visit providers even in remote areas to market newer antibiotics. Allopathic doctors and informal health providers frequently blame the other party for being responsible for antibiotic resistance, and yet both display interdependence in referring patients to one another. Conclusions A holistic approach to curbing antibiotic resistance in West Bengal and other parts of India should focus on strengthening the capacity of the existing public health system to deliver on its promises, improving patient education and counseling, and including informal providers and pharmaceutical company representatives in community-level antibiotic stewardship efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2954958859,"The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is often a commonly disrupted pathway in human cancer and, therefore, it is widely exploited for cancer therapy. The inhibitors for the important proteins of the pathway including PI3K and mTOR have been increasingly designed. The dual inhibitors targeting PI3K and mTOR both have proven to be more effective than those targeting single protein only. An orally-active compound XL765 is well established as PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor and have shown in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity against a variety of cancer types and is undergoing clinical trials. The present study explored the exact binding pose and the the interactive forces holding XL765 within the active sites of PI3Kγ and mTOR using molecular docking analyses. The XL765 interacting residues of both the proteins were delineated and the degree of participation in binding was estimated by various methods. In the process, among the interacting residues of PI3Kγ, the Lys-890 and the Met-953 were recognized as the key residues involved in XL765 binding. While, in mTOR case, the Trp-2239 was recognized as the key residue playing role in the XL765 binding. In order to explore the better inhibitors, the study also generated combinatorial chemical library by modifying the scaffold considered from XL765. The virtual screening of the generated compound library led to identification of six novel promising compounds proposed as PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitors. Thus, the present work will through light on the drug inhibitory mechanism of XL765 for PI3K and mTOR, and will also assist in designing novel efficacious drug candidates."
https://openalex.org/W2954482193,"Uranium (U) measurements in water, soil, and food related to gold mining activities in populated areas in Gauteng Province, South Africa, suggest the possibility of exposure levels that may lead to adverse health consequences, including cancer. Theoretical considerations on pathways of human uptake of significant exposures are plausible, but few data on directly measured human exposure are available. A cross-sectional study was conducted using human measurements to compare U levels with other settings around the globe (based on literature review), to explore potential exposure variability within the province, and to test the feasibility of recruiting subjects partially coming from vulnerable and difficult-to-reach populations. Wards of potentially high (HE) and low exposure (LE) were identified. Composite hair samples representing the respective local populations were collected from regular customers of selected barber shops over a period of 1-2 months. A total of 70 U concentrations were determined in 27 composite samples from 1332 individuals. U concentrations ranged from 31 μg/kg to 2524 μg/kg, with an arithmetic mean of 192 μg/kg (standard deviation, 310 μg/kg) and a median of 122 μg/kg. Although HE wards collectively showed higher U levels than LE wards (184 vs 134 μg/kg), differences were smaller than expected. In conclusion, detected U levels were higher than those from most other surveys of the general public. The barber-based approach was an efficient hair collection approach. Composite hair samples are not recommended, due to technical challenges in measuring U, and individual hair samples are needed in follow-up studies to determine predictors of exposure."

Fe-S cluster (Isc) and sulfur utilization factor (Suf) pathways are the key biosynthetic routes responsible for generating these Fe-S cluster prosthetic groups in Escherichia coli. Although Isc dominates under normal conditions, Suf takes over during periods of iron depletion and oxidative stress. Sulfur acquisition via these systems relies on the ability to remove sulfur from free cysteine using a cysteine desulfurase mechanism. In the Suf pathway, the dimeric SufS protein uses the cofactor pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) to abstract sulfur from free cysteine, resulting in the production of alanine and persulfide. Despite much progress, the stepwise mechanism by which this PLP-dependent enzyme operates remains unclear. Here, using rapid-mixing kinetics in conjunction with X-ray crystallography, we analyzed the pre-steady-state kinetics of this process while assigning early intermediates of the mechanism. We employed H123A and C364A SufS variants to trap Cys-aldimine and Cys-ketimine intermediates of the cysteine desulfurase reaction, enabling direct observations of these intermediates and associated conformational changes of the SufS active site. Of note, we propose that Cys-364 is essential for positioning the Cys-aldimine for Cα deprotonation, His-123 acts to protonate the Ala-enamine intermediate, and Arg-56 facilitates catalysis by hydrogen bonding with the sulfhydryl of Cys-aldimine. Our results, along with previous SufS structural findings, suggest a detailed model of the SufS-catalyzed reaction from Cys binding to C–S bond cleavage and indicate that Arg-56, His-123, and Cys-364 are critical SufS residues in this C–S bond cleavage pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2954953810,"Background The sensitivity and specificity of exercise testing have never been studied simultaneously against an objective quantification of arterial stenosis. Aims were to define the sensitivity and specificity of several exercise tests to detect peripheral artery disease (PAD), and to assess whether or not defined criteria defined in patients suspected of having a PAD show a difference dependent on the resting ABI. Methods In this prospective study, consecutive patients with exertional limb pain referred to our vascular center were included. All patients had an ABI, a treadmill exercise-oximetry test, a second treadmill test (both 10% slope; 3.2km/h speed) with post-exercise pressures, and a computed-tomography-angiography (CTA). The receiver-operating-characteristic curve was used to define a cut-off point corresponding to the best area under the curve (AUC; [CI95%]) to detect arterial stenosis ≥50% as determined by the CTA. Results Sixty-three patients (61+/-11 years-old) were included. Similar AUCs from 0.72[0.63–0.79] to 0.83[0.75–0.89] were found for the different tests in the overall population. To detect arterial stenosis ≥50%, cut-off values of ABI, post-exercise ABI, post-exercise ABI decrease, post-exercise ankle pressure decrease, and distal delta from rest oxygen pressure (DROP) index were ≤0.91, ≤0.52, ≥43%, ≥20mmHg and ≤-15mmHg, respectively (p<0.01). In the subset of patients with an ABI >0.91, cut-off values of post-exercise ABI decrease (AUC = 0.67[0.53–0.78]), and DROP (AUC = 0.67[0.53–0.78]) were ≥18.5%, and ≤-15mmHg respectively (p<0.05). Conclusion Resting ABI is as accurate as exercise testing in patients with exertional limb pain. Specific exercise testing cut-off values should be used in patients with normal ABI to diagnose PAD."
https://openalex.org/W2956034621,"Background System science approaches are increasingly used to explore complex public health problems. Quantitative methods, such as participatory dynamic simulation modelling, can mobilise knowledge to inform health policy decisions. However, the analytic and practical steps required to turn collaboratively developed, qualitative system maps into rigorous and policy-relevant quantified dynamic simulation models are not well described. This paper reports on the processes, interactions and decisions that occurred at the interface between modellers and end-user participants in an applied health sector case study focusing on diabetes in pregnancy. Methods An analysis was conducted using qualitative data from a participatory dynamic simulation modelling case study in an Australian health policy setting. Recordings of participatory model development workshops and subsequent meetings were analysed and triangulated with field notes and other written records of discussions and decisions. Case study vignettes were collated to illustrate the deliberations and decisions made throughout the model development process. Results The key analytic objectives and decision-making processes included: defining the model scope; analysing and refining the model structure to maximise local relevance and utility; reviewing and incorporating evidence to inform model parameters and assumptions; focusing the model on priority policy questions; communicating results and applying the models to policy processes. These stages did not occur sequentially; the model development was cyclical and iterative with decisions being re-visited and refined throughout the process. Storytelling was an effective strategy to both communicate and resolve concerns about the model logic and structure, and to communicate the outputs of the model to a broader audience. Conclusion The in-depth analysis reported here examined the application of participatory modelling methods to move beyond qualitative conceptual mapping to the development of a rigorously quantified and policy relevant, complex dynamic simulation model. The analytic objectives and decision-making themes identified provide guidance for interpreting, understanding and reporting future participatory modelling projects and methods."
https://openalex.org/W2955892127,"A progressive decline in upper limb function is associated with ageing and disease. In this cross-sectional study we assessed the performance of 367 healthy individuals aged of 20 to 95 years across a battery of upper limb clinical tests, which we have termed the upper limb Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA). The upper limb PPA was designed to quantify the performance of the multiple physiological domains important for adequate function in the upper extremities. Included are tests of muscle strength, unilateral movement and dexterity, position sense, skin sensation, bimanual coordination, arm stability, along with a functional task. We report age and gender normative values for each test. Test-retest reliability ranged from good to excellent in all tests (intra-class correlation coefficients from 0.65 to 0.98) with the exception of position sense (0.31). Ten of the thirteen tests revealed differences in performance between males and females, twelve showed a decline in performance with increasing age, and eight discriminated between older people with and without upper limb functional impairment. Furthermore, most tests showed good external validity with respect to age, an upper limb functional test and self-reported function. This profiling approach provides a reference range for clinical groups with upper limb sensory and motor impairments and may assist in identifying undiagnosed deficits in the general population. Furthermore, the tests are sufficiently reliable to detect motor impairments in people with compromised upper limb function and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions."

The objective of this work was to identify possible structural changes in humic molecules caused by a 2-year rotation of durum wheat with faba bean, lasted for a decade, and conducted with different agricultural practices in a Mediterranean soil. Humic acids (HA) were extracted at three depths (0–30, 30–60 and 60–90 cm) from a Mediterranean soil subjected to different tillage (no tillage, minimum tillage and conventional tillage), crops (faba bean and wheat), and fertilization. The changes in HA quality were assessed by several chemical (ash, yield and elemental analysis) and spectroscopic techniques (solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared and fluorescence). The results suggest that the different agronomic practices strongly affected the quality of HA. Smaller but more aromatic molecules were observed with depth, while the fertilization induced the formation of simpler and less aromatic molecules due to the enhanced decomposition processes. Under no tillage, more stable humic molecules were observed due to the less soil aeration, while under conventional tillage larger and more aromatic molecules were obtained. Compared to wheat, more aromatic and more oxidized but less complex molecules were observed after faba bean crop. The inorganic fertilization accelerates the decomposition of organic substances rather than their stabilization. At the end of each crop cycle, humic matter of different quality was isolated and this confirms the importance of the rotation practice to guarantee a diversification of the soil organic matter with time. Finally, no tillage induces the formation of more stable humic matter."
https://openalex.org/W2954216741,"Aims Guidelines divide patients with heart failure (HF) into 3 distinct groups based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) We used the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) to quantify the health-related quality of life in patients with HF. Methods Patients were stratified into three cohorts: preserved LVEF (>50%), mid-range LVEF (40–49%) and reduced LVEF (<40%). The MLHFQ scores were evaluated using one-way ANOVA, and differences were observed among the groups. The association of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class with the physical scores was analyzed by Spearman’s correlation analysis. The predictive utility of the total MLHFQ scores was assessed with Kaplan-Meier curves for death and HF-related hospitalization. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify the risk factors for prognosis. Internal reliability was assessed with Cronbach’s α. Results There were significant differences in the total MLHFQ scores and the MLHFQ subscale scores among the three groups (p<0.05). MLHFQ domains demonstrated high internal consistency among the three groups (Cronbach’s α = 0.92, 0.96 and 0.93). The MLHFQ physical subscale scores were significantly associated with NYHA class in HFrEF (r = 0.59, p<0.001) and HFmrEF patients (r = 0.537, p<0.001). The survival analysis indicated that there was a significant difference among the three groups regarding high MLHFQ scores (p = 0.038). In the groups with low MLHFQ scores, the HFmrEF group exhibited significantly increased rates of death and HF-related hospitalization compared with the HFpEF group (p = 0.035). Conclusions The features and clinical outcomes varied among heart failure patients with different EF values. The MLHFQ appears to be a valid and reliable measurement of health status and offers excellent prognostic ability."

In addition, such protocols are complex to transfer and reproduce between laboratories.Evaluate the clinical utility of a pre-spotted PCR plate (PSP) for a novel multigene (n = 51) blood-based gene expression diagnostic assay for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).A pilot study (n = 44; 8 controls and 36 NETs) was undertaken to compare CQ, normalized gene expression and algorithm-based output (NETest score). Gene expression was then evaluated between matched blood:tumor tissue samples (n = 7). Thereafter, two prospective sets (diagnostic: n = 167; clinical validation: n = 48, respectively) were evaluated for diagnostic and clinical utility value. Two independent molecular diagnostics facilities were used to assess assay reproducibility and inter-laboratory metrics. Samples were collected (per CLIA protocol) processed to mRNA and cDNA and then either run per standard assay (liquid primers) or on PSPs. Separately, matching plasma samples were analyzed for chromogranin A (CgA). Statistics included non-parametric testing, Pearson-concordance, Predictive Modeling and AUROC analyses.In the pilot study (n = 44), CQ values were highly concordant (r: 0.82, p<0.0001) and normalized gene expression data significantly related (p<0.0001) (Pearson-pairwise correlation). NETest values were not different (49.7±33 standard vs. 48.5±31.5 PSP) and the overall concordance in output 96%. Predictive modelling confirmed this concordance (F1 score = 0.95). Gene expression levels were highly correlated between blood and tumor tissue (R: 0.71-0.83). In the diagnostic cohort (n = 30 controls, n = 87 non-NET controls, n = 50 NET), NETest was significantly lower (p<0.0001) in controls (11±6.5) and non-NET controls (13±18) than NETs (61±31). The AUROCs were 0.93-0.97 and the diagnostic accuracy was 90-97.5%. As a diagnostic, the PSP-NETest was significantly better than CgA (accuracy: 56%, p<0.0001). For clinical samples, the PSP generated robust and accurate (>96%) scores and was significantly better (p<0.0001) than CgA. The assay protocol was consistent (r: 0.97) and reproducible (co-efficient of variation: 1.3-4.2%) across the two facilities.The PSP protocol for the NETest has been established and prospectively tested in clinical samples. It is highly reproducible, has similar metrics (CV, categorization by control or NET) to the standard PCR assay and generates clinically concordant (>96%) NETest results. Moreover, it functions significantly more accurately than CgA."
https://openalex.org/W2955592183,"The abnormal proliferation and migration of airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells contributes to airway remodeling during asthma. MiR-19a has been demonstrated to promote cell proliferation and angiogenesis of several cancer types by regulating the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway. Our previous study has shown that High-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) is involved in the pathogenesis of airway remodeling using a mouse model of chronic asthma. However, the effects of HMGB1 on proliferation and migration of ASM cells and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown.Human ASM cells were obtained by primary explant techniques. MiR-19a expression was evaluated using qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation and migration were evaluated by the CCK-8 and the transwell migration assays, respectively. Transfection studies of ASM cells were performed to identify the underlying mechanisms.HMGB1 stimulated ASM cell proliferation and migration in a dose-dependent manner. The expression levels of miR-19a and the PTEN and AKT signaling proteins were also modulated by HMGB1. Functional studies indicated that overexpression of miR-19a enhanced the proliferation and migration of ASM cells, whereas inhibition of miR-19a decreased the proliferation and migration of ASM cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that miR-19a negatively regulated PTEN expression and positively regulated p-AKT expression. MiR-19 only regulates the proliferation of HASM cells induced by HMGB1, but not PDGF, EGF, TGF-β1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-19 contributed to the promoting effects of HMGB1 on ASM cells by targeting PTEN 3'-UTR.Our results demonstrated that HMGB1 induced proliferation and migration of ASM cells via the miR-19a /PTEN/AKT axis and provided direct evidence on the role of HMGB1 in ASM cells proliferation in vitro. The present study further indicated that miR-19a may be explored as a potential novel therapeutic target to reverse proliferation and migration of ASM cells."
https://openalex.org/W2956003848,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 2 (PTPN2) is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells, where it negatively regulates growth factor and cytokine signaling. PTPN2 is an important regulator of hematopoiesis and immune/inflammatory responses, as evidenced by loss-of-function mutations of PTPN2 in leukemia and lymphoma and knockout mice studies. Benzene is an environmental chemical that causes hematological malignancies, and its hematotoxicity arises from its bioactivation in the bone marrow to electrophilic metabolites, notably 1,4-benzoquinone, a major hematotoxic benzene metabolite. Although the molecular bases for benzene-induced leukemia are not well-understood, it has been suggested that benzene metabolites alter topoisomerases II function and thereby significantly contribute to leukemogenesis. However, several studies indicate that benzene and its hematotoxic metabolites may also promote the leukemogenic process by reacting with other targets and pathways. Interestingly, alterations of cell-signaling pathways, such as Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), have been proposed to contribute to benzene-induced malignant blood diseases. We show here that 1,4-benzoquinone directly impairs PTPN2 activity. Mechanistic and kinetic experiments with purified human PTPN2 indicated that this impairment results from the irreversible formation (kinact = 645 m−1·s−1) of a covalent 1,4-benzoquinone adduct at the catalytic cysteine residue of the enzyme. Accordingly, cell experiments revealed that 1,4-benzoquinone exposure irreversibly inhibits cellular PTPN2 and concomitantly increases tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and expression of STAT1-regulated genes. Our results provide molecular and cellular evidence that 1,4-benzoquinone covalently modifies key signaling enzymes, implicating it in benzene-induced malignant blood diseases.

These studies highlight the important role of PTPN2 in hematopoiesis, inflammation, and immune response. In this work, we show that 1,4-benzoquinone, the prime hematotoxic metabolite of benzene, is an irreversible inhibitor of PTPN2. Kinetic and biochemical analyses using purified human PTPN2 indicated that this irreversible inhibition of the enzyme is mainly due to rapid arylation of its catalytic cysteine by 1,4-benzoquinone. Further studies in cells expressing PTPN2 showed that exposure to 1,4-benzoquinone leads to the irreversible inhibition of the endogenous enzyme with a concomitant overactivation of the STAT1 signaling and subsequent alteration of the expression of STAT1-regulated genes. Altogether, our data provide the first evidence for the alteration of a key hematopoietic and immune signaling pathway by benzene. These findings shed a new light on our understanding of the mechanism by which benzene may induce hematological malignancies. The leukemogenic properties of benzene are known to rely on its bioactivation in the bone marrow into reactive metabolites, in particular 1,4-benzoquinone (1Smith M.T. Zhang L. McHale C.M.

This hematotoxic quinone arises in the bone marrow mainly from myeloperoxidase-catalyzed conversions of phenolic metabolites of benzene originating from the liver, mainly phenol (PH) and hydroquinone (HQ) (Fig. 1A) (2Snyder R.

As shown in Fig. 1B, we found that, contrary to the phenolic metabolites of benzene, 1,4-benzoquinone inhibited PTPN2 phosphatase activity (IC50 = 1 μm). Whereas full inhibition of the enzyme was observed with low micromolar concentrations of 1,4-benzoquinone (2 μm), no significant effects were observed with phenol and hydroquinone even at concentrations 2 orders of magnitude higher (200 μm). To confirm that 1,4-benzoquinone inhibits PTPN2, an in vitro myeloperoxidase (MPO) activation system that mimics the bioactivation of hydroquinone into 1,4-benzoquinone in the bone marrow was used as described previously (9Frantz C.E. Chen H. Eastmond D.A. Inhibition of human topoisomerase II in vitro by bioactive benzene metabolites.Environ.

In the presence of a functional MPO activation system (MPO, hydroquinone, and H2O2) able to convert hydroquinone into 1,4-benzoquinone, PTPN2 activity was fully inhibited (Fig. 1C). Conversely, in reactions containing inactive MPO, no inhibition of PTPN2 was found (Fig. 1C), thus confirming that this tyrosine phosphatase is sensitive to 1,4-benzoquinone but not the phenolic metabolites of benzene. 1,4-Benzoquinone is known to arylate directly protein thiol groups through Michael addition (35Bolton J.L.

This arylating ability of 1,4-benzoquinone is considered as a major mechanism responsible for the toxicological effects of this quinone, in particular in the bone marrow (1Smith M.T. Zhang L.

Moreover, the covalent binding of 1,4-benzoquinone to PTPN2 was accompanied by the concomitant loss of cysteine labeling by fluorescein-iodoacetamide (IAF), thus supporting that 1,4-benzoquinone arylation occurs on cysteine residues of PTPN2 (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2C, the activity of 1,4-benzoquinone–inhibited PTPN2 could not be recovered by dialysis nor by DTT treatment, further supporting the irreversible covalent nature of the reaction between 1,4-benzoquinone and PTPN2 cysteine residues. As shown in Fig. S1, we found that inhibition of PTPN2 by 1,4-benzoquinone was inhibited by GSH, a major physiological reducing agent known to react with 1,4-benzoquinone (35Bolton J.L. Dunlap T.

To further ascertain that inhibition of PTPN2 relies on the arylating ability of 1,4-benzoquinone but not on redox cycling mechanisms (that generate reactive oxygen species), the inhibition assays were carried out in the presence of catalase and/or superoxide dismutase as described previously (41Verrax J.

TAS2R46 is an unexplored subtype that responds to its highly specific agonist absinthin. Here, we first demonstrate that, unlike other bitter-taste receptor agonists, absinthin alone (1 μm) in ASM cells does not induce Ca2+ signals but reduces histamine-induced cytosolic Ca2+ increases. To investigate this mechanism, we introduced into ASM cells aequorin-based Ca2+ probes targeted to the cytosol, subplasma membrane domain, or the mitochondrial matrix. We show that absinthin reduces cytosolic histamine-induced Ca2+ rises and simultaneously increases Ca2+ influx into mitochondria. We found that this effect is inhibited by the potent human TAS2R46 (hTAS2R46) antagonist 3β-hydroxydihydrocostunolide and is no longer evident in hTAS2R46-silenced ASM cells, indicating that it is hTAS2R46-dependent. Furthermore, these changes were sensitive to the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl-hydrazone (FCCP); the mitochondrial calcium uniporter inhibitor KB-R7943 (carbamimidothioic acid); the cytoskeletal disrupter latrunculin; and an inhibitor of the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC), ESI-09. Similarly, the β2 agonist salbutamol also could induce Ca2+ shuttling from cytoplasm to mitochondria, suggesting that this new mechanism might be generalizable. Moreover, forskolin and an EPAC activator mimicked this effect in HeLa cells.

Bitter tasting compounds dilate airways by inhibiting airway smooth muscle calcium oscillations and calcium sensitivity.Br. J.

In the present manuscript, we focused on hTAS2R46, an unexplored hTAS2R subtype receptor in ASM (13Liggett S.B.

An extensive structure-function analysis of this subtype has been performed (20Brockhoff A. Behrens M. Massarotti A. Appendino G. Meyerhof W.

We now report that absinthin per se does not induce Ca2+ rises but significantly reduces the cytosolic Ca2+ rise induced by histamine in ASM. This reduction is not a consequence of reduced influx through the plasma membrane nor of a decrease in Ca2+ efflux from the endoplasmic reticulum, but is a consequence of an increased Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria. Indeed, cytosolic Ca2+ decreases and simultaneous mitochondrial Ca2+ increases were sensitive to the nonspecific mitochondrial calcium uptake inhibitor carbamimidothioic acid (KB-R7943), to the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-hydrazone (FCCP), to the selective hTAS2R46 inhibitor 3β-hydroxydihydrocostunolide (3HDC) (7Brockhoff A.

Furthermore, the effect of absinthin was no longer evident in hTAS2R46-silenced cells. Our observation that absinthin, activating hTAS2R46, modulates histamine-induced cytosol Ca2+ rises by potentiating mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake shows that regulated mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake may participate in the encoding of Ca2+ signals. We also provide data that this ER-to-mitochondria shuttling may be a general feature of Ca2+ signaling as salbutamol, a β2-agonist, also reduces histamine-induced Ca2+ rises in the cytosol while simultaneously increasing mitochondrial calcium. First, we evaluated the effect of absinthin on Ca2+ rises in ASM. Although other bitter taste receptor ligands have been shown to increase cytosolic Ca2+ (11Deshpande D.A. Wang W.C. McIlmoyle E.L. Robinett K.S. Schillinger R.M. An S.S. Sham J.S. Liggett S.B. Bitter taste receptors on airway smooth muscle bronchodilate by localized calcium signaling and reverse obstruction.Nat. Med. 2010; 16 (20972434): 1299-130410.1038/nm.2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), absinthin (10 μm) was unable to induce any Ca2+ rise (n = 7) (Fig. 1A). We next evaluated the effect of absinthin on the Ca2+-rise induced by one of the most potent bronchoconstrictors, histamine (10 μm). As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, histamine induced a rapid Ca2+ rise, as determined by Fura-2. The simultaneous co-addition of absinthin, surprisingly, led to a significantly lower histamine-induced Ca2+ peak. This effect was evident when pooling the data together but was just as evident at the single cell level in fluorescence microscopy (data not shown). Because histamine-induced Ca2+ rises are the result of an initial Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and a secondary Ca2+ entry, we performed experiments in a Ca2+-free extracellular buffer to dissect the two components. As demonstrated in Fig. 1B, histamine induced a cytosolic Ca2+ rise in this condition, which was of lower amplitude compared with the previous condition. Yet, absinthin was still able to significantly reduce the effect of histamine. Absinthin is reported to bind different bitter taste receptor subtypes, although it is generally thought to act mainly on hTAS2R46 (6Meyerhof W. Batram C. Kuhn C. Brockhoff A. Chudoba E. Bufe B. Appendino G. Behrens M. The molecular receptive ranges of human TAS2R bitter taste receptors.Chem. Senses. 2010; 35 (20022913): 157-17010.1093/chemse/bjp092Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated whether hTAS2R46 was present in our cellular model. Indeed, RT-PCR experiments showed that mRNA coding for this subtype was present in ASM, although at lower levels compared with human bronchial muscle and human epithelial tongue (Fig. S1A). This was confirmed also by Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry of ASM with specific antibodies (Fig. S1, B–F). We next evaluated whether 3HDC, a potent antagonist of hTAS2R46 (7Brockhoff A. Behrens M. Roudnitzky N. Appendino G. Avonto C. Meyerhof W. Receptor agonism and antagonism of dietary bitter compounds.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31 (21994393): 14775-1478210.1523/JNEUROSCI.2923-11.2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), was able to revert the effect of absinthin on histamine-induced Ca2+ rises. As shown in Fig. 1C, 3HDC dose-dependently reverted the effect of absinthin, with concentrations of 10 μm abolishing completely the effect of the agonist. To further determine the specificity of this effect, we performed experiments in HeLa cells that are devoid of hTAS2R46 (Fig. S1B) but that have phospholipase C-coupled histamine receptors (22Sauvé R. Diarra A. Chahine M. Simoneau C. Morier N. Roy G. Ca2+ oscillations induced by histamine H1 receptor stimulation in HeLa cells: Fura-2 and patch clamp analysis.Cell Calcium. 1991; 12 (2059991): 165-17610.1016/0143-4160(91)90018-ACrossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, absinthin was unable to affect histamine-induced Ca2+ rises in HeLa cells, even at high concentrations (100 μm). Last, we made use of shRNA to confirm that it was indeed hTAS2R46 mediating the absinthin response. The use of shRNA led to a decrease of the mRNA encoding for the receptor in ASM cells of 90 ± 2.5% (as determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting) compared with control ASM cells (Fig. S1, A and B). In cells with a significantly reduced level of hTAS2R46, absinthin was unable to reduce histamine-induced cytosolic Ca2+ rises (Fig. 1E). These data demonstrated that absinthin reduced cytosolic Ca2+-rises induced by histamine by a receptor-specific mechanism mediated by hTAS2R46. This effect occurs rapidly and appears to affect the Ca2+-release component of the rise, given that it is apparent also in Ca2+-free conditions. To evaluate whether the Ca2+-entry component of the histamine-induced Ca2+ rise was also affected, we decided to use aequorin-based probes that can be targeted selectively to subcellular compartments. At first, we confirmed the effect of absinthin on histamine-induced Ca2+ rises using a nontargeted cytosolic aequorin (cytAEQ) (23Brini M. Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Targeted recombinant aequorins: Tools for monitoring [Ca2+] in the various compartments of a living cell.Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 46 (10504215): 380-38910.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19990915)46:6%3C380::AID-JEMT6%3E3.0.CO;2-YCrossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In accordance with what was observed with Fura-2, absinthin dampened the peak of the Ca2+ rise in a significant manner (Fig. 2A). We next decided to evaluate whether Ca2+ entry was affected by using an aequorin probe directed to the subplasma membrane compartment (pmAEQ) (24Lim D. Bertoli A. Sorgato M.C. Moccia F. Generation and usage of aequorin lentiviral vectors for Ca2+ measurement in sub-cellular compartments of hard-to-transfect cells.Cell Calcium. 2016; 59 (26992273): 228-23910.1016/j.ceca.2016.03.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Marsault R. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Domains of high Ca2+ beneath the plasma membrane of living A7r5 cells.EMBO J. 1997; 16 (9130702): 1575-158110.1093/emboj/16.7.1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In this instance, histamine-induced Ca2+ entry was not affected by the co-addition of absinthin (Fig. 2B). To further confirm that Ca2+ entry was not involved, we performed a store depletion experiment investigating cytosolic calcium via Fura-2. Stores were depleted with tBHQ (50 μm) in a calcium-free solution and calcium was re-added after 5 min in the presence or absence of absinthin. As shown in Fig. S2, absinthin was unable to affect the extent of store-operated Ca2+ entry. These data therefore suggest that absinthin targets selectively the intracellular store component of histamine-induced Ca2+ rises. To reconcile the above, partly contradictory observations on absinthin (i.e. a decreased cytosolic calcium rise together with an unchanged Ca2+ entry), we inquired whether mitochondrial Ca2+ in response to histamine would change in accord to cytosolic Ca2+. If absinthin dampens Ca2+ release via IP3R modulation or via IP3 production, it would be expected that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in the presence of absinthin after stimulation with histamine should be lowered as well. To test this hypothesis, we used an aequorin probe that targets selectively the mitochondrial matrix (mitAEQ) (24Lim D. Bertoli A. Sorgato M.C. Moccia F. Generation and usage of aequorin lentiviral vectors for Ca2+ measurement in sub-cellular compartments of hard-to-transfect cells.Cell Calcium. 2016; 59 (26992273): 228-23910.1016/j.ceca.2016.03.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W. Brini M. Pozzan T.

As shown in Fig. 3A, stimulation of cells with histamine provoked an increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ (27Paillard M. Tubbs E. Thiebaut P.A. Gomez L. Fauconnier J. Da Silva C.C. Teixeira G. Mewton N. Belaidi E. Durand A. Abrial M. Lacampagne A. Rieusset J. Ovize M.

In striking contrast to the effect on cytosolic Ca2+, the histamine-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ rise in the presence of absinthin was significantly greater compared with histamine alone (Fig. 3A). The above data appeared to suggest that the reduced cytosolic Ca2+ rise is paralleled by a paradoxical increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, i.e. it would suggest that histamine-induced Ca2+ release is unaffected by absinthin, but the Ca2+ is channeled to the mitochondria and not to the cytosol. If this were the case, it would be expected that disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential, which drives Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), with FCCP, and thereby not permitting mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, should block the Ca2+ increase in mitochondria induced by histamine in the presence of absinthin and simultaneously restore the histamine-Ca2+ rise in the cytosol. Indeed, when FCCP was used, this resulted in a significantly reduced Ca2+ rise in mitochondria (Fig. 3A) and an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ rise that was equivalent, if not greater, to histamine alone (Fig. 3B). Subplasmalemmal Ca2+, on the contrary, was unchanged, suggesting that the extent of mitochondrial uptake does not influence Ca2+ entry via the plasma membrane (Fig. 3C). Ca2+-uptake in mitochondria is mediated by MCU, a protein complex whose main components have been recently identified (28De Stefani D. Raffaello A. Teardo E. Szabò I. Rizzuto R. A forty-kilodalton protein of the inner membrane is the mitochondrial calcium uniporter.Nature. 2011; 476 (21685888): 336-34010.1038/nature10230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar, 29Mishra J.

Pharmacol. 2017; 240 (28194521): 129-15610.1007/164_2017_1Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the presence of KB-R7943, a nonspecific inhibitor of the uniporter (30Santo-Domingo J. Vay L. Hernández-Sanmiguel E. Lobatón C.D. Moreno A. Montero M. Alvarez J. The plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchange inhibitor KB-R7943 is also a potent inhibitor of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 151 (17471180): 647-65410.1038/sj.bjp.0707260Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the effect of absinthin on histamine-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ rises was abolished (Fig. 3A), as was the effect on cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 3B), whereas again no difference was perceivable in subplasmalemmal Ca2+ (Fig. 3C). FCCP or KB-R7943 alone did not affect basal Ca2+ or Ca2+ signals induced by histamine (Fig. S3, A–D). The above data would suggest that absinthin signals to the mitochondria to increase the uptake of the Ca2+ released from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). If this were the case, it could be expected that disrupting the ER-mitochondria juxtapositions would, at least in part, abolish the effect of absinthin. To this extent, we pre-incubated cells with latrunculin, a natural compound that disrupts the actin cytoskeleton thereby uncoupling organelle cross talk (31Marchi S. Patergnani S. Pinton P. The endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria connection: One touch, multiple functions.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1837 (24211533): 461-46910.1016/j.bbabio.2013.10.015Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). As observed in Fig. 4A, in cells pre-incubated with latrunculin, the cytosolic Ca2+ rises induced by histamine were similar in the presence or absence of absinthin in the cytosol (Fig. 4A; see Fig. 1 for traces in the absence of absinthin) under the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B) and in mitochondria (Fig. 4C). We reasoned that absinthin might modify the mitochondrial potential, and this might then be responsible for the increased mitochondrial accumulation. To test for this, we used the JC-1 probe, but found no difference of mitochondrial membrane potential in the presence or absence of absinthin (Fig. S4A). Next, we investigated whether an increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ during this time frame could significantly increase cytosolic ATP levels. If this were the case, it could be expected that extruding mechanisms could be more efficient and it could account for part of the drop in cytosolic Ca2+. As shown in Fig. S4B, absinthin, unlike the positive control FCCP, was unable to modify significantly ATP to ADP ratios. To evaluate whether other plasma membrane receptor agonists were able to trigger a similar mechanism, we investigated the Ca2+ response of histamine in the presence of a β2 agonist, the most widely used bronchodilators in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. As expected, salbutamol (10 μm) lowered the Ca2+ rise induced by histamine (Fig. 5A). This has been reported previously and has been attributed to a number of cAMP- and PKA-dependent effects, including IP3 receptor modulation (32Billington C.K. Penn R.B. Hall I.P. β2 Agonists.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2017; 237 (27878470): 23-4010.1007/164_2016_64Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, though, histamine-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ increased significantly also in the presence of salbutamol (Fig. 5A). Given that β2 receptors are coupled to cAMP formation, we attempted to reproduce the effect with forskolin (10 μm). In the presence of forskolin, cytosolic histamine–induced Ca2+ rises were significantly blunted (Fig. 5A). When evaluating mitochondrial calcium, the concentration was also blunted, although not to the same extent (Fig. 5A). Yet, the effect of a strong cAMP production induced by forskolin prevented firm conclusions. From the data on forskolin and, more importantly on salbutamol, it would appear that a cAMP-dependent pathway may control ER to mitochondria Ca2+ shuttling. It has been recently reported that Epac1 is localized on the mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix (and may control MCU activity) (33Fazal L. Laudette M. Paula-Gomes S. Pons S. Conte C. Tortosa F.

https://openalex.org/W2954705763,"Activation of ionotropic P2X receptors increases free intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) by initiating transmembrane cation flux. We studied the a and k splice variants of the rat purinergic P2X7 receptor (rP2X7aR and rP2X7kR) to exhibit significant difference in Ca2+ flux through this channel. This difference is surprising because the variants share absolute sequence identity in the area of the pore that defines ionic selectivity. Here, we used patch-clamp fluorometry and chimeric receptors to show that the fraction of the total current carried by Ca2+ is function of the primary sequence of the cytoplasmic N terminus. Using scanning mutagenesis, we identified five sites within the N terminus that respond to mutagenesis with decrease in fractional calcium current and an increase in permeability to the polyatomic cation, N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG+), relative to Na+ (PNMDG/PNa). We tested the hypothesis that these sites line the permeation pathway by measuring the ability of thiol-reactive MTSET+ to alter the current of cysteine-substituted variants, but we detected no effect. Finally, we studied the homologous sites of the rat P2X2 receptor (rP2X2R) and observed that substitutions at Glu17 significantly reduced the fractional calcium current. Taken together, our results suggest that change in the structure of the N terminus alters the ability of an intra-pore Ca2+ selectivity filter to discriminate among permeating cations. These results are noteworthy for two reasons: they identify previously unknown outcome of mutagenesis of the N-terminal domain, and they suggest caution when assigning structure to function for truncated P2X receptors that lack part of the N terminus."
https://openalex.org/W2955424745,"The extent to which people are aware of their emotional experiences, label them and communicate them to the outside world are considered to impact emotional experience itself and potentially people's depressive symptom levels. All of these aspects are important elements of one of the most common methods to study and measure emotions in the context of daily life, the so-called experience sampling method (ESM). A straightforward question that arises when using this method is whether participating in ESM may bring about changes in the momentary emotional self-reports of the people engaging in it, thereby effectively influencing that what it intends to measure; emotional experience over time, and whether this would relate to average levels of depressive symptoms. To examine these questions, we conducted a 7-day ESM study in which 90 participants were randomly assigned to repeatedly report either positive emotions only, negative emotions only or non-emotional internal states only, course using smartphones. Participants also completed pre-, post- and follow-up measurements of levels of depressive symptoms. Results showed no significant impact on self-reported momentary emotions, respective to their condition, over time nor on average levels of depressive symptoms across groups. These findings suggest that the repeated assessment of emotions in daily life, over the course of seven days, does not impact their emotional experience over time nor levels of depressive symptoms."

Osteogenesis is a complex multistep process, and it is likely that CLCF1 plays a role in cellular transitions. Differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts can be induced in vitro (12Cheng S.L. Yang J.W. Rifas L. Zhang S.F. Avioli L.V. Differentiation of human bone marrow osteogenic stromal cells in vitro: induction of the osteoblast phenotype by dexamethasone.Endocrinology. 1994; 134 (8275945): 277-28610.1210/endo.134.1.8275945Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To further investigate the effect of CLCF1 on osteogenesis, we examined the capacity of CLCF1 to bind, activate JAK/STAT signaling, and regulate osteoblastic differentiation in mouse MSCs. To assess whether CLCF1 has the potential to modulate MSC fate, we analyzed the binding of biotinylated CLCF1 to the nonhematopoietic (CD45−) mouse bone marrow cell fraction that comprises MSCs. Flow cytometry analysis of primary bone marrow cells incubated with biotinylated CLCF1 showed that 15–20% of the CD45− cells bind CLCF1 (Fig. 1A). To investigate the expression of CLCF1 receptors by MSCs, we expanded bone marrow cells under conditions favoring MSC growth to near homogeneity (≥99% CD45− and ≥99% Sca1+; Fig. S1). A distinct binding could be observed on a large fraction of the in vitro–expanded MSCs (Fig. 1B). CLCF1 is a ligand for CNTFR (3Elson G.C. Lelièvre E. Guillet C. Chevalier S. Plun-Favreau H.

As CNTFR activation by CLCF1 induces STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation (3Elson G.C. Lelièvre E. Guillet C. Chevalier S. Plun-Favreau H. Froger J. Suard I. de Coignac A.B. Delneste Y. Bonnefoy J.Y.

Up-regulation of both STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation could be detected in response to CLCF1, and this up-regulation was inhibited by the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib (Fig. 2, A–C). We compared CLCF1 with LIF, a cytokine that activates the signaling chains of the CNTFR (18Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Stahl N. Pan L. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. LIFR β and gp130 as heterodimerizing signal transducers of the tripartite CNTF receptor.Science. 1993; 260 (8390097): 1805-180810.1126/science.8390097Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 19Ip N.Y.

Dose–response experiments indicate that CLCF1 is less potent than LIF in triggering STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Whereas these results did not discriminate between the known CLCF1 receptors, they indicate that CLCF1 induces the activation of a prototypic cytokine JAK/STAT signaling in MSCs that could influence their differentiation. To investigate whether CLCF1 activates MSCs via CNTFR, we used a derivative with site I inactivated by a W94A substitution (20Perret D. Guillet C. Elson G. Froger J. Plun-Favreau H. Rousseau F. Chabbert M. Gauchat J.F. Gascan H. Two different contact sites are recruited by cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) to generate the CLC/CLF and CLC/sCNTFRα composite cytokines.J. Biol.

Unlike WT CLCF1, CLCF1-mut1 does not bind or activate Ba/F3 transfectants expressing CNTFR (Fig. S2). We observed that CLCF1-mut1 could still bind MSCs (Fig. 1B) and induce STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). To investigate whether CLCF1 binds MSCs via sortilin, we down-regulated sortilin expression in MSCs by RNAi. Whereas sortilin mRNA levels were reduced by 88% in MSCs transfected with sortilin-specific siRNA, no effect on the binding of CLCF1-mut1 could be observed (Fig. S3). Altogether, these results suggest that CLCF1 activates an alternative, so far elusive receptor on MSCs (21Tormo A.J. Letellier M.C. Lissilaa R. Batraville L.A. Sharma M. Ferlin W. Elson G. Crabé S.

We next examined whether CLCF1 modulates the mRNA levels of transcription factors involved in osteoblast differentiation using quantitative RT-PCR. We compared MSC cultured under conditions inducing osteogenesis in the absence or presence of CLCF1 (Fig. 3). As expected, the mRNA levels of osterix, Runx2, and Dlx5, three transcription factors implicated in osteoblast differentiation (22Heo J.S. Lee S.G. Kim H.O.

The up-regulation of these transcription factors was markedly reduced in the presence of CLCF1 (Fig. 3). The observed effect was specific, as the level of the nuclear receptor PPARγ mRNA, involved in adipocyte differentiation (25Hegele R.A. Cao H. Frankowski C. Mathews S.T. Leff T. PPARG F388L, a transactivation-deficient mutant, in familial partial lipodystrophy.Diabetes. 2002; 51 (12453919): 3586-359010.2337/diabetes.51.12.3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) was unaffected by the presence of CLCF1 (Fig. 3). We also examined whether CLCF1 regulates the expression of mRNA encoding osteoclastogenesis-related factors. We observed that CLCF1 down-regulated the mRNA levels of osteoprotegrin (OPG), an osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor (26Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Yasuda H. Mizuno A. Itoh K. Ueno Y. Shinki T. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Higashio K. Suda T. Osteoprotegerin produced by osteoblasts is an important regulator in osteoclast development and function.Endocrinology. 2000; 141 (10965921): 3478-348410.1210/endo.141.9.7634Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), in MSCs cultured in either normal or osteogenic conditions. CLCF1 significantly up-regulated the osteoclast differentiation factor RANKL mRNA levels in MSCs expanded in normal medium but not in MSCs maintained in osteogenic conditions (Fig. 3). The up-regulation of the mRNA levels of the osteoblast markers alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin was also reduced when the osteoblast differentiation was induced in the presence of CLCF1 (Fig. 3). To analyze whether this was associated with a reduction of mineralization, we quantified osteogenesis using alizarin red S staining (Fig. 4, A and B). A striking decrease of the staining was observed in MSC cultures in which osteoblast differentiation was induced in the presence of CLCF1. Alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of osteogenic differentiation involved in bone mineralization (27Siffert R.S. The role of alkaline phosphatase in osteogenesis.J. Exp. Med. 1951; 93 (14832392): 415-42610.1084/jem.93.5.415Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), was also reduced, albeit less markedly than hydroxyapatite deposit formation assessed by alizarin red S staining (Fig. 4C). CLCF1 also down-regulated the hydroxyapatite deposit formation in MSCs induced to differentiate into osteoblasts using BMP-2 stimulation in additional experiments. (Fig. 4D). We observed that CLCF1 binds MSCs and that CLCF1 promotes STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that these cells respond to this cytokine. We therefore investigated the effect of CLCF1 on the differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts in vitro. A significant down-regulation of the expression of mRNA coding for osterix, Runx2, and Dlx5, the three transcription factors that regulate osteoblast differentiation (22Heo J.S. Lee S.G. Kim H.O.

CLCF1 also inhibited the expression of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase mRNA, two markers of osteoblastic differentiation. We also observed that CLCF1 inhibited expression of OPG, an osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor (26Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Yasuda H. Mizuno A. Itoh K. Ueno Y. Shinki T. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Higashio K. Suda T.

In line with these effects, CLCF1 markedly reduced mineralization and alkaline phosphatase activity. Our results are in accordance with previous reports regarding the effect of CLCF1 on osterix expression and mineralization in primary calvarial osteoblasts. The effects of CLCF1 on MSCs were more extensive than those reported (10McGregor N.E. Poulton I.J. Walker E.C. Pompolo S. Quinn J.M. Martin T.J. Sims N.A. Ciliary neurotrophic factor inhibits bone formation and plays a sex-specific role in bone growth and remodeling.Calcif.

Our observations further indicate that CLCF1, like CNTF, differs from LIF, cardiotrophin-1, oncostatin M, and neuropoietin, the other cytokines signaling through LIFRβ and gp130, in its effect on osteogenesis (28Pasquin S. Sharma M. Gauchat J.F. Cytokines of the LIF/CNTF family and metabolism.Cytokine. 2016; 82 (26817395): 122-12410.1016/j.cyto.2015.12.019Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Our observation that CLCF1 site I inactivation does not prevent MSC activation indicates that the recruited receptor does not comprise CNTFRα. We hypothesized that CLCF1 and CNTF may exert distinctive roles through sortilin, as both bind this alternative receptor (13Larsen J.V. Hansen M. Møller B. Madsen P. Scheller J. Nielsen M. Petersen C.M. Sortilin facilitates signaling of ciliary neurotrophic factor and related helical type 1 cytokines targeting the gp130/leukemia inhibitory factor receptor β heterodimer.Mol. Cell.

Sortilin is upregulated during osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and promotes extracellular matrix mineralization.J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 193 (12209882): 73-7910.1002/jcp.10151Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Binding experiments with MSCs depleted from sortilin mRNA using siRNA transfection suggest that the CLCF1-binding receptor on MSCs is not sortilin either and remains to be identified, as is the one involved in the immunomodulatory roles of this cytokine (21Tormo A.J. Letellier M.C. Lissilaa R. Batraville L.A. Sharma M. Ferlin W. Elson G. Crabé S. Gauchat J.F.

Nonetheless, CLCF1 binds MSCs, induces JAK/STAT signaling, and regulates MSC differentiation. As MSCs can be induced to generate several cell lineages besides osteoblasts, such as adipocytes, chondrocytes, myocytes, and neuron-like cells (29Kuznetsov S.A. Krebsbach P.H. Satomura K. Kerr J.

Factors produced by bone marrow MSCs in response to CLCF1 could contribute to the indirect effect of CLCF1 on hematopoietic cells. In conclusion, our results indicate that CLCF1 can influence MSC differentiation and confirm that it regulates osteogenesis in vitro, indicating a new facet of activities for this cytokine. All procedures conformed to the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Université de Montréal (CDEA). Tibiae and femora of C57BL/6 female mice purchased from Charles River Laboratories were dissected and washed with PBS. Bone marrows were flushed using AMEM medium (Wisent Bioproducts, Saint-Jean-Baptiste, Quebec, Canada) containing 10% FBS, 4 mm l-glutamine, 1 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The recovered cells were incubated in a 100-mm Petri dish at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 5 days. The MSC isolation and expansion protocol was adapted from Huang et al. (37Huang S. Xu L.

MSCs were then stimulated for 15 min with LIF (PeproTech), recombinant murine CLCF1 (100 ng/ml), or recombinant CLCF1-mut1 (100 ng/ml). CLCF1 and CLCF1-mut1 were produced, purified, and tested as described previously (38Pasquin S. Chehboun S. Dejda A. Meliani Y. Savin V. Warner G.J. Bosse R. Tormo A. Mayer G. Sharma M. Sapieha P.

Control wells contained nonsupplemented AMEM medium. CLCF1 was used at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. MSCs incubated for 3 weeks in control or osteogenic medium were washed three times and fixed for 1 h in PBS, 4% formaldehyde. The fixed cells were then washed three times with water, stained in 40 mm alizarin red S (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 4.1–4.3, for 20 min, and washed with water. Staining was analyzed by microscopy.

The absorbance (A570 nm) of the extracts diluted 1:5 was assessed using a Viktor2 microplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Woodbridge, Canada). MSCs incubated for 3 weeks in control or osteogenic medium were washed with PBS and lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The cell lysates were scraped and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. Cell lysate aliquots were incubated at a 5:100 ratio with p-nitrophenyl phosphate liquid substrate (N7653, Sigma-Aldrich). The reactions were stopped using 25 μl of 3 m NaOH, and A405 nm was measured. Protein concentration of cell lysates was quantified using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MSCs incubated for 3 weeks in control or osteogenic medium were detached, and total RNA was isolated using TRIzolTM (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA was further purified using RNeasy Mini Kit columns (Qiagen). RNA concentrations were measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA integrity was assessed using a BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies). A high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) was used to generate the cDNA using aliquots of 1 μg of RNA as template.

https://openalex.org/W2953995325,"Introduction Right ventricular (RV) myocardial dysfunction is a common feature in septic shock. It can worsen outcome, but the etiology is poorly understood. Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) plays a part in the pathogenesis of the right heart dysfunction in sepsis but its importance is unknown. In pigs, PAH in sepsis is substantial and the translational value of porcine sepsis models therefore questioned. We hypothesized that porcine sepsis causes a myocardial inflammatory response which leads to myocardial dysfunction independent of PAH. Materials and methods Sepsis was induced by Escherichia coli-infusion in 10 pigs resulting in PAH and increased right ventricular pressure (RVP). The same degree of RVP was achieved by external pulmonary artery banding (PAB) in a consecutive series of 6 animals. Results Sepsis, but not PAB, led to increase in endothelial damage marker PAI-1 and cytokines TNF and IL-6 (all p<0.05) in plasma. In myocardium, TNF and IL-6 were significantly elevated in sepsis, TNF in both ventricles and IL-6 mostly in RV, while IL-1β, IL-18 and C5a were significantly higher in RV compared to LV after PAB (all p<0.05). Myocardial mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, IP-10, E-selectin and PAI-1 were significantly elevated in RV and LV during sepsis compared to PAB, while Caspase-1 was decreased in septic compared to PAB animals (all p<0.05). Cathepsin L activity was increased in RV by PAB, while sepsis inhibited this response. Escherichia coli-induced sepsis caused myocardial inflammation independent of PAH. Conclusion Prominent PAH should therefore not exclude porcine sepsis models to further our understanding of human sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2953967257,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is an important cause of heritable vision loss. Mutations affecting mitochondrial bioenergetics may lead to isolated vision loss or life-threatening systemic disease, depending on a mutation’s severity. Primary optic nerve atrophy resulting from death of retinal ganglion cells is the most prominent ocular manifestation of mitochondrial disease. However, dysfunction of other retinal cell types has also been described, sometimes leading to a loss of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium that manifests clinically as pigmentary retinopathy. A popular mouse model of mitochondrial disease that lacks NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S4 (NDUFS4), a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, phenocopies many traits of the human disease Leigh syndrome, including the development of optic atrophy. It has also been reported that ndufs4−/− mice display diminished light responses at the level of photoreceptors or bipolar cells. By conducting electroretinography (ERG) recordings in live ndufs4−/− mice, we now demonstrate that this defect occurs at the level of retinal photoreceptors. We found that this deficit does not arise from retinal developmental anomalies, photoreceptor degeneration, or impaired regeneration of visual pigment. Strikingly, the impairment of ndufs4−/− photoreceptor function was not observed in ex vivo ERG recordings from isolated retinas, indicating that photoreceptors with complex I deficiency are intrinsically capable of normal signaling. The difference in electrophysiological phenotypes in vivo and ex vivo suggests that the energy deprivation associated with severe mitochondrial impairment in the outer retina renders ndufs4−/− photoreceptors unable to maintain the homeostatic conditions required to operate at their normal capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2955110277,"The limited sodium availability of freshwater and terrestrial environments was a major physiological challenge during vertebrate evolution. The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is present in the apical membrane of sodium-absorbing vertebrate epithelia and evolved as part of a machinery for efficient sodium conservation. ENaC belongs to the degenerin/ENaC protein family and is the only member that opens without an external stimulus. We hypothesized that ENaC evolved from a proton-activated sodium channel present in ionocytes of freshwater vertebrates and therefore investigated whether such ancestral traits are present in ENaC isoforms of the aquatic pipid frog Xenopus laevis. Using whole-cell and single-channel electrophysiology of Xenopus oocytes expressing ENaC isoforms assembled from αβγ- or δβγ-subunit combinations, we demonstrate that Xenopus δβγ-ENaC is profoundly activated by extracellular acidification within biologically relevant ranges (pH 8.0–6.0). This effect was not observed in Xenopus αβγ-ENaC or human ENaC orthologs. We show that protons interfere with allosteric ENaC inhibition by extracellular sodium ions, thereby increasing the probability of channel opening. Using homology modeling of ENaC structure and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified a cleft region within the extracellular loop of the δ-subunit that contains several acidic amino acid residues that confer proton-sensitivity and enable allosteric inhibition by extracellular sodium ions. We propose that Xenopus δβγ-ENaC can serve as a model for investigating ENaC transformation from a proton-activated toward a constitutively-active ion channel. Such transformation might have occurred during the evolution of tetrapod vertebrates to enable bulk sodium absorption during the water–to–land transition.

Such transformation might have occurred during the evolution of tetrapod vertebrates to enable bulk sodium absorption during the water–to–land transition. Water–to–land transition was a key event in the evolution of tetrapod vertebrates. By transitioning into terrestrial habitats, tetrapod ancestors faced major physiological challenges, such as the need for breathing air, as well as a limited availability of water and sodium. Mechanisms that permitted sodium absorption from a sodium-scarce environment are likely to have evolved while vertebrate ancestors invaded freshwater habitats. This suggests that tetrapod ancestors were likely equipped with a molecular machinery allowing them to evolve efficient mechanisms for bulk sodium and, consequently, water conservation. Although comparative physiological studies reveal evolutionary adaptations at an organ level (1Bayley M. Damsgaard C. Thomsen M. Malte H. Wang T.

In tetrapod vertebrates, a key protein for conserving sodium is the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). 2The abbreviations used are: ENaCepithelial sodium channelANOVAanalysis of varianceASICacid-sensing ion channelSSIsodium self-inhibitionPDBProtein Data BankTEVCtwo-electrode voltage-clampNMDGN-methyl-d-glucamine. The presence of ENaC genes in modern jawless vertebrates (2Hanukoglu I. Hanukoglu A. Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) family: phylogeny, structure–function, tissue distribution, and associated inherited diseases.Gene. 2016; 579 (26772908): 95-13210.1016/j.gene.2015.12.061Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) suggests that ENaC evolved early within the vertebrate lineage. In sodium-absorbing epithelia of tetrapod vertebrates, ENaC is located in the apical epithelial membrane and is rate-limiting for the uptake of sodium ions into epithelial cells. In conjunction with basolateral Na+/K+-ATPases, ENaC facilitates the vectorial absorption of sodium ions, which also generates osmotic forces that drive water absorption (3Studer R.A. Person E.

In humans, an increased volume of airway surface liquid as well as urinary salt-loss in patients suffering from type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronism are clinical manifestations of ENaC loss–of–function mutations mirroring insufficient adaptation to terrestrial life (4Kerem E.

Canonical ENaCs assemble as heterotrimers consisting of three homologous subunits (α, β, and γ).

A recent study resolving the structure of human αβγ-ENaC revealed that each subunit contains short intracellular N and C termini that are connected by two transmembrane helices and a large extracellular domain (7Noreng S. Bharadwaj A. Posert R. Yoshioka C. Baconguis I.

The topology of this ectodomain resembles a clenched hand comprising the “palm,” “knuckle,” “finger,” and “thumb” domains, surrounding a central “β-ball.” Aside from the ENaC-specific GRIP (gating relief of inhibition by proteolysis) domain, which confers channel sensitivity to proteolytic activation, this structural organization is similar to that of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) (7Noreng S. Bharadwaj A. Posert R. Yoshioka C. Baconguis I.

However, despite a shared channel architecture, representatives of the degenerin/ENaC family are functionally distinct, as they open in response to various external stimuli (8Kellenberger S.

ENaC emerged in vertebrates and is the only member of this protein family that opens without an external stimulus, representing an evolutionary adaptation for bulk sodium absorption. The molecular changes that enabled an evolutionary transition from a stimulus-activated ancestor to a constitutively-active ENaC are unknown. Many freshwater vertebrates absorb sodium ions from the environment by specialized gill epithelial cells (ionocytes) that secrete protons via apical vacuolar-type H+-ATPases (12Dymowska A.K. Boyle D. Schultz A.G. Goss G.G. The role of acid-sensing ion channels in epithelial Na+ uptake in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio).J. Exp. Biol. 2015; 218 (25722005): 1244-125110.1242/jeb.113118Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protons are either used to co-transport sodium ions into ionocytes via proton-coupled sodium transporters or sodium-permeable ion channels that open in response to apical extracellular acidification (12Dymowska A.K. Boyle D. Schultz A.G. Goss G.G. The role of acid-sensing ion channels in epithelial Na+ uptake in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio).J. Exp. Biol. 2015; 218 (25722005): 1244-125110.1242/jeb.113118Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that ENaC evolved from an ancestral ion channel that was originally opened in response to protons and then progressed to constitutive activity during water–to–land transition. At a molecular level, this hypothesis is supported by the close evolutionary relationship and the structural similarities between ENaC and proton-gated ASICs, which are evolutionarily older. ASICs recently have been suggested as possible candidates for proton-coupled sodium uptake in ionocytes of freshwater zebrafish (12Dymowska A.K. Boyle D. Schultz A.G. Goss G.G. The role of acid-sensing ion channels in epithelial Na+ uptake in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio).J. Exp.

Furthermore, mammalian ENaCs are sensitive to extracellular pH in a species-specific manner, as exemplified by a 40% increase in human αβγ-ENaC activity due to extracellular acidification (pH 6.0) (14Collier D.M.

Precedents for evolutionary gain or loss of proton-sensitivity within vertebrate degenerin/ENaC proteins have recently been demonstrated for ASIC1, which gained proton-sensitivity during the emergence of bony fishes (14Collier D.M.

This is the only ENaC ortholog characterized to date that displays such characteristics. The transient nature is due to a slow but profound inhibition of ENaC activity by extracellular sodium ions, a mechanism called sodium self-inhibition (SSI) (17Babini E. Geisler H.S. Siba M. Gründer S. A new subunit of the epithelial Na+ channel identifies regions involved in Na+ self-inhibition.J. Biol.

Because Xenopus ENaCs containing the δ-ENaC subunit are insensitive to proteolytic activation (18Wichmann L. Vowinkel K.S. Perniss A. Manzini I. Althaus M. Incorporation of the δ-subunit into the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) generates protease-resistant ENaCs in Xenopus laevis.J. Biol.

This ENaC isoform might therefore exhibit functional characteristics of a proton-stimulated ENaC ancestor. We demonstrate that, in contrast to canonical Xenopus αβγ-ENaC, δ-ENaC-containing channels are profoundly activated by extracellular acidification. Modulation of δβγ-ENaC activity within physiological pH ranges (pH 8.0–6.0) involves changes in single-channel open probability and SSI. Substitutions of single aspartates in an acidic cleft located at the interface between the δ-ENaC knuckle and finger domains significantly alter δβγ-ENaC sensitivity to pH and SSI, suggesting convergence of channel regulation by extracellular protons and sodium within this region. These findings suggest that Xenopus δβγ-ENaC might be a functional model that represents the junction between constitutively active ENaCs and cognate proton-gated ion channels within the degenerin/ENaC family. Consequently, this amphibian ENaC isoform may provide insight into the evolutionary transition between gating modes that may have occurred during water–to–land transition of tetrapod vertebrates. The effect of extracellular acidification on Xenopus δβγ-ENaC activity was functionally characterized by microelectrode recordings, employing the Xenopus oocyte expression system at a holding potential (VM) of −60 mV. We and others have previously demonstrated a transient nature of transmembrane currents (IM) mediated by Xenopus ENaC containing the δ-subunit after washout of the ENaC blocker amiloride or a rapid increase in the extracellular sodium concentration (17Babini E.

As illustrated in Fig. 1, this characteristic decay of IM in oocytes expressing Xenopus δβγ-ENaC was altered depending on the extracellular pH. Changing the extracellular sodium concentration ([Na+]) from 1 to 90 mm at pH 7.4, elicited a rapid increase of IM that was followed by an initial, fast decline and a subsequent slow but continuous rundown (Fig. 1a). Current levels normalized to the initial peak in IM followed a two-phase decay function (Fig. 1b), where 39.6 ± 3.1% (n = 14) of the total current decline was attributable to the initial fraction of IM decay (Fig. 1c). Although this two-phase current decline was also observed at an alkaline pH of 8.0, the fraction of the initial IM decay under these conditions was significantly enhanced (58.5 ± 3.1%; p = 0.0058; n = 17). In contrast, acidification of the extracellular solution to pH 6.0 markedly reduced the fraction of this initial IM decay (15.9 ± 6.9%; p = 0.0048; n = 8) culminating in increased amiloride-sensitive current fractions (ΔIami) mediated by Xenopus δβγ-ENaC under acidic conditions (Fig. 1d). Changes in the extracellular pH did not affect the magnitude of the initial peak in IM (IM, peak: −11.0 ± 1.6 μA at pH 8.0, −10.3 ± 1.1 μA at pH 7.4, and −12.5 ± 1.1 μA at pH 6.0; one-way ANOVA, F = 0.7822, p = 0.4632). These results indicate that the extracellular pH influences the activity of Xenopus δβγ-ENaC and alters current kinetics at the whole-cell level. We next examined the effect of extracellular acidification on δβγ-ENaC at the single channel level. Cell-attached patch-clamp recordings lasting for 120–180 s at Vhold = −100 mV were performed using pipette solutions with pH values (pHpip) of 8.0, 7.4, and 6.0 (Fig. 2). Individual channels displayed a low open probability (Po) at pHpip 8.0 (0.12 ± 0.02, n = 15), whereas Po increased to a moderate level at pHpip 7.4 (0.24 ± 0.04; p = 0.011; n = 18) and was further enhanced at pHpip 6.0 (0.52 ± 0.04; p = 0.0003; n = 15; Fig. 2b). The number of visible channels was increased in recordings performed at pHpip 6.0 when compared with alkaline conditions at pHpip 8.0 (Fig. 2c); however, a low Po at pHpip 8.0 might lead to underestimation of channel abundance. The slope conductance (Gslope) of δβγ-ENaC was derived from linear regression of unitary channel conductance at Vhold from −40 to −100 mV. The pHpip did not significantly affect the Gslope of the channel (Fig. 2d; one-way ANOVA, F = 1.854, p = 0.1725). Taken together, these results indicate that pH-mediated modulation of Xenopus δβγ-ENaC activity is based on changes in channel Po. The magnitude of stimulation of Xenopus δβγ-ENaC by extracellular acidification was compared with channels containing the α-ENaC subunit (αβγ) from X. laevis as well as both human channel orthologs (δβγ- and αβγ-ENaC). As depicted in Fig. 3a, stepwise acidification of the extracellular solution from pH 8.0 to 6.0 in increments of pH 0.2 resulted in a successive increase of IM in oocytes expressing Xenopus δβγ-ENaC that reached a maximum between pH 6.4 and 6.0 and was sensitive to amiloride. The dose-response relationship of individual current levels normalized to IM at pH 7.4 indicated a maximal activation of the channel by a factor of 3.9 ± 0.2 under acidic conditions, whereas alkaline pH reduced ENaC activity to a factor of 0.5 ± 0.2 (n = 15). The sigmoidal dose-response curve exhibited a Hill-slope of 1.6 ± 0.4 and a half-maximal channel activation (EC50) at pH 6.9 (Fig. 3b). Alkaline inhibition, maximal acidic activation, as well as the EC50 and Hill-slope of Xenopus δβγ-ENaC were not significantly different when H2SO4 was employed for pH titration instead of HCl (data not shown). In Xenopus ENaC containing the α-subunit, maximal acid-induced channel activation was significantly reduced to a factor of 1.2 ± 0.06 (n = 12), while there was no channel inhibition at alkaline pH. Moreover, pH-mediated channel regulation between pH 8.0 and 6.0 was also reduced in human ENaC isoforms (Fig. 3, c and d). Human δβγ-ENaC displayed a maximal acid-induced fold-activation of 1.05 ± 0.01 and an alkaline inhibition to a factor of 0.93 ± 0.04 (n = 12), whereas in αβγ-ENaC these values were 1.03 ± 0.01 and 0.9 ± 0.1 (n = 11), respectively. These results demonstrate that the presence of the δ-subunit facilitates a markedly pronounced pH-sensitivity in Xenopus ENaC that is not found in either isoform of orthologous human channels. As IM recorded in water-injected oocytes was not reduced at alkaline pH or enhanced under acidic conditions, the involvement of endogenous channels or transporters in the observed pH-mediated changes of IM can be excluded. Transmembrane currents mediated by ENaC are generally subject to a time-dependent decay that is attributable to two distinct mechanisms. SSI describes an immediate, allosteric reduction of ENaC Po in the presence of high extracellular sodium concentrations (20Bize V. Horisberger J.D. Sodium self-inhibition of human epithelial sodium channel: selectivity and affinity of the extracellular sodium sensing site.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293 (17670907): F1137-F114610.1152/ajprenal.00100.2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The more slowly-progressing feedback inhibition involves a reduction of channel Po and internalization of membrane resident ENaCs due to accumulation of intracellular Na+ (21Anantharam A. Tian Y. Palmer L.G. Open probability of the epithelial sodium channel is regulated by intracellular sodium.J. Physiol. 2006; 574 (16690707): 333-34710.1113/jphysiol.2006.109173Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because previous reports have suggested that ENaC activation by acidic pH is predominantly associated with a reduced SSI (14Collier D.M. Snyder P.M. Extracellular protons regulate human ENaC by modulating Na+ self-inhibition.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (18990692): 792-79810.1074/jbc.M806954200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we hypothesized a similar correlation in Xenopus δβγ-ENaC, which is characterized by a markedly pronounced SSI (17Babini E. Geisler H.S. Siba M. Gründer S. A new subunit of the epithelial Na+ channel identifies regions involved in Na+ self-inhibition.J. Biol.

Fig. 4 illustrates a similar reversibility and magnitude of acid-induced activation and SSI of δβγ-ENaC as well as an apparent independence of both mechanisms from the slowly progressing decline of IM over time. Increasing extracellular [Na+] from 1 to 90 mm at pH 7.4 induced a peaked increase in IM that was followed by a rapid, initial current decay and a subsequent slow current rundown (Fig. 4a, also see Fig. 1). During this current rundown, extracellular acidification (pH 6.0 for 30 s) reversibly activated a consistent fraction of IM that did not decrease but slightly increased over time (Fig. 4b). The observed increase of pH 6.0 sensitive IM fractions can be mainly attributed to a reduced magnitude of the first acid-induced current increase, which may originate from an overlap with the strong, initial current decay. Notably, the magnitudes of SSI (measured as current fractions lost after 3 min of SSI) were constant over time when SSI was repetitively induced (Fig. 4, c and d) supporting a functional correlation between ENaC activation by acidic pH and inhibition through SSI. To examine a functional interdependence between Na+-mediated inhibition and acid-induced activation of ENaC, we assessed the Na+ dependence of channel activation due to extracellular acidification. As presented in Fig. 4, e and f, the half-maximal proton-induced activation (pH EC50) of Xenopus δβγ-ENaC depended on the extracellular Na+ concentration. Reduction of the extracellular [Na+] dose-dependently shifted the channel’s pH EC50 to more alkaline values, suggesting that lower concentrations of protons are necessary to maximally activate ENaC at reduced extracellular [Na+]. These results indicate that pH-mediated activation of Xenopus δβγ-ENaC is affected by the extracellular Na+ concentration, thus suggesting that protons alter channel activity by modulating SSI. Because SSI of ENaC is only visible during experimental conditions as employed in this study, we additionally examined whether proton-sensitivity is maintained in prolonged recordings, when currents have reached a quasi-steady–state level. Indeed, extracellular acidification (pH 6.0) led to a strong increase of IM (Fig. 4g), indicating that pH-sensitivity might also represent a physiologically relevant stimulus activating Xenopus δβγ-ENaC. To further examine how protons and SSI interact, we determined the effect of extracellular pH on the magnitude and apparent Na+ affinity of SSI in Xenopus δβγ-ENaC (Fig. 5). SSI was assessed by successively increasing extracellular [Na+] from 1 mm to either 3, 10, 30, 60, 90, or 120 mm for 3 min. Fractional inhibition of IM from the initial peak current (IM, peak) to current levels after 3 min (IM, 3 min) was defined as SSI ((IM, peak/IM, 3 min)/(IM, peak)). Plotting the magnitude of SSI against the respective [Na+] allowed for estimation of maximal inhibition (Vmax) and apparent Na+ affinity (Km) of SSI as values followed a Michaelis-Menten relation. Under alkaline conditions (pH 8.0), Xenopus δβγ-ENaC exhibited a maximal SSI of 0.57 ± 0.03, which was half-maximally reached at 2.1 ± 0.4 mm Na+ (n = 10; Fig. 5a). Although the magnitude of maximal SSI reached a similar value in the presence of pH 7.4 (0.55 ± 0.03, p = 0.9502), the Na+ affinity of SSI was significantly reduced under these conditions (Km = 8.1 ± 2.2 mm Na+, p = 0.0347, n = 16; Fig. 5b). Compared with pH 7.4, further extracellular acidification (pH 7.0, Fig. 5c) led to a reduction of maximal SSI (0.4 ± 0.05, p = 0.017), whereas the apparent Na+ affinity (Km = 16.8 ± 6.8 mm Na+, p = 0.9999, n = 13) was not significantly changed. In line with results presented in Fig. 1, SSI of Xenopus δβγ-ENaC was altered at pH 6.0 (Fig. 5d). Although the magnitude of channel inhibition was moderate in the presence of 3 mm Na+ (0.29 ± 0.04), it did not increase with rising sodium concentrations (SSI at 120 mm Na+ = 0.14 ± 0.02, n = 10). Because these data did not converge with a Michaelis-Menten fit, estimation of maximal SSI and apparent Na+ affinity was not feasible. Nevertheless, these data clearly demonstrate that changes in the extracellular pH affect the magnitude and Na+ affinity of SSI in Xenopus δβγ-ENaC, thus indicating that extracellular protons activate ENaC by antagonizing Na+-mediated channel inhibition. This is additionally supported by the synergy/antagonism estimation using an interaction matrix composed of Na+- and proton-dependent SSI values of Xenopus δβγ-ENaC (Fig. 5e). The landscape visualizes deviations of the observed values for SSI from a reference model (Bliss model (22Yadav B. Wennerberg K. Aittokallio T. Tang J.

Less is known about how rest-activity behaviors cluster within individuals and how rest-activity behavior profiles relate to health. In this study we aimed to investigate if adult women cluster into profiles based on how they accumulate rest-activity behavior (including accelerometer-measured PA, SB, and sleep), and if participant characteristics and health outcomes differ by profile membership. Methods A convenience sample of 372 women (mean age 55.38 + 10.16) were recruited from four US cities. Participants wore ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers on the hip and wrist for a week. Total daily minutes in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and percentage of wear-time spent in SB was estimated from the hip device. Total sleep time (hours/minutes) and sleep efficiency (% of in bed time asleep) were estimated from the wrist device. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was performed to identify clusters of participants based on accumulation of the four rest-activity variables. Adjusted ANOVAs were conducted to explore differences in demographic characteristics and health outcomes across profiles. Results Rest-activity variables clustered to form five behavior profiles: Moderately Active Poor Sleepers (7%), Highly Actives (9%), Inactives (41%), Moderately Actives (28%), and Actives (15%). The Moderately Active Poor Sleepers (profile 1) had the lowest proportion of whites (35% vs 78–91%, p < .001) and college graduates (28% vs 68–90%, p = .004). Health outcomes did not vary significantly across all rest-activity profiles. Conclusions In this sample, women clustered within daily rest-activity behavior profiles. Identifying 24-hour behavior profiles can inform intervention population targets and innovative behavioral goals of multiple health behavior interventions."

Methods People with type 2 diabetes were randomized into the intervention (four group-based interactive sessions) or the control group (a single educational lecture) with their partners. Outcomes were measured at baseline, immediately after the third course session and six months later using validated questionnaires on diabetes self-care, distress, illness perceptions, diabetes-related attitudes, empowerment and partner support. Multilevel analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle using the data from 82 intervention and 86 control group participants, to test for differences in changes over time between the two groups. Results The intervention group showed a significantly higher increase in physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake immediately after the program, whereas the low baseline levels of diabetes distress remained unaffected. Furthermore, the intervention group believed their illness to be more likely to be caused by chance/bad luck, but also felt more empowered to handle their condition and its treatment immediately after the program compared with the control group. Six months later, only the differences in empowerment had persisted. Conclusions Group-based self-management support results in favorable short-term behavioral changes and more persistent alterations in (perceived) empowerment in people living in the first years of type 2 diabetes. In order to achieve more sustainable behavioral changes, more prolonged support is necessary. This could be achieved by integrating attention to patients’ illness perceptions and continuous self-management support in regular diabetes care.

https://openalex.org/W2954814131,"Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is often employed as a proteinaceous component for synthesis of luminescent protein-stabilized gold nanoclusters (AuNC): intriguing systems with many potential applications. Typically, the formation of BSA-AuNC conjugate occurs under strongly alkaline conditions. Due to the sheer complexity of intertwined chemical and structural transitions taking place upon BSA-AuNC formation, the state of albumin enveloping AuNCs remains poorly characterized. Here, we study the conformational properties of BSA bound to AuNCs using an array of biophysical tools including vibrational spectroscopy, circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy and trypsin digestion. The alkaline conditions of BSA-AuNC self-assembly appear to be primary responsible for the profound irreversible disruption of tertiary contacts, partial unfolding of native α-helices, hydrolysis of disulfide bonds and the protein becoming vulnerable to trypsin digestion. Further unfolding of BSA-AuNC by guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl) is fully reversible equally in terms of albumin's secondary structure and conjugate's luminescent properties. This suggests that binding to AuNCs traps the albumin molecule in a state that is both partly disordered and refractory to irreversible misfolding. Indeed, when BSA-AuNC is subjected to conditions favoring self-association of BSA into amyloid-like fibrils, the buildup of non-native β-sheet conformation is less pronounced than in a control experiment with unmodified BSA. Unexpectedly, BSA-AuNC reveals a tendency to self-assemble into giant twisted superstructures of micrometer lengths detectable with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), a property absent in unmodified BSA. The process is accompanied by ordering of bound AuNCs into elongated streaks and simultaneous decrease in fluorescence intensity. The newly discovered self-association pathway appears to be specifically accessible to protein molecules with a certain restriction on structural dynamics which in the case of BSA-AuNC arises from binding to metal nanoclusters. Our results have been discussed in the context of mechanisms of protein misfolding and applications of BSA-AuNC."
https://openalex.org/W2953440939,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a neuroactive peptide produced by neurons, reactive astrocytes, and endothelial cells in the brain. Elevated levels of ET-1 have been detected in the post-mortem brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously demonstrated that overexpression of astrocytic ET-1 exacerbates memory deficits in aged mice or in APPK670/M671 mutant mice. However, the effects of ET-1 on neuronal dysfunction remain elusive. ET-1 has been reported to mediate superoxide formation in the vascular system via NADPH oxidase (NOX) and to regulate the actin cytoskeleton of cancer cell lines via the cofilin pathway. Interestingly, oxidative stress and cofilin activation were both reported to mediate one of the AD histopathologies, cofilin rod formation in neurons. This raises the possibility that ET-1 mediates neurodegeneration via oxidative stress- or cofilin activation-driven cofilin rod formation. Here, we demonstrate that exposure to 100 nm ET-1 or to a selective ET type B receptor (ETB) agonist (IRL1620) induces cofilin rod formation in dendrites of primary hippocampal neurons, accompanied by a loss of distal dendrites and a reduction in dendritic length. The 100 nm IRL1620 exposure induced superoxide formation and cofilin activation, which were abolished by pretreatment with a NOX inhibitor (5 μm VAS2870). Moreover, IRL1620-induced cofilin rod formation was partially abolished by pretreatment with a calcineurin inhibitor (100 nm FK506), which suppressed cofilin activation. In conclusion, our findings suggest a role for ETB in neurodegeneration by promoting cofilin rod formation and dendritic loss via NOX-driven superoxide formation and cofilin activation."

In this study, we established an approach that allows to address the effects of pro-inflammatory stimulation and co-culture with MSC on different specific leukocyte subpopulations. Equine peripheral blood leukocyte recovery was optimized to preserve all leukocyte subpopulations and leukocyte activation regimes were evaluated. Allogeneic labeled equine adipose-derived MSC were then subjected to direct co-culture with either non-stimulated, concanavalin A (ConA)-activated or phosphate 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin (PMA/I)-activated leukocytes. Subsequently, production of the cytokines interferon-γ (IFN- γ), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and presence of FoxP3 were determined in specific cell populations using multicolor flow cytometry. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was measured in the supernatants. ConA-stimulation induced mild activation of leukocytes, whereas PMA/I-stimulation led to strong activation. In T cells, PMA/I promoted production of all cytokines, with no distinct suppressive effects of MSC. However, increased numbers of CD25/FoxP3-positive cells indicated that MSC supported regulatory T cell differentiation in PMA/I-activated leukocyte cultures. MSC also reduced numbers of cytokine-producing B cells and granulocytes, mostly irrespective of preceding leukocyte activation, and reversed the stimulatory effect of ConA on IFN-γ production in monocytes. Illustrating the possible suppressive mechanisms, higher numbers of MSC produced IL-10 when co-cultured with non-stimulated or ConA-activated leukocytes. This was not observed in co-culture with PMA/I-activated leukocytes. However, PGE2 concentration in the supernatant was highest in the co-culture with PMA/I-activated leukocytes, suggesting that PGE2 could still mediate modulatory effects in strongly inflammatory environment. These context- and cell type-specific modulatory effects observed give insight into the interactions between MSC and different types of immune cells and highlight the roles of IL-10 and PGE2 in MSC-mediated immunomodulation. The approach presented could provide a basis for further functional MSC characterization and the development of potency assays."
https://openalex.org/W2955778802,"The global trend in HIV incidence overall is declining; however, there is a plateau in new HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) despite extensive investment in HIV prevention targeting these populations. Many studies usually conflate these two groups together, which may overlook many disparate characteristics unique to each population, impeding the efficacy of HIV interventions. To better understand the vulnerable diversity that may put these individuals at risk of HIV infection, we conducted qualitative analysis among Thai MSM and TGW, aiming to identify sexual pattern themes of MSM and TGW in Bangkok in order to better understand their distinctive sexual life context. Convenient and purposive samplings were used to recruit Thai MSM and TGW aged ≥ 18 years old and living in Bangkok, Thailand, for focused group discussions and one-on-one in-depth interviews, respectively. Total of 12 MSM and 13 TGW participated in focused group discussions, which were conducted separately for MSM and TGW. Additionally, 5 MSM and 5 TGW were involved in one-on-one in-depth interviews. Thematic analyses were performed separately for MSM and TGW. The results show that MSM and TGW have distinct and diverse sexual patterns, and within the identified themes: partnering, partner finding, protection, and enhancing sexual pleasure (only for MSM). Participants reported having varying sexual experiences. Recognizing the difference and diversity in partnering and sexual practice of MSM and TGW is crucial in order to develop tailored interventions that suit the vulnerability of the key populations in Thailand."

We investigated the effects of perioperative troponin elevation on the long-term clinical outcomes of patients with a history of coronary revascularization. Methods We analyzed patients whose pre- or postoperative high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) assay results were available. Patients were divided into two groups according to hs-cTnI levels. The patient groups were analyzed separately according to whether hs-cTnI was assessed preoperatively or postoperatively. The primary outcome was all-cause death during the follow-up period. Results Median follow-up duration was 25 months (interquartile range 11–50). In the propensity-matched analysis, the risk of all-cause death during follow-up was higher in the group with elevated hs-cTnI group than in the normal group (12.7% vs 6.3%; hazard ratio [HR], 2.67; 95% confidential interval [CI], 1.04–6.82; p = 0.04). In the propensity-matched analysis of preoperative hs-cTnI levels, we found no significant difference between the groups in the rate of all-cause death (12.9% vs. 11.9%; HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.45–2.50; p = 0.89). In the postoperative propensity-matched analysis, all-cause death was higher in patients with elevated hs-cTnI than in those with normal levels (14.9% vs. 5.9%; HR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.01–7.77; p = 0.048). Conclusion In revascularized coronary patients who underwent noncardiac surgery, postoperative (but not preoperative) hs-cTnI elevation was associated with all-cause death during follow-up. Larger datasets are needed to support this finding."
https://openalex.org/W2953926074,"Background Monitoring Caesarean Section (CS) rates is essential to ensure optimal use of the procedure. Information on CS rates in the South African private sector is limited and information from this study will assist in planning for the proposed NHI in South Africa. Objectives The objectives of this paper are to assess mode of delivery patterns and to determine CS rates amongst South African private health insurance scheme members; and to assess the extent to which CS rates are influenced by age and health status of the mother. Methods The 2015 claims for members of 10 health insurance schemes were analysed to assess delivery type patterns. Mode of delivery patterns were assessed by 6 delivery types: emergency, elective and “other” for caesarean deliveries; and non-assisted, assisted and “other” for vaginal deliveries; as well as by age and health condition of the mother. Results Of a total of 6,542 births analysed, 4,815 were CS giving a CS rate of 73·6% (95% CI 72·5%;74·7%). Emergency CS were the most common mode of delivery (39·7%), followed by elective CS (39·5%). CS rates increased with increasing maternal age and were higher for women with a medical condition. Conclusions CS rates for the South African private sector are considerably higher than the safe rates recommended by the WHO. The high CS rates is a cause for concern for the health system under the proposed NHI. To support initiatives encouraging evidence based practice, further research is required to understand the drivers for the high CS rates."
https://openalex.org/W2954090554,"Background The elderly population is increasing globally. In Pakistan, the elderly comprise 6% of the population that is predicted to triple by 2050. Non-communicable diseases are common health problems of the elderly in Pakistan, however, resulting geriatric impairments and disability are unknown. This study was conducted to determine geriatric impairments and identify associated socio-demographic factors and comorbidities among community dwelling elderly in Karachi, Pakistan. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted during 2013–2014. Community clusters were selected from all sub-districts of Karachi, the largest city of Pakistan. Data was collected from systematically selected households within these clusters from individuals, aged ≥60 years, using standardized questionnaires. Geriatric impairment was assessed through validated questions and tools. We screened for depression, dementia, mobility and functional status. Descriptive statistics were computed for socio-demographic factors. We estimated the prevalence and 95% CI for geriatric impairments and comorbidities. Results A total of 1200 community-dwelling elderly participated in this study. More than half (n = 663, 55.3%) were females. The average age of the participants was 68.7 (SD = 7.8) years. Two-thirds suffered from chronic illness and the most common impairments were psychological and cognitive. Females were 2.45 times more at risk of developing three or more geriatric impairments. Participants with no formal education had the highest proportion (43.8%) of geriatric impairments. Participants living with more children were more likely to have three or more impairments. Conclusion A high burden of non-communicable diseases and associated impairments were identified among elderly in Karachi, Pakistan. High rates of psychological and cognitive impairments require urgent attention for resources and strategic planning in anticipation of a growing geriatric population."
https://openalex.org/W2955139342,"The objective was to verify the association between body composition from 18 to 22 years and pulmonary function at 22 years of age. This longitudinal analysis was conducted with a Brazilian birth cohort data. The outcomes were the forced expiratory volume in the first second and forced vital capacity (FVC), measured at 22 years follow-up. Main exposures: obesity (body mass index ≥ 30kg/m2), and highest tertiles of fat mass (FM) and fat mass index (air displacement plethysmography) measured at 18 and 22 years-old follow-ups. The reference category (not exposed) was defined by those individuals who were not classified in the highest adiposity categories mentioned, in both ages. Multivariable linear regressions stratified by sex were used. The sample comprised 3,511 participants. Those who belonged to the highest adiposity categories in 18 and 22 years follow-ups showed lower pulmonary function at 22 years when compared to those who were not classified in the higher adiposity categories in both ages (reference category); those in the highest tertile of FM showed a mean FVC -313mL (95%CI -421; -206) and -259mL (95%CI -336; -182) in men and women, compared to the reference category, respectively. Those who changed from the higher to the lower adiposity categories (from 18 to 22 years) showed pulmonary function similar to the reference, and those who presented the opposite body composition trajectory, showed decreased pulmonary function results at 22 years, mainly among women. We concluded that high body adiposity in two follow-ups and especially contemporary adiposity was associated with lower pulmonary function at 22 years."
https://openalex.org/W2955594255,"The architecture of primary and secondary pinnae of the fossil fern Weichselia reticulata (C. Stokes et Webb) Fontaine is studied based on 28 large specimens from the upper Barremian La Huérguina Formation of the fossil locality Las Hoyas, Cuenca, Spain. The study of the specimens is performed through a morphometric analysis consisting in a reformulation of the Branching Algorithms method of shape description including measurements (insertion angle, distance between pinnae, first segment length and rachis width) and ratios (interval ratio, branching ratio and tapering ratio). A protocol to relocate isolated fragments of fossil pinnae is also established using the interval ratio (distance between pinnae/ previous distance between pinnae) and insertion angle of the pinnae. All specimens show a similar architecture, having elliptic primary pinnae with a sinuous apically tapering primary rachis and triangular secondary pinnae with pinnules of different morphologies. The analysis of the architecture allows to propose that the position of the frond was plagiotropic and that the frond growth was basiplastic for the petiole head and acroplastic for the primary pinnae. The metric method is applied to explore the architecture of four living fern species (Angiopteris evecta (Forst.) Hoffm., Matonia pectinata R.Br., Sphaeropteris cooperi (F.Muell.) R.M.Tryon, and Woodwardia unigemmata (Makino) Nakai). Weichselia architecture results extremely ordered and regular in comparison with the primary pinnae variation of the living species."
https://openalex.org/W2955767310,"Introduction The Temprano and START trials provided evidence to support early ART initiation recommendations. We projected long-term clinical and economic outcomes of immediate ART initiation in Côte d’Ivoire. Methods We used a mathematical model to compare three potential ART initiation criteria: 1) CD4 <350/μL (ART<350/μL); 2) CD4 <500/μL (ART<500/μL); and 3) ART at presentation (Immediate ART). Outcomes from the model included life expectancy, 10-year medical resource use, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in $/year of life saved (YLS), and 5-year budget impact. We simulated people with HIV (PWH) in care (mean CD4: 259/μL, SD 198/μL) and transmitted cases. Key input parameters to the analysis included first-line ART efficacy (80% suppression at 6 months) and ART cost ($90/person-year). We assessed cost-effectiveness relative to Côte d’Ivoire’s 2017 per capita annual gross domestic product ($1,600). Results Immediate ART increased life expectancy by 0.34 years compared to ART<350/μL and 0.17 years compared to ART<500/μL. Immediate ART resulted in 4,500 fewer 10-year transmissions per 170,000 PWH compared to ART<350/μL. In cost-effectiveness analysis, Immediate ART had a 10-year ICER of $680/YLS compared to ART<350/μL, ranging from cost-saving to an ICER of $1,440/YLS as transmission rates varied. ART<500/μL was “dominated” (an inefficient use of resources), compared with Immediate ART. Immediate ART increased the 5-year HIV care budget from $801.9M to $812.6M compared to ART<350/μL. Conclusions In Côte d’Ivoire, immediate compared to later ART initiation will increase life expectancy, decrease HIV transmission, and be cost-effective over the long-term, with modest budget impact. Immediate ART initiation is an appropriate, high-value standard of care in Côte d’Ivoire and similar settings."
https://openalex.org/W2953995980,"Domestication of barley and other cereals was accompanied by an increase in seed size which has been ascribed to human selection, large seeds being preferred by early farmers or favoured by cultivation practices such as deep sowing. An alternative suggestion is that the increase in seed size was an indirect consequence of selection for plants with more vigorous growth. To begin to address the latter hypothesis we studied the diversity of HvWAK1, a wall-associated kinase gene involved in root proliferation, in 220 wild barley accessions and 200 domesticated landraces. A 3655-bp sequence comprising the gene and upstream region contained 69 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), one indel and four short tandem repeats. A network of 50 haplotypes revealed a complex evolutionary relationship, but with landraces largely restricted to two parts of the topology. SNPs in the HvWAK1 coding region resulted in nonsynonymous substitutions at nine positions in the translation product, but none of these changes were predicted to have a significant effect on the protein structure. In contrast, the region upstream of the coding sequence contained five SNPs that were invariant in the domesticated population, fixation of these SNPs decreasing the likelihood that the upstream of a pair of TATA boxes and transcription start sites would be used to promote transcription of HvWAK1. The sequence diversity therefore suggests that the cis-regulatory region of HvWAK1 might have been subject to selection during barley domestication. The extent of root proliferation has been linked with traits such as above-ground biomass, so selection for particular cis-regulatory variants of HvWAK1 would be consistent with the hypothesis that seed size increases during domestication were the indirect consequence of selection for plants with increased growth vigour."
https://openalex.org/W2954088176,"The bertha armyworm (BAW), Mamestra configurata, is a significant pest of canola (Brassica napus L. and B. rapa L.) in western North America that undergoes cyclical outbreaks every 6–8 years. During peak outbreaks millions of dollars are spent on insecticidal control and, even with control efforts, subsequent damage can result in losses worth millions of dollars. Despite the importance of this pest insect, information is lacking on the dispersal ability of BAW and the genetic variation of populations from across its geographic range which may underlie potential differences in their susceptibility to insecticides or pathogens. Here, we examined the genetic diversity of BAW populations during an outbreak across its geographic range in western North America. First, mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) barcode sequences were used to confirm species identification of insects captured in a network of pheromone traps across the range, followed by haplotype analyses. We then sequenced the BAW genome and used double-digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing, mapped to the genome, to identify 1000s of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) markers. CO1 haplotype analysis identified 9 haplotypes distributed across 28 sample locations and three laboratory-reared colonies. Analysis of genotypic data from both the CO1 and SNP markers revealed little population structure across BAW’s vast range. The CO1 haplotype pattern showed a star-like phylogeny which is often associated with species whose population abundance and range has recently expanded and combined with pheromone trap data, indicates the outbreak may have originated from a single focal point in central Saskatchewan. The relatively recent introduction of canola and rapid expansion of the canola growing region across western North America, combined with the cyclical outbreaks of BAW caused by precipitous population crashes, has likely selected for a genetically homogenous BAW population adapted to this crop."
https://openalex.org/W2954432367,"Schmallenberg virus (SBV), an orthobunyavirus infecting ruminants, emerged in 2011 in Central Europe, spread very rapidly throughout the continent and established an endemic status, thereby representing a constant threat not only to the European livestock population, but also to neighboring countries. Hence, in endemically infected regions, the maintenance and regular verification of diagnostics is needed and in not yet affected regions, suitable diagnostic systems should be established to be prepared for a potential introduction of the disease. In addition, also for the trade of animals into free regions, highly reliable and sensitive diagnostics are of utmost importance. Therefore, a laboratory proficiency trial was initiated to allow for performance evaluations of test systems available for SBV-diagnostics, but also for evaluation of veterinary diagnostic laboratories performing those tests. Ten serum samples (six seropositive, four seronegative) were provided for serological analysis, four of the seropositive samples were provided undiluted, while the remaining samples represented 1/2 and 1/4 dilutions of one of the aforementioned samples in negative serum. Ten further sera (five virus-positive, five negative) were sent to the participants to be analyzed by SBV genome detection methods. A total of 48 diagnostic laboratories from 15 countries of three continents (Europe, Asia, North America) and three kit manufacturers participated in the SBV proficiency test, thereby generating 131 result sets, corresponding to 1310 individual results. The sample panel aimed for serological analysis was tested 72 times; the applied diagnostic methods comprised different commercial ELISAs and standard micro-neutralization tests. The sample set aimed for genome detection was analyzed in 59 approaches by various commercial or in-house (real-time) RT-PCR protocols. Antibody or genome positive samples were correctly identified in every case, independent of the applied diagnostic test system. For seronegative samples, three incorrect, false-positive test results were produced. Virus-negative samples tested false-positive in two cases. Thus, a very high diagnostic accuracy of 99.58% and 99.66% was achieved by the serological and virological methods, respectively. Hence, this ring trial demonstrated that reliable and robust SBV-diagnostics has been established in veterinary diagnostic laboratories in affected and non-affected countries."
https://openalex.org/W2956006545,"People living with HIV (PLHIV) often face barriers in accessing quality and comprehensive HIV care, including stigma and discrimination, which results in poor retention and viral non-suppression. Peer-led interventions can help address these barriers. In Kenya, peer educators (PEs) are PLHIV who support other PLHIV to adhere to clinic schedules and antiretroviral medication uptake. In spite of their status as role models and their key role in supporting clients receiving HIV care and treatment, little is known about the characteristics and treatment outcomes of PEs themselves, specifically viral suppression.This is a retrospective descriptive analysis of program data on treatment outcomes of PEs engaged in active patient support activities between October 2010 and January 2017. All eligible PEs from 140 health facilities located in 23 counties of Kenya were included in the study. Data from 230 PEs were abstracted from the electronic medical records, patient files, and registers between June and August 2017. Study variables included key sociodemographic characteristics (sex, marital status, and age), duration on antiretroviral therapy (ART), WHO clinical staging, baseline CD4 count, current antiretroviral regimen and uptake of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT). The outcome variable was viral suppression, defined as a viral load <1000 copies/ml.Overall, 173/230 (75%) of the PEs were female, 144/230 (63%) were married, and median age (LQ, UQ) was 38.5 (33.0, 42.0) years. The PEs had been on ART for a median (LQ, UQ) duration of 76.0 (37.0, 105.0) months. Six months IPT completion was high at 97%. Of the 222 (97%) PEs with an up-to-date viral load taken within the last one year, 211 (95%) were virally suppressed.Our study showed that peer educators actively engaged in patient support activities have achieved high viral suppression rates."
https://openalex.org/W2953513215,"This article addresses the study of crack behavior elicited on axial fatigue in specimens joined by butt weld made of steel ASTM A36 by using fracture mechanics and simulation software of finite elements (Ansys APDL, Franc3D). The computational model was initially to define the geometry model by using CAD software. Specimens with Weld Reinforcement of 2 mm and 3mm were simulated. Subsequently, the type of element for the mesh, the information inclusion concerning material mechanical properties and load conditions were selected. By using Franc3D software, the crack propagation phenomenon is analyzed, and its growth parameters have been established. In this way, it is possible to calculate the magnitude of stress intensity factor (SIF) along the crack front. It is concluded that the stress located in the weld toe is maximized proportionately to the size of the weld reinforcement due to the concentration effect of geometric stress. In addition, it is observed that the propagation rate obtained from Paris law has a similar behavior for the studied weld reinforcements; the latter as there were short cracks."
https://openalex.org/W2955892276,"Patterns of spatial behavior dictate how we use our infrastructure, encounter other people, or are exposed to services and opportunities. Understanding these patterns through the analysis of data commonly available through commodity smartphones has become an important arena for innovation in both academia and industry. The resulting datasets can quickly become massive, indicating the need for concise understanding of the scope of the data collected. Some data is obviously correlated (for example GPS location and which WiFi routers are seen). Codifying the extent of these correlations could identify potential new models, provide guidance on the amount of data to collect, and even provide actionable features. However, identifying correlations, or even the extent of correlation, is difficult because the form of the correlation must be specified. Fractal-based intrinsic dimensionality directly calculates the minimum number of dimensions required to represent a dataset. We provide an intrinsic dimensionality analysis of four smartphone datasets over seven input dimensions, and empirically demonstrate an intrinsic dimension of approximately two."
