https://openalex.org/W1511368491,"Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 (IRS-1) is an endogenous cellular protein that is tyrosine phosphorylated during stimulation of cells with insulin, IGF-1, and interleukin 4 (IL-4). Phosphorylated IRS-1 regulates multiple regulatory pathways by recruiting signaling molecules containing Src homology 2 domains (SH2 proteins). The 32D myeloid progenitor cell line contains few insulin receptors and no detectable IRS-1. Expression of the insulin receptor alone partially mediates insulin-stimulated microtubule-associated protein (MAP) kinase activation, and the addition of IRS-1 enhances this effect (Myers, M. G., Jr., Wang, L.-M., Sun, X. J., Zhang, Y., Yenush, L. P., Schlessinger, J., Pierce, J. H., and White, M. F. (1994) Mol. Cell. Biol. 14, 3577-3587). Alone, insulin receptors mediate phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3'-kinase and p70S6k activation poorly if at all during insulin stimulation. Expression of IRS-1 alone in 32D cells mediates the stimulation of p70S6k by insulin, IGF-1, or IL-4; addition of insulin receptor to these cells increases the sensitivity of the insulin response. In contrast, full insulin stimulation of PI 3'-kinase requires both the insulin receptor and IRS-1, suggesting that a high level of IRS-1 phosphorylation is required for insulin-stimulated PI 3'-kinase activation, whereas a low level of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation transmits an essential signal to p70S6k. Both insulin receptors and IRS-1 are required for mitogenic signaling in 32D cells suggesting that MAP kinase or p70S6k alone are not sufficient, and that both or additional unknown IRS-1-mediated signals are necessary."
https://openalex.org/W1540271729,"Agonist stimulation of platelets induces multiple waves of tyrosine phosphorylation, several of which are dependent on the integrin alpha IIb beta 3. At least two classes of protein tyrosine kinases are activated during various stages of platelet activation, 1) Src family tyrosine kinases are activated during an early phase of platelet activation by an integrin-independent mechanism and 2) pp125FAK is activated during a late stage of platelet activation, and it is dependent on platelet aggregation mediated by fibrinogen binding to alpha IIb beta 3. In this report, we examined the mechanism of agonist-induced phosphorylation and activation of the tyrosine kinase pp72syk, which is known to couple with immune response receptors in B cells and mast cells. pp72syk was found to be regulated by both agonist and integrin receptors in a pattern distinct from that of pp60src and pp125FAK. Specifically, thrombin induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of pp72syk independent of platelet aggregation. However, full activation of pp72syk required integrin engagement since treatment with antibodies that block fibrinogen binding to alpha IIb beta 3 reduced pp72syk phosphorylation by 40%. Furthermore, fibrinogen binding to alpha IIb beta 3 stimulated directly with an anti-beta 3 antibody activated pp72syk 3-fold and stimulated its tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, pp72syk is the only platelet tyrosine kinase identified to date that can be directly activated through integrin ligation. In addition, we found that the activation of pp72syk is dependent upon the state of actin polymerization and that pp72syk redistributes to actin-rich cytoskeletal complexes in an aggregation-dependent manner. These results suggest a role for pp72syk in both early, integrin-independent tyrosine phosphorylation events as well as those dependent upon subsequent integrin engagement."
https://openalex.org/W1645980108,"We have isolated a 5199-nucleotide cDNA from a mouse library containing an open reading frame encoding the 1099-amino acid type VII adenylyl cyclase protein. The type VII protein is most closely related in primary structure to an unpublished human adenylyl cyclase clone (GenBank accession no. D25538) and type II adenylyl cyclase. Northern blot analysis demonstrates that the type VII mRNA is most abundant in mouse heart, spleen, and lung. cAMP content rises rapidly in HEK 293 cells overexpressing type VII adenylyl cyclase following treatment with phorbol ester, peaking by 4 min, while cells expressing the type II adenylyl cyclase reach peak accumulation only after 20 min. Increases in intracellular calcium through treatment of type VII-293 cells with either ATP or A23187 alone failed to increase intracellular cAMP content. Phorbol ester treatment acted synergistically with beta-adrenergic stimulation to increase cAMP content in type VII-transformed cells. Pretreatment of type VII-transformed cells with pertussis toxin fails to prevent phorbol ester potentiation of isoproterenol stimulation. Thus the ability of phorbol ester to increase basal and isoproterenol-stimulated type VII activity appears to be a direct effect on this adenylyl cyclase isoform and not the result of modification of the inhibitory G protein, Gi."
https://openalex.org/W1595815112,"In order to characterize the molecular mechanisms that dictate microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) gene transcription in human and hamster, two species with similar plasma lipoprotein profiles, the MTP gene promoters were cloned, sequenced, and functionally characterized by transient transfection analysis. The results presented in this report indicate that the 5' ends of human and hamster MTP genes share similar structural features. The promoter sequences are well conserved and consist of similar functional elements. Transient transfection analysis of MTP promoter-driven luciferase gene expression showed that the promoter is active in liver and intestinal cells but not in epithelial cells, consistent with endogenous MTP gene expression. The -123 to -85 bp region of the human promoter is critical for the expression and contains the consensus recognition sequences for liver cell-specific factors HNF-1 and HNF-4 and activator protein AP-1. The promoter contains a modified sterol response element and a negative insulin response element. The human promoter activity is positively regulated by cholesterol and negatively regulated by insulin. From the functional analysis of MTP promoters, it is concluded that the elements that regulate the cell type-specific expression in human and hamster are well conserved and that insulin and cholesterol can regulate the activity of the MTP promoter in opposite directions."
https://openalex.org/W1588246354,"Abstract Mutation of amino acids located within or immediately NH2-terminal to transmembrane segment 7 of human P-glycoprotein abolished the ability of the protein to confer resistance to cytotoxic drugs. Each of these mutant P-glycoproteins had an apparent mass of 150 kDa, compared with 170 kDa for wild-type P-glycoprotein, and the apparent mass was altered by endoglycosidase H digestion. These observations suggest that these mutant proteins were processed improperly, so that they were located in the endoplasmic reticulum and were not targeted correctly to the plasma membrane. Processing of the 150-kDa P-glycoprotein to the 170-kDa mature form of the enzyme for all of the mutants, except Glu707-->Ala and Tyr710-->Ala, was dramatically increased when the cells were grown at 26 degrees C. At the lower growth temperature, the mature protein was targeted to the plasma membrane, and drug efflux activity was restored. We also analyzed the mutants for possible molecular interactions that may contribute to their intracellular retention. We found that core-glycosylated forms of the wild-type and mutant P-glycoproteins were associated with the molecular chaperone calnexin. Only wild-type enzyme, however, was able to escape association with calnexin and be targeted to the plasma membrane. Prolonged association of the mutants with calnexin may be due to misfolding of the protein as evidenced by their relative short half-life of about 3 h, compared with 50 h for the wild-type enzyme. These results suggest that calnexin contributes to a quality control mechanism to retain misfolded forms of P-glycoprotein in the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1517690457,"In this paper we report the biochemical characterization of calgranulin C, a new member of the S100 protein family. The protein is highly abundant in the cytosol of pig granulocytes, with relatively small amounts in lymphocytes. A simple protocol for the rapid purification of calgranulin C is described. The purified protein migrates as a single entity on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis while it has two isoforms focusing at pH 5.8 and 5.5. Gel filtration and cross-linking experiments indicate that calgranulin C is capable of dimerization. The complete amino acid sequence was determined by Edman degradation of peptides generated by trypsin and V8 protease digestion. Calgranulin C consists of 91 residues and has a calculated molecular mass of 10,614 daltons. This value is virtually identical to that obtained by electrospray mass spectrometry. Sequence analysis predicts two EF-hand calcium-binding motifs, the first having an extended loop that is distinctive of the S100 protein family. The metal-binding properties were studied by means of a direct 45Ca(2+)-binding assay and by tyrosine fluorescence titration. Calgranulin C binds not only calcium but also zinc ions. A single high affinity Zn(2+)-binding site per monomer was evidenced by fluorimetric titration. Zinc binding to calgranulin C induces a remarkable increase in the protein affinity for calcium; in the absence of zinc, the protein binds 1 Ca2+/monomer with a binding constant of about 2 x 10(4) M-1, whereas the Zn(2+)-loaded form binds 2 Ca2+/monomer with Ka values of approximately 3 x 10(7) and 6 x 10(4) M-1. Circular dichroism analysis showed that the binding of calcium to calgranulin C induces a 15% decrease in the apparent alpha-helix content. This result and the calcium-dependent binding of the protein to a phenyl-Superose column strongly suggest that calgranulin C undergoes a gross conformational change upon calcium binding, thus supporting the idea that this protein may be involved in Ca(2+)-dependent signal transduction events."
https://openalex.org/W1669661359,"Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) consists of a low density lipoprotein particle in which apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)), is disulfide linked to apoB. Lp(a) is produced by the liver, and high plasma levels represent an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. However, pathways of production and metabolism of Lp(a) are poorly understood. We used primary cultures of baboon hepatocytes to analyze the steps involved in Lp(a) biogenesis. The results demonstrated that Lp(a) assembly was extracellular, since it was inhibited when anti-apo(a) antiserum was present in the culture medium. In addition, free apo(a) produced by hepatocytes could associate extracellularly with apoB in either very low density or low density lipoproteins. Lp(a) assembly required lysine-binding pockets in apo(a) kringles, as it was inhibited by the lysine analog, 6-amino hexanoic acid. A portion of apo(a) was also bound to the cell surface via its kringle domains and could be released into the medium by 6-amino hexanoic acid or proline. In add-back experiments, apo(a), but not Lp(a), bound to the cell surface. Addition of low density lipoprotein or very low density lipoprotein to hepatocyte cultures released apo(a) from the cell surface into the lipoprotein fraction of culture medium. We conclude that assembly of Lp(a) can occur at the cell surface. This represents one potential mechanism of Lp(a) production in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1562070150,"Abstract Autocrine products of osteoclasts such as interleukin-6 may play an important role in normal osteoclast formation and activity. To identify novel stimulatory factors for osteoclasts, we have prepared a mammalian cDNA expression library generated from highly purified human osteoclast-like multinucleated cells (MNC) formed in long term bone marrow cultures and screened this library for autocrine factors that enhance MNC formation. A candidate clone which stimulated MNC formation was isolated. Sequence analysis showed that this cDNA encoded annexin II (AXII). Purified recombinant AXII significantly increased MNC formation in human bone marrow cultures in the absence of 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 and enhanced MNC formation in mouse bone marrow cultures treated with 10(-9) M 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3. The enhanced MNC formation in murine marrow cultures resulted in increased bone resorption. Treatment of fetal rat long bones with AXII and 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 significantly increased bone resorption compared to 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 alone. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that AXII mRNA was expressed at high levels in RNA isolated from highly purified giant cells from osteoclastomas, human osteoclast-like MNC, and pagetic bone. Western blot analysis of conditioned media collected from human marrow cultures showed that AXII was present in the media. Furthermore, approximately 50% of total AXII produced by cells transfected with AXII cDNA was present in the conditioned media. These data suggest that the AXII is an autocrine factor that enhances osteoclast formation and bone resorption and demonstrate a previous unknown function for AXII."
https://openalex.org/W1591614032,"Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 4-kinase catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Here we report the first mammalian cDNA clone of a PtdIns 4-kinase (named PI4K alpha). The 2.6-kb cDNA encodes a protein of 854 amino acids that is highly homologous to the recently cloned yeast PtdIns 4-kinase STT4 and is also homologous to a second yeast PtdIns 4-kinase, PIK1. PI4K alpha has more distant sequence homology to the catalytic domains of mammalian and yeast PtdIns 3-kinases and to the yeast Tor family of proteins. It also has a region of similarity to pleckstrin homology domains and a potential ankyrin repeat. Cross-hybridizing messages were detected in all human tissues investigated. The enzymatic properties of the protein expressed in insect cells are characteristic of type II PtdIns 4-kinases (activated by detergent and inhibited by adenosine), and PI4K alpha is recognized by an antibody specific for type II PtdIns 4-kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1592367145,"Nucleotide-depleted EcF1 binds a maximum of two GTP, ATP, or ADP at noncatalytic sites, whereas all three sites can only be filled by a combination of nucleoside di- and triphosphates. MgPPi prevents binding of GTP and significantly slows ATP binding, suggesting that non-catalytic sites also bind PPi. No binding of GDP at non-catalytic sites could be detected. The slow rate of GTP dissociation from noncatalytic sites (t1/2 = 175 min) is increased 2-8-fold by EDTA, MgPPi, MgADP, or EDTA/ATP, but 23-fold by conditions for ATP hydrolysis. ATP hydrolysis by EcF1, depleted of both its inhibitory epsilon-subunit and endogenous nucleotides, shows a burst of activity. However, it shows a lag if preincubated with MgADP but not when preincubated with Mg2+ alone. For epsilon-depleted EcF1 containing endogenous inhibitory ADP, preincubation with an ATP-regenerating system results in a burst of activity, whereas the control shows a lag. This same enzyme form shows significant inhibition with increasing concentrations of Mg2+ during ATP hydrolysis but lesser levels of inhibition when other NTP substrates are used. With the five-subunit enzyme, increasing amounts of azide cause an increase in the level of inhibition with a corresponding increase in amount of bound nucleotide resistant to rapid chase. Azide-trappable nucleotide is bound at catalytic sites as shown by covalent incorporation of 2-azido-ADP. The results suggest that ligand specificity may not be a reliable means of distinguishing between catalytic and noncatalytic sites and that MgADP inhibition should be taken into account in the kinetic analysis of EcF1 mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1516574010,"Transcriptional regulation of the progesterone receptor gene involves induction by estrogens and down-regulation by progestins, retinoic acid, and AP-1 proteins. We have previously identified an intragenic (+698/+723) estrogen-responsive element present in the progesterone receptor gene, which binds the estradiol receptor and mediates estrogen and 4-OH tamoxifen induction. Progesterone receptor gene expression was equally stimulated by estradiol and 4-OH tamoxifen in the presence of a NH2 terminally deleted estrogen receptor mutant lacking activation function 1, suggesting that activation function 2 was the predominant activation domain. This was confirmed by the lack of activity of an estrogen receptor mutant deleted of activation function 2. Repression by progestins, retinoic acid, and AP-1 was mediated by the same estrogen responsive element although retinoic and progesterone receptors as well as AP-1 proteins did not bind to this element. Repression by these proteins appears to involve different transactivating regions of the estrogen receptor. Repression by retinoic receptors involved only activation function 2 whereas repression by progesterone receptor and AP-1 necessitated both functional domains. Since these proteins act without directly contacting the DNA, it seems likely that repression may be achieved by protein-protein interactions among different domains of the estrogen receptor and/or the transcriptional machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1531392512,"Thimerosal, a sulfhydryl oxidizing reagent, has been shown to induce Ca2+ mobilization in several cell types and to increase the sensitivity of intracellular Ca2+ stores to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Using purified IP3 receptor (IP3R) protein reconstituted in vesicles, we demonstrate pronounced stimulation by thimerosal of its Ca2+ channel activity. Effects of thimerosal are dependent on the redox state of the receptor, implying an action of thimerosal on a critical sulfhydryl group(s) of IP3R. Thimerosal enhances the affinity of IP3R for IP3 binding. The manner in which thimerosal modulates IP3R responsiveness to IP3 provides evidence for receptor heterogeneity with implications for mechanisms of quantal Ca2+ release. These results clarify regulation of IP3R activity by redox modulation."
https://openalex.org/W1588885182,"Thioredoxin (Trx) catalyzes thiol-disulfide oxidoreductions. We and others recently showed that human Trx could function as an autocrine growth factor for human lymphoid cells immortalized by the human T-lymphotrophic virus type I or the Epstein-Barr virus. Here we report that reduced Trx from Escherichia coli generated by NADPH and thioredoxin reductase increases the proliferation of an Epstein-barr virus(+)-B cell line 1G8, which constitutively produces low amounts of human Trx. This proliferative effect involved the activation of protein kinase C through its translocation to the membrane. Staurosporin and calphostin C, two inhibitors of protein kinase C, but not of H8, a protein kinase A inhibitor, were able to block Trx-dependent proliferation. The addition of Trx to 1G8 cells resulted in the formation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and sn-1,2-diacylglycerol by a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, as well as increased free calcium concentration. Diacylglycerol showed a biphasic increase; the first phase, corresponding to an early peak (30 s) of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and a second larger, prolonged phase. The second phase was inhibited by propranolol, a specific inhibitor of phosphohydrolase, indicating that it is most likely derived from phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis by the sequential action of phospholipase D and phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase. Our data suggest that enhanced phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C activity induced by the dithiol form of Trx in 1G8 cells is associated to protein kinase C activation, and thus plays a role in the permanent growth of Epstein-Barr virus-infected B cells."
https://openalex.org/W1531291958,"The NF-kappa B/Rel family of transcription factors is commonly expressed in non-hematopoietic cells in an inactive form within the cytoplasm, complexed with an inhibitor I kappa B protein. Thus, it was surprising that NF-kappa B element-driven heterologous promoter-reporter gene constructs were active upon transient transfection into vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Here, we report that VSMCs express a constitutive nuclear NF-kappa B-like activity. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, nuclear extracts demonstrated binding to a wild type NF-kappa B element but not to those mutated at nucleotides critical for Rel-protein DNA interaction. Binding was abrogated by the presence of I kappa B-alpha. Furthermore, addition of an antibody to the p50 subunit of classical NF-kappa B (but not p65, c-Rel, or RelB) resulted in supershifted complexes. Transactivation of element-driven constructs was negatively affected by co-transfection of a vector expressing a dominant negative p50 subunit, which can dimerize with other Rel subunits but not bind DNA. The long terminal repeat of the human immunodeficiency virus-1, which is driven in part by two NF-kappa B elements, displayed strong activity within VSMCs. This activity was abrogated upon co-transfection of the vector expressing the dominant negative p50 mutant. Taken together, these experiments indicate that VSMCs constitutively express a functional NF-kappa B-like trans-acting factor, which may play a significant role in the regulation of proliferation and viral infection of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2118727047,"Inhibitor-2 (I-2) inhibits the free catalytic subunit of type 1 phosphatase (CS1) and controls the cyclic inactivation/activation of CS1 in the ATP-Mg-dependent protein phosphatase complex. We report here the effect of mutations on these two properties of I-2. Substitution of Thr-72 with Ala, Asp, or Glu generated complexes with CS1 that could not be activated. Mutation of Ser-86 did not affect activation by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) alone but impaired synergistic activation by casein kinase II and GSK-3. Mutations in the region between Thr-72 and Ser-86 did not alter the inhibitory potency of I-2 but prevented complete inactivation of CS1. A mutant without the 35 NH2-terminal residues exhibited an IC50 for CS1 200-fold higher than that of wild-type I-2. However, it formed an inactive phosphatase complex with CS1, which was activated by GSK-3. A mutant with the 59 COOH-terminal residues deleted retained full inhibitory activity and formed an inactive complex that could not be activated by GSK-3. We conclude that the NH2-terminal region of I-2 is involved in inhibition, that the sequence between Thr-72 and Ser-86 is necessary for the conversion of CS1 from an active to an inactive conformation, and that the COOH terminus is required for activation by GSK-3. Thus, different functional domains of I-2 may interact with distinct regions of CS1."
https://openalex.org/W1523705478,"The cytochrome bo complex is a heme BO-type heme-copper quinol oxidase in the aerobic respiratory chain of Escherichia coli and functions as an electron transfer-linked proton pump. To study the protein-mediated electron transfer from substrates to metal centers, we carried out quantitative and qualitative analyses of a bound quinone in the purified oxidase and found that it has a novel high affinity ubiquinone-binding site distinct from the quinol oxidation site. Enzymatic and spectroscopic studies suggest that the quinone-binding site is located close to both the quinol oxidation site in subunit II and low-spin heme B in subunit I. The quinone-binding site of a bound ubiquinone-free oxidase was reconstituted with the potent quinol oxidation site inhibitor 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol, which decreased the Vmax value of the ubiquinol-1 oxidase activity to one-fourth of the control activity. These results indicate that the quinone-binding site is essential for the catalytic functions of the cytochrome bo complex and mediates electron transfer from the quinol oxidation site to the low-spin heme."
https://openalex.org/W1574746068,"The flagellum of trypanosomatids contains two major structural elements, the microtubular axoneme, which is the mechanochemical motor of the cell, and the paraflagellar rod (PFR), a highly organized, three-dimensional fiber network of unknown function. Its occurrence is limited to a few groups of unicellular eukaryotes, the Euglenoids, Dinoflagellates, and Kinetoplastids. The PFR of trypanosomes consists of two similar proteins of approximate molecular masses of 69 and 73 kDa. This laboratory and others have earlier characterized the genes coding for the 69-kDa PFR species in Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi. The present study reports the characterization of the genes coding for the 73-kDa PFR protein from T. brucei. Their gene product, PFR-C, is closely related to, but clearly distinct from, the 69 kDa species PFR-A. This finding indicates that the PFR fibers of the flagellum might represent heteropolymers formed by PFR-A and PFR-C, akin to the situation seen in microtubules or intermediate filaments. PFR-A and PFR-C are each coded for by a similarly organized cluster of four closely spaced, tandemly arranged genes. The 5'-untranslated region of the first gene in each cluster is different from those of the following three genes, which are identical among each other. Conversely, the 3'-untranslated regions of the first three genes of each cluster are identical, while the corresponding region of the fourth gene is different. This unusual organization leads to the generation of mRNAs which contain identical coding sequences but different 5'- and 3'-noncoding regions."
https://openalex.org/W1561021274,"5-Formyltetrahydropteroylpolyglutamate (5-CHO-H4PteGlun) is the only reduced folate derivative that is stable to oxidation and alkaline pH. However, no metabolic role has been assigned to this folate derivative, and evidence for its existence in cells has been questioned. Recently, serine hydroxymethyltransferase was shown to catalyze the formation of 5-CHO-H4PteGlun from 5,10-methenyl-H4PteGlun (Stover, P., and Schirch, V. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14227-14233). We have proposed that 5-CHO-H4PTeGlun may serve as a storage form of reduced folates and one-carbon groups in cells that are in a dormant stage. This hypothesis was tested by determining the levels of H4PteGlun derivatives in the mycelia and conidiospores of Neurospora crassa and a mutant strain that lacks cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase. N. crassa serine hydroxymethyltransferase was purified to homogeneity and characterized with respect to kinetic constants, quaternary structure, stability, and reaction specificity. A new assay for determining the concentration of the polyglutamate forms of H4PteGlun derivatives was also developed. Using this assay, it was shown that 85% of the tetrahydropteroylpolyglutamates in conidiospores was 5-CHO-H4PteGlun. After adding the spores to growth media, the 5-CHO-H4PteGlun was reduced to less than 10% of the folate pool in 20 min. Mycelia had no detectable 5-CHO-H4PteGlun. Only 10-20% of the folate pool in conidiospores from the mutant strain lacking cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase was in the form of 5-CHO-H4PteGlun."
https://openalex.org/W1482083885,"Stabilization of the topoisomerase-cleavable complexes is the common initial event leading to the cytotoxicity of topoisomerase I and II (top1 and top2) inhibitors. Using saintopin (STP), a poison of both topoisomerases, we studied top1- and top2-cleavable complexes (Yamashita, Y., Kawada, S.-Z., Fujii, N., and Nakano, H. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 5838-5845). top1 and top2 sites induced in the presence of STP showed the same preferences for the base located 3' to the topoisomerase-induced DNA break (position +1): preference for G and not C. A camptothecin-resistant top1 with a mutation (Asn722-->Ser) next to the catalytic tyrosine (Tyr723) was cross-resistant to STP, suggesting that both STP and camptothecin interact with the protein near the catalytic tyrosine. These results are consistent with a dual interaction of the drug with the enzyme and the DNA and provide further evidence for the drug-stacking model. This model proposes that topoisomerase inhibitors bind, possibly through hydrogen bonding and/or stacking, with one of the bases flanking the DNA termini (guanine at position +1 in the case of STP) and within the enzyme catalytic pocket, most likely by stacking with the catalytic tyrosine."
https://openalex.org/W1571780540,"We report that two N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases catalyze the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The first enzyme initiates heparan sulfate biosynthesis and can be measured by the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to GlcUA beta 1-3Gal beta 1-O-naphthalenemethanol. The second enzyme catalyzes the polymerization of heparan sulfate and can be measured by the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to the nonreducing terminal GlcUA present in oligosaccharide fragments prepared from the Escherichia coli K5 capsular polysaccharide, N-acetylheparosan. Kinetic characterization of the initiating GlcNAc-transferase (alpha-GlcNAc-TI) indicates an apparent Km for UDP-GlcNAc of 36 +/- 4 microM. The apparent Km for UDP-GlcNAc of the polymerizing GlcNAc-transferase (alpha-GlcNAc-TII) is 230 +/- 30 microM. Both enzymes have broad pH optima and require a divalent cation for activity. alpha-GlcNAc-TI can use both Mn2+ and Ca2+, while alpha-GlcNAc-TII will use only Mn2+. Chinese hamster ovary cells deficient in the synthesis of heparan sulfate and lacking alpha-GlcNAc-TII activity and S49 Thy 1-a lymphoma cells deficient in alpha GlcNAc addition to phosphatidylinositol have wild-type alpha-GlcNAc-TI activity. Thus, distinct alpha-GlcNAc-transferases catalyze the initiation and polymerization of heparan sulfate."
https://openalex.org/W1575506386,"The small GTP-binding protein (G protein) Rac1 is an obligatory participant in the assembly of the superoxide (O2-.)-generating NADPH oxidase complex of macrophages. We investigated the effect of synthetic peptides, mapping within the near carboxyl-terminal domains of Rac1 and of related G proteins, on the activity of NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system consisting of solubilized guinea pig macrophage membrane, a cytosolic fraction enriched in p47phox and p67phox (or total cytosol), highly purified Rac1-GDP dissociation inhibitor for Rho (Rho GDI) complex, and the activating amphiphile, lithium dodecyl sulfate. Peptides Rac1-(178-188) and Rac1-(178-191), but not Rac2-(178-188), inhibited NADPH oxidase activity in a Rac1-dependent system when added prior to or simultaneously with the initiation of activation. However, undecapeptides corresponding to the near carboxyl-terminal domains of RhoA and RhoC and, most notably, a peptide containing the same amino acids as Rac1-(178-188), but in reversed orientation, were also inhibitory. Surprisingly, O2-. production in a Rac2-dependent cell-free system was inhibited by Rac1-(178-188) but not by Rac2-(178-188). Finally, basic polyamino acids containing lysine, histidine, or arginine, also inhibited NADPH oxidase activation. We conclude that inhibition of NADPH oxidase activation by synthetic peptides mapping within the carboxyl-terminal domain of certain small G proteins is not amino acid sequence-specific but related to the presence of a polybasic motif. It has been proposed that such a motif serves as a plasma membrane targeting signal for a number of small G proteins (Hancock, J.F., Paterson, H., and Marshall, C.J. (1990) Cell 63, 133-139)."
https://openalex.org/W1868039841,"Accumulation of the small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) in response to high temperature stress is thought to contribute to the development of thermotolerance in eukaryotic organisms, but the mechanism of action is unknown. We are investigating the chloroplast-localized sHSP, HSP21, with the goal of defining its contribution to the acquisition of thermotolerance in plants. Following an initial heat stress and period of recovery, HSP21 is localized primarily in the soluble fraction of the chloroplast. During an additional stress, HSP21 undergoes a temperature-dependent redistribution from the soluble to the insoluble chloroplast fraction in both isolated organelles and intact plants. The change in HSP21 partitioning is accompanied by depletion of the 10-11 S HSP21-containing complexes from the soluble chloroplast fraction. HSP21 in the insoluble fraction cannot be solubilized by nonionic detergent under conditions that release essentially all the pigments and proteins from the thylakoid membranes, indicating that HSP21 in its insoluble state is not dependent for its insolubility on attachment to an intact membrane. The temperature-dependent redistribution of HSP21 is affected by light intensity but occurs in both leaf and root plastids, suggesting that the function of this activity is not strictly related to the presence of the photosynthetic apparatus. Our study indicates that the chloroplast sHSP has dynamic properties similar to those of cytoplasmic sHSPs from plants and other organisms and suggests that the ability to partition between a soluble and an insoluble state reflects a functionally important property of all sHSPs."

To help define the sequence features necessary for this action, we identified mutations disrupting export mediated by the first spanning sequence (TM1) of the Escherichia coli serine chemoreceptor. Mutant spanning sequences were generated and characterized using beta-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase gene fusions. The protein export function of TM1 was remarkably tolerant of single charged residues, and the introduction of pairs of charged amino acids was necessary to eliminate export. The results are accommodated by a model in which export requires a stretch of uncharged residues whose summed hydrophobicity exceeds a particular threshold value. This threshold approximates the minimum hydrophobicity required for cleavable signal sequence function. In addition, the threshold was near the minimum hydrophobicity observed for wild-type spanning sequences in a collection of topologically characterized membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1744721977,"C3 (native complement component 3) plays a central role in the activation of complement and in the transport and processing of immune complexes. Proteolytic activation of C3 exposes a highly reactive thioester bond which preferentially reacts with the hydroxyl groups of acceptor molecules on activators such as immune complexes or carbohydrates on microorganisms. Recently, a C3 attachment site has been localized on the CH1 domain of IgG1 between Val134 and Lys156. We have synthesized a series of peptide analogs of this region to identify the preferred residue for C3b (the proteolytically activated form of C3) attachment. The parent peptide included all 6 hydroxyl-containing amino acids present in the proposed binding site and was highly reactive with activated C3. The C3b-peptide complex was sensitive to hydroxylamine as was C3b-IgG indicating that both were ester-linked. The kinetic profile of hydrolysis of the C3b-peptide complex under physiologic conditions was found to be nearly identical to the profiles of C3b-IgG, C3b-IgG1, and C3b-glycerol complexes. Site-specific amino acid substitution of threonine and serine residues in the peptide indicated that, in contrast to the attachment site in C4b, little or no attachment occurred at serine residues. The threonine corresponding to Thr144 in the CH1 domain of IgG was found to be the major acceptor site for C3b. Thr148 was the second most reactive site on the peptide, but this residue is buried in native IgG."
https://openalex.org/W1621722114,"Abstract Earlier studies have shown that the reactions of cytochrome P450 with arylhydrazines yield aryl-iron complexes, and that oxidative migration of the aryl groups to the pyrrole nitrogens of the heme provides information on the active site topology. Comparison of cytochromes P450terp (CYP108), P450cam (CYP101), and P450BM-3 (CYP102) by this method suggests that the active site of P450terp is effectively more sterically restricted than those of the other two enzymes and is primarily open above pyrrole ring D of the heme group. This experimental model of the P450terp active site differs from that deduced by x-ray crystallography, which shows that pyrrole ring C is also relatively open. The results suggest that aryl shifts can be used to probe conformations of the active site other than that trapped in the crystal state. Identification of the product formed from alpha-terpineol by P450terp shows that the enzyme exclusively hydroxylates the most sterically accessible, allylically activated position. The enzyme also oxidizes substituted thioanisoles and styrenes unrelated to alpha-terpineol to the corresponding sulfoxides and epoxides. In the case of 4-methylthioanisole and 4-methylstyrene, methyl hydroxylation competes effectively with sulfoxidation and epoxidation in the reaction catalyzed by P450terp but not those catalyzed by P450BM-3 or P450cam. Comparison of the stereoselectively of thioanisole sulfoxidation and styrene epoxidation by P450terp, P450cam, and P450BM-3 shows that P450terp is the most, and P450BM-3 the least, stereospecific. The stereospecificity of thioanisole sulfoxidation by P450terp depends on the electronic nature of the para-substituent and rises from an (R):(S) ratio of 20:80 for p-MeO to a value of < 01:99 for p-CN. The (R):(S) ratio for the epoxides produced by P450terp is approximately 90:10 for the two substituents investigated. Cytochromes P450cam and P450BM-3 are much less stereoselective. A model is suggested by the stereochemical and topological data for the binding of substrates in P450terp."
https://openalex.org/W2168199251,"The spectrum of mutations induced upon in vivo replication of an M13 genome containing a site-specifically located propanodeoxyguanosine (PdG) adduct was determined. PdG was used as a model for the major deoxyguanosine adduct produced on reaction of DNA with the endogenous genotoxin malondialdehyde. PdG was introduced at position 6256 of M13MB102 by ligating the oligodeoxynucleotide 5'-GGT(PdG)TCCG-3' into an 8-base gap in the (-)-strand of duplex M13MB102. Replication of the adducted strand was maximized by incorporation of uracil into the unadducted (+)-strand. Following replication of dG-containing and PdG-containing M13MB102 genomes in Escherichia coli JM105, frameshift mutations were detected as phenotypic changes in the lacZ alpha marker gene. Base pair substitutions were detected by differential hybridization using 32P-labeled 13-mers bearing different bases opposite position 6256. Neither frameshift nor base pair substitution mutations were detected following replication of PdG-adducted genomes in non-SOS-induced JM105. However, PdG-->T transversions and PdG-->A transitions were detected following transformation of PdG-adducted M13MB102 into SOS-induced JM105. Both types of mutations were detected at comparable frequencies, and the total mutation frequency was approximately 2%. The results indicate that PdG is an efficient premutagenic lesion in E. coli strains in which the SOS response is induced."
https://openalex.org/W1567588341,"Abstract Protein C inhibitor (PCI) is a plasma serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) that is a major physiological regulator of activated protein C. Inhibition of its target proteinase is accelerated by heparin in a reaction that involves the binding of both inhibitor and proteinase to heparin to form a ternary complex. This study was undertaken to understand the role of the H helix region (residues 264-278) of PCI in heparin binding and used (i) a recombinant truncated PCI fusion protein of the first 294 residues, (ii) H helix synthetic peptides containing single Arg/Lys-->Glu substitutions, and (iii) site-directed Ala mutagenesis of 4 basic residues (Arg-269, Lys-270, Lys-276, and Lys-277) in the H helix region of full-length recombinant PCI (rPCI) expressed in Baculovirus. The PCI fusion protein interfered in heparin-accelerated PCI-proteinase inhibition reactions, and it bound to heparin-Sepharose. Compared to the wild-type PCI fusion protein, deletion of the H helix from the fusion protein resulted in a reduction of both heparin-Sepharose binding and the ability to compete for heparin during PCI-proteinase inhibition reactions. Competition assays with H helix synthetic peptides revealed that the R269E altered peptide was the least effective at blocking heparin-catalyzed PCI-proteinase inhibition reactions. Compared with full-length active wild-type rPCI, R269A: K270A and K276A:K277A rPCI both had reduced heparin-Sepharose binding, but only R269A:K270A rPCI showed a loss of heparin-accelerated proteinase inhibition for both activated protein C and thrombin. We conclude that a major heparin-binding site of PCI is the H helix, unlike its heparin-binding serpin homologues antithrombin and heparin cofactor II, which bind heparin primarily through the D helix."

The two subunits of Calothrix sp. PCC 7601 C-phycoerythrin, overexpressed together as apopolypeptides in Escherichia coli, formed inclusion bodies. Purified apo-alpha was soluble in the absence of urea, whereas the apo-beta subunit was only soluble at high urea concentrations. Products of nonenzymatic addition of PEB and phycocyanobilin (PCB) to apo-alpha were characterized by isolation of bilin peptides and spectroscopy. Reaction of PEB with the apo-alpha subunit led primarily to 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin (Cys-82) or urobilin (Cys-139) adducts, and small amounts of the natural PEB adducts at both Cys-82 and Cys-139. PCB reacted primarily with Cys-82 to form phycocyanobilin and mesobiliverdin adducts. Both PEB and PCB also formed relatively small amounts of adducts with Cys-59, which is not a bilin attachment residue in natural phycoerythrin. Sodium azide was found to promote the addition of PEB to simple thiols but not to apo-alpha phycoerythrin."
https://openalex.org/W1501561646,"For elucidating the contribution of structurally perturbed antigenic residues upon antibody binding to antigen-antibody interaction, the interaction between hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) and HyHEL10 Fv fragment, which is one of several monoclonal antibodies against HEL and structurally well defined (Padlan, E.A., Silverton, E. W., Sheriff, S., Cohen, G. H., Smith-Gill, S. J., and Davies, D. R. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 5938-5942), was investigated. Asp-101 and Trp-62 of HEL, whose conformations are perturbed by the binding of antibody HyHEL10 in this interaction, were replaced with Gly, and the resulting interactions were studied by assay of the inhibition of the lysozyme activity with the Fv fragment and by titration calorimetry. The results can be summarized as follows. 1) It was possible to prepare the fully functional Fv fragment of HyHEL10 using a secretory expression system in Escherichia coli. Its inhibition profile for HEL activity was almost indistinguishable from that of HyHEL10 IgG, and the contribution of enthalpy to driving the interaction was shown to be significant. 2) A thermodynamic study of the interaction between the D101G mutant HEL and the Fv fragment revealed that, although the negative enthalpy change was smaller than that for the wild type, the Gibbs energy was almost identical to that of the wild type, which resulted from the smaller entropy loss. 3) Study of the interaction between the W62G mutant HEL and this Fv fragment indicated that the rotation of the Trp-62 indole ring upon binding of the antibody made an enthalpic contribution to antibody-antigen interaction, although Trp-62 of HEL was proposed not to be the direct contact residue in the HyHEL10.HEL complex. 4) From these results, it was confirmed experimentally that structural perturbations of antigenic residues upon antibody binding of antigen would contribute to the gain of enthalpic energy, in spite of partial offset by entropic loss, and to driving the interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1508686037,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae CPT1 and EPT1 genes are structural genes encoding sn-1,2-diacylglycerol choline phosphotransferase and sn-1,2-diacylglycerol choline/ethanolamine phosphotransferase, respectively. Incorporation of 32Pi into phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine in wild type and ept1 strains was decreased in the presence of exogenous inositol. In contrast, inositol did not affect 32Pi incorporation into phospholipid in cpt1 or cpt1ept1 strains. In membranes isolated from wild type and ept1 strains grown in the presence of inositol or inositol/choline, the CPT1-derived cholinephosphotransferase activities were reduced 40-50 and 65%, respectively. Inositol-dependent reductions in CPT1 derived choline-phosphotransferase activity correlated with transcript levels in both wild type and ept- backgrounds. The ethanolaminephosphotransferase activity of the EPT1 gene product in wild type cells was reduced 40% by exogenous inositol alone and 50% by inositol/choline. In the cpt1 strain, however, the ethanolaminephosphotransferase activity was unaffected by exogenous inositol or inositol/choline. The inositol-dependent reduction of ethanolaminephosphotransferase activity observed in wild type cells correlated with reduced levels of EPT1 transcripts; in the cpt1 strain, EPT1 transcript levels were not affected by inositol. These results indicate that 1) a functional CPT1 gene or gene product is required for inositol-dependent regulation of phospholipid synthesis; 2) the enzyme activities of both the CPT1 and EPT1 gene products are repressed by inositol and inositol/choline, and require an intact CPT1 gene; 3) inositol mediates its regulatory effects on phospholipid synthesis via a transcriptional mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1538949060,"To characterize the structural features of the quinol oxidation site (the QL site) of the cytochrome bo complex, a heme-copper respiratory oxidase in Escherichia coli, we carried out structure-inhibitory potency analyses using 7 p-benzoquinones and 33 substituted phenols. Their effects on its ubiquinol-1 oxidase activity were compared with those on the cytochrome bd complex in E. coli and on cytochromes o and alpha 1 in Acetobacter aceti. They showed similar structural properties of the QL site, although cytochrome o was more sensitive to 4-cyanophenols, suggesting a specific interaction of the hydrogen bond-accepting cyano group with the binding pocket. Replacing one of the methyl groups of 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, which is the most potent competitive inhibitor, with an ethyl group markedly decreased the inhibitory activity, indicating that the QL site specifically recognizes one C = O group with two methyl groups as the ortho-substituents. In substituted phenols, ortho-chlorine substituents were the most effective in recognition, and the electron-withdrawing ability of the para-substituent determined an inhibitory potency, probably by stabilizing an anionic form. Based on these observations, we postulate that the QL site of the cytochrome bo complex asymmetrically recognizes exogenous ligands and that this property accounts for the sequential electron transfer from ubiquinols to the low-spin heme."
https://openalex.org/W1531590504,"The roles of the alpha- and beta-isoforms of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3'-kinase p85 regulatory subunit were studied with isoform-specific antisera in three model systems in which the insulin receptor mediates rapid phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Insulin receptor signaling stimulated the association of IRS-1 with p85 alpha protein, and p85 alpha-associated PI 3-kinase activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-T) and COS-1 cells expressing high levels of human insulin receptors. While not detectable in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the p85 beta isoform was also found to associate with IRS-1 in response to insulin receptor activation in COS-1 and CHO-T cells. However, selective immunoprecipitation of p85 beta from unstimulated COS-1 or CHO-T cell lysates was accompanied by higher levels of PI 3-kinase activity than that associated with p85 alpha. Remarkably, the large stimulation of PI 3-kinase activity associated with p85 alpha (7.8 +/- 2.0-fold, n = 6) in insulin-treated CHO-T cells was not observed in p85 beta immunoprecipitates (1.8 +/- 0.6-fold, n = 6), and in COS-1 cells p85 beta-associated PI 3-kinase activity was completely insensitive to stimulation by the insulin receptor. These data suggest the novel hypothesis that binding of p85 beta to IRS-1 complexes in COS-1 and CHO-T cells does not mediate marked activation of PI 3-kinase activity as does p85 alpha."

The sequenced cDNA had 2,385 base pairs, with a predicted protein of 685 amino acids and M(r) 77,500. The antigen reactive with anti-EJ was immunoaffinity-purified from HeLa cells, and two proteolytic peptides matched areas of the predicted amino acid sequence. The sequence was 61.6% identical with that of silk moth glycyl-tRNA synthetase. Several very highly conserved regions were identified, including the single class II synthetase motif region and an N-terminal region similar to one found in at least three other synthetases. Near identity in other regions suggested that they also had important functions. Expression of the cDNA in Escherichia coli yielded a protein of expected size that reacted with the autoantibodies and was active as glycyl-tRNA synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1531934178,"Drug resistance is a significant impediment to the therapy of African sleeping sickness in humans. To evaluate molecular mechanisms that contribute to drug resistance in African trypanosomes, a clonal strain of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, MPA10, was selected in medium containing mycophenolic acid (MPA), an inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH) activity. IMPDH activity in MPA10 cells was approximately 6-fold higher than that of wild type parental cells, although the enzymes in both strains were equally sensitive to inhibition by MPA. To evaluate the mechanism of IMPDH overexpression in MPA10 cells, the gene encoding IMPDH (impdh) was isolated from a T.b. brucei library by cross-hybridization to the Leishmania donovani impdh. Sequence analysis indicated that the T. brucei IMPDH was 76% identical with the L. donovani IMPDH. The T. brucei impdh hybridized to a 2.7-kb transcript that was expressed at approximately 10-fold greater levels in the MPA10 cells, and this impdh overexpression could be ascribed to an approximately 10-fold amplification of the impdh copy number. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis revealed that the extra impdh copies in MPA10 cells were localized to an approximately 6.0-Mb chromosome that comigrated with the wild type chromosome encompassing impdh. The amplification of impdh could be ascribed to an increased copy number of this 6.0-Mb chromosome, and a predicted augmented DNA content in MPA10 cells was confirmed by flow cytometry. This is the first demonstration that DNA amplification can serve as a molecular mechanism by which T. brucei become resistant to cytotoxic drugs, and the amplification of the 6.0-Mb chromosome represents a novel mechanism of drug resistance in parasitic protozoa."
https://openalex.org/W2128322471,"Mu A protein, the 75-kDa phage transposase, consists of three domains: a 30-kDa NH2 terminus, a 35-kDa central domain, and a 10-kDa COOH terminus (Nakayama, C., Teplow, D. B., and Harshey, R. M. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 1809-1813). Genetic and biochemical experiments have demonstrated that the COOH-terminal domain must be present for functional interaction with Mu B protein. To further investigate the COOH-terminal domain of Mu A, we fused this 89-amino acid region to the glutathione S-transferase gene to facilitate subsequent expression and purification. We show that either the glutathione S-transferase-peptide fusion protein or the COOH-terminal peptide severed from glutathione S-transferase is active in Mu B interaction. Addition of the COOH-terminal domain to the in vitro strand transfer reaction inhibits intermolecular strand transfer by a mechanism previously characterized for intact Mu A protein (Baker, T. A., Mizuuchi, M., and Mizuuchi, K. (1991) Cell 65, 1003-1013), although the COOH-terminal domain is 70 times less effective than intact Mu A. The transient interaction between the COOH-terminal domain and Mu B does not inhibit Mu B stimulation of the strand cleavage and intramolecular strand transfer activity of Mu A. Deletion analysis has shown that the last 36 amino acids are sufficient for interaction with Mu B, but that removal of as few as 4 amino acids from the COOH terminus renders the peptide inactive. The recovery of an active COOH-terminal domain of Mu A will facilitate future structure/function studies of the Mu transposase."
https://openalex.org/W1524183389,"The cytochrome bo3-ubiquinol oxidase, one of two ubiquinol oxidases in Escherichia coli, is a member of the heme-copper oxidase superfamily. The enzyme contains four protein subunits (I-IV) with apparent molecular masses of 58, 33, 22, and 17 kDa, respectively. Cytochrome bo3 catalyzes the 2-electron oxidation of ubiquinol and the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. Although the primary structures of all four subunits have been determined, the ubiquinol-binding site has not been investigated. The photoreactive radiolabeled azidoubiquinone derivative 3-[3H]azido-2-methyl-5-methoxy-6-geranyl-1,4-benzoquinone (azido-Q), which has been widely used in locating the ubiquinone-binding sites of other enzymes, was used to identify the subunit(s) involved in the binding of quinol to cytochrome bo3. When reduced by dithioerythritol, the azido-Q derivative functioned as a substrate with partial effectiveness, suggesting that azido-Q interacts with a legitimate quinol-binding site. When cytochrome bo3 was incubated with an 8-fold molar excess of azido-Q, illumination by UV light for 10 min resulted in a 50% loss of activity. The uptake of radiolabeled azido-Q by the oxidase complex upon illumination correlated with the photoinactivation. In the presence of the competitive inhibitor 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline or ubiquinol, the rate of azido-Q uptake and the loss of enzyme activity upon illumination decreased. Analysis of the distribution of radioactivity among the subunits after separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that subunit II was heavily labeled by azido-Q, but that the other subunits were not. This suggests that the ubiquinol-binding site of the cytochrome bo3 complex is located at least partially on subunit II."

In hormone binding assays using [3H]cortisol, half-maximal saturation of dexamethasone competition was achieved at 10 pM with hGR M565R and hGRA573Q compared to 10 nM with wild type hGR. Similar results were obtained in competition assays with [3H]dexamethasone and the glucocorticoid antagonist RU 486. The substitution mutants M565R and A573Q demonstrated a higher relative affinity for aldosterone compared to the wild type hGR. In CV-1 cells cotransfected with the mutant receptors, hGR M565R and A573Q showed a remarkable 6-fold elevated transcription activation of the chimeric reporter gene mouse mammary tumor virus-chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (MMTV-CAT). The mutant hGR G567A failed to bind agonists and antagonists efficiently. Immunoblotting with hGR specific antibodies of the whole cell extract from transfected CV-1 cells revealed that these differences in hormone binding and transcription activation were not due to the decreased levels of expression. These data support that idea that Gly567 in the hGR hormone-binding domain lies in a region crucial to ligand binding and transactivation function."

In this study we have overexpressed I-DmoIl and I-DmoIc and purified the enzymes from Escherichia coli. The optimal conditions for the enzymatic activity in vitro were determined, and the enzyme was used to delimit the recognition boundary on its DNA substrate (14-20 nucleotides), an intronless 23 S rRNA gene. Despite belonging to the archaeal kingdom, and being the product of a hyperthermophile, I-DmoI shares many properties with LAGLIDADG intron and intein endonucleases in other kingdoms. These results support the view that these phylogenetically diverse enzymes, which function to mobilize the DNA sequences that encode them, share a common ancestry."

We found no evidence for a sequence encoding a membrane localization signal in the hmg1 gene, despite the presence of HMG1 protein on the surface of several cell types. The hmg1 promoter coincides with a CpG island, contains no TATA sequence, and derives the expression of reporter genes placed under its control.

https://openalex.org/W1495400031,"G-protein-coupled receptors mediate a wide variety of responses to extracellular stimuli in eucaryotic cells. Binding of the ligand to these receptors is thought to involve contacts within a pocket from the sequences of these genes. A family of four surface cAMP receptors that mediate responses to secreted cAMP coordinates the developmental program of Dictyostelium. A large difference in affinity for cAMP exists between cAR1 (25 and 230 nM) and cAR2 (> 5 microns). To understand the basis for this affinity difference, we generated an extensive series of cAR1/cAR2 and cAR2/cAR1 chimeras using a technique designated random chimeragenesis. When a linearized plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli, tandemly positioned cAR1 and cAR2 genes crossed over at homologous regions. The cAMP binding properties and EC50 values for agonist-induced phosphorylation of each of the chimeras were characterized in order to map the domains that determine the affinity. These studies implicated a domain in the second extracellular loop in which only 5 residues differ between the two receptors as the major determinant of affinity. A secondary domain including residues 110-147 (11 residue differences) was identified as a minor determinant of affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1575349115,"The cAMP-responsive element (CRE) modulator protein CREM alpha has been proposed to be a negative regulator of the CRE-binding protein (CREB). Precisely how CREM alpha inhibits CREB function is unclear, however. CREM alpha and CREB have highly related structures, and both proteins bind to consensus CRE sequences with similar affinities. Furthermore, both proteins can be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). Two models have been proposed to explain how CREM alpha could prevent the activation of genes by PKA-phosphorylated CREB: inhibitory CREM alpha homodimers could prevent occupancy of the CRE by CREB, or CREM alpha could block gene activation by forming non-functional CREB.CREM alpha heterodimers. To determine whether CREB-CREM alpha heterodimers are indeed non-functional, we engineered the leucine zipper regions of the two proteins to direct the pattern of dimerization. We then tested the biological activities of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated complexes in in vivo transcription assays. Our results indicate that CREM alpha can contribute to PKA-mediated gene activation when selectively heterodimerized with CREB. Furthermore, this transcriptional activity depends upon the ability of the complexes to be phosphorylated by PKA."
https://openalex.org/W1637015099,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) is abundant in plasma and is potentially capable of degrading the anchor utilized by many cell surface proteins. The goal of this work was to study structural features of the GPI-PLD that might be involved in regulation of its activity. Trypsin cleaved the 100-110 kDa GPI-PLD polypeptide into three major fragments (two of approximately 40 kDa and a carboxyl-terminal fragment of 30 kDa) which were relatively resistant to further proteolysis. Pretreatment of the GPI-PLD with chelators resulted in complete degradation. During the cleavage process the GPI-PLD enzymatic activity increased approximately 3-4-fold but no other major change in its properties (e.g. inhibition by chelators and lipids, thermal stability, oligomerization, etc.) was observed. Intact or trypsinized GPI-PLD bound 45Ca2+ (approximately 5.5 ions/molecule GPI-PLD; Kd approximately 16.1 microM as determined by equilibrium dialysis) which could not be blocked by the addition of other divalent metal ions. However, inhibition of enzymatic activity by divalent cation chelators appeared to involve removal of bound Zn2+ rather than Ca2+. A metal analysis of GPI-PLD revealed approximately 5 and 10 atom/molecule of calcium and zinc, respectively. The data suggest that the predicted integrin E-F hand-like sites in GPI-PLD are functional but not directly involved in enzymatic activity."

Treatment of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells expressing the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor or a macrophage IgG Fc receptor with the calmodulin antagonist N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalene sulfonamide (W-7) inhibited their ability to mediate transcytosis of dimeric IgA or lysosomal degradation of immune complexes, respectively. Since both pathways rely on intact microtubules, the inhibitory effect of W-7 may reflect an effect on calmodulin-regulated microtubule function. However, although W-7 did not affect endocytosis, the drug also inhibited recycling of receptors from apical or basolateral endosomes back to the respective surfaces. Thus, calmodulin may regulate microtubule-dependent and independent endocytic membrane transport pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1495283095,"Light-driven proton pumping in bacteriorhodopsin involves deprotonation of the retinylidene Schiff base during M formation and reprotonation during N formation as key steps. This study reports on the spectroscopic characterization of the bacteriorhodopsin mutant Tyr-57-->Asp (Y57D). The results reveal that although formation of the M intermediate and Schiff base deprotonation is blocked, the mutant still exhibits a significant level of light-driven proton translocation. The photocycle of Y57D involves formation of K and L intermediates accompanied by the normal chromophore isomerization and changes in the hydrogen bonding of Asp-96 and Asp-115. However, an additional Asp residue deprotonates during formation of the L intermediate along with a transmembrane alpha-helical structural change that normally occurs upon N formation. We postulate that proton transport in Y57D occurs through a redirected pathway that does not involve the deprotonation of the Schiff base. Chromophore isomerization, which normally results in the transfer of a proton from the Schiff base to Asp-85, instead causes the deprotonation of Asp-57 in Y57D, most likely through an interaction involving Asp-212. This deprotonation of Asp-57 causes the release of a proton into the extracellular medium. Reprotonation of Asp-57 occurs through the Schiff base reprotonation pathway, which consists of a hydrogen-bonded network of residues spanning from Asp-96 to Asp-212. The results also indicate that the transmembrane alpha-helical structural changes observed during N formation (Rothschild, K.J., Marti, T., Sonar, S., He, Y.W., Rath, P., Fischer, W., Bousche, O., and Khorana, H. G. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 27046-27052) do not require deprotonation of Asp-96 or of the Schiff base."

In the present study, deletion of either the CAD or exon 9 from CREB-GAL4 (CRG) reduced constitutive activity to less than 2-fold, without affecting kinase inducible activity. However, fusion of the CAD to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (CAD-G4) stimulated transcription, whereas fusion of exon 9 sequences did not. Deletion of the amino-terminal flanking region of exon 9 (aa 165-180), but not COOH-terminal flanking sequences (aa 243-252), decreased constitutive activation in either the CAD-G4 or CRG background. Deletion of the previously characterized glutamine-rich region (Q3, aa 218-252) or of a region containing a hydrophobic cluster of amino acids (HC, aa 180-218) also reduced constitutive activation by either CAD-G4 or CRG. No single mutation of hydrophobic residues within HC impaired activity of the CAD, but double and triple mutations did, suggesting that multiple weak interactions are involved in function of the HC region. Thus, exon 9 of the CREB gene is necessary but not sufficient for constitutive activation. The CAD requires three distinct regions for function, suggesting that CREB may interact with multiple targets in the RNA polymerase II complex."
https://openalex.org/W2162097506,"The influence of proline on bending of the alpha-helix was investigated by replacement of the proline residue located in the middle of the long alpha-helix of the Fis protein with alanine, serine, or leucine. Each of the three substitutions folded into a stable protein with the same or higher melting points than the wild-type, but only Pro61Ala was functionally active in stimulating Hin-mediated DNA inversion. Pro61Ala formed crystals that were isomorphous with the wild-type protein allowing the structure to be determined at 1.9-A resolution by x-ray diffraction methods. The structure of the Pro61Ala mutant is almost identical to the wild-type protein, consistent with its near wild-type activity. One of the alpha-helices, the B-helix, is kinked in the wild-type Fis protein by 20 degrees which was previously assumed to be caused solely by the presence of proline 61 in the center of the helix. However, the B-helix is still kinked by 16 degrees when proline 61 is replaced by alanine. Local peptide backbone movement around residue 57 adjusts the geometry of the helix to accommodate the new main chain hydrogen bond between the -CO group in Glu57 and the -NH group in Ala61. Thus, the kink of the alpha-helix in Pro61Ala does not require the presence of proline."
https://openalex.org/W1658617016,"Heteronuclear single-quantum coherence two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy has been used to investigate the active site of endoglucanase K (46 kDa) from Bacillus sp. KSM-330, in which Trp are important for expression of the activity. Endoglucanase K, which was specifically labeled with [indole-2-13C]Trp, was prepared from recombinant Bacillus subtilis that carried the gene for this enzyme on an expression vector, pHSP-KC331. Twelve cross-peaks originating from the C-2 position of Trp residues of endoglucanase K were separately observed in 1H-13C heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectrum, and six of the cross-peaks have been assigned site-specifically by using site-directed mutagenesis. The chemical shifts of the cross-peaks originating from Trp-174 and Trp-243 were affected by the addition of cellotriose that was used as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. On the basis of the NMR data obtained after chemical modification of the enzyme by N-bromosuccinimide, it appears that Trp-174 was oxidized first with retention of 56% of the original activity and Trp-243 was then oxidized with complete loss of activity. Substitution of Trp-174 or Trp-243 by Tyr residue caused a decrease in the specific activity of the enzyme to 49 or 8% of that of the wild-type enzyme, respectively. Km values of these mutant enzymes for p-nitrophenyl beta-D-cellotrioside increased to 5 and 8 times those of the wild-type enzyme, respectively, while kcat values of both of the mutant enzymes decreased to one-fifth of those of the wild-type enzymes. These results suggest that Trp-174 and Trp-243 play an important role in binding of the substrate and/or in the catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1588961760,"Transforming growth factor beta 1 regulates the expression of extracellular matrix adhesion molecules and the carcinoembryonic antigen gene family of glycoproteins in the Moser colon carcinoma cell line. Expression of fibronectin antisense RNA in the Moser cells down-regulated fibronectin mRNA expression and blocked the ability of transforming growth factor beta 1 to stimulate fibronectin secretion. Cells expressing antisense fibronectin RNA exhibited a higher rate of proliferation, changed their morphology, and produced more laminin in response to treatment with transforming growth factor beta 1. The stimulation of carcinoembryonic antigen secretion by transforming growth factor beta 1 (which normally lagged 10-16 h behind that of fibronectin secretion stimulated by transforming growth factor beta 1) was blocked by the expression of antisense fibronectin RNA. Thus, the stimulation of fibronectin secretion by transforming growth factor beta 1 was a prerequisite for subsequent stimulation of carcinoembryonic antigen secretion. In addition, the stimulation of the cellular expression of carcinoembryonic antigen and three carcinoembryonic antigen cross-reactive species of glycoproteins by transforming growth factor beta 1 was down-modulated in cells expressing antisense fibronectin RNA. We therefore conclude that fibronectin may play an important role in the mechanisms of transforming growth factor beta 1 regulation of the expression of carcino-embryonic antigen gene family of glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1526927660,"Abstract We have established and characterized four human androgen receptor (AR) mutants, AR C560F, C560W, C560Y, C560S). To assess the functional significance of these substitutions, we compared the transcriptional activation, hormone binding affinity, receptor-DNA interaction, and the subcellular distribution of the hormone-receptor complexes. Binding studies showed that all mutants bound methyltrienolone (R1881) with wild type affinity (Kd = 0.5 nM). Transactivation efficiency, as compared to wild type AR, increased 150% with C560F and decreased to 70% with C560W and C560Y and to 40% with mutant C560S. Subcellular receptor distribution showed that 85% of C560F bound with hormone was extracted from the nuclear fraction and 15% in the cytosol. Gel mobility shift assays showed that C560F expressed in CV-1 cells bound to an androgen responsive element (ARE) with equal efficiency as the wild type human AR. The mutants C560W and C560Y demonstrated a lower ability to bind to ARE, whereas C560S showed a significantly lower ability to interact with ARE. We propose that the change in polarity introduced into the loop structure by C560S leads to a shorter period of contact between the mutant receptor and DNA resulting in decreased transcriptional activation levels."
https://openalex.org/W1506598911,"The 64-kDa membrane-bound glycoprotein of the cellular slime mold Polysphondylium pallidum (referred to as gp64), seems to be implicated in cell-cell adhesion. Previously we have isolated a full-length gp64 cDNA, determined its nucleotide sequence, and found that all cysteine residues in the protein are involved in the formation of disulfide bonds. The disulfide arrangement of the 36 cysteines in gp64 was established by analysis of proteolytically cleaved protein and sequence analysis of cystine-containing fragments. Since gp64 has 36 Cys residues, 18 disulfide bonds must exist and the positions of 15 of them were determined. The 15 disulfide bonds in gp64 constitute five characteristic, so-called Sushi domains. In a Sushi domain, the first Cys in a sequence is connected to the third one and the second Cys to the fourth one. This is the first report describing the presence of Sushi domains in a cellular slime mold protein. From these data, gp64 appears to be distinct from all other previously described cell-adhesion proteins."
