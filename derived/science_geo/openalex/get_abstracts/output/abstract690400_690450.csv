https://openalex.org/W4221003460,"Today, global challenges such as poverty, inequality, and sustainability are at the core of the academic debate. This centrality has only increased since the transition from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), whose scope is to shift the world on to a path of resilience focused on promoting sustainable development. The main purpose of this paper is to develop a critical yet comprehensive scientometric analysis of the global academic production on the SDGs, from its approval in 2015 to 2020, conducted using Web of Science (WoS) database. Despite it being a relatively short period of time, scholars have published more than five thousand research papers in the matter, mainly in the fields of green and sustainable sciences. The attained results show how prolific authors and schools of knowledge are emerging, as key topics such as climate change, health and the burden diseases, or the global governance of these issues. However, deeper analyses also show how research gaps exist, persist and, in some cases, are widening. Greater understanding of this body of research is needed, to further strengthen evidence-based policies able to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the achievement of the SDGs."

Kurz, a medicinal plant, shows numerous pharmacological properties which may be attributed to the bioactive compounds produced by O. indicum or due to associated endophytes. In the present study, leaf of O. indicum was evaluated for the presence of associated fungal endophytes, and antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of bioactive compounds produced from them. Using culture-dependent approach, eight fungal endophytes belonging to five different genera were identified. Two endophytes Daldinia eschscholtzii and Ectophoma multirostrata have been reported for the first time from the leaf of O. indicum plant. High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) of ethyl acetate (EA) extract of isolated fungal endophytes showed a distinct fingerprinting profile in EA extract of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Among identified endophytes, EA extract of C. gloeosporioides showed significant antioxidant activity against DPPH free radical, superoxide anion radical, nitric oxide radical and hydroxyl radical with EC50 values of 22.24±1.302 μg/mL, 67.46±0.576 μg/mL, 80.10±0.706 μg/mL and 61.55±1.360 μg/mL, respectively. EA extract of C. gloeosporioides exhibited potential cytotoxicity against HCT116, HeLa and HepG2 cancer cell lines with IC50 values of 76.59 μg/mL, 176.20 μg/mL and 1750.70 μg/mL, respectively. A comparative HPTLC fingerprinting and the antioxidant activity of C. gloeosporioides associated with two different hosts (leaf of O. indicum and dead twigs of other plant) showed that C. gloeosporioides produces bioactive compounds in a host-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W4220668093,"The variability of clinical course and prognosis of COVID-19 highlights the necessity of patient sub-group risk stratification based on clinical data. In this study, clinical data from a cohort of Indian COVID-19 hospitalized patients is used to develop risk stratification and mortality prediction models. We analyzed a set of 70 clinical parameters including physiological and hematological for developing machine learning models to identify biomarkers. We also compared the Indian and Wuhan cohort, and analyzed the role of steroids. A bootstrap averaged ensemble of Bayesian networks was also learned to construct an explainable model for discovering actionable influences on mortality and days to outcome. We discovered blood parameters, diabetes, co-morbidity and SpO2 levels as important risk stratification features, whereas mortality prediction is dependent only on blood parameters. XGboost and logistic regression model yielded the best performance on risk stratification and mortality prediction, respectively (AUC score 0.83, AUC score 0.92). Blood coagulation parameters (ferritin, D-Dimer and INR), immune and inflammation parameters IL6, LDH and Neutrophil (%) are common features for both risk and mortality prediction. Compared with Wuhan patients, Indian patients with extreme blood parameters indicated higher survival rate. Analyses of medications suggest that a higher proportion of survivors and mild patients who were administered steroids had extreme neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages. The ensemble averaged Bayesian network structure revealed serum ferritin to be the most important predictor for mortality and Vitamin D to influence severity independent of days to outcome. The findings are important for effective triage during strains on healthcare infrastructure."
https://openalex.org/W4220894980,"Most deep learning-based action recognition models focus only on short-term motions, so the model often causes misjudgments of actions that are combined by multiple processes, such as long jump, high jump, etc. The proposal of Temporal Segment Networks (TSN) enables the network to capture long-term information in the video, but ignores that some unrelated frames or areas in the video can also cause great interference to action recognition. To solve this problem, a soft attention mechanism is introduced in TSN and a Spatial-Temporal Attention Temporal Segment Networks (STA-TSN), which retains the ability to capture long-term information and enables the network to adaptively focus on key features in space and time, is proposed. First, a multi-scale spatial focus feature enhancement strategy is proposed to fuse original convolution features with multi-scale spatial focus features obtained through a soft attention mechanism with spatial pyramid pooling. Second, a deep learning-based key frames exploration module, which utilizes a soft attention mechanism based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) to adaptively learn temporal attention weights, is designed. Third, a temporal-attention regularization is developed to guide our STA-TSN to better realize the exploration of key frames. Finally, the experimental results show that our proposed STA-TSN outperforms TSN in the four public datasets UCF101, HMDB51, JHMDB and THUMOS14, as well as achieves state-of-the-art results."
https://openalex.org/W4221068511,"The composition of the gut microbiota plays an important role in maintaining the balance between health and disease. However, there is considerably less information on the composition of the gut microbiota of non-Western communities. This study was designed to investigate the evolution in the gut microbiota in a cohort of Nigerian infants within the first year of life. Faecal samples were obtained monthly from 28 infants from birth for one year. The infants had been born by a mix of natural birth and caesarean section and were either breast-fed or mixed fed. Sequencing of the V1-V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene was used to characterise the microbiota. Short chain fatty acids and lactate present in each faecal sample were identified by gas chromatography. Microbial differences were observed between the vaginal and caesarean section delivered infants in samples collected within 7 days of life, although these differences were not observed in later samples. Exclusively breastfed infants had predominance of Ruminococcus gnavus , Collinsella , and Sutterella species. Different Bifidobacterium species dominated breast-fed compared to mixed fed infants. Clostridium , Enterococcus , Roseburia , and Coprococcus species were observed once the infants commenced weaning. Butyrate was first detected when weaning started between months 4–6 in the majority of the infants while total short chain fatty acid concentrations increased, and acetate and lactate remained high following the introduction of solid foods. The observed taxonomic differences in the gut microbiota between Nigerian infants, as well as butyrate production during weaning, were strongly influenced by diet, and not by birthing method. Introduction of local/solid foods encouraged the colonisation and evolution of specific marker organisms associated with carbohydrate metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W4220917007,"Background The microbiome is an important and increasingly-studied mediator of organismal metabolism, although how the microbiome affects metabolism remains incompletely understood. Many investigators use antibiotics to experimentally perturb the microbiome. However, antibiotics have poorly understood yet profound off-target effects on behavior and diet, including food and water aversion, that can confound experiments and limit their applicability. We thus sought to determine the relative influence of microbiome modulation and off-target antibiotic effects on the behavior and metabolic activity of mice. Results Mice treated with oral antibiotics via drinking water exhibited significant weight loss in fat, liver, and muscle tissue. These mice also exhibited a reduction in water and food consumption, with marked variability across antibiotic regimens. While administration of bitter-tasting but antimicrobially-inert compounds caused a similar reduction in water consumption, this did not cause tissue weight loss or reduced food consumption. Mice administered intraperitoneal antibiotics (bypassing the gastrointestinal tract) exhibited reduced tissue weights and oral intake, comparable to the effects of oral antibiotics. Antibiotic-treated germ-free mice did not have reduced tissue weights, providing further evidence that direct microbiome modulation (rather than behavioral effects) mediates these metabolic changes. Conclusions While oral antibiotics cause profound effects on food and water consumption, antibiotic effects on organismal metabolism are primarily mediated by microbiome modulation. We demonstrate that tissue-specific weight loss following antibiotic administration is due primarily to microbiome effects rather than food and water aversion, and identify antibiotic regimens that effectively modulate gut microbiota while minimizing off-target behavioral effects."
https://openalex.org/W4220913751,"The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to examine disparities in hand washing and social distancing among 2,509 adults from the United States, Italy, Spain, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and India. Respondents were recruited via Qualtrics’ participant pool and completed an online survey in the most common language spoken in each country. In hierarchical linear regression models, living in a rural area (β = -0.08, p = .001), older age (β = 0.07, p &lt; .001), identifying as a woman (β = 0.07, p = .001), and greater educational attainment (β = 0.07, p = .017) were significantly associated with hand washing. Similar results were found regarding social distancing, in which living in a rural area (β = -0.10, p &lt; .001), country of residence (β = 0.11, p &lt; .001), older age (β = 0.17, p &lt; .001), identifying as a woman (β = 0.11, p &lt; .001), and greater educational attainment (β = 0.06, p = .019) were significant predictors. Results from the multivariable linear regression models demonstrate more nuanced findings with distinct and significant disparities across the five countries found with respect to hand washing and social distancing. Taken together, the results suggest multiple influencing factors that contribute to existing disparities regarding social distancing and hand washing among adults internationally. As such, more tailored public interventions are needed to promote preventive measures to mitigate existing COVID-related disparities."
https://openalex.org/W4221067284,"Fecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae is a potential risk for the transmission of infection with resistant strains. Understanding the burden of these resistant strains in asymptomatic people is essential to reduce the chain of infection transmission. However, data on the fecal carriage of Extended-spectrum Beta-lactamase and Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae among food handlers were limited in developing countries especially in Ethiopia. The aim of the present study is, therefore, to assess fecal carriage rate, associated factors, and antimicrobial resistance patterns of Extended-spectrum Beta-lactamase and Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae among food handlers at the University of Gondar Cafeterias, Northwest Ethiopia.An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February to June 2021 at the University of Gondar cafeterias. A total of 290 stool samples were collected, transported using Cary Blair transport medium, and processed. All isolates were cultured and identified by using MacConkey agar, and routine biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done to each isolate following the Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method. If the zone of inhibition was ≤ 22 mm for ceftazidime, ≤25 mm for ceftriaxone, and ≤27 for cefotaxime they were considered as potential ESBL strain and selected for a further phenotypic confirmatory. Moreover, the double-disc diffusion test and the modified carbapenem inactivation method were used for confirmations of Extended-spectrum β-lactamase and Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae respectively. If a ≥5mm difference in zone diameter for either antimicrobial agent in combination with clavulanic acid versus the zone diameter of the agent when tested alone (without B-lactamase inhibitor), was confirmed as ESBL-PE and if the zone of inhibition diameter between 6-15mm and 16- 18mm with a pinpoint colony, it was considered as carbapenem resistance Enterobacteriaceae. Data were entered using Epi-data version 4.6 and then exported to SPSS version 26 for analysis. Potential risk factors were assessed using multivariable logistic regression and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Out of 290 stool samples, 63 (21.7%) and 7 (2.4%) were confirmed as Extended-spectrum β-lactamase and Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The most predominant ESBL-PE was E. coli 43 (14.8%) followed by K. pneumoniae 17 (5.9%). Most of the Extended-spectrum β-lactamase and Carbapenemase-producing isolates were resistant to tetracycline, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone (100% each). In contrast, a low resistance level was recorded for Meropenem and cefoxitin. The overall Multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MDR) was 147 (42.3%). Antibiotics usage in the last 3 months and drinking unpasteurized milk were associated with the carriage of the Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae.The high fecal carriage rate of Multi-drug resistance isolate, Extended-spectrum β-lactamase, and Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae were recorded among food handlers. Therefore, this study gives signals in the spread of drug-resistant bacteria easily to the community. Hence, the need for adjusting and promotion of infection prevention measures to prevent the spread of drug-resistant bacteria should not be underestimated."
https://openalex.org/W4220708749,"Gonadectomy is a major risk factor for feline obesity. The lipotropic effects of choline have demonstrated benefits for growth and carcass composition in livestock. The consumption of supplemental choline on body weight (BW), body composition, lipid metabolism, energy expenditure (EE), and serum satiety hormones were evaluated in 15 gonadectomized male kittens. Kittens were offered a base diet formulated for growth (3310mg choline/kg dry matter [DM]) to daily energy requirements (DER) over an 11-week acclimation. Post-gonadectomy, kittens were assigned to a base diet (CONTROL, n = 7) or choline group (base diet with additional choline at 300mg/kg BW 0.75 as a top dress) (CHOLINE, n = 8). For 12-weeks post-neuter, kittens were offered three times their DER over three meals to mimic ad libitum feeding. At week -1 and 12, body composition was assessed using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), 24-hour indirect calorimetry was performed for EE and respiratory quotients (RQ), and fasted serum samples were analyzed for lipid compounds and satiety hormones. Daily food intake (FI) and weekly BW were measured. Data was analyzed as a repeated measures of variance (ANCOVA) using the GLIMMIX procedure with time and group as fixed effects. CHOLINE had lower mean daily FI and lower rates of BW accretion (P&lt;0.05) in contrast to CONTROL. All absolute body composition data increased over time for both groups, with lower increases in total tissue mass (P = 0.031) and fat mass (P = 0.005) in CHOLINE. Serum satiety hormones and lipid compounds did not differ (P&gt;0.05) between groups, but both groups experienced a decrease in low-density lipoproteins and increase in high-density lipoproteins (P&lt;0.05). Primary substrate utilization showed lipid use when fasted and use of protein or mixed macronutrients in the fed state. Fed state EE decreased post-gonadectomy (P = 0.004), however, CHOLINE did not affect total EE or RQ. These results suggest that supplemental dietary choline reduces FI, BW, and fat mass and may help to reduce the propensity of weight gain and subsequent obesity in gonadectomized feline populations."
https://openalex.org/W4220810742,"The bacterium Serratia marcescens can cause opportunistic infections in humans and in animals. In veterinary settings, the diversity, reservoirs and modes of transmission of this pathogen are poorly understood. The phenotypes and genotypes of Serratia spp. isolated from dogs, cats, horses, a bird and a rabbit examined at an Australian veterinary hospital between 2008 and 2019 were characterised. The isolates were identified as S . marcescens (n = 15) or S . ureilytica (n = 3) and were placed into four distinct phylogenetic groups. Nine quasi-clonal isolates associated with post-surgical complications in different patients displayed high levels of resistance to the antimicrobials fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and to the disinfectant chlorhexidine. A Serratia sp. with a similar resistance profile was also isolated from chlorhexidine solutions used across the Hospital, suggesting that these infections had a nosocomial origin. A genomic island encoding a homolog of the Pseudomonas MexCD-OprJ biocide efflux system was detected in the chlorhexidine-tolerant Serratia . The nine multi-drug resistant Serratia isolates also possessed a Ser-83-Ile mutation in GyrA conferring fluoroquinolone resistance, and carried a large IncHI2 conjugative plasmid encoding antimicrobial and heavy metal resistances. This replicon was highly similar to a plasmid previously detected in a strain of Enterobacter hormaechei recovered from the Hospital environment. IncHI2 plasmids are commonly found in Enterobacteriaceae , but are rarely present in Serratia spp., suggesting that this plasmid was acquired from another organism. A chlorhexidine-tolerant Serratia isolate which lacked the IncHI2 plasmid was used in mating experiments to demonstrate the transfer of multi-drug resistance from a E . hormaechei donor. This study illustrates the importance of environmental surveillance of biocide-resistance in veterinary hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W4220850316,"In 1894 foundational work showed that training one limb for “muscular power” (i.e. strength) or “muscular control” (i.e. skill) improves performance in both limbs. Despite that the original data were exclusively from two female participants (“Miss Smith” and “Miss Brown”), in the decades that followed, such “cross-education” training interventions have focused predominantly on improving strength in men. Here, in a female cohort, we revisit that early research to underscore that training a task that requires precise movements in a timely fashion (i.e. “muscular control”) on one side of the body is transferred to the contralateral untrained limb. With unilateral practice, women reduced time to completion and the number of errors committed during the commercially available game of Operation ® Iron Man 2 with both limbs. Modest reductions in bilateral Hoffmann (H-) reflex excitability evoked in the wrist flexors suggest that alterations in the spinal cord circuitry may be related to improvements in performance of a fine motor task. These findings provide a long overdue follow-up to the efforts of Miss Theodate L. Smith from more than 125 years ago, highlight the need to focus on female participants, and advocate more study of cross-education of skilled tasks."
https://openalex.org/W4220908413,"A better understanding of visual performance with Multifocal Contact Lenses (MCLs) is essential, both in young eyes, where MCLs may be prescribed to control the progression of myopia wherein the MCLs optics interact with accommodation, and in presbyopes, where MCLs are increasingly used to compensate the lack of accommodation. In this study, we evaluated the through focus visual acuity (TFVA) with center-near MCLs of three additions (low, medium and high) and without an addition (NoLens) in 10 young adults and 5 presbyopes. We studied the effect of accommodation, age and pupil diameter (in cyclopleged subjects) on visual performance. The MCLs produced a small but consistent degradation at far (by 0.925 logMAR, averaged across eyes and conditions) and a consistent benefit at near in young subjects with paralyzed accommodation (by 1.025 logMAR), and in presbyopes with both paralyzed and natural accommodation (by 1.071 logMAR, on average). TFVA in young adults with NoLens and all MCLs showed statistically significant differences (Wilcoxan, p<0.01) between natural and paralyzed accommodation, but not in presbyopes with MCLs. In young adults, VA improved with increasing pupil diameter with the HighAdd MCL (0.08 logMAR shift from 3 to 5-mm pupil size). Visual imbalance (standard deviation of VA across distances) was reduced with MCLs, and decreased significantly with increasing near add. The lowest imbalance occurred in young adults under natural accommodation and was further reduced by 13.33% with MCLs with respect to the NoLens condition. Overall, the visual performance with MCLs in young adults exceeds that in presbyopes at all distances, and was better than 0.00 logMAR over the dioptric range tested. In conclusion, the center-near lenses do not degrade the near high contrast visual acuity significantly but maintains the far vision in young adults, and produce some visual benefit at near in presbyopes."
https://openalex.org/W4221028153,"This study aimed to develop the Motivation in stroke patients for rehabilitation scale (MORE scale), following the Consensus-based standards for the selection of health measurement instruments (COSMIN).Study participants included rehabilitation professionals working at the convalescent rehabilitation hospital and stroke patients admitted to the hospital. The original MORE scale was developed from an item pool, which was created through discussions of nine rehabilitation professionals. After the content validity of the scale was verified using the Delphi method with 61 rehabilitation professionals and 22 stroke patients, the scale's validity and reliability were examined for 201 stroke patients. The construct validity of the scale was investigated using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and item response theory analysis. Cronbach's alpha confirmed its internal consistency. Regarding convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity, Spearman's rho was calculated between the MORE scale and the Apathy Scale (AS), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), which rates the subjective feelings of motivation.Using the Delphi method, 17 items were incorporated into the MORE scale. According to EFA and CFA, a one-factor model was suggested. All MORE scale items demonstrated satisfactory item response, with item slopes ranging from 0.811 to 2.142, and item difficulty parameters ranging from -3.203 to 0.522. Cronbach's alpha was 0.948. Regarding test-retest reliability, a moderate correlation was found between scores at the beginning and one month after hospitalization (rho = 0.612. p < 0.001). The MORE scale showed significant correlation with AS (rho = -0.536, p < 0.001), SDS (rho = -0.347, p < 0.001), and VAS (rho = 0.536, p < 0.001), confirming the convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity, respectively.The MORE scale was verified as a valid and reliable scale for evaluating stroke patients' motivation for rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W4221054298,"Tree improvement programs often focus on improving productivity-related traits; however, under present climate change scenarios, climate change-related (adaptive) traits should also be incorporated into such programs. Therefore, quantifying the genetic variation and correlations among productivity and adaptability traits, and the importance of genotype by environment interactions, including defense compounds involved in biotic and abiotic resistance, is essential for selecting parents for the production of resilient and sustainable forests. Here, we estimated quantitative genetic parameters for 15 growth, wood quality, drought resilience, and monoterpene traits for Picea glauca (Moench) Voss (white spruce). We sampled 1,540 trees from three open-pollinated progeny trials, genotyped with 467,224 SNP markers using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). We used the pedigree and SNP information to calculate, respectively, the average numerator and genomic relationship matrices, and univariate and multivariate individual-tree models to obtain estimates of (co)variance components. With few site-specific exceptions, all traits examined were under genetic control. Overall, higher heritability estimates were derived from the genomic- than their counterpart pedigree-based relationship matrix. Selection for height, generally, improved diameter and water use efficiency, but decreased wood density, microfibril angle, and drought resistance. Genome-based correlations between traits reaffirmed the pedigree-based correlations for most trait pairs. High and positive genetic correlations between sites were observed (average 0.68), except for those pairs involving the highest elevation, warmer, and moister site, specifically for growth and microfibril angle. These results illustrate the advantage of using genomic information jointly with productivity and adaptability traits, and defense compounds to enhance tree breeding selection for changing climate."
https://openalex.org/W4220705619,"Both hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are produced endogenously from the mammalian metabolic pathway of sulfur-containing amino acids and play important roles in several vascular diseases. However, their interaction during the control of vascular function has not been fully clear. Here, we investigated the potential role of H2S in SO2 production and vascular regulation in vivo and in vitro. Wistar rats were divided into the vehicle, SO2, DL-propargylglycine (PPG) + SO2, β-cyano-L-alanine (BCA) + SO2 and sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) + SO2 groups. SO2 donor was administered with or without pre-administration of PPG, BCA or NaHS for 30 min after blood pressure was stabilized for 1 h, and then, the change in blood pressure was detected by catheterization via the common carotid artery. Rat plasma SO2 and H2S concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography and sensitive sulfur electrode, respectively. The isolated aortic rings were prepared for the measurement of changes in vasorelaxation stimulated by SO2 after PPG, BCA or NaHS pre-incubation. Results showed that the intravenous injection of SO2 donors caused transient hypotension in rats compared with vehicle group. After PPG or BCA pretreatment, the plasma H2S content decreased but the SO2 content increased markedly, and the hypotensive effect of SO2 was significantly enhanced. Conversely, NaHS pretreatment upregulated the plasma H2S content but reduced SO2 content, and attenuated the hypotensive effect of SO2. After PPG or BCA pre-incubation, the vasorelaxation response to SO2 was enhanced significantly. While NaHS pre-administration weakened the SO2-induced relaxation in aortic rings. In conclusion, our in vivo and in vitro data indicate that H2S negatively controls the plasma content of SO2 and the vasorelaxant effect under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4220777306,"Background Healthcare systems face difficulty implementing evidence-based practices, particularly multicomponent interventions. Additional challenges occur in settings serving vulnerable populations such as homeless Veterans, given the population’s acuity, multiple service needs, and organizational barriers. Implementation Facilitation (IF) is a strategy to support the uptake of evidence-based practices. This study’s aim was to simultaneously examine IF on the uptake of Maintaining Independence and Sobriety Through Systems Integration, Outreach and Networking-Veterans Edition (MISSION-Vet), an evidence-based multicomponent treatment engagement intervention for homeless Veterans with co-occurring mental health and substance abuse, and clinical outcomes among Veterans receiving MISSION-Vet. Methods This multi-site hybrid III modified stepped-wedge trial involved seven programs at two Veterans Affairs Medical Centers comparing Implementation as Usual (IU; training and educational materials) to IF (IU + internal and external facilitation). Results A total of 110 facilitation events averaging 27 minutes were conducted, of which 85% were virtual. Staff (case managers and peer specialists; n = 108) were trained in MISSION-Vet and completed organizational readiness assessments (n = 77). Although both sites reported being willing to innovate and a desire to improve outcomes, implementation climate significantly differed. Following IU, no staff at either site conducted MISSION-Vet. Following IF, there was a significant MISSION-Vet implementation difference between sites (53% vs. 14%, p = .002). Among the 93 Veterans that received any MISSION-Vet services, they received an average of six sessions. Significant positive associations were found between number of MISSION-Vet sessions and outpatient treatment engagement measured by the number of outpatient visits attended. Conclusions While staff were interested in improving patient outcomes, MISSION-Vet was not implemented with IU. IF supported MISSION-Vet uptake and increased outpatient service utilization, but MISSION-Vet still proved difficult to implement particularly in the larger healthcare system. Future studies might tailor implementation strategies to organizational readiness. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02942979 ."
https://openalex.org/W4220777476,"We performed a longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 seroepidemiological study in healthcare personnel of the two largest tertiary COVID-19 referral hospitals in Mexico City.All healthcare personnel, including staff physicians, physicians in training, nurses, laboratory technicians, researchers, students, housekeeping, maintenance, security, and administrative staff were invited to voluntarily participate, after written informed consent. Participants answered a computer-assisted self-administered interview and donated blood samples for antibody testing every three weeks from October 2020 to June 2021.A total of 883 participants (out of 3639 registered employees) contributed with at least one blood sample. The median age was 36 years (interquartile range: 28-46) and 70% were women. The most common occupations were nurse (28%), physician (24%), and administrative staff (22%). Two hundred and ninety participants (32.8%) had a positive-test result in any of the visits, yielding an overall adjusted prevalence of 33.5% for the whole study-period. Two hundred and thirty-five positive tests were identified at the baseline visit (prevalent cases), the remaining 55 positive tests were incident cases. Prevalent cases showed associations with both occupational (institution 2 vs. 1: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.54-3.25; laboratory technician vs. physician: aOR = 4.38, 95% CI: 1.75-10.93) and community (municipality of residence Xochimilco vs. Tlalpan: aOR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.09-3.79) risk-factors. The incidence rate was 3.0 cases per 100 person-months. Incident cases were associated with community-acquired risk, due to contact with suspect/confirmed COVID-19 cases (HR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.21-5.00).We observed that between October 2020 and June 2021, healthcare workers of the two largest tertiary COVID-19 referral centers in Mexico City had similar level of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. Most variables associated with exposure in this setting pointed toward community rather than occupational risk. Our observations are consistent with successful occupational medicine programs for SARS-CoV-2 infection control in the participating institutions but suggest the need to strengthen mitigation strategies in the community."

Hence, it is vital to promote MWHs for pregnant women in Ethiopia, where most people reside in rural settings and have a high mortality rate. Therefore, this study aimed to assess MWHs utilization and associated factors among women who gave birth in the rural settings of Finfinnee special zone, central Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 15th October to 20th November 2019 among women who gave birth in the last six months before data collection. Multistage random sampling was employed among 636 women from six rural kebeles to collect data through a face-to-face interview. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was fitted, and a 95% confidence level with a p-value <0.05 was used to determine the level and significance of the association.Overall, MWHs utilization was 34.0% (30.3% - 37.7%). The higher age (AOR: 4.77; 95% CI: 2.76-8.24), career women (AOR: 0.39 95% CI: 0.20-0.74), non-farmer husband (AOR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.14-0.55), rich women (AOR:1.84; 95% CI: 1.12-3.02), living greater than 60 minutes far from a health facility (AOR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.16-2.80), and four and more livebirths (AOR: 5.72; 95% CI: 1.53-21.35) significantly associated with MWHs utilization. The common services provided were latrine, bedding, and health professional checkups with 98.2%, 96.8%, and 75.4%, respectively. Besides, feeding service was provided by 39.8%. The primary reason not to use MWHs was the absence of enough information on MWHs.One-third of the women who delivered within the last six months utilized MWHs in the Finfinnee special zone. Our results support the primary purpose of MWHs, that women far from the health facility are more likely to utilize MWHs, but lack of adequate information is the reason not to use MWHs. Therefore, it is better to promote MWHs to fill the information gap among women with geographical barriers to reach health facilities."

In-group advantage makes it easy for the people of the same cultural group to perceive each other's emotions accurately. The goal of this research is to re-investigate human behavior regarding expression and perception of emotions in speech. The theoretical basis of this research is grounded on the dialect theory of emotions. For the purpose of this study, six datasets of audio speeches have been considered. The participants of these datasets belong to six different cultural areas. A fully automated, machine learning-based framework i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to carry out this study. The overall emotion perception for all six cultural groups supports in-group advantage, whereas emotion wise analysis partially supports the In-group advantage."
https://openalex.org/W4220822233,"Serological databases represent an important source of information to perceive COVID-19 impact on health professionals involved in combating the disease. This paper describes SerumCovid , a COVID-19 serological database focused on the diagnosis of health professionals, providing a preliminary analysis to contribute to the understanding of the antibody response to the SARS-CoV-2. The study population comprises 321 samples from 236 healthcare and frontline workers fighting COVID-19 in Vitória de Santo Antão, Brazil. Samples were collected from at least six days of symptoms to more than 100 days. The used immunoenzymatic assays were Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG and IgA. The most common gender in SerumCovid is female, while the most common age group is between 30 and 39 years old. However, no statistical differences were observed in either genders or age categories. The most reported symptoms were fatigue, headaches, and myalgia. Still, some subjects presented positive results for IgA after 130 days. Based on a temporal analysis, we have not identified general patterns as subjects presented high and low values of IgA and IgG with different evolution trends. Unexpectedly, for subjects with both serological tests, the outcome of IgA and IgG tests were the same (either positive or negative) for more than 80% of the samples. Therefore, SerumCovid helps better understand how COVID-19 affected healthcare and frontline workers, which increases knowledge about the infection and enables direct prevention actions."
https://openalex.org/W4220875630,"As an important part of a double-layer shaft lining in China, a polyethylene sandwich can reduce or even eliminate the constraint effect on the inner shaft lining, which is confined by the outer shaft lining, thus improving the integrity of the inner shaft lining concrete. To reveal the interface shear mechanism of the concrete-high density polyethylene (HDPE) material, a series of 16 direct shear tests were performed under high normal loads (0.6~4 MPa) with four different surface morphologies. The experimental results showed that the interfaces exhibit a clear strain-softening property during shear, and the shear strength increases linearly with increasing normal stress. Three shearing mechanisms, plowing, localized plastic deformation, and dilatancy, were observed in these experiments. The research results are of great theoretical and practical value for understanding the shear mechanism and predicting the shear strength of a shaft lining concrete-HDPE interface under high normal stress."
https://openalex.org/W4220919338,"Accessibility of multispectral, multitemporal imagery combined with recent advances in cloud computing and machine learning approaches have enhanced our ability to model habitat characteristics across broad spatial and temporal scales. We integrated a large dataset of known nest and roost sites of a threatened species, the Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida), in the southwestern USA with Landsat imagery processed using the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) time series algorithm on Google Earth Engine. We then used maximum entropy modeling (Maxent) to classify the landscape into four 'spectral similarity' classes that reflected the degree to which 30-m pixels contained a multispectral signature similar to that found at known owl nest/roost sites and mapped spectral similarity classes from 1986-2020. For map interpretation, we used nationally consistent forest inventory data to evaluate the structural and compositional characteristics of each spectral similarity class. We found a monotonic increase of structural characteristics typically associated with owl nesting and roosting over classes of increasing similarity, with the 'very similar' class meeting or exceeding published minimum desired management conditions for owl nesting and roosting. We also found an increased rate of loss of forest vegetation typical of owl nesting and roosting since the beginning of the 21st century that can be partly attributed to increased frequency and extent of large (≥400 ha) wildfires. This loss resulted in a 38% reduction over the 35-year study period in forest vegetation most similar to that used for owl nesting and roosting. Our modelling approach using cloud computing with time series of Landsat imagery provided a cost-effective tool for landscape-scale, multidecadal monitoring of vegetative components of a threatened species' habitat. Our approach could be used to monitor trends in the vegetation favored by any other species, provided that high-quality location data such as we presented here are available."
https://openalex.org/W4220928244,"Background Early diagnosis and treatment of childhood fever are essential for controlling disease progression and death. However, the Treatment-seeking behaviour of caregivers is still a significant challenge in rural parts of the African region. This study aimed to assess individual and community-level factors associated with treatment-seeking behaviours among caregivers of febrile under-five age children in Ethiopia. Method The recent Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey data (EDHS 2016) was used for the study. The survey collected information among 1,354 under-five children who had a fever within two weeks before the survey. The data were extracted, cleaned, and recoded using STATA version 14. Multilevel logistic regressions were used to determine the magnitude and associated factors of treatment-seeking behaviour among caregivers with febrile children in Ethiopia. Four models were built to estimate both fixed and random effects of individual and community-level factors between cluster variations on treatment-seeking behaviour. The Adjusted Odds Ratios with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) of the best-fitted model were reported at p&lt;0.05. Result This study revealed that 491 (36.26%) caregivers seek treatment for their febrile children. Living in metropolitan and small peripheral regions, delivery at health institutions, being poorer, middle and richer wealth quintiles, having a child with diarrhoea, cough, short rapid breathing, and wasting were positively associated with treatment-seeking behaviour of caregivers. Conclusion The caregivers had poor treatment-seeking behaviour for their febrile children in Ethiopia. Health education programmers should emphasise the importance of seeking early treatment, taking action on childhood febrile illness signs."

Herein, clinical effect of PPTA in patients with medial patellar plica (MPP) syndrome, chondromalacia patella, and infrapatellar fat pad (IPFP) syndrome, the most common causes of anterior knee pain, was evaluated. In this retrospective study, 156 patients with anterior knee pain who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and arthroscopic surgery that confirmed isolated MPP syndrome, chondromalacia patella, or IPFP syndrome from June 2011 to January 2021 were included in the study group and 118 patients without knee pathology on MRI during the same period were included in the control group. The PPTA was measured on knee MRI and compared between the two groups. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the value of PPTA for predicting the risk of patellofemoral joint disorder. The mean PPTA was significantly smaller in study group (138.1 ± 4.2°) than control group (142.1 ± 4.3°) (p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in PPTA among the patients with MPP syndrome, chondromalacia patella, and IPFP syndrome. Furthermore, the ROC analysis revealed that the area under curve, sensitivity, and specificity for predicting the risk of patellofemoral joint disorders were 0.696, 70.3% and 57.6%, respectively, at a PPTA cutoff of 138.3°. Therefore, the smaller PPTA may be associated with MPP syndrome, chondromalacia patella, and IPFP syndrome. Furthermore, PPTA could be a predictive factor for the risk of patellofemoral joint disease in patients with anterior knee pain."
https://openalex.org/W4220992256,"Regeneration is a widely observed phenomenon by which the integrity of an organism is recovered after damage. To date, studies on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of regeneration have been limited to a handful of model multicellular organisms. Here, the regeneration ability of marine macroalgae (Rhodophyta, Phaeophyceae, Chlorophyta) was systematically surveyed after thallus severing. Live cell imaging on severed thalli uncovered the cellular response to the damage. Three types of responses-budding, rhizoid formation, and/or sporulation-were observed in 25 species among 66 examined, proving the high potential of regeneration of macroalgae. The cellular and nuclear dynamics were monitored during cell repair or rhizoid formation of four phylogenetically diverged species, and the tip growth of the cells near the damaged site was observed as a common response. Nuclear translocation followed tip growth, enabling overall distribution of multinuclei or central positioning of the mononucleus. In contrast, the control of cell cycle events, such as nuclear division and septation, varied in these species. These observations showed that marine macroalgae utilise a variety of regeneration pathways, with some common features. This study also provides a novel methodology of live cell imaging in macroalgae."
https://openalex.org/W4221038624,"To conserve coastal foundation species, it is essential to understand patterns of distribution and abundance and how they change over time. We synthesized oyster distribution data across the west coast of North America to develop conservation strategies for the native Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida), and to characterize populations of the non-native Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas). We designed a user-friendly portal for data entry into ArcGIS Online and collected oyster records from unpublished data submitted by oyster experts and from the published literature. We used the resulting 2,000+ records to examine spatial and temporal patterns and made an interactive web-based map publicly available. Comparing records from pre-2000 vs. post-2000, we found that O. lurida significantly decreased in abundance and distribution, while M. gigas increased significantly. Currently the distribution and abundance of the two species are fairly similar, despite one species being endemic to this region since the Pleistocene, and the other a new introduction. We mapped the networks of sites occupied by oysters based on estimates of larval dispersal distance, and found that these networks were larger in Canada, Washington, and southern California than in other regions. We recommend restoration to enhance O. lurida, particularly within small networks, and to increase abundance where it declined. We also recommend restoring natural biogenic beds on mudflats and sandflats especially in the southern range, where native oysters are currently found most often on riprap and other anthropogenic structures. This project can serve as a model for collaborative mapping projects that inform conservation strategies for imperiled species or habitats."

As a result, lightweight rowers commonly restrict calorie intake despite high energy expenditure. This can result in Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S). The aim of this study is to investigate the physical and psychosocial impact of RED-S, from the perspective of lightweight rowers.Semi-structured individual qualitative interviews.Adults living in the United Kingdom who are current or former lightweight rowing participants and experienced ≥1 symptom of RED-S.Audio-recorded semi-structured individual telephone interviews were performed. Data was analysed using an inductive thematic approach, coding was iterative and data-driven, facilitated by NVivo software.Twelve current or former lightweight rowers (intermediate to international standard, 67% female, aged 19-32 years) participated. Participants restricted calories and increased energy expenditure to elicit weight-loss in order to meet weight requirements. This resulted in psychosocial implications (reduced social interaction, difficulty maintaining relationships, poor emotional regulation, low mood, poor concentration, disordered eating, guilt and anxiety around food, and a negative body image). Some psychosocial implications persisted after retirement from lightweight rowing. Participants described a range of physical implications, including disrupted sleep, decreased performance and recovery, bowel disruption, menstrual dysfunction, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, injury and weakened immune systems.This study describes short and long-term physical and psychosocial impacts of RED-S from the perspective of lightweight rowers. Findings highlight the importance of effective RED-S prevention and management strategies for lightweight rowers. These findings may be used to educate health-care professionals, coaches and athletes on the personal impacts and serious health consequences of RED-S."
https://openalex.org/W4221132047,"Hypselodont (ever-growing) teeth of lagomorphs or rodents have higher wear rates (of a magnitude of mm/week), with compensating growth rates, compared to the non-ever-growing teeth of ungulates (with a magnitude of mm/year). Whether this is due to a fundamental difference in enamel hardness has not been investigated so far. We prepared enamel samples (n = 120 per species) from incisors of cattle (Bos primigenius taurus) and nutria (Myocastor coypus, hypselodont incisors) taken at slaughterhouses, and submitted them to indentation hardness testing. Subsequently, samples were split into 4 groups per species (n = 24 per species and group) that were assessed for abrasion susceptibility by a standardized brush test with a control (no added abrasives) and three treatment groups (using fine silt at 4 ±1 μm particle size, volcanic ash at 96 ±9 μm, or fine sand at 166 ±15 μm as abrasives), in which enamel abrasion was quantified as height loss by before-and-after profilometry. The difference in enamel hardness between the species was highly significant, with nutria enamel achieving 78% of the hardness of cattle enamel. In the control and the fine sand group, no enamel height loss was evident, which was attributed to the in vitro system in the latter group, where the sand particles were brushed out of the test slurry by the brushes' bristles. For fine silt and volcanic ash, nutria enamel significantly lost 3.65 and 3.52 times more height than cattle. These results suggest a relationship between enamel hardness and susceptibility to abrasion. However, neither the pattern within the species nor across the species indicated a monotonous relationship between hardness and height loss; rather, the difference was due to qualitative step related to species. Hence, additional factors not measured in this study must be responsible for the differences in the enamel's susceptibility to abrasion. While the in vitro brush system cannot be used to rank abrasive test substances in terms of their abrasiveness, it can differentiate abrasion susceptibility in dental tissue of different animal species. The results caution against considering enamel wear as a similar process across mammals."

We aimed to understand barriers to seeking care among adult Africans by evaluating the public perception, knowledge of availability, and readiness to use neurosurgical care services. Methods An e-survey was distributed among African adults who are not in the health sector or pursuing a health-related degree. Chi-square test and ANOVA were used for bivariate analysis and the alpha value was set at 0.05. Odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results Six hundred and sixty-two adults from 16 African countries aged 25.4 (95% CI: 25.0, 25.9) responded. The majority lived in urban settings (90.6%) and were English-speaking (76.4%) men (54.8%). Most respondents (76.3%) could define neurosurgery adequately. The most popular neurosurgical diseases were traumatic brain injury (76.3%), congenital brain and spine diseases (67.7%), and stroke (60.4%). Unwillingness to use or recommend in-country neurosurgical services was associated with rural dwelling (β = -0.69, SE = 0.31, P = 0.03), lack of awareness about the availability of neurosurgeons in-country (β = 1.02, SE = 0.20, P&lt;0.001), and believing neurosurgery is expensive (β = -1.49, SE = 0.36, P&lt;0.001).

https://openalex.org/W4220721349,"The evaluation of applied psychological interventions in the workplace or elsewhere is challenging. Randomisation and matching are difficult to achieve and this often results in substantial heterogeneity within intervention and control groups. As a result, traditional comparison of group means using null hypothesis significance testing may mask effects experienced by some participants. Using longitudinal studies of coaching interventions designed to provide support for dyslexic employees, this study describes and evaluates a different approach using a Meta-Impact score. We offer a conceptual rationale for our method, illustrate how this score is calculated and analysed, and show how it highlights person-specific variations in how participants react and respond to interventions. We argue that Meta-Impact is an incremental supplement to traditional variable-centric group-wise comparisons and can more accurately demonstrate in practice the extent to which an intervention worked. Such methods are needed for applied research, where personalized intervention protocols may require impact analysis for policy, legal and ethical purposes, despite modest sample sizes."

This systematic review protocol (OSF preregistration https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/GKUAW) was developed to answer two primary questions in relation to protected area and natural resource management: 1) How is distrust conceptualized, and 2) What methods are used to gather evidence of distrust? The aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of how distrust is theoretically developed and what questions are used to uncover distrust. Also, it will summarize findings on what leads to and results from distrust. Four academic and eight gray literature databases will be searched using Boolean keyword searches. Articles eligible for inclusion are those that present original research, gather and present evidence of distrust, and focus on protected areas and/or natural resource management. The review will result in a narrative synthesis that summarizes approaches to distrust within protected area and natural resource management."
https://openalex.org/W4220761736,"In this paper, the authors have designed and implemented the prototype for a near real-time wireless image sequence streaming cloud with two-layered restoration for a road traffic monitoring application of a small-scale network. Since the proposed design is targeted to implement outdoors where the link or node failure could occur, the fault-tolerant capability must be considered. Having only one layer restoration may not provide a good quality of service. Therefore, a two-layer restoration framework is designed in the proposed system by restoring the network layer with the underlying software-defined wireless mesh network capability and at the local broker selection over the Apache Kafka framework. The monitoring application performance has been investigated for the end-to-end average latency and image loss percentage by outdoor testing for 13 hours from 5:40 P.M. 17 th November 2020 to 6:40 A.M. 18 th November 2020. The end-to-end average latency and image loss percentage have been found to be within the acceptable condition i.e. less than 5 seconds on average with approximated 10% image losses. The proposed system has also been compared with the traditional ad-hoc network, running the OLSR-based network layer, in terms of the rerouting time, restoration time and end-to-end average latency. Based on the emulated wireless network in controllable laboratory environments, the proposed SDWMN-based system outperforms the conventional OLSR-based system with potentially faster rerouting/restoration time due to SDN central controllability and with only marginally increased end-to-end average latency after re-routing/restoration completion. Algorithm complexity analysis has also been given for both the systems. Both the experimental and complexity analysis results thus suggest the practical applicability of the proposed system. Given this promising result, it is therefore recommended as the future research in further developing from the prototype design into the actual deployment for daily traffic monitoring operations."

Physical therapy might be one of the valuable treatments for the recovery of knee joint mobility. This study aimed to evaluate the immediate effect of physical therapy on the dynamics of the infrapatellar fat pad in healthy participants using ultrasonography. In this prospective, single-blind, randomised controlled trial, 64 healthy young participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the following three interventions: manual therapy, hot pack treatment, and control. Ultrasound images of the infrapatellar fat pad were obtained before and after the intervention. The thickness change ratio of the infrapatellar fat pad was calculated to compare the changes between and within groups before and after the intervention. No significant inter-group differences were observed. The effect sizes were relatively small. Manual therapy or hot pack intervention might not have an immediate effect on infrapatellar fat pad flexibility in healthy participants. Thus, it is necessary to consider more intensive treatments to change the dynamics of the infrapatellar fat pad."

https://openalex.org/W4220869894,"Computational methods play a key role for investigating allosteric mechanisms in proteins, with the potential of generating valuable insights for innovative drug design. Here we present the SenseNet (“Structure ENSEmble NETworks”) framework for analysis of protein structure networks, which differs from established network models by focusing on interaction timelines obtained by molecular dynamics simulations. This approach is evaluated by predicting allosteric residues reported by NMR experiments in the PDZ2 domain of hPTP1e, a reference system for which previous computational predictions have shown considerable variance. We applied two models based on the mutual information between interaction timelines to estimate the conformational influence of each residue on its local environment. In terms of accuracy our prediction model is comparable to the top performing model published for this system, but by contrast benefits from its independence from NMR structures. Our results are complementary to experimental data and the consensus of previous predictions, demonstrating the potential of our new analysis tool SenseNet. Biochemical interpretation of our model suggests that allosteric residues in the PDZ2 domain form two distinct clusters of contiguous sidechain surfaces. SenseNet is provided as a plugin for the network analysis software Cytoscape, allowing for ease of future application and contributing to a system of compatible tools bridging the fields of system and structural biology."
https://openalex.org/W4220879795,"We theoretically demonstrated a class of plasmonic coupled elliptical nanostructure for achieving a spaser or a nanolaser with high intensity. The plasmonic ellipse is made up of gold film substrate. The proposed structure is then trialed for various light polarizations, moreover, a simple elliptical nanostructure has been chosen primarily from which different cases have been formed by geometry alteration. The structure supports strong coupled resonance mode i.e. localized surface plasmon (LSP). The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the investigated system is numerically examined using the finite-element method (FEM). The calculations showed that the LSPR peaks and the local field intensity or near field enhancement (NFE) of the active nanosystem can be amplified to higher values by introducing symmetry-breaking techniques in the proposed ellipse and its variants. The coupled nanostructure having different stages of wavelengths can be excited with different plasmonic resonance modes by the selection of suitable gain media. In addition, a small-sized nanolaser with high tunability range can be developed using this nanostructure. The spaser phenomena are achieved at several wavelengths by changing light polarization and structure alteration methods. Giant localized field enhancement and high LSPR values enable the proposed model to be highly appealing for sensing applications, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and much more."

MH-supported accommodation services aim to promote service users' autonomy and independence. Given the complexity associated with MH-supported accommodation services in England, a comparative evaluation of critical performance indicators, including service provision and quality of care, seems to be necessary in designing evidence-informed policies. This study aims to explore the influence of service quality indicators on the performance of MH-supported accommodation services in England. The analysed sample includes supported accommodation services from 14 nationally representative local authorities in England from the QuEST study grouped by three main types of care: residential care homes (divided into two subgroups: move-on and non-move-on oriented), supported housing and floating outreach. EDeS-MH (efficient decision support-mental health) was used to assess the performance indicators for the selected services by combining a Monte Carlo simulation engine, data envelopment analysis and a fuzzy inference engine for integrating expert knowledge. Depending on the type of care, six/seven quality domains were sequentially included after a baseline scenario (only technical) was analysed. Relative technical efficiency scores for the baseline scenarios revealed high performance in all the selected supported accommodation services, but the statistical variability was high. Quality domains significantly improved performance in every type of care. The inclusion of quality indicators has a positive impact on the global performance of each type of care. Remaining at the corresponding services more than expected for two years has a negative impact on performance. These findings can be considered from a planning perspective to facilitate the design of pathways of care with more realistic expectations about gaining autonomy in two years."

https://openalex.org/W4220998378,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) often requires long-term intensive chemotherapy for its cure. During chemotherapy, the patient always experiences neutropenia with readings below 500 cells/μL; this is often accompanied by pyrexia with a temperature of more than 101°F. This combination of neutropenia and fever is called febrile neutropenia (FN). A tool to sum up the daily severity of a patient's neutropenia, the ""D-index,"" has been validated in some specific clinical settings. In this study, we examined whether the D-index is a useful predictor of the onset of FN. We recruited consecutive patients treated with induction and consolidation chemotherapy for newly diagnosed AML. We gathered all the FN events and their clinical background data retrospectively. Patients' background, such as pre-existing conditions and disease status before the treatment, were analyzed using multivariate methods. All FN events during chemotherapy were evaluated for infection focus and causative organism. A total cohort of 51 cases (25 women, 26 men; median age 51 years, range 18-74) was analyzed. They displayed 171 neutropenic events (115 FN and 56 afebrile episodes) during chemotherapy, and complete neutropenic events were used in this study. Sensitivity and specificity analysis showed that the most useful cutoff value to predict the onset of FN was a cumulative D-index at day 11 (c-D11-index) of 718. The cumulative incidence of FN during chemotherapy was significantly higher in the group with c-D11-index ≥710 (80%) than in the group with c-D11-index <710 (39%) (P < 0.0001). Through multivariate analysis, the presence of diabetes mellitus and the c-D11-index were extracted as contributing factors to the onset of FN (P = 0.0087 and 0.0002, respectively). In conclusion, we can predict that AML patients receiving chemotherapy will experience the complication of FN when the c-D-index at day 11 is >710, with an odds ratio of 2.1."

Signed social graphs have attracted considerable attention to model trust relationships between people. Various representation learning methods such as network embedding and graph convolutional network (GCN) have been proposed to analyze signed graphs. However, existing network embedding models are not end-to-end for a specific task, and GCN-based models exhibit a performance degradation issue when their depth increases. In this paper, we propose Signed Diffusion Network (SidNet), a novel graph neural network that achieves end-to-end node representation learning for link sign prediction in signed social graphs. We propose a new random walk based feature aggregation, which is specially designed for signed graphs, so that SidNet effectively diffuses hidden node features and uses more information from neighboring nodes. Through extensive experiments, we show that SidNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of link sign prediction accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W4221030056,"Becoming aware of bias is essential for prejudice-regulation. However, attempts to make people aware of bias through feedback often elicits defensive reactions that undermine mitigation efforts. In the present article, we introduce state emotional ambivalence—the simultaneous experience of positive and negative emotions “in the present moment”–as a buffer against defensive responding to implicit bias feedback. Two studies (N = 507) demonstrate that implicit bias feedback (vs. no feedback) increases defensiveness (rating the test as less valid, credible, and objective). However, high (vs. low) state emotional ambivalence, which was independent of bias feedback, attenuates this relationship between bias feedback and defensiveness, accounting for a larger share of the variance than negative emotions alone. In turn, this reduced defensiveness among individuals high (vs. low) in emotional ambivalence was associated with increased awareness of bias in the self and others. Results suggest that state emotional ambivalence is associated with increased bias awareness by creating a mindset in which individuals are less defensive to potentially threatening information about their own implicit racial bias. These results have important implications for research on stereotyping and prejudice, emotional ambivalence and psychological conflict, and defensiveness."

In South Africa, various approaches of delivering PrEP have been adopted at different service delivery points (facility-based only, school-based only, community-based only and hybrid school-facility and community-facility models) to overcome challenges associated with individual, structural, and health systems related barriers that may hinder access to and uptake of PrEP among these populations. However, little is known about how to optimize PrEP implementation and operational strategies to achieve high sustained uptake of good quality services for AGYW and ABYM.

Enrolled participants will be followed up at 1-, 4- and 7-months to determine continuation and adherence to PrEP. We will conduct two focus group discussions (with 8 participants in each group) across four groups (i. Initiated PrEP within 1 month, ii. Did not initiate PrEP within 1 month, iii. Continued PrEP at 4/7 months and iv. Did not continue PrEP at 4/7 months) and 48 in-depth interviews from each of the four groups (12 per group). Twelve key informant interviews with stakeholders working in HIV programs will also be conducted. Associations between demographic characteristics stratified by PrEP initiation and by various service-delivery models will be assessed using Chi-square/Fishers exact tests or t-test/Mann Whitney test. A general inductive approach will be used to analyze the qualitative data. Ethics and dissemination The protocol was approved by the South African Medical Research Council Health Research Ethics Committee (EC051-11/2020). Findings from the study will be communicated to the study population and results will be presented to stakeholders and at appropriate local and international conferences. Outputs will also include a policy brief, peer-reviewed journal articles and research capacity building through research degrees."
https://openalex.org/W4221103907,"Introduction Ulcerative STIs, including syphilis, increase the risk for HIV acquisition and transmission due to the presence of ulcers/chancres that serve as a point-of-entry and exit for HIV. In Zimbabwe, diagnosis of syphilis often occurs in pregnant women who seek ANC services where syphilis testing is offered, and among men and women who seek health care for STIs. Zimbabwe’s national syphilis estimates are based on these diagnosed cases, with little information available about the prevalence of untreated syphilis among the general population. This analysis uses data from ZIMPHIA (2015–2016) to describe factors associated with active syphilis among men and women ages 15 years and older. Methods ZIMPHIA collected blood specimens for HIV and syphilis testing from 22,501 consenting individuals (ages 15 years and older). Household HIV testing used the national HIV rapid-testing algorithm with HIV-positive results confirmed at satellite laboratories using Geenius HIV-1/2 rapid test (Bio-rad, Hercules, California, USA). Point-of-care non-Treponemal and Treponemal syphilis testing was performed using Chembio’s Dual-Path Platform Syphilis Screen &amp; Confirm Assay. Factors associated with active syphilis were explored using multiple variable, weighted logistic regression and were stratified by gender. Results The likelihood of active syphilis in HIV-positive females was 3.7 times greater in HIV-positive females than HIV-negative females (aOR: 3.7, 95% CI 2.3–5.9). Among males odds of having active syphilis was 5 times higher among those that engaged in transactional sex than those who did not have sex or transactional sex (aOR: 5.3, 95% CI 1.9–14.7), and 6 times higher if HIV positive versus negative (aOR: 5.9, 95% CI 3.0–12.0). Urban residence, province, education (highest attended), marital status, number of sex partners, consistency of condom use, pregnancy status (females), and circumcision status (males) were not significant in the adjusted model for either females or males. Conculsion HIV status was found to be the only factor associated with active syphilis in both females and males. Given the persistent link between HIV and active syphilis, it is prudent to link individuals’ diagnoses and treatments, as recommended by the WHO. Enhanced integration of STI and HIV services in health delivery points such as ANC, reproductive services, or male circumcision clinics, combined with consistent, targeted outreach to high-risk populations and their partners, may assist the MOHCC to eliminate active syphilis in Zimbabwe."
https://openalex.org/W4221132549,"About half of the pregnancies among women living with HIV (WLWH) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan African countries are reported to be unintended. Unintended pregnancy is associated with late initiation of antenatal care (ANC), and may delay provision of viral load monitoring services, antenatal adherence counselling and support, and other services that promote sustained viral suppression throughout pregnancy. This study examines the association between unsuppressed viral load during the third trimester of pregnancy and unintended pregnancy among women who initiated ART before pregnancy.This was an analysis of data from a national antenatal survey conducted at 1 589 public health facilities in South Africa between 1 October and 15 November 2019. Consenting pregnant women aged 15-49 years attending ANC during the survey period were enrolled. Demographic and clinical data were collected through interview and medical record review. Pregnancy intention was assessed using two questions from the London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy, and responses were categorized as ""unintended,"" ""undecided,"" and ""intended."" Blood specimens were collected from all women and tested for HIV; and if positive, a viral load test was performed. A survey domain-based poisson regression model examined the association between unsuppressed viral load during the third trimester of pregnancy and unintended pregnancy among women who initiated ART before pregnancy. Viral suppression was defined as viral load <50 copies/mL.Of 10 901 WLWH with viral load data available, 63.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 62.4%-64.1%) were virally suppressed. Among the 2 681 women (representing 24.1% of all WLWH with viral load data) who initiated ART before pregnancy and were in their third trimester at the time of enrolment, 74.4% (95% CI: 73.0%-75.8%) were virally suppressed. In the same population, the proportion virally suppressed was lower among women whose current pregnancies were unintended (72.1%, 95% CI: 70.1%-74.1%) compared to women whose pregnancies were intended (78.3%, 95% CI: 75.9%-80.5%). In multivariable analyses adjusted for age, gravity, marital status, education, location of facility and syphilis status, unintended pregnancy was associated with unsuppressed viral load during the third trimester (adjusted relative risk: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.4) among women who initiated ART before pregnancy.The identified association between unsuppressed viral load and unintended pregnancy among pregnant women who initiated ART before pregnancy highlights the need to strengthen routine assessment of fertility preferences and provision of contraceptive services to reproductive age WLWH receiving ART."
https://openalex.org/W4220686599,"Objective To identify distinctly regulated gene markers and enriched gene sets in breast tissue of cynomolgus monkeys ( Macaca fascicularis ) treated for six months with either conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) or estradiol (E2) by analysis of corresponding mRNA levels of genes associated with breast development, carcinogenesis, apoptosis and immune regulation. Additionally, translation of three nuclear markers was analyzed. Methods RNA from breast biopsies and necropsies was isolated from two independent study trials from Ethun et al. (CEE) and Foth et al. (E2) after 6 month of treatment duration. RNA was subjected to qRT-PCR and MicroArray analysis. Immunohistochemical stainings were performed for the estrogen receptor alpha subunit (ERa), the progesterone receptor (PGR) and the proliferation marker Ki67. Results We identified a total of 36 distinctly enriched gene sets. Thirty-one were found in the CEE treatment group and five were found in the E2 treatment group, with no overlap. Furthermore, two individual genes IGFBP1 and SGK493 were upregulated in CEE treated animals. Additional targeted qRT-PCR analysis of ten specific estrogen-related genes showed upregulation of three genes ( TFF1 , PGR and GREB1 ) after CEE treatment, respectively one gene ( TFF1 ) after E2 treatment. Immunohistochemical stains of breast biopsies showed a significant increase in expression of the PGR marker after CEE treatment. Conclusions In this study we identified enriched gene sets possibly induced by CEE or E2 treatment in various processes associated with cancer biology and immunology. This preliminary translational data supports the concept that different estrogen types have different effects on healthy breast tissue and may help generate hypotheses for future research."
https://openalex.org/W4220722897,"The cetacean conservationist is often faced with evaluating population trends from abundance data that are either sparse or recorded at different times in different years. The presence of diel or seasonal patterns in the data together with unplanned gaps is often problematic. Such data are typical of those obtained from static acoustic monitoring. We present a simple and transparent non-parametric trend evaluation method, ‘Paired Year Ratio Assessment (PYRA)’ that uses only whole days of data wherever they are present in each of successive pairs of periods of 365 days. We provide a quantitative comparison of the performance of PYRA with traditional generalised additive models (GAMS) and nonparametric randomisation tests that require a greater level of skill and experience for both application and interpretation. We conclude that PYRA is a powerful tool, particularly in the context of identifying population trends which is often the main aim of conservation-targeted acoustic monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W4220864559,"In the field of object detection, domain adaptation is one of popular solution to align the distribution between the real scene (target domain) and the training scene (source domain) by adversarial training. However, only global features are applied to the Domain Adaptive Faster R-CNN (DA Faster R-CNN) method. The lack of local features reduces the performance of domain adaptation. Therefore, a novel method for domain adaptive detection called Skip-Layer Network with Optimization (SLNO) method is proposed in this paper. Three improvements are presented in SLNO. Firstly, different level convolutional features are fused by a multi-level features fusion component for domain classifier. Secondly, a multi-layer domain adaptation component is developed to align the image-level and the instance-level distributions simultaneously. Among this component, domain classifiers are used in both image-level and instance-level distributions through the skip layer. Thirdly, the cuckoo search (CS) optimization method is applied to search for the best coefficient of SLNO. As a result, the capability of domain alignment is strengthened. The Cityscapes, Foggy Cityscapes, SIM10K, KITTI data sets are applied to test our proposed novel approach. Consequently, excellent results are achieved by our proposed methods against state-of-the-art object detection methods. The results demonstrate our improvements are effective on domain adaptation detection."
https://openalex.org/W4220992639,"Organisms alter their phenotypes in response to changing environmental conditions. The developmental basis of this phenomenon, phenotypic plasticity, is a topic of broad interest in many fields of biology. While insects provide a suitable model for studying the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity, the physiological aspects of plasticity are not fully understood. Here, we report the physiological basis of polyphenism, an extreme form of phenotypic plasticity by utilizing a dung beetle species, Onthophagus taurus. We highlighted the metabolome between sexes as well as two distinct male morphs-large and small horns. Unlike results from previous transcriptomic studies, the comparative metabolomic study revealed that differences in metabolite level were more prominent between animals with different body sizes than different sexes. Our results also indicate that specific metabolites and biochemical pathways may be active during horn size determination."
https://openalex.org/W4221061542,"Surface nuclear magnetic resonance (SNMR) is a geophysical method that can be used directly for detecting groundwater resources, and it has attracted the attention of many scholars. In this paper, we propose a new effective algorithm for numerical modeling of 3D SNMR data for arbitrary topography in a conductive medium. We adopt a total-field algorithm for solving the quasi-static variant of Maxwell's equation and handle a complex-shaped loop source by discretizing the transmitter into electric dipoles, which can be further easily discretized into electric dipoles along the three directions of the Cartesian coordinate system. To solve the 3D SNMR forward-modeling problem quickly and accurately, a new element-integration system based on a new symmetric orthogonal rule is used for calculating the sensitivity (i.e., kernel) functions of all elements. The new rule is based on a special arrangement involving a cubic close-packed lattice structure and is characterized by fast convergence, positive weight, and symmetry. We apply the developed numerical algorithm to SNMR tomography of several typical hydrogeological models. The synthetic results show that higher precision can be achieved with few grids and nodes without increasing the computation time by using the new integration algorithm. In addition, we find that the topography and conductivity can affect the SNMR response, which needs to be considered while interpreting SNMR data."
