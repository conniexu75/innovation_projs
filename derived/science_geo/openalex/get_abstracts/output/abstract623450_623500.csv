https://openalex.org/W2902334028,"Through its important role in the formation of particulate matter, atmospheric ammonia affects air quality and has implications for human health and life expectancy1,2. Excess ammonia in the environment also contributes to the acidification and eutrophication of ecosystems3-5 and to climate change6. Anthropogenic emissions dominate natural ones and mostly originate from agricultural, domestic and industrial activities7. However, the total ammonia budget and the attribution of emissions to specific sources remain highly uncertain across different spatial scales7-9. Here we identify, categorize and quantify the world's ammonia emission hotspots using a high-resolution map of atmospheric ammonia obtained from almost a decade of daily IASI satellite observations. We report 248 hotspots with diameters smaller than 50 kilometres, which we associate with either a single point source or a cluster of agricultural and industrial point sources-with the exception of one hotspot, which can be traced back to a natural source. The state-of-the-art EDGAR emission inventory10 mostly agrees with satellite-derived emission fluxes within a factor of three for larger regions. However, it does not adequately represent the majority of point sources that we identified and underestimates the emissions of two-thirds of them by at least one order of magnitude. Industrial emitters in particular are often found to be displaced or missing. Our results suggest that it is necessary to completely revisit the emission inventories of anthropogenic ammonia sources and to account for the rapid evolution of such sources over time. This will lead to better health and environmental impact assessments of atmospheric ammonia and the implementation of suitable nitrogen management strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2902451951,"Direct lineage reprogramming involves the conversion of cellular identity. Single-cell technologies are useful for deconstructing the considerable heterogeneity that emerges during lineage conversion. However, lineage relationships are typically lost during cell processing, complicating trajectory reconstruction. Here we present ‘CellTagging’, a combinatorial cell-indexing methodology that enables parallel capture of clonal history and cell identity, in which sequential rounds of cell labelling enable the construction of multi-level lineage trees. CellTagging and longitudinal tracking of fibroblast to induced endoderm progenitor reprogramming reveals two distinct trajectories: one leading to successfully reprogrammed cells, and one leading to a ‘dead-end’ state, paths determined in the earliest stages of lineage conversion. We find that expression of a putative methyltransferase, Mettl7a1, is associated with the successful reprogramming trajectory; adding Mettl7a1 to the reprogramming cocktail increases the yield of induced endoderm progenitors. Together, these results demonstrate the utility of our lineage-tracing method for revealing the dynamics of direct reprogramming. Combinatorial tagging of single cells using expressed DNA barcodes, delivered by a lentiviral vector, is used to track individual cells and reconstruct their lineages and trajectories during cell fate reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W2902967495,"The backbone of ovarian cancer treatment is platinum-based chemotherapy and aggressive surgical debulking. New therapeutic approaches using immunotherapy via immune checkpoint blockade, which have demonstrated clinical efficacy in other tumor types, have been less promising in ovarian cancer. To increase their clinical efficacy, checkpoint inhibitors are now being tested in clinical trials in combination with chemotherapy. Here, we evaluated the impact of cisplatin on tumor immunogenicity and its in vivo roles when used alone or in combination with anti-PD-L1, in two novel murine ovarian cancer cell models. The 2F8 and its platinum-resistant derivative 2F8cis model, display distinct inflammatory profiles and chemotherapy sensitivities, and mirror the primary and recurrent human disease, respectively. Acute and chronic exposure to cisplatin enhances tumor immunogenicity by increasing calreticulin, MHC class I, antigen presentation and T-cell infiltration. Cisplatin also upregulates PD-L1 expression in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating a dual, paradoxical immune modulatory effect and supporting the rationale for combination with immune checkpoint blockade. One of the pathways activated by cisplatin treatment is the cGAS/STING pathway. Chronic cisplatin treatment led to upregulation of cGAS and STING proteins in 2F8cis compared to parental 2F8 cells, while acute exposure to cisplatin further increases cGAS and STING levels in both 2F8 and 2F8cis cells. Overexpression of cGAS/STING modifies tumor immunogenicity by upregulating PD-L1, MHC I and calreticulin in tumor cells. Anti-PD-L1 alone in a platinum-sensitive model or with cisplatin in a platinum-resistant model increases survival. These studies have high translational potential in ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2902511506,"Although the hippocampus is known to be important for declarative memory, it is less clear how hippocampal output regulates motivated behaviours, such as social aggression. Here we report that pyramidal neurons in the CA2 region of the hippocampus, which are important for social memory, promote social aggression in mice. This action depends on output from CA2 to the lateral septum, which is selectively enhanced immediately before an attack. Activation of the lateral septum by CA2 recruits a circuit that disinhibits a subnucleus of the ventromedial hypothalamus that is known to trigger attack. The social hormone arginine vasopressin enhances social aggression by acting on arginine vasopressin 1b receptors on CA2 presynaptic terminals in the lateral septum to facilitate excitatory synaptic transmission. In this manner, release of arginine vasopressin in the lateral septum, driven by an animal's internal state, may serve as a modulatory control that determines whether CA2 activity leads to declarative memory of a social encounter and/or promotes motivated social aggression."

https://openalex.org/W3098347754,"Observations of galaxies and primordial radiation suggest that the Universe is made mostly of non-luminous dark matter. Several types of new fundamental particles have been proposed as candidates for dark matter such as weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) but no definitive signal has been seen despite concerted efforts by many collaborations. One exception is the much-debated claim by the DAMA collaboration of a statistically significant annual modulation in the event rate of their experiment with a period and phase consistent with that expected from WIMP dark matter. Several groups have been working to develop experiments with the aim of reproducing DAMA's results using the same target medium. Here we report results from the initial operation of the COSINE-100 experiment. COSINE-100 uses sodium iodide as the target medium-the same medium as DAMA-and is designed to carry out a model-independent test of DAMA's claim. Initial data based on the first 59.5 days indicate that there is no excess of events over the expected background, confirming that DAMA's annual modulation signal is in severe tension with results from other experiments under the assumption of dark matter having spin independent interactions and the Standard Halo Model. COSINE-100 is now taking data to study the presence of dark matter-induced annual modulation in the event rate of the sodium iodide detectors."
https://openalex.org/W2902192147,"Obesity is a risk factor for breast cancer and also predicts poor clinical outcomes regardless of menopausal status. Contributing to the poor clinical outcomes is the suboptimal efficacy of standard therapies due to dose limiting toxicities and obesity-related complications, highlighting the need to develop novel therapeutic approaches for treating obese patients. We recently found that obesity leads to an increase in tumor-infiltrating macrophages with activated NLRC4 inflammasome and increased interleukin (IL)−1β production. IL-1β, in turn, leads to increased angiogenesis and cancer progression. Using Next Generation RNA sequencing, we identified an NLRC4/IL-1β-dependent upregulation of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), a known angiogenic factor in cancer, in tumors from obese mice. ANGPTL4-deficiency by genetic knockout or treatment with a neutralizing antibody led to a significant reduction in obesity-induced angiogenesis and tumor growth. At a mechanistic level, ANGPTL4 expression is induced by IL-1β from primary adipocytes in a manner dependent on NF-κB- and MAP kinase-activation, which is further enhanced by hypoxia. This report shows that adipocyte-derived ANGPTL4 drives disease progression under obese conditions and is a potential therapeutic target for treating obese breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2902937677,"Ichthyosaurs are extinct marine reptiles that display a notable external similarity to modern toothed whales. Here we show that this resemblance is more than skin deep. We apply a multidisciplinary experimental approach to characterize the cellular and molecular composition of integumental tissues in an exceptionally preserved specimen of the Early Jurassic ichthyosaur Stenopterygius. Our analyses recovered still-flexible remnants of the original scaleless skin, which comprises morphologically distinct epidermal and dermal layers. These are underlain by insulating blubber that would have augmented streamlining, buoyancy and homeothermy. Additionally, we identify endogenous proteinaceous and lipid constituents, together with keratinocytes and branched melanophores that contain eumelanin pigment. Distributional variation of melanophores across the body suggests countershading, possibly enhanced by physiological adjustments of colour to enable photoprotection, concealment and/or thermoregulation. Convergence of ichthyosaurs with extant marine amniotes thus extends to the ultrastructural and molecular levels, reflecting the omnipresent constraints of their shared adaptation to pelagic life."
https://openalex.org/W2902321532,"Orthogonal ribosomes are unnatural ribosomes that are directed towards orthogonal messenger RNAs in Escherichia coli, through an altered version of the 16S ribosomal RNA of the small subunit1. Directed evolution of orthogonal ribosomes has provided access to new ribosomal function, and the evolved orthogonal ribosomes have enabled the encoding of multiple non-canonical amino acids into proteins2-4. The original orthogonal ribosomes shared the pool of 23S ribosomal RNAs, contained in the large subunit, with endogenous ribosomes. Selectively directing a new 23S rRNA to an orthogonal mRNA, by controlling the association between the orthogonal 16S rRNAs and 23S rRNAs, would enable the evolution of new function in the large subunit. Previous work covalently linked orthogonal 16S rRNA and a circularly permuted 23S rRNA to create orthogonal ribosomes with low activity5,6; however, the linked subunits in these ribosomes do not associate specifically with each other, and mediate translation by associating with endogenous subunits. Here we discover engineered orthogonal 'stapled' ribosomes (with subunits linked through an optimized RNA staple) with activities comparable to that of the parent orthogonal ribosome; they minimize association with endogenous subunits and mediate translation of orthogonal mRNAs through the association of stapled subunits. We evolve cells with genomically encoded stapled ribosomes as the sole ribosomes, which support cellular growth at similar rates to natural ribosomes. Moreover, we visualize the engineered stapled ribosome structure by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.0 Å, revealing how the staple links the subunits and controls their association. We demonstrate the utility of controlling subunit association by evolving orthogonal stapled ribosomes which efficiently polymerize a sequence of monomers that the natural ribosome is intrinsically unable to translate. Our work provides a foundation for evolving the rRNA of the entire orthogonal ribosome for the encoded cellular synthesis of non-canonical biological polymers7."

https://openalex.org/W2902078892,"Haematopoiesis is an essential process that evolved in multicellular animals. At the heart of this process are haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are multipotent and self-renewing, and generate the entire repertoire of blood and immune cells throughout an animal's life1. Although there have been comprehensive studies on self-renewal, differentiation, physiological regulation and niche occupation in vertebrate HSCs, relatively little is known about the evolutionary origin and niches of these cells. Here we describe the haematopoietic system of Botryllus schlosseri, a colonial tunicate that has a vasculature and circulating blood cells, and interesting stem-cell biology and immunity characteristics2-8. Self-recognition between genetically compatible B. schlosseri colonies leads to the formation of natural parabionts with shared circulation, whereas incompatible colonies reject each other3,4,7. Using flow cytometry, whole-transcriptome sequencing of defined cell populations and diverse functional assays, we identify HSCs, progenitors, immune effector cells and an HSC niche, and demonstrate that self-recognition inhibits allospecific cytotoxic reactions. Our results show that HSC and myeloid lineage immune cells emerged in a common ancestor of tunicates and vertebrates, and also suggest that haematopoietic bone marrow and the B. schlosseri endostyle niche evolved from a common origin."

https://openalex.org/W2903149622,"DNA replication machinery is responsible for accurate and efficient duplication of the chromosome. Since inhibition of DNA replication can lead to replication fork stalling, resulting in DNA damage and apoptotic death, inhibitors of DNA replication are commonly used in cancer chemotherapy. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) that are essential for DNA replication and DNA damage repair. Gemcitabine, a nucleotide analog that inhibits RNR, has been used to treat various cancers. However, patients often develop resistance to this drug during treatment. Thus, new drugs that inhibit RNR are needed to be developed. In this study, we identified a synthetic analog of resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene), termed DHS (trans-4,4'-dihydroxystilbene), that acts as a potent inhibitor of DNA replication. Molecular docking analysis identified the RRM2 (ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2) of RNR as a direct target of DHS. At the molecular level, DHS induced cyclin F-mediated down-regulation of RRM2 by the proteasome. Thus, treatment of cells with DHS reduced RNR activity and consequently decreased synthesis of dNTPs with concomitant inhibition of DNA replication, arrest of cells at S-phase, DNA damage, and finally apoptosis. In mouse models of tumor xenografts, DHS was efficacious against pancreatic, ovarian, and colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, DHS overcame both gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer and cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer. Thus, DHS is a novel anti-cancer agent that targets RRM2 with therapeutic potential either alone or in combination with other agents to arrest cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2903527054,"Insertions of mobile elements1–4, mitochondrial DNA5 and fragments of nuclear chromosomes6 at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) threaten genome integrity and are common in cancer7–9. Insertions of chromosome fragments at V(D)J recombination loci can stimulate antibody diversification10. The origin of insertions of chromosomal fragments and the mechanisms that prevent such insertions remain unknown. Here we reveal a yeast mutant, lacking evolutionarily conserved Dna2 nuclease, that shows frequent insertions of sequences between approximately 0.1 and 1.5 kb in length into DSBs, with many insertions involving multiple joined DNA fragments. Sequencing of around 500 DNA inserts reveals that they originate from Ty retrotransposons (8%), ribosomal DNA (rDNA) (15%) and from throughout the genome, with preference for fragile regions such as origins of replication, R-loops, centromeres, telomeres or replication fork barriers. Inserted fragments are not lost from their original loci and therefore represent duplications. These duplications depend on nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and Pol4. We propose a model in which alternative processing of DNA structures arising in Dna2-deficient cells can result in the release of DNA fragments and their capture at DSBs. Similar DNA insertions at DSBs are expected to occur in any cells with linear extrachromosomal DNA fragments. A deficiency of Dna2 causes duplication of DNA fragments and their insertion into the genome at double-stranded breaks in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2902842438,"Background The establishment of trust between researchers and participants is critical to advance HIV and HCV prevention particularly among people who inject drugs (PWID) and other marginalized populations, yet empirical research on how to establish and maintain trust in the course of community health research is lacking. This paper documents ideas about trust between research participants and researchers amongst a sub-sample of PWID who were enrolled in a large, multi-year community health study of social networks and HIV/HCV risk that was recently conducted in rural Puerto Rico. Methods Qualitative research was nested within a multi-year Social Network and HIV/HCV Risk study involving N = 360 PWID > 18 years of age living in four small, rural Puerto Rican communities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted between March 2017 and April 2017 with a subset of 40 active PWID who had been enrolled in the parent study. Interview questions invited participants to draw upon their recent experience as research participants to better understand how PWID perceive and understand participant-researcher trust within the context of HIV/HCV-related epidemiological research. Results Fear of police, stigma and concerns regarding confidentiality and anonymity were identified as structural factors that could compromise participation in HIV/HCV-related research for PWID. While monetary compensation was an important motivation, participants also valued the opportunity to learn about their HIV/HCV status. During their participation in the study, gaining knowledge of safe injection practices was perceived as a valuable benefit. Participant narratives suggested that PWID may adopt an incremental and ongoing approach in their assessment of the trustworthiness of researchers, continuously assessing the extent to which they trust the research staff throughout the course of the research. Trust was initially generated through peer Respondent Driven Sampling recruitment. Research staff who maintained a presence in the community for the entire duration of the prospective study reinforced trust between participants and the research team. Conclusion Although PWID face numerous structural barriers to research-related trust in HIV/HCV research, we found that using a peer-based recruitment method like RDS, and employing a research staff who are knowledgeable about the targeted population, culturally sensitive to their needs, and who maintain a long-term presence in the community may help mitigate many of these barriers. The reputation of the research is built incrementally as participants join the study. This contributes to a “street reputation” that grows as current or former participants vouch for the study. Establishing trust was identified as only the first step towards building a collaborative relationship with participants, and our findings suggest that steps to address criminalization and stigmatization also are necessary to support research trust."
https://openalex.org/W2902821427,"Objective People living with HIV (PLWH) are living longer and developing comorbidities and aging-related syndromes. New care models are needed to address the combined burden and complexity of HIV and its comorbidities in this group. The goal of this study is to describe qualitative data from patients and providers that informed the development of a comprehensive care model for older PLWH. Methods Patient and provider perspectives on the clinical care and service needs of patients living and aging with HIV were explored via surveys and focus groups at a safety net HIV clinic in San Francisco. We surveyed 77 patients and 26 providers and conducted separate focus groups of older patients living with HIV (n = 31) and staff (n = 20). Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Themes for a care program were additionally explored using findings from the literature on HIV and aging. Findings Themes from surveys and focus groups emphasized (a) the need for knowledge expertise in HIV and aging, (b) focus on medical conditions and determinants of health of particular import (e.g. marginal housing) among older PLWH, (c) co-locating specialty services (e.g. cardiology, geriatrics) with primary care, and (d) addressing social isolation. Findings informed the design of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary care model for PLWH called the Golden Compass program composed of four “points”: Heart and Mind (North), Bones and Strength (East), Network and Navigation (South), and Dental, Hearing, and Vision (West). Conclusion Based on patient and clinic staff perspectives from surveys and focus groups, we designed a multidisciplinary program of integrated primary and specialty care, as well as housing and social support, to address the needs of older PLWH within a safety-net infrastructure. Golden Compass launched in 2017 for PLWH older than 50 years. Future research to evaluate the effectiveness of this care program in improving patient outcomes and satisfaction is ongoing."
https://openalex.org/W2902119919,"Maternal and child feeding behaviors are often rooted in family and sociocultural context, making these an important point of inquiry for improving nutrition and health over the life course. The present study explored the practice of fasting during religious periods in relation to eating patterns of pregnant and lactating women and young children in four regions of Ethiopia, a nation which has experienced rapid economic growth and marked improvement in health and nutrition outcomes over the last two decades. Qualitative data collection and analysis at community level illustrated conflicting areas of understanding and practice related to diets of children and pregnant and lactating women during fasting times, potentially leading to gaps in nutrition. Community participants described different understandings of fasting requirements for these vulnerable populations and associated social norms and doxa, not always in accordance with religious texts or published guidance. Useful behavior change strategies may be developed through these results to address the potential barriers to appropriate feeding patterns for pregnant and lactating women and young children in Ethiopia. This will include continuing to work with communities and religious leaders to clarify that religious doctrine promotes improved nutrition outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2902777391,"In this work, we analyzed the phenotype and growth of human NK cell clones obtained by the stimulation of individual NK cells with IL-2 and gene-modified K562 feeder cells expressing membrane-bound IL-21 (K562-mbIL21). We generated clones from NK cells at distinct differentiation and activation stages, determined by CD56, CD57 and HLA-DR expression levels. Less differentiated CD56bright NK cell subsets showed higher cloning efficiency compared with more differentiated CD56dim subsets, especially with the CD57bright subset. However, clones from the CD56dimCD57– subset lived longer on average than other subsets. Moreover, several clones with the highest cell numbers were derived from CD56dimCD57–HLA-DR−cells. Most of the clones including those derived from more differentiated CD56dimCD57+/–NKG2A– NK cells showed a less-differentiated NKG2A+ phenotype. Also, CD57– cells were frequently observed in clones derived from CD57+ NK cells suggesting the loss of CD57 during the cloning process. On the other hand, KIR surface expression once detected for a clone never disappeared entirely, confirming irreversibility of the KIR expression. In summary, we have demonstrated that in specific conditions terminally differentiated CD57+ human NK cells are able to acquire the CD57– phenotype that was previously not observed and, thus, was considered impossible."
https://openalex.org/W2902456405,"As mechanisms controlling redox homeostasis become impaired with aging, exaggerated oxidant stress may cause disproportional oxidation of cell membranes and circulating phospholipids (PLs), leading to the formation of truncated oxidized PL products (Tr-OxPLs), which exhibit deleterious effects. This study investigated the role of elevated Tr-OxPLs as a factor exacerbating inflammation and lung barrier dysfunction in an animal model of aging. Mass spectrometry analysis of Tr-OxPL species in young (2–4 mo) and aging (18–24 mo) mice revealed elevated basal levels of several products [1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-phosphocholine (POVPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaroyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine, lysophosphocholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-(9-oxo-nonanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-azelaoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, O-1-O-palmitoyl-2-O-(5,8-dioxo-8-hydroxy-6-octenoyl)-l-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and others] in the aged lungs. An intratracheal (i.t.) injection of bacterial LPS caused increased generation of Tr-OxPLs in the lungs but not in the liver, with higher levels detected in the aged group. In addition, OxPLs clearance from the lung tissue after LPS challenge was delayed in the aged group. The impact of Tr-OxPLs on endothelial cell (EC) barrier compromise under inflammatory conditions was further evaluated in the 2-hit cell culture model of acute lung injury (ALI). EC barrier dysfunction caused by cell treatment with a cytokine mixture (CM) was augmented by cotreatment with low-dose Tr-OxPLs, which did not significantly affect endothelial function when added alone. Deleterious effects of Tr-OxPLs on inflamed ECs stimulated with CM were associated with further weakening of cell junctions and more robust EC hyperpermeability. Aged mice injected intratracheally with TNF-α exhibited a more pronounced elevation of cell counts and protein content in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples. Interestingly, intravenous administration of low POVPC doses—which did not affect BAL parameters alone in young mice exposed to i.t. TNF-α challenge—augmented lung injury to the levels observed in aged mice stimulated with TNF-α alone. Inhibition of Tr-OxPL generation by ectopic expression of PL-specific platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 2 (PAFAH2) markedly reduced EC dysfunction induced by CM, whereas PAFAH2 pharmacologic inhibition augmented deleterious effects of cytokines on EC barrier function. Moreover, exacerbating effects of PAFAH2 inhibition on TNF-α–induced lung injury were observed in vivo. These results demonstrate an age-dependent increase in Tr-OxPL production under basal conditions and augmented Tr-OxPL generation upon inflammatory stimulation, suggesting a major role for elevated Tr-OxPLs in more severe ALI and delayed resolution in aging lungs.—Ke, Y., Karki, P., Kim, J., Son, S., Berdyshev, E., Bochkov, V.

https://openalex.org/W2902750226,"Choline availability modulates neurogenesis and cerebral cortex development through the regulation of neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferative and differentiation capacity. In this study, we demonstrated that cortical NPC self-renewal is controlled by choline via the expression of a microRNA (miR-129-5p), whose role in the developing brain has not been examined, and which, in turn, inhibits synthesis of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein. Specifically, we found that low choline (LC) availability led to the upregulation of miR-129-5p expression in cortical NPCs in vitro and in vivo, causing the downregulation of EGFR and thereby disrupting NPC self-renewal and cortical neurogenesis. Furthermore, in response to LC availability, methylation potential (the S-adenosylmethionine:S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio) in the developing brain was reduced. Restoring methylation potential in LC cortical NPCs led to the re-establishment of normal miR-129-5p expression. We concluded that inhibiting miR-129-5p function and restoring EGFR protein levels in vivo is sufficient to reverse LC-induced defects in cortical NPC self-renewal. For the first time, to our knowledge, we have identified the molecular links that explain how a change in the availability of the diet metabolite choline impacts the essential cellular processes underlying brain development.—Trujillo-Gonzalez, I., Wang, Y., Friday, W.

Natural schwertmannite is often enriched in Cr(III), yet the effects of Cr(III) substitution on schwertmannite transformation to more stable Fe(III) minerals has not been addressed. Here we examine, for the first time, the effects of Cr(III) substitution on the Fe(II)-accelerated transformation of schwertmannite. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fe K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy shows that Cr(III) substitution inhibits schwertmannite transformation. Substitution at a Cr(III):Fe(III) ratio of 0.025 decreased schwertmannite transformation (at pH 6.5) by 18-49% (depending on Fe(II) concentrations) relative to that of Cr(III)-free schwertmannite. Formation of crystalline secondary phases (predominantly goethite) caused associated decreases in solid-phase Fe and Cr extractability by 1 M HCl. The extractability of Cr was consistently greater than that of Fe, suggesting some accumulation of Cr(III) at the residual schwertmannite surface-a phenomenon which passivates the surface against Fe(II)/Fe(III) electron transfer and atom exchange required for the Fe(II)-accelerated transformation process.

https://openalex.org/W2905202637,"Myosins are molecular motors that use a conserved ATPase cycle to generate force. We investigated two mutations in the converter domain of myosin V (R712G and F750L) to examine how altering specific structural transitions in the motor ATPase cycle can impair myosin mechanochemistry. The corresponding mutations in the human β-cardiac myosin gene are associated with hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy, respectively. Despite similar steady-state actin-activated ATPase and unloaded in vitro motility–sliding velocities, both R712G and F750L were less able to overcome frictional loads measured in the loaded motility assay. Transient kinetic analysis and stopped-flow FRET demonstrated that the R712G mutation slowed the maximum ATP hydrolysis and recovery-stroke rate constants, whereas the F750L mutation enhanced these steps. In both mutants, the fast and slow power-stroke as well as actin-activated phosphate release rate constants were not significantly different from WT. Time-resolved FRET experiments revealed that R712G and F750L populate the pre- and post-power–stroke states with similar FRET distance and distance distribution profiles. The R712G mutant increased the mole fraction in the post-power–stroke conformation in the strong actin-binding states, whereas the F750L decreased this population in the actomyosin ADP state. We conclude that mutations in key allosteric pathways can shift the equilibrium and/or alter the activation energy associated with key structural transitions without altering the overall conformation of the pre- and post-power–stroke states.

https://openalex.org/W2903002836,"Spontaneously occurring canine mammary tumours (CMTs) are the most common neoplasms of unspayed female dogs leading to thrice higher mortality rates than human breast cancer. These are also attractive models for human breast cancer studies owing to clinical and molecular similarities. Thus, they are important candidates for biomarker studies and understanding cancer pathobiology. The study was designed to explore underlying molecular networks and pathways in CMTs for deciphering new prognostic factors and therapeutic targets. To gain an insight into various pathways and networks associated with the development and pathogenesis of CMTs, comparative cDNA microarray expression profiling was performed using CMT tissues and healthy mammary gland tissues. Upon analysis, 1700 and 1287 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, P ≤ 0.05) were identified in malignant and benign tissues, respectively. DEGs identified from microarray analysis were further annotated using the Ingenuity Systems Pathway Analysis (IPA) tool for detection of deregulated canonical pathways, upstream regulators, and networks associated with malignant, as well as, benign disease. Top scoring key networks in benign and malignant mammary tumours were having central nodes of VEGF and BUB1B, respectively. Cyclins & cell cycle regulation and TREM1 signalling were amongst the top activated canonical pathways in CMTs. Other cancer related significant pathways like apoptosis signalling, dendritic cell maturation, DNA recombination and repair, Wnt/β-catenin signalling, etc. were also found to be altered. Furthermore, seven proteins (ANXA2, APOCII, CDK6, GATC, GDI2, GNAQ and MYH9) highly up-regulated in malignant tissues were identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and MALDI-TOF PMF studies which were in concordance with microarray data. Thus, the study has uncovered ample number of candidate genes associated with CMTs which need to be further validated as therapeutic targets and prognostic markers."
https://openalex.org/W2902347436,"To improve the dissolution behavior of telmisartan (TMS), a poorly water-soluble angiotensin II receptor blocker, TMS-phospholipid complex (TPC) was prepared by solvent evaporation method and characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffractometry. The crystalline structure of TMS was transited into an amorphous state by TPC formation. The equilibrium solubility of TPC (1.3-6.1 mg/mL) in various vehicles was about 100 times higher than that of TMS (0.009-0.058 mg/mL). TPC-loaded self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) formulation was optimized using the D-optimal mixture design with the composition of 14% Capryol 90 (oil; X1), 59.9% tween 80 (surfactant; X2), and 26.1% tetraglycol (cosurfactant; X3) as independent variables, which resulted in a droplet size of 22.17 nm (Y1), TMS solubilization of 4.06 mg/mL (Y2), and 99.4% drug release in 15 min (Y3) as response factors. The desirability function value was 0.854, indicating the reliability and accuracy of optimization; in addition, good agreement was found between the model prediction and experimental values of Y1, Y2, and Y3. Dissolution of raw TMS was poor and pH-dependent, where it had extremely low dissolution (< 1% for 2 h) in water, pH 4, and pH 6.8 media; however, it showed fast and high dissolution (> 90% in 5 min) in pH 1.2 medium. In contrast, the dissolution of the optimized TPC-loaded SMEDDS was pH-independent and reached over 90% within 5 min in all the media tested. Thus, we suggested that phospholipid complex formation and SMEDDS formulation using the experimental design method might be a promising approach to enhance the dissolution of poorly soluble drugs."

In pancreatic β-cells, it helps counter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that impairs insulin secretory capacity during Type 2 diabetes. Chronic exposure of β-cells to saturated fatty acids (FAs) such as palmitate stimulates ER stress and modulates autophagy, but the effects of unsaturated FAs such as oleate, which are also elevated during obesity, are less well understood. We therefore treated MIN6 cells and mouse islets for 8–48 h with either palmitate or oleate, and then monitored autophagic flux, signaling pathways, lysosomal biology, and phospholipid profiles. Compared with palmitate, oleate more effectively stimulated both autophagic flux and clearance of autophagosomes. The flux stimulation occurred independently of ER stress, nutrient-sensing (mTOR) and signaling pathways (protein kinases A, C, and D). Instead the mechanism involved the exchange factor directly activated by cAMP 2 (EPAC2). Oleate reduced cellular cAMP, and its effects on autophagic flux were reproduced or inhibited, respectively, by Epac2 knockdown or activation. Oleate also increased lysosomal acidity and increased phospholipid saturation, consistent with improved autophagosomal fusion with lysosomes. We conclude that a potent stimulation of autophagy might help explain the known benefits of unsaturated FAs in countering the toxicity of saturated FAs in β-cells during obesity and lipid loading.

Several studies have also pointed to an impairment of autophagic clearance in β-cells during T2D, based on alterations in morphology, and accumulation of the autophagosomal marker LC3II (15Masini M.

However, the latter is generated by the lipidation of the precursor molecule LC3I as part of the proximal signaling cascade, so its accumulation could represent either enhanced flux through the upstream pathway, as well as a reduction in distal clearance. To distinguish between these possibilities we (17Chu K.Y. O'Reilly L. Ramm G. Biden T.J. High-fat diet increases autophagic flux in pancreatic beta cells in vivo and ex vivo in mice.Diabetologia. 2015; 58 (26071760): 2074-207810.1007/s00125-015-3665-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and others (18Sheng Q.

Under these conditions high-fat feeding causes an accumulation of LC3II puncta in β-cells. These results suggest that, regardless of what happens in frank diabetes, autophagic flux is activated during obesity or pre-diabetes, and this might potentially help in delaying β-cell failure. Palmitate and oleate are, respectively, the most prevalent saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) in the circulation, and both are augmented by high-fat diets. Chronic or excessive exposure to saturated FAs is often considered detrimental to multiple organs and cell types including pancreatic β-cells, whereas unsaturated ones are viewed as less toxic, and potentially beneficial (19Cnop M.

But there have been no detailed studies specifically addressing the effect of oleate on autophagic flux in β-cells. This contrasts with the situation in other cell types, where unsaturated FAs have been shown to promote proximal autophagy via a variety of mechanisms (27Tan S.H. Shui G. Zhou J. Li J.J. Bay B.H.

Therefore, the aim of the current study was to compare the effects of palmitate and oleate on both proximal and distal autophagy in β-cells, and to address underlying mechanisms. We sought to establish a threshold for FA-stimulated autophagy in MIN6 cells, as monitored by accumulation of LC3II (Fig. 1A). The steady-state levels of this autophagic marker were unaltered by 48 h pretreatment with either the saturated FA, palmitate, or the unsaturated FA, oleate, at 0.2 or 0.4 mm palmitate alone, or in combination at 0.2 mm. As expected under these conditions, the ER stress marker CHOP was increased by palmitate, with a threshold at 0.4 mm (Fig. S1). Oleate was without effect, even in combination with palmitate (Fig. S1A). As measured in the presence of CQ, however, autophagic flux was selectively enhanced by 0.4 mm oleate (Fig. 1A). In terms of time dependences, neither FA was active at 8 h (Fig. 1B), whereas oleate promoted a transient increase in steady-state LC3II levels at 24 h, and augmented flux by 24 h with a maximal effect at 48 h (Fig. 1, C and D). In many further experiments conducted over several years, with multiple batches and passages of cells, we established that palmitate was more variable in its responses than oleate, such that the unsaturated FA was confirmed as the more effective stimulator of autophagic flux overall (summarized Fig. 1E). Similar results were obtained using isolated mouse islets maintained for 48 h with the different FAs (Fig. 1F). Accumulation of LC3II is a function of both its generation via upstream signaling and degradation following fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. We first determined whether FAs alter the size of the lysosomal compartment, as assessed using both the dye LysoTracker (Fig. 2A), and staining for the lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp-1) (Fig. S2). Indeed lysosomes were markedly expanded but with little distinction between FAs or treatment times, suggesting that changes in the numbers of lysosomes do not account for the differential effects of oleate and palmitate on autophagic flux. To address functional alterations we employed LysoSensor, which exhibits a yellow to blue shift with increases in acidity, which is independent of the size of the uptake compartment. In this manner we determined that both FAs slightly decreased lysosomal pH at 8 h, with more modest effects at 48 h (Fig. 2B). This would suggest improved functionality, because many lysosomal enzymes require low pH for optimal activity. We next monitored the capacity for autophagosomes to fuse with lysosomes, using a mRFP-GFP-LC3 construct (31Kimura S. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Dissection of the autophagosome maturation process by a novel reporter protein, tandem fluorescent-tagged LC3.Autophagy. 2007; 3 (17534139): 452-46010.4161/auto.4451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). This appears yellow in autophagosomes, but red upon fusion with the acidic compartment because of the accompanying reduction in pH, which quenches GFP fluorescence. We found that oleate pretreatment significantly increased the ratio of red: yellow puncta at both 8 and 48 h, suggestive of enhanced clearance (Fig. 3, A and B). The more modest effects of palmitate were not statistically significantly different from control. The fusion of membranes is influenced by their fluidity, which in turn depends upon the presence of unsaturated FA side chains in the membrane bilayer (32van Meer G. Voelker D.R. Feigenson G.W. Membrane lipids: where they are and how they behave.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9 (18216768): 112-12410.1038/nrm2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (4481) Google Scholar). We therefore used LC-MS to determine how FA pretreatment of β-cells alters the major lipid components of cellular membranes. Oleate reduced the saturation of both PC and PE by around 30% versus control, with significant but less profound decreases in PI and SM (Fig. 3C). In contrast, palmitate modestly enhanced the saturation of PE (20%), PC (15%), and SM (5%). Neither FA altered the saturation of PS (Fig. 3C), nor the overall mass of any of these lipids (not shown). Although these alterations represent total cellular membrane it is noteworthy that they are much more apparent in those lipids that are enriched in late endosomes/lysosomes (PC, PE, and SM) than in PI and PS, which are depleted in these compartments (32van Meer G. Voelker D.R. Feigenson G.W. Membrane lipids: where they are and how they behave.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9 (18216768): 112-12410.1038/nrm2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (4481) Google Scholar). Taken together these results suggest that oleate, in addition to stimulating upstream pathways, would also promote the clearance of LC3II via a combination of decreases in lysosomal pH and increases in membrane fluidity. We next sought to determine the mechanisms contributing to the upstream pathway. We first addressed the relevance of ER stress, using the chemical chaperone PBA. As shown previously (33Akerfeldt M.C. Howes J. Chan J.Y. Stevens V.A. Boubenna N. McGuire H.M. King C. Biden T.J. Laybutt D.R. Cytokine-induced beta-cell death is independent of endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling.Diabetes. 2008; 57 (18591394): 3034-304410.2337/db07-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), this protected against induction of the markers CHOP, ATF4, and phospho-PERK in response to palmitate (Fig. S1, B–D), but more importantly it also inhibited LC3II accumulation (Fig. 4A). In keeping with our prior studies with this model (34Laybutt D.R. Preston A.M. Akerfeldt M.C. Kench J.G. Busch A.K. Biankin A.V. Biden T.J. Endoplasmic reticulum stress contributes to beta cell apoptosis in type 2 diabetes.Diabetologia. 2007; 50 (17268797): 752-76310.1007/s00125-006-0590-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), oleate did not stimulate ER stress (Fig. S1), nor did PBA block its capacity to augment LC3II (Fig. 4B). The results confirm previous findings that ER stress contributes to the stimulation of autophagic flux due to palmitate (20Choi S.E. Lee S.M. Lee Y.J. Li L.J. Lee S.J. Lee J.H. Kim Y. Jun H.S.

https://openalex.org/W2902394291,"HIV-infection, certain antiretroviral drug classes, especially protease inhibitors (PI), and obesity are associated with increased ischaemic heart disease (IHD) risk. However, the effect of PI-free fixed dose combination (FDC) antiretroviral therapy (ART) on hearts exposed to ischaemia-reperfusion injury (I/R) is unknown, particularly in obesity. This is becoming relevant as World Health Organisation guidelines recommend a FDC ART containing (non-) nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tenofovir (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC) and efavirenz (EFV)) as first-line HIV treatment. Additionally, obesity rates are rising in HIV-infected populations, not only in ART-experienced individuals, but also at the time of ART initiation, which may further increase the risk of IHD. Therefore, we investigated the effects of PI-free FDC ART in myocardial I/R-exposed hearts from obese rats. Obesity was induced in male wistar rats via a 16-week high calorie diet. At week 10, treatment with a FDC ART drug containing TDF/FTC/EFV was initiated. Biometric and metabolic parameters, as well as myocardial functional recovery and infract size (IS), and myocardial signalling proteins following I/R were assessed after 16 weeks. Obese rats presented with increased body and intraperitoneal fat mass, elevated triglyceride and TBARS levels, whilst the hearts responded to I/R with impaired functional performance and increased IS. The FDC ART treatment did not alter biometric and metabolic parameters in obese rats. In a novel finding, ART protected obese hearts against I/R as shown by improved functional performance and smaller IS vs. untreated obese hearts. Cardioprotection was underscored by increased myocardial phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and reduced AMP-kinase levels. In conclusion, these results demonstrate for the first time, that 6-weeks treatment of obese rats with a FDC ART drug specifically containing TDF/FTC/EFV conferred cardioprotection against I/R. The FDC ART-induced cardioprotection was seemingly unrelated to metabolic changes, but rather due to direct cardiac mechanisms including the up-regulation of myocardial eNOS."
https://openalex.org/W2950529298,"Targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is being adopted increasingly broadly in many research, commercial and clinical settings. Currently used target capture methods, however, typically require complex and lengthy (sometimes multi-day) workflows that complicates their use in certain applications. In addition, small panels for high sequencing depth applications such as liquid biopsy typically have low on-target rates, resulting in unnecessarily high sequencing cost. We have developed a novel targeted sequencing library preparation method, named Linked Target Capture (LTC), which replaces typical multi-day target capture workflows with a single-day, combined 'target-capture-PCR' workflow. This approach uses physically linked capture probes and PCR primers and is expected to work with panel sizes from 100 bp to >10 Mbp. It reduces the time and complexity of the capture workflow, eliminates long hybridization and wash steps and enables rapid library construction and target capture. High on-target read fractions are achievable due to repeated sequence selection in the target-capture-PCR step, thus lowering sequencing cost. We have demonstrated this technology on sample types including cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) derived DNA, capturing a 35-gene pan-cancer panel, and therein detecting single nucleotide variants, copy number variants, insertions, deletions and gene fusions. With the integration of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), variants as low as 0.25% abundance were detected, limited by input mass and sequencing depth. Additionally, sequencing libraries were prepared in less than eight hours from extracted DNA to loaded sequencer, demonstrating that LTC holds promise as a broadly applicable tool for rapid, cost-effective and high performance targeted sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2902531485,"The translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 (TOMM40), which lies in linkage disequilibrium with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). TOMM40 influences AD pathology through mitochondrial neurotoxicity, and the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is the most likely brain region for identifying early manifestations of AD-related morphology changes. While early reports indicated that the longer length poly-T allele of TOMM40 increases risk for AD, these findings have not been consistently replicated in further studies. We examined the effect of TOMM40 and APOE on regional brain positron emission tomography (PET) 2-(1-{6-[(2 [F18]fluoroethyl) (methyl) amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile (FDDNP) binding values in MTL.A total of 73 non-demented older adults (42 females; mean age: 62.9(10.9) completed genotyping for both APOE and TOMM40 and received FDDNP-PET scans. For TOMM40, the lengths of the poly-T sequence were classified as short (14-20 repeats; S), long (21-29 repeats, L) or very long (>29 repeats, VL). Using general linear models, we examined medial temporal lobe FDDNP binding and cognitive functioning between TOMM40 and APOE-4 groups, with age, sex, and education as covariates.Data from 30 individuals with APOE-4 and L TOMM40 poly-T length, 11 non E4 TOMM40 S/S, 14 non E4 TOMM40 S/VL and 13 non E4 TOMM40 VL/VL were analyzed. Medial temporal FDDNP binding differed significantly between TOMM40/APOE groups (F(3,62) = 3.3,p = .03). Participants with TOMM40 S/S exhibited significantly lower binding compared to TOMM40 S/VL and APOE-4 carriers. We did not find a significant relationship between TOMM40 poly-T lengths/APOE risk groups and cognitive functioning.This is the first report to demonstrate a significant association between longer TOMM40 poly-T lengths and higher medial temporal plaque and tangle burden in non-demented older adults. Identifying biomarkers that are risk factors for AD will enhance our ability to identify subjects likely to benefit from novel AD treatments."

However, it has not been applied to non-English languages due to the difficulties in translating grammatical concepts. In this study, we defined rules to count ideas in Japanese narratives based on a previous study and proposed a novel method to estimate ID in Japanese text using machine translation.The study participants comprised 42 Japanese patients with dementia aged 69-98 years (mean: 84.95 years). We collected free narratives from the participants to build a speech corpus. The narratives of the patients were translated into English using three machine translation systems: Google Translate, Bing Translator, and Excite Translator. The ID in the translated text was then calculated using the Dependency-based Propositional ID (DEPID), an English ID scoring tool.The maximum correlation coefficient between ID calculated using DEPID-R-ADD (a modified DEPID method to calculate ID after removing vague sentences) and the Mini-Mental State Examination score was 0.473, indicating a moderate correlation.The results demonstrate the feasibility of machine translation-based ID measurement. We believe that the basic concept of this translation approach can be applied to other non-English languages."
https://openalex.org/W2902854247,"The evaluation of genetic variability is a useful research tool for the correct management of selection and conservation strategies in dog breeds. In addition to pedigree genealogies, genomic data allow a deeper knowledge of the variability and genetic structure of populations. To date, many dog breeds, such as small regional breeds, still remain uncharacterized. Braque Français type Pyrénées (BRA) is a dog breed originating from a very old type of gun-dog used for pointing the location of game birds to hunters. Despite the ancient background, the knowledge about levels of genetic diversity, degree of inbreeding and population structure is scarce. This may raise concerns on the possibility that few inbred bloodlines may dominate the breed, and on its future health. The aim of this work was therefore to provide a high-resolution representation of the genome-wide diversity and population structure of BRA dogs, using the 170K genome-wide SNP array. Genome-wide polymorphisms in BRA were compared with those of other worldwide dog breeds. Between-dog relationships estimated from genomic data were very similar to pedigree relationships (Pearson correlation rg,a = 0.92). Results showed that BRA generally presents moderate levels of genetic diversity when compared with the major canine breeds. The estimated effective population size (recent Ne = 51) shows a similar declining pattern over generations as all other dog breeds, pointing at a common demographic history of modern canine breeds, clearly different from the demography of feral wolves. Multidimensional scaling (MDS), Bayesian clustering and Neighbor Joining tree were used to visualize and explore the genetic relationships among breeds, and revealed that BRA was highly differentiated and presented only low levels of admixture with other breeds. Brittany Spaniel, English Setter, Gordon Setter and Weimaraner dogs are the closest breeds to BRA. The exact reason for BRA being so divergent from other dog breeds, based on these results, is not yet clear. Further studies including additional ≪braccoid≫ breeds will be needed to refine the results presented here and to investigate the origin of the BRA breed. Nonetheless, the genome-wide characterization reported here provides a comprehensive insight into the genome diversity and population structure of the Braque Français, type Pyrénées breed."
https://openalex.org/W2902982157,"Equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) translocate nucleosides and nucleobases across plasma membranes, as well as a variety of anti-cancer, -viral, and -parasite nucleoside analogs. They are also key members of the purinome complex and regulate the protective and anti-inflammatory effects of adenosine. Despite their important role, little is known about the mechanisms involved in their regulation. We conducted membrane yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation studies and identified, for the first time to our knowledge, the existence of protein-protein interactions between human ENT1 and ENT2 (hENT1 and hENT2) proteins in human cells and the formation of hetero- and homo-oligomers at the plasma membrane and the submembrane region. The use of NanoLuc Binary Technology allowed us to analyze changes in the oligomeric status of hENT1 and hENT2 and how they rapidly modify the uptake profile for nucleosides and nucleobases and allow cells to respond promptly to external signals or changes in the extracellular environment. These changes in hENTs oligomerization are triggered by PKC activation and subsequent action of protein phosphatase 1.—Grañe-Boladeras, N., Williams, D., Tarmakova, Z., Stevanovic, K., Villani, L.

Thus, the functionally relevant AQP5 -1364A/C promoter single nucleotide polymorphism could impact on the development and resolution of acute kidney injury (AKI). Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that the AQP5 promoter -1364A/C polymorphism is associated with AKI in patients suffering from pneumonia evoked ARDS.This prospective study included 136 adult patients of Caucasian ethnicity with bacterially evoked pneumonia resulting in ARDS. Blood sampling was performed within 24 hours of ICU admission and patients were genotyped for the AQP5 promoter -1364A/C single nucleotide polymorphism. The development of an AKI and the cumulative net fluid balance was described over a 30-day observation period and compared between the AA and AC/CC genotypes, and between survivors and non-survivors.Incidence of an AKI upon admission did not differ in AA (58%) and AC/CC genotype carriers (60%; p = 0.791). However, on day 30, homozygous AA genotypes (57%) showed an increased prevalence of AKI compared to AC/CC genotypes (24%; p = 0.001). Furthermore, the AA genotype proved to be a strong, independent risk factor for predicting AKI persistence (odds-ratio: 3.35; 95%-CI: 1.2-9.0; p = 0.017). While a negative cumulative fluid balance was associated with increased survival (p = 0.001) the AQP5 promoter polymorphism had no impact on net fluid balance (p = 0.96).In pneumonia evoked ARDS, the AA genotype of the AQP5 promoter polymorphism is associated with a decreased recovery rate from AKI and this is independent of fluid balance. Consequently, the role of AQP5 in influencing AKI likely rests in factors other than fluid balance."

HFD-transgenic (Tg) mice exhibited reductions in hepatic steatosis and systemic insulin resistance. There was no difference in hepatic lipid accumulation between chow-fed wild-type (WT) and chow-fed Tg mice; consistently, no difference in activation of the lipogenic pathway was detected. Overactivation of hepatic nuclear sterol regulatory element-binding protein (nSrebp2)-2, the central regulator of cholesterol metabolic proteins, was observed in HFD-Tg livers along with improved cholesterol homeostasis, but no such changes were observed in HFD-WT livers. Consistent results were observed in vitro in α-mouse liver 12 cells treated with palmitate mimicking the HFD state. In addition, global gene analysis indicated that various downstream targets of nSrebp2, were up-regulated in HFD-Tg livers. Moreover, HFD-WT mice displayed islet hypertrophy and suppression of glucose-induced insulin secretion from islets, whereas HFD-Tg mice had normal pancreatic islets. This finding suggests that the improved pancreatic metabolism of HFD-Tg mice is related to the systemic effect of insulin resistance, not to the autonomous influence of pancreatic cells. Tudor-SN is likely to be a key regulator for ameliorating HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and systemic insulin resistance in vivo.-Wang, X., Xin, L., Duan, Z., Zuo, Z., Wang, Y., Ren, Y., Zhang, W., Sun, X., Liu, X., Ge, L., Yang, X., Yao, Z., Yang, J.
