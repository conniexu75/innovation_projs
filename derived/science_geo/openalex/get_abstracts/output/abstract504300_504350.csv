Here the authors scan the methylation status of CpGs across the entire genome of brain samples from aged subjects in an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). Several loci, including ANK1, were associated with AD pathology, gene expression and AD genetic risk networks. We used a collection of 708 prospectively collected autopsied brains to assess the methylation state of the brain's DNA in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that the level of methylation at 71 of the 415,848 interrogated CpGs was significantly associated with the burden of AD pathology, including CpGs in the ABCA7 and BIN1 regions, which harbor known AD susceptibility variants. We validated 11 of the differentially methylated regions in an independent set of 117 subjects. Furthermore, we functionally validated these CpG associations and identified the nearby genes whose RNA expression was altered in AD: ANK1, CDH23, DIP2A, RHBDF2, RPL13, SERPINF1 and SERPINF2. Our analyses suggest that these DNA methylation changes may have a role in the onset of AD given that we observed them in presymptomatic subjects and that six of the validated genes connect to a known AD susceptibility gene network."
https://openalex.org/W2049804077,"Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune disease resulting from damage of the hair follicle by T cells. The immune pathways required for autoreactive T cell activation in AA are not defined limiting clinical development of rational targeted therapies. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) implicated ligands for the NKG2D receptor (product of the KLRK1 gene) in disease pathogenesis. Here, we show that cytotoxic CD8(+)NKG2D(+) T cells are both necessary and sufficient for the induction of AA in mouse models of disease. Global transcriptional profiling of mouse and human AA skin revealed gene expression signatures indicative of cytotoxic T cell infiltration, an interferon-γ (IFN-γ) response and upregulation of several γ-chain (γc) cytokines known to promote the activation and survival of IFN-γ-producing CD8(+)NKG2D(+) effector T cells. Therapeutically, antibody-mediated blockade of IFN-γ, interleukin-2 (IL-2) or interleukin-15 receptor β (IL-15Rβ) prevented disease development, reducing the accumulation of CD8(+)NKG2D(+) T cells in the skin and the dermal IFN response in a mouse model of AA. Systemically administered pharmacological inhibitors of Janus kinase (JAK) family protein tyrosine kinases, downstream effectors of the IFN-γ and γc cytokine receptors, eliminated the IFN signature and prevented the development of AA, while topical administration promoted hair regrowth and reversed established disease. Notably, three patients treated with oral ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2, achieved near-complete hair regrowth within 5 months of treatment, suggesting the potential clinical utility of JAK inhibition in human AA."

Although phagocytosis of myelin in vitro promotes M2 polarization, macrophage/microglia in the injured spinal cord retain a predominantly M1 state that is detrimental to recovery. We have identified two factors that underlie this skewing toward M1 polarization in the injured CNS. We show that TNF prevents phagocytosis-mediated conversion from M1 to M2 cells in vitro and in vivo in spinal cord injury (SCI). Additionally, iron that accumulates in macrophages in SCI increases TNF expression and the appearance of a macrophage population with a proinflammatory mixed M1/M2 phenotype. In addition, transplantation experiments show that increased loading of M2 macrophages with iron induces a rapid switch from M2 to M1 phenotype.

Microglia, the yolk sac-derived resident immune cells in the CNS, respond rapidly, within minutes, to injury (Davalos et al., 2005Davalos D. Grutzendler J. Yang G. Kim J.V. Zuo Y. Jung S. Littman D.R. Dustin M.L. Gan W.B. ATP mediates rapid microglial response to local brain injury in vivo.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar). Although the early response of these cells is protective (Hines et al., 2009Hines D.J. Hines R.M. Mulligan S.J. Macvicar B.A. Microglia processes block the spread of damage in the brain and require functional chloride channels.Glia. 2009; 57: 1610-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), they rapidly become proinflammatory and set off a cascade of responses that lead to the entry of peripheral immune cells, primarily those of the monocyte-macrophage lineage (Kigerl et al., 2006Kigerl K.A. McGaughy V.M. Popovich P.G. Comparative analysis of lesion development and intraspinal inflammation in four strains of mice following spinal contusion injury.J. Comp. Neurol. 2006; 494: 578-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). As microglia become activated they retract their cytoplasmic processes and become indistinguishable by morphology and cell-surface markers from macrophages that enter the injured CNS via the peripheral circulation. The macrophage response that is triggered by CNS injury contributes to secondary damage and loss of function (David and Kroner, 2011David S. Kroner A.

On the other hand, macrophages can have protective and regeneration-promoting effects in the injured CNS (Schwartz and Yoles, 2005Schwartz M. Yoles E. Macrophages and dendritic cells treatment of spinal cord injury: from the bench to the clinic.Acta Neurochir. Suppl. 2005; 93: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This dual nature of macrophages is now thought to be due to their polarization states. Macrophages have heterogeneous phenotypes that range along a continuum from the “classically-activated” proinflammatory, cytotoxic M1 cells to the “alternatively-activated” anti-inflammatory, prorepair M2 cells (Gordon and Taylor, 2005Gordon S. Taylor P.R. Monocyte and macrophage heterogeneity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (3814) Google Scholar, Martinez et al., 2008Martinez F.O. Sica A. Mantovani A. Locati M.

Interferon-γ (IFN-γ, the prototypic T helper 1 [Th1] cytokine) and the Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) ligand, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induce M1 polarization, while the Th2 cytokine IL-4 and other factors induce M2 polarization (David and Kroner, 2011David S.

Taylor P.R. Monocyte and macrophage heterogeneity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (3814) Google Scholar). An earlier study showed that although both M1 and M2 macrophages are present in the injured spinal cord, the spinal cord environment favors polarization of predominantly M1 cytotoxic macrophages (Kigerl et al., 2009Kigerl K.A. Gensel J.C. Ankeny D.P. Alexander J.K. Donnelly D.J. Popovich P.G. Identification of two distinct macrophage subsets with divergent effects causing either neurotoxicity or regeneration in the injured mouse spinal cord.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 13435-13444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). Another recent study showed that the M2 macrophages enter the injured spinal cord via the central canal and are neuroprotective (Shechter et al., 2013Shechter R. Miller O. Yovel G. Rosenzweig N. London A. Ruckh J. Kim K.W. Klein E. Kalchenko V. Bendel P. et al.Recruitment of beneficial M2 macrophages to injured spinal cord is orchestrated by remote brain choroid plexus.Immunity. 2013; 38: 555-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Gaining an understanding of why the spinal cord environment favors largely M1 polarization is important to developing approaches to reduce M1 and enhance protective M2 polarization to promote recovery after injury. Previous work has shown that myelin phagocytosis in vitro induces a shift in expression from proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory cytokines (Boven et al., 2006Boven L.A. Van Meurs M. Van Zwam M. Wierenga-Wolf A. Hintzen R.Q. Boot R.G. Aerts J.M. Amor S. Nieuwenhuis E.E. Laman J.D.

Letiembre M. Walter S. Kulanga M. Neumann H. Fassbender K. Suppression of microglial inflammatory activity by myelin phagocytosis: role of p47-PHOX-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12904-12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Tissue damage and hemorrhage that results from spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to phagocytosis of damaged myelin and red blood cells (RBCs), which are a rich source of iron. How such phagocytosis influences macrophage and microglia polarization is not clearly understood. In this paper, we show that despite the fact that myelin phagocytosis in vitro induces M1-polarized macrophages and microglia to switch to a M2 state, macrophages/microglia in the injured spinal cord remain predominantly M1 polarized even after the time when they phagocytose myelin and apoptotic cells. We show that TNF whose expression is regulated by MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) plays a crucial role in preventing M2 and promoting M1 polarization. We also show that high intracellular iron accumulation in macrophages induces TNF expression; the appearance of a proinflammatory mixed M1/M2 macrophage population; and switching from M2 to M1 phenotype. These mechanisms contribute to the prolonged maintenance of proinflammatory cytotoxic M1 macrophages in the injured spinal cord. Previous work using RT-PCR, a microarray analysis of select genes and immunofluorescence staining, showed a predominance of M1 macrophage polarization in the injured mouse spinal cord (Kigerl et al., 2009Kigerl K.A. Gensel J.C. Ankeny D.P. Alexander J.K. Donnelly D.J. Popovich P.G. Identification of two distinct macrophage subsets with divergent effects causing either neurotoxicity or regeneration in the injured mouse spinal cord.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 13435-13444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). We extended this work at the protein and single-cell level using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis to assess the expression of a variety of M1 and M2 markers in macrophages and microglia in the adult mouse spinal cord at 1, 4, and 15 days after contusion injury. These time points were chosen to investigate the very early microglia response before the influx of macrophages (1 day), the early influx of macrophages from the peripheral circulation (4 days), and the maximal phagocytic response of macrophage/microglia (15 days). This analysis revealed that much higher percentages of macrophages (CD11b+, CD45high) and microglia (CD11b+, CD45low) express M1 markers (CD16/32, CD86) than M2 markers (CD206, arginase-1 and TGF-β) (Figures 1D, 1E, and 1G–1I ). Macrophages show a steady increase in expression of the M1 marker CD16/32 between 1 and 15 days after SCI, reaching a maximum of about 60% (Figure 1D). CD86, another M1 marker, showed a delayed increase in macrophages after injury, reaching a maximum of about 20% at day 4 (Figure 1E). In contrast, microglia show a steady level of expression of CD16/32 at about 30% for the entire 2 week period. CD86 was also expressed in about 10%−15% of microglia. These results indicate that the expression of these M1 markers is more robust in macrophages than in microglia, particularly at day 15. Interestingly, iNOS, which shares the same substrate (L-arginine) with arginase-1, is only expressed in a small proportion of macrophages and microglia (Figure 1F) and may therefore not be a good M1 marker in the context of SCI. The M2 markers CD206, arginase-1, and TGF-β are only expressed in a small percentage of cells (Figures 1G–1I). Arginase-1 is expressed in about 8% of microglia at day 4 and reduced to 3% at day 15 after injury, while only 2% of macrophages express arginase-1 throughout the 2 week period. CD206 is expressed in about 2% of macrophages and microglia. The level of expression of TGF-β, a M2 cytokine, is similar in microglia and macrophages at day 4 (8%–10%) and reduced 2-fold by day 15. These findings further indicate that M1 polarization is favored in the injured spinal cord. Evidence that macrophages in the injured spinal cord have predominantly a M1 phenotype is surprising as phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and myelin by activated macrophages leads to downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (Boven et al., 2006Boven L.A. Van Meurs M. Van Zwam M. Wierenga-Wolf A. Hintzen R.Q. Boot R.G. Aerts J.M. Amor S. Nieuwenhuis E.E. Laman J.D. Myelin-laden macrophages are anti-inflammatory, consistent with foam cells in multiple sclerosis.Brain. 2006; 129: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, Voll et al., 1997Voll R.E. Herrmann M. Roth E.A. Stach C. Kalden J.R. Girkontaite I. Immunosuppressive effects of apoptotic cells.Nature. 1997; 390: 350-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). We therefore carried out experiments to assess whether myelin phagocytosis by activated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and microglia also induce changes in expression of a panel of M1 and M2 markers and importantly whether this alters their cytotoxic properties. BMDMs and microglia were activated by the toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) ligand, LPS, or a combination of LPS and IFN-γ (i.e., M1 polarizing conditions) followed by myelin phagocytosis, and the expression of M1 and M2 markers was assessed by FACS analysis. Effects on BMDMs. Myelin phagocytosis by LPS and LPS+IFN-γ-activated BMDMs resulted in a decrease in the proportion of cells expressing M1 markers (CD16/32 and CD86) and increase in cells expressing M2 markers (CD206 and CD204) (Figures 2B, 2C, 2E, and 2F ) as compared to LPS and LPS+IFN-γ. Similar results were seen with measurement of the relative fluorescence units [RFU]) (see Figure S1 available online). We confirmed that these effects are due to phagocytosis by labeling myelin with a pH sensitive dye (pHrodo Red, SE) that fluoresces when taken up into lysosomes. Under these conditions cells that phagocytosed myelin show decreased expression of M1 and increased expression of M2 markers (Figure S2). Previous reports indicated that TNF mRNA is reduced in macrophages after myelin phagocytosis in vitro (Boven et al., 2006Boven L.A. Van Meurs M. Van Zwam M. Wierenga-Wolf A. Hintzen R.Q. Boot R.G. Aerts J.M. Amor S. Nieuwenhuis E.E. Laman J.D. Myelin-laden macrophages are anti-inflammatory, consistent with foam cells in multiple sclerosis.Brain. 2006; 129: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Our FACS analysis shows that myelin phagocytosis almost completely blocks LPS and LPS+IFN-γ-induced increase in TNF protein expression (Figure 2D). Ly6C, which is highly expressed in LPS-activated BMDMs, was also markedly reduced by myelin phagocytosis (Figure 2G). Effects on Microglia. Myelin phagocytosis by LPS-activated microglia also resulted in reduction in M1 markers (CD16/32, CD86, TNF, and iNOS) (Figures 2I–2K and 2N) and increased expression of M2 markers (CD206 and arginase-1) as compared to LPS and LPS+IFN-γ activation (Figures 2L and 2M). CX3CR1 (fractalkine receptor), which contributes to proinflammatory damage after SCI (Donnelly et al., 2011Donnelly D.J. Longbrake E.E. Shawler T.M. Kigerl K.A. Lai W. Tovar C.A. Ransohoff R.M. Popovich P.G. Deficient CX3CR1 signaling promotes recovery after mouse spinal cord injury by limiting the recruitment and activation of Ly6Clo/iNOS+ macrophages.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 9910-9922Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), is highly expressed in microglia stimulated with LPS or LPS+IFN-γ and is markedly reduced after myelin phagocytosis (Figure 2O). Similar changes are seen in the RFU values (see Figure S1). These effects of phagocytosis on macrophage polarization are not entirely unique to myelin as it is also seen with phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils and red-blood cells (RBCs) but with important differences. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of mRNA expression of M1 markers after phagocytosis of myelin, apoptotic neutrophils, or RBCs by LPS-activated BMDMs showed that although phagocytosis of all three reduced expression of cell-surface M1 markers (CD16, CD86) there were important differences in proinflammatory cytokine expression. Unlike myelin phagocytosis, which almost completely eliminates the LPS-induced increase in TNF and IL-12 (90%–100% reduction), phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils results in continued high expression of IL-12 at the level induced by LPS, while after RBC phagocytosis high TNF expression is maintained at the LPS level and remarkably there is a 3.8-fold increase of IL-12 (see Figure S4). These results indicate that phagocytosis of different targets has selective effects on polarization. Furthermore, phagocytosis of RBCs by unstimulated macrophages also markedly upregulates expression of TNF and IL-12, unlike phagocytosis of myelin or apoptotic neutrophils, which do not alter the expression of these cytokines from the unstimulated levels (see Figure S4). Functional effects of the strong M2 polarizing nature of myelin phagocytosis on macrophages/microglia were assessed using neuronal survival and outgrowth assays. Neuronal Viability. Myelin phagocytosis reduced the cytotoxic properties of LPS-activated BMDMs and microglia. Cerebral cortical neuron cultures were treated for 5 days with conditioned medium obtained from BMDMs or microglia cultures treated with one of the following: (1) LPS, (2) LPS followed by myelin phagocytosis, or (3) untreated cells (control); cytotoxicity was measured by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. Cell death induced by culture medium from LPS-activated microglia (403 ± 73 μU/ml) was completely eliminated by myelin phagocytosis and was similar to conditioned media from untreated cells (value of 0 in both) (p value = 0.03). In the case of BMDMs, cell death induced by LPS-activated culture medium (190 ± 40 μU/ml) was reduced about 25% by myelin phagocytosis (144 ± 4 μU/ml) (p value = 0.036), which is the same level as that of culture medium from untreated BMDM cultures (148 ± 9 μU/ml), indicating that myelin phagocytosis reverses the cytotoxic effects induced by LPS activation. Neurite Growth. To assess neurite outgrowth, dissociated neonatal mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were plated on laminin-coated glass coverslips in nerve growth factor-containing medium. After culturing overnight, DRG neurons were treated for 24 hr with conditioned medium from control untreated BMDM cultures, BMDMs treated with LPS, or LPS followed by myelin phagocytosis (Figures 3A–3C). Sholl analysis revealed that LPS-treated BMDM supernatants reduced the length of neurite growth, as well as the total number of neuritic branches, as compared to supernatants of untreated controls (Figures 3A–3F). Interestingly, incubation of DRG cultures with conditioned medium of LPS-treated BMDMs that phagocytosed myelin increased the length of neurite growth (Figure 3E) and the total number of branches (Figure 3F), restoring it to the control level. These data show that myelin phagocytosis by LPS-treated BMDMs reverses the negative effects of M1-polarized BMDMs on neurite growth. Taken together, these results indicate that myelin phagocytosis by M1-polarized macrophages and microglia induces a change to M2 polarization. Importantly, the functional consequence of this is the reversal of LPS-induced cytotoxic properties of macrophages on neuronal viability and neurite growth. Myelin Phagocytosis Inhibits NF-κB Signaling. BMDMs treated with LPS show a marked increase in translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB from the cytosol (in unstimulated condition) to the nucleus (Figures 3G–3I). This LPS-induced nuclear translocation of p65 was strongly suppressed by myelin phagocytosis similar to the level seen with the IκBα inhibitor (BAY11-7082). These results were further confirmed by western blot analysis of IκBα of LPS-treated BMDMs with and without myelin phagocytosis. These experiments showed a 2-fold increase in total IκBα after myelin phagocytosis by LPS-treated cells as compared to cells treated with LPS alone, indicating that IκBα degradation, a sign of activation of the NFκB pathway (Baeuerle and Baltimore, 1988Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. I kappa B: a specific inhibitor of the NF-kappa B transcription factor.Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar), is inhibited in LPS-myelin-treated cells (Figures 3J and 3K). These results suggest that the effects of myelin phagocytosis on polarization are mediated in part via the NF-κB pathway. Despite the fact that macrophages and microglia phagocytose myelin and other tissue debris in the first 2 weeks after spinal cord contusion injury, the environment of the injured spinal cord favors M1 polarization as shown by our FACS analysis described above (Figure 1), as well as in an earlier report (Kigerl et al., 2009Kigerl K.A. Gensel J.C. Ankeny D.P. Alexander J.K. Donnelly D.J. Popovich P.G. Identification of two distinct macrophage subsets with divergent effects causing either neurotoxicity or regeneration in the injured mouse spinal cord.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 13435-13444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). Our search for potential candidates that can influence M1 polarization focused on TNF as TNF mRNA is rapidly upregulated after contusion injury in mice and is expressed by microglia and other CNS cell types (Pineau and Lacroix, 2007Pineau I. Lacroix S. Proinflammatory cytokine synthesis in the injured mouse spinal cord: multiphasic expression pattern and identification of the cell types involved.J. Comp. Neurol. 2007; 500: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Our FACS analysis shows that expression of TNF at the protein level is also increased rapidly in macrophages and microglia after SCI and continues to be expressed by macrophages at 15 days postinjury (Figure 4A). We therefore assessed whether TNF can influence M1 polarization of macrophages and microglia in our in vitro model. Incubation of LPS-stimulated BMDMs and microglia with recombinant TNF (rTNF) completely prevented the myelin phagocytosis-induced reduction in the M1 marker CD16/32 as detected by FACS analysis (Figures 4B and 4C). Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis showed that addition of rTNF to LPS and myelin-treated BMDMs also led to a significant increase of other M1 markers (fold increase of CD86 = 2.6 ± 1.1; iNOS = 12.1 ± 1.9; IL-12 = 106.7 ± 86.4; TNF = 4.5 ± 1.9) and reduction of the M2 marker expression (fold reduction of CD206 = 12.1 ± 2.07). Recombinant TNF treatment, however, does not block myelin phagocytosis (see Figure S5). In addition, LPS-treated BMDMs from TNF null mice showed decreased expression of M1 polarization markers (CD86, iNOS and IL-12), which were further reduced by myelin phagocytosis (Figure S5). These data indicate a TNF-dependent and TNF-independent effect on the myelin effect on M1 polarization. Furthermore, the reduction in neurite growth from DRG neurons induced by supernatants from LPS-treated BMDMs was completely abrogated when BMDMs from TNF null mice were used (see Figure S5). These data indicate that TNF can prevent the myelin phagocytosis-induced switch from M1 to M2 and thus retain the cells in a proinflammatory M1 state and also mediate the neurite growth inhibitory effects of LPS-activated M1 macrophages. We next assessed the role of TNF on macrophage polarization and recovery after SCI. Double immunofluorescence labeling of tissue sections of wild-type and TNF null mice 7 days after contusion injury showed a shift in macrophage polarization toward M2 cells with a 2-fold increase in expression of the M2 markers arginase-1 (Figures 4D–4F) and CD206 (Figures 4G–4I) and a small but significant reduction in CD16/32+ macrophages (61.6 ± 0.8 in wild-type mice versus 56.3 ± 3.6 in TFN-α null mice; p value = 0.01). These results show that the expression of TNF in the injured spinal cord contributes to promoting M1 polarization. We also found that TNF null mice showed a remarkable improvement in locomotor recovery based on the 9-point Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) analysis. This is in agreement with studies showing that treatment with TNF antagonists improves recovery after SCI (Chen et al., 2011Chen K.B. Uchida K. Nakajima H. Yayama T. Hirai T. Watanabe S. Guerrero A.R. Kobayashi S. Ma W.Y. Liu S.Y. Baba H. Tumor necrosis factor-α antagonist reduces apoptosis of neurons and oligodendroglia in rat spinal cord injury.Spine. 2011; 36: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, Genovese et al., 2006Genovese T. Mazzon E. Crisafulli C. Di Paola R. Muià C. Bramanti P. Cuzzocrea S. Immunomodulatory effects of etanercept in an experimental model of spinal cord injury.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 1006-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Our results show that the BMS scores were improved by about 3 points. By 28 days after SCI the wild-type mice had a BMS score of 3 while the TNF null mice had improved to a score of 6. A score of 3 means that the wild-type mice showed no plantar stepping, while a score of 6 indicates that the TNF−/− mice showed frequent or consistent plantar stepping with coordination (Figure 4J). In addition, striking improvement was seen in the BMS subscores that evaluate finer aspects of locomotor control. The BMS subscore improved from an average score of 0.8 in the wild-type to 5.3 in TNF null mice at day 28 (Figure 4K). We have previously reported that TNF expression in the injured spinal cord is reduced about 26-fold in MK2 null mice as compared to wild-type mice (Ghasemlou et al., 2010Ghasemlou N. Lopez-Vales R. Lachance C. Thuraisingam T. Gaestel M. Radzioch D. David S. Mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) contributes to secondary damage after spinal cord injury.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 13750-13759Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed the expression of M1 and M2 markers in CD11b+ macrophages/microglia in the spinal cord of MK2 null mice 7 days after contusion injury. There was a 2-fold increase in arginase-1 expression (increasing it to about half of all CD11b+ cells) (Figures 5A–5C) and a 3-fold increase in CD206 (Figures 5D–5F) in MK2 null mice as compared to wild-type controls. There was also a significant reduction in the M1 marker CD86 (Figures 5G–5I). The increases in the M2 markers arginase-1 and CD206 were comparable to those seen in TNF null mice (Figures 4F and 4I). These results indicate that the remarkable improvement in locomotor recovery after SCI in MK2 null mice, which we reported earlier (Ghasemlou et al., 2010Ghasemlou N. Lopez-Vales R. Lachance C. Thuraisingam T. Gaestel M. Radzioch D. David S. Mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) contributes to secondary damage after spinal cord injury.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 13750-13759Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), is probably mediated by reduction in TNF which results in a predominance of protective M2 macrophage polarization. Spinal cord contusion injury results in hemorrhage and extravasation of red blood cells (RBCs) into the spinal cord, which are rapidly phagocytosed by macrophages. Iron is also likely to be released from dying cells and taken up by macrophages. Ferritin is an iron binding and storage protein, the expression of which is increased by elevated intracellular iron, and is therefore a good surrogate marker for intracellular iron. We examined the expression of TNF in ferritin+, CD11b+ macrophage/microglia in wild-type mice at 7 and 14 days after SCI. Interestingly, the number of ferritin+ macrophages/microglia that expressed TNF was 2- to 3-fold greater than in ferritin-negative CD11b+ cells (Figures 6A and 6B ), with the majority (60%–80%) of the ferritin+ cells expressing TNF. In the absence of TNF (i.e., in TNF null mice) there is a 2.4-fold increase in the expression of the M2 marker CD206, a 60% increase in arginase-1, and a significant decrease (22%) in the M1 marker CD16/32 in iron-containing CD11b+ macrophage/microglia as compared to wild-type mice (Figures 6C–6I). Similar increases in the expression of arginase-1 and CD206 and decrease in CD16/32 in ferritin+ macrophages were also detected in the injured spinal cord of MK2 null mice (Figure 6J). Since TNF and CD16/32 are expressed in close to 80% of the ferritin-containing cells in wild-type mice (Figures 6B and 6F), the expression of arginase-1 in about 40% of the ferritin-containing macrophages suggests the presence of a subpopulation with a mixed M1/M2 phenotype that is proinflammatory. Figure 6K shows evidence of ferritin+ cells expressing M1 (CD16/32) and M2 (arginase-1) markers in the same cell (also see Figure S6). Cells coexpressing other M1/M2 markers, i.e., iNOS/arginase, were also detected by FACS analysis between 1 and 15 days after SCI (data not shown). A similar population of iron-containing macrophages with mixed M1/M2 proinflammatory phenotype was also found in chronic skin ulcers, in which they cause tissue damage (Sindrilaru et al., 2011Sindrilaru A. Peters T. Wieschalka S. Baican C. Baican A. Peter H. Hainzl A. Schatz S. Qi Y. Schlecht A. et al.An unrestrained proinflammatory M1 macrophage population induced by iron impairs wound healing in humans and mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 985-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). These data suggest that TNF increases M1 and decreases M2 polarization particularly in iron-containing macrophages in the injured spinal cord. After SCI, many macrophages are already iron loaded because of the phagocytosis of RBCs that enter the tissue due to hemorrhage. We tested whether increasing the iron load further by systemic treatment with iron-dextran would alter TNF expression and worsen outcome after SCI. Mice were treated daily for 7 days after injury with 5 mg of iron-dextran intraperitoneally starting 1 day prior to contusion injury. Strikingly, a 3.5-fold increase in TNF expression was detected by ELISA in the injured spinal cord of mice treated with iron-dextran as compared to control (dextran-treated) mice at 5 days post injury (Figure 6N). Increased iron deposition was seen in the injured spinal cord of iron-dextran-treated mice as compared to dextran-treated control mice detected by iron histochemistry (Figures 6L and 6M) as well as using the ferrozine colorimetric assay (see Figure S7).

https://openalex.org/W1991244004,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by progressive neuropathology and cognitive decline. We performed a cross-tissue analysis of methylomic variation in AD using samples from four independent human post-mortem brain cohorts. We identified a differentially methylated region in the ankyrin 1 (ANK1) gene that was associated with neuropathology in the entorhinal cortex, a primary site of AD manifestation. This region was confirmed as being substantially hypermethylated in two other cortical regions (superior temporal gyrus and prefrontal cortex), but not in the cerebellum, a region largely protected from neurodegeneration in AD, or whole blood obtained pre-mortem from the same individuals. Neuropathology-associated ANK1 hypermethylation was subsequently confirmed in cortical samples from three independent brain cohorts. This study represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first epigenome-wide association study of AD employing a sequential replication design across multiple tissues and highlights the power of this approach for identifying methylomic variation associated with complex disease."
https://openalex.org/W1968461255,"Dysregulated neurodevelopment with altered structural and functional connectivity is believed to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders, and 'a disease of synapses' is the major hypothesis for the biological basis of schizophrenia. Although this hypothesis has gained indirect support from human post-mortem brain analyses and genetic studies, little is known about the pathophysiology of synapses in patient neurons and how susceptibility genes for mental disorders could lead to synaptic deficits in humans. Genetics of most psychiatric disorders are extremely complex due to multiple susceptibility variants with low penetrance and variable phenotypes. Rare, multiply affected, large families in which a single genetic locus is probably responsible for conferring susceptibility have proven invaluable for the study of complex disorders. Here we generated induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from four members of a family in which a frameshift mutation of disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) co-segregated with major psychiatric disorders and we further produced different isogenic iPS cell lines via gene editing. We showed that mutant DISC1 causes synaptic vesicle release deficits in iPS-cell-derived forebrain neurons. Mutant DISC1 depletes wild-type DISC1 protein and, furthermore, dysregulates expression of many genes related to synapses and psychiatric disorders in human forebrain neurons. Our study reveals that a psychiatric disorder relevant mutation causes synapse deficits and transcriptional dysregulation in human neurons and our findings provide new insight into the molecular and synaptic etiopathology of psychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1985231277,"RIPK1 is shown to have a crucial role—independent of its known kinase function—in suppressing epithelial cell apoptosis and necroptosis in mice, thereby regulating homeostasis and preventing inflammation in barrier tissues. Receptor-interacting protein 1 kinase (RIPK1) is involved in the activation of various cell death pathways and in the control of inflammatory signalling. Two separate groups reporting in this issue use contrasting techniques to show that as well as promoting cell death, RIPK1 has a paradoxical function in supporting the survival of mouse epithelial cells that is independent of its kinase function. RIPK1 suppresses epithelial cell apoptosis and necroptosis by preventing FADD/caspase-8-mediated apoptosis and RIPK3-dependent necroptosis. These findings, together with genetic data, suggest that RIPK1 is a master regulator of epithelial cell survival, homeostasis and inflammation in the intestine and the skin. Necroptosis has emerged as an important pathway of programmed cell death in embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, immunity and inflammation1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. RIPK1 is implicated in inflammatory and cell death signalling9,10,11,12,13 and its kinase activity is believed to drive RIPK3-mediated necroptosis14,15. Here we show that kinase-independent scaffolding RIPK1 functions regulate homeostasis and prevent inflammation in barrier tissues by inhibiting epithelial cell apoptosis and necroptosis. Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific RIPK1 knockout caused IEC apoptosis, villus atrophy, loss of goblet and Paneth cells and premature death in mice. This pathology developed independently of the microbiota and of MyD88 signalling but was partly rescued by TNFR1 (also known as TNFRSF1A) deficiency. Epithelial FADD ablation inhibited IEC apoptosis and prevented the premature death of mice with IEC-specific RIPK1 knockout. However, mice lacking both RIPK1 and FADD in IECs displayed RIPK3-dependent IEC necroptosis, Paneth cell loss and focal erosive inflammatory lesions in the colon. Moreover, a RIPK1 kinase inactive knock-in delayed but did not prevent inflammation caused by FADD deficiency in IECs or keratinocytes, showing that RIPK3-dependent necroptosis of FADD-deficient epithelial cells only partly requires RIPK1 kinase activity. Epidermis-specific RIPK1 knockout triggered keratinocyte apoptosis and necroptosis and caused severe skin inflammation that was prevented by RIPK3 but not FADD deficiency. These findings revealed that RIPK1 inhibits RIPK3-mediated necroptosis in keratinocytes in vivo and identified necroptosis as a more potent trigger of inflammation compared with apoptosis. Therefore, RIPK1 is a master regulator of epithelial cell survival, homeostasis and inflammation in the intestine and the skin."

However, this notion has been based largely on in vitro studies and transplantation models; where lineage tracing has been used, results have been conflicting and effect sizes have been small. Here, we used genetic and nucleoside analog-based tools to mark and track the origin and contribution of various cell populations to liver regeneration in vivo following several ADC-inducing insults. We report that, contrary to prevailing stem-cell-based models of regeneration, virtually all new hepatocytes come from preexisting hepatocytes."

Antibodies were administered subcutaneously with a loading dose of 3 mg per mouse and three to five subsequent doses of 1.5 mg each, spaced 3–4 days apart (Figure 1A). Consistent with human and macaque studies, 18 of 22 mice treated with ART showed viremia after ART termination, demonstrating that this form of therapy is relatively ineffective at preventing reservoir development in hu-mice when administered 4 days after infection (Figure 1C). Among the 18 viremic mice, viremia was first detected 28–84 days after ART termination (Figures 1C and S1). In contrast, 10 of 21 hu-mice treated with antibodies 4 days after infection showed viremia by the terminal point (p = 0.027, Figure 1F), and for 9 of these 10 viremic mice, the first detectable viremia occurred 74–107 days after the last antibody injection (Figures 1D and S1 and Data S1A). The delay in viral rebound observed for mice treated with antibody at day 4 was statistically significant compared to ART-treated mice (Figure S1). The mice that rebounded showed a geometric mean antibody concentration at rebound of 0.46 μg/ml. However, sustained inhibitory antibody levels did not account for the 11 mice that did not rebound, all of which had antibody levels ≤0.50 μg/ml by termination (Data S1C). In contrast to bNAb treatment at day 4, bNAb treatment after 8 days was far less effective, resulting in viremia in 10 of the 11 treated mice 44–58 days after the last antibody injection (Figures 1E and 1F and Data S1B). Mice in the early treatment group that failed to show detectable plasma viremia were further examined for the presence of human CD4+ T cells and cell-associated HIV-1 RNA and DNA in the spleen. We found that mice that failed to develop sustained plasma viremia had similar percentages of CD4+ T cells relative to infected controls, which correlated with absolute CD4+ T cell levels (Figures 1G and S2). Therefore, differences in CD4+ T cell levels are unlikely to account for the observed differences between viremic and aviremic mice (Figure 1G). Moreover, T-cell-associated HIV-1 RNA levels were consistent with plasma viral loads, with mice that remained aviremic having either undetectable or lower cell-associated HIV-1 RNA than mice that developed sustained viremia (Figure 1H). We measured cell-associated viral DNA as an imperfect surrogate of the HIV-1 reservoir. HIV-1 DNA is thought to overestimate the reservoir because it fails to exclude damaged or incomplete viral sequences that cannot be reactivated (Ho et al., 2013Ho Y.C. Shan L. Hosmane N.N. Wang J. Laskey S.B. Rosenbloom D.I. Lai J. Blankson J.N. Siliciano J.D. Siliciano R.F. Replication-competent noninduced proviruses in the latent reservoir increase barrier to HIV-1 cure.Cell. 2013; 155: 540-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). In addition, the overall number of cells assayed in mice is limited and therefore the assay is not very sensitive. Nevertheless, we found HIV-1 DNA measurements to be consistent with each mouse’s rebound status (Figure 1I). We conclude that bNAbs can interfere with the establishment of the latent HIV-1 reservoir in hu-mice, as determined by the significant delay in viral rebound. To determine whether the efficacy of bNAbs is dependent on the antibodies’ ability to engage components of the immune system through their Fc domains, we repeated the day 4 postexposure prophylaxis experiments using the same tri-mix of bNAbs carrying Fc region mutations that abrogate both human and mouse Fc-receptor binding (G236R/L328R; GRLR, herein referred to as FcRnull) (Horton et al., 2010Horton H.M.

Despite equivalent neutralizing activity in TZM-bl assays (Pietzsch et al., 2012Pietzsch J. Gruell H. Bournazos S. Donovan B.M. Klein F. Diskin R. Seaman M.S. Bjorkman P.J. Ravetch J.V. Ploss A. Nussenzweig M.C. A mouse model for HIV-1 entry.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 15859-15864Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), FcRnull antibodies were far less potent than controls in vivo (Figure 2 and Data S2). Mice treated with FcRnull tri-mix initially suppressed viremia at the same rate as the wild-type antibody-treated mice (Figure 2A). However, 9 of 15 mice receiving postexposure prophylaxis with the FcRnull tri-mix showed viral rebound by 44 days after the last antibody injection. In contrast, 44 days after the last injection of control antibodies, only 1 of 21 mice showed rebound viremia (p = 0.0004). Not only was the delay in viral rebound significantly reduced for FcRnull antibodies, but the antibody levels at the time of viral rebound were ∼50-fold higher for mice receiving FcRnull tri-mix compared to wild-type tri-mix (p = 0.0007, Figure 2B). This suggests that FcRnull antibodies have reduced activity in vivo, and thus Fc function enhances antibody activity but is not an absolute requirement. The escape variants to the individual bNAbs in the tri-mix used in these experiments have been documented extensively (Horwitz et al., 2013Horwitz J.A. Halper-Stromberg A. Mouquet H. Gitlin A.D. Tretiakova A. Eisenreich T.R. Malbec M. Gravemann S. Billerbeck E.

Abadir A. et al.HIV therapy by a combination of broadly neutralizing antibodies in humanized mice.Nature. 2012; 492: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). However, we have never observed HIV-1 escape by mutation to the bNAb tri-mix. Rather, viral rebound is usually due to a drop in antibody concentrations to subtherapeutic levels (Horwitz et al., 2013Horwitz J.A. Halper-Stromberg A. Mouquet H. Gitlin A.D. Tretiakova A. Eisenreich T.R. Malbec M. Gravemann S. Billerbeck E.

Abadir A. et al.HIV therapy by a combination of broadly neutralizing antibodies in humanized mice.Nature. 2012; 492: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Because mice receiving FcRnull tri-mix showed viral rebound in the presence of antibody concentrations far higher than the therapeutic threshold for wild-type antibodies (Figure 2B), we cloned and sequenced gp120 from the 9 mice that rebounded by day 44 to examine the mechanism for viral breakthrough in the presence of FcRnull tri-mix (Figure 2C). Among all 40 clones sequenced, not a single clone had the triple combination of signature mutations that confer escape to the antibody-tri-mix. We conclude that viral rebound in FcRnull tri-mix-treated mice is not attributable to antibody escape but, rather, reduced antibody potency. Thus, FcRnull mutant antibodies, which cannot engage Fc receptors, are less active in suppressing infection than their wild-type counterparts, and optimal postexposure prophylaxis by bNAbs requires engagement of Fc receptors. A small number (∼15%) of chronically infected hu-mice and macaques treated with antibodies fail to show rebound viremia after therapy is discontinued (Barouch et al., 2013Barouch D.H. Whitney J.B.

https://openalex.org/W2157495337,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) is a haematological malignancy with a dismal overall prognosis, including a relapse rate of up to 25%, mainly because of the lack of non-cytotoxic targeted therapy options. Drugs that target the function of key epigenetic factors have been approved in the context of haematopoietic disorders, and mutations that affect chromatin modulators in a variety of leukaemias have recently been identified; however, 'epigenetic' drugs are not currently used for T-ALL treatment. Recently, we described that the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) has a tumour-suppressor role in T-ALL. Here we delineated the role of the histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases JMJD3 and UTX in T-ALL. We show that JMJD3 is essential for the initiation and maintenance of T-ALL, as it controls important oncogenic gene targets by modulating H3K27 methylation. By contrast, we found that UTX functions as a tumour suppressor and is frequently genetically inactivated in T-ALL. Moreover, we demonstrated that the small molecule inhibitor GSKJ4 (ref. 5) affects T-ALL growth, by targeting JMJD3 activity. These findings show that two proteins with a similar enzymatic function can have opposing roles in the context of the same disease, paving the way for treating haematopoietic malignancies with a new category of epigenetic inhibitors."

We describe a high-frequency missense mutation in the EGLN1 gene, which encodes prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), that contributes to this adaptive response. We show that a variant in EGLN1, c.[12C>G; 380G>C], contributes functionally to the Tibetan high-altitude phenotype. PHD2 triggers the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), which mediate many physiological responses to hypoxia, including erythropoiesis. The PHD2 p.[Asp4Glu; Cys127Ser] variant exhibits a lower K(m) value for oxygen, suggesting that it promotes increased HIF degradation under hypoxic conditions. Whereas hypoxia stimulates the proliferation of wild-type erythroid progenitors, the proliferation of progenitors with the c.[12C>G; 380G>C] mutation in EGLN1 is significantly impaired under hypoxic culture conditions. We show that the c.[12C>G; 380G>C] mutation originated ∼8,000 years ago on the same haplotype previously associated with adaptation to high altitude. The c.[12C>G; 380G>C] mutation abrogates hypoxia-induced and HIF-mediated augmentation of erythropoiesis, which provides a molecular mechanism for the observed protection of Tibetans from polycythemia at high altitude."
https://openalex.org/W2083536957,"Epigenetic regulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) ensures lifelong production of blood and bone marrow. Recently, we reported that loss of de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a results in HSC expansion and impaired differentiation. Here, we report conditional inactivation of Dnmt3b in HSCs either alone or combined with Dnmt3a deletion. Combined loss of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b was synergistic, resulting in enhanced HSC self-renewal and a more severe block in differentiation than in Dnmt3a-null cells, whereas loss of Dnmt3b resulted in a mild phenotype. Although the predominant Dnmt3b isoform in adult HSCs is catalytically inactive, its residual activity in Dnmt3a-null HSCs can drive some differentiation and generates paradoxical hypermethylation of CpG islands. Dnmt3a/Dnmt3b-null HSCs displayed activated β-catenin signaling, partly accounting for the differentiation block. These data demonstrate distinct roles for Dnmt3b in HSC differentiation and provide insights into complementary de novo methylation patterns governing regulation of HSC fate decisions."

Although sleep-active GABAergic neurons in the medullary parafacial zone (PZ) are needed for normal SWS, it remains unclear whether these neurons can initiate and maintain SWS or EEG slow-wave activity (SWA) in behaving mice. We used genetically targeted activation and optogenetically based mapping to examine the downstream circuitry engaged by SWS-promoting PZ neurons, and we found that this circuit uniquely and potently initiated SWS and EEG SWA, regardless of the time of day. PZ neurons monosynaptically innervated and released synaptic GABA onto parabrachial neurons, which in turn projected to and released synaptic glutamate onto cortically projecting neurons of the magnocellular basal forebrain; thus, there is a circuit substrate through which GABAergic PZ neurons can potently trigger SWS and modulate the cortical EEG."

Each species of the malaria parasite Plasmodium contains at least one reticulocyte-binding protein homologue (RH) protein, which together with erythrocyte binding-like proteins plays a part in erythrocyte invasion, a key step in the parasites' life cycle. The reticulocyte-binding protein homologue 5 (PfRH5) of P. falciparum interacts with the erythrocyte surface protein basigin and has been identified as a promising vaccine candidate. Here Matthew Higgins and colleagues describe the X-ray crystallographic structure of PfRH5 in complex with basigin and also with inhibitory antibodies. The structure reveals a fold with a kite-like architecture with binding sites for basigin and the antibodies at one tip. Invasion of host erythrocytes is essential to the life cycle of Plasmodium parasites and development of the pathology of malaria. The stages of erythrocyte invasion, including initial contact, apical reorientation, junction formation, and active invagination, are directed by coordinated release of specialized apical organelles and their parasite protein contents1. Among these proteins, and central to invasion by all species, are two parasite protein families, the reticulocyte-binding protein homologue (RH) and erythrocyte-binding like proteins, which mediate host–parasite interactions2. RH5 from Plasmodium falciparum (PfRH5) is the only member of either family demonstrated to be necessary for erythrocyte invasion in all tested strains, through its interaction with the erythrocyte surface protein basigin (also known as CD147 and EMMPRIN)3,4. Antibodies targeting PfRH5 or basigin efficiently block parasite invasion in vitro4,5,6,7,8,9, making PfRH5 an excellent vaccine candidate. Here we present crystal structures of PfRH5 in complex with basigin and two distinct inhibitory antibodies. PfRH5 adopts a novel fold in which two three-helical bundles come together in a kite-like architecture, presenting binding sites for basigin and inhibitory antibodies at one tip. This provides the first structural insight into erythrocyte binding by the Plasmodium RH protein family and identifies novel inhibitory epitopes to guide design of a new generation of vaccines against the blood-stage parasite."

Developmental manipulations yielding adult deficits in rodents provide an opportunity to explore mechanisms involved in a delayed emergence of anomalies driven by developmental alterations. Here we assessed whether oxidative stress during presymptomatic stages causes adult anomalies in rats with a neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion, a developmental rodent model useful for schizophrenia research. Juvenile and adolescent treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine prevented the reduction of prefrontal parvalbumin interneuron activity observed in this model, as well as electrophysiological and behavioral deficits relevant to schizophrenia. Adolescent treatment with the glutathione peroxidase mimic ebselen also reversed behavioral deficits in this animal model. These findings suggest that presymptomatic oxidative stress yields abnormal adult brain function in a developmentally compromised brain, and highlight redox modulation as a potential target for early intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1970710691,"The discovery of two stable peaks at frequencies with a ratio of 3:2 in the power spectrum of X-ray emission from the brightest X-ray source in galaxy M82 suggests that, if the relationship between frequency and mass that holds for stellar-mass black holes can be extended to intermediate masses, the black hole believed to be the source of the emission has a mass approximately 400 times that of the Sun. Stable oscillations in the X-ray emissions of stellar-mass black holes correlate closely with black hole mass. Dheeraj Pasham et al. use this relationship to calculate the mass of the brightest X-ray source in the nearby starburst galaxy M82, thought to be an intermediate-mass black hole. Previous estimates were based on scaling relations with large intrinsic uncertainties that even allowed for a stellar-mass black hole. The new figure is around 428 solar masses — or alternatively about 415 plus or minus 63 solar masses based on a relativistic precession model. These findings confirm that the millihertz quasi-periodic oscillations of M82 X-1 are from an intermediate-mass black hole. M82 X-1, the brightest X-ray source in the galaxy M82, has been thought to be an intermediate-mass black hole (100 to 10,000 solar masses) because of its extremely high luminosity and variability characteristics1,2,3,4,5,6, although some models suggest that its mass may be only about 20 solar masses3,7. The previous mass estimates were based on scaling relations that use low-frequency characteristic timescales which have large intrinsic uncertainties8,9. For stellar-mass black holes, we know that the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (100–450 hertz) in the X-ray emission that occur in a 3:2 frequency ratio are stable and scale in frequency inversely with black hole mass with a reasonably small dispersion10,11,12,13,14,15. The discovery of such stable oscillations thus potentially offers an alternative and less ambiguous means of mass determination for intermediate-mass black holes, but has hitherto not been realized. Here we report stable, twin-peak (3:2 frequency ratio) X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations from M82 X-1 at frequencies of 3.32 ± 0.06 hertz and 5.07 ± 0.06 hertz. Assuming that we can extrapolate the inverse-mass scaling that holds for stellar-mass black holes, we estimate the black hole mass of M82 X-1 to be 428 ± 105 solar masses. In addition, we can estimate the mass using the relativistic precession model, from which we get a value of 415 ± 63 solar masses."

Despite the prevalence of cyclic dinucleotide signaling in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic kingdoms of life, it remains to be proven whether a direct connection exists between the signaling machinery that produces or responds to dinucleotides in either kingdom.

By contrast, the mammalian cGAS enzyme functions with a single active site, using a sequential series of reactions to produce a mixed dinucleotide species G[2ʹ–5ʹ]pA[3ʹ–5ʹ]p (cGAMP) containing a 2ʹ–5ʹ phosphodiester bond (Ablasser et al., 2013Ablasser A.

The requirement for a mixed dinucleotide potentially drove evolution of human cGAS to rely on a single active site and sequential enzymatic reactions. However, the prokaryotic Vibrio DncV enzyme also produces a mixed-base 3ʹ–5ʹ cGAMP molecule (Ablasser et al., 2013Ablasser A. Goldeck M. Cavlar T. Deimling T. Witte G. Röhl I. Hopfner K.P. Ludwig J.

We reasoned that investigation of the molecular mechanism of Vibrio DncV would reveal how enzymes that synthesize mixed cyclic dinucleotides evolved in the prokaryotic kingdom. Such insights could in turn provide a new framework to understand the distinct ability of human cGAS to catalyze the 2ʹ–5ʹ linkage specificity that is critical to innate immune signaling. Here, we present a series of structures of Vibrio cholerae DncV, capturing the enzyme in substrate bound and catalytically trapped linear-intermediate states. In spite of the minimal sequence identity, our results show that DncV is both a structural and functional homolog of mammalian cGAS, demonstrating for the first time a direct connection between the biosynthetic machinery for generating dinucleotide signals in multiple kingdoms of life. Although the active site shares a common architecture between DncV and cGAS, we establish that the sequential enzymatic reactions proceed in opposite directions, with DncV using a 5ʹ pppA[3ʹ–5ʹ]pG intermediate and cGAS a 5ʹ pppG[2ʹ–5ʹ]pA intermediate. By comparing the two enzymes, we derive a model that explains how single active site cyclases control phosphodiester linkage specificity and how human cGAS rotates the substrate nucleotides to produce the 2ʹ–5ʹ linkage unique to mammalian innate immunity. This model allowed us to rationally redesign the human cGAS active site for production of enzymatic variants that now synthesize 3ʹ–5ʹ linked species. These results provide an evolutionary connection between prokaryotic and eukaryotic signaling systems and elucidate enzymatic plasticity that allowed evolution of a unique metazoan innate immune molecule. We isolated a near-full-length construct of Vibrio cholerae DncV (M4–L414) that retains full enzymatic activity and determined its 3.0 Å resolution crystal structure. Selenomethionine derivatized crystals were used for phase determination, and model refinement was additionally improved by a higher-resolution catalytically trapped intermediate structure (discussed below; Table S1 available online). The core of DncV adopts a template-independent nucleotidyl-transferase fold defined by β strands β2–5, similar to the originally characterized CCA-adding enzyme (Figure 1) (Xiong and Steitz, 2004Xiong Y. Steitz T.A. Mechanism of transfer RNA maturation by CCA-adding enzyme without using an oligonucleotide template.Nature. 2004; 430: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In spite of minimal sequence identity (∼10%), the overall structure of DncV is remarkably similar to that of human cGAS (Figures 1B and S1) (Kato et al., 2013Kato K. Ishii R. Goto E. Ishitani R.

The structure of Vibrio DncV reveals an autoactivated state, explaining why DncV is constitutively active, whereas cGAS requires stimulation by dsDNA binding. Although the overall fold of the core active site is shared, two unique features maintain constitutive activity of DncV. First, whereas dsDNA binding is required to configure the cGAS active site for competent metal ion coordination (Civril et al., 2013Civril F. Deimling T. de Oliveira Mann C.C. Ablasser A. Moldt M.

In agreement with automatic positioning, the orientations of DncV D132, D134, and D194 do not change between our apo and substrate bound or catalytically trapped structures (discussed below). Second, regulatory loops that restrict the substrate channel of cGAS (Gao et al., 2013aGao P. Ascano M. Wu Y. Barchet W. Gaffney B.L. Zillinger T. Serganov A.A. Liu Y. Jones R.A. Hartmann G. et al.Cyclic [G(2′,5′)pA(3′,5′)p] is the metazoan second messenger produced by DNA-activated cyclic GMP-AMP synthase.Cell. 2013; 153: 1094-1107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) are missing in the DncV enzyme, resulting in an open active site permanently competent for substrate binding (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1). Recent structural studies have suggested that complete activation of cGAS requires protein dimerization (Li et al., 2013aLi X. Shu C. Yi G. Chaton C.T. Shelton C.L. Diao J. Zuo X. Kao C.C. Herr A.B.

We noted that purified DncV behaves as a monomeric species, and there is no indication of functional dimerization within or between neighboring asymmetric units of the crystals (Figure S2). In addition to remodeling that maintains an open and competent active site, these results demonstrate that DncV lacks regulatory dimerization contacts observed in eukaryotic cGAS and conventional bacterial dinucleotide cyclases (De et al., 2008De N.

DncV does not require dsDNA binding to stimulate enzymatic activity, and we therefore expected the basic DNA recognition cleft found in cGAS to be absent. Strikingly, however, DncV retains a long basic cleft with conserved residues along the same face of the enzyme (Figures 1D and S1). Superposition of the mouse cGAS-DNA-bound structure immediately positions the dsDNA along this cleft without a need for manual docking (Figure 1D). We therefore tested the impact of DNA and RNA on DncV activity but saw no change in enzymatic behavior or mobility of DncV in electrophoretic gel-shift assays (Figure S3). The possible role of this cleft in DncV biology and Vibrio pathogenicity remains an ongoing area of investigation. We next compared the nucleotide substrate preferences of Vibrio DncV and human cGAS enzymes. As expected, enhanced product formation for each enzyme was observed in the presence of ATP and GTP (Figure 2A). We confirmed previous studies (Davies et al., 2012Davies B.W. Bogard R.W. Young T.S.

Promiscuity of the active site for nucleotide selection is shared with human cGAS, which also inefficiently synthesizes both cdA and cdG species when presented with ATP or GTP alone (Figure 2A). Previous results with purified mouse cGAS were unable to detect cdA formation (Gao et al., 2013aGao P. Ascano M. Wu Y. Barchet W. Gaffney B.L. Zillinger T. Serganov A.A. Liu Y. Jones R.A. Hartmann G. et al.Cyclic [G(2′,5′)pA(3′,5′)p] is the metazoan second messenger produced by DNA-activated cyclic GMP-AMP synthase.Cell. 2013; 153: 1094-1107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Low levels of human cGAS cdA formation may therefore indicate further differences between the human and mouse homologs in addition to variation in dependency of DNA-stimulated activation requirements (Kranzusch et al., 2013Kranzusch P.J. Lee A.S. Berger J.M. Doudna J.A.

To ascertain the molecular basis of initial substrate selection, we determined the crystal structure of DncV bound to a nonhydrolyzable nucleotide in which a methylene bridge replaces the ɑ/β bridging oxygen (Apcpp or Gpcpp). The first step in cGAS product formation involves coordination of the adenosine triphosphate for 2ʹ hydroxyl attack by the guanosine ribose (Gao et al., 2013aGao P. Ascano M. Wu Y. Barchet W. Gaffney B.L. Zillinger T. Serganov A.A. Liu Y. Jones R.A. Hartmann G. et al.Cyclic [G(2′,5′)pA(3′,5′)p] is the metazoan second messenger produced by DNA-activated cyclic GMP-AMP synthase.Cell. 2013; 153: 1094-1107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), but our initial crystallization attempts using an ATP analog failed to reveal difference density compared to the apo DncV structure. We therefore used the GTP analog and, in this case, obtained crystals with strong difference density for nucleotide, allowing us to determine the structure of DncV bound to Gpcpp analog at 2.8 Å resolution (Figure 2B). The bound GTP analog adopts an anti base configuration and follows a similar path to the adenosine nucleotide residing in the phosphate-donor pocket observed in the catalytically inactive structure of the pig cGAS (E200Q/D202N) enzyme (Figure 2C) (Civril et al., 2013Civril F. Deimling T. de Oliveira Mann C.C. Ablasser A. Moldt M. Witte G. Hornung V. Hopfner K.P. Structural mechanism of cytosolic DNA sensing by cGAS.Nature. 2013; 498: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). GTP is coordinated by base-specific hydrogen-bonding interactions between amino acid D349 and the guanine N1 and N2 positions along the Watson-Crick edge, whereas bridging interactions between two bound divalent cations connect the triphosphate moiety and the conserved DncV catalytic triad D132, D134, and D194 (Figures 2D–2G). DncV crystallization conditions require high magnesium concentrations, and the observed octahedral geometry of the bound metal ions (as seen in our higher-resolution 1.8 Å catalytically trapped structure) is consistent with magnesium ion coordination (Figures 2E and 2F). In contrast to structures of cGAS, the base stacking interaction between human cGAS Y436 and bound nucleotides is notably absent in DncV. Instead, the tyrosine residue is replaced by I303 that retains active site pocket hydrophobicity but prevents stabilization of particular base orientation (Figures 2D and 2G). We next crystallized DncV in the presence of combinations of ATP/GTP and nonhydrolyzable Apcpp/Gpcpp analogs. Difference density was obtained for crystals of DncV with GTP and Apcpp, and we determined the 1.8 Å resolution structure of this complex (Figure 3A). Unexpectedly, the electron density can clearly be traced for unambiguous assignment of a bound linear dinucleotide intermediate pp(c)pA[3ʹ–5ʹ]pG, implying that the first step in DncV nucleotide cyclization occurs through adenosine 3ʹ hydroxyl attack of the guanosine α-phosphate (Figure 3B). In this structure, the guanine and adenine bases adopt anti and syn base configurations, respectively. This observation suggests that the DncV reaction proceeds through a pppA(syn)[3ʹ–5ʹ]pG(anti) state similar to the mouse cGAS pppG(syn)[2ʹ–5ʹ]pG(anti) structure, where the second nucleotide to be hydrolyzed must pass through a syn conformation en route to product cyclization (Gao et al., 2013aGao P. Ascano M. Wu Y. Barchet W. Gaffney B.L. Zillinger T. Serganov A.A. Liu Y. Jones R.A. Hartmann G. et al.Cyclic [G(2′,5′)pA(3′,5′)p] is the metazoan second messenger produced by DNA-activated cyclic GMP-AMP synthase.Cell. 2013; 153: 1094-1107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonding interactions occur between Q113 and the guanosine 2ʹ OH, and bridging water interactions between T180 and I303/S302 backbone amines coordinate the guanosine and adenosine riboses, respectively (Figure 3C). Interactions with S115 and Y118, as well as the bridging metal B interactions, stabilize the adenosine triphosphate, and in the linear intermediate state, bridging interactions with metal A further stabilize the connecting A[3ʹ–5ʹ]pG phosphate (Figure 3C). The only interactions with the nucleotide bases occur through the guanine position where S260 and Y198 make contacts with the Watson-Crick edge and Y198 and Q113 contact the Hoogsteen edge (Figur"
https://openalex.org/W2043142240,"The Palaeozoic form-taxon Lobopodia encompasses a diverse range of soft-bodied 'legged worms' known from exceptional fossil deposits. Although lobopodians occupy a deep phylogenetic position within Panarthropoda, a shortage of derived characters obscures their evolutionary relationships with extant phyla (Onychophora, Tardigrada and Euarthropoda). Here we describe a complex feature in the terminal claws of the mid-Cambrian lobopodian Hallucigenia sparsa--their construction from a stack of constituent elements--and demonstrate that equivalent elements make up the jaws and claws of extant Onychophora. A cladistic analysis, informed by developmental data on panarthropod head segmentation, indicates that the stacked sclerite components in these two taxa are homologous-resolving hallucigeniid lobopodians as stem-group onychophorans. The results indicate a sister-group relationship between Tardigrada and Euarthropoda, adding palaeontological support to the neurological and musculoskeletal evidence uniting these disparate clades. These findings elucidate the evolutionary transformations that gave rise to the panarthropod phyla, and expound the lobopodian-like morphology of the ancestral panarthropod."
https://openalex.org/W2072527396,"The X-ray crystal structures of a zinc-ion-transporting P-type ATPase are solved in a zinc-free, phosphoenzyme ‘ground’ state and in a transition state of dephosphorylation, characterizing these transporters of an essential micronutrient that is needed for many biological processes but is cytotoxic when free. Zn2+-transporting P-type ATPases are found in prokaryotes and photosynthetic eukaryotes, where they export potentially toxic free zinc ions from the cell. This paper presents the first crystal structures of a Zn2+-ATPase from the bacterium Shigella sonnei, representing two separate reaction intermediates: the phosphoenzyme ground state and the transition state of dephosphorylation. The overall structures are similar to that reported for a Cu+-transporting P-ATPase, though the metal-binding sites of the two proteins are different. The authors propose that the S. sonnei enzyme resemble sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) and Na+,K+-ATPase. Zinc is an essential micronutrient for all living organisms. It is required for signalling and proper functioning of a range of proteins involved in, for example, DNA binding and enzymatic catalysis1. In prokaryotes and photosynthetic eukaryotes, Zn2+-transporting P-type ATPases of class IB (ZntA) are crucial for cellular redistribution and detoxification of Zn2+ and related elements2,3. Here we present crystal structures representing the phosphoenzyme ground state (E2P) and a dephosphorylation intermediate (E2·Pi) of ZntA from Shigella sonnei, determined at 3.2 Å and 2.7 Å resolution, respectively. The structures reveal a similar fold to Cu+-ATPases, with an amphipathic helix at the membrane interface. A conserved electronegative funnel connects this region to the intramembranous high-affinity ion-binding site and may promote specific uptake of cellular Zn2+ ions by the transporter. The E2P structure displays a wide extracellular release pathway reaching the invariant residues at the high-affinity site, including C392, C394 and D714. The pathway closes in the E2·Pi state, in which D714 interacts with the conserved residue K693, which possibly stimulates Zn2+ release as a built-in counter ion, as has been proposed for H+-ATPases. Indeed, transport studies in liposomes provide experimental support for ZntA activity without counter transport. These findings suggest a mechanistic link between PIB-type Zn2+-ATPases and PIII-type H+-ATPases and at the same time show structural features of the extracellular release pathway that resemble PII-type ATPases such as the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase4,5 (SERCA) and Na+, K+-ATPase6. These findings considerably increase our understanding of zinc transport in cells and represent new possibilities for biotechnology and biomedicine."
https://openalex.org/W1980755914,"Eukaryotic circadian oscillators consist of negative feedback loops that generate endogenous rhythmicities. Natural antisense RNAs are found in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms. Nevertheless, the physiological importance and mode of action of most antisense RNAs are not clear. frequency (frq) encodes a component of the Neurospora core circadian negative feedback loop, which was thought to generate sustained rhythmicity. Transcription of qrf, the long non-coding frq antisense RNA, is induced by light, and its level oscillates in antiphase to frq sense RNA. Here we show that qrf transcription is regulated by both light-dependent and light-independent mechanisms. Light-dependent qrf transcription represses frq expression and regulates clock resetting. Light-independent qrf expression, on the other hand, is required for circadian rhythmicity. frq transcription also inhibits qrf expression and drives the antiphasic rhythm of qrf transcripts. The mutual inhibition of frq and qrf transcription thus forms a double negative feedback loop that is interlocked with the core feedback loop. Genetic and mathematical modelling analyses indicate that such an arrangement is required for robust and sustained circadian rhythmicity. Moreover, our results suggest that antisense transcription inhibits sense expression by mediating chromatin modifications and premature termination of transcription. Taken together, our results establish antisense transcription as an essential feature in a circadian system and shed light on the importance and mechanism of antisense action."

The critical cellular processes and underlying molecular mechanisms that define this malignancy remain poorly understood. Using a syngeneic murine model, we investigated the changes that accompanied the progression to increased aggressiveness induced by in vivo passage of mouse EOC cells. We found that enhanced anoikis resistance was a key cellular process associated with greater aggressiveness and tumorigenicity in vivo. Biochemical studies revealed that the enhanced anoikis resistance was associated with the activation of the Src/Akt/Erk signaling pathway. A higher rate of metabolism and autophagy were also associated with increased anoikis resistance. Blocking these pathways with specific inhibitors and/or genetic modifications significantly increased anoikis in vitro and inhibited tumor development in vivo. In addition, we demonstrated that similar signaling pathways were also involved in a human EOC cell line model. Collectively, our data suggest that anoikis resistance represents a critical and a distinguishing feature underlying the aggressiveness of ovarian cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W1997806336,"It is well established that tumours are not homogenous, but comprise cells with differing invasive, proliferative and tumour-initiating potential. A major challenge in cancer research is therefore to develop methods to characterize cell heterogeneity. In melanoma, proliferative and invasive cells are characterized by distinct gene expression profiles and accumulating evidence suggests that cells can alternate between these states through a process called phenotype switching. We have used microfluidic technology to isolate single melanoma cells grown in vitro as monolayers or melanospheres or in vivo as xenografted tumours and analyse the expression profiles of 114 genes that discriminate the proliferative and invasive states by quantitative PCR. Single-cell analysis accurately recapitulates the specific gene expression programmes of melanoma cell lines and defines subpopulations with distinct expression profiles. Cell heterogeneity is augmented when cells are grown as spheres and as xenografted tumours. Correlative analysis identifies gene-regulatory networks and changes in gene expression under different growth conditions. In tumours, subpopulations of cells that express specific invasion and drug resistance markers can be identified amongst which is the pluripotency factor POUF51 (OCT4) whose expression correlates with the tumorigenic potential. We therefore show that single-cell analysis can be used to define and quantify tumour heterogeneity based on detection of cells with specific gene expression profiles."

Phenolic profiles, antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of twenty-four selected Vitis vinifera grape cultivars were investigated in this study. Large ranges of variation were found in these cultivars for the contents of total phenolics (95.3 to 686.5 mg/100 g) and flavonoids (94.7 to 1055 mg/100 g) and antioxidant activities (oxygen radical absorbance capacity 378.7 to 3386.0 mg of Trolox equivalents/100 g and peroxylradical scavenging capacity14.2 to 557 mg of vitamin C equivalents/100 g), cellular antioxidant activities (3.9 to 139.9 µmol of quercetin equivalents/100 g without PBS wash and 1.4 to 95.8 µmol of quercetin equivalents /100 g with PBS wash) and antiproliferative activities (25 to 82% at the concentrations of 100 mg/mL extracts).The total antioxidant activities were significantly correlated with the total phenolics and flavonoids. However, no significant correlations were found between antiproliferative activities and total phenolics or total flavonoids content. Wine grapes and color grapes showed much higher levels of phytochemicals and antioxidant activities than table grapes and green/yellow grapes. Several germplasm accessions with much high contents of phenolics and flavonoids, and total antioxidant activity were identified. These germplasm can be valuable sources of genes for breeding grape cultivars with better nutritional qualities of wine and table grapes in the future."
https://openalex.org/W1991984239,"Production of eukaryotic proteins in bacteria is limited by the specificity of the bacterial oligosaccharyltransferases that perform N-linked glycosylation. ‘GlycoSNAP’ simplifies the study of these enzymes, leading to mutants with relaxed specificity. The Campylobacter jejuni protein glycosylation locus (pgl) encodes machinery for asparagine-linked (N-linked) glycosylation and serves as the archetype for bacterial N-linked glycosylation. This machinery has been functionally transferred into Escherichia coli, enabling convenient mechanistic dissection of the N-linked glycosylation process in this genetically tractable host. Here we sought to identify sequence determinants in the oligosaccharyltransferase PglB that restrict its specificity to only those glycan acceptor sites containing a negatively charged residue at the −2 position relative to asparagine. This involved creation of a genetic assay, glycosylation of secreted N-linked acceptor proteins (glycoSNAP), that facilitates high-throughput screening of glycophenotypes in E. coli. Using this assay, we isolated several C. jejuni PglB variants that could glycosylate an array of noncanonical acceptor sequences, including one in a eukaryotic N-glycoprotein. These results underscore the utility of glycoSNAP for shedding light on poorly understood aspects of N-linked glycosylation and for engineering designer N-linked glycosylation biocatalysts."
https://openalex.org/W1993897258,"Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) is a key component of the ATR (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related)-dependent DNA damage response pathway that protect cells from replication stress, a cell intrinsic phenomenon enhanced by oncogenic transformation. Here, we show that CHK1 is overexpressed and hyperactivated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). CHEK1 mRNA is highly abundant in patients of the proliferative T-ALL subgroup and leukemia cells exhibit constitutively elevated levels of the replication stress marker phospho-RPA32 and the DNA damage marker γH2AX. Importantly, pharmacologic inhibition of CHK1 using PF-004777736 or CHK1 short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing impairs T-ALL cell proliferation and viability. CHK1 inactivation results in the accumulation of cells with incompletely replicated DNA, ensuing DNA damage, ATM/CHK2 activation and subsequent ATM- and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. In contrast to normal thymocytes, primary T-ALL cells are sensitive to therapeutic doses of PF-004777736, even in the presence of stromal or interleukin-7 survival signals. Moreover, CHK1 inhibition significantly delays in vivo growth of xenotransplanted T-ALL tumors. We conclude that CHK1 is critical for T-ALL proliferation and viability by downmodulating replication stress and preventing ATM/caspase-3-dependent cell death. Pharmacologic inhibition of CHK1 may be a promising therapeutic alternative for T-ALL treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2057749456,"Josef Penninger and colleagues generate mice with conditional knockout of Jagn1 in hematopoietic cells. They show that the mice have a defective neutrophil-mediated immune response to Candida albicans, and GM-CSF treatment restored the defective fungicidal activity. Neutrophils are key innate immune effector cells that are essential to fighting bacterial and fungal pathogens. Here we report that mice carrying a hematopoietic lineage–specific deletion of Jagn1 (encoding Jagunal homolog 1) cannot mount an efficient neutrophil-dependent immune response to the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Global glycobiome analysis identified marked alterations in the glycosylation of proteins involved in cell adhesion and cytotoxicity in Jagn1-deficient neutrophils. Functional analysis confirmed marked defects in neutrophil migration in response to Candida albicans infection and impaired formation of cytotoxic granules, as well as defective myeloperoxidase release and killing of Candida albicans. Treatment with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) protected mutant mice from increased weight loss and accelerated mortality after Candida albicans challenge. Notably, GM-CSF also restored the defective fungicidal activity of bone marrow cells from humans with JAGN1 mutations. These data directly identify Jagn1 (JAGN1 in humans) as a new regulator of neutrophil function in microbial pathogenesis and uncover a potential treatment option for humans."
https://openalex.org/W2118772463,"Pertussis is a highly infectious respiratory disease of humans caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. Despite high vaccination coverage, pertussis has re-emerged globally. Causes for the re-emergence of pertussis include limited duration of protection conferred by acellular pertussis vaccines (aP) and pathogen adaptation. Pathogen adaptations involve antigenic divergence with vaccine strains, the emergence of strains which show enhanced in vitro expression of a number of virulence-associated genes and of strains that do not express pertactin, an important aP component. Clearly, the identification of more effective B. pertussis vaccine antigens is of utmost importance. To identify novel antigens, we used proteomics to identify B. pertussis proteins regulated by the master virulence regulatory system BvgAS in vitro. Five candidates proteins were selected and it was confirmed that they were also expressed in the lungs of naïve mice seven days after infection. The five proteins were expressed in recombinant form, adjuvanted with alum and used to immunize mice as stand-alone antigens. Subsequent respiratory challenge showed that immunization with the autotransporters Vag8 and SphB1 significantly reduced bacterial load in the lungs. Whilst these antigens induced strong opsonizing antibody responses, we found that none of the tested alum-adjuvanted vaccines - including a three-component aP - reduced bacterial load in the nasopharynx, suggesting that alternative immunological responses may be required for efficient bacterial clearance from the nasopharynx."
https://openalex.org/W1992538563,"The matricellular protein CCN5/WISP-2 represents a promising target in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) because treatment or induced activation of CCN5 in TNBC cells promotes cell growth arrest at the G0/G1 phase, reduces cell proliferation and delays tumor growth in the xenograft model. Our studies found that the p27Kip1 tumor suppressor protein is upregulated and relocalized to the nucleus from cytoplasm by CCN5 in these cells and that these two events (upregulation and relocalization of p27Kip1) are critical for CCN5-induced growth inhibition of TNBC cells. In the absence of CCN5, p27Kip1 resides mostly in the cytoplasm, which is associated with the aggressive nature of cancer cells. Mechanistically, CCN5 inhibits Skp2 expression, which seems to stabilize the p27Kip1 protein in these cells. On the other hand, CCN5 also recruits FOXO3a to mediate the transcriptional regulation of p27Kip1. The recruitment of FOXO3a is achieved by the induction of its expression and activity through shifting from cytoplasm to the nucleus. Our data indicate that CCN5 blocks PI3K/AKT signaling to dephosphorylate at S318, S253 and Thr32 in FOXO3a for nuclear relocalization and activation of FOXO3a. Moreover, inhibition of α6β1 receptors diminishes CCN5 action on p27Kip1 in TNBC cells. Collectively, these data suggest that CCN5 effectively inhibits TNBC growth through the accumulation and trafficking of p27Kip1 via Skp2 and FOXO3a regulation, and thus, activation of CCN5 may have the therapeutic potential to kill TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W1984763444,"Ovarian cancer is the first in mortalities among gynecologic cancers in the United States, often due to late diagnosis and/or acquired platinum-resistant recurrences. This study investigates whether BRCA1-IRIS is a novel treatment target for ovarian cancers and in platinum-resistant recurrences. Here we show that more than half of the ovarian cancer samples analyzed showed BRCA1-IRIS and survivin overexpression and lacked nuclear FOXO3a expression. Normal ovarian epithelial cells overexpressing BRCA1-IRIS formed metastasis in mice when injected in the peritoneal cavity, whereas aggressive ovarian cancer cell lines failed to form tumors or metastases in mice when BRCA1-IRIS was silenced in them. We show that BRCA1-IRIS activates two autocrine signaling loops, brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tyrosine kinase B receptor (BDNF/TrkB) and neuregulin 1 (NRG1)/ErbB2. These loops are involved in anoikis resistance and metastasis promotion. These loops operate in several ovarian cancer cell lines, and BRCA1-IRIS silencing or inactivation using a novel inhibitory peptide renders both non-functional and promoted cell death. In a mouse xenograft model, BRCA1-IRIS inactivation using this novel inhibitory peptide resulted in significant reduction in ovarian tumor growth. More importantly, this treatment sensitized ovarian tumors to low cisplatin concentrations. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that BRCA1-IRIS and/or BDNF/TrkB and NRG1/ErbB2 could serve as rational therapeutic targets for advanced ovarian cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2065326565,"The effect of pyridostigmine (PYR)--an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor--on hemodynamics and cardiac autonomic control, was never studied in conscious myocardial infarcted mice. Telemetry transmitters were implanted into the carotid artery under isoflurane anesthesia. Seven to ten days after recovery from the surgery, basal arterial pressure and heart rate were recorded, while parasympathetic and sympathetic tone (ΔHR) was evaluated by means of methyl atropine and propranolol. After the basal hemodynamic recording the mice were subjected to left coronary artery ligation for producing myocardial infarction (MI), or sham operation, and implantation of minipumps filled with PYR or saline. Separate groups of anesthetized (isoflurane) mice previously (4 weeks) subjected to MI, or sham coronary artery ligation, were submitted to cardiac function examination. The mice exhibited an infarct length of approximately 12%, no change in arterial pressure and increased heart rate only in the 1st week after MI. Vagal tone decreased in the 1st week, while the sympathetic tone was increased in the 1st and 4th week after MI. PYR prevented the increase in heart rate but did not affect the arterial pressure. Moreover, PYR prevented the increase in sympathetic tone throughout the 4 weeks. Concerning the parasympathetic tone, PYR not only impaired its attenuation in the 1st week, but enhanced it in the 4th week. MI decreased ejection fraction and increased diastolic and systolic volume. Therefore, the pharmacological increase of peripheral acetylcholine availability by means of PYR prevented tachycardia, increased parasympathetic and decreased sympathetic tone after MI in mice."

https://openalex.org/W2063138262,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric tumor of neural crest origin with heterogeneous phenotypes. Although low-stage tumors carry a favorable prognosis, >50% of high-risk NB relapses after treatment with a fatal outcome. Thus developing therapies targeting refractory NB remains an unsolved clinical problem. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its TrkB receptor are known to protect NB cells from chemotherapy-induced cell death, while neuropeptide Y (NPY), acting via its Y2 receptor (Y2R), is an autocrine proliferative and angiogenic factor crucial for maintaining NB tumor growth. Here we show that in NB cells, BDNF stimulates the synthesis of NPY and induces expression of another one of its receptors, Y5R. In human NB tissues, the expression of NPY and Y5R positively correlated with the expression of BDNF and TrkB. Functionally, BDNF triggered Y5R internalization in NB cells, whereas Y5R antagonist inhibited BDNF-induced p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and its pro-survival activity. These observations suggested TrkB-Y5R transactivation that resulted in cross-talk between their signaling pathways. Additionally, NPY and Y5R were upregulated in a BDNF-independent manner in NB cells under pro-apoptotic conditions, such as serum deprivation and chemotherapy, as well as in cell lines and tissues derived from posttreatment NB tumors. Blocking Y5R in chemoresistant NB cells rich in this receptor sensitized them to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and inhibited their growth in vivo by augmenting cell death. In summary, the NPY/Y5R axis is an inducible survival pathway activated in NB by BDNF or cellular stress. Upon such activation, Y5R augments the pro-survival effect of BDNF via its interactions with TrkB receptor and exerts an additional BDNF-independent anti-apoptotic effect, both of which contribute to NB chemoresistance. Therefore, the NPY/Y5R pathway may become a novel therapeutic target for patients with refractory NB, thus far an incurable form of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2091669222,"Hepatocarcinogenesis results from the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes in liver cells. A common mechanism through which these alterations induce liver cancer is by deregulating signaling pathways. A number of signaling pathways, including the PI3K/PTEN/AKT and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathways have been implicated in normal liver development as well as in cancer formation. In this study, we assessed the effect of the TGF-β signaling pathway on liver tumors induced by phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) loss. Inactivation of only the TGF-β receptor type II, Tgfbr2, in the mouse liver (Tgfbr2LKO) had no overt phenotype, while inactivation of Pten alone (PtenLKO), resulted in the formation of both hepatocellular carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas (CC). Interestingly, deletion of both Pten and Tgfbr2 (PtenLKO;Tgfbr2LKO) in the mouse liver resulted in a dramatic shift in tumor type to predominantly CC. Assessment of the PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway revealed increased phosphorylation of AKT and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) in both the PtenLKO and PtenLKO;Tgfbr2LKO mice, suggesting that this pathway is constitutively active regardless of the status of the TGF-β signaling pathway. However, phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase was observed in the liver of all three phenotypes (Tgfbr2LKO, PtenLKO, PtenLKO;Tgfbr2LKO) indicating that the loss of Tgfbr2 and/or Pten leads to an increase in this signaling pathway. Analysis of markers of liver progenitor/stem cells revealed that the loss of TGF-β signaling resulted in increased expression of c-Kit and CD133. Furthermore, in addition to increased c-Kit and CD133, Scf and EpCam expression were also increased in the double knock-out mice. These results suggest that the alteration in tumor types between the PtenLKO mice and PtenLKO;Tgfbr2LKO mice is secondary to the altered regulation of stem-cell features induced by the loss of TGF-β signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2090837102,"MLL (myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia) rearrangements are frequent in therapy-related and childhood acute leukemia, and are associated with poor prognosis. The majority of the rearrangements fall within a 7.3-kb MLL breakpoint cluster region (MLLbcr), particularly in a 0.4-kb hotspot at the intron11-exon12 boundary. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, though multiple pathways including early apoptotic signaling, accompanied by high-order DNA fragmentation, have been implicated. We introduced the MLLbcr hotspot in an EGFP-based recombination reporter system and demonstrated enhancement of both spontaneous and genotoxic treatment-induced DNA recombination by the MLLbcr in various human cell types. We identified Endonuclease G (EndoG), an apoptotic nuclease, as an essential factor for MLLbcr-specific DNA recombination after induction of replication stress. We provide evidence for replication stress-induced nuclear accumulation of EndoG, DNA binding by EndoG as well as cleavage of the chromosomal MLLbcr locus in a manner requiring EndoG. We demonstrate additional dependency of MLLbcr breakage on ATM signaling to histone H2B monoubiquitinase RNF20, involved in chromatin relaxation. Altogether our findings provide a novel mechanism underlying MLLbcr destabilization in the cells of origin of leukemogenesis, with replication stress-activated, EndoG-mediated cleavage at the MLLbcr, which may serve resolution of the stalled forks via recombination repair, however, also permits MLL rearrangements."
https://openalex.org/W1970956438,"DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are extremely deleterious lesions that are repaired by homologous recombination (HR) through coordination of Fanconi anemia (FA) proteins and breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) product, but the exact role these proteins have remains unclear. Here we report that FANCG was modified by the addition of lysine63-linked polyubiquitin chains (K63Ub) in response to DNA damage. We show that FANCG K63Ub was dispensable for monoubiquitination of FANCD2, but was required for FANCG to interact with the Rap80-BRCA1 (receptor-associated protein 80-BRCA1) complex for subsequent modulation of HR repair of ICLs induced by mitomycin C. Mutation of three lysine residues within FANCG to arginine (K182, K258 and K347, 3KR) reduced FANCG K63Ub modification, as well as its interaction with the Rap80-BRCA1 complex, and therefore impeded HR repair. In addition, we demonstrated that K63Ub-modified FANCG was deubiquitinated by BRCC36 complex in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of BRCC36 resulted in increased K63Ub modification of FANCG. Taken together, our results identify a new role of FANCG in HR repair of ICL through K63Ub-mediated interaction with the Rap80-BRCA1 complex."

This paper introduces a method for assigning a set of short DNA reads to a reference genome, under Local Rank Distance (LRD). The rank-based aligner proposed in this work aims to improve correctness over speed. However, some indexing strategies to speed up the aligner are also investigated. The LRD aligner is improved in terms of speed by storing -mer positions in a hash table for each read. Another improvement, that produces an approximate LRD aligner, is to consider only the positions in the reference that are likely to represent a good positional match of the read. The proposed aligner is evaluated and compared to other state of the art alignment tools in several experiments. A set of experiments are conducted to determine the precision and the recall of the proposed aligner, in the presence of contaminated reads. In another set of experiments, the proposed aligner is used to find the order, the family, or the species of a new (or unknown) organism, given only a set of short Next-Generation Sequencing DNA reads. The empirical results show that the aligner proposed in this work is highly accurate from a biological point of view. Compared to the other evaluated tools, the LRD aligner has the important advantage of being very accurate even for a very low base coverage. Thus, the LRD aligner can be considered as a good alternative to standard alignment tools, especially when the accuracy of the aligner is of high importance. Source code and UNIX binaries of the aligner are freely available for future development and use at http://lrd.herokuapp.com/aligners.

However, the pharmacokinetics of piperaquine and the relationship between drug levels and clinical efficacy are incompletely characterized, particularly in children.We performed a single-arm open-label trial in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. A total of 379 participants aged 6 months or more with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were enrolled. Each participant received daily dose of DHA-PQ for three days and followed for 42 days. Parasitological efficacy was analyzed, considering rates of recrudescence and overall recurrence. PK was an exploratory endpoint and a priori, no sample size had been determined. Day 7 capillary and venous plasma concentrations of piperaquine were measured in children aged 2-10 years.Of the 379 participants, 365 (96.3%) completed 42 days of follow-up. The median daily dose of PQ was 18.5 mg/kg [6.5-24]. Treatment with DHA-PQ was well tolerated with fever and parasitemia resolution within 48 hours in nearly all children. Recurrent malaria within 42 days of follow-up occurred in 31.3% (10/34) of children less than 2 years old, 16.0% (16/106) of those aged 2-5 years, 9.4% (15/160) of those aged 5-10 years, and none (0/68) of those over 10 years old. After genotyping, 3 of 41 recurrent episodes were recrudescence. An exploratory analysis shows that children with successful treatment outcomes had significantly higher median plasma concentrations of PQ compared to those with recurrent malaria within 42 days after therapy, considering either capillary samples (68 ng/ml [50-85] compared to 48 ng/ml [36-55], p<0.001) or venous samples (42 ng/ml [29-59] compared to 25 ng/ml [19-44], p<0.001).DHA-PQ was effective for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria treatment and offers an alternative to other ACTs.

https://openalex.org/W1972430027,"IFN-γ is a signature Th1 cell associated cytokine critical for the inflammatory response in autoimmunity with both pro-inflammatory and potentially protective functions. IL-17A is the hallmark of T helper 17 (Th17) cell subsets, produced by γδT, CD8+ T, NK and NKT cells. We have taken advantage of our colony of IL-2Rα-/- mice that spontaneously develop both autoimmune cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease. In this model CD8+ T cells mediate biliary ductular damage, whereas CD4+ T cells mediate induction of colon-specific autoimmunity. Importantly, IL-2Rα-/- mice have high levels of interferon γ (IFN-γ), and interleukin-17A (IL-17A). We produced unique double deletions of mice that were either IL-17A-/-IL-2Rα-/- or IFN-γ-/-IL-2Rα-/- to specifically address the precise role of these two cytokines in the natural history of autoimmune cholangitis and colitis. Of note, deletion of IL-17A in IL-2Rα-/- mice led to more severe liver inflammation, but ameliorated colitis. In contrast, there were no significant changes in the immunopathology of double knock-out IFN-γ-/- IL-2Rα-/- mice, compared to single knock-out IL-2Rα-/- mice with respect to cholangitis or colitis. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in pathogenetic CD8+ T cells in the liver of IL-17A-/-IL-2Rα-/- mice. Our data suggest that while IL-17A plays a protective role in autoimmune cholangitis, it has a pro-inflammatory role in inflammatory bowel disease. These data take on particular significance in the potential use of anti-IL-17A therapy in humans with primary biliary cirrhosis."

Recent studies revealed that regulatory T cells (Tregs), hepatic satellite cells and Kupffer cells play a potential role in spontaneous immune tolerance, however the precise mechanism of spontaneous immune tolerance is still undefined. By using Microarray Chips, we investigated different immune regulatory factors to decipher critical mechanisms of spontaneous tolerance after mouse liver transplantation. Allogeneic (C57BL/6-C3H) and syngeneic (C3H-C3H) liver transplantation were performed by 6-8 weeks old male C57BL/6 and C3H mice. Graft samples (N = 4 each group) were collected from 8 weeks post-operation mice. 11 differentially expressed miRNAs in allogeneic grafts (Allografts) vs. syngeneic grafts (Syngrafts) were identified using Agilent Mouse miRNA Chips. It was revealed that 185 genes were modified by the 11 miRNAs, furthermore, within the 185 target genes, 11 of them were tightly correlated with immune regulation after Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis and Genbank data cross-comparison. Verified by real-time PCR and western blot, our results indicated that mRNA expression levels of IL-6 and TAB2 were respectively down regulated following miR-142-3p and miR-155 augment. In addition, increased miR-152 just silenced mRNA of CaMK II and down-regulated translation of CaMK II in tolerated liver grafts, which may play a critical role in immune regulation and spontaneous tolerance induction of mouse liver transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2023771562,"Mitotic proteins are attractive targets to develop molecular cancer therapeutics due to the intimate interdependence between cell proliferation and mitosis. In this work, we have explored the therapeutic potential of the kinetochore (KT) protein Hec1 (Highly Expressed in Cancer protein 1) as a molecular target to produce massive chromosome missegregation and cell death in cancer cells. Hec1 is a constituent of the Ndc80 complex, which mediates KT–microtubule (MT) attachments at mitosis and is upregulated in various cancer types. We expressed Hec1 fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) at its N-terminus MT-interaction domain in HeLa cells and showed that expression of this modified Hec1, which localized at KTs, blocked cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in tumour cells. EGFP-Hec1 was extremely potent in tumour cell killing and more efficient than siRNA-induced Hec1 depletion. In striking contrast, normal cells showed no apparent cell proliferation defects or cell death following EGFP-Hec1 expression. Live-cell imaging demonstrated that cancer cell death was associated with massive chromosome missegregation within multipolar spindles after a prolonged mitotic arrest. Moreover, EGFP-Hec1 expression was found to increase KT–MT attachment stability, providing a molecular explanation for the abnormal spindle architecture and the cytotoxic activity of this modified protein. Consistent with cell culture data, EGFP-Hec1 expression was found to strongly inhibit tumour growth in a mouse xenograft model by disrupting mitosis and inducing multipolar spindles. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that stimulation of massive chromosome segregation defects can be used as an anti-cancer strategy through the activation of mitotic catastrophe after a multipolar mitosis. Importantly, this study represents a clear proof of concept that targeting KT proteins required for proper KT–MT attachment dynamics constitutes a powerful approach in cancer therapy."

We analysed the transcriptional responses of the nitrogen fixing plant symbiont, Rhizobium leguminosarum bv viciae 3841 to salicylic acid. Two MFS-type multicomponent efflux systems were induced in response to salicylic acid, rmrAB and the hitherto undescribed system salRAB. Based on sequence similarity salA and salB encode a membrane fusion and inner membrane protein respectively. salAB are positively regulated by the LysR regulator SalR. Disruption of salA significantly increased the sensitivity of the mutant to salicylic acid, while disruption of rmrA did not. A salA/rmrA double mutation did not have increased sensitivity relative to the salA mutant. Pea plants nodulated by salA or rmrA strains did not have altered nodule number or nitrogen fixation rates, consistent with weak expression of salA in the rhizosphere and in nodule bacteria. However, BLAST analysis revealed seventeen putative efflux systems in Rlv3841 and several of these were highly differentially expressed during rhizosphere colonisation, host infection and bacteroid differentiation. This suggests they have an integral role in symbiosis with host plants."
https://openalex.org/W2017602711,"Topoisomerase inhibitors are in common use as chemotherapeutic agents although they can display reduced efficacy in chemotherapy-resistant tumours, which have inactivated DNA damage response (DDR) genes, such as ATM and TP53. Here, we characterise the cellular response to the dual-acting agent, Alchemix (ALX), which is a modified anthraquinone that functions as a topoisomerase inhibitor as well as an alkylating agent. We show that ALX induces a robust DDR at nano-molar concentrations and this is mediated primarily through ATR- and DNA-PK- but not ATM-dependent pathways, despite DNA double strand breaks being generated after prolonged exposure to the drug. Interestingly, exposure of epithelial tumour cell lines to ALX in vitro resulted in potent activation of the G2/M checkpoint, which after a prolonged arrest, was bypassed allowing cells to progress into mitosis where they ultimately died by mitotic catastrophe. We also observed effective killing of lymphoid tumour cell lines in vitro following exposure to ALX, although, in contrast, this tended to occur via activation of a p53-independent apoptotic pathway. Lastly, we validate the effectiveness of ALX as a chemotherapeutic agent in vivo by demonstrating its ability to cause a significant reduction in tumour cell growth, irrespective of TP53 status, using a mouse leukaemia xenograft model. Taken together, these data demonstrate that ALX, through its dual action as an alkylating agent and topoisomerase inhibitor, represents a novel anti-cancer agent that could be potentially used clinically to treat refractory or relapsed tumours, particularly those harbouring mutations in DDR genes."
https://openalex.org/W2078550985,"Biomolecules have been widely investigated as potential therapeutics for various diseases. However their use is limited due to rapid degradation and poor cellular uptake in vitro and in vivo. To address this issue, we synthesized a new nano-carrier system comprising of cholic acid-polyethylenimine (CA-PEI) copolymer micelles, via carbodiimide-mediated coupling for the efficient delivery of small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as model protein. The mean particle size of siRNA- or BSA-loaded CA-PEI micelles ranged from 100–150 nm, with zeta potentials of +3-+11 mV, respectively. Atomic force, transmission electron and field emission scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that the micelles exhibited excellent spherical morphology. No significant morphology or size changes were observed in the CA-PEI micelles after siRNA and BSA loading. CA-PEI micelles exhibited sustained release profile, the effective diffusion coefficients were successfully estimated using a mathematically-derived cylindrical diffusion model and the release data of siRNA and BSA closely fitted into this model. High siRNA and BSA binding and loading efficiencies (95% and 70%, respectively) were observed for CA-PEI micelles. Stability studies demonstrated that siRNA and BSA integrity was maintained after loading and release. The CA-PEI micelles were non cytotoxic to V79 and DLD-1 cells, as shown by alamarBlue and LIVE/DEAD cell viability assays. RT-PCR study revealed that siRNA-loaded CA-PEI micelles suppressed the mRNA for ABCB1 gene. These results revealed the promising potential of CA-PEI micelles as a stable, safe, and versatile nano-carrier for siRNA and the model protein delivery."
