https://openalex.org/W2922175568,"We previously reported that inducing gamma oscillations with a non-invasive light flicker (gamma entrainment using sensory stimulus or GENUS) impacted pathology in the visual cortex of Alzheimer's disease mouse models. Here, we designed auditory tone stimulation that drove gamma frequency neural activity in auditory cortex (AC) and hippocampal CA1. Seven days of auditory GENUS improved spatial and recognition memory and reduced amyloid in AC and hippocampus of 5XFAD mice. Changes in activation responses were evident in microglia, astrocytes, and vasculature. Auditory GENUS also reduced phosphorylated tau in the P301S tauopathy model. Furthermore, combined auditory and visual GENUS, but not either alone, produced microglial-clustering responses, and decreased amyloid in medial prefrontal cortex. Whole brain analysis using SHIELD revealed widespread reduction of amyloid plaques throughout neocortex after multi-sensory GENUS. Thus, GENUS can be achieved through multiple sensory modalities with wide-ranging effects across multiple brain areas to improve cognitive function."
https://openalex.org/W2920911307,"SIM1-expressing paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) neurons are key regulators of energy balance. Within the PVHSIM1 population, melanocortin-4 receptor-expressing (PVHMC4R) neurons are known to regulate satiety and bodyweight, yet they account for only half of PVHSIM1 neuron-mediated regulation. Here we report that PVH prodynorphin-expressing (PVHPDYN) neurons, which notably lack MC4Rs, function independently and additively with PVHMC4R neurons to account for the totality of PVHSIM1 neuron-mediated satiety. Moreover, PVHPDYN neurons are necessary for prevention of obesity in an independent but equipotent manner to PVHMC4R neurons. While PVHPDYN and PVHMC4R neurons both project to the parabrachial complex (PB), they synaptically engage distinct efferent nodes, the pre-locus coeruleus (pLC), and central lateral parabrachial nucleus (cLPBN), respectively. PB-projecting PVHPDYN neurons, like PVHMC4R neurons, receive input from interoceptive ARCAgRP neurons, respond to caloric state, and are sufficient and necessary to control food intake. This expands the CNS satiety circuitry to include two non-overlapping PVH to hindbrain circuits."

However, it is unclear whether performance on mobile devices can predict navigation errors in the real world. We compared the performance of 49 participants (25 females, 18-35 years old) at wayfinding and path integration tasks designed in our mobile app ‘Sea Hero Quest’ with their performance at similar tasks in a real-world environment. We first performed this experiment in the streets of London (UK) and replicated it in Paris (France). In both cities, we found a significant correlation between virtual and real-world wayfinding performance and a male advantage in both environments, although smaller in the real world (Cohen’s d in the game = 0.89, in the real world = 0.59). Results in London and Paris were highly similar, and controlling for familiarity with video games did not change the results. The strength of the correlation between real world and virtual environment increased with the difficulty of the virtual wayfinding task, indicating that Sea Hero Quest does not merely capture video gaming skills. The fact that the Sea Hero Quest wayfinding task has real-world ecological validity constitutes a step toward controllable, sensitive, safe, low-cost, and easy to administer digital cognitive assessment of navigation ability."
https://openalex.org/W2922439145,"The diversity of cardiac lineages contributes to the heterogeneity of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs). Here, we report the generation of a hiPSC TBX5Clover2 and NKX2-5TagRFP double reporter to delineate cardiac lineages and isolate lineage-specific subpopulations. Molecular analyses reveal that four different subpopulations can be isolated based on the differential expression of TBX5 and NKX2-5, TBX5+NKX2-5+, TBX5+NKX2-5-, TBX5-NKX2-5+, and TBX5-NKX2-5-, mimicking the first heart field, epicardial, second heart field, and endothelial lineages, respectively. Genetic and functional characterization indicates that each subpopulation differentiates into specific cardiac cells. We further identify CORIN as a cell-surface marker for isolating the TBX5+NKX2-5+ subpopulation and demonstrate the use of lineage-specific CMs for precise drug testing. We anticipate that this tool will facilitate the investigation of cardiac lineage specification and isolation of specific cardiac subpopulations for drug screening, tissue engineering, and disease modeling."

Hematopoiesis provides an ideal model to understand the principles underlying cell fate choices in stem cells (Bresnick et al., 2018Bresnick E.H. Hewitt K.J. Mehta C. Keles S. Paulson R.F.

Recent studies using this system are changing our interpretation of the mechanism underlying cell fate decisions from a “stepwise” model, in which cells are thought to differentiate by jumping from one stable state to the next, to a “continuous” model, in which lineage commitment occurs gradually along divergent trajectories (Laurenti and Göttgens, 2018Laurenti E. Göttgens B. From haematopoietic stem cells to complex differentiation landscapes.Nature. 2018; 553: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, lineage fate decisions have only been analyzed at the level of RNAs encoding lineage-specific transcription factors (LS-TFs) in “snapshots” of populations or individual cells without temporal measurements (Olsson et al., 2016Olsson A.

It is currently not known whether the proteins representing LS-TFs of alternate lineages are co-expressed in single hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) or whether the levels of such proteins change over time as cells differentiate. It therefore remains to be determined whether quantitative changes in the abundance of LS-TF proteins expressed throughout the time course of differentiation play a role in establishing and/or maintaining lineage trajectories. Based on RNA analyses, lineage choice has long been proposed to occur in bipotential progenitors through quantitative changes in the relative levels of LS-TFs (Graf and Enver, 2009Graf T. Enver T.

Although several pairs of LS-TFs have been proposed to mediate cell fate decisions (e.g., GATA1 vs PU.1 at the erythroid vs myeloid branch point; Huang et al., 2007Huang S. Guo Y.P. May G. Enver T.

Haemost. 2015; 114: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), a more recent study, using fluorescently tagged TFs, concluded that LS-TFs associated with alternative cell fates are not co-expressed in hematopoietic progenitors (Hoppe et al., 2016Hoppe P.S. Schwarzfischer M. Loeffler D. Kokkaliaris K.D. Hilsenbeck O. Moritz N. Endele M. Filipczyk A. Gambardella A.

However, endogenous LS-TFs have not been measured at the protein level in single cells, and thus, the question remains whether LS-TFs from alternate lineages are co-expressed in hematopoietic progenitors. Here, we studied changes in the expression of key LS-TFs as HSPCs differentiate along the pathway to erythroid cells using mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF) (Spitzer and Nolan, 2016Spitzer M.H. Nolan G.P. Mass cytometry: single cells, many features.Cell. 2016; 165: 780-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), which allowed us to simultaneously measure 27 proteins (16 LS-TFs and 11 cell surface markers) in single cells. Furthermore, temporal barcoding (Bodenmiller et al., 2012Bodenmiller B. Zunder E.R. Finck R. Chen T.J. Savig E.S. Bruggner R.V. Simonds E.F. Bendall S.C. Sachs K. Krutzik P.O. Nolan G.P.

Protoc. 2015; 10: 316-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) also enabled us to perform multiplex analysis of these proteins at 13 sequential time points during erythropoiesis. This provided us with an unprecedented opportunity to effectively capture the temporal and quantitative dynamics of TFs at the protein level as multipotent hematopoietic cells undergo lineage specification and differentiate into erythroid cells. Although erythropoiesis has been studied using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in mice (Tusi et al., 2018Tusi B.K. Wolock S.L. Weinreb C. Hwang Y. Hidalgo D. Zilionis R. Waisman A. Huh J.R. Klein A.M. Socolovsky M. Population snapshots predict early haematopoietic and erythroid hierarchies.Nature. 2018; 555: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), models derived from this study have not incorporated temporal protein abundance measurements, and thus, the dynamics of erythroid lineage progression remains unclear. To address this, we performed a time course experiment whereby cord-blood-derived human CD34+ HSPCs were differentiated toward the erythroid lineage as previously described (Palii et al., 2011Palii C.G. Pasha R. Brand M. Lentiviral-mediated knockdown during ex vivo erythropoiesis of human hematopoietic stem cells.J. Vis. Exp. 2011; : 2813PubMed Google Scholar). This system fully recapitulates the various stages of erythropoiesis (Figure 1A). Cells were collected every 2 days between the formation of early HSPCs and terminally differentiated erythroid cells (22 days in total). At each time point, cells were barcoded with palladium isotopes (Bodenmiller et al., 2012Bodenmiller B. Zunder E.R. Finck R. Chen T.J. Savig E.S. Bruggner R.V. Simonds E.F. Bendall S.C. Sachs K.

Such temporal barcoding allowed us to compare the levels of key proteins between previously defined stages of erythropoiesis (Figure S1A).

Subsequent barcode deconvolution of single cells revealed the temporal appearance and disappearance of these populations, effectively capturing the dynamics of progression along the erythroid lineage (Figures 1C–1E). Interestingly, our data also reveal considerable heterogeneity within the previously defined colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-e) population. Indeed, in addition to early CFU-e1 (cluster 13) and late CFU-e2 (cluster 10) that differ by CD38 expression, we identified CFU-e3 (cluster 11), a population expressing the same combination of proteins as CFU-e2 except at a lower level, and a CFU-e-like population (cluster 7) that is highly similar to CFU-e3 with the exception of having lost CD36 and CD71 markers (Figures 1D and S1B). The exact role of these diverse CFU-e-like populations remains to be established. Although clustering analyses define discrete cell populations, we noticed that the levels of some proteins vary between cells within a designated population, suggesting that there may not be a clear-cut separation between populations and that cells may merge from one cell population to another. To address this, we used the K-nearest neighbor algorithm SPRING (Weinreb et al., 2018aWeinreb C. Wolock S. Klein A.M. SPRING: a kinetic interface for visualizing high dimensional single-cell expression data.Bioinformatics. 2018; 34: 1246-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). SPRING visualization of the pooled CyTOF time series suggests a continuum of differentiation with no clear separation of cell populations from early hematopoietic progenitors to late erythroid cells (Figure 1F). Although cells appear to pass gradually along the erythroid trajectory, transient cell populations also accumulate at specific stages (Figure S1C). Furthermore, temporal coloring of the SPRING plot (Figure 1F) revealed the dynamics of differentiation, which correlates remarkably well with the previously defined erythroid trajectory. Thus, through unbiased clustering, trajectory visualization, and temporal analysis of high-dimensional protein data, we were able to define a hierarchical trajectory that includes the major known as well as some novel stages of erythropoiesis from early hematopoietic progenitors to late erythroid cells. In addition to the main erythroid trajectory, our data reveal a minor “myeloid” trajectory characterized by expression of early myeloid markers (PU.1 and CD45RA—clusters 6 and 16), a minor “megakaryocytic” trajectory characterized by elevated levels of CD49f and CD41 (cluster 9), and a population of basophils (CD44high and GATA2high—cluster 12) recently proposed to emerge from a common erythroid-megakaryocyte-basophil progenitor (Tusi et al., 2018Tusi B.K. Wolock S.L. Weinreb C. Hwang Y. Hidalgo D. Zilionis R. Waisman A. Huh J.R. Klein A.M. Socolovsky M. Population snapshots predict early haematopoietic and erythroid hierarchies.Nature. 2018; 555: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar; Figures 1B, 1D, S1B, and S1C). The kinetics of these minor trajectories (i.e., they appear after day 2) shows that, even in an erythroid-promoting environment, hematopoietic progenitors retain the potential to initiate other hematopoietic lineages. Our temporal, multi-dimensional CyTOF dataset includes measurements for 16 endogenous TFs and therefore provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine co-expression of putative LS-TFs at the protein level in single cells along the hematopoietic and erythroid trajectory. Erythroid-biased megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor (E-MEP) cells (identified by unbiased clustering analysis; Figure 1D) were previously shown to possess differentiation potential toward both erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages in single-cell assays (Psaila et al., 2016Psaila B. Barkas N. Iskander D. Roy A. Anderson S. Ashley N. Caputo V.S. Lichtenberg J. Loaiza S. Bodine D.M. et al.Single-cell profiling of human megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors identifies distinct megakaryocyte and erythroid differentiation pathways.Genome Biol. 2016; 17: 83Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, KLF1 and FLI1 were predicted to be key regulators of the erythroid vs megakaryocytic decision point using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data (Tusi et al., 2018Tusi B.K. Wolock S.L. Weinreb C. Hwang Y. Hidalgo D. Zilionis R. Waisman A. Huh J.R. Klein A.M. Socolovsky M. Population snapshots predict early haematopoietic and erythroid hierarchies.Nature. 2018; 555: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To determine whether KLF1 and FLI1 are co-expressed at the protein level in individual progenitors, we gated E-MEP cells using a previously established strategy (Psaila et al., 2016Psaila B. Barkas N. Iskander D. Roy A. Anderson S. Ashley N. Caputo V.S. Lichtenberg J. Loaiza S. Bodine D.M. et al.Single-cell profiling of human megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors identifies distinct megakaryocyte and erythroid differentiation pathways.Genome Biol. 2016; 17: 83Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar; Figure S2A). As observed by unbiased clustering (Figure 1C), cells at the E-MEP stage are most abundant between days 2 and 4 (Figure 2A, top). Most importantly, CyTOF data show that the majority of E-MEPs co-express KLF1 and FLI1 proteins in individual cells (Figure 2A, bottom) demonstrating co-expression of TF proteins from competing hematopoietic lineages at the single-cell level in bipotential progenitors. We similarly found single-cell co-expression of the GATA1 and PU.1 pair of LS-TFs at the common myeloid progenitor (CMP) differentiation stage (Figure 2D). We next examined quantitative changes in LS-TFs as cells progress along the erythroid trajectory. In contrast to the stepwise model predicting that cell fate decisions are made via switches in LS-TFs occurring in bipotential progenitors, we did not observe an abrupt switch in KLF1 or FLI1 proteins immediately after the E-MEP stage. Instead, we found that the levels of both TFs change gradually (and oppositely) as cells progress along the erythroid trajectory, with both factors being co-expressed until the pro-erythroblast (proEB) stage (Figures 2B, 2C, S2B, and S2C). Although CyTOF allows one to measure quantitative changes in KLF1 and FLI1 proteins during erythroid differentiation, it does not provide information on the relative levels between the two proteins. To address this, we used a targeted mass spectrometry approach (stable isotope dilution [SID]-selected reaction monitoring [SRM]) to quantify the absolute concentration of the proteins (Picotti and Aebersold, 2012Picotti P. Aebersold R. Selected reaction monitoring-based proteomics: workflows, potential, pitfalls and future directions.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared at regular intervals during the course of erythropoiesis, and SID-SRM assays were performed to quantify FLI1 and KLF1 proteins at each time point (Figure 3). These data show that KLF1 and FLI1 proteins are present at equimolar levels (i.e., ∼3,000 molecules of each TF per nucleus) around day 2, which corresponds to the time point with the highest proportion of cells at the E-MEP stage. SID-SRM quantification at subsequent time points indicates a gradual increase vs decrease in KLF1 vs FLI1 protein levels, respectively, consistent with the CyTOF data. Thus, single-cell CyTOF and SID-SRM-based mass spectrometry independently confirm a gradual change in KLF1 and FLI1 protein levels as hematopoietic cells progress along the erythroid trajectory. Our finding that KLF1 and FLI1 proteins are co-expressed in single cells at the E-MEP stage together with the observation that their levels gradually change in opposite directions as cells pass along the erythroid trajectory suggests that quantitative changes in KLF1 and FLI1 proteins underlie the erythroid versus megakaryocytic cell fate choice. However, the question remains whether such changes direct cell fate decisions or whether they merely reinforce lineage identity. To test this, we overexpressed the putative megakaryocyte-promoting LS-TF (FLI1) in E-MEPs and asked whether this deviated progenitors from the erythroid trajectory. We reasoned that, if LS-TFs are only involved in reinforcing lineage decisions, overexpression of a LS-TF from an alternate lineage might interfere with differentiation, but not promote an alternate lineage. On the other hand, if quantitative changes in the levels of LS-TFs play a role in establishing cell fate, overexpression of alternate TFs in progenitors should direct differentiation toward an alternate lineage trajectory. Briefly, cells at the E-MEP stage (day 2) were infected with lentiviruses expressing a FLAG-tagged version of the non-erythroid TF FLI1 (FLAG-FLI1) (Figure 4A). Again, we performed CyTOF with temporal barcoding whereby introduction of a FLAG antibody allowed us to track the fate of thousands of cells over time upon ectopic FLI1 expression (along with thousands of unperturbed cells), enabling us to directly assess the consequences of quantitative changes in the level of a TF protein on cell fate decision in single cells. In addition to the expected erythroid trajectory, SPRING analysis revealed a second trajectory with a similar kinetic (Figure 4B) characterized by gradual upregulation of megakaryocytic markers (e.g., CD41, CD49f, and CXCR4) instead of erythroid markers (e.g., CD71 and GPA; Figures 4E, S3D, and S4A) showing that cells along this trajectory have deviated from an erythroid fate toward a megakaryocytic fate. Strikingly, this alternative trajectory is almost exclusively composed of cells that express the ectopic FLAG-FLI1 protein (Figures 4C, 4D, and S3C), strongly arguing that FLI1 not only interferes with erythroid differentiation but also promotes a megakaryocytic fate. In addition, gating for FLAG-positive and FLAG-negative cells allowed us to directly compare dynamic changes in the levels of TFs between the two cell populations over time (Figures 4F, S3, and S4). In cells that do not express FLAG-FLI1, we observe the expected time-dependent increase in KLF1 and GATA1 proteins that occurs during erythroid differentiation (Figure 4F, front rows). In contrast, FLAG-FLI1-expressing cells fail to upregulate these TFs (Figure 4F, back rows) or other erythroid markers (i.e., IKZF1, TAL1, CD71, and GPA; Figure S3D, back rows), suggesting decreased erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, we found that GATA2 protein levels increase with time in cells expressing FLAG-FLI1, more so than in their FLAG-FLI1-negative counterparts (Figure 4F). This is consistent with GATA2’s role in favoring megakaryocytic over erythroid differentiation (Ikonomi et al., 2000Ikonomi P. Rivera C.E. Riordan M. Washington G. Schechter A.N. Noguchi C.T. Overexpression of GATA-2 inhibits erythroid and promotes megakaryocyte differentiation.Exp. Hematol. 2000; 28: 1423-1431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that FLAG-FLI1-expressing cells upregulate megakaryocytic markers, such as MafG, CD41, CD49f, and CXCR4 (Figure S4A), showing an active role of FLAG-FLI1 in promoting megakaryocyte differentiation. Thus, even in a strongly erythroid-promoting environment, ectopic expression of FLI1 in bipotential progenitors can deviate cells from their preferred erythroid trajectory toward an alternate megakaryocytic fate. Collectively, these data strongly argue for an active role of a LS-TF (FLI1) protein in the initiation of a cell fate decision by promoting megakaryocytic differentiation at the expense of an erythroid fate. In the present study, we used single-cell proteomics to define the temporal hierarchy of human erythropoiesis. Through the development of a unique approach that integrates time-dependent, single-cell protein measurements, we were able to effectively capture the dynamic progression and hierarchical relationships of hematopoietic cells as they transition between multiple stages along the erythroid trajectory. Importantly, we provide these data as an interactive web tool to facilitate visualization and further analyses. The classical stepwise model of hematopoiesis whereby homogeneous populations of progenitors are faced with a succession of binary choices between mutually exclusive lineages has recently been replaced by a continuous model of differentiation whereby lineage-biased hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells gradually differentiate along a continuum of lineage-specific trajectories without clearly defined cell populations (Laurenti and Göttgens, 2018Laurenti E. Göttgens B. From haematopoietic stem cells to complex differentiation landscapes.Nature. 2018; 553: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, these trajectories rely on transcriptomic rather than proteomic measurements, and they are based on algorithms that use snapshot scRNA-seq measurements to predict lineage trajectories by organizing cells along a pseudo-time axis according to their relative phenotypic similarity (Kester and van Oudenaarden, 2018Kester L. van Oudenaarden A. Single-cell transcriptomics meets lineage tracing.Cell Stem Cell. 2018; 23: 166-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although valuable and insightful, such static data have a number of known limitations (Weinreb et al., 2018bWeinreb C. Wolock S. Tusi B.K. Socolovsky M. Klein A.M. Fundamental limits on dynamic inference from single-cell snapshots.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115: E2467-E2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and the lack of temporal information makes it more difficult to assess true ascendant and descendant relationships. For instance, there is some uncertainty on the positioning of megakaryocytes within the hematopoietic hierarchy, as some studies have suggested that they originate directly from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (Notta et al., 2016Notta F. Zandi S. Takayama N. Dobson S. Gan O.I. Wilson G. Kaufmann K.B. McLeod J. Laurenti E. Dunant C.F. et al.Distinct routes of lineage development reshape the human blood hierarchy across ontogeny.Science. 2016; 351: aab2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and other studies have proposed that they originate from MEPs (Tusi et al., 2018Tusi B.K. Wolock S.L. Weinreb C. Hwang Y. Hidalgo D. Zilionis R. Waisman A. Huh J.R. Klein A.M. Socolovsky M. Population snapshots predict early haematopoietic and erythroid hierarchies.Nature. 2018; 555: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and yet other studies have not been able to conclude (Zheng et al., 2018Zheng S.

Biol. 2018; 14: e8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here, our analyses incorporate time-dependent single-cell proteomic measurements, allowing us to define a trajectory that is based not only on protein similarity but also on the time-dependent appearance of different cell types. As such, we were able to observe that, in the system analyzed here, megakaryocytes originate from MEPs, not HSCs. Furthermore, although our results are consistent with a continuous rather than a stepwise model of erythropoiesis, our data reveal a timely ordered appearance and disappearance of transient cell populations or stages that accumulate at various positions along the erythroid trajectory with cells undergoing gradual transitions between these stages. Notably, these stages include previously defined cell subpopulations that, despite their transient nature, can be isolated from cord blood using combinations of cell surface markers (An et al., 2014An X.

Quantitative changes in the relative amounts of LS-TFs have historically been considered as a key mechanism for lineage determination. Indeed, in the stepwise hematopoiesis model, cell fate choice was thought to occur through quantitative on or off switches between LS-TFs that are co-expressed in bipotential progenitors (Graf and Enver, 2009Graf T.

https://openalex.org/W2922186138,"Crossing over is a nearly universal feature of sexual reproduction. Here, analysis of crossover numbers on a per-chromosome and per-nucleus basis reveals a fundamental, evolutionarily conserved feature of meiosis: within individual nuclei, crossover frequencies covary across different chromosomes. This effect results from per-nucleus covariation of chromosome axis lengths. Crossovers can promote evolutionary adaptation. However, the benefit of creating favorable new allelic combinations must outweigh the cost of disrupting existing favorable combinations. Covariation concomitantly increases the frequencies of gametes with especially high, or especially low, numbers of crossovers, and thus might concomitantly enhance the benefits of crossing over while reducing its costs. A four-locus population genetic model suggests that such an effect can pertain in situations where the environment fluctuates: hyper-crossover gametes are advantageous when the environment changes while hypo-crossover gametes are advantageous in periods of environmental stasis. These findings reveal a new feature of the basic meiotic program and suggest a possible adaptive advantage."
https://openalex.org/W4256531919,"Pre-mRNA splicing is executed by the spliceosome. Structural characterization of the catalytically activated complex (B∗) is pivotal for understanding the branching reaction. In this study, we assembled the B∗ complexes on two different pre-mRNAs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and determined the cryo-EM structures of four distinct B∗ complexes at overall resolutions of 2.9-3.8 Å. The duplex between U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and the branch point sequence (BPS) is discretely away from the 5'-splice site (5'SS) in the three B∗ complexes that are devoid of the step I splicing factors Yju2 and Cwc25. Recruitment of Yju2 into the active site brings the U2/BPS duplex into the vicinity of 5'SS, with the BPS nucleophile positioned 4 Å away from the catalytic metal M2. This analysis reveals the functional mechanism of Yju2 and Cwc25 in branching. These structures on different pre-mRNAs reveal substrate-specific conformations of the spliceosome in a major functional state."
https://openalex.org/W2920941152,"Nucleoporins (Nups) are involved in neural development, and alterations in Nup genes are linked to human neurological diseases. However, physiological functions of specific Nups and the underlying mechanisms involved in these processes remain elusive. Here, we show that tissue-specific depletion of the nucleoporin Seh1 causes dramatic myelination defects in the CNS. Although proliferation is not altered in Seh1-deficient oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), they fail to differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes, which impairs myelin production and remyelination after demyelinating injury. Genome-wide analyses show that Seh1 regulates a core myelinogenic regulatory network and establishes an accessible chromatin landscape. Mechanistically, Seh1 regulates OPCs differentiation by assembling Olig2 and Brd7 into a transcription complex at nuclear periphery. Together, our results reveal that Seh1 is required for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination by promoting assembly of an Olig2-dependent transcription complex and define a nucleoporin as a key player in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2921693652,"Background About 25% of women in the United States are obese prior to becoming pregnant. Although there is some knowledge about the relationship between the gastrointestinal microbiota and obesity, little is known about the relationship between pre-pregnancy obesity and the gastrointestinal microbiota in pregnancy or its impact on infant gut microbiota. However, the composition of the gut microbiota early in life may influence childhood health. Thus, the objective of this research was to identify associations between maternal pre-pregnancy obesity and the pregnancy (n = 39) or early infancy (n = 39) microbiotas. Results Fecal bacterial communities from overweight women had lower microbiota diversity (Chao1: p = 0.02; inverse Simpson: p = 0.05; Shannon: p = 0.02) than communities from normal weight or obese women. The within-group microbiota composition of overweight women differed from those of normal and obese women at the genus and phylum levels (p = 0.003 and p = 0.02, respectively). Pre-pregnancy overweight women had higher abundances of Bacteroides and lower Phascolarctobacterium than women who were normal weight or obese prior to becoming pregnant. Normal weight women had lower abundances of Acidaminococcus and Dialister than overweight and obese women. Infant community composition tended to differ in membership (Sorensen index) by maternal pre-pregnancy BMI category, and significantly differed by delivery mode and breastfeeding exclusivity (p = 0.06, p = 0.001, p = 0.008, respectively). Infants from normal weight women had lower abundances of Megasphaera than infants from overweight or obese women. Streptococcus was lowest in infants from overweight women, and Staphylococcus was lowest in infants from obese women. Conclusion Maternal and infant microbiotas are associated with and might be affected by maternal pre-pregnancy BMI. Future work should determine if there are also functional differences in the infant microbiome, if those functional differences are related to maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, and whether differences in composition or traits persist over time."
https://openalex.org/W2922467843,"Light responses are initiated in photoreceptors, processed by interneurons, and synaptically transmitted to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which send information to the brain. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a blinding disease caused by photoreceptor degeneration, depriving downstream neurons of light-sensitive input. Photoreceptor degeneration also triggers hyperactive firing of RGCs, obscuring light responses initiated by surviving photoreceptors. Here we show that retinoic acid (RA), signaling through its receptor (RAR), is the trigger for hyperactivity. A genetically encoded reporter shows elevated RAR signaling in degenerated retinas from murine RP models. Enhancing RAR signaling in healthy retinas mimics the pathophysiology of degenerating retinas. Drug inhibition of RAR reduces hyperactivity in degenerating retinas and unmasks light responses in RGCs. Gene therapy inhibition of RAR increases innate and learned light-elicited behaviors in vision-impaired mice. Identification of RAR as the trigger for hyperactivity presents a degeneration-dependent therapeutic target for enhancing low vision in RP and other blinding disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2921773252,"Emotions play a critical role in rational and intelligent behavior; a better fundamental knowledge of them is indispensable for understanding higher order brain function. We propose a non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) system to feedback a person’s affective state such that a closed-loop interaction between the participant’s brain responses and the musical stimuli is established. We realized this concept technically in a functional prototype of an algorithm that generates continuous and controllable patterns of synthesized affective music in real-time, which is embedded within a BCI architecture. We evaluated our concept in two separate studies. In the first study, we tested the efficacy of our music algorithm by measuring subjective affective responses from 11 participants. In a second pilot study, the algorithm was embedded in a real-time BCI architecture to investigate affective closed-loop interactions in 5 participants. Preliminary results suggested that participants were able to intentionally modulate the musical feedback by self-inducing emotions (e.g., by recalling memories), suggesting that the system was able not only to capture the listener’s current affective state in real-time, but also potentially provide a tool for listeners to mediate their own emotions by interacting with music. The proposed concept offers a tool to study emotions in the loop, promising to cast a complementary light on emotion-related brain research, particularly in terms of clarifying the interactive, spatio-temporal dynamics underlying affective processing in the brain."

In adult mammals, a majority of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are in a quiescent or dormant state (Cheng et al., 2000Cheng T. Rodrigues N. Shen H. Yang Y. Dombkowski D. Sykes M. Scadden D.T.

USA. 1999; 96: 3120-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Only a small portion of HSCs get activated, entering the cell cycle to either self-renew or produce progeny (i.e., differentiation) during steady-state hematopoiesis (Wright et al., 2001Wright D.E.

Balanced quiescence and activation in this cell reservoir is crucial for maintaining hematopoietic regeneration and long-term hematopoiesis (Nakamura-Ishizu et al., 2014Nakamura-Ishizu A. Takizawa H.

Loss of stem cell quiescence or dormancy leads to aberrant activation and increased apoptosis, which in the long run can cause stem cell exhaustion and defects in repopulation capabilities. It is believed that HSC quiescence is achieved in part by the localization and retention of HSCs in the specialized healthy and supportive bone marrow (BM) microenvironment (also known as the niche; Calvi and Link, 2015Calvi L.M.

Indeed, homing or engraftment and quiescence of HSCs are critically regulated by their adhesion to their microenvironment (Mendelson and Frenette, 2014Mendelson A. Frenette P.S.

Studies in the last decade have demonstrated cytokine and chemokine signaling, transcriptional, genetic, epigenetic, and metabolic regulation of HSC quiescence. However, our understanding of the mechanisms regulating HSC maintenance and function remains incomplete. Emerging evidence has linked cell-intrinsic mechanics to functional behaviors (Fletcher and Mullins, 2010Fletcher D.A. Mullins R.D. Cell mechanics and the cytoskeleton.Nature. 2010; 463: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). The biophysical trait of a single cell is inextricably linked to the cytoskeleton, the interconnected network of filamentous polymers and regulatory proteins. It has become increasingly evident that intrinsic and extrinsic mechanical properties, which describe the resistance to deformation (elasticity) or flow (viscosity) in response to an applied force, regulate cellular behaviors, such as cell morphology, adhesion, migration, and trafficking. Studies of mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells, and HSCs cultured on matrices of different elasticity have suggested that differentiation of these stem cells is mechanosensitive (Chowdhury et al., 2010Chowdhury F.

The effect of cell-intrinsic mechanical properties on the function of stem cells, especially HSCs, is not well understood. Recent studies have demonstrated that cell contractile forces, polarized motility, and nuclear deformability are associated with self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs (Shin et al., 2013Shin J.W. Spinler K.R. Swift J. Chasis J.A. Mohandas N. Discher D.E. Lamins regulate cell trafficking and lineage maturation of adult human hematopoietic cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, the direct relationship between cell-intrinsic mechanics and HSC niche retention and mobility in the in vivo setting remains unclear. Ptpn21, a widely expressed protein tyrosine phosphatase (Møller et al., 1994Møller N.P. Møller K.B. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Sures I. Ullrich A. Src kinase associates with a member of a distinct subfamily of protein-tyrosine phosphatases containing an ezrin-like domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 7477-7481Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), is poorly studied. This phosphatase contains an N-terminal sequence homologous to cytoskeletal-associated proteins, including a four-point-one/ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM) domain, which is a modular structure that mediates interactions with the plasma membrane. Indeed, it has been shown that Ptpn21 is localized along actin filaments and that its FERM domain is required for this association (Carlucci et al., 2008Carlucci A. Gedressi C. Lignitto L. Nezi L. Villa-Moruzzi E. Avvedimento E.V. Gottesman M. Garbi C. Feliciello A. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPD1 regulates focal adhesion kinase autophosphorylation and cell migration.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10919-10929Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of Ptpn21 is positioned at the end of the C terminus, and Ptpn21 catalytic activity is required for actin filament stability (Carlucci et al., 2008Carlucci A. Gedressi C. Lignitto L. Nezi L. Villa-Moruzzi E. Avvedimento E.V. Gottesman M. Garbi C. Feliciello A. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPD1 regulates focal adhesion kinase autophosphorylation and cell migration.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10919-10929Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Consistent with its important role in stabilizing actin filaments, Ptpn21 is involved in the regulation of cytoskeleton-associated cellular processes, including cell adhesion and motility (Carlucci et al., 2008Carlucci A. Gedressi C. Lignitto L. Nezi L. Villa-Moruzzi E. Avvedimento E.V. Gottesman M. Garbi C. Feliciello A. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPD1 regulates focal adhesion kinase autophosphorylation and cell migration.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10919-10929Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Importantly, missense mutations and frameshift-truncating mutations in Ptpn21 have been identified in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (IntOGen—mutational cancer drivers database) and colon cancer (Giannakis et al., 2014Giannakis M. Hodis E. Jasmine Mu X. Yamauchi M. Rosenbluh J. Cibulskis K. Saksena G. Lawrence M.S. Qian Z.R. Nishihara R. et al.RNF43 is frequently mutated in colorectal and endometrial cancers.Nat.

However, the mechanisms by which Ptpn21 regulates these physiological and pathophysiological processes are poorly understood. Our recent gene expression analyses for protein tyrosine phosphatases show that Ptpn21 is highly expressed in HSCs as opposed to CD45+ leukocytes. To further determine the role of Ptpn21 in hematopoietic cell development, we generated Ptpn21 knockout mice. With this mouse model, we have identified an important role of Ptpn21 in cell mechanics and HSC niche retention. Our recent gene expression analyses showed that Ptpn21 was highly expressed in HSCs and early progenitors. Levels of Ptpn21 in HSCs (Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+CD150+CD48−) were >7-fold higher than those in whole BM cells (Figure 1A). To determine the role of Ptpn21 in hematopoietic cell development, we generated Ptpn21 knockout mice through gene targeting (Figures S1A and S1B). PCR analyses of genomic DNA confirmed that the targeted Ptpn21 DNA fragment was deleted in homozygous knockout (Ptpn21−/−) blood cells (Figure S1C). qRT-PCR assays showed that Ptpn21 mRNA was undetectable in Ptpn21−/− early progenitor LSK (Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+) cells (enriched for HSCs; Figure S1D). Ptpn21 knockout mice did not display overt abnormalities during 12 months of follow-up. However, total numbers of BM cells and lineage cells (Mac-1+Gr-1+ myeloid, B220+ B, and CD3+ T cells) in Ptpn21−/− mice were reduced as compared to wild-type (WT) (Ptpn21+/+) control mice (Figures S2A and S2B). Interestingly, Ptpn21−/− mice showed increased white blood cell (WBC) counts in the peripheral blood (PB) (Figure S2C). The absolute number of myeloid (but not B or T lymphoid) cells in the PB increased in these knockout mice (Figure S2D). To assess the effects of Ptpn21 deficiency on HSCs, we quantified phenotypic stem and progenitor cell populations in Ptpn21 knockout mice. Both percentages (Figure S2E) and absolute numbers (Figure 1B) of HSCs and LSK cells in the BM significantly decreased in Ptpn21−/− mice as compared to Ptpn21+/+ mice. Frequencies (Figure S2F) and absolute numbers (Figure 1C) of common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) (Lin−c-Kit+Sca-1−CD16/32medCD34+), common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) (Lin−c-Kit lowSca-1lowCD127+), and more committed myeloid progenitors, including granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) (Lin−c-Kit+Sca-1−CD16/32high CD34+) and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs) (Lin−c-Kit+Sca-1−CD16/32med/lowCD34−) also decreased in Ptpn21−/− mice. Consistent with these phenotypic data, functional colony-forming unit (CFU) assays verified that CFU-granulocyte, erythrocyte, macrophage, and megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM), CFU-granulocyte and macrophage (CFU-GM), and burst forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) decreased in Ptpn21−/− BM (Figure 1D). Cell cycle analyses revealed that percentages of quiescent cells (G0 phase) in HSC and LSK cell populations were decreased, whereas percentages of HSCs and LSK cells in the G1 or S/G2/M phases were increased in Ptpn21−/− mice (Figures 1E and S2G). Moreover, increased apoptosis was detected in Ptpn21−/− HSCs (Figure 1F), LSK, LK, and Lin−, but not Lin+ cells (Figure S2H). These data suggest that Ptpn21 is important for maintenance of HSCs and early progenitors. Loss of Ptpn21 decreased quiescence and increased apoptosis in stem and early progenitor cells. To determine the impact of Ptpn21 deficiency on the function of HSCs, we treated Ptpn21−/− and WT mice with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a cell-cycle-dependent myelotoxic agent that kills proliferating cells, including cycling hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Following a single dose of 5-FU, WBC counts dropped quickly in both Ptpn21−/− and Ptpn21+/+ mice. The hematopoietic recovery, which depends on replenishment or regeneration from surviving long-term HSCs, was essentially blocked in Ptpn21−/− mice. Compared to WT mice in which WBC counts recovered to the normal level 2 weeks after 5-FU treatment, WBC counts in Ptpn21−/− mice continued to decrease and remained very low (Figure 1G). Consistent with these data, 100% of Ptpn21−/− mice challenged with two lower doses of 5-FU over 1 week died of hematopoietic failure whereas ∼80% of WT mice survived (Figure 1H). To further assess Ptpn21−/− HSC function, we first determined their homing ability but found no difference between Ptpn21−/− and WT cells (Figure S3A). We then performed competitive repopulation assays. BM cells (test cells) isolated from Ptpn21−/− or Ptpn21+/+ mice (CD45.2+) were mixed with BM cells (competitor cells) isolated from normal congenic BoyJ mice (CD45.1+) at the ratio of 1:1 and transplanted into lethally irradiated BoyJ mice. 4 months after transplantation, BM cells harvested from these mice were transplanted into secondary recipients. In this competitive setting, hematopoietic reconstitution from Ptpn21-deleted donor stem cells was compromised in primary (Figures 1I and 1J) and secondary transplants (Figure 1K). Contributions of Ptpn21 knockout stem cells to the whole hematopoietic cell population and each lineage in primary and secondary transplants were markedly decreased (Figures 1I–1K, S3B, and S3C). Moreover, in both primary and secondary transplants, self-renewed Ptpn21−/− HSCs were also decreased (Figure 1L). Furthermore, we performed competitive repopulation assays with purified HSCs. Equal numbers of HSCs sorted from Ptpn21−/− or Ptpn21+/+ mice were mixed with the same amount of competitor BoyJ BM cells and transplanted into lethally irradiated BoyJ recipients. Ptpn21 knockout donor HSCs indeed showed greatly decreased repopulation capabilities compared to Ptpn21+/+ counterparts (Figures S3D–S3F). HSCs derived from Ptpn21−/− donor stem cells in the transplants significantly decreased compared to those derived from Ptpn21+/+ donor stem cells (Figure S3G), verifying that deletion of Ptpn21 impaired HSC maintenance and function. WBC counts in the PB increased and numbers of stem cells and early progenitors in the BM decreased in Ptpn21 knockout mice; these seemingly contradictory observations led us to hypothesize that extramedullary hematopoiesis and stem and early progenitor cell egress might occur in these knockouts. To test this hypothesis, we examined LSK cells in the PB of Ptpn21−/− and Ptpn21+/+ mice. Compared to WT mice, Ptpn21−/− mice exhibited increased frequency and absolute number of these early progenitors in the PB (Figure 2A). Consistent with these findings, hematopoietic progenitors detected by CFU assays were doubled in Ptpn21−/− PB (Figure 2B). LSK cells and HSCs in the spleen also significantly increased in Ptpn21−/− mice, although no splenomegaly was observed (Figure 2C). The significant increase in the numbers of LSK cells in the PB and HSCs in the spleen in Ptpn21−/− mice indicated that stem and early progenitor cells lacking Ptpn21 had enhanced mobility. To further address this possibility, we administered Ptpn21−/− and Ptpn21+/+ mice with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), a clinically used agent for stem cell mobilization. Compared to control mice, G-CSF-induced mobilization of LSK cells and HSCs to the PB and spleen in Ptpn21−/− mice was substantially increased (Figures 2D and 2E). Consistent with these results, hematopoietic progenitors in the PB detected by CFU assays were also increased (Figure 2F). Moreover, WBC counts increased in knockout mice in response to G-CSF administration (Figure 2G). The increased sensitivity of Ptpn21−/− stem and progenitor cells to G-CSF-induced mobilization indicated that Ptpn21 might be required for maintenance of stem cells in BM niches. In situ imaging of HSCs in the BM illustrated that the distance of HSCs from CD31+CD144+ endothelial cells, which comprise endothelial HSC niches (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J. Yilmaz O.H. Iwashita T. Yilmaz O.H. Terhorst C. Morrison S.J. SLAM family receptors distinguish hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and reveal endothelial niches for stem cells.Cell. 2005; 121: 1109-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar), was significantly increased (Figure 3A). The percentages of HSCs close to Nestin+ mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MSPCs) (Figure 3B), which constitute unique sinusoidal vascular and arteriolar stem cell niches (Kunisaki et al., 2013Kunisaki Y. Bruns I. Scheiermann C. Ahmed J. Pinho S. Zhang D. Mizoguchi T. Wei Q. Lucas D.

Med. 2014; 20: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar; Figure 3C), were decreased by greater than half in Ptpn21−/− mice. These imaging data together with the above functional data suggest that deletion of Ptpn21 dislocates HSCs in the BM, leading to their egress into the PB. Ptpn21 was globally deleted from the knockout mice; to further determine whether the impaired niche occupancy and egress phenotypes of HSCs in Ptpn21 knockout mice were caused by a cell-intrinsic effect or a defect in the BM microenvironment, we performed reciprocal transplantation assays. At 20 weeks following transplantation, significantly increased hematopoietic progenitors and LSK cells were detected in the PB and spleen, whereas HSCs and LSK cells decreased in the BM of the WT recipients transplanted with Ptpn21−/− cells (Figures 3D–3H), recapitulating the phenotypes of Ptpn21 global knockout mice. Moreover, Ptpn21 knockout HSCs in WT recipients also showed enhanced cell cycling (Figure 3I). In contrast, no significant defects in WT donor stem and early progenitor cells in Ptpn21−/− recipient mice were observed (Figures 3D–3H). These results suggest that stem and early progenitor cell egress in Ptpn21 global knockout mice is caused by a cell-intrinsic mechanism. Adhesion of HSCs to microenvironmental cells is known to be important for the retention of HSCs within BM niches (Mendelson and Frenette, 2014Mendelson A. Frenette P.S. Hematopoietic stem cell niche maintenance during homeostasis and regeneration.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, Potocnik et al., 2000Potocnik A.J. Brakebusch C.

Fetal and adult hematopoietic stem cells require beta1 integrin function for colonizing fetal liver, spleen, and bone marrow.Immunity. 2000; 12: 653-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We therefore examined adhesion activities of Ptpn21−/− and WT LSK cells. Knockout cells showed reduced adhesion to fibronectin-coated slides (Figure 4A), although cell adhesion molecules α4 integrin (CD49d), β1 integrin (CD29), CD44, P-selectin ligand-1 (Selplg-1), and E-selectin ligand-1 (Esl-1) were comparably expressed in the knockout and WT cells (Figure S4A). Intriguingly, despite reduced adhesion and unchanged cell size (Figure S4B), knockout LSK cells migrated through micropores more efficiently than WT cells in chemotaxis Transwell assays with 5-μm pores (Figure 4B). When challenged with 3-μm pores (which are considerably smaller than the smallest dimension of hematopoietic cells), Ptpn21 knockout cells performed much better in migrating through the pores than did control cells with or without the chemokine stromal-cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) (a chemoattractant; Figure 4B). These results suggest that Ptpn21-deficient cells are more deformable and elastic compared to control cells. Previous studies have shown that mechanical properties of extracellular matrix can significantly affect stem cell motility (Holst et al., 2010Holst J. Watson S. Lord M.S. Eamegdool S.S. Bax D.V. Nivison-Smith L.B. Kondyurin A. Ma L. Oberhauser A.F. Weiss A.S. Rasko J.E. Substrate elasticity provides mechanical signals for the expansion of hemopoietic stem and progenitor cells.Nat.

Ivanovska I.L. et al.Contractile forces sustain and polarize hematopoiesis from stem and progenitor cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 81-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To better examine Ptpn21−/− HSCs, we devised a 3D HSC motility assay system with two layers of collagen hydrogels (bottom gels contained SDF-1) and determined HSC deformability and motility in upper collagen hydrogels of varying elasticity (the stiffness of the collagen hydrogels increased with the collagen concentrations and the pore size decreased; Figure 4C). Sorted HSCs were seeded to the top of the upper gels, and migration of HSCs was real-time tracked. 3D stack images illustrated that more Ptpn21−/− HSCs than Ptpn21+/+ HSCs migrated into the upper gels regardless of gel stiffness or pore sizes (Figure 4D). This was especially the case when stiff gels were used (WT HSCs barely migrated). These results suggest that Ptpn21−/− stem cells have increased deformability and motility independent of matrix substrate mechanical properties. Cytoskeletal remodeling, particularly changes in actin, is an important process regulating cell adhesion and migration (Parsons et al., 2010Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Schwartz M.A. Cell adhesion: integrating cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular tension.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). β-actin was constant in Ptpn21 knockout HSCs (data not shown). We therefore examined filamentous actin (F-actin). Confocal microscopic examination and flow cytometric quantification revealed significantly reduced cortical polymerized actin in Ptpn21-deficient HSCs (Figures 5A and 5B ). Differences in F-actin cytoskeletal reorganization might translate into local effects on cell mechanics (Oakes et al., 2009Oakes P.W. Patel D.C. Morin N.A. Zitterbart D.P. Fabry B. Reichner J.S.

Cell Biol. 2012; 199: 669-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We therefore measured stiffness of HSCs, LSK, and Lin− cells with an atomic force microscopy (AFM) and found that Ptpn21−/− cells were significantly softer than WT counterparts (Figure 5C). A consequence of reduced cytoskeletal rearrangements that lead to a decrease in cell stiffness can be enhanced cell deformability (Fletcher and Mullins, 2010Fletcher D.A. Mullins R.D. Cell mechanics and the cytoskeleton.Nature. 2010; 463: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). To further examine the relative deformability of Ptpn21 knockout cells, we utilized a microfluidic mode (Figure 5D), an established bioengineering instrument with multiple microchannels (5.9 ± 0.8 μm, which are smaller than the average HSC and lymphocyte diameters; Fay et al., 2016Fay M.E. Myers D.R. Kumar A. Turbyfield C.T. Byler R. Crawford K. Mannino R.G. Laohapant A. Tyburski E.A.

Analyzing cell mechanics in hematologic diseases with microfluidic biophysical flow cytometry.Lab Chip. 2008; 8: 1062-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Given that the physical deformability of normal human CD34+CD38− cells has been shown to depend on myosin-II and to decrease in differentiation (Shin et al., 2014Shin J.W. Buxboim A. Spinler K.R. Swift J. Christian D.A. Hunter C.A. Léon C. Gachet C. Dingal P.C. Ivanovska I.L. et al.Contractile forces sustain and polarize hematopoiesis from stem and progenitor cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 81-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we assessed the deformability of normal mouse HSCs, LSK, and Lin+ cells. Despite a smaller volume (Figure 5E), stem and early progenitor cells traversed the microfluidic channels much more slowly compared to Lin+ cells, suggesting that stem cells are less deformable (Figure 5F). AFM measurements confirmed that HSCs, LSK cells, and Lin− cells were stiffer than Lin+ cells (Figure 5G). Although no significant difference in cell rigidity between quiescent (in the G0 phase) and activated HSCs (in the G1/S/G2/M phases) was detected (F"

Taken together, these results provide direct evidence that the IT cortex causally supports general core object recognition and that the underlying IT coding dimensions are topographically organized. Primate core visual object recognition—the ability to rapidly recognize objects in the central 10 degrees in spite of naturally occurring identity-preserving image variability—is thought to rely on the ventral visual stream, a hierarchy of visual cortical areas (DiCarlo et al., 2012DiCarlo J.J. Zoccolan D. Rust N.C. How does the brain solve visual object recognition?.Neuron. 2012; 73: 415-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Decades of research suggest that the inferior temporal (IT) cortex, the highest level of the ventral stream hierarchy, is a necessary part of the brain’s neural network that underlies core recognition behavior (Logothetis and Sheinberg, 1996Logothetis N.K.

For example, it has been shown that parallel linear object discriminants acting on the IT population not only match overall primate behavioral performance (Hung et al., 2005Hung C.P. Kreiman G.

Neurosci. 2015; 35: 13402-13418Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), showing that IT is a tight neural correlate of primate recognition behavior. Quantitative versions of such experiments have proposed downstream neurally mechanistic models that successfully link IT population activity to behavior (Majaj et al., 2015Majaj N.J. Hong H. Solomon E.A. DiCarlo J.J. Simple learned weighted sums of inferior temporal neuronal firing rates accurately predict human core object recognition performance.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 13402-13418Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), mechanisms that appear to accurately generalize to all core object recognition subtasks (e.g., “car” versus “not car,” “face” versus “not face,” etc.). While these experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that IT is a necessary node in the neural network supporting core object recognition behavior, they might also be epiphenomenal (Katz et al., 2016Katz L.N.

To directly infer the causal role of IT in this behavior, it is necessary to bring the IT activity under more direct experimenter control (e.g., via the application of pharmacological agents into IT to silence neurons, etc.) while measuring behavior. To date, the most successful direct IT manipulations in the context of object recognition have targeted millimeter-scale clusters of face-selective neurons in IT (Afraz et al., 2006Afraz S.-R. Kiani R. Esteky H. Microstimulation of inferotemporal cortex influences face categorization.Nature. 2006; 442: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, Afraz et al., 2015Afraz A.

Zarco W. Freiwald W.A. A causal relationship between face-patch activity and face-detection behavior.eLife. 2017; 6: e18558Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that neurons in these IT subregions are necessary for at least some basic- and subordinate-level face recognition behaviors. Beyond this domain, a notable study by Verhoef et al., 2012Verhoef B.-E. Vogels R. Janssen P. Inferotemporal cortex subserves three-dimensional structure categorization.Neuron. 2012; 73: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar found that manipulation of clusters of 3D-structure-preferring neurons in IT influenced the categorization of 3D stimuli as convex or concave. However, results from direct manipulations of IT in general visual object recognition behavior have been equivocal at best. Lesions of IT sometimes suggest the necessity of IT and visual behaviors (Cowey and Gross, 1970Cowey A. Gross C.G.

Pytko-Joiner D.E. Voytko M.L. Salsbury K. The performance of visual tasks while segments of the inferotemporal cortex are suppressed by cold.Behav.

Mild perceptual categorization deficits follow bilateral removal of anterior inferior temporal cortex in rhesus monkeys.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Thus, it is still unclear whether IT is a necessary node in supporting general core object recognition behavior. Moreover, even if the IT cortex is indeed necessary for all core object recognition subtasks, it is unclear whether that assumed causal role is spatially organized. For example, the current literature on monkey IT is consistent with the hypothesis that every square millimeter of the IT cortex outside of the fMRI-defined face patches is equally involved in all (non-face) object discriminations, with some authors implicitly arguing for that hypothesis (Tsao and Livingstone, 2008Tsao D.Y. Livingstone M.S. Mechanisms of face perception.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 411-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, Kanwisher, 2010Kanwisher N. Functional specificity in the human brain: a window into the functional architecture of the mind.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 11163-11170Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). To investigate these open questions, we reversibly inactivated neurons in individual, arbitrarily sampled millimeter-scale regions of the ventral surface of IT via local injection of muscimol (a single injection of 1 μl of muscimol, corresponding to strong neural suppression in a volume ∼2.5 mm in diameter, centered at the injection site; Arikan et al., 2002Arikan R. Blake N.M.J. Erinjeri J.P. Woolsey T.A. Giraud L. Highstein S.M. A method to measure the effective spread of focally injected muscimol into the central nervous system with electrophysiology and light microscopy.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2002; 118: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) while monkeys performed a battery of pairwise core object discrimination subtasks, interleaved trial by trial. This paradigm allowed us not only to test the aforementioned IT-to-behavior linking hypotheses directly (Majaj et al., 2015Majaj N.J. Hong H. Solomon E.A. DiCarlo J.J. Simple learned weighted sums of inferior temporal neuronal firing rates accurately predict human core object recognition performance.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 13402-13418Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) but also to characterize the causal role of each inactivation IT site via a pattern of deficits over object recognition subtasks. Our results show that inactivation of even single, millimeter-scale regions of IT resulted in reliable contralateral-biased behavioral deficits. Interestingly, these deficits were highly selective over core object recognition subtasks—inactivating a small region of IT produced deficits in only a subset of such subtasks, and inactivating different such regions resulted in different patterns of object recognition deficits. Furthermore, the effect of inactivation was topographically organized in that the pattern of behavioral deficit (i.e., the pattern over subtasks) was most similar at anatomically neighboring injection sites. We also found that each pattern of subtask deficit was well predicted by the object discriminability of the local region’s neuronal activity. Taken together these results demonstrate the necessity of the IT cortex for a wide range of general core object recognition behaviors and reveal that—even outside of face patches—the IT cortex has behaviorally critical topographic organization of visual features. These findings are consistent with and suggested by prior physiology work (Wang et al., 1998Wang G. Tanifuji M. Tanaka K.

The organization and operation of inferior temporal cortex.Annual review of vision science. 2018; 4: 381-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar for broad spatial organization of IT), but, to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a topographically organized causal role of IT in general core object recognition. Our primary goal was to ask whether IT causally supports object recognition, and whether any such causal role is functionally specific at the millimeter scale, as schematized in Figure 1A. To do this, we reversibly inactivated individual, arbitrarily sampled millimeter-scale regions of the ventral surface of IT via injection of 1 μl of muscimol while monkeys performed a battery of pairwise core object discrimination subtasks. For this volume of injection, we expect strong neural suppression in a volume ∼2.5 mm in diameter centered at the injection site (Arikan et al., 2002Arikan R. Blake N.M.J. Erinjeri J.P. Woolsey T.A. Giraud L. Highstein S.M. A method to measure the effective spread of focally injected muscimol into the central nervous system with electrophysiology and light microscopy.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2002; 118: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Figure 1B shows the behavioral paradigm used for testing monkeys’ core object recognition behavior. In this work, the battery consisted of 6 (Monkeys 1 and 2) or 10 (Monkey 2 only) pairwise core object discrimination subtasks between five objects, interleaved trial by trial (see Figure 1A for subtask list). These subtasks were pseudo-randomly selected from the large set of pairwise discriminations that animals were previously trained on, with the explicit goal of testing “arbitrary” basic-level object recognition subtasks. To enforce true object recognition (rather than image matching), stimuli consisted of naturalistic synthetic images of 3D objects rendered under high view uncertainty (see Figure S1A for example images), and the monkey subjects were required to generalize to new images in each subtask (as we have previously shown they readily do; Rajalingham et al., 2015Rajalingham R.

Figure 2 shows the behavioral data for an example inactivation experiment in Monkey 1 for each of six pairwise discrimination subtasks. Each panel on the left shows the relative behavioral performance (mean ± SEM, obtained by bootstrap resampling over trials) for a given pairwise subtask for each of three consecutive behavioral sessions (pre-inactivation control, inactivation, and post-inactivation control; see STAR Methods). Performance on each subtask is shown relative to the average performance on that subtask over the pre- and post-control sessions; this definition of control behavior aims to be robust to natural variability in performance across behavioral sessions (see STAR Methods). The dark- and light-shaded areas correspond to one and two SEM of this measure (computed over trials), respectively. We observed a strong and significant deficit due to inactivation for some subtasks (i.e., chair versus dog, chair versus plane, and dog versus bear) but not others (elephant versus bear or dog versus elephant). The resulting pattern of behavioral deficits (i.e., the deficit pattern over subtasks) for this one example inactivation site in IT is shown on the right panel, with the corresponding anatomical location shown in the inset. Figure 3A shows the behavioral deficits for all inactivation sites and all subtasks in both monkeys as a scatter of control performance versus inactivation performance (n = 25 sites, n = 182 subtasks × sites). Considering all the subtasks together, we observed a significant decrease in performance (i.e., inactivation lower than control), corresponding to the predominance of points under the unity line in Figure 3; on average, this amounted to a global deficit of 〈Δd′〉=−0.2±0.02 (p<10−15, one-tailed exact test; see Figure 3B, red bar under “global deficit”). Additionally, we observed global changes in balanced accuracy (μ=−2%,p<10−5) and choice bias (μ=−0.23,p<10−2) (Figure S2A). Here, we focus our analyses with respect to changes in sensitivity (d′) for principled reasons (see STAR Methods). Consistent with the known lateralization of IT (Op de Beeck and Vogels, 2000Op de Beeck H. Vogels R. Spatial sensitivity of macaque inferior temporal neurons.J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 426: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), this deficit was more pronounced for images in which the center of the target object was contralateral to the injection hemisphere (〈Δd′〉=−0.26±0.03, p<10−15) than for images with ipsilateral object centers (〈Δd′〉=−0.17±0.03, p<10−11), and this difference was significant (p=0.0128, one-tailed exact test; ipsi versus contra). Note that all images were presented foveally, spanning −4° to 4° of both azimuth and elevation, and average object size was ∼3.5°. Next, we asked whether the inactivation deficits were subtask-specific. To examine this, we compared the magnitude of behavioral deficits between the least-affected and most-affected subtasks for each inactivation site. Crucially, to avoid any selection bias, these subtasks were selected from held-out data: we split our data into two disjoint halves of trials, selected the least- and most-affected subtasks per inactivation site from one split half, and examined the corresponding deficits on these selected subtasks in the second split half (thus, the expected value of the difference in deficits between the most and least affected subtask is zero under the null hypothesis; see STAR Methods). Using this procedure, we observed a large significant behavioral deficit for the most affected subtask (〈Δd′〉=−0.44±0.08, p<10−15) but not for the least-affected subtask (〈Δd′〉=−0.06±0.08, p=0.27), and the difference was significant (p<10−3; see Figure 3B). Finally, we observed even larger subtask-selective deficits when restricting to contralateral objects (as described above), with a similar significant difference between the most- and least-affected subtasks (〈Δd′〉=−0.56±0.10,−0.14±0.11 for most- and least-affected subtasks, respectively; p<10−2). For each of the analyzed conditions, we observed no significant behavioral deficits on otherwise identical experiments without muscimol inactivation (p>0.05; Figure 3B, blue bars). Furthermore, the patterns of deficits across these analyzed conditions were similar for both animals (Figure S3A). In summary, inactivation of local regions of IT resulted in highly reliable behavioral deficits, which were selective over visual space (i.e., contralateral-biased) and selective over different core object recognition subtasks. For the remaining analyses, we focus on “contralateral stimuli” (i.e., images in which the center of the target object was contralateral to the injection hemisphere) to characterize the behavioral effects of focal IT inactivation. Figure 4 shows the deficit patterns for each of the 25 individual inactivation sites, formatted as in Figure 2. We qualitatively observe that behavioral performance on one or more, but not all, object discrimination subtasks is typically reduced by inactivation of each IT site, and that the specific subtask(s) affected are different at different IT sites. The average behavioral effect over subtasks was negative (consistent with a behavioral deficit) for a significant proportion of individual sites (see Figure 4, Venn diagram; significantly negative effect: 40%,p=0.003; χ2 test for proportions). For a small and non-significant proportion of sites, we observed a positive average behavioral effect over subtasks (significantly positive effect: 4%,p=0.86, χ2 test); we speculate that this could reflect random experimental variability. Together, these results suggest that inactivating different millimeter-scale regions of primate IT results in deficits in different core object recognition subtasks (i.e., different patterns of deficits). This inference is directly and quantitatively tested in the following analyses. Figure 5A shows the subtask deficit patterns for each of the 25 inactivation sites as a heatmap. Each column corresponds to the deficit pattern over subtasks from inactivating an individual IT site, normalized to a fixed color scale (0,1); brighter colors correspond to larger relative subtask deficits. Consistent with the inferred subtask-selectivity from Figure 3B, we observed that each inactivation resulted in a non-uniform behavioral deficit pattern. This non-uniformity was quantified via a sparsity index (SI; see STAR Methods), which has a value of 0 for perfectly uniform deficit patterns (i.e., where each IT subregion is equally necessary for all subtasks), and a value of 1 for a perfectly subtask-specialized (or “one-hot”) deficit pattern (i.e., where each subregion is necessary for just one of the tested subtasks). We observed that inactivation of local regions in IT led to highly non-uniform deficit patterns, on average (SI(δ)=0.71±0.05; mean±SEM over sites, see Figure 3D). To ground this empirical SI value, we estimated the corresponding SI distributions for different simulated behavioral deficit patterns with varying degrees of non-uniformity across subtasks. These simulated deficit patterns were obtained via random permutations of our data, varying only the proportion of affected subtasks (see STAR Methods). Crucially, the simulated sparseness distributions preserved a number of key sources of variance—including the number of sites, the number of subtasks for each site, the performance on each subtask for each site, and the average performance deficit (across subtasks) for each site—because all these sources of variance were fixed for the empirical and simulated sparseness estimates, and the random shuffling was done after computing the behavioral deficits. Figure 5B shows the SI distributions expected from behavioral deficits of varying degrees of non-uniformity (i.e., with 10%,25%,…,100% of subtasks affected). We observe that the empirically observed subtask selectivity is significantly greater than expected from a uniform deficit (p<10−15; relative to simulated 100% affected, i.e., uniform) but significantly less than expected from a highly sparse deficit pattern (p<10−2; relative to simulated 10% affected). Indeed, the observed SI estimates correspond to simulation of deficits on ∼25% of tested subtasks. Importantly, this non-uniformity does not simply reflect non-uniformity in the behavioral difficulty across subtasks. Indeed, normalizing each deficit pattern by the behavioral difficulty pattern resulted in normalized deficit patterns that were not significantly correlated with subtask difficulty (r=0.06, p=0.39) and significantly non-uniform as quantified by sparsity (SI(δn)=0.74±0.06; p<10−5, relative to simulated uniform). This is also clear from Figure 5A, which shows that inactivation of different sites led to different deficit weight patterns (left panel). Accordingly, the deficits were relatively evenly distributed over the subtasks, as reflected by the approximate uniformity (except for one subtask, plane versus bear) of the average deficit pattern over all sites (Figure 5A, rightmost bar). Together, these results indicate that the non-uniformity of subtask deficits is not tied to specific subtasks. Additionally, we tested whether the deficits were evenly distributed over the five objects across all inactivation sites. To do this, we computed the pattern of deficits over objects (one-versus-all performance; see STAR Methods) for each inactivation site, then we estimated the average normalized deficit and the probability that each of the five tested objects corresponds to the most affected object per inactivation site. As shown in Figure 5C, the average normalized deficit was not significantly different across objects, and the estimated probabilities were not significantly different from chance (20%), consistent with relatively evenly distributed deficits over objects, across inactivation sites. Inactivating different anatomical regions of IT resulted in different patterns of subtask deficits. To directly test this tissue selectivity, we compared the inactivation deficit patterns between pairs of IT sites. Pairwise deficit pattern similarity was quantified using a noise-adjusted correlation (ρ˜; see STAR Methods). We considered all pairs of inactivation sites, measured within the same animal and image-set, where the inactivation deficit patterns of both sites had split-half internal reliability greater than a threshold θ (n=62 pairs for θ=0.1, but results did not significantly depend on the choice of the threshold θ). We measured the dependence of pairwise deficit similarity on the anatomical distance between the inactivation sites, where anatomical distance (d) was computed as the Euclidean distance between the injection site locations estimated via high-resolution micro-focal stereo X-ray reconstruction (see STAR Methods). First, we observed that inactivation deficits are highly replicable across experiments: the noise-adjusted correlation between behavioral deficit patterns of neighboring inactivation sites was near ceiling (ρ˜=0.92±0.03 for d<1mm, mean ± SEM over site pairs; Figure 6A). In other words, we infer that repeated inactivation of the “same” anatomical site (within a small margin of error) leads to reproducible behavior deficit patterns. This is evidenced by the similar deficit patterns for the most-closely neighboring pair of inactivation sites in each monkey (highlighted with daggers (‡) in Figure 4). Importantly, this similarity between inactivation deficit patterns did not reflect changes in behavior over time (e.g., from subtask exposure), as shown in Figure S4B. Further, we observed that this similarity between the inactivation deficits of two injection sites was monotonically related to the anatomical distance between them (Figure 6A, see Figure S3B for qualitatively similar plots in each animal separately). A simple exponential decay model (half-max-full-width HMFW=3.29±1.19mm) significantly explained this relationship (R2=0.36±0.12, p<10−3). Note that the model correlation was estimated from the raw empirical data (i.e., all 62 site pairs), and did not depend on the logarithmically spaced binning. We verified that this model correlation is not expected by chance by fitting the model on randomly"
https://openalex.org/W2920851774,"We use topological data analysis as a tool to analyze the fit of mathematical models to experimental data. This study is built on data obtained from motion tracking groups of aphids in [Nilsen et al., PLOS One, 2013] and two random walk models that were proposed to describe the data. One model incorporates social interactions between the insects via a functional dependence on an aphid’s distance to its nearest neighbor. The second model is a control model that ignores this dependence. We compare data from each model to data from experiment by performing statistical tests based on three different sets of measures. First, we use time series of order parameters commonly used in collective motion studies. These order parameters measure the overall polarization and angular momentum of the group, and do not rely on a priori knowledge of the models that produced the data. Second, we use order parameter time series that do rely on a priori knowledge, namely average distance to nearest neighbor and percentage of aphids moving. Third, we use computational persistent homology to calculate topological signatures of the data. Analysis of the a priori order parameters indicates that the interactive model better describes the experimental data than the control model does. The topological approach performs as well as these a priori order parameters and better than the other order parameters, suggesting the utility of the topological approach in the absence of specific knowledge of mechanisms underlying the data."

However, its role in metabolically active tissues that precipitate T2D development is unknown. Specifically, pancreatic β cells and adipocytes both rely heavily on mitochondrial function in the regulation of optimal glycemic control to prevent T2D, but parkin's role in preserving quality control of β cell or adipocyte mitochondria is unclear. Although parkin has been reported previously to control mitophagy, here we show that, surprisingly, parkin is dispensable for glucose homeostasis in both β cells and adipocytes during diet-induced insulin resistance in mice.

Although transient parkin deficiency mildly impaired mitochondrial turnover in β cell lines, parkin deletion in primary β cells yielded no deficits in mitochondrial clearance. In adipocyte-specific deletion models, lipid uptake and β-oxidation were increased in cultured cells, whereas adipose tissue morphology, glucose homeostasis, and beige-to-white adipocyte transition were unaffected in vivo. In key metabolic tissues where mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in T2D development, our experiments unexpectedly revealed that parkin is not an essential regulator of glucose tolerance, whole-body energy metabolism, or mitochondrial quality control.

https://openalex.org/W2921626537,"Still little is known about how spinopelvic alignment affects spinal load distribution. Musculoskeletal modeling can potentially help to discover associations between spine alignment and risk factors of spinal disorders (e.g. disc herniation, vertebral fracture, spondylolisthesis, low back pain). The present study exploited the AnyBody full-body musculoskeletal model to assess the relation between lumbar loads and spinopelvic alignment in the sagittal plane. The model was evaluated in the standing position. The simulated postures were set using spinopelvic parameters gleaned from the literature and characterizing the healthy adult population. The parameters were: sagittal vertical axis, Roussouly lumbar type, sacral slope, and pelvic incidence. A total of 2772 configurations were simulated based on the following measurements: compression force and anterior shear at levels L4L5 and L5S1; multifidus, longissimus spinae, and rectus abdominis muscle forces. Changes in global sagittal alignment, lumbar typology, and sacral inclination, but not in pelvic incidence, were found to affect intervertebral loads in the lumbar spine and spinal muscle activation. Considering these changes would be advantageous for clinical evaluation, due to the recognized relation between altered loads and risk of disc herniation, vertebral fracture, spondylolisthesis, and low back pain. Musculoskeletal modeling proved to be a valuable biomechanical tool to non-invasively investigate the relation between internal loads and anatomical parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2920951661,"Background Comprehensive care given to people living with HIV/AIDS is improving over time; however, their concurrent cognitive illness is still ignored, under screened and treated particularly in developing countries. And this problem is also striking in Ethiopia. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders and associated factors among adult people living with HIV/AIDS. Methods An institution based cross sectional study was conducted from April to May, 2017 at Gamo Gofa zone public Hospitals. International HIV Dementia Scale was used to screen HIV associated neurocognitive disorders. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess predictors of neurocognitive disorders. Result A total of 684 study participants were included in this study with a response rate of 98%. Among them, 56% were females while 44% were males. The mean (±SD) age of the participants was 38.8±8.8years. The screening prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder was 67.1% (95% CI; 63.6, 70.5). Body mass index 16 kg/m2 (AOR 4.389 (1.603–12.016)), being married (AOR 0.377 (0.213–0.666), unemployment status (AOR 3.181 (1.752–5.777) and being in WHO clinical stage T3 category/advancing stages of the disease (AOR 3.558 (1.406–9.006) were the key predictors of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders among people living with HIV/AIDS. Conclusion In this study the screening prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder is higher than the earlier reports in Ethiopia and Africa. This indicates that early screening strategies and policies for cognitive health in people living with HIV/AIDS should be given a top priority."
https://openalex.org/W2921886747,"In order to optimize environmental interventions, the current study aimed to investigate whether there are subgroups with different preferences regarding park characteristics for park visitation and park-based PA among adolescents (12–16 years). Furthermore, we examined whether the identified subgroups differed in socio-demographics, PA behavior, and park use characteristics (e.g. accompaniment to park, usual activities during park visitation, usual transportation to parks). Adolescents (12–16 years) were recruited via randomly selected secondary schools, located in Flanders (Belgium). Class visits were conducted between September and November 2016 and adolescents were asked to complete an online questionnaire. Latent class analyses using Sawtooth Software were used to identify possible subgroups. A final sample of 972 adolescents (mean age 13.3 ± 1.3 years) remained for analyses. Three subgroups of adolescents with similar preferences for park characteristics could be distinguished for both park visitation and park-based PA. Overall, current results indicate that park upkeep was the most important park characteristic for park visitation as well as park-based PA among at risk subgroups (i.e. adolescents with lower overall PA levels, girls, older adolescents,…) followed by the presence of a playground or outdoor fitness equipment. Among the more active adolescents, especially boys visiting the parks together with friends, the presence of a sport field (soccer and basketball) seems to be the best strategy to increase park visitation as well as park-based PA. Current results provide a starting point to advise policy makers and urban planners when designing or renovating parks that investing in good upkeep and maintenance of parks, and the provision of a playground or outdoor fitness equipment might be the best strategy to increase both park visitation and park-based PA among at risk adolescent subgroups."
https://openalex.org/W2903928184,"Summary Pre-mRNA splicing is executed by the spliceosome. Structural characterization of the catalytically activated complex (B∗) is pivotal for understanding the branching reaction. In this study, we assembled the B∗ complexes on two different pre-mRNAs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and determined the cryo-EM structures of four distinct B∗ complexes at overall resolutions of 2.9–3.8 A. The duplex between U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and the branch point sequence (BPS) is discretely away from the 5′-splice site (5′SS) in the three B∗ complexes that are devoid of the step I splicing factors Yju2 and Cwc25. Recruitment of Yju2 into the active site brings the U2/BPS duplex into the vicinity of 5′SS, with the BPS nucleophile positioned 4 A away from the catalytic metal M2. This analysis reveals the functional mechanism of Yju2 and Cwc25 in branching. These structures on different pre-mRNAs reveal substrate-specific conformations of the spliceosome in a major functional state."
https://openalex.org/W2920966928,"Introduction Studies on metabolomics and CKD have primarily addressed CKD incidence defined as a decline on eGFR or appearance of albuminuria in the general population, with very few evaluating hard outcomes. In the present study, we investigated the association between metabolites and mortality and ESRD in a CKD cohort. Setting and methods Data on 454 participants of the Progredir Cohort Study, Sao Paulo, Brazil were used. Metabolomics was performed by GC-MS (Agilent MassHunter) and metabolites were identified using Agilent Fiehn GC/MS and NIST libraries. After excluding metabolites present in <50% of participants, 293 metabolites were analyzed. An FDR q value <0.05 criteria was applied in Cox models on the composite outcome (mortality or incident renal replacement therapy) adjusted for batch effect, resulting in 34 metabolites associated with the outcome. Multivariable-adjusted Cox models were then built for the composite outcome, death, and ESRD incident events. Competing risk analysis was also performed for ESRD. Results Mean age was 68±12y, mean eGFR-CKDEPI was 38.4±14.6 ml/min/1.73m2 and 57% were diabetic. After adjustments (GC-MS batch, sex, age, DM and eGFR), 18 metabolites remained significantly associated with the composite outcome. Nine metabolites were independently associated with death: D-malic acid (HR 1.84, 95%CI 1.32–2.56, p = 0.0003), acetohydroxamic acid (HR 1.90, 95%CI 1.30–2.78, p = 0.0008), butanoic acid (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.17–2.15, p = 0.003), and docosahexaenoic acid (HR 0.58, 95%CI 0.39–0.88, p = 0.009), among the top associations. Lactose (SHR 1.49, 95%CI 1.04–2.12, p = 0.03), 2-O-glycerol-α-D-galactopyranoside (SHR 1.76, 95%CI 1.06–2.92, p = 0.03), and tyrosine (SHR 0.52, 95%CI 0.31–0.88, p = 0.02) were associated to ESRD risk, while D-threitol, mannitol and myo-inositol presented strong borderline associations. Conclusion Our results identify specific metabolites related to hard outcomes in a CKD population. These findings point to the need of further exploration of these metabolites as biomarkers in CKD and the understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms related to the observed associations."

The protein MSec (also known as TNFα-induced protein 2 (TNFAIP2) and B94) is essential for TNT formation in multiple cell types. Here, using affinity protein purification, mass spectrometric identification, and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy assays, we found that MSec interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone ERp29. siRNA-mediated ERp29 depletion in mammalian cells significantly reduces TNT formation, whereas its overexpression induces TNT formation, but in a strictly MSec-dependent manner. ERp29 stabilized MSec protein levels, but not its mRNA levels, and the chaperone activity of ERp29 was required for maintaining MSec protein stability. Subcellular ER fractionation and subsequent limited proteolytic treatment suggested that MSec is associated with the outer surface of the ER. The ERp29–MSec interaction appeared to require the presence of other bridging protein(s), perhaps triggered by post-translational modification of ERp29.

https://openalex.org/W2922114426,"Pathological impairment of elastic fiber and other extracellular matrix (ECM) components are described for the aortic media of ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms (aTAA) but the exact pathological impairment of the structure and its degree still needs further investigations. To evaluate the quantity and quality of elastic fiber sheets and other ECM structures (e.g. collagen), cells were removed from different types of aneurysmal tissues (tricuspid aortic valve [TAV] associated-, bicuspid aortic valve [BAV] associated-aneurysmal tissue and acute aortic dissections [AAD]) using 2.5% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and compared to decellularized control aortic tissue. Likewise, native tissue has been analysed. To evaluate the 2D- (histological evaluation, fluorescence- and auto-fluorescence based staining methods) and the 3D structure (scanning electron microscopic [SEM] examination) of the medial layer we first analysed for a successful decellularization. After proving for successful decellularization, we quantified the amount of elastic fiber sheets, elastin and other ECM components including collagen. Aside from clearly visible focal elastic fiber loss in TAV-aTAA tissue, decellularization resulted in reduction of elastic fiber auto-fluorescence properties, which is perhaps an indication from a disease-related qualitative impairment of elastic fibers, visible only after contact with the alkaline solution. Likewise, the loss of collagen amount in BAV-aTAA and TAV-aTAA tissue (compared to non-decellularized tissue) after contact with NaOH indicates a prior disease-associated impairment of collagen. Although the amount of ECM was not changed in type A dissection tissue, detailed electron microscopic evaluation revealed changes in ECM quality, which worsened after contact with alkaline solution but were not visible after histological analyses. Apart from the improved observation of the samples using electron microscopy, contact of aneurysmal and dissected tissue with the alkaline decellularization solution revealed potential disease related changes in ECM quality which can partly be connected to already published data, but have to be proven by further studies."
https://openalex.org/W2922203218,"Objectives To evaluate frequency and severity of complications after CT-guided lung biopsy using the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) classification, and to assess risk factors for overall and major complications. Materials and methods 311 consecutive biopsies with a non-coaxial semi-automated 18 gauge biopsy system were retrospectively evaluated. Complications after biopsy were classified into minor SIR1-2 and major SIR3-6. Studied risk factors for complications were patient-related (age, sex and underlying emphysema), lesion-related (size, location, morphologic characteristic, depth from the pleura and histopathology), and technique-related (patient position during procedure, thoracic wall thickness at needle path, procedure time length and number of procedural CT images, number of pleural passes, fissure penetration and needle-to-blood vessel angle). Data were analyzed using logistic and ordinal regression. Results Complications were pneumothorax and pulmonary hemorrhage. The complications were minor SIR1-2 in 142 patients (45.6%), and major SIR3-4 in 25 patients (8%). SIR5-6 complications were not present. Emphysema, smaller deeply located lesion, increased puncture time length and number of procedural CT images, multiple pleural passes and fissure puncture were significant risk factors for complication severity in univariate analysis. Emphysema (OR = 8.8, p<0.001), lesion depth from the pleura (OR = 1.9 per cm, p<0.001), and fissure puncture (OR = 9.4, p = 0.01) were the independent factors for major complications in a multiple logistic regression model. No statistical difference of complication rates between the radiologists performing biopsies was observed. Conclusions Knowledge about risk factors influencing complication severity is important for planning and performing CT-guided lung biopsies."
https://openalex.org/W2920845401,"Water-damaged housing has been associated with a number of negative health outcomes, principally respiratory disease and asthma. Much of what we know about fungi associated with water-damaged buildings has come from culture-based and immunochemical methods. Few studies have used high-throughput sequencing technologies to assess the impact of water-damage on microbial communities in residential buildings. In this study we used amplicon sequencing and quantitative-PCR to evaluate fungal communities on surfaces and in airborne dust in multiple units of a condemned public housing project located in the San Francisco Bay Area. We recruited 21 households to participate in this study and characterized their apartments as either a unit with visible mold or no visible mold. We sampled airborne fungi from dust settled over a month-long time period from the outdoors, in units with no visible mold, and units with visible mold. In units with visible mold we additionally sampled the visible fungal colonies from bathrooms, kitchens, bedrooms, and living rooms. We found that fungal biomass in settled dust was greater outdoors compared to indoors, but there was no significant difference of fungal biomass in units with visible mold and no visible mold. Interestingly, we found that fungal diversity was reduced in units with visible mold compared to units with no visible mold and the outdoors. Units with visible mold harbored fungal communities distinct from units with no visible mold and the outdoors. Units with visible mold had a greater abundance of taxa within the classes Eurotiomycetes, Saccharomycetes, and Wallemiomycetes. Colonies of fungi collected from units with visible mold were dominated by two Cladosporium species, C. sphaerospermum and C halotolerans. This study demonstrates that high-throughput sequencing of fungi indoors can be a useful strategy for distinguishing distinct microbial exposures in water-damaged homes with visible and nonvisible mold growth, and may provide a microbial means for identifying water damaged housing."
https://openalex.org/W2921130252,"ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) is a major source of nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA, a fundamental building block of carbon metabolism in eukaryotes. ACLY is aberrantly regulated in many cancers, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms determining ACLY activity and function are unclear. To this end, we investigated the role of the uncharacterized ACLY C-terminal citrate synthase homology domain in the mechanism of acetyl-CoA formation. Using recombinant, purified ACLY and a suite of biochemical and biophysical approaches, including analytical ultracentrifugation, dynamic light scattering, and thermal stability assays, we demonstrated that the C terminus maintains ACLY tetramerization, a conserved and essential quaternary structure in vitro and likely also in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the C terminus, only in the context of the full-length enzyme, is necessary for full ACLY binding to CoA. Together, we demonstrate that ACLY forms a homotetramer through the C terminus to facilitate CoA binding and acetyl-CoA production. Our findings highlight a novel and unique role of the C-terminal citrate synthase homology domain in ACLY function and catalysis, adding to the understanding of the molecular basis for acetyl-CoA synthesis by ACLY. This newly discovered means of ACLY regulation has implications for the development of novel ACLY modulators to target acetyl-CoA–dependent cellular processes for potential therapeutic use."
https://openalex.org/W2921180114,"A longstanding question in ecology concerns the prediction of the fate of mountain species under climate change, where climatic and geomorphic factors but also endogenous species characteristics are jointly expected to control species distributions. A significant step forward would single out reliably landscape effects, given their constraining role and relative ease of theoretical manipulation. Here, we address population dynamics in ecosystems where the substrates for ecological interactions are mountain landscapes subject to climate warming. We use a minimalist model of metapopulation dynamics based on virtual species (i.e. a suitable assemblage of focus species) where dispersal processes interact with the spatial structure of the landscape. Climate warming is subsumed by an upward shift of species habitat altering the metapopulation capacity of the landscape and hence species viability. We find that the landscape structure is a powerful determinant of species survival, owing to the specific role of the predictably evolving connectivity of the various habitats. Range shifts and lags in tracking suitable habitat experienced by virtual species under warming conditions are singled out in different landscapes. The range of parameters is identified for which these virtual species (characterized by comparable viability thus restricting their possible fitnesses and niche widths) prove unable to cope with environmental change. The statistics of the proportion of species bound to survive is identified for each landscape, providing the temporal evolution of species range shifts and the related expected occupation patterns. A baseline dynamic model for predicting species fates in evolving habitats is thus provided."
https://openalex.org/W2921820891,"Background Malaria reduction and future elimination in China is made more difficult by the importation of cases from neighboring endemic countries, particularly Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, and increased travel to Africa by Chinese nationals. The increasing prevalence of artemisinin resistant parasites across Southeast Asia highlights the importance of monitoring the parasite importation into China. Artemisinin resistance in the Mekong region is associated with variants of genes encoding the K13 kelch domain protein (pf13k), found in specific genetic backgrounds, including certain alleles of genes encoding the chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) and multidrug resistance transporter PgH1 (pfmdr1). Methods In this study we investigated the prevalence of drug resistance markers in 72 P. falciparum samples from uncomplicated malaria infections in Tengchong and Yingjiang, counties on the Yunnan-Myanmar border. Variants of pf13k, pfcrt and pfmdr1 are described. Results Almost all parasites harboured chloroquine-resistant alleles of pfcrt, whereas pfmdr1 was more diverse. Major mutations in the K13 propeller domain associated with artemisinin resistance in the Mekong region (C580Y, R539T and Y493H) were absent, but F446I and two previously undescribed mutations (V603E and V454I) were identified. Protein structural modelling was carried out in silico on each of these K13 variants, based on recently published crystal structures for the K13 propeller domain. Whereas F446I was predicted to elicit a moderate destabilisation of the propeller structure, the V603E substitution is likely to lead to relatively high protein instability. We plotted these stability estimates, and those for all previously described variants, against published values for in vivo parasitaemia half-life, and found that quadratic regression generates a useful predictive algorithm. Conclusion This study provides a baseline of P. falciparum resistance-associated mutations prevalent at the China-Myanmar border. We also show that protein modelling can be used to generate testable predictions as to the impact of pfk13 mutations on in vivo (and potentially in vitro) artemisinin susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2921823255,"Lactisole, an inhibitor of the human sweet taste receptor, has a 2-phenoxypropionic acid skeleton and has been shown to interact with the transmembrane domain of the T1R3 subunit (T1R3-TMD) of the receptor. Another inhibitor, 2,4-DP, which shares the same molecular skeleton as lactisole, was confirmed to be approximately 10-fold more potent in its inhibitory activity than lactisole; however the structural basis of their inhibitory mechanisms against the receptor remains to be elucidated. Crystal structures of the TMD of metabotropic glutamate receptors, which along with T1Rs are categorized as class C G-protein coupled receptors, have recently been reported and made it possible to create an accurate structural model for T1R3-TMD. In this study, the detailed structural mechanism underlying sweet taste inhibition was characterized by comparing the action of lactisole on T1R3-TMD with that of 2,4-DP. We first performed a series of experiments using cultured cells expressing the sweet taste receptor with mutations and examined the interactions with these inhibitors. Based on the results, we next performed docking simulations and then applied molecular dynamics-based energy minimization. Our analyses clearly revealed that the (S)-isomers of both lactisole and 2,4-DP, interacted with the same seven residues in T1R3-TMD and that the inhibitory potencies of those inhibitors were mainly due to stabilizing interactions mediated via their carboxyl groups in the vertical dimension of the ligand pocket of T1R3-TMD. In addition, 2,4-DP engaged in a hydrophobic interaction mediated by its o-Cl group, and this interaction may be chiefly responsible for the higher inhibitory potency of 2,4-DP."
https://openalex.org/W2921980284,"The burgeoning cannabis market requires evidence-based science such that farmers can quickly and efficiently generate new plants. In part, horticultural operations are limited by the success of cloning procedures. Here, we measured the role of environmental conditions and cultivar identity on the success of generating long branch material with many meristems in planting stock (mothers) and in rooting success of stem-derived clones. To evaluate the influence of lighting treatments on the optimal production of branching mothers, four lighting conditions (Fluorescent High Output T5s [T5], Metal halide lamps [MH], Plasma lamps [PL], or Metal halide lamps augmented with far red LED lights [MH+FR]) were applied to two cultivars of container grown plants (Cannabis sativa L. 'Bubba Kush', 'Ghost Train Haze') grown in peat-based organic substrates in mylar grow tents. To evaluate the influence of lighting, cutting tool (secateurs or scalpels), and stem wounding (present/absent) on optimal rooting of stems, three lighting conditions (Fluorescent T8s, T5, PL) were applied to three cultivars of peat pellet grown plants (C. sativa L. 'Bubba Kush', 'Ghost Train Haze', 'Headband'). Mothers grown under T5 and MH (vs MH+FR) produced ~30% more meristems. However, growing mothers under MH+FR were 19% taller than mothers under T5, with ~25% longer internodes on dominant stems than plants under any other lighting condition. Canopies were denser under T5 because petiole length was ~30% shorter under T5 and fan leaves were longer and narrower under MH+FR and MH+FR and PL, respectively, than under other lighting conditions. Cultivar Ghost Train Haze stems rooted most frequently and most quickly. Wounded stems were 162% more likely to root than unwounded stems and rooted 1.5 days earlier. Our results will guide producers attempting to maximize the rate of clone production in licensed facilities; although results may differ among cultivars, where cultivars differed in their average phenotype as mother plants, and their propensity to root from cuttings, and the speed with which they produced those roots."
https://openalex.org/W2922189871,"Purpose Perfusion and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide important biomarkers for brain tumor analysis. Our aim was to investigate if regions of increased perfusion or tumor with restricted diffusion on the immediate post-operative MRI examination would be predictive of time to tumor progression in patients with high-grade gliomas. Materials and methods Twenty-three patients with high-grade gliomas were retrospectively analyzed. We measured the perfusion at the resection area and evaluated the presence or absence of the restricted diffusion in residual tumor masses. The associations of the perfusion, diffusion and contrast enhancement (delayed static enhancement (DSE)) characteristics with time to tumor progression were statistically calculated. We also evaluated if the location of the tumor progression was concordant to the areas of the elevated perfusion, tumor type restricted diffusion and enhancement. Results Patients with >200 days to progression are more likely to have no elevated relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) ratio (p = 0.0004), no tumor restriction (p = 0.024), and no DSE (p = 0.052). The elevated mean rCBV ratio (p<0.001) and tumor type restricted diffusion (p = 0.002) were significantly associated with a higher risk of progression. All cases with rCBV ratio of >1.5 progressed in 275 days or earlier. Tumors tended to progress at the area where patients with post-operative MRIs showed elevated perfusion (p = 0.006), tumor-type restricted diffusion (p = 0.005) and DSE (p = 0.008). Conclusions Post-operative analysis of rCBV, tumor type restricted diffusion and enhancement characteristics are predictive of time to progression, risk of progression and where tumor progression is likely to occur."
https://openalex.org/W2921178623,"During 2018, four free-ranging conures, from a naturalized flock in San Francisco, presented with a characteristic set of neurologic signs that had been reported in other individuals from this flock. The cause of morbidity or mortality in historic cases has not been identified. From these four subjects, fresh feces were collected during their initial days of hospitalization and submitted to the University of Georgia Infectious Diseases Laboratory and Center for Applied Isotope Studies for bromethalin and desmethyl-bromethalin quantitation. Using High Performance Liquid Chromatography, the laboratory detected bromethalin, a non-anticoagulant, single-dose rodenticide, in fecal samples from three subjects; half of these samples were also positive for desmethyl-bromethalin, bromethalin’s active metabolite. In three subjects that died, the UGA laboratory screened brain and liver samples and found bromethalin in all samples; desmethyl-bromethalin was detected in all but one brain sample, which was below the detection limit. Our findings suggest the conures are more resistant to bromethalin than are other species in which bromethalin has been studied, and/or that the conures may be ingesting the toxin at a sublethal dose. More data is needed to better assess the long-term effects of bromethalin on animals exposed at the subacute/chronic levels, and also to better understand the compartmentalization of bromethalin and desmethyl-bromethalin in a wider variety of species."
https://openalex.org/W2921833366,"Eating Disorders (ED) have been associated with dysfunctional coping strategies, such as rumination. Promoting alternative ways of experiencing mental events, based on a mindfulness approach, might be the clue for learning more effective coping and regulatory strategies among young women with ED. This study examined the comparison between patients with ED diagnosis and healthy subjects in mindfulness, rumination and effective coping. In addition, we analyzed the independent association of those with the presence of ED. The study sample was formed by two groups of young women ranged 13-21 years: Twenty-five with an ED diagnosis and 25 healthy subjects. They were assessed by using the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI) and the Responses Styles Questionnaire (RSQ). Our findings show that ED patients have significantly lesser average scores in mindfulness and effective coping than the healthy sample (p < .05). Also, our data concludes that mindfulness and effective coping independently predict the presence or absence of ED in young women. The study results suggest that training mindfulness abilities may contribute to making effective coping strategies more likely to occur in ED patients, which is incompatible with some eating-related symptoms. Further studies are needed, trough prospective and experimental designs, to evaluate clinical outcomes of mindfulness training among young women with ED."
https://openalex.org/W2950478872,"PURPOSE: The aim was to determine effects of diluent monomer and monocalcium phosphate monohydrate (MCPM) on polymerization kinetics and volumetric stability, apatite precipitation, strontium release and fatigue of novel dual-paste composites for vertebroplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Polypropylene (PPGDMA) or triethylene (TEGDMA) glycol dimethacrylates (25 wt%) diluents were combined with urethane dimethacrylate (70 wt%) and hydroxyethyl methacrylate (5 wt%). 70 wt% filler containing glass particles, glass fibers (20 wt%) and polylysine (5 wt%) was added. Benzoyl peroxide and MCPM (10 or 20 wt%) or N-tolyglycine glycidyl methacrylate and tristrontium phosphate (15 wt%) were included to give initiator or activator pastes. Commercial PMMA (Simplex) and bone composite (Cortoss) were used for comparison. ATR-FTIR was used to determine thermal activated polymerization kinetics of initiator pastes at 50-80°C. Paste stability, following storage at 4-37°C, was assessed visually or through mixed paste polymerization kinetics at 25°C. Polymerization shrinkage and heat generation were calculated from final monomer conversions. Subsequent expansion and surface apatite precipitation in simulated body fluid (SBF) were assessed gravimetrically and via SEM. Strontium release into water was assessed using ICP-MS. Biaxial flexural strength (BFS) and fatigue properties were determined at 37°C after 4 weeks in SBF. RESULTS: Polymerization profiles all exhibited an inhibition time before polymerization as predicted by free radical polymerization mechanisms. Initiator paste inhibition times and maximum reaction rates were described well by Arrhenius plots. Plot extrapolation, however, underestimated lower temperature paste stability. Replacement of TEGDMA by PPGDMA, enhanced paste stability, final monomer conversion, water-sorption induced expansion and strontium release but reduced polymerization shrinkage and heat generation. Increasing MCPM level enhanced volume expansion, surface apatite precipitation and strontium release. Although the experimental composite flexural strengths were lower compared to those of commercially available Simplex, the extrapolated low load fatigue lives of all materials were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Increased inhibition times at high temperature give longer predicted shelf-life whilst stability of mixed paste inhibition times is important for consistent clinical application. Increased volumetric stability, strontium release and apatite formation should encourage bone integration. Replacing TEGDMA by PPGDMA and increasing MCPM could therefore increase suitability of the above novel bone composites for vertebroplasty. Long fatigue lives of the composites may also ensure long-term durability of the materials."

Strategies targeting the preservation of cartilage function are needed. Laser acupuncture (LA) can be an emerging alternative therapy for RA; however, its molecular mechanism underlying the beneficial effect on cartilage has not been elucidated. This study aimed to examine the potential chondroprotective effects of LA on extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecules and proinflammatory cytokines in the articular cartilage of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats and explore its related mechanisms. Design Monoarthritis was induced in adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (250–300 g) via intraarticular injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) into the tibiotarsal joint. Animals were treated with LA at BL60 and KI3 acupoints three days after CFA administration with a 780 nm GaAlAs laser at 15 J/cm2 daily for ten days. The main outcome measures including paw circumference, paw withdrawal threshold, histopathology and immunoassays of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), collagen type II (CoII), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) were analyzed. Results LA significantly reduced ankle edema and inflammation-induced hyperalgesia in AIA rats (P < 0.05). Moreover, the TNF-α levels were significantly decreased while CoII, COMP and proteoglycans proteins were significantly enhanced following LA stimulation of the AIA cartilage compared to those treated with sham-LA (P < 0.05). Conclusions LA attenuates cartilage degradation in AIA rat by suppressing TNF-α activation and up-regulating ECM macromolecules, suggesting LA might be of potential clinical interest in RA treatment."

However, the intracellular route and the molecular mechanisms that control TAPL localization remain unclear. Here, we delineated the route of TAPL to lysosomes and investigated the determinants of single trafficking steps. By synchronizing trafficking events by a retention using selective hooks (RUSH) assay and visualizing individual intermediate steps through immunostaining and confocal microscopy, we demonstrate that TAPL takes the direct route to lysosomes.

The selection pressures in this environment have spurred the evolution of a complex reservoir of microbial genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes).

Here, using synthetic substrates and biochemical assays, we show that BT0997 targets the d-galacturonic acid-α-1,2-l-rhamnose linkage in chain A of RGII and that it absolutely requires the presence of a second d-galacturonic acid side chain (linked β-1,3 to l-rhamnose) for activity. NMR analysis revealed that BT0997 operates through a double displacement retaining mechanism. We also report the crystal structure of a BT0997 homolog, BPA0997 from Bacteroides paurosaccharolyticus, in complex with ligands at 1.6 Å resolution.

This fiber is in the form of plant glycans ingested by the host, which are then degraded by members of the HGM and utilized as a primary source of carbon. Competition within the HGM is intense, and bacteria of this community, such as those of the Bacteroidetes phyla, have evolved elaborate and complex mechanisms in the form of polysaccharide utilization loci (PUL) to acquire and degrade glycans. PULs are a set of colocalized and coregulated genes that are dedicated to degrade a target glycan (7Martens E.C. Lowe E.C. Chiang H. Pudlo N.A. Wu M. McNulty N.P. Abbott D.W. Henrissat B.

In a previous study, we showed that BT0997 is a new family of α-1,2-d-galacturonidase specifically targeting the d-galacturonic acid (GalA)-α-1,2-l-rhamnose (Rha) contained within chain A of RGII (Fig. 1A). It was also demonstrated that BT0997 was inactive on intact RGII and was only active after chain A (10Ndeh D. Rogowski A. Cartmell A. Luis A.S. Baslé A. Gray J. Venditto I. Briggs J. Zhang X. Labourel A. Terrapon N. Buffetto F. Nepogodiev S. Xiao Y. Field R.A. et al.Complex pectin metabolism by gut bacteria reveals novel catalytic functions.Nature. 2017; 544 (28329766): 65-7010.1038/nature21725Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) was released from the backbone by an endo acting polysaccharide lyase 1 (PL1) and concomitant removal of both α-l-galactose by BT1010 and β-d-glucuronic acid by BT0996 from the top of chain A. After this initial degradation, BT0997 is then able to act and its action is required for further degradation of chain A. The mechanism of substrate recognition displayed by the enzyme, however, remained unclear. In the present study, we used synthetic substrates (Fig. 1, B and C) and showed that BT0997 recognizes the second β-linked GalA as an absolute specificity determinant. The enzyme was inactive on SN909 which only contains one of the two GalA residues (d-GalA-α-1,2-l-Rha-α-1,4-l-Fucose) whereas it displayed full activity against SN908, the doubly GalA decorated rhamnose substrate (d-GalA-α-1,2-l-Rha-β-1,3-d-GalA). A comparable activity was observed on G2RAX, a hexasaccharide produced by the growth of the deletion mutant Δbt0997 on RGII. The absence of BT0997 means that the α-1,2-d-GalA can no longer be cleaved, preventing the full digestion of chain A, leading to the accumulation of the hexasaccharide G2RAX in the growth media. These data suggest that BT0997 has three subsites, a −1 subsite where the GalA linked α-1,2 to Rha binds; a +1 subsite where Rha is situated; and finally a +2NR subsite where the second GalA β-1,3 linked to Rha binds (Table 1) (subsite nomenclature of GHs is such that bond cleavage occurs between the −1 and +1 subsites with the catalytic apparatus being housed at the −1 subsite. Subsites then increase in number, +2, +3 etc. toward the reducing end of the glycan and decrease in number, −2, −3 etc. toward the nonreducing end of the glycan). As BT0997 was the founding member of a new GH family (GH138) we endeavored to reveal its catalytic mechanism. GHs typically operate through two catalytic mechanisms: an inverting mechanism, which is a single displacement reaction causing inversion of the anomeric configuration of the product compared with the substrate, or a retaining mechanism that is a double displacement reaction proceeding via a covalent intermediate, causing retention of the anomeric configuration in the products, with respect to the substrate (Fig. 2). The 1H NMR spectra of the synthetic substrate SN910 were recorded prior to and at intervals after the addition of BT0997. This allowed the monitoring of the stereochemical course of the reaction and is shown in Fig. 2. After 1 min of incubation a doublet at about 5.22 ppm, assigned to H-1α of GalA (12Pitson S.M. Mutter M. van den Broek L.A. Voragen A.G. Beldman G. Stereochemical course of hydrolysis catalysed by α-l-rhamnosyl and α-d-galacturonosyl hydrolases from Aspergillus aculeatus.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242 (9464254): 552-55910.1006/bbrc.1997.8009Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), appeared and rapidly increased in intensity. Later in the incubation a small doublet at 4.5 ppm, because of H-1β of GalA, became noticeable and is from the mutarotation of the initially formed α-anomer. Therefore, the data clearly indicate that BT0997 catalyzes the hydrolysis of d-GalA-α1,2-l-Rha linkages at the nonreducing end of the oligosaccharide with retention of the anomeric configuration.Table 1Kinetic parameters of BT0997 and BPA0997 against RGII oligosaccharides Open table in a new tab Figure 21H NMR spectra of SN910 treated with BT0997 in D2O.

WP_024993800 from B. paurosaccharolyticus (BPA0997), a homologue that shares 70% identity with BT0997, displayed the same specificity as BT0997 and also had maximal activity on Rha decorated with both α-1,2– and β-1,3–linked GalA. BPA0997 produced two peaks when purified by size-exclusion chromatography, corresponding to a monomeric and dimeric state (Fig. S1). Protein corresponding to the monomeric state was carried forward into crystallographic trials. As BT0997 and BPA0997 are the founding members of the GH138 family, no corresponding structure was available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The structure of BPA0997 was solved by selenomethionine (SeMet), single wavelength anomalous X-ray scattering to a resolution of 2.00 Å (Table 2) (PDB code 6NZF). The SeMet protein crystallized in the primitive space group P212121 and had two molecules in the asymmetric unit. BPA0997 is composed of four domains (Fig. 3). The N-terminal domain (ND1; residues 23–132) is made up of a five-stranded mixed β sheet with two parallel α helices beneath the sheet. The fifth β strand of the ND1 continues into the catalytic TIM barrel domain (D2; residues 133–468), which has a central barrel of eight β strands, 3–10, and is spiraled around by α helices 1–8. The third domain (D3; residues 469–724) comprises seven α helices, 11–17, which bundle together and run antiparallel to each other. Finally, the C-terminal domain (CD4; residues 725–893) presents a β-sandwich fold.Table 2Kinetic parameters of BPA0997 wildtype and mutants against G2RAX Open table in a new tab ND1 makes few interactions with the TIM barrel domain and displays higher average B-factors compared with the rest of the domains. Hydrophobic and polar contacts are made, however, between Phe-86, Tyr-107, and Glu-111 from ND1 and Trp-485 and Arg-183, respectively, from the TIM barrel domain. The interface area between ND1 and D2 is 827.5 Å2. The D3 α helical bundle domain interacts with the TIM barrel through apolar interactions: Phe-485, Phe-482, and Trp-478 from helix 11 and Tyr-500 and Pro-508 from helix 12, with Trp-401, Pro-404, and Phe-406 from α helix 9 and Trp-454 and Tyr-463 from α helix 10 of the TIM barrel. These extensive interactions are reflected in the total surface interface of 2510.2 Å2. The CD4 domain makes almost no interactions with the TIM barrel but sits on its top, burying a surface area of 504.8 Å2. The CD4 domain appears to “lock” into the active site with an extended loop (Arg-814–Ser-820) that would prevent substrate binding. A glutamate, Glu-816, in the extended loop makes polar interactions with Arg-521 and His-542 forming a potentially “ionic lock” that secures the CD4 domain over the active site (Fig. 3, B and C). It is also possible that the location of the CD4 domain over the anterior surface of the TIM barrel is a consequence of the crystal packing. Indeed, the C-terminal linking loop makes close contacts with its symmetry-related copy resulting in the CD4 domain occluding the active site. Additionally, the CD4 domain makes contact with the helical domain of a symmetry-related mate. Thus, considering that BPA0997 displays activity in solution and that only few interactions occur between the catalytic domain and the CD4 domain, it is possible that out of the crystal context, the CD4 domain is mobile and could be involved in substrate recognition instead of preventing substrate binding. Despite the active site’s being blocked by the CD4 domain both a serine, in the SeMet structure (which comes from the crystallization condition and is not biologically relevant so will not be discussed further), and a GalA, in the full-length E361S inactive mutant (cocrystallization with GalA) can be observed in the −1 active site, Fig. 3. These data suggest that the CD4 domain could close over a covalently bound GalA in the −1 subsite. As discussed earlier, the recognition of the β-1,3 Rha–linked GalA at the +2NR subsite is crucial for enzyme activity. To identify the key residues responsible for this feature, a BPA0997-G2RAX complex was necessary. However, the loop from the CD4 domain is likely to prevent the binding of G2RAX by blocking the active site in the crystal context. Thus, a C-terminally truncated version, eliminating residues 719–893 of BPA0997 (BPA0997ΔCT), was designed. This mutant enzyme displayed the same catalytic efficiency on G2RAX as the full-length enzyme (Table 1). Crystals of the inactive mutant BPA0997ΔCTE361S showed that the protein crystallized in the space group P22121 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Some crystals were thus soaked with a mixture of G2RAX and GRAX containing no free GalA (see “Materials and methods” for substrate generation and purification) and a 1.6 Å resolution structure was obtained. Although a complex was observed, only two GalA residues could be reliably built. The −1 GalA adopts both α and β anomers, whereas the +2NR GalA, which is partially disordered, could only be modeled as the β anomer. The O1 positions of the −1 α-GalA and the +2NR β-GalA are well-positioned to be connected to the O2 and O3 of Rha, respectively (Fig. S2). There is some density suggesting a glycosidic linkage from the +2NR GalA to Rha but not for the Rha molecule itself. Also, there is no evidence of a connection between the −1 GalA and the Rha. This suggests that BPA0997ΔCTE361S had retained some residual catalytic activity against G2RAX and is likely bound to GalA and GRAX. The GRAX cannot be reliably built into the observed electron density, however, because of disorder. Superimposition of the full-length native protein with BPA0997ΔCTE361S, reveals that Glu-361 (sitting atop β strand 4) sits 3.5 Å from the anomeric carbon of the −1 GalA sugar and is therefore the perfect candidate to be the catalytic nucleophile. Glu-294 (sitting atop β strand 6), on the other hand, is located at ∼3 Å away from O1 of the −1 GalA and therefore should be fulfilling the role of the catalytic acid/base. Glu-361 and Glu-294 are ∼5.7 Å apart which is well in line with the expected ∼5.5 Å for catalytic residues in retaining enzymes. Their catalytic role is confirmed by the observation that the BPA0997 mutants E294S, E294Q, E361S, and E361Q are inactive when assayed biochemically (Table 2 and Fig. S3). The GalA at −1 makes several other interactions, mainly via its carboxylic acid group, forming a bidentate ionic interaction with Arg-332. Lys-357 and Tyr-241 also interact with the carboxylic acid with Lys-357 making a potential hydrogen bond to the endocyclic oxygen. Mutation of Arg-332 or Lys-357 to an alanine completely abolishes enzymatic activity, emphasizing the importance of these positively charged residues. The −1 GalA interacts with Oδ1 and NH2 of Asn-520 via O2 and O3, respectively. The axial O4 of the −1 GalA, which is the unique chiral position of GalA, interacts with His-391 via Nε2. Mutation of this residue to an alanine completely knocks out catalytic capability of the enzyme. The effect of Tyr-241 is less detrimental, but still significant, suffering an ∼72-fold loss in activity. There is a partially disordered GalA occupying what will be termed the +2NR subsite. Occupation of this subsite is critical for enzymatic activity and the interaction with the protein seems to be dominated by the carboxylic acid group forming a bidentate interaction with Arg-521. Additional interactions are potentially made by Thr-517 and Glu-518 with O3 and O4, respectively; however, the electron density for this part of the sugar is weak and may be reflective of the relative contribution of these interactions compared with Arg-521. Circular dichroism was performed on the inactive mutants with the data demonstrating they were properly folded (Fig. S4). Thus, inactivity was because of loss of the amino acid side chain in these mutants (Table 2). Also, in the vicinity of the active site is a chloride anion which is coordinated by NH1 and NH2 of Arg-332, Nδ2 of Asn-389, and a water molecule (Fig. 4). This is in agreement with the coordination sphere of the majority of the chloride anions observed in the protein crystal structures deposited in the PDB (13Carugo O. Buried chloride stereochemistry in the Protein Data Bank.BMC Struct. Biol. 2014; 14 (25928393): 1910.1186/s12900-014-0019-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Chloride anions have previously been observed to play an important role in the action of α-amylases. The anion binds to a common site close in the vicinity of the active site where it assists in the reaction mechanism (14Aghajari N. Feller G. Gerday C. Haser R. Structural basis of α-amylase activation by chloride.Protein Sci. 2002; 11 (12021442): 1435-144110.1110/ps.0202602Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As Arg-332 and Asn-389 are two highly conserved residues (Figure 4, Figure 5), we wanted to know whether the chloride anion present in BPA0997 is essential for catalytic activity. We attempted to remove NaCl from BPA0997 by gel filtration using 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, as the buffer, a method described previously (15Feller G. Bussy O. Houssier C. Gerday C. Structural and functional aspects of chloride binding to Alteromonas haloplanctis α-amylase.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (8798613): 23836-2384110.1074/jbc.271.39.23836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The reaction on G2RAX was subsequently performed post gel filtration in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, with no chloride added. The enzyme was still active (data not shown) suggesting that the anion is not required for catalytic activity or that the anion is too tightly bound to be removed by the method described above. Sequence alignments of the top 500 results returned from Blastp, using BT0997 as the input sequence, reveal that all but 21 sequences show conservation of the catalytic residues Glu-294 and Glu-361, the acid/base and nucleophile, respectively. In addition the two arginine residues Arg-332 and Arg-521, which coordinate the carboxylic acid groups of the −1 and +2NR GalA residues and are required for activity, are also invariant in these 479 sequences (Fig. 5). These two arginine residues are likely the key specificity determinants for GH138 enzymes in targeting GalA residues in double substitutions. This demonstrates that BT0997 is very well-conserved in organisms where it is found, and therefore its function. The observation that three sequences retain both catalytic residues and Arg-332 but not Arg-521 may suggest that these protein sequences encode catalytically active enzymes but target residues where only one acidic sugar substitutes the +1 residue. The one sequence, which retains both catalytic amino acids, but neither of the basic arginines, may encode an enzyme targeting neutral sugars at the −1 subsite. BT0997 and BPA0997 are well-conserved in the PULs of RGII-degrading organisms, suggesting it is an important part of the degradative apparatus. Indeed, the genetic knockout of bt0997 in Bt causes degradation of chain to cease at the point of the target linkage causing the undigested hexasaccharide, G2RAX from chain A, to be left over in the growth media (10Ndeh D. Rogowski A. Cartmell A. Luis A.S. Baslé A. Gray J. Venditto I. Briggs J. Zhang X. Labourel A. Terrapon N. Buffetto F. Nepogodiev S. Xiao Y. Field R.A. et al.Complex pectin metabolism by gut bacteria reveals novel catalytic functions.Nature. 2017; 544 (28329766): 65-7010.1038/nature21725Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). There are examples where multiple decorations of sugar residues cause a specific stereochemical blockage to cleavage of the glycosidic bond of the sugar to which they are appended also. This requires the evolution of enzymes that are specifically targeted to these residues. BT0997 and its homologues are part of a small number of glycoside hydrolases that have evolved to address this problem. The ability to target these residues usually places the requirement that both of the decorating sugars are required for activity and creates a more open active site cavity. This has resonance with the AXHd3, an arabinofuranosidase from Humicola insolens that specifically targets the α-1,3-l-arabinofuranose residues on doubly decorated xylose (16McKee L.S. Peña M.J. Rogowski A. Jackson A. Lewis R.J. York W.S. Krogh K.B. Viksø-Nielsen A. Skjøt M. Gilbert H.J. Marles-Wright J. Introducing endo-xylanase activity into an exo-acting arabinofuranosidase that targets side chains.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109 (22492980): 6537-654210.1073/pnas.1117686109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The enzyme, analogous to BT0997, requires both the α-1,3-l-arabinofuranose and α-1,2 substitutions to be active but only cleaves the α-1,3 linkage. A Dali search using the BPA0997ΔCT showed no significant structural homologs in the PDB database. The top three results were a GH67 (PDB code 1K9E), GH115 (PDB code 4C91) and a GH20 (PDB code 4C7D), with the best result (GH67) having only 11% identity, a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 3.6 Å over 499 residues and a Z-score of only 18.7. These three enzymes also utilize different mechanisms to the GH138 with GH67 and GH115 utilizing an inverting mechanism whereas GH20 operates through a substrate-assisted mechanism. These data point to very little ancestry between the top hits from the Dali search and GH138 enzymes. GH67, however, also contains ND1 and a domain similar to D3 but lacks the CD4 domain. A Dali search was also run with ND1, D3, and CD4 individually. ND1 matches the N-terminal domains of several other GH67 members, with PDB code 1LN8 being the best match with a RMSD of 1.8 Å, an identity of 20% but a Z-score of only 13.6. The D3 domain best matched PDB code 2R03 which is involved in apoptosis and adopts a similar, extended, α helical fold. The Dali results, however, were poor, having an RMSD of 2.7 Å, an identity of 6%, and a Z-score of 9.4. The CD4 domain returns some evidence for similar folds in several other CAZyme families. Again the similarities were low with an RMSD of 3.1 Å, an identity of 8%, and a Z-score of 3.6. Further inspection of the overlays of these three structures with BPA0997 reveals that there are no gross similarities between the active sites; however, some commonalities can be observed with GH67. GH67 is predominantly xylan α-1,2-d-glucuronidases and Arg-318 is invariantly conserved when a Blastp is performed using PDB code 1K9E. This residue corresponds to Arg-332 in BPA0997. This demonstrates that GH67 and GH138 coordinate the carboxylic acids, glucuronic acid and GalA, respectively, in the same manner. The catalytic nucleophile Glu-361 also is spatially similar to the Asp-364 in GH67, but Asp-364 likely acts as a catalytic acid. The structure of the BPA0997 revealed a TIM barrel fold, a common tertiary fold observed in many GH families and particularly in the clan A class of enzymes. BPA0997 constitutes a new family and is not part of clan A as the catalytic residues are not found on β strands 4 and 7, but rather β strands 4 and 6, of the central barrel and the catalytic acid is not part of the NEP/HEP motif found in clan A enzymes (17Zhang Y. Ju J. Peng H. Gao F. Zhou C. Zeng Y. Xue Y. Li Y. Henrissat B. Gao G.F. Ma Y. Biochemical and structural characterization of the intracellular mannanase AaManA of Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius reveals a novel glycoside hydrolase family belonging to clan GH-A.J. Biol.

Presumably, if its evolutionary origins are distinct, and as other members are discovered in the future, it may form part of a new clan. The same may be said of the other three domains. These are not new folds but the poor values from the Dali search may imply very distant evolutionary relationships or again evolving from unique progenitor sequences. The role of the CD4 domain remains ambiguous as no effect on catalytic activity, and presumably stability, was observed with its removal. However, such ionic locks securing loop conformers in CAZymes have been observed before, notably in the recently discovered PL27 and CjMan26C where removal of these features heavily impacted enzyme function (18Cartmell A. Topakas E. Ducros V.M. Suits M.D. Davies G.J. Gilbert H.J. The Cellvibrio japonicus mannanase CjMan26C displays a unique exo-mode of action that is conferred by subtle changes to the distal region of the active site.J. Biol.

It is plausible that the effects of removing the CD4 domain could be masked by measuring only the kcat/Km against G2RAX (because of limited substrate full kinetic parameters could not be derived). Although G2RAX and the CD4 domain cannot occupy the same space, the CD4 domain may close over the covalently bound −1 GalA and concomitantly drive departure of the leaving group helping to create a closed microenvironment for the second stage of catalysis. This would then require the CD4 domain to move out of the active site before the −1 GalA could depart and allow a new catalytic cycle. Thus, removal of the CD4 domain would lose this “microenvironment” but could allow the −1 GalA to dissociate faster at the end of the catalytic cycle. This could raise both the Km and kcat by commensurate levels and thus no effect could be observed measuring only kcat/Km. This is a limitation when substrate is bespoke and limited. This study describes the first structural and mechanistic analysis of GH138, characterizing the proteins BT0997 and BPA0997. Both enzymes target the l-Rha-α-1,2-d-GalA linkage contained within chain A of RGII. The enzymes target, and require, rhamnose that is double substituted with GalA using two invariant arginines to drive specificity, performing catalysis through a double displacement, retaining, mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2921919452,"Glucose metabolism is altered in injured and healing tendons. However, the mechanism by which the glucose metabolism is involved in the pathogenesis of tendon healing process remains unclear. Injured tendons do not completely heal, and often induce fibrous scar and chondroid lesion. Because previous studies have shown that tendon progenitors play roles in tendon repair, we asked whether connective tissue progenitors appearing in injured tendons alter glucose metabolism during tendon healing process. We isolated connective tissue progenitors from the human injured tendons, obtained at the time of primary surgical repair of rupture or laceration. We first characterized the change in glucose metabolism by metabolomics analysis using [1,2-13C]-glucose using the cells isolated from the lacerated flexor tendon. The flux of glucose to the glycolysis pathway was increased in the connective tissue progenitors when they proceeded toward tenogenic and chondrogenic differentiation. The influx of glucose to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and biosynthesis of amino acids from the intermediates of the TCA cycle were strongly stimulated toward chondrogenic differentiation. When we treated the cultures with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), an inhibitor of glycolysis, 2DG inhibited chondrogenesis as characterized by accumulation of mucopolysaccharides and expression of AGGRECAN. Interestingly, 2DG strongly stimulated expression of tenogenic transcription factor genes, SCLERAXIS and MOHAWK under both chondrogenic and tenogenic differentiation conditions. The findings suggest that control of glucose metabolism is beneficial for tenogenic differentiation of connective tissue progenitors."

This study sought to understand the incidence and spectrum of germline mutations in Asian patients with suspected HBC in a clinic setting.1056 patients with suspected HBC were seen in our Cancer (CA) Genetics Clinic from 2000-2017, of which 460 underwent genetic testing.Of 460 probands tested, 93% were female, 61% Chinese, 90% had prior CA, with 19% (77/414) having ≥2 primary CA. Median age at CA-diagnosis was 43y (17-83); 70% had Breast CA (BC) and 25% Ovarian CA (OC). 34% had young-onset BC, 8% bilateral BC, and 4% BC/OC. Majority had family history of BC (53%) or OC (20%). 57% underwent multigene testing (14-49 genes), 34% targeted testing, and 8% predictive testing. 30% were found to have a pathogenic mutation: 80% in BRCA1/2 (8 novel mutations noted). Of 33 non-BRCA1/2 pathogenic mutations detected, 61% were in 11 BC genes while 39% were in non-BC genes suggestive of alternative CA syndromes. Testing beyond BRCA1/2 impacted management for 15.9% (22/138) of carriers, but extensive testing identified variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in up to 44.5% of probands. Restricting multigene panel testing to a guideline-based 20-gene panel including Lynch Syndrome genes was found to be most optimal, detecting 94.6% of mutation carriers while reducing VUS rate to 21.5%.Evolution of CA Genetics testing strategy to a multigene approach facilitated detection of pathogenic mutations in non-BRCA1/2 genes and aided management. Guideline-based panel testing is feasible and can be offered in Asians with suspected HBC."
https://openalex.org/W2922290322,"Understanding seasonality of tuberculosis (TB) epidemics may lead to identify potentially modifiable risk factors. Studies conducted outside Japan have found seasonal variation among reported TB cases, with peaks in spring and summer and low prevalence in fall and winter. One hypothesis regarding spring or summer peaks in TB epidemics is that TB transmission likely increases in winter because of indoor crowding and poor ventilation, with development of primary TB among socially vulnerable people in spring and summer. Another plausible explanation is that vitamin D deficiency in winter depresses immunity, increasing the TB reactivation risk in these seasons. Previous studies suggest latitude-dependent factors, including reduced winter sunlight and its effect on vitamin D levels. Here, we investigated mechanisms of seasonality in TB epidemics in Japan, according to the effects of crowding and latitude.We used time-series analysis consisting of spectral analysis and least-squares method, to analyse geographically specific monthly number of newly registered cases of all forms of active TB in all 47 prefectures of Japan during 1998-2015.In all power spectral densities for the 47 prefectures, spectral lines were observed at frequency positions corresponding to a 1-year cycle. The degree of this seasonality was associated with population density. We did not detect greater amplitude of seasonality at higher latitudes, suggesting that latitude-dependent factors, including reduced winter sunlight and its potential effect on vitamin D levels, do not contribute significantly to seasonality in Japan.In districts with high population density, measures are needed to address two specific types of active infection risk in adolescents and middle-aged adults: (i) public transport use, and (ii) irregular employment with no periodic medical examinations. To control active TB epidemics, investigating periodic structures in the temporal patterns of active TB in each district and each age group is important."

Methods Data on patients with LSS (n = 14,298) were collected from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database from 2005 to 2007. After 8 years of follow-up, a “DM group” (n = 3,478) and a “non-DM group” (n = 10,820) were compared according to outcome measures. Cox proportional hazard regressions were performed to examine the relationship between DM, hypertension (HTN), cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), cerebrovascular disease (CbVD), and surgery for LSS. The admission rate and medical cost as well asthe overall survival rate for those who underwent lumbar surgery were also assessed among patients with DM and LSS. Results Mortality was about 1.35 times higher in the DM group than in the non-DM group. Patients with DM and comorbidities including HTN (hazard ratio [HR], 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25–1.56; p<0.001), CVD (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.36–1.73; p<0.001), CKD (HR, 3.18; 95% CI, 2.7–3.76; p<0.001), and CbVD (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.49–1.91; p<0.001) showed an increased risk of mortality. The mean hospitalization time and average medical cost of patients with DM who underwent lumbar surgery were 60.8 days, and 7,127 USD, respectively. This was 31.3 days longer, and 6,207 USD higher, respectively, than those of patients with DM who underwent conservative treatment for LSS. Within the DM group, the survival rate of surgical management of LSS had a significant tendency for positive prognosis compared with those administered conservative treatment (p = 0.046). Conclusions In patients with LSS, DM was associated both with poor prognosis (most significantly in those with CKD), and increased medical cost in those who underwent surgery. Nevertheless, surgical treatment for LSS in patients with DM was related to favorable prognosis compared with conservative treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2951132718,"Scale insects (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha: Coccomorpha) are key pests of agricultural crops and ornamental plants worldwide. Their populations are difficult to control, even with insecticides, due to their cryptic habits. Moreover, there is growing concern over the use of synthetic pesticides for their control, due to deleterious environmental effects and the emergence of resistant populations of target pests. In this context, biological control may be an effective and sustainable approach. Hymenoptera Chalcidoidea includes natural enemies of scale insects that have been successfully used in many biological control programs. However, the correct identification of pest scale species and their natural enemies is particularly challenging because these insects are very small and highly specialized. Integrative taxonomy, coupling DNA barcoding and morphological analysis, has been successfully used to characterize pests and natural enemy species. In this study, we performed a survey of parasitoids and predators of armored and soft scales in Chile, based on 28S and COI barcodes. Fifty-three populations of Diaspididae and 79 populations of Coccidae were sampled over the entire length of the country, from Arica (18°S) to Frutillar (41°S), between January 2015 and February 2016. The phylogenetic relationships obtained by Bayesian inference from multilocus haplotypes revealed 41 putative species of Chalcidoidea, five Coccinellidae and three Neuroptera. Species delimitation was confirmed using ABGD, GMYC and PTP model. In Chalcidoidea, 23 species were identified morphologically, resulting in new COI barcodes for 12 species and new 28S barcodes for 14 species. Two predator species (Rhyzobius lophantae and Coccidophilus transandinus) were identified morphologically, and two parasitoid species, Chartocerus niger and Signiphora bifasciata, were recorded for the first time in Chile."
https://openalex.org/W2921167896,"Background and purpose Vestibular input is projected to ""multisensory (vestibular) cortex"" where it converges with input from other sensory modalities. It has been assumed that this multisensory integration enables a continuous perception of state and presence of one’s own body. The present study thus asked whether or not vestibular stimulation may impact this perception. Methods We used an immersive virtual reality setup to realistically manipulate the length of extremities of first person biometric avatars. Twenty-two healthy participants had to adjust arms and legs to their correct length from various start lengths before, during, and after vestibular stimulation. Results Neither unilateral caloric nor galvanic vestibular stimulation had a modulating effect on the perceived size of own extremities. Conclusion Our results suggest that vestibular stimulation does not directly influence the explicit somatosensory representation of our body. It is possible that in non-brain-damaged, healthy subjects, changes in whole body size perception are principally not mediated by vestibular information. Alternatively, visual feedback and/or memory may dominate multisensory integration and thereby override possibly existing modulations of body perception by vestibular stimulation. The present observations suggest that multisensory integration and not the processing of a single sensory input is the crucial mechanism in generating our body representation in relation to the external world."
https://openalex.org/W2922218372,"Introduction Informal family caregivers play an increasingly important role in healthcare. Despite their role in ongoing management and coordination of care, caregiver satisfaction with the healthcare services care recipients receive has been understudied. We sought to assess what influences caregiver satisfaction with inpatient care provided to their care recipient among caregivers of veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and polytrauma. Methods Data from the Family and Caregiver Experience Survey, a national survey of caregivers of veterans with TBI and polytrauma, was used to explore factors associated with caregiver satisfaction with the care his/her care recipient received while an inpatient at a US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center. Caregiver and care recipient demographic and injury factors and potential addressable factors including social support, caregiver training received, and caregiver perceptions of being valued by the VA were evaluated for their associations with caregivers’ satisfaction with their care recipients’ healthcare. Results The majority of the 524 caregivers reported being mostly or very satisfied with their care recipient’s inpatient care (75%, n = 393). Higher satisfaction with inpatient care was significantly associated with greater caregiver social support, receipt of training from the VA, and perceptions of being valued by the VA, both on univariate analysis and after controlling for care recipient TBI severity and caregiver’s relationship to the care recipient. Conclusions Results suggest that supporting a strong social network for caregivers, providing caregiver training, and employing practices that communicate that family caregiving is valued by providers and healthcare organizations are promising avenues for improving caregiver satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W2921629006,"A growing body of evidence implicates the mycobacterial capsule, the outermost layer of the mycobacterial cell envelope, in modulation of the host immune response and virulence of mycobacteria. Mycobacteria synthesize the dominant capsule component, α(1→4)-linked glucan, via three interconnected and potentially redundant metabolic pathways. Here, we report the crystal structure of the Mycobacterium smegmatis TreS:Pep2 complex, containing trehalose synthase (TreS) and maltokinase (Pep2), which converts trehalose to maltose 1-phosphate as part of the TreS:Pep2–GlgE pathway. The structure, at 3.6 Å resolution, revealed that a diamond-shaped TreS tetramer forms the core of the complex and that pairs of Pep2 monomers bind to opposite apices of the tetramer in a 4 + 4 configuration. However, for the M. smegmatis orthologues, results from isothermal titration calorimetry and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments indicated that the prevalent stoichiometry in solution is 4 TreS + 2 Pep2 protomers. The observed discrepancy between the crystallized complex and the behavior in the solution state may be explained by the relatively weak affinity of Pep2 for TreS (Kd 3.5 μm at mildly acidic pH) and crystal packing favoring the 4 + 4 complex. Proximity of the ATP-binding site in Pep2 to the complex interface provides a rational basis for rate enhancement of Pep2 upon binding to TreS, but the complex structure appears to rule out substrate channeling between the active sites of TreS and Pep2. Our findings provide a structural model for the trehalose synthase:maltokinase complex in M. smegmatis that offers critical insights into capsule assembly.

A key role in this finely tuned host–pathogen interaction is played by various components of the complex mycobacterial cell wall, notably lipoarabinomannan and phosphatidylinositol-anchored mannan (1Mishra A.K.

Compared with these immunomodulatory cell wall components, the mycobacterial capsule has received relatively little attention. Yet, increasing evidence points to a role of the capsule in immune modulation and virulence. For instance, destruction of the capsule by sonication promotes phagocytosis ex vivo (2Stokes R.W.

How the capsule is synthesized and assembled is only partially understood. The capsule material is predominantly made of α-glucan (80–90%), alongside other key components, including arabinomannan (10–20%) and proteins of the ESX-1 secretion system (7Sani M. Houben E.N.

In a previous study, we had described the crystal structure of trehalose synthase (TreS) of M. tuberculosis (14Roy R. Usha V. Kermani A. Scott D.J. Hyde E.I. Besra G.S. Alderwick L.J. Fütterer K.

In the same study, we showed that TreS, which interconverts trehalose and maltose (15De Smet K. Weston A. Brown I. Young D. Robertson B.

In a fourth reaction step, GlgB introduces α(1→6)-branching of α(1→4)-linked glucan chains (17Garg S.K. Alam M.S. Kishan K.V. Agrawal P.

However, they have been shown to form synthetic lethal interactions with glycosyltransferase Rv3032 (which synthesizes linear α-glucan from UDP-glucose) and thus appear to occupy an important metabolic node (11Kalscheuer R.

The TreS:Pep2 complex of M. tuberculosis contains a tetramer of TreS and four copies of Pep2, with an overall mass of 490 kDa (14Roy R. Usha V. Kermani A. Scott D.J. Hyde E.I. Besra G.S. Alderwick L.J. Fütterer K. Synthesis of α-glucan in mycobacteria involves a hetero-octameric complex of trehalose synthase TreS and maltokinase Pep2.ACS Chem. Biol. 2013; 8 (23901909): 2245-225510.1021/cb400508kCrossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). TreS and Pep2 can work independently, but we observed that when M. tuberculosis TreS is added to the M. tuberculosis Pep2-catalyzed phosphorylation of maltose, Pep2 activity increased markedly (14Roy R. Usha V. Kermani A. Scott D.J. Hyde E.I. Besra G.S. Alderwick L.J. Fütterer K. Synthesis of α-glucan in mycobacteria involves a hetero-octameric complex of trehalose synthase TreS and maltokinase Pep2.ACS Chem. Biol. 2013; 8 (23901909): 2245-225510.1021/cb400508kCrossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This raised the question by what mechanism TreS is able to affect the catalytic activity of Pep2 and/or whether substrate channeling may be part of the TreS:Pep2 interaction. To help address these questions, we undertook the crystallization of the TreS:Pep2 complex. Crystals of the M. tuberculosis complex failed to provide useful diffraction patterns, whereas diffraction data could be obtained with crystals of the orthologues from M. smegmatis, diffracting to a resolution of 3.6 Å. The complex of M. smegmatis (Msm) TreS:Pep2 crystallized readily, but crystals of appropriate quality only grew over a narrow pH range (pH 6.7 to 7.0). The structure was phased by molecular replacement and refined to a resolution of 3.6 Å (Fig. 2 and Table S1). Given the limited resolution, noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints were applied. The core of the assembly is the previously reported TreS tetramer (Fig. 2A) (14Roy R. Usha V. Kermani A. Scott D.J. Hyde E.I. Besra G.S. Alderwick L.J. Fütterer K. Synthesis of α-glucan in mycobacteria involves a hetero-octameric complex of trehalose synthase TreS and maltokinase Pep2.ACS Chem. Biol. 2013; 8 (23901909): 2245-225510.1021/cb400508kCrossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the diamond-shaped TreS tetramer, the β-sandwich domains of the TreS subunits are paired up and constitute the “top” (chains A and B) and “bottom” apex (chains C and D) of the diamond (Fig. 2A). In the hetero-octameric TreS:Pep2 complex, pairs of Pep2 monomers straddle across the β-sandwich domains of the TreS tetramer in a clamp-like fashion (Fig. 2B). We refer to this assembly as the 4 + 4 complex, which measures ∼175 Å in its long dimension, ∼125 Å across, and ∼90 Å in depth. Pep2 appears to dimerize on the TreS tetramer, but the contact surface between the Pep2 monomers is small compared with the contact surface with TreS (see Fig. 2C), suggesting they bind independently as monomeric copies. The asymmetric unit (ASU) of the crystal lattice contains two copies of the TreS:Pep2 complex (complexes 1 and 2), which display differences in terms of subunit orientation and level of disorder. For instance, when superimposing the TreS tetramers of complexes 1 (chains A–D) and 2 (chains E–H) onto the structure of stand-alone M. smegmatis TreS (PDB code 3ZO9 (19Caner S. Nguyen N. Aguda A.

The structure of the Mycobacterium smegmatis trehalose synthase reveals an unusual active site configuration and acarbose-binding mode.Glycobiology. 2013; 23 (23735230): 1075-108310.1093/glycob/cwt044Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)), the average displacement (RMSD) of Cα atoms is very small for complex 1 (0.45 Å for 2243 aligned Cα atoms) but considerably larger for complex 2 (RMSD of 3.4 Å, 2175 aligned Cα atoms). The origins of this mismatch are rotations of the TreS protomers relative to each other, evident by altered gaps between the subunits' molecular surfaces when oriented according the alignment described above and by changes of the distances between the substrate-binding sites of up to about 6 Å (Fig. S1). The backbone of Pep2 shows various levels of disorder across the eight protomers in the ASU. In complex 1 (Pep2 chains I–L, Fig. 2B), the backbone of Pep2 could be traced over 436 of the 441 residues for three subunits (chains I, J, and L), but residues 1–86 are largely disordered in the fourth subunit (chain K). In complex 2 (Pep2 chains M–P), only one copy of Pep2 (chain M) could be traced fully, whereas residues 1–194 were disordered in chains N, O, and P. The structural model of Msm Pep2 in the present complex structure is completely defined by electron density bar two residues of the N-terminal sequence and 4–5 residues at the C terminus. Despite the moderate resolution, the density displays sufficient detail to dock the Pep2 amino acid sequence onto the backbone structure, aided in part by the recent structures of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) and Mycobacterium vanbaalenii (Mvb) Pep2 (20Fraga J.

The Pep2 structure shows the prototypical two-lobe architecture of phosphotransferase enzymes of PFAM family PF01636.

Guillerm G. Howell P.L. Structures of 5-methylthioribose kinase reveal substrate specificity and unusual mode of nucleotide binding.J. Biol.

However, in Pep2 the N-terminal lobe includes a novel β-sheet at the N terminus (β1–β3), which appears to be unique for mycobacterial Pep2 enzymes, and is missing in structural neighbors identified by distance matrix alignment (DALI (23Holm L. Rosenström P. Dali server: conservation mapping in 3D.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38 (20457744): W545-W54910.1093/nar/gkq366Crossref PubMed Scopus (3053) Google Scholar)), including methylribose kinase. In contrast, the seven-stranded β-sheet preceding the C-terminal lobe (β6–β12) is conserved. We refer to the latter as the canonical β-sheet, although it includes two additional nonconserved strands (β6 and β7) at its N terminus (Fig. 3C). The unique three-stranded β-sheet, which is preceded by a two-turn α-helix, is visible in only a subset of Pep2 protomers (Fig. 3, A and C), with density lacking between the N terminus and helix α3 (corresponding to residues 1–88) in four of eight Pep2 protomers. Superimposing the Pep2 copies (chains I, J, L, and M), which could be fully traced, with respect to residues 198–400 of the C-terminal lobe results in a close match for the canonical β-sheet of the N-terminal lobe, but it reveals considerable conformational flexibility for the unique β-sheet with a rotation of ∼28° between the two extreme conformers about the “hinge residue” Leu-86 (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, we note that the domain swap seen in the structure of Mtb Pep2 (21Li J. Guan X. Shaw N. Chen W. Dong Y. Xu X. Li X. Rao Z. Homotypic dimerization of a maltose kinase for molecular scaffolding.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 (25245657): 6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) involves strands of the canonical β-sheet (Fig. 3E). The functional role of the unique β-sheet in Pep2 is not immediately evident from the structure. The nucleotide-binding site resides in the N-terminal lobe, whereas maltose binds opposite to the nucleotide in a pocket of the C-terminal lobe (Fig. 3A) (21Li J. Guan X. Shaw N. Chen W. Dong Y. Xu X. Li X. Rao Z. Homotypic dimerization of a maltose kinase for molecular scaffolding.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 (25245657): 6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Superimposing Pep2 with the ATP-bound structure of Mvb Pep2 (PDB code 4WZY (20Fraga J. Maranha A. Mendes V. Pereira P.J. Empadinhas N. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Structure of mycobacterial maltokinase, the missing link in the essential GlgE-pathway.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 (25619172): 802610.1038/srep08026Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)) suggests that residues in the unique region of the N-terminal lobe do not directly contact the nucleotide, but one might expect that perturbations of this part of the structure affect nucleotide binding and potentially activity (see “Discussion”). Given that TreS and Pep2 catalyze consecutive reaction steps in the GlgE pathway, it has been suggested that products of the TreS-catalyzed reaction may be channeled directly to the active site of Pep2 (21Li J. Guan X. Shaw N. Chen W. Dong Y. Xu X. Li X. Rao Z. Homotypic dimerization of a maltose kinase for molecular scaffolding.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 (25245657): 6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, no such path or channel between the active sites of TreS and Pep2 is apparent in the complex structure. The linear distance from the active site of TreS (chain A) to the nearest maltose-binding site of Pep2 (chain J) measures about 53 Å and traverses the C-terminal lobe of Pep2 (Fig. 2D and Fig. S3). The next nearest maltose-binding site (chain I) is 63 Å away, and this time the direct line crosses the hydrophobic core of TreS, again without an obvious opening or tunnel. Within the complex, the active sites of TreS and Pep2 are both open to solvent and do not face each other (Fig. 2D), suggesting that following release from TreS, maltose needs to diffuse through solvent on the way to the active site of Pep2. Pep2 forms intimate contacts with the TreS tetramer, revealing a high level of shape complementarity between the binding partners (Fig. 4A). Complex formation buries about 1200 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface per monomer. The footprint of a single Pep2 subunit covers surface areas belonging to two TreS protomers, including and extending beyond the C-terminal β-sandwich domain(s) (Fig. 4B). Both lobes of Pep2 contribute to the contact surface, but the C-terminal lobe provides the lion share (Fig. 4C and Fig. S2). Where parts of the N-terminal lobe are disordered, the C-terminal lobe accounts for all observed contacts. Secondary structure elements contributing to the binding interface are helices α5, α6, and α10 in the C-terminal lobe of Pep2, and contacts made by the N-terminal lobe include residues in helix α2, in strand β8, and in the β9–β10 loop (Fig. 4C). In addition, contacts also involve the β12–α5 loop, which links the N- and C-terminal lobes. The binding interface is dominated by van der Waals and hydrophobic contacts, corresponding to ∼70% of surface area buried in the interface per Pep2 monomer. In addition, eight hydrogen bonds and two salt bridges (TreS–Arg-312:Pep2–Asp-228 and TreS–Arg-534:Pep2–Asp-218) complement the noncovalent interactions (Table S2). The binding interface shares structural elements with the nucleotide-binding site, based on the superposition with the ATP-bound structure of Mvb Pep2 (PDB code 4WZY (20Fraga J. Maranha A. Mendes V. Pereira P.J. Empadinhas N. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Structure of mycobacterial maltokinase, the missing link in the essential GlgE-pathway.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 (25619172): 802610.1038/srep08026Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)) (Fig. S3). According to this superposition, we predict several residues to make contacts with ATP that are part of (or right next to) the binding interface with TreS. Residues in the maltose-binding site (derived from the superposition with maltose-bound Mtb Pep2 (PDB code 4O7P (21Li J. Guan X. Shaw N. Chen W. Dong Y. Xu X. Li X. Rao Z. Homotypic dimerization of a maltose kinase for molecular scaffolding.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 (25245657): 6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar)) make no direct contacts with TreS. We had previously investigated the stoichiometry of the complex formed by the M. tuberculosis orthologues and found, by analytical ultracentrifugation in equilibrium mode, that the complex encompasses 4 + 4 subunits (Mr ∼490,000) (14Roy R. Usha V. Kermani A. Scott D.J. Hyde E.I. Besra G.S. Alderwick L.J. Fütterer K. Synthesis of α-glucan in mycobacteria involves a hetero-octameric complex of trehalose synthase TreS and maltokinase Pep2.ACS Chem. Biol. 2013; 8 (23901909): 2245-225510.1021/cb400508kCrossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, purified Mtb Pep2 eluted from a size-exclusion resin as a mix of species (monomers, dimers, and higher oligomers) (14Roy R. Usha V. Kermani A. Scott D.J. Hyde E.I. Besra G.S. Alderwick L.J. Fütterer K. Synthesis of α-glucan in mycobacteria involves a hetero-octameric complex of trehalose synthase TreS and maltokinase Pep2.ACS Chem. Biol. 2013; 8 (23901909): 2245-225510.1021/cb400508kCrossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), in contrast to the essentially single-peak elution of monomeric Msm Pep2 (Fig. S4). We therefore wished to ascertain whether the self-association behavior affected complexation with TreS. We initially probed the assembly of the Msm TreS:Pep2 complex by size-exclusion chromatography. As was observed previously for the M. tuberculosis orthologues, addition of Pep2 to TreS leads to a shift of the TreS tetramer peak to shorter retention times, suggesting complex formation (Fig. S4). We also noticed that the association of Msm TreS and Pep2 was pH-dependent. Between pH 7 and 8, the position of the complex peak moved to longer retention times, whereas the absorbance signal corresponding to the Pep2 monomer increased (Fig. S4). In accordance with the stronger association between TreS and Pep2 at mildly acidic pH, the best diffracting crystals were obtained at reservoir pH values between 6.7 and 7.0. To determine the affinity between Msm TreS and Pep2, we measured binding by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), buffering with phosphate, and titrating Pep2 to TreS up to a molar ratio [Pep2]/[TreS] of about 1.5. Setting the initial concentration of TreS at 75 μm, we measured binding isotherms at 25 °C at pH 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5 (Table 1 and Fig. 5A). Fit"
https://openalex.org/W2921814258,"This paper addresses the problem of energy management of mixed criticality applications in a multi-core partitioned architecture. Instead of focusing on new scheduling algorithms to adjust frequency in order to save energy, we propose a partition to CPU allocation that takes into account not only the different frequencies at which the CPU can operate but the level of criticality of the partitions. The goal is to provide a set of pre-calculated allocations, called profiles, so at run time the system can switch to different modes depending on the battery level. These profiles achieve different levels of energy saving and performance applying different strategies. We also present a comparison in terms of energy saving of the most used bin-packing algorithms for partition allocation. As this is an heuristic, it is not possible to ensure that our results involve the minimum energy consumption. For this reason, we also provide a comparison with a exact method, such as constraint programming."
https://openalex.org/W2921913233,"Background While normal pelvic organ support has been defined for women with intact uterus, this is not the case for post- hysterectomy vault descent. A recent systematic review found that definitions of apical prolapse are highly variable. Objectives To investigate the relationship between prolapse symptoms and apical POP-Q measurements and establish cutoffs for ‘significant apical descent using receiver–operator characteristics (ROC) statistics. Study design Retrospective analysis of patients seen at a tertiary urogynecological unit. Evaluation included a standardized interview and clinical assessment using the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system. ROC curves were prepared for the relationship between prolapse symptoms and POP-Q measure “C”. Results The records of 3010 women were available for analysis. Prolapse symptoms were reported by 52.3% (n = 1573), with a mean bother of 5.9 (SD 3.0, range 0–10). POP-Q point “C” was associated with symptoms of prolapse (p <0.0001) and prolapse bother (p <0.0001) on both univariate and multivariate analysis. ROC curves for women with and without uterus were similar, although the relationship between apical descent and symptoms of prolapse was stronger for women with uterus (AUC 0.728 versus 0.678). After controlling for multi-compartment prolapse, the models improved, resulting in AUCs of 0.782 and 0.720. For prediction of prolapse symptoms, cutoffs were set at C = -5 (sensitivity 0.73, specificity 0.67 with uterus in situ, sensitivity 0.59, specificity, 0.73 after hysterectomy). Conclusion A cut- off for ‘significant central compartment descent’ of 5 cm above the hymen on Valsalva seems valid regardless of previous hysterectomy."
https://openalex.org/W2922157483,"The recognition potential (RP) is an early visually evoked response (~250 ms) whose magnitude is sensitive to object recognizability and related factors. The RP is often measured when objects are embedded in a rapid stream of masking stimuli (the RSS paradigm), especially in reading research. The idea is that RSS provides greater stimulus-dependent variations in RP, compared to the corresponding variations without RSS. However, this idea has never been subject to systematic evaluation. We directly test whether RSS can enhance 2 types of RP stimulus selectivity, by measuring the RP in conditions that only differ in the presence or absence of a masking stream and in the type of stimulus shown. We measure the effect of image inversion on RP for Chinese characters (experiment 1); the effect of orthographical correctness on RP for Chinese characters (experiment 3); and as a control study, the effect of image inversion on the N170 response to faces (experiment 2). To ensure a fair comparison, the earliest negative deflections (RP/N170) measured with and without RSS should at least have similar channel ranges, and topographical distributions of both amplitude and selectivity. Our first set of results clearly supports this. Our main results clearly show an increase in stimulus-selectivity for RSS over non-RSS in both of the RP (Chinese character) experiments, but no such enhancement in the N170 (face) experiment. This provides incentive for investigations into the underlying mechanisms of selectivity enhancement. Our findings may also help to explain contradictory findings between RP/N170 studies that differ only in the use of noise masks, which is sometimes treated as trivial detail in papers that do not reference the RP/RSS literature."
https://openalex.org/W2897905881,"Non-native, early-successional plants have been observed to maintain dominance for decades, particularly in semi-arid systems. Here, two approaches were used to detect potentially slow successional patterns in an invaded semi-arid system: chronosequence and direct observation. Plant communities in 25 shrub-steppe sites that represented a 50-year chronosequence of agricultural abandonment were monitored for 13 years. Each site contained a field abandoned from agriculture (ex-arable) and an adjacent never-tilled field. Ex-arable fields were dominated by short-lived, non-native plants. These ‘weedy’ communities had lower species richness, diversity and ground cover, and greater annual and forb cover than communities in never-tilled fields. Never-tilled fields were dominated by long-lived native plants. Across the chronosequence, plant community composition remained unchanged in both ex-arable and never-tilled fields. In contrast, 13 years of direct observation detected directional changes in plant community composition within each field type. Despite within-community changes in both field types during direct observation, there was little evidence that native plants were invading ex-arable fields or that non-native plants were invading never-tilled fields. The more-controlled, direct observation approach was more sensitive to changes in community composition, but the chronosequence approach suggested that these changes are unlikely to manifest over longer time periods, at least in part because of disturbances in the system. Results highlight the long-term consequences of soil disturbance and the difficulty of restoring native perennials in disturbed semi-arid systems."
https://openalex.org/W2921330733,"In many scientific studies, the underlying data-generating process is unknown and multiple statistical models are considered to describe it. For example, in a factorial experiment we might consider models involving just main effects, as well as those that include interactions. Model-averaging is a commonly-used statistical technique to allow for model uncertainty in parameter estimation. In the frequentist setting, the model-averaged estimate of a parameter is a weighted mean of the estimates from the individual models, with the weights typically being based on an information criterion, cross-validation, or bootstrapping. One approach to building a model-averaged confidence interval is to use a Wald interval, based on the model-averaged estimate and its standard error. This has been the default method in many application areas, particularly those in the life sciences. The MA-Wald interval, however, assumes that the studentized model-averaged estimate has a normal distribution, which can be far from true in practice due to the random, data-driven model weights. Recently, the model-averaged tail area Wald interval (MATA-Wald) has been proposed as an alternative to the MA-Wald interval, which only assumes that the studentized estimate from each model has a N(0, 1) or t-distribution, when that model is true. This alternative to the MA-Wald interval has been shown to have better coverage in simulation studies. However, when we have a response variable that is skewed, even these relaxed assumptions may not be valid, and use of these intervals might therefore result in poor coverage. We propose a new interval (MATA-SBoot) which uses a parametric bootstrap approach to estimate the distribution of the studentized estimate for each model, when that model is true. This method only requires that the studentized estimate from each model is approximately pivotal, an assumption that will often be true in practice, even for skewed data. We illustrate use of this new interval in the analysis of a three-factor marine global change experiment in which the response variable is assumed to have a lognormal distribution. We also perform a simulation study, based on the example, to compare the lower and upper error rates of this interval with those for existing methods. The results suggest that the MATA-SBoot interval can provide better error rates than existing intervals when we have skewed data, particularly for the upper error rate when the sample size is small."
https://openalex.org/W2922049841,"Prior to Hurricane Isaac making landfall along the Gulf of Mexico coast in August 2012, local and state officials were concerned that the hurricane would mobilize submerged oiled-materials from the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) spill. In this study, we investigated materials washed ashore following the hurricane to determine if it affected the chemical composition or density of oil-containing sand patties regularly found on Gulf Coast beaches. While small changes in sand patty density were observed in samples collected before and after the hurricane, these variations appear to have been driven by differences in sampling location and not linked to the passing of Hurricane Isaac. Visual and chemical analysis of sand patties confirmed that the contents was consistent with oil from the Macondo well. Petroleum hydrocarbon signatures of samples collected before and after the hurricane showed no notable changes. In the days following Hurricane Isaac, dark-colored mats were also found on the beach in Fort Morgan, AL, and community reports speculated that these mats contained oil from the DWH spill. Chemical analysis of these mat samples identified n-alkanes but no other petroleum hydrocarbons. Bulk and δ13C organic carbon analyses indicated mat samples were comprised of marshland peat and not related to the DWH spill. This research indicates that Hurricane Isaac did not result in a notable change the composition of oil delivered to beaches at the investigated field sites. This study underscores the need for improved communications with interested stakeholders regarding how to differentiate oiled from non-oiled materials. This is especially important given the high cost of removing oiled debris and the increasing likelihood of false positives as oiled-materials washing ashore from a spill become less abundant over time."
