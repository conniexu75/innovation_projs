https://openalex.org/W2032562864,"Increases in intracellular calcium concentration are required for the release of neurotransmitter from presynaptic terminals in all neurons. However, the mechanism by which calcium exerts its effect is not known. A low-sensitivity calcium-dependent photoprotein (n-aequorin-J) was injected into the presynaptic terminal of the giant squid synapse to selectively detect high calcium concentration microdomains. During transmitter release, light emission occurred at specific points or quantum emission domains that remained in the same place during protracted stimulation. Intracellular calcium concentration microdomains on the order of 200 to 300 micromolar occur against the cytoplasmic surface of the plasmalemma during transmitter secretion, supporting the view that the synaptic vesicular fusion responsible for transmitter release is triggered by the activation of a low-affinity calcium-binding site at the active zone."
https://openalex.org/W2163864783,"Fractionation of extracts from human cell lines allows nucleotide excision repair of damaged DNA to be resolved into discrete incision and polymerization stages. Generation of incised intermediates depends on the XP-A protein, a polypeptide that recognizes sites of damaged DNA, and on the human single-stranded DNA-binding protein HSSB. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is required for the DNA synthesis that converts the nicked intermediates to completed repair events. This need for PCNA implies that repair synthesis is carried out by DNA polymerase δ or ε. The ability to visualize repair intermediates in the absence of PCNA facilitates dissection of the multiprotein reaction that leads to incision of damaged DNA in a major pathway of cellular defense against mutagens."
https://openalex.org/W2065014822,"The crystal structure of the beta subunit (processivity factor) of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme has been determined at 2.5 A resolution. A dimer of the beta subunit (M(r) = 2 x 40.6 kd, 2 x 366 amino acid residues) forms a ring-shaped structure lined by 12 alpha helices that can encircle duplex DNA. The structure is highly symmetrical, with each monomer containing three domains of identical topology. The charge distribution and orientation of the helices indicate that the molecule functions by forming a tight clamp that can slide on DNA, as shown biochemically. A potential structural relationship is suggested between the beta subunit and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, the eukaryotic polymerase delta [and epsilon] processivity factor), and the gene 45 protein of the bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W2043471865,"The neu/HER-2 proto-oncogene (also called erbB-2) encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. We have purified to homogeneity a 44 kd glycoprotein from the medium of ras-transformed cells that stimulates phosphorylation of the Neu protein and retains activity after elution from the polyacrylamide gel. The protein is active at picomolar concentrations and displays a novel N-terminal sequence. Cross-linking experiments with radiolabeled p44 result in specific labeling of Neu, indicating that p44 is a ligand for Neu or a related receptor. The purified protein induces phenotypic differentiation of cultured human breast cancer cells, including altered morphology and synthesis of milk components. This is accompanied by an increase in nuclear area, inhibition of cell growth (probably by cell cycle arrest at the late S or the G2/M phases), and induction of DNA polyploidy. We propose the name Neu differentiation factor (NDF) for p44."
https://openalex.org/W2090737490,Population genetic analyses that depend on the assumption of neutrality for allozyme markers are used widely. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms in nuclear DNA of the American oyster evidence a pronounced population subdivision concordant with mitochondrial DNA. This finding contrasts with a geographic uniformity in allozyme frequencies previously thought to reflect high gene flow mediated by the pelagic gametes and larvae. The discordance likely is due to selection on protein electrophoretic characters that balances allozyme frequencies in the face of severe constraints to gene flow. These results raise a cautionary note for studies that rely on assumptions of neutrality for allozyme markers.
https://openalex.org/W2165469800,"Gorlin syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that predisposes to basal cell carcinomas of the skin, ovarian fibromas, and medulloblastomas. Unlike other hereditary disorders associated with cancer, it features widespread developmental defects. To investigate the possibility that the syndrome is caused by mutation in a tumor suppressor gene, we searched for loss of heterozygosity in 16 sporadic basal cell carcinomas, 2 hereditary basal cell carcinomas, and 1 hereditary ovarian fibroma and performed genetic linkage studies in five Gorlin syndrome kindreds. Eleven sporadic basal cell carcinomas and all 3 hereditary tumors had allelic loss of chromosome 9q31, and all informative kindreds showed tight linkage between the Gorlin syndrome gene and a genetic marker in this region. Loss of heterozygosity at this chromosomal location, particularly in hereditary tumors, implies that the gene is homozygously inactivated and normally functions as a tumor suppressor. In contrast, hemizygous germline mutations lead to multiple congenital anomalies."

https://openalex.org/W1977687670,"We have replaced the Hox-3.1 coding sequence with the E. coli lacZ gene by means of homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells and thus produced null mutant mice. Homozygous mice were born alive, but most of them died within a few days. In the trunk region of homozygotes, several skeletal segments were transformed into the likeness of more anterior ones, as observed in Drosophila with loss-of-function homeotic mutations. The most obvious transformations were the attachment of the 8th pair of ribs to the sternum and the appearance of a 14th pair of ribs on the 1st lumbar vertebra. The pattern of beta-galactosidase activity was identical in heterozygotes and homozygotes and reflected faithfully the Hox-3.1 expression pattern. Thus, the mutation modified the identity, rather than the position, of embryonic cells that would normally express Hox-3.1."
https://openalex.org/W1604209299,"Homologous desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors, as well as adaptation of rhodopsin, are thought to be triggered by specific phosphorylation of the receptor proteins. However, phosphorylation alone seems insufficient to inhibit receptor function, and it has been proposed that the inhibition is mediated, following receptor phosphorylation, by the additional proteins beta-arrestin in the case of beta-adrenergic receptors and arrestin in the case of rhodopsin. In order to test this hypothesis with isolated proteins, beta-arrestin and arrestin were produced by transient overexpression of their cDNAs in COS7 cells and purified to apparent homogeneity. Their functional effects were assessed in reconstituted receptor/G protein systems using either beta 2-adrenergic receptors with Gs or rhodopsin with Gt. Prior to the assays, beta 2-receptors and rhodopsin were phosphorylated by their specific kinases beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) and rhodopsin kinase, respectively. beta-Arrestin was a potent inhibitor of the function of beta ARK-phosphorylated beta 2-receptors. Half-maximal inhibition occurred at a beta-arrestin:beta 2-receptor stoichiometry of about 1:1. More than 100-fold higher concentrations of arrestin were required to inhibit beta 2-receptor function. Conversely, arrestin caused half-maximal inhibition of the function of rhodopsin kinase-phosphorylated rhodopsin when present in concentrations about equal to those of rhodopsin, whereas beta-arrestin at 100-fold higher concentrations had little inhibitory effect. The potency of beta-arrestin in inhibiting beta 2-receptor function was increased over 10-fold following phosphorylation of the receptors by beta ARK, but was not affected by receptor phosphorylation using protein kinase A. This suggests that beta-arrestin plays a role in beta ARK-mediated homologous, but not in protein kinase A-mediated heterologous desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors. It is concluded that even though arrestin and beta-arrestin are similar proteins, they display marked specificity for their respective receptors and that phosphorylation of the receptors by the receptor-specific kinases serves to permit the inhibitory effects of the arresting proteins by allowing them to bind to the receptors and thereby inhibit their signaling properties. Furthermore, it is shown that this mechanism of receptor inhibition can be reproduced with isolated purified proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2158040291,"We have isolated two adenylyl cyclase genes, designated ACA and ACG, from Dictyostelium. The proposed structure for ACA resembles that proposed for mammalian adenylyl cyclases: two large hydrophilic domains and two sets of six transmembrane spans. ACG has a novel structure, reminiscent of the membrane-bound guanylyl cyclases. An aca- mutant, created by gene disruption, has little detectable adenylyl cyclase activity and fails to aggregate, demonstrating that cAMP is required for cell-cell communication. cAMP is not required for motility, chemotaxis, growth, and cell division, which are unaffected. Constitutive expression in aca- cells of either ACA or ACG, which is normally expressed only during germination, restores aggregation and the ability to complete the developmental program. ACA expression restores receptor and guanine nucleotide-regulated adenylyl cyclase activity, while activity in cells expressing ACG is insensitive to these regulators. Although they lack ACA, which has a transporter-like structure, the cells expressing ACG secrete cAMP constitutively."
https://openalex.org/W2051143903,"Multidrug resistance in mammalian tumor cells is associated with the overexpression of mdr genes encoding P-glycoproteins, which function as drug efflux pumps. A yeast homolog of mdr, STE6, mediates export of a-factor mating peptide. Yeast MATa cells carrying a ste6 deletion produce no extracellular a-factor and therefore are defective in mating. Expression of a complementary DNA for the mouse mdr3 gene in a yeast ste6 deletion strain restored ability to export a-factor and to mate. A mutation (a serine to phenylalanine substitution at amino acid 939) known to affect the activity of the mdr3 gene product abolished its ability to complement the yeast ste6 deletion. Thus, functions of P-glycoproteins in normal mammalian cells may include the transmembrane export of endogenous peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1506886301,"Synthesis of mRNA in kinetoplastid protozoa involves the process of trans-splicing, in which an identical 39-41-nucleotide (depending on the species) mini-exon is placed at the 5' end of mature mRNAs. The mini-exon sequence is highly conserved among all members of the Kinetoplastida, nucleotides 1-6 being identical in the four genera so far examined. Prior to trans-splicing, the mini-exon donor RNA is capped by the addition of a (5'-5') triphosphate-linked 7-methylguanosine, followed by modification of the first four transcribed nucleotides. Partial structures have been previously deduced for this cap 4 moiety from Trypanosoma brucei and Leptomonas collosoma. We have purified enough cap 4 from T. brucei and Crithidia fasciculata to allow definitive structural analysis by combined liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The results, together with the known mini-exon sequence, show that cap 4 in both species has the structure m7G(5')ppp(5')m6(2)AmpAmpCmpm3Ump. The presence of N6,N6,2'-O-trimethyladenosine and 3,2'-O-dimethyluridine, nucleosides previously unknown in nature, were confirmed by rigorous comparison with synthetic standards. The conservation of cap 4 between these divergent genera suggests that this structure may be common to most if not all Kinetoplastida."
https://openalex.org/W1505913256,"The synthesis and post-translational processing of a lysyl oxidase precursor protein predicted by the cDNA sequence of rat aorta lysyl oxidase were investigated. In vitro transcription of the cloned lysyl oxidase cDNA and cell-free translation of its mRNA transcript yielded a 47-kDa protein in the absence and a 50-kDa glycosylated protein in the presence of pancreatic membranes, each of which were immunoprecipitated with antibody against the 32-kDa bovine enzyme. Similarly, an N-glycosylated, 50-kDa protein band was synthesized by and immunoprecipitated from cultured neonatal rat aorta smooth muscle cells labeled with [35S]methionine. Pulse-chase studies of proteins newly synthesized by these cells demonstrated that the glycosylated 50-kDa precursor is secreted and that it is processed to the 32-kDa molecular form of lysyl oxidase principally in the medium. The presence of an extracellular processing enzyme activity which converts the 50-kDa precursor to the 32-kDa species was demonstrated by incubating conditioned medium of neonatal rat aorta smooth muscle cell cultures as a source of processing activity with conditioned medium containing 35S-labeled precursor synthesized but not processed by a tumorigenic cell line transfected with a lysyl oxidase expression vector. In contrast to the 50-kDa species, the 32-kDa protein does not appear to be N-glycosylated consistent with the loss of N-linked oligosaccharide units during the processing to the smaller species. The modes of biosynthesis and secretion of lysyl oxidase are discussed in terms of other nonproteolytic activities required for activation of prolysyl oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1493863163,"We report the cloning of a human gene encoding the 5-hydroxytryptamine1B receptor. The receptor has the characteristics of a G-protein-linked receptor and is most homologous to the human 5-HT1D receptor. This human 5-HT receptor gene, most abundantly expressed in striatum, is localized on chromosome 6, at 6q13, and the gene encoding the 5-HT1D receptor is localized on chromosome 1. Radioligand studies indicate that the affinity of [3H]5-HT is 16 +/- 2 nM. Drug competition studies indicate that the receptor displays high affinity (i.e. less than 40 nM) for 5-HT, 5-carboxyamidotryptamine, methiothepin, and metergoline."

https://openalex.org/W2006841435,"This study describes the structure and function of pox neuro (poxn), a gene previously isolated by virtue of a conserved domain, the paired box, which it shares with the segmentation genes paired and gooseberry. Its expression pattern has been analyzed, particularly during development of the PNS. We propose that poxn is a “neuroblast identity” gene acting in both the PNS and the CNS on the basis of the following evidence. Its expression is restricted to four neuronal precursors in each hemisegment: two neuronal stem cells (neuroblasts) in the CNS, and two sensory mother cells (SMCs) in the PNS. The SMCs that express poxn produce the poly-innervated external sense organs of the larva. In poxn− embryos, poly-innervated sense organs are transformed into mono-innervated. Conversely, ectopic expression of poxn in embryos transformed with a heat-inducible poxn gene can switch mono-innervated to poly-innervated sense organs. Expression of poxn in the wing disc is restricted to the SMCs of the poly-innervated sense organs, suggesting that poxn also determines the lineage of poly-innervated adult sense organs."
https://openalex.org/W2037602867,"A 730-base pair element regulates expression of the Drosophila gap gene Krüppel (Kr) in response to the fly anterior morphogen bicoid (bcd). Two hormone receptor-like proteins, encoded by the genes knirps (kni) and tailless (tll), bind specifically to the element. In vitro, kni protein competes with the homeodomain-containing bcd protein in binding to a 16-base pair target sequence. In vivo experiments suggest that both kni and tll act as competitive repressors of bcd-mediated activation of Kr. These results suggest a mechanism by which developmental genes can be regulated in response to an activating morphogen gradient antagonized by repressors."
https://openalex.org/W2060999820,"Leu-enkephalin (Leu-Enk), norepinephrine (NE), somatostatin (SS), and bradykinin (BK) decrease the voltage-dependent calcium current in NG108-15 cells. Here we have investigated whether distinct G proteins, or a G protein common to all of the pathways, mediates this inhibition. We found that pertussis toxin (PTX) reduced all of these transmitter actions, except that of BK. To examine which of the PTX-sensitive pathways is transduced by GoA, we constructed an NG108-15 cell line that stably expresses a mutant, PTX-resistant alpha subunit of GoA. After treatment with PTX, the mutant GoA alpha rescued the Leu-Enk and NE pathways but not the SS pathway. At least three different G proteins can transduce receptor-mediated inhibition of calcium currents in nerve cells. The effects of these G proteins appear to converge on the omega-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive calcium current."
https://openalex.org/W1567708878,"Prolonged depolarization has been used as a model of adaptive changes in the expression of various proteins, such as ion channels and neurotransmitter biosynthetic enzymes, in response to increased trans-synaptic activity in the nervous system. In depolarized PC12 cells, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA levels increased severalfold (Kilbourne, E. J., and Sabban, E. L. (1990) Mol. Brain Res. 8, 121-127). In this study, membrane depolarization caused an increase in the expression of the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), under transcriptional control of the 5' region of the rat TH gene. These results indicate that membrane depolarization leads to increased transcription of the TH gene. Protein kinase C inhibitors had no effect on the induction of TH mRNA by depolarization, as well as the increase in formation of CAT under control of the upstream region of the TH gene. The depolarization responsive element in the TH gene was mapped to the region containing the cAMP responsive element. This region of the TH gene also increased CAT activity in response to the calcium ionophore, ionomycin. Interestingly, combined treatment with cAMP analogs and membrane depolarization had a greater effect than either alone on TH mRNA levels, as well as on CAT activity in PC12 cells transfected with the plasmid containing the cAMP responsive element."
https://openalex.org/W1507477972,"We have examined the role of the acidic residues Asp2 and Glu4 at the NH2 terminus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae actin through site-directed mutagenesis. In DNEQ actin, these residues have been changed to Asn2 and Gln4, whereas in delta DSE actin, the Asp2-Ser-Glu tripeptide has been deleted. Both mutant actins can replace wild type yeast actin. Peptide mapping studies reveal that DNEQ, like wild type actin, retains the initiator Met and is NH2 terminally acetylated, whereas delta DSE has a free NH2 terminus and has lost the initiator Met. Interestingly, microscopic examination of filaments of these two actins reveal the appearance of bundled filaments. The DNEQ bundles are smaller and more ordered, whereas the delta DSE bundles are larger and more loosely organized. Additionally, both mutant actins activate the ATPase activity of rabbit muscle myosin S1 fragment to a lesser extent than wild type. We have also developed a sensitive assay for actin function in vivo that enabled us to detect a slight defect in the ability of these mutant actins to support secretion, an important function in yeast. Thus, although the mutant actins resulted in no gross phenotypic changes, we were able to detect a defect in actin function through this assay. From these studies we can conclude that 1) although NH2-terminal negative charges are not essential to yeast life, the loss of such charges does result in a slight defect in the actins' ability to support secretion, 2) removal of the NH2-terminal negative charges promotes the bundling of actin filaments, and 3) actins lacking NH2-terminal negative charges are unable to activate the myosin S1 ATPase activity as well as wild type actin."

https://openalex.org/W1711738552,"The mechanism linking the stimulation of liver glycogen synthesis to swelling induced either by amino acids or hypotonicity was studied in hepatocytes, in gel-filtered liver extracts, and in purified preparations of particulate glycogen to which glycogen-metabolizing enzymes are bound. High concentrations of KCl, but not of potassium glutamate, were found to inhibit glycogen synthesis in permeabilized hepatocytes. Similarly, physiological concentrations (30-50 mM) of Cl- ions were also found to inhibit synthase phosphatase in vitro, whereas 10-20 mM Cl- ions, a concentration found in swollen hepatocytes, did not inhibit synthase phosphatase. Synthase phosphatase activity was more sensitive to inhibition by Cl- ions at low (0.1%) than at high (1%) concentrations of glycogen. By contrast, 10 mM glutamate and aspartate, a concentration observed in hepatocytes incubated with glutamine or proline, stimulated synthase phosphatase in vitro. Therefore, it is proposed that the fall in intracellular Cl- concentration as well as the increase in intracellular glutamate and aspartate concentrations, that are observed in swollen hepatocytes in the presence of amino acids, are responsible, at least in part, for the stimulation of synthase phosphatase and, hence, of glycogen synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1553254670,"Ligand-induced dimerization of growth factor receptors is crucial for stimulation of their intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity promoting receptor autophosphorylation by an intermolecular mechanism. Moreover, the suppressive and negative dominant action of defective epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was shown to be caused by formation of inactive heterodimers with normal EGFR leading to diminished biological signaling. In this report we explore the structural requirements and functional significance of heterodimerization between EGFR and HER2. HER2 (also called c-erbB-2 or neu) is a member of the EGFR family whose natural ligand is still unknown. We show that in response to EGF, wild type EGFR and various EGFR mutants were able to undergo heterodimerization with HER2. Addition of EGF to transfected cells co-expressing HER2 with a kinase negative point mutant of EGFR (K721A) stimulated heterodimer formation, tyrosine phosphorylation of K721A and HER2, and tyrosine phosphorylation of one of their known substrates, phospholipase C gamma. However, the binding of EGF to transfected cells co-expressing HER2 together with another EGFR mutant CD533 (a deletion mutant lacking most of the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR) caused heterodimerization and inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity. It appears therefore that EGF-induced heterodimerization of EGFR and HER2 can promote either stimulatory or inhibitory influences on kinase activity. We propose that the nature of receptor interactions on the cell surface can either activate or inhibit the initiation of growth factor-controlled cellular signaling."

https://openalex.org/W1617939106,"Membrane-associated transglutaminases (TGase1) have recently been found to be common in mammalian cells, but it is not clear whether these derive from the same or different genes. In order to determine the complexity of this system, we have isolated and characterized the human gene (TGM1). The gene of 14,133 base pairs was found to contain 15 exons spliced by 14 introns. Interestingly, the positions of these introns have been conserved in comparison with the genes of two other transglutaminase-like activities described in the literature, but the TGM1 gene is by far the smallest characterized to date because its introns are relatively smaller. On the other hand, the TGase1 enzyme is the largest known transglutaminase (about 90 kDa), apparently because its gene acquired tracts that encode additional sequences on its amino and carboxyl termini that confer its unique properties. Southern blot analyses of total human genomic DNA cut with several restriction enzymes reveal only one band. Use of human-rodent cell hybrid panels and chromosomal in situ hybridization with biotin-labeled probes revealed that the human TGM1 gene maps to chromosome position 14q11.2-13. Such data suggest there is a single gene copy per haploid human genome. Comparisons of sequence identities and homologies indicate that the transglutaminase family of genes arose by duplications and subsequent divergent evolution from a common ancestor but later became scattered in the human genome. Although our present Southern blot and chromosomal localization studies revealed no restriction fragment length polymorphisms, comparisons of published sequences and our genomic clone indicate there are two sequence variants for TGase1 within the human population. The rare smaller variant contains a two-nucleotide deletion near the 5'-end, uses an alternate initiation codon, and differs from the common larger variant only in the first 15 amino acids. Furthermore, the DNA sequences of intron 14 possess several tracts of dinucleotide repeats that by polymerase chain reaction analysis show wide size polymorphism within the human population. Accordingly, this gene system constitutes a useful polymorphic marker for genetic linkage analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2077288868,"We examined glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity in cortical cell cultures pretreated with 1-5 micrograms/ml tetanus toxin to attenuate the Ca(2+)-dependent release of neurotransmitters. Efficacy of the tetanus toxin pretreatment was suggested by blockade of electrical burst activity induced by Mg2+ removal and by reduction of glutamate efflux induced by high K+. Tetanus toxin reduced neuronal injury produced by brief exposure to elevated extracellular K+ or to glutamate, situations in which release of endogenous excitatory neurotransmitter is likely to play a role. Furthermore, although glutamate efflux evoked by anoxic conditions may occur largely via Ca(2+)-independent transport, tetanus toxin attenuated both glutamate efflux and neuronal injury following combined oxygen and glucose deprivation. With prolonged exposure periods, the neuroprotective efficacy of tetanus toxin was comparable to that of NMDA receptor antagonists. Presynaptic inhibition of Ca(2+)-dependent glutamate release may be a valuable approach to attenuating hypoxic-ischemic brain injury."

When ectopic tectum is produced by heterotopic transplantation at E2 in the diencephalon, the gradient of en expression is inverted from the host polarity by environmental influences. Here we report that the retinal fibers project to the ectopic tectum in a topographic order in accord with the inverted gradient of en expression. Moreover, if ectopic tectum was produced at E3, when the en pattern was preserved, the retinotectal projection pattern was also in accord with the en pattern, suggesting that rostrocaudal polarity of retinotectal order follows en expression patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1640638881,"The influence of DNA polymerase (pol) alpha and DNA primase on SV40 DNA replication was examined in both the monopolymerase and dipolymerase systems. The synthesis of oligoribonucleotides in the monopolymerase and dipolymerase systems, followed by pulse labeling with deoxynucleoside triphosphates, yielded short Okazaki fragments approximately 35 nucleotides in length that were chased into full-length Okazaki fragments with time. In the presence of activator 1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), but no pol delta, these short fragments hardly increased in size with time. DNA fragments of similar size (approximately 35 nucleotides) were previously observed in SV40 replication reactions carried out with crude extracts of HeLa cells in the presence of antibodies directed against PCNA (Bullock, P. A., Seo, Y.S., and Hurwitz, J. (1991) Mol. Cell. Biol. 11, 2350-2361). Thus, the pol alpha-primase complex appears to act processively for only a short distance. At high levels of pol alpha and primase, both short and long DNA products were formed in both systems. In the presence of limiting amounts of pol alpha and excess primase, the monopolymerase system inefficiently yielded longer length Okazaki fragments than those formed with excess pol alpha and primase, whereas the dipolymerase system yielded both short and long DNA fragments. In the presence of limiting amounts of primase and excess pol alpha, long products were formed in both systems, and virtually no short products accumulated. Thus, the ratio between the polymerase and primer ends available controls the size of the nascent product DNA strands. We examined whether PCNA, the T4 phage-encoded gene product 45 (T4 gp45), and the Escherichia coli beta subunit of DNA polymerase III (dnaN gene product) supported SV40 DNA replication and the elongation of single-stranded DNA-binding protein-coated singly primed DNA in reactions catalyzed by pol delta, T4 DNA pol, and E. coli DNA pol III*, respectively. In the presence of T4 gp44/62 and T4 gp32 (but not human single-stranded DNA-binding protein isolated from HeLa cells), T4 DNA pol was weakly activated by PCNA and the beta subunit in lieu of T4 gp45 in the elongation of singly primed phi X174 DNA. However, the other systems were specific for their analogous auxiliary factors. This specificity indicates the importance of protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1497804060,"Mitochondrial ferredoxins mediate electron transfer from NADPH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase to cytochrome P450 enzymes. Previous studies on human ferredoxin, in which acidic residues were replaced with neutral amino acids, established that Asp-76 and Asp-79 are are important for binding to both reductase and P450 (Coghlan, V. M., and Vickery, L. E. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 18606-18612). Here we report that replacement of Asp----Glu at position 76 or 79, whereas maintaining negative charge at these positions also results in dramatic decreases in binding affinity for both electron transfer partners (5-100-fold, delta(delta G) approximately 1.0-2.8 kcal/mol). These results imply that the active electron transfer in these systems are dominated by a stable form which requires specific pairwise electrostatic interactions of fixed geometry for recognition and binding. This mechanism contrasts with that proposed for other electron transfer systems (as exemplified by cytochrome c) in which electrostatic interactions are believed to function primarily in precollisional orientation leading to encounter complexes having multiple geometries of similar free energy."
https://openalex.org/W1504083190,"Abstract alpha 2-Adrenergic receptor (alpha 2-AR) subtypes couple to pertussis toxin (PT)-sensitive G-proteins to elicit both stimulatory and inhibitory cell responses. Signal specificity may be generated by the ability of the receptor subtypes to distinct G-proteins with different affinity. To address this issue we stably expressed three alpha 2-AR subtypes, RNG alpha 2 (alpha 2B-AR), RG10 (alpha 2C-AR), and RG20 (alpha 2D-AR), in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, which express two PT-sensitive G-proteins (Gi alpha 2, Gi alpha 3), and analyzed receptor/G-protein interactions by determining: 1) functional coupling to adenylylcyclase and 2) the ability of the receptors to exist in a high affinity state for agonist. In alpha 2D-AR transfectants expressing 200 or 2,200 fmol of receptor/mg of protein, epinephrine (10 microM) inhibited forskolin-induced elevation of cellular cAMP by 26 +/- 4.8% and 72 +/- 6.2%, respectively. Similar results were obtained in alpha 2B-AR transfectants. However, in alpha 2C-AR transfectants (200 fmol/mg) the forskolin-induced elevation of cellular cAMP was not altered by agonist treatment. In alpha 2C-AR transfectants expressing higher receptor densities (650-1,200 fmol/mg), epinephrine inhibited the effect of forskolin by 30 +/- 3.2%. This difference in functional coupling among the alpha 2-AR subtypes is reflected at the receptor/G-protein interface. In membrane preparations of alpha 2B and alpha 2D-AR but not alpha 2C-AR transfectants, agonist competition curves were biphasic, indicating high and low affinity states of the receptor for agonist. The high affinity state was guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate- and PT-sensitive, indicative of receptor/G-protein coupling. These data suggest that the alpha 2C-AR differs from the alpha 2B and alpha 2D-AR subtypes in its ability to recognize PT-sensitive G-proteins expressed in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. The alpha 2C-AR may couple preferentially to PT-sensitive G-proteins (Gi1, Go1,2) not expressed in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and thereby elicit different cellular responses."
https://openalex.org/W1493130196,"Abstract It has been reported previously (Turner, P.M., and Lorand, L. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 628-635) that human erythrocyte transglutaminase forms a noncovalent complex with human plasma fibronectin near its collagen-binding domain. In the present study, we show by nondenaturing electrophoresis that guinea pig liver transglutaminase, similarly to the erythrocyte enzyme, forms a complex with human fibronectin. Studies of anisotropic shifts of fluorescein-labeled liver and erythrocyte transglutaminases, upon addition of fibronectin, indicated that both transglutaminases bind to fibronectin with a stoichiometry of about 2:1. Polymerization of fibrinogen by human erythrocyte transglutaminase was inhibited after complex formation with fibronectin. Complexes of fibronectin with either erythrocyte or liver transglutaminase were isolated by glycerol gradient zone sedimentation and examined by rotary shadowing electron microscopy. The globular transglutaminase could be readily identified binding to the thin fibronectin strand. The binding site for transglutaminase was within 5-10 nm of the N terminus of fibronectin, consistent with its proximity to the collagen-binding domain. Under some experimental conditions, the complex of fibronectin with erythrocyte transglutaminase appeared as a ring-shaped structure in which two transglutaminase molecules had probably dimerized. The molecular weight of the erythrocyte transglutaminase was determined by sedimentation equilibrium to be 71,440 +/- 830."
https://openalex.org/W1498548275,"Previous studies have shown that inflammatory pathologies are mediated by lymphocyte adhesion to endothelium and subsequent transmigration through the endothelial monolayer. Lymphocyte-endothelial adherence is, in part, caused by the leukocyte integrin LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1, its ligand on endothelial cells. Synthetic peptides based on specific amino acid sequences of human ICAM-1 inhibit the adherence of a lymphocytic cell line, Molt-4, to cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells. A total of 26 peptides spanning the extracellular domains of ICAM-1 were evaluated for their inhibitory activity in two cell adhesion assays. Binding of fluorescently labeled Molt-4 cells to TNF-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells was inhibited reproducibly by peptides ICAM1-20, ICAM26-50, ICAM40-64, ICAM132-146, and ICAM345-375. Three overlapping sequences of the peptide ICAM40-64, KELLLPGNNRKVYELSNVQEDSQPM, were synthesized and tested as well, and the sequence KELLLPGNNRKV showed the greatest inhibition. The inhibitory activity of these peptides was confirmed using a second assay, inhibition of aggregation of the Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-lymphoblast line JY. Polyclonal antibodies were developed in rabbits by immunization with two of the peptides and characterized for their ability to inhibit lymphocyte-endothelial adherence. These studies predict potential sites for interaction of the integrin receptor, LFA-1, with its ligand, ICAM-1. Thus lymphocyte-endothelial interaction, and resulting inflammation, may be partially mediated by the association of ICAM-1 with LFA-1 at the specific molecular locations identified in this study."
https://openalex.org/W1540751296,"Type C atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptor levels in cultured vascular endothelial cells were found to be very sensitive to NaCl and shown to be inversely related to the magnitude of ANP-induced cGMP response of the cells. Endothelial cells from bovine carotid artery were subcultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (MEM-FBS) and in MEM-FBS plus 25 and 50 mM NaCl. Determination, after several passages, of ANP receptor levels in these cells by 125I-ANP binding assay and affinity labeling revealed a marked reduction in the number of type C receptor in the NaCl-treated cells, whereas type A receptor density was not affected. RNase protection assay to estimate the levels of type C receptor mRNA indicated that the reduction occurred at a pre-translational level. In spite of the decrease in type C receptor number and no significant change in type A receptor (i.e. particulate guanylate cyclase) levels, cGMP response of the NaCl-treated cells to ANP was greatly exaggerated; this sensitization was also observed in membrane preparations. Simple masking of type C ANP receptor with C-ANF (des-[Gln18,Ser19,Gly20,Leu21,Gly22]ANP), a ring-deleted ANP analog, did not produce any sensitization of the cGMP response to ANP; therefore, the above phenomenon cannot simply be explained by the clearance function of the type C receptor. Although whether the type C receptor depletion is directly related to the sensitization of the type A receptor/cyclase is not known, the phenomenon reported and characterized here will serve as a useful basis for elucidating ANP receptor regulation and activation."

https://openalex.org/W1582548909,"Anthracycline accumulation was evaluated by flow cytometry or radiolabeled drug assays in cells and cytoplasts (enucleated cells) prepared from parental and multidrug-resistant human K562 leukemia cells. Treatment with energy inhibitors, such as dinitrophenol (DNP) or sodium azide/deoxyglucose, led to a marked decrease in daunorubicin accumulation in parental cells and cytoplasts. Another ionophore, monensin, also caused a significant decrease in daunorubicin accumulation; however, ATPase inhibitors ouabain, vanadate, and N-ethylamaleimide had little or no effect. The lysosomatropic agents chloroquine and methylamine caused a moderate decrease in anthracycline accumulation. Fluorescence microscopy showed that the DNP-sensitive daunorubicin uptake occurred in a nonnuclear subcellular compartment. Studies using increasing daunorubicin concentrations demonstrated fluorescence quenching that occurred in the nonnuclear, DNP-sensitive compartment. The effect of inhibitors on the accumulation of rhodamine 123 and acridine orange strongly implicated lysosomes as the principal compartment of this inhibitable daunorubicin accumulation. Cytoplasts from P-glycoprotein containing multidrug-resistant K562 cells demonstrated a verapamil-reversible, decreased daunorubicin accumulation that was observed in resistant whole cells. Verapamil pretreatment of cytoplasts from resistant cells revealed the subcellular DNP-sensitive uptake present in parental cytoplasts. These studies demonstrate that cytoplasts are an effective means to study drug transport in mammalian cells without nuclear drug binding. Parental K562 cells and cytoplasts exhibit an energy-dependent accumulation of daunorubicin into cytoplasmic organelles that is also present in resistant cells and cytoplasts when P-glycoprotein mediated efflux is inhibited."
https://openalex.org/W1539535509,"The level of aspartate aminotransferase in liver mitochondria was found to be approximately 140 microM, or 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than its dissociation constant in complexes with the inner mitochondrial membrane and the high molecular weight enzymes (M(r) = 1.6 x 10(5) to 2.7 x 10(6)) carbamyl-phosphate synthase I, glutamate dehydrogenase, and the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. The total concentration of aminotransferase-binding sites on these structures in liver mitochondria was more than sufficient to accommodate all of the aminotransferase. Therefore, in liver mitochondria, the aminotransferase could be associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane and/or these high molecular weight enzymes. The aminotransferase in these hetero-enzyme complexes could be supplied with oxalacetate because binding of aminotransferase to the high molecular weight enzymes can enhance binding of malate dehydrogenase, and binding of both malate dehydrogenase and the aminotransferase facilitated binding of fumarase. The level of malate dehydrogenase was found to be so high (140 microM) in liver mitochondria, compared with that of citrate synthase (25 microM) and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (0.3 microM), that there would also be a sufficient supply of oxalacetate to citrate synthase-pyruvate dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W2008013303,"The pharmacological specificity of Ca2+ channel-secretion coupling in acetylcholine (ACh) and somatostatin (SOM) release was studied in the chick eye choroid neuromuscular junctions and in dissociated ciliary ganglion (CG) neurons. ACh secretion changes in development from stage (St) 40, when release is dihydropyridine (DHP) and partially omega-conotoxin (omega-CgTX) sensitive, to posthatch, when release is insensitive to DHPs but sensitive to omega-CgTX. St 40 CG neurons cultured with striated muscle have release properties similar to those of St 40 iris and choroid but different from those of St 34 neurons, which are neither DHP nor omega-CgTX sensitive. SOM (also coreleased from posthatch choroid terminals) can inhibit ACh release in both posthatch and St 40 choroids, suggesting that the SOM receptor interacts with both DHP-sensitive and -insensitive channels."
https://openalex.org/W1560003193,"The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) is a tumor suppressor gene involved in the etiology of many types of human cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in tumor suppression by Rb are largely unknown. The neu gene is a dominant transforming oncogene and a member of the growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase gene family. Both inactivation of the Rb gene and overexpression of the neu gene are involved in human breast and lung cancers. Therefore, it is of interest and importance to investigate the potential interactions between Rb and neu. Here we show that Rb suppresses neu-induced transformation by focus formation assays. This transformation suppression by Rb was further shown to be due to transcriptional repression of neu using Rb expressing effector plasmid and neu promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. The cis-acting element conferring Rb-mediated repression was mapped to a recently identified novel enhancer in the neu promoter. The data indicate that the growth factor receptor neu is a target for the Rb gene product and transcriptional repression of a dominant oncogene expression may be one of the molecular mechanisms of Rb-mediated tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W1558202004,"Cell to cell communication by many hormones and neurotransmitters involves three major entities: receptor (R), G-protein (G), and effector molecule (E). Plasticity in this system is conferred by the existence of each entity as isoforms or closely related subtypes that are expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner. Factors that determine signal specificity in this system are poorly understood. Such factors include the relative affinity and stoichiometry of R-G or G-E and the possible colocalization of R-G-E in cellular microdomains. Utilizing the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor (alpha 2-AR) system as a representative subfamily of this class of signal transducers, we determined the relative importance of these factors. By analysis of R-G coupling in mammalian cells cotransfected with alpha 2-AR genes and G alpha cDNA, we demonstrate preferential coupling between an alpha 2-AR subtype and Go. Our data implicate R-G affinity as an important determinant of signal transduction specificity and indicate that a critical level of Go alpha is required for coupling. This report indicates the utility of R-G cotransfection in mammalian cells as a natural environment model to characterize events occurring at the R-G and G-E interface."
https://openalex.org/W1528704353,"The erbB oncogene encodes an altered form of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor that lacks the extracellular ligand binding domain. This oncogene is exclusively leukemogenic. However, an increase in oncogenic potential and a broadening of the tissue specificity of tumor formation occurs after retroviral transduction of erbB. The increased oncogenic potential correlates with structural alterations within the erbB gene. One common event is the deletion of a serine phosphorylation site located within the COOH-terminal domain. This site of phosphorylation has been demonstrated to be required for EGF-induced desensitization of signaling by the EGF receptor (Countaway, J. L., Nairn, A. C., and Davis, R.J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 1129-1140). Here we show that the mutation of erbB at this negative regulatory serine phosphorylation site causes fibroblast transformation in vitro and is associated with an increased oncogenic potential in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1602414822,"The phenylalanine-sensitive isozyme of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase from Escherichia coli was inactivated by the sulfhydryl modifying reagents 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate), bromopyruvate, and N-ethylmaleimide and protected from inactivation by the presence of its metal activator, Mn2+, and substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate. Inactivation by 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) was correlated with modification of two of the seven cysteine sulfhydryls of the enzyme monomer. The kinetics of 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) modification were altered significantly and distinctively by both substrates (phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose 4-phosphate), by Mn2+, and by L-phenylalanine, suggesting that ligand binding has significant effects on the conformation of the enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to create multiple substitutions at the two invariant cysteine residues of the polypeptide, Cys-61 and Cys-328. Analysis of purified mutant enzymes indicated that Cys-61 is essential for catalytic activity and for metal binding. Cys-328 was found to be nonessential for catalytic activity, although mutations at this position had significant negative effects on Vmax, KmMn, and KmPEP."
https://openalex.org/W2079984318,"A new recognition probe for biomolecules, [en2Os(η2-H2)]2+ (1; en, ethylenediamine), is reported. In aqueous solution, 1 binds readily to a variety of biomolecules, including nucleotides, RNA, amino acids, peptides, and phospholipids. In each case, binding leads to a characteristic proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) for the dihydrogen that appears in a spectral window in the range δ = 0 to -20 parts per million, and as well to characteristic values of the coupling JHD and of the relaxation time T1. Small structural differences in molecules such as DGMP (2′-deoxyguanosine 5′-monophosphate) and IMP (inosine 5′-monophosphate) or Asp and Glu can readily be distinguished, such as when 1 binds to the N-7 position of the nucleobase of DGMP or IMP and when 1 binds to the carboxylate of Asp or Glu. Upon one-electron oxidation of the metal center, diamagnetic 1 is converted to a paramagnetic probe."
https://openalex.org/W1511477775,"CheR methyltransferase from Salmonella typhimurium was directly photolabeled with S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine. The labeled protein was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then was detected by fluorography. The methylase-S-adenosyl-L-methionine adduct was found to be stable under the experimental conditions employed. Labeling was found to be a function of the concentration of enzyme, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), and the intensity and time of UV irradiation. The extent of labeling and protein methylation was found to be inhibited by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, S-adenosyl-L-ethionine, and sinefungin, which are known to compete with AdoMet for the same binding site on the enzyme. Our earlier data showed that the enzyme has 2 cysteine residues and that these are important for enzyme activity. Here, we show that sulfhydryl reagents inhibit the photolabeling of the substrate to the enzyme, indicating the presence of cysteine in the vicinity of the substrate-binding site. We also found that when Cys31 was modified to Ser, no photolabeling of CheR was observed, whereas a modification of Cys229 to Ser had little effect on the ability of AdoMet to label the enzyme. This suggests that Cys31 is located at or near AdoMet-binding site. The labeled protein was cleaved at tryptophan residues, generating two major fragments, each containing 1 cysteine residue. SDS-PAGE and fluorography of the cleaved products indicated the presence of the label being associated with the Cys31 fragment. Similar results were obtained when the labeled protein was cleaved at glutamic acid residues using V8 protease. A tryptic digest of the labeled protein showed two radioactive peptide peaks when subjected to separation on reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The labeled peptides were further digested to free amino acids, and the labeled amino acid was identified as S-methylcysteine by thin layer chromatography. These results indicate that Cys31 may be involved with substrate binding, as well as with catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2125800881,"The enzymatic activities of Escherichia coli recA protein are sensitive to ionic composition. Here we report that sodium glutamate (NaGlu) is much less inhibitory to the DNA strand exchange, DNA-dependent ATPase, and DNA binding activities of the recA protein than is NaCl. Both joint molecule formation and complete exchange of DNA strands occur (albeit at reduced rates) at NaGlu concentrations as high as 0.5 M whereas concentrations of NaCl greater than 0.2 M are sufficient for complete inhibition. The single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-dependent ATPase activity is even less sensitive to inhibition by NaGlu; ATP hydrolysis stimulated by M13 ssDNA is unaffected by 0.5 M NaGlu and is further stimulated by E. coli ssDNA binding protein approximately 2-fold. Finally, NaGlu has essentially no effect on the stability of recA protein-epsilon M13 DNA complexes, with concentrations of NaGlu as high as 1.5 M failing to dissociate the complexes. Surprisingly, NaGlu also has little effect on the concentration of NaCl required to disrupt the recA protein-epsilon M13 DNA complex, demonstrating that destabilization is dependent on both the concentration and type of anionic rather than cationic species. Quantitative analysis of DNA binding isotherms establishes that the intrinsic binding affinity of recA protein is affected by the anionic species present and that the cooperativity parameter is relatively unaffected. Consequently, the sensitivity of recA protein-ssDNA complexes to disruption by NaCl does not result from the competitive effects associated with cation displacement from the ssDNA upon protein binding but rather results from anion displacement upon complex formation. The magnitude of this anion-specific effect on ssDNA binding is large relative to that of other nucleic acid binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1580560556,"A diverged homeobox gene, HB24, which is known to be induced following lymphocyte activation, was introduced into Jurkat T cells under the control of a constitutive promoter. Stable transfectants of HB24 were established that expressed high levels of HB24 mRNA and possessed an altered phenotype suggestive of activated T cells. A number of genes known to be induced following T cell activation and associated with cell growth were increased in the transfectants, including c-fos, c-myc, c-myb, HLA-DR, lck, NF-kappa B, interleukin-2 and interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL-2R alpha). Analysis of IL-2R alpha expression by transient transfection of IL-2R alpha promoter constructs into the HB24 transfectants revealed constitutive expression (about 60% of phytohemagglutinin- and phorbol ester-activated Jurkat cells) that was dependent on the kappa B site in the IL-2R alpha promoter. Furthermore, as a consequence of the increased HB24 mRNA levels, the Jurkat HB24 transfectants proliferated more rapidly than control cell lines. Thus, stable expression of HB24 confers an activation phenotype on a human T cell line, implicating this gene as an important transcriptional factor during T cell activation and growth."

https://openalex.org/W1593647457,"Benextramine, a tetramine disulfide, irreversibly inhibits neuropeptide Y (NPY) binding to the 50-kDa Y2 NPY receptor in bovine hippocampus (Li, W., MacDonald, R. G., and Hexum, T. D. (1991) Eur. J. Pharmacol. 207, 89-91). Evidence is presented that this inhibition occurs through a thiol-disulfide exchange. Treatment of bovine hippocampal membranes with benextramine inhibited NPY affinity cross-linking to the 50-kDa receptor. This inhibition of labeling was not affected by washing the membranes, but could be completely reversed by the addition of several thiol reducing reagents, including reduced glutathione, beta-mercaptoethanol, and cysteine. Benextramine inhibited 70% of NPY-specific labeling and was much more effective than other sulfhydryl reactive agents, such as oxidized glutathione, cystamine, and 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Furthermore, the sulfhydryl-modifying agents N-ethylmaleimide and p-chloromercuriphenyl-sulfonic acid specifically decreased NPY affinity labeling. Finally, NPY labeling of the 50-kDa receptor was reduced by the heavy metal ions Zn2+, Cu2+, and Hg2+. Preincubation with NPY prevented Y2 receptors from being inactivated by either 400 microM N-ethylmaleimide or 1 mM benextramine. These results suggest that one or more benextramine-sensitive sulfhydryl groups on the Y2 receptor are important for NPY binding activity."
