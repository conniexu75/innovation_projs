https://openalex.org/W2140192657,"Nutrient metabolism was examined with regard to insulin secretion in purified rat islet beta- and non-beta-cells, beta-cell lines, and hepatocytes. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity (nanomoles.min-1.mg protein-1) was remarkably low in the glucose-sensitive INS-1 cell line (15.7) and in beta-cells (22.3). Thus, beta-cell LDH was respectively 8-, 122-, 17-, and 136-fold lower than in islet non-beta, liver, HIT-T15, and RINm5F cells. Plasma membrane lactate transport activity was 3-10-fold lower in beta- or INS-1 cells than in the other cell types. Conversely, mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase was strongly expressed only in beta- and INS-1 cells. The significance of these findings to nutrient recognition was explored using INS-1 cells as a model of native beta-cells. Glucose-stimulated lactate output and glucose utilization were, respectively, 12- and 5-fold lower in INS-1 than in RINm5F cells. Each process was entirely blocked by respiratory chain inhibitors in INS-1 cells, whereas glucose utilization was barely affected and lactate output stimulated in RINm5F cells. Glucose oxidation represented 73% of total utilization in INS-1 cells, but only 9% in RINm5F cells. Absolute rates of glucose oxidation, and the extent of mitochondrial NAD(P) reduction, were similar in the two cell types, and glucose stimulated insulin secretion 1.9-fold in INS-1 and 1.4-fold in RINm5F cells. The mitochondrial substrates, monomethyl succinate, pyruvate, and leucine, each triggered secretion in INS-1 cells. The balance of LDH, plasma membrane lactate transport, and mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase activities therefore appear to be important in beta- and INS-1 cell glucose recognition to ensure that mitochondrial oxidation is the principle fate of pyruvate and NADH produced by glycolysis. The resultant close coupling of glycolysis with mitochondrial oxidation explains the absence in beta-cells of Crabtree and Pasteur effects."
https://openalex.org/W1545450687,"The formation of membrane phospholipid is coordinated with the cell cycle in a colony-stimulating factor 1-dependent macrophage cell line. Net phospholipid accumulation occurs as cells enter S phase and results from an interaction between cell cycle-dependent oscillations in the rates of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) biosynthesis and degradation. CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) is the rate-controlling step in PtdCho biosynthesis, and its activity is inhibited by cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation. CT phosphorylation is low in early G1, begins to rise in late G1, increases steadily through S and G2/M, and then declines precipitously as cells exit mitosis and reenter G1. CT activity increases in early G1 and then decreases steadily as the cells progress through late G1, S, and G2/M, reflecting the elevated phosphorylation state of the protein. Membrane phospholipid degradation is also periodic: the rate is rapid in G1, slows significantly during S phase, and accelerates again as cells reenter G1. The data support the hypothesis that CT dephosphorylation accelerates PtdCho synthesis in response to the increased membrane phospholipid degradation to maintain membrane phospholipid mass during G1 and that the periodic cessation of phospholipid degradation during S phase accounts for the transition to net membrane phospholipid accumulation. Inactivation of CT associated with hyperphosphorylation of the protein during G2/M likely plays a determining role in the cessation of net membrane accumulation prior to cell division."
https://openalex.org/W1517718286,"Cyclin B, a positive regulatory subunit of the cdc2 protein kinase complex, is synthesized across the cell cycle and then rapidly degraded at the end of mitosis. Degradation of cyclin B is triggered by increased levels of active cdc2 and is required for exit from mitosis. It was shown previously that cyclin degradation is carried out by the ubiquitin system, but the components responsible for the specificity and regulation of cyclin-ubiquitin ligation have not been identified. The formation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates usually requires the sequential action of three enzymes: a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-carrier protein (E2), and a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3). In this work we employed a fractionation approach to identify the components of a clam oocyte system responsible for specific ubiquitination of cyclin and to determine which components are regulated by cdc2. Experimental conditions were established under which a fusion protein containing an amino-terminal fragment of cyclin B is ligated to ubiquitin only in extracts from M-phase but not from interphase cells. Fractionation of M-phase extracts by DEAE-cellulose and high speed centrifugation yielded three fractions that were all required for cell cycle stage-specific cyclin-ubiquitin ligation. Only one of these fractions could be replaced by a previously known enzyme of the ubiquitin system, E1. A second fraction contained a novel species of E2, termed E2-C, which acts in the ligation of ubiquitin to cyclin but not to other endogenous proteins. A third component is associated with particulate material. Whereas E2-C from either M-phase or interphase extracts is active, the particulate component is active only in M-phase. Incubation of the particulate fraction from interphase cells with the protein kinase cdc2 activates it for cyclin-ubiquitin ligation, after a lag of about 30 min. These findings suggest that the particulate fraction may contain an E3 enzyme that acts on cyclin, as well as additional factors activated by cdc2."
https://openalex.org/W1591715670,"DnaA protein of Escherichia coli acts in the initiation of chromosomal replication to bind to sequences in the chromosomal origin. On binding, it promotes the assembly of other replication proteins that serve to prime DNA replication and assemble the replication apparatus for bidirectional replication fork movement. A collection of monoclonal antibodies to DnaA protein have been produced, one of which is described here, that interferes with the action of DnaA protein in promoting formation of a prepriming complex. On the analysis of this process, the antibody appears to interfere with the physical interaction between DnaA and DnaB protein in the DnaB.DnaC complex. Cross-linking studies confirm that DnaA and DnaB proteins interact directly. These results provide the first direct evidence that one of the roles of DnaA protein is to act as a site for binding of DnaB protein to the DNA and perhaps orients DnaB helicase to account for the directionality of replication fork movement."
https://openalex.org/W1530463005,"Activity of the ubiquitous Na-H exchanger (NHE1) is regulated by a number of receptors with tyrosine kinase activity as well as by several classes of receptors coupled to heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins. We previously demonstrated that the beta 2-adrenergic receptor and other receptors that stimulate adenylyl cyclase by activating Gs stimulate NHE1 by a guanine nucleotide-dependent mechanism that is independent of receptor coupling to Gs. Now we report that a recently identified G alpha subunit, alpha 13, activates the exchanger. Transient expression of mutationally activated alpha 13 constitutively stimulates Na-H exchange; moreover, an alpha 13/alpha z chimera, designed to respond to stimulation by Gi-coupled receptors, mediates stimulation of Na-H exchange by one such receptor, the dopamine2 receptor. Mutationally activated alpha 13, however, does not stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity or phosphoinositide hydrolysis, indicating that its action on NHE1 occurs independently of these two effector pathways. These findings reveal the first known signaling function of alpha 13 and identify a new G protein involved in the regulation of NHE1."
https://openalex.org/W1516768321,"Incubation of immunopurified glucocorticoid receptor with rabbit reticulocyte lysate forms a complex between the receptor and hsp90, with simultaneous conversion of the receptor from a non-steroid binding but DNA binding state typical of the transformed receptor back to the steroid binding, non-DNA binding state typical of the untransformed receptor (Scherrer, L. C., Dalman, F. C., Massa, E., Meshinchi, S., and Pratt, W. B. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 21397-21400). The receptor heterocomplex formed by the lysate also contains hsp70 and is formed in an ATP-dependent and cation-selective manner (Hutchison, K. A., Czar, M.J., Scherrer, L. C., and Pratt, W.B. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 14047-14053). In this work, we selectively depleted reticulocyte lysate of hsp70 by passing it through a column of ATP-agarose. The hsp70-depleted lysate contains hsp90, but it cannot form a receptor-hsp90 heterocomplex. hsp70 purified from mouse L cells binds to immunopurified glucocorticoid receptor but does not convert it to the steroid binding state. Addition of purified hsp70 to the hsp70-depleted lysate reactivates the heterocomplex assembly system, permitting formation of a receptor-hsp90-hsp70 complex, with the receptor being returned to the high affinity steroid-binding conformation. These data are consistent with a model in which the protein-unfolding activity of hsp70 is required for hsp90 binding to the hormone binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor. The hsp56 immunophilin component of the native receptor heterocomplex is also present in the reconstituted receptor heterocomplex in an hsp70-dependent manner. In addition to hsp70, other as yet unidentified factors in reticulocyte lysate are required for receptor heterocomplex assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1567413266,"The mechanism of the enhanced bactericidal action to Escherichia coli of the lysozyme having a hydrophobic pentapeptide (Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro) at its C terminus was investigated. The modified lysozyme, hydrophobic pentapeptide-fused lysozyme (HLz), was secreted in the culture medium from yeast harboring the expression plasmid, in which a synthetic DNA fragment encoding a hydrophobic pentapeptide was introduced to the 3'-end of the coding region of the lysozyme cDNA. Although CD analysis showed that HLZ was considerably different from wild-type lysozyme (WLz) in the secondary and tertiary structures, it retained 76% of the lytic activity of WLz. When E. coli cells were exposed to the WLz or HLz, the survival cells were significantly reduced only in the case of HLz. Periplasmic proteins from the HLz-treated cells were released to an extent similar to that from the WLz-treated cells, indicating that HLz has nearly the same action as WLz with respect to the disruption of the outer membrane and peptidoglycan. Experiments with E. coli phospholipid liposomes revealed that HLz dissipated the valinomycin-induced transmembrane electrochemical potential, but WLz did not. These results suggest that the enhanced bactericidal action of HLz to E. coli is due to disruption of the electrochemical potential of the inner membrane in cooperation with the inherent function of the lysozyme to the outer membrane and peptidoglycan."
https://openalex.org/W1508835002,"The octapeptide angiotensin II (Ang-II) induces both acute functional changes and longer lasting molecular changes in cultured mammalian heart myocytes, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, Ang-II was found to stimulate a sustained release (> 30 min) of arachidonic acid (ARA) from cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, with a half-maximal response observed at 0.1 nM. Mass spectroscopy analysis showed that Ang-II stimulated a specific release equivalent to 104 fmol of ARA/micrograms of protein in 10 min. Only Ang-II type 1 (AT1) receptor-specific antagonists were potent inhibitors of hormone-evoked [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation (DuP 753 IC50 approximately 7 nM compared to CGP 42112A IC50 > 1 microM). In contrast, only AT2 receptor-specific antagonists were potent inhibitors of [3H]ARA release (CGP 42112A IC50 approximately 7 nM, EXP 3880 IC50 approximately 2 nM, and PD 123177 IC50 approximately 10 nM). Further studies with phospholipase inhibitors (p-amylcinnamoylanthranilic acid and U73122) revealed that the production of [3H]-inositol phosphates and [3H]ARA occurs through parallel and independent pathways involving phospholipase C and phospholipase A2, respectively. Ang-II also increased the level of lysophosphatidylcholine by 49%, direct evidence that this peptide activated phospholipase A2. Thus, Ang-II stimulates distinct phospholipases in parallel through AT1 and AT2 receptors. These results reveal coordinate signaling roles for multiple Ang-II receptor subtypes in heart."
https://openalex.org/W1599111869,"The saliva of Triatoma pallidipennis, a blood-sucking triatomine bug (Hemiptera, family Reduviidae, subfamily Triatominae) was found to contain a factor that specifically inhibits collagen-induced platelet aggregation. The 19-kDa protein was purified to homogeneity and named pallidipin. Collagen-mediated aggregation of platelets in plasma and of washed platelets was inhibited with the same efficacy. No inhibition of aggregation stimulated by other effectors (ADP, thrombin, thromboxane A2 mimetic U46619, phorbol ester) was detected. Pallidipin had no effect on platelet adhesion to collagen but inhibited ATP release from platelets. It interacted reversibly with platelets and may share with collagen a common target on them. The protein exhibits a unique primary structure (predicted from cDNA clones) with no significant similarity to other previously described sequences. The protein produced in recombinant baby hamster kidney cells had antiaggregatory effects similar to those of native pallidipin. Availability of recombinant pallidipin will allow further investigation of the precise mechanism of action."
https://openalex.org/W1596000517,"Several free radical species, attributed to tyrosyl radicals, have been previously observed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy during reaction of pure ovine prostaglandin H synthase-1 (PGHS-1) with hydroperoxide or fatty acid substrates. The identity and location of amino acid residue(s) involved in formation of these radicals has been investigated using wild type and mutant PGHS-1 expressed in transfected COS-1 cells. Upon reaction with hydroperoxide, detergent extracts from microsomes of cells expressing wild type ovine PGHS-1 rapidly produced EPR signals made up of a broad component, resembling either the wide doublet or the wide singlet seen in reactions of the purified ovine enzyme, mixed with a variable proportion of a narrow component. Isotope replacement with perdeuterated tyrosine and phenylalanine in wild type PGHS-1 caused no change in enzymatic activity or capability to form a peroxide-induced radical, but the radical was an isotropic singlet without any wide features. This loss of splitting in the deuterated enzyme establishes that the wide radical signal in PGHS-1 is indeed a tyrosyl radical, validating the earlier assignment based on spectral similarities with a tyrosyl radical in ribonucleotide reductase. A Y385F mutation abolished cyclooxygenase but not peroxidase activity, and the peroxide-induced EPR was narrowed to a singlet essentially identical with that obtained with indomethacin-treated ovine enzyme. Isotopic replacement with perdeuterated tyrosine and phenylalanine in the Y385F mutant led to further narrowing of the peroxide-induced EPR to an isotropic singlet, establishing that this radical also involved a tyrosine residue. A Y355F mutant exhibited some decrease in cyclooxygenase activity, but the peroxidase activity and the peroxide-induced radical characteristics were not significantly different from those of the wild type enzyme, indicating that Tyr355 is not involved in tyrosyl radical formation in PGHS-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1504170490,"To study the mechanism involved in mannose-6-phosphate (Man-6-P) independent lysosomal proenzyme membrane association, we used a reversible cross-linker to probe radiolabeled human HepG2 cells permeabilized with saponin in the presence of Man-6-P. After immunoprecipitation of the extracted and cross-linked cells with anti-cathepsin D antibody, followed by complete reduction of the immunoprecipitates and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, we found that procathepsin D was specifically and transiently associated, independent of Man-6-P, with two co-synthesized glycoproteins having molecular masses of 68 and 72 kDa. Pulse-chase and cell fractionation experiments showed that the Man-6-P independent association of procathepsin D with the 68-kDa protein started in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, continued in the Golgi, but had no association with either membrane. The Man-6-P independent association of procathepsin D with the 72-kDa protein and the membrane was found in compartments all the way from the Golgi to the dense lysosome, where processing of procathepsin D is believed to occur and where procathepsin D dissociated from the 72-kDa protein and the membrane. Endo H digestion of the 72-kDa protein showed that this protein was partially resistant to Endo H, suggesting that membrane association of the procathepsin D-72-kDa protein complex probably began in a late Golgi compartment. Endo F digestion of the proteins showed both have the same molecular mass around 58 kDa. Using antiserum against human saposin C, we identified the two glycoproteins as forms of prosaposin with different glycosylation. The transient, Man-6-P independent, membrane association of the procathepsin D-prosaposin complex and the presence of this complex in heavy lysosomes indicated that the proteins were transported to the lysosome as a complex. The association of two lysosomal proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum early after synthesis suggested that preassembly of some lysosomal components occurs before the earliest previously identified steps in the sorting pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1502019564,"Son of sevenless-1 and -2 (Sos-1 and -2) are guanosine nucleotide exchange factors implicated in the activation of Ras by both the insulin and epidermal growth factor signal transduction pathways. Ras appears to function by initiating the activation of cellular protein kinases including mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Sos proteins contain numerous sequences in their carboxyl-terminal regions which correspond to consensus sites for MAP kinase phosphorylation. To examine whether these sites are substrates for MAP kinases, the cDNA encoding Drosophila Sos (dSos) was tagged with sequences encoding the major antigenic epitope of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) to create a dSosHA fusion construct. dSosHA was transiently expressed in COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies. When immune complexes were incubated with purified MAP kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP, a phosphorylated band of 180 kDa was observed when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This band was not present in immunoprecipitations from cells transfected with vector alone. No phosphorylation of the 180 kDa band was seen when immunoprecipitates were incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP in the absence of MAP kinase. Two dimensional analysis of tryptic peptides from dSosHA phosphorylated by MAP kinase in vitro revealed two major phosphorylated species that were also found in dSosHA isolated from COS-1 cells labeled with 32Pi. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a feedback loop exists wherein growth factor-activated MAP kinases phosphorylate and regulate Sos proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1790871298,"The mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) of Neurospora crassa is constituted by an alpha- and a beta-subunit. We have purified alpha-MPP after expression in Escherichia coli while beta-MPP was purified from mitochondria. A fusion protein between precytochrome b2 and mouse dihydrofolate reductase was expressed in E. coli, and the purified protein was used as substrate for MPP. Both subunits of MPP are required for processing. MPP removes the matrix targeting signal of cytochrome b2 by a single cut, and the resulting presequence peptide is 31 amino acid residues in length. It acts as a competitive inhibitor of processing but has a approximately 30-fold lower affinity for MPP than the preprotein. Competition assays show that MPP recognizes the COOH-terminal portion of the presequence of cytochrome b2 rather than the NH2-terminal part which has the potential to form an amphiphilic helix. Substitution of arginine in position -2 of the matrix targeting sequence of cytochrome b2 prevents processing but not import of a chimeric precursor. Substitution of the tyrosyl residue in position +1 also prevents processing, indicating that MPP interacts with sequences COOH-terminal to the cleavage site. Non-cleavable preprotein is still recognized by MPP. Our data suggest that processing peptidase and import machinery recognize distinct structural elements in preproteins which, however, can be overlapping."
https://openalex.org/W1601522367,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulates the differentiation of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells to those resembling sympathetic neurons. We have investigated whether NGF regulates transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta gene expression and protein secretion in PC12 cells. These cells constitutively express TGF-beta 1 mRNA, whereas TGF-beta 2 and -beta 3 mRNAs are expressed at very low levels. TGF-beta 1 gene expression was stimulated greater than 10-fold when PC12 cells were treated with NGF. Sequences between -119 and -98 in the TGF-beta 1 promoter, homologous to an Egr-1 binding site, were shown to be important for both basal and NGF-induced promoter activity. We also found that a factor(s) present in nuclear extracts from PC12 cells interacted with the sequences between -119 and -98 and that expression of this factor was induced by NGF treatment. Moreover, specific binding to TGF-beta 1 promoter fragments between -119 and -98 was seen using the bacterially expressed transcription factor Egr-1. These results indicate that activation of TGF-beta 1 expression is one of the cellular responses of PC12 cells to NGF and suggest that TGF-beta may play a role in the differentiation of sympathetic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1602681003,"Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1 (MCP-1), a member of the Cys-Cys branch of the chemokine superfamily, induced a mepacrine- and manoalide-sensitive increase in the release of [3H]arachidonic acid from prelabeled human monocytes and monocytic THP-1 leukemic cells. The effect was rapid (<30 s), reached maximum at optimal chemotactic concentrations, and was completely blocked by pretreatment of monocytes with Bordetella pertussis toxin. A specific antiserum and heat inactivation blocked the induction of arachidonic release by MCP-1. No [3H]arachidonic acid release was observed in the absence of Ca2+ influx (5 mM EGTA or 5 mM Ni2+) or in monocytes loaded with a Ca(2+)-buffering agent. However, using ionophore-permeabilized monocytes and controlled intracellular Ca2+ concentration it was possible to dissociate MCP-1-induced Ca2+ influx from [3H]arachidonic acid release. Thus, the MCP-1-induced increase in [Ca2+]i is necessary but not sufficient for arachidonic acid accumulation. Phospholipase A2 inhibitors (mepacrine, p-bromophenacyl bromide, and manoalide) blocked monocyte polarization and chemotaxis induced by MCP-1. The related Cys-Cys chemokines RANTES and LD78/MIP1 alpha also induced a rapid release of [3H]arachidonic acid, and their chemotactic activity was blocked by phospholipase A2 inhibitors. Brief (5 min) pretreatment of monocytes with platelet-activating factor amplified MCP-1-induced arachidonic acid release and, at MCP-1 suboptimal concentrations, synergized in inducing monocyte migration. Since MCP-1 and platelet-activating factor are induced concomitantly by inflammatory cytokines in monocytes and endothelial cells, we speculate that the observed synergism may have in vivo relevance. The results presented here show that the Cys-Cys chemokines MCP-1, LD78/MIP1 alpha, and RANTES cause rapid release of arachidonic acid in monocytes and that this may be important in inducing monocyte chemotaxis."
https://openalex.org/W1513419514,"The effect of pancreatic group I phospholipase A2 (PLA2-I) on receptor-mediated expression of arthritic group II phospholipase A2 (PLA2-II) and its correlation with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis were examined in cultured rat mesangial cells. Scatchard analysis using 125I-PLA2-I revealed the existence of a single class of specific binding sites for PLA2-I in rat mesangial cells with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.6 nM and a maximum binding capacity of 10.1 fmol/10(6) cells. The mammalian mature type of PLA2-I specifically recognized this binding site, whereas its inactive zymogen and mammalian PLA2-II showed much lower affinities. PLA2-I markedly increased PLA2-II mRNA levels as well as PLA2-II secretion from the cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner that was closely correlated with PGE2 production. Both PLA2-II expression and PGE2 synthesis were completely suppressed by pretreatment of the cells with actinomycin D, cycloheximide, or dexamethasone. These results strongly suggest that there may be crosstalk between PLA2-I and PLA2-II via the specific PLA2-I receptor that elicits PGE2 synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1585207232,"Id is considered to be a negative regulator of basic helix-loop-helix proteins, which play important roles in cell type-specific transcription and cell lineage commitment. The Id gene was first cloned in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells, which can be induced to differentiate toward erythrocytes with Me2SO, and its mRNA decreases after differentiation in various types of cells. In this report, we demonstrate that overexpression of Id interferes with MEL cell differentiation and that inhibition of differentiation is accompanied by reduction in expression of three erythroid-specific genes. While down-regulation of Id is an early event in the differentiation process of MEL cells, E-box binding activity of these cells increases only at a later stage of differentiation, and this late increase is reduced by the overexpression of Id in the early stage. Sequential changes in the activity of several basic helix-loop-helix proteins thus appeared to be involved in erythroid differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1606833961,"PIK-A49 is a 49-kDa soluble protein that was isolated as an activator of the plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-kinase from carrot cells (Yang, W., Burkhart, W., Cavallius, J., Merrick, W. C., and Boss, W. F. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 392-398). PIK-A49 is a multifunctional protein that binds and bundles F-actin and has translational elongation factor-1 alpha activity. In this paper, we have investigated the mechanism of activation of PI 4-kinase by PIK-A49. PIK-A49 decreased the Km of PI 4-kinase for ATP from 0.40 to 0.19 mM. GTP and GDP, which affect the elongation factor-1 alpha function of the protein, inhibited the activation of PI 4-kinase by PIK-A49. Phosphorylation of purified PIK-A49 by a calcium-dependent protein kinase enhanced activation of PI 4-kinase. When dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase, PIK-A49 no longer activated PI 4-kinase; however, rephosphorylation of PIK-A49 by calcium-dependent protein kinase fully restored activation. Western blots using anti-PIK-A49 serum showed that PIK-A49 was associated with the plasma membrane and the F-actin fraction isolated from plasma membranes, indicating that PIK-A49 would be in a position to regulate plasma membrane PI 4-kinase. Based on these data, we propose a mechanism for feed-forward regulation of polyphosphoinositide biosynthesis in response to increases in cytosolic calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1599995371,"Translocation across the thylakoid membrane of the recently identified photosystem I polypeptide, PSI-N, has been analyzed in pea (Pisum sativum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). PSI-N from barley is synthesized in the cytosol with a bipartite presequence similar in structural terms to those of other cytosolically synthesized proteins routed to the thylakoid lumen. In vitro reconstitution assays demonstrate that translocation into thylakoids is absolutely dependent on the transthylakoidal delta pH, but that nucleotide triphosphates are not required; the translocation mechanism is thus similar in these respects to those utilized by the 23- and 16-kDa proteins of the oxygen-evolving complex. The translocation of PSI-N is unique in that the presequence of PSI-N does not contain an intermediate cleavage site for the stromal processing peptidase; important experiments using intact chloroplasts depleted of a delta pH by nigericin treatment demonstrate the accumulation of the full precursor protein in the stroma. Translocation across the thylakoid membrane can take place in the absence of stromal factors, although the presence of stromal extracts leads to a consistent but slight enhancement of translocation efficiency. We also show that efficient translocation of the 33-kDa protein of the oxygen-evolving complex can take place in the complete absence of a delta pH, in apparent contradiction with earlier findings; the translocation of this protein is thus similar in several respects to that of plastocyanin. The data indicate the operation of two very different types of translocation mechanism, with PSI-N exhibiting additional separate characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W1658143440,"A cDNA clone encoding a hydrophilic protein with a calculated molecular mass of 13,839 Da was isolated by shotgun screening with an anti-V-ATPase holoenzyme serum. The deduced amino acid sequence showed no significant homology to any other known protein. Southern blots revealed the existence of only one gene encoding the 14-kDa protein. Monospecific antibodies purified by affinity to the recombinant protein demonstrated the presence of a 14-kDa protein in the highly purified goblet cell apical membrane and inhibited ATP-dependent proton transport as well as V-ATPase activity to the same extent. Thus, the 14-kDa protein was shown to be a part of the V-ATPase holoenzyme. Binding of the monospecific antibodies to the ATPase seemed to require an ATP-dependent conformational change of the enzyme, since inhibition only occurred when ATP was present during the antibody binding step. The 14-kDa subunit could be stripped from the membrane by treatment with the chaotropic agent KI, confirming it to be part of the soluble complex of the V-ATPase. In immunoblots, the 14-kDa-specific antibodies showed no cross-reaction with several xenic V-ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W1662292728,"The mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (M6P/IGF-II receptor) binds two distinct ligands, mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II). The extracytoplasmic region of the receptor is composed of 15 homologous repeating domains and domains 1-3 and 7-9 have been shown to contain the two Man-6-P binding sites. To determine the location of the single IGF-II binding site, truncated forms of the M6P/IGF-II receptor were expressed transiently in COS-1 cells and assayed for their ability to bind iodinated human recombinant IGF-II. The binding of [125I]IGF-II to the receptors in the presence or absence of excess unlabeled IGF-II, IGF-I, or insulin was determined by incubation with homobifunctional cross-linking agents followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These binding studies demonstrated that a construct encoding domains 5-11 bound 0.9 mol of IGF-II/mol of receptor, whereas a construct encoding domains 5-10 exhibited no detectable binding to IGF-II. These results indicate that the IGF-II binding site of the M6P/IGF-II receptor is contained within domains 5-11 and that residues in domain 11 play an important role in IGF-II binding."
https://openalex.org/W1593132892,"The influence of the insulin secretagogues, glucose and K+, to activate the multifunctional, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) in isolated rat pancreatic islets has been examined. Glucose (28 mM) and K+ (40 mM) were demonstrated to induce a 1.89 +/- 0.19- and 1.75 +/- 0.15-fold increase, respectively, in phosphorylation of a subunit of CaM kinase II immunoprecipitated by an anti-CaM kinase II alpha antibody. In intact islets, glucose and K+ also induced the generation of an autonomous, Ca2+/calmodulin-independent protein kinase II activity characteristic of autophosphorylated enzyme. Maximal activation, 2.9 +/- 0.2- and 3.0 +/- 0.5-fold for glucose and K+, respectively, relative to basal glucose control, was achieved at 2.5-5 min followed by a decline to near basal levels by 20 min. Glucose induced the production of autonomous CaM kinase II activity that, in terms of -fold stimulation, correlated closely with the extent of insulin release over a glucose concentration range of 3-28 mM. This stimulated activity was completely prevented by an inhibitor of glucose metabolism, mannoheptulose. These data demonstrate that the exposure of islets to stimulatory glucose concentrations activates CaM kinase II. The close correlation of enzyme activation with insulin secretion is consistent with the hypothesis that CaM kinase II plays an important role in the regulation of insulin secretion or related beta-cell processes."
https://openalex.org/W1489522726,"Abstract The gene encoding a folate-binding protein (FBP) expressed in human placenta has been cloned by screening a genomic library with the KB cell FBP complementary DNA. This gene, contained in a 10-kilobase EcoRI fragment of this genomic clone, has 5 exons, 4 introns, the AATAA polyadenylation signal in the 3'-untranslated region, and a 5'-flanking sequence which contains the promoter elements, all of which span approximately 5 kilobases. Transcription initiation was mapped by RNase protection to a site 73 base pairs downstream from a G-rich sequence linked to a tandemly repeated GGAAG sequence which is a motif that the ets oncogene encoded GA-binding protein (GABP) transcription factor binds. Gel-shift and supershift mobility assays indicate that the G-rich sequence and the ets motif bind specifically to SP1 and GABP, respectively. These cis regulatory elements in tandem drive expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in transiently transfected mouse 3T3 cells. The location of these elements upstream of transcription initiation in this gene, which lacks an appropriately located TATA box promoter, indicates that this SP1-GA binding region most probably regulates expression of this placental FBP. The gene encoding this placental FBP has been assigned the FBP/PL-1 gene because it is a member of a multigene family that includes a gene encoding a FBP expressed in both KB cells and placenta and its unprocessed pseudogene."
https://openalex.org/W1514519599,"Calcipotriol (MC903) is a side chain analog of the vitamin D hormone calcitriol, containing a 22-23 double bond, a 24(S)-hydroxyl function, and carbons 25, 26, and 27 incorporated into a cyclopropane ring which has been developed for treating psoriasis. The in vitro metabolism of calcipotriol was studied in two keratinocyte cell models, HPK1A and HPK1A-ras. Calcipotriol was initially converted into the 24-ketone (MC1046) and its 22,23-hydrogenated derivative (MC1080), metabolites observed in osteosarcoma, kidney, and hepatoma cell lines. We also observed the formation of further metabolites, identified as the two 23-hydroxylated derivatives of MC1080 (MC1439 and MC1441), the two 23,24-dihydroxylated compounds (MC1575 and 1577), and the side chain-cleaved compounds, tetranor-1,23-(OH)2D3 and calcitroic acid, the end products of catabolism of calcitriol. These findings suggest that calcitriol and calcipotriol may share catabolic enzymes. The biological activity of each of the principal metabolites of calcipotriol, assessed using a growth hormone reporter gene transcriptional activation system and a vitamin D receptor assay, was found to be lower than that of calcipotriol. If the extensive in vitro metabolism of calcipotriol is also found in normal and psoriatic keratinocytes in vivo, then this may explain the lack of systemic calcemic activity of topically applied drug."
https://openalex.org/W1495640495,"Various beta-mutants were investigated either as subunits or as substrates for casein kinase 2 (CK-2), in the absence of presence of polylysine. A total of 21 beta-mutants were characterized for their susceptibility to autophosphorylation, by combining them in equimolar amounts with the recombinant alpha-subunit. Six mutants, i.e. beta A5,6, beta A59-61,63,64, beta A55,57, beta 55-57, beta delta 171-215, and beta delta 150-215 exhibited a > 70% reduction in autophosphorylation. This strongly suggests that in addition to amino acid residues 5,6, distant amino acid residues within the sequence 55-64 are also involved in the process of autophosphorylation, possibly by means of a loop formation. The results obtained with the COOH-terminal-deleted mutants support the view that reconstitution of a functional holoenzyme must occur to allow efficient autophosphorylation. Polylysine prevents the autophosphorylation of beta wt (86% inhibition) inducing a parallel increase of the alpha-subunit autophosphorylation. The autophosphorylation of all mutants, with the exception of beta A55-57 and beta A59-61,63,64, is also inhibited by polylysine (>64%). The alpha-subunit autophosphorylation is increased with all mutants reconstituting a tetrameric holoenzyme. Only with the three largest COOH-terminal deletion mutants beta delta 150-215, beta delta 171-215, and beta delta 181-215 is no significant alpha-subunit autophosphorylation observed. The phosphorylation of the beta-subunit mutants added in large molar excess to CK-2 holoenzyme (either native or recombinant) is also severely impaired by Ala for Glu/Asp substitutions at position 5,6 and in the 55-64 region and by the deletion of the COOH-terminal segments 150-215 and 171-215. Such a phosphorylation is inhibited by polylysine, with the exception of mutants beta delta 171-215 and beta delta 150-215, whose phosphorylation is conversely stimulated by polylysine. The decreased phosphorylation efficiency of those mutants that are poor substrates is invariably accounted for by lower Vmax values, whereas the affinity for CK-2 is actually increased (Km values lower than that of beta wt)."
https://openalex.org/W1508003205,"We have examined the effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on the promoter activity of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) gene in cultured neonatal rat atrial myocytes. In acute transfection studies 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibited the expression of a human ANP (hANP) promoter-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter (-1150 hANP CAT) in a dose-dependent fashion (10(-10)-10(-8) M). When an expression vector for the vitamin D receptor (VDR) (pSVL-VDR) was introduced together with the reporter plasmid, there was a significant ligand-dependent amplification of the vitamin D-dependent inhibition. Deletion analysis of the 5'-flanking sequence localized the suppressible promoter sequence to within 104 base pairs of the transcription start site of the hANP gene. Thyroid hormone, glucocorticoid, estrogen, and retinoic acid receptor were incapable of mimicking the VDR-dependent inhibition. Retinoid X receptor, on the other hand, effected a significant reduction in hANP promoter activity which was at least additive with that produced by the liganded VDR. The VDR-dependent inhibition displayed promoter selectivity. Both the SV40 promoter and a conventional vitamin D response element linked to a truncated SV40 promoter were activated by the liganded vitamin D receptor, whereas the Rous sarcoma virus promoter was unaffected. On the other hand, the cardiac-specific troponin T promoter was suppressed in a fashion similar to ANP. These findings imply a potentially important role for vitamin D3 in the regulation of gene transcription in myocardial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1604526724,"The influence of membrane potential (Vm) on cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]i) oscillations during the sustained extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent phase of the Ca2+ signaling response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) was analyzed in cultured pituitary gonadotrophs. In agonist- and inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3)-stimulated cells, sustained [Ca2+]i oscillations were extinguished by hyperpolarization after 3-15 min despite the availability of Ca2+ in the extracellular medium. Single depolarizing pulses transiently restored the amplitude of the sustained spiking in a dihydropyridine- and extracellular Ca(2+)-sensitive manner. The responses to depolarization showed a marked dependence on Vm that was correlated with the steady-state inward Ca2+ current. In addition, repetitive application of brief depolarizing pulses modulated the frequency of agonist- and Ins(1,4,5)P3-controlled spiking; depolarization pulses at frequencies lower than the intrinsic rate of episodic Ca2+ release triggered large transients between the autonomous spikes, whereas higher frequencies of depolarizing pulses overcame the original Ca2+ spiking frequency. These extrinsically driven and extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent oscillations were sensitive to the Ca(2+)-ATPase blocker, thapsigargin, but not to ryanodine. On the other hand, spontaneous firing and application of depolarizing pulses to nonstimulated cells failed to induce thapsigargin-sensitive oscillations. These findings demonstrate that the pattern of Ca2+ signaling in gonadotrophs does not depend exclusively on the Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentration, but also on the excitable status of the cell. Such modulation of the Ins(1,4,5)P3-controlled Ca2+ signaling system by changes in Vm could provide a mechanism for the integration of multiple inputs that utilize diverse signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1498185139,"To examine the biological properties of protein kinase C (PKC)-delta and -epsilon NIH 3T3 cells were stably transfected with metallothionein-based expression vectors that overexpressed these isoforms. In addition to their inducibility by Zn2+, the protein levels of these two PKC subtypes, but not that of endogenous PKC-alpha, increased with increasing cell density. An unexpected role for Mg2+ in the subcellular localization of PKC-delta was found. This isoenzyme was predominantly membrane-associated when cell fractionation was carried out in the absence of Mg2+ but cytosolic when the fractionation was performed in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+. In contrast, the predominant localization of cytosolic PKC-alpha and of membrane-associated PKC-epsilon was not influenced by Mg2+. In vivo and in vitro studies of [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding in the overexpressing cell lines confirmed the cytosolic localization of PKC-alpha, the membrane-associated state of PKC-epsilon, and the presence of PKC-delta at both locations. Readdition of serum for 5 min to serum-starved, quiescent cell lines initiated the redistribution of PKC-alpha to the particulate fraction, while the location of PKC-delta and PKC-epsilon was not affected. Zn(2+)-induced overexpression of PKC-delta- and PKC-epsilon-stimulated sodium-dependent phosphate uptake. Overexpression of PKC-delta caused an increase in the Vmax of Na+/P(i) uptake, while overexpression of PKC-epsilon resulted in a decrease in Km for orthophosphate. A further stimulation of Na+/P(i) uptake in the overexpressing cells could be achieved by phorbol ester activation of endogenous PKC-alpha. These results suggest that each of the three PKC isotypes contribute to the regulation of sodium-dependent phosphate uptake, but through distinct mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1579009843,"The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV) UL5, UL8, and UL52 proteins form a helicase-primase complex in infected cells. Several laboratories have demonstrated that helicase and nucleoside triphosphatase activities of the heterotrimer (UL5/8/52) are indistinguishable from that of a subassembly of UL5 and UL52 (UL5/52). Although the UL5/52 subassembly functions in coupled primase-polymerase assays on homopolymeric templates, its activity on natural DNA templates has been reported to require UL8. To determine the role of UL8 in primase assays, the activity of the UL5/52 subassembly was compared to that of the heterotrimer reconstituted by adding UL8 to UL5/52. We detected significant activity of the UL5/52 subassembly in coupled primase-polymerase and oligoribonucleotide primer synthesis assays on phi X174 and M13 virion DNAs. However the addition of UL8 to UL5/52 stimulated this activity in a dose-dependent manner. We demonstrate that stimulation occurred at the level of primer synthesis. UL8 did not affect the amount or size of primers annealed to template, their utilization by DNA polymerase, or the use of specific initiation sites within the template. In kinetic studies, the rate of primer synthesis was increased by UL8 but the Km for phi X174 DNA template was unchanged. These results suggest that a function of the UL8 component of the HSV helicase-primase complex is to increase the efficiency of primer synthesis by UL5/52."
https://openalex.org/W1621512905,"The activation of serine protease zymogens involves conformational changes that increase the affinity of substrate binding and the activity of the catalytic center. The activation of prothrombin is particularly complex and requires several cleavages in the proenzyme region in addition to the conserved activation cleavage after Arg320. To understand how these cleavages lead to the exposure of the thrombin anion-binding exosite, a major macromolecular recognition site, interactions of recombinant human prothrombin derivatives with thrombomodulin, and an exosite-specific antibody were studied by competition binding and immunoprecipitation. By either method, the anion-binding exosite is not functional on prethrombin 2, which is cleaved after Arg271 and lacks fragment 1.2, nor on meizothrombin, which is cleaved only after Arg320. In contrast, the exosite is fully exposed on meizothrombin des-F1, which is cleaved after both Arg320 and Arg155 and therefore lacks amino-terminal fragment 1 (F1). Thus, two events are required to create the exosite. First, cleavage after Arg320 causes conformational changes that are much more extensive than those accompanying the activation of trypsinogen. Second, removal of amino-terminal F1 is necessary, perhaps to relieve steric hindrance. These results indicate that the F1 fragment regulates access to the thrombin exosite. The properties of meizothrombin des-F1 suggest that this prothrombin derivative could have a biological function."
https://openalex.org/W1543985529,"We have previously reported that the expression of the ColCAT3.6 transgene containing 3.5 kilobases (kb) of alpha 1(I) collagen (COL1A1) promoter sequence fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene paralleled the expression of the endogenous gene in several connective tissues. We report here that the activity of the reporter gene in aorta from 7-day-old transgenic mice is 10-64-fold lower than in tendon or bone, whereas the endogenous gene is highly expressed in all three tissues. In contrast, the COL1A1 minigene containing 2.3 kb of upstream sequence, the first five exon/intron units, the last six exon/intron units, and 2 kb of 3'-flanking sequence showed high CAT activity in aorta. These results suggest that cis sequences found in ColCAT3.6 mediate high levels of COL1A1 expression in bone and tendon, but not in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), whereas sequences located within the minigene, but not found in ColCAT3.6, mediate VSMC-specific expression. Analysis of promoter activity in cultured cells derived from transgenic tissues further suggests the presence of VSMC-specific regulatory domains. Transient transfection studies, however, failed to shows differential regulation. These differences stress the importance of not relying exclusively on transient transfection data when mapping tissue-specific regulatory domains."
https://openalex.org/W1582699403,"Assembly of RecA subunits into long, helical oligomers is required for its roles in recombinational DNA repair and homologous genetic recombination. The crystal structure of RecA reveals an extensive network of amino acid residues that lie at the subunit boundaries. We have introduced a large set of substitutions at 5 clustered residues, which are shown in the crystal structure to make specific contacts with positions in the neighboring monomer. We find that 3 of the 5 residues are important for RecA function (Lys216, Phe217, and Arg222), whereas the other 2 (Asn213 and Tyr218) are not. The patterns of functionally allowed substitutions provide insight into the chemical and steric constraints required at these positions."
https://openalex.org/W1485874307,"Sphingomyelinase induces a marked rapid decrease of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in Jurkat T cells treated with either CD3 monoclonal antibody; the Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin; or the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin. Sphingomyelinase treatment of Jurkat cells results in a net decrease of cellular sphingomyelin content. Among the products generated by the catabolism of sphingomyelin, sphingosine displayed exactly the same effect as sphingomyelinase. Sphingosine decreases the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in cells treated with CD3, thapsigargin, or ionomycin. Studying the effect of sphingosine in CD3-activated cells showed that this compound does not modify Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores but strongly inhibited the Ca2+ influx induced by the monoclonal antibody. The fact that sphingosine inhibits Ca2+ influx generated by thapsigargin and ionomycin supports the hypothesis that the drug activates the Ca2+ extrusion process. Derivatives of sphingosine such as erythrosphinganine and threosphinganine share the same inhibitory properties."
https://openalex.org/W1536634418,"Abstract The ptsH operon of Escherichia coli is controlled by two promoters P0 and P1, each of which is regulated by cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) complexed with cAMP (CRP.cAMP). We have studied the in vitro as well as in vivo transcriptional regulation of these two promoters. Each promoter exhibits a switching mechanism in vitro, where, depending upon the presence or absence of CRP.cAMP, transcription is initiated from different start sites termed a and b. P0 (P0a) is affected by supercoiling: when the template is linear, transcription initiation is switched to a site 3 base pairs upstream (P0b) and becomes more CRP.cAMP dependent. Transcription from the P1 promoter (P1a) switches initiation sites to 7 base pairs downstream (P1b) in the presence of CRP.cAMP. Most transcription in vivo was from P1a, and P0b could not be detected in vivo. Glucose has independent positive effects on pts expression in vivo. The results indicate that the two different regulatory mechanisms (one through CRP.cAMP, the other through glucose) are working together for fine control of pts expression."
https://openalex.org/W1485049583,"The proximal promoter of the rat carbamyl phosphate synthetase I gene contains four cis-acting regulatory regions, designated sites GAG, I, II, and III. The GAG site, which is located adjacent to the predicted TATA region, contains a direct repeat of the nonamer, GAGGAGGGG, and binds a factor which is unrelated to the other upstream binding site factors. Sites I-III, on the other hand, bind the same or similar factors, but with different affinities (site II > site III > site I). High affinity binding to site II requires the core octamer, GTTGCAAC. Sequential 5'-deletion of the promoter revealed that GAG is the predominant activating element in transient transfection analyses and, on its own, can sustain activity of a -67 promoter fragment. However, in the context of a -157 promoter in which the GTTGCAAC core of site II had been mutated, promoter activity was completely repressed, and this repression was due to sites I and III. Repression by sites I and III in the presence of mutated site II was relieved either by mutating sites I and III or by introducing a 76-bp random DNA fragment between GAG and site I. Our results suggest a model in which the carbamyl phosphate synthetase I promoter is controlled by a single activating element, GAG, and by two repressor elements, sites I and III. We conclude that the high affinity site II element binds an anti-repressor. Footprint analyses of the -157 promoter with and without a mutation of the GTTGCAAC element in site II suggest that the anti-repressor may interfere with the site I and site III repressors by quenching."
https://openalex.org/W1752203810,"Using a cell-free system for UV mutagenesis we have recently shown that extracts prepared from Escherichia coli cells promote a UV mutagenesis pathway that depends on the uvrABC repair genes independent of DNA replication (type II UV mutagenesis; Cohen-Fix, O., and Livneh, Z. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 3300-3304). Type II UV mutagenesis was defective also in extracts prepared from a uvrD strain. These deficiencies were complemented by adding purified UvrA, UvrB, UvrC, or UvrD proteins to the respective cell extracts. The Uvr proteins act at an early stage in the process, probably preparing a premutagenic single-stranded DNA gap, which subsequently serves as a substrate for the mutagenic reaction. Type II UV mutagenesis was not dependent on DNA polymerases I or on DNA polymerase II, but it was dependent on DNA polymerase III. Thus, similar to the in vivo situation, only DNA polymerase III is essential for UV mutagenesis. Antibodies against the beta subunit of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme inhibited DNA replication but not UV mutagenesis. Thus, the processivity subunit of the holoenzyme is not required for type II UV mutagenesis, in agreement with a mechanism involving filling-in of short single-stranded DNA gaps."
https://openalex.org/W1539535477,"Bone sialoprotein (BSP) is a major noncollagenous, RGD-containing glycoprotein found in the extracellular matrix of bone. The RGD sequence is flanked by two tyrosine-rich regions, which fit the established consensus requirements for tyrosine sulfation. Tyrosine sulfation is suggested to be important in the regulation of protein secretion and function. The role of this post-translational modification on the cell attachment activity and secretion of a highly sulfated form of BSP isolated from a rat osteoblast-like cell line (UMR 106-01 BSP) was investigated by inhibiting sulfation with chlorate. [35S]Sulfate, [3H]glucosamine, and [3H]tyrosine were used as metabolic precursors to monitor biosynthetic products. Chlorate was effective in inhibiting total [35S]sulfate incorporation by 90% without altering overall protein synthesis and secretion in cultures up to 72 h under serum-free conditions. Isolated proteoglycans and purified BSP were analyzed for sulfate incorporation. Proteoglycans isolated from the medium of cells treated with chlorate displayed a difference in the hydrodynamic properties of the molecules as compared with control cultures. An increase in the specific activity of proteoglycans labeled with [3H]glucosamine isolated from chlorate-treated cells was also observed suggesting a change in hexosamine metabolism induced by chlorate. BSP purified from the medium of chlorate-treated cells contained approximately 7% of the 35S incorporation as compared with nontreated control cultures. Quantification of sulfate incorporation into glycoconjugates versus tyrosine sulfate of BSP indicates that the amount of sulfate associated with N- and O-linked oligosaccharides was reduced by approximately 97%, while that on tyrosine residues was reduced by approximately 90%. Using normal human bone cells, the cell attachment activity of the reduced sulfate form of BSP was nearly equivalent to that of the fully sulfated product."
https://openalex.org/W1493687821,"A 69-kDa protein with topoisomerase I activity has been homogeneously purified from the chloroplasts of pea leaves. The topoisomerase properties are detected in crude lysate of pea chloroplasts using the technique of transferring 32P radioactivity from the 32P-labeled DNA to the protein. The purified enzyme relaxes both positive and negative supercoils in topological steps of unity without requiring magnesium ions. The enzyme is sensitive to topoisomerase I-specific inhibitors like camptothecin and berenil, and unaffected by reagents like novobiocin and doxorubicin at the topoisomerase II-inhibitory dosage. In the presence of the enzyme, supercoiled DNA is nicked, and the 3'-phosphoryl end of the nick becomes covalently linked with the enzyme. A tyrosine residue of the enzyme is responsible for the covalent linkage. Rabbit antiserum raised against the 16-mer peptide spanning the active residues of human topoisomerase I recognizes the 69-kDa protein within the crude lysate of pea chloroplasts as does the antiserum to the purified 69-kDa protein. From the enzymatic characteristics, the protein has been classified as a eukaryotic type I topoisomerase."
https://openalex.org/W1607616388,"Nuclear transport signal (NTS)-containing proteins are transported into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex by a mechanism that is not well understood. To better characterize the mechanisms of transport, we have established an homologous in vitro system using an NTS-containing structural protein of simian virus 40 (SV40) and isolated nuclei from cultured cells of its natural host. Isolated nuclei accumulated either fluorescently labeled SV40 Vp3-NTS peptide-BSA conjugates (NTSwt-BSA), as assayed cytochemically, or 125I-NTSwt-BSA, as assayed by filtration, in a signal- and ATP-dependent manner. Nuclear accumulation required nuclear membrane integrity and was inhibited by the lectin wheat germ agglutinin but not concanavalin A. Unlike several other systems, this system is not dependent on cytoplasmic extracts for the transport of SV40 proteins. NTSwt-BSA was transported with an apparent Km of 0.8 microM and Vmax of 0.8 nmol/min/10(*) nuclei. Thin section autoradiography confirmed the transport. This system faithfully reproduced what occurs in vivo: nuclear import of the SV40 capsid protein Vp3 was dependent on the presence of its functional NTS. Full-length Vp3, expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, and a deletion mutant which retains its NTS, Vp3 delta C13, were transported by the nuclei but Vp3 delta C35, which lacks the NTS, and an NTS mutant, Vp3(202E/204T), were not transported."
https://openalex.org/W1484331337,"Comparison of microbial strains with normal and high content of single enzymes is coming into use for metabolic analysis and in vivo assessment of enzyme function. We present an example for phosphoglucose isomerase and glucose metabolism in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We use cell suspensions in conditions of inhibited protein synthesis and respiration, with low assimilation, rapid and linear glucose utilization, fermentation almost quantitative, and high enough cell density for direct preparation of extracts for metabolite analysis. The mass action ratio and fitting of fructose-6-P and glucose-6-P concentrations and kinetic parameters of the enzyme are not inconsistent with near equilibrium of the reaction in the wild-type strain and small if any change in the high level strain. However, this conclusion would require that the Vmax values underestimate the activity in the cell. On the other hand, the specific activities of glucose-6-P and fructose-1,6-P2 during metabolism of [2-3H]glucose are quite high which, together with knowledge of tritium exchange and isotope effects for the reaction in vitro, would point to the reaction in the wild-type strain being far from equilibrium; the specific activities are lower in the high level strain, indicating that extra enzyme is functional. One way to reconcile the latter results would be for tritium exchange to be considerably lower in vivo than known in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1547862759,"The primary structure of squid retinal-binding protein (RALBP) was determined by cDNA and protein sequencing. Squid RALBP contains 342 amino acid residues in a single N-terminal-blocked chain with a molecular weight of 39,111. The N alpha-blocking group was identified as an acetyl moiety by mass spectrometry. The amino acid sequence revealed that the protein is highly hydrophilic and acidic, but it has several hydrophobic regions that are located mainly in the middle part of the polypeptide chain. It is also predicted that these hydrophobic regions form beta-sheet structures. The primary structure of RALBP is, however, quite distinct from those of other retinoid-binding proteins, showing that squid RALBP is a novel hydrophobic ligand-binding protein that functions in intracellular retinoid transport. Using the cloned cDNA, squid RALBP was expressed in vitro. By carrying out the translation at 20 degrees C in reticulocyte lysates, the protein having retinol binding activity was produced."

Chromatography of a Triton extract of rat liver Golgi membranes on a column of this gel in the presence of castanospermine to prevent binding of alpha-glucosidases permitted a rapid purification of the endomannosidase (70,000-fold over the homogenate) with a 12% yield. This purified enzyme was free of other processing glycosidases and was completely inhibited by Glc alpha 1-->3(1-deoxy)mannojirimycin. Examination of the endomannosidase by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a doublet (M(r) 60,000 and 56,000) with the bands being of approximately equal density. Gel permeation high performance liquid chromatography indicated that in its native form the enzyme has an oligomeric structure (M(r) approximately 560,000) consisting of eight to ten subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1595198063,"The mitogenic action of growth factors involves the stimulation of intracellular protein kinases. In this report we have characterized the major protein kinase released from Balb/c 3T3 and normal rat kidney plasma membranes by the action of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). PDGF appears to stimulate the release of approximately 10 proteins, at least one of which is a kinase capable of phosphorylating proteins on Ser or Thr (as determined by the lability of the phosphate to alkali treatment). More than 90% of the Ser/Thr kinase activity was inhibited by PKI5-22, a specific peptide inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). We used immunoblotting to confirm that the kinase released in response to PDGF was PKA. cAMP also stimulated the release of PKA, and the set of protein substrates phosphorylated was similar following PDGF or cAMP stimulation. Interestingly, in the presence of a cAMP analogue ((Rp)-cAMPS), cAMP could not induce dissociation of PKA from the membranes, whereas stimulation by PDGF increased the level of PKA activation. Furthermore, unlike Swiss 3T3 cells, neither Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts nor normal rat kidney cells accumulate cAMP in response to PDGF, yet the level of PKA in the cytosol of these intact cells increases in response to PDGF. Thus, it appears as though PDGF activation of the membrane-associated form of the PKA holoenzyme occurs by a mechanism independent of an elevation in cAMP levels."
https://openalex.org/W1492538638,"To understand the processing of type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) into the storage granules of platelets, we utilized a eukaryotic expression vector (pRC/CMV) to transfer the human cDNA for PAI-1 into AtT-20 cells, a mouse pituitary cell line known to sort proteins in a regulated fashion. Immunofluorescence staining of PAI-1-transfected AtT-20 clones revealed co-localization of PAI-1 with an endogenously produced and stored hormone (i.e. adrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH). Stimulation of PAI-1-transfected AtT-20 cells with a secretagogue resulted in the release of both active PAI-1 and the latent form. In comparison, PAI-1-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (i.e. a nonpackaging cell line) did not release PAI-1 in response to a secretagogue and exhibited immunoreactivity for PAI-1 primarily confined to the Golgi region. Percoll density gradient fractionation of AtT-20 cells revealed a codistribution of PAI-1 and ACTH in cellular compartments of the same density. The half-life of PAI-1 activity at 37 degrees C was prolonged in intact granules (t1/2, 5 h) in comparison with its half-life in lysed granules (t1/2, 2 h). These studies demonstrate the presence of a new functional property associated with the PAI-1 molecule that directs this inhibitor into the storage secretory pathway."

Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) 1 and 2 have been fused to mouse-human chimeric IgG3 at the end of CH1, immediately after the hinge, and at the end of CH3. Fusion heavy chains of the expected molecular weight were expressed, assembled with a co-expressed light chain, and secreted. The resulting molecules continued to bind antigen; they also bound the growth factor receptors, albeit with decreased affinity. The molecule with IGF1 attached after CH3 (CH3-IGF1) had reduced ability to carry out complement-mediated cytolysis. In contrast the molecule with IGF2 attached after CH3 (CH3-IGF2) showed an approximately 50-fold increase in its ability to effect complement-mediated cytolysis and so should be an effective cytolytic agent. Both CH3-IGF1 and CH3-IGF2 bound Fc gamma RI with affinity similar to that of IgG3. The growth factor fusion proteins showed small but significant uptake into the brain parenchyma."

To understand the structure of the ATPase active site, we employed an analog of ATP, 8-azidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate (8-azido-ATP) as a photoaffinity labeling agent. 8-Azido-ATP interacts nearly normally with the active site of Rho. It binds to 3 sites per Rho hexamer with a 100 microM KD and is a substrate with a Vmax 5% that of ATP and a Km of 18 microM. Under UV irradiation, 8-azido-ATP makes covalent bonds with Rho, inactivating its ATPase. Rho is protected from this inactivation by the presence of ATP. We used [alpha-32P]8-azido-ATP to label the active site and identify residues involved in ATP binding. Labeled tryptic peptides of the modified Rho were purified by Fe(3+)-iminodiacetic acid affinity chromatography and reverse-phase C18 column high performance liquid chromatography. We identified a single peptide, Gly174-Lys184, that is labeled by 8-azido-ATP and protected from labeling in the presence of ATP. The modified amino acid is Lys181, whose conservative replacement by Gln181 gives rise to a poorly active enzyme (Dombroski, A. J., Brennan, C. A., Spear, P., and Platt, T. (1988a) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18802-18809). Lys181 probably participates in binding the phosphoryl groups of ATP. Incorporation of one 8-azido-ATP per Rho hexamer is sufficient to cause inactivation, a result that indicates that the active sites of Rho interact in RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1581514258,"Thyroid follicles perform several functions that depend upon epithelial polarity: secretion of thyroglobulin (Tg) to the apical lumen, uptake of iodide for Tg iodination, and the manufacture of thyroid hormone for delivery to the bloodstream. In this report we examine Tg processing by thyroid epithelial monolayers cultured on porous filters. Basolateral 125I uptake resulted in thyrotropin-dependent radiolabeling of Tg in cells and apical medium. Polarized thyrocytes iodinated exogenous gamma globulins (IgG), demonstrating labeling in the apical extracellular space. Apical catalase addition inhibited the appearance of apical [125I]IgG and [125I]Tg, but had no effect on cell-associated [125I]Tg, indicating additional iodination of Tg in an intracellular compartment. A similar conclusion was drawn from radioiodination experiments at 20 degrees C. Intracellular iodination was selective for Tg forms receiving prior Golgi carbohydrate modifications. During a 2-h chase, [125I]Tg was exported from cells to apical medium, while modest amounts of thyroxine were secreted with a majority to the basolateral medium. Neither radioiodination at 20 degrees C nor apical catalase addition blocked formation or secretion of [125I]thyroxine during the chase. Thus in filter-grown thyroid epithelial cells, prior to apical extracellular iodination, intracellular iodination of Tg begins the process leading to formation of thyroxine."
https://openalex.org/W1604172326,"Abstract The function of mos protein in somatic cells, the mechanisms underlying its ability to transform cells, and its relationship to growth factor autonomy and growth factor-mediated signal transduction are not well defined. This report demonstrates that the expression of transforming mos (v-mos) can block the stimulation of growth-related gene expression mediated by the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB). This blockade by v-mos of PDGF-BB signal transduction occurs very early in the signalling pathway, at the level of PDGF type-beta receptor autophosphorylation. Although the expression of PDGF type-beta receptor, as detected by Western blot with anti-PDGF type-beta receptor antibody,was not diminished in v-mos transformed BALB/c-3T3 murine fibroblasts, the autophosphorylation of PDGF-beta receptor in response to ligand (recombinant PDGF-BB homodimer) stimulation was profoundly suppressed. This same phenomenon of v-mos-mediated PDGF type-beta receptor autophosphorylation inhibition was also demonstrated in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. A v-mos mutant gene, which was incapable of binding ATP and was kinase-defective, did not block ligand-mediated receptor autophosphorylation. Factor(s) present in v-mos expressing fibroblasts, and found in the membrane fractions of these cells, dominantly inhibit the autophosphorylation of the PDGF type-beta receptor obtained from normal fibroblasts. This trans-acting factor does not appear to be a protein-tyrosine phosphatase. These findings suggest a role for mos, or a similar serine/threonine kinase, as a control mechanism in one of the earliest steps of the PDGF signal transduction pathway, and may provide a model for the functional interaction of mos with growth factor receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1586298634,"Myosin subfragment-1-induced polymerization of G-actin into arrowhead-decorated F-actin-myosin subfragment-1 (S1) filaments has been studied at low ionic strength and in the absence of ATP, using a combination of light scattering, fluorescence of 4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-7-yl- or pyrenyl-labeled actin, sedimentation, and electron microscopy techniques. When G-actin is in excess over myosin subfragment-1, the initial formation of fully decorated F-actin-S1 filaments, in which the actin:S1 molar ratio is 1:1, is followed by further incorporation of G-actin subunits in the polymer concomitant with the redistribution of the myosin heads along the polymer, leading to partially decorated filaments containing less than one S1/actin, in equilibrium with G-actin. This process leads to an overshoot in the light-scattering polymerization curves at high actin:S1 ratios. The concentration of G-actin at equilibrium with partially decorated filaments is a nonlinear function of the molar fraction of S1 in the polymer, indicating that actin-actin-S1 interactions are energetically more favorable than actin-actin or actin-S1-actin-S1 interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1557713431,"A novel system has been established to study transcription by RNA polymerase III. Purified wheat germ RNA polymerase III will initiate transcription on SV40 DNA templates amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Transcription initiates primarily at a thymidine 3 residues from a PvuII terminus at nucleotide 272 and terminates at a downstream A8:T8 sequence at nucleotides 21-28. Termination is enhanced if the RNA polymerase is caused to pause downstream of the A8:T8 sequence, but termination is unaffected by upstream sequences. Transcription of heteroduplex DNA templates with mismatches in the A8:T8 sequence indicates that termination is dependent upon the integrity of the A8 sequence in the template strand and is only slightly affected by changes in the T8 sequence of the non-template strand. However, templates containing 2'-deoxyuridine or 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine in place of thymidine in the non-template strand reduce termination efficiency, as does incorporation of 5'-bromouracil into RNA. There is no obvious correlation between DNA bending and termination efficiency."
