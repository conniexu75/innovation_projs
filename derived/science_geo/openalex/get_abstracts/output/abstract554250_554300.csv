https://openalex.org/W2292021561,"The most recent Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, which was unprecedented in the number of cases and fatalities, geographic distribution, and number of nations affected, highlights the need for safe, effective, and readily available antiviral agents for treatment and prevention of acute Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) or sequelae. No antiviral therapeutics have yet received regulatory approval or demonstrated clinical efficacy. Here we report the discovery of a novel small molecule GS-5734, a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analogue, with antiviral activity against EBOV. GS-5734 exhibits antiviral activity against multiple variants of EBOV and other filoviruses in cell-based assays. The pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) is efficiently formed in multiple human cell types incubated with GS-5734 in vitro, and the NTP acts as an alternative substrate and RNA-chain terminator in primer-extension assays using a surrogate respiratory syncytial virus RNA polymerase. Intravenous administration of GS-5734 to nonhuman primates resulted in persistent NTP levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (half-life, 14 h) and distribution to sanctuary sites for viral replication including testes, eyes, and brain. In a rhesus monkey model of EVD, once-daily intravenous administration of 10 mg kg(-1) GS-5734 for 12 days resulted in profound suppression of EBOV replication and protected 100% of EBOV-infected animals against lethal disease, ameliorating clinical disease signs and pathophysiological markers, even when treatments were initiated three days after virus exposure when systemic viral RNA was detected in two out of six treated animals. These results show the first substantive post-exposure protection by a small-molecule antiviral compound against EBOV in nonhuman primates. The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of GS-5734 in vitro against other pathogenic RNA viruses, including filoviruses, arenaviruses, and coronaviruses, suggests the potential for wider medical use. GS-5734 is amenable to large-scale manufacturing, and clinical studies investigating the drug safety and pharmacokinetics are ongoing."
https://openalex.org/W2279646467,"Translation of messenger RNAs lacking a stop codon results in the addition of a carboxy-terminal poly-lysine tract to the nascent polypeptide, causing ribosome stalling. Non-stop proteins and other stalled nascent chains are recognized by the ribosome quality control (RQC) machinery and targeted for proteasomal degradation. Failure of this process leads to neurodegeneration by unknown mechanisms. Here we show that deletion of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ltn1p in yeast, a key RQC component, causes stalled proteins to form detergent-resistant aggregates and inclusions. Aggregation is dependent on a C-terminal alanine/threonine tail that is added to stalled polypeptides by the RQC component, Rqc2p. Formation of inclusions additionally requires the poly-lysine tract present in non-stop proteins. The aggregates sequester multiple cytosolic chaperones and thereby interfere with general protein quality control pathways. These findings can explain the proteotoxicity of ribosome-stalled polypeptides and demonstrate the essential role of the RQC in maintaining proteostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2288876215,"In the mammalian navigational system, neurons have been identified in the CA2 region of the hippocampus that keep track of position when an animal is not moving. How does an animal know where it is when it stops moving? Hippocampal place cells fire at discrete locations as subjects traverse space, thereby providing an explicit neural code for current location during locomotion. In contrast, during awake immobility, the hippocampus is thought to be dominated by neural firing representing past and possible future experience. The question of whether and how the hippocampus constructs a representation of current location in the absence of locomotion has been unresolved. Here we report that a distinct population of hippocampal neurons, located in the CA2 subregion, signals current location during immobility, and does so in association with a previously unidentified hippocampus-wide network pattern. In addition, signalling of location persists into brief periods of desynchronization prevalent in slow-wave sleep. The hippocampus thus generates a distinct representation of current location during immobility, pointing to mnemonic processing specific to experience occurring in the absence of locomotion. Decades of research have shown that the mammalian navigational system, based in and around the hippocampus, keeps track of an animal's location during locomotion. Yet it was not clear whether and how the brain tracks location when animals stop moving. This study shows that the brain keeps track of location at all times, on the move and at rest. Loren Frank and colleagues identify a distinct population of hippocampal neurons in the CA2 region of the hippocampus that signal current location not only during awake immobility, but also during sleep."
https://openalex.org/W2290077000,"Wealth differences between individuals are ubiquitous in modern society, and often serve as the basis for biased social evaluations among adults. The present research probed whether children use cues that are commonly associated with wealth differences in society to guide their consideration of others. In Study 1, 4–5-year-old participants from diverse racial backgrounds expressed preferences for children who were paired with high-wealth cues; White children in Study 1 also matched high-wealth stimuli with White faces. Study 2 conceptually replicated the preference effect from Study 1, and showed that young children (4–6 years) also use material wealth indicators to guide their inferences about people’s relative standing in other domains (i.e., competence and popularity). Study 3 revealed that children (5–9 years) use a broad range of wealth cues to guide their evaluations of, and actions toward, unfamiliar people. Further, biased responses were not attenuated among children whose families were lower in socioeconomic status. Often overlooked by those who study children’s attitudes and stereotypes, social class markers appear to influence evaluations, inferences, and behavior early in development."
https://openalex.org/W2289769937,"Identifying key molecules that launch regeneration has been a long-sought goal. Multiple regenerative animals show an initial wound-associated proliferative response that transits into sustained proliferation if a considerable portion of the body part has been removed. In the axolotl, appendage amputation initiates a round of wound-associated cell cycle induction followed by continued proliferation that is dependent on nerve-derived signals. A wound-associated molecule that triggers the initial proliferative response to launch regeneration has remained obscure. Here, using an expression cloning strategy followed by in vivo gain- and loss-of-function assays, we identified axolotl MARCKS-like protein (MLP) as an extracellularly released factor that induces the initial cell cycle response during axolotl appendage regeneration. The identification of a regeneration-initiating molecule opens the possibility of understanding how to elicit regeneration in other animals."
https://openalex.org/W2230685186,"Bacterial biofilms are usually assumed to originate from individual cells deposited on a surface. However, many biofilm-forming bacteria tend to aggregate in the planktonic phase so that it is possible that many natural and infectious biofilms originate wholly or partially from pre-formed cell aggregates. Here, we use agent-based computer simulations to investigate the role of pre-formed aggregates in biofilm development. Focusing on the initial shape the aggregate forms on the surface, we find that the degree of spreading of an aggregate on a surface can play an important role in determining its eventual fate during biofilm development. Specifically, initially spread aggregates perform better when competition with surrounding unaggregated bacterial cells is low, while initially rounded aggregates perform better when competition with surrounding unaggregated cells is high. These contrasting outcomes are governed by a trade-off between aggregate surface area and height. Our results provide new insight into biofilm formation and development, and reveal new factors that may be at play in the social evolution of biofilm communities."
https://openalex.org/W2291998598,"Among terrestrial arthropods, the dragonfly species Pantala flavescens is remarkable due to their nearly global distribution and extensive migratory ranges; the largest of any known insect. Capable of migrating across oceans, the potential for high rates of gene flow among geographically distant populations is significant. It has been hypothesized that P. flavescens may be a global panmictic population but no sufficient genetic evidence has been collected thus far. Through a population genetic analysis of P. flavescens samples from North America, South America, and Asia, the current study aimed to examine the extent at which gene flow is occurring on a global scale and discusses the implications of the genetic patterns we uncovered on population structure and genetic diversity of the species. This was accomplished using PCR-amplified cytochrome oxidase one (CO1) mitochondrial DNA data to reconstruct phylogenetic trees, a haplotype network, and perform molecular variance analyses. Our results suggested high rates of gene flow are occurring among all included geographic regions; providing the first significant evidence that Pantala flavescens should be considered a global panmictic population."
https://openalex.org/W2289444717,"Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans are found together in the oral biofilms on dental surfaces, but little is known about the ecological interactions between these species. Here, we studied the effects of S. mutans UA159 on the growth and pathogencity of C. albicans. Initially, the effects of S. mutans on the biofilm formation and morphogenesis of C. albicans were tested in vitro. Next, we investigate the influence of S. mutans on pathogenicity of C. albicans using in vivo host models, in which the experimental candidiasis was induced in G. mellonella larvae and analyzed by survival curves, C. albicans count in hemolymph, and quantification of hyphae in the host tissues. In all the tests, we evaluated the direct effects of S. mutans cells, as well as the indirect effects of the subproducts secreted by this microorganism using a bacterial culture filtrate. The in vitro analysis showed that S. mutans cells favored biofilm formation by C. albicans. However, a reduction in biofilm viable cells and inhibition of hyphal growth was observed when C. albicans was in contact with the S. mutans culture filtrate. In the in vivo study, injection of S. mutans cells or S. mutans culture filtrate into G. mellonella larvae infected with C. albicans increased the survival of these animals. Furthermore, a reduction in hyphal formation was observed in larval tissues when C. albicans was associated with S. mutans culture filtrate. These findings suggest that S. mutans can secrete subproducts capable to inhibit the biofilm formation, morphogenesis and pathogenicity of C. albicans, attenuating the experimental candidiasis in G. mellonella model."
https://openalex.org/W2288931164,"Introduction Exact knowledge of femoral neck inclination and torsion angles is important in recognizing, understanding and treating pathologic conditions in the hip joint. However, published results vary widely between different studies, which indicates that there are persistent difficulties in carrying out exact measurements. Methods A three dimensional modeling and analytical technology was used for the analysis of 1070 CT datasets of skeletally mature femurs. Individual femoral neck angles and torsion angles were precisely computed, in order to establish whether gender, age, body mass index and ethnicity influence femoral neck angles and torsion angles. Results The median femoral neck angle was 122.2° (range 100.1–146.2°, IQR 117.9–125.6°). There are significant gender (female 123.0° vs. male 121.5°; p = 0.007) and ethnic (Asian 123.2° vs. Caucasian 121.9°; p = 0.0009) differences. The median femoral torsion angle was 14.2° (-23.6–48.7°, IQR 7.4–20.4°). There are significant gender differences (female 16.4° vs. male 12.1°; p = 0.0001). Femoral retroversion was found in 7.8% of the subjects. Conclusion Precise femoral neck and torsion angles were obtained in over one thousand cases. Systematic deviations in measurement due to human error were eliminated by using automated high accuracy morphometric analysis. Small but significant gender and ethnic differences were found in femoral neck and torsion angles."
https://openalex.org/W2301786020,"Background Fear of falling is an important risk indicator for adverse health related outcomes in older adults. However, factors associated with fear of falling among community-dwelling older adults are not well-explored. Objectives To explore the quality of life and associated factors in fear of falling among older people in the Shih-Pai area in Taiwan. Methods This community-based survey recruited three thousand eight hundred and twenty-four older adults aged ≥ 65 years. The measurements included a structured questionnaire, including quality of life by using Short-Form 36, and information of fear of falling, fall history, demographics, medical conditions, insomnia, sleep quality, depression and subjective health through face-to-face interviews. Results A total of 53.4% of participants reported a fear of falling. The rate of fear of falling was higher in female subjects. Subjects with fear of falling had lower Short Form-36 scores both for men and women. Falls in the previous year, older age, insomnia, depression and worse subjective health were correlates of fear of falling for both sexes. Male-specific associations with fear of falling were the accessibility of medical help in an emergency, diabetes mellitus and stroke. In parallel, cardiovascular diseases were a female-specific correlate for fear of falling. Conclusions Fear of falling is prevalent among community-dwelling older adults. It is seems that there are gender differences in fear of falling with respect to the prevalence and associated factors in older adults. Gender differences should be considered when planning prevention and intervention strategies for fear of falling among older people."
https://openalex.org/W2317505741,"Microneme secretion is essential for motility, invasion, and egress in apicomplexan parasites. Although previous studies indicate that Ca(2+) and cGMP control microneme secretion, little is known about how these pathways are naturally activated. Here we have developed genetically encoded indicators for Ca(2+) and microneme secretion to better define the signaling pathways that regulate these processes in Toxoplasma gondii We found that microneme secretion was triggered in vitro by exposure to a single host protein, serum albumin. The natural agonist serum albumin induced microneme secretion in a protein kinase G-dependent manner that correlated with increased cGMP levels. Surprisingly, serum albumin acted independently of elevated Ca(2+) and yet it was augmented by artificial agonists that raise Ca(2+), such as ethanol. Furthermore, although ethanol elevated intracellular Ca(2+), it alone was unable to trigger secretion without the presence of serum or serum albumin. This dichotomy was recapitulated by zaprinast, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that elevated cGMP and separately increased Ca(2+) in a protein kinase G-independent manner leading to microneme secretion. Taken together, these findings reveal that microneme secretion is centrally controlled by protein kinase G and that this pathway is further augmented by elevation of intracellular Ca(2.)"
https://openalex.org/W2294003171,"Increasing the yield of soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill) is a main aim of soybean breeding. The 100-seed weight is a critical factor for soybean yield. To facilitate genetic analysis of quantitative traits and to improve the accuracy of marker-assisted breeding in soybean, a valuable mapping population consisting of 194 chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) was developed. In these lines, different chromosomal segments of the Chinese cultivar Suinong 14 were substituted into the genetic background of wild soybean (Glycine soja Sieb. & Zucc.) ZYD00006. Based on these CSSLs, a genetic map covering the full genome was generated using 121 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. In the quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis, twelve main effect QTLs (qSW-B1-1/2/3, qSW-D1b-1/2, qSW-D2-1/2, qSW-G-1/2/3, qSW-M-2 and qSW-N-2) underlying 100-seed weight were identified in 2011 and 2012. The epistatic effects of pairwise interactions between markers were analyzed in 2011 and 2012. The results clearly demonstrated that these CSSLs could be used to identify QTLs, and that an epistatic analysis was able to detect several sites with important epistatic effects on 100-seed weight. Thus, we identified loci that will be valuable for improving soybean 100-seed weight. These results provide a valuable foundation for identifying the precise location of genes of interest, and for designing cloning and marker-assisted selection breeding strategies targeting the 100-seed weight of soybean."
https://openalex.org/W2289465703,"The life cycles of apicomplexan parasites progress in accordance with fluxes in cytosolic Ca2+. Such fluxes are necessary for events like motility and egress from host cells. We used genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (GCaMPs) to develop a cell-based phenotypic screen for compounds that modulate Ca2+ signaling in the model apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii. In doing so, we took advantage of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor zaprinast, which we show acts in part through cGMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase G; PKG) to raise levels of cytosolic Ca2+. We define the pool of Ca2+ regulated by PKG to be a neutral store distinct from the endoplasmic reticulum. Screening a library of 823 ATP mimetics, we identify both inhibitors and enhancers of Ca2+ signaling. Two such compounds constitute novel PKG inhibitors and prevent zaprinast from increasing cytosolic Ca2+. The enhancers identified are capable of releasing intracellular Ca2+ stores independently of zaprinast or PKG. One of these enhancers blocks parasite egress and invasion and shows strong antiparasitic activity against T. gondii. The same compound inhibits invasion of the most lethal malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Inhibition of Ca2+-related phenotypes in these two apicomplexan parasites suggests that depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by the enhancer may be an effective antiparasitic strategy. These results establish a powerful new strategy for identifying compounds that modulate the essential parasite signaling pathways regulated by Ca2+, underscoring the importance of these pathways and the therapeutic potential of their inhibition.

https://openalex.org/W2295229319,"Content analysis involves classification of textual, visual, or audio data. The inter-coder agreement is estimated by making two or more coders to classify the same data units, with subsequent comparison of their results. The existing methods of agreement estimation, e.g., Cohen's kappa, require that coders place each unit of content into one and only one category (one-to-one coding) from the pre-established set of categories. However, in certain data domains (e.g., maps, photographs, databases of texts and images), this requirement seems overly restrictive. The restriction could be lifted, provided that there is a measure to calculate the inter-coder agreement in the one-to-many protocol. Building on the existing approaches to one-to-many coding in geography and biomedicine, such measure, fuzzy kappa, which is an extension of Cohen's kappa, is proposed. It is argued that the measure is especially compatible with data from certain domains, when holistic reasoning of human coders is utilized in order to describe the data and access the meaning of communication."
https://openalex.org/W2294645254,"Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is frequently observed in severe asthma but the causal link between the 2 diseases remains hypothetical. The role of OSA-related systemic and airway neutrophilic inflammation in asthma bronchial inflammation or remodelling has been rarely investigated. The aim of this study was to compare hallmarks of inflammation in induced sputum and features of airway remodelling in bronchial biopsies from adult patients with severe asthma with and without OSA.An overnight polygraphy was performed in 55 patients referred for difficult-to-treat asthma, who complained of nocturnal respiratory symptoms, poor sleep quality or fatigue. We compared sputum analysis, reticular basement membrane (RBM) thickness, smooth muscle area, vascular density and inflammatory cell infiltration in bronchial biopsies.In total, 27/55 patients (49%) had OSA diagnosed by overnight polygraphy. Despite a moderate increase in apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI; 14.2 ± 1.6 event/h [5-35]), the proportion of sputum neutrophils was higher and that of macrophages lower in OSA than non-OSA patients, with higher levels of interleukin 8 and matrix metalloproteinase 9. The RBM was significantly thinner in OSA than non-OSA patients (5.8 ± 0.4 vs. 7.8 ± 0.4 μm, p<0.05). RBM thickness and OSA severity assessed by the AHI were negatively correlated (rho = -0.65, p<0.05). OSA and non-OSA patients did not differ in age, sex, BMI, lung function, asthma control findings or treatment.Mild OSA in patients with severe asthma is associated with increased proportion of neutrophils in sputum and changes in airway remodelling."
https://openalex.org/W2291450044,"Covalent modifications of histone N-terminal tails play a critical role in regulating chromatin structure and controlling gene expression. These modifications are controlled by histone-modifying enzymes and read out by histone-binding proteins. Numerous proteins have been identified as histone modification readers. Here we report the family-wide characterization of histone binding abilities of human CW domain-containing proteins. We demonstrate that the CW domains in ZCWPW2 and MORC3/4 selectively recognize histone H3 trimethylated at Lys-4, similar to ZCWPW1 reported previously, while the MORC1/2 and LSD2 lack histone H3 Lys-4 binding ability. Our crystal structures of the CW domains of ZCWPW2 and MORC3 in complex with the histone H3 trimethylated at Lys-4 peptide reveal the molecular basis of this interaction. In each complex, two tryptophan residues in the CW domain form the ""floor"" and ""right wall,"" respectively, of the methyllysine recognition cage. Our mutation results based on ZCWPW2 reveal that the right wall tryptophan residue is essential for binding, and the floor tryptophan residue enhances binding affinity. Our structural and mutational analysis highlights the conserved roles of the cage residues of CW domain across the histone methyllysine binders but also suggests why some CW domains lack histone binding ability."
https://openalex.org/W2290835105,"It is well recognized that assemblage structure of stream macroinvertebrates changes with alterations in catchment or local land use. Our objective was to understand how the trophic ecology of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages responds to land use changes in tropical streams. We used the isotope methodology to assess how energy flow and trophic relations among macroinvertebrates were affected in environments affected by different land uses (natural cover, pasture, sugar cane plantation). Macroinvertebrates were sampled and categorized into functional feeding groups, and available trophic resources were sampled and evaluated for the isotopic composition of 13C and 15N along streams located in the Cerrado (neotropical savanna). Streams altered by pasture or sugar cane had wider and more overlapped trophic niches, which corresponded to more generalist feeding habits. In contrast, trophic groups in streams with native vegetation had narrower trophic niches with smaller overlaps, suggesting greater specialization. Pasture sites had greater ranges of resources exploited, indicating higher trophic diversity than sites with natural cover and sugar cane plantation. We conclude that agricultural land uses appears to alter the food base and shift macroinvertebrate assemblages towards more generalist feeding behaviors and greater overlap of the trophic niches."

We enrolled adults with aggressive NHL in Malawi between June 2013 and May 2015. Chemotherapy and supportive care were standardized, and HIV+ patients received antiretroviral therapy (ART). Thirty-seven of 58 patients (64%) were HIV+. Median age was 47 years (IQR 39–56), and 35 (60%) were male. Thirty-five patients (60%) had stage III/IV, 43 (74%) B symptoms, and 28 (48%) performance status ≥2. B-cell NHL predominated among HIV+ patients, and all T-cell NHL occurred among HIV- individuals. Thirty-one HIV+ patients (84%) were on ART for a median 9.9 months (IQR 1.1–31.7) before NHL diagnosis, median CD4 was 121 cells/μL (IQR 61–244), and 43% had suppressed HIV RNA. HIV+ patients received a similar number of CHOP cycles compared to HIV- patients, but more frequently developed grade 3/4 neutropenia (84% vs 31%, p = 0.001), resulting in modestly lower cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin doses with longer intervals between cycles. Twelve-month overall survival (OS) was 45% (95% CI 31–57%). T-cell NHL (HR 3.90, p = 0.017), hemoglobin (HR 0.82 per g/dL, p = 0.017), albumin (HR 0.57 per g/dL, p = 0.019), and IPI (HR 2.02 per unit, p<0.001) were associated with mortality. HIV was not associated with mortality, and findings were similar among patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Twenty-three deaths were from NHL (12 HIV+, 11 HIV-), and 12 from CHOP (9 HIV+, 3 HIV-). CHOP can be safe, effective, and feasible for aggressive NHL in Malawi with and without HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2296544546,"C. albicans is a commensal yeast of the mucous membranes in healthy humans that can also cause disseminated candidiasis, mainly originating from the digestive tract, in vulnerable patients. It is necessary to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the interaction of C. albicans with enterocytes to better understand the basis of commensalism and pathogenicity of the yeast and to improve the management of disseminated candidiasis. In this study, we investigated the kinetics of tight junction (TJ) formation in parallel with the invasion of C. albicans into the Caco-2 intestinal cell line. Using invasiveness assays on Caco-2 cells displaying pharmacologically altered TJ (i.e. differentiated epithelial cells treated with EGTA or patulin), we were able to demonstrate that TJ protect enterocytes against invasion of C. albicans. Moreover, treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor of endocytosis decreased invasion of the fungus into Caco-2 cells displaying altered TJ, suggesting that facilitating access of the yeast to the basolateral side of intestinal cells promotes endocytosis of C. albicans in its hyphal form. These data were supported by SEM observations of differentiated Caco-2 cells displaying altered TJ, which highlighted membrane protrusions engulfing C. albicans hyphae. We furthermore demonstrated that Als3, a hypha-specific C. albicans invasin, facilitates internalization of the fungus by active penetration and induced endocytosis by differentiated Caco-2 cells displaying altered TJ. However, our observations failed to demonstrate binding of Als3 to E-cadherin as the trigger mechanism of endocytosis of C. albicans into differentiated Caco-2 cells displaying altered TJ."
https://openalex.org/W2288510342,"Theory predicts that monogamy is adaptive in resource-specialist symbiotic crustaceans inhabiting relatively small and morphologically simple hosts in tropical environments where predation risk away from hosts is high. We tested this prediction in Pontonia manningi, a hyper-symbiotic shrimp that dwells in the mantle cavity of the Atlantic winged oyster Pteria colymbus that, in turn, infects gorgonians from the genus Pseudopterogorgia in the Caribbean Sea. In agreement with theory, P. manningi were found dwelling as heterosexual pairs in oysters more frequently than expected by chance alone. Males and females also inhabited the same host individual independent of the female gravid condition or of the developmental stage of brooded embryos. While the observations above argue in favor of monogamy in P. manningi, there is evidence to suggest that males of the studied species are moderately promiscuous. That females found living solitary in oysters most often brooded embryos, and that males allocated more to weaponry (major claw size) than females at any given size suggest that males might be roaming among host individuals in search of and, fighting for, receptive females. All available information depicts a rather complex mating system in P. manningi: primarily monogamous but with moderately promiscuous males."
https://openalex.org/W2290154427,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that causes serious infections in immunocompromised hosts including severely burned patients. After multiplying within the burn wound, P. aeruginosa translocate into the bloodstream causing bacterial sepsis frequently leading to organ dysfunction and septic shock. Although the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infection of thermally-injured wounds has been extensively analyzed, little is known regarding the ability of P. aeruginosa to adapt and survive within the blood of severely burned patients during systemic infection. To identify such adaptations, transcriptome analyses (RNA-seq) were conducted on P. aeruginosa strain PA14 that was grown in whole blood from a healthy volunteer or three severely burned patients. Compared with growth in blood from healthy volunteers, growth of PA14 in the blood from severely burned patients significantly altered the expression of 2596 genes, with expression of 1060 genes enhanced, while that of 1536 genes was reduced. Genes whose expression was significantly reduced included genes related to quorum sensing, quorum sensing-controlled virulence factors and transport of heme, phosphate, and phosphonate. Genes whose expression was significantly enhanced were related to the type III secretion system, the pyochelin iron-acquisition system, flagellum synthesis, and pyocyanin production. We confirmed changes in expression of many of these genes using qRT-PCR. Although severe burns altered the levels of different blood components in each patient, the growth of PA14 in their blood produced similar changes in the expression of each gene. These results suggest that, in response to changes in the blood of severely burned patients and as part of its survival strategy, P. aeruginosa enhances the expression of certain virulence genes and reduces the expression of others."

Characterization of amide-AGEs in proteomes will help with understanding the development of glycation-associated pathologies by identifying the affected protein (function) and providing access to subtissue level changes of individual residues prone to such modifications. We recently reported a two-step procedure to detect AGE-modified residues in plasma samples using specific and sensitive precursor ion scans (43Greifenhagen U. Nguyen V.D. Moschner J. Giannis A.

Specific tandem mass spectrometric detection of AGE-modified arginine residues in peptides.J. Mass Spectrom. 2015; 50: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here, we extended this approach by using gas phase fractionation to detect amide-bound AGEs that have been previously identified in lens homogenate (41Smuda M. Henning C. Raghavan C.T. Johar K. Vasavada A.R. Nagaraj R.H. Glomb M.A. Comprehensive analysis of Maillard protein modifications in human lenses: effect of age and cataract.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 2500-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and as free adducts in human plasma and urine and found to be increased in uremic dialysis patients (45Henning C. Smuda M. Girndt M. Ulrich C. Glomb M.A. Molecular basis of Maillard amide-advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation in vivo.J. Biol.

These peptides were relatively quantified in plasma samples obtained from obese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with good or poor glycemic control and compared with healthy lean and obese persons. Chemicals and materials were from Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany): tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (≥98%), glycerin (≥99.5%); Biosolve (Valkenswaard, Netherlands): acetonitrile (≥99.97%); AppliChem (Darmstadt, Germany): Tris (ultrapure); Serva Electrophoresis (Heidelberg, Germany): acrylamide/bis solution (37.5/1, 30% (w/v), 2.6% C), ammonium persulfate (analytical), N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (research), Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (pure), porcine trypsin (NB premium grade); Riedel-de-Haën (Seelze, Germany): bromophenole blue (reagent); Objective (Berlin, Germany): PicoTip online nano-ESI emitter (standard coating; outer diameter 360/20 μm and tip internal diameter 10 μm); Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH (Göttingen, Germany): Vivaspin filter devices (5000 molecular weight cut-off); Sigma-Aldrich: ammonium hydrogen carbonate, formic acid (∼98%), 2-mercaptoethanol (≥99.0%). Water was purified in house (resistance ≥ 18 mΩ, total organic content < 1 ppb) with a PureLab Ultra Analytic System (ELGA Lab Water, Celle, Germany). Blood was obtained from male healthy, normoglycemic persons (HbA1c < 5.6%; fasting plasma glucose < 6.0 mmol/liter) categorized as lean (body mass index < 25 kg/m2, n = 6) or obese (body mass index > 30 kg/m2, n = 5), as well as from obese T2DM patients (HbA1c > 6.5%, fasting plasma glucose > 6.0 mmol/liter) being under poor (HbA1c > 7.5%, n = 5) or good glycemic control (HbA1c = 6–7%, n = 6). Cohorts were matched for age (50 years) and, in case of obese cohorts, for body mass index (supplemental Table S1). All blood samples were collected between 8 and 9 am after a 12-h fast in EDTA-treated tubes, blood cells were removed from plasma by centrifugation for 10 min at 2,000 × g, and the separated plasma was stored at −80 °C. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Leipzig (approval no. 159-12-21052012), and all subjects gave written informed consent before taking part in the study. Plasma samples (100 μl) were depleted of lipids by centrifugation (9168 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), an aliquot (20 μl) diluted 10-fold with ammonium hydrogen carbonate buffer (0.1 mol/liter, pH 8.0), and desalted using ultrafiltration (Vivaspin filter devices, 0.5 ml, 5-kDa cut-off). Protein concentrations were determined by a Bradford assay (46Bradford M.M. Rapid and sensitive method for quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). Briefly, acidic Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 solution (0.1 g/liter in 10% (v/v) H3PO4, 5% (v/v) aqueous ethanol, 250 μl) was mixed with the protein sample (5 μl) in a 96-well microtiter plate, and the absorption was recorded in two replicates at 595 nm. Quantification relied on a 2-fold dilution series of BSA (1000 to 62.5 μg/liter). Plasma aliquots corresponding to a protein content of 25 μg were complemented with SDS (10% (w/v) in water, 2 μl) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (50 mmol/liter in water, 2 μl), diluted with aqueous ammonium hydrogen carbonate buffer (50 mmol/liter, pH 8.0) to obtain a final volume of 20 μl, and incubated at 60 °C for 15 min. The samples were cooled to room temperature, alkylated with iodoacetamide (0.1 mol/liter, 2.2 μl) in the darkness (15 min, room temperature), and digested with trypsin (25 mg/liter in 50 mmol/liter ammonium hydrogen carbonate, 50 μl, 37 °C, overnight). The digest was frozen and stored at −80 °C. An aliquot (2 μg protein) of the sample was diluted with sample buffer (0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 62.5 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerin, 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) at least 2-fold and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (T = 12%, C = 2.65%) (47Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during assembly of head of bacteriophage-t4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) and stained with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G 250 (48Neuhoff V. Stamm R. Eibl H. Clear background and highly sensitive protein staining with coomassie blue dyes in polyacrylamide gels: a systematic analysis.Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 427-448Crossref Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The digestion step was considered complete (> 99%) when the original HSA band was not detected. Plasma samples (75 ng) were loaded on a nanoAcquity UPLC SymmetryTM trap column using a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 5 min and separated on a nanoAcquity UPLC BEH130TM column (30 °C) using a nanoAcquityTM UPLC System equipped with an Acquity sample manager (10 μl of injection volume, full loop injection) and a nanoAcquity UPLC binary solvent manager (Waters, Eschborn, Germany). Eluents A and B were water and acetonitrile, respectively, both containing formic acid (0.1% v/v). The peptides were eluted with a linear, two-step gradient (3 → 50% eluent B in 45 min, 50 → 85% eluent B in 2 min) at a flow rate of 0.4 μl/min. The column was connected via a PicoTip online nano-ESI emitter to a nanoESI-Orbitrap-MS (LTQ Orbitrap XL ETD) operated in positive ion mode and controlled by Xcalibur 2.0.7 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Mass spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000. Tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) were recorded for the six most intense signals (z ≥ 2) of an Orbitrap survey scan by data-dependent acquisition in the linear ion trap. Tandem mass spectra were analyzed with Sequest against the SwissProt database using Proteome Discoverer 1.1.0.263 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Amide-AGE-modified peptides identified with an Xcorr below 2.20 for doubly and 3.75 for triply protonated ions were manually confirmed (49Wolters D.A. Washburn M.P. Yates 3rd, J.R. An automated multidimensional protein identification technology for shotgun proteomics.Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 5683-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). Relative, label-free quantification relied on the integration of extracted ion chromatograms (m/z ± 0.02) for each of the three technical replicates acquired per sample (supplemental Table S2). Cohort comparison, statistical calculations, and graphical display were performed with the software GraphPad Prism 5.02 testing the technical replicates’ averages within a cohort first for normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, α = 0.05). If both cohorts to be compared showed normal distribution, a t test was performed to assess the significance of differences. Otherwise, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used (both two-sided, α = 0.05). Correlation analysis was performed using linear regression. A pooled tryptic plasma digest obtained from five poorly controlled T2DM patients was analyzed repeatedly by nano-reversed phase-UPLC-ESI-linear ion trap-Orbitrap-MS in gas phase fractionation mode by splitting the m/z range from 400 to 1400 in 18 consecutive intervals. When the tandem mass spectra acquired in data-dependent acquisition mode were searched for amide-AGE-modified peptides, 2 glycerinylated, 7 acetylated, and 10 formylated peptides were identified corresponding to 11 proteins (Table 1) within the 2626 peptides identified with high and medium confidence by Sequest.

https://openalex.org/W2291970866,"Proximity-dependent trans-biotinylation by the Escherichia coli biotin ligase BirA mutant R118G (BirA*) allows stringent streptavidin affinity purification of proximal proteins. This so-called BioID method provides an alternative to the widely used co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) to identify protein-protein interactions. Here, we used BioID, on its own and combined with co-IP, to identify proteins involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a post-transcriptional mRNA turnover pathway that targets mRNAs that fail to terminate translation properly. In particular, we expressed BirA* fused to the well characterized NMD factors UPF1, UPF2 and SMG5 and detected by liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) the streptavidin-purified biotinylated proteins. While the identified already known interactors confirmed the usefulness of BioID, we also found new potentially important interactors that have escaped previous detection by co-IP, presumably because they associate only weakly and/or very transiently with the NMD machinery. Our results suggest that SMG5 only transiently contacts the UPF1-UPF2-UPF3 complex and that it provides a physical link to the decapping complex. In addition, BioID revealed among others CRKL and EIF4A2 as putative novel transient interactors with NMD factors, but whether or not they have a function in NMD remains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W2291128271,"The earliest eutherian mammals were small-bodied locomotor generalists with a forelimb morphology that strongly resembles that of extant rats. Understanding the kinematics of the humerus, radius, and ulna of extant rats can inform and constrain hypotheses concerning typical posture and mobility in early eutherian forelimbs. The locomotion of Rattus norvegicus has been extensively studied, but the three-dimensional kinematics of the bones themselves remains under-explored. Here, for the first time, we use markerless XROMM (Scientific Rotoscoping) to explore the three-dimensional long bone movements in Rattus norvegicus during a normal, symmetrical gait (walking). Our data show a basic kinematic profile that agrees with previous studies on rats and other small therians: rats maintain a crouched forelimb posture throughout the step cycle, and the ulna is confined to flexion/extension in a parasagittal plane. However, our three-dimensional data illuminate long-axis rotation (LAR) movements for both the humerus and the radius for the first time. Medial LAR of the humerus throughout stance maintains an adducted elbow with a caudally-facing olecranon process, which in turn maintains a cranially-directed manus orientation (pronation). The radius also shows significant LAR correlated with manus pronation and supination. Moreover, we report that elbow flexion and manus orientation are correlated in R. norvegicus: as the elbow angle becomes more acute, manus supination increases. Our data also suggest that manus pronation and orientation in R. norvegicus rely on a divided system of labor between the ulna and radius. Given that the radius follows the flexion and extension trajectory of the ulna, it must rotate at the elbow (on the capitulum) so that during the stance phase its distal end lies medial to ulna, ensuring that the manus remains pronated while the forelimb is supporting the body. We suggest that forelimb posture and kinematics in Juramaia, Eomaia, and other basal eutherians were grossly similar to those of rats, and that humerus and radius LAR may have always played a significant role in forelimb and manus posture in small eutherian mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2294307655,"As the major crops in north China, spring crops are usually planted from April through May every spring and harvested in fall. Wheat is also a very common crop traditionally planted in fall or spring and harvested in summer year by year. This continuous cropping system exhibited the disadvantages of reducing the fertility of soil through decreasing microbial diversity. Thus, management of microbial diversity in the rhizosphere plays a vital role in sustainable crop production. In this study, ten common spring crops in north China were chosen sole-cropped and four were chosen intercropped with peanut in wheat fields after harvest. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and DNA sequencing of one 16S rDNA fragment were used to analyze the bacterial diversity and species identification. DGGE profiles showed the bacterial community diversity in rhizosphere soil samples varied among various crops under different cropping systems, more diverse under intercropping system than under sole-cropping. Some intercropping-specific bands in DGGE profiles suggested that several bacterial species were stimulated by intercropping systems specifically. Furthermore, the identification of these dominant and functional bacteria by DNA sequencing indicated that intercropping systems are more beneficial to improve soil fertility. Compared to intercropping systems, we also observed changes in microbial community of rhizosphere soil under sole-crops. The rhizosphere bacterial community structure in spring crops showed a strong crop species-specific pattern. More importantly, Empedobacter brevis, a typical plant pathogen, was only found in the carrot rhizosphere, suggesting carrot should be sown prudently. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that crop species and cropping systems had significant effects on bacterial community diversity in the rhizosphere soils. We strongly suggest sorghum, glutinous millet and buckwheat could be taken into account as intercropping crops with peanut; while hulled oat, mung bean or foxtail millet could be considered for sowing in wheat fields after harvest in North China."
https://openalex.org/W2291525537,"Owls have developed serrations, comb-like structures, along the leading edge of their wings. Serrations were investigated from a morphological and a mechanical point of view, but were not yet quantitatively compared for different species. Such a comparative investigation of serrations from species of different sizes and activity patterns may provide new information about the function of the serrations.Serrations on complete wings and on tenth primary remiges of seven owl species were investigated. Small, middle-sized, and large owl species were investigated as well as species being more active during the day and owls being more active during the night. Serrations occurred at the outer parts of the wings, predominantly at tenth primary remiges, but also on further wing feathers in most species. Serration tips were oriented away from the feather rachis so that they faced into the air stream during flight. The serrations of nocturnal owl species were higher developed as demonstrated by a larger inclination angle (the angle between the base of the barb and the rachis), a larger tip displacement angle (the angle between the tip of the serration and the base of the serration) and a longer length. Putting the measured data into a clustering algorithm yielded dendrograms that suggested a strong influence of activity pattern, but only a weak influence of size on the development of the serrations.Serrations are supposed to be involved in noise reduction during flight and also depend on the aerodynamic properties that in turn depend on body size. Since especially nocturnal owls have to rely on hearing during prey capture, the more pronounced serrations of nocturnal species lend further support to the notion that serrations have an important function in noise reduction. The differences in shape of the serrations investigated indicate that a silent flight requires well-developed serrations."
https://openalex.org/W2294763393,"It has been reported that hyporesponsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) is associated with adverse events in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). However, it has not been determined whether higher iron storage is associated with an improved response, including better survival, to ESA.We measured serum ferritin, hemoglobin (Hb), and transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels every three months for two years in 1,095 MHD patients. The weekly dose of ESA to Hb ratio was also calculated as an index of ESA responsiveness (ERI).A significant correlation (p<0.001, R = 0.89) between ferritin and Hb was only observed in the patients with ferritin levels <50 ng/mL. High-dose (≥50 mg/week) intravenous iron administration, female sex, low serum albumin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker use were significant predictors of a high ERI value (>280); however, serum ferritin and TSAT levels did not predict a higher ERI. In the time-dependent Cox hazard model, the risk for a composite event in the patients with a high ERI (≥280) and a high ferritin level (≥100 ng/mL) was significantly greater (hazard ratio [HR], 2.09, P = 0.033) than that for patients with a high ERI and a low ferritin (<100 ng/mL) level.Hb was dependent upon ferritin levels in patients with ferritin levels <50 ng/mL but not in patients with ferritin levels ≥50 ng/mL. Patients with hyporesponsiveness to ESA had a greater risk of composite events, but ERI was unrelated to iron storage."
https://openalex.org/W2290711685,"Background Online social networks present wide-reaching and flexible platforms through which to deliver health interventions to targeted populations. This study used a social marketing approach to explore teenage girls’ perceptions of physical activity and the potential use of online social networks to receive a physical activity intervention. Methods Six focus groups were conducted with 19 Australian teenage girls (ages 13 to 18 years) with varying levels of physical activity and socioeconomic status. A semi-structured format was used, with groups discussion transcribed verbatim. Content analysis identified emergent themes, with triangulation and memos used to ensure accuracy. Results Physical activity was most appealing when it emphasised sport, exercise and fitness, along with opportunities for socialisation with friends and self-improvement. Participants were receptive to delivery of a physical activity intervention via online social networks, with Facebook the most widely reported site. Participants commonly accessed online social networks via mobile devices and particularly smartphones. Undesirable features included promotion of physical activity in terms of walking; use of cartoon imagery; use of humour; and promotion of the intervention via schools, each of which were considered “uncool”. Participants noted that their parents were likely to be supportive of them using an online social networking physical activity intervention, particularly if not promoted as a weight loss intervention. Conclusion This study identified key features likely to increase the feasibility and retention of an online social networking physical activity intervention for teenage girls. Guidelines for the design of interventions for teenage girls are provided for future applications."
https://openalex.org/W2293313566,"Background and Objective Recently, there are few studies reporting on depressive status and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in China. A large-sample survey was to be performed to explore the prevalence of depressive status and related factors in Chinese patients with OSA. Methods From among a randomly-selected group of OSA patients, 1,327 met inclusion criteria. After screening with the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), patients were assigned to OSA without depressive status (control group, n = 698) and OSA with depressive status (n = 629) groups. Using chi-squared testing, the correlation analyses between the depressive status and OSA patient demographic and clinical variables were tested. Then depression-related risk factors in OSA patients were analysed using stepwise linear regression analysis. The effects of family and social factors on depressive status in OSA patients were investigated using Mann-Whitney U (one of nonparametric test). Results The prevalence of depressive status was 47.4% in OSA patients. Depressive status was significantly associated with female gender, single status, Family Burden Scale of Disease (FBS), Family APGAR Index (APGAR), apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI), and Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS). Stepwise linear regression analysis further indicated that single status, hypoxemia, APGAR, AHI, PSSS, AHI, and FBS were all risk factors for depressive status in OSA patients. The total of the FBS score and three of its sub-factors scores (family daily activities, family relationships and mental health of family members) were higher, and the total of the APGAR score and two of its sub-factors scores (adaptability and affection) were lower in OSA with depressive status compared with the control group. Besides, the total score for the PSSS and scores for its two sub-factors (family support and social support) were all lower in OSA patients with depressive status than those of the control group. Conclusions Depressive status has high comorbid rate in Chinese OSA patients and is significantly associated with single status, apnoea-hypopnea index, hypoxemia, family and social supports."
https://openalex.org/W2289338272,"A new cryptic species of bush frog Raorchestes honnametti sp. nov. is described from the south-eastern part of the Western Ghats, India. This newly described species belongs to the Charius clade and is morphologically similar to other clade members—R. charius and R. griet. Therefore, an integrative taxonomic approach based on molecular and bioacoustic analysis along with morphology was used to delimit the new species. Raorchestes honnametti sp. nov., is currently known only from Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve, a part of Biligiri Rangaswamy horst mountain range (a mountain formed due movement of two faults) formed during the Late Quaternary period (1.8–2.58 Ma). Discovery of cryptic species from a highly speciose and well-studied genus Raorchestes hints at the possible existence of several more cryptic species in this genus. We discuss the possible reasons for crypsis and emphasize the need for continued systematic surveys of amphibians across the Western Ghats."
https://openalex.org/W2288884267,"Infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) has been linked to various gastro-intestinal diseases; nevertheless it remains to be clarified why only a minority of infected individuals develop illness. Studies from the West have indicated that the cagA gene and the associated EPIYA genotype of H. pylori is closely linked to the development of severe gastritis and gastric carcinoma; however, as yet no consistent correlation has been found among the bacteria from East Asia. In addition to genotype variation, the CagA protein undergoes fragmentation; however, the functional significance of fragmentation with respect to H. pylori infection remains unknown. In this study, we isolated 594 H. pylori colonies from 99 patients and examined the fragmentation patterns of CagA protein using immunoblotting. By analyzing the ability of the isolates to induce the host cell morphological transition to the highly invasive hummingbird phenotype, we demonstrated that H. pylori colonies with substantial CagA fragmentation are less potent in terms of causing this morphological transition. Our results uncovered a functional role for CagA fragmentation with respect to H. pylori-induced hummingbird phenotype formation and these findings suggest the possibility that the post-translational processing of CagA may be involved in H. pylori infection pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2292234022,"Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) leads to depression of evoked synaptic transmission, for which the mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that increased presynaptic [Ca2+]i during transient OGD contributes to the depression of evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs). Additionally, we hypothesized that increased buffering of intracellular calcium would shorten electrophysiological recovery after transient ischemia. Mouse hippocampal slices were exposed to 2 to 8 min of OGD. fEPSPs evoked by Schaffer collateral stimulation were recorded in the stratum radiatum, and whole cell current or voltage clamp recordings were performed in CA1 neurons. Transient ischemia led to increased presynaptic [Ca2+]i, (shown by calcium imaging), increased spontaneous miniature EPSP/Cs, and depressed evoked fEPSPs, partially mediated by adenosine. Buffering of intracellular Ca2+ during OGD by membrane-permeant chelators (BAPTA-AM or EGTA-AM) partially prevented fEPSP depression and promoted faster electrophysiological recovery when the OGD challenge was stopped. The blocker of BK channels, charybdotoxin (ChTX), also prevented fEPSP depression, but did not accelerate post-ischemic recovery. These results suggest that OGD leads to elevated presynaptic [Ca2+]i, which reduces evoked transmitter release; this effect can be reversed by increased intracellular Ca2+ buffering which also speeds recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2291140493,"Background School aged children are a key link in the transmission of influenza. Most cases have little or no interaction with health services and are therefore missed by the majority of existing surveillance systems. As part of a public engagement with science project, this study aimed to establish a web-based system for the collection of routine school absence data and determine if school absence prevalence was correlated with established surveillance measures for circulating influenza. Methods We collected data for two influenza seasons (2011/12 and 2012/13). The primary outcome was daily school absence prevalence (weighted to make it nationally representative) for children aged 11 to 16. School absence prevalence was triangulated graphically and through univariable linear regression to Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) influenza like illness (ILI) episode incidence rate, national microbiological surveillance data on the proportion of samples positive for influenza (A+B) and with Rhinovirus, RSV and laboratory confirmed cases of Norovirus. Results 27 schools submitted data over two respiratory seasons. During the first season, levels of influenza measured by school absence prevalence and established surveillance were low. In the 2012/13 season, a peak of school absence prevalence occurred in week 51, and week 1 in RCGP ILI surveillance data. Linear regression showed a strong association between the school absence prevalence and RCGP ILI (All ages, and 5–14 year olds), laboratory confirmed cases of influenza A & B, and weak evidence for a linear association with Rhinovirus and Norovirus. Interpretation This study provides initial evidence for using routine school illness absence prevalence as a novel tool for influenza surveillance. The network of web-based data collection platforms we established through active engagement provides an innovative model of conducting scientific research and could be used for a wide range of infectious disease studies in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2296415238,"Background Violence against sex workers can heighten their vulnerability to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Evidence suggests the risk of acquiring STI/HIV infections among female sex workers (FSWs) who have experienced violence to be almost three-times higher than FSWs, who have not experienced violence. Moreover, an experience of physical and sexual violence makes it difficult for them to negotiate safer sex with their partners and often act as a barrier to utilization of prevention services. Methods This study utilizes data from 2785 FSWs aged 18 years and above who participated in a cross-sectional behavioural study conducted during 2013–14 in Thane district, Maharashtra. A probability-based two-stage cluster sampling method was used for data collection. This study assesses the effect of physical violence on self-reported STI symptoms (any STI and multiple STIs) and treatment seeking for the last STI symptom using propensity score matching method. Results About 18% of sampled FSWs reported physical violence at the time of the survey. The likelihood of experiencing such violence was significantly higher among FSWs who solicited clients at public places, engaged in other economic activities apart from sex work, had savings, and reported high client volume per week. FSWs experiencing violence were also inconsistent condom users while engaging in sex with regular partners and clients. The average adjusted effect of violence clearly depicted an increase in the risk of any STI (11%, p<0.05) and multiple STIs (8%, p<0.10) and reduction in treatment seeking (10%, p<0.05). Conclusions This study demonstrates a significant effect of physical violence on reporting of any STI symptom and treatment seeking. Findings call for the immediate inclusion of strategies aimed to address violence related challenges in HIV prevention program currently being provided at Thane district. Such strategies would further help in enhancing the access to tailored STI prevention and care services among FSWs in the district."
https://openalex.org/W2288384306,"Avian annual survival has received much attention, yet little is known about seasonal patterns in survival, especially of migratory passerines. In order to evaluate survival rates and timing of mortality within the breeding season of adult reed warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), mark-recapture data were collected in southwest Poland, between 2006 and 2012. A total of 612 individuals (304 females and 308 males) were monitored throughout the entire breeding season, and their capture-recapture histories were used to model survival rates. Males showed higher survival during the breeding season (0.985, 95% CI: 0.941–0.996) than females (0.869, 95% CI: 0.727–0.937). Survival rates of females declined with the progression of the breeding season (from May to August), while males showed constant survival during this period. We also found a clear pattern within the female (but not male) nesting cycle: survival was significantly lower during the laying, incubation, and nestling periods (0.934, 95% CI: 0.898–0.958), when birds spent much time on the nest, compared to the nest building and fledgling periods (1.000, 95% CI: 1.00–1.000), when we did not record any female mortality. These data (coupled with some direct evidence, like bird corpses or blood remains found next to/on the nest) may suggest that the main cause of adult mortality was on-nest predation. The calculated survival rates for both sexes during the breeding season were high compared to annual rates reported for this species, suggesting that a majority of mortality occurs at other times of the year, during migration or wintering. These results have implications for understanding survival variation within the reproductive period as well as general trends of avian mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2296127195,"Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), the most common congenital malformation of the gut, is regulated by multiple signal transduction pathways. Several components of these pathways are important targets for microRNAs (miRNAs). Multiple miRNAs have been associated with the pathophysiology of HSCR, and serum miRNAs profiles of HSCR patients have been reported, but miRNA expression in HSCR colon tissue is almost completely unexplored. Using microarray technology, we screened colon tissue to detect miRNAs whose expression profiles were altered in HSCR and identify targets of differentially expressed miRNAs. Following filtering of low-intensity signals, data normalization, and volcano plot filtering, we identified 168 differentially expressed miRNAs (104 up-regulated and 64 down-regulated). Fifty of these mRNAs represent major targets of dysegulated miRNAs and may thus important roles in the pathophysiology of HSCR. Pathway analysis revealed that 7 of the miRNA targets encode proteins involved in regulation of cell proliferation and migration via RET and related signaling pathways (MAPK and PI3K/AKT). Our results identify miRNAs that play key roles in the pathophysiology of the complex multi-factorial disease HSCR."
https://openalex.org/W2292010288,"The presence of replication-competent HIV-1 –which resides mainly in resting CD4+ T cells–is a major hurdle to its eradication. While pharmacological approaches have been useful for inducing the expression of this latent population of virus, they have been unable to purge HIV-1 from all its reservoirs. Additionally, many of these strategies have been associated with adverse effects, underscoring the need for alternative approaches capable of reactivating viral expression. Here we show that engineered transcriptional modulators based on customizable transcription activator-like effector (TALE) proteins can induce gene expression from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter, and that combinations of TALE transcription factors can synergistically reactivate latent viral expression in cell line models of HIV-1 latency. We further show that complementing TALE transcription factors with Vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, enhances HIV-1 expression in latency models. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that TALE transcription factors are a potentially effective alternative to current pharmacological routes for reactivating latent virus and that combining synthetic transcriptional activators with histone deacetylase inhibitors could lead to the development of improved therapies for latent HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2294587004,"Ubiquitination is a relevant cell regulatory mechanism to determine protein fate and function. Most data has focused on the role of ubiquitin as a tag molecule to target substrates to proteasome degradation, and on its impact in the control of cell cycle, protein homeostasis and cancer. Only recently, systematic assays have pointed to the relevance of the ubiquitin pathway in the development and differentiation of tissues and organs, and its implication in hereditary diseases. Moreover, although the activity and composition of ubiquitin ligases has been largely addressed, the role of the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in specific tissues, such as the retina, remains mainly unknown. In this work, we undertook a systematic analysis of the transcriptional levels of DUB genes in the adult mouse retina by RT-qPCR and analyzed the expression pattern by in situ hybridization and fluorescent immunohistochemistry, thus providing a unique spatial reference map of retinal DUB expression. We also performed a systematic phylogenetic analysis to understand the origin and the presence/absence of DUB genes in the genomes of diverse animal taxa that represent most of the known animal diversity. The expression landscape obtained supports the potential subfunctionalization of paralogs in those families that expanded in vertebrates. Overall, our results constitute a reference framework for further characterization of the DUB roles in the retina and suggest new candidates for inherited retinal disorders."

Annual incidence and mortality were calculated: cases to 100,000 women per year. Data was analyzed using glm and apc packages of R. Breast cancer incidence and mortality increased with age. Secular rise in breast cancer incidence and decline in mortality was observed for period 1999-2008. Breast cancer incidence and mortality declined with cohorts; cohorts 1950s showed highest incidence and mortality. Age-cohort best explained incidence and mortality followed by age-period-cohort with overall declining trends. Declining age-cohort mortality could be probable. Declining age-cohort incidence would require future biological explanations or rendered statistical artefact. Cohorts 1949-1958 could be unique in having highest incidence and mortality in recent time or future period associations could emerge relatively stronger to cohort to provide additional explanation of temporal change over cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W2288504117,"The most relevant therapeutic approaches to treat CML rely on the administration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like Imatinib, which are able to counteract the activity of Bcr-Abl protein increasing patient's life expectancy and survival. Unfortunately, there are some issues TKIs are not able to address; first of all TKIs are not so effective in increasing survival of patients in blast crisis, second they are not able to eradicate leukemic stem cells (LSC) which represent the major cause of disease relapse, and third patients often develop resistance to TKIs due to mutations in the drug binding site. For all these reasons it's of primary interest to find alternative strategies to treat CML. Literature shows that Hedgehog signaling pathway is involved in LSC maintenance, and pharmacological inhibition of Smoothened (SMO), one of the key molecules of the pathway, has been demonstrated to reduce Bcr-Abl positive bone marrow cells and LSC. Consequently, targeting SMO could be a promising way to develop a new treatment strategy for CML overcoming the limitations of current therapies. In our work we have tested some compounds able to inhibit SMO, and among them MRT92 appears to be a very potent SMO antagonist. We found that almost all our compounds were able to reduce Gli1 protein levels in K-562 and in KU-812 CML cell lines. Furthermore, they were also able to increase Gli1 and SMO RNA levels, and to reduce cell proliferation and induce apoptosis/autophagy in both the tested cell lines. Finally, we demonstrated that our compounds were able to modulate the expression of some miRNAs related to Hedgehog pathway such as miR-324-5p and miR-326. Being Hedgehog pathway deeply implicated in the mechanisms of CML we may conclude that it could be a good therapeutic target for CML and our compounds seem to be promising antagonists of such pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2294852504,"Lipopolysaccharide dispersed in the blood by Gram-negative bacteria can be a potent inducer of septic shock. One research focus has been based on antibody sequestration of lipid A (the endotoxic principle of LPS); however, none have been successfully developed into a clinical treatment. Comparison of a panel of anti-lipid A antibodies reveals highly specific antibodies produced through distinct germ line precursors. The structures of antigen-binding fragments for two homologous mAbs specific for lipid A, S55-3 and S55-5, have been determined both in complex with lipid A disaccharide backbone and unliganded. These high resolution structures reveal a conserved positively charged pocket formed within the complementarity determining region H2 loops that binds the terminal phosphates of lipid A. Significantly, this motif occurs in unrelated antibodies where it mediates binding to negatively charged moieties through a range of epitopes, including phosphorylated peptides used in diagnostics and therapeutics. S55-3 and S55-5 have combining sites distinct from anti-lipid A antibodies previously described (as a result of their separate germ line origin), which are nevertheless complementary both in shape and charge to the antigen. S55-3 and S55-5 display similar avidity toward lipid A despite possessing a number of different amino acid residues in their combining sites. Binding of lipid A occurs independent of the acyl chains, although the GlcN-O6 attachment point for the core oligosaccharide is buried in the combining site, which explains their inability to recognize LPS. Despite their lack of therapeutic potential, the observed motif may have significant immunological implications as a tool for engineering recombinant antibodies.

The different germ line origins of the published antibodies specific for lipid A is especially interesting given that none bind intact LPS. Antibodies S55-3 and S55-5 stem from different germ lines than S1-15 and A6 and show significantly different reactivities toward differentially phosphorylated variants of lipid A. We now report binding data and crystal structures of unliganded and liganded antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) for lipid A-binding mAbs, S55-3 and S55-5, as a step toward the elucidation of the basis for specificity toward lipid A. The lipid A backbone β-d-GlcN4P(1→6)α-d-GlcN1P (BBP) of Escherichia coli was prepared as described (40.Holst O. Müller-Loennies S. Lindner B. Brade H. Chemical structure of the lipid A of Escherichia coli J-5.Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 10.9 mg (20 μmol) of BBP were transferred into 2 ml of NaHCO3 saturated, 1 ml of CHCl3, and 1 mmol of chloroacetic anhydride (dissolved in 1 m dioxane). After reaction for 30 min at 0 °C, the sample was kept at room temperature for 1 h followed by a second addition of the same amount of chloroacetic anhydride. Saturated NaHCO3 was then added to adjust the pH between 8 and 9. The reaction was continued for 18 h at room temperature under stirring. The aqueous phase was collected, and the organic phase re-extracted twice with water. The water phases were combined, and the sample was dried in a vacuum by rotary evaporation. Gel filtration using Sephadex G-10 (1.5 × 68 cm) gave 11.9 mg of product (BBP-CA) after lyophilization (84% yield). For ammonolysis, BBP-CA (11.9 mg) was then dissolved in 1 ml of (NH4)2CO3 saturated, and a small amount of solid (NH4)2CO3 was additionally added, and the sample was kept at 85 °C for 18 h, then desalted on Sephadex G-10 in 10 mm NH4HCO3, and lyophilized (BBP-bis-glycine, yield 9.8 mg, 15.6 μmol, 78%). The BBP-bis-glycine was conjugated to bovine serum albumin with divinyl sulfone (DVS) as described previously (39.Houen G. Jensen O.M. Conjugation to preactivated proteins using divinylsulfone and oodoacetic acid.J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 181: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One hundred fifty μl of DVS-BSA (75 nmol) were mixed with 200 μl of BBP-bis-glycine (containing 3.75 μmol, ratio 1:50) and 100 μl of Na2CO3 saturated in water. After 48 h at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 1 m glycine and incubation for 2 h at room temperature. The sample was purified by gel filtration using Sephadex G-50 in NH4HCO3 and lyophilized (BBP-bis-Gly-DVS-BSA). After determination of the protein concentration, the sample was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline to make a 1 mg/ml solution and sterile-filtered. The ligand concentration was determined by measuring the GlcN content photometrically (Morgan-Elson) after hydrolysis in 4 m HCl for 16 h at 100 °C (92 nmol ligand/mg of BSA). Monoclonal antibodies S55-3 (IgG2b, κ) and S55-5 (IgG1, κ) were obtained by immunization with BBP-bis-Gly-DVS-BSA of four BALB/c mice as described (41.Fu Y. Baumann M. Kosma P. Brade L. Brade H.

Mice received their second immunization on day 33 and booster injections on 3 consecutive days starting on day 74 after the first injection. Hybridomas were obtained after fusion of spleen cells from one mouse and screened by EIA with immobilized acylated lipid A (100 ng/cup) as the solid-phase antigen as described (30.Kuhn H.M. Brade L.

The lipid A was prepared by hydrolysis of E. coli F515 LPS in acetate buffer, pH 4.5, for 90 min at 100 °C. mAbs S55-3 and S55-5 were isolated from ascites by affinity chromatography on BBP conjugated to AH-Sepharose (80 mg of ligand/2.5 ml of packed beads) followed by elution with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 3.2, and addition of NaHCO3 to pH 4.

For biotinylation of BBP, 2 mg (4 μmol, Mr 500.29) were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 9.0, and 44.6 mg of sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce, Mr 556.59, 80 μmol, 20-fold excess) were added and allowed to react for 2 h at room temperature. The sample was desalted on Sephadex G-10 (100 × 1.5 cm) using NH4HCO3 as eluent at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and dried under reduced pressure, which was repeated two times after addition of water (∼1 ml each). The dried sample was redissolved in 0.2 ml of water, and excess biotin was removed by semi-preparative high performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) under alkaline conditions on CarboPac PA100 (Dionex Corp., Germany) using a Dionex HPLC system. The sample was eluted by a gradient run over 45 min from 0 to 100% sodium acetate in 0.1 m NaOH. After neutralization with HCl, the product BBPbio was desalted by gel filtration as above, and after 3-fold evaporation, it was lyophilized (yield 2.6 mg, Mr 839.74, 3.1 μmol, 77%). Hydrolysis of 1 mg of BBPbio (1.2 μmol) in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m HCl for 30 min at 100 °C, neutralization with NaOH, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-10 as above gave B4Pbio in a yield of 91% (dried and lyophilized (0.75 mg, 1 μmol, Mr 759.76)). B1P was obtained by hydrolysis of BBP (122 mg, 0.1 m HCl, 100 °C, 60 min), separation by HPAEC, and desalting by gel filtration (yield 15.5 mg from 80 mg of BBP). B1Pbio (Mr 759.76) was then obtained by biotinylating B1P (Mr 420.31, 1 mg, 2.4 μmol) as described for BBP. After preparative HPAEC, gel filtration, and lyophilization, 1.0 mg of B1Pbio was obtained (yield 1.4 μmol, 58%). Alternatively, B1Pbio was obtained by treatment of BBPbio (1 mg, 1.2 mmol) with alkaline phosphatase at 56 °C for 45 min as described (42.Holst O. Thomas-Oates J.E. Brade H. Preparation and structural analysis of oligosaccharide monophosphates obtained from the lipopolysaccharide of recombinant strains of Salmonella minnesota and Escherichia coli expressing the genus-specific epitope of Chlamydia lipopolysaccharide.Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in a yield of 92% (0.83 mg, 1.1 μmol) after gel filtration. The biotinylated dephosphorylated backbone BBbio (Mr 679.78) was generated by acid hydrolysis of B1Pbio (0.8 mg, 1 μmol) and gel filtration as above in a yield of 90% (0.6 mg, 0.9 μmol). For NMR spectroscopy, 0.5 mg of the purified and lyophilized biotinylated oligosaccharides were exchanged with D2O three times by evaporation and finally dissolved in 400 μl of D2O (99.98%, Deutero GmbH, Germany). NMR spectra were recorded at 300 K on a Bruker Avance III 700 MHz ultrashielded plus spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm CPQCI 1H-31P/13C/15N/D Z-GRD probehead. One-dimensional 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectra, two-dimensional 1H,1H-DQF-COSY (cosydfphpr), 1H,13C HMQC and 1H31P HMQC (hmqcphpr and hsqcgpph) were recorded using the indicated Bruker standard pulse programs. The spectra were referenced to the methyl signals of acetone (1H, 2.225 ppm), (13C, 31.5 ppm), and external phosphoric acid (85% in water, 31P, 0 ppm) and analyzed using Bruker TopSpin version 3.0 software. Relative avidities of mAbs S55-3, S55-5, and A6 (33.Appelmelk B.J. Verweij-van Vught A.M. Maaskant J.J. Schouten W.F. De Jonge A.J. Thijs L.G. Maclaren D.M. Production and characterisation of mouse monoclonal antibodies reacting with the lipopolysaccharide core region of Gram-negative bacilli.J. Med. Microbiol. 1988; 26: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were determined using EIA with biotinylated lipid A analogues BBPbio, B4Pbio, B1Pbio, and BBbio. First, Neutravidin (Pierce, Thermo Fisher) was dissolved in carbonate buffer (5 μg/ml), 50 μl/well transferred to 96-well ELISA plates (MaxiSorp, Nunc), and kept for 24 h at 4 °C. Then ligand in 50 μl of carbonate buffer, pH 9.2, was added filling rows with either 2 or 20 pmol per well, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were then blocked with casein (2.5% w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST-C) for 1 h at 37 °C. The mAbs S55-3 and S55-5 and A6 were titrated in duplicates with 1 + 1 dilution steps over 12 wells and a starting concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Bound primary mAb was determined after addition of secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) antibody (Dianova) diluted 1:500 in 5% BSA in PBST-C, incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, and addition of 2,2′-azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazoline)sulfonic acid with hydrogen peroxide, as substrate. Color development was read after 30 min at 37 °C at 405 nm (reference wavelength 490 nm) using a plate reader. Binding curves were generated by non-linear regression fitting of the duplicate data points to the logistic function y = A2 + (A1 − A2)/(1 + (x/x0)p) using Origin software version 7.0 SR4 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). For data not reaching saturation, A2 was kept constant and assumed to adopt a value of A405 = 4.2. Amino acid sequences of Vh and Vl of both clones were determined from cDNA after T/A cloning as described (43.Müller-Loennies S. Gronow S. Brade L. MacKenzie R. Kosma P. Brade H.

For each proband we obtained a clinical history and detailed behavioral descriptions. Genetic anomalies were observed in all probands, and likely clinical significance could be established in four cases. This included two cases having novel, de novo copy number variants and two cases having variants likely to have functional significance. These cases included segmental trisomy 14, segmental monosomy 21, and variants predicted to disrupt the function of ZEB2 (encoding a transcription factor) and HTR2C (encoding a serotonin receptor). Our results identify variants in regions previously implicated in intellectual disability and suggest candidate genes that could contribute to the etiology of SIB."
https://openalex.org/W2289412448,"Motor control is a challenging task for the central nervous system, since it involves redundant degrees of freedom, nonlinear dynamics of actuators and limbs, as well as noise. When an action is carried out, which factors does your nervous system consider to determine the appropriate set of muscle forces between redundant degrees-of-freedom? Important factors determining motor output likely encompass effort and the resulting motor noise. However, the tasks used in many previous motor control studies could not identify these two factors uniquely, as signal-dependent noise monotonically increases as a function of the effort. To address this, a recent paper introduced a force control paradigm involving one finger in each hand that can disambiguate these two factors. It showed that the central nervous system considers both force noise and amplitude, with a larger weight on the absolute force and lower weights on both noise and normalized force. While these results are valid for the relatively low force range considered in that paper, the magnitude of the force shared between the fingers for large forces is not known. This paper investigates this question experimentally, and develops an appropriate Markov chain Monte Carlo method in order to estimate the weightings given to these factors. Our results demonstrate that the force sharing strongly depends on the force level required, so that for higher force levels the normalized force is considered as much as the absolute force, whereas the role of noise minimization becomes negligible."
https://openalex.org/W2291197747,"The article focus is the improvement of machine learning models capable of predicting protein expression levels based on their codon encoding. Support vector regression (SVR) and partial least squares (PLS) were used to create the models. SVR yields predictions that surpass those of PLS. It is shown that it is possible to improve the models predictive ability by using two more input features, codon identification number and codon count, besides the already used codon bias and minimum free energy. In addition, applying ensemble averaging to the SVR or PLS models also improves the results even further. The present work motivates the test of different ensembles and features with the aim of improving the prediction models whose correlation coefficients are still far from perfect. These results are relevant for the optimization of codon usage and enhancement of protein expression levels in synthetic biology problems."
https://openalex.org/W2292319112,"We used delay-interval interference to investigate the nature of the differential outcomes effect (DOE) in pigeons. Birds were trained on a delayed matching-to-sample (DMS) task under either common outcome or differential outcome conditions, and then presented with visual interference during the delay period. Consistent with previous literature, the common outcomes birds were slower to learn the DMS task than the differential outcomes birds. The common outcome birds were also more impaired by the visual interference than the differential outcomes birds. Our findings are consistent with the view that the birds trained with common outcomes were likely remembering the sample stimulus during the delay period, and hence were disrupted by the visual interference, whereas the birds trained with differential outcomes were likely relying on the different emotional reactions elicited by the different outcomes to guide their choice behaviour, and hence were less affected by the visual interference. Our findings suggest that the DOE is not truly evidence of anticipatory mediation of short-term retention in pigeons, but rather emotionally driven decision making, which is not truly anticipatory in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2292887881,"The misalignment between recorded in-focus and out-of-focus images using the Phase Diversity (PD) algorithm leads to a dramatic decline in wavefront detection accuracy and image recovery quality for segmented active optics systems. This paper demonstrates the theoretical relationship between the image misalignment and tip-tilt terms in Zernike polynomials of the wavefront phase for the first time, and an efficient two-step alignment correction algorithm is proposed to eliminate these misalignment effects. This algorithm processes a spatial 2-D cross-correlation of the misaligned images, revising the offset to 1 or 2 pixels and narrowing the search range for alignment. Then, it eliminates the need for subpixel fine alignment to achieve adaptive correction by adding additional tip-tilt terms to the Optical Transfer Function (OTF) of the out-of-focus channel. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed correction algorithm to improve the measurement accuracy during the co-phasing of segmented mirrors. With this alignment correction, the reconstructed wavefront is more accurate, and the recovered image is of higher quality."
