https://openalex.org/W2075969679,"Background The OAV questionnaire has been developed to integrate research on altered states of consciousness (ASC). It measures three primary and one secondary dimensions of ASC that are hypothesized to be invariant across ASC induction methods. The OAV rating scale has been in use for more than 20 years and applied internationally in a broad range of research fields, yet its factorial structure has never been tested by structural equation modeling techniques and its psychometric properties have never been examined in large samples of experimentally induced ASC. Methodology/Principal Findings The present study conducted a psychometric evaluation of the OAV in a sample of psilocybin (n = 327), ketamine (n = 162), and MDMA (n = 102) induced ASC that was obtained by pooling data from 43 experimental studies. The factorial structure was examined by confirmatory factor analysis, exploratory structural equation modeling, hierarchical item clustering (ICLUST), and multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) modeling. The originally proposed model did not fit the data well even if zero-constraints on non-target factor loadings and residual correlations were relaxed. Furthermore, ICLUST suggested that the “oceanic boundlessness” and “visionary restructuralization” factors could be combined on a high level of the construct hierarchy. However, because these factors were multidimensional, we extracted and examined 11 new lower order factors. MIMIC modeling indicated that these factors were highly measurement invariant across drugs, settings, questionnaire versions, and sexes. The new factors were also demonstrated to have improved homogeneities, satisfactory reliabilities, discriminant and convergent validities, and to differentiate well among the three drug groups. Conclusions/Significance The original scales of the OAV were shown to be multidimensional constructs. Eleven new lower order scales were constructed and demonstrated to have desirable psychometric properties. The new lower order scales are most likely better suited to assess drug induced ASC."
https://openalex.org/W2113784200,"Upon entry into the central nervous system (CNS), serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) modulates neuronal growth, survival, and excitability. Yet mechanisms that trigger IGF-I entry across the blood-brain barrier remain unclear. We show that neuronal activity elicited by electrical, sensory, or behavioral stimulation increases IGF-I input in activated regions. Entrance of serum IGF-I is triggered by diffusible messengers (i.e., ATP, arachidonic acid derivatives) released during neurovascular coupling. These messengers stimulate matrix metalloproteinase-9, leading to cleavage of the IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3). Cleavage of IGFBP-3 allows the passage of serum IGF-I into the CNS through an interaction with the endothelial transporter lipoprotein related receptor 1. Activity-dependent entrance of serum IGF-I into the CNS may help to explain disparate observations such as proneurogenic effects of epilepsy, rehabilitatory effects of neural stimulation, and modulatory effects of blood flow on brain activity."
https://openalex.org/W2082443574,"CDK5 is an important kinase in nervous system function, controlling neural development and postsynaptic signal integration. Here we show that CDK5 plays a major role in controlling neurotransmitter release. Inhibition of CDK5 activity, by either acute or genetic means, leads to profound potentiation of presynaptic function, including unmasking of previously ""silent"" synapses. Removal of CDK5 activity additionally unlocks access to the resting synaptic vesicle pool, which normally remains recalcitrant to exocytosis and recycling even following prolonged action potential stimuli. Presynaptic CDK5 levels are additionally severely depleted by chronic neuronal silencing, a treatment that is functionally similar to CDK5 knockdown with regard to presynaptic potentiation. Thus CDK5 appears to be an integral element in presynaptic homeostatic scaling, and the resting vesicle pool appears to provide a potent functional presynaptic homeostatic control parameter. These studies thus pinpoint CDK5 as a major control point for modulation of neurotransmitter release in mammalian neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1964927015,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized pathologically by the abundance of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. We synthesized over 1200 novel gamma-secretase modulator (GSM) compounds that reduced Abeta(42) levels without inhibiting epsilon-site cleavage of APP and Notch, the generation of the APP and Notch intracellular domains, respectively. These compounds also reduced Abeta(40) levels while concomitantly elevating levels of Abeta(38) and Abeta(37). Immobilization of a potent GSM onto an agarose matrix quantitatively recovered Pen-2 and to a lesser degree PS-1 NTFs from cellular extracts. Moreover, oral administration (once daily) of another potent GSM to Tg 2576 transgenic AD mice displayed dose-responsive lowering of plasma and brain Abeta(42); chronic daily administration led to significant reductions in both diffuse and neuritic plaques. These effects were observed in the absence of Notch-related changes (e.g., intestinal proliferation of goblet cells), which are commonly associated with repeated exposure to functional gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs)."
https://openalex.org/W2046426203,"Inhibitory interneurons in the cerebral cortex include a vast array of subtypes, varying in their molecular signatures, electrophysiological properties, and connectivity patterns. This diversity suggests that individual inhibitory classes have unique roles in cortical circuits; however, their characterization to date has been limited to broad classifications including many subtypes. We used the Cre/LoxP system, specifically labeling parvalbumin(PV)-expressing interneurons in visual cortex of PV-Cre mice with red fluorescent protein (RFP), followed by targeted loose-patch recordings and two-photon imaging of calcium responses in vivo to characterize the visual receptive field properties of these cells. Despite their relative molecular and morphological homogeneity, we find that PV+ neurons have a diversity of feature-specific visual responses that include sharp orientation and direction-selectivity, small receptive fields, and band-pass spatial frequency tuning. These results suggest that subsets of parvalbumin interneurons are components of specific cortical networks and that perisomatic inhibition contributes to the generation of precise response properties."
https://openalex.org/W2039722938,"In the developing spinal cord, regional and combinatorial activities of Hox transcription factors are critical in controlling motor neuron fates along the rostrocaudal axis, exemplified by the precise pattern of limb innervation by more than fifty Hox-dependent motor pools. The mechanisms by which motor neuron diversity is constrained to limb levels are, however, not well understood. We show that a single Hox gene, Hoxc9, has an essential role in organizing the motor system through global repressive activities. Hoxc9 is required for the generation of thoracic motor columns, and in its absence, neurons acquire the fates of limb-innervating populations. Unexpectedly, multiple Hox genes are derepressed in Hoxc9 mutants, leading to motor pool disorganization and alterations in the connections by thoracic and forelimb-level subtypes. Genome-wide analysis of Hoxc9 binding suggests that this mode of repression is mediated by direct interactions with Hox regulatory elements, independent of chromatin marks typically associated with repressed Hox genes."

Television, DVDs, video games, the Internet, and smart phones all play a formative role in children's development. The term “technology” subsumes a large variety of somewhat independent items, and it is no surprise that current research indicates causes for both optimism and concern depending upon the content of the technology, the context in which the technology immerses the user, and the user's developmental stage. Furthermore, because the field is still in its infancy, results can be surprising: video games designed to be reasonably mindless result in widespread enhancements of various abilities, acting, we will argue, as exemplary learning tools. Counterintuitive outcomes like these, besides being practically relevant, challenge and eventually lead to refinement of theories concerning fundamental principles of brain plasticity and learning.

https://openalex.org/W2013258020,"Many adult stem cells reside in a special microenvironment known as the niche, where they receive essential signals that specify stem cell identity. Cell-cell adhesion mediated by cadherin and integrin plays a crucial role in maintaining stem cells within the niche. In Drosophila melanogaster, male germline stem cells (GSCs) are attached to niche component cells (i.e., the hub) via adherens junctions. The GSC centrosomes and spindle are oriented toward the hub-GSC junction, where E-cadherin-based adherens junctions are highly concentrated. For this reason, adherens junctions are thought to provide a polarity cue for GSCs to enable proper orientation of centrosomes and spindles, a critical step toward asymmetric stem cell division. However, understanding the role of E-cadherin in GSC polarity has been challenging, since GSCs carrying E-cadherin mutations are not maintained in the niche. Here, we tested whether E-cadherin is required for GSC polarity by expressing a dominant-negative form of E-cadherin. We found that E-cadherin is indeed required for polarizing GSCs toward the hub cells, an effect that may be mediated by Apc2. We also demonstrated that E-cadherin is required for the GSC centrosome orientation checkpoint, which prevents mitosis when centrosomes are not correctly oriented. We propose that E-cadherin orchestrates multiple aspects of stem cell behavior, including polarization of stem cells toward the stem cell-niche interface and adhesion of stem cells to the niche supporting cells."
https://openalex.org/W2141692076,"Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to be involved in relapse after cocaine withdrawal, but the underlying cellular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we report that after terminating repeated cocaine exposure in rats, a gradual increase in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the mPFC facilitates activity-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses on layer V pyramidal neurons. This enhanced synaptic plasticity could be attributed to BDNF-induced suppression of GABAergic inhibition in the mPFC by reducing the surface expression of GABAA receptors. The BDNF effect was mediated by BDNF-TrkB-phosphatase 2A signaling pathway. Downregulating TrkB expression bilaterally in the mPFC reduced the locomotor hypersensitivity to cocaine 8 days after cocaine withdrawal. Thus, elevated BDNF expression after cocaine withdrawal sensitizes the excitatory synapses in the mPFC to undergo activity-induced persistent potentiation that may contribute to cue-induced drug craving and drug-seeking behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2084655279,"Background In response to Mtb infection, the host remodels the infection foci into a dense mass of cells known as the granuloma. The key objective of the granuloma is to contain the spread of Mtb into uninfected regions of the lung. However, it appears that Mtb has evolved mechanisms to resist killing in the granuloma. Profiling granuloma transcriptome will identify key immune signaling pathways active during TB infection. Such studies are not possible in human granulomas, due to various confounding factors. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) infected with Mtb accurately reflect human TB in clinical and pathological contexts. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied transcriptomics of granuloma lesions in the lungs of NHPs exhibiting active TB, during early and late stages of infection. Early TB lesions were characterized by a highly pro-inflammatory environment, expressing high levels of immune signaling pathways involving IFNγ, TNFα, JAK, STAT and C-C/C-X-C chemokines. Late TB lesions, while morphologically similar to the early ones, exhibited an overwhelming silencing of the inflammatory response. Reprogramming of the granuloma transcriptome was highly significant. The expression of ∼ two-thirds of all genes induced in early lesions was later repressed. Conclusions/Significance The transcriptional characteristics of TB granulomas undergo drastic changes during the course of infection. The overwhelming reprogramming of the initial pro-inflammatory surge in late lesions may be a host strategy to limit immunopathology. We propose that these host profiles can predict changes in bacterial replication and physiology, perhaps serving as markers for latency and reactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2071629929,"Background The recent swine-origin H1N1 pandemic illustrates the need to develop improved procedures for rapid production of influenza vaccines. One alternative to the current egg-based manufacture of influenza vaccine is to produce a hemagglutinin (HA) subunit vaccine using a recombinant expression system with the potential for high protein yields, ease of cloning new antigenic variants, and an established safety record in humans. Methodology/Principal Findings We generated a soluble HA (sHA), derived from the H3N2 virus A/Aichi/2/68, modified at the C-terminus with a GCN4pII trimerization repeat to stabilize the native trimeric structure of HA. When expressed in the baculovirus system, the modified sHA formed native trimers. In contrast, the unmodified sHA was found to present epitopes recognized by a low-pH conformation specific monoclonal antibody. We found that mice primed and boosted with 3 µg of trimeric sHA in the absence of adjuvants had significantly higher IgG and HAI titers than mice that received the unmodified sHA. This correlated with an increased survival and reduced body weight loss following lethal challenge with mouse-adapted A/Aichi/2/68 virus. In addition, mice receiving a single vaccination of the trimeric sHA in the absence of adjuvants had improved survival and body weight loss compared to mice vaccinated with the unmodified sHA. Conclusions/Significance Our data indicate that the recombinant trimeric sHA presents native trimeric epitopes while the unmodified sHA presents epitopes not exposed in the native HA molecule. The epitopes presented in the unmodified sHA constitute a “silent face” which may skew the antibody response to epitopes not accessible in live virus at neutral pH. The results demonstrate that the trimeric sHA is a more effective influenza vaccine candidate and emphasize the importance of structure-based antigen design in improving recombinant HA vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2115744126,"Background Multiple lines of evidence suggest innate immune response pathways to be involved in the development of obesity-associated diabetes although the molecular mechanism underling the disease is unknown. Recent observations suggest that saturated fatty acids can act as a ligand for toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, which is thought to mediate obesity-associated insulin resistance. Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is an adapter protein for TLR/IL-1 receptor signaling, which is involved in the activation of inflammatory pathways. To evaluate molecular mechanisms linking obesity-associated diabetes down-stream of TLR4, we investigated physiological role of MyD88 in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we found MyD88-deficient mice fed a HFD had increased circulating levels of insulin, leptin and cholesterol, as well as liver dysfunction (increased induction of ALT levels, increased activation of JNK and cleavage of PARP), which were linked to the onset of severe diabetes. On the other hand, TNF-α would not be involved in HFD-induced diabetes in MyD88-deficient mice, because TNF-α level was attenuated in MyD88-deficient mice fed with HFD. Conclusions/Significance The present finding of an unexpected role for MyD88 in preventing diabetes may provide a potential novel target/strategy for treating metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2087767260,"There is a need for greater synergy between advances in neuroscience and the formulation of innovative policies to improve life outcomes for children experiencing significant adversity. Translational developmental neuroscience can inform new theories of change to catalyze more effective interventions that lead to a more productive and healthier society. There is a need for greater synergy between advances in neuroscience and the formulation of innovative policies to improve life outcomes for children experiencing significant adversity. Translational developmental neuroscience can inform new theories of change to catalyze more effective interventions that lead to a more productive and healthier society. Ten years ago, the Institute of Medicine and National Research Council published a report entitled From Neurons to Neighborhoods: The Science of Early Childhood Development. In the introductory chapter, the authoring committee stated:This report addresses two complementary agendas. The first is focused on the future and asks: How can society use knowledge about early childhood development to maximize the development of the nation's human capital and ensure the ongoing vitality of its democratic institutions? The second is focused on the present and asks: How can the nation use knowledge to nurture, protect, and ensure the health and well-being of all young children as an important objective in its own right, regardless of whether measurable returns can be documented in the future? The first agenda speaks to society's economic, political, and social interests. The second speaks to its ethical and moral values. The committee is clear in our responsibility to speak to both. (Shonkoff and Phillips, 2000Shonkoff J.P. Phillips D.A. From Neurons to Neighborhoods: The Science of Early Childhood Development. National Academy Press, Washington, DC2000Google Scholar) After a decade of advances in neuroscience, molecular biology, and genomics, these two agendas remain compelling and urgent. For some, the priority is to leverage science to accelerate learning and skill acquisition, particularly in the earliest years. For others, the most important challenge is to employ new knowledge to mitigate the impacts of adverse early experiences to prevent developmental impairment. In both cases, the translation of neuroscience into principles that can inform sound policymaking offers considerable promise. The last 10 years of the 20th century were designated by the National Institutes of Health as the “Decade of the Brain.” Beyond the remarkable scientific progress achieved during that period, considerable efforts were made by government agencies, private foundations, and professional societies to increase public knowledge about brain development and disease. The opening decade of the 21st century leveraged this enhanced awareness through a growing infrastructure of early childhood policies and programs that reflects broad support for science-based investment in the development of young children. A primary driving force for this commitment is compelling evidence that demonstrates the robust interactions among genes, early experiences, and environmental influences that shape the architecture and function of the developing brain (Fox et al., 2010Fox S.E. Levitt P. Nelson 3rd, C.A. Child Dev. 2010; 81: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). This fundamental concept is underscored by advances in molecular biology and epigenetics that have deepened our understanding of the underlying causal mechanisms that link early experiences to later behaviors, as well as to both physical and mental health (Meaney, 2010Meaney M.J. Child Dev. 2010; 81: 41-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, Shonkoff et al., 2009Shonkoff J.P. Boyce W.T. McEwen B.S. JAMA. 2009; 301: 2252-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar, Taylor, 2010Taylor P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 8507-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). As this knowledge base has matured, neuroscience has had less to say about the specific mechanisms that underlie positive influences on brain and child development in comparison to those gene by environment interactions that lead to undesirable outcomes (Hackman and Farah, 2009Hackman D.A. Farah M.J. Trends Cogn. Sci. 2009; 13: 65-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). As a result, the scientific contribution to policymaking has been strongest in making the case for intervening early in the lives of children who face significant adversity (Shonkoff, 2010Shonkoff J.P. Child Dev. 2010; 81: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). That said, and without minimizing the influence of contemporary neuroscience on early childhood policy, the value of that relationship is approaching a plateau that demands thoughtful examination. In practical terms, the long-term utility of neuroscience for informing public investment in young children requires a fundamental reorientation from the current focus on answering the relatively easier “why” question to actively confronting the more challenging “what” and “how” inquiries. Although responses to the first question will undoubtedly become more sophisticated over time, the power of the current answer needs no further augmentation. A growing percentage of the population (and increasing numbers of policymakers across the political spectrum) now understand that young children do not simply follow fixed genetic trajectories, environments do matter, and significant early adversity can have lifelong consequences for learning, behavior, and health. The challenge for those who wish to build a continuing role for neuroscience in early childhood policy and practice must now shift to confront the more complex questions about “what” should be done to increase the impacts of current interventions and “how” can that be done most effectively, particularly for young children who experience toxic stress. As the primary organ of stress and adaptation, the brain interprets and regulates behavioral, neuroendocrine, autonomic, and immunologic responses to adverse events, serves as a target of both psychosocial and physical threats, and changes both structurally and functionally as a result of significant adversity The fact that stress responsiveness evokes alterations in the architectural, physiological, and molecular status of multiple systems that feed back to central circuits that mediate cognition, executive function, and emotional regulation underscores the potential consequences of ignoring this serious threat to child well-being (McEwen, 2007McEwen B.S. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 873-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). The extent to which some amount of stress is an unavoidable part of life that is viewed as character-building by many policymakers, however, presents a problem for those who support investments in preventive interventions for children experiencing significant disadvantage. In an effort to address this challenge directly, and recognizing the difficulty of communicating complex scientific information effectively to nonexperts, the National Scientific Council on the Developing Child proposed a simplified three-level taxonomy—positive, tolerable, and toxic—to describe the physiological expression of the stress-response system (not the nature of the stressor or the distinction between objectively measured versus perceived stress) that can affect brain development. Although further research is needed to elucidate the underlying causal mechanisms, the conceptual basis of this model is grounded in well-established biological principles, and its explanatory value for nonscientists appears to be strong (Shonkoff, 2010Shonkoff J.P. Child Dev. 2010; 81: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Positive stress is characterized by moderate, short-lived increases in heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormone levels. Precipitants include such challenges as dealing with frustration and separation anxiety. The essential nature of positive stress is that it is an important aspect of healthy development that is experienced in the context of stable and supportive adult relationships which facilitate adaptive responses that restore the stress-response system to baseline status. Tolerable stress refers to a physiological state that could potentially disrupt brain architecture (e.g., through cortisol-induced damage of neural circuits or neuronal death) but is buffered by supportive relationships that facilitate adaptive coping. Precipitants include the death or serious illness of a loved one or a natural disaster. The defining characteristic of tolerable stress is that it occurs within a time-limited period during which protective relationships help to bring the body's stress-response systems back into homeostatic balance, thereby giving the brain time to recover from potentially damaging effects. Toxic stress refers to intense, frequent, and/or prolonged activation of the body's stress-response and autonomic systems in the absence of the buffering protection of adult support. Major risk factors include chronic neglect, recurrent abuse, severe maternal depression, parental substance abuse, and family violence, with or without the additional burdens of poverty. The defining characteristic of toxic stress is that it disrupts brain architecture and neurochemistry, adversely affects other organs, and leads to stress-management systems that establish relatively lower thresholds for responsiveness that persist throughout life. Stated simply, toxic stress during the early childhood period increases the risk of physical and mental illness, as well as cognitive impairment, well into the adult years. This admittedly simple taxonomy of stress responses helps differentiate normative life challenges that do not require programmatic intervention from significant adversities that threaten lifelong outcomes and therefore warrant a pre-emptive response. The potential long-term impacts of these physiological disruptions, however, are unknown to most policymakers. Other fundamental neuroscience concepts that are supported by extensive research in both model systems and humans that have equally important implications for policy development include (1) the hierarchical nature of simple-to-complex circuit formation (Hammock and Levitt, 2006Hammock E.A. Levitt P. Hum. Dev. 2006; 49: 294-309Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar); (2) the neurobiology that underlies the concept of complex skills building on a foundation of simpler skills; (3) the highly interactive nature of cognitive, emotional, and social development; and (4) the decreasing plasticity of brain circuitry over time. The effective communication of these concepts provides a compelling rationale for public investment in early childhood intervention to protect the developing brain from the anatomical, molecular, and physiological disruptions that can be associated with excessive or prolonged activation of the stress response. The task of formulating a credible scientific framework to inform more effective approaches to reducing the consequences of early adversity begins with the need to move beyond the already answered “why” question and to confront a more complex set of challenges. For example, how can we leverage advances in neuroscience to inform the design of testable, new interventions and the measurement of their impacts? More specifically, how can we capitalize on a deeper understanding of how experiences are built into the body (for better or worse) and thereby influence learning, social behavior and executive function, and both physical and mental health? The following areas of investigation offer considerable promise. The critical importance of digging deeper into the elucidation of causal mechanisms from the perspectives of molecular biology, genetics, developmental-behavioral research, and studies of intervention effects is clear. Are there sensitive or critical periods during which positive or adverse experiences have a particularly significant effect on a young child that have short- and long-term impacts on cognitive, language, or social-emotional competencies? Are there sensitive or critical periods for specific developmental domains during which it is most advantageous to intervene, and how are these effects sustained over time? How and why do outcomes differ depending on whether a child experiences acute or chronic adversity? How can early childhood interventions move beyond a single risk factor-single phenotype approach (e.g., only learning) to address multisystemic issues? Productive investigation in these areas could catalyze enhanced theories of change to guide both the formulation of innovative intervention strategies and the identification of short- and medium-term measures of their impacts. There also is an urgent need for continuing research on the biology of both adversity and resilience. What accounts for the observation that some children do better than others, despite similar risk profiles? Are there developing neural systems that are relatively more resilient than others, and why? How can we apply growing evidence about the role of gene-environment interactions and the intriguing issue of differential sensitivity to context as an explanation for disparities in developmental outcomes (Boyce and Ellis, 2005Boyce W.T. Ellis B.J. Dev. Psychopathol. 2005; 17: 271-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar)? The extent to which new thinking about differences in resilience and vulnerability can inform the design, implementation, and targeting of more effective policies and services underscores the potential benefits of bringing these fields of study closer together. Early childhood policy and practice also have much to gain from further advances in the science of learning. How can we reduce emotional and behavioral barriers that undermine the acquisition of early literacy skills? Can we formulate new therapeutic approaches to address brain-based impairments in self-regulation caused by significant adversity rather than focusing exclusively on enhanced instruction? To what extent can greater understanding of executive functioning from both a behavioral and biological perspective inform innovations in both assessment and intervention in the preschool years? The contribution of neuroscience to innovation in social policy could be formidable (Figure 1). Basic and clinical research over the past two decades have created a highly promising yet underdeveloped interface between these two worlds that would benefit considerably from a more permeable boundary. The extent to which contemporary understanding of gene-environment interaction has superseded the now outdated nature-versus-nurture debate has produced a newly emergent field of translational developmental neuroscience which provides a solid foundation of principles that offers an important opportunity for integrative problem-solving (National Advisory Mental Health Council Report, 2008National Advisory Mental Health Council Report. (2008). Transformative Neurodevelopmental Research in Mental Illness (http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/advisory-boards-and-groups/namhc/neurodevelopment_workgroup_report.pdf) .Google Scholar). The scientific case for investment in vulnerable, young children is clear—brains require more physiological energy to compensate later in life when neural circuits are not formed appropriately in the beginning, and society is likely to pay higher costs in remedial education, clinical treatment, public assistance, and incarceration when opportunities for preventive intervention are ignored. Neuroscience can play an important role in catalyzing the creative, new thinking needed to shape a new era of policies that will produce greater social and economic returns on those future investments."
https://openalex.org/W1987146157,"Advancing age is associated with substantial increases in the incidence rates of common diseases affecting the prostate gland including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate carcinoma. The prostate is comprised of a functional secretory epithelium, a basal epithelium, and a supporting stroma comprised of structural elements, and a spectrum of cell types that includes smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and inflammatory cells. As reciprocal interactions between epithelium and stromal constituents are essential for normal organogenesis and serve to maintain normal functions, discordance within the stroma could permit or promote disease processes. In this study we sought to identify aging-associated alterations in the mouse prostate microenvironment that could influence pathology.We quantitated transcript levels in microdissected glandular-adjacent stroma from young (age 4 months) and old (age 20-24 months) C57BL/6 mice, and identified a significant change in the expression of 1259 genes (p<0.05). These included increases in transcripts encoding proteins associated with inflammation (e.g., Ccl8, Ccl12), genotoxic/oxidative stress (e.g., Apod, Serpinb5) and other paracrine-acting effects (e.g., Cyr61). The expression of several collagen genes (e.g., Col1a1 and Col3a1) exhibited age-associated declines. By histology, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy we determined that the collagen matrix is abundant and disorganized, smooth muscle cell orientation is disordered, and inflammatory infiltrates are significantly increased, and are comprised of macrophages, T cells and, to a lesser extent, B cells.These findings demonstrate that during normal aging the prostate stroma exhibits phenotypic and molecular characteristics plausibly contributing to the striking age associated pathologies affecting the prostate."
https://openalex.org/W2066881685,"Background There are no drugs presently available to treat traumatic brain injury (TBI). A variety of single drugs have failed clinical trials suggesting a role for drug combinations. Drug combinations acting synergistically often provide the greatest combination of potency and safety. The drugs examined (minocycline (MINO), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), simvastatin, cyclosporine A, and progesterone) had FDA-approval for uses other than TBI and limited brain injury in experimental TBI models. Methodology/Principal Findings Drugs were dosed one hour after injury using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI model in adult rats. One week later, drugs were tested for efficacy and drug combinations tested for synergy on a hierarchy of behavioral tests that included active place avoidance testing. As monotherapy, only MINO improved acquisition of the massed version of active place avoidance that required memory lasting less than two hours. MINO-treated animals, however, were impaired during the spaced version of the same avoidance task that required 24-hour memory retention. Co-administration of NAC with MINO synergistically improved spaced learning. Examination of brain histology 2 weeks after injury suggested that MINO plus NAC preserved white, but not grey matter, since lesion volume was unaffected, yet myelin loss was attenuated. When dosed 3 hours before injury, MINO plus NAC as single drugs had no effect on interleukin-1 formation; together they synergistically lowered interleukin-1 levels. This effect on interleukin-1 was not observed when the drugs were dosed one hour after injury. Conclusions/Significance These observations suggest a potentially valuable role for MINO plus NAC to treat TBI."
https://openalex.org/W1981641555,"Power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS) is increasingly used to assess synovitis in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Prior studies have shown correlations between PDUS scores and vessel counts, but relationships with T cell immunopathology have not been described.PBMC were isolated from healthy controls (HC) or RA patients and stimulated ex vivo with PMA and ionomycin for 3 hours in the presence of Golgistop. Paired synovial fluid (SF) or synovial tissue (ST) were analysed where available. Intracellular expression of IL-17, IFNgamma, and TNFalpha by CD4+ T cells was determined by flow cytometry. Synovial blood flow was evaluated by PDUS signal at the knees, wrists and metacarpophalangeal joints of RA patients. Serum, SF and fibroblast culture supernatant levels of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) were measured by ELISA. The frequency of IL17+IFNgamma-CD4+ T cells (Th17 cells) was significantly elevated in peripheral blood (PB) from RA patients vs. HC (median (IQR) 0.5 (0.28-1.59)% vs. 0.32 (0.21-0.54)%, p = 0.005). Th17 cells were further enriched (mean 6.6-fold increase) in RA SF relative to RA PB. Patients with active disease had a higher percentage of IL-17+ T cells in ST than patients in remission, suggesting a possible role for Th17 cells in active synovitis in RA. Indeed, the percentage of Th17 cells, but not Th1, in SF positively correlated with CRP (r = 0.51, p = 0.04) and local PDUS-defined synovitis (r = 0.61, p = 0.002). Furthermore, patients with high levels of IL-17+CD4+ T cells in SF had increased levels of the angiogenic factor VEGF-A in SF. Finally, IL-17, but not IFNgamma, increased VEGF-A production by RA synovial fibroblasts in vitro.Our data demonstrate a link between the presence of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells in SF and local PDUS scores, and offer a novel immunological explanation for the observation that rapid joint damage progression occurs in patients with persistent positive PDUS signal."
https://openalex.org/W2016616427,"Background Cell surface sialylation is emerging as an important feature of cancer cell metastasis. Sialyltransferase expression has been reported to be altered in tumours and may account for the formation of sialylated tumour antigens. We have focused on the influence of alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase ST3Gal III in key steps of the pancreatic tumorigenic process. Methodology/Principal Findings ST3Gal III overexpressing pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines Capan-1 and MDAPanc-28 were generated. They showed an increase of the tumour associated antigen sialyl-Lewisx. The transfectants' E-selectin binding capacity was proportional to cell surface sialyl-Lewisx levels. Cellular migration positively correlated with ST3Gal III and sialyl-Lewisx levels. Moreover, intrasplenic injection of the ST3Gal III transfected cells into athymic nude mice showed a decrease in survival and higher metastasis formation when compared to the mock cells. Conclusion In summary, the overexpression of ST3Gal III in these pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines underlines the role of this enzyme and its product in key steps of tumour progression such as adhesion, migration and metastasis formation."
https://openalex.org/W1967530175,"Senescence is a highly regulated process that limits cellular replication by enforcing a G1 arrest in response to various stimuli. Replicative senescence occurs in response to telomeric DNA erosion, and telomerase expression can offset replicative senescence leading to immortalization of many human cells. Limited data exists regarding changes of microRNA (miRNA) expression during senescence in human cells and no reports correlate telomerase expression with regulation of senescence-related miRNAs. We used miRNA microarrays to provide a detailed account of miRNA profiles for early passage and senescent human foreskin (BJ) fibroblasts as well as early and late passage immortalized fibroblasts (BJ-hTERT) that stably express the human telomerase reverse transcriptase subunit hTERT. Selected miRNAs that were differentially expressed in senescence were assayed for expression in quiescent cells to identify miRNAs that are specifically associated with senescence-associated growth arrest. From this group of senescence-associated miRNAs, we confirmed the ability of miR-143 to induce growth arrest after ectopic expression in young fibroblasts. Remarkably, miR-143 failed to induce growth arrest in BJ-hTERT cells. Importantly, the comparison of late passage immortalized fibroblasts to senescent wild type fibroblasts reveals that miR-146a, a miRNA with a validated role in regulating the senescence associated secretory pathway, is also regulated during extended cell culture independently of senescence. The discovery that miRNA expression is impacted by expression of ectopic hTERT as well as extended passaging in immortalized fibroblasts contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the connections between telomerase expression, senescence and processes of cellular aging."
https://openalex.org/W2161488474,"In both vertebrate and invertebrate visual systems, neurons form multiple-contact synapses at which a single presynaptic site releases neurotransmitter upon a discrete combination of different postsynaptic cells. Recognition mechanisms underlying the assembly of such synapses are not known. In Drosophila, photoreceptor terminals form tetrad synapses that incorporate an invariable pair of postsynaptic elements, one each from lamina interneuron L1 and L2, and two elements from other cells. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila Dscam1 and Dscam2, genes encoding homophilic repulsive proteins, act redundantly to ensure the invariable combination of L1 and L2 postsynaptic elements at all tetrads. We demonstrate that this strict pairing is lost in Dscam1;Dscam2 double mutants. Thus, removing these two repulsive proteins allows elements from the same cell to incorporate into the same postsynaptic tetrad, altering the specificity of photoreceptor transmission. We propose that Dscams regulate synaptic specificity by excluding inappropriate partners at multiple-contact synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2145014688,"Plasma cells constitute the majority of tumor cells in multiple myeloma (MM) but lack the potential for sustained clonogenic growth. In contrast, clonotypic B cells can engraft and recapitulate disease in immunodeficient mice suggesting they serve as the MM cancer stem cell (CSC). These tumor initiating B cells also share functional features with normal stem cells such as drug resistance and self-renewal potential. Therefore, the cellular processes that regulate normal stem cells may serve as therapeutic targets in MM. Telomerase activity is required for the maintenance of normal adult stem cells, and we examined the activity of the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat against MM CSC. Moreover, we carried out both long and short-term inhibition studies to examine telomere length-dependent and independent activities.Human MM CSC were isolated from cell lines and primary clinical specimens and treated with imetelstat, a specific inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase activity of telomerase. Two weeks of exposure to imetelstat resulted in a significant reduction in telomere length and the inhibition of clonogenic MM growth both in vitro and in vivo. In addition to these relatively long-term effects, 72 hours of imetelstat treatment inhibited clonogenic growth that was associated with MM CSC differentiation based on expression of the plasma cell antigen CD138 and the stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase. Short-term treatment of MM CSC also decreased the expression of genes typically expressed by stem cells (OCT3/4, SOX2, NANOG, and BMI1) as revealed by quantitative real-time PCR.Telomerase activity regulates the clonogenic growth of MM CSC. Moreover, reductions in MM growth following both long and short-term telomerase inhibition suggest that it impacts CSC through telomere length-dependent and independent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2080336978,"Synaptogenesis is a fundamental step in neuronal development. For spiny glutamatergic synapses in hippocampus and cortex, synaptogenesis involves adhesion of pre and postsynaptic membranes, delivery and anchorage of pre and postsynaptic structures including scaffolds such as PSD-95 and NMDA and AMPA receptors, which are glutamate-gated ion channels, as well as the morphological maturation of spines. Although electrical activity-dependent mechanisms are established regulators of these processes, the mechanisms that function during early development, prior to the onset of electrical activity, are unclear. The Eph receptors and ephrins provide cell contact-dependent pathways that regulate axonal and dendritic development. Members of the ephrin-A family are glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored to the cell surface and activate EphA receptors, which are receptor tyrosine kinases.Here we show that ephrin-A5 interaction with the EphA5 receptor following neuron-neuron contact during early development of hippocampus induces a complex program of synaptogenic events, including expression of functional synaptic NMDA receptor-PSD-95 complexes plus morphological spine maturation and the emergence of electrical activity. The program depends upon voltage-sensitive calcium channel Ca2+ fluxes that activate PKA, CaMKII and PI3 kinase, leading to CREB phosphorylation and a synaptogenic program of gene expression. AMPA receptor subunits, their scaffolds and electrical activity are not induced. Strikingly, in contrast to wild type, stimulation of hippocampal slices from P6 EphA5 receptor functional knockout mice yielded no NMDA receptor currents.These studies suggest that ephrin-A5 and EphA5 signals play a necessary, activity-independent role in the initiation of the early phases of synaptogenesis. The coordinated expression of the NMDAR and PSD-95 induced by eprhin-A5 interaction with EphA5 receptors may be the developmental switch that induces expression of AMPAR and their interacting proteins and the transition to activity-dependent synaptic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1965518698,"Recent outbreaks of vegetable-associated gastroenteritis suggest that enteric pathogens colonize, multiply and persist in plants for extended periods of time, eventually infecting people. Genetic and physiological pathways, by which enterics colonize plants, are still poorly understood.To better understand interactions between Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium and tomatoes, a gfp-tagged Salmonella promoter library was screened inside red ripe fruits. Fifty-one unique constructs that were potentially differentially regulated in tomato relative to in vitro growth were identified. The expression of a subset of these promoters was tested in planta using recombinase-based in vivo expression technology (RIVET) and fitness of the corresponding mutants was tested. Gene expression in Salmonella was affected by fruit maturity and tomato cultivar. A putative fadH promoter was upregulated most strongly in immature tomatoes. Expression of the fadH construct depended on the presence of linoleic acid, which is consistent with the reduced accumulation of this compound in mature tomato fruits. The cysB construct was activated in the fruit of cv. Hawaii 7997 (resistant to a race of Ralstonia solanacearum) more strongly than in the universally susceptible tomato cv. Bonny Best. Known Salmonella motility and animal virulence genes (hilA, flhDC, fliF and those encoded on the pSLT virulence plasmid) did not contribute significantly to fitness of the bacteria inside tomatoes, even though deletions of sirA and motA modestly increased fitness of Salmonella inside tomatoes.This study reveals the genetic basis of the interactions of Salmonella with plant hosts. Salmonella relies on a distinct set of metabolic and regulatory genes, which are differentially regulated in planta in response to host genotype and fruit maturity. This enteric pathogen colonizes tissues of tomatoes differently than plant pathogens, and relies little on its animal virulence genes for persistence within the fruit."
https://openalex.org/W1982143624,"Hundreds of thousands of seabirds are killed each year as bycatch in longline fisheries. Seabirds are predominantly caught during line setting but bycatch is generally recorded during line hauling, many hours after birds are caught. Bird loss during this interval may lead to inaccurate bycatch information. In this 15 year study, seabird bycatch was recorded during both line setting and line hauling from four fishing regions: Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, Coral Sea and central Pacific Ocean. Over 43,000 albatrosses, petrels and skuas representing over 25 species were counted during line setting of which almost 6,000 seabirds attempted to take the bait. Bait-taking interactions were placed into one of four categories. (i) The majority (57%) of bait-taking attempts were ""unsuccessful"" involving seabirds that did not take the bait nor get caught or hooked. (ii) One-third of attempts were ""successful"" with seabirds removing the bait while not getting caught. (iii) One-hundred and seventy-six seabirds (3% of attempts) were observed being ""caught"" during line setting, with three albatross species - Laysan (Phoebastria immutabilis), black-footed (P. nigripes) and black-browed (Thalassarche melanophrys)- dominating this category. However, of these, only 85 (48%) seabird carcasses were retrieved during line hauling. Most caught seabirds were hooked through the bill. (iv) The remainder of seabird-bait interactions (7%) was not clearly observed, but likely involved more ""caught"" seabirds. Bait taking attempts and percentage outcome (e.g. successful, caught) varied between seabird species and was not always related to species abundance around fishing vessels. Using only haul data to calculate seabird bycatch grossly underestimates actual bycatch levels, with the level of seabird bycatch from pelagic longline fishing possibly double what was previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2035727149,"Background Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R1, 2, and 3) are intracellular Ca2+ release channels that regulate various vital processes. Although the ryanodine receptor type 2, another type of intracellular Ca2+ release channel, has been shown to play a role in embryonic cardiomyocytes, the functions of the IP3Rs in cardiogenesis remain unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings We found that IP3R1−/−-IP3R2−/− double-mutant mice died in utero with developmental defects of the ventricular myocardium and atrioventricular (AV) canal of the heart by embryonic day (E) 11.5, even though no cardiac defect was detectable in IP3R1−/− or IP3R2−/− single-mutant mice at this developmental stage. The double-mutant phenotype resembled that of mice deficient for calcineurin/NFATc signaling, and NFATc was inactive in embryonic hearts from the double knockout-mutant mice. The double mutation of IP3R1/R2 and pharmacologic inhibition of IP3Rs mimicked the phenotype of the AV valve defect that result from the inhibition of calcineurin, and it could be rescued by constitutively active calcineurin. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest an essential role for IP3Rs in cardiogenesis in part through the regulation of calcineurin-NFAT signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1967297488,"Progenitor cell therapies show great promise, but their potential for clinical applications requires improved storage and transportation. Desiccated cells stored at ambient temperature would provide economic and practical advantages over approaches employing cell freezing and subzero temperature storage. The objectives of this study were to assess a method for loading the stabilizing sugar, trehalose, into hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPC) and to evaluate the effects of subsequent freeze-drying and storage at ambient temperature on differentiation and clonogenic potential. HPC were isolated from human umbilical cord blood and loaded with trehalose using an endogenous cell surface receptor, termed P2Z. Solution containing trehalose-loaded HPC was placed into vials, which were transferred to a tray freeze-dryer and removed during each step of the freeze-drying process to assess differentiation and clonogenic potential. Control groups for these experiments were freshly isolated HPC. Control cells formed 1450±230 CFU-GM, 430±140 BFU-E, and 50±40 CFU-GEMM per 50 µL. Compared to the values for the control cells, there was no statistical difference observed for cells removed at the end of the freezing step or at the end of primary drying. There was a gradual decrease in the number of CFU-GM and BFU-E for cells removed at different temperatures during secondary drying; however, there were no significant differences in the number of CFU-GEMM. To determine storage stability of lyophilized HPC, cells were stored for 4 weeks at 25°C in the dark. Cells reconstituted immediately after lyophilization produced 580±90 CFU-GM (∼40%, relative to unprocessed controls p<0.0001), 170±70 BFU-E (∼40%, p<0.0001), and 41±22 CFU-GEMM (∼82%, p = 0.4171), and cells reconstituted after 28 days at room temperature produced 513±170 CFU-GM (∼35%, relative to unprocessed controls, p<0.0001), 112±68 BFU-E (∼26%, p<0.0001), and 36±17 CFU-GEMM (∼82%, p = 0.2164) These studies are the first to document high level retention of CFU-GEMM following lyophilization and storage for 4 weeks at 25°C. This type of flexible storage stability would potentially permit the ability to ship and store HPC without the need for refrigeration."
https://openalex.org/W1984672084,"Background Although randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard of evidence, their reporting is often suboptimal. Trial registries have the potential to contribute important methodologic information for critical appraisal of study results. Methods and Findings The objective of the study was to evaluate the reporting of key methodologic study characteristics in trial registries. We identified a random sample (n = 265) of actively recruiting RCTs using the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal in 2008. We assessed the reporting of relevant domains from the Cochrane Collaboration's ‘Risk of bias’ tool and other key methodological aspects. Our primary outcomes were the proportion of registry records with adequate reporting of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, and trial outcomes. Two reviewers independently assessed each record. Weighted overall proportions in the ICTRP search portal for adequate reporting of sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding (including and excluding open label RCT) and primary outcomes were 5.7% (95% CI 3.0–8.4%), 1.4% (0–2.8%), 41% (35–47%), 8.4% (4.1–13%), and 66% (60–72%), respectively. The proportion of adequately reported RCTs was higher for registries that used specific methodological fields for describing methods of randomization and allocation concealment compared to registries that did not. Concerning other key methodological aspects, weighted overall proportions of RCTs with adequately reported items were as follows: eligibility criteria (81%), secondary outcomes (46%), harm (5%) follow-up duration (62%), description of the interventions (53%) and sample size calculation (1%). Conclusions Trial registries currently contain limited methodologic information about registered RCTs. In order to permit adequate critical appraisal of trial results reported in journals and registries, trial registries should consider requesting details on key RCT methods to complement journal publications. Full protocols remain the most comprehensive source of methodologic information and should be made publicly available."

From a screen for new memory mutants, we identified alleles of the gilgamesh (gish) gene, which encodes a casein kinase Iγ homolog that is preferentially expressed in the mushroom body neurons. The gish-encoded kinase participates in the physiology of these neurons underlying memory formation since the mutant memory deficit was rescued with expression of a gish cDNA in these neurons only during adulthood. A cellular memory trace, detected as increased calcium influx into the α′/β′ neuron processes in response to the odor used for conditioning, was disrupted in gish mutants. Epistasis experiments indicated a lack of genetic interactions between gish and rutabaga.

Casein kinase Iγ mutants (Gish) are impaired in the formation of olfactory memories Gish functions in memory independently of the rutabaga-encoded adenylyl cyclase Gish is required for a memory trace that forms in α′/β′ mushroom body neurons The formation of new memories occurs, in part, through the activation of molecular signaling pathways within neurons that comprise the neural circuitry necessary for learning, storing memories, and expressing those memories when appropriate retrieval cues appear. A long-standing problem in the field of memory research is to define each of these pathways and how the activation of these pathways is translated into memory at the cellular and behavioral levels. Past research has implicated many signaling systems that participate in the cellular mechanisms underlying learning. For instance, calcium-mediated signaling is critical, in part through calmodulin dependent kinases, for the formation of cellular models for memory like hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) as well as for behavioral memory (Lisman et al., 2002Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H. The molecular basis of CaMKII function in synaptic and behavioural memory.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Signaling through mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) has also been shown to be necessary in hippocampal neurons for LTP and behavioral memories (Sweatt, 2004Sweatt J.D. Mitogen-activated protein kinases in synaptic plasticity and memory.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Another major mechanism for forming memory is through cAMP signaling, a conclusion made across species early in the study of the cellular mechanisms of learning (Brunelli et al., 1976Brunelli M.

In Drosophila, for instance, the molecular and biochemical characterization of two olfactory learning defective mutants, dunce and rutabaga (rut), demonstrated that the cAMP signaling pathway plays an essential role in memory formation.

The delineation of the neurons that require these gene products, and the developmental period requiring their activity (adulthood), allows the very specific conclusion that cAMP signaling in adult mushroom body neurons underlies olfactory learning. Although the cAMP pathway is essential for memory formation, the lack of either the rut-encoded cyclase or downstream protein kinase A (PKA) activity does not abolish initial learning after olfactory conditioning in Drosophila (Han et al., 1992Han P.L.

Flies carrying strong hypomorphs or null alleles perform about half as well as control flies. This observation predicts the existence of additional molecules and independent signaling pathways that contribute to short-term memory formation. Consistent with this prediction, several other Drosophila short-term memory mutants have been discovered through genetic screens, including Volado, which encodes an α-integrin (Grotewiel et al., 1998Grotewiel M.S.

However, it remains unknown whether these learning and memory genes define functions independent of cAMP signaling for memory formation. The delineation of all signaling pathways that are engaged in specific neurons during memory formation and how they interact with one another to encode memories is a general issue that needs resolution for a deep understanding of memory. Genes that are required for memory formation may also have important roles in development. Homozygous mutants of these genes may not survive for the screening of adult behavioral deficits. Prior screens for learning mutants were all designed to detect recessive alleles and so genes with both essential developmental and physiological (adult) roles would have been missed in prior screens. Although many of the early learning mutants were identified in recessive screens, subsequent characterization showed them to have dominant or semidominant effects on behavior (Davis, 1996Davis R.L. Physiology and biochemistry of Drosophila learning mutants.Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 299-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, Grotewiel et al., 1998Grotewiel M.S. Beck C.D. Wu K.H. Zhu X.R. Davis R.L. Integrin-mediated short-term memory in Drosophila.Nature. 1998; 391: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This prompted us to conduct a dominant screen for genes that are important for memory formation. Here, we report the isolation of a new Drosophila memory gene, gilgamesh (gish). The gish gene encodes a casein kinase Iγ (CKIγ) homolog in flies (Hummel et al., 2002Hummel T. Attix S. Gunning D. Zipursky S.L. Temporal control of glial cell migration in the Drosophila eye requires gilgamesh, hedgehog, and eye specification genes.Neuron. 2002; 33: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The lack of genetic interactions between gish and rutabaga indicates that gish function in olfactory learning is independent of the cAMP signaling pathway headed by the rut-encoded adenyly cyclase. We have previously constructed and screened ∼6000 enhancer detector lines for preferential expression of the lacZ reporter in the mushroom bodies (Han et al., 1996Han P.L. Meller V. Davis R.L. The Drosophila brain revisited by enhancer detection.J. Neurobiol. 1996; 31: 88-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), because of the importance of these neural structures for olfactory learning in insects. Twenty of the lines from this expression screen were homozygous lethal or sterile. We tested memory retention in each of these lines as heterozygotes at multiple times after olfactory classical conditioning. One line, MB896, exhibited a significant impairment relative to the rosy (ry) control flies at 3 min, 30 min, and 3 hr after training (Figure 1A ). In addition, homozygous MB896 flies, although sterile, exhibited a more severe impairment over heterozygotes in 3 min and 3 hr memory after olfactory conditioning (Figure 1B). The memory deficits in MB896 heterozygous and homozygous flies are unlikely due to defects in sensorimotor processes since no abnormality in shock or odor avoidance was observed in these flies (Figure 1C). Inverse PCR experiments defined the genetic location of the MB896 enhancer detector element to a site within the gilgamesh (gish) gene, which encodes a casein kinase I γ (CKIγ) homolog in flies. Thus, the gishMB896 line defined gish as a new, semidominant learning mutant with reporter expression preferentially in the mushroom bodies. Gish belongs to the CKI family of serine/threonine protein kinases. The major consensus phosphorylation sequence in substrate proteins for CKI family members is S/T(P)-X1-2-S/T (Flotow et al., 1990Flotow H. Graves P.R. Wang A.Q. Fiol C.J. Roeske R.W. Roach P.J. Phosphate groups as substrate determinants for casein kinase I action.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14264-14269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Meggio et al., 1992Meggio F. Perich J.W. Marin O. Pinna L.A. The comparative efficiencies of the Ser(P)-, Thr(P)- and Tyr(P)-residues as specificity determinants for casein kinase-1.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1460-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The second S/T site becomes a CKI phosphorylation site only after the first S/T site is phosphorylated by a priming kinase. The substrate requirement for a priming phosphorylation suggests that CKI functions downstream of yet another protein kinase. Since the cAMP signaling cascade has been shown to be essential for normal learning and memory in Drosophila, we hypothesized that cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) may function as the priming kinase for Gish function in learning. Since complete loss-of-function mutants of PKA are lethal (Skoulakis et al., 1993Skoulakis E.M. Kalderon D. Davis R.L. Preferential expression in mushroom bodies of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A and its role in learning and memory.Neuron. 1993; 11: 197-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), we investigated the epistatic relationship between gish and the cAMP signaling pathway using alleles in the rut-encoded adenylyl cyclase gene, which functions upstream of PKA. First, we combined the rut2080 allele with gishMB896 and a more extreme gish allele, gishKG03891 (see below), respectively in the ry background. The rut2080 allele has a P element inserted in the promoter region of the rut gene and is a strong hypomorph (Han et al., 1992Han P.L. Levin L.R. Reed R.R. Davis R.L. Preferential expression of the Drosophila rutabaga gene in mushroom bodies, neural centers for learning in insects.Neuron. 1992; 9: 619-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). If gish function was dependent on the cAMP pathway, then rut2080; gishMB896/+ and rut2080; gishKG03891/+ flies would perform indistinguishably from rut2080 flies. However, we found that the presence of either gish mutant allele further reduced the performance scores of rut2080. This reduction was close to additive (Figure 2A ). To exclude the possibility that the additive effect was due to residual rut activity in the rut2080 allele, we employed the null allele rut1. This allele carries a point mutation in the catalytic domain of the adenylyl cyclase and causes a complete loss of adenylyl cyclase activity (Levin et al., 1992Levin L.R. Han P.L. Hwang P.M. Feinstein P.G. Davis R.L. Reed R.R. The Drosophila learning and memory gene rutabaga encodes a Ca2+/Calmodulin-responsive adenylyl cyclase.Cell. 1992; 68: 479-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The gish mutant alleles further reduced the performance scores of rut1 flies (Figure 2B). These data indicated that gish functions outside of the cAMP signaling pathway defined by rut. The gish gene is located on chromosome 3R extending across ∼30 kb of genomic DNA (Figure 3A ). Drosophila gish is alternatively spliced like its closest relative in mammals, CKIγ3 (Zhai et al., 1995Zhai L. Graves P.R. Robinson L.C. Italiano M. Culbertson M.R. Rowles J. Cobb M.H. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. Casein kinase I gamma subfamily.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12717-12724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Two major transcription initiation sites were predicted from the sequences of a collection of gish cDNA clones (Figure 3B). The gish mRNAs generated from the first transcription initiation site encode proteins with an extra 41 amino acids at the N terminus compared to those from the second transcription initiation site. Within the region encoding the kinase domain, two exons are utilized in a mutually exclusive way among gish isoforms (Figure 3B). The gishMB896 line carries an enhancer detector element in the second intron of the gish gene, upstream of the second transcription initiation site. Two additional alleles were available and characterized: gish04895 and gishKG03891. The gish04895 and gishKG03891 lines have P element insertions in the second and third exons of gish, respectively (Figure 3A). Both lines, like gishMB896, exhibited male sterility. The gishKG03891 allele also exhibited strong, but incomplete, recessive lethality. To determine how gish expression was affected by these alleles, we designed three quantitative PCR amplicons for the gish gene: the “long” and “short” amplicons were specific for gish transcripts utilizing the first and second transcription initiation sites, respectively, while the “all” amplicon was common for all splice isoforms. We then measured the relative amounts of “long,” “short,” and “all” gish transcripts by quantitative RT-PCR in control and homozygous mutant heads (Figure 3C). Gish expression was altered in all three alleles. In gishMB896, transcripts from the first but not the second initiation site were severely reduced in abundance. In gish04895, transcripts from the first initiation site were almost undetectable while transcripts from the second initiation site were increased over control in abundance. Very little of the “long” transcripts and ∼25% of the “short” transcripts were found in the gishKG03891 homozygotes (Figure 3C). Over all, gish transcripts were downregulated about 50% in both gishMB896 and gish04895 homozygotes, while in gishKG03891 homozygotes, less than 20% gish transcripts remained (Figure 3C). We developed rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Drosophila Gish proteins. On western blots of head extracts, Gish antibodies recognized two major bands (Figure 3D). The correspondence of the two major protein bands to the two transcription units of gish was established by overexpressing UAS-gish transgenes in all neurons of the fly head using Elav-GAL4 and comparing the patterns in the head extract to that of controls. The high molecular weight band was diminished in all three gish mutants, while the low molecular weight band was diminished only in gishKG03891 (Figure 3D). This result is consistent with the results of quantitative RT-PCR experiments and identifies the long and short transcripts as encoding the larger and smaller protein isoforms, respectively. We next examined the behavioral phenotypes of all gish alleles. All three gish alleles (gishMB896, gish04895, and gishKG03891) were outcrossed to w(CS10) for 6 generations to normalize the genetic background. Memory retention in gish heterozygous mutants and w(CS10) control was tested at 3, 30, and 180 min after olfactory classical conditioning. The gishKG03891 mutant as well as gishMB896 performed more poorly than the w(CS10) control at all time points tested (Figure 4A ). In the gish04895 mutant, the memory deficits were evident at 30 min and 180 min but not at 3 min after training (Figure 4A). The less severe phenotype observed in gish04895 compared to gishMB896 and gishKG03891 may be accounted for by functional compensation from the upregulation of gish “short” transcripts in gish04895 (Figures 3C and 3D). Shock and odor avoidance for all three gish mutants were indistinguishable from the control (Figure 4B). The nuclear lacZ reporter expression of gishMB896 was detected in the photoreceptor cells, mushroom body cells, lamina, medulla, and local neurons around antennal lobes (Figures 5A and 5B ). Gish expression in photoreceptor cells is consistent with its role in controlling glial cell migration in the developing eye (Hummel et al., 2002Hummel T. Attix S. Gunning D. Zipursky S.L. Temporal control of glial cell migration in the Drosophila eye requires gilgamesh, hedgehog, and eye specification genes.Neuron. 2002; 33: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine whether the enhancer detector in gishMB896 reflected authentic gish expression, we performed in situ hybridization using an antisense probe against all gish splicing isoforms. The in situ signals detected in the neuronal perikarya confirmed the expression of gish in the mushroom bodies (Figures 5C and 5D). We further examined Gish protein localization by immunohistochemistry. Gish protein was found in the mushroom body calyces, peduncles and α, α′, β, β′, and γ lobes (Figures 5E–5H). Very little or no Gish protein was detected in mushroom body perikarya. We also observed significant Gish staining in the primary components of central complex, such as the ellipsoid body (not shown), the fan-shaped body (Figure 5G), the noduli (Figure 5G), and the protocerebral bridge (Figure 5H). Therefore, Gish is broadly expressed in the adult brain with an elevated expression in the mushroom body and central complex. The localization of Gish protein to the dendritic (calyces) and axonal (peduncles and lobes) compartments but not to the cell bodies (perikarya) of the mushroom bodies suggests that Gish functions in neuronal processes. To prove that the memory deficit in gish was due to altered expression of the gene, we made a UAS-gish construct and generated independent transgenic lines to perform behavioral rescue experiments of the memory phenotype in gish mutants. The UAS-transgene carried a gish cDNA representing the first transcriptional unit and having two extra exons at the 3′ end (Figure 6A ). The cDNA was recovered by RT-PCR using total RNA isolated from fly heads. The two extra 3′ exons indicated that there exist additional alternative splice forms for the gish gene. Over several years of study, the dominant effect of gish alleles on memory formation in the w(CS10) background fluctuated while the memory deficits in homozygous gish mutants were more stable. Therefore, we decided to rescue the memory deficits in the gishMB896 homozygous lines. The UAS-gish transgene was expressed in the mushroom bodies using the 247-GAL4 driver in homozygous gishMB896 mutants (Figure 6B). This expression partially rescued the 3 min memory impairment of gishMB896 homozygous mutants. These data map the requirement of 3 min performance on gish function to the expression domain of 247-GAL4. The 247-GAL4 line expresses in all three mushroom body lobes with significantly more levels found in the α/β and γ lobes than in α′/β′ (Schwaerzel et al., 2002Schwaerzel M. Heisenberg M. Zars T. Extinction antagonizes olfactory memory at the subcellular level.Neuron. 2002; 35: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, Krashes et al., 2007Krashes M.J.

Sequential use of mushroom body neuron subsets during drosophila odor memory processing.Neuron. 2007; 53: 103-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). A similar level of rescue was observed with 238Y-GAL4, another driver with expression in all types mushroom body neurons (see below). The failure to observe complete rescue could be due to insufficient levels of expression conferred by the GAL4 driver, a requirement for gish function outside of the expression domain of the driver, or a requirement for multiple isoforms of the gish gene. No rescue was observed if UAS-gish was expressed only in α′/β′ neurons by c305a-GAL4 or only in α/β neurons by c739-GAL4 in homozygous gishMB896 mutants (Figure 6C). To determine whether the behavioral rescue observed was due to the expression of UAS-gish during development, adulthood, or both, we combined the TARGET system (McGuire et al., 2003McGuire S.E. Le P.T. Osborn A.J. Matsumoto K. Davis R.L. Spatiotemporal rescue of memory dysfunction in Drosophila.Science. 2003; 302: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) with 247-GAL4 and 238Y-GAL4 to drive UAS-gish expression in the mushroom bodies of gishMB896 mutants at different times of development. When flies were raised and maintained at 30°C, a temperature restrictive for the function of GAL80ts, 247, or 238Y driven UAS-gish expression produced partial rescue of the gish learning impairment (Figure 7A ), similar to that shown in Figure 6B. When flies were kept at 18°C throughout development and adulthood stages, a temperature permissive for the function of GAL80ts, no rescue was observed (Figure 7B). We next sought to determine whether expression of gish exclusively during the adult phase could rescue the memory impairment of gishMB896. Flies of different genotypes were raised at 18°C until 1 day after eclosion and then shifted to 30°C for 4 days before testing. For both GAL80ts/+; 247, gishMB896/UAS-gish, gishMB896, and GAL80ts/+; 238Y, gishMB896/UAS-gish, gishMB896 flies, expression of gish specifically in the adult phase produced significant rescue of the memory phenotype (Figure 7C). When UAS-gish was expressed only during development in gishMB896 mutant flies, no rescue was observed (Figure 7D). These results indicate that Gish participates in the physiological processes that underlie memory formation in adult flies, although they do not exclude an additional role in the development of the brain, since the rescue observed was incomplete. Behavioral memory is formed and stored through a set of changes, or memory traces, within nervous system that alter the processing and response to the sensory information that is learned. In the last few years, several different memory traces were discovered to form after olfactory associative training using functional optical imaging (Yu et al., 2004Yu D. Ponomarev A. Davis R.L.

Mamiya A. Chiang A.S. Zhong Y. Imaging of an early memory trace in the Drosophila mushroom body.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4368-4376Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). One of these memory traces forms in the α′/β′ lobes of the mushroom bodies and is observed as enhanced Ca2+ influx in response to trained (CS+) versus control odor (CS−) after a single training trial (Wang et al., 2008Wang Y. Mamiya A. Chiang A.S. Zhong Y. Imaging of an early memory trace in the Drosophila mushroom body.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4368-4376Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Since our results indicated that gish is required in the mushroom bodies for normal short-term memory formation, and this memory trace is the only one known to form within these cells shortly after training, we tested the hypothesis that gish function is required for the formation of the α′/β′ memory trace. We used c305a-GAL4 to drive the expression of UAS-G-CaMP, a Ca2+ level indicator, in the α′/β′ lobes (Figure 8A ). Groups of flies carrying c305a-GAL4 and UAS-G-CaMP were trained using octanol as CS+ and benzaldehyde as CS−, and then one fly was randomly selected from each group and prepared for live, functional imaging of Ca2+ responses in the mushroom bodies to the CS+ and CS− odors. The remainder of the flies in each group was tested behaviorally at 30 min after training, approximately the same time at which functional odor responses were recorded. Control flies trained with a forward protocol fo"

Elsewhere, evidence demonstrates that people show deficiencies in the processing of other-race relative to own-race faces. We ask whether this other-race effect impacts on attentional attraction to infant faces. Using a dot-probe task to reveal the spatial allocation of attention, we investigate whether other-race infants capture attention. Principal Findings South Asian and White participants (young adults aged 18–23 years) responded to a probe shape appearing in a location previously occupied by either an infant face or an adult face; across trials, the race (South Asian/White) of the faces was manipulated. Results indicated that participants were faster to respond to probes that appeared in the same location as infant faces than adult faces, but only on own-race trials. Conclusions/Significance Own-race infant faces attract attention, but other-race infant faces do not. Sensitivity to face-specific care-seeking cues in other-race kindenschema may be constrained by interracial contact and experience."

All patients were given standard anti-TB treatment. Each subject was followed up for 6 months and treatment outcomes were documented. Blood samples were obtained for the ESAT-6 and CFP-10 (EC) ELISPOT at diagnosis, 1-, 2-, 4- and 6-months. Qualitative and quantitative reversion of the ELISPOT results were assessed with McNemar test, conditional logistic regression and mixed-effects hierarchical Poisson models.A total of 116 cases were recruited and EC ELISPOT was positive for 87% (95 of 109) at recruitment. There was a significant decrease in the proportion of EC ELISPOT positive cases over the treatment period (p<0.001). Most of the reversion occurred between the start and first month of treatment and at completion at 6 months. ESAT-6 had higher median counts compared to CFP-10 at all time points. Counts for each antigen declined significantly with therapy (p<0.001). Reverters had lower median SFUs at the start of treatment compared to non-Reverters for both antigens. Apart from the higher median counts for non-Reverters, no other risk factors for non-reversion were found.TB treatment induces qualitative and quantitative reversion of a positive in-house IGRA in newly diagnosed cases of active TB disease. As this does not occur reliably in the majority of cured individuals, qualitative and quantitative reversion of an IGRA ELISPOT has limited clinical utility as a surrogate marker of treatment efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2027544313,"Background Oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) and oxLDL-containing immune complexes (oxLDL-IC) contribute to formation of lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells). It has been shown that oxLDL-IC are considerably more efficient than oxLDL in induction of foam cell formation, inflammatory cytokines secretion, and cell survival promotion. Whereas oxLDL is taken up by several scavenger receptors, oxLDL-IC are predominantly internalized through the FCγ receptor I (FCγ RI). This study examined differences in intracellular trafficking of lipid and apolipoprotein moieties of oxLDL and oxLDL-IC and the impact on oxidative stress. Methodology/Findings Fluorescently labeled lipid and protein moieties of oxLDL co-localized within endosomal and lysosomal compartments in U937 human monocytic cells. In contrast, the lipid moiety of oxLDL-IC was detected in the endosomal compartment, whereas its apolipoprotein moiety advanced to the lysosomal compartment. Cells treated with oxLDL-IC prior to oxLDL demonstrated co-localization of internalized lipid moieties from both oxLDL and oxLDL-IC in the endosomal compartment. This sequential treatment likely inhibited oxLDL lipid moieties from trafficking to the lysosomal compartment. In RAW 264.7 macrophages, oxLDL-IC but not oxLDL induced GFP-tagged heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and HSP70B', which co-localized with the lipid moiety of oxLDL-IC in the endosomal compartment. This suggests that HSP70 family members might prevent the degradation of the internalized lipid moiety of oxLDL-IC by delaying its advancement to the lysosome. The data also showed that mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased and generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species was increased in U937 cell treated with oxLDL compared to oxLDL-IC. Conclusions/Significance Findings suggest that lipid and apolipoprotein moieties of oxLDL-IC traffic to separate cellular compartments, and that HSP70/70B' might sequester the lipid moiety of oxLDL-IC in the endosomal compartment. This mechanism could ultimately influence macrophage function and survival. Furthermore, oxLDL-IC might regulate the intracellular trafficking of free oxLDL possibly through the induction of HSP70/70B'."
https://openalex.org/W2067979195,"Background Despite high potential for HIV-1 genetic variation, the emergence of some mutations is constrained by fitness costs, and may be associated with compensatory amino acid (AA) co-variation. To characterize the interplay between Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated pressure and HIV-1 evolutionary pathways, we investigated AA co-variation in Gag sequences obtained from 449 South African individuals chronically infected with HIV-1 subtype C. Methodology/Principal Findings Individuals with CTL responses biased toward Gag presented lower viral loads than individuals with under-represented Gag-specific CTL responses. Using methods that account for founder effects and HLA linkage disequilibrium, we identified 35 AA sites under Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-restricted CTL selection pressure and 534 AA-to-AA interactions. Analysis of two-dimensional distances between co-varying residues revealed local stabilization mechanisms since 40% of associations involved neighboring residues. Key features of our co-variation analysis included sites with a high number of co-varying partners, such as HLA-associated sites, which had on average 55% more connections than other co-varying sites. Conclusions/Significance Clusters of co-varying AA around HLA-associated sites (especially at typically conserved sites) suggested that cooperative interactions act to preserve the local structural stability and protein function when CTL escape mutations occur. These results expose HLA-imprinted HIV-1 polymorphisms and their interlinked mutational paths in Gag that are likely due to opposite selective pressures from host CTL-mediated responses and viral fitness constraints."

In this study, we addressed this question by studying in the effect of adenovirus-mediated LETM1 in the lung cancer cell and lung cancer model mice. To investigate the effects of adenovirus-LETM1 in vitro, we infected with adenovirus-LETM1 in A549 cells. Additionally, in vivo effects of LETM1 were evaluated on K-ras(LA1) mice, human non-small cell lung cancer model mice, by delivering the LETM1 via aerosol through nose-only inhalation system. The effects of LETM1 on lung cancer growth and AMPK related signals were evaluated. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of LETM1 could induce destruction of mitochondria of lung cancer cells through depleting ATP and AMPK activation. Furthermore, adenoviral-LETM1 also altered Akt signaling and inhibited the cell cycle while facilitating apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2150126643,"Background The current obesity epidemic is thought to be partly driven by over-consumption of sugar-sweetened diets and soft drinks. Loss-of-control over eating and addiction to drugs of abuse share overlapping brain mechanisms including changes in motivational drive, such that stimuli that are often no longer ‘liked’ are still intensely ‘wanted’ [7], . The neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor system has been implicated in both learned appetitive behaviors and addiction to alcohol and opioids; however, its role in natural reward seeking remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We sought to determine whether the NK1-receptor system plays a role in the reinforcing properties of sucrose using a novel selective and clinically safe NK1-receptor antagonist, ezlopitant (CJ-11,974), in three animal models of sucrose consumption and seeking. Furthermore, we compared the effect of ezlopitant on ethanol consumption and seeking in rodents. The NK1-receptor antagonist, ezlopitant decreased appetitive responding for sucrose more potently than for ethanol using an operant self-administration protocol without affecting general locomotor activity. To further evaluate the selectivity of the NK1-receptor antagonist in decreasing consumption of sweetened solutions, we compared the effects of ezlopitant on water, saccharin-, and sodium chloride (NaCl) solution consumption. Ezlopitant decreased intake of saccharin but had no effect on water or salty solution consumption. Conclusions/Significance The present study indicates that the NK1-receptor may be a part of a common pathway regulating the self-administration, motivational and reinforcing aspects of sweetened solutions, regardless of caloric value, and those of substances of abuse. Additionally, these results indicate that the NK1-receptor system may serve as a therapeutic target for obesity induced by over-consumption of natural reinforcers."

https://openalex.org/W1971148354,"EMMPRIN's expression in melanoma tissue was reported to be predictive of poor prognosis. Here we demonstrate that EMMPRIN up-regulated VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) in two different primary melanoma cell lines and consequently increased migration and proliferation of these cells while inhibiting their apoptosis. SiRNA inhibition of VEGFR-2 expression abrogated these EMMPRIN effects. EMMPRIN regulation of VEGFR-2 was mediated through the over-expression of HIF-2alpha and its translocation to the nucleus where it forms heterodimers with HIF-1beta. These results were supported by an in vivo correlation between the expression of EMMPRIN with that of VEGFR-2 in human melanoma tissues as well as with the extent of HIF-2alpha localization in the nucleus. They demonstrate a novel mechanism by which EMMPRIN promotes tumor progression through HIF-2alpha/VEGFR-2 mediated mechanism, with an autocrine role in melanoma cell malignancy. The inhibition of EMMPRIN in cancer may thus simultaneously target both the VEGFR-2/VEGF system and the matrix degrading proteases to block tumor cell growth and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2014938954,"Background Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) is a Ste20-related serine/threonine kinase activated by a range of environmental stimuli including genotoxic stress, growth factors, inflammatory cytokines and antigen receptor triggering. Being inducibly recruited to membrane-proximal signalling scaffolds to regulate NFAT, AP-1 and NFκB-mediated gene transcription in T-cells, the function of HPK1 in B-cells to date remains rather ill-defined. Methodology/Principal Findings By using two loss of function models, we show that HPK1 displays a novel function in regulating B-cell integrin activity. Wehi 231 lymphoma cells lacking HPK1 after shRNA mediated knockdown exhibit increased basic activation levels of Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1), accompanied by a severe lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) dependent homotypic aggregation and increased adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). The observed phenotype of enhanced integrin activity is caused downstream of Src, by a signalling module independent of PI3K and PLC, involving HPK1, SKAP55 homologue (SKAP-HOM) and Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM). This alters actin dynamics and renders focal adhesion kinase (FAK) constitutively phosphorylated. Bone marrow and splenic B-cell development of HPK1−/− mice are largely unaffected, except age-related tendencies for increased splenic cellularity and BCR downregulation. In addition, naïve splenic knockout B-cells appear hyperresponsive to a range of stimuli applied ex vivo as recently demonstrated by others for T-cells. Conclusions/Significance We therefore conclude that HPK1 exhibits a dual function in B-cells by negatively regulating integrin activity and controlling cellular activation, which makes it an interesting candidate to study in pathological settings like autoimmunity and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2109205838,"Human lifespan is approximately 25% heritable, and genetic factors may be particularly important for achieving exceptional longevity. Accordingly, siblings of centenarians have a dramatically higher probability of reaching extreme old age than the general population.To map the loci conferring a survival advantage, we performed the second genomewide linkage scan on human longevity and the first using a high-density marker panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms. By systematically testing a range of minimum age cutoffs in 279 families with multiple long-lived siblings, we identified a locus on chromosome 3p24-22 with a genomewide significant allele-sharing LOD score of 4.02 (empirical P = 0.037) and a locus on chromosome 9q31-34 with a highly suggestive LOD score of 3.89 (empirical P = 0.054). The empirical P value for the combined result was 0.002. A third novel locus with a LOD score of 4.05 on chromosome 12q24 was detected in a subset of the data, and we also obtained modest evidence for a previously reported interval on chromosome 4q22-25.Our linkage data should facilitate the discovery of both common and rare variants that determine genetic variability in lifespan."
https://openalex.org/W2033366093,"Functional protein annotation is an important matter for in vivo and in silico biology. Several computational methods have been proposed that make use of a wide range of features such as motifs, domains, homology, structure and physicochemical properties. There is no single method that performs best in all functional classification problems because information obtained using any of these features depends on the function to be assigned to the protein. In this study, we portray a novel approach that combines different methods to better represent protein function. First, we formulated the function annotation problem as a classification problem defined on 300 different Gene Ontology (GO) terms from molecular function aspect. We presented a method to form positive and negative training examples while taking into account the directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure and evidence codes of GO. We applied three different methods and their combinations. Results show that combining different methods improves prediction accuracy in most cases. The proposed method, GOPred, is available as an online computational annotation tool (http://kinaz.fen.bilkent.edu.tr/gopred)."
https://openalex.org/W2095637752,"Pathological neovascularization is a hallmark of late stage neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and the leading cause of blindness in people over the age of 50 in the western world. The treatments focus on suppression of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), while current approved therapies are limited to inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) exclusively. However, this treatment does not address the underlying cause of AMD, and the loss of VEGF's neuroprotective can be a potential side effect. Therapy which targets the key processes in AMD, the pathological neovascularization, vessel leakage and inflammation could bring a major shift in the approach to disease treatment and prevention. In this study we have demonstrated the efficacy of such broad spectrum antiangiogenic therapy on mouse model of AMD. Methods and Findings Lodamin, a polymeric formulation of TNP-470, is a potent broad-spectrum antiangiogenic drug. Lodamin significantly reduced key processes involved in AMD progression as demonstrated in mice and rats. Its suppressive effects on angiogenesis, vascular leakage and inflammation were studied in a wide array of assays including; a Matrigel, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), Miles assay, laser-induced CNV and corneal micropocket assay. Lodamin significantly suppressed the secretion of various pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CNV lesion including monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1/Ccl2). Importantly, Lodamin was found to regress established CNV lesions, unlike soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlk-1). The drug was found to be safe in mice and have little toxicity as demonstrated by electroretinography (ERG) assessing retinal and by histology. Conclusions Lodamin, a polymer formulation of TNP-470, was identified as a first in its class, broad-spectrum antiangiogenic drug that can be administered orally or locally to treat corneal and retinal neovascularization. Several unique properties make Lodamin especially beneficial for ophthalmic use. Our results support the concept that broad spectrum antiangiogenic drugs are promising agents for AMD treatment and prevention."
https://openalex.org/W1971953276,"Motivation Mass spectrometry is a high throughput, fast, and accurate method of protein analysis. Using the peaks detected in spectra, we can compare a normal group with a disease group. However, the spectrum is complicated by scale shifting and is also full of noise. Such shifting makes the spectra non-stationary and need to align before comparison. Consequently, the preprocessing of the mass data plays an important role during the analysis process. Noises in mass spectrometry data come in lots of different aspects and frequencies. A powerful data preprocessing method is needed for removing large amount of noises in mass spectrometry data. Results Hilbert-Huang Transformation is a non-stationary transformation used in signal processing. We provide a novel algorithm for preprocessing that can deal with MALDI and SELDI spectra. We use the Hilbert-Huang Transformation to decompose the spectrum and filter-out the very high frequencies and very low frequencies signal. We think the noise in mass spectrometry comes from many sources and some of the noises can be removed by analysis of signal frequence domain. Since the protein in the spectrum is expected to be a unique peak, its frequence domain should be in the middle part of frequence domain and will not be removed. The results show that HHT, when used for preprocessing, is generally better than other preprocessing methods. The approach not only is able to detect peaks successfully, but HHT has the advantage of denoising spectra efficiently, especially when the data is complex. The drawback of HHT is that this approach takes much longer for the processing than the wavlet and traditional methods. However, the processing time is still manageable and is worth the wait to obtain high quality data."
https://openalex.org/W2145076722,"Background MMP-13, a zinc dependent protease which catalyses the cleavage of type II collagen, is expressed in osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, but not in normal adult tissues. Therefore, the protease has been intensively studied as a target for the inhibition of progression of OA and RA. Recent reports suggest that selective inhibition of MMP-13 may be achieved by targeting the hemopexin (Hpx) domain of the protease, which is critical for substrate specificity. In this study, we applied a cheminformatics-based drug design approach for the identification and characterization of inhibitors targeting the amino acid residues characteristic to Hpx domain of MMP-13; these inhibitors may potentially be employed in the treatment of OA and RA. Methodology/Principal Findings Sequence-based mutual information analysis revealed five characteristic (completely conserved and unique), putative functional residues of the Hpx domain of MMP-13 (these residues hereafter are referred to as HCR-13pf). Binding of a ligand to as many of the HCR-13pf is postulated to result in an increased selective inhibition of the Hpx domain of MMP-13. Through the in silico structure-based high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) method of Glide, against a large public library of 16908 molecules from Maybridge, PubChem and Binding, we identified 25 ligands that interact with at least one of the HCR-13pf. Assessment of cross-reactivity of the 25 ligands with MMP-1 and MMP-8, members of the collagenase family as MMP-13, returned seven lead molecules that did not bind to any one of the putative functional residues of Hpx domain of MMP-1 and any of the catalytic active site residues of MMP-1 and -8, suggesting that the ligands are not likely to interact with the functional or catalytic residues of other MMPs. Further, in silico analysis of physicochemical and pharmacokinetic parameters based on Lipinski's rule of five and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) respectively, suggested potential utility of the compounds as drug leads. Conclusions/Significance We have identified seven distinct drug-like molecules binding to the HCR-13pf of MMP-13 with no observable cross-reactivity to MMP-1 and MMP-8. These molecules are potential selective inhibitors of MMP-13 that can be experimentally validated and their backbone structural scaffold could serve as building blocks in designing drug-like molecules for OA, RA and other inflammatory disorders. The systematic cheminformatics-based drug design approach applied herein can be used for rational search of other public/commercial combinatorial libraries for more potent molecules, capable of selectively inhibiting the collagenolytic activity of MMP-13."
https://openalex.org/W1993609861,"The male-specific regions of the Y chromosome (MSY) of the human and the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) are fully sequenced. The most striking difference is the dramatic rearrangement of large parts of their respective MSYs. These non-recombining regions include ampliconic gene families that are known to be important for male reproduction,and are consequently under significant selective pressure. However, whether the published Y-chromosomal pattern of ampliconic fertility genes is invariable within P. troglodytes is an open but fundamental question pertinent to discussions of the evolutionary fate of the Y chromosome in different primate mating systems. To solve this question we applied fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) of testis-specific expressed ampliconic fertility genes to metaphase Y chromosomes of 17 chimpanzees derived from 11 wild-born males and 16 bonobos representing seven wild-born males. We show that of eleven P. troglodytes Y-chromosomal lines, ten Y-chromosomal variants were detected based on the number and arrangement of the ampliconic fertility genes DAZ (deleted in azoospermia) and CDY (chromodomain protein Y)-a so-far never-described variation of a species' Y chromosome. In marked contrast, no variation was evident among seven Y-chromosomal lines of the bonobo, P. paniscus, the chimpanzee's closest living relative. Although, loss of variation of the Y chromosome in the bonobo by a founder effect or genetic drift cannot be excluded, these contrasting patterns might be explained in the context of the species' markedly different social and mating behaviour. In chimpanzees, multiple males copulate with a receptive female during a short period of visible anogenital swelling, and this may place significant selection on fertility genes. In bonobos, however, female mate choice may make sperm competition redundant (leading to monomorphism of fertility genes), since ovulation in this species is concealed by the prolonged anogenital swelling, and because female bonobos can occupy high-ranking positions in the group and are thus able to determine mate choice more freely."
https://openalex.org/W2029829129,"Arthropod cuticle is composed predominantly of a self-assembling matrix of chitin and protein. Genes encoding structural cuticular proteins are remarkably abundant in arthropod genomes, yet there has been no systematic survey of conserved motifs across cuticular protein families.Two short sequence motifs with conserved tyrosines were identified in Drosophila cuticular proteins that were similar to the GYR and YLP Interpro domains. These motifs were found in members of the CPR, Tweedle, CPF/CPFL, and (in Anopheles gambiae) CPLCG cuticular protein families, and the Dusky/Miniature family of cuticle-associated proteins. Tweedle proteins have a characteristic motif architecture that is shared with the Drosophila protein GCR1 and its orthologs in other species, suggesting that GCR1 is also cuticular. A resilin repeat, which has been shown to confer elasticity, matched one of the motifs; a number of other Drosophila proteins of unknown function exhibit a motif architecture similar to that of resilin. The motifs were also present in some proteins of the peritrophic matrix and the eggshell, suggesting molecular convergence among distinct extracellular matrices. More surprisingly, gene regulation, development, and proteolysis were statistically over-represented ontology terms for all non-cuticular matches in Drosophila. Searches against other arthropod genomes indicate that the motifs are taxonomically widespread.This survey suggests a more general definition for GYR and YLP motifs and reveals their contribution to several types of extracellular matrix. They may define sites of protein interaction with DNA or other proteins, based on ontology analysis. These results can help guide experimental studies on the biochemistry of cuticle assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1989009136,"Background Studies of patients with paraneoplastic neurologic disorders (PND) have revealed that apoptotic tumor serves as a potential potent trigger for the initiation of naturally occurring tumor immunity. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility, safety, and immunogenicity of an apoptotic tumor-autologous dendritic cell (DC) vaccine. Methods and Findings We have modeled PND tumor immunity in a clinical trial in which apoptotic allogeneic prostate tumor cells were used to generate an apoptotic tumor-autologous dendritic cell vaccine. Twenty-four prostate cancer patients were immunized in a Phase I, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine. Vaccinations were safe and well tolerated. Importantly, we also found that the vaccine was immunogenic, inducing delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation, with no effect on FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. A statistically significant increase in T cell proliferation responses to prostate tumor cells in vitro (p = 0.002), decrease in prostate specific antigen (PSA) slope (p = 0.016), and a two-fold increase in PSA doubling time (p = 0.003) were identified when we compared data before and after vaccination. Conclusions An apoptotic cancer cell vaccine modeled on naturally occurring tumor immune responses in PND patients provides a safe and immunogenic tumor vaccine.

https://openalex.org/W2009147305,"Background Intellectual disability (ID) affects 2–3% of the population and may occur with or without multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) or other medical conditions. Established genetic syndromes and visible chromosome abnormalities account for a substantial percentage of ID diagnoses, although for ∼50% the molecular etiology is unknown. Individuals with features suggestive of various syndromes but lacking their associated genetic anomalies pose a formidable clinical challenge. With the advent of microarray techniques, submicroscopic genome alterations not associated with known syndromes are emerging as a significant cause of ID and MCA. Methodology/Principal Findings High-density SNP microarrays were used to determine genome wide copy number in 42 individuals: 7 with confirmed alterations in the WS region but atypical clinical phenotypes, 31 with ID and/or MCA, and 4 controls. One individual from the first group had the most telomeric gene in the WS critical region deleted along with 2 Mb of flanking sequence. A second person had the classic WS deletion and a rearrangement on chromosome 5p within the Cri du Chat syndrome (OMIM:123450) region. Six individuals from the ID/MCA group had large rearrangements (3 deletions, 3 duplications), one of whom had a large inversion associated with a deletion that was not detected by the SNP arrays. Conclusions/Significance Combining SNP microarray analyses and qPCR allowed us to clone and sequence 21 deletion breakpoints in individuals with atypical deletions in the WS region and/or ID or MCA. Comparison of these breakpoints to databases of genomic variation revealed that 52% occurred in regions harboring structural variants in the general population. For two probands the genomic alterations were flanked by segmental duplications, which frequently mediate recurrent genome rearrangements; these may represent new genomic disorders. While SNP arrays and related technologies can identify potentially pathogenic deletions and duplications, obtaining sequence information from the breakpoints frequently provides additional information."
https://openalex.org/W1983198028,"Colorectal cancer progresses through an accumulation of somatic mutations, some of which reside in so-called “driver” genes that provide a growth advantage to the tumor. To identify points of intersection between driver gene pathways, we implemented a network analysis framework using protein interactions to predict likely connections – both precedented and novel – between key driver genes in cancer. We applied the framework to find significant connections between two genes, Apc and Cdkn1a (p21), known to be synergistic in tumorigenesis in mouse models. We then assessed the functional coherence of the resulting Apc-Cdkn1a network by engineering in vivo single node perturbations of the network: mouse models mutated individually at Apc (Apc1638N+/−) or Cdkn1a (Cdkn1a−/−), followed by measurements of protein and gene expression changes in intestinal epithelial tissue. We hypothesized that if the predicted network is biologically coherent (functional), then the predicted nodes should associate more specifically with dysregulated genes and proteins than stochastically selected genes and proteins. The predicted Apc-Cdkn1a network was significantly perturbed at the mRNA-level by both single gene knockouts, and the predictions were also strongly supported based on physical proximity and mRNA coexpression of proteomic targets. These results support the functional coherence of the proposed Apc-Cdkn1a network and also demonstrate how network-based predictions can be statistically tested using high-throughput biological data."
https://openalex.org/W2024605487,"Background The DNA of all eukaryotic organisms is packaged into nucleosomes, the basic repeating units of chromatin. The nucleosome consists of a histone octamer around which a DNA core is wrapped and the linker histone H1, which is associated with linker DNA. By altering the accessibility of DNA sequences, the nucleosome has profound effects on all DNA-dependent processes. Understanding the factors that influence nucleosome positioning is of great importance for the study of genomic control mechanisms. Transcription factors (TFs) have been suggested to play a role in nucleosome positioning in vivo. Principal Findings Here, the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature selection algorithm, the nearest neighbor algorithm (NNA), and the incremental feature selection (IFS) method were used to identify the most important TFs that either favor or inhibit nucleosome positioning by analyzing the numbers of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in 53,021 nucleosomal DNA sequences and 50,299 linker DNA sequences. A total of nine important families of TFs were extracted from 35 families, and the overall prediction accuracy was 87.4% as evaluated by the jackknife cross-validation test. Conclusions Our results are consistent with the notion that TFs are more likely to bind linker DNA sequences than the sequences in the nucleosomes. In addition, our results imply that there may be some TFs that are important for nucleosome positioning but that play an insignificant role in discriminating nucleosome-forming DNA sequences from nucleosome-inhibiting DNA sequences. The hypothesis that TFs play a role in nucleosome positioning is, thus, confirmed by the results of this study."
https://openalex.org/W2063459906,"Background We understand the dynamics of the world around us as by associating pairs of events, where one event has some influence on the other. These pairs of events can be aggregated into a web of memories representing our understanding of an episode of history. The events and the associations between them need not be directly experienced—they can also be acquired by communication. In this paper we take a network approach to study the dynamics of memories of history. Methodology/Principal Findings First we investigate the network structure of a data set consisting of reported events by several individuals and how associations connect them. We focus our measurement on degree distributions, degree correlations, cycles (which represent inconsistencies as they would break the time ordering) and community structure. We proceed to model effects of communication using an agent-based model. We investigate the conditions for the memory webs of different individuals to converge to collective memories, how groups where the individuals have similar memories (but different from other groups) can form. Conclusions/Significance Our work outlines how the cognitive representation of memories and social structure can co-evolve as a contagious process. We generate some testable hypotheses including that the number of groups is limited as a function of the total population size."
https://openalex.org/W2086787584,"Background Present technology uses mostly chimeric proteins as regulators and hormones or antibiotics as signals to induce spatial and temporal gene expression. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we show that a chromosomally integrated yeast ‘Leu3p-α-ΙΡΜ’ system constitutes a ligand-inducible regulatory “off-on” genetic switch with an extensively dynamic action area. We find that Leu3p acts as an active transcriptional repressor in the absence and as an activator in the presence of α-isopropylmalate (α-ΙΡΜ) in primary fibroblasts isolated from double transgenic mouse embryos bearing ubiquitously expressing Leu3p and a Leu3p regulated GFP reporter. In the absence of the branched amino acid biosynthetic pathway in animals, metabolically stable α-IPM presents an EC50 equal to 0.8837 mM and fast “OFF-ON” kinetics (t50ON = 43 min, t50OFF = 2.18 h), it enters the cells via passive diffusion, while it is non-toxic to mammalian cells and to fertilized mouse eggs cultured ex vivo. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate that the ‘Leu3p-α-ΙΡΜ’ constitutes a simpler and safer system for inducible gene expression in biomedical applications."
