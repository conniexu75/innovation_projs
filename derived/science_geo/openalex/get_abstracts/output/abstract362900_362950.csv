https://openalex.org/W2126421651,"Although graphite is known as one of the most chemically inert materials, we have found that graphene, a single atomic plane of graphite, can react with atomic hydrogen, which transforms this highly conductive zero-overlap semimetal into an insulator. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the obtained graphene derivative (graphane) is crystalline and retains the hexagonal lattice, but its period becomes markedly shorter than that of graphene. The reaction with hydrogen is reversible, so that the original metallic state, the lattice spacing, and even the quantum Hall effect can be restored by annealing. Our work illustrates the concept of graphene as a robust atomic-scale scaffold on the basis of which new two-dimensional crystals with designed electronic and other properties can be created by attaching other atoms and molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1999570928,"The strength of polycrystalline materials increases with decreasing grain size. Below a critical size, smaller grains might lead to softening, as suggested by atomistic simulations. The strongest size should arise at a transition in deformation mechanism from lattice dislocation activities to grain boundary–related processes. We investigated the maximum strength of nanotwinned copper samples with different twin thicknesses. We found that the strength increases with decreasing twin thickness, reaching a maximum at 15 nanometers, followed by a softening at smaller values that is accompanied by enhanced strain hardening and tensile ductility. The strongest twin thickness originates from a transition in the yielding mechanism from the slip transfer across twin boundaries to the activity of preexisting easy dislocation sources."

This new route for dissipation attacks quantum entanglement, the essential resource for quantum information as well as the central feature in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen so-called paradox and in discussions of the fate of Schrödinger's cat. The effect has been labeled ESD, which stands for early-stage disentanglement or, more frequently, entanglement sudden death. We review recent progress in studies focused on this phenomenon."

We show theoretically that an electric charge near a topological surface state induces an image magnetic monopole charge due to the topological magneto-electric effect. The magnetic field generated by the image magnetic monopole may be experimentally measured, and the inverse square law of the field dependence can be determined quantitatively. We propose that this effect can be used to experimentally realize a gas of quantum particles carrying fractional statistics, consisting of the bound states of the electric charge and the image magnetic monopole charge."

https://openalex.org/W1963493422,"Populations of certain unicellular organisms, such as suspensions of yeast in nutrient solutions, undergo transitions to coordinated activity with increasing cell density. The collective behavior is believed to arise through communication by chemical signaling via the extracellular solution. We studied large, heterogeneous populations of discrete chemical oscillators (approximately 100,000) with well-defined kinetics to characterize two different types of density-dependent transitions to synchronized oscillatory behavior. For different chemical exchange rates between the oscillators and the surrounding solution, increasing oscillator density led to (i) the gradual synchronization of oscillatory activity, or (ii) the sudden ""switching on"" of synchronized oscillatory activity. We analyze the roles of oscillator density and exchange rate of signaling species in these transitions with a mathematical model of the interacting chemical oscillators."
https://openalex.org/W1981669094,"DNA methylation is essential for silencing transposable elements and some genes in higher eukaryotes, which suggests that this modification must be tightly controlled. However, accidental changes in DNA methylation can be transmitted through mitosis (as in cancer) or meiosis, leading to epiallelic variation. We demonstrated the existence of an efficient mechanism that protects against transgenerational loss of DNA methylation in Arabidopsis. Remethylation is specific to the subset of heavily methylated repeats that are targeted by the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery. This process does not spread into flanking regions, is usually progressive over several generations, and faithfully restores wild-type methylation over target sequences in an RNAi-dependent manner. Our findings suggest an important role for RNAi in protecting genomes against long-term epigenetic defects."

https://openalex.org/W2063950368,"In humans, the tactile perception of fine textures (spatial scale &lt;200 micrometers) is mediated by skin vibrations generated as the finger scans the surface. To establish the relationship between texture characteristics and subcutaneous vibrations, a biomimetic tactile sensor has been designed whose dimensions match those of the fingertip. When the sensor surface is patterned with parallel ridges mimicking the fingerprints, the spectrum of vibrations elicited by randomly textured substrates is dominated by one frequency set by the ratio of the scanning speed to the interridge distance. For human touch, this frequency falls within the optimal range of sensitivity of Pacinian afferents, which mediate the coding of fine textures. Thus, fingerprints may perform spectral selection and amplification of tactile information that facilitate its processing by specific mechanoreceptors."

https://openalex.org/W2072308838,"The distribution of valence electrons in metals usually follows the symmetry of the underlying ionic lattice. Modulations of this distribution often occur when those electrons are not stable with respect to a new electronic order, such as spin or charge density waves. Electron density waves have been observed in many families of superconductors, and are often considered to be essential for superconductivity to exist. Recent measurements seem to show that the properties of the iron pnictides are in good agreement with band structure calculations that do not include additional ordering, implying no relation between density waves and superconductivity in these materials. Here we report that the electronic structure of Ba(1-x)K(x)Fe(2)As(2) is in sharp disagreement with those band structure calculations, and instead reveals a reconstruction characterized by a (pi, pi) wavevector. This electronic order coexists with superconductivity and persists up to room temperature (300 K)."
https://openalex.org/W2015871988,"Voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV) are functionally expressed in highly metastatic cancer cells derived from nonexcitable epithelial tissues (breast, prostate, lung, and cervix). MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells express functional sodium channel complexes, consisting of NaV1.5 and associated auxiliary β-subunits, that are responsible for a sustained inward sodium current at the membrane potential. Although these channels do not regulate cellular multiplication or migration, their inhibition by the specific blocker tetrodotoxin impairs both the extracellular gelatinolytic activity (monitored with DQ-gelatin) and cell invasiveness leading to the attenuation of colony growth and cell spreading in three-dimensional Matrigel®-composed matrices. MDA-MB-231 cells express functional cysteine cathepsins, which we found play a predominant role (∼65%) in cancer invasiveness. Matrigel® invasion is significantly decreased in the presence of specific inhibitors of cathepsins B and S (CA-074 and Z-FL-COCHO, respectively), and co-application of tetrodotoxin does not further reduce cell invasion. This suggests that cathepsins B and S are involved in invasiveness and that their proteolytic activity partly depends on NaV function. Inhibiting NaV has no consequence for cathepsins at the transcription, translation, and secretion levels. However, NaV activity leads to an intracellular alkalinization and a perimembrane acidification favorable for the extracellular activity of these acidic proteases. We propose that Nav enhance the invasiveness of cancer cells by favoring the pH-dependent activity of cysteine cathepsins. This general mechanism could lead to the identification of new targets allowing the therapeutic prevention of metastases.

Breast cancer is the most common female cancer and the primary cause of death in women by cancer worldwide (1Parkin D.M. Bray F. Ferlay J. Pisani P. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2005; 55: 74-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (17337) Google Scholar). Deaths occur primarily after the development of metastases. The invasive potential of malignant cells is mainly linked to their capacity to degrade basement membranes and extracellular matrices by various proteases. Studies have mostly focused on metalloproteases, including matrix metalloproteinases and the closely related ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) and ADAMTs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) (2Baker A.H. Edwards D.R. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3719-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar), that are key factors in growth, invasion, and angiogenesis, and to a lesser extent on aspartyl and serine proteases. Pharmaceutical inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases have been developed, but the results from clinical trials with these drugs have so far been disappointing (3Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5134) Google Scholar, 4Turk B. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 785-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cysteine cathepsins (Cat) 4The abbreviations used are: Cat, cathepsin(s); INa, sodium current; Nav, voltage-gated sodium channel(s); TTX, tetrodotoxin; AMC, 7-amino-4-methyl coumarin; CA-074, l-3-trans-(propylcarbamoyl)oxirane-2-carbonyl-l-isoleucyl-l-proline; E-64, l-3-carboxy-trans-2,3-epoxy-propionyl-leucylamide-(4-guanido)-butane; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; DHPE, N-(fluorescein-5-thiocarbamoyl)-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein; DMEM, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; PSS, physiological saline solution; siRNA, small interfering RNA; siCTL, control siRNA. related to papain (family C1, clan CA), which have been confined for decades to housekeeping tasks including intracellular degradation of endocytosed proteins (5Turk V. Turk B. Turk D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), are now known to fulfill more specific functions in numerous biological processes (such as antigen presentation, enzyme or hormone maturation, bone resorption, etc.) and pathologies (6Chapman H.A. Riese R.J. Shi G.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 63-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 7Lecaille F. Kaleta J. Bromme D. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4459-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Recently, they have emerged as important protagonists in cancer and have been reported to be involved in apoptosis, angiogenesis, proliferation, migration, and invasion (8Joyce J.A. Hanahan D. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1516-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 9Mohamed M.M. Sloane B.F. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 764-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 10Gocheva V. Joyce J.A. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Although Cat are predominantly expressed in acidic endosomal/lysosomal compartments, they are also found to be extracellularly active at physiological pH, as membrane-bound and soluble forms (11Punturieri A.

Nevertheless knowledge still remains limited concerning transport pathways and regulation of extracellular Cat in cancer cells. The involvement of ion channels in carcinogenesis and tumor progression begins to be unraveled even though their roles are not totally understood. Presently, there is growing evidence emphasizing the abnormal expression and function of voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV) in cancer cells and their involvement in invasiveness (15Roger S. Potier M. Vandier C. Besson P. Le Guennec J.Y. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 3681-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Indeed, NaV, which are up-regulated in human breast cancer tissues and associated with breast cancer progression, are functionally expressed in the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in which they potentiate invasion (16Fraser S.P. Diss J.K. Chioni A.M. Mycielska M.E. Pan H. Yamaci R.F. Pani F. Siwy Z. Krasowska M. Grzywna Z. Brackenbury W.J. Theodorou D. Koyuturk M. Kaya H. Battaloglu E. De Bella M.T. Slade M.J. Tolhurst R.

Acta. 2003; 1616: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This makes MDA-MB-231 cells a good model for studying the specific molecular mechanisms linking the activity of NaV to invasive properties of cancer cells. In this context, the aim of the present study was to identify, among proteolytic enzymes involved in cancer cell invasion, those that are regulated by NaV activity. We demonstrated that Cat are the predominant proteases involved in MDA-MB-231 invasiveness and that the activity of NaV favors the pericellular activity of CatB and CatS, through the acidification of the perimembrane pH. We also performed experiments in non-small cell lung cancer cells (H460 cell line), which also express functional NaV involved in cellular invasiveness (18Roger S. Rollin J. Barascu A. Besson P. Raynal P.I. Iochmann S. Lei M. Bougnoux P. Gruel Y. Le Guennec J.Y. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained, highlighting the fact that Cat are partly regulated by NaV activity. This work presents a new general mechanism for highly metastatic cancer cell invasiveness. Inhibitors, Substrates, and Chemicals-Tetrodotoxin (TTX) was purchased from Latoxan (France) and was prepared in pH-buffered physiological saline solution at pH 7.4. Fluorescent dyes for measuring internal and perimembrane pH (BCECF-AM and DHPE, respectively) were purchased from Invitrogen (France). Protease inhibitors and substrates were purchased from Calbiochem (VWR International). The cell-impermeant Cat inhibitors are: E-64 (100 μm), a broad spectrum inhibitor (19Barrett A.J. Kembhavi A.A.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), N-(4-biphenylacetyl)-S-methylcysteine-(D)-Arg-Phe-β-phenethylamide, 200 nm), a CatL inhibitor (21Chowdhury S.F. Sivaraman J. Wang J. Devanathan G. Lachance P. Qi H. Menard R. Lefebvre J. Konishi Y. Cygler M. Sulea T. Purisima E.O. J. Med.

Pechar M. Li W. Kopeckova P. Bromme D. Kopecek J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8849-8859Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and Z-Phe-Leu-COCHO (2 nm), a slow, tight binding inhibitor of CatS (23Walker B. Lynas J.F. Meighan M.A. Bromme D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fluorogenic substrates were Z-Phe-Arg-AMC (Z-FR-AMC), Z-Arg-Arg-AMC (Z-RR-AMC), Z-Leu-Arg-AMC (Z-LR-AMC), and Z-Gly-Pro-Arg-AMC (Z-GPR-AMC). Other drugs and chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cancer Cell Culture and Colony Growth-The cancerous human cell lines, MDA-MB-231 (breast) and H460 (lung) were purchased from the ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Cambrex) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. When indicated, MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded on a planar film or in a three-dimensional matrix of Matrigel®. Experiments assessing the involvement of Na+ in the invasion process were performed in “Normo Na” and in “Low Na” culture media. These culture solutions were prepared from a DMEM solution (Cambrex) deprived of NaCl, KCl, and CaCl2. The Normo Na solution was prepared by adding 5.4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 110 mm NaCl. The Low Na solution was prepared by adding the same salts as above except that NaCl was replaced by 110 mm choline chloride. Under these conditions, the total concentrations of Na+ are, respectively, 155 and 45 mm (45 mm of Na+ being supplied in both conditions by 44 mm NaHCO3 and 1 mm NaH2PO4). These solutions were then supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Cell size, number, and size of colonies, and the number of cells spreading into the three-dimensional matrix were analyzed with the ImageJ software 1.38I (National Institutes of Health). The assessment of sizes for cells and cell colonies was done by evaluating cell surface from pictures coming from separate experiments. The numbers of colonies and cells were counted from pictures. Electrophysiology-Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass to a resistance of 4-6 MΩ. Currents were recorded, in whole cell configuration, under voltage clamp mode at room temperature using an Axopatch 200 B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments). Analogue signals were filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz using a 1322A Digidata converter. Cell capacitance and series resistance were electronically compensated by about 60%. The P/2 subpulse correction of cell leakage and capacitance was used to study Na+ current (INa). Sodium currents were recorded by depolarizing the cells from a holding potential of -100 mV to a maximal test pulse of -5 mV for 30 ms every 500 ms. The protocol used to build sodium current-voltage (INa-V) relationships was as follows: from a holding potential of -100 mV, the membrane was stepped to potentials from -90 to +60 mV, with 5-mV increments, for 50 ms at a frequency of 2 Hz. Availability-voltage relationships were obtained by applying 50-ms prepulses using the INa-V curve procedure followed by a depolarizing pulse to -5 mV for 50 ms. In this case, the currents were normalized to the amplitude of the test current without a prepulse. Conductance through Na+ channels (gNa) was calculated as already described (17Roger S. Besson P. Le Guennec J.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1616: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The current amplitudes were normalized to cell capacitance and expressed as current density (pA/pF). The physiological saline solution (PSS) had the following composition: 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 11.1 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH (1 m). The intrapipette solution had the following composition: 125 potassium glutamate, 20 mm KCl, 0.37 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Mg-ATP, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2. Assessment of Gelatinolytic Activity by Confocal Microscopy-MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in a three-dimensional Matrigel® matrix containing 25 μg/ml of DQ-Gelatin® (Invitrogen) on glass coverslips for 24 h and were then fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. Confocal microscopy was performed with an Olympus Fluoview 500 instrument. The samples were excited at 495 nm, and emission light was recorded at 515 nm. Fluorescence density was quantified by image analysis thanks to the ImageJ software 1.38I. Cell Survival and Proliferation-The cells were seeded at 4 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate coated or not with Matrigel® and were grown for a total of 5 or 6 days. The culture medium and TTX and/or Cat inhibitors were changed every other day. Growth and viability of cells were measured as a whole by the tetrazolium salt assay (24Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46516) Google Scholar) as previously described (17Roger S. Besson P. Le Guennec J.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1616: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Viable cell number was assessed at 570 nm (formazan absorbance) and normalized to the control condition, without TTX (on the same day of the experiment). Migration and in Vitro Invasion Assay-Migration was analyzed in 24-well plates receiving 8-μm pore size polyethylene terephtalate membrane cell culture inserts (BD Biosciences). The upper compartment was seeded with 4 × 104 cells in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. The lower compartment was filled with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, as a chemoattractant. After 24 h at 37 °C, the remaining cells were removed from the upper side of the membrane. The cells that had migrated and were attached to the lower side were stained with hematoxylin and counted in the whole insert, using a light microscope (200× magnification). In vitro invasion was assessed using the same inserts and the same protocol as above but with the membrane covered with a film of Matrigel® (extracellular-mimicking matrix; BD Biosciences). Migration and invasion assays were performed in triplicate in eight separate experiments. For easier comparison between cells lines, the results obtained for migration and invasion were normalized to the control condition. In addition, invasion experiments were repeated in Normo Na+ (155 mm) or in Low Na+ solutions (45 mm). Cell Line RNA Extraction, Reverse Transcription, Quantitative, and Conventional PCR-Total RNA extraction from MDA-MB-231 cells was performed by using RNAgents® total RNA isolation system (Promega). RNA yield and purity were determined by spectrophotometry, and only samples with an A260/A280 ratio above 1.6 were kept for further experiments. Total RNA were reverse-transcribed with the RT kits Ready-to-go® You-prime First-Strand Beads (Amersham Biosciences). Random hexamers pd(N)6 5′-Phosphate (0.2 μg; Amersham Biosciences) were added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Quantitative (real time) PCR experiments were performed with an iCycler™ system (Bio-Rad). The PCR protocol consisted of a denaturation step at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of amplification at 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 10 s. The experiments were performed in triplicate, and negative controls containing water instead of first strand cDNA were done. The results were calculated with the ΔCt method, where the parameter Ct (threshold cycle) is defined as the fractional cycle number at which the PCR reporter signal passes a fixed threshold. For each sample ΔCt values were determined by subtracting the average Ct value of the investigated transcript under control conditions (cells grown in normal culture medium) from the average Ct value of the same transcript when the cells were grown for 24 h in presence of 30 μm TTX. For conventional PCR, the temperature profile was 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles of amplification which consisted of 30 s of DNA denaturation at 94 °C, 60 s of primers hybridization at 60 °C, and 20 s of polymerization at 72 °C and a final extension for 2 min at 72 °C. PCR products were then analyzed by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and visualized by UV trans-illumination (Gel Doc 2000 system; Bio-Rad). Primers used for PCR experiments had the following sequences (expected sizes): NaV1.5, forward 5′-CACGCGTTCACTTTCCTTC-3′ and reverse 5′-CATCAGCCAGCTTCTTCACA-3′ (208 bp); β1, forward 5′-GAAAACTACGAGCACAACACCA-3′ and reverse 5′-GGCAGTATTGCTTTACCCATCA-3′ (510 bp); β2, forward 5′-TGACCCACTCTCTTCCATCC-3′ and reverse 5′-GGTCCTCTCTGAAGCCACTG-3′ (216 bp); β3, forward 5′-TCAACGTCACTCTGAACGACTC-3′ and reverse 5′-CATGTCACACTGCTCCTGTTCT-3′ (346 bp); β4, forward 5′-ACAGCAGTGACGCATTCAAG-3′ and reverse 5′-CACATGGCAGGTGTATTTGC-3′ (188 bp); CatB, forward 5′-ACAGCCCGACCTACAAACAG-3′ and reverse 5′-CCAGTAGGGTGTGCCATTCT-3′ (239 bp); CatS, forward 5′-TCTCTCAGTGCCCAGAACCT-3′ and reverse 5′-GCCACAGCTTCTTTCAGGAC-3′ (248 bp); CatK, forward 5′-CCTTGAGGCTTCTCTTGGTG-3′ and reverse 5′-GGGCTCTACCTTCCCATTCT-3′ (134 bp); CatL, forward 5′-AGGAGAGCAGTGTGGGAGAA-3′ and reverse 5′-TGGGCTTACGGTTTTGAAAG-3′ (160 bp); Cystatin C, forward 5′-GATCGTAGCTGGGGTGAACT-3′ and reverse 5′-CCTTTTCAGATGTGGCTGGT-3′ (115 bp); Cystatin M, forward 5′-CTTCCTGACGATGGAGATGG-3′ and reverse 5′-GGAACCACAAGGACCTCAAA-3′ (141 bp); and Stefin B, forward 5′-TAGGAGAGCGTGGCTGTTTT-3′ and reverse 5′-TGATGCTCCCTCTTCTGTCC-3′ (128 bp). The efficacy of the primers for NaV1.5 and β-subunits was checked in human tissues where the various isoforms are known to be expressed, i.e. in cardiac muscle for NaV1.5 and in the central nervous system for β1 to β4. siRNA Transfection Protocol-MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were transfected with siRNA directed against SCN5A mRNA (siNaV1.5) or scramble siRNA-A as a control (siCTL), which were purchased from Santa Cruz, Tebu-Bio (France). Briefly, cells in suspension were transfected with 20 nm siRNA by using Lipofectamine RNAi max (Invitrogen). The experiments (invasion assays and patch clamp) were performed 24 h after transfection. Fluorescence Measurement of Intracellular pH and Perimembrane pH-Intracellular and perimembrane pH were measured using ratiometric methods (Cairn Optoscan) with BCECF (excitation, 400/490 nm; emission, 535 nm) and fluorescein DHPE (excitation, 440/485 nm; emission, 535 nm) respectively. The cells were incubated for 45 min at room temperature in PSS containing 5 μm BCECF-AM. Perimembrane pH was monitored by incubating the cells with 1 μg/ml of fluorescein DHPE in serum-free DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C. In both cases, excess dye was removed by rinsing the cells twice with PSS. Calibration for each dye was performed by perifusing each studied cell with varying pH (pH 6.9-7.6). For determining internal pH, 0.01 mm nigericin was added to the solution. All of the data were corrected for background fluorescence. Western Blots-The specific primary antibodies were rabbit anti-human Cat B (Fitzgerald) and cathepsin S, K, and L (Calbiochem). MDA-MB-231 cells in their subconfluent state cultivated on a Matrigel® basement membrane were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were scraped and lysed in presence of radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA), containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble debris. Total proteins concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (Bio-Rad). Alternatively, culture media from cells cultivated on a Matrigel® basement membrane were centrifuged to remove floating cells and then concentrated by centrifugation with Amicon Ultra-4 columns (Millipore) at 4,000 × g for 30 min. Protein samples were diluted in the sample buffer under reducing conditions, boiled for 3 min, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar), and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After saturation for 2 h in 5% nonfat milk Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.5% Tween 20 (TTBS), the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody (1/1,000) in a 2% nonfat milk TTBS solution. The membrane was further incubated for 1 h at room temperature, with a goat anti-rabbit (1/6,000) horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). ECL (Amersham Biosciences) was used for immunodetection. Densitometric analyses were performed using QuantityOne software v4.6.3 (Bio-Rad). Cathepsin Activity Assays-After growing MDA-MB-231 cells on Matrigel®-coated flasks, total cell extracts were obtained by a series of seven freeze/thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen and a 30 °C water bath. Concentrated supernatants were prepared as described above. For the assessment of membrane-associated Cat activity, the cells were scraped in phosphate-buffered saline. A panel of AMC-derived fluorogenic substrates were used to measure proteolytic activities. The activation buffer was 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm dithiothreitol. After activation for 5 min, kinetic measurements were continuously recorded with a microtiter plate reader at 30 °C with λex = 350 nm and λem = 460 nm (Gemini spectrofluorimeter; Molecular Devices). The activities of CatB/K/L/S were measured using Z-FR-AMC (10 μm), that of CatB using Z-RR-AMC (10 μm), those of CatK/S (K > S > L) were measured using Z-LR-AMC (10 μm), and those of CatK/B (K ≫ B) were measured using Z-GPR-AMC (10 μm). Experiments with Z-FR-AMC were also performed at pH 8.0 in a Tris-HCl buffer containing 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Specificity of the Cat-dependent hydrolysis was checked by preincubation with E-64 (100 μm). Measurement of the overall Cat activity in concentrated supernatants was performed using Z-FR-AMC (25 μm) after 2 h of incubation at 30 °C at pH 5.5 in acetate buffer in presence of dextran sulfate (40 μg/ml). Total Cat were titrated by using increasing concentrations of E-64 (0-50 nm). The same experiment was repeated in the presence of CA-074 (0-25 nm) for titration of CatB. Statistical Analyses-The data are displayed as the means ± S.E. of the mean (n = number of cells/experiments). One-way analysis of variance on ranks followed by a Student-Newmann-Keul’s test were used to compare cell proliferation, migration and invasion, secretion of Cat, and intracellular and perimembrane pH in control conditions or in the presence of the different drugs and inhibitors. t tests were used to compare cell numbers, colony numbers and sizes, and the number of cells escaping from colonies. Alternatively, a Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used when the variance homogeneity test failed. Statistical significance is indicated: p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), and p < 0.001 (***). NaV1.5 Expression in Cancer Cells and Role in Invasion in Vitro-MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells express transcripts for the cardiac NaV1.5 isoform (Fig. 1A), which has been shown to be the only functional NaV α-subunit in these cells (16Fraser S.P.

Biol. 2006; 90: 299-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although it has been proposed that α-subunits alone are sufficient to form functional channels (27Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 953-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mRNA for the β1, β2, and β4 auxiliary subunits are also expressed (Fig. 1A), suggesting that a complete NaV complex could exist, made up of an α-subunit associated with multiple auxiliary β-subunits. In all studied cells, voltage-dependent sodium currents were recorded. The mean current-voltage (INa-V) relationship of the sodium current is shown on Fig. 1B (n = 80 cells). The activation threshold takes place around -60 mV, and the maximal current density, obtained from a depolarizing pulse from -100 to -10 mV, is seen at -11.29 ± 0.89 pA/pF. Conductance-voltage and availability-voltage relationships show that at voltages between -60 and -20 mV, i.e. in the range of the membrane potentials of these cells (Em = -36.8 ± 1.5 mV; n = 105 cells), NaV are partially activated and not fully inactivated (Fig. 1C). This leads to a sustained “window” inward current at -30 mV, which is inhibited by 30 μm TTX (Fig. 1D). This sustained inward current can be increased by using the sodium channel opener veratridine (Fig. 2A). Blocking the sodium current with TTX decreased the invasiveness by about 40% (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, veratridine dose-dependently enhanced the invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells. TTX, veratridine (10 and 50 μm), and a mixture of both had no effect on cancer cell migration (supplemental Fig. S1A). To validate the influence of Na+ entry on invasion through NaV, the assays were repeated with decreasing the extracellular Na+ concentration from 155 to 45 mm (Fig. 2C). This resulted in a 3-fold reduction of INa (Fig. 2C, panel a) and a slight membrane potential hyperpolarization (-4.00 ± 1.62 mV, n = 4). Reducing the Na+ concentration of the culture medium decreased invasion by ∼34%, whereas it had no effect on cell viability for 24 h and no effect on NaV1.5 expression (supplemental Fig. S2). Likewise, TTX was approximately three times less effective in reducing invasion in the Low Na+ culture medium (Fig. 2C, panel b). This highlights the crucial role of the inward sodium gradient in cell invasion. We then knocked down the expression of NaV1.5 by using a siRNA protocol (Fig. 3). The transfection of siRNA directed against NaV1.5 mRNA was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and resulted in a 65% reduction of expression compared with the transfection of siCTL (Fig. 3A). This reduction in mRNA level was associated to a ∼70% reduction of the maximal current recorded when the cells were submitted to a depolarization from -100 to -5 mV (Fig. 3B). When NaV1.5 expression was knocked down, MDA-MB-231 cells invasiveness was reduced by about 35% and was no longer significantly reduced by TTX (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 2Involvement of the sodium influx through NaV in invasion.

https://openalex.org/W2045545077,"The direction of image motion is coded by direction-selective (DS) ganglion cells in the retina. Particularly, the ON DS ganglion cells project their axons specifically to terminal nuclei of the accessory optic system (AOS) responsible for optokinetic reflex (OKR). We recently generated a knock-in mouse in which SPIG1 (SPARC-related protein containing immunoglobulin domains 1)-expressing cells are visualized with GFP, and found that retinal ganglion cells projecting to the medial terminal nucleus (MTN), the principal nucleus of the AOS, are comprised of SPIG1+ and SPIG1(-) ganglion cells distributed in distinct mosaic patterns in the retina. Here we examined light responses of these two subtypes of MTN-projecting cells by targeted electrophysiological recordings. SPIG1+ and SPIG1(-) ganglion cells respond preferentially to upward motion and downward motion, respectively, in the visual field. The direction selectivity of SPIG1+ ganglion cells develops normally in dark-reared mice. The MTN neurons are activated by optokinetic stimuli only of the vertical motion as shown by Fos expression analysis. Combination of genetic labeling and conventional retrograde labeling revealed that axons of SPIG1+ and SPIG1(-) ganglion cells project to the MTN via different pathways. The axon terminals of the two subtypes are organized into discrete clusters in the MTN. These results suggest that information about upward and downward image motion transmitted by distinct ON DS cells is separately processed in the MTN, if not independently. Our findings provide insights into the neural mechanisms of OKR, how information about the direction of image motion is deciphered by the AOS."
https://openalex.org/W2094918220,"4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE) is a pro-apoptotic electrophile generated during the spontaneous decomposition of oxidized lipids. We have previously shown that HNE activates the transcription factor, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), and promotes cytoprotective heat shock gene expression and that silencing HSF1 sensitizes the colon cancer cell line RKO to HNE-induced apoptosis. Here we report a reduction in the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-X(L), Mcl-1, and Bcl-2 in HSF1-silenced RKO cells, and we examine the underlying mechanism. To investigate the regulation of the Bcl-2 family by HSF1, microarray analysis of gene expression was performed. We observed that the Hsp70 co-chaperone, BAG3 (Bcl-2-associated athanogene domain 3), is strongly induced by HNE in control but not in HSF1-silenced colon cancer cells. Silencing BAG3 expression with small interfering RNA caused a dramatic reduction in Bcl-X(L), Mcl-1, and Bcl-2 protein levels in colon cancer cells and increased apoptosis, similar to the effect of silencing HSF1. Also, immunoprecipitation experiments indicate specific interactions between BAG3, Hsp70, and the Bcl-2 family member, Bcl-X(L). Overall, our data reveal that BAG3 is HSF1-inducible and has a unique role facilitating cancer cell survival during pro-apoptotic stress by stabilizing the level of Bcl-2 family proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1979654595,"In a substantial proportion of depressed patients, stressful life events play a role in triggering the evolution of the illness. Exposure to stress has effects on different levels in laboratory animals as well and for the rat it has been shown that chronic mild stress (CMS) can cause antidepressant-reversible depressive-like effects. The adoption of the model to the mouse seems to be problematic, depending on the strain used and behavioural endpoint defined. Our aim was to evaluate the applicability of CMS to mice in order to induce behavioural alterations suggested to reflect depression-like symptoms.A weekly CMS protocol was applied to male mice of different mouse strains (D2Ola, BL/6J and BL/6N) and its impact on stress-sensitive behavioural measures (anhedonia-, anxiety- and depression-related parameters) and body weight was assessed. Overnight illumination as commonly used stressor in CMS protocols was particularly investigated in terms of its effect on general activity and subsequently derived saccharin intake. CMS application yielded strain-dependent behavioural and physiological responses including 'paradox' anxiolytic-like effects. Overnight illumination was found to be sufficient to mimic anhedonic-like behaviour in BL/6J mice when being applied as sole stressor.The CMS procedure induced some behavioural changes that are compatible with the common expectations, i.e. 'anhedonic' behaviour, but in parallel behavioural alterations were observed which would be described as 'anomalous' (e.g. decreased anxiety). The results suggest that a shift in the pattern of circadian activity has a particular high impact on the anhedonic profile. Changes in activity in response to novelty seem to drive the 'anomalous' behavioural alterations as well."

https://openalex.org/W2024590979,"Introduction The causes of coma and death in cerebral malaria remain unknown. Malarial retinopathy has been identified as an important clinical sign in the diagnosis and prognosis of cerebral malaria. As part of a larger autopsy study to determine causes of death in children with coma presenting to hospital in Blantyre, Malawi, who were fully evaluated clinically prior to death, we examined the histopathology of eyes of patients who died and underwent autopsy. Methodology/Principal Findings Children with coma were admitted to the pediatric research ward, classified according to clinical definitions as having cerebral malaria or another cause of coma, evaluated and treated. The eyes were examined by direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy. If a child died and permission was given, a standardized autopsy was carried out. The patient was then assigned an actual cause of death according to the autopsy findings. The eyes were examined pathologically for hemorrhages, cystoid macular edema, parasite sequestration and thrombi. They were stained immunohistochemically for fibrin and CD61 to identify the components of thrombi, β-amyloid precursor protein to detect axonal damage, for fibrinogen to identify vascular leakage and for glial fibrillary acidic protein to detect gliosis. Sixty-four eyes from 64 patients were examined: 35 with cerebral malaria and 29 with comas of other causes. Cerebral malaria was distinguished by sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes, the presence and severity of retinal hemorrhages, the presence of cystoid macular edema, the occurrence and number of fibrin-platelet thrombi, the presence and amount of axonal damage and vascular leakage. Conclusions/Significance We found significant differences in retinal histopathology between patients who died of cerebral malaria and those with other diagnoses. These histopathological findings offer insights into the etiology of malarial retinopathy and provide a pathological basis for recently described retinal capillary non-perfusion in children with malarial retinopathy. Because of the similarities between the retina and the brain it also suggests mechanisms that may contribute to coma and death in cerebral malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2019618509,"Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a premature aging condition characterized by sensitivity to UV radiation. However, this phenotype does not explain the progressive neurodegeneration in CS patients. It could be due to the hypersensitivity of CSB-deficient cells to oxidative stress. So far most studies on the role of CSB in repair of oxidatively induced DNA lesions have focused on 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine. This study examines the role of CSB in the repair of formamidopyrimidines 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyGua) and 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyAde), which are substrates for endonuclease VIII-like (NEIL1) DNA glycosylase. Results presented here show that csb(-/-) mice have a higher level of endogenous FapyAde and FapyGua in DNA from brain and kidney than wild type mice as well as higher levels of endogenous FapyAde in genomic DNA and mtDNA from liver. In addition, CSB stimulates NEIL1 incision activity in vitro, and CSB and NEIL1 co-immunoprecipitate and co-localize in HeLa cells. When CSB and NEIL1 are depleted from HeLa cells by short hairpin RNA knockdown, repair of induced FapyGua is strongly inhibited. These results suggest that CSB plays a role in repair of formamidopyrimidines, possibly by interacting with and stimulating NEIL1, and that accumulation of such modifications may have a causal role in the pathogenesis of CS."
https://openalex.org/W2166083626,"Rhodopsin is a highly specialized G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is activated by the rapid photochemical isomerization of its covalently bound 11-cis-retinal chromophore. Using two-dimensional solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we defined the position of the retinal in the active metarhodopsin II intermediate. Distance constraints were obtained between amino acids in the retinal binding site and specific 13C-labeled sites located on the β-ionone ring, polyene chain, and Schiff base end of the retinal. We show that the retinal C20 methyl group rotates toward the second extracellular loop (EL2), which forms a cap on the retinal binding site in the inactive receptor. Despite the trajectory of the methyl group, we observed an increase in the C20-Gly188 (EL2) distance consistent with an increase in separation between the retinal and EL2 upon activation. NMR distance constraints showed that the β-ionone ring moves to a position between Met207 and Phe208 on transmembrane helix H5. Movement of the ring toward H5 was also reflected in increased separation between the C∈ carbons of Lys296 (H7) and Met44 (H1) and between Gly121 (H3) and the retinal C18 methyl group. Helix-helix interactions involving the H3-H5 and H4-H5 interfaces were also found to change in the formation of metarhodopsin II reflecting increased retinal-protein interactions in the region of Glu122 (H3) and His211 (H5).

The first step in the activation mechanism of most G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; DARR, dipolar assisted rotational resonance; EL2, second extracellular loop; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; MAS, magic angle spinning; MD, molecular dynamics; Meta, metarhodopsin; ROS, rod outer segment; 2D, two-dimensional. is the binding of a signaling ligand. Ligand binding to the extracellular loops or within the transmembrane helical bundle of these receptors leads to an allosteric conformational change that causes G protein activation. The detailed location of the activating ligand and the conformational changes triggered by ligand binding are still not well established for any GPCR. The visual photoreceptor rhodopsin is a member of the large family of class A GPCRs (1Menon S.T. Han M. Sakmar T.P. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These receptors have a common architecture consisting of seven-transmembrane α-helices. Activation of rhodopsin begins with the absorption of light by the photoreactive 11-cis-retinal chromophore. The retinal is covalently bound as a protonated Schiff base to Lys296 and tightly packed within the bundle of helices (Fig. 1, B and C). The retinal binding site is restricted along the axis of the retinal polyene chain by transmembrane helices H5 and H7 and is enclosed on the extracellular side of the dark, inactive state of rhodopsin by the second extracellular (or intradiscal) loop (EL2). The retinal binding site in the inactive state of rhodopsin can accommodate the 7-cis,9-cis, and 11-cis isomers of retinal but not the longer all-trans or 13-cis isomers (2Matsumoto H. Yoshizawa T. Vision Res. 1978; 18: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Within this restricted space, the rapid 11-cis-to-all-trans isomerization of the retinal upon absorption of light triggers receptor activation. The question of how the absorbed light energy leads to structural changes within the rhodopsin protein has not been fully answered since Hubbard and Wald (3Hubbard R. Wald G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1952; 36: 269-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) first established that the retinal undergoes a large conformational change upon light absorption. Calorimetric studies have shown that 35 kcal/mol of the absorbed light energy is stored in bathorhodopsin, the first relatively long-lived intermediate (4Cooper A. Nature. 1979; 282: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Resonance Raman spectra of bathorhodopsin exhibit intense hydrogen out-of-plane modes indicating that the retinal is conformationally distorted (5Eyring G. Curry B. Broek A. Lugtenburg J. Mathies R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) due to the rapid change in chromophore structure from 11-cis to all-trans within a highly constrained binding site. There have been many detailed proposals for how the energy stored in bathorhodopsin is released during the thermal decay to metarhodopsin II (Meta II). 4Unless otherwise stated, the inactive, dark state of rhodopsin is referred to simply as rhodopsin, and the active intermediate is referred to as metarhodopsin II (or Meta II). Volumetric measurements show that there is an increase in the overall volume of the protein upon activation (6Marr K. Peters K.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 20: 1254-1258Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Strassburger J.M. Gärtner W. Braslavsky S.E. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2294-2303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), implying that retinal isomerization leads to rearrangement of the transmembrane helices. Site-directed spin labeling and EPR measurements show that the cytoplasmic end of H6 undergoes an outward rotation upon activation (8Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 9Altenbach C. Kusnetzow A.K. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). These studies are consistent with models in which the retinal moves toward and contacts H6, placing the β-ionone ring in the H5-H6 interface. Analysis of helix-helix packing in rhodopsin indicates that the H5-H6 interface is the most loosely packed in rhodopsin (10Liu W. Eilers M. Patel A.B. Smith S.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 713-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and may provide a low energy path for the retinal to enter/exit the retinal binding site. In fact, a recent crystal structure of opsin lacking the retinal chromophore reveals an opening in the H5-H6 interface (11Park J.H. Scheerer P. Hofmann K.P. Choe H.W. Ernst O.P. Nature. 2008; 454: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). In contrast to the idea that the retinal moves toward H6 following isomerization, studies using retinal analogs that can cross-link to the protein in the dark or following photoreaction place the ionone ring in the H4-H5 interface in Meta II. Specifically, Nakanishi and colleagues (12Borhan B. Souto M.L. Imai H. Shichida Y. Nakanishi K. Science. 2000; 288: 2209-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) found a cross-link between the β-ionone ring of retinal and Ala169 on helix H4 after illumination. Because Ala169 is on the lipid-facing surface of H4, it has been noted that a straight line drawn between Lys296 and Ala169 passes through helix H3, suggesting that this helix must consequently move upon activation (13Meng E.C. Bourne H.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 587-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Additionally, a comparison of the recent 2.6 Å crystal structure of lumirhodopsin with the structure of rhodopsin reveals differences in the middle of H3 (14Nakamichi H. Okada T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12729-12734Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). There are also proposals that the β-ionone ring does not change position upon formation of Meta II. Watts and co-workers (15Spooner P.J.R. Sharples J.M. Goodall S.C. Bovee-Geurts P.H.M. Verhoeven M.A. Lugtenburg J. Pistorius A.M.A. DeGrip W.J. Watts A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) argued that the β-ionone ring anchors the retinal in position and that retinal isomerization leads to motion of H6 by inducing changes in the dihedral angles of Tyr268 and Ala269. Also, in a low-resolution crystal structure of a rhodopsin photointermediate having an unprotonated Schiff base (16Salom D. Lodowski D.T. Stenkamp R.E. Le Trong I. Golczak M. Jastrzebska B. Harris T. Ballesteros J.A. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16123-16128Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), only minimal structural changes were observed relative to rhodopsin on the extracellular side of the receptor. Both models suggest that the energy stored in bathorhodopsin is largely dissipated by structural changes in helix H6 and the cytoplasmic loops. We have previously presented solid-state NMR measurements of rhodopsin showing that there is movement of the retinal toward H5 in Meta II (17Patel A.B. Crocker E. Eilers M. Hirshfeld A. Sheves M. Smith S.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10048-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this study (17Patel A.B. Crocker E. Eilers M. Hirshfeld A. Sheves M. Smith S.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10048-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the retinal was labeled with 13C at the C19 and C20 methyl groups and at the C14 and C15 carbons of the polyene chain close to the retinal protonated Schiff base linkage with Lys296. These measurements reported only on the position of the retinal methyl groups and the region of the retinal near the Schiff base and, consequently, provided only weak constraints on the final position of the β-ionone ring relative to helix H5. As a result, it was not possible to distinguish between different models that had previously been proposed for the location of the retinal in Meta II. Here, we have extended our solid-state NMR studies on rhodopsin 4Unless otherwise stated, the inactive, dark state of rhodopsin is referred to simply as rhodopsin, and the active intermediate is referred to as metarhodopsin II (or Meta II). and Meta II using retinals isotopically 13C-labeled on the retinal chain (C7, C12, C19, C20) and the β-ionone ring (C5, C6, C16, C17, and C18). These retinals are incorporated into rhodopsin containing 13C labels on different amino acids (methionine, histidine, glycine, cysteine, lysine, tyrosine, tryptophan, threonine, and phenylalanine) to define the location of the retinal in the activated Meta II intermediate. High-resolution structural constraints on rhodopsin and Meta II were established using the two-dimensional (2D) dipolar-assisted rotational resonance (DARR) NMR experiment. This approach enabled us to obtain multiple constraints by measurement of long-range 13C... 13C through-space correlations between unique 13C labels. On the basis of the structural changes observed upon Meta II formation, a mechanism for the activation of rhodopsin, as well as other class A GPCRs, is proposed that involves the concerted motion of helices H5, H6, and H7 through the coupling between conserved microdomains (18Ballesteros J.

Virology. 1959; 8: 396-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) prepared from cell culture-tested components (Sigma). Fetal bovine serum was heat-inactivated before its addition to the growth medium. For suspension growth, the medium was supplemented with specific 13C-labeled amino acids (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA), dialyzed fetal bovine serum (10%), Pluronic F-68 (0.1%), dextran sulfate (300 mg/liter), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (23Eilers M.

The opsin gene expression was induced by addition of 2 mg/liter tetracycline and 5 mm sodium butyrate on day 5 after inoculation (20Reeves P.J. Kim J.M. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13413-13418Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and cells were harvested on day 7. The HEK293S cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (40 ml/liter cell culture plus protease inhibitors) (21Reeves P.J. Thurmond R.L. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11487-11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and unlabeled 11-cis-retinal was added in two steps to a final concentration of 15 μm. The cells (40 ml/liter of cell culture) were solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline buffer plus 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) at room temperature for 4 h. Subsequent immunoaffinity chromatography purification was carried out using the rho-1D4 antibody (National Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN) as described previously (21Reeves P.J. Thurmond R.L. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11487-11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Column fractions containing rhodopsin were concentrated (∼0.4-0.6 mm) to a final volume of ∼400 μl using Centricon cones (Amicon, Bedford, MA) with a 10-kDa cutoff. Synthesis of 13C-Labeled Retinals and Regeneration into Rhodopsin-Synthetic retinals with specific 13C labels were produced by standard methods (25Lugtenburg J. Pure Appl. Chem. 1985; 57: 753-762Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and purified as described previously (23Eilers M. Reeves P.J. Ying W.W. Khorana H.G. Smith S.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin pigments in DDM micelles were regenerated by illuminating concentrated samples of a 2:1 molar ratio of 13C-labeled retinal-to-protein as discussed previously (17Patel A.B. Crocker E. Eilers M. Hirshfeld A. Sheves M. Smith S.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10048-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and concentrated to a volume of 60 μl or less by evaporation using a stream of argon gas. Solid-state NMR Spectroscopy-Solid-state NMR experiments on 7-10 mg of 13C-labeled rhodopsin were performed at 14.1 teslas (600 MHz 1H frequency) on a Bruker Avance spectrometer using 4-mm magic angle spinning (MAS) probes as described previously (26Crocker E. Eilers M. Ahuja S. Hornak V. Hirshfeld A. Sheves M. Smith S.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). One-dimensional 13C NMR spectra were collected at MAS spinning rates between 8 and 12 kHz using ramped amplitude cross-polarization (27Metz G. Wu X. Smith S.O. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1994; 110: 219-227Crossref Scopus (1047) Google Scholar) with contact times of 2 ms in all experiments. 2D 13C DARR NMR measurements (28Takegoshi K. Nakamura S. Terao T. Chem. Phys. Lett. 2001; 344: 631-637Crossref Scopus (801) Google Scholar) were performed with 1024 points in the direct (f2) dimension and 64 points in the indirect (f1) dimension as described previously (26Crocker E. Eilers M. Ahuja S. Hornak V. Hirshfeld A. Sheves M. Smith S.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A DARR mixing time of 600 ms was used to maximize homonuclear recoupling (29Crocker E. Patel A.B. Eilers M. Jayaraman S. Getmanova E. Reeves P.J. Ziliox M. Khorana H.G. Sheves M. Smith S.O. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 29: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The 1H radiofrequency field strength during the mixing period was matched to the MAS speed for each sample, satisfying the n = 1 matching condition. Two-pulse phase-modulated proton decoupling (30Bennett A.E. Rienstra C.M. Auger M. Lakshmi K.V. Griffin R.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 6951-6958Crossref Scopus (1993) Google Scholar) or SPINAL64 proton decoupling (31Fung B.M. Khitrin A.K. Ermolaev K. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 142: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar) was used during the acquisition and evolution periods. The decoupling field strengths were typically 80-90 kHz. To obtain the observed signal-to-noise ratios for each data set discussed below, a 2D spectrum typically required a week of signal averaging, which is approximately equal to 5120 scans for each of the 64 rows in the f1 dimension of the 2D spectrum. The carbonyl resonance of powdered glycine at 176.46 ppm relative to tetramethylsilane was used as an external 13C reference. All experiments were conducted at -80 °C. Trapping of the Metarhodopsin II Intermediate-Upon light activation of rhodopsin, the active Meta II intermediate is formed within milliseconds in rod outer segment (ROS) membranes and decays with a half-time of ∼10 min at pH 6.0 and 20 °C (32Heck M. Schädel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3162-3169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Lowering the temperature to -80 °C blocks the decay of the Meta II intermediate; this is essential for the long periods of data acquisition required for the 2D NMR experiments. However, in ROS or model membranes one typically obtains a mixture of Meta I and Meta II after photoreaction of the retinal and low temperature trapping. To quantitatively (>85%) trap the sample in the Meta II intermediate, we solubilized rhodopsin in DDM detergent. Samples were irradiated for 45-60 s at room temperature in the NMR rotor using a 400-watt lamp equipped with a >495 nm long pass filter and immediately put in the NMR probe with the probe stator warmed to 5 °C. Under slow spinning (∼2 kHz) the sample was frozen within 3 min of illumination using N2 gas cooled to -80 °C (17Patel A.B. Crocker E. Eilers M. Hirshfeld A. Sheves M. Smith S.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10048-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To confirm that we had trapped Meta II and completely converted the sample from rhodopsin and Meta I, we monitored the chemical shift changes of the 13C labels of the retinal that are sensitive to the protonation state of the Schiff base nitrogen and the configuration of the C11=C12 double bond. Meta II is the only intermediate with an all-trans-retinal and an unprotonated Schiff base. We observed no residual rhodopsin or Meta I after illumination and typically were able to trap >85% of our original sample in the Meta II state based on integration of the retinal 13C resonances in rhodopsin and Meta II (17Patel A.B. Crocker E. Eilers M. Hirshfeld A. Sheves M. Smith S.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10048-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The line widths of the resolved protein and retinal NMR resonances are generally between 1 and 2 ppm in both rhodopsin and Meta II. The absence of line broadening or resonance splitting indicated that we had trapped a spectroscopically well defined Meta II state. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and 2H NMR measurements on rhodopsin have suggested that there are two major conformations of the β-ionone ring, one with a positively twisted C6-C7 single bond and one with a negatively twisted C6-C7 single bond (33Salgado G.F.J. Struts A.V. Tanaka K. Fujioka N. Nakanishi K. Brown M.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12819-12828Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 34Lau P.W. Grossfield A. Feller S.E. Pitman M.C. Brown M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 906-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As described below, 13C chemical shift and DARR NMR measurements suggest that, predominantly, a single conformation exists in rhodopsin and in Meta II. Meta II in DDM has been found to be functionally equivalent to Meta II in ROS membranes as it can activate transducin (35Franke R.R. Sakmar T.P. Graham R.M. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14767-14774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Han M. Groesbeek M. Smith S.O. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Also, it has been shown that the vibrational frequencies observed in the Fourier transform infrared difference spectrum of Meta II minus rhodopsin are identical for rhodopsin in DDM and ROS membranes (37Fahmy K. Jäger F. Beck M. Zvyaga T.A. Sakmar T.P. Siebert F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10206-10210Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 38Beck M. Siebert F. Sakmar T.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mean half-time for proton uptake of Meta II in DDM is 25 ms (39Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7849-7853Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the time between illumination and freezing of the sample is ∼3 min, indicating that the proton uptake in our sample is complete and that we were observing the form of Meta II that activates transducin. Location of the β-Ionone Ring Relative to H5 in Metarhodopsin II-Our previous solid-state NMR studies concluded that the retinal moves toward H5 in the rhodopsin-to-Meta II transition (17Patel A.B. Crocker E. Eilers M. Hirshfeld A. Sheves M. Smith S.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10048-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We sought to establish whether the β-ionone ring increases its contact with H5 by targeting the terminal ∈-methyl group of Met207, which is on the face of H5 oriented toward the β-ionone ring of the retinal. For these experiments, rhodopsin containing 13C∈-labeled methionine was regenerated with 11-cis-retinal labeled with 13C at the C6 and C7 carbons (Fig. 1A). Fig. 2A presents the 2D DARR NMR spectra of rhodopsin showing only the region containing cross-peaks between the 13C6 and 13C7 retinal resonances and the 13C∈ resonance of methionine. The rhodopsin spectrum (Fig. 2A, black) exhibits a weak cross-peak between the 13C7 resonance of the retinal chromophore and Met207 (14.7 ppm). The weak intensity of the Met207-C7 cross-peak (Fig. 2A) is consistent with the separation of 4.9 Å observed in the rhodopsin crystal structure (40Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). No cross-peaks are observed between the 13C∈ resonance of Met207 and the 13C6 resonance of the retinal; the 5.4 Å distance between these 13C labels is near the upper limit of the distance range of the DARR experiment (29Crocker E. Patel A.B. Eilers M. Jayaraman S. Getmanova E. Reeves P.J. Ziliox M. Khorana H.G. Sheves M. Smith S.O. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 29: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Upon conversion to Meta II (Fig. 2A, red) both the 13C6 and 13C7 resonances exhibit strong cross-peaks with the 13C∈-labeled Met207 resonance at 13.8 ppm. The intensity of the Meta II cross-peaks indicates that the C6 and C7 carbons are in van der Waals contact with Met207. NMR measurements were also made on rhodopsin containing [13C∈]methionine and regenerated with 13C5,13C18-labeled retinal. In the DARR NMR spectra of rhodopsin, cross-peaks were not observed between Met207 and either the 13C5 or 13C18 resonances of the retinal β-ionone ring. In the rhodopsin crystal structure (40Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar), the Met207(C∈)-retinal C5 (6.7 Å) and the Met207(C∈)-retinal C18 (7.7 Å) distances are outside the range of the DARR NMR experiment. However, upon conversion to Meta II, we observed strong cross-peaks between Met207 and both the 13C5 and 13C18 resonances on the β-ionone ring (Fig. 2B, red). The Met207-C5/C6/C7/C18 contacts are consistent with our previous observation of movement of the retinal toward H5 (17Patel A.B. Crocker E. Eilers M. Hirshfeld A. Sheves M. Smith S.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10048-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, the data do not tightly constrain the location of the ionone ring relative to H5 because of the flexibility of the long methionine side chain. To better establish the position of the ionone ring relative to H5 in Meta II, additional 13C-13C recoupling experiments involving the retinal and several amino acids in the H4-H5 and H5-H6 interfaces were undertaken. To address the trajectory of the retinal suggested by retinal cross-linking to Ala169 on helix H4 (12Borhan B. Souto M.L. Imai H. Shichida Y. Nakanishi K. Science. 2000; 288: 2209-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), we obtained 2D DARR NMR spectra of rhodopsin 13C-labeled at the Cβ carbon of Cys167 and at the C5, C6, and C7 carbons of retinal. On the basis of molecular modeling of the retinal binding site, Cys167 should be in close proximity to one of these carbons if the retinal adopts the position in the H4-H5 interface suggested by cross-linking to Ala169. In rhodopsin, the β-carbon of Cys167 and the C5-C7 carbons are separated by >7.8 Å. In the 2D DARR NMR spectrum of rhodopsin, no cysteine-retinal cross-peaks were observed (data not shown). Similarly, in the 2D DARR NMR spectrum of Meta II we were unable to detect cysteine-retinal cross-peaks, arguing that the retinal C5-C7 carbons are more than 6 Å from the β carbon of Cys167 (data not shown). To observe contacts between the retinal chromophore and phenylalanine in the H5-H6 interface, we 13C-labeled the C16 and C17 methyl groups on the retinal β-ionone ring, as well as the ring carbons of phenylalanine. The 13C resonances of the aromatic ring of phenylalanine at 120-145 ppm are well resolved from the 13C resonances of the C16 and C17 retinal methyl groups between 25 and 33 ppm. Fig. 3A presents the one-dimensional MAS difference spectrum between rhodopsin (positive) and Meta II (negative) in the region of the retinal methyl resonances. The positive peaks at 30.6 and 26.1 ppm have previously been assigned to the 13C16 and 13C17 resonances in rhodopsin (41Creemers A.F.L. Kiihne S. Bovee-Geurts P.H.M. DeGrip W.J. Lugtenburg J. de Groot H.J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9101-9106Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), respectively. On the basis of IUPAC nomenclature, the C1-C16 bond is oriented into the plane of page in Fig. 1A, whereas the C1-C17 bond is oriented out of the plane of the page. The difference between the 13C chemical shifts (4.5 ppm) of the C16 and C17 resonances is attributed to one methyl group being in an equatorial orientation and the other methyl group being in an axial orientation. A steric contact between the methyl group in the axial orientation and the proton on C3 of the β-ionone ring results in an upfield chemical shift (41Creemers A.F.L. Kiihne S. Bovee-Geurts P.H.M. DeGrip W.J. Lugtenburg J. de Groot H.J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9101-9106Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 42Spooner P.J.R. Sharples J.M. Verhoeven M.A. Lugtenburg J. Glaubitz C. Watts A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7549-7555Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The negative peaks at 28.6 and 33.4 ppm correspond to the chemical shifts of the C16 and C17 methyl groups in Meta II, respectively (data not shown). The difference in chemical shift (4.8 ppm) between the 13C16 and 13C17 resonances is again consistent with a difference in the relative orientation of the methyl groups. However, the shift of C16 from 30.6 to 28.6 ppm and of C17 from 26.1 to 33.4 ppm indicates that C16 has now moved to the axial position in Meta II. Fig. 3, B and C, presents rows e"

Integrin activation has been shown to involve binding of the talin FERM domain to membrane proximal sequences in the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin β-subunit. However, a second integrin-binding site (IBS2) has been identified near the C-terminal end of the talin rod. Here we report the crystal structure of IBS2 (residues 1974-2293), which comprises two five-helix bundles, “IBS2-A” (1974-2139) and “IBS2-B” (2140-2293), connected by a continuous helix with a distinct kink at its center that is stabilized by side-chain H-bonding. Solution studies using small angle x-ray scattering and NMR point to a fairly flexible quaternary organization. Using pull-down and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, we demonstrate that integrin binding requires both IBS2 domains, as does binding to acidic phospholipids and robust targeting to focal adhesions. We have defined the membrane proximal region of the integrin cytoplasmic domain as the major binding region, although more membrane distal regions are also required for strong binding. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis points to an important electrostatic component to binding.

Talin (∼270 kDa) is one of a number of adaptor proteins (including α-actinin, filamin, tensin, ILK, skelemin, and melusin) that couple the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules to the actin cytoskeleton (1Critchley D.R. Gingras A.R. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1345-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, it appears thus far to be unique in providing the necessary final step to integrin (“inside-out”) activation. Talin is composed of a head region (residues 1-400) containing an extended FERM domain, a linker region (residues 401-481) of unknown structure, and finally a long helical rod (residues 482-2541), in which ∼62 α-helices are organized into a tandem series of ∼12-13 mostly 5-helix bundles (2McLachlan A.D.

The C-terminal helix is a principal mediator of talin dimerization, forming an antiparallel 2-helix coiled-coil (Fig. 1). The FERM subdomain F3 has a phosphotyrosine-binding domain-like fold (4Garcia-Alvarez B. de Pereda J.M. Calderwood D.A. Ulmer T.S. Critchley D. Campbell I.D. Ginsberg M.H. Liddington R.C. Mol.

In the first step of activation, F3 makes critical interactions with the “mid-section” of the integrin tail, comprising a WXXXXNPLYXXA motif (residues 739-752 in β3). Trp-739 (it is Phe in integrin β2) inserts its side chain into a well defined hydrophobic pocket made up of residues Arg-358, Ala-360, and Tyr-377 near to the membrane-proximal surface of F3, whereas the NPXY motif forms a helical turn that nestles into a shallow groove at the membrane distal end of the F3 subdomain; the intervening residues form β-sheet interactions with the edge of the β6-strand of F3. In the second step, F3 engages the membrane-proximal helix of the β-integrin as well as the membrane itself. This is believed to cause the separation of the α- and β-integrins tails, which releases the quaternary constraints that hold the integrin in its low affinity conformation. This sets in motion or potentiates conformational changes that are transduced across the plasma membrane to the extracellular domains, promoting high affinity binding to matrix proteins or counter-receptors on other cells (6Calderwood D.A.

Consistent with this two-step model, talin mutants that bind normally to the integrin mid-section of the β-integrin tail but are defective in binding either to the membrane-proximal helix, or the membrane itself, have a dominant-negative phenotype. Other cell adhesion molecules bind competitively to the region in F3 where it engages the mid-section of integrin tails, utilizing variants on the integrin motif. Such molecules include the phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase-type 1γ, which engages via a C-terminal motif (WVYSPLH) (8Barsukov I.L. Prescot A. Bate N. Patel B. Floyd D.N. Bhanji N. Bagshaw C.R.

Interestingly, the talin rod contains a binding site for the muscle-specific intermediate filament protein α-synemin (20Sun N. Critchley D.R. Paulin D. Li Z. Robson R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1839-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), thus providing a potential link between integrin-talin-actin complexes and the intermediate filament network. Evidence has also slowly accumulated for the existence of an additional integrin-binding site, IBS2, 2The abbreviations used are: IBS2, integrin-binding site 2; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SeMet, selenomethionine; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; Vd1, vinculin d1 domain; FA, focal adhesion; Fmoc, 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl. in the talin rod. Initial indications that the rod contained such a site came from gel filtration studies (21Horwitz A. Duggan K. Buck C. Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. Nature. 1986; 320: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). More recently, Xing et al. (22Xing B. Jedsadayanmata A. Lam S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44373-44378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) showed that purified rod captured in microtiter wells bound αIIbβ3 integrin in a dose-dependent manner and that an antibody to the talin rod blocked αIIbβ3 binding to intact talin by only ∼50%. Moreover, αIIbβ3 integrin bound to a recombinant talin fragment from the C-terminal region of the rod (residues 1984-2541) but not to an N-terminal rod fragment (434-1975). Surface plasmon resonance studies also showed that the talin rod bound to β3-integrin tails, although the affinity was ∼40-fold weaker than that of the talin head (23Yan B. Calderwood D.A. Yaspan B. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28164-28170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Tremuth et al. (24Tremuth L. Kreis S. Melchior C. Hoebeke J. Ronde P. Plancon S. Takeda K. Kieffer N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22258-22266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) further localized the binding site in the rod to residues 1984-2113, using a combination of pulldown and surface plasmon resonance assays. They also reported that binding was inhibited by a mutation of the integrin NPXY motif (Y → A), as observed for the talin head. Subsequently, Moes et al. (25Moes M. Rodius S. Coleman S.J. Monkley S.J. Goormaghtigh E. Tremuth L. Kox C. van der Holst P.P. Critchley D.R. Kieffer N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17280-17288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) identified a 42-residue talin fragment (residues 2072-2113) that co-localized with integrin in focal adhesions, and a 23-residue peptide (residues 2077-2099) that bound GST-β3 integrin tails in a blot assay. However, none of these rod fragments was able to activate integrin when transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells. Further evidence in support of a second integrin-binding site in talin has come from elegant studies in Drosophila (26Tanentzapf G. Brown N.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As predicted, an Arg-367 → Ala mutation in the Drosophila talin FERM F3 domain (equivalent to mouse Arg-358) abrogated recruitment of the talin head to integrin-containing muscle attachment sites; furthermore, a full-length talin R367A mutant was unable to support the development of talin-null embryos to adulthood. However, the R367A mutant was able to partially rescue the talin-null phenotype in adult flies. Similarly, in embryos, the R367A mutant rescued the talin-null phenotype in various tissues, including muscle, and was recruited to integrin-containing junctions. However, close analysis showed that the muscle ends had pulled away from their matrix attachment sites, indicating a reduction in adhesion strength. It is well established that both the affinity of individual integrins and the avidity of clustered integrins for matrix proteins contribute to the overall strength of adhesion. The observations can therefore be rationalized by postulating that, although the Drosophila R367A mutant is unable to induce affinity changes, it retains the ability to support integrin clustering at cell-matrix junctions. The authors of this work suggested a model in which the talin head and rod serve distinct functions: the head converts integrins to the high affinity state, while the rod contributes to integrin clustering via its IBS2 function (26Tanentzapf G. Brown N.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We have previously determined the structures of the two domains flanking IBS2, the “VBS3” domain, residues 1843-1973 (27Gingras A.R. Vogel K.P. Steinhoff H.J. Ziegler W.H. Patel B. Emsley J. Critchley D.R. Roberts G.C. Barsukov I.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1805-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal actin-binding module, residues 2300-2482 (16Gingras A.R. Bate N. Goult B.T. Hazelwood L. Canestrelli I. Grossmann J.G. Liu H. Putz N.S. Roberts G.C. Volkmann N. Hanein D. Barsukov I.L. Critchley D.R. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Here we describe the structure of the intervening fragment (1974-2293) comprising IBS2. The structure reveals a tandem pair of five-helix bundles forming a functional module. The N-terminal bundle has been implicated in integrin binding (24Tremuth L. Kreis S. Melchior C. Hoebeke J. Ronde P. Plancon S. Takeda K. Kieffer N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22258-22266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Moes M. Rodius S. Coleman S.J. Monkley S.J. Goormaghtigh E. Tremuth L. Kox C. van der Holst P.P. Critchley D.R. Kieffer N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17280-17288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), but we show that both domains are required for high affinity binding. Moreover, both domains of the module are required for focal adhesion localization and for binding to acidic phospholipids. We map the regions of the β-integrin tail critical for IBS2 binding and show that both membrane-proximal and -distal interactions are required for high affinity binding. Together, these results suggest that the two major integrin-binding sites on talin share many common features but have distinct functions. Protein Expression and Purification-The cDNAs encoding murine talin residues 1974-2293, 1974-2140, and 2137-2293 were synthesized by PCR using a mouse talin1 cDNA as template and cloned into expression vector pET-151/d-TOPO (Invitrogen). Constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 Star (DE3), cultured either in LB or, for preparation of 15N-labeled samples for NMR, in minimal media containing 1 g of 15N-ammonium chloride per liter. Recombinant His-tagged talin 1974-2293 was expressed in E. coli B834 strain for selenomethionine (SeMet) incorporation, and cultured in appropriate minimal media. Recombinant His-tagged talin polypeptides were purified by nickel-affinity chromatography following standard procedures. The His tag was removed by cleavage with AcTEV protease (Invitrogen), and the protein was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography. Recombinant His-tagged chicken vinculin domain 1 (residues 1-258) was expressed using a pET-15b expression plasmid and purified as described previously (28Papagrigoriou E. Gingras A.R. Barsukov I.L. Bate N. Fillingham I.J. Patel B. Frank R. Ziegler W.H. Roberts G.C. Critchley D.R. Emsley J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2942-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The concentration of purified proteins was determined using the CB-Protein Assay (Calbiochem). X-ray Crystallography-Crystals of talin residues 1974-2293 were obtained at 19 °C by vapor diffusion equilibration against 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm HEPES, 1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 10 mm sodium thiocyanate at pH 7.5. Protein at 5.0 mg/ml in 0.2 m NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was mixed with an equal volume of precipitant. Crystals adopt space group P21, but two distinct forms were observed. Native protein yielded Form 1 crystals, with 1 molecule per asymmetric unit, whereas SeMet crystals yielded Form 2 crystals containing 2 molecules per asymmetric unit (see Table 1), with solvent contents of 47% and 45%, respectively. The two forms are closely related in their crystal packing, but there is a near doubling of the c-axis in Form 2 to accommodate the second molecule.TABLE 1Summary of crystallographic analysis and refinement statistics for talin residues 1974-2293Data collectionSpace groupP21P21Cell dimensionsa = 59.4a = 58.7 Åb = 57.1 Åb = 57.6 Åc = 92.1 Åc = 92.6 Åβ = 102.8°β = 103.0°No. of molecules in asymmetric unit22Data setPeakHigh resolutionWavelength (Å)0.97910.9757Resolution (Å)20-2.520-1.85Measured reflections154011559438Unique reflections4032752439Completeness (%)99.8 (99.5)98.1 (87.5)Rsym9.0 (30.6)8.5 (44.9)I/σI12.8 (5.7)16.8 (1.7)Refinement statisticsResolution range (Å)20-1.85Unique reflections (free)49457Rwork (%)21.4 (29.0)Rfree (%)26.0 (41.0)Number of residues/atoms632/5010Number of solvent molecules332Average B value (Å2)31r.m.s.d. bond length (Å)0.016r.m.s.d. bond angles (Å)1.45 Open table in a new tab Diffraction data were collected from native crystals (Form 1) at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline ID23-1, and from SeMet crystal (Form 2) at beamline 14-4, recorded on ADSC Q315R charge-coupled device detectors. Data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W.J. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1997: 849-861Google Scholar). Phases were determined from the anomalous data collected at the selenium absorption peak (λ = 0.9791) from SeMet Form 2 crystals. 10 of the 12 possible selenium atoms were located (6 per molecule), and a map was constructed using these preliminary phases at 2.5-Å resolution. An initial atomic model was built using SOLVE/RESOLVE (30Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar), and, following phase improvement with DM (31Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar), the model was rebuilt manually with Coot (32Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar) and refined using maximum likelihood refinement in Refmac5 (33Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13854) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the structure was refined against a new 1.85-Å data set collected from Form 2 SeMet crystals. The final model converged to an RWORK of 21.4% for all data between 20 and 1.85 Å, and an Rfree of 26.0%. The final Ramachandran plot shows 96.9% of residues in favored regions, 2.8% in additional favored regions, and 0.2% in generously allowed regions, as defined by PROCHECK (34Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). The structure has been submitted to the Protein Data Bank with the accession number 3dyj (www.rcsb.org). The figures were generated with CCP4mg (35Potterton E. McNicholas S. Krissinel E. Cowtan K. Noble M. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1955-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The Form 1 native crystals did not diffract as well as the SeMet derivatives, and the data were partially refined to an Rfree of 23.7%. Gel Filtration and Proteolysis-Analytical gel filtration chromatography of recombinant talin fragments 1974-2293, 1974-2140, and 2137-2293, as well as vinculin Vd1-(1-258), was performed using Superdex-75 (10/300) GL (Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature. The proteins were mixed and incubated at various temperatures for 30 min prior to loading onto the column, which was pre-equilibrated with and run with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. All proteolysis experiments were carried out at 20 °C for 1 h using a 1:50 (w/w) trypsin:protein ratio. The buffer was 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. SAXS-Small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments were carried out at station 2.1 of the U.K. Synchrotron Radiation Source at Daresbury, using a multiwire gas detector covering a momentum-transfer range of 0.02 Å-1 < q < 0.70 Å-1, where q = 4π sin Θ/λ (2Θ is the scattering angle and λ the x-ray wavelength, 1.54 Å). Measurements on talin 1974-2293 were performed at 4 °C at concentrations of 2 and 10 mg/ml in a buffer comprising 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Experimental data were accumulated in 60-s frames, and, before averaging, frames were inspected for x-ray-induced damage or aggregation. The background was subtracted using the scattering from the buffer solution alone. No protein aggregation was detected, and the linearity of the Guinier plot (supplemental Fig. S1) indicated that the protein solutions were homogeneous. Data reduction was carried out with software provided at the Daresbury facility, and subsequent analysis was done with the ATSAS program package (36Konarev P.V. Petoukhov M.V. Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006; 39: 277-286Crossref Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The theoretical Rg for the crystal structure of the IBS2 domain was calculated using Crysol (37Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy-NMR spectra were collected using a 0.2 mm protein solution in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol at 298 K on a Bruker AVANCE DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. Spectra were processed and analyzed using TopSpin software (Bruker). Binding of Integrin Tails to Talin Rod Using a Pulldown Assay-Purified talin rod fragments were diluted to 250 nm in PN buffer (10 mm PIPES, 50 mm NaCl, 150 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8). To assay for integrin binding, 700 μl of protein solution was mixed (incubated for 2 h at room temperature) with 10 μg of His-Avi-tagged integrin tails immobilized on NeutrAvidin-coated beads. Unbound proteins were removed by three washes in PN buffer containing 5% Triton X-100, and bound proteins were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer and detected by Western blotting (38Lim C.J. Han J. Yousefi N. Ma Y. Amieux P.S. McKnight G.S. Taylor S.S. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) was used to detect talin rod domains, and a rabbit Anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to detect the talin head. Binding of Integrin Tails to Talin Rod by ELISA-Microtiter wells (ELISA high binding plate, white, Fisher) were coated with a solution of 10 μg/ml NeutrAvidin (Pierce) and incubated with 150 μl of blocking buffer (1% heat inactivated-bovine serum albumin in PBS). Wells were then incubated with purified recombinant His-Avi-tagged integrin tails (2 μg/ml) diluted in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Tween 20 (sample buffer). Talin rod fragments (25-2500 nm) in sample buffer were added to the wells, and bound talin was detected with primary mouse Anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen, ratio 1:5000) and a secondary goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (BIOSOURCE) using luminescence with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). All incubations were for 1 h at 37 °C in 50 μl of buffer unless otherwise stated, and plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 after each step. Controls included wells without NeutrAvidin, NeutrAvidin without integrin, and wells coated with αIIb-integrin. Integrin loading onto NeutrAvidin plates was quantitated using mouse 7H8 anti-helix monoclonal antibody, and some wells were coated with the talin fragments to verify equal loading of the various constructs. Expression of GFP-tagged Talin IBS2 Polypeptides in Vinculin-null Cells-Vinculin-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (39Xu W. Baribault H. Adamson E.D. Development. 1998; 125: 327-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum with 2 mm l-glutamine were plated onto glass coverslips, and 24 h later transfected with cDNAs encoding various pEGFP-C2-tagged mouse IBS2 polypeptides using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were fixed with pre-warmed para-formaldehyde (4% (w/v) in PBS), permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and stained using a mouse monoclonal antibody to paxillin (clone 349, BD Biosciences, diluted 1:300 in 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS) followed by a goat anti-mouse conjugated to AlexaFluor 568 fluorescent dye. Cells were imaged using an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a 63× oil immersion lens (numerical aperture = 1.3). Digital images were processed in Adobe Photoshop CS2. Phospholipid Binding-Phosphatidylinositol phosphate strips (Invitrogen) were treated at room temperature for 5 h with 3% ovalbumin in TBS-T (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) to eliminate nonspecific binding, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml talin fragments in TBS-T containing 3% ovalbumin. After incubation, the strips were washed three times at room temperature in TBS-T containing 0.1% ovalbumin, and talin binding was detected with a mouse anti-His horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (ratio 1:6000, 1 h at room temperature, Alpha Diagnostics), followed by three washes in TBS-T. The signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). SPOT Synthesis-Peptides (25- and 36-mers) based on the mouse β-integrin sequences were synthesized on a fully automated SPOT synthesizer Multipep (Intavis AG, Germany). The derivatization of hydroxyl groups of cellulose sheets (Schleicher & Schuell, Germany) was carried out with Fmoc-alanine, 1-methylimidazole, and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in dimethyl formamide overnight. The peptides were then synthesized by repeated deposition of pre-activated amino acids onto derivatized cellulose sheets via Fmoc chemistry, using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole activation of amino acids in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and Fmoc deprotection with 20% (v) piperidine in dimethyl formamide. During the first three cycles of synthesis, residual amino groups and the final N-terminal amino groups were blocked with a mixture of 80% acetic anhydride/10% N,N-diisopropylethylamine/10% dimethyl formamide (v/v) for 30 min. Finally, cleavage of side-chain protection groups was carried out in 95% trifluoroacetic acid/5% dichloromethane (v/v) for 45 min. Typically, the loading of peptides was ∼100 nmol per spot. Talin IBS2 Binding to β-Integrin SPOT-peptide Arrays-Membranes were treated overnight with 10% fetal bovine serum in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl). Murine talin fragment C (residues 1975-2541), N-terminally tagged with T7 & GFP, and C-terminally with His-7, was expressed using pET23A-T7 (40van der Ven P.F. Wiesner S. Salmikangas P. Auerbach D.

Eluted protein was subjected to Mono Q ion-exchange chromatography (Amersham Biosciences), and purified T7/GFP-talin C was transferred into PBS. Membranes were overlaid for 2 h with T7/GFP-talinC (1 μm) in Tris-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature. Bound T7/GFP-talin fragment C was detected using a monoclonal T7 antibody (Novagen) and alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-mouse Ig (Jackson Laboratories), as described previou"

High-precision uranium-lead dating of zircons in gabbros from the Vema Fracture Zone on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge reveals that the crust there grew in a highly regular pattern characterized by shallow melt delivery. Combined with results from previous dating studies, this finding suggests that two distinct modes of crustal accretion occur along slow-spreading ridges. Individual samples record a zircon date range of 90,000 to 235,000 years, which is interpreted to reflect the time scale of zircon crystallization in oceanic plutonic rocks."

Here we aimed to identify biochemical markers for screening and early intervention in women.Plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL) 1-alpha, IL1-beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, interferon-gamma (INF-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), total tri-iodothyronine (TT3), total thyroxine (TT4), prolactin, and testosterone were measured in: 195 women on long-term sick-leave for a stress-related affective disorder, 45 women at risk for professional burnout, and 84 healthy women.We found significantly increased levels of MCP-1, VEGF and EGF in women exposed to prolonged psychosocial stress. Statistical analysis indicates that they independently associate with a significant risk for being classified as ill.MCP-1, EGF, and VEGF are potential markers for screening and early intervention in women under prolonged psychosocial stress."
https://openalex.org/W2021954132,"Background In this study the predictive value of the combined dexamethasone/CRH test (DEX/CRH test) for acute antidepressant response was investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings In 114 depressed inpatients suffering from unipolar or bipolar depression (sample 1) the DEX/CRH test was performed at admission and shortly before discharge. During their stay in the hospital patients received different antidepressant treatment regimens. At admission, the rate of nonsuppression (basal cortisol levels >75.3 nmol/l) was 24.6% and was not related to the later therapeutic response. Moreover, 45 out of 114 (39.5%) patients showed an enhancement of HPA axis function at discharge in spite of clinical improvement. In a second sample, 40 depressed patients were treated either with reboxetine or mirtazapine for 5 weeks. The DEX/CRH test was performed before, after 1 week, and after 5 weeks of pharmacotherapy. Attenuation of HPA axis activity after 1 week was associated with a more pronounced alleviation of depressive symptoms after 5-week mirtazapine treatment, whereas downregulation of HPA system activity after 5 weeks was related to clinical response to reboxetine. However, early improvement of HPA axis dysregulation was not necessarily followed by a beneficial treatment outcome. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, performance of a single DEX/CRH test does not predict the therapeutic response. The best predictor for response seems to be an early attenuation of HPA axis activity within 1 or 2 weeks. However, early improvement of HPA system dysfunction is not a sufficient condition for a favourable response. Since a substantial part of depressive patients display a persistence of HPA axis hyperactivity at discharge, downregulation of HPA system function is not a necessary condition for acute clinical improvement either. Our data underline the importance of HPA axis dysregulation for treatment outcome in major depression, although restoration of HPA system dysfunction seems to be neither a necessary nor a sufficient determinant for acute treatment response."
https://openalex.org/W2049479975,"Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, including hyper- or hypo-activity of the stress hormone system, plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of mood disorders such as major depression (MD). Further biological hallmarks of MD are disturbances in circadian rhythms and sleep architecture. Applying a translational approach, an animal model has recently been developed, focusing on the deviation in sensitivity to stressful encounters. This so-called 'stress reactivity' (SR) mouse model consists of three separate breeding lines selected for either high (HR), intermediate (IR), or low (LR) corticosterone increase in response to stressors.In order to contribute to the validation of the SR mouse model, our study combined the analysis of behavioural and HPA axis rhythmicity with sleep-EEG recordings in the HR/IR/LR mouse lines. We found that hyper-responsiveness to stressors was associated with psychomotor alterations (increased locomotor activity and exploration towards the end of the resting period), resembling symptoms like restlessness, sleep continuity disturbances and early awakenings that are commonly observed in melancholic depression. Additionally, HR mice also showed neuroendocrine abnormalities similar to symptoms of MD patients such as reduced amplitude of the circadian glucocorticoid rhythm and elevated trough levels. The sleep-EEG analyses, furthermore, revealed changes in rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep as well as slow wave activity, indicative of reduced sleep efficacy and REM sleep disinhibition in HR mice.Thus, we could show that by selectively breeding mice for extremes in stress reactivity, clinically relevant endophenotypes of MD can be modelled. Given the importance of rhythmicity and sleep disturbances as biomarkers of MD, both animal and clinical studies on the interaction of behavioural, neuroendocrine and sleep parameters may reveal molecular pathways that ultimately lead to the discovery of new targets for antidepressant drugs tailored to match specific pathologies within MD."
https://openalex.org/W2055948011,"We have investigated the effect of neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) agonists on HEK293 cells transfected with the NK1R receptor. The NK1R receptor mediates dramatic shape changes that include contractions of the membrane cortex resulting in membrane bleb formation. We have found that the cell shape changes correlate with changes in electrical impedance measured in cellular monolayers. The shape and impedance changes were prevented after preincubation with NK1R antagonists aprepitant and L-73060. Although bleb formation usually heralds apoptotic cell death, we have found that NK1R-mediated cellular blebbing does not associate with apoptosis. Preincubation with a cell-permeable derivative of C3 transferase that blocks Rho or with the Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase inhibitor Y27632 completely prevented NK1R-induced shape and impedance changes. Blebbing was also completely inhibited by ML-9, a myosin light chain kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, the phospholipase C inhibitor U73,122 did not interfere with the effect of Substance P (SP) on cellular morphology and cellular impedance but completely blocked SP-induced intracellular calcium increase, indicating that the blebbing is a process independent of intracellular calcium elevations. Blebbing is a protein kinase C-independent process, since the nonselective protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X did not interfere with SP-induced effects. Based on these results, we provide the first evidence that NK1R receptor-ligand interaction can cause apoptosis-independent cellular blebbing and that this process is mediated by the Rho/Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2026441203,"Chromogranin A (CgA) has been proposed to play a major role in the formation of dense-core secretory granules (DCGs) in neuroendocrine cells. Here, we took advantage of unique features of the frog CgA (fCgA) to assess the role of this granin and its potential functional determinants in hormone sorting during DCG biogenesis. Expression of fCgA in the constitutively secreting COS-7 cells induced the formation of mobile vesicular structures, which contained cotransfected peptide hormones. The fCgA and the hormones coexpressed in the newly formed vesicles could be released in a regulated manner. The N- and C-terminal regions of fCgA, which exhibit remarkable sequence conservation with their mammalian counterparts were found to be essential for the formation of the mobile DCG-like structures in COS-7 cells. Expression of fCgA in the corticotrope AtT20 cells increased pro-opiomelanocortin levels in DCGs, whereas the expression of N- and C-terminal deletion mutants provoked retention of the hormone in the Golgi area. Furthermore, fCgA, but not its truncated forms, promoted pro-opiomelanocortin sorting to the regulated secretory pathway. These data demonstrate that CgA has the intrinsic capacity to induce the formation of mobile secretory granules and to promote the sorting and release of peptide hormones. The conserved terminal peptides are instrumental for these activities of CgA.

The fundamental feature of neuroendocrine and endocrine cells is the occurrence of dense-core secretory granules (DCGs), 3The abbreviations used are: DCG, dense-core secretory granule; RSP, regulated secretory pathway; ISG, immature secretory granule; TGN, trans-Golgi network; CgA, chromogranin A; fCgA, frog CgA; POMC, pro-opiomelanocortin; ACTH, adrenocorticotropin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GH, growth hormone; VAMP2, vesicle-associated membrane protein-synaptobrevin; NPY, neuropeptide Y; MBP, maltose-binding protein; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TBS-T, Tween 20 containing TBS; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 3The abbreviations used are: DCG, dense-core secretory granule; RSP, regulated secretory pathway; ISG, immature secretory granule; TGN, trans-Golgi network; CgA, chromogranin A; fCgA, frog CgA; POMC, pro-opiomelanocortin; ACTH, adrenocorticotropin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GH, growth hormone; VAMP2, vesicle-associated membrane protein-synaptobrevin; NPY, neuropeptide Y; MBP, maltose-binding protein; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TBS-T, Tween 20 containing TBS; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. which are key cytoplasmic organelles responsible for secretion of hormones, neuropeptides, and neurotransmitters through the regulated secretory pathway (RSP). Storage at high concentrations of these secretory products is required for their finely tuned release in response to extracellular stimulation (1Dannies P.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 3-21PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kim T. Gondré-Lewis M.C. Arnaoutova I. Loh Y.P. Physiology. 2006; 21: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). DCG biogenesis starts with the budding of immature secretory granules (ISGs) from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) through interactions between lipid rafts and protein components, in a similar manner to constitutive vesicle budding (2Kim T. Gondré-Lewis M.C. Arnaoutova I. Loh Y.P. Physiology. 2006; 21: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 3Wang Y. Thiele C. Huttner W.B. Traffic. 2000; 1: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The ISG budding is followed by a multistep maturation process to form the mature secretory granules, including removal of the constitutive secretory proteins and lysosomal enzymes inadvertently packaged into ISGs (4Tooze S.A. Martens G.J. Huttner W.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 116-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).Despite increasing knowledge of the various steps of DCG formation, the nature of the sorting signals for entry of proteins into the DCGs and the molecular machinery required to generate secretory granules are not fully elucidated (5Dikeakos J.D. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 6Morvan J. Tooze S.A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 129: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Several recent studies highlighted the role of members of the granin family, which may represent the driving force for granulogenesis in the TGN (2Kim T. Gondré-Lewis M.C. Arnaoutova I. Loh Y.P. Physiology. 2006; 21: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), although this notion has been a matter of debate (7Day R. Gorr S.U. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 10-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Granins are soluble acidic proteins widely distributed in endocrine and neuroendocrine cells, which are characterized by the ability to aggregate at acidic pH and a high Ca2+ environment (8Taupenot L. Harper K.L. O'Connor D.T. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1134-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 9Montero-Hadjadje M. Vaingankar S. Elias S. Tostivint H. Mahata S.K. Anouar Y. Acta Physiol. (Oxf.). 2008; 192: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These conditions are found in the lumen of the TGN allowing granins to aggregate in this compartment and to be segregated from constitutively secreted proteins (10Chanat E. Weiss U. Huttner W.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1558-1565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The granin aggregates are believed to associate directly or indirectly with lipid rafts at the TGN to induce budding and formation of the ISGs. A prominent role of chromogranin A (CgA) in the regulation of DCG formation in endocrine and neuroendocrine cells has been proposed. Thus, depletion of CgA in PC12 cells led to a dramatic decrease in the number of DCGs (12Kim T. Tao-Cheng J.H. Eiden L.E. Loh Y.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), and exogenously expressed CgA in these depleted PC12 cells, as in DCG-deficient endocrine A35C and 6T3 cells, restored DCG biogenesis (12Kim T.

Taupenot L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38038-38051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Besides, expression of granins in non-endocrine, constitutively secreting cells such as CV-1, NIH3T3, or COS-7 cells provoked the formation of DCG-like structures that release their content in response to Ca2+ influx (12Kim T. Tao-Cheng J.H. Eiden L.E. Loh Y.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 14Huh Y.H. Jeon S.H. Yoo S.H. J. Biol.

Further investigations performed in CgA null mice and transgenic mice expressing antisense RNA against CgA also revealed a reduction in the number of DCGs in chromaffin cells that was associated with an impairment of catecholamine storage, thus demonstrating the crucial role of CgA in normal DCG biogenesis (16Mahapatra N.R. O'Connor D.T. Vaigankar S.M. Hikim A.P. Mahata M. Ray S. Staite E. Wu H. Gu Y. Dalton N. Kennedy B.P. Ziegler M.G. Ross J. Mahata S.K. J. Clin.

In CgA knockout mice, the introduction of the gene expressing human CgA restored the regulated secretory phenotype (16Mahapatra N.R. O'Connor D.T. Vaigankar S.M. Hikim A.P. Mahata M. Ray S. Staite E.

A different CgA null mice strain exhibited no discernable effect on DCG formation, but elevated catecholamine secretion (18Hendy G.N. Li T. Girard M. Feldstein R.C. Mulay S. Desjardins R. Day R. Karaplis A.C. Tremblay M.L. Canaff L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1935-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), proving that CgA deficiency is associated with hormone storage impairment in neuroendocrine cells in vivo, a finding that was confirmed in vitro (19Montesinos M.S.

Karaplis A.C. Tremblay M.L. Canaff L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1935-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) exhibited a compensatory overexpression of other granins, pointing to a possible overlap in granin function in secretory granule biogenesis.We reported previously that the frog CgA (fCgA) gene is coordinately regulated with the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene in the pituitary pars intermedia during the neuroendocrine reflex of skin color change, which allows amphibia to adapt to their environment through the release of POMC-derived melanotropic peptides (20Turquier V. Vaudry H. Jégou S. Anouar Y. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4104-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21Peinado J.R. Vazquez-Martinez R. Cruz-Garcia D. Ruiz-Navarro A. Anouar Y. Tonon M.C.

Sequence comparison of fCgA with its mammalian orthologs revealed a high conservation of the N- and C-terminal domains, and far less conservation of the central part of the protein (Fig. 1A), suggesting that these domains may play a role in DCG formation and hormone release in various species (9Montero-Hadjadje M.

To assess the role of fCgA and its conserved N- and C-terminal regions in hormone sorting, storage, and secretion, we engineered different constructs that produce the native unmodified (no tag added) protein and truncated forms lacking the conserved N- and C-terminal domains, and we developed an antibody that specifically recognizes the central region of fCgA. Using the constitutively secreting COS-7 cells, which are devoid of DCGs, we could demonstrate for the first time that CgA is essential for targeting peptide hormones to newly formed mobile DCG-like structures. In the CgA-expressing AtT20 cells, which exhibit an only moderate capacity to sort secretory proteins to the regulated pathway (22Moore H.P. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1773-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the granin plays a pivotal role in the sorting and release of POMC. The conserved terminal peptides of CgA are instrumental for these activities.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—Primary antibodies used were: rabbit polyclonal anti-human WE14 at 1:1000 (23Montero-Hadjadje M.

F. Parlow, National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIDDK, Torrance, CA). For immunofluorescence, secondary antibodies were: Alexa 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (IgG), Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG and Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG, at 1:300 (Invitrogen). For Western blot, anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences, Courtaboeuf, France) or anti-sheep (Jackson ImmunoResearch) horseradish peroxidase-conjugate secondary antibodies were used at 1:1000. For electron microscopy, rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to 10-nm gold particles (British Biocell, Tebu, France) was used at 1:20. GFP-tagged vesicle-associated membrane protein-synaptobrevin (VAMP2-GFP) and Venus-tagged neuropeptide Y (NPY-Venus) were gifts from R. W. Holz (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor) and D. Perrais (CNRS UMR 5091, Bordeaux, France), respectively.Production of Recombinant fCgA107-234 and the Cognate Antibody—A cDNA sequence encoding portion of the central region of fCgA was amplified by PCR from the fCgA cDNA (20Turquier V. Vaudry H. Jégou S. Anouar Y. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4104-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) using 50 pmol of the sense primer 5′-ATGCGAATTCCGTCTTCACAGTTAAATTC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-ATGCAAGCTTAAATCCTCATCGAATTGTC-3′. An EcoRI restriction site necessary for subcloning was incorporated at the 5′-end of the sense primer. A stop codon and a HindIII restriction site necessary for the production of the protein and for subcloning, respectively, were introduced at the 5′-end of the antisense primer. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and ligated to the expression plasmid pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) previously cut with EcoRI and HindIII. The construct was verified by DNA sequencing. This strategy allows for the subcloning of fCgA107-234 cDNA in the sense orientation, in-frame with and downstream of the plasmid region encoding the bacterial maltose-binding protein (MBP). The MBP-fCgA107-234 fusion protein was expressed in isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced Escherichia coli and affinity purified from bacterial soluble extracts applied to amylose resin essentially as described by the manufacturer of the Protein Fusion and Purification System (New England Biolabs). Antibodies (RV31.4) against the fusion protein were raised by injecting New Zealand rabbits. Sera from the immunized rabbits were used at 1:1000 for electron microscopy and at 1:500 for immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis to immunostain full-length and truncated forms of fCgA.Construction of Expression Vectors—Full-length fCgA and the C-terminal deletion mutant fCgA1-336 (named ΔCfCgA) were obtained by PCR cloning using the sense primer FCCA-1 (5′-TGCGATATCCAGCCAGCCGGATCC-3′), including an EcoRV restriction site (underlined bases), and the antisense primer FCCA-5 (5′-ATGCGCGGCCGCTCATCCCCTCCTCAA-3′), including a NotI restriction site. To produce the N-terminally deleted form of fCgA, i.e. fCgA76-378 (named ΔNfCgA) and the N/C-terminally deleted fCgA, i.e. fCgA76-336 (named ΔNCfCgA), the corresponding cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the sense primer FCCA-4 (5′-ATGCGAATTCAAGAAGAATCGCGGC-3′), including EcoRI restriction site, and the antisense primer FCCA-2 (5′-ATGCGCGGCCGCTTATCTTCTGGCCTTTTG-3′) or FCCA-5, including the NotI restriction site. The amplified fragments were digested with the appropriate enzymes and subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pIRESneo2 plasmid (BD Clontech, Saint Germain-en-Laye, France). Because the N terminally deleted forms of fCgA would lack a signal peptide, we amplified this sequence from fCgA cDNA using the sense primer FCCA-1 and the antisense primer FCCA-3 (5′-ATGCGAATTCAGGAAGGGACAAAACTTGTGC-3′), including EcoRI restriction site, and inserted it upstream of the cDNAs encoding these proteins. PCR was performed in a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All the constructs were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and nucleotide sequence analysis using a Li-Cor 4200 DNA sequencer (Science Tec, Les Ulis, France).Cell Culture and Transfection—African green monkey kidney fibroblast-derived COS-7 cells (ATCC, CRL 1651), and mouse corticotrope-derived AtT20/D16v-F2 cells (ATCC, CRL1795) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 units ml-1 penicillin, and 100 μgml-1 streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Supercoiled plasmid DNA for transfection was purified on Qiagen columns. Cells were transfected with 0.8 μg (24-well plate) or 1.25 μg (12-well plate) of DNA constructs and 1-2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) per well according to the manufacturer's protocol. Six hours after the beginning of transfection, the culture medium was replaced, and cells were further cultured for 48 h.Secretion Analysis—Transiently transfected COS7 cells cultured in 24-well Costar plates were extensively washed with secretion medium (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and subsequently incubated in this medium alone (constitutive release) or with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (1 μm, Sigma, stimulated release of NPY) for 30 min or in barium secretion buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm BaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) (stimulated release of GH) for 15 min, at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transiently transfected AtT20 cells grown in 24-well Costar plates were extensively washed with secretion medium (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and subsequently incubated in secretion medium (constitutive release) or in potassium secretion medium (85 mm NaCl, 59 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) (stimulated release), for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Secretion media were collected, cleared by centrifugation (5 min, 6,000 × g, 4 °C) and stored for further analysis. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and centrifuged 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Proteins in secretion media and cell homogenates were precipitated using 10% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by Western blotting. For the GH release experiments, the cells were harvested by scraping in 10 mm PBS. The amounts of GH secreted into the medium and retained in the cells were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Applied Science). GH secretion is expressed as a percentage of total GH present in the cells before stimulation. For the ACTH release experiments, the cells were harvested by scraping in 10 mm PBS. The amounts of ACTH secreted into the medium and retained in the cells were measured using an enzymatic immunoassay (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA). ACTH secretion is expressed as a percentage of total ACTH present in the cells before stimulation.SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels in denaturing conditions and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose sheets (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were incubated in a blocking buffer containing 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, incubated overnight with anti-fCgA, anti-WE14, anti-GFP, or anti-ACTH antibodies. Then, membranes were washed for 45 min with TBS-T. Blots were subsequently incubated for 1 h with appropriate secondary antibodies in blocking buffer. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The radiographs were analyzed with a computer-assisted image analyzer (Biocom 2000, Les Ulis, France).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—All procedures in this study conformed to the animal welfare guidelines of the European Community and were approved by the French Ministry of Agriculture (authorization no. 76.451). Frogs were anesthetized by immersion in a solution of 0.1% triaminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (Sigma-Aldrich) and perfused transcardially with 100 ml of PBS. The perfusion was continued with 100 ml of Stefanini's fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% picric acid). Rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (35 mg/kg) and perfused through the aorta with 50 ml of PBS followed by 300 ml of Stefanini's fixative. The adrenal glands and pituitaries were quickly dissected and post-fixed overnight at 4 °C with the same fixative solution. The glands were stored in 15% sucrose in PBS for 12 h and transferred into PBS containing 30% sucrose. Then, they were placed in an embedding medium (OCT Tissue Teck, Nussloch, Germany) and immediately frozen. The tissues were cut in 10-μm sections using a cryomicrotome (Frigocut 2800 E, Reichert Jung, Nussloch, Germany). Cells cultured onto poly-l-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated glass coverslips were transfected as described above and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. Tissue slices and cells were permeabilized for 20 min with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS and treated with normal donkey serum at 1:100 dilution to reduce nonspecific antibody labeling. Biological samples were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with one or two unlabeled primary antibodies, and for 1 h with one or two secondary antibodies. Tissue slices and cells were observed on a Leica SP2 upright confocal laser scanning microscope (DMRAX-UV) equipped with the Acousto-Optical Beam Splitter system and with 25×, 40×, and 63× oil immersion objectives (Leica, Microsystems, Reuil-Malmaison, France). For confocal images, Alexa 488 was excited at 488 nm and observed in a 505-540 nm window. Alexa 594 was excited at 594 nm and observed in a 600-630 nm window. Overlay and maximum projection of the z-stacks files have been performed with post acquisition Leica confocal software functions to obtain the presented snapshots. To verify the specificity of the immunoreaction, the primary or secondary antibodies were substituted with PBS.Immunoelectron Microscopy and Morphometry—COS-7 cells were cryofixed using an EM-PACT I High Pressure Freezing apparatus (Leica) without any precooling treatment and freeze-substituted using the freeze-substitution apparatus (AFS, Leica) in anhydrous acetone containing 0.5% uranyl acetate. The substitution procedure was as follows: -90 °C for 72 h, -60 °C for 12 h, -30 °C for 12 h, and finally -15 °C with increasing temperature steps of 2 °C/h. Samples were washed twice in anhydrous ethanol to remove acetone and embedded at -15 °C in a solution containing ethanol/London Resin White (ratios of 2:1, 1:1, and then 1:2 for 8 h for each step) and in pure resin for 24 h twice. Polymerization was carried out at -15 °C under UV light for 48 h, within the AFS apparatus. All incubations were carried out at room temperature. Ultrathin sections (50-70 nm) mounted on carbon-Formvar-coated nickel grids were incubated in the blocking solution containing TBS supplemented with 0.2% acetylated bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 for 15 min. The grids were then incubated with the primary fCgA antibody diluted 1:1000 in TBS containing 0.2% acetylated bovine serum albumin and 3% normal goat serum for 2 h. After washing in TBS with 0.2% acetylated bovine serum albumin, grids were incubated for 90 min with an anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to 10 nm colloidal gold particles diluted 1:20 in the same buffer as the primary antibody. After washing, grids were transferred to a droplet of TBS containing 2% glutaraldehyde for 10 min and rinsed in TBS followed by deionized water. Sections were stained with uranyl acetate (0.5% in methanol) and lead citrate for 10 min. Observations were made at 80 Kv in a Tecnai 12 Biotwin electron microscope (FEI Co., Eindhoven, Netherlands). Image acquisitions were performed with a charge-coupled device Megaview II camera controlled by AnalySis software (Eloise, Paris, France). Control for the specificity of CgA immunogold labeling included omitting primary antibody and using non-transfected COS-7 cells or cells transfected by the empty vector (pIRES). Measurements of the diameter of newly formed DCG-like structures in cells transfected with fCgA were performed only on vesicles exhibiting labeling with fCgA antibody using AnalySis software. Mean size was determined from 98 values.Real-time Video Microscopy—For imaging of living COS-7 cells, transfected cells were cultured in Labtec (Invitrogen) during 48 h at 37 °C in a controlled atmosphere (5% CO2) and examined under an inverted microscope (Leica) equipped with an incubation chamber (Solent Scientific Ltd., Segensworth, UK) and computer-controlled motorized stage and illumination shutters. Images were acquired with a 63× oil immersion objective and a CoolSnapfx camera (Princeton Instrument, Trenton, NJ) with a pixel size of 6.7 μm × 6.7 μm. The speed of image acquisition was three frames/s (2 × 2 binning). Images containing a region of interest within the cell were streamed to memory on a computer during acquisition and saved to a disk. Distance covered by each vesicle from its origin was analyzed by using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices, Saint-Gregoire, France). For analysis of single events, each acquired sequence (91 frames) was reviewed multiple times on screen at various settings of intensity to pick out all visible events. Measurements were performed on entire cells, and only a small region of interest was used to illustrate vesicle trajectory.Quantification of Fluorescence Distribution—Three-dimensional blind deconvolution of confocal images was performed using two iterations operated by Autoquant X software (Media-Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). Deconvolved confocal images were analyzed and three-dimensional rendered by using Imaris software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland). Fluorescent particles with a diameter > 200 nm were outlined and counted automatically. All three-dimensional reconstructions were done with the same threshold settings. For each three-dimensional image, 0.304-μm step z-stacks (512 × 512 focal planes) were acquired by using a 63× objective.Data Analysis—Data are reported as mean values ± S.E. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used. Probability values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Data were analyzed with the Prism program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).RESULTSExpression of fCgA Induces the Biogenesis of Dense-core Vesicles in Non-endocrine Cells—To study native unmodified fCgA in endocrine and non-endocrine cells, we first developed an antibody that recognizes fCgA but not the mammalian CgA. Because the central region of fCgA exhibited very weak sequence similarity with its mammalian counterparts, we took advantage of this property to develop a specific antibody against the frog protein, using the recombinant polypeptide fCgA107-234 (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, this antibody recognized CgA and its processing intermediates in frog pituitary extracts, but not in rat pituitary extracts. By contrast, an antibody directed against the conserved CgA-derived peptide WE14 detected CgA and its processing products in both rat and frog pituitary extracts (Fig. 1B). Using confocal microscopy, the antibody against fCgA revealed immunoreactive cells in frog pituitary and adrenal glands (Fig. 1C). In contrast, this antibody failed to label chromaffin cells in rat adrenal gland, which could be labeled only with the WE14 antibody (Fig. 1C). Thus, the antibody developed against fCgA provides a means to track specifically the frog CgA protein.Previous studies have shown that expression of granins is sufficient to induce the appearance of secretory granule-like vesicles in non-endocrine cells (12Kim T.

https://openalex.org/W2049804001,"A specialized intercellular junction between podocytes, known as the slit diaphragm (SD), forms the essential structural frame-work for glomerular filtration in the kidney. In addition, mounting evidence demonstrates that the SD also plays a crucial role as a signaling platform in physiological and pathological states. Nephrin, the major component of the SD, is tyrosine-phosphorylated by a Src family tyrosine kinase, Fyn, in developing or injured podocytes, recruiting Nck to Nephrin via its Src homology 2 domain to regulate dynamic actin remodeling. Dysregulated Ca(2+) homeostasis has also been implicated in podocyte damage, but the mechanism of how podocytes respond to injury is largely unknown. Here we have identified phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1) as a novel phospho-Nephrin-binding protein. When HEK293T cells expressing a chimeric protein consisting of CD8 and Nephrin cytoplasmic domain (CD) were treated with anti-CD8 and anti-mouse antibodies, clustering of Nephrin and phosphorylation of Nephrin-CD were induced. Upon this clustering, PLC-gamma1 was bound to phosphorylated Nephrin Tyr-1204, which induced translocation of PLC-gamma1 from cytoplasm to the CD8/Nephrin cluster on the plasma membrane. The recruitment of PLC-gamma1 to Nephrin activated PLC-gamma1, as detected by phosphorylation of PLC-gamma1 Tyr-783 and increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate level. We also found that Nephrin Tyr-1204 phosphorylation triggers the Ca(2+) response in a PLC-gamma1-dependent fashion. Furthermore, PLC-gamma1 is significantly phosphorylated in injured podocytes in vivo. Given the profound effect of PLC-gamma in diverse cellular functions, regulation of the Ca(2+) signaling by Nephrin may be important in modulating the glomerular filtration barrier function."
https://openalex.org/W2038685221,"Growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae following glucose depletion (the diauxic shift) depends on a profound metabolic adaptation accompanied by a global reprogramming of gene expression. In this study, we provide evidence for a heretofore unsuspected role for Isc1p in mediating this reprogramming. Initial studies revealed that yeast cells deleted in ISC1, the gene encoding inositol sphingolipid phospholipase C, which resides in mitochondria in the post-diauxic phase, showed defective aerobic respiration in the post-diauxic phase but retained normal intrinsic mitochondrial functions, including intact mitochondrial DNA, normal oxygen consumption, and normal mitochondrial polarization. Microarray analysis revealed that the Δisc1 strain failed to up-regulate genes required for nonfermentable carbon source metabolism during the diauxic shift, thus suggesting a mechanism for the defective supply of respiratory substrates into mitochondria in the post-diauxic phase. This defect in regulating nuclear gene induction in response to a defect in a mitochondrial enzyme raised the possibility that mitochondria may initiate diauxic shift-associated regulation of nucleus-encoded genes. This was established by demonstrating that in respiratory-deficient petite cells these genes failed to be up-regulated across the diauxic shift in a manner similar to the Δisc1 strain. Isc1p- and mitochondrial function-dependent genes significantly overlapped with Adr1p-, Snf1p-, and Cat8p-dependent genes, suggesting some functional link among these factors. However, the retrograde response was not activated in Δisc1, suggesting that the response of Δisc1 cannot be simply attributed to mitochondrial dysfunction. These results suggest a novel role for Isc1p in allowing the reprogramming of gene expression during the transition from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism.

Mitochondria are essential organelles whose primary function is the synthesis of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation.

Although a Δisc1 strain grew very slowly in the post-diauxic phase or when grown in media containing nonfermentable carbon sources (12Vaena de Avalos S. Okamoto Y. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

During this pursuit, it was found that the mitochondrial DNA, respiratory chain, and reactive oxygen species from Δisc1 were not significantly compromised; however, the results revealed a defect in induction of those genes involved in nonfermentable carbon source metabolism, including glucose-repressed genes, probably resulting in defective supply of respiratory substrates into mitochondria. In turn, these results led to the identification of a novel and unexpected role for mitochondria in regulating expression of nuclear genes during the diauxic shift. This role was established using petite cells, which have lost mitochondrial DNA and integrity. These cells, as compared with grande cells, failed to execute the regulation of a large spectrum of genes, including glucose-repressed genes required for executing the diauxic shift. These results indicate that Isc1p provides an indispensable role in the global metabolic adaptation in this phase of yeast growth.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains, Media, and Culture Conditions—JK9-3dα WT 2The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; RT, reverse transcription; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. and JK9-3dα Δisc1 (MATα leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 rme1 trp1 his4 Δisc1::kanMX) (16Sawai H.

Standard yeast culture medium was prepared using Difco YPD broth. Plates were prepared using Difco YPD agar and stored at 4 °C. YPethanol contained 1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, and 2% ethanol. YPGE plate contained 1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% ethanol, 2% glycerol, and 2% agar. Yeast cells were cultured with shaking at 30 °C otherwise indicated. Exponentially growing cells were inoculated to fresh media, incubated for 4 or 24 h with shaking, and used as pre-diauxic and post-diauxic phase cells.RNA Preparation—Yeast cells were cultured in medium as described above, centrifuged at 3,000 × g at 4 °C, and snapfrozen with liquid nitrogen, and RNA was isolated from cell pellets using the RNeasy RNA Isolation Kit from Qiagen following the enzymatic lysis protocol.Microarray Procedures—Sample preparation for microarray hybridization was carried out essentially as described in the Affymetrix Expression Analysis Technical Manual and previous reports (19Cowart L.A.

In brief, isolated total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using the Superscript Choice System (Invitrogen), and the derived double-stranded cDNA was purified using phase-lock gel columns (Eppendorf) followed by ethanol precipitation or the cDNA clean up columns provided by Affymetrix. The purified cDNA was then subjected to in vitro transcription using biotinylated ribonucleotides in the Bio-Array™ High Yield™ RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Diagnostics). The biotinylated transcript was purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and then fragmented using 0.2 m Tris acetate, pH 8.1, containing 0.5 m potassium acetate and 0.15 m magnesium acetate. Fragmentation was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis using ethidium bromide for visualization. Samples were then hybridized to the YG-S98 yeast genomic chip (Affymetrix), stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin, and washed in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station exactly as indicated by the Affymetrix Expression Analysis Technical Manual.Data Analysis—Gene chips were scanned using the Affymetrix scanner. Fluorescence values were statistically analyzed to yield gene expression signal values using Microarray Suite 5.0. Expression integrity was confirmed by verification of expected values for internal control probe sets, including sets for ""spikes"" (BioA, BioB, and BioC), ratios of signals between probe sets designed with 3′ or 5′ bias for ACT1 (β-actin), and absence of internal negative controls, including murine genes. Absolute analysis was conducted for each analysis with scaling to a target value of 2500 to facilitate comparison between experiments. Microarray data were derived from two independent experiments for WT and Δisc1 grande and from one experiment for petite. In Fig. 3 and Fig. 6A, genes whose expression at 24 h in WT was greater than 300 were selected. Among the selected genes, the genes whose ratio of WT-24 h/WT-4 h above 2.0 were further selected, and the gene expression ratio of WT-24 h/WT-4 h and mutant-24 h/mutant-4 h was plotted along the log axis. Statistical analyses, including regression and slope analysis of these genes, were performed with a statistical software KaleidaGraph 4 (Hulinks). In Fig. 5A and Fig. 6B, the ratio of mutant-24 h/mutant-4 h/WT-24 h/WT-4 h of the carbohydrate metabolism pathway genes was calculated, and the ratio was expressed by color and thickness of the boxes (red; 24 h/4 h ratio is bigger in mutant than WT; blue, 24 h/4 h ratio is smaller in mutant than WT). The whole set of microarray data are available at Medical University of South Carolina web site.FIGURE 6Defective up-regulation of nonfermentable carbon source metabolism genes in petite. Comparison of gene expression change across the diauxic shift in WT and petite. The ratio of gene expression was calculated from the data obtained from microarray result.

First strand cDNA was produced using 1 μg of total RNA and Superscript II reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen). Real time analysis was performed using iCycler IQ Real Time PCR System (Bio-Rad) and SYBR Green Supermix protocol (Bio-Rad). In brief, primers specific for a 75-150-bp region within the target gene were added to a final core of 12.5 mm to a master mix of sterile water and SYBR Green Supermix. The cDNA template was then diluted 1:50 and added to the mix. The final mixture was pipetted in triplicate into a 96-well plate (Bio-Rad), sealed with iCycler tape (Bio-Rad), and real time PCR performed. Primers used in the real time PCR are shown in supplemental Table SI. The expression of the target genes was normalized to the expression of RDN1.Isolation of Mitochondria—A 6-liter flask containing 1.25 liters of YPD was inoculated with the exponentially growing culture and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h with vigorous aeration. Yeast cells were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min; washed with water; resuspended in 12.5 ml of 100 mm Tris-SO4, pH 9.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol (2 ml/g wet cell); incubated at 30 °C for 15 min; centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min; washed with buffer SP (1.2 m sorbitol, 20 mm potassium/phosphate buffer, pH 7.4); dissolved in buffer SP containing Zymolyase 100T (Seikagaku Corp., 7 ml/g cells, 1.5 mg/g cells); incubated at 30 °C for 60 min; centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 5 min; washed twice with buffer SP (7 ml/g wet cell); resuspended in homogenization buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (6.5 ml/g cells); homogenized in a 40-ml Dounce homogenizer using 15 strokes; diluted 2-fold with homogenizing buffer; centrifuged for 5 min at 1,500 × g to remove cell nuclei and debris; and centrifuged again 2,500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of SM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2) and centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of SM buffer as crude mitochondria.Oxygen Consumption Rate—Exponentially growing yeast cells were inoculated at A600 of 0.1 and incubated 24 h in YPD medium, and 4.4 × 107 cells were washed and resuspended in a total 20 μl of solution A (10 mm HEPES, 25 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.0). Five microliters of the cell suspension was added to 0.6 ml of solution A in the chamber followed by 10 μl of ethanol. Oxygen consumption rate was measured using Dual Oxygen Electrode Amplifier model 203 (Instech). Alternatively, 10 mg of isolated mitochondria were washed and resuspended in a total 200 μl of 0.6 m sorbitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After adding a final 10 μm NADH, 5 μl of the mitochondrial suspension was added to 0.6 ml of 0.6 m sorbitol, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 25 mm K2HPO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA in the chamber, followed by adding a final 2 μm ADP. Oxygen consumption rate was measured using the same machine described above. The oxygen consumption rate after addition of mitochondria was calculated as state 4 respiration rate, that after addition of ADP as state 3 respiration rate, and that after ADP exhaustion as state 4 (2Schlame M. Greenberg M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1997; 1348: 201-206Google Scholar) respiration rate.Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species—Yeast cells grown to 3 × 106 cells/ml were washed, dissolved in distilled water (1 × 106 cells in 1 ml), and incubated in final 40 μm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature in a dark room. Cells were washed with distilled water two times, and the fluorescence was measured using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) with 488-nm argon laser and 530/30BP filter. As a positive control, WT cells treated with α-factor (final 11.9 μm) for 1.5 h were applied to the same analysis.Petite Induction—Petite induction was performed by the ethidium bromide method described by Schneider-Berlin et al. (21Schneider-Berlin K.R. Bonilla T.D. Rowe T.C. Mutat. Res... 2005; 572: 84-97Google Scholar). Briefly, logarithmically grown yeast cells were diluted to 2 × 106 cells/ml in 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.24. Ethidium bromide was added to a final concentration of 50 μm, and the cultures were incubated at 30 °C in the dark for 8 h with shaking and then plated onto YPD or YPGE medium to confirm inability to grow on nonfermentable medium.Glucose Concentration—The concentration of glucose was measured with Glucose CII-test Wako (Wako Chemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1.0 ml of the reaction mixture was mixed with 6.7 μl of the sample and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and absorbance at 530 nm was measured. The absorbance of the blank sample and that without the reaction mixture was subtracted from the absorbance of the sample, and concentration of glucose was calculated from the dilution ratio and the calibration curve.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONΔisc1 Displays Defective Growth on Nonfermentable Carbon Sources but No Defects in Mitochondrial DNA—The Δisc1 strain showed hardly any defect of growth in the pre-diauxic phase in glucose-containing medium and a modest defect in the post-diauxic phase (Fig. 1A), consistent with previous results (12Vaena de Avalos S.

On the other hand, Δisc1 showed strikingly defective growth in medium containing nonfermentable carbon sources such as glycerol (Fig. 1B), thus demonstrating a clear-cut preference for fermentable carbon sources. Because Isc1p associated with mitochondria in the post-diauxic growth phase (3Kitagaki H. Cowart L.A. Matmati N. Vaena de Avalos S. Novgorodov S.A. Zeidan Y.H. Bielawski J. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A.

Thus, yeast strains require WT mitochondrial DNA (rho+) to respire and grow on nonfermentable media (22Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev... 1990; 54: 211-225Google Scholar), whereas cells in which part or all mitochondrial DNA is lost (rho- or rho0, respectively) lose functional mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunits of both the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase, fail to grow on nonfermentable media, and form ""petite"" colonies on fermentable media. Moreover, mutants that have lost mitochondrial integrity often show decreased content of their mitochondrial DNA (23Foury F. Cazzalini O. FEBS Lett... 1997; 411: 373-377Google Scholar). Therefore, the mitochondrial DNA content in the Δisc1 strain was determined by Southern blotting using a probe directed to the COX1 gene, which is encoded in the mitochondrial genome. The results showed that Δisc1 did not contain less mitochondrial DNA relative to WT, and if any, there was an increase in total mitochondrial DNA (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the growth defect of Δisc1 is not due to loss of mitochondrial DNA.FIGURE 2Lack of intrinsic mitochondrial defects in Δisc1. A, mitochondrial DNA content of WT and Δisc1. The genomic DNA of WT and Δisc1 was obtained from 4 and 24 h after inoculation and analyzed by Southern blotting with the mitochondrial COX1 and nuclear RDN1 probe. B, WT and Δisc1 were incubated in medium containing ethidium bromide for 8 h and plated onto YPD plates. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. Plating onto YPGE plates did not produce any colonies (data not shown). C, oxygen consumption rate of the isolated mitochondria measured as described under ""Experimental Procedures."" The results are represented as the mean ± S.E. of at least two independent experiments. D, reactive oxygen species of WT cells with or without treatment with α-factor (final 11.9 μm at 30 °C for 1.5 h) and Δisc1 cells. The cells were mixed with 40 μm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and applied to FACS analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further confirm this hypothesis, the petite-forming ability of Δisc1 was analyzed. Saccharomyces cerevisiae can usually grow without mitochondrial DNA in fermentable carbon medium (but not in nonfermentable carbon medium). However, mutants that cannot grow without mitochondrial DNA even in fermentable carbon medium are called ""petite-negative"" mutants and are characterized by the inability to form colonies when incubated in fermentable carbon medium containing ethidium bromide (24Giraud M.F. Velours J. Eur. J. Biochem... 1997; 245: 813-818Google Scholar). Δisc1 cells were incubated with 50 μm ethidium bromide in the dark at 30 °C for 8 h to generate petites, and then colony formation on YPD was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 2B, colonies were distinctly formed in Δisc1 as well as in WT (Fig. 2B), indicating that the Δisc1 mutant is not petite-negative, as described previously (25Dunn C.D. Lee M.S. Spencer F.A. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2005; 17: 213-226Google Scholar). These results argue against a major defect in mitochondrial DNA underlying the growth defect of the Δisc1 strain.Isolated Mitochondria from Δisc1 Display an Intact Respiration Rate—Defective mitochondrial phenotypes and the very slow growth of the Δisc1 in nonfermentable carbon source medium suggested the possibility that the respiration rate of mitochondria from the Δisc1 may be lower than that of the WT. WT and Δisc1 cells were incubated in YPD medium and grown to the post-diauxic phase, and mitochondria were isolated as described under ""Experimental Procedures."" Oxygen consumption rate of the isolated mitochondria was measured by incubating 500 μg of the mitochondria with 10 μm NADH and 2 μm ADP and measuring the decrease in the oxygen concentration in the chamber. Unexpectedly, the oxygen consumption rate of isolated mitochondria from Δisc1 in the post-diauxic phase was similar to that of WT (Fig. 2C), suggesting that a critical defect does not exist in the respiratory chain of this mutant.Next, the levels of reactive oxygen species were evaluated because defects in mitochondria often result in an increase in the concentration of the reactive oxygen species of the cells (26Machida K. Tanaka T. Fujita K. Taniguchi M. J. Bacteriol... 1998; 180: 4460-4465Google Scholar). For these experiments, logarithmically growing WT and Δisc1 cells were suspended in 40 μm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a dark room, and the fluorescence was measured by FACS equipped with a 488-nm argon laser and a 530/30BP filter as an indication of the amount of reactive oxygen species in the cells. The strength of the fluorescence of Δisc1 was not significantly different from that of WT, indicating that the amount of reactive oxygen species in the Δisc1 did not differ significantly from that in the WT (Fig. 2D). The sensitivity of this assay was verified by measuring the fluorescence of WT cells treated with α-factor (Fig. 2D), which are known to generate increased amounts of reactive oxygen species (27Pozniakovsky A.I. Knorre D.A. Markova O.V. Hyman A.A. Skulachev V.P. Severin F.F. J. Cell Biol... 2005; 168: 257-269Google Scholar). Together, these results strongly support that mitochondrial DNA, respiratory chain, and reactive oxygen species are not significantly compromised; and thus it seems unlikely that an intrinsic functional defect of respiration of mitochondria could be responsible for the very slow growth observed for the Δisc1 strain in nonfermentable medium.Defects in Transcriptional Adaptation of Metabolic Enzymes in Δisc1—Because the above studies unexpectedly suggested normal mitochondrial DNA, respiratory chain, and reactive oxygen species, it became important to determine the key defects that prevent the Δisc1 strain from normal growth in the post-diauxic phase. Therefore, microarrays were used to determine gene expression levels in the Δisc1 and its parental strain during log phase growth as well as in the post-diauxic phase. WT and Δisc1 cells were grown in YPD medium at 30 °C; RNA was extracted, and gene expression was analyzed. Analysis of the microarray profiles of the WT revealed major changes in gene induction or repression, consistent with previous results (28DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science.. 1997; 278: 680-686Google Scholar) such that more than 1850 genes showed greater than 2-fold induction, and more than 987 genes showed more than 50% repression. Importantly, examination of gene induction in the Δisc"

However it is clear that control of gene expression plays an important role in this process. DNA methylation, a mark of transcriptionally silent chromatin, has similarly been shown to play important roles in neural cell fate commitment in vivo. While DNA methylation is known to play important roles in neural specification during embryonic development, no such role has been shown for any of the methyl-CpG binding proteins (Mecps) in mice. Methodology/Principal Findings To explore the role of DNA methylation in neural cell fate decisions, we have investigated the function of Mecps in mouse development and in neural stem cell derivation, maintenance, and differentiation. In order to test whether the absence of phenotype in singly-mutant animals could be due to functional redundancy between Mecps, we created mice and neural stem cells simultaneously lacking Mecp2, Mbd2 and Zbtb33. No evidence for functional redundancy between these genes in embryonic development or in the derivation or maintenance of neural stem cells in culture was detectable. However evidence for a defect in neuronal commitment of triple knockout NS cells was found. Conclusions/Significance Although DNA methylation is indispensable for mammalian embryonic development, we show that simultaneous deficiency of three methyl-CpG binding proteins genes is compatible with apparently normal mouse embryogenesis. Nevertheless, we provide genetic evidence for redundancy of function between methyl-CpG binding proteins in postnatal mice."
https://openalex.org/W2035077389,"Very little is known as to how the accumulation of senescent cells during aging may affect our ability to cope with various stresses. Here we show that the assembly of stress granules (SGs) is part of the early events used by senescent cells to respond to certain stresses. Although SGs can form in response to stress during senescence activation, their number significantly increases once the cells are fully senescent. This increase correlates with a rapid decrease in the expression levels of the cyclin kinase inhibitor p21, an important activator of senescence. Throughout stress, p21 mRNA is stabilized and localizes to SGs, but only during late senescence does this localization interferes with its translation. Additionally, we observed that when the stress is relieved, senescent cells produce lower levels of p21 protein, which correlates with a small delay in SG disassembly. Therefore, our data suggest that SG formation and the reduction in p21 protein levels represent two main events by which senescent cells respond to stress.

Senescence exists as a stress response whereby cells experience irreversible cell cycle arrest. Because of this antiproliferative effect, senescence is considered a possible tumor suppressor mechanism (1Collado M. Blasco M.A. Serrano M. Cell. 2007; 130: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar, 2Campisi J. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (2911) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the design of many chemotherapeutics that act by inflicting severe DNA damage to tumor cells, triggering cellular senescence (3Roberson R.S. Kussick S.J. Vallieres E. Chen S.Y. Wu D.Y. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2795-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that although aging is characterized by a significant increase in senescent cells, old organisms are more cancer-prone than their younger counterparts (2Campisi J. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (2911) Google Scholar, 4Campisi J. Aging Cell. 2007; 6: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In fact, even though senescent cells reach a state where they appear incapable of further division, they remain metabolically active (5Campisi J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 6Campisi J. Cell. 2005; 120: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar), suggesting that they can still react and adapt to extracellular assaults which, with time, may affect their general behavior.In young organisms senescent cells (at least, those induced by acute p53 activation) are efficiently eliminated by the immune system (7Xue W. Zender L. Miething C. Dickins R.A. Hernando E. Krizhanovsky V. Cordon-Cardo C. Lowe S.W. Nature. 2007; 445: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar, 8Ventura A. Kirsch D.G.

However, with aging, some of these cells acquire the ability to escape elimination and continue to survive for years undetected (1Collado M. Blasco M.A. Serrano M. Cell. 2007; 130: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar, 2Campisi J. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (2911) Google Scholar). Many studies have indicated that the age-dependent accumulation of senescent cells leads not only to a decrease in tissue regeneration and repair (9Krtolica A. Campisi J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1401-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) but also to cancer development (5Campisi J. Nat. Rev.

This results mainly from the fact that senescent cells up-regulate the expression and the secretion of toxic factors (6Campisi J. Cell. 2005; 120: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar), such as matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. MMP-3), epithelial growth factors (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor), and inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-6) (6Campisi J.

These substances disrupt tissue integrity and function, providing a better milieu and stromal support for cancer cells. Surprisingly, very little is known about the affect stress can have on the expression of many genes in senescent cells which might explain how and why the senescence phenotype switches from being a means to stop cancer to becoming an activator of malignancy.The induction of the senescence phenotype requires specific conditions that lead to the up-regulation and activation of many pro-senescence factors. It is well established that the cyclin-dependent kinase p21waf1/cip1 (referred to hereafter as p21) is required for the initial steps leading to the senescence phenotype (2Campisi J. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (2911) Google Scholar, 12Stein G.H. Drullinger L.F. Soulard A. Dulic V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2109-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Mounting evidence indicates that p21 expression is regulated at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels in response to different stimuli including those known to trigger senescence (13Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 14Serrano M. Blasco M.A. Curr. Opin.

Biol. 2001; 21: 5889-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Indeed, during the transition from the proliferative to the senescence state, the translation of p21 mRNA is regulated by the RNA-binding proteins calreticulin (proliferative) and CUGBP1 (senescence). At the proliferative state, calreticulin binds the 5′-untranslated region of p21 mRNA, blocking its translation; however, in senescent cells CUGBP1 (an activator of p21 mRNA translation) relieves this inhibition by displacing calreticulin and binding to the same element in the 5′-untranslated region (17Iakova P. Wang G.L. Timchenko L. Michalak M. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Timchenko N.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Likewise, it has been shown that under some stresses the expression of p21 mRNA may be regulated at the level of stability. For example, in response to ultraviolet radiation (UV), the half-life of p21 mRNA increases by a mechanism involving the RNA-binding protein HuR (13Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether stress could affect the expression levels as well as the function of p21 protein in senescent cells.One of the main mechanisms by which the cell responds to a variety of extracellular assaults is the formation of cytoplasmic foci known as stress granules (SGs) 2The abbreviations used are: SG, stress granule; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; G3BP, Ras-GAP SH3-binding protein; dex, dexamethasone; AS, arsenite; FXR1, Fragile X retardation factor 1.

These entities are considered a part of the survival pathways that are activated with the onset of many stresses to protect key cellular elements that allow a quick recovery if the stress is rapidly removed (20Anderson P. Kedersha N. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 21Kedersha N. Anderson P.

In response to several stresses, some key posttranscriptional regulators such as the RNA-binding proteins HuR (24Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Stenberg M.G. Swanson M.S. Eversole A. Maizels N.

The importance of SG-mediated modulation of gene expression during stress is underscored by the effect that the assembly and disassembly of SGs have on the translation of p21 mRNA in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Indeed, during the first 6 h of MG132 treatment, SGs assemble and recruit p21 mRNA, leading to its stabilization as well as to the inhibition of its translation. These SGs subsequently disassemble in an Hsp70-dependent mechanism, allowing the recovery of p21 translation that correlates with the later activation of the apoptotic pathway and cell death (22Mazroui R. Di Marco S. Kaufman R.J. Gallouzi I.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2603-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The role of Hsp70 protein in cell recovery from stress has been previously demonstrated (30Hall D.M. Xu L. Drake V.J. Oberley L.W. Oberley T.D. Moseley P.L. Kregel K.C. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 31Kregel K.C. Moseley P.L. Skidmore R. Gutierrez J.A. Guerriero Jr., V. J. Appl. Physiol. 1995; 79: 1673-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Hence, the fact that in senescent cells exposed to heat shock the expression of Hsp70 protein is reduced (32Effros R.B. Zhu X. Walford R.L. J. Gerontol. 1994; 49: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 33Luce M.C. Cristofalo V.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 202: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) could be an indication of a decrease in their ability to recover from stress.The features described above argue that under stress conditions SGs are one of the key posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. At this time, however, we do not know whether SG formation is part of the mechanisms by which senescent cells modulate the expression of many genes in response to a variety of stresses. In this study we addressed these issues and found that the number of arsenite-induced SGs significantly increases in senescent cells when compared with their proliferative counterparts. We showed that this increase coincides with the reduction of p21 protein expression in senescent cells exposed to oxidative stress. We discuss the molecular mechanism leading to this reduction and its functional consequences on the ability of senescent cells to recover from stress.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Cultures-IDH4 cells were generously provided by Dr. Myriam Gorospe, NIH, Aging Institute, Baltimore, MD.

Total RNA was extracted from cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N membrane, hybridized with [32P]dCTP-labeled human p21, p53, hsp70, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes, washed, and then exposed to Biomax films. The mRNA stability experiments were performed as described (39Dormoy-Raclet V. Menard I. Clair E. Kurban G. Mazroui R. Di Marco S. von Roretz C. Pause A. Gallouzi I.E. Mol. Cell.

These cells were then prepared for polysome fractionation as described (40Rousseau D. Kaspar R. Rosenwald I. Gehrke L. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The sucrose gradients were prepared using sucrose solutions of 10 and 50% sucrose in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2.All cells to be used for polysome fractionation were washed twice with 5 ml of cold PBS containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. The cells were then scraped with a rubber policeman in 1 ml of cold PBS containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and cells from the same treatment conditions were combined in one tube. Cells were then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellets were each resuspended in 425 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer composed of 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm KCl. The resuspended cells were transferred to a prechilled Eppendorf tube and then the following were added: cycloheximide (final concentration, 100 μg/ml), dithiothreitol (final concentration, 2 mm), and 11.8 μl of RNAguard. This mix was vortexed, and then 25 μl of 10% Triton X-100 and 25 μl of 10% sodium deoxycholate were added. After vortexing again, the cell solutions were centrifuged for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were loaded on the sucrose gradient columns and then centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C. The fractions were collected with the fraction collector, 24 fractions per lysate, with a sensitivity of 0.2, a chart speed of 30, and a pump speed of 40. RNA was isolated from all fractions as described (41Tenenbaum S.A. Lager P.J. Carson C.C. Keene J.D. Methods. 2002; 26: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization-The fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments were performed as described (22Mazroui R. Di Marco S. Kaufman R.J. Gallouzi I.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2603-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment of ∼500 bp corresponding to the coding region of human p21 was amplified by PCR using the following primers fused to either a T7 or T3 minimal promoter sequence: T7-p21 forward, 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGG GAA GTA GCT GGC ATG AAG CC-3′, and T3-p21 reverse, 5′-AAT TAA CCC TCA CTA AAG GGG AAG ACC ATG TGG ACC TGT CA-3′. The PCR product was used as the template for in vitro transcription of the p21 probe needed for fluorescence in situ hybridization. The antisense (T3) and sense (T7) probes were prepared using digoxigenin-RNA labeling mix from Roche Diagnostics. The RNA probes were quantified, denatured, and incubated with permeabilized cells at 37 °C overnight in the hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 5× Denhardt’s solution, 1 mm EDTA, and 250 ng/μl salmon sperm DNA). After the hybridization, the cells were incubated with anti-G3BP antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the cells were incubated with secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody and anti-digoxigenin antibody for immunofluorescence.RESULTSSenescent Cells Respond to Stress by Increasing the Number of SGs Compared with Their Proliferative Counterpart-To investigate the formation and the role of SGs during senescence, we first followed their assembly in senescent cells exposed to a variety of stresses. We used two model systems, serial passage of WI-38 human diploid fibroblasts and IDH4 human fibroblasts (16Wang W. Yang X. Cristofalo V.J. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5889-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It is well established that senescence can be induced in IDH4 cells by growing them in a dex-free media (dex induces the expression of the SV40 large T antigen that maintains the proliferative state of IDH4 cells) for a few days and in WI-38 by serial passages until they reach the population doubling number of 39 or more (42Hayflick L. Clin. Geriatr. Med. 1985; 1: 15-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Hayflick L. Exp. Gerontol. 1998; 33: 639-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). One of the well used biomarkers for replicative senescence is senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity (35Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5618) Google Scholar). While testing senescence activation in our cell systems, we observed that >95% of IDH4 cells presented a senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining 8 days after the removal of dex (supplemental Fig. 1A). As expected (16Wang W. Yang X. Cristofalo V.J. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5889-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the same pattern of β-galactosidase staining was also obtained in WI-38 fibroblasts as early as population doubling number 36 and was more pronounced at population doubling number 39 and later (supplemental Fig. 1B).Several laboratories have shown that treatment of cells with oxidative stress-inducing drugs such as AS triggers the formation of SGs (22Mazroui R. Di Marco S. Kaufman R.J. Gallouzi I.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2603-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 23Kedersha N. Stoecklin G. Ayodele M. Yacono P. Lykke-Andersen J. Fitzler M.J. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). It is also well established that proliferative and senescent cells differentially respond to oxidative stress (44Merker K. Sitte N. Grune T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 45Servais S. Boussouar A. Molnar A. Douki T. Pequignot J.M. Favier R. Free Radic.

Thus, it was of high interest to determine whether SGs could assemble in response to oxidative stress. IDH4 cells grown in proliferative (day 0) or in senescent media (day 4 and 10 post-dex removal) were exposed to 0.5 mm AS for 30 min (Fig. 1). These cells were then fixed, and immunofluorescence experiment was performed using antibodies against three well established SGs markers: FXR1 (22Mazroui R. Di Marco S. Kaufman R.J. Gallouzi I.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2603-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 47Mazroui R. Huot M.E. Tremblay S. Filion C. Labelle Y. Khandjian E.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3007-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), HuR (24Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Stenberg M.G. Swanson M.S. Eversole A. Maizels N. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and G3BP (26Tourriere H. Chebli K. Zekri L. Courselaud B. Blanchard J.M. Bertrand E. Tazi J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). We observed that AS-induced SGs were visible in both proliferative and senescent cells (Fig. 1, compare panels 1, 7, and 13 to 4, 10, and 16 and Fig. 2, compare panels 1, 2, 13, 14, 25, and 26 to panels 5, 6, 17, 18, 29, and 30). The number of SGs was 5-fold higher in late senescent cells (day 10) when compared with their proliferative counterpart (Figs. 1 and 2, graphs, compare day 0 to day 10). In early senescent cells (day 4), however, the number of SGs increased by only 2-fold (Figs. 1 and 2, graph, compare day 0 to day 4).Because, as expected (16Wang W. Yang X. Cristofalo V.J. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5889-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the levels of HuR protein significantly decreased during senescence (supplemental Fig. 2), we defined the number of SGs using FXR1 (Fig. 1) and G3BP (Fig. 2) as a marker. The same results (SG assembly and the increase in their number during senescence) was also obtained using the WI-38 cell system (supplemental Fig. 3). To characterize these foci as bona fide SGs, we assessed their assembly in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (CHX) (Fig. 2). Cycloheximide is an inhibitor of translation elongation that has previously been shown to trap mRNAs on polysomes, causing the disassembly of SGs (48Kedersha N. Cho M.R. Li W. Yacono P.W. Chen S. Gilks N. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). We observed that the addition of cycloheximide to AS-treated proliferative and senescent IDH4 cells prevented SG formation (Fig. 2, panels 9, 10, 21, 22, 33, and 34). Additionally, we observed that SGs can also form in senescent cells when exposed to other stresses such as heat shock (supplemental Fig. 4) or MG132 (22Mazroui R. Di Marco S. Kaufman R.J. Gallouzi I.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2603-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Because AS treatment did not affect both the general distribution of the β-actin protein (data not shown) and the elongated shape of senescent cells (Fig. 2 compare panels 25 and 26 to panels 29 and 30), we concluded that the increase in the number of SGs was not due to a disruption of the cytoskeleton-based cellular structure. Moreover, our recovery experiments clearly showed that these SGs disas"

Immortalized mouse lung fibroblasts lacking endogenous cPLA2α (IMLF-/-) were reconstituted with wild type and cPLA2α mutants to investigate how calcium, phosphorylation, and the putative phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) binding site regulate translocation and arachidonic acid (AA) release.

However, the subsequent influx of extracellular calcium was essential for stable binding of cPLA2α to Golgi and AA release. In contrast, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced low amplitude calcium oscillations, slower translocation of cPLA2α to Golgi, and much less AA release, which were blocked by chelating extracellular calcium. AA release from IMLF-/- expressing phosphorylation site (S505A) and PIP2 binding site (K488N/K543N/K544N) mutants was partially reduced compared with cells expressing wild type cPLA2α, but calcium-induced translocation was not impaired. Consistent with these results, Ser-505 phosphorylation did not change the calcium requirement for interfacial binding and catalysis in vitro but increased activity by 2-fold. Mutations in basic residues in the catalytic domain of cPLA2α reduced activation by PIP2 but did not affect the concentration of calcium required for interfacial binding or phospholipid hydrolysis.

In releasing AA, it performs a fundamental role in regulating signaling for a multitude of lipid-mediated pathways that control many important cell processes. Leukotrienes and prostaglandins are products of AA metabolism via 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways, respectively (6Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (3070) Google Scholar). These metabolites regulate diverse processes in normal and diseased tissues, making it important to tightly regulate the release of free AA through cPLA2α. cPLA2α is widely expressed in mammalian tissues, reflecting its central role in regulating lipid mediator production in diverse cell types. cPLA2α is regulated post-translationally by submicromolar levels of calcium and by phosphorylation (1Clark J.D.

Fergus D.J. Leslie C.C. BMC Biochem. 2002; 3: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Calcium binding to the cPLA2α C2 domain increases its affinity for membrane through hydrophobic interactions (28Perisic O. Fong S. Lynch D.E. Bycroft M. Williams R.L. J. Biol.

This positions the catalytic domain for interaction with the membrane by hydrophobic and electrostatic mechanisms (33Das S. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23838-23846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A tryptophan (Trp-464) on the membrane binding face of the catalytic domain stabilizes cPLA2α and prolongs membrane binding after decreases in [Ca2+]i (34Evans J.H. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6005-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A patch of basic residues (Lys-488, Lys-541, Lys-543, and Lys-544) in the cPLA2α catalytic domain is the site of interaction with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which increases catalytic activity in vitro (33Das S.

However, the role of these basic residues in regulating translocation in cells stimulated with physiological agonists has not been investigated. The goal of this study is to investigate the role of phosphorylation and basic residues in the catalytic domain in regulating cPLA2α. We compare the interfacial binding and kinetic properties of phosphorylated and mutant forms of cPLA2α in vitro as a function of calcium concentration with the behavior of these enzymes in a cellular reconstitution model. By expressing wild type and mutant forms of cPLA2α in lung fibroblasts lacking cPLA2α, we investigated the functional role of phosphorylation and the PIP2 binding site in regulating calcium-dependent cPLA2α translocation and AA release without interference of endogenous wild type enzyme. Materials-1-Palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC), brain PIP2 (major species is 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonyl-PIP2), and dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) (ammonium salt) were from Avanti Polar Lipids. Electrospray ionization analysis of PIP2 showed that it was not contaminated with dephosphorylated species. [14C]PAPC was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (catalog number NEC-765). Purified water was prepared with a Milli-Q system (Millipore). [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]AA (100 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences.

Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) potassium salt was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals. Mouse serum was from Atlanta Biologicals. Preparation of cPLA2α-Full-length wild type and mutant forms of human cPLA2α containing the affinity peptide YHHHHHH fused to the C-terminal Ala-749 were prepared by a modification of the procedure described previously (38Hixon M.S. Ball A. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8516-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (supplemental material). cPLA2α concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm (∈280 = 0.827 mg-1 ml-1 cm-1) (38Hixon M.S. Ball A. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8516-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the coding region in the baculovirus transfer plasmid was carried out first by deletion of the desired region and then by insertion of the mutated region. Both steps were carried out using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Full coding regions were sequenced to verify the products. Preparation of Dephosphorylated cPLA2α-Purified recombinant cPLA2α was dephosphorylated with potato acid phosphatase (PAP) by a modification of the published procedure (24Bayburt T. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3216-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (supplemental material). cPLA2α-PAP was shown by phosphoamino analysis to lack phosphoserine (supplemental material). Preparation of Phosphorylated Forms of cPLA2α-cPLA2α-505P and cPLA2α-515P were prepared by a modification of the previously reported methods (16Muthalif M.M. Hefner Y. Canaan S. Harper J. Zhou H.

Full details are given as supplemental material along with data showing that the phosphorylated forms are stoichiometrically phosphorylated. Vesicle Binding Assays-All phospholipids were stored in CHCl3 in Teflon septum-lined screw cap vials under argon at -20 °C. Concentrations of phospholipids were determined by the standard phosphate assay with ammonium molybdate(VI) tetrahydrate (for PIP2, the weight specified by the manufacturer was used). Stock solutions of phospholipids were mixed in a polypropylene microcentrifuge tube, and most of the solvent was removed (leaving ∼50 μl) with a stream of argon with the tube placed in a 37 °C bath. The tube was placed in a SpeedVac concentrator under vacuum for 1-2 h. All phospholipid mixtures used for binding studies contained 0.5 mol % lissamine rhodamine B 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine. Vesicles were prepared by freeze-thawing the lipid suspension (typically 4-6 mm phospholipid) in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 176 mm sucrose followed by extrusion through two 0.2-μm polycarbonate membranes (VWR catalog number 110606) using a LiposoFast device (Avestin), as described previously (40Bezzine S. Bollinger J.G. Singer A.G. Veatch S.L. Keller S.L. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48523-48534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A small aliquot of lipid suspension prior to extrusion was removed for fluorimetric analysis (see below). Extruded vesicles were submitted to a prespin procedure (1 h, 100,000 × gaverage, 21 °C) in a 1.5-ml polyallomar centrifuge tube (Beckman catalog number 357448). The supernatant was removed with a pipette and discarded, and the vesicles in the pellet were resuspended by gentle mixing (gentle up and down passage with a Pipetman, 8-10 times) in buffer A (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EGTA). A small aliquot of vesicles was diluted into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% sodium cholate and submitted to fluorometry (excitation, 550 nm; emission, 590 nm). The fluorescence value was compared with that of an aliquot of the vesicle suspension prior to extrusion to calculate the percentage yield of phospholipid, and this was used with the phospholipid concentrations in the original stock solutions to obtain the total phospholipid concentration of final vesicle suspension. Vesicles were used on the same day of preparation (stored at room temperature). cPLA2α binding reactions were prepared in 1.5-ml polyallomar microcentrifuge tubes and contained buffer A with 0.5 mg/ml BSA containing various amounts of free calcium (see below), phospholipid (added from the calibrated, prespun stock in buffer A), and 50 ng of cPLA2α in a total volume of 1 ml. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × gaverage at 21 °C for 1 h, and two 100-μl aliquots of supernatant were submitted to duplicate radiometric cPLA2α assays (see below). Buffer A containing various amounts of free calcium (0-5 μm) were prepared using EGTA/CaCl2 mixtures and calcium-binding fluorophores, as described (41Ghomashchi F. Schuttel S. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3814-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (supplemental material). The amount of cPLA2α in the supernatant above pelleted vesicles was determined using a modification of the previously reported radiometric assay (41Ghomashchi F. Schuttel S. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3814-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (supplemental material). An interesting feature of adding PIP2 to PAPC vesicles that we observed is that when the total phospholipid concentration was dropped from 200 to 25 μm, most of the PIP2 was found in the aqueous phase above vesicles that were pelleted by ultracentrifugation (see supplemental material for more details). This presumably reflects the relative high aqueous phase solubility of PIP2 compared with phospholipids that lack highly polar, phosphorylated inositol headgroups. cPLA2α Kinetic Studies-Vesicles contained [14C]PAPC at a specific activity of 2.7 Ci/mol (made by mixing [14C]PAPC (50 Ci/mol) with PAPC) and other phospholipids as noted. Phospholipids were mixed together as CHCl3 solutions, and solvent was removed as described above. Buffer A was added to the dry lipid film, and vesicles were prepared by freeze-thawing followed by extrusion as described above. Extruded vesicles were diluted typically 20-fold into buffer A containing 0.5 mg/ml BSA and various concentrations of calcium (see above) to give a volume of 0.1 ml. Tubes were prewarmed in a 37 °C bath for 5 min, and reactions were started by adding a 2-μl aliquot of enzyme stock containing 200-250 ng of cPLA2α (enzyme stocks were made by fresh dilution into buffer A containing 1 mg/ml BSA). Reactions were quenched after 2 min, and released 14C-labeled AA was measured after extraction and silica chromatography as previously described (41Ghomashchi F. Schuttel S. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3814-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Production of DNA Constructs and Recombinant Adenovirus-Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-cPLA2α was inserted into AdEasy vector (Qbiogene) and titered as described previously (42Stewart A. Ghosh M. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29526-29536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). DNAs encoding monomeric (A206K) wild type enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)- and enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP)-cPLA2α were inserted into the pVQAd5CMVK-NpA shuttle plasmid (ViraQuest, Inc.). The EYFP-cPLA2α construct was used to generate by site-directed mutagenesis the following mutants: S505A, S727A, S515A, S505A/S727A, S505A/S727A/S515A, K488N/K543N/K544N, and D43N. Constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Adenoviruses were generated by ViraQuest. Cell Culture and AA Release Assay-Lung fibroblasts were isolated from wild type (MLF+/+) and cPLA2α knock-out (MLF-/-) mice, and SV40-transformed MLF (IMLF) were generated as described previously (42Stewart A. Ghosh M. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29526-29536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). IMLF+/+ and IMLF-/- were plated at 1.25 × 104 cells/cm2 in 250 μl of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.29 mg/ml glutamine (growth medium) in 48-well plates. After 18 h in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, cells were washed with and incubated in 100 μl of serum-free and antibiotic-free DMEM containing 0.1% BSA (stimulation medium) and adenoviruses. After 1.5 h, 150 μl of stimulation medium containing 0.2 μCi/ml [3H]AA was added to each well. After 26 h, cells were washed twice, and fresh stimulation medium was added. When inhibitors were tested, they were added (10 μm SB203580, 10 μm U0126, 1 μm wortmannin, 10 μm KN93, 10 μm GF109203X, and 15 ng/μl CHX) at various times before stimulation with 100 nm PMA or 10% mouse serum. Culture medium was collected after stimulation and centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 rpm, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Cells were scraped into 50 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors, and the lysates were used to determine the total cellular radioactivity and to determine expression levels via immunoblotting. The amount of AA release into the culture medium was calculated as a percentage of the total radioactivity (cells plus medium) in each well. Microscopy-IMLF+/+ and IMLF-/- were plated at 1.25 × 104 cells/cm2 in 250 μl of growth medium in glass-bottomed MatTek plates and infected with adenoviruses for expression of wild type and mutant cPLA2α as described above. After 26 h, cells used for calcium analysis were loaded with 5 μm Fura-Red-AM for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of 0.02% pleuronic acid, washed, and incubated for 30 min in Hanks’ balanced salt solution containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2 mm probenecid. For some microscopy, cells were fixed for 15 min with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS containing 3% sucrose, permeabilized for 30 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked in 5% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 1 h. Golgi was labeled using anti-giantin primary antibody (1:200 in blocking solution, 1 h), followed by a Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100 in blocking solution; 1 h). Microscopy was conducted on an inverted Zeiss 200 M microscope driven by Intelligent Imaging Innovations Inc. (3I) software (Slidebook 4.1). Fluorescence data were calculated by subtracting background fluorescence, and correcting for differential bleaching at each wavelength. Calcium ratios were corrected for background fluorescence values. Immunoblotting-For Western blotting, cell lysates were prepared in ice cold buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid reagent. Lysates were diluted in Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min at 100 °C. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.25% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated overnight with a 1:5,000 dilution of antiserum to total cPLA2α, 1:1,000 of phosphospecific cPLA2α antiserum, or 1:1,000 of anti-p38 or anti-phospho-ERK antibodies. Antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer. Immunoreactive protein was detected using the Amersham Biosciences anti-rabbit secondary antibody and ECL system. Regulation of cPLA2α in IMLF+/+ Stimulated with Serum and PMA-To study the role of calcium and phosphorylation in regulating cPLA2α, we chose to use serum and PMA as agonists. They both trigger AA release and activate extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERKs) in fibroblasts (43Frost J.A. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. Feramisco J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mature virions consist of RNA genome, nucleocapsid protein, RNA polymerase, and two transmembrane glycoproteins, G1 and G2. The ectodomain of G1 is surface-exposed; however, it has a 142-residue C-terminal cytoplasmic tail that plays important roles in viral assembly and host-pathogen interaction. Here we show by NMR, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and mutagenesis that a highly conserved cysteine/histidine-rich region in the G1 tail of hantaviruses forms two CCHC-type classical zinc fingers. Unlike classical zinc fingers, however, the two G1 zinc fingers are intimately joined together, forming a compact domain with a unique fold.

Many viruses in the family Bunyaviridae, which consists of five genera (Hantavirus, Orthobunyavirus, Nairovirus, Phlebovirus, and Tospovirus), cause emerging zoonotic infections in humans (1Elliott R.M. Bouloy M. Calisher C.H. Goldbach R. Moyer J.T. Nichol S.T. Pettersson R. Plyusnin A. Schmaljohn C. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Fauquet C.M. Bishop D.H.L. Carsten E.B. Estes M.K. Lemon S.M. Maniloff J.

Examples are the La Crosse encephalitis orthobunyavirus, Rift Valley fever phlebovirus, and the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever nairovirus (tospoviruses are plant pathogens). Hantaviruses use rodents as their primary reservoir, and although some (e.g. Prospect Hill virus) are nonpathogenic to humans, others (e.g. Andes virus) can cause either the hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome or the hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in humans (1Elliott R.M.

Dis. 2006; 19: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Bunyaviridae viruses are enveloped and have three genomic RNA molecules: the small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments, and four viral proteins: the RNA polymerase, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and the membrane glycoproteins, G1 and G2 (1Elliott R.M. Bouloy M. Calisher C.H. Goldbach R. Moyer J.T. Nichol S.T. Pettersson R. Plyusnin A. Schmaljohn C. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Fauquet C.M. Bishop D.H.L. Carsten E.B. Estes M.K. Lemon S.M. Maniloff J.

In G1 and G2, the N termini form the ectodomains, followed by single pass transmembrane helices, then the C termini or cytoplasmic tails project within the virions. Bunyaviridae viruses lack a matrix protein (4Elliott R.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 501-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), which link the membrane to the ribonucleoprotein among enveloped viruses (5Flint S.J. Enquist L.W. Krug R.M. Racaniello V.R. Skalka A.M. Principles of Virology: Molecular Biology, Pathogenesis, and Control. ASP Press, Washington, D.C.2000: 92Google Scholar). Based on this observation, it was suggested that the cytoplasmic tails of the viral glycoproteins might bind the viral ribonucleoprotein (6von Bonsdorff C.H. Pettersson R. J. Virol. 1975; 16: 1296-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, recent results have shown that the G1 tail binds the viral ribonucleoprotein in phlebovirus (7Overby A.K. Pettersson R.F. Neve E.P. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 3198-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and is required for packaging the genome in orthobunyavirus (8Shi X. Kohl A. Li P. Elliott R.M. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 10151-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the G1 tail plays a critical role in viral assembly.Other reports suggest that among hantaviruses, the G1 tail is important in host-pathogen interaction. The G1 tail of human pathogenic hantaviruses inhibits the cellular interferon response (9Alff P.J. Gavrilovskaya I.N. Gorbunova E. Endriss K. Chong Y. Geimonen E. Sen N. Reich N.C. Mackow E.R. J.

Mackow E.R. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 9115-9122Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In nonpathogenic hantaviruses, by contrast, the interferon response is activated (9Alff P.J. Gavrilovskaya I.N.

Rollin P.E. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 2769-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The G1 tail contains conserved immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions in the cellular immune response to viral infection (12Geimonen E. LaMonica R. Springer K. Farooqui Y. Gavrilovskaya I.N. Mackow E.R. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1638-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Further, the G1 tail of pathogenic hantaviruses is ubiquitinated and proteasomally degraded (13Geimonen E. Fernandez I. Gavrilovskaya I.N. Mackow E.R. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 10760-10868Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which is thought to regulate the activity of the G1 tail (13Geimonen E. Fernandez I. Gavrilovskaya I.N. Mackow E.R. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 10760-10868Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas the nonpathogenic hantavirus G1 tail is stable.The G1 tail varies in length from 78 residues in orthobunyaviruses to 142 residues among hantaviruses. Sequence alignment shows a region of conserved cysteine and histidine residues in the G1 tail of Bunyaviridae. Further, this region was predicted to form a RING finger motif in the G1 tail of hantavirus (14Sen N. Sen A. Mackow E.R. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 4323-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here, we show by NMR that the conserved cysteine/histidine region in the G1 tail of hantaviruses forms two classical ββα-fold zinc fingers (15Wuttke D.S. Foster M.P. Case D.A. Gottesfeld J.M.

We also discuss the implication of our structural findings of the hantavirus G1 tail in the context of viral assembly and host pathogen interaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification-The cysteine/histidine-rich region (residues 543–599) of the G1 tail of the Andes virus (strain 23) and Prospect Hill virus was subcloned into pET-21a (Novagen) as a C-terminal fusion to a His6-tagged GB1 domain separated by a TEV protease cleavage site. GB1 is the B1 immunoglobulin-binding domain of Streptococcus protein G (19Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2359-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and a GB1 expression plasmid (obtained from Peter E. Wright, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California) was used in the subcloning. Isotopically (15N or 15N, 13C) labeled protein was overexpressed in bacteria as follows: Freshly transformed Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was grown in 1 liter M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.1 mm ZnSO4 before and after induction. The cells were grown at 37 °C, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalacto-pyranoside at A600 =∼0.8, and protein expression was continued at 15 °C overnight (to a final A600 of ∼2.0). The cells were centrifuged, resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 2The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; HMQC, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy. 0.1 mm ZnSO4), and lysed by sonication. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and to the supernatant was added one-tenth volume of 1% polyethyleneimine (pH 8) to precipitate the nucleic acids. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a 5-ml HiTrap Q column (GE Healthcare), and bound protein was eluted with a 100 ml linear gradient of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ZnSO4). Fractions containing the fusion protein were pooled and dialyzed against TEV digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ZnSO4). TEV digestion was carried out at 25 °C for 16 h with 0.16 mg of recombinant TEV protease (20Geisbrecht B.V. Bouyain S. Pop M. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 46: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) per 10 ml of fusion protein. The His6-tagged GB1 domain was removed by passing the digest through a 1-ml nickel affinity column (I1408; Sigma); purified G1543–599 was recovered in the flow-through. Recombinant G1543–599 zinc finger retained two extra N-terminal amino acids (Gly-His) resulting from the subcloning.Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). In total, 7 cysteine and 5 histidine residues (4 native His residues and the cloning artifact, His542) were mutated individually to serine or phenylalanine, respectively, and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutants H542F, H553F, H552F, H590F, and C594S were expressed as soluble proteins and were purified by nickel affinity chromatography as previously described (21Wang Y. Boudreaux D.M. Estrada D.F. Egan C.W. St. Jeor S.C. De Guzman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28297-28304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mutants C548S, C551S, C555S, H564F, C568S, C573S, and C576S were expressed as inclusion bodies (despite the presence of the GB1 solubility tag) and were purified as follows. Inclusion bodies were resuspended at room temperature in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, and 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). Solubilized protein was dialyzed into buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 6 m urea, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm ZnSO4), loaded into a 5-ml nickel affinity column, and eluted with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 6 m urea, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, 1 m imidazole). Eluted protein was refolded using stepwise dialysis to remove urea. None of the mutant fusion proteins was cleaved. The two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC of GB1 in the fusion protein was used as a marker to determine the refolding of the fusion protein.RNA Binding Assay-Andes virus (strain 23) was used to inoculate a T175 flask of confluent monolayer of Vero E6 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 plaque-forming unit/cell and incubated for 14 days in a Biosafety Level 3 environment. The cells were harvested, and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (15596-018; Invitrogen), ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in water to a final concentration of 300 ng/μl. The presence of viral and cellular RNA was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR. Total cellular and viral RNA was incubated at room temperature for 15 min with increasing amounts of Andes G1 zinc finger protein and a known RNA-binding protein, PACT (22Patel R.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4379-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. Gaya Amarasinghe, Iowa State University) in binding buffer (10 mm NaPO4, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.6). Samples were mixed with an equal volume 50% glycerol and loaded in a 0.7% agarose Tris-borate gel for electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The gel was run at 70 V for 50 min in Tris-borate buffer, pH 8.3. The gel was visualized by staining with SYBR Green II RNA specific dye (Invitrogen).CD Spectroscopy-The GB1 tag was removed in all samples for CD spectroscopy. Each sample contained 5–10 μm protein in buffer (10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm ZnSO4). CD spectra were acquired in triplicate using a JASCO J-815 Spectropolarimeter at 25 °C and 50 nm/min scan rate. Titration with EDTA and ZnSO4 were applied to the same sample.NMR Spectroscopy-NMR data were acquired at 25 °C using a Bruker Avance 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe, processed with NMRPipe (23Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11386) Google Scholar) and analyzed with NMR-View (24Johnson B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 313-352PubMed Google Scholar). For NMR structure determination, the G1 zinc-binding domain of the Andes virus was used. Typical NMR samples contained 1 mm 15N- or 15N, 13C-labeled protein in buffer (10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm ZnSO4) dissolved in 10% D2O or 100% D2O. Backbone assignments were obtained from two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC (25Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) and three-dimensional HNCA (26Grzesiek S. Dobeli H. Gentz R. Garotta G. Labhardt A.M. Bax A.

Secondary structures were identified from the Cα, Cβ, C′, and Hα chemical shifts (29Wishart D.S. Nip A.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Side chain assignments were obtained from two-dimensional 1H-13C HMQC (30Tolman J.R. Chung J. Prestegard J.H. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 98: 462-467Google Scholar), three-dimensional HBHA(CO)NH (31Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 3: 185-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), and three-dimensional 13C-edited HMQC-NOESY (32Fesik S.W. Zuiderweg E.R.P. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 78: 588-593Google Scholar) (mixing time (tmix) = 120 ms). The tautomeric ring assignments of Zn2+-coordinated histidines were identified by 15N HMQC (33Pelton J.G. Torchia D.A. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). NOE cross-peaks were identified from three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (34Marion D. Driscoll P.C. Kay L.E. Wingfield P.T. Bax A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6150-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) (tmix = 120 ms) and three-dimensional 13C-edited HMQC-NOESY (32Fesik S.W. Zuiderweg E.R.P. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 78: 588-593Google Scholar) (tmix = 120 ms).Structure Calculation-NOE distance restraints were classified into upper bounds of 2.7, 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5 Å and a lower bound of 1.8 Å based on peak volumes. Backbone dihedral angles in the α-helical regions were restrained to φ (-60 ± 20°) and Ψ (-40 ± 20°). Initial structures were generated by torsion angle dynamics in CYANA (35Guntert P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar), followed by molecular dynamics and simulated annealing in AMBER7 (52), first in vacuo and then with the generalized Born potential to account for the effect of solvent during structure calculation. Tight distance restraints that imposed tetrahedral Zn2+ coordination to Cys and His residues were used in the CYANA calculations (36Hoffman R.C. Xu R.X. Klevit R.E. Herriott J.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 102B: 61-72Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Structural calculations were also done without Zn2+ restraints to confirm that the domain could fold from NOE-derived restraints only. CYANA and AMBER structure calculation protocols have been described elsewhere (37Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M. De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Iterative cycles of AMBER calculations followed by refinement of NMR-derived restraints were performed until the structures converged with low restraint violations and good statistics in the Ramachandran plot. A family of 20 lowest energy structures was analyzed using PROCHECK (38Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar), and the graphics were generated using Pymol (39DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar).RESULTSProtein Expression-Sequence analysis of the G1 cytoplasmic tail of hantaviruses revealed two highly conserved CX2CX12–13-HX3C (where X is any amino acid) motifs, which suggested the presence of two CCHC-type zinc fingers (Fig. 1). Expression of the Andes virus G1 zinc fingers (residues 543–599) in E. coli resulted in cell death, with cell density reaching only A600 of ∼0.9 after induction at A600 of ∼0.8, suggesting that the zinc finger was toxic to E. coli. Thus, the zinc finger domain was expressed as a GB1 fusion protein. The GB1 tag contained His6 for nickel affinity purification and a TEV protease cleavage site to recover the native G1 zinc finger domain. The fusion protein was overexpressed in soluble form in E. coli, purified under native conditions, and digested with TEV protease to obtain the G1 zinc finger domain.Zn2+ Is Required for Proper Folding-CD spectrum of the Andes virus G1 zinc finger showed a folded α-helical domain with local minima at 209 and 222 nm (Fig. 2). Titration of EDTA to a final concentration of 1.25 mm caused a spectral shift to 205 nm, indicating a partial loss of secondary structure. However, the minimum at 222 nm remained despite EDTA treatment, suggesting that although the global fold is disrupted by removal of zinc ion, some residual helical structure remained. Subsequently, titrating ZnSO4 back into the solution resulted in increased α-helical content, suggesting restoration of the global fold.FIGURE 2CD spectroscopy and titration with EDTA and ZnSO4 of recombinant Andes virus G1 tail CCHC-region (residues 543–599), which was expressed and purified under native conditions, showed that Zn2+-binding is required for the proper folding of this domain. Native G1 tail zinc finger domain showed a folded CD spectrum (open squares). Titration with an excess of EDTA resulted to an unfolded peak (at 204 nm) and reduced the helical peak (at 222 nm) (closed squares). The addition of 2.5 and 5 mm ZnSO4 yielded folded CD spectra (triangles and circles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NMR data were also used to confirm the requirement for Zn2+ coordination on the proper folding of the zinc finger domain. The Andes virus and the Prospect Hill virus zinc-binding domains purified under native conditions showed well dispersed and sharp peaks in their two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra (supplemental Fig. S1). After treatment with excess EDTA, peaks in the HSQC of the Andes virus zinc-binding domain deteriorated, showed residual peaks that differ markedly from each other with respect to peak intensities and sharpness, and displayed a collapse of the amide side chains (supplemental Fig. S1). In the presence of excess EDTA, the HSQC spectrum of the Prospect Hill virus showed a collapse of the backbone and side chain amide peaks (supplemental Fig. S1), which indicated that the protein was unfolded.NMR Structure Determination-We determined the NMR structure of the Andes virus zinc finger domain. The Andes virus G1 zinc finger domain showed an excellent well dispersed two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC (Fig. 3). Nearly complete backbone assignments were obtained from three-dimensional HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, and 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC. Analysis of the Cα, Hα, Cβ, and C′ secondary chemical shifts (supplemental Fig. S2) supported the presence of two short α-helices and two random coil regions flanking the central domain (29Wishart D.S. Nip A.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Side chain assignments were completed using two-dimensional 1H-13C HMQC, three-dimensional HBHA-(CO)NH, and three-dimensional 13C-edited HMQC-NOESY. There were four conserved histidines (at positions 552, 553, 564, and 590) that could potentially coordinate Zn2+ ion; however, long distance NOEs (between Cys548-His564 and Cys573-His590) indicated that His564 and His590 were involved in Zn2+ coordination. A two-dimensional 15N HMQC (33Pelton J.G. Torchia D.A. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) spectrum showed Zn2+ coordination through the His564 Nδ1 and His590 N∈2 atoms (supplemental Fig. S3). Manual analysis of three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY spectra identified 859 unambiguous interproton distance restraints. The NOE restraints together with 24 and 15 Ψ dihedral angle restraints and zinc coordination restrains (Table 1) were used in structure calculation and refinement with CYANA and AMBER. The 20 lowest energy NMR structures converged into a family of structures (Fig. 4A) with low restraint violations and good Ramachandran plot statistics (Table 1).FIGURE 3The Andes virus G1 tail zinc finger domain (residues 543–599) shows a well dispersed two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum, which facilitated the acquisition of additional NMR data sets and allowed resonance assignments and NMR structure determination of this domain.

Shown are the cysteine and histidine residues (yellow) that coordinate Zn2+ ions (gray) as well as the secondary structures (α1-α2, β1-β2). The dual hantaviral G1 zinc fingers interact with each other and form a single domain with a novel fold as revealed by DALI (40Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) and TM-align (41Zhang Y. Skolnick J.

In the first CCHC array (ZF1), residues Met546–Cys555 formed a β-hairpin that encompassed the first two coordinating cysteines (Cys548 and Cys551; Fig. 4B). Asp549 and Val550 formed the loop apex with the coordinating cysteines on either side of the β-hairpin. The structured region terminated at Lys559 where helix α1 began and folded back toward the β-hairpin and allowed the completion of ZF1 with His564 and Cys568 on the interior face of helix α1.In ZF2, the β-hairpin (Gly571–Thr580) contained the first two coordinating cysteines (Cys573 and Cys576; Fig. 4, B and C). The coordination site on the loop was partly formed by the positioning of Pro574 between the two. Strong Cys573 Hα to Pro574 Hδ NOEs indicated that Pro574 was in the trans configuration. A structured loop followed the β-hairpin and terminated at Glu584, where helix α2 began, and folded back toward the β-hairpin to complete ZF2 by coordinating His590 and Cys594 to the Zn2+ ion.A Novel Dual CCHC Zinc Finger-Unlike classical ββα zinc fingers, which fold independently of each other forming a “beads-on-a-string” configuration, the two G1 zinc fingers interacted with each other, forming a compact structure in which the two zinc atoms were located a mere 10 Å apart (Fig. 4). Two short, parallel helices of 8 and 9 residues in length were linked by a 15-residue β-hairpin extending between Cys568 of helix α1 and Thr583 of helix α2. Another loop preceded helix 1 and an unstructured tail of 7 residues followed helix 2. Both zinc coordination sites were formed at the junction of a loop and the face of a proximal α-helix. Structural searches using DALI (40Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) and TM-align (41Zhang Y. Skolnick J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2302-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar) returned no homologous structures; thus, the G1 zinc finger domain has a novel fold.Mutations of Zn2+-coordinating Residues-To confirm the Zn2+ coordination topology indicated by the NMR structure, we created point mutants in each of the cysteine and histidine residues within the Andes virus zinc finger domain. Of the 8 residues expected to coordinate zinc, only C594S and H590F expressed as soluble proteins, the rest (C548S, C551S, H564F, C568S, C573S, and C576S) could be expressed only as inclusion bodies despite the presence of the GB1 solubility tag. This result suggested that zinc coordination was necessary for stabilizing the overall fold of the zinc finger domain. For further analysis, all of the inclusion bodies were solubilized overnight in 8 m urea, purified by nickel affinity chromatography, and refolded by stepwise dialysis to remove urea. Refolding of the zinc finger domain was determined by the proper refolding of the attached GB1 tag using two-dimensional 15N HSQC, which served as a control to show that the refolding conditions would have properly refolded a native protein. The spectra of the mutated G1 zinc finger domain in the GB1 fusion proteins consisting of C548S,"
https://openalex.org/W2072780086,"Replication of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is subject to regulation by cellular protein kinases. Recently, we and others reported that inhibition of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) or the viral CDK ortholog pUL97 can induce intranuclear speckled aggregation of the viral mRNA export factor, pUL69. Here we provide the first evidence for a direct regulatory role of CDKs on pUL69 functionality. Although replication of all HCMV strains was dependent on CDK activity, we found strain-specific differences in the amount of CDK inhibitor-induced pUL69 aggregate formation. In all cases analyzed, the inhibitor-induced pUL69 aggregates were clearly localized within viral replication centers but not subnuclear splicing, pore complex, or aggresome structures. The CDK9 and cyclin T1 proteins colocalized with these pUL69 aggregates, whereas other CDKs behaved differently. Phosphorylation analyses in vivo and in vitro demonstrated pUL69 was strongly phosphorylated in HCMV-infected fibroblasts and that CDKs represent a novel class of pUL69-phosphorylating kinases. Moreover, the analysis of CDK inhibitors in a pUL69-dependent nuclear mRNA export assay provided evidence for functional impairment of pUL69 under suppression of CDK activity. Thus, our data underline the crucial importance of CDKs for HCMV replication, and indicate a direct impact of CDK9-cyclin T1 on the nuclear localization and activity of the viral regulator pUL69.

Primary HCMV infection of the immunocompetent host is usually asymptomatic, whereas severe disease can occur upon infection of the immunocompromised and immunonaive. HCMV is a leading cause of complications in transplant recipients and AIDS patients, and congenital infection may result in mental impairment and hearing loss (1Mocarski E.S. Shenk T. Pass R.F. Knipe D.M. Howle P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott/Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2007: 2701-2771Google Scholar).

Virology. 1997; 231: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Additionally, inhibition of CDK activity affects replication of HCMV and other herpesviruses (13Schang L.M. St Vincent M.R. Lacasse J.J. Antiviral Chem. Chemother. 2006; 17: 293-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Roscovitine, a purine analog that preferentially inhibits CDK1, -2, -5, -7 and -9, has been shown to decrease viral DNA synthesis and production of late viral protein and infectious virus (8Kapasi A.J. Spector D.H. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 394-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Sanchez V. Spector D.H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5886-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Bresnahan W.A.

Acta. 2004; 1697: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Roscovitine is therefore a useful tool to investigate the impact of CDK activity on viral replication and to understand inter-regulation between CDKs and viral proteins. Cross-talk between CDKs and other protein kinases during HCMV replication is one issue of current interest (15Herget T. Marschall M. Holzenburg A. Bogner E. New Concepts of Antiviral Therapy. Springer, London2006: 351-371Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). CDKs, particular serine/threonine kinases that become activated upon binding to cyclins, are involved in the regulation of multiple cellular processes. They can be subdivided into two major functional groups, cell cycle-associated CDKs and transcriptionally regulating CDKs. A prototype of the transcriptionally regulating CDKs is the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which is composed of CDK9 and cyclin T1 (cycT1). This complex is an important regulator of transcription through phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, thus allowing for transcription elongation (16Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The expression of many genes is regulated at the level of transcription elongation, and the activity of the P-TEFb complex is tightly controlled. For example, the association of 7SK small nuclear RNA and HEXIM1 acts as an inhibitor to P-TEFb (17Michels A.A. Fraldi A. Li Q. Adamson T.E. Bonnet F. Nguyen V.T. Sedore S.C. Price J.P. Price D.H.

Michels A.A. Bensaude O. Nature. 2001; 414: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), whereas autophosphorylation of phospho-acceptor sites at the CDK9 C terminus acts to stimulate and promote nuclear translocation of the P-TEFb complex (21Napolitano G. Majello B. Lania L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 197: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated the HCMV-encoded protein kinase pUL97 has structural resemblance (22Romaker D. Schregel V. Maurer K. Auerochs S. Marzi A. Sticht H. Marschall M. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 7044-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and activities similar to CDKs, and thus represents a CDK ortholog (23Hume A.J. Finkel J.S. Kamil J.P. Coen D.M. Culbertson M.R.

It was shown pUL97 phosphorylates and inactivates the retinoblastoma protein, stimulates cell cycle progression, and is insensitive to cellular CDK regulator proteins that normally attenuate CDK activity (23Hume A.J. Finkel J.S. Kamil J.P. Coen D.M. Culbertson M.R. Kalejta R.F. Science. 2008; 320: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Overall, pUL97 is an important determinant of viral replication (25Prichard M.N. Sztul E. Daily S.L. Perry A.L. Frederick S.L. Gill R.B. Hartline C.B. Streblow D.N. Varnum S.M. Smith R.D. Kern E.R.

Previous studies reported that deletion of the UL97 region from the viral genome or pharmacological inhibition of pUL97 kinase activity drastically reduces viral replication (24Marschall M.

Among the viral proteins identified as substrates of pUL97, the pluripotent regulator pUL69 appears functionally relevant. pUL69 acts as a transcriptional activator (34Winkler M. Rice S.A. Stamminger T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3943-3954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Winkler M. Stamminger T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8984-8987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a nuclear mRNA export factor (36Lischka P. Rosorius O. Trommer E. Stamminger T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7271-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and a mediator of cell cycle arrest (37Lu M. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 676-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hayashi M.L. Blankenship C. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2692-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recent studies show pUL69 binds RNA, has nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity, and recruits the cellular mRNA export machinery via interaction with the cellular mRNA export factor UAP56/URH49. This latter activity promotes cytoplasmic accumulation of unspliced mRNA (36Lischka P. Rosorius O. Trommer E. Stamminger T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7271-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 39Lischka P. Toth Z. Thomas M. Mueller R. Stamminger T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1631-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 40Toth Z. Lischka P. Stamminger T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1237-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). pUL69 is a phosphoprotein subject to phosphorylation by the pUL97 viral kinase (41Thomas M. Rechter S. Milbradt J. Auerochs S. Müller R. Stamminger T. Marschall M. J. Gen. Virol. 2009; 90: 567-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), although it is still unclear whether CDKs also play an important role in its phosphorylation. Against this background, it is significant that the CDK inhibitor roscovitine influences the intranuclear localization of pUL69 in HCMV-infected fibroblasts by changing pUL69 homogeneous nuclear distribution toward speckled aggregation (9Sanchez V. Spector D.H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5886-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence for direct targeting of pUL69 by CDKs, which modulates pUL69 nuclear localization and activity. Findings in support of this concept are the speckled nuclear aggregation of pUL69 induced by CDK inhibitors, colocalization of CDKs and pUL69 in HCMV-infected cells, and the direct in vitro phosphorylation of pUL69 by CDK-cyclin complexes. CDK Inhibitors and Reference Compounds-Roscovitine was purchased from Calbiochem. CDK inhibitors A14, A43, A50, A79, A98, R25, and R58 (aminopyrimidines) were provided by GPC Biotech AG, Martinsried, Germany. The following reference compounds were also used: Gö6976 (inhibitor of pUL97 and protein kinase C), Gö7874 (inhibitor of protein kinase C) (28Marschall M. Stein-Gerlach M. Freitag M.

All compounds were prepared in DMSO, except for GCV in aqueous solution, and aliquots were stored at -20 °C. Cell Culture, HCMV Infections, and Plasmid Transfections-293T and HeLa cells were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Human primary foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were cultivated in minimal essential medium containing 7.5% fetal bovine serum. HCMV laboratory strain AD169 and HCMV mutants GDGrX-baF4, GDGrP53, and 759rD100 (43Biron K.K. Fyfe J.A. Stanat S.C. Leslie L.K. Sorrell J.B. Lambe C.U. Coen D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

HFFs (∼2.5 × 105 cells per well) were infected as described previously (46Marschall M. Freitag M. Weiler S. Sorg G. Stamminger T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1588-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Transfection of 293T cells was performed using polyethyleneimine reagent (Sigma) as described previously (47Schregel V. Auerochs S. Jochmann R. Maurer K. Stamminger T. Marschall M. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Indirect Immunofluorescence Analysis-HFFs were grown on coverslips in 6-well plates (4 × 105 cells per well) and infected with HCMV laboratory strain AD169 or HCMV mutants GDGrXbaF4, GDGrP53, or 759rD100 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.5 or 1.0. CDK inhibitors were added to the culture media either immediately after infection or 24 h post-infection (hpi). Culture media containing inhibitors were refreshed every 24 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min, room temperature) and permeabilized using phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Triton X-100 (20 min, 4 °C). Primary antibodies were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C; polyclonal antibodies used were pAb-CDK1 (sc-954, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), pAb-CDK2 (sc-6248), pAb-CDK9 (sc-484), pAb-cycT1 (sc-10750), pAb-UL69 (34Winkler M. Rice S.A. Stamminger T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3943-3954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pAb-UL54 (recovered from human antisera), and pAb-UL97 (kindly provided by D. Michels, University Ulm, Germany); monoclonal antibodies used were mAb-CDK7 (sc-56284), mAb-SC35 (48Fu X.D. Maniatis T. Nature. 1990; 343: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), mAb-414 (directed to nucleoporins NUP62/152/90, Hiss Diagnostics), mAb-HSC70 (sc-7298), mAb 69–66 (directed to pUL69, kindly provided by W. Britt, University of Birmingham, AL), and mAb-UL44 BS 510 (kindly provided by B. Plachter, University of Mainz, Germany). Secondary antibodies used for double staining in green (Alexa 488-conjugated antibodies, Molecular Probes) and red fluorescence (Alexa A555-conjugated antibodies, Molecular Probes) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C (nuclear counterstaining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole Vectashield mounting medium, Vector Laboratories). Immunofluorescence data were collected by the use of an Axiovert-135 microscope at magnifications of ×630 (Zeiss). Confocal laser-scanning microscopy was performed with a TCS SP5 microscope (Leica). qPCR-Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) was performed (49Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (5040) Google Scholar) using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and corresponding software SDS (sequence detection system version 1.9). qPCR was used to quantify viral genome copies normalized against cellular genome equivalents in initial viral stocks, and supernatant was taken at various time points post-infection. Total DNA was extracted from virus-infected cells using the Wizard® DNA purification kit (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). qPCR was performed in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 5 μl of either the sample or the standard DNA solution. Additional components of the reaction mixture were 12.5 μl of 2× TaqMan PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems), 7.5 pmol of each primer complementary to a region within exon 4 of the IE1 gene locus (5′-AAGCGGCCTCTGATAACCAAG-3′ and 5′-GAGCAGACTCTCAGAGGATCG-3′), and 5 pmol of probe directed against the HCMV MIE region exon 4 (5′-CATGCAGATCTCCTCAATGCGCGC-3′). To calculate the ratio of viral DNA per cellular DNA equivalent, the cellular DNA was quantified in parallel using primers complementary to a region within the albumin gene locus (5′-GTGAACAGGCGACCATGCT-3′ and 5′-GCATGGAAGGTGAATGTTTCAG-3′) together with an albumin gene-specific probe (5′-TCAGTGGAAGATGAAACATACGTTC-3′). Both probes used were labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein reporter dye and 6-carboxytetramethyl-rhodamine quencher dye. The DNA standard for quantification of viral genome copies was prepared by serial dilutions of plasmid pHM123 containing the IE1 cDNA (50Arlt H. Lang D. Gebert S. Stamminger T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4117-4125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular standard was composed of albumin PCR products obtained from lymphocyte cell extracts (51Lorz K. Hofmann H. Berndt A. Tavalai N. Mueller R. Schlotzer-Schrehardt U. Stamminger T. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5423-5434Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The thermal cycling conditions consisted of two initial steps of 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 amplification cycles (15 s 95 °C, 1 min 60 °C). DNA extracts were analyzed in triplicate for each sample. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis-Protein interactions were analyzed using GAL4 fusion proteins (GAL4-BD, DNA binding domain; GAL4-AD, activation domain) in the yeast two-hybrid system as described previously (24Marschall M. Marzi A. aus dem Siepen P. Jochmann R. Kalmer M. Auerochs S. Lischka P. Leis M. Stamminger T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33357-33367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). An expression plasmid for cyclin T1 was provided by L. Lania (52Fraldi A. Licciardo P. Majello B. Giordano A. Lania L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 36: S247-S253Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for CDK9 and cycT1::CDK9 were subcloned from pACTII-T1 and pRc/CMV-PITALRE-HA (52Fraldi A. Licciardo P. Majello B. Giordano A. Lania L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 36: S247-S253Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 53Garriga J. Mayol X. Grana X. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y153 was used for interactor analysis, and the selection of clones was achieved by cultivation on media restricting growth to combined tryptophan/leucine prototrophy. Selected colonies were analyzed for β-galactosidase activity by filter lift tests. In Vitro Kinase Assay-Recombinant CDK-cyclin complexes CDK1-cycB1, CDK2-cycE, CDK7-cycH-MAT1, and CDK9-cycT were purchased from ProQinase (Freiburg, Germany). As a putative substrate protein, pUL69 was expressed in 293T cells, and cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) before pUL69 was immunoprecipitated using pAb-UL69 (34Winkler M. Rice S.A. Stamminger T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3943-3954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After washing with HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerin, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and standard assay buffer (125 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm MnCl2, 7.5 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol), immunoprecipitates were incubated with 20 μl of standard assay buffer, 1 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP, and 10 μl of recombinant CDK-cyclin complex (50 ng of CDK2-cycE, 200 ng of CDK1-cycB1, 200 ng of CDK7-cycH-MAT1, or 200 ng of CDK9-cycT; each diluted in kinase dilution buffer (500 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 2.5 mg/ml PEG20000, 10 mm dithiothreitol)) for 20 min at 30 °C. As a positive control for substrate phosphorylation, purified RB-CTF (C-terminal fragment of the human retinoblastoma protein) was added to reactions (1 μg). Reactions were stopped with SDS loading buffer and samples analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot procedures. Radioactive signals were detected by exposure to phosphorimager plates and quantified by AIDA software. In Vivo Labeling Assay-Proteins were labeled in vivo in HCMV-infected HFFs by incubation with [γ-33P]orthophosphate (150 μCi/4.5 × 105 cells) in the culture media. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and supernatants subject to immunoprecipitation (pAb-UL69). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blot as described for the in vitro kinase assay. Nuclear mRNA Export Assay for pUL69-A nuclear mRNA export assay, based on the export activity of recombinantly expressed pUL69, was performed with lysates from transfected HeLa cells as described previously (39Lischka P. Toth Z. Thomas M. Mueller R. Stamminger T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1631-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). CAT reporter assays were performed as described by Farjot et al. (54Farjot G. Buisson M. Duc D.M. Gazzolo L. Sergeant A. Mikaelian I. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6068-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The plasmid construct pDM128/CMV/RRE, encoding an intron-containing mRNA with the coding sequence of CAT, was used as a reporter of nuclear export activity. CDK inhibitors were added 16 h post-transfection. CAT protein expression was quantified following cell lysis at 48 h post-transfection and analyzed in triplicate using a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Applied Science). HCMV Replication Is Regulated by CDK Activity, CDK Inhibitors Induce a Pronounced Aggregate Formation of pUL69 That Is Quantitatively Different for Variants of HCMV-As described previously, the intranuclear localization of the viral regulator pUL69 is significantly altered in the presence of the CDK inhibitor roscovitine, with the formation of speckled nuclear aggregates induced in the late phase of replication (9Sanchez V. Spector D.H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5886-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This phenomenon was detectable for several strains of HCMV such as Towne (9Sanchez V. Spector D.H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5886-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), AD169 (41Thomas M. Rechter S. Milbradt J. Auerochs S. Müller R. Stamminger T. Marschall M. J. Gen. Virol. 2009; 90: 567-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A), and clinical isolates. 3S. Rechter and M. Marschall, unpublished results. For strain AD169, roscovitine treatment produced pUL69 aggregation in 67.3% of virus-positive cells (Fig. 1C). This phenotype varied in quantitative terms between AD169-derived virus variants GDGrXbaF4, GDGrP53, and 759rD100. As depicted in Fig. 1B, GDGrXbaF4 and 759rD100 contain a GCV resistance-conferring mutation in open reading frame UL97 (deletion 590–593) (44Sullivan V. Talarico C.L. Stanat S.C. Davis M. Coen D.M. Biron K.K. Nature. 1992; 358: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). GDGrP53 and 759rD100 contain a point mutation in open reading frame UL54 (A987G) resulting in cidofovir resistance (43Biron K.K. Fyfe J.A. Stanat S.C. Leslie L.K. Sorrell J.B. Lambe C.U. Coen D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8769-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 45Sullivan V. Biron K.K. Talarico C. Stanat S.C. Davis M. Pozzi L.M. Coen D.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and high level GCV resistance (Fig. 1D, GCV). When analyzing the nuclear localization of pUL69, variants GDGrXbaF4 and GDGrP53 were similar to AD169 with pUL69 aggregate formation in the presence of roscovitine (Fig. 1A, panels a–d and f–i). However in quantitative terms, the pUL69 aggregation of GDGrP53 was significantly reduced (38% of virus-positive cells, p < 0.01; Fig. 1C) compared with the parental strain AD169. As shown for AD169 and the variants GDGrXbaF4 and GDGrP53, an additional CDK inhibitor, R58, also induced a pUL69 phenotype similar to that induced by roscovitine (Fig. 1A, panels k–n). R58 is a strong inhibitor of CDK2, CDK5 (IC50 < 1 μm in vitro), and possibly other CDKs. The double mutant 759rD100 behaved differently, showing very little speckled aggregation of pUL69 in infected cells treated with roscovitine or R58 (Fig. 1A, panels e, j, and o). Quantitative immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated only 15% of 759rD100-infected fibroblasts showed pUL69 aggregates under roscovitine treatment, which represented a highly significant reduction (p < 0.0001; Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained with inhibitor R58. The UL97/UL54 mutant 759rD100 showed reduced replicative sensitivity toward roscovitine, demonstrated on plaque reduction assay (Fig. 1D, Rosco), but showed a strong sensitivity toward the second CDK inhibitor R58. This indicated that R58, although inefficient in inducing pUL69 aggregates in 759rD100-infected cells, mediated an inhibitory effect on viral replication, albeit through a mode of action that seemed independent from pUL69. The question whether observed differences between HCMV variants were due to major alterations in viral replication characteristics was addressed by qPCR. HFFs were infected with DNA-normalized viral stocks (i.e. viral DNA copy numbers per cell eq), and the kinetics of viral genomic DNA synthesis were determined as depicted in supplemental Fig. S1. The genomic replication curves of AD169 and GDGrXbaF4 were very similar, whereas 759rD100 and GDGrP53 showed a clear replication deficit throughout the period analyzed. This most likely can be attributed to the pUL54 DNA polymerase mutation of 759rD100 and GDGrP53. However, the qPCR data cannot fully explain the roscovitine-induced pUL69 aggregation phenotypes of the virus variants. Whereas GDGrP53 showed the lowest replication efficiency, 759rD100, but not GDGrP53, showed a clear lack of pUL69 aggregate formation. Thus, the phenotype peculiarit"

Recently, it has been suggested that refrigerated food could be involved in disease development. We thus conducted a pilot case control study to explore the association of CD with the exposure to domestic refrigeration in childhood. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a standard questionnaire we interviewed 199 CD cases and 207 age-matched patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as controls. Cases and controls were followed by the same gastroenterologists of tertiary referral clinics in Tehran, Iran. The questionnaire focused on the date of the first acquisition of home refrigerator and freezer. Data were analysed by a multivariate logistic model. The current age was in average 34 years in CD cases and the percentage of females in the case and control groups were respectively 48.3% and 63.7%. Patients were exposed earlier than controls to the refrigerator (X2 = 9.9, df = 3, P = 0.04) and refrigerator exposure at birth was found to be a risk factor for CD (OR = 2.08 (95% CI: 1.01–4.29), P = 0.05). Comparable results were obtained looking for the exposure to freezer at home. Finally, among the other recorded items reflecting the hygiene and comfort at home, we also found personal television, car and washing machine associated with CD. Conclusion This study supports the opinion that CD is associated with exposure to domestic refrigeration, among other household factors, during childhood."

https://openalex.org/W2121729487,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective degeneration of motor neurons and glial activation. Cell-specific transcriptional regulation induced by oxidative stress may contribute to the survival and activation of astrocytes in the face of motor neuron death. In the present study, we demonstrate an age-dependent increase in Bcl-xL and Ets-2 immunoreactivity that correlates with an increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells in the ventral horn of the spinal cord in both ALS transgenic mice [mutant SOD1 (G93A)] and affected humans. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis verified that Ets-2 preferentially occupies the Ets-2 binding element in the promoter of Bcl-xL in primary astrocytes under oxidative stress conditions as well as in G93A spinal cords. Ets-2 small-interfering RNA down-regulated the transcriptional activity of Bcl-xL. In primary glial cultures, Bcl-xL overexpression and mutant SOD1 (G93A) both conferred resistance to oxidative stress-induced cell death. Our findings suggest that Ets-2 transcription factor activation of Bcl-xL gene may protect glia from constitutive oxidative stress that is thought to be a key mechanism contributing to the pathogenesis of ALS. This survival pathway may contribute to the glial survival and activation seen in the spinal cord of ALS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2002235740,"The GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory transmission in prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in cognitive processes such as working memory. Our previous study has found that GABA(A)R current is subject to the regulation of dopamine D(4) receptors, a PFC-enriched neuromodulator critically involved in various mental disorders associated with PFC dysfunction. In this study, we have investigated the cellular mechanism underlying D(4) modulation of GABA(A)Rs. We found that the density of surface clusters of GABA(A)R beta2/3 subunits was reduced by D(4), suggesting that the D(4) reduction of GABA(A)R current is associated with a decrease in functional GABA(A)Rs at the plasma membrane. Moreover, the D(4) reduction of GABA(A)R current was blocked by the actin stabilizer phalloidin and was occluded by the actin destabilizer latrunculin, suggesting that D(4) regulates GABA(A)R trafficking via an actin-dependent mechanism. Cofilin, a major actin depolymerizing factor whose activity is strongly increased by dephosphorylation at Ser(3), provides the possible link between D(4) signaling and the actin dynamics. Because myosin motor proteins are important for the transport of vesicles along actin filaments, we also tested the potential involvement of myosin in D(4) regulation of GABA(A)R trafficking. We found that dialysis with a myosin peptide, which competes with endogenous myosin proteins for actin-binding sites, prevented the D(4) reduction of GABA(A)R current. These results suggest that D(4) receptor activation increases cofilin activity presumably via its dephosphorylation, resulting in actin depolymerization, thus causing a decrease in the myosin-based transport of GABA(A)R clusters to the surface."
https://openalex.org/W2155249099,"Background In 2006, the Médecins sans Frontières nutritional program in the region of Maradi (Niger) included 68,001 children 6–59 months of age with either moderate or severe malnutrition, according to the NCHS reference (weight-for-height<80% of the NCHS median, and/or mid-upper arm circumference<110 mm for children taller than 65 cm and/or presence of bipedal edema). Our objective was to identify baseline risk factors for death among children diagnosed with severe malnutrition using the newly introduced WHO growth standards. As the release of WHO growth standards changed the definition of severe malnutrition, which now includes many children formerly identified as moderately malnourished with the NCHS reference, studying this new category of children is crucial. Methodology Program monitoring data were collected from the medical records of all children admitted in the program. Data included age, sex, height, weight, MUAC, clinical signs on admission including edema, and type of discharge (recovery, death, and default/loss to follow up). Additional data included results of a malaria rapid diagnostic test due to Plasmodium falciparum (Paracheck®) and whether the child was a resident of the region of Maradi or came from bordering Nigeria to seek treatment. Multivariate logistic regression was performed on a subset of 27,687 children meeting the new WHO growth standards criteria for severe malnutrition (weight-for-height<−3 Z score, mid-upper arm circumference<110 mm for children taller than 65 cm or presence of bipedal edema). We explored two different models: one with only basic anthropometric data and a second model that included perfunctory clinical signs. Principal Findings In the first model including only weight, height, sex and presence of edema, the risk factors retained were the weight/height1.84 ratio (OR: 5,774; 95% CI: [2,284; 14,594]) and presence of edema (7.51 [5.12; 11.0]). A second model, taking into account supplementary data from perfunctory clinical examination, identified other risk factors for death: apathy (9.71 [6.92; 13.6]), pallor (2.25 [1.25; 4.05]), anorexia (1.89 [1.35; 2.66]), fever>38.5°C (1.83 [1.25; 2.69]), and age below 1 year (1.42 [1.01; 1.99]). Conclusions Although clinicians will continue to perform screening using clinical signs and anthropometry, these risk indicators may provide additional criteria for the assessment of absolute and relative risk of death. Better appraisal of the child's risk of death may help orientate the child towards either hospitalization or ambulatory care. As the transition from the NCHS growth reference to the WHO standards will increase the number of children classified as severely malnourished, further studies should explore means to identify children at highest risk of death within this group using simple and standardized indicators."

These studies have revealed a role of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNAP II (POLR2A) in the coupling of transcription to pre-mRNA processing. The CTD is unique to POLR2A, as it is not present in homologous subunits of RNA polymerases I and III (9Corden J.L. Trends Biochem.

Cell. 1985; 42: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The highly conserved CTD comprises 25-52 heptapeptide repeats with the consensus sequence 1YSPTSPS7. This sequence can be highly modified in vivo via glycosylation, phosphorylation, and isomerization of specific residues (11Egloff S. Murphy S.

Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 289-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The repetitive nature of the CTD and its ability to be differentially modified has led to the proposal of a CTD code (11Egloff S. Murphy S. Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 14Buratowski S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This idea suggests that the modification state of the heptapeptide repeats can serve to coordinate transcription with pre-mRNA processing by recruiting the appropriate processing factors at appropriate stages of the transcription cycle (15Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar).CTD phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are critical for proper CTD function (15Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The hypophosphorylated form of RNAP II, RNAP IIa, is associated with the preinitiation complex positioned at the promoter, whereas the hyperphosphorylated form, RNAP IIO, is associated with transcript elongation and pre-mRNA processing (12Phatnani H.P. Greenleaf A.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2922-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The general transcription factor TFIIH phosphorylates Ser5 residues of the CTD soon after transcription initiation. RNAP II with Ser5-phosphorylated CTD repeats undergoes promoter-proximal pausing which is coincident with co-transcriptional capping of the nascent transcript (15Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S.

Subsequent work designed to examine transcription coupled and uncoupled from pre-mRNA processing demonstrated that CTD phosphorylation only impacted co-transcriptional processing and not post-transcriptional processing, strongly supporting a central role of CTD phosphorylation in coupling (23Bird G. Zorio D.A. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8963-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Together, these studies established that the phosphorylated CTD is required for efficient co-transcriptional pre-mRNA processing.Additional evidence supporting a role of the CTD in co-transcriptional pre-mRNA capping and splicing has been provided by several studies.

Furthermore, the capping enzyme can bind specifically and directly to the CTD (28Fabrega C. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol.

Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In addition, the CTD is required for the recruitment of splicing factors to the sites of transcription (30Misteli T. Spector D.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 697-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).

Another splicing factor, the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein, SRp20, has been shown to be dependent on the CTD for its effect on alternative splicing (35de la Mata M. Kornblihtt A.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recombinant CTD fusion protein (GST-CTD) has been shown to enhance splicing of pre-mRNAs recognized via exon definition (36Zeng C. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8290-8301Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Together, these data support a role of the CTD in the coupling of transcription to pre-mRNA processing, although the precise mechanisms by which the CTD contributes to coupling remain unclear.In this study we investigated whether the CTD was sufficient to enhance the efficiency of pre-mRNA capping or splicing. To address this question, we analyzed the CTD in the context of RNAP III and T7 RNAP. We show that the CTD in the context of RNAP III was unable to enhance pre-mRNA splicing or capping efficiency of constitutively or alternatively spliced transcripts in vivo. Purified T7CTD was not sufficient to enhance splicing efficiency, regardless of CTD phosphorylation, when analyzed using a previously described in vitro transcription splicing system (37Natalizio B.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Methods. 2005; 37: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that transcripts synthesized by T7CTD in vivo did not exhibit enhanced splicing or capping. These experiments strongly suggest that the CTD is not sufficient to enhance pre-mRNA splicing or capping in the context of a different polymerase. We, therefore, propose that other subunits of RNAP II or RNAP II-associated factors are necessary for the efficient coupling of transcription to pre-mRNA processing.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction-The plasmid DNA constructs used in this study were made by standard cloning techniques and verified by DNA sequence analysis. To construct pcDNA3.1/His-POLR3A, pcDNA3.1/His-POLR3A-CTD, and pcDNA3.1/His-POLR3A-LCTD, cDNAs of POLR3A, CTD, and LCTD were PCR-amplified from a HeLa cDNA library and subcloned into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen). The cDNAs were then cloned into pcDNA3.1/HisA (Invitrogen). A carboxyl-terminal SV40 T-antigen nuclear localization signal was introduced into the ApaI site of pcDNA3.1/His-POLR3A, pcDNA3.1/His-POLR3A-CTD, and pcDNA3.1/His-POLR3A-LCTD. The 5Sβ3 reporter plasmids (5S+I+pA, 5SΔI+pA, 5S+IΔpA, and CMV/5S+I) were derived from p5Sβ3, a gift of B. Sollner-Webb (38Sisodia S.S. Sollner-Webb B. Cleveland D.W. Mol. Cell.

The pcDNA3.1/HisXpress-T7CTD and pcDNA3.1/HisXpress-T7 mammalian expression vectors were derived from pcDNA3T7CTD, a kind gift of D. Bentley (21McCracken S. Rosonina E. Fong N. Sikes M. Beyer A.

An amino-terminal His tag and an Xpress tag were inserted by annealed oligonucleotide cloning. The β-globin plasmids, pBC12/CMV/β-globin and pBC12/T7/β-globin, used in both the in vitro transcription splicing assays and the in vivo transfections were described previously (37Natalizio B.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Methods. 2005; 37: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBC12/CMV/β-globin was used as the template for PCR amplification of the RNase Protection probe specific to intron 2 and exon 3 of β-globin. The resultant product was cloned into pCR4-TOPO. The reporter plasmid pI12-IIIc has been described previously (41Wagner E.J. Curtis M.L. Robson N.D. Baraniak A.P. Eis P.S. Garcia-Blanco M.A. RNA. 2003; 9: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The RNase protection probe for exon IIIc was generated by digesting pI12-IIIc with XhoI and HindIII and inserting the Xho/HindIII fragment into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene).Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins-For production of recombinant T7CTD and T7, pBH161-CTD and pBH161-T7 were used to transform Escherichia coli BL21(DE3).

The CTD was cloned as an amino-terminal fusion, as it is well established that T7 RNAP does not tolerate carboxyl-terminal extensions. Expression and purification of GST-eIF4E were performed as described previously (39Edery I. Chu L.L. Sonenberg N. Pelletier J. Mol. Cell.

Transient transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells per 10 cm2 well (BD Biosciences) 24 h before transfection. For the RNAP III transfections, cells were co-transfected with both the POLR3A expression plasmids and the 5Sβ3 reporters. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection. For experiments using α-amanitin, cells were treated with 5.0 μg/ml α-amanitin 24 h after transfection of protein expression plasmids. Twelve hours after α-amanitin treatment, cells were re-transfected with reporter plasmids, β-globin, or pI12-IIIc.In Vitro Transcription Splicing Assay-In vitro transcription and in vitro transcription/splicing reactions were performed as described previously (37Natalizio B.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Methods. 2005; 37: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).RNA Isolation and RT-PCR Assay of Transfected Minigenes-Total cellular RNA for RT-PCR and RNase Protection was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). RT-PCR analysis of the pI12-IIIc minigene was performed with 2 μg of DNase-treated total RNA. The primers used were UexF (5′-GCTGTCTGCGAGGTACCCTAC-3′) and DexR (5′-AGCTTAGGCTCTTGGCGTTC-3′). PCR products were resolved on nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels at 120V for 3-4 h followed by drying and exposure to PhosphorImager screens. Analysis was performed using Image Quant software (GE Healthcare).Ribonuclease Protection Assay (RPA)-Antisense [α-32P]UTP-labeled probes were transcribed from linearized plasmids by T7 or T3 RNA Polymerase Plus (Applied Biosystems). Probes were gel-purified on 8% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels and allowed to elute in high salt column buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS) for 4 h at 37 °C with shaking. After elution, probes were phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in hybridization buffer. Total RNA from transiently transfected 293T cells (4-20 μg) was hybridized to the probe at 65 °C overnight. As a negative control, yeast tRNA (Sigma) was used. Samples were treated with RNase A/T1 mixture (Applied Biosystems) for 1 h at 37 °C and phenol/chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated using yeast tRNA (Sigma) as a carrier. Samples were washed with 80% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in formamide dye. Before loading onto the gel, reactions were denatured by heating to 100 °C for 3 min. Products were resolved on 8% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels at constant power. Gels were exposed to PhosphorImager screens and analyzed using Image Quant software (GE Healthcare).Western Blot Analysis-Transfected cells were harvested in SDS buffer (58 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 1.6% SDS, 1.5% dithiothreitol), incubated at 100 °C for 10 min, and spun down at 14,000 rpm. Cell lysates were spun through Bio-Spin 6 columns (Bio-Rad) to remove SDS. Protein concentration was determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) or a BCA (bicinchoninic acid) assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide:bis). For phosphatase experiments, equal amounts of protein were treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 3-4 h at 30 °C and then resolved using SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred overnight onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 5% dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20). Primary antibodies were added for overnight incubation at 4 °C with the following dilutions: 1:5000 for V5 (Invitrogen), 1:1000 for His (Sigma), 1:4000 for PTB, and 1:1000 for hRPC155 (kindly provided by N. Hernandez) (42Sepehri S. Hernandez N. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 1006-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed 4 times 15 min each with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, probed for 45 min at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer (1:5000 for both ECL anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences)), and washed 3 times 15 min each in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and the signal was activated with SuperSignal West Pico or Femto Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Signals were detected on Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Biosciences) or analyzed with SynGene software.Cap Binding Assay-GST-eIF4E was expressed in BL21 cells, and the protein was purified using 7-methyl GTP-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (39Edery I. Chu L.L. Sonenberg N. Pelletier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3363-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Sixty micrograms of purified GST-eIF4E was bound to a packed volume of 25 μl of glutathione beads by end-over-end incubation for ∼6 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed a total of 3 times 10 min each with TST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). RNA was fractionated over the cap binding matrix essentially as described previously (43McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3306-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar).Primer Extension-An oligonucleotide complementary to sequence within exon 3 of the chicken β-tubulin reporter 5Sβ3 PE5 (5′-CACCGAGTCCATGGT-3′) was 5′ end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and γ-]32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 h at 37 °C. The labeled primer was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and then further purified over a G25 column (Amersham Biosciences). The primer was hybridized to 5.0 μg of RNA in 4.1% formamide at 50 °C for 1 h. Reverse transcription was performed with Moloney murine leukemia virus RT (Invitrogen) at 42 °C for 1 h. The cDNA was then phenol/chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated using glycogen as a carrier. Samples were washed in 80% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in formamide dye. Before loading onto the gel, reactions were denatured by heating to 100 °C for 3 min. Products were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels at constant power. Gels were exposed to PhosphorImager screens and were analyzed using Image Quant software (GE Healthcare).RNAi Experiments-Two small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes complementary to sequences within the 3′-untranslated region of POLR3A were ordered (Dharmacon). The duplexes targeted the following sequences: #1 (5′-CUGAUGUGAUUGUGGAUUA-3′) and #2 (5′-CAAGAAAGUCAGCAUGUAA-3′). The nonspecific siRNA duplex C2 described in Wagner and Garcia-Blanco (44Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 943-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) served as a control. All duplexes were resuspended to a concentration of 20 μm. RNA interference experiments in 293T cells were performed as follows. Cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells per 10 cm2 well (BD Biosciences). The following day cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions at final siRNA concentrations of 20 or 50 nm in culture. At 36 h post-siRNA transfection, cells were transiently transfected with POLR3A expression plasmids and the 5Sβ3 reporters as described above. Cells were grown for an additional 36 h post-transfection. At this time cells were harvested for RNA using Trizol (Invitrogen) and for protein using SDS lysis.Immunofluorescence Staining-Immunofluorescence was performed on fixed, permeabilized 293T cells. Cells were grown on collagen-coated coverslips (BD Biosciences) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h. All subsequent steps were performed at room temperature unless otherwise indicated. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS buffer, pH 7.4, for 15 min, incubated with 20 mm NH4Cl for 15 min, and treated with 100% methanol for 10 min at -20 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS and blocked in PBS containing 1% normal donkey serum (Chemicon) and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for 30 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies at appropriate dilutions in PBS containing 1% normal donkey serum and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for 1 h and subsequently washed with PBS and refixed with formaldehyde. Cell nuclei were identified by staining with Hoechst stain at 1:5000 dilution for 5 min. The coverslips were then mounted onto glass slides using gel/mount media (Biomeda). T7 RNA polymerase monoclonal antibody (Novagen) and anti-V5 antibody were used as the primary antibodies and were labeled with Zenon Alexa Fluor 488 or 555 according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Cells were analyzed by using an Olympus (Melville, NY) IX 71 epifluorescence microscope, and images were acquired by using an Olympus DP70 digital camera. Image processing was done with DP controller software (Olympus).RESULTSPOLR3A Recombinant Proteins Were Expressed and Phosphorylated in Vivo-To determine whether the CTD was sufficient to enhance pre-mRNA processing efficiency, we constructed fusions of the largest subunit of RNAP III, POLR3A. POLR3A and POLR2A are highly homologous (Fig. 1A), but the latter has an additional 580-amino acid extension in the carboxyl terminus which includes the 52 repeats known as the CTD (9Corden J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 10Allison L.A. Moyle M. Shales M. Ingles C.J. Cell. 1985; 42: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). We constructed cDNAs capable of expressing POLR3A, POLR3A-CTD, which had the CTD appended to the carboxyl terminus of POLR3A, and POLR3A-LCTD, which had the 110-amino acid linker region upstream of the CTD (L) and the CTD appended to the carboxyl terminus of POLR3A (Fig. 1B).We wanted to verify that the POLR3A recombinant proteins could be expressed in vivo. We transiently transfected our constructs into 293T cells and analyzed protein production via immunoblotting for the V5 tag (Fig. 1C). The results demonstrated that all three recombinant proteins expressed in 293T cells. The recombinant POLR3A accumulated to levels similar to those of the endogenous POLR3A (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. 1A).The POLR3A-CTD and the POLR3A-LCTD fusions migrated as two bands. We speculated that the slower migrating bands might be recombinant proteins with hyperphosphorylated CTDs. Indeed treatment of our protein samples with calf intestinal phosphatase led to the disappearance of the slower migrating bands and to an increase in the faster migrating species (Fig. 1E). We concluded that not only are the POLR3A recombinant proteins expressed, but similarly to the endogenous CTD of RNAP II, the CTD of POLR3A-CTD and POLR3A-LCTD was extensively phosphorylated. In addition, we determined the localization of the POLR3A recombinant proteins by immunofluorescence and observed that all three recombinant proteins exhibited both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization (supplemental Fig. 2).The CTD in the Context of RNAP III Was Not Sufficient to Enhance the Efficiency of Pre-mRNA Splicing-We inquired whether POLR3A-CTD and POLR3A-LCTD exhibited any of the functional activity of RNAP II with regard to the coupling of transcription to pre-mRNA processing. Although there is evidence that RNAP III transcripts can be polyadenylated (45Borodulina O.R. Kramerov D.A. RNA. 2008; 14: 1865-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), transcripts made by RNAP III are not substrates for splicing (38Sisodia S.S. Sollner-Webb B. Cleveland D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3602-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Several splicing constructs were generated that were derived from the 5Sβ3 plasmid (38Sisodia S.S. Sollner-Webb B. Cleveland D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3602-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These constructs contain the Xenopus 5S RNAP III promoter fused to a portion of the chicken β3 tubulin gene (Fig. 2A). We refer to these constructs as 5S+I, a β-tubulin intron-containing construct, and 5SΔI, an analogous β-tubulin intronless version of the construct. 5SΔI serves as a size control for spliced product. We chose to use primer extension to analyze our results, as this method would distinguish authentic RNAP III-driven transcripts from transcripts derived from cryptic RNAP II promoters. In agreement with previous studies, we did not detect spliced product when the 5S+I reporter was co-transfected with empty vector or with the POLR3A recombinant protein-producing vector (Fig. 2B). When the 5S+I reporter was co-transfected with either the POLR3A-CTD or POLR3A-LCTD constructs, we did not detect an increase in spliced product compared with transcripts synthesized by the recombinant POLR3A. Overexpression of any of the POLR3A constructs led to higher expression of the 5Sβ3 transcripts over background (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2The CTD in the context of RNAP III does not enhance pre-mRNA splicing efficiency.

https://openalex.org/W2030192991,"Secretion of antimicrobial peptides (AMPep) is a central defense mechanism used by invertebrates to combat infections. In Drosophila the synthesis of these peptides is a highly regulated process allowing their rapid release in the hemolymph upon contact with pathogens and the arrest of their production after pathogen clearance. We observed that AMPep genes have either a transient or sustained expression profile in S2 Drosophila cells treated with peptidoglycan. Moreover, AMPep genes containing AU-rich elements (ARE) in their 3'-untranslated region (UTR) are subject to a post-transcriptional control affecting mRNA stability, thereby contributing to their transient expression profile. Cecropin A1 (CecA1) constitutes the prototype of this latter class of AMPeps. CecA1 mRNA bears in its 3'-UTR an ARE similar to class II AREs found in several short-lived mammalian mRNAs. In response to immune deficiency cascade signaling activated by Gram-negative peptidoglycans, CecA1 mRNA is transiently stabilized and subsequently submitted to deadenylation and decay mediated by the ARE present in its 3'-UTR. The functionality of CecA1 ARE relies on its ability to recruit TIS11 protein, which accelerates CecA1 mRNA deadenylation and decay. Moreover, we observed that CecA1 mRNA deadenylation is a biphasic process. Whereas early deadenylation is independent of TIS11, the later deadenylation phase depends on TIS11 and is mediated by CAF1 deadenylase. We also report that in contrast to tristetraprolin, its mammalian homolog, TIS11, is constitutively expressed in S2 cells and accumulates in cytoplasmic foci distinct from processing bodies, suggesting that the Drosophila ARE-mediated mRNA deadenylation and decay mechanism is markedly different in invertebrates and mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2096549833,"Okazaki fragments are initiated by short RNA/DNA primers, which are displaced into flap intermediates for processing. Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) and Dna2 are responsible for flap cleavage. Replication protein A (RPA)-bound flaps inhibit cleavage by FEN1 but stimulate Dna2, requiring that Dna2 cleaves prior to FEN1. Upon cleavage, Dna2 leaves a short flap, which is then cut by FEN1 forming a nick for ligation. Both enzymes require a flap with a free 5′-end for tracking to the cleavage sites. Previously, we demonstrated that FEN1 disengages the tracking mechanism of Dna2 to remove it from the flap. To determine why the disengagement mechanism evolved, we measured FEN1 dissociation of Dna2 on short RNA and DNA flaps, which occur during flap processing. Dna2 tracked onto these flaps but could not cleave, presenting a block to FEN1 entry. However, FEN1 disengaged these nonproductively bound Dna2 molecules, proceeding on to conduct proper cleavage. These results clarify the importance of disengagement. Additional results showed that flap substrate recognition and tracking by FEN1, as occur during fragment processing, are required for effective displacement of the flap-bound Dna2. Dna2 was recently shown to dissociate flap-bound RPA, independent of cleavage. Using a nuclease-defective Dna2 mutant, we reconstituted the sequential dissociation reactions in the proposed RPA/Dna2/FEN1 pathway showing that, even without cutting, Dna2 enables FEN1 to cleave RPA-coated flaps. In summary, RPA, Dna2, and FEN1 have evolved highly coordinated binding properties enabling one protein to succeed the next for proper and efficient Okazaki flap processing.

During eukaryotic DNA replication, synthesis of the leading strand occurs in continuous fashion in the direction of DNA unwinding. In contrast, the lagging strand is replicated in a discontinuous fashion via short Okazaki fragments. Each Okazaki fragment is between 100 and 150 nucleotides (nt) 3The abbreviations used are: nt, nucleotide; pol, polymerase; FEN1, flap endonuclease 1; RPA, replication protein A; ss, single-stranded; SPR, surface plasmon resonance. in length. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ∼100,000 fragments are created per replication cycle. These fragments are initiated by the DNA polymerase (pol) α-primase complex, which synthesizes 10–12 nt of RNA followed by 20–30 nt of DNA (1Rossi M.L. Purohit V. Brandt P.D. Bambara R.A. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 453-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 2Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4041-4045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The pol α-primase complex is then displaced by the clamp loader, replication factor C. The toroidal sliding DNA clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and DNA pol δ are then loaded onto the DNA. pol δ then synthesizes DNA until it encounters the downstream Okazaki fragment. The downstream RNA/DNA primer is then displaced into a flap intermediate by pol δ. The flap must then be removed and the fragments joined to avoid genome instability (3Gordenin D.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 4Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Cell. 1997; 88: 155-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Removal of the primer is proposed to occur by at least two parallel-acting pathways in S. cerevisiae (2Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4041-4045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In one pathway, flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) cleaves the flap intermediate to create a nicked product for ligation (5Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Gordenin D.A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1618-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 6Garg P. Stith C.M. Sabouri N. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). FEN1 is a structure-specific, single-stranded nuclease that recognizes and cleaves at the base of a flap structure on both DNA and RNA (7Liu Y. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 589-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The FEN1-only model suggests that strand displacement synthesis by pol δ produces short flaps, which are successively cleaved by FEN1 until the primer has been removed. DNA ligase I then joins the resultant nicked product. Another model of primer removal involves both FEN1 and the nuclease/helicase Dna2 (8Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Dna2 possesses both single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) nuclease and 5′ to 3′ ATP-dependent helicase activities (9Bae S.H. Choi E.

Recently, it was identified as a major nuclease for resection of double strand breaks, in both S. cerevisiae and Xenopus laevis (22Liao S. Toczylowski T. Yan H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6091-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Zhu Z. Chung W.H. Shim E.Y. Lee S.E. Ira G. Cell. 2008; 134: 981-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, Dna2 was shown to physically interact with FEN1 (24Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Also, the overexpression of FEN1 rescued the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the dna2-1 nuclease-impaired mutant, and overexpression of Dna2 rescued the temperature-sensitive rad27Δ (FEN1-null) strain. Moreover, Dna2 interacts with the single-stranded binding protein, replication protein A (RPA), which is involved in both DNA replication and repair (25Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). RPA stimulates flap cleavage by Dna2, while repressing cleavage by FEN1. Based on these findings, Seo and co-workers proposed that pol δ displaces flaps that become long enough to be coated by RPA (8Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Once RPA is bound, Dna2 cleavage is required, because FEN1 is inhibited. After cleavage by Dna2, the shortened flap is then free of RPA but must be further processed because Dna2, unlike FEN1, cannot cut at the base of the flap. Instead it leaves a short flap of ∼5 nt (8Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 26Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which is removed by FEN1 to create a nick for ligation. The FEN1-only model is consistent with results obtained from the reconstitution of Okazaki fragment processing with S. cerevisiae proteins. These results showed that the coordination between pol δ and FEN1 is highly efficient, resulting in mostly mononucleotide cleavage products and the production of nicked replication intermediates for ligation (6Garg P. Stith C.M. Sabouri N. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Later, however, we showed that although mostly short flaps were created during strand displacement by pol δ, a minor subset of longer flaps arose (27Rossi M.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26051-26061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This subset reached a length at which RPA could stably bind, suggesting a role for Dna2 in processing at least some flaps. Relevant to this issue, Budd et al. (15Budd M.E. Reis C.C. Smith S. Myung K. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2490-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) showed that the elimination of Pif1, a 5′ to 3′ helicase, rescued the lethality of the dna2Δ strain in S. cerevisiae. Cell growth was even more robust when both Pif1 and Pol32, the nonessential subunits of pol δ, were simultaneously deleted in the dna2Δ strain. Significantly, the pol δ mutant lacking Pol32 exhibits decreased strand displacement activity (28Burgers P.M. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently shown that the addition of Pif1 in reconstituted Okazaki fragment processing augmented the subset of longer flaps that escaped FEN1 cleavage and were bound by RPA (29Rossi M.L. Pike J.E. Wang W. Burgers P.M. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27483-27493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Pif1 aids pol δ strand displacement in creating long flap substrates that require Dna2 nuclease function. Although the FEN1-only pathway is likely to be the dominant mechanism of flap removal, employment of both pathways appears to be critical to process and join all Okazaki fragments. A characteristic feature of both FEN1 and Dna2 is that they must enter a free flap 5′-end for substrate cleavage. If a double-stranded region or a streptavidin-biotin conjugate is used to block the 5′-end of the flap, then cleavage is inhibited (30Kao H.I. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50840-50849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 31Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Because tracking is required for cleavage, we previously tested whether a bound nuclease-defective mutant of Dna2, E675A, inhibited FEN1 cleavage (32Stewart J.A. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38565-38572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We were surprised to find that cleavage was not inhibited and discovered that FEN1 disengages the tracking mechanism of Dna2 to allow dissociation. FEN1 also dissociated Dna2 from RNA flaps, which Dna2 cannot cleave. Furthermore, we recently demonstrated the ability of Dna2 to dissociate flap-bound RPA (33Stewart J.A. Miller A.S. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31356-31365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a sequential dissociation of RPA by Dna2 followed by the dissociation of Dna2 by FEN1. Here we are investigating the significance of the FEN1 disengagement of Dna2 on relevant substrates of the proposed RPA/Dna2/FEN1 pathway. Dna2 binds but cannot cleave RNA (32Stewart J.A. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38565-38572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Additionally, cleavage by Dna2 produces short ∼5-nt flaps, which Dna2 cannot cleave. In this study, we analyzed these substrates for Dna2 binding and FEN1 dissociation of flap-bound Dna2. We also probed the role of tracking and flap structure for disengagement of Dna2 by FEN1. Finally, we tested the proposed sequential dissociation reactions by reconstituting the RPA/Dna2/FEN1 pathway with the nuclease-defective Dna2 E675A. Materials-Synthetic oligonucleotides, including ones with biotin modifications, were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. Radioactive [α-32P]dCTP and [γ-32P]ATP were acquired from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Both the polynucleotide kinase and the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, used for labeling, were purchased from Roche Applied Sciences. All other reagents were the best available commercial grade. Oligonucleotides-Primers used in this study are listed in Table 1. 32P was incorporated at either the 5′- or 3′-end of the downstream primers for visualization as described (32Stewart J.A. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38565-38572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For 5′-end labeling [γ-32P]ATP was incorporated using polynucleotide kinase, and for 3′-end labeling [α-32P]dCTP was added by the Klenow fragment. Substrates were then PAGE-purified and resuspended in 1× TE. Radiolabeled primers were then annealed in a 1:2:4 ratio of downstream primer to template to upstream primer to create a flap substrate. Substrates containing RNA included Protector RNase (Roche Applied Science) during substrate purification and annealing to prevent degradation.TABLE 1OligonucleotidesPrimerLength (nt)SequenceDownstreamaNucleotides shown in boldface type are biotinylated.,bRNA segment is shown in italic type.,cUnderlined nucleotide indicates the last annealed nucleotide.

Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16518-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Dna2 E675A was created using site-directed mutagenesis as described (35Budd M.E. Choe W. Campbell J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24203-24208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were overexpressed in E. coli and then purified as described. Surface Plasmon Resonance-Association and dissociation of wild-type Dna2 with a single-stranded segment of DNA was analyzed using a Reichert SR7000 dual channel instrument (Reichert Inc., Depew, NY). A mixture of N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide was used to activate the dithiol carboxyl surface of the sensor chip as described (38Subramanian A. Irudayaraj J. Ryan T. Biosens. Bioelectron. 2006; 21: 998-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Approximately 900 micro-refractive index units of Dna2 were then immobilized over one channel, whereas the other served as a control to detect nonspecific binding, refractive index changes, and instrument drift. Following Dna2 immobilization, the chip was inactivated by flowing 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5, over both chambers. The running buffer then consisted of 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 40 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 μm ATP, and 0.05% Tween 20. For association, ssDNA (D4) was run over the immobilized Dna2 at a flow rate of 50 μl/min for 3 min. For dissociation, the reaction buffer only was run over the chip for 3 min at the same flow rate of 50 μl/min. After each run the chip was regenerated for 2 min with 1 m NaCl in the running buffer to remove the bound DNA. Regeneration was verified by a return to the base line established prior to each run. The resulting data were then analyzed using Scrubber 2 software (Biologic Software Pty. Ltd.). Gel Shift Assay-Reactions contained 5 fmol of radiolabeled substrate and various amounts of Dna2 and/or FEN1, as indicated. The reaction buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, and 50 μm ATP. Dna2 was pre-bound to the substrate for 5 min at room temperature prior to the addition of FEN1, which was then incubated with the reaction for 5 min at room temperature. When streptavidin was added, it was incubated with the substrate for 10 min prior to the addition of protein, unless otherwise indicated. Reactions were then loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis at 150 V for 30–40 min. Nuclease Assays-Samples contained 5 fmol of radiolabeled substrate and various amounts of protein, as stated in the figure legends. The reaction buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, 50 μm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2. In Fig. 1A, Dna2 was bound to the radiolabeled substrate for 5 min at room temperature. Unlabeled substrate (1 pmol) was then added at time 0. At each time point, MgCl2 was added, to a final concentration of 2 mm, to initiate the reaction. Reactions were then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. In Fig. 5, RPA, Dna2 E675A, and FEN1 were mixed followed by the addition of the flap substrate. The reactions were then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. After incubation, all reactions were then stopped by the addition of 2× termination dye, consisting of 90% formamide (v/v), 10 mm EDTA, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 0.01% xylene cyanole. Reactions were then incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and loaded onto a 15% polyacrylamide gel, containing 7 m urea and subjected to electrophoresis at 80 watts for 1–1.5 h.FIGURE 5Dna2 E675A overcomes RPA inhibition of FEN1. RPA (200 fmol), FEN1 (0.25 fmol), and Dna2 E675A (10, 20, 100, and 200 fmol) were mixed followed by the addition of a 21-nt flap substrate (D7:U3:T3) (lanes 8–11). Denaturing PAGE was then used to separate the products. Lane 1 is the substrate alone control. Lanes 2–4 are substrate with Dna2 E675A (200 fmol), substrate with FEN1 (0.25 fmol), and substrate with RPA (200 fmol), respectively.

After electrophoresis, the gels were placed on filter paper and dried on a gel dryer (Bio-Rad) with vacuum (Savant). Dried gels were then exposed to a phosphor screen, visualized by phosphorimaging (GE Healthcare), and analyzed using ImageQuantMac, version 1.2. Calculation of Dissociation Rates-Data points in Fig. 1B are an average of five independent experiments and were fit using nonlinear least squares regression of either the single exponential decay Equation 1, y=a·exp(-b·x)Eq. 1 or the double exponential decay Equation 2, y=a·exp(-b·x)+c·exp(-d·x)Eq. 2 where y is the relative cleavage; a and c are the amplitudes of each dissociation curve, and b and d are the rates of dissociation for each curve. In Fig. 1C, data were fit using the Scrubber 2 software (Biologics Software Pty. Ltd.). Dna2 Dissociates Slowly from a Flap Substrate-Previously, we observed that FEN1 disengages Dna2 from a flap substrate to gain access for cleavage (32Stewart J.A. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38565-38572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To understand the details of FEN1-promoted disengagement of Dna2, we used a DNA competition assay and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to assess Dna2 dissociation (Fig. 1). We reasoned that if Dna2 dissociates slowly from flap substrates the disengagement reaction is likely to have evolved to facilitate rapid joining of Okazaki fragments. However, if spontaneous dissociation of Dna2 were rapid, the disengagement process has another purpose. To assess the rate of Dna2 dissociation from the flap, we incubated Dna2 with a radiolabeled 53-nt double flap substrate. After binding, an excess of unlabeled flap substrate was added to the reaction followed by the addition of MgCl2 at the indicated time points (Fig. 1A). Reactions were then incubated for 10 min to allow Dna2 cleavage. Because MgCl2 is required for Dna2 cleavage, the cleavage rate was proportional to the amount of Dna2 still bound to the labeled substrate at each time point. These results were compared with a control in which the labeled and excess unlabeled substrates were incubated prior to the addition of Dna2 (Fig. 1A, lane 12). A graph was then generated, and points were fit to an exponential decay curve to determine the dissociation rate (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 1B). Initially, we fit the curve to a single exponential decay equation, which showed a half-time of about 25 min (Fig. 1B, gray line). Based on the shape of the curve, we then utilized the double exponential decay equation and found a better fit (Fig. 1B, black line). This suggests two dissociation phases, an initial rapid dissociation followed by a much slower one. Based on the small amplitude (∼20% of the relative cleavage) and the short time frame (∼1 min), we believe that nonspecific binding or a weak binding mode accounts for the initial dissociation phase of Dna2. The second phase would account for the majority of Dna2 binding. Dna2 bound in this manner dissociates slowly from the DNA, with a half-time of about 40 min. These data show that binding of Dna2 to the substrate is quite stable. To further assess the binding and dissociation rates of Dna2 to DNA, we performed SPR. Dna2 was immobilized onto a chip, and various amounts of ssDNA were allowed to flow over the chip while association was measured (Fig. 1C). This was followed by a dissociation phase with only buffer flowing over the chip. A second surface in which Dna2 was not immobilized served as a reference. When we attempted to fit the curves, they did not fit a simple 1:1 binding model, suggesting a complex interaction between Dna2 and the DNA. Although we were unable to simultaneously fit both the association and dissociation rates, we could independently fit the dissociation rate using the Scrubber 2 software. Because the curves appeared strikingly similar to those in Fig. 1B, we fit the data 30 s into the dissociation phase. By doing so, we were able to bypass the initial dissociation phase and fit a 1:1 binding model for the second dissociation phase. Again, these curves suggest a slow rate of dissociation, with a half-time of ∼50 min. Both the excess substrate and SPR dissociation measurements clearly indicate that the half-time for dissociation of Dna2 is in the range of ½ to 1 h. These findings are consistent with the conclusion that, because Dna2 binding to the flap is stable, FEN1 has evolved the ability to disengage Dna2 to efficiently gain access to the flap base for cleavage. Dna2 Binds, but Does Not Cleave, Short RNA and DNA Flaps-Previously, we hypothesized that FEN1 evolved to remove Dna2 molecules that are unproductively bound to the flap. The need for disengagement is envisioned to arise at two stages of Okazaki fragment processing. Each Okazaki fragment is initiated by a short segment of RNA, 10–12 nt in length (1Rossi M.L. Purohit V. Brandt P.D. Bambara R.A. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 453-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The first stage requiring disengagement would occur during initial strand displacement by pol δ, when RNA flaps begin to emerge. Although FEN1 can readily cleave short RNA flap intermediates, RNA is not a substrate for the nuclease activity of Dna2 (34Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A bound, inactive Dna2 molecule could block progressive FEN1 cleavage. We previously showed that Dna2 bound but did not cleave a 30-nt RNA flap and that Dna2 was dissociated by FEN1 (32Stewart J.A. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38565-38572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here we employed a substrate with 5 nt of RNA on the flap and an additional 8 nts of RNA in the annealed portion of the labeled primer. This substrate simulates the initial partial displacement of the RNA primer by pol δ. The substrate was used to test Dna2 cleavage and binding. Consistent with previous findings, Dna2 was unable to cleave the RNA flap (Fig. 2A). By way of a control, we measured robust Dna2 cleavage activity on a 30-nt DNA flap substrate. We then tested the ability of Dna2 to bind the 5-nt RNA flap. Dna2 was incubated with the substrate, and the reactions were then analyzed by gel shift (Fig. 2B). The labeled substrate band shifted upon the addition of Dna2 to indicate formation of a higher molecular weight complex. Next, we assessed FEN1 dissociation of Dna2 on the 5-nt RNA flap substrate (Fig. 2C). Dna2 was pre-bound to the flap. FEN1 was then added with the Dna2-bound substrate. The reactions were then analyzed by gel shift to separate the products and determine which protein remained bound to the substrate. Because Dna2 is three times the size of FEN1, the bound complexes of these proteins with the labeled substrate are easily distinguished (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 7). With increasing amounts of FEN1, the bands were shifted from a Dna2-bound substrate to a FEN1-bound substrate (Fig. 2C, lanes 3–6). This shift is indicative of the removal of Dna2 from the 5-nt RNA flap by FEN1. These results suggest that FEN1 disengagement of flap-bound Dna2 would promote FEN1 cleavage on initially displaced fl"
https://openalex.org/W1977037012,"Glucocorticoid negative feedback of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis is mediated in part by direct repression of gene transcription in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expressing cells. We have investigated the cross talk between the two main signaling pathways involved in activation and repression of corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA expression: cyclic AMP (cAMP) and GR. We report that in the At-T20 cell-line the glucocorticoid-mediated repression of the cAMP-induced human CRH proximal promoter activity depends on the relative timing of activation of both signaling pathways. Activation of the GR prior to or in conjunction with cAMP signaling results in an effective repression of the cAMP-induced transcription of the CRH gene. In contrast, activation of the GR 10 minutes after onset of cAMP treatment, results in a significant loss of GR-mediated repression. In addition, translocation of ligand-activated GR to the nucleus was found as early as 10 minutes after glucocorticoid treatment. Interestingly, while both signaling cascades counteract each other on the CRH proximal promoter, they synergize on a synthetic promoter containing ‘positive’ response elements. Since the order of activation of both signaling pathways may vary considerably in vivo, we conclude that a critical time-window exists for effective repression of the CRH gene by glucocorticoids."
https://openalex.org/W2034438264,"Peroxisome proliferators, such as the lipid-lowering fibrates that function as agonists for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), induce liver tumors in rodents and may produce cholestasis in humans. Considerable attention has focused on peroxisome proliferator-induced hepatocellular carcinoma, a phenomenon not noted in man, whereas limited studies examine fibrates and other therapeutic drugs that induce cholestasis, a common finding in humans. Moreover, the mechanisms by which fibrates induce hepatocyte proliferation and cholestasis are still not fully understood. We have examined the role of hepatocyte retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha), an essential partner of PPARalpha, in modulating WY-14,643-induced hepatocyte proliferation and cholestasis. WY-14,643 treatment induced hepatomegaly in wild type (WT) mice that was also accompanied by induction of the expression of cyclins D1, D3, A2, and B1 and Cdc2 as well as inhibition of Wee 1. Such changes were either absent or greatly reduced in hepatocyte RXRalpha-null mice. Furthermore, neither WY-14,643 treatment nor RXRalpha deficiency affected apoptosis, indicating the importance of PPARalpha/RXRalpha in regulating Wee 1-mediated Cdc2/cyclin B1 expression for cells to enter into mitosis. WY-14,643 treatment also induced cholestasis and liver injury, which is evidenced by induction of alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and hepatic bile acid levels in WT mice. Hepatocyte RXRalpha deficiency protected the mice from WY-14,643-induced liver injury. WY-14,643-mediated induction of the small heterodimer partner, Mrp3, and Cyp3a11 levels was greater in hepatocyte RXRalpha-null than in WT mouse livers suggesting enhanced repression of bile acid synthesis and increased efflux of bile acids into blood for renal excretion as well as hydroxylation of bile acids because of hepatocyte RXRalpha deficiency. These data establish a crucial role of hepatocyte RXRalpha in regulating WY-14,643-mediated cell cycle progression as well as bile acid homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1970126591,"The mitochondrial cytochrome bc(1) complex is an essential respiratory enzyme in oxygen-utilizing eukaryotic cells. Its core subunit, cytochrome b, contains two sites, center P and center N, that participate in the electron transfer activity of the bc(1) complex and that can be blocked by specific inhibitors. In yeast, there are various point mutations that confer inhibitor resistance at center P or center N. However, there are no yeast strains in which the bc(1) complex is resistant to both center P and center N inhibitors. We attempted to create such strains by crossing yeast strains with inhibitor-resistant mutations at center P with yeast strains with inhibitor-resistant mutations at center N. Characterization of yeast colonies emerging from the cross revealed that there were multiple colonies resistant against either inhibitor alone but that the mutational changes were ineffective when combined and when the yeast were grown in the presence of both inhibitors. Inhibitor titrations of bc(1) complex activities in mitochondrial membranes from the various yeast mutants showed that a mutation that confers resistance to an inhibitor at center P, when combined with a mutation that confers resistance to an inhibitor at center N, eliminates or markedly decreases the resistance conferred by the center N mutation. These results indicate that there is a pathway for structural communication between the two active sites of cytochrome b and open new possibilities for the utilization of center N as a potential drug target."
