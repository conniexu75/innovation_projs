https://openalex.org/W2006048429,"During the cycling of seawater through the earth's crust along the mid-ocean ridge system, geothermal energy is transferred into chemical energy in the form of reduced inorganic compounds. These compounds are derived from the reaction of seawater with crustal rocks at high temperatures and are emitted from warm (</=25 degrees C) and hot ( approximately 350 degrees C) submarine vents at depths of 2000 to 3000 meters. Chemolithotrophic bacteria use these reduced chemical species as sources of energy for the reduction of carbon dioxide (assimilation) to organic carbon. These bacteria form the base of the food chain, which permits copious populations of certain specifically adapted invertebrates to grow in the immediate vicinity of the vents. Such highly prolific, although narrowly localized, deep-sea communities are thus maintained primarily by terrestrial rather than by solar energy. Reduced sulfur compounds appear to represent the major electron donors for aerobic microbial metabolism, but methane-, hydrogen-, iron-, and manganese-oxidizing bacteria have also been found. Methanogenic, sulfur-respiring, and extremely thermophilic isolates carry out anaerobic chemosynthesis. Bacteria grow most abundantly in the shallow crust where upwelling hot, reducing hydrothermal fluid mixes with downwelling cold, oxygenated seawater. The predominant production of biomass, however, is the result of symbiotic associations between chemolithotrophic bacteria and certain invertebrates, which have also been found as fossils in Cretaceous sulfide ores of ophiolite deposits."
https://openalex.org/W2165089493,"Hydrothermal vent communities characterized by large clams, mussels, and vestimentiferan worms thrive on chemosynthetic microbial production. There are similarities in the animal distributions at vent communities from 20 degrees S to 46 degrees N on the Mid-Ocean Ridge in the Pacific Ocean and at cold sulfide seeps in the Gulf of Mexico. Vent communities, consisting of at least 16 previously unknown families of invertebrates, are at least 200 million years old. Since the life-span of a vent is only tens of years, the species survive by rapid growth and widespread dispersal of larvae with the subsequent colonization of new vents."
https://openalex.org/W2038285603,A new fossil of the primate Amphipithecus mogaungensis Colbert from the late Eocene of Burma shows that this species has a mandibular and molar morphology very similar to Oligocene and post-Oligocene higher primates. It has an exceptionally deep jaw. Its brachybunodont first and second molars have smooth enamel but lack hypoconulids. The shape of its second molar is nearly square-an advanced higher primate feature. Amphipithecus mogaungensis and related taxon Pondaungia cotteri Pilgrim are the earliest known higher primates. They suggest that Southeast Asia was an early theater of higher primate diversification.

Currents from 150 to 4000 meters below the surface at frequencies from 0.01 to 0.1 cycle per day are significantly correlated with the wind stress curl derived from U.S. Navy operational wind fields. The horizontal currents are depth-independent below 300 meters, and they flow parallel to the potential vorticity gradient derived from the earth's rotation and the large-scale bottom topography. These characteristics are expected for such periodic motions with horizontal scales larger than 500 kilometers and represent a generalized Sverdrup balance between the atmospheric forcing and the oceanic response."

Nakamura, M. Takanami, and S. Higashi. This work was supported in part by a grant from the Science Research Fund No. 4009, Ministry of Education. Drosophila melanogaster (2), Tenebrio molitor, and Tenebrium confusum (3), which require both tryptophan and niacin in their larval growth. This paper reports an increase of the amount of niacin and niacinamide during the metamorphosis of the pupal stage in the silkworm Bombyx mori. We determined these two substances in various stages of the pupa, which live for a considerable period (7-12 days) without food. Female pupae of the Japanese and Chinese hybrid (J 115 x C 108) were used. The samples were kept at a constant temperature of 280 C. The determination of niacinalnide was made by Kato and Shimizu's method (4), and that of total niacin by the microbiologic assay method, using Lactobacillus arabinosus. The results of the experiments are given in Tables 1 and 2 and in Fig. 1. It was found that in the period from the second to the eighth day both the total niacin and the niacinamide reached a maximum on the eighth day, and that the amounts of these substances were twice as great as on the second day. They suddenly decreased on the ninth day. The formation of total niacin was found to be greater than that of niacinamide at each period. From the above results, we conclude that niacin and niacinamide are formed biosynthetically in silk-"

https://openalex.org/W2056980404,"One of the fundamental assumptions of modern physics is that physical laws do not change with the velocity of the frame of reference in which experiments are done. Two recent atomic physics measurements by groups at the National Bureau of Standards, Boulder, Colorado, and the University of Washington provide the most stringent limits yet on the magnitude of any violations of this assumption, which physicists call local Lorentz invariance."

The international character of the meeting was, in large measure, due to the continued support of the Rockefeller Foundation. The main topies under discussion dealt with nucleic acid structure, physical studies on viruses and virus metabolism, effect of ionizing radiations on biological systems, and protein studies. Twenty-two papers were presented at nine sessions. The first two sessions were devoted to a symposium on the structure of nucleic acids and certain nucleotides. Erwin Chargaff (Columbia University), Maurice Stacey (University of Birmingham), Gerhard Schmidt (Boston Dispensary), Waldo Cohn (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), and Hubert S. Loring (Stanford University) discussed the subject from various points of view. Dr. Chargaff first reviewed previous work of his laboratory on the structure of desoxypentose nucleic acids, which had led to the conclusion not only that the compositions of these compounds deviate in most cases very considerably from that postulated by the classical tetranucleotide hypothesis, but also that they differ from each other in a manner characteristic for the species (but not the tissue) from which they have been isolated. On the other hand, certain remarkable regularities in the relative proportions of the nitrogenous constituents were observed. Thus, all desoxypentose nucleic acids so far examined possess a purine-to-pyrimidine ratio of unity, and the same holds for the ratio of guanine to cytosine. The ATtype contains adenine and thymine, whereas the GCtype contains guanine and cytosine as major components. It was found that all the purines can be removed, yielding polymers composed of pyrimidine nucleotides (apurinic acids). In the instance of pentose nucleic acids (PNA), a branched structure with a polyguanylic acid chain as the backbone was considered. In the subsequent discussion, R. G. Wyatt confirmed Chargaff's general conclusions on the basis of his own analyses. He found that desoxypentose 1 Publication No. 8 of the Department of Biophysics. 2 For a report on the first Nucleic Acid and Protein Conference see E. R. Blout and P. M. Doty, Science, 112, 639 (1950). nucleic acids (DNA) from various animal tissues contain a small amount of 5-methyleytosine, the amount being characteristic of the species serving as the source. In contrast, the DNAs of several insect viruses were found to be free of methylcytosine. The nature of the linkages present in desoxypentose nucleic acids was discussed by M. Stacey, who pointed out that polynucleotide chains may be either straight or branched. They may be ruptured by various means, including ultrasonic waves and ion exchange resins. Upon chain rupture, RCHO-groups are set free, resulting in a positive Feulgen reaction, and the release of purine residues may be followed by the Dische reaction. Steric effects may arise from interaction between base (purine, pyrimidine) groups, leading to a partial stripping of the side branches from the main chain. The possibility of cross-linking by amino and enolic hydroxyl groups was considered. In the discussion, Chargaff pointed out that nucleic acids may also be considered as a form of polysaccharide. DNA, in contrast to PNA, does not appear to be highly branched, and it is possible that links other than phosphoric acid ester bonds are involved in the polymer DNA-structure. Stacey mentioned that D. 0. Jordan's work indicates some degree of branching in DNA. The enzymatic hydrolysis of ribonucleic acids, with particular reference to its bearing on the concepts of their structure, was discussed by G. Schmidt, who employed prostate phosphatase, an enzyme of high activity toward PNA. The hypothesis that PNA consists of a purine polynucleotide and a pyrimidine polynucleotide, which are linked together only at one point, was considered untenable on the basis of the results obtained by the enzymatic hydrolysis of PNA by ribonuclease and phosphatase. The action of ribonuclease leads to the conclusion that the core of PNA consists largely of purine nucleotides. PNA represents a highly branched structure, from which the ribonuclease removes terminal pyrimidine nucleotide residues. Studies on the structure of various nucleotides isolated from nucleic acids were described by W. Cohn and H. S. Loring. Dr. Cohn reported the discovery of new nucleotides from previously known nucleic acids from the work of his group on ion exchange adsorption columns. In addition to the separation of isomeric forms of adenylic, guanylic, cytodylic, and uridylic acids from yeast PNA, a fifth desoxypentose"
