https://openalex.org/W2055162988,"Although it is generally believed that the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (RB1) is an important regulator of cell proliferation, the biochemical mechanism for its action is unclear. We now show that the RB protein is found in a complex with the E2F transcription factor and that only the underphosphorylated form of RB is in the E2F complex. Moreover, the adenovirus E1A protein can dissociate the E2F-RB complex, dependent on E1A sequence also critical for E1A to bind to RB. These sequences are also critical for E1A to immortalize primary cell cultures and to transform in conjunction with other oncogenes. Taken together, these results suggest that the interaction of RB with E2F is an important event in the control of cellular proliferation and that the dissociation of the complex is part of the mechanism by which E1A inactivates RB function."
https://openalex.org/W2003465634,"Kindling, induced by repeated subconvulsive electrical or chemical stimulations leads to progressive and permanent amplification of seizure activity, culminating in generalized seizures. We report that kindling induced by electrical stimulation in the ventral hippocampus leads to a marked and transient increase in mRNA for NGF and BDNF in the dentate gyrus, the parietal cortex, and the piriform cortex. BDNF mRNA increased also in the pyramidal layer of hippocampus and in the amygdaloid complex. No change was seen in the level of HDNF/NT-3 mRNA. The increased expression of NGF and BDNF mRNAs was not influenced by pretreatment with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801, but was partially blocked by the quisqualate, AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX. The presumed subsequent increase of the trophic factors themselves may be important for kindling-associated plasticity in specific neuronal systems in the hippocampus, which could promote hyperexcitability and contribute to the development of epileptic syndromes."

https://openalex.org/W1604744894,"The specific cellular receptor for urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is found on a variety of cell types and has been postulated to play a central role in the mediation of pericellular proteolytic activity. We have studied the kinetics of plasminogen (Plg) activation catalyzed by uPA specifically bound to its receptor on the human monocytoid cell-line U937 and demonstrate this process to have properties differing widely from those observed for uPA in solution. The solution-phase reaction was characterized by a Km of 25 microM and for the cell-associated reaction this fell 40-fold to 0.67 microM, below the physiological Plg concentration of 2 microM. A concomitant 6-fold reduction in kcat resulted in an increase in the overall catalytic efficiency, kcat/Km, of 5.7-fold. This high affinity Plg activation was abolished in the presence of a Plg-binding antagonist. In contrast to intact cells, purified uPA receptor (isolated from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated U937 cells) was observed to partially inhibit uPA-catalyzed Plg activation, although activity against low molecular weight substrates was retained. Therefore, the cellular binding of Plg appears to be of critical importance for the efficient activation of Plg by receptor-bound uPA. Plasmin generated in the cell-surface Plg activation system described here was also observed to be protected from its principal physiological inhibitor alpha-2-antiplasmin. Together, these data demonstrate that the cell surface constitutes the preferential site for Plg activation when uPA is bound to its specific cellular receptor, which therefore has the necessary characteristics to play an efficient role in the generation of pericellular proteolytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2009087603,"Recently, we identified an inhibitory protein, E2F-I, that blocks the DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor E2F. We also showed that the adenovirus E1A protein reverses this inhibitory activity of E2F-I, thereby restoring the DNA-binding activity of E2F. We have now further purified this inhibitory activity and show that the most purified preparation of E2F-I contains a 105 kd E1A-binding protein. This 105 kd E1A-binding protein cross-reacts with two different antibodies against the retinoblastoma (RB) gene product. Moreover, the RB gene product copurifies with E2F-I activity. Taken together, we conclude that the product of the RB gene is a part of E2F-I and is involved in the regulation of E2F activity."
https://openalex.org/W1530822737,"ATP-dependent calcium uptake by isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles is inhibited by concentrations of free thapsigargin as low as 10(-10) M. This effect is due to primary inhibition of the Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase which is coupled to active transport. When binding of calcium to the activating sites of the enzyme is measured under equilibrium conditions in the absence of ATP, addition of thapsigargin produces strong inhibition. On the other hand, if [tau-32P]ATP is added to ATPase preincubated with Ca2+ under favorable conditions, significant levels of 32P-phosphorylated intermediate are still formed transiently, even in the presence of thapsigargin. The phosphoenzyme, however, decays rapidly as the calcium-enzyme complex is destabilized as a consequence of ATP utilization, and formation of the thapsigargin-enzyme complex is favored. Formation of the thapsigargin-enzyme complex is also favored by Ca2+ chelation with EGTA, with consequent inhibition of the enzyme reactivity to Pi (i.e. reverse of the ATPase hydrolytic reaction). Neither the Ca(2+)- and ATP-induced Ca2+ release from junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum nor the Ca(2+)- and calmodulin-dependent ATPase of plasma membranes (erythrocyte ghosts) were found to be altered by thapsigargin at such low concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2083181195,"A DNA-binding site selection and enrichment procedure revealed a sequence-specific DNA-binding activity selectively associated with glutathione S-transferase-retinoblastoma protein chimeras (GST-RB) that had been incubated with a human cell extract. Appropriate mutant forms of GST-RB, incubated in equivalent extracts, did not associate with this specific DNA-binding activity, and a peptide replica of the HPV E7 RB-binding segment selectively inhibited the association of GST-RB with the sequence-specific DNA-binding protein(s). Sequence analysis of oligonucleotides with high affinity for GST-RB complexes, as well as the results of competition binding studies, strongly suggest that RB can associate specifically with the transcription factor E2F or with a protein having closely related DNA-binding properties."
https://openalex.org/W2084815044,"We have examined E2F binding activity in extracts of synchronizedNIH 3T3 cells. During the G0 to G1 transition, there is a marked increase in the level of active E2F. Subsequently, there are changes in the nature of E2F-containing complexes. A G1-specific complex increases in abundance, disappears, and is then replaced by another complex as S phase begins. Analysis of extracts of thymidine-blocked cells confirms that the complexes are cell cycle regulated. We also show that the cyclin A protein is a component of the S phase complex. Each complex can be dissociated by the adenovirus E1A 12S product, releasing free E2F. The release of E2F from the cyclin A complex coincides with the stimulation of an E2F-dependent promoter. We suggest that these interactions control the activity of E2F and that disruption of the complexes by E1A contributes to a loss of cellular proliferation control."
https://openalex.org/W2014012740,"Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal T cells (dECs) express invariant gamma delta antigen receptors and are found in intimate contact with keratinocytes in murine epidermis--thus raising the possibility that keratinocytes express a ligand for the antigen receptor of these T cells. Thy-1+ dECs were stimulated to produce lymphokines by interaction with keratinocytes in vitro. This stimulation was mediated through the dEC antigen receptor and did not appear to be restricted by the major histocompatibility complex. Thus, dECs can recognize self antigens and may participate in immune surveillance for cellular damage rather than for foreign antigens."

https://openalex.org/W1566331874,"The interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) inhibits the binding of interleukin-1 (IL-1) to T-cell lines possessing the type I IL-1 receptor; evidence has been published (Carter, D.

(1990) Nature 343, 336-340) that IL-Ira does not bind to the type II IL-1 receptor (IL-1RtII). In this study we examined the ability of human recombinant IL-1ra to block the binding of IL-1 to the IL-1RtII on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and Raji human B-lymphoma cells. The binding of 125I-IL-1 beta to PMN was competively inhibited by IL-1ra. IL-1 beta was more potent in inhibiting the binding of 125I-IL-1 beta than IL-1ra. Incubating PMN with 125I-IL-1ra in the presence of increasing concentrations of IL-1 beta or IL-1ra showed that IL-1 beta was an approximately 40-fold more potent inhibitor of binding of 125I-IL-1ra than unlabeled IL-1ra. The IL-1ra was approximately 500-fold less potent in inhibiting the binding of 125I-IL-1 alpha than IL-1 alpha. IL-1ra was also able to competitively inhibit binding of 125I-IL-1 beta to Raji cells. PMN or Raji cells were also incubated with 125I-IL-1 in the absence or presence of IL-1 or IL-1ra. After cross-linking of IL-1 to cells followed by specific immunoprecipitation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a band at 85 kDa corresponding to the 68-kDa IL-1RtII. However, in the presence of an excess of either unlabeled IL-1 or IL-1ra, the 85-kDa IL-1.IL-1RtII complex was not present. These findings demonstrate that the IL-1ra recognizes and blocks IL-1 binding to the IL-1RtII."

https://openalex.org/W1976062079,"As well as being activated or rendered unresponsive, mature T lymphocytes can be deleted, depending on the signals received by the cell. Deletion by programmed cell death (apoptosis) is triggered if a T cell that has received a signal through its T cell receptor complex also receives a signal through the alpha 3 domain of its class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. Such a signal can be delivered by a CD8 molecule, which recognizes the alpha 3 domain, or by an antibody to this domain. Precursors of both cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL's) and T helper cells are sensitive to this signal but become resistant at some point before completing differentiation into functioning CTL's or T helper cells. Because CTL's carry CD8, they can induce cell death in T cells that recognize them. This pathway may be important in both removal of autoreactive T cells and immunoregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2127199932,"Oct-4 is a transcription factor expressed in the pluripotent progenitor cells of the early mouse embryo. Additional factors are required for the distal activation of genes in differentiated cells containing ectopically expressed Oct-4. Here we show that Oct-4 and E1A are sufficient for distance-independent activation of the basal transcription machinery. The ratio of Oct-4 to E1A is critical for transcriptional activation, because higher levels of either factor are less efficient. Activation depends on a transactivation domain linked to the POU domain of Oct-4 and also on the conserved domain 3 of the 289RE1A protein. This domain is required for binding to the C-terminal part of Oct-4 including the POU domain. Our results indicate that E1A can serve as a bridging factor between Oct-4 and the basal initiation complex, and we postulate that an E1A-like factor acts as a cellular bridging factor of Oct-4 in pluripotent cells."
https://openalex.org/W1505425247,"The conversion of thyroxine to 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) is the first step in thyroid hormone action, and the Type I iodothyronine deiodinase supplies most of this extrathyroidal T3 in the rat. We found that the cDNA coding for this enzyme contains an in-frame UGA encoding the rare amino acid selenocysteine. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have converted selenocysteine to cysteine and expressed the wild-type and cysteine mutant enzymes in JEG-3 cells by transient transfection. The kinetic properties of the transiently expressed wild-type enzyme are nearly identical to those reported for rat liver Type I deiodinase. Substitution of sulfur for selenium causes a 10-fold increase in the Km of the enzyme for the favored substrate 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (rT3), a 100-fold decrease in the sensitivity of rT3 deiodination to competitive inhibition by gold and a 300-fold increase in the apparent Ki for uncompetitive inhibition by 6-n-propylthiouracil. These results demonstrate that selenium is responsible for the biochemical properties which characterize Type I iodothyronine monodeiodination."
https://openalex.org/W1535401962,"Ca(2+)-sensitive mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae showing a Pet- phenotype (cls7-cls11) have lesions in a system for maintaining intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (Ohya, Y., Ohsumi, Y., and Anraku, Y. (1986) J. Gen. Microbiol. 132, 979-988). Genetic and biochemical studies have demonstrated that these Pet- cls mutants are related to defects in vacuolar membrane H(+)-ATPase. CLS7 and CLS8 were found to be identical with the structural genes encoding subunit c (VMA3) and subunit a (VMA1), respectively, of the enzyme. In addition, these five mutants all had vma defects; no vacuolar membrane ATPase activity was detected in the cls cells, and the cls mutants showed a loss of ability to acidify the vacuole in vivo. Measurements of the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) in individual cells showed that the average [Ca2+]i in wild-type cells was 150 +/- 80 nM, whereas that in five Pet- cls cells was 900 +/- 100 nM. These data are consistent with the observation that vacuolar membrane vesicles prepared from the Pet- cls cells have lost ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake activities. The cls defects of vacuolar membrane H(+)-ATPase resulted in pleiotropic effects on several cellular activities, including Ca2+ homeostasis, glycerol metabolism, and phospholipid metabolism. The mutants showed an inositol-dependent phenotype, possibly due to alteration in regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis; the phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activities of the mutants were 15-50% of that of the wild-type cells and were not repressed by the addition of inositol. In contrast to the majority of previously isolated pet mutants (Tzagoloff, A., and Dieckmann, C. L. (1990) Microbiol. Rev. 54, 211-225), the Pet- cls mutants showed no detectable mitochondrial defects. Taking all these findings into account, we suggest that at least six genes, VMA1 (CLS8, subunit a), VMA2 (subunit b), VMA3 (CLS7, subunit c), VMA11 (CLS9), VMA12 (CLS10), and VMA13 (CLS11), are required for expression of the vacuolar membrane H(+)-ATPase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1583769399,"A number of eukaryotic proteins are anchored to the membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), of which the core structure is conserved from protozoan to mammalian cells. Here, we used a panel of thymoma mutants, which synthesize Thy-1 but cannot express it on the cell surface, to study the GPI biosynthetic pathway in mammalian cells. These mutants have been assigned into six complementation classes (A, B, C, E, F, H) by the technique of somatic cell hybridization. Using a combination of metabolic labeling and chemical/enzymatic tests, the biosynthetic defects were mapped to four different steps. Class A, C, and H mutants cannot transfer N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to a phosphatidylinositol acceptor, suggesting that the first step of GPI synthesis is regulated by at least three genes. The Class E mutant does not synthesize dolichol-phosphate-mannose, the donor for the first mannose residue transferred to the GPI core, and thus cannot form any mannose-containing GPI precursors. Class B and F mutants are defective in the addition of the third mannose residue or ethanolamine phosphate, respectively, to the elongating GPI core. Our findings have implications for the biosynthesis and attachment of the mammalian GPI anchor."
https://openalex.org/W1513007135,"The oncogenic transformation of a normal fibroblast by mutated Ras genes can be reversed by overexpression of a Ras-related gene called Rap1A (or Krev1). Both Ras and Rap1A proteins are G proteins and appear to serve as signal transducers only in the GTP-bound form. Therefore, GAP1 and GAP3, which stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activities of normal Ras and Rap1A proteins, respectively, serve as attenuators of their signal transducing activities. In this paper, we describe the enzymatic properties of several mutated Rap1A and chimeric Ras/Rap1A (or -1B) proteins which lead to the following conclusions: (i) the GAP3-dependent activation of both Rap1A and -1B GTPases requires Gly12, but neither Thr61 nor Gln63; (ii) residues 64 to 70 of the Rap1 GTPases are sufficient to determine their specificities for GAP3; and (iii) residues 61 to 65 of the Ras GTPases are sufficient for determining their specificities for GAP1. Thus, the domains of the Ras or Rap1 proteins that determine whether their signals are attenuated by GAP1 or GAP3 are distinct from the N-terminal domain (residues 21 to 54) that determines whether their signals are oncogenic or antioncogenic. The Arg12 mutant of chimeric HaRas(1-54)/Rap1A(55-184) protein has been previously reported to be oncogenic (Zhang, K., Noda, M., Vass, W. C., Papageorge, A.G., and Lowy, D.R. (1990) Science 249, 162-165). In this paper, we show that the Val12 mutant of chimeric HaRas(1-54)/Rap1B(55-184) protein is also oncogenic, suggesting that the C-terminal geranylgeranylation of the Rap 1B protein can replace functionally the C-terminal farnesylation of the Ras protein to allow the G protein to be oncogenic."

https://openalex.org/W1599429565,"The lymphoma plasma membrane glycoprotein, GP85, is a transmembrane glycoprotein that binds directly to ankyrin, a molecule known to link the plasma membrane with the underlying cytoskeleton. In this study, we have demonstrated that palmitic acid is incorporated into GP85 in vivo and that the amount of palmitic acid incorporated is greatly stimulated during lymphoma cap formation. The majority of the incorporated palmitic acid appears to be strongly linked to GP85 since it is not dissociated by strong detergents (e.g. sodium dodecyl sulfate) or by chloroform/methanol extraction, but is labile to alkaline or acid hydrolysis. Furthermore, we have established that deacylation of GP85 (i.e. removal of the palmitic acid moiety from GP85 by 1 M hydroxylamine treatment) significantly reduces the binding affinity between GP85 and ankyrin, and reacylation of GP85 restores the binding affinity. These findings suggest that fatty acid acylation of GP85 by palmitic acid may be required for the stable attachment of the cytoskeleton to the lymphoma plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1509104855,"Insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity and GLUT4 glucose transporter protein expression in rat soleus, red-enriched, and white-enriched skeletal muscle were examined in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced insulin-deficient diabetes. Six days of STZ-diabetes resulted in a nearly complete inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in perfused soleus, red, and white muscle which recovered following insulin therapy. A specific decrease in the GLUT4 glucose transporter protein was observed in soleus (3-fold) and red (2-fold) muscle which also recovered to control values with insulin therapy. Similarly, cardiac muscle displayed a marked STZ-induced decrease in GLUT4 protein that was normalized by insulin therapy. White muscle displayed a small but statistically significant decrease in GLUT4 protein (23%), but this could not account for the marked inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity observed in this tissue. In addition, GLUT4 mRNA was found to decrease in red muscle (2-fold) with no significant alteration in white muscle. The effect of STZ-induced diabetes was time-dependent with maximal inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity at 24 h in both red and white skeletal muscle and half-maximal inhibition at approximately 8 h. In contrast, GLUT4 protein in red and white muscle remained unchanged until 4 and 7 days following STZ treatment, respectively. These data demonstrate that red skeletal muscle displays a more rapid hormonal/metabolic-dependent regulation of GLUT4 glucose transporter protein and mRNA expression than white skeletal muscle. In addition, the inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in both red and white muscle precedes the decrease in GLUT4 protein and mRNA levels. Thus, STZ treatment initially results in a rapid uncoupling of the insulin-mediated signaling of glucose transport activity which is independent of GLUT4 protein and mRNA levels."

The variant antigen, known as the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), is anchored to the cell surface by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) structure that contains myristate (n-tetradecanoate) as its only fatty acid component. The utilization of heteroatom-containing analogs of myristate was studied both in a cell-free system and in vivo. Results indicated that the specificity of fatty acid incorporation depends on chain length rather than on hydrophobicity. One analog, 10-(propoxy)decanoic acid, was highly toxic to trypanosomes in culture although it is nontoxic to mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1657073639,"The roles of the two tandemly arranged putative ATP binding sites of Escherichia coli UvrA in UvrABC endonuclease-mediated excision repair were analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical characterization of the representative mutant proteins. Evidence is presented that UvrA has two functional ATPase sites which coincide with the putative ATP binding motifs predicted from its amino acid sequence. The individual ATPase sites can independently hydrolyze ATP. The C-terminal ATPase site has a higher affinity for ATP than the N-terminal site. The invariable lysine residues at the ends of the glycine-rich loops of the consensus Walker type A motifs are indispensable for ATP hydrolysis. However, the mutations at these lysine residues do not significantly affect ATP binding. UvrA, with bound ATP, forms the most favored conformation for DNA binding. The initial binding of UvrA to DNA is chiefly at the undamaged sites. In contrast to the wild type UvrA, the ATPase site mutants bind equally to damaged and undamaged sites. Dissociation of tightly bound nucleoprotein complexes from the undamaged sites requires hydrolysis of ATP by the C-terminal ATPase site of UvrA. Thus, both ATP binding and hydrolysis are required for the damage recognition step enabling UvrA to discriminate between damaged and undamagedmore » sites on DNA.« less"

Clustered forks are visualized by incorporation of biotin-19-dUTP into nascent DNA. Pulse-label experiments show that discrete replication foci persist throughout S phase.

https://openalex.org/W1499724628,"The cynomolgus macaque was used as a model to study lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)). Antibodies to Lp(a) were used in Ouchterlony and Western blot analysis to show that cynomolgus monkey and human Lp(a) were similar immunochemically. Monkey Lp(a) levels were measured by a quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 117 animals, and Lp(a) varied in concentration from 1 to 64 mg/dl. Individual monkeys had apo(a) glycoprotein sizes as either single- or double-band phenotypes that ranged from 400 to 750 kDa. Monkey apo(a) transcript lengths varied from 8.5 to 13.6 kilobases. The Lp(a) concentration, apo(a) glycoprotein size, and apo(a) transcript length distributions were similar to those in humans. In the monkeys, there was a very high correlation between apo(a) transcript size and apo(a) protein size (R = 0.93, p = 0.0001). This variation in apo(a) transcript and protein size was shown to be due to the number of kringle IV repeats in apo(a) mRNA and DNA. Monkey plasma Lp(a) concentrations correlated inversely with apo(a) glycoprotein size (R = 0.43, p = 0.0016) and directly with hepatic apo(a) mRNA abundance (R = 0.54, p = 0.004). Apo(a) transcript lengths did not correlate with hepatic apo(a) mRNA levels. This suggests that apo(a) size and mRNA levels have major independent effects on plasma Lp(a) concentration. In multivariate analysis, they account for up to 58% of the variability in Lp(a) concentration. In summary, these data provide insight into the regulation of Lp(a) levels and suggest that the cynomolgus monkey is a suitable model in which to study the role of Lp(a) in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis."

https://openalex.org/W1502090830,"The immunoglobulin kappa light chain enhancer, kappa B, is an important cis-acting transcriptional element. kappa B binds a number of proteins including the members of the ubiquitous NF-kappa B family of transcription factors. Agarose beads coupled to a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the kappa B motif were used to isolate a 65-kDa predominantly nuclear phosphoprotein. Southwestern blot analysis demonstrated that this phosphoprotein can bind the kappa B element directly and specifically. This kappa B-associated protein was phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro by a nuclear serine/threonine kinase(s) which, in a number of different cell lines, appeared to be stimulated in response to interleukin-1 alpha and lipopolysaccharide treatment. In the B cell lines 70Z/3 and CH12 LX2B, and the T cell line EL-4 6.1 C10 the activity of the kappa B-associated kinase(s) correlated with the binding activity of nuclear NF-kappa B displayed in a gel shift assay. In vitro, the 65-kDa protein was phosphorylated in the absence of exogenously added kinase. The 65-kDa phosphoprotein and the kinase activity remained associated following sequential anion-exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. These results suggest that the kappa B-associated phosphoprotein is either autophosphorylated or is phosphorylated by a closely associated kinase(s). Stimulation of a nuclear protein kinase which is closely associated with a sequence-specific DNA may reflect a novel mechanism by which growth factors regulate gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1519883796,"The topography of the subunits of the membrane sector F0 of the ATP synthase complex in the bovine mitochondrial inner membrane was studied with the help of subunit-specific antibodies raised to the F0 subunits b, d, 6, F6, A6L, OSCP (oligomycin-sensitivity-conferring protein), and N,N' -dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD)-binding proteolipid and to the ATPase inhibitor protein (IF1) as an internal control. Exposure of F0 subunits in inverted and right-side-out inner membranes was investigated by direct antibody binding as well as by susceptibility of these subunits to degradation by various proteases as monitored by gel electrophoresis of the membrane digests and immunoblotting with the subunit-specific antibodies. Results show that subunits b, d, F6, A6L (including its C-terminal end) and OSCP were exposed on the matrix side. Sufficient masses of these subunits to recognize antibodies or undergo proteolysis were not exposed on the cytosolic side. This was also the case for subunit 6 and the DCCD-binding proteolipid on either side of the inner membrane. Quantitative immunoblotting in which bound radio-activity from [125I]protein A was employed to estimate the concentration of an antigen in a sample allowed the determination of the stoichiometry of several F0 subunits and IF1 relative to F1-ATPase. Results showed that per mol of F1 there are in bovine heart mitochondria 1 mol each of d, OSCP, and IF1, and 2 mol each of b and F6. Subunit 6 and the DCCD-binding proteolipid could not be quantitated, because the former transferred poorly to nitrocellulose and the latter's antibody did not bind [125I]protein A."
https://openalex.org/W1545193508,"We have isolated, characterized, and sequenced the gene coding for the 72-kDa human high affinity IgG FcR, hFc gamma RI. It consists of six exons and spans 9.4 kilobase pairs. The leader sequence is encoded by two exons, the second of which is 21 base pairs long and contains the predicted site of peptidase cleavage. The third, fourth, and fifth exons each encode homologous Ig-like extracellular domains. The hydrophobic transmembrane region and a highly charged cytoplasmic tail are encoded by a single final exon. The sequence of the 5'-flanking region was determined. Two major transcription initiation sites were identified by RNase protection. The first, more downstream site was confirmed by primer extension studies; canonical CAAT and TATA boxes are located in appropriate positions upstream from this site. The second transcription initiation site was utilized only in RNA from cells incubated with gamma-interferon. This site initiates transcription upstream from the first major site. These data are consistent with the finding of two species of mRNA for hFc gamma RI in myeloid cells that are upregulated when cultured with gamma-interferon. Southern analysis of genomic DNA confirms the restriction map generated from the cloned DNA. One additional HindIII fragment was observed in genomic DNA from 13 randomly selected individuals that was not present in the phage clone used to characterize the gene. This observation suggests the existence of a second hFc gamma RI gene which lacks one of the two internal HindIII sites rather than a restriction fragment length polymorphism."
https://openalex.org/W2142232452,"The binding of the NH2-terminal region of troponin T (TnT) to the COOH-terminal region of tropomyosin (Tm) and the head-to-tail overlap between Tm molecules is thought to provide a pivotal link between troponin (Tn) and Tm (White, S.P., Cohen, C., and Phillips, G.N., Jr. (1987) Nature 325, 826-828). To further explore the structure-function relationship of the NH2-terminal region of TnT, we studied the binding of a 26,000-dalton TnT fragment (26K-TnT, Ohtsuki, I., Shiraishi, F., Suenaga, N., Miyata, T., and Tanokura, M.J. (1984) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 95, 1337-1342) which corresponds to residues 46-259 of TnT2f, the major isoform of TnT in rabbit fast twitch muscle, to immobilized alpha-Tm. Both 26K-TnT and TnT2f were retained by the alpha-Tm affinity column in the presence of 150 mM NaCl. However, upon increasing the NaCl concentration 26K-TnT was eluted from the column at a higher ionic strength than was TnT. When applied alone, the binary complex of TnI and TnC (TnC.TnI) was not retained by the alpha-Tm affinity column. When applied subsequently to prebound TnT2f or 26K-TnT, TnI.TnC was retained by the alpha-Tm affinity column and eluted together with TnT2f or 26K-TnT as ternary troponin complexes. Whether Ca2+ was present or not, Tn containing 26K-TnT was eluted at a higher ionic strength than was Tn containing TnT2f, indicating that removal of the first 45 residues of TnT2f strengthens the binding of Tn to Tm. In the presence of Tm, reconstituted Tn containing 26K-TnT conferred Ca2+ sensitivity on actomyosin-S1 MgATPase, and the steepness of the pCa-ATPase relation was unchanged with respect to the actoS1 ATPase regulated by TnT2f. It is concluded that the first 45 residues of TnT2f are not essential for anchoring the troponin complex to the thin filament and do not play a crucial role in the cooperative response of regulated actoS1 ATPase to Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1483228825,"The recent finding that the presence of ATP at non-catalytic sites of chloroplast F1-ATPase (CF1) is necessary for ATPase activity (Milgrom, Y. M., Ehler, L. L., and Boyer, P. D. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265,18725-18728) prompted more detailed studies of the effect of noncatalytic site nucleotides on catalysis. CF1 containing at noncatalytic sites less than one ADP or about two ATP was prepared by heat activation in the absence of Mg2+ and in the presence of ADP or ATP, respectively. After removal of medium nucleotides, the CF1 preparations were used for measurement of the time course of nucleotide binding from 10 to 100 microM concentrations of 3H-labeled ADP, ATP, or GTP. The presence of Mg2+ strongly promotes the tight binding of ADP and ATP at noncatalytic sites. For example, the ADP-heat-activated enzyme in presence of 1 mM Mg2+ binds ADP with a rate constant of 0.5 x 10(6) M-1 min-1 to give an enzyme with two ADP at noncatalytic sites with a Kd of about 0.1 microM. Upon exposure to Mg2+ and ATP the vacant noncatalytic site binds an ATP rapidly and, as an ADP slowly dissociates, a second ATP binds. The binding correlates with an increase in the ATPase activity. In contrast the tight binding of [3H]GTP to noncatalytic sites gives an enzyme with no ATPase activity. The three noncatalytic sites differ in their binding properties. The noncatalytic site that remains vacant after the ADP-heat-activated CF1 is exposed to Mg2+ and ADP and that can bind ATP rapidly is designated as site A; the site that fills with ATP as ADP dissociates when this enzyme is exposed to Mg2+ and ATP is called site B, and the site to which ADP remains bound is called site C. Procedures are given for attaining CF1 with ADP at sites B and C, with GTP at sites A and/or B, and with ATP at sites A, B, and/or C, and catalytic activities of such preparations are measured. For example, little or no ATPase activity is found unless ATP is at site A, but ADP can remain at site C with no effect on ATPase. Maximal GTPase activity requires ATP at site A but about one-fifth of maximal GTPase is attained when GTP is at sites A and B and ATP at site C. Noncatalytic site occupancy can thus have profound effects on the ATPase and GTPase activities of CF1."

https://openalex.org/W2171343897,"Suppressor mutations which alleviate the defects in folding mutants of the P22 gene 9 tailspike protein have recently been isolated (Fane, B. and King, J. (1991) Genetics 127, 263-277). The starting folding defects were in missense polypeptide chains generated by host amino acid insertions at different amber mutant sites. Fragments of genes carrying the amber mutations with and without their independently isolated suppressor mutations were cloned and sequenced. The parental nonsense mutations were located at Q45, K122, E156, W202, W207, Y232, and W365. Their conformational suppressors were single amino acid substitutions at a limited set of sites, V84 greater than A, V331 greater than A, and A334 greater than V. The V331 greater than A or A334 greater than V suppressors were independently recovered starting with different mutant sites suggesting that they acted by some global or general mechanism. When the V331 greater than A and A334 greater than V mutations were crossed into well-characterized temperature-sensitive folding (tsf) mutants at various sites in the tailspike protein, they suppressed all of the eight tsf mutants tested. Since the tsf defects destabilize folding intermediates rather than the native conformation, this result implies that the suppressors act in the folding pathway. Strains carrying the isolated suppressor mutations displayed no obvious phenotypic defect and formed native biologically active tailspikes. Thus, these single amino acid substitutions have striking influences on the efficiency of intracellular chain folding, without causing functional defects in the native protein."
https://openalex.org/W1974701901,"The benefits and costs of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing in employment settings are examined from two points of view: that of private employers whose profitability may be affected by their testing policies and that of public policy-makers who may affect social welfare through their design of regulations related to HIV testing. The results reveal that HIV testing is clearly not cost-beneficial for most firms, although the benefits of HIV testing may outweigh the costs for some large firms that offer generous fringe-benefit packages and that recruit workers from populations in which the prevalence of HIV infection is high. The analysis also indicates that the testing decisions of unregulated employers are not likely to yield socially optimal economic outcomes and that existing state and federal legislation related to HIV testing in employment settings has been motivated primarily by concerns over social equity."
https://openalex.org/W1652932074,"The UvrA protein is the DNA binding and damage recognition subunit of the damage-specific UvrABC endonuclease. In addition, it is an ATPase/GTPase, and the binding energy of ATP is linked to dimerization of the UvrA protein. Furthermore, the UvrA protein interacts with the UvrB protein to modulate its activities, both in solution and in association with DNA, where the UvrAB complex possesses a helicase activity. The domains of the UvrA protein that sponsor each of these activities were localized within the protein by studying the in vitro properties of a set of purified deletion mutants of the UvrA protein. A region located within the first 230 amino acids was found to contain the minimal region necessary for interactions with UvrB, the UvrA dimerization interface was localized to within the first 680 amino acids, and the DNA binding domain lies within the first 900 amino acids of the 940-amino acid UvrA protein. Two damage recognition domains were detected. The first domain, which coincides with the DNA binding region, is required to detect the damage. The second domain, located on or near the C-terminal 40 amino acids, stabilizes the protein-DNA complex when damage is encountered."
https://openalex.org/W1591004424,"The effects of changes in pH on the binding of agonists and antagonists to the human platelet thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 (TXA2/PGH2) receptor were determined. Competition binding studies were performed with the TXA2/PGH2 mimetic [1S-1 alpha,2 beta (5Z), 3 alpha(1E,3R*),4 alpha)]-7-[3-(3-hydroxy-4'-iodophenoxy)-1-buteny) 7-oxabicyclo-[2.2.1]-heptan-2-yl]-5-heptenoic acid ([125I]BOP). The pH optimum for binding of [125I] BOP to washed human platelets was broad with a range of pH 4-6 in contrast to that of the TXA2/PGH2 receptor antagonist 9,11-dimethyl-methano-11,12-methano-16-(3-iodo-4-hydroxyl)-13-aza-15 alpha,beta-omega-tetranorthromboxane A2 ([125I]PTA-OH) which was 7.4. Scatchard analysis of [125I]BOP binding in washed platelets at pH 7.4, 6.0, and 5.0 revealed an increase in affinity (Kd = 1.16 +/- 0.06, 0.64 +/- 0.09, and 0.48 +/- 0.05 nM, respectively) and an increase in the number of receptors (Bmax = 2807 +/- 415, 5397 +/- 636, and 7265 +/- 753 sites/platelet, respectively). The potency of I-BOP to induce shape change in washed platelets at pH 6.0 was also significantly increased from an EC50 value of 0.34 +/- 0.016 nM at pH 7.4 to 0.174 +/- 0.014 nM at pH 6.0 (n = 6, p less than 0.05). In contrast, the EC50 value for thrombin was unaffected by the change in pH. In competition binding studies with [125I]BOP, the affinity of the agonists U46619 and ONO11113 were increased at pH 6.0 compared to 7.4. In contrast, the affinity of the TXA2/PGH2 receptor antagonists I-PTA-OH, SQ29548, and L657925 were either decreased or unchanged at pH 6.0 compared to 7.4. Diethyl pyrocarbonate and N-bromosuccinimide, reagents used to modify histidine residues, reversed the increase in affinity of [125I]BOP at pH 6.0 to values equivalent to those at pH 7.4. In solubilized platelet membranes, the effects of NBS were blocked by coincubation with the TXA2/PGH2 mimetic U46619. The results suggest that agonist and antagonist binding characteristics are different for the TXA2/PGH2 receptor and that histidine residue(s) may play an important role in the binding of TXA2/PGH2 ligands to the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2170883466,"The Ca(2+)-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum reacts with N-cyclohexyl-N'-(4-dimethylamino-1-naphthyl) carbodiimide (NCD4) yielding a fluorescence labeling that interferes with calcium binding to activating and transport sites of the enzyme and, thereby, with Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase activity. On the other hand, the catalytic site does not appear altered, as revealed by the normal occurrence of Ca(2+)-independent reactions, such as enzyme phosphorylation with Pi in the reverse direction of the catalytic cycle. This reaction is not inhibited by Ca2+ in the labeled enzyme, while it is inhibited in the native enzyme. The NCD4 reaction which is involved in functional inactivation occurs in the membrane-bound portion of the ATPase. Sodium dodecyl sulfate solubilization of hydrophobic peptides, electrophoresis, and microsequencing of transblotted electrophoretic bands revealed that the fluorescent NCD4 label resides in a segment of tryptic fragment A1, intervening between Glu231 and Glu309. This segment includes two transmembrane helices, and does not include the domain involved in the phosphoryl transfer reaction during catalytic activity. This specific labeling does not occur when the NCD4 derivatization procedure is carried out in the presence of Ca2+ concentrations that also prevent functional inactivation. Fluorescence characterization by steady state and intensity decay measurements shows only negligible energy transfer between the NCD4 label and fluorescein isothiocyanate label of Lys515, indicating that the NCD4 label is unlikely to reside within the extramembranous region of the ATPase. On the other hand, the fluorescence emission of intrinsic tryptophan residues clustered within or near the transmembrane region of the ATPase, is distinctly affected by NCD4 label specifically bound to the ATPase, and NCD4 label nonspecifically bound to the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. The combined sequencing and spectroscopic observations indicate that derivatization with NCD4 induces a perturbation within or near the transmembrane region of the ATPase (at a relatively large distance from the catalytic site) that interferes with specific calcium binding. This is in agreement with experiments (Clarke et al., 1989) demonstrating that mutations of any of six amino acids within the transmembrane region of the ATPase interfere with enzyme activation by Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1548528179,"To determine the density of Na(+)-Pi symporters in brush border membranes (BBM) from rat renal cortex, [14C] phosphonoformic acid [( 14C] PFA), a competitive inhibitor of Na(+)-Pi cotransport, was employed as a probe. The [14C]PFA binding was measured in BBM vesicles (BBMV) under equilibrated conditions (extra-vesicular Na+, K+, and H+ = intravesicular Na+, K+, and H+) to avoid modulatory effects of these solutes. BBMV were preincubated in media without or with addition of molar excess of Pi (greater than 20 times) to determine the PFA-binding sites, and then [14C] PFA binding was determined. Only the [14C]PFA binding in the presence of Na+ displaceable by an excess of Pi was saturated and was independent of intravesicular volume of BBMV. This value denoted as Pi-protectable Na(+)-[14C]PFA was analyzed by Scatchard plot showing BmaxPFA = 375 +/- 129 pmol of PFA/mg protein, KDPFA = 158 +/- 18 microM; the Hill coefficient was congruent to 1. For Na(+)-dependent binding of [3H]phlorizin, in the same BBMV, Bmax = 310 +/- 37 pmol/mg protein and KD V 2.2 +/- 0.5 microM. BBMV prepared from cortex of thyroparathyroidectomized rats infused with phosphaturic doses of parathyroid hormone (PTH) were compared with vehicle-infused controls. Administration of PTH resulted in decrease of BmaxPFA (-38%) and of Na(+)-gradient-dependent uptake of 32Pi (-35%), but KDPFA was not changed. Neither BmaxPhl and KDPhl for Na(+)-phlorizin binding, nor the Na(+)-gradient-dependent uptake of [3H]D-glucose differed between PTH-treated and control rats. We conclude: (a) measurement of Na(+)-[14C]PFA binding determines numbers and affinity of Na(+)-Pi symporters in renal BBMV; (b) the affinity of PFA for Na(+)-Pi symporter is similar to apparent affinity for Pi (KmPi), as determined from measurements of Na(+)-gradient-dependent 32Pi uptake by BBMV; (c) both Na(+)-Pi symporter and [Na+]D-glucose symporters are present within renal BBM in a similar range of density; (d) PTH decreases the number of Na(+)-Pi cotransporters in BBMV commensurate with the parallel decrease of Na(+)-gradient-dependent Pi transport, whereas the affinity of Na(+)-Pi symporters for Pi is not changed. These observations support the hypothesis that PTH decreases capacity for Na(+)-dependent Pi reabsorption by internalization of Na(+)-Pi symporters in BBM of renal proximal tubules."

https://openalex.org/W1568671953,"The alpha 3 beta 3 complex of ATP synthase obtained from a thermophilic bacterium PS3 was isolated and found to show the ATPase activity (Kagawa, Y., Ohta, S., and Otawara-Hamamoto, Y. (1989) FEBS Lett. 249, 67-69). The structure and the nucleotide binding effects of the alpha 3 beta 3 complex were investigated by means of small-angle x-ray scattering and high performance liquid chromatography. The scattering profile from the alpha 3 beta 3 complex was explained with a model in which the complex is made of an ellipsoid of revolution with the axes of 121.8, 121.8, and 72.0 A having an elliptical hollow cavity with the axes of 35.4, 35.4, and 72.0 A. By the addition of Mg.AT(D)P, significant changes in the scattering profile were observed, in which the radius of gyration decreased from 44 to 35 A. This change was found by gel filtration to be caused by the dissociation reaction from the alpha 3 beta 3 hexamer to the alpha beta dimer. The dissociation of the alpha 3 beta 3 complex was not induced by unhydrolyzable ATP analogue, nor by Pi, Mg2+, and Pi + Mg2+. The structure of the dimer was well explained by the triaxial ellipsoidal model with the axes of 105.2, 39.4, and 108.2 A. The dissociation into the dimer is considered to be related to the ATPase activity because the AT(D)P-induced dissociation is observed only in the presence of Mg2+ ions."
https://openalex.org/W1574080724,"Abstract We have recently established the existence of endogenous activators of higher plant UDP-glucose: (1----3)-beta-glucan synthase (Callaghan, T., Ross, P., Weinberger-Ohana, P., and Benziman, M. (1988) Plant Physiol. 86, 1099-1103). Here we report the purification and chemical analysis of the most abundant and specific compound, termed Activator I, isolated from Vigna radiata. This compound was extensively purified by a multistep procedure which yielded 0.1 mg of purified activator/g of fresh tissue. Enzyme digestion, neutral sugar analysis, GC/MS of permethylated derivatives, and NMR analysis of native Activator I indicated that the compound contains a single beta-linked glucosyl residue. High resolution FAB-MS indicated an elemental composition of C11H16O7 (Mr = 260), with a calculated Mr of 98 for the aglycone. 13C, DEPT, and COSY NMR spectra showed that the aglycone molecule is an oxygen heterocycle of 5 carbons, consistent with a structure of beta-furfuryl alcohol. Comparison of IR and GC/EI-MS spectra of authentic beta-furfuryl alcohol with native aglycone confirmed the conclusion that Activator I is beta-furfuryl-beta-glucoside. Chemically synthesized beta-furfuryl-beta-glucoside has identical chemical properties and biological activity when compared with the purified endogenous activator (Ka = 50 microM)."
https://openalex.org/W1521845400,"Treatment of the trifunctional protein from Neurospora crassa with various proteases produced almost identical patterns of proteolytic fragments. To study the structural features of the protein in more detail limited proteolysis with trypsin was carried out. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against three different tryptic fragments. With the help of immunological methods and amino-terminal sequence analysis we were able to monitor the sequential cleavage steps during proteolysis. Two major fragments (an amino-terminal one of 51 kDa and a carboxyl-terminal one of 46 kDa) were identified at the first cleavage step, dividing the 93-kDa subunit of the trifunctional protein almost in half. Additional proteolysis products, deriving from either half, were formed in subsequent proteolytic steps. Combining these results with those obtained from enzyme analysis of the proteolyzed protein, a domain structure of the trifunctional protein is proposed. According to our model each subunit of the tetrameric protein consists of at least two large domains, the amino-terminal one possessing 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase and L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity and the carboxyl-terminal one bearing 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1484866174,"We have examined the mechanism for the host cell-dependent repression of enhancer activity by the adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) proteins. The enhancer used in this study, from the human BK virus P2, functions efficiently in cis to activate expression from the adenovirus major late promoter in the human kidney cell line, 293, and in a monkey kidney cell line, MK2. In addition, enhancer activity can be stimulated by the E1A gene products in these cells. However, cis-enhancer activity is repressed in the HeLa cell line, and we demonstrate here that further repression can be induced by the E1A proteins. We show that the binding site for the negative regulatory factor involved in cis-repression, designated BK virus enhancer factor 1 (BEF-1), is also required for E1A-induced repression. Using gel mobility retardation assays, we demonstrated a 4-fold increase in active BEF-1 in nuclear extracts containing the E1A proteins. However, the E1A proteins did not change the binding pattern or the strength of binding of BEF-1 to its target sequence. BEF-1 was identified as a 98-kDa nuclear factor, and phosphorylation was shown to be important for DNA binding. Three potential nuclear factor 1 (NF-1) sites are present in the BEF-1-binding site. Using a known NF-1 site as competitor DNA in a gel mobility retardation assay, we provide evidence that BEF-1 may be a newly identified NF-1 family member. In addition, the sequence TGA present in the repressor-binding site was shown to be essential for high affinity binding of BEF-1. Overall, our data demonstrate that an enhancer can be repressed by the trans-activation of a negative regulatory factor."
