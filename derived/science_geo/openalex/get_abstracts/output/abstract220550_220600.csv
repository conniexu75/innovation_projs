https://openalex.org/W2029293367,"There is now a choice of animal models for testing therapies against the human virus. The reservoir of the coronavirus isolated from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)1,2 is still unknown, but is suspected to have been a wild animal species. Here we show that ferrets (Mustela furo) and domestic cats (Felis domesticus) are susceptible to infection by SARS coronavirus (SCV) and that they can efficiently transmit the virus to previously uninfected animals that are housed with them. The observation that these two distantly related carnivores can so easily be infected with the virus indicates that the reservoir for this pathogen may involve a range of animal species."

https://openalex.org/W1996196555,"AMD3100 is a symmetric bicyclam, prototype non-peptide antagonist of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor. Mutational substitutions at 16 positions located in TM-III, -IV, -V, -VI, and -VII lining the main ligand-binding pocket of the CXCR4 receptor identified three acid residues: Asp171 (AspIV:20), Asp262 (AspVI:23), and Glu288 (GluVII:06) as the main interaction points for AMD3100. Molecular modeling suggests that one cyclam ring of AMD3100 interacts with Asp171 in TM-IV, whereas the other ring is sandwiched between the carboxylic acid groups of Asp262 and Glu288 from TM-VI and -VII, respectively. Metal ion binding in the cyclam rings of AMD3100 increased its dependence on Asp262 and provided a tighter molecular map of the binding site, where borderline mutational hits became clear hits for the Zn(II)-loaded analog. The proposed binding site for AMD3100 was confirmed by a gradual build-up in the rather distinct CXCR3 receptor, for which the compound normally had no effect. Introduction of only a Glu at position VII:06 and the removal of a neutralizing Lys residue at position VII:02 resulted in a 1000-fold increase in affinity of AMD3100 to within 10-fold of its affinity in CXCR4. We conclude that AMD3100 binds through interactions with essentially only three acidic anchor-point residues, two of which are located at one end and the third at the opposite end of the main ligand-binding pocket of the CXCR4 receptor. We suggest that non-peptide antagonists with, for example, improved oral bioavailability can be designed to mimic this interaction and thereby efficiently and selectively block the CXCR4 receptor.

The CXCR4 receptor is expressed much more broadly than chemokine receptors in general, i.e. not only on a wide variety of leukocytes but also on cells outside the immune system; for example, in the central nervous system (1.Unutmaz D. Littman D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1615-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 2.Cho C. Miller R.J. J. Neurovirol. 2002; 8: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast to many chemokine receptors, the CXCR4 receptor is only activated by a single chemokine ligand, stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1α, 1The abbreviations used are: SDF-1, stromal cell-derived factor; 7TM, seven transmembrane domain; cyclam, 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotet-radecane moiety; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; PI, phosphatidyl-inositol; IP10, inter-feron-γ-inducible protein; ITAC, interferon-inducible T cell α-chemoattractant.1The abbreviations used are: SDF-1, stromal cell-derived factor; 7TM, seven transmembrane domain; cyclam, 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotet-radecane moiety; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; PI, phosphatidyl-inositol; IP10, inter-feron-γ-inducible protein; ITAC, interferon-inducible T cell α-chemoattractant. also called CXCL12). Like many chemokine receptors, the CXCR4 receptor is involved in the control of migration and tissue targeting, i.e. homing of leukocytes. Importantly, SDF-1α and the CXCR4 receptor play a central role for the anchorage of CD34+ stem cells in the bone marrow. The importance of the receptor is emphasized by the fact that targeted deletion of either the gene for CXCR4 or for its ligand in both cases leads to embryologic lethality (3.Zou Y.-R. Kottmann A.H. Kuroda M. Taniuchi I. Littman D.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar, 4.Tachibana K. Hirota S. Iizasa H. Yoshida H. Kawabata K. Kataoka Y. Kitamura Y.

Kitamura Y. Yoshida N. Kikutani H. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1996; 382: 635-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). This is only rarely observed in knockouts of genes for chemokine receptors and, in fact, also rarely for 7TM G protein-coupled receptors in general. The CXCR4 receptor is also expressed on many different types of cancer cells, and it seems to function both as a survival factor and to be responsible for the “chemotactic” spread of cancer cells as metastasis, for example, to the bone marrow where the SDF-1α ligand for the receptor is produced in large quantities. AMD3100, which is composed of two 1,4,8,11-tetraazacy-clotetradecane (cyclam) moieties connected by a conformationally constraining linker, is a prototype non-peptide antagonist of the CXCR4 receptor. The compound was discovered as an anti-HIV agent long before it was realized that it functioned through specific blockade of the CXCR4 receptor, which is used as a co-receptor for cell entry by so-called X4 strains of the AIDS virus. AMD3100 is a specific CXCR4 antagonist that inhibits the binding and function of SDF-1α with high affinity and potency (6.Tasker P.A. Sklar L. J. Cryst. Mol. Struct. 1975; 5: 329-344Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 7.Choi H.J. Suh M.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10622-10628Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar). AMD3100 has been shown to block the outgrowth of all X4 as well as dual-tropic (T cell- and macrophage-tropic) HIV variants in vitro. During the development of AMD3100, it was discovered that the compound increases white blood cell counts in the blood and, importantly, that the compound is able to mobilize stem cells from the bone marrow. Thus, currently the compound, in combination with G-CSF, is in clinical trials for stem cell mobilization for auto-transplantations in, for example, multiple myeloma patients. In fact, strong evidence has been presented which indicates that many other stem cell mobilizing regimes, such as cyclophosphamide and G-CSF, act through disruption of the SDF-CXCR4 system, thus emphasizing the crucial role of this system in the control of stem cell homing and mobilization (8.Levesque J.P. Hendy J. Takamatsu Y. Simmons P.J. Bendall L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). In an initial study with just a few targeted mutations, we identified two acidic residues, Asp171 (AspIV:20) and Asp262 (AspVI:23), that are located in the main ligand-binding pocket of the CXCR4 receptor as being important for the binding of AMD3100 (9.Gerlach L.O. Skerlj R.T. Bridger G.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14153-14160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). That study was based on the knowledge of the strong preference of the cyclam moiety for interactions with carboxylic acid groups (21.Bridger G.J. Skerlj R.T. Adv. Antiviral Drug Des. 1999; 3: 161-229Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Asp171 and Asp262 were also found to be essential for the function of the CXCR4 receptor as a co-receptor for HIV (10.Donzella G.A. Schols D. Lin S.W. Este J.A. Nagashima K.A. Maddon P.J. Allaway G.P. Sakmar T.P. Henson G. De Clercq E. Moore J.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The present study was aimed at performing a rather exhaustive mutational analysis (Fig. 1) of the molecular mechanism of action of AMD3100 using the monoclonal antibody 12G5 and not SDF-1α as the radioligand. The reason for this is that the binding of the endogenous chemokine ligand was affected by certain mutations down in the main ligand-binding pocket, which limited the number of residues that could be addressed with that ligand as a probe. The 12G5 antibody is a relevant probe to use because the interactions of bicyclams with CXCR4 monitored by the inhibition of 12G5 binding follows a similar structure-activity relationship for the inhibition of HIV-replication (9.Gerlach L.O.

Importantly, the rather simple binding mode of the prototype CXCR4 non-peptide antagonist AMD3100, which was found through mutational disruption of the binding of the non-peptide compound in the CXCR4 receptor, was proven through the transfer of the essential components of this binding site to the binding pocket of the otherwise rather distinct CXCR3 receptor. Materials—The human chemokines CXCL12/SDF-1, CXCL10/IP10, and CXCL11/ITAC were purchased from Peprotech. The CXCR4-specific monoclonal antibody 12G5 was kindly provided by Jim Hoxie (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). Human CXCR4 was kindly provided by Timothy N. C. Wells (Serono Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Geneva, Switzerland), and human CXCR3 was kindly provided by Kuldeep Neote (Pfizer Inc., Groton, CT). The promiscuous chimeric G-protein GαΔ6qi4myr was kindly provided by Evi Kostenis (7TM-Pharma, Denmark). [3H]myo-inositol (PT6–271) and Bolton-Hunter reagent for iodination of 12G5 were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). AG 1-X8 anion-exchange resin was obtained from Bio-Rad. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Point mutations were introduced in the receptors by the polymerase chain reaction overlap extension technique (14.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6808) Google Scholar) using the wild-type CXCR4 or the wild-type CXCR3 receptor as template. All reactions were carried out using the Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The generated mutations were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3+. The mutations were verified by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequencing (ABI 310, PerkinElmer). Iodination of 12G5—The Bolton-Hunter reagent was dried by a gentle stream of nitrogen for 30–60 min. 250 pmol of 12G5 was incubated on ice with 1 mCi Bolton-Hunter reagent in a total volume of 50 μlof0.1 mm borate buffer, pH 8.5, for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.25 ml of the borate buffer supplemented with 0.2 m glycine and the Bolton-Hunter-labeled 12G5 separated from free Bolton-Hunter reagent by column chromatography (Econo-Pac DC10, Bio-Rad; Ref. 15.Signoret N. Rosenkilde M.M. Klasse P.J. Schwartz T.W. Malim M.H. Hoxie J.A. Marsh M. J. Cell. Science. 1998; 111: 2819-2830PubMed Google Scholar). Transfections and Tissue Culture—COS-7 cells were grown at 10% CO2 and 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glutamax (21885–025, Invitrogen) adjusted with 10% fetal bovine serum, 180 units/ml penicillin, and 45 μg/ml streptomycin (PenStrep). Transfection of the COS-7 cells was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (16.Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Bräuner-Osborne H. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 956-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Binding Experiments—COS-7 cells were transferred to culture plates 1 day after transfection. The number of cells seeded per well was determined by the apparent expression efficiency of the receptors and was aimed at obtaining 5–10% specific binding of the added radioactive ligand (2 × 104 to 1 × 105 cells/well for the different CXCR4 constructs). Two days after transfection, cells were assayed by competition binding for 3 h at 4 °C using 32 pm [125I]12G5 plus unlabeled ligand in 0.5 ml of a 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. After incubation, cells were washed quickly 2× in 4 °C binding buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl. Nonspecific binding was determined as the binding in the presence of 0.1 μm unlabeled 12G5. Determinations were made in duplicates. Phosphatidyl-inositol Assay (PI-turnover)—COS-7 cells were transfected according to the procedure mentioned above. Briefly, 6 × 106 cells were transfected with 20 μg of receptor cDNA in addition to 30 μgofthe promiscuous chimeric G-protein, GαΔ6qi4myr, which turns the Gαi-coupled signal (the most common pathway for endogenous chemokine receptors) into the Gαq pathway (phospholipase C activation measured as PI-turnover; Ref. 17.Kostenis E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 560-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). One day after transfection, COS-7 cells (2.5 × 104 cells/well) were incubated for 24 h with 2 μCi of [3H]myo-inositol in 0.4 ml of growth medium per well. Cells were washed twice in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, supplemented with 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and were incubated in 0.4 ml of buffer supplemented with 10 mm LiCl at 37 °C for 90 min in the presence of various concentrations of chemokines or AMD analogs together with a constant concentration of chemokine corresponding to 80% of maximal stimulation. Cells were extracted by the addition of 1 ml of 10 mm formic acid to each well, followed by incubation on ice for 30–60 min. The generated [3H]inositol phosphates were purified on AG 1-X8 anion-exchange resin (18.Berridge M.J. Dawson M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvin R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). Determinations were made in duplicates. Calculations—IC50 and EC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression, and Bmax values were calculated by using Prism version 3.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego). Mapping of the Binding Site for AMD3100 in the CXCR4 Receptor—Based on knowledge of cyclam-carboxylic acid interactions, two acid residues located at each end of the main ligand-binding pocket of the CXCR4 receptor, Asp171 (AspIV: 20) and Asp262 (AspVI:23), have previously been identified as key interaction points for AMD3100 (9.Gerlach L.O. Skerlj R.T. Bridger G.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14153-14160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 19.Labrosse B. Brelot A. Heveker N. Sol N. Schols D. De Clercq E. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6381-6388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Table I and Fig. 2, these 2 positions plus 15 other positions in TM-III, -IV, -V, -VI, and -VII of the CXCR4 receptor were probed by mutational substitutions using the radio-labeled monoclonal antibody, 12G5, as a radioligand. In most cases, the side chain was substituted with the small methyl group of Ala. However, in some cases, a structurally similar but uncharged Asn residue was introduced instead of a charged Asp; in some cases, steric-hindrance mutagenesis was performed through introduction of larger side chains such as Phe or Trp for Ala, Gly, or Ile (20.Holst B. Zoffmann S. Elling C.E. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). None of the substitutions impaired 12G5 binding to the CXCR4 receptor as reflected in the Kd and Bmax values presented in Table I, indicating that the overall structure as well as the cell surface expression of the receptor was unaffected by the mutations. However, five of the substitutions impaired the binding of AMD3100 more than 10-fold. Substitution of As-pIV:20 (Asp171) to Asn has previously been shown to affect AMD3100 38-fold in competition against the natural chemokine ligand SDF-1α (9.Gerlach L.O. Skerlj R.T. Bridger G.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14153-14160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, when using 12G5 as a radioligand, this substitution only resulted in a 15-fold impairment of AMD3100 binding. In contrast, substitution of AlaIV:24 (Ala175, located four residues after AspIV:20) with a Phe residue affected AMD3100 binding 40-fold. In the x-ray crystal structure of rhodopsin, the residue which corresponds to Ala175 is located at the start of extracellular loop 2 facing down into the main ligand-binding pocket. The relatively large effect of the steric-hindrance substitution of Ala175 with Phe is in good agreement with the assumption that one of the cyclam rings of AMD3100 should be located in the pocket between TM-III, -IV, and -V, i.e. in front of Asp171, which is where the large aromatic side chain of the introduced Phe residue would be expected to be located in the (A175F) mutant.Table IAffinity of 12G5, AMD3100, and AMD3100 (Zn2) for the wild-type CXCR4 and large amount of mutations located in the main binding pocket The data were obtained from competition binding with 125I (Bolton-Hunter)-labeled 12G5 antibody as radioligand on transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Values in parentheses indicate the number of experiments. Maximum specific binding for each mutant is given as Bmax (fmol/105 cell). Fmut indicates the effect of the mutant on the affinity of each ligand compared to wildtype affinity.ResidueBmax ± SEM12G5AMD3100AMD3479NumberPositionlog Kd ± SEMKd(N)fmutlog Ki ± SEMKi(N)fmutlog Ki ± SEMKi(N)fmutfmol/105 cellnmumumwtCXCR4137 ± 37–8.80 ± 0.091.57(19)1.0–6.05 ± 0.110.89(17)1.0–7.61 ± 0.100.02(9)1.0TM-IIIH113AIII:0349 ± 14–8.79 ± 0.231.63(4)1.0–5.75 ± 0.191.8(7)2.0–7.00 ± 0.220.10(4)4.1T117AIII:0761 ± 28–9.21 ± 0.150.62(5)0.4–6.34 ± 0.090.46(5)0.5–7.86 ± 0.090.01(4)0.6TM-IVT168AV:1785 ± 49–9.20 ± 0.190.63(6)0.4–6.13 ± 0.120.74(6)0.8–7.84 ± 0.260.01(4)0.6D171NIV:2070 ± 11–9.06 ± 0.090.87(14)0.6–4.87 ± 0.1313(13)15–6.55 ± 0.230.28(11)12F174AIV:2344 ± 15–9.29 ± 0.240.51(5)0.3–5.50 ± 0.163.16(5)3.5–6.17 ± 0.310.68(4)28A175FIV:2442 ± 21–8.81 ± 0.121.55(4)1.0–4.45 ± 0.2436(4)40–5.07 ± 0.348.6(3)350TM-VV196AV:0127 ± 6–9.05 ± 0.100.89(4)0.6–5.33 ± 0.134.6(4)5.2–5.78 ± 0.171.7(3)68Q200AV:05139 ± 15–9.31 ± 0.140.49(3)0.3–6.25 ± 0.100.56(3)0.6–7.75 ± 0.070.02(3)0.7G207WV:12117 ± 76–9.03 ± 0.320.93(4)0.6–5.52 ± 0.333.02(4)3.4–6.60 ± 0.050.25(2)10TM-VIY255AVI:16235 ± 101–8.87 ± 0.131.36(4)0.9–5.01 ± 0.279.7(4)11–6.28 ± 0.090.53(3)22Y256AV:17172 ± 73–8.87 ± 0.161.36(4)0.9–5.40 ± 0.334.0(3)5–6.73 ± 0.230.19(4)7.6I259AVI:2040 ± 8–9.52 ± 0.120.30(3)0.2–5.81 ± 0.051.5(3)1.7–7.56 ± 0.060.03(3)1.1I259WVI:2071 ± 6–8.99 ± 0.161.03(3)0.7–5.34 ± 0.334.6(3)5.2–6.08 ± 0.360.84(2)34D262NVI:23162 ± 59–8.94 ± 0.131.15(13)0.7–4.34 ± 0.1546(13)52–4.89 ± 0.5813(3)522S263AV:24101 ± 44–9.44 ± 0.200.36(3)0.2–5.27 ± 0.145.4(3)6.1–7.10 ± 0.170.08(3)3.2TM-VIIH281AVII:-01116 ± 35–9.08 ± 0.160.83(8)0.5–6.80 ± 0.210.16(11)0.2–7.54 ± 0.140.03(5)1.2I284AVII:02116 ± 16–8.83 ± 0.141.47(5)0.9–5.96 ± 0.361.1(4)1.2–6.64 ± 0.070.23(3)9.3E288AVII:06140 ± 46–9.02 ± 0.060.96(16)0.6–4.20 ± 0.1763(15)71–5.64 ± 0.322.3(3)93 Open table in a new tab None of the substitutions in TM-V affected AMD3100 more than 5-fold, whereas in TM-VI, the mutational analysis (as expected) pointed to AspVI:23 (Asp262) but also to TyrVI:16 (Tyr255) as being interaction points for AMD3100. Surprisingly, substitution of IleVI:20 (Ile259, located in between these two residues and facing right into the middle of the main ligand-binding pocket) had only minimal effect on AMD3100 binding (Table I and Fig. 2). Even the introduction of a large Trp residue in position VI:20 only gave a 5-fold effect on AMD3100 binding. In TM-VII, substitution of IleVII:02 (Ile284) had no effect on AMD3100 binding, despite the fact that this residue (like IleVI: 20) is facing directly into the main pocket and at a location close to AspVI:23. In contrast, substitution of GluVII:06 (Glu288) to Ala affected AMD3100 around 70-fold. Thus, besides the previously described Asp171 and Asp262, the major result of the mutational analysis using 12G5 as a radioligand was the identification of an additional acid residue Glu288 as a potential interaction point for AMD3100. Effect of Zn(II) on the Mutational Mapping of AMD3100 Binding—Binding of Zn(II) in the cyclam rings of AMD3100 is known to increase its affinity for the CXCR4 receptor around 35-fold (Table I; Refs. 21.Bridger G.J. Skerlj R.T. Adv. Antiviral Drug Des. 1999; 3: 161-229Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar and 22.Gerlach L.O. Jakobsen J.S. Jensen K.P. Rosenkilde M.R. Skerlj R.T. Ryde U. Bridger G.J. Schwartz T.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Previously, we have found that this increased affinity in fact is determined by only one of the Zn(II) ions in one of the cyclam rings and that the effect is achieved through interaction with the carboxylic group of AspVI:23 (Asp262) (22.Gerlach L.O.

When the Zn(II)-loaded AMD3100 (also called AMD3479) was probed in the library of mutated CXCR4 receptors, an interesting picture emerged. The four to five residues that were identified as interaction points for AMD3100 itself were all positive, but the effects of the mutations were in all cases (except for Asp171) larger for the Zn(II)-loaded version than for AMD3100 alone (Table I and Fig. 2). Moreover, a number of substitutions which had given small, single-digit effects for AMD3100 now gave clear, i.e. > 10-fold, effects for the Zn(II)-loaded version: 28-versus 3.5-fold (PheIV:23 or Phe174), 68-versus 5.2-fold (ValV:01 or Val196), and 34-versus 5.2-fold (IleVI:20 or Ile259) (Table I and Fig. 2). Important Acidic Residue in TM-VII for the Binding of AMD3100 —GluVII:06 (Glu288) is clearly the most interesting among the novel potential interaction sites for AMD3100, because the only other mutation which has a relatively large effect on the binding of the antagonist (Ala175 to Phe) is considered to be a reflection of steric hindrance. As shown in Fig. 3, by using [125I]12G5 as a radioligand, the Glu288 to Ala substitution shifted the competition binding curve for AMD3100 with or without Zn(II) 70- to 90-fold to the right. We were unable to use [125I]SDF-1α as radioligand in binding experiments in this construct because of a lack of specific binding (data not shown). This is very likely a reflection of a decreased affinity of SDF-1α on the Glu288 to Ala mutant receptor, as the potency of SDF-1α in signaling was impaired 87-fold in this construct (Fig. 4A). Thus, Glu288 seems to be a residue that is critical for the function of SDF-1α as an agonist on the CXCR4 receptor. By using appropriate sub-maximal doses of SDF-1α on the wild-type and on the Glu288 to Ala mutant form of CXCR4, respectively, it was possible to demonstrate that, not only the affinity (Table I and Fig. 3), but also the potency of AMD3100 (with or without Zn(II)) were highly dependent on the presence of a Glu in position VII:06. Thus, in the wild-type CXCR4, receptor potencies of 79 nm and 17 nm were observed for AMD3100 and the Zn(II)-loaded version, respectively, whereas right shifts of 23- to 116-fold of the bicyclam inhibition curves were observed in the Glu288 to Ala mutant form of CXCR4 (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Effect of Glu to Ala substitution at position VII:06 (Glu288) in CXCR4 on SDF-1-induced PI-turnover and inhibition by AMD3100. Whole-cell phospholipase C activity (PI-turnover) was measured in COS-7 cells after co-transfection of receptor cDNA with a promiscuous, chimeric G protein Gqi4myr (as described in detail under “Experimental Procedures”). Dose-response curves for SDF-1 are shown in A: wild-type receptor (▵) and E288A-CXCR4 (▴).

(n = 3–5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thus, the overall picture for the AMD3100 binding mode is that it is critically dependent on two acid residues at the extracellular ends of transmembrane segments VI and VII, AspVI:23 and GluVII:06, respectively, plus one Asp residue located at the opposite end of the main ligand-binding pocket, i.e. in position IV:20. Surprisingly, few other residues that are known to be lining each end of the pocket as well as the space in between seem to be directly involved in the recognition of the relatively large bicyclam compound. For the Zn(II)-loaded version of AMD3100, a similar picture is observed; however, the dependence on Asp262 is increased 10-fold, and a number of other residues on the inner face of TM-IV, -V, and -VI are picked up in the mutational analysis. Transfer of the Binding Site for AMD3100 to the CXCR3 Receptor—A survey of the main ligand-binding pocket of all human 7TM receptors revealed that the combination of AspIV: 20, AspVI:23, and GluVII:06 is unique to the CXCR4 receptor, which is in agreement with the fact that AMD3100 is known to be a highly selective antagonist for the CXCR4 receptor (23.Hatse S. Princen K. Bridger G. De Clercq E. Schols D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). However, among the chemokine receptors, we verified that the CXCR3 receptor had two of the three residues, i.e. AspIV:20 and AspVI:23, but that it had a Ser residue in position VII:06 instead of a Glu as in CXCR4 (Fig. 5). Interestingly, at position VII:02, a Lys residue is located in the CXCR3 receptor (Lys300), which very likely will form a neutralizing salt bridge with AspVI:23 (Asp278) because of the close proximity of the extracellular ends of TM-VI and VII (Fig. 5). Thus, in the CXCR3 receptor, it is very likely that of the three proposed key residues, only one, AspIV:20 (Asp186), is available for interaction with AMD3100. To try to verify the proposed binding site for AMD3100, which in the CXCR4 receptor is based on mutational “destruction” of the binding and function of the non-peptide antagonist, we attempted to use the binding pocket of the CXCR3 receptor as a scaffold to gradually build up the binding site for the antagonist. As expected, AMD3100 had no effect on the inositol phosphate accumulation induced by the agonist chemokines ITAC or IP10 in the CXCR3 receptor. Moreover, neither introduction of Glu at position VII:06 nor substitution of LysVII:02 with a non-neutralizing Ala residue changed this (Fig. 6). However, in the CXCR3 construct, where these two substitutions were combined to ensure the presence and exposure of all three proposed key interacting residues for AMD3100, the bicyclam antagonist inhibited in a dose-dependent manner both the ITAC and the IP10-induced signaling, with IC50 values of 1.1 and 9.3 μm, respectively (Fig. 6). However, only a partial inhibition down to 35–40% of the maximal stimulation was observed with AMD3100. As shown in Fig. 7, this was not the case for the Zn(II)- or Ni(II)-loaded analogs of AMD3100 which acted as full antagonists.Fig. 7Improvement of the inhibitory potency and efficacy of AMD3100 in inhibiting agonist-induced IP turnover in the K300A,S304E-CXCR3 receptor. Dose-dependent inhibition of 10 nm ITAC (A and B) or 10 nm IP10 (C and D) induced IP turnover by AMD3100 (▪) and by the Zn(II)-loaded version (▴) (A and C) or the Ni(II)-loaded version (⋄) (B and D).

Thus, for the Zn(II)-loaded AMD3100, left-shifts of 19- to 69-fold were observed in the inhibition of the ITAC- and IP10-induced act"

This study investigated the significance of PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced NF-κB activation in transformed, immortalized, and primary cells. Pharmacological inhibition of PI 3-kinase blocked TNF-induced NF-κB DNA binding in the 293 line of embryonic kidney cells, partially affected binding in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, HeLa and ME-180 cervical carcinoma cells, and NIH 3T3 cells but was without significant effect in H1299 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, cell types in which TNF activated Akt. NF-κB is retained in the cytoplasm by inhibitory proteins, IκBs, which are phosphorylated and targeted for degradation by IκB kinases (IKKα and IKKβ). Expression and the ratios of IKKα and IKKβ, which homo- and heterodimerize, varied among cell types. Cells with a high proportion of IKKα (the IKK kinase activated by Akt) to IKKβ were most sensitive to PI 3-kinase inhibitors. Consequently, transient expression of IKKβ diminished the capacity of the inhibitors to block NF-κB DNA binding in 293 cells. Also, inhibitors of PI 3-kinase blocked NF-κB DNA binding in Ikkβ–/– but not Ikkα–/– or wild-type cells in which the ratio of IKKα to IKKβ is low.

However, PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling induced by TNF in human umbilical vein endothelial cells inhibits apoptosis without playing a significant role in activation of NF-κB (49.Madge L.A. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15458-15465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Akt can activate a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) family, Cot, and indirectly affect IKK activity and NF-κB (50.Kane L.P. Mollenauer M.N. Xu Z. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5962-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling is upstream of diverse pathways that activate NF-κB. However, the mechanisms through which PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling activates NF-κB are cell type-specific, and surrogate pathways also affect NF-κB.The goal of the present study was to determine the basis for the cell type specificity with which PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling activates NF-κB. We demonstrate that the ability of PI 3-kinase inhibitors to impair TNF-induced DNA binding of NF-κB is cell type-specific. Such specificity does not necessarily result from alterations in the ability of TNF to activate Akt, as this capacity was observed in seven different cell types, including primary cells. Rather, the proportion of IKKα to IKKβ varies among cells, and those cells in which the ratio of IKKα, the target for Akt phosphorylation, to IKKβ is high are most susceptible to the ability of PI 3-kinase inhibitors to impair NF-κB DNA binding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor was a gift from Genentech Inc.

DNA protein complexes were size-fractionated on native 5% polyacrylamide gels, dried, and exposed to film for autoradiography.RESULTSWe previously showed that PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling induces NF-κB DNA binding in 293 cells (42.Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). However, this observation has not been observed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (49.Madge L.A. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15458-15465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Experiments were therefore conducted to test whether the effect of PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling on NF-κB DNA binding is cell type-specific. To accomplish this, we used EMSAs to test the effect of the inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, LY294002 and wortmannin, on TNF-induced NF-κB DNA binding in seven different cell types. As illustrated in Fig. 1, NF-κB DNA binding was induced by TNF in each cell type. The NF-κB DNA binding complex was identified by supershifting with an antibody to p65 (RelA) (Fig. 1, far right lane in each EMSA). LY294002 or wortmannin variably affected TNF-induced NF-κB DNA binding. The inhibitors completely blocked TNF-induced NF-κB DNA binding in 293 cells, partially blocked binding in MCF-7, ME-180, HeLa, and NIH 3T3 cells, but had little effect on binding in H1299 cells and HUVEC.The variable efficacy with which PI 3-kinase inhibitors blocked TNF-induced NF-κB DNA binding led us to test whether Akt activation might be attenuated or defective in some cell types. Akt activity was assayed by probing Western blots prepared from lysates of TNF-treated cells with an antibody that exclusively recognizes the Akt, which is phosphorylated on serine 473 and therefore is active. TNF activated Akt in each cell type used to characterize the effect of PI 3-kinase inhibitors on NF-κB DNA binding in Fig. 1, although the kinetics and extent of activation varied from one cell type to another (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Activation of Akt by TNF. Western blots prepared from lysates of serum-starved cells treated with 1 nm TNF for various times were probed with anti-phospho-Ser473 (active) Akt or anti-Akt to normalize for protein loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Activation of Akt by TNF could not account for the varied cellular sensitivity to LY294002. Because our previous work suggested that IKKα is the IKK kinase upon which Akt acts (42.Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar), we focused on the possibility that expression of the IKK kinases might be a determinant in the capacity of PI 3-kinase inhibitors to affect NF-κB DNA binding. Expression of IKKα and IKKβ in cell lines was therefore examined. Western blots showed that the amount of IKKα and IKKβ varies among cell types (Fig. 3a). Additionally, we reproducibly observed faster and slower migrating forms of IKKβ in cells. Although the basis for this heterogeneity is not yet defined, it might result from phosphorylation of IKKβ by diverse kinases in cells. Densitometry quantified the proportion of IKKα to IKKβ (Fig. 3b). In 293 cells the proportion of IKKα to IKKβ was highest among the cell types tested. H1299 cells and HUVEC contain a very low proportion of IKKα to IKKβ. In ME180, HeLa, MCF-7, and NIH 3T3 cells, the proportion of IKKα to IKKβ favors IKKβ but not so greatly as in H1299 cells and HUVEC. These observations show that the proportion of IKKα to IKKβ differs among cells. Also, a high proportion of IKKα to IKKβ correlates with the ability of PI 3-kinase inhibitors to block TNF-induced NF-κB DNA binding.Fig. 3Cellular expression of IKKα and IKKβ. a, Western blots prepared from lysates of various cell types were probed with antibodies directed against IKKα, IKKβ, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). b, densitometry assayed the relative levels of the IKK subunits, and the bar graph represents IKKα/IKKβ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To demonstrate whether the proportion of IKKα to IKKβ affects the role of PI 3-kinase in NF-κB DNA binding, the proportion of the kinases was altered by transient transfection of 293 cells, in which the IKKα/IKKβ proportion is high. These, or vector-transfected control cells, were treated with wortmannin and stimulated with TNF or medium, and NF-κB DNA binding was assayed. Wortmannin abrogated TNF-induced NF-κB DNA binding in 293 cells transfected with empty vector but had lesser effect in cells transfected with IKKβ (Fig. 4a). Quantitation of the observations just described showed that inhibition of PI 3-kinase in cells transfected with empty vector diminished NF-κB DNA binding by 66%, whereas NF-κB DNA binding was diminished by only 33% in cells transfected with IKKβ. Reproducibly, expression of IKKβ in 293 cells increased DNA binding, an effect that may relate to its ability to phosphorylate IκBα more effectively than IKKα (22.Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L.C.

Western blot analysis confirmed that the cellular content of IKKβ was greatly increased in cells transfected with IKKβ (Fig. 4b). This experiment showed that by altering the proportion of IKKα to IKKβ in favor of the latter, the sensitivity of NF-κB DNA binding to PI 3-kinase inhibition is diminished. These observations support the conclusion that the proportion of IKKα to IKKβ determines the sensitivity of NF-κB DNA binding to blockade by PI 3-kinase inhibitors.Fig. 4Alteration of the proportion of IKKα to IKKβ changes the sensitivity of NF-κB DNA binding to inhibition by wortmannin (Wort). 293 cells were transfected with empty vector or IKKβ, and 24 h thereafter the cells were subjected to serum starvation for 24 h, incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nm wortmannin for 1 h, and then treated with 1 nm TNF for 30 min. a, NF-κB DNA binding was assayed by EMSA using equal amounts of protein from cell lysates. b, Western blot analysis demonstrated overexpression of IKKβ in cells transfected with this kinase. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. This autoradiograph was developed for a shorter period than that in Fig. 3a to permit visualization of the extent to which IKKβ was overexpressed in transfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To support these observations, wild-type MEFs or MEFs from IKKα- or IKKβ-deficient mice were used to assess the sensitivity of NF-κB DNA binding to inhibitors of PI 3-kinase. Serum-starved wild-type, Ikkα –/–, and Ikkβ –/– MEFs treated for 1 h with Me2SO or 20 μm LY294002 were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline or 1 nm TNF for 30 min. TNF increased DNA binding in the parental or knockout MEFs, but LY294002 inhibited NF-κB DNA binding only in Ikkβ –/– cells (Fig. 5a). Supershifting using anti-p65 showed that NF-κB DNA binding complexes from parental, Ikkβ–/–, and Ikkα–/– MEFs contained this subunit. These observations causally relate the effect of PI 3-kinase inhibitors on NF-κB DNA binding and the proportion and expression of IKKα and IKKβ.Fig. 5Effect of PI 3-kinase inhibition on NF-κB DNA binding in MEFs. a, serum-starved MEFs were treated with Me2SO or 20 μm LY294002 for 1 h prior to stimulation with vehicle or 1 nm TNF for 30 min at 37 °C. NF-κB DNA binding was assayed by EMSA using equal amounts of protein from lysates. WT, wild type; ab, antibody. b, equal amounts of protein from lysates of wild-type, Ikkα–/–, or Ikkβ–/– mouse embryo fibroblasts were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and a Western blot was probed with antibodies to IKKα, IKKβ, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). c, a Western blot prepared from lysates of H1299 cells and wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts was probed with antibodies to IKKα, IKKβ, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our previous observations (Ref. 42.Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar and figures herein) suggested that IKKα is the target for Akt in IκB kinase complexes. The inability of PI 3-kinase inhibitors to affect NF-κB DNA binding in wild-type MEFs therefore led us to predict that this cell type would have a low proportion of IKKβ relative to IKKα when compared with other cell types. To evaluate this prediction, we first confirmed the phenotypes of wild-type, Ikkα–/–, and Ikkβ–/– MEFs insofar as IκB kinase expression is concerned. Western blot analysis of the expression of the IκB kinases revealed that wild-type MEFs express IKKα and IKKβ, Ikkα–/– MEFs express IKKβ but not IKKα, and Ikkβ–/– MEFs express IKKα but not IKKβ (Fig. 5b). Having confirmed the phenotypes of the cells in this study, we compared the expression of IKKα to IKKβ in H1299 cells and wild-type MEFs. It was observed (Fig. 5c) that the proportion of IKKα to IKKβ was similarly low in H1299 cells and wild-type MEFs. Also, IKKα in human H1299 cells displayed a somewhat greater apparent molecular weight than IKKα in murine wild-type MEFs. The results obtained from these experiments are consistent with the conclusion that in comparisons among different cell types, a high proportion of IKKβ relative to IKKα diminishes the ability of inhibitors of PI 3-kinase to block NF-κB DNA binding.DISCUSSIONA high molecular weight IκB kinase complex called a signal-some (15.DiDonato J.A.

It binds zinc, heparin/heparan sulfate, laminin, and sulfatides and inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth. Here we determined the kinetics and affinity of the interaction of endostatin with heparin/heparan sulfate and investigated the effects of divalent cations on these interactions and on the biological activities of endostatin. The binding of human recombinant endostatin to heparin and heparan sulfate was studied by surface plasmon resonance using BIAcore technology and further characterized by docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Kinetic data, evaluated using a 1:1 interaction model, showed that heparan sulfate bound to and dissociated from endostatin faster than heparin and that endostatin bound to heparin and heparan sulfate with a moderate affinity (KD ∼ 2 μm). Molecular modeling of the complex between endostatin and heparin oligosaccharides predicted that, compared with mutagenesis studies, two further arginine residues, Arg47 and Arg66, participated in the binding. The binding of endostatin to heparin and heparan sulfate required the presence of divalent cations. The addition of ZnCl2 to endostatin enhanced its binding to heparan sulfate by ∼40% as well as its antiproliferative effect on endothelial cells stimulated by fibroblast growth factor-2, suggesting that this activity is mediated by the binding of endostatin to heparan sulfate. In contrast, no increase in the antiangiogenic and anti-proliferative activities of endostatin promoted by vascular endothelial growth factor was observed upon the addition of zinc.

Endostatin (20 kDa), first identified by O'Reilly et al. (1.O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E. Birkhead J.R. Olsen B.R. Folkman J.

It inhibits tumor angiogenesis by interfering at several levels with growth factor signaling (2.Ramchandran R. Karumanchi S.A. Hanai J. Alper S.L. Sukhatme V.P. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 2002; 12: 175-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Two heparin-binding sites have been identified in endostatin involving two clusters of arginine residues, and a zinc binding site is located in the N-terminal part of the molecule (see Refs. 3.Marneros A.G.

The possibility that its anti-angiogenic effect might be related to displacement of angiogenic factors from the surface of endothelial cells through binding of heparan sulfate has prompted several investigations of its interaction with heparin and heparan sulfate (6.Sasaki T.

Zinc binding has been reported to be essential for the anti-angiogenic activity of endostatin (11.Boehm T. O'Reilly M.S. Keough K. Shiloach J. Shapiro R. Folkman J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Indeed, mutations of amino acids involved in zinc coordination to alanines significantly reduce its anti-tumoral activity, the mutants being unable to cause regression of Lewis lung carcinoma (11.Boehm T.

On the other hand, zinc binding does not appear to be critical for the inhibitory effects of endostatin on VEGF 1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; FGF-2, fibroblast growth factor-2; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; RU, resonance unit; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; EBNA, Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen; PIM, Perez Imberty Meyer.-induced migration and tumor growth in mice (12.Yamaguchi N.

However, it is of crucial importance to determine the co-factors, if any, that participate in the binding of endostatin to heparin, because heparin binding is required for the inhibition of FGF-2-induced angiogenesis in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (7.Sasaki T.

The aim of this work was to study the interactions of endostatin with heparin and its physiological ligand, heparan sulfate, to (i) determine the affinity of these interactions and the corresponding interaction models by performing surface plasmon resonance (SPR) kinetic analysis, (ii) identify the structural features of heparin and heparan sulfate participating in the binding to endostatin using SPR binding assays and molecular modeling, and (iii) investigate the effect of divalent cations on the interaction of endostatin with heparin/heparan sulfate and on its anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative activities in vitro. Production and Purification of Human Endostatin—Recombinant human endostatin was produced by human embryonic kidney cells expressing Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (293-EBNA cells). A construct was generated for expression of endostatin with the oligopeptide epitope of influenza virus hemagglutinin (flag) at the N-terminal end (12.Yamaguchi N. Anand-Apte B. Lee M. Sasaki T. Fukai N. Shapiro R. Que I. Lowik C. Timpl R. Olsen B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4414-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The conditioned culture medium was filtered through 0.22-μm filters and applied to a Hi-Trap heparin column (5 ml, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl. Endostatin was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl concentration from 0.15 to 1 m and further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex S75 column (2.6 × 60 cm, Amersham Biosciences) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (Sigma). Purified endostatin was concentrated by ultrafiltration and stored at -20 °C. Recombinant human endostatin produced in Pichia pastoris was used as well as endostatin commercially available from Calbiochem. Surface Plasmon Resonance Binding Assays Using BIAcore Technology—The SPR measurements were performed on a BIAcore Upgrade and on a BIAcore 3000 instruments (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Streptavidin (100 μg/ml in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.0) was covalently immobilized to the dextran matrix of an F1 sensor chip via its primary amine groups (amine coupling kit, BIAcore AB) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Activation and blocking steps were performed as described previously (14.Ricard-Blum S. Bernocco S. Font B. Moali C. Eichenberger D. Farjanel J. Burchardt E.R. van der Rest M. Kessler E. Hulmes D.J.

Heparin (from porcine intestinal mucosa, 16 kDa, Sigma) and heparan sulfate (from porcine intestinal mucosa, Celsus, Cincinnati, OH) were biotinylated at their reducing ends (15.Amara A. Lorthioir O.

An immobilization level ranging between 70 and 200 resonance units (RU) was obtained. A control flow cell was prepared by immobilizing only streptavidin. Control sensorgrams were automatically subtracted from the sensorgrams obtained with immobilized heparin or heparan sulfate to yield true binding responses (14.Ricard-Blum S. Bernocco S. Font B.

Binding assays were performed at 25 °C in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.005% (v/v) P20 surfactant (HBS-P buffer, BIAcore AB). Endostatin was dialyzed against this buffer and injected at several concentrations and different flow rates over immobilized glycosaminoglycans. The surface was then regenerated with a pulse of 1 m sodium chloride. The kinetic parameters ka and kd (association and dissociation rate constants, respectively) were analyzed simultaneously using a global data analysis program (BIAevaluation 3.1 software). This software also fitted simultaneously the sensorgrams obtained at different concentrations of endostatin, constraining the kinetic rate constants to a single value for each set of curves. Apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were calculated as the ratio of kd/ka. Rmax, the maximal capacity of the surface was floated during the fitting procedure. The χ2 value is a standard statistical measure of the closeness of fit. It represents the mean square of the signal noise (BIAevaluation 3.0, Software Handbook). Heparin and Heparan Sulfate Oligosaccharides and Desulfated Heparins—Heparin oligosaccharides of a defined size were prepared by digestion of heparin with heparinase I followed by gel filtration chromatography on a Bio-Gel P-10 column (16.Sadir R. Baleux F. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8288-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate oligosaccharides were prepared by digestion of heparan sulfate by heparinase III. Selectively desulfated heparins were kindly provided by Prof. John Gallagher (Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital National Health Service Trust, Manchester, UK). Heparin initially contained 97.7% of the N-sulfate groups, 89.3% of the 2-O-sulfate groups, and 92.4% of the 6-O-sulfate groups. De-N-sulfated/re-N-acetylated heparin contained 90.5% of the 2-O-sulfate groups, 85.3% of the 6-O-sulfates, and a very low amount of remaining N-sulfate groups (2.4%). De-2-O-sulfated heparin contained 80.2% of the 6-O-sulfate groups, 91.4% of the N-sulfate groups, and a residual 2.2% of the 2-O-sulfates. De-6-O-sulfated heparin contained 98.2% of the N-sulfate groups, 54.7% of the 2-O-sulfate groups, and a residual 4.2% of the 6-O-sulfates (17.Lyon M. Rushton G. Askari J.A. Humphries M. Gallagher J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4599-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). De-O-sulfated heparin contained 91.6% of the N-sulfates, 7.1% of the 2-O-sulfates, and 3.6% of the 6-O-sulfates. Docking Calculations—The starting model of human endostatin was made from the crystal structure of the monomer (18.Ding Y.H. Javaherian K. Lo K.M. Chopra R. Boehm T. Lanciotti J. Harris B.A. Li Y. Shapiro R. Hohenester E. Timpl R. Folkman J. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27907) Google Scholar). All graphical editions were performed with the SYBYL package (Tripos Inc., St Louis, MO). Hydrogen atoms were added to the protein, and Connolly surfaces were calculated using the MOLCAD program (20.Waldherr-Teschner M. Goetze T. Heiden W. Knoblauch M. Vollhardt H. Brickmann J. Post F.H. Hin A.J.S. Advances in Scientific Visualization. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1992: 58-67Crossref Google Scholar). Monosaccharide Docking—Docking of monosaccharide was performed using the AutoDock 3.0 program (21.Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9301) Google Scholar). AMBER force field charges were assigned to all protein atoms. Because no parameter exists for the zinc atom, it was not considered in the calculations. During an AutoDock 3.0 simulation, multiple Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm runs occurred, each one providing one solution (i.e. one predicted binding mode), and cluster analysis was performed at the end of the simulation. Solutions that were within a 1-Å root-mean-square deviation of each other belonged to the same cluster, and the clusters were ranked according to their lowest energy member. A dielectric constant of 4 r was selected for the calculations because water molecules are almost excluded from the interface between the protein and the charged monosaccharide. Three sulfated monosaccharides, i.e. methyl-O-(2-deoxy-2-N-sulfo-6-mono)-α-d-glucopyranoside (Fig. 1, 1) and the methyl-O-(2-O-sulfo)-α-l-idupyranosuronate in its 1C4 and 2SO shape (Fig. 1, 2 and 3), were considered for docking. Atomic coordinates for the sulfated monosaccharides were extracted from a data bank of the three-dimensional structures (infopc2.cermav.cnrs.fr/databank/monosaccharides/), and partial charges were assigned to the atoms according to the PIM force field (16.Sadir R. Baleux F. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8288-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 22.Imberty A. Bettler E. Karababa M. Mazeau K. Petrova P. Pérez S. Vijayan M. Yathindra N. Kolaskar A.S. Perspectives in Structural Biology. Indian Academy of Sciences and Universities Press, Hyderabad1999: 392-409Google Scholar). Grids of probe atom interaction energies and electrostatic potential were generated around the whole protein using the AutoGrid program present in AutoDock 3.0 with a spacing of 0.5 Å. All probes were placed arbitrarily at a distance of 10 Å from the protein surface, and their rotatable torsion angles were allowed to rotate freely. For each monosaccharide one job of 100 docking runs was performed using a population of 200 individuals and an energy evaluation number of 2 × 106. Decasaccharide Docking—The structures of two heparin decamers that differ in the conformation of the iduronate residue (1C4 or 2SO) were extracted from the Protein Data Bank (code 1HPN) (23.Mulloy B. Forster M.J. Jones C. Davies D.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Partial charges were assigned as described above. Because of the limitation of the docking program, the docking was performed using a rigid body approach, and the largest possible ligand that could be considered was a decasaccharide. This ligand was placed 10 Å away from the surface of the protein, in a 30 × 46.5 × 46.5-Å box with 0.375-Å grid spacing, covering the putative binding site surface. For each decasaccharide, one job of 100 runs was performed using a population of 200 individuals and an energy evaluation number of 3 × 106. Molecular Dynamics Simulation—To introduce some flexibility into the system a 200 ps molecular dynamics on the protein-heparin complex was performed at 300 K. The TRIPOS force field (24.Clark M. Cramer R.D.I. van den Opdenbosch N. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 8: 982-1012Google Scholar) was used with Pullman partial charges assigned to the protein. PIM parameters especially developed for these types of sugars (16.Sadir R. Baleux F. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8288-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 22.Imberty A. Bettler E. Karababa M. Mazeau K. Petrova P. Pérez S. Vijayan M. Yathindra N. Kolaskar A.S. Perspectives in Structural Biology. Indian Academy of Sciences and Universities Press, Hyderabad1999: 392-409Google Scholar) were employed for the heparin oligosaccharide. The protein backbone was kept fixed during the simulation. The molecular dynamics simulation was ended by a 30-ps simulated annealing process at 50 K, to pull the complex into a low energy conformation. The starting complex structures were derived from the lowest energy docked conformers. Two molecular dynamics simulations were performed using heparin oligosaccharide with the reducing end in opposite orientations. Sprouting Angiogenesis from Embryonic Stem Cell-derived Embryoid Body Secondary Cultures into Type I Collagen Gels—Embryonic stem cells, line CJ7, were induced to differentiate in a semi-solid methylcellulose medium as described previously (25.Vittet D. Prandini M.H. Berthier R. Schweitzer A. Martin-Sisteron H. Uzan G. Dejana E. Blood. 1996; 88: 3424-3431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Vittet D. Buchou T. Schweitzer A. Dejana E. Huber P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6273-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). For secondary culture into collagen gel, 11-day-old embryoid bodies were collected by diluting the medium with IMDM Glutamax. After low speed centrifugation (180 × g, 5 min) and two further washes, embryoid bodies were suspended in fresh IMDM Glutamax and mixed with a collagen-containing culture medium at a final concentration of 50 embryoid bodies/ml, and 1.2 ml were poured into a 35-mm bacterial grade Petri dish (27.Féraud O. Cao Y. Vittet D. Lab. Investig. 2001; 81: 1669-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The final composition of the collagen-based culture medium was as follows: IMDM containing 1.25 mg/ml rat tail type I collagen (BD Biosciences), 15% fetal calf serum, 450 μm monothioglycerol, 10 μg/ml insulin, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (27.Féraud O. Cao Y. Vittet D. Lab. Investig. 2001; 81: 1669-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cultures were performed in the presence of 15 ng/ml VEGF (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Embryoid bodies were first preincubated with endostatin (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C in IMDM before being seeded into collagen medium containing VEGF. Quantitative analysis of sprouting angiogenesis was performed 3 days after secondary plating by computer-assisted morphometric analysis, after prior revelation of endothelial cells by CD31 immunostaining experiments (27.Féraud O. Cao Y. Vittet D. Lab. Investig. 2001; 81: 1669-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cell Proliferation Assays—The effect of endostatin on cell proliferation was tested on human umbilical vein endothelial cells stimulated by 10 ng/ml VEGF or 10 ng/ml FGF-2 as well as on the following cell lines: human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29, murine colon adenocarcinoma cell line C51, and human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Cells were grown in 96-well tissue culture plate (4 × 104 cells/well) for 24 h in a complete culture medium. The serum was then removed for 24 h before incubating the cells with 5 μg/ml endostatin in the presence or absence of 50 μm zinc chloride for 72 h. Cell proliferation was quantitated by a colorimetric cell proliferation assay containing a tetrazolium compound (Promega). Inhibition of Endostatin Binding to Heparin and Heparan Sulfate by Glycosaminoglycans—SPR binding assays confirmed that human recombinant endostatin from P. pastoris bound to immobilized heparin. This binding was strongly inhibited by heparin and to a lesser extent by dermatan sulfate from porcine intestinal mucosa and by chondroitin sulfate from bovine trachea (Fig. 2). No significant difference in inhibition was observed for heparin with different molecular masses (6 and 16 kDa). Heparan sulfate from bovine kidney was a very poor inhibitor compared with heparin, which inhibited 70% of the interaction at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. In contrast, heparan sulfate from porcine intestinal mucosa strongly inhibited the binding of endostatin to immobilized heparin (Fig. 2) and heparan sulfate (data not shown). Binding of Heparin and Heparan Sulfate Oligosaccharides to Endostatin—Heparin and heparan sulfate oligosaccharides were used to evaluate the minimum size of these two glycosaminoglycans required for endostatin binding using SPR inhibition experiments. The binding of endostatin to heparin or heparan sulfate increased with increasing length of heparin and heparan sulfate oligosaccharides (data not shown). The smallest size of heparin showing at least 50% inhibition of binding was a 12-mer oligosaccharide, whereas a longer oligosaccharide of heparan sulfate (16-mer) was required to achieve a similar level of inhibition. No significant inhibition was observed with the short heparan sulfate oligosaccharides (6- and 8-mer), whereas the heparin oligosaccharides of the same size inhibited endostatin binding to heparin by 22 and 34%, respectively, and to heparan sulfate by 14 and 21%. The inhibition by heparin and heparan sulfate oligosaccharides of endostatin binding to heparan sulfate was stronger than the inhibition of endostatin binding to heparin. N-Sulfation and 2-O-Sulfation of Heparin Are Involved in the Binding to Endostatin—Inhibition experiments were carried out with selectively desulfated heparins to identify the sulfate groups of heparin participating in the interaction with endostatin. Desulfated heparins were incubated for one h with endostatin before injection over heparin (Fig. 3A) or heparan sulfate (Fig. 3B). If a particular desulfated heparin retained its ability to interact with endostatin, the injection of the complex resulted in inhibition of endostatin binding to immobilized heparin or heparan sulfate. In this experimental set-up, a strong inhibition indicated that the removed sulfate groups were not involved in the binding. N-sulfation contributed the most to the binding of endostatin. The contribution of 2-O-sulfation to endostatin binding was also significant, whereas that of 6-O-desulfation was less. Endostatin Binds to Heparin and Heparan Sulfate with a Moderate Affinity—Kinetic analysis was performed by injecting different concentrations of endostatin either over immobilized heparan sulfate (Fig. 4) or heparin (data not shown). The dissociation rate of the complexes of endostatin with heparin or heparan sulfate was not influenced by the contact time (from 4 up to 8 min, data not shown). According to kinetic analysis using BIAevaluation software, two interaction models could account for the mechanism of endostatin binding to glycosaminoglycans: a 1:1 Langmuir model or a heterogeneous ligand model involving parallel reactions of each immobilized glycosaminoglycan with endostatin. The addition of a term that takes mass transfer into account did not improve the fitting of the experimental data. Mass transfer was thus not considered as a limitation for the evaluation of kinetic parameters. Human recombinant endostatin from P. pastoris bound to heparan sulfate with a moderate affinity. The affinity constant KD was found to be 2.2 μm using the 1:1 Langmuir model to fit the data (χ2 5.06). The association and dissociation rate constants were 9.04 × 103m-1 s-1 and 19.9 × 10-3 s-1, respectively. A similar affinity was obtained for the interaction between endostatin and heparin (KD 1.96 μm, 1:1 Langmuir model, χ2 7.23), but the kinetic parameters were different, 2.23 × 103m-1 s-1 for ka and 4.35 × 10-3 s-1 for kd. Heparan sulfate formed a kinetically weaker complex than heparin with endostatin, as shown by the faster dissociation rate. Binding data to heparin and heparan sulfate were also well fitted to the heterogeneous ligand model predefined in the BIAeval 3.1 software, which included the effects of possible heterogeneity of immobilized glycosaminoglycans. In this model, endostatin could bind to two sites via parallel reactions on immobilized heparin or heparan sulfate. The two sets of calculated affinity constants were: KD1, 0.96 μm, and KD2, 19.84 μm, for heparin (χ2 2.79); KD1, 1.37 μm, and KD2, 25.25 μm, for heparan sulfate (χ2 4.82). The highest affinity was in the same range as the values obtained when data were fitted to the 1:1 Langmuir model. Attempts were made to evaluate the affinity of the interaction between endostatin produced in 293-EBNA cells and heparin or heparan sulfate in the absence of zinc. In both cases, binding data exhibited a good fit to the heterogeneous ligand model, but the affinity was very poor (KD1, 452 μm, and KD2, 68 μm, (χ2 0.358) for heparan sulfate; KD1, 40 μm, and KD2, 65 μm (χ2 1.67) for heparin). Molecular Modeling of Endostatin-Heparin Interactions: Docking of Monosaccharides—Docking studies with heparin monosaccharides and oligosaccharides and endostatin provided additional structural information regarding the interaction. When docking the three sulfated monosaccharides on the endostatin monomer, a large number of clusters was obtained: 47 for monosaccharide 1, 29 for monosaccharide 2, and 31 for monosaccharide 3. The monosaccharides representing the lowest energy member of each cluster were superimposed on the accessible surface of the protein. Highly populated binding zones were noticed all along the most positively charged area of the surface for the three monosaccharides (Fig. 5, A-C). The docking results were further analyzed by counting the number of hydrogen bonds occurring between docked conformers and amino acids of endostatin (Fig. 6). The amino acids that seemed to be particularly involved in monosaccharide binding through hydrogen bonding were Arg27, Arg47, Arg53, Arg63, Arg66, and Arg139 (Table I). They were distributed in two different clusters apart from Arg47, located between the two clusters at the surface of endostatin (Fig. 5D).Fig. 6Total number of hydrogen bonds predicted to form between sulfated monosaccharides (1.O'Reilly M.S.

The growth arrest at G1 phase by HDAC inhibitors is thought to be highly dependent on the upregulation of p21/WAF1, but the precise mechanism by which HDAC inhibitors cause G2/M arrest or apoptosis in tumour cells is unknown. Gadd45 causes cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase transition and participates in genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis. We show here that it is also induced by a typical HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), through its promoter, in a p53-independent manner. To identify the mechanism of activation of the gadd45 promoter, we performed luciferase reporter analyses and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. These revealed that both the Oct-1 and CCAAT sites are needed for the full activation by TSA. We also found that the transcription factors Oct-1 and NF-Y specifically bind to each site. Thus, HDAC inhibitors can induce Gadd45 through its promoter without the need for functional p53, and both the Oct-1 and NF-Y concertedly participate in TSA-induced activation of the gadd45 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1966410297,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by progressive inflammation associated with abberrant proliferation of synoviocytes. In order to explore the characteristics of rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts (RSF), we performed the comparative gene expression profile analysis between RSF and normal synovial fibroblasts (NSF) upon tumor necrosis factor (TNF) stimulation. As an initial screening for the genes preferentially induced by TNF in RSF compared with NSF, we have adopted a cDNA array containing well-defined sets of genes responsible for cell growth, cell fate determination, and cellular invasiveness. Differentially expressed genes of interest were confirmed using real-time RT–PCR. We found that TNF induced the expression of Notch-1, Notch-4, and Jagged-2 in RSF. The expression of these proteins was detected in the RA synovial tissues. The nucleus of RA synoviocytes showed strong staining with anti-Notch-1 and Notch-4 antibody. TNF induced the nuclear translocation of Notch intracellular domain in RSF, indicating the elicitation of the Notch signaling. Notch-1, Notch-4, and Jagged-2 proteins were also detected in the developing synovium of mouse embryo. Thus, RSF may have re-acquired the primordial phenotype, accounting for the hyperproliferation and aggressive invasiveness, exhibiting tumor-like phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1980362319,"Although apolipoprotein (apo) E is synthesized in the brain primarily by astrocytes, neurons in the central nervous system express apoE, albeit at lower levels than astrocytes, in response to various physiological and pathological conditions, including excitotoxic stress. To investigate how apoE expression is regulated in neurons, we transfected Neuro-2a cells with a 17-kilobase human apoE genomic DNA construct encoding apoE3 or apoE4 along with upstream and downstream regulatory elements. The baseline expression of apoE was low. However, conditioned medium from an astrocytic cell line (C6) or from apoE-null mouse primary astrocytes increased the expression of both isoforms by 3-4-fold at the mRNA level and by 4-10-fold at the protein level. These findings suggest that astrocytes secrete a factor or factors that regulate apoE expression in neuronal cells. The increased expression of apoE was almost completely abolished by incubating neurons with U0126, an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), suggesting that the Erk pathway controls astroglial regulation of apoE expression in neuronal cells. Human neuronal precursor NT2/D1 cells expressed apoE constitutively; however, after treatment of these cells with retinoic acid to induce differentiation, apoE expression diminished. Cultured mouse primary cortical and hippocampal neurons also expressed low levels of apoE. Astrocyte-conditioned medium rapidly up-regulated apoE expression in fully differentiated NT2 neurons and in cultured mouse primary cortical and hippocampal neurons. Thus, neuronal expression of apoE is regulated by a diffusible factor or factors released from astrocytes, and this regulation depends on the activity of the Erk kinase pathway in neurons.

However, the mechanisms of these effects are still largely unknown, and it is not known which are the primary effects and which are subsequent or downstream effects. Initially, apoE was thought to be synthesized in the brain only by astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymal layer cells (31Boyles J.K. Pitas R.E. Wilson E. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. J. Clin.

In rats treated with kainic acid to induce excitotoxic stress, apoE expression is induced in surviving hippocampal neurons, as determined by in situ hybridization and anti-apoE immunohistochemistry (42Boschert U.

Thus, a better understanding of the regulation of neuronal production of apoE is important for unraveling the mechanisms underlying apoE4-related neurodegenerative disorders. In this study we used Neuro-2a cells transfected with human apoE genomic DNA, human NT2/D1 neuronal precursor cells, and mouse primary cortical or hippocampal neurons to investigate how apoE expression is regulated in neurons. Here we demonstrate that neuronal expression of apoE can be induced by astrocyte-conditioned medium and that the astroglial regulation of apoE expression in neurons is controlled by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathway. Materials—Minimum essential medium (MEM), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), N2-medium supplements, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Invitrogen. The ECL chemiluminescence detection kit for Western blots was from Amersham Biosciences. Recombinant human apoE3 and apoE4 were prepared as described (28Huang Y. Liu X.Q. Wyss-Coray T. Brecht W.J. Sanan D.A. Mahley R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8838-8843Google Scholar). Polyclonal goat anti-human apoE and inhibitors of the Erk (U0126), c-Jun-N-terminal-kinase (JNK) (c-Jun-N-terminal kinase inhibitor 1), and p38 (SB203580) pathways were from Calbiochem. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-goat IgG was from Dako (Carpinteria, CA). Cell Cultures—Neuro-2a cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator in MEM containing 10% FBS supplemented with nonessential amino acids, penicillin, and streptomycin. Human neuronal precursor NT2/D1 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Virginia M.-Y. Lee (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA) and maintained in Opti-MEM-I (Invitrogen) containing 5% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (59Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Google Scholar). The cells were treated with retinoic acid to induce differentiation into NT2 neurons (59Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M.-Y. J.

Martin J.-L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1639-1646Google Scholar, 62Fiumelli H. Kiraly M. Ambrus A. Magistretti P.J. Martin J.-L. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1870-1877Google Scholar). As determined by immunostaining with cell-specific antibodies, >95% of cells in 6-day-old cortical cultures in vitro are positive for neuron-specific enolase (63Stella N. Pellerin L. Magistretti P.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3307-3317Google Scholar). Primary astrocytes were prepared from embryonic day 17 wild-type or apoE-null mice (64Mucke L. Rockenstein E.M. Transgene. 1993; 1: 3-9Google Scholar). As determined by immunostaining with cell-specific antibodies, >95% of cells in 6-day-old astrocyte cultures in vitro are positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (63Stella N. Pellerin L. Magistretti P.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3307-3317Google Scholar). Preparation of Astrocyte-conditioned Medium—Rat astrocytic C6 cells were grown to 80% confluence in DMEM containing 20% FBS in T175 flasks, washed 3 times with serum-free DMEM, and incubated with 10 ml of serum-free DMEM for 24 h. The medium was collected, centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and stored at -80 °C. The apoE-null mouse primary astrocytes were grown in DMEM containing 20% FBS in 20-cm dishes, washed 3 times with serum-free DMEM, and incubated with 10 ml of serum-free DMEM for 24 h. The conditioned medium was collected, centrifuged, and stored at -80 °C. Generation of Neuro-2a Cells Stably Expressing Human ApoE3 or ApoE4—Neuro-2a cells were cotransfected with a 17-kilobase human apoE genomic DNA construct encoding apoE3 or apoE4 and a plasmid containing the neomycin resistance gene by using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) (65Huang Y. Liu X.Q. Rall Jr., S.C. Taylor J.M. von Eckardstein A. Assmann G. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26388-26393Google Scholar). The construct consisted of 5 kilobases of 5′-flanking region, four exons, three introns, and 8 kilobases of 3′-flanking region of the apoE gene. Stably transfected cells were selected by growing them in MEM containing 10% FBS and 400 μg/ml G418 for more than 2 weeks and cloned by a cell sorter (65Huang Y. Liu X.Q. Rall Jr., S.C. Taylor J.M. von Eckardstein A. Assmann G. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26388-26393Google Scholar). Cell lines stably expressing apoE3 or apoE4 at similar levels, as determined by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and anti-apoE Western blotting, were used in this study. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Western Blotting—Neuro-2a cells transfected with apoE, NT2/D1 neuronal precursor cells, fully differentiated NT2 neurons, and mouse primary cortical and hippocampal neurons were grown to 80% confluence in six-well plates and then incubated with medium conditioned by C6 or primary astrocytes (1:1 dilution in serum-free MEM or Opti-MEM) in the presence or absence of an inhibitor of the Erk (U0126, 5 μm), JNK inhibitor 1 (5 μm), or p38 (SB203580, 2.5 μm) pathway at noncytotoxic doses for 24 h. The cells were harvested, lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet p-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) for 30 min, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. Proteins in the supernatant were subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected by anti-apoE Western blotting (28Huang Y. Liu X.Q. Wyss-Coray T. Brecht W.J. Sanan D.A. Mahley R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8838-8843Google Scholar). The full-length apoE bands were scanned, normalized to cellular proteins, and reported as arbitrary units. In some experiments 95% primary cortical neurons from apoE-null mice were mix-cultured with 5% primary astrocytes from wild-type mice in serum-free medium for 24 h. ApoE in the cell lysate and medium was then determined as described above. Quantification of ApoE mRNA by Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA from apoE3- or apoE4-transfected Neuro-2a cells treated with medium conditioned by C6 or primary astrocytes was isolated with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR was performed with 10 ng of total RNA and the RT-PCR kit from Invitrogen. The RT-PCR product of apoE was 75 bp. The RT-PCR product of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which was used as an internal standard, was 112 bp. Different amounts of input RNA, cycling temperatures, and cycle numbers were evaluated to assure a linear response of the apoE and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signals. The RT-PCR products were measured in real time with an ABI-PRISM-7700 sequence detector from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The apoE mRNA levels were then calculated and normalized to the internal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA standards. Immunocytochemistry—Mouse primary cortical neurons were grown for 6 days on glass cover slips (Fisher) coated with polylysine in 24-well plates, washed 3 times with serum-free medium, and incubated for 24 h with serum-free medium conditioned by C6 astrocytes (1:1 dilution in serum-free Opti-MEM). After incubation the neurons were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with polyclonal anti-apoE and a fluorescein-coupled secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) (28Huang Y. Liu X.Q. Wyss-Coray T. Brecht W.J. Sanan D.A. Mahley R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8838-8843Google Scholar). The immunofluorescent-labeled slides were mounted in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories) and viewed with an MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal system (Bio-Rad) mounted on an Optiphot-2 microscope (Nikon). Statistical Analysis—Results are reported as the mean ± S.D. Differences were evaluated by t test or analysis of variance. Astroglial Regulation of ApoE Expression in Neuro-2a Cells—To investigate how apoE expression is regulated in neurons, we transfected Neuro-2a cells with a large fragment of human apoE genomic DNA (Fig. 1A) (66Grehan S. Tse E. Taylor J.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 812-822Google Scholar) and selected stable cell lines expressing matched levels of apoE3 and apoE4 (Fig. 1B). All of the transfectants expressed low levels of apoE (<100 ng of apoE/mg of cell protein/24 h), suggesting that the apoE gene promoter is not very active in Neuro-2a cells. However, medium conditioned by an astrocytic C6 cell line or apoE-null mouse primary astrocytes increased apoE secretion 4-10-fold and apoE mRNA expression 3-4-fold, with no difference between the isoforms (Fig. 2, A-C). These results suggest that astrocytes secrete a factor or factors that regulate apoE expression in Neuro-2a cells. In preliminary studies, the putative astrocyte-derived factor was sensitive to heat or protease treatment, suggesting a protein (data not shown).Fig. 2Astroglial regulation of apoE expression in apoE-transfected Neuro-2a cells incubated in the presence or absence of astrocyte-conditioned medium. ApoE-transfected Neuro-2a cells were incubated in the presence or absence of medium conditioned by C6 astrocytes (C6-CM) (A and C) or by apoE-null mouse primary astrocytes (1°-CM) (B and C) in serum-free MEM at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the medium (80 μl) was subjected to anti-apoE Western blotting, and the apoE bands were scanned and normalized to cellular protein levels (n = 6 per treatment). C, total mRNA was isolated from the cells, and apoE mRNA levels were determined by real-time RT-PCR (n = 4 per treatment).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Astroglial Regulation of ApoE Expression in Neuro-2a Cells Is Dependent on the Erk Pathway—Next, we sought to identify the pathway involved in the astroglial regulation of apoE expression in Neuro-2a cells. At noncytotoxic levels, the Erk pathway inhibitor U0126 almost completely abolished the increased expression of apoE3 (Fig. 3, A and B) or apoE4 (data not shown) induced by astrocyte-conditioned medium. Inhibitors of other mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, JNK inhibitor-1 and SB203580 (for the p38 pathway), had no significant effects on apoE expression (Fig. 3A), although they did inhibit the JNK and p38 pathways, respectively, in control assays (data not shown). U0126 also inhibited the baseline expression of apoE3 (Fig. 3C) and apoE4 (data not shown). Thus, astroglial regulation of apoE expression in Neuro-2a cells is dependent on the Erk pathway. ApoE Expression in Human NT2 Neurons Is Regulated by Astroglia—To avoid a potential artificial effect of transgene integration on apoE expression in transfected Neuro-2a cells, we also studied human neuronal precursor NT2/D1 cells. These cells expressed apoE constitutively (Fig. 4, three far left lanes), as shown previously (47Ferreira S. Dupire M.-J. Delacourte A. Najib J. Caillet-Boudin M.-L. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 166: 415-421Google Scholar). When the cells were treated with retinoic acid to induce differentiation, apoE expression increased and then diminished (Fig. 4, six middle lanes), suggesting that it is regulated by signaling pathways related to cell proliferation or differentiation. Incubation of fully differentiated human NT2 neurons with medium conditioned by C6 astrocytes rapidly up-regulated apoE expression (Fig. 4, three far right lanes), suggesting that an astroglia-derived factor or factors can also induce apoE expression in fully differentiated human NT2 neurons. Similar results were also obtained from fully differentiated human NT2 neurons treated with medium conditioned by apoE-null mouse primary astrocytes (data not shown). Astroglial Regulation of ApoE Expression in Mouse Primary Neurons Is Also Dependent on the Erk Pathway—To study neuronal apoE expression in a more physiological scenario, we next assessed apoE expression in mouse primary neurons. In both cortical neurons (Fig. 5A) and hippocampal neurons (Fig. 5B), apoE was expressed at low levels; the levels increased in response to incubation with astrocyte-conditioned medium, and the increase was almost completely abolished by U0126 (Fig. 5, A and B), consistent with involvement of the Erk pathway. Similar results were obtained from mouse primary neurons treated with medium conditioned by apoE-null mouse primary astrocytes (data not shown). As shown by anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein Western blotting, the neuronal cultures contained undetectable levels of astrocytes (Fig. 5C). The absence of detectable apoE in the cell lysate and medium of a mixed culture containing 95% primary cortical neurons from apoE-null mice and 5% primary astrocytes from wild-type mice (our primary neuronal cultures contained >95% neurons) further proved that the apoE detected in the primary neuronal cultures came from neurons but not the potentially contaminated astrocytes (data not shown). These results indicate that mouse primary cortical and hippocampal neurons also express low levels of apoE, which can be further stimulated by an astroglia-derived factor or factors through the Erk pathway. Interestingly, only ∼10% of apoE generated in mouse primary cortical neurons was secreted into the culture medium during a 24-h incubation (Fig. 6A), whereas more than 60% of apoE generated in mouse primary astrocytes was secreted (Fig. 6B). Similar results were obtained during a 12-h incubation (data not shown). These results sugg"
https://openalex.org/W2042774805,"The nonstructural 3 (NS3) protein encoded by the hepatitis C virus possesses both an N-terminal serine protease activity and a C-terminal 3′–5′ helicase activity. This study examines the effects of the protease on the helicase by comparing the enzymatic properties of the full-length NS3 protein with truncated versions in which the protease is either deleted or replaced by a polyhistidine (His tag) or a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (GST tag). When the NS3 protein lacks the protease domain it unwinds RNA more slowly and does not unwind RNA in the presence of excess nucleic acid that acts as an enzyme trap. Some but not all of the RNA helicase activity can be restored by adding a His tag or GST tag to the N terminus of the truncated helicase, suggesting that the effects of the protease are both specific and nonspecific. Similar but smaller effects are also seen in DNA helicase and translocation assays. While translocating on RNA (or DNA) the full-length protein hydrolyzes ATP more slowly than the truncated protein, suggesting that the protease allows for more efficient ATP usage. Binding assays reveal that the full-length protein assembles on single-stranded DNA as a higher order oligomer than the truncated fragment, and the binding appears to be more cooperative. The data suggest that hepatitis C virus RNA helicase, and therefore viral replication, could be influenced by the rotations of the protease domain which likely occur during polyprotein processing.

The epidemic caused by infection by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) 1The abbreviations used are: HCV, hepatitis C virus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; NS3, nonstructural protein 3; ss, single-stranded; F18, 5′-GCC TCG CTG CCG TCG CCA-fluorescein. is still a global crisis despite recent therapeutic advancements (1.Tan S.L. Pause A. Shi Y. Sonenberg N. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2002; 1: 867-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Because HCV cannot be conventionally cultivated in cell culture and the only other host is the chimpanzee, the enzymes encoded by HCV have been studied intensely as targets for rational drug design. One key viral enzyme is the multifunctional nonstructural protein 3 (NS3), which possesses a serine protease activity and an ATPase function that fuels the ability of the protein to unwind RNA and DNA duplexes. Although it is clear that both the protease and helicase functions are necessary for viral replication (2.Kolykhalov A.A. Mihalik K. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether the two functions, which reside in independent protein domains, cooperate in any manner (3.Frick D.N. Curr. Org. Chem. 2003; 7 (in press)Google Scholar). To examine possible effects of the NS3 protease on its helicase function, the activities of the full-length NS3 protein were rigorously compared with the same protein lacking the protease and also with recombinant proteins in which the protease is replaced with other non-HCV peptides. The experiments were designed to uncover effects of the NS3 protease domain on its helicase function which are either specific or nonspecific. Nonspecific effects are defined as those that can be duplicated by peptides not derived from HCV NS3, whereas specific effects cannot. All recombinant proteins used in this study (Fig. 1) were derived from the same infectious clone of HCV genotype 1a (4.Yanagi M. Purcell R.H. Emerson S.U. Bukh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8738-8743Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). NS3 spans amino acids 1027–1659 of the ∼3,000-amino acid long polyprotein encoded by HCV. At the N terminus resides the protease, which is made of two subdomains. The active site with its chymotrypsin-like catalytic triad is formed in a shallow cleft between the two protease subdomains. The NS3 protease is activated by the NS4A protein, which is translated immediately after NS3. The NS3-4A complex cleaves itself at the NS3-4A junction, and NS4A remains associative with NS3 (Fig. 1) as the complex cleaves the rest of the viral polyprotein. To do so, the protease would likely need to move away from the back of the helicase so that its active site is accessible to other peptides (5.Yao N. Reichert P. Taremi S.S. Prosise W.W. Weber P.C. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: 1353-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The helicase portion of NS3 is a three-domain Y-shaped molecule with two clefts separating the domains (6.Yao N. Hesson T. Cable M. Hong Z. Kwong A.D. Le H.V. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 7.Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15045-15052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The cleft between domains 1 and 2 is lined by several conserved motifs that are involved in ATP hydrolysis and are shared with other helicases. One strand of the nucleic acid substrate binds in the cleft that separates domain 3 from domains 1 and 2 (7.Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows the relative location of the protease when the C terminus of NS3 is bound in the protease active site (5.Yao N. Reichert P. Taremi S.S. Prosise W.W. Weber P.C. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: 1353-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In this conformation, the protease active site and NS4A are far from the known RNA and ATP binding sites. To analyze the helicase activities of the full-length protein, NS3 and NS4A were coexpressed as a single polypeptide that processes itself (9.Sali D.L. Ingram R. Wendel M. Gupta D. McNemar C. Tsarbopoulos A. Chen J.W. Hong Z. Chase R. Risano C. Zhang R. Yao N. Kwong A.D. Ramanathan L. Le H.V. Weber P.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3392-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The truncated helicase proteins lacking protease function (Fig. 1A) were based on those previously analyzed and include versions with N-terminal (10.Preugschat F. Danger D.P. Carter 3rd, L.H.

Koh E. Lim S.P. Tan Y.H. Brenner S. Lim S.G. Hong W.J. Goh P.Y. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The presence of an intact protease domain dramatically enhances the ability of the protein to unwind RNA. However, the addition of an N-terminal His tag to the helicase fragment also enhanced RNA helicase activity, and the N-terminal GST-tagged protein unwound RNA almost as well as the full-length protein. Similar but smaller effects were seen in DNA unwinding assays and ssDNA translocation assays. A more specific effect of the protease was seen when RNA unwinding was analyzed in the presence of a DNA trap, which sequesters excess helicase not bound to the RNA substrate. More efficient unwinding correlates with a different mode of interaction seen in direct DNA binding assays, in which twice as many protein monomers bind the same amount of ssDNA. Finally, ATPase assays show that the full-length helicase hydrolyzes ATP more slowly than the truncated proteins (in the presence of DNA or RNA), suggesting that the protease domain allows the helicase to fuel RNA unwinding more efficiently with ATP hydrolysis. RNase-free reagents were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX), and nucleotides and nucleic acids were treated with the RNAsecure reagent (Ambion). Poly(U) RNA with an average length of 2,500 nucleotides was purchased from Sigma. DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA), and their concentrations were determined from provided extinction coefficients. The recombinant proteins utilized in this study were all derived from the same HCV isolate (4.Yanagi M. Purcell R.H. Emerson S.U. Bukh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8738-8743Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and possess the viral regions indicated in Fig. 1. The proteins are designated according to the type and location of their fusion partners. After purification, the following extinction coefficients, derived using the method described by Pace et al. (18.Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar), were used to determine protein concentrations: His-NS3-4A, 77.3 mm-1 cm-1; His-Hel, 49.1 mm-1 cm-1; His-Hel-His, 49.1 mm-1 cm-1; Hel-His, 49.1 mm-1 cm-1; GST-Hel-His, 87.4 mm-1 cm-1. Cloning, expression, and purification of each are described below. His-NS3-4A—PCR was used to amplify NS3-4A from the plasmid pCV-H77c, which was a generous gift from Dr. Jens Bukh (National Institutes of Health). The PCR primers added restriction sites to either end of the DNA and encoded the 5′-His tag depicted in Fig. 1. The sequence of the upstream primer was 5′-CAAGATCT ATG CAC CAT CAC CAT CAC CAT GGC CAC GGC GCG CCC ATC ACG GCG TAC GCC-3′ (BglII site underlined), and the sequence of the downstream primer was 5′-CAGAATTC TCA GCA CTC TTC CAT CTC ATC GAA C-3′ (EcoRI site underlined). The amplified DNA was digested with BglII and EcoRI and ligated into a similarly treated plasmid pVL1392 (Invitrogen). After verification of the appropriate DNA sequence, the resulting plasmid was recombined with the BacPAK system (Clontech) to generate a recombinant baculovirus. Baculovirus was plaque purified, amplified, and used for infection of Sf9 cells for protein purification. The protein was isolated from Sf9 cells using the protocol described by Sali et al. (9.Sali D.L. Ingram R. Wendel M. Gupta D. McNemar C. Tsarbopoulos A. Chen J.W. Hong Z. Chase R. Risano C. Zhang R. Yao N. Kwong A.D. Ramanathan L. Le H.V. Weber P.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3392-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were monitored during the purification procedure by Western blotting using antibodies raised against NS3 and NS4A. Hel-His—The C-terminally His-tagged helicase fragment was based on the protein that was crystallized and characterized by Kim and co-workers (7.Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 13.Lin C. Kim J.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8798-8807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning, expression, and purification of Hel-His (which was previously designated Hel-1a) have been described (15.Lam A.M.I. Keeney D. Eckert P.Q. Frick D.N. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3950-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A detailed enzymatic characterization of Hel-1a was reported recently (16.Lam A.M.I. Keeney D. Frick D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44514-44524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). His-Hel-His—To generate a HCV helicase fragment with both C-terminal and N-terminal His tags, DNA encoding the helicase was excised from plasmid p24Hel-1a (15.Lam A.M.I. Keeney D. Eckert P.Q. Frick D.N. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3950-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which encodes Hel-His, and inserted into the vector pET33a (Novagen, Madison, WI). Plasmid p24Hel-1a was digested with NheI and BamHI. The resulting smaller DNA fragment was purified and inserted using T4 DNA ligase into a similarly treated pET33a to generate the vector p33Hel-1a. For expression, p33Hel-1a was used to transform strain BL21(DE3), which contains T7 polymerase under the control of a lac promoter. The recombinant protein is under control of a T7(lac) promoter, which contains a lac operator between the T7 promoter and the transcription start site (19.Dubendorff J.W. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). After cells had grown to mid log phase in Luria-Bertani broth, helicase expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested and lysed by two passes through a French pressure cell, and the clarified soluble extract was fractionated as described previously for Hel-His (15.Lam A.M.I. Keeney D. Eckert P.Q. Frick D.N. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3950-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). His-Hel—To generate a HCV helicase protein with a single His tag on its N terminus, plasmid p33Hel-1a was modified using site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a stop codon at the end of the HCV NS3 “gene.” The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to modify p33Hel-1a using complementary mutagenic oligonucleotides: 5′-CGA CCT GGA GGT CGT CAC GTG AAC CCG GGA TCC G-3′ and 5′-CGG ATC CCG GGT TCA CGT GAC GAC CTC CAG GTC G-3′ (stop codon underlined). After the location of a stop codon was verified by DNA sequencing, the resulting plasmid (designated p33Helstop) was introduced into BL21(DE3) cells. Recombinant His-Hel was expressed and purified as described above for His-Hel-His. GST-Hel-His—The GST-tagged HCV helicase was generated by excising the helicase encoding region from p24Hel-1a and inserting it into vector pET41a (Novagen). Plasmid p24Hel-1a was digested with the restriction enzymes NheI and BamHI. After the smaller of the two resulting DNA fragments was purified, it was ligated into pET41a that was digested with SpeI and BamHI (SpeI and NheI generate compatible cohesive ends). GST-Hel-His was then expressed in BL21(DE3) as described above. The GST-Hel-His protein was purified using the columns described for Hel-His (15.Lam A.M.I. Keeney D. Eckert P.Q. Frick D.N. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3950-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, pooled fractions were loaded onto a 3-ml GST-bind™ column (Novagen). The column was washed with 50 ml of buffer A (50 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), and the protein was eluted with a gradient of the same buffer containing 0–20 mm reduced glutathione. Fractions containing HCV helicase were combined, precipitated with 60% ammonium sulfate, and purified further using gel filtration and DEAE chromatography as described previously for Hel-His (15.Lam A.M.I. Keeney D. Eckert P.Q. Frick D.N. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3950-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To generate substrates for helicase assays, two synthetic oligonucleotides were annealed by heating them to 95 °C and allowing them to cool slowly to room temperature. Before annealing, the shorter strand was 32P labeled using polynucleotide kinase. The duplex RNA substrate consisted of the RNA oligonucleotide 5′-UGGCGACGGCAGCGAGGCUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-3′ annealed to the oligonucleotide 5′-[32P]GCCUCGCUGCCGUCGCCA-3′. The DNA substrate consisted of a shorter strand DNA oligonucleotide 5′-[32P]GCCTCGCTGCCGTCGCCA-3′ annealed to a longer strand DNA oligonucleotide 5′-TGGCGACGGCAGCGAGGC TTTTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTTT-3.′ The resulting duplexes have a 3′-ssDNA (or ssRNA) tail. The DNA or RNA substrate (1 nm) and HCV helicase were incubated in reaction buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min. 10-μl reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 mm ATP and terminated with 2.5 μl of 5× stopping buffer after 20 s, 40 s, 1 min, 2 min, 3 min, 5 min, 7.5 min, and 10 min. 5× stopping buffer contained 250 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol FF, 50% glycerol. 250 nm trap DNA was also added before electrophoresis to prevent reannealing. Products were analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE as described previously (15.Lam A.M.I. Keeney D. Eckert P.Q. Frick D.N. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3950-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In some assays, excess trap DNA, which consisted of the unlabeled shorter oligonucleotide, was added when the reactions were initiated. Assays were performed at 37 or 23 °C as indicated. Translocation on ssDNA was assessed using an assay, developed by Raney and colleagues (20.Morris P.D. Raney K.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21.Morris P.D. Byrd A.K. Tackett A.J. Cameron C.E. Tanega P. Ott R. Fanning E. Raney K.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2372-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which measures the helicase catalyzed displacement of streptavidin from a biotinylated 32P-oligonucleotide. The streptavidin-bound biotinylated DNA substrate 5′-[32P]T(bio)GGCGACGGCAGCGAGGCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′ (5 nm) and various concentrations of HCV helicase were incubated in reaction buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 37 °C) for 30 min. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 mm ATP and 6 μm biotin (to trap released streptavidin) and terminated at various times with the stopping buffer used in the unwinding assays. After electrophoresis on a 15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, reactions were analyzed with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Intrinsic protein fluorescence was measured by exciting the sample at 280 nm and reading the emission at 340 nm with a Varian Carey Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. Aliquots of DNA were added to the helicase in 2 ml of 25 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% Tween 20 at 25 °C. DNA oligonucleotide was either the same sequence as the short strand used in unwinding assay (18-mer) 5′-GCC TCG CTG CCG TCG CCA-3′ or the same oligonucleotide with a fluorescein moiety attached to its 3′-end (F18). Experiments were performed in the presence and absence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog ADP(BeF3), which was formed by including 0.1 mm ADP, 5 mm NaF, and 0.5 mm BeF2 in the reaction buffer (22.Levin M.K. Gurjar M.M. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23311-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After correcting data for dilution and inner filter effects, fractional fluorescence (FF) was calculated by dividing the fluorescence values by the initial fluorescence of the protein in the absence of DNA. FF was fit to the total concentration of added ssDNA oligonucleotide ([DNA]T) calculated in terms of 3′-ends of DNA using Equation 1. FF=1-ΔFFMAX(KD+n[DNA]T+[E]T)-(KD+n[DNA]T+[E]T)2-4n[DNA]T[E]T2[E]T(Eq. 1) In Equation 1, ΔFFMAX is the maximum change in fractional fluorescence resulting when all enzyme molecules are bound to nucleic acid. KD is the apparent dissociation constant, ET is total enzyme concentration, and n is the number of enzyme monomers bound to a single oligonucleotide at saturation. Data were fit to Equation 1 by nonlinear regression using Graphpad Prism version 4.0 (San Diego). Fluorescence of the fluorescein-labeled DNA oligonucleotide F18 increased about 2-fold upon binding to HCV helicase when monitored at an excitation wavelength of 492 and an emission of 518. This fluorescence change was used to measure helicase DNA interactions as follows. Various amounts of F18 ranging from 0.5 to 2 nm were titrated with recombinant helicases. Titrations were performed in 25 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% Tween 20 at 25 °C. After correcting for dilution and negligible inner filter effects, the corrected fluorescence (Fc) at each enzyme concentration was fit to total enzyme concentration ([E]T) using Equation 2. Fc=Fi+ΔFMAX(KD+[E]T/n+[DNA]T)-(KD+[E]T/n+[DNA]T)2-4[E]T[DNA]T/n[DNA]T(Eq. 2) In Equation 2, Fi is the initial fluorescence of F18 in the absence of protein, and ΔFMAX is the maximum fluorescence change of each titration. This equation assumes that the observed fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of bound DNA divided by the total concentration of DNA [DNA]T. Bound DNA is calculated from [DNA]T and total enzyme ([E]T) at each point in the titration from estimates of the apparent dissociation constant. The factor n again represents the number of protein monomers bound to a single oligonucleotide. KD and n were calculated by globally fitting five data sets obtained at different [DNA]T values to Equation 2 using Graphpad Prism. Initial rates of ATP hydrolysis were measured as described previously (15.Lam A.M.I. Keeney D. Eckert P.Q. Frick D.N. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3950-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 37 °C in 25 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, 5 mm MgCl2 0.1% Tween 20, ATP, and 10–100 nm helicase. Data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression to calculate the Km and Vmax in the presence and absence of nucleic acids. To determine the constant KDNA, defined as the concentration of DNA that supports a half-maximum rate of catalysis, reactions were performed in the presence of 4 mm ATP with various concentrations of DNA, and the data were fit to Equation 3. ν=Vmax[DNA]KDNA+[DNA](Eq. 3) Although the HCV helicase has been analyzed both as an isolated fragment and as part of the full-length NS3 protein, the few studies that directly compared the HCV helicase with and without its attached protease have not noted clear differences (11.Heilek G.M. Peterson M.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6264-6266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Gallinari P. Brennan D. Nardi C. Brunetti M. Tomei L. Steinkuhler C. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6758-6769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Piccininni S. Varaklioti A. Nardelli M. Dave B. Raney K.D. McCarthy J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45670-45679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). There are nevertheless several noteworthy differences between studies that utilize full-length NS3 and those that use recombinant HCV helicase lacking the protease domain. For example, as discussed below, Pang et al. (25.Pang P.S. Jankowsky E. Planet P.J. Pyle A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1168-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) showed that the full-length protein is a processive RNA helicase, whereas a recent study by Lam et al. (16.Lam A.M.I. Keeney D. Frick D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44514-44524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) concluded that the isolated domain unwinds only DNA processively. Unfortunately, no firm conclusions can be reached by comparing such studies because different research groups use different HCV isolates as their source for recombinant NS3 proteins; any apparent differences among the studies could simply result from genetic variation. Helicases isolated from different HCV genotypes display different properties (15.Lam A.M.I. Keeney D. Eckert P.Q. Frick D.N. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3950-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and point mutations in the NS3 helicase influence RNA replication as observed using both HCV replicons (26.Lohmann V. Korner F. Dobierzewska A. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1437-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 27.Blight K.J. McKeating J.A. Rice C.M. J.

Shapiro M. St. Claire M. Bartenschlager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In this study, the properties of the full-length NS3-4A helicase are compared with truncated helicases, derived from the same viral isolate, which either lack the protease domain or have it replaced with fusion peptides. Expression and Purification of the Recombinant Proteins— The proteins used in this study are shown in Fig. 1A. The source of each protein was the cDNA from the infectious clone H77c, an isolate of HCV genotype 1a (4.Yanagi M. Purcell R.H. Emerson S.U. Bukh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8738-8743Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Although the full-length construct (His-NS3-4A) encoded all of NS3 and NS4A, the truncated proteins lack the first 166 amino acids of the N-terminal protease domain of the mature NS3 protein and the protease cofactor NS4A. All helicases with the exception of the full-length NS3 were expressed in the same cell line (BL21(DE3)) and purified using the same basic protocol. Repeated attempts to express the full-length protein in numerous Escherichia coli strains failed, resulting in the formation of primarily insoluble inclusion bodies. Therefore, His-NS3-4A was purified from insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus containing an open reading frame encoding His-NS3-4A. The protein was expressed and purified using the procedure described for the same protein isolated from the similar HCV genotype 1a H strain (9.Sali D.L. Ingram R. Wendel M. Gupta D. McNemar C. Tsarbopoulos A. Chen J.W. Hong Z. Chase R. Risano C. Zhang R. Yao N. Kwong A.D. Ramanathan L. Le H.V. Weber P.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3392-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The purity of the recombinant HCV helicase proteins is shown in Fig. 2. Although the smaller NS4A protein is only faintly visible when His-NS3-4A is stained with Coomassie Blue, it is detectable with antibodies raised against NS4A peptide (Fig. 2B). A protein without fusion tags was not analyzed because when His-Hel was digested with thrombin, which removes the N-terminal His tag, the helicase became very insoluble, and only a small amount could be isolated. When analyzed, the protein had also lost much of its specific activity. Therefore, effects of the His tags were instead determined by comparing the properties of the various proteins. For example, the effect of the C-terminal His tag can be seen by simply comparing His-Hel with His-Hel-His, and likewise, the effects of the N-terminal His tag can be uncovered by comparing His-Hel-His with Hel-His. Others have shown that an N-terminal His tag on full-length NS3 has no detectable effects on the activity of that protein (25.Pang P.S. Jankowsky E. Planet P.J. Pyle A.M.

https://openalex.org/W2037682543,"Mammalian heparanase (endo-beta-glucuronidase) degrades heparan sulfate proteoglycans and is an important modulator of the extracellular matrix and associated factors. The enzyme is preferentially expressed in neoplastic tissues and contributes to tumour metastasis and angiogenesis. To investigate the epigenetic regulation of the heparanase locus, methylation-specific and bisulfite PCR were performed on a panel of 22 human cancer cell lines. Cytosine methylation of the heparanase promoter was associated with inactivation of the affected allele. Despite lack of sequence homology, extensively methylated CpG islands were found both in human choriocarcinoma (JAR) and rat glioma (C-6) cells which lack heparanase activity. Treatment of these cells with demethylating agents (5-azacytidine, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) resulted in stable dose- and time-dependant promoter hypomethylation accompanied by reappearance of heparanase mRNA, protein and enzymatic activity. An inhibitor of histone deacetylase, Trichostatin A, failed to induce either of these effects. Upregulation of heparanase expression and activity by demethylating drugs was associated with a marked increase in lung colonization by pretreated C-6 rat glioma cells. The increased metastatic potential in vivo was inhibited in mice treated with laminaran sulfate, a potent inhibitor of heparanase activity. We propose a model wherein expression of mammalian heparanase gene is modulated by the interplay between trans-activating genetic and cis-inhibitory epigenetic elements in its promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2080058891,"Alix/AIP1 is a cytoplasmic protein, which was first characterized as an interactor of ALG-2, a calcium-binding protein necessary for cell death. Alix has also recently been defined as a regulator of the endo-lysosomal system. Here we have used post-mitotic cerebellar neurons to test Alix function in caspase-dependent and -independent cell death. Indeed, these neurons survived when cultured in 25 mm potassium-containing medium but underwent apoptosis soon after the extracellular potassium was lowered to 5 mm. In agreement with other studies, we show that caspases are activated after K+ deprivation, but that inhibition of these proteases, using the pancaspase inhibitor boc-aspartyl(OMe)-fluoromethylketone, has no effect on cell survival. Transfection experiments demonstrated that Alix overexpression is sufficient to induce caspase activation, whereas overexpression of its C-terminal half, Alix-CT, blocks caspase activation and cell death after K+ deprivation. We also define a 12-amino acid PXY repeat of the C-terminal proline-rich domain necessary for binding ALG-2. Deletion of this domain in Alix or in Alix-CT abolished the effects of the overexpressed proteins on neuronal survival, demonstrating that the ALG-2-binding region is crucial for the death-modulating function of Alix. Overall, these findings define the Alix/ALG-2 complex as a regulator of cell death controlling both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways.

A bridge between the endo-lysosomal system and cell death has been suggested by numerous observations dealing with apoptosis or with the so-called type II autophagic cell death, which is independent of caspases (1.Hornung J.P.

The endo-lysosomal system is composed of a series of intracellular compartments within which endocytosed molecules and redundant cellular material are hydrolyzed (6.Pillay C.S. Elliott E. Dennison C. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 417-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Endocytosed material tends to flow vectorially through the system from early endosomes, along late endosomes into lysosomes, whereas phagocytosis and autophagy provide alternative entry points.Multivesicular bodies represent a subset of late endosomes characterized by their multiple intralumenal vesicles, which bud from the limiting membranes together with ubiquitinated transmembrane proteins destined for degradation inside lysosomes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ubiquitinated membrane proteins en route to the vacuole are recognized and sorted in the multivesicular bodies by three hetero-oligomeric complexes (ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II, and ESCRT-III) composed of Vps 1The abbreviations used are: Vps; vacuolar protein-sorting; Alix, ALG-2-interacting protein X; ALG-2, apoptosis-linked gene 2; DIV, day in vitro; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Alix-CT, C-terminal part of Alix; SH3, Src homology domain; SETA, SH3 domain-containing expressed in tumorigenic astrocytes; CGN, cerebellar granule neurons; HEK, human embryonic kidney; BAF, boc-aspartyl(OMe)-fluoromethylketyone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; fam, carboxyfluorescein-labeled; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.1The abbreviations used are: Vps; vacuolar protein-sorting; Alix, ALG-2-interacting protein X; ALG-2, apoptosis-linked gene 2; DIV, day in vitro; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Alix-CT, C-terminal part of Alix; SH3, Src homology domain; SETA, SH3 domain-containing expressed in tumorigenic astrocytes; CGN, cerebellar granule neurons; HEK, human embryonic kidney; BAF, boc-aspartyl(OMe)-fluoromethylketyone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; fam, carboxyfluorescein-labeled; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. proteins (7.Jiang L.

Alix has previously been shown to be highly enriched in phagosomes (14.Garin J. Diez R. Kieffer S. Dermine J.F. Duclos S. Gagnon E. Sadoul R. Rondeau C. Desjardins M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) and exosomes, the latter being extracellular vesicles secreted upon fusion of the limiting membrane of the multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane (15.Thery C.

We have shown that the 150-amino acid long proline-rich domain of the C-terminal part of Alix (Alix-CT) interacts with the SH3 domain of endophilins (16.Chatellard-Causse C. Blot B. Cristina N. Torch S. Missotten M. Sadoul R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29108-29115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), which are lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases capable of modifying the lipid bilayer curvature during endocytosis (17.Schmidt A.

Moreover, the Alix proline-rich domain interacts with CIN85/SETA/Ruk (18.Chen B. Borinstein S.C. Gillis J. Sykes V.W. Bogler O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19275-19281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which regulates endocytosis of ubiquitinated tyrosine kinase receptors (19.Petrelli A. Gilestro G.F.

Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). These different observations suggest that Alix regulates the endo-lysosomal pathway from the cell surface down to late endosomes.Several other observations suggest a role for Alix in controlling cell death. The protein was first characterized as an interactor of the penta-EF hand calcium-binding protein ALG-2 (apoptosis-linked gene 2) (21.Missotten M. Nichols A. Rieger K. Sadoul R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 22.Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). ALG-2 seems necessary for death to occur as inhibition of its expression in a T cell line blocked apoptosis (23.Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) without impeding caspase-3 activation (24.Lacana E. Ganjei J.K. Vito P. D'Adamio L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5129-5135PubMed Google Scholar). However, death was not impaired in T cells from ALG-2-deficient mice, suggesting that other proteins of similar function may replace ALG-2 (25.Jang I.K. Hu R. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Gu H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 4094-4100Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, another binding partner of Alix, Cin85, not only regulates endocytosis but also influences cell death of astrocytes and neurons (18.Chen B. Borinstein S.C. Gillis J. Sykes V.W. Bogler O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19275-19281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 26.Gout I. Middleton G. Adu J. Ninkina N.N. Drobot L.B. Filonenko V. Matsuka G. Davies A.M. Waterfield M. Buchman V.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4015-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A final argument for a possible role of Alix in cell death comes from our recent demonstration of its up-regulation in neurons degenerating after kainate-induced epileptic seizures (53.Hemming, F. J., Fraboulet, S., Blot, B., and Sadoul, R. (2004) Neuroscience, in pressGoogle Scholar).Here we have used potassium depletion-induced death of cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) as a paradigm of neuronal death to test a role of Alix in this phenomenon. We demonstrate that both caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms underlie death of these neurons because inhibition of caspases does not impair death induced by potassium deprivation. We show that Alix overexpression is sufficient to induce caspase activation and nuclear alteration leading to death of neurons cultured in high potassium. In turn, Alix-CT inhibits caspase activation after potassium deprivation; it also inhibits the caspase-independent program because transfected neurons survive in low K+. Finally, we identify the region of Alix necessary for binding ALG-2 and demonstrate that this site, but not the one binding endophilins, is required for Alix to control cell death. The complex Alix/ALG-2 may thus represent a critical link between the endo-lysosomal pathway and the cell death effectors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture Media—All culture media were based on Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 10 unit/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10 mm HEPES (K5 medium). KCl was added to a final concentration of 25 mm (K25 medium) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (K25+S medium).Neuronal Culture—Primary cultures of CGN were prepared from 6-day-old S/IOPS NMRI mice (Charles River Laboratories), as described previously (27.Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balazs R. Jorgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Miller T.M. Johnson Jr, E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. The cerebella were removed, cleared of their meninges, and cut into 1-mm pieces. They were then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) in DMEM. Trypsin was inactivated with an equal volume of K25+S medium and 3000 units/ml DNase I (Sigma) before dissociation by triturating by using flame-polished Pasteur pipettes in DMEM containing trypsin inhibitor and 300 units/ml DNase I. Dissociated cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g. The pellet was resuspended in fresh K25+S medium and cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine (10 μg/ml, Sigma) precoated 60-mm dishes or 24-well plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/cm2. The cerebellar granule neurons were grown in K25+S medium in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C. Cytosine-β-d-arabinoside (10 μm, Sigma) was added after 1 day in vitro (DIV) to prevent the growth of non-neuronal cells. After 4 DIV, K25+S medium was replaced with serum-free K25 medium to eliminate the 20% of cells dying within a few hours after serum removal (28.Miller T.M. Johnson Jr, E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twentyfour hours later, cells were changed to K5 medium or maintained in K25 medium. In some experiments, 10 μm BAF (boc-aspartyl(OMe)-fluoromethylketone; Bio-Rad), a general caspase inhibitor, was added directly to the medium.Determination of Cell Viability—Survival was estimated 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after switching the cultures from K25 medium to K5 medium using the Alamar blue assay (BIOSOURCE) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In other cases, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C and stained with Hoechst 33342 (4 μg/ml, Sigma) in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Cell viability was then scored on the basis of nuclear morphology; condensed or fragmented nuclei were taken to indicate cell death.Plasmids—All constructions used are based on the pCi vector (Promega) and have been described by Chatellard-Causse et al. (16.Chatellard-Causse C. Blot B. Cristina N. Torch S. Missotten M. Sadoul R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29108-29115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). All cDNAs had a tag epitope and were coded for the following proteins: Alix, ALG-2, Alix ΔPP14 (deleted from amino acids 748–761), Alix ΔPGY (deleted from amino acids 802–813), Alix-NT (N-terminal half of Alix ending at residue 434), Alix-CT (corresponds to the first nine amino acids of Alix linked to the C-terminal half of Alix starting at amino acid 468), and Alix-CT ΔPGY (Alix-CT deprived of the PGY domain), and GFP (green fluorescent protein) cDNA as control for the toxicity of transfection.Transfection of CGN—Transient transfection of neurons in primary culture was performed by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method developed by Xia et al. (29.Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and modified by Finkbeiner and Greenberg (30.Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Transfection was performed on neurons cultured 4 days on 14-mm glass coverslips. K25+S medium was removed, and the cells were incubated for 1–2 h with fresh DMEM supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2 in 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Meanwhile, the DNA/calcium phosphate precipitate was prepared and allowed to form for 25–30 min at room temperature before addition to the cultures. Eight micrograms of total plasmid DNA were used for each coverslip. After 1 h of incubation with the DNA/calcium phosphate precipitate, the cells were “shocked” for 1 min with 2× HeBS buffer (274 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.4 mm Na2HPO4, 7H2O, 15 mm d-glucose, 42 mm HEPES, pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2 in 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2% Me2SO. The cells were then washed three times with DMEM, and K25 medium was added to each coverslip. They were then returned to the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C and cultured for the indicated time. The transfection efficiency was determined after immunolabeling with an anti-tag antibody; it was typically between 15 and 20%.Immunocytochemistry—Neurons were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were permeabilized with 0.02% saponin in Tris-buffered saline for 30 min and then incubated with antibodies as follows: mouse anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100), mouse and rabbit anti-FLAG (Sigma, 1:100), rabbit anti-phosphoserine 63 c-Jun and rabbit anti-phospho p38 MAPK (New England Biolabs, 1:100). Primary antibodies were revealed with either goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G coupled to fluorochrome Alexa 594 or Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:1000 in saponin-Tris-buffered saline. The cultures were mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem), and the fluorescence was observed under an Axiovert microscope (Zeiss) connected to a CDD camera or a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM410, Zeiss). Image analysis was performed by using Metamorph™ software (Universal Imaging Corp.).Detection of Active Caspases in Living Cells—CaspaTag™ fluorescein caspase (VAD) activity kit (Intergen) allows the detection of active caspases (caspase-1–9) in living cells through the use of a carboxyfluorescein-labeled fluoromethylketone pan-caspase inhibitor (fam-VAD-fmk). This probe enters the cell and binds irreversibly to activated caspases. After 24 h in either K25 or K5 medium, CGN were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with fam-VAD-fmk in accordance with the supplier's instructions and visualized under an epifluorescence microscope.Caspase-3 Activity Assay—CGN were plated in 60-mm dishes and incubated for 6 h in either K25 medium or K5 medium. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then lysed in 100 μl of buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA). Caspase-3 substrate N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide (200 μm DEVD; Calbiochem) was incubated in 100 μl of buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) at 37 °C for 2 h. P-nitroanilide cleavage was quantified spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 405 nm.Western Blot Analysis—CGN were washed with PBS before being harvested with complete radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). 25 μg of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nylon membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-caspase-3 active (R&D Systems, 1:200), mouse anti-cleaved PARP (New England Biolabs, 1:1000). Appropriate horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used, and the SuperSignal detection method was employed (Pierce).Overlay Assays—HEK293 cells were prepared as described in Chatellard-Causse et al. (16.Chatellard-Causse C. Blot B. Cristina N. Torch S. Missotten M. Sadoul R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29108-29115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Proteins (10 μg/lane) were run in 8% SDS-PAGE and blotted to nylon membranes. Membranes were saturated in blocking solution (Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween, 5% nonfat dry milk, and 2 mm CaCl2) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with Myc-ALG-2 recombinant protein in blocking solution. After 2.5 h, membranes were washed in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2 mm CaCl2. The bound recombinant protein was revealed with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody followed by a goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody; then the SuperSignal detection method was employed (Pierce).RESULTSPotassium Depletion-induced Cell Death of CGN—CGN can be grown in the absence of serum in a medium containing 25 mm KCl (K25 medium) but undergo apoptosis soon after changing to 5 mm KCl (K5 medium) (27.Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balazs R. Jorgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell viability, estimated by the Alamar blue assay (Fig. 1A) or by scoring pyknotic nuclei (not shown), was reduced by 50% 24 h after potassium depletion. In agreement with previous studies (31.Miller T.M. Moulder K.L. Knudson C.M. Creedon D.J. Deshmukh M. Korsmeyer S.J. Johnson Jr, E.M. J.

Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1403-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), addition of the general caspase inhibitor BAF (10 μm) blocked nuclear fragmentation but had no effect on nuclear condensation (not shown) and cell survival (Fig. 1A).Potassium depletion was followed rapidly by activation of caspases. Caspase-3, a central caspase executioner, was activated within 4 h, as shown by the gradual increase in the level of the active p17 form (Fig. 1B). Determination of caspase-3 proteolytic activity in cell lysates demonstrated that 6 h after K+ lowering, the enzymatic activity increased ∼20 times above the control level (Fig. 1C). We also observed that PARP, a specific caspase-3 substrate, was cleaved into a characteristic 89-kDa fragment (Fig. 1D). Caspase-3 activity was blocked when BAF was added to the culture medium at the time of K+ depletion; indeed, the activity in cell lysates from neurons cultured in low K+ medium supplemented with BAF was almost identical to the activity in lysates from cells grown in K25 medium (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, besides caspase-3, K+ withdrawal also triggered activation of caspase-2, -6, - 8, and –9, which were all blocked by BAF (data not shown). These observations, showing that caspase inhibition is not sufficient to allow survival, demonstrate that both caspase-dependent and -independent programs are at work during the death of CGN triggered by potassium depletion.Alix Overexpression Is Sufficient to Induce Apoptosis of CGN—To evaluate a possible involvement of Alix in neuronal death, CGN were transfected with Alix and left in K25 medium. Ten hours after transfection, overexpressed Alix was homogeneously distributed throughout the cell body and neurites (Fig. 2A). Determination of cell viability demonstrated that the transfected neurons underwent cell death; 24 h after transfection, 50% of the Alix-overexpressing neurons grown in 25 mm KCl were dead or dying, whereas neurons transfected with GFP (control vector) were unaffected (Fig. 2B). At this time, caspase activity could be detected in situ using CaspaTag™, and nuclear condensation was clearly visible in Alix-overexpressing neurons (Fig. 2C–E). Addition to the culture medium of the general caspase inhibitor BAF blocked CGN death induced by overexpressed Alix (Fig. 2B). Thus, overexpression of Alix is sufficient to induce caspase-dependent neuronal death in CGN cultured in the presence of survival signals.Fig. 2Alix is sufficient to induce death of CGN cultured in K25 medium. After 4 DIV, CGN were transfected with pCi expression vectors coding for Alix or GFP and cultured with or without BAF. Cultures were then fixed and labeled with a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody to identify transfected neurons. A, 10 h after transfection, overexpressed Alix was distributed throughout the cell body and neurites. B, 24 h after transfection, CGN were stained with Hoechst dye to evaluate the number of transfected dying neurons, i.e. with a condensed or fragmented nucleus. For each experiment, a total number of 200–400 transfected neurons per construct were counted in 10 random fields in two or three different wells. Each experiment was performed at least three times. The percentage of untransfected dying neurons is also represented (–). C–E, neurons overexpressing Alix (C, arrows) exhibit active caspases (D, arrows) and condensed nuclei (E, arrows). Caspa-Tag™ VAD fluorescence-labeled caspase activity kit was used to detect active caspases; the nuclear morphology was visualized with Hoechst staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)C-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38 MAPK are important regulators of the cell death program in post-mitotic neurons. In particular, the JNK pathway and one of its major downstream targets, the transcription factor c-Jun, are thought to play an essential role in the death of CGN (34.Watson A. Eilers A. Lallemand D.

We performed immunofluorescence analysis of c-Jun and p38 MAPK activation to test whether Alix overexpression launches apoptosis by activating these cascades (Fig. 3A–D). Although phospho-c-Jun and -p38 MAPK immunoreactivity were clearly detected in CGN grown in K5 medium (Fig. 3E) or treated with anisomycin, a known p38 MAPK activator (Fig. 3F), there was no evidence to suggest that JNK and p38 MAPK were activated in Alix-overexpressing neurons. Hence, Alix does not induce death of CGN by activating either JNK- or p38 MAPK-signaling pathways.Fig. 3Alix overexpression does not induce c-Jun or p-38 MAPK activation. A–D, after 4 DIV, CGN were transfected with Alix, fixed 24 h later, and immunostained for Alix with a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (A, B), phospho-c-Jun (C), or phospho-p38 MAPK (D). Alix-overexpressing-CGN do not show phosphorylation of either c-Jun or p38 MAPK.

These vacuoles are reminiscent of those seen in HEK293 cells overexpressing Alix-CT together with endophilins (16.Chatellard-Causse C. Blot B. Cristina N. Torch S. Missotten M. Sadoul R. J. Biol.

Most Alix-CT-expressing neurons had a healthy nuclear appearance after K+ lowering, unlike nearby untransfected neurons (Fig. 4E). Twenty-four hours after potassium deprivation, neurons with a condensed nucleus represented only 15% of Alix-CT-expressing cells, in contrast to ∼50% for untransfected, Alix, or GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 4B). The labeling with CaspaTag™ showed no detectable caspase activity in most Alix-CT neurons, in contrast to nontransfected neurons (Fig. 4D). Overexpression of Alix-CT thus protects CGN from death induced by potassium withdrawal.Fig. 4Alix-CT blocks CGN death induced by K+ depletion, whereas Alix overexpression shows no significant effect on the death induced by potassium withdrawal. After 4 DIV, CGN were transfected with an expression vector containing either Alix-CT, Alix, or GFP. One day later, cultures were deprived of potassium (K5 medium).

One of the critical events in the activation of this pathway is the stimulation of the IκB kinases (IKKs) by cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1. Although the mechanisms that modulate IKK activation have been studied in detail, much less is known about the processes that down-regulate its activity following cytokine treatment. In this study, we utilized biochemical fractionation and mass spectrometry to demonstrate that protein phosphatase 2Cβ (PP2Cβ) can associate with the IKK complex. PP2Cβ association with the IKK complex led to the dephosphorylation of IKKβ and decreased its kinase activity. The binding of PP2Cβ to IKKβ was decreased at early times post-tumor necrosis factor-α treatment and was restored at later times following treatment with this cytokine. Experiments utilizing siRNA directed against PP2Cβ demonstrated an in vivo role for this phosphatase in decreasing IKK activity at late times following cytokine treatment. These studies are consistent with the ability of PP2Cβ to down-regulate cytokine-induced NF-κB activation by altering IKK activity.

Activation of these kinases is associated with increased phosphorylation of serine residues in their activation loop at positions 176 and 180 in IKKα and 177 and 181 in IKKβ (9.Mercurio F. Zhu H.

Both increased autophosphorylation and phosphorylation by upstream MAP3 kinases such as NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), TAK1, and MEKK1 are probably important in regulating IKK activity (1.Baeuerle P.A.

Although a number of studies have been reported on the mechanisms that lead to IKK activation, much less is known about the factors such as phosphatases that may down-regulate its activity. Previous studies suggest that the phosphatases PP2A and PP2B can negatively regulate the NF-κB pathway (29.Yang J Fan G. Wadzinski B.E. Sakurai H. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47828-47833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 30.Fu D.X. Kuo Y. Liu B.Y. Jeang K.T. Giam C.Z. J. Biol.

Four classes of serine/threonine phosphatases have been categorized according to their substrate specificity, divalent cation requirement, and sensitivity to inhibitors. PP1, PP2A, and PP2B (calcineurin) have ∼40% amino acid identity in their catalytic domains, whereas PP2C does not share significant sequence homology (33.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). PP1, PP2A, and PP2B (calcineurin) are present in oligomeric complexes associated with their regulatory subunits and are sensitive to the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. In contrast, PP2C is active as a monomer and is insensitive to okadaic acid. In this study, we present evidence that PP2Cβ can associate with the IKK complex to result in IKKβ dephosphorylation and reductions in its kinase activity. PP2Cβ-mediated reductions in IKKβ activity were also associated with decreases in NF-κB activity. These results suggest that PP2Cβ may down-regulate the NF-κB pathway at late times following cytokine stimulation. Analysis of IKK-associated Proteins—CMV expression vectors encoding FLAG-tagged IKKγ/NEMO and Myc-tagged IKKβ were transfected into 293 cells. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested and homogenized in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 250 mm NaCl). After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was applied to the M2 FLAG affinity gel column (Sigma), and the bound FLAG-tagged proteins were washed extensively with Tris-buffered saline and eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma). The eluted proteins were then dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The affinity-purified FLAG-IKKγ/NEMO and associated proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 5% acetonitrile. The purified proteins were reduced, alkylated with dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin. The peptide mixture was loaded onto an on-line capillary HPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA), equilibrated in 0.5% acetic acid, and the peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of 0–40% acetonitrile over 60 min followed by 40–60% over 10 min at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The eluted peptides were analyzed using an LCQ-DECA ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnegan, San Jose, CA) (34.Gatlin C.L. Kleemann G. Hays L.G. Link A.J. Yates III, J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 263: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). All tandem spectra were searched against the University of Washington human data base using the SEQUEST algorithm (35.Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5472) Google Scholar). Data processing of the SEQUEST files to identify proteins associated with IKKγ/NEMO was then performed (36.Link A.J. Eng J. Schieltz D.M. Carmack E. Mize G.J. Morris D.R. Garvik B.M. Yates J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). DNA Constructs—The human PP2Cβ cDNA was isolated from total HeLa RNA followed by reverse transcriptase-PCR using a SuperScript kit (Invitrogen) as suggested by the manufacturer's protocol. The primers used for the cloning of the PP2Cβ cDNA were 5′-GTTCCGAAGCTTATGGGTGCATTTTTGGATAAACC-3′ and 5′-GCCTAGTCTAGATCATATTTTTTCACCACTCATCT-3′. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the HindIII and XbaI cloning sites of the pCMV-FLAG and pCMV-Myc expression vectors and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The phosphatase-defective PP2Cβ (Arg → Gly) mutant was constructed by substitution of the arginine residue at position 179 with glycine using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis with a QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. FLAG-tagged wild type IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ/NEMO, and the constitutively active IKKβ Ser-Ser → Glu-Glu mutant, in which serine residues 177 and 181 were converted to glutamate, were each expressed from a pCMV5 construct as previously described (9.Mercurio F.

The GST-IκBα fusion protein extending from amino acid 1 to 54 was described previously (37.Liu L. Kwak Y. Bex F. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Li X.H. Meek K. Lane W.S. Gaynor R.B. Mol. Cell.

Cell Lines and Transfections—293T and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Transfections with NF-κB luciferase and Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase constructs into 293T cells were performed using Gene-Juice (Invitrogen) as previously described (38.Prajapati S. Gaynor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24331-24339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CMV expression vectors containing a neomycin resistance gene with or without the FLAG-PP2Cβ cDNA were transfected into 293 cells to derive G418-resistant PP2Cβ and control cell lines. Clones were selected in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and FLAG-tagged PP2Cβ-stably expressing cells were identified by immunoblot analysis with the FLAG antibody. For siRNA transfection of HeLa cells, cells at 30–40% confluence were transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) with 21-mer double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides (40 nm) corresponding to either PP2Cβ (sense 5′-GGGAAAAGGAGCGAAUCCATT-3′) or the control HTLV-1 Tax (sense 5′-GAUGGACGCGUUACGGCUTT-3′). At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were either untreated or treated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for different times as described and lysed in PD buffer for kinase assays and Western blot analysis or in Trizol for quantitative real time PCR. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—To determine the interactions between PP2Cβ and the IKKs, Myc epitope-tagged wild type PP2Cβ (2.0 μg) was transfected into 293T cells with FLAG epitopetagged CMV vectors (2.0 μg) encoding either IKKα, IKKβ, or IKKγ/NEMO. Extracts (400 μg) were prepared in PLC buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl, 1.0 mm EGTA, 10.0 mm NaPPi, 100 mm NaF, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). These extracts were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with the FLAG antibody (2.0 μg) followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Bio-Rad) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated complexes were washed three times with PLC buffer, subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, immunoblotted with specific antibodies, and developed using chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies used in these studies included monoclonal antibodies directed against the M2 FLAG epitope (F-3165; Sigma), the Myc epitope (sc-40; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), IKKα (556532; Pharmingen), and IKKβ (550621; Pharmingen) in addition to normal mouse IgG (sc-2025; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and polyclonal antibodies directed against IκBα (sc-371; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-IκBα (9241; Cell Signaling), IKKβ (sc-7607; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), IKKγ/NEMO (sc-8330; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), IKKα (sc-7218; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (sc-805; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or actin (A2066; Sigma). Anti-PP2Cβ antibody was generated using a genetic immunization technique by the Center for Biomedical Invention at UT Southwestern Medical Center (39.Chambers R.S. Johnston S.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1089-1099Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In brief, a codon-optimized human cDNA sequence encoding amino acids 381–480 of PP2Cβ was synthesized and inserted into the expression vector pBQAP-TT. A mixture of expression vectors including pBQAP-TT-PP2Cβ, mouse granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and mouse Flt3L (2:1:1) was imbedded on gold particles and delivered into the ears of CD1 mice using the Helios gene gun. The mice were boosted every 3 weeks for a total of four immunizations, and serum was collected 4 weeks after the last immunization. This serum was used in Western blot and immunoprecipitation analysis at 1:1000 and 1:200 dilutions, respectively. Kinase and Phosphatase Assays—CMV expression vectors encoding either FLAG-tagged wild type IKKβ (0.5 μg) or the constitutively active IKKβ Ser-Ser → Glu-Glu construct (0.5 μg) were transfected either alone or in the presence of Myc-tagged wild type or Arg → Gly mutant of PP2Cβ (3.0 μg) into 293T cells and harvested 30 h post-transfection. Extracts (200 μg) in PD buffer were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 1–2 μg of FLAG antibody, followed by the addition of protein A-agarose for 1–3 h at 4 °C, and extensively washed with PD buffer. In vitro kinase assays were performed for 20 min at 30 °C in kinase buffer containing 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and the GST-IκBα substrate (5.0 μg) followed by analysis by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To assay the ability of PP2Cβ to dephosphorylate IKKβ, FLAG-IKKβ protein was immunoprecipitated from extracts with the FLAG antibody, and autophosphorylation assays were carried out in kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP. The radiolabeled IKKβ protein was washed extensively and incubated with or without FLAG affinity column-purified wild type or Arg → Gly mutant of PP2Cβ at 30 °C for 30 min followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In Vivo Phosphorylation Assay—HeLa cells at 60% confluence were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking phosphate (Invitrogen) in the presence of 50 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (5.0 mCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 4 h. The cells were then treated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) (Roche Applied Science) for the indicated times and harvested in PD buffer. The extracts (200 μl) were immunoprecipitated with antibody directed against IKKα/β, and the radiolabeled IKKβ proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Quantitative PCR was utilized to evaluate the efficiency of siRNA-mediated knock-down of PP2Cβ (40.Takaesu G. Surabhi R. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). cDNAs were prepared from the control and RNAi-transfected HeLa cells using primers for PP2Cβ forward (5′-CTACCGACAACTTCTGGAGGAG-3′) and reverse (5′-TCGAAGAAGTAGCTGTGGCAG-3′) and 18 S RNA forward (5′-AGGAATTGACGGAAGGGCAC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGACATCTAAGGGCATCACA-3′). Each PCR was carried out in triplicate in a 20-μl volume using Sybr Green Mastermix (Applied Biosystems) in the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (40.Takaesu G. Surabhi R. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Quantitation of PP2Cβ mRNA levels was determined using the ABI dissociation curve and normalized to the amount of 18 S RNA present in each sample.

For these studies, 293 cells were cotransfected with CMV expression vectors encoding FLAG-tagged IKKγ/NEMO and Myc-tagged IKKβ, and extracts were prepared. The FLAG-tagged IKKγ/NEMO was then isolated using FLAG affinity chromatography. After extensive washing of the column to remove nonspecific associated proteins, the remaining proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide and subjected to trypsin digestion followed by HPLC and LCQ-DECA ion trap mass spectrometry. In addition to IKKα and IKKβ, three peptides corresponding to the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2Cβ (PP2Cβ) were identified. These results suggested that PP2Cβ could potentially associate with IKKγ/NEMO and IKKβ (Table I).Table IAmino acid sequences of PP2Cβ determined by mass spectroscopy Characterization of IKK Interactions with PP2Cβ—To confirm the association of PP2Cβ with the IKK complex, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed utilizing G418-resistant 293 cell lines that either stably expressed FLAG-tagged PP2Cβ or did not express this epitope-tagged protein. Western blot analysis with the FLAG antibody confirmed the presence of FLAG-tagged PP2Cβ in the stably transfected cell line and its absence in the control cell line (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2).

The ubiquitination signal is recognized by downstream effectors, many of which carry a ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM). Such interactions can be modulated by regulators carrying a ubiquitin-like (UbL) domain, which binds UIM by mimicking ubiquitination. Of them, HR23B regulates the proteasomal targeting of ubiquitinated substrates, DNA repair factors, and other proteins. Here we report the structure of the UIM of the proteasome subunit S5a bound to the UbL domain of HR23B. The UbL domain presents one hydrophobic and two polar contact sites for interaction with UIM. The residues in these contact sites are well conserved in ubiquitin, but ubiquitin also presents a histidine at the interface. The pH-dependent protonation of this residue interferes with the access of ubiquitin to the UIM and the ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA), and its mutation to a smaller residue increases the affinity of ubiquitin for UIM.

Chains or single molecules of ubiquitin can be attached to cellular proteins, giving rise to poly- or monoubiquitination, respectively, which mediates distinct cellular signals (1Conaway R.C.

So far, 27 UIM-containing proteins have been identified in humans (9Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). The S5a UIM requires a string of at least four Lys48-linked ubiquitins for efficient binding (10Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C.M. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5461-5467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). S5a of higher eukaryotes has two UIMs, located near each other in the C terminus. The C-terminal UIM by itself binds polyubiquitin chains as efficiently as the full-length S5a protein, whereas the N-terminal UIM alone binds polyubiquitin chains less efficiently (10Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C.M. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5461-5467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a sequence alignment by Young et al. (10Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C.M. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5461-5467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) revealed that S5a of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Rpn10p) has only one UIM sequence that corresponds to the N-terminal UIM of higher eukaryotes (Fig. 1b). Recently, it has been shown that S. cerevisiae S5a contributes to the targeting of a subset of ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome, but it is not the sole factor involved in polyubiquitin recognition (11Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M. Larsen C.N. Leggett D.S. Muller B. Feng M.T. Tubing F. Dittmar G.A. Finley D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 12van Nocker S.

Subunit S6′ of mammalian proteasome was also shown to recognize the polyubiquitin degradation signal (13Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In contrast to S5a UIMs, those of the endocytic factors Hrs, Eps15, Eps15R, and Vps27 are proposed to bind monoubiquitin tags (8Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M. Capua M.R. Bossi G. Chen H.

The affinity between these UIMs and monoubiquitin seems low; the dissociation constant (Kd) for Hrs binding to monoubiquitin is 230-300 μm (16Shekhtman A. Cowburn D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Gillooly D.J. Madshus I.H. Stang E. Stenmark H. Nat.

Interactions of ubiquitin tags with UIM or UBA of downstream effectors are modulated by proteins that bear UbL domains, some of which are thought to bind UIM by mimicking ubiquitination. Similar to ubiquitin-like modifier proteins such as NEDD8, UbL domains share high sequence homology with ubiquitin (typically 24-33%) and thus adopt ubiquitin folds, as shown by the structure determination of the UbLs of PLIC-2, Parkin, and HR23B (18Walters K.J.

More recently, Rad23 (the S. cerevisiae homolog of HR23B) was proposed to deliver a variety of ubiquitinated cellular proteins to proteasome (27Chen L. Madura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4902-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The interaction between the proteasome and the UbL domain of HR23B is essential for all of these functions. In higher eukaryotes, the C-terminal UIM of S5a has been proposed to be the receptor site for the UbL domain, to which it binds efficiently and with high affinity (Kd = 3.4 μm; this study, see “Results” and “Discussion”); by contrast, the N-terminal UIM does not bind to UbL (22Hiyama H.

In yeast, however, S5a does not have a sequence corresponding to this C-terminal UIM (10Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C.M. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

These observations may suggest that the HR23B receptor sites in the proteasome differ between yeast and higher eukaryotes. The interaction between ubiquitin/UbL and UIM has been studied by mutagenesis and NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments (10Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C.M. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

These experiments all suggest that the conserved hydrophobic patch composed of the side chains of Leu8, Ile44, and Val70 of ubiquitin serves as the binding site for S5a UIM or the proteasome. To understand the structural basis for this recognition, we have solved the structure of the C-terminal UIM of human proteasome subunit S5a in complex with the UbL domain of human HR23B by solution NMR. A comparison of the UIM binding surface of UbL with the corresponding region of ubiquitin, coupled with extensive mutagenesis studies, indicates that the residues forming these interfaces are well conserved between UbL and ubiquitin, except for His68 of ubiquitin. This residue can regulate the access of the UIM or UBA to ubiquitin in a pH-dependent manner. The present structural and mutational data enable us to revise the consensus sequence of UIM. Preparation of Proteins and Peptides—We expressed the N-terminal 87 residues of human HR23B, referred to as UbL, and residues 263-307 of S5a, referred to as UIM, as His-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Labeled proteins were obtained by growing E. coli in synthetic media containing 15NH4Cl and 15NH4Cl/13C-glucose, respectively, and were purified chromatographically. UbL has an extra HHHHHH sequence at its C terminus, whereas UIM has an extra GSH sequence at its N terminus after cleavage by thrombin. The UIM-UbL complex was formed by titrating UIM into UbL, using changes in the amide group resonances of UbL in the 15N,1H HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum correlation) spectrum to indicate 1:1 stoichiometry. The UIM-UbL complex was in slow exchange on the chemical shift timescale. Samples for NMR measurements typically comprised 1.0 mm UIM-UbL complex in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and 5 mm KCl. Various combination of isotopically labeled UIM-UbL complex were used to obtain chemical shift assignments and distance restraints. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were acquired at 303 K using a Bruker DRX500 or DRX800 spectrometer. For assigning the 1H, 15N, and 13C resonances, we carried out a series of three-dimensional triple-resonance experiments (31Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). The stereospecific assignment of the methyl groups of the leucines and valines was achieved using 15% fractionally 13C-labeled protein. Distance restraints were derived from 15N and 13C resolved three- and four-dimensional NOESY experiments with a mixing time of 100 ms. Intermolecular restraints were derived from the four-dimensional 13C,15N-edited NOESY spectrum of a complex formed from 13C-labeled UbL and 15N-labeled UIM with a mixing time of 150 ms and three-dimensional 13C-filtered-13C-edited NOESY spectra of a complex formed from one unlabeled component and one 13C,15N-labeled component with a mixing time of 100 ms. For torsion angle (φ, ψ) restraints, the backbone vicinal coupling constants (3JHN, Hα) were determined by means of HNHA experiment (31Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar) and a data base search procedure based on backbone chemical shifts, using the program TALOS (32Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). pH titration of the unique histidine of ubiquitin, His68, was carried out by measuring one-dimensional heteronuclear multiple-bond 1H,15N correlation spectra of 15N-labeled human ubiquitin at 303 K. Structure Calculations—For structure determination of the UIM-UbL complex, 100 structures were initially calculated by a simulated annealing procedure in CNS (33Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar) and further refined by AMBER 7 (34Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham III, T.E. DeBolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). All interproton distance restraints were derived from unambiguously assigned NOE cross-peaks. The upper limits of NOE restraints were calibrated according to their intensities using ARIA protocols. For the final steps of the calculations, the restraints were included for 25 slowly exchanging backbone amides (2.8-3.4 Å (N-O) and 1.8-2.4 Å (H-O)). In total, 1,630 meaningful NOE restraints (639 intraresidual, 372 sequential, 211 medium range, 305 intramolecular long range, and 103 intermolecular) and 50 dihedral angle restraints were used. Refinement using AMBER 7 consisted of 20-ps molecular dynamics, followed by 1000 steps of energy minimization. To approximate solvent interaction, a generalized Born model was used (35Xia B. Tsui V. Case D.A. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Force constants were 20 kcal mol-1 Å-1 for distance restraints and 150 kcal mol-1 rad-2 for dihedral angle restraints. Of refined 100 structures, the best 20 structures were selected and analyzed using MOLMOL (36Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuethrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6454) Google Scholar), AQUA, and PROCHECK-NMR (37Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4285) Google Scholar) software. No NOE was violated by more than 0.3 Å, and no torsion restraint was violated by more than 4°. The hydrogen bond between UIM Ser294 and UbL Gly50 was assumed on the basis of both mutagenesis of UIM Ser294 and observation of the bond in 98 of the 100 calculated structures. Mutational Analyses—Mutant constructs were prepared with the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). The binding of S5a UIM to ubiquitin, HR23B UbL, and their mutants was determined by surface plasmon resonance using a BIACORE-X instrument. The equilibrium binding affinity of GST-UIM or its mutant immobilized on a CM5 chip was analyzed by monitoring the change in response units as a function of ubiquitin, UbL, or their mutant concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 500 μm at a flow rate of 20 μl/min in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Surfactant P20. The binding of the UBA of yeast Dsk2p to ubiquitin was determined in the same way using a BIACORE-X instrument. A GST fusion protein that contains Dsk2p residues 328-373 (38Funakoshi M. Sasaki T. Nishimoto T. Kobayashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) was immobilized onto a CM5 chip. The effect of mutations on the affinity of S5a UIM for tetraubiquitin was examined by a surface plasmon resonance-based competition assay. The resonance curves were measured for 0.1 μm tetraubiquitin binding to immobilized GST-UIM in the presence of 40 μm His-tagged wild type UIM or its point mutants. A buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Surfactant P20 was used at flow rate of 20 μl/min. The effect of ubiquitin mutation of His68 to valine (H68V) for its binding affinity to the UIM of S5a was also analyzed by GST pull-down assay. 12 μg of GST-UIM was incubated with 3 μg of wild type or mutant ubiquitin in 100 μl of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The bound proteins were analyzed by GSH-mediated pull-down assay coupled with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Structure Determination—The structure of the UIM of human proteasome subunit S5a in complex with the UbL domain of human HR23B was determined from a total of 1,730 NMR-derived restraints (Fig. 2a and Table I). The structure of residues 1-75 of UbL and that of the UIM residues 278-296 of S5a are well defined (Fig. 2b). By contrast, the terminal residues of UIM have no contact with UbL and are therefore disordered. In the complex, UbL folds into an α/β structure comprising a layer of five-stranded twisted β-sheet, backed by a long helix (Fig. 3a). It closely resembles the structures of ubiquitin (Ref. 39Cornilescu G. Marquardt J.L. Ottiger M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6836-6837Crossref Scopus (769) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank code 1d3z), as indicated by the root mean square deviation of 0.741 Å over 30 Cα coordinates for residues in the regions of secondary structure elements. The UIM-bound UbL of HR23B has a structure similar to that of the unliganded form (30Ryu K.S. Lee K.J. Bae S.H. Kim B.K. Kim K.A. Choi B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36621-36627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, the UbL domain of human HR23B shares the same fold as members of the ubiquitin-like modifier family and other ubiquitin-like domains.Table IExperimental restraints and structural statistics of final 20 structuresTotal number of distance restraints1630Intraresidue (|i-j|=0)639Sequential (|i-j|=1)372Medium range (1<|i-j|<5)211Intramolecular long range (|i-j|≥5)305Intermolecular103Number of hydrogen bonds25Number of dihedral angle restraints50EnergiesaGeneralized Born model of AMBER 7 was used.Mean AMBER energy (kcal/mol)−5172 ± 14Mean van der Waals' energy (kcal/mol)−937 ± 12Mean constraint energy (kcal/mol)18 ± 1Mean deviations from ideal geometryBond lengths (Å)0.0100 ± 0.0001Bond angles (°)2.31 ± 0.01Violation statisticsNumber of distance violation > 0.2 Å0.6 ± 0.5Maximum distance violation (Å)0.27Number of dihedral angle violation > 2°0.3 ± 0.4Maximum dihedral angle violation (°)3.64Root mean square deviation from the average structure*Backbone (Å)0.34 ± 0.06Heavy atoms (Å)0.78 ± 0.06PROCHECK statisticsbResidues 1−75 of HR23B and 278−296 of S5a were used.Residues in most favoured regions (%)91.4Residues in allowed regions (%)7.9Residues in generously allowed regions (%)0.6Residues in disallowed regions (%)0.1a Generalized Born model of AMBER 7 was used.b Residues 1−75 of HR23B and 278−296 of S5a were used.

The helix dominates the binding interface, fitting snugly along strands β3 and β5 of UbL, whereas the N-terminal loop runs alongside the loop that connects helix α1 and strand β3 of UbL, mediating minor interfacial contacts. The helical portion of the UbL-bound UIM of S5a, residues 284-296, adopts a nearly identical fold to the corresponding part of a free UIM of yeast Vps27p (residues 303-315), whose crystal structure was solved as an antiparallel four-helix bundle consisting of four molecules (40Fisher R.D.

Recognition of UIM by UbL—UbL has three principle contact sites with the helix of UIM that mediate a central hydrophobic and two polar interactions. The hydrophobic contact site is defined by the outward facing residues Leu8, Ile47, Val71, and Met73 of the UbL β-sheet; the side chains of these residues form a pocket that packs tightly around the methyl group of Ala290 of UIM (Fig. 3, b and c). Leu8 also forms hydrophobic interactions with Leu278 of UIM. Mutation of Leu8 or Val71 of UbL or of Ala290 of UIM largely abolishes binding, indicating that the surface complementarity of these residues is important for binding (Table II).Table IIDissociation constantsKd (μm)Fold decreaseS5a UIM binding to wild type and mutantHR23B UbLWild type3.4 ± 0.3L8A>1000>300I47A16.6 ± 3.14.9V71H>1000>300M73V1.8 ± 0.30.5T75A5.1 ± 0.71.5HR23B UbL binding to wild type and mutant S5aUIMWild type3.4 ± 0.3L278S15.8 ± 0.54.6E283A12.1 ± 1.03.6A290S109 ± 1432S294A213 ± 2463 Open table in a new tab The association of the UIM helix is further stabilized by two polar interactions near both of its ends. Ser294 of UIM accepts a hydrogen bond from the main chain amide group of Gly50 of UbL, which adopts a consecutive type IV (residues 47-50) and type I′ (residues 48-51) β-turns (βT; Fig. 3, b and c). This conformation, which is stabilized by an aromatic-methyl stacking interaction between the phenol ring of Tyr48 and the methyl group of Ala49, places the amide group of Gly50 in a suitable position to form an intermolecular hydrogen bond. The significance of this bond can be seen by the total loss of binding that occurs when the hydroxyl group of Ser294 is replaced by a proton through a serine-to-alanine mutation (Table II). The other polar interaction engages Glu283, the N-terminal residue of the UIM helix, whose side chain carboxyl group can be in a position to make an electrostatic interaction with the side chain amino group of Lys-45 of UbL (Fig. 3b). Alanine substitution of Glu283 moderately decreases binding, suggesting that this charge complementarity is important for binding (Table II). Comparison of UIM-binding Sites between UbL and Ubiquitin—Interestingly, all of the major UIM contact sites in UbL are conserved in ubiquitin. Residues Leu8, Ile44, Val70, and His68 of ubiquitin create a hydrophobic surface that resembles the hydrophobic contact site on UbL (Fig. 3d). Previous mutational analyses have shown that, except for His68, these ubiquitin residues are critical for proteasomal degradation and for binding to S5a and are essential for life in yeast (28Beal R.

The Phe45-Ala46-Gly47 segment of ubiquitin adopts a consecutive type IV (residues 44-47) and type I′ (residues 45-48) β-turns identical to that seen in the Tyr48-Ala49-Gly50 segment of UbL with an root mean square deviation of 0.12 Å across the main chain heavy atoms. Thus, the amide group of Gly47 of ubiquitin is in the same position as Gly50 of UbL, which forms a key hydrogen bond with Ser294 of UIM in the complex. Finally, the positively charged side chain of Arg42 in ubiquitin is located in the same position as that of Lys45 of UbL and thus possibl"

Mouse tryptase-5 (mT5), tryptase-6 (mT6), and mast cell protease-11 (mMCP-11) are new members of this serine protease superfamily whose amino acid sequences are 36–54% identical to each other and to their other 10 family members. The 13 functional mouse proteases can be subdivided into two subgroups based on conserved features in their propeptides. Of the three new serine proteases, mT6 is most widely expressed in tissues. mT5 is preferentially expressed in smooth muscle, whereas mMCP-11 is preferentially expressed in the spleen and bone marrow. In contrast to mT5 and mT6, mMCP-11 is also expressed in mast cells. Although mT6 and mMCP-11 are constitutively secreted when expressed in mammalian and insect cells, mT5 remains membrane-associated. The fact that recombinant mT5, mT6, and mMCP-11 possess non-identical expression patterns and substrate specificities suggests that each protease has a unique function in vivo. Of the 13 functional mouse tryptase genes identified at the complex, 12 have orthologs that reside in the syntenic region of human chromosome 16p13.3. The establishment of these ortholog pairs helps clarify the evolutionary relationship of the serine protease locus in the two species.

Of these proteases, only mMCP-6, mMCP-7, and mT4 have been expressed and the recombinant proteases functionally characterized.

In regard to their in vivo function, administration of recombinant mMCP-6 or hTryptase βI into the lungs significantly enhances the ability of MC-deficient W/Wv mice to combat a Klebsiella pneumoniae infection (24.Huang C.

This protective effect is mediated, in part, by the ability of both hTryptase βI and mMCP-6 to selectively recruit large numbers of neutrophils (22.Huang C. Friend D.S. Qiu W.T. Wong G.W. Morales G.

Although the amino acid sequences of mMCP-6 (13.Reynolds D.S. Gurley D.S. Austen K.F. Serafin W.E. J. Biol.

When placed into the peritoneal cavities of mice, mMCP-7 preferentially induces the extravasation of eosinophils (24.Huang C. De Sanctis G.T. O'Brien P.J. Mizgerd J.P. Friend D.S. Drazen J.M.

The α chain of fibrinogen is a physiologic substrate of mMCP-7 (21.Huang C. Wong G.W. Ghildyal N. Gurish M.F. Šali A. Matsumoto R. Qiu W.T. Stevens R.L. J. Biol.

Thus, the latter mouse tryptase also appears to help prevent the formation of fibrin/platelet clots at inflammatory sites. Unlike mMCP-6 and mMCP-7, mTMT has a membrane-spanning domain at its C terminus that anchors this tryptase in the plasma membrane when MCs degranulate (4.Wong G.W. Tang Y. Feyfant E. Šali A. Li L.

MCs physically contact T cells (30.Mekori Y.A. Metcalfe D.D. J. Allergy Clin.

TMT therefore appears to be a novel granule mediator that mouse and human MCs use to preferentially regulate adjacent cell types that they physically contact. TMT can adversely affect lung function due to its ability to activate IL-13/IL-4Rα/STAT6-dependent signaling pathways. It was discovered recently that pro-urokinase-type plasminogen activator is a preferred substrate of recombinant hTryptase ϵ (31.Yasuda S. Wong G.W. Krilis S.A. Stevens R.L. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 12Google Scholar). The potential roles of the tryptase family of serine proteases in varied inflammatory disorders has prompted the pharmaceutical industry to begin generating low molecular weight protease inhibitors before the number of family members had been deduced. The ability to create inhibitors that selectively inactivate a harmful protease is dependent on our knowledge of how many related protease genes exist in humans, where and when they are expressed, and what are their beneficial and adverse roles in vivo. This knowledge becomes attainable, in part, with the generation of the complete sequence of the human genome and its transcripts. To deduce the function of these proteases in mouse models of human disease, it is imperative that their corresponding orthologs be identified. It is presently unclear how many functional tryptic genes of this family are present in the mouse genome. Even considering the known mouse protease genes on chromosome 17A3.3, it was difficult to assign unambiguously each one to its corresponding human ortholog. For this reason, it was not obvious which mouse protease studies would be relevant to humans. In the present study, we attempt to resolve these issues by comparative genome analysis of the mouse and human loci where these tryptic genes reside. In this process, we describe three new functionally distinct mouse tryptic proteases that are not coordinately expressed in vivo. We also establish that 12 mouse serine protease genes at chromosome 17A3.3 have human orthologs. This information provides a useful framework for the systematic functional analysis of each mouse/human protease pair using transgenic approaches. Analysis of the Serine Protease Gene Cluster on Mouse Chromosome 17A3.3 and Cloning of mT5, mT6, and mMCP-11 cDNAs—The nucleotide sequences of the mMCP-6, mMCP-7, mT4, and mTMT transcripts were used as templates to search for novel, but related, mouse ESTs or genomic sequences in the varied data bases of GenBank™. As noted under “Results,” this approach resulted in the identification of three new members of the tryptase superfamily (designated as mT5, mT6, and mMCP-11). Based on the nucleotide sequences of the identified EST clones, the entire coding regions of the mT5, mT6, and mMCP-11 transcripts were obtained using cDNA libraries from BALB/c mouse skeletal muscle, spleen (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), and IL-3-developed BALB/c mouse bone marrow-derived MCs (mBMMCs) (32.Razin E. Ihle J.N. Seldin D. Mencia-Huerta J.M. Katz H.R. LeBlanc P.A. Hein A. Caulfield J.P. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 1479-1486PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The oligonucleotides used in these PCRs were 5′-GCAGGTGTACTATGGAGCTGGCTCTG-3′ and 5′-TTAGGGTCCCAGGAGGAAGAAGGCGCTACTG-3′ for the mT5 transcript, 5′-CAATGAGGGGTGCTTCCCACCTCCAG-3′ and 5′-GAGGCTCAGGCGAGCCTGGATCCAG-3′ for the mT6 transcript, and 5′-GATATGTGCTTGGGGATGCTCTGG-3′ and 5′-AGAAAGTGAGGCTGGACCAGAAGG-3′ for the mMC-P-11 transcript. The resulting products were purified on 1% agarose gels, subcloned, and sequenced to confirm their identities. The nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs that encode mT4, mT5, mT6, mMCP-6, mMCP-7, mMCP-11, mTMT, mTessp1, mDisp, mBssp-4, mPancreasin, mIsp-1, and mIsp-2 were aligned against the sequence of chromosome 17A3.3 (from the Mouse Genome Project) with the “blastn” algorithm available at the web site for the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The draft sequence of mouse chromosome 17A3.3 also was searched with the translated tblastn algorithm for Spl genes that encode conserved peptide sequences in serine proteases. Transcript Analysis—A semi-quantitative PCR approach was used to screen multiple tissue cDNA libraries (Clontech) for the presence of the varied mouse tryptase transcripts. The oligonucleotides used in these transcript studies and the sizes of the resulting PCR products are summarized in Table I. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH)-specific oligonucleotides (Clontech) were used as positive controls in these transcript profiling studies. MCs express mMCP-6 (13.Reynolds D.S.

Thus, total RNA was isolated from BALB/c, C57BL/6, 129Sv, and WBB6F1-W/Wv mBMMCs cultured in the presence of IL-3 for 1–5 weeks (32.Razin E. Ihle J.N. Seldin D. Mencia-Huerta J.M. Katz H.R.

A semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR approach (30–32 cycles) was then used to assess the relative levels of the mT5, mT6, and mMCP-11 transcripts in the different populations of MCs. As noted under “Results,” IL-3-developed mBMMCs transiently express mMCP-11 mRNA. Thus, to investigate the influence of MC-regulatory cytokines on the expression of mMCP-11, additional experiments were carried out using BALB/c-derived mBMMCs that had been developed by culturing progenitors in the presence of IL-3 with varied combinations of IL-4, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, or kit ligand as described in other MC studies (33.Gurish M.F.

In each instance, the coding region of the tryptase cDNA was placed in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO (Invitrogen). Vector lacking an insert served as a negative control in the transfection experiments. mT4, mT5, mPancreasin, mDisp, and mTessp1 possess predicted glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) signal sequences at their C termini. Thus, in these instances, the expressed protease contained the 8-mer FLAG (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) peptide inbetween the propeptide and the mature domain of the protease. African green monkey SV40-transformed kidney COS-7 cells (line CRL-1651; American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA) and human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cells (line CRL-1573; ATCC) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections were performed in both cell types with SuperFect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were plated at a density of ∼2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates 24 h before transfection. Twenty four h after transfection, the treated cells were washed and then cultured in serum-free Opti-MEM I medium for another 24 h before the conditioned medium and cell pellets were collected. Recombinant mT5, mT6, and mMCP-11 also were generated in High Five insect cells using a modification of the expression system we developed previously to generate recombinant mMCP-6, mMCP-7 (21.Huang C. Wong G.W. Ghildyal N. Gurish M.F. Šali A. Matsumoto R. Qiu W.T. Stevens R.L. J. Biol.

Insect cells lack the post-translational machinery needed to remove the propeptide of a mammalian serine protease zymogen. Thus, the FLAG peptide was placed inbetween the natural propeptide and first residue of the catalytic domain to allow activation of the recombinant bioengineered zymogen by enterokinase. The FLAG peptide also facilitates the purification of the recombinant proteases from the conditioned medium using an immunoaffinity column. In this expression system, the C-terminal hydrophobic domain in mT5 was removed. Protease-expressing insect cells were cultured at room temperature in serum-free, X-press medium for 6–7 days. Generally, 750 ml of conditioned medium were loaded onto a freshly prepared 1-ml column containing anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). After each column was washed with 250 ml of Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.0), 0.1 m glycine (pH 3.5) was used to elute the bound protease. In each instance, 10 1-ml fractions were collected into tubes containing 20 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Samples of the resulting fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for the presence of Coomassie Blue-stained proteins and for immunoreactive tryptases by using anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). Protease-enriched fractions were pooled and their protein contents estimated using the micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce).

Analysis of their predicted primary amino acid sequences revealed potential N-linked glycosylation sites in mT5, mMCP-11, mBssp-4, mTessp1, and mPancreasin. Thus, to determine whether any of these proteases contain N-linked glycans, a sample of the conditioned medium or cell lysate from each transfectant was incubated with PNGaseF (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's suggested conditions. The resulting digests were then subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis. The biotinylated d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone (PPACK) active-site assay developed by Williams et al. (41.Williams E.B. Krishnaswamy S. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2151553870,"Cardiac repolarization is under joint control of the slow (IKs) and rapid (IKr) delayed rectifier currents. Experimental and clinical evidence indicates important functional interactions between these components. We hypothesized that there might be more direct interactions between the KvLQT1 and HERG α-subunits of IKs and IKr and tested this notion with a combination of biophysical and biochemical techniques. Co-expression of KvLQT1 with HERG in a mammalian expression system significantly accelerated HERG current deactivation at physiologically relevant potentials by increasing the contribution of the fast component (e.g. upon repolarization from +20 mV to -50 mV: from 20 ± 3 to 32 ± 5%, p < 0.05), making HERG current more like native IKr. In addition, HERG current density was approximately doubled (e.g. tail current after a step to +10 mV: 18 ± 3 versus 39 ± 7 pA/picofarad, p < 0.01) by co-expression with KvLQT1. KvLQT1 co-expression also increased the membrane immunolocalization of HERG by ∼2-fold (p < 0.05). HERG and KvLQT1 co-immunolocalized in canine ventricular myocytes and co-immunoprecipitated in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells as well as in native cardiac tissue, indicating physical interactions between HERG and KvLQT1 proteins in vitro and in vivo. Protein interaction assays also demonstrated binding of KvLQT1 (but not another K+ channel α-subunit, Kv3.4) to a C-terminal HERG glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Co-expression with HERG did not affect the membrane localization or ionic current properties of KvLQT1. This study shows that the α-subunit of IKs can interact with and modify the localization and current-carrying properties of the α-subunit of IKr, providing potentially novel insights into the molecular function of the delayed rectifier current system. Cardiac repolarization is under joint control of the slow (IKs) and rapid (IKr) delayed rectifier currents. Experimental and clinical evidence indicates important functional interactions between these components. We hypothesized that there might be more direct interactions between the KvLQT1 and HERG α-subunits of IKs and IKr and tested this notion with a combination of biophysical and biochemical techniques. Co-expression of KvLQT1 with HERG in a mammalian expression system significantly accelerated HERG current deactivation at physiologically relevant potentials by increasing the contribution of the fast component (e.g. upon repolarization from +20 mV to -50 mV: from 20 ± 3 to 32 ± 5%, p < 0.05), making HERG current more like native IKr. In addition, HERG current density was approximately doubled (e.g. tail current after a step to +10 mV: 18 ± 3 versus 39 ± 7 pA/picofarad, p < 0.01) by co-expression with KvLQT1. KvLQT1 co-expression also increased the membrane immunolocalization of HERG by ∼2-fold (p < 0.05). HERG and KvLQT1 co-immunolocalized in canine ventricular myocytes and co-immunoprecipitated in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells as well as in native cardiac tissue, indicating physical interactions between HERG and KvLQT1 proteins in vitro and in vivo. Protein interaction assays also demonstrated binding of KvLQT1 (but not another K+ channel α-subunit, Kv3.4) to a C-terminal HERG glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Co-expression with HERG did not affect the membrane localization or ionic current properties of KvLQT1. This study shows that the α-subunit of IKs can interact with and modify the localization and current-carrying properties of the α-subunit of IKr, providing potentially novel insights into the molecular function of the delayed rectifier current system. The delayed rectifier K+ current, IK, is crucial for termination of the cardiac action potential. Following the classical description of IK by Noble and Tsien (1.Noble D. Tsien R.W. J. Physiol. 1969; 200: 205-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), there was considerable debate as to whether IK consisted of one or two components. IK was for a while considered to be a single current with more than one kinetic component (2.Matsuura H. Ehara T. Imoto Y. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1987; 410: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It then became clear that IK is composed of two distinct components, rapidly activating IKr and more slowly developing IKs (3.Sanguinetti M.C. Jurkiewicz N.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 96: 195-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). IKs is formed by the co-assembly of α (KvLQT1) and β (minK) subunits (4.Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar, 5.Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The human ether a-go-go-related gene (HERG) product constitutes the IKr α-subunit (6.Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar) and the KCNE2 gene product minK-related peptide 1 (MiRP1) 1The abbreviations used are: MiRP1, minK-related peptide 1; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NS, not significant. may contribute to IKr as a β-subunit (7.Abbott G.W. Sesti F. Splawski I. Buck M.E. Lehmann M.H. Timothy K.W. Keating M.T. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), although the specific contribution of MiRP1 to native IKr is still controversial (8.Weerapura M. Nattel S. Chartier D. Caballero R. Hebert T.E. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). MiRP1 expression is rather sparse in ventricular tissue (9.Pourrier M. Zicha S. Ehrlich J. Han W. Nattel S. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Deactivation of native IKr outward current is faster than deactivation of the current carried in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by HERG with or without MiRP1 because of a larger proportion in the fast phase (8.Weerapura M. Nattel S. Chartier D. Caballero R. Hebert T.E. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Mutations in genes encoding KvLQT1 (KCNQ1), minK (KCNE1) and HERG (KCNH2) cause distinct congenital long QT syndromes (5.Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 10.Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Spector P.S. Keating M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2208-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 11.Splawski I. Tristani-Firouzi M. Lehmann M.H. Sanguinetti M.C. Keating M.T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), but the clinical initiators of long QT syndromes due to IKs and IKr deficiency, in particular adrenergic stimulation, show considerable overlap. In addition IKr and IKs share some behaviors such as susceptibility to suppression in native systems by cell-isolating enzymes (12.Yue L. Feng J. Li G.R. Nattel S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H2157-H2168PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence of functional interaction between IKr and IKs; when IKr is reduced, the action potential is prolonged, causing IKs activation to increase so as to prevent excess repolarization delay (13.Varro A. Balati B. Iost N. Takacs J. Virag L. Lathrop D.A. Csaba L. Talosi L. Papp J.G. J. Physiol. 2000; 523: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 14.Biliczki P. Virag L. Iost N. Papp J.G. Varro A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The present study was designed to determine whether molecular interactions exist between the corresponding α-subunits, HERG and KvLQT1. Specifically, we sought to determine 1) whether co-expression of KvLQT1 with HERG produces currents different from those resulting from HERG or KvLQT1/minK expression alone and, if so, 2) whether there is evidence of physical interactions between HERG and KvLQT1 proteins. Cell Culture—CHO cells (ATCC) were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in F12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Bio-Media) and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transient transfection into CHO cells was performed with LipofectAMINE-plus (Invitrogen) with HERG (0.5 μgof cDNA subcloned into pcDNA3) and/or simultaneously transfected KvLQT1 (1 μg, subcloned into pCEP4). Cells were studied by patch clamp or immunofluorescence 24–48 h after transfection. cDNA for green fluorescent protein (0.1 μg) served as a transfection marker. In addition, KvLQT1 (1 μg cDNA) and minK (0.5 μg of cDNA) were transiently transfected with or without HERG (0.5 μg of cDNA). When used for negative control experiments, 0.5 μg of Kv3.4 cDNA (pcDNA3) was transfected. Data Acquisition and Analysis—Currents were recorded with wholecell patch clamp at 36 ± 0.5 °C (TC-324B temperature controller, Warner Instruments) with an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp software (version 7, Axon Instruments). Borosilicate glass electrodes had 1.5–3-megaohm tip resistances when filled with internal solution. Cells had mean capacitances of 22 ± 2 picofarads, with no significant differences between cells transfected with only one construct and co-transfected cells. Junction potentials averaged 11.8 ± 0.9 mV. No voltage compensation for junction potentials was made. The extracellular solution contained 136 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.33 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm HEPES 5, and 10 mm dextrose (pH 7.35 with NaOH). Internal solution for current recordings contained 110 mm potassium aspartate, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MgATP, 0.1 mm GTP (lithium salt), 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm sodium phosphocreatine, and 5.0 mm EGTA (pH 7.3 with KOH). Currents were recorded with 2-s test pulses from a holding potential of -80 mV and an inter-pulse interval of 12 s, with deactivation observed during 2–4-s repolarizations to -50 mV. Voltage dependence of HERG current (IHERG) deactivation was assessed with 400-ms pulses to +40 mV followed by 2-s repolarizations to voltages between -140 and 0 mV. The current-voltage relationship of inactivation-free IHERG was evaluated by following a 500-ms activating step to +40 mV with a 25-ms pulse to -110 mV and then by 500-ms test pulses to potentials between -80 and +10 mV. Steady-state IHERG inactivation was assessed with 500-ms pulses to +40 for 500 ms followed by 25-ms steps to between -140 mV and 0 mV and then by 500-ms depolarizations to +40 mV (15.Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Clampfit (Axon Instruments) and GraphPad Prism V3.0 were used for data analysis. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. A two-tailed p < 0.05 by Student's t test was considered statistically significant. Tissue and Cardiomyocyte Isolation—Adult mongrel dogs weighing 27–32 kg were anesthetized (pentobarbital 30 mg/kg intravenous) and artificially ventilated. Hearts were excised through a left thoracotomy, and left ventricular tissue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for sub-sequent immunoprecipitation studies. Left ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated via coronary artery perfusion as previously described (16.Yue L. Feng J. Gaspo R. Li G.R. Wang Z. Nattel S. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 512-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) for immunofluorescent studies. Immunoprecipitation—CHO cells were maintained and transfected in 75-cm2 flasks (Sarstedt) with ∼10.25 μg of cDNA (HERG or HERG plus KvLQT1) with LipofectAMINE-Plus (Invitrogen). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline 48 h post-transfection and resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mm Tris pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 mg/ml benzamidine, and 0.43 mg/ml leupeptin). After homogenization by Polytron (2 × 10-s bursts) and centrifugation, pellets were resuspended in solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 mg/ml benzamidine, and 0.43 mg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were precleared by incubation with 50 ml of protein-G-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation (20 s, 13,000 rpm) to remove beads, 8 μg of anti-KvLQT1 antibody (Alomone) was added to the supernatant, which was then incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. Protein-G-agarose beads (50 ml) were then added, and immunoprecipitates were washed and eluted into SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were analyzed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blotted with anti-ERG1 antibody (Alomone, 1/200 dilution). Bands were visualized with chemiluminescence imaging (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoflurescence and Confocal Microscopy—For immunofluorescent studies, transiently transfected CHO cells were grown on sterile glass coverslips for 24 h. Cells were then fixed (20 min) with 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma), washed 3 times (5 min) with phosphate-buffered saline, and then blocked with 5% donkey serum (Jackson Laboratories), 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 1 h. Cells were incubated overnight (4 °C) with primary antibodies (Chemicon anti-ERG1 raised in rabbits, Santa Cruz anti-KvLQT1 raised in goats) at 1:200 dilution followed by three 5-min washes with phosphate-buffered saline and a 1-h incubation with secondary antibodies (anti-goat IgG labeled with fluorescent isothiocyanate (FITC) for KvLQT1 and anti-rabbit IgG with TRITC for HERG). Confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss LSM-510 system. TRITC (red) and FITC (green) were excited at 543 and 488 nm with HeNe and Ar lasers, respectively, emitting fluorescence at 566 and 525 nm. For immunofluorescent studies of native myocytes, the KvLQT1 antibody raised in rabbits was obtained from Alomone and anti-HERG raised in goats from Santa Cruz Biochemicals. Secondary anti-bodies for myocyte studies were anti-rabbit Cy5-conjugated IgG for KvLQT1 and anti-goat FITC-conjugated IgG for HERG. Cy5 was excited with a HeNe laser at 633 nm, emitted fluorescence at 674 nm, and is represented in red. Blocking conditions were optimized with 2% donkey serum and 0.2% Triton X-100. For deconvolution, the three-dimensional image data was transferred to an AZ-10 work station (Azunis Technologies), and images were processed with Huygens Pro software (Bitplane) with a maximum likelihood estimation algorithm for deconvolution (20 iterations) running on LINUX RedHat. Deconvoluted Z-stacks were transferred back into LSM-510 software for three-dimensional reconstruction. Control experiments omitting primary antibodies revealed absent or very low level background staining. Experiments with primary antibodies on non-transfected mammalian cells indicated no nonspecific staining. Creation of Glutathione S-Transferase (GST)-C-terminal HERG Fusion Protein—Overlap extension technique was used to create a fusion protein with GST and the 478 C-terminal HERG amino acid residues. Primers were 5′-TCAGGATCCCGGGAGTTCATCCGCTTCCAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGTGAATTCCTAACTGCCCGGTCCGAGCC-3′ (anti-sense). HERG (GenBank™ accession number NP 000229) in a pSP64 vector served as a template, and the PCR product was subcloned into a pGEX vector containing GST sequence. PCR products were verified by restriction analysis and sequencing. Protein Purification and GST Pull Down—GST and GST fusion proteins were grown in Escherichia coli strain BL-21 and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Protein purification was verified with Coomassie staining of SDS gels. Solubilized proteins (KvLQT1 and Kv3.4) were pre-cleared with 20 μg of GST beads for 1 h (4 °C) as previously described (17.Robillard L. Ethier N. Lachance M. Hébert T.E. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 1 min, supernatants were mixed with 25 μg of GST-C-terminal HERG fusion protein and kept on a rocking platform for 2 h (4 °C). Beads were then collected by centrifugation and washed 2× with suspension buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, protease inhibitors as above) and then fractionated on 7.5% SDS gels. Electrophysiological Evidence for HERG-KvLQT1 Interaction—Figs. 1, A and B, show currents recorded from cells expressing HERG without and with KvLQT1 co-transfection. KvLQT1 transfection alone with the same quantity (1 μg) of cDNA produced negligible current (Fig. 1C). Transfection of a larger quantity of KvLQT1 cDNA produced a small, rapidly activating and inactivating current (Fig. 1D), as described for that carried by the α-subunit alone (4.Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar, 5.Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). IHERG deactivation time constants upon repolarization to -50 mV after a 2-s step to +20 mV were smaller in cells co-transfected with HERG + KvLQT1 (168 ± 23 and 1181 ± 140 ms, n = 8) versus those with HERG alone (247 ± 38 and 1983 ± 390 ms, respectively, n = 12, Fig. 1E). The proportion of fast phase deactivation was greater in co-transfected cells (32 ± 5%) compared with cells expressing HERG alone (Fig. 1F, 20 ± 3%, p < 0.05). There was no difference in the voltage dependence of activation of cells expressing HERG alone or co-expressed with KvLQT1 (V1/2 -18 ± 2 versus -17 ± 2 mV, n = 15 and 14, respectively, p = NS, Fig. 1G), and reversal potentials (Erev) were unaltered by co-expression of KvLQT1. Mean Erev was -72.6 ± 1.0 mV for HERG + KvLQT1 versus -72.8 ± 1.2 mV for HERG alone (n = 8 each, p = NS). Co-transfection of KvLQT1 increased HERG current (IHERG) densities. Tail (Fig. 2A) and step (Fig. 2B)IHERG densities were significantly larger in co-transfected cells. Deactivating IHERG was significantly larger over a wide voltage range (Fig. 2C), as was inactivation-free current (Fig. 2D), for cells co-transfected with KvLQT1. Inactivation time constants were similar in both groups (e.g. at +10 mV: 2.9 ± 0.3 versus 2.9 ± 0.6 ms for HERG and HERG + KvLQT1 cells, respectively, n = 8 cells each, p = NS). No differences in steady-state inactivation voltage-dependence were observed (V1/2 -86 ± 10 for HERG versus -82 ± 18 mV for HERG + KvLQT1, p = NS). Effect of HERG Co-expression on Current Carried by KvLQT1/minK—Having found that co-expression with the IKs α-subunit KvLQT1 affects IHERG, we sought to determine whether the converse is also true, i.e. whether co-expression of HERG alters currents corresponding to IKs resulting from transient transfection with KvLQT1 and minK. Fig. 3A shows currents resulting from concomitant expression of HERG, KvLQT1, and minK. Upon pulsing to more negative voltages (to -10 mV or less), rapidly activating step currents with relatively large tail currents are seen. At more positive potentials, step currents continue to increase and activate more slowly, whereas tail currents fail to increase appreciably at steps positive to +20 mV. Currents from the same cell after application of 1 μm dofetilide to inhibit IHERG are shown in Fig. 3B and have the slowly activating, sigmoidal form with small tail currents typical of IKs. We found that some run down of KvLQT1/minK currents tended to occur during the time required for base-line recording and dofetilide exposure before repeated recording. To compare directly currents carried by KvLQT1/minK in the absence with those in the presence of HERG, we compared currents in the continuous presence of 1 μm dofetilide in the bath, with identical recording protocols at the same time after formation of the whole-cell configuration. Figs. 3, C and D, show representative recordings of KvLQT1/minK currents recorded with this approach in the absence and presence of HERG co-transfection. Co-expression of HERG did not affect the density of step (Fig. 3E) or tail (Fig. 3F) currents nor the activation voltage dependence (V1/2 19 ± 4 versus 21 ± 4 mV, respectively, n = 10 and 8 cells without and with HERG co-transfection respectively, p = NS). Similarly, activation (Fig. 3G) and deactivation (Fig. 3H) time constants were unaffected. Co-localization of HERG and KvLQT1—We next sought to evaluate the relative distributions of KvLQT1 and HERG proteins in native myocytes. KvLQT1 and HERG protein immunofluorescence localized to the plasma membrane and cross-striations compatible with T-tubules (Figs 4, A and B). Incubation with secondary antibody alone showed no staining with either the secondary antibody used for KvLQT1 (anti-rabbit Cy5, Fig. 4C) or for HERG (anti-goat FITC, Fig. 4D). Co-localization was indicated by the yellow staining observed in deconvoluted images of double-labeled specimens (Fig. 4E). Fig. 4F demonstrates morphological properties of the same myocyte with phase contrast microscopy. Similar results were obtained in separate experiments with cells isolated from each of four dog hearts. Fig. 5 shows deconvoluted immunofluorescent images of CHO cells expressing HERG or KvLQT1 alone or in combination. Confocal imaging of transiently transfected cells expressing only HERG demonstrated a homogeneous pattern of fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm and cell membrane, sparing the nucleus (Fig. 5A). Cells co-transfected with HERG and KvLQT1 showed a clear increase in the relative intensity of the 566-nm fluorescence signal (corresponding to the secondary antibody for HERG detection) at the cell membrane (Fig. 5B). HERG immunofluorescence profiles were analyzed with linear line-scanning algorithms at three randomly chosen membrane locations in each cell (n = 5 cells for HERG, n = 7 for HERG + KvLQT1). Mean values for fluorescence intensity at the membranes on each side of the cell (Fig. 5, right column) were 70 ± 17 and 77 ± 6 relative units, respectively, for cells transfected with HERG alone versus 129 ± 13 and 125 ± 10 relative units for co-transfected cells (p < 0.01 for each). The mean values for cytoplasmic fluorescence determined by analyzing 200 consecutive points at three different locations per cell were not significantly different between cells expressing HERG alone or cells co-expressing HERG + KvLQT1 (66 ± 15 versus 68 ± 22 units, p = NS). The ratios of membrane HERG immunofluorescence intensity to cytoplasmic HERG immunofluorescence in each cell averaged 1.27 ± 0.3 for HERG alone and 2.55 ± 0.5 for HERG + KvLQT1 (p < 0.05), indicating an ∼2-fold increased membrane expression of HERG in co-transfected cells. This difference is in good agreement with the extent of IHERG current augmentation resulting from co-expression with KvLQT1. Fig. 5C shows co-localization of HERG and KvLQT1, indicated by yellow staining, predominantly at the membrane. Fig. 5D shows KvLQT1 immunofluorescence in a cell co-expressing HERG and KvLQT1. In contrast to the results with HERG, the KvLQT1 fluorescent pattern upon co-expression was not different from that seen with KvLQT1 alone (Fig. 5E). Previous studies have suggested a primarily cytoplasmic localization of HERG protein, as this may not traffic efficiently on its own due to ER retention signals and coiled coil motifs in the C terminus (18.Jenke M. Sanchez A. Monje F. Stuhmer W. Weseloh R.M. Pardo L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These investigators observed an intracellular localization of HERG protein very similar to our study. Our findings suggest that KvLQT1 may promote the membrane localization of HERG protein. Co-immunoprecipitation of HERG and KvLQT1—Having shown spatial co-localization within myocytes and CHO cells, we assessed possible physical interaction between the two α-subunits. Western blot and immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out in stable HERG-expressing cells transiently transfected with KvLQT1. Immunoblot of crude membrane (CM) extracts with anti-KvLQT1 detected a band at ∼75 kDa (Fig. 6A, lane 1). Blotting with anti-KvLQT1 after pull down with anti-KvLQT1 revealed a band of identical molecular mass (∼75 kDa, lane 2) as well as a strong band below the KvLQT1 signal corresponding to immunoglobulin. Immunoblotting of crude membrane lysates with anti-ERG1 revealed two specific bands at ∼135 and ∼155 kDa, as expected for HERG (Fig. 6B, lane 1). Immunoprecipitation of KvLQT1 with anti-KvLQT1 followed by blotting with anti-ERG1 antibody revealed bands at ∼135 and ∼155 kDa (lane 2), indicating co-immunoprecipitation of HERG with KvLQT1. These bands were absent when the same procedures (Western blot of crude membrane lysates and co-immunoprecipitation) were performed after preincubating the anti-ERG1 antibody with a specific control antigen (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Finally, as a negative control proteins from CHO cells transfected with KvLQT1 alone were processed as in the co-immunoprecipitation. No bands were seen upon blotting with anti-ERG1 (lane 5). Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. To determine whether HERG and KvLQT1 are physically associated in native hearts, we repeated the co-immunoprecipitation experiments in freshly frozen canine left ventricular tissue. Immunoblotting a crude left ventricular membrane extract with anti-KvLQT1 antibodies revealed a faint but distinct band at ∼75 kDa (Fig. 7A, lane 1). The same band was detected after immunoprecipitation with anti-KvLQT1 (lane 2), indicating that the pull down was effective. Fig. 7B shows ∼135- and ∼155-kDa bands obtained by immunoblotting of crude membranes with anti-ERG1 antibody (lane 1) and their elimination after preincubation with the specific control antigen (lane 2). Co-immunoprecipitation with KvLQT1 (lane 3) followed by blotting with anti-ERG1 revealed similar bands at ∼135 and ∼155 kDa that were eliminated by preincubation of the anti-ERG1 antibody with ERG1 antigen. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments of each type. GST Pull Down of KvLQT1—Increased membrane trafficking of HERG protein together with faster deactivation of IHERG hinted toward involvement of the C-terminal domain in the interaction. We used the complete C terminus of HERG (478 amino acids) fused to GST for pull-down studies of KvLQT1. Kv3.4 was used as a negative control. Fig. 8 shows representative results. Successful pull down was indicated by the single band at ∼75 kDa, representing the KvLQT1 protein (panel A, lane 1). Because solubilized protein samples (Fig. 8A, lane 3) were precleared with GST beads, we can exclude nonspecific interaction between GST and KvLQT1. This is evidenced by the persistence of KvLQT1 protein (band of ∼75 kDa in Fig. 8A, lane 2) after preclearing. In control experiments no interaction was observed between Kv3.4 and the C-terminal HERG-GST. Blotting of whole-cell lysates from transfected cells with anti-Kv3.4 antibody yielded two specific bands of ∼65 and 85 kDa (Fig. 8B, lane 1), which were absent when antibody was preincubated with antigenic peptide (lane 2). Kv3.4 protein samples showed two bands with precleared and solubilized protein (panel C, lanes 2 and 3), but no protein interaction with C-terminal HERG-GST was detected (Fig. 8C, lane 1). In a similar fashion, GST protein alone was unable to precipitate Kv3.4 protein (Fig. 8C, lane 4). In the present study we have demonstrated physical interactions between KvLQT1 and HERG that were associated with increased HERG-protein membrane localization, enhanced current density, and altered biophysical properties of HERG currents. On the other hand co-expression with HERG did not alter the cellular distribution of KvLQT1 or change the density or properties of KvLQT1/minK currents. Physiological Role of IK and Subunit Interactions—IK is a key repolarizing current in the heart. Loss-of-function mutations in the subunits encoding IKr and IKs destabilize repolarization and cause potentially life-threatening arrhythmias (5.Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M.

IKr inhibition causes cardiomyocytes to spend more time at positive potentials at which IKs is activated, increasing the importance of IKs in action potential repolarization and tending to prevent excessive repolarization delays (13.Varro A.

Loss of this compensatory potential because of IKs dysfunction greatly increases the consequences of IKr inhibition and the consequent risk of excessive repolarization delay and arrhythmias (13.Varro A.

We demonstrated previously that a peptide sequence from the NC1 domain of the α3(IV) collagen chain inhibits the in vitro expression of matrix metalloproteinases in human melanoma cells through RGD-independent binding to αvβ3 integrin. In the present paper, we demonstrate that in a mouse melanoma model, the NC1 α3(IV)-(185-203) peptide inhibits in vivo tumor growth in a conformation-dependent manner. The decrease of tumor growth is the result of an inhibition of cell proliferation and a decrease of cell invasive properties by down-regulation of proteolytic cascades, mainly matrix metalloproteinases and the plasminogen activation system. A shorter peptide comprising the seven N-terminal residues 185-191 (CNYYSNS) shares the same inhibitory profile. The three-dimensional structures of the CNYYSNS and NC1 α3(IV)-(185-203) peptides show a β-turn at the YSNS (188-191) sequence level, which is crucial for biological activity. As well, the homologous MNYYSNS heptapeptide keeps the β-turn and the inhibitory activity. In contrast, the DNYYSNS heptapeptide, which does not form the β-turn at the YSNS level, is devoid of inhibitory activity. Structural studies indicate a strong structure-function relationship of the peptides and point to the YSNS turn as necessary for biological activity. These peptides could act as potent and specific antitumor antagonists of αvβ3 integrin in melanoma progression.

Tumor growth and metastasis require cross-talk between tumor cells and host stromal cells as well as interactions between tumor cells and the environmental extracellular matrix (ECM), 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MMP(s), matrix metalloproteinase(s); MT-MMP, membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase; NC1, noncollagenous; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; RT, reverse transcription; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator. especially basement membranes (1.Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 9: 541-573Crossref Scopus (1527) Google Scholar). Basement membranes are thin layers of a specialized ECM which not only provide a supporting structure for various cell types but also largely influence their physiologic behavior. Basement membrane components can also regulate neovascularization, an important process of tumor growth (2.Marneros A.G. Olsen B.R. Matrix. 2001; 20: 337-345Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 3.Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7529) Google Scholar). During tumor invasion, the reinforced interactions of tumor cells with basement membranes lead to a sequential proteolytic degradation of their components (4.Hornebeck W. Emonard H. Monboisse J.C. Bellon G. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 439: 1-11Google Scholar). The degradation of basement membrane macromolecules involves various proteolytic cascades, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the plasminogen activation system. MMPs are a large family of at least 25 members of zinc-containing endopeptidases that degrade ECM macromolecules. Among them, gelatinase A (MMP-2), gelatinase B (MMP-9), and stromelysin (MMP-3) have widely been shown to play a crucial role in the degradation of basement membranes during melanoma progression (5.Hofmann U. Westphal J.R. Van Muijen G.N.P. Ruiter D.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 337-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 6.Vihinen P. Kähäri V.M. Int. J.

MMPs are secreted as inactive zymogens. Their activation, a major step of tumor invasion, results from an imbalance between levels of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and the MMP activators, such as urokinase, plasmin, or membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs). MT-MMPs constitute a new subgroup of MMPs containing an additional domain for anchorage to the plasma membrane. They have been shown to participate actively in basement membrane degradation by directly degrading ECM macromolecules or by activating latent pro-MMP-2 (8.Ohuchi E. Imai K. Fujii Y. Sato H. Seiki M.

On the other hand, the plasminogen activation system is also involved in basement membrane degradation either by direct breakdown of ECM macromolecules or by activating pro-MMPs (11.De Vries T.J. Van Muijen G.N.P. Ruiter D.J. Melanoma Res. 1996; 6: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12.Andreasen P.A. Kjöller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar). This system is composed of two different plasminogen activators, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), both controlled by plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI-1 and PAI-2). Basement membranes are essentially composed of type IV collagen, laminins, entactin/nidogen, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Other collagens, such as types XV and XVIII, are localized in the basement membrane area, but their role in the architecture of basement membranes remains to be clearly defined (2.Marneros A.G. Olsen B.R. Matrix. 2001; 20: 337-345Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Type IV collagen, a major component of basement membrane, is organized as a network of heterotrimers composed of three α(IV) chains. Each chain possesses a 7 S domain at its N terminus, a large central triple helical domain of about 1,400 amino acids, and a C-terminal noncollagenous (NC1) domain of about 240 amino acids. The heterotrimer is composed of three of six possible α(IV) chains, α1(IV) to α6(IV), each encoded by a specific gene (13.Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26033-26036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most widely distributed form of type IV collagen contains two α1(IV) and one α2(IV) chain, whereas other heterotrimers containing α3(IV), α4(IV), α5(IV), and α6(IV) have been described, in glomerular basement membrane, for example (14.Boutaud A. Borza D.B. Bondar O. Gunwar S. Netzer K.O. Singh N. Ninomiya Y. Sado Y. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 40075-40083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The NC1 domain of the α(IV) collagen chains contributes to network polymerization. It is now recognized that NC1 domains from type IV collagen, and also from different collagen types, display several biological activities, mainly by regulating tumor invasion and angiogenesis (16.Ortega N. Werb Z. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4201-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 17.Ssaki T. Larsson H. Tisi D. Claesson-Welsh L. Hohenester E. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1179-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). For instance, NC1 domains from type XV (restin) or type XVIII (endostatin) have been found to inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth (17.Ssaki T. Larsson H. Tisi D. Claesson-Welsh L. Hohenester E. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1179-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In addition, NC1 domains from α1(IV), α2(IV), or α6(IV) chain of type IV collagen also display antiangiogenic properties, whereas the recombinant NC1 domain of the α3(IV) chain exhibits antiangiogenic and antitumoral properties through two distinct peptide sequences (18.Colorado P.C.

In previous studies, we demonstrated that a specific sequence from the NC1 domain of the α3(IV) chain, comprising residues 185-203, inhibited melanoma cell proliferation as well as melanoma cell invasive properties (22.Han J.

Bellon G. Maquart F.X. Borel J.P. Kefalides N.A. Monboisse J.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect was mediated through binding of the NC1 α3(IV)-(185-203) peptide to the αvβ3 integrin and affected the binding and the activation of pro-MMP-2 at the plasma membrane by decreasing both MT1-MMP and β3 integrin expression (23.Pasco S.

In the present report, we demonstrate that the NC1 α3(IV)-(185-203) peptide inhibits in vivo tumor growth in a mouse melanoma model. The proliferation of B16F1 melanoma cells as well as their migration through Matrigel-coated membranes were significantly decreased. The proteolytic cascade of pro-MMP-2 and the plasminogen activation system (uPA and tPA) were also decreased, both at transcriptional and post-translational levels. A shorter peptide corresponding to residues 185-191 (CNYYSNS) shared the same inhibitory properties. The inhibitory effects were conformation-dependent because the three-dimensional structure of the peptide, mainly at the SNS (189-191) triplet level, which forms a β-turn, was crucial for biological activity. The homologous peptide DNYYSNS, which did not form the β-turn at the SNS triplet, was devoid of inhibitory activity. On the other hand, a MNYYSNS peptide, which kept the β-turn conformation, possessed the same inhibitory activity as CNYYSNS. Culture reagents and molecular biology products were from Invitrogen. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), gelatin and Matrigel (ECM gel) were purchased from Sigma. Human plasminogen was from Calbiochem. Anti-mouse PAI-1 antibody was from American Diagnostica (Andresy, France). The NC1 α3(IV)-(185-203) peptide, CNYYSNSYSWLASLNPER, and the corresponding scrambled peptide, YAPLWNRSSFENSLNYSCY, were synthesized by Genopole/E.S.G.S. (Ivry, France). The NC1 α3(IV)-(185-191) peptides CNYYSNS, MNYYSNS, and DNYYSNS were obtained by solid phase synthesis using a Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) derivative procedure and were purified further by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with a C18 column by elution with a gradient of acetonitrile in trifluoroacetic acid, then lyophilized (25.Bouifraden S. Drouot C. el Hadrami M. Guenoun F. Lecointe L. Mai N. Paris M. Pothion C. Sadoune M. Sauvagnat B. Amblard M. Aubagnac J.L. Calmes M. Chevallet P. Daunis J. Enjalbal C. Fehrentz J.A. Lamaty F.

The different peptides were modeled with charged amino acids at the extremities (NH3+ and COO-), according to the chemical synthesis protocol. Female C57BL6 mice (average body weight, 18-20 g) were purchased from Harlan France (Gannat, France). Animals were individually caged and given food and water ad libitum. They were kept in a room with constant temperature and humidity. All mice were acclimatized to our laboratory conditions for 1 week before starting the experiments. The in vivo experiments were conducted according to the recommendations of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. B16F1 cells, a lung metastatic subline of murine B16 melanoma, were a generous gift from Dr. M. Grégoire (INSERM UMRS 419, Nantes, France). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum in 25-cm2 flasks (Nunclon, VWR International, Strasbourg, France) under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Cell proliferation was determined by counting cells with a modified Neubauer cell. At subconfluence, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove residual fetal bovine serum and incubated for 48 h in RPMI medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum, with or without the NC1 α3(IV) peptides (25 μg/ml). Conditioned media were harvested and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. They were then concentrated using Nanosep™ centrifugal devices (VWR International), and their protein contents were determined by the Bradford method, using BSA as a standard (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar). A suspension of B16F1 cells (2.5 × 105 cells in 0.1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium), pretreated or not with the NC1 α3(IV) peptides (25 μg/ml), was subcutaneously injected into the left side of syngeneic C57BL6 mice. Each group contained at least seven mice. The NC1 α3(IV) peptides (50 μg in 0.1 ml of RPMI 1640) were injected around the tumor at days 7 and 14. The experiments were repeated twice. Mice were sacrificed at day 21 and tumor sizes measured. Tumor volume was determined according to Equation 1, ν=1/2A×B2(Eq. 1) where A denotes the largest dimension of the tumor and B represents the smallest dimension (27.Wald M. Olejar T. Sebkova V. Zadinova M. Boubelik M. Pouchova P. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2001; 47: S16-S22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Invasion was assayed in modified Boyden chambers (tissue culture-treated, 6.5-mm diameter, 8-μm pore, Transwell, Dutscher, Brumath, France). Briefly, RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2% BSA was used as a chemoattractant. 5 × 104 cells were suspended in serum-free RPMI containing 0.2% BSA and seeded onto membranes coated with ECM gel (30 μg/cm2). After a 40-h incubation period, cells were fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet for 15 min. Cells remaining on the upper face of the membranes were scraped, and those on the lower face were counted using an inverted microscope. Gelatin Zymography—The expression of MMP-2 in conditioned media of B16F1 cells, treated or not with the NC1 α3(IV) peptides (25 μg/ml), was analyzed in gelatin zymography as described previously (23.Pasco S. Han J. Gillery P. Bellon G. Maquart F.X. Borel J.P. Kefalides N.A. Monboisse J.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar). The secretion of TIMP-2 was analyzed on B16F1-conditioned media in reverse gelatin zymography as described previously (23.Pasco S. Han J. Gillery P. Bellon G. Maquart F.X. Borel J.P. Kefalides N.A. Monboisse J.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar). Gelatin/Plasminogen Zymography—For the determination of plasminogen activators, B16F1-conditioned media were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/ml gelatin and 10 μg/ml plasminogen. After electrophoresis, gels were incubated overnight at room temperature in 100 mm glycine buffer, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Gelatinolytic activity resulting from plasminogen activation was evidenced by white lysis zones after gel staining with G-250 Coomassie Brilliant Blue (28.Huet E. Brassart B. Cauchard J.H. Debelle L. Birembaut P. Wallach J. Emonard H. Polette M. Hornebeck W. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2002; 19: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Aliquots of concentrated conditioned media were electrophoresed in a 0.1% SDS, 10% polyacrylamide gel. They were then transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in a 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 (TBS) for 2 h at room temperature, incubated overnight at 4 °C with PAI-1 antibody overnight and then for 1 h at room temperature with a second peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibody. Immune complexes were visualized with an ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Total cellular RNA was extracted with TriReagent (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA content was evaluated by A260 nm measurement and RNA integrity checked by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA was prepared from 1 μg of total RNA by reverse transcription (RT) at 42 °C for 45 min as described previously (23.Pasco S. Han J. Gillery P. Bellon G. Maquart F.X. Borel J.P. Kefalides N.A. Monboisse J.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar). RT reaction products (2.5 μl) were amplified in a 25 μl of PCR mixture in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 200 μm dNTPs, 0.5 unit of Taq DNA polymerase, and 0.2 μm specific upstream and downstream primers. The upstream and downstream primers used are shown in Table I. The PCR was performed in an Eppendorf thermocycler. For each target gene, the kinetics of amplification were performed and the number of cycles selected within the exponential amplification phase (Table I). The amplified DNA fragments were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of ethidium bromide and quantified using Bio-Capt and Bio-1D software (Vilber Lourmat, Marne la Vallée, France).Table IUpstream and downstream primers used for semiquantitative RT-PCR analysesProtein gene studiedBase sequence of primerAmplification cycle no.β-Actin5′-CTCACTGTCCACCTTCCAG-3′265′-CGACCATCCTCCTCTTAGG-3′uPA5′-TGCCCAAGGAAATTCCAGGG-3′365′-GCCAATCTGCACATAGCACC-3′tPA5′-CAGCAGGCCCTGTATTTCTC-3′365′-TCAGCCGGTCAGAGAAGAAT-3′PAI-15′-TCAGAGCAACAAGTTCAACTACACTGAG-3′365′-CCCACTGTCAAGGCTCCATCACTTGCCCCA-3′MMP-25′-GAGTTGGCAGTGCAATACCT-3′425′-GCCATCCTTCTCAAAGTTGT-3′MMP-14 (MT1-MMP)5′-GTGCCCTATGCCTACATCCG-3′325′-TTGGGTATCCGTCCATCACT-3′TIMP-25′-AGACGTAGTGATCAGAGCCA-3′325′-GTACCACGCGCAAGAACCAT-3′ Open table in a new tab For in vitro experiments, statistical analyses were performed by the Student's t test. Results were expressed as mean ± 1 S.D. For in vivo experiments, volumes of primary tumors were statistically analyzed using the nonparametric U test of Mann and Wittney and the parametric Student's t test paired with weight-matched mice. The π-π* specific transition of the amide bond of peptides and proteins is sensitive to the local secondary structure of residues. The circular dichroism spectrum of the NC1 α3(IV)-(185-203) peptide was recorded on a JASCO 810 dichrograph spectrometer at room temperature using a cylindric cell of 0.1-cm path length. The sample was prepared at a concentration of 0.1 mm in a 25 mm acetic-acid aqueous solution to reach a final pH 5.0. Data presented are the results of nine successive time accumulations in the 185-260 nm spectral range and are expressed as θ, the molar ellipticity (in deg·cm2·dmol-1). Secondary structure percentage contents were deduced from the CD data using the CONTIN program (29.Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). Adjusted local secondary structure predictions were performed using the LINK2 method (30.Alix A.J.P. NATO ASI Series E Appl. Sci. 1997; 342: 121-150Google Scholar), and β-turn predictions were performed by the COUDES propensity method. 2P. Fuchs and A. J. P. Alix, manuscript in preparation. This software predicts the β-turn occurrence in peptides and proteins by successively performing secondary structure predictions through the sequence using the GOR III method (31.Gibrat J.F. Garnier J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 425-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) and then localizing the potential turns (locations and types) in the unordered (neither helical nor strand) regions. Monte Carlo simulations of the NC1 α3(IV)-(185-203) peptide were performed using the method described by Derreumaux (32.Derreumaux P. J. Chem. Phys. 1997; 107: 1941-1947Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which is efficient for peptides up to 20 amino acids. The NC1 α3(IV)-(185-203) peptide was modeled by homology, using the crystal structure of the NC1 (α1(IV)2 α2(IV))2 collagen hexameric structure from Than et al. (33.Than M.E. Henrich S. Huber R. Ries A. Mann K. Kuhn K. Timpl R. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (PDB 1LI1) as a template. Considering that each of the NC1 domains of the α(IV) chains could be divided into two homologous subdomains (34.Netzer K.O. Suzuki K. Itoh Y. Hudson B.G. Khalifah R.G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1340-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we performed a multiple sequence alignment of the six (two α1(IV), two α2(IV), and two α3(IV)) subdomains. The corresponding structures extracted from the crystal data were then restricted to the region corresponding to the NC1 α3(IV)-(185-203) peptide. After a sequence-based structural fit (see Fig. 7A), all the four reference structures corresponding to the α1(IV) (blue, magenta) and α2(IV) (red, yellow) homologous subdomains were found to be closely related with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) ranging from 0.4 to 1.18 Å. Cα coordinates of the NC1 α3(IV)-(185-203) peptide were then assigned using the HOMOLOGY module of the INSIGHT II software (Accelrys). All peptides were modeled on a Silicon Graphics OCTANE DUO work station using the CHARMM program (35.Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14018) Google Scholar), version c27b3. Molecular dynamics simulations were then performed using the CHARMM parallel (C27b3) software on a Sunfire 6800 computer (SMP 24 x Ultra-Sparc III @ 900 MHz, 24 Go), at physiological temperature (310 K), using the Verlet algorithm and an integration step of 1 fs. All atoms were explicitly included in the calculation with water molecules modeled using the classical TIP3P Jorgensen's water potential (36.Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (30548) Google Scholar). Starting structures for the NC1 α3(IV)-(185-203) peptide were those deduced from Monte Carlo simulations; lateral chains were reconstructed using the default parameters as found in the CHARMM parameter file (37.MacKerrel A.D.J.

The different structures were then minimized, first constraining the backbone atoms to allow the side chains to adapt and second with all constraints removed. Folding of the NC1 α3(IV)-(185-196) peptide was studied using the homology model of the NC1 α3(IV)-(185-203) peptide as a starting structure, reduced to its 12 first residues. In each case, the system was minimized, first with the protein atoms fixed and then with the solvent fixed. A final minimization was performed with all constraints removed. The system was then heated to 310 K in a 15-ps heating phase and equilibrated in two 40-ps stages, namely early and late equilibration, in which the velocities were first assigned using a Gaussian distribution and then scaled every 50 steps to keep the temperature at 310 ± 10 K. A force switching function for electrostatics and a potential shifting function for Van der Waals interactions were used, both applied between 10 and 12 Å. Periodic boundary conditions were applied during all of the simulation stages. For each of the NC1 α3(IV)-(185-191) (CNYYSNS, MNYYSNS, and DNYYSNS) peptides, we performed a quasi-exhaustive conformational search. Rather than assuming that each residue can adopt any dihedral angle values in the Ramachandran map, we assumed that each nonterminal residue could adopt one among the only 10 possible (φ, Ψ) couples of values corresponding to the regions of the Ramachandran map which are commonly explored by protein classical residues (32.Derreumaux P. J. Chem. Phys. 1997; 107: 1941-1947Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For each heptapeptide, we got 100,000 possible conformations. All of these obtained conformations were constructed and energy minimized using the CHARMM program (35.Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14018) Google Scholar). Minimization was done in implicit solvent with a dielectric constant ϵ = 80.0. Backbone dihedral angles were first constrained using a force constant of 5,000 kcal·mol-1, progressively relaxed during several successive steepest descent and adopted basis Newton Raphson minimization cycles. A final minimization stage was performed with all constraints removed. Minimization was stopped when the energy gradient was lower than 10-2 kcal·mol-1. For each peptide, the 1,000 best conformations (presenting the lowest energies) were kept for analysis and were reduced into 10 families of representative structures by using the clustering procedure described below. A Boltzmann's weight was then calculated for each family of structures. First, for each of the 1,000 conformations, we computed ΔE(n)=Emin-E(n) where Emin is the energy of the global energy minimum, and E(n) the energy of the nth conformation. Then, for all the n = 1,000 conformations, we computed Z=∑n=1toNe-ΔE(n)/kT where k is the Boltzmann's constant and T the temperature. For each of the 10 families of structures, we calculated Z1=∑i=1toIeΔE(i)/kT where I is the total number of conformations in the family. Finally, the relative Boltzmann probability for each family is given by Equation 5. p(1)=Z1/Z(Eq. 5) Results were expressed as percentages, for convenience. The whole sets of structures explored either by molecular dynamics simulations, or by adiabatic map calculation, were grouped into a reduced number of representative structures using a clustering procedure. For this purpose, each pair of conformations, named i and j, were optimally fitted on their heavy atoms positions, and the corresponding r.m.s.d. values were stored into a two-dimensional matrix. A given element on the matrix diagonal represents the r.m.s.d. between a given conformation and itself, that is r.m.s.d. (i, i) and consequently presents a zero value, and an off-diagonal element represents the r.m.s.d. between two different conformations, r.m.s.d. (i, j). Thus, for the set of N conformations, each line of the resulting (N × N) matrix contains the dissimilarities of one conformation to all the others. Thus, each line was also taken as a vector of N descriptors used to construct a phylogenetic tree based on these dissimilarities, which was cut further to obtain the chosen number of 10 representative families of conformations. The structures belonging to each group were kept into separate files for analysis. For each family, we calculated and graphed the corresponding mean structures using the MolMol program (38.Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). We demonstra"
https://openalex.org/W2134976486,"The peptidoglycan recognition protein Tag7 is shown to form a stable 1:1 complex with the major stress protein Hsp70. Neither protein is cytotoxic by itself, but their complex induces apoptotic death in several tumor-derived cell lines even at subnanomolar concentrations. The minimal part of Hsp70 needed to evoke cytotoxicity is residues 450–463 of its peptide-binding domain, but full cytotoxicity requires its ATPase activity; remarkably, Tag7 liberated from the complex at high ATP is not cytotoxic. The Tag7-Hsp70 complex is produced by tag7-transfected cells and by lymphokine-activated killers, being assembled within the cell and released into the medium through the Golgi apparatus by a mechanism different from the commonly known granule exocytosis. Thus, we demonstrate how a heat shock protein may perform functions clearly distinct from chaperoning or cell rescue and how peptidoglycan recognition proteins may be involved in innate immunity and anti-cancer defense."

Cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae evaluate and cope with their external environment by using rapidly responding, highly complex signaling pathways. Of particular importance are the signaling pathways known collectively as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseDTTdithiothreitolPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideMBPmyelin basic proteinHAhemagglutininWTwild typeHOGhigh osmolarity glycerol.1The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseDTTdithiothreitolPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideMBPmyelin basic proteinHAhemagglutininWTwild typeHOGhigh osmolarity glycerol. cascade, which couples an extracellular input signal to a variety of outputs. The budding yeast possesses five MAPKs acting in five functionally distinct cascades, each mediating physiologically distinct responses (1Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Google Scholar). Adaptation to high osmolarity is mediated by the HOG (high osmolarity glycerol) pathway, in which the Hog1 MAPK cascade couples the high osmolarity signal to glycerol accumulation. The Hog1 MAPK of this pathway is related to the members of the family of human stress-activated p38 MAPKs. The activation of the HOG pathway is regulated by bifurcated upstream branches, one mediated by the Sho1 sensor and the other by the two-component system consisting of Sln1, Ypd1, and Ssk1 (2Brewster J.L. de Valoir T.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1385-1394Google Scholar). The HOG pathway is negatively regulated by Ptp2 and -3, which are protein-tyrosine phosphatases, and by Ptc1, -2, and -3 serine/threonine-protein phosphatases belonging to the PP2C family (3Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Google Scholar, 7Jacoby T. Flanagan H. Faykin A. Seto A.G. Mattison C. Ota I. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 51-60Google Scholar). The HOG pathway regulates various stress genes for osmoprotection including GPD1, which encodes glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in glycerol synthesis (10Albertyn J. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 4135-4144Google Scholar). This pathway is also suggested to be involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, budding pattern, and cell division after osmotic stress. However, the details of the regulatory mechanisms of these events are unknown (11Brewster J.L. Gustin M.C. Yeast. 1994; 10: 425-439Google Scholar, 12Alexander M.R. Tyers M. Perret M. Craig B.M.

In contrast to the HOG pathway, the Pkc1-Mpk1/Slt2 MAPK cascade responds to low osmolarity conditions. An important function of the Pkc1 pathway is to maintain cell wall integrity in response to low osmolarity and high temperature conditions by controlling the assembly of the cell wall (1Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Google Scholar). Another major mechanism for adaptation to environmental changes in yeast is Ca2+ signaling. Calcineurin, essential only under specific environmental conditions, is an important mediator of the Ca2+ signal. Calcineurin is required for the recovery from the G1 arrest induced by mating pheromones and for homeostasis of ions, including Na+/Li+, Mn2+, and OH- (13Cyert M.S. Thorner J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 3460-3469Google Scholar, 14Nakamura T. Liu Y. Hirata D. Namba H. Harada S. Hirokawa T. Miyakawa T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4063-4071Google Scholar, 15Mendoza I. Rubio F.

Calcineurin regulates the expression of ion transporter genes by a mechanism mediated by Crz1, a calcineurin-dependent transcription factor (17Matheos D.P. Kingsbury T.J. Ahsan U.S. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3445-3458Google Scholar, 18Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Google Scholar). Although the defect of either calcineurin or the Mpk1 MAPK cascade alone does not lead to lethality under normal conditions, simultaneous defects of these pathways are synthetically lethal, indicating that the two pathways perform redundant function(s) in same essential event(s) for cell growth (19Garrett-Engele P. Moilanen B. Cyert M.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 4103-4114Google Scholar, 20Nakamura T. Ohmoto T. Hirata D. Tsuchiya E. Miyakawa T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 211-219Google Scholar). Upon activation by Ca2+ or various stimuli, the Mpk1 MAPK cascade maintains cell wall integrity by controlling the cell wall (1Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Google Scholar). In addition to these mechanisms, the two signaling pathways coordinately regulate the G2-M transition through the activation of Swe1, a negative regulator of Cdc28/Clb in the G2 phase (21Mizunuma M. Hirata D. Miyahara K. Tsuchiya E. Miyakawa T. Nature. 1998; 392: 303-306Google Scholar). In this process, calcineurin up-regulates Swe1 function in two ways, one by the activation of the transcription of SWE1 gene and the other by the destabilization of Hsl1 kinase, a negative regulator of Swe1 kinase. A high concentration of CaCl2 in the medium causes the cells to activate these pathways and leads the cells to a G2 cell-cycle delay. It was proposed that the activation of these pathways occurs in response to a membrane stretch stress (21Mizunuma M. Hirata D. Miyahara K. Tsuchiya E. Miyakawa T. Nature. 1998; 392: 303-306Google Scholar). In this present report, we show that the HOG pathway and the Ca2+ signaling pathways antagonize one another in the regulation of cell growth. We further demonstrate that these pathways are antagonistic in the regulation of bud emergence. In the presence of CaCl2 in the medium, the activation of calcineurin negatively regulates actin polarization at the bud site, whereas the HOG pathway promotes bud formation at a step after actin polarization. We also show that the calcineurin-Crz1 pathway is involved in the down-regulation of the HOG pathway activated by Ca2+ or hyperosmotic stress. Yeast Strains, Media, and Plasmids—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. All yeast strains were derivatives of W303. Media used were as described previously (21Mizunuma M. Hirata D. Miyahara K. Tsuchiya E. Miyakawa T. Nature. 1998; 392: 303-306Google Scholar). PBS2 and SSK1 was deleted with the pbs2::URA3 and ssk1::URA3 fragment from pDBP22 and pDSS12 respectively (gift from T. Maeda). STE11 was deleted with the ste11::URA3 fragment from pNC202 (gift from R. Akada). The galactose-inducible PTC1, PTC2, and PTC3 plasmids were used: YEplac195GAL-PTC1, YEplac112GAL-PTC2, and YEplac112GAL-PTC2, respectively (22Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2946-2957Google Scholar). The SWE1-myc construct was generated as follows. The NheI site in the pSWE1-40 (23Booher R.N. Deshaies R.J. Kirschner M.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3417-3426Google Scholar) containing GAL-SWE1-HA was converted to a XhoI site using the linker oligonucleotide 5′-CCTCGAGG-3′, and the XbaI-SalI fragment was cloned into pAS5, pUC119 plasmid containing 9 × Myc epitope tag and TDH2 terminator. The HindIII-SphI fragment of pAS5 was cloned into HindIII-SphI-digested YIp5-SWE1-F, containing the sequences corresponding to the N terminus of SWE1 gene and its own promoter generated by PCR using two oligonucleotides, 5′-TTTTGAATTCTAAATAGGTTCCACCTC-3′ and 5′-TTTTAAGCTTTCGAAGACGGAGAATCT-3′. To create the SWE1-myc strain SHI26, the construct was digested with PmaCI, which cuts the promoter of SWE1, directing integration at the SWE1 locus in yeast. The 3HA-HOG1 construct was generated as follows. The HOG1 promoter region with start codon was generated by PCR using two primers, pHOG1-HindIII (5′-TTTTAAGCTTGACCCATTCCGATTT-3′) and pHOG1-ATG-NheI-BamHI (5′-TTTTGGATCCGCTAGCCATTATTATATACGA-3′), and cloned into HindIII/BamHI-digested pRS-315 plasmid (pRS315-HOG1-F). The HOG1 coding region without start codon was generated by PCR using two primers, pHOG1-NheI (5′-TTTTGCTAGCACCACTAACGAGGAA-3′) and pHOG1-XbaI (5′-TTTTTCTAGATGCAAAAGACTAAA-3′), and cloned into NheI/XbaI-digested pRS315-HOG1-F plasmid. Next, the NheI-digested 3HA fragment was cloned into a NheI site of this plasmid. The resulting plasmid, pRS315-3HA-HOG1, fully complemented the osmosensitivity of the Δhog1 strain. This plasmid was digested with HindIII and XbaI and cloned into HindIII/NheI-digested YIp5. To create the HOG1-HA strain SHI119, the YIp5-HOG1-3HA was digested with Eco81I, which cuts the promoter of HOG1, directing integration at the HOG1 locus in the Δhog1 strain.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceW303—1AMATaade2—1 his3—11, 15 leu2—3, 112 trp1—1 ura3—1 can1—100From Dr RothsteinYAT1MATa Δzds1::TRP1(21Mizunuma M.

Isolation of Suppressor cDNA Clones—The Δcnb1 Δmpk1 mutant (TNP36) was transformed with cDNA libraries constructed in the yeast expression vector pNV7, in which yeast cDNA sequences are placed under the control of the inducible GAL1 promoter (gift from K. Matsumoto, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan) on selection plate (SD minus uracil) containing 1 m sorbitol. The transformants were screened for growth on YPG plate (without 1 m sorbitol). The 85 positive trans-formants were isolated from 35,000 transformants. Six cDNA, including MPK1 gene, were isolated by the screening. Cell-cycle Synchronization—The procedure for cell-cycle synchronization was described previously (21Mizunuma M. Hirata D. Miyahara K. Tsuchiya E. Miyakawa T. Nature. 1998; 392: 303-306Google Scholar). Cells were grown in YPD to a density of 2-3 × 106 cells/ml at 28 °C. Synthetic α-factor was added to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml, and cells were incubated for 135 min. After washing the cells with ice-cold water to remove α-factor, the cells were suspended in fresh YPD or YPD containing CaCl2. Immunoblotting—The cells were washed with TEG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 10% glycerol) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate), and protease inhibitor mixture (α-complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and harvested by centrifugation. Pellets were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C until use. Frozen pellets were resuspended in 100 μlof 2× sample buffer and lysed by vigorous vortexing for 12 min with an equal volume of glass beads at 4 °C. After removal of glass beads, lysates were boiled for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5 or 12% gel for 2 h at 30 mA and analyzed by immunoblotting using either anti-Myc antibody (9E10, BAbCO) or anti-PSTAIRE antibody (this recognizes Cdc28 and Pho85; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Preparation of cell lysates for analysis of Hog1 phosphorylation was as described (3Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Google Scholar), and phosphorylated Hog1-3HA was detected by anti-phospho-p38 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and Hog1-3HA was detected by anti-HA antibody (HA.11, BAbCO) as a loading control. For all immunoblots, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies were used, and blots were visualized by ECL detection systems (Amersham Biosciences). Hog1 Kinase Assay—Hog kinase assay in PTC4 or PTP2 overexpressed cells was performed as follows. A Hog1-HA integrated strain (SHI119) was transformed with vector only (YEp51) or pGAL-PTC4 (YEp51-PTC4). The cells were grown to 4 × 106 cells/ml in SR minus leucine medium at 28 °C and shifted to SG minus leucine medium and induced PTC4 gene expression. After 1.5 h of induction, cells were exposed to 0.4 m KCl for various periods of time. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by vigorous vortexing for 12 min with an equal volume of glass beads at 4 °C in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm DTT, containing protein phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 mm NaF) and protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF and inhibitor mixture; Roche). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation, 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and Hog1-HA was immunoprecipitated by incubation with 2 mg of total protein, 5 μl of anti-HA antibody (HA.11, 1 mg/ml), and 30 μl of protein A beads (Sigma) for 90 min at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed once with buffer A, twice with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1mm DTT, 10 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm PMSF), and once with kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1mm sodium vanadate). The 25-μl supernatants of immunoprecipitates were used for immunoblotting as a loading control. To assay Hog1 kinase activity, Hog1-HA bound to protein A beads was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi) and 45 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP, Sigma) for 30 min at 30 °C. Incorporation of 32P into MBP was assessed by SDS-PAGE and quantified by BAS-1800 Bioimaging analyzer. In the experiments shown in Fig. 2, Δcnb1 Δmpk1 strain (TNP36) was transformed with vector only, pGAL-PTC4 (pNV7-PTC4), or pGAL-PTP2 (pSSP25, Ref. 3Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Google Scholar). The cells were grown to 6-8 × 106 cells/ml in SR minus uracil medium containing 1 m sorbitol at 28 °C and shifted to SG minus uracil medium without sorbitol. Hog1 protein was immunoprecipitated by anti-Hog1 antibody (y-215, Santa Cruz Biotechnology.) with protein A beads and assayed for kinase activity as described above. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis, Fluorescence Staining, and Microscopy—Approximately 1 × 107 cells from yeast culture were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 300 μlof0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Cells were fixed by addition of 700 μl of cold ethanol gradually with vortexing, followed by incubation for overnight at -20 °C. The fixed cells were washed with the same buffer containing RNase A (1 mg/ml) for 3 h at 30 °C. The cells were stained with 100 μl of propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) solution in 4 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min on ice. The cells were analyzed by FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). F-actin was visualized by staining with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, as described (24Adams A.E. Pringle J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 729-731Google Scholar). Quantification of cumulative percentage of bud formation and nuclear division during cell cycle progression in various strains that were synchronized with α-factor was determined by microscopic observation and propidium iodide staining. At least 300 cells were counted for each time point. Identification of PTC4 cDNA as a High Dosage Suppressor of the Synthetic Lethality of the Δcnb1 Δmpk1 Double Deletion—To clarify the cellular event(s) that are regulated by the Ca2+ signaling pathways (calcineurin and Mpk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade), we screened for the complementary DNA (cDNA), overexpression of which could rescue the synthetic lethality of the Δcnb1 Δmpk1 strain. Because the double deletion mutant can grow in the presence of an osmotic stabilizer (e.g. 1 m sorbitol), a yeast cDNA library constructed in an expression vector (pNV7) driven by the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter was introduced into the Δcnb1 Δmpk1 cells grown in the presence of sorbitol. The cells were spread on selection plates (SD minus uracil) containing sorbitol. From ∼35,000 Ura+ transformants, 85 transformants that could grow on YPG plate, but not on YPD plate (both plates without sorbitol), were selected. Six plasmids that reproducibly conferred viability to the Δcnb1 Δmpk1 strain on the YPG plate were recovered. The cDNA contained in the plasmids was designated DSL (for dose suppressor of lethality as a result of the Δcnb1 Δmpk1 double deletion). Nucleotide sequences of the inserts were determined. One of the isolates (DSL1) contained a PTC4 cDNA, encoding a PP2C family protein phosphatase of unknown function (22Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2946-2957Google Scholar). The Lethality of the Δcnb1 Δmpk1 Strain Is Suppressed by the Additional Deletion of the HOG1 Gene—The PP2C family of protein phosphatases are commonly known as negative regulators of the MAPK cascade in various organisms, including the StyI/Spc1 pathway in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and the p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways in mammalian cells (25Gaits F. Shiozaki K. Russell P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17873-17879Google Scholar, 26Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Google Scholar). Likewise, the HOG pathway of S. cerevisiae is negatively regulated by the Ptc1, -2, and -3 PP2C family of phosphatases (3Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Google Scholar, 9Warmka J. Hanneman J. Lee J. Amin D. Ota I. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 51-60Google Scholar). However, the physiological function of Ptc4 is not understood. We presumed that the phenotypic suppression might have been the result of the down-regulation of the HOG pathway by PTC4 overexpression. If this were the case, the lethality of the Δcnb1 Δmpk1 strain should be suppressed by a defective HOG pathway. As expected, the Δcnb1 Δmpk1 Δhog1 triple deletion mutant was viable on YPD plates at 30 °C and even at 37 °C (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the Δcnb1 Δmpk1 double deletion had no significant effect on the osmosensitivity of the Δhog1 strain (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the Ca2+ signaling pathway and the HOG pathway are antagonistic in the growth regulation, but not in the high osmolarity response. Hog1 activation is the result of the phosphorylation of both Thr-174 and Tyr-176. To examine whether the PTC4 gene down-regulates Hog1, we compared the levels of Hog1 phosphorylation in the strains with or without overexpressing PTC4 gene from the GAL1 promoter by using polyclonal antibody against phospho-p38, which cross-reacts with phospho-Hog1. As expected, the level of the high osmolarity-induced Hog1 phosphorylation was significantly reduced by PTC4 overexpression (Fig. 1B). This result was further verified by measuring the Hog1 kinase activity using [γ32-P]ATP and MBP as a substrate. Indeed, the kinase activity was reduced by PTC4 overexpression (Fig. 1C). To see whether the suppression of this lethality is the result of the inhibition of the HOG pathway, we examined whether the overexpression of other negative regulators (PTC1,-2, and -3 and PTP2) known for the HOG pathway can suppress the lethality of the Δcnb1 Δmpk1 strain. Overexpression of the PTC1, -2, or -3 gene could suppress the lethality to a degree similar to the overexpression of the PTC4 gene (Fig. 2A). However, overexpression of the PTP2 gene failed to suppress the lethality (Fig. 2A). We next examined whether overexpression of PTC4 or PTP2 gene truly reduced the Hog1 kinase activity in the Δcnb1 Δmpk1 strain. As the result, overexpression of these genes reduced the basal level activity of Hog1 kinase in the Δcnb1 Δmpk1 strain (Fig. 2B). The PTP2 overexpression inhibited the Hog1 activity, but it could not suppress the growth defect (Fig. 2B). For the difference in the effect of the overexpression of these genes on the growth of the Δcnb1 Δmpk1 strain, see “Discussion.” Δhog1 Mutant Displays Ca2+-induced G2Delay and Polarized Bud Growth—Deletion of the HOG pathway has been shown to partially suppress the defect of the mutants in cell wall integrity signaling in a manner mediated by the SVG (STE vegetative growth) pathway that regulates the cell wall integrity in parallel with the Mpk1 MAPK pathway (27Lee B.N. Elion E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12679-12684Google Scholar). In this process, the HOG pathway seemed to negatively regulate cell wall integrity through the SVG pathway, antagonizing the Mpk1 MAPK pathway. Supporting this possibility, it was shown that the defect of the HOG pathway causes an activation of the STE pathway (28O'Rourke S.M. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2874-2886Google Scholar), which in turn may lead to the activation of cell wall integrity. The HOG pathway seems to be also involved in G2/M cell-cycle regulation. Deletion of HSL1 gene, which encodes a negative regulator of Swe1 kinase, suppressed the lethality caused by the double deletions of the CNB1 and MPK1 genes, suggesting that the HOG pathway and the Ca2+ signaling pathways also antagonize in G2/M cell-cycle progression (data not shown). In the Ca2+-triggered, Swe1-mediated G2/M cell-cycle regulatory mechanism, Zds1 inhibits SWE1 transcription in G2 phase, antagonizing the Ca2+ signaling pathways (21Mizunuma M. Hirata D. Miyahara K. Tsuchiya E. Miyakawa T. Nature. 1998; 392: 303-306Google Scholar. 29Ma X.J. Lu Q. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1327-1340Google Scholar). Therefore, the Δzds1 strain exhibits various Ca2+ phenotypes, including hypersensitivity to CaCl2 (>50 mm), G2 cell-cycle delay, and polarized bud growth. If the HOG pathway and the Ca2+ signaling pathways antagonize one another in cell-cycle regulation, it would be expected that the Δhog1 strain growing in the presence of CaCl2 would display a phenotype analogous to that of the Δzds1 strain. This was indeed the case. The Δhog1 strain exhibited the Ca2+ phenotypes similar to those of the Δzds1 strain (Fig. 3, A and B). The similar phenotypes were not observed with the Δhog1 strain by sorbitol or other cations (e.g. Mg2+ and Na+), suggesting that the Ca2+ phenotypes exhibited by the Δhog1 strain were distinct from those of the high osmolarity of the solutes (Fig. 3A and data not shown). The Ca2+ phenotypes of the Δzds1 strain were shown earlier to be suppressed by the deletion of the CNB1, MPK1, or SWE1 gene (21Mizunuma M. Hirata D. Miyahara K. Tsuchiya E. Miyakawa T. Nature. 1998; 392: 303-306Google Scholar). So we asked whether calcineurin, Mpk1, or Swe1 is required for the phenotype displayed by the Δhog1 strain. The effects of CaCl2 on the Δhog1 strain were all rescued by the deletion of CNB1 or SWE1, but not that of MPK1 (Fig. 3, A and B). However, because the effect of the SWE1 deletion was only partial, it was suggested that the HOG pathway has additional target(s) in the Ca2+-mediated growth regulation. Swe1 Degradation in the Δhog1 Strain Is Delayed by Ca2+— The SWE1 mRNA level of WT cells fluctuates during the cell cycle, peaking in G1/S and declining just before the onset of mitosis (21Mizunuma M. Hirata D. Miyahara K. Tsuchiya E. Miyakawa T. Nature. 1998; 392: 303-306Google Scholar, 29Ma X.J. Lu Q. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1327-1340Google Scholar). We first examined whether the HOG pathway is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the SWE1 gene by measuring the SWE1 mRNA levels in the presence or absence of 50 mm CaCl2 in a synchronized cell cultures by α-factor. The fluctuation pattern was not dependent on the presence of the HOG1 gene, indicating that Hog1 is not important for the transcriptional regulation of the SWE1 gene (data not shown). We next examined whether the HOG pathway is involved in post-transcriptional Swe1 regulation. The accumulation of Swe1 is periodic during the cell cycle, peaking at the time of bud emergence and declining before nuclear division (30McMillan J.N. Sia R.A. Lew D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1487-1499Google Scholar, 31Sia R.A. Bardes E.S. Lew D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6678-6688Google Scholar). We constructed various strains (WT, Δcnb1, Δhog1, and Δhog1 Δcnb1, each on the Δswe1 background) expressing a Myc epitope-tagged Swe1 from the chromosomally integrated gene and compared the fluctuation patterns of Myc-tagged Swe1 by immunoblot analysis in synchronized cell cultures. The Myc-Swe1 construct was fully functional in vivo (data not shown). The G1 cells synchronized with α-factor were released into YPD medium with or without 50 mm CaCl2. The cell-cycle progression in synchronous cell cultures was monitored by the determination of nuclear division and DNA contents (Fig. 4, B and C). As previously reported (30McMillan J.N. Sia R.A. Lew D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1487-1499Google Scholar, 31Sia R.A. Bardes E.S. Lew D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6678-6688Google Scholar), the Swe1 level of the WT strain fluctuated during the cell cycle. The slower migrating species of Swe1 represent a phosphorylated isoform, and the phosphorylation occurs prior to its degradation coincidental with the onset of mitosis (31Sia R.A. Bardes E.S. Lew D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6678-6688Google Scholar). Immediately after the degradation, the faster migrating species of Swe1 re-appeared. In YPD medium, there was no significant differen"
https://openalex.org/W1968292745,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines, MIA PaCa-2, and UK Pan-1, were used to investigate the role of ErbB2 in PDAC oncogenesis. Both these cell lines exhibit exogenous growth factor-independent proliferation that was attributed to the production of autocrine growth factors and/or overexpression of growth factor receptors. The exogenous growth factor-independent phenotype displayed by these PDAC cell lines was dependent on ErbB2 kinase activity since treatment of cells with tyrphostin AG879 prevented serum-free media (SFM) induction of cell proliferation. We determined that ErbB2 kinase contributed to aberrant cell cycle regulation in PDAC through the induction of cyclin D1 levels and the suppression of p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1). Inhibition of ErbB2 kinase led to cell cycle arrest marked by an increased association of p27(Kip1) with cdk2 and reduced levels of phosphorylated pRb. We further observed constitutive STAT3 activation in the PDAC cell lines and an increase in STAT3 activation upon stimulating quiescent cells with SFM. Inhibitors of ErbB2 kinase blocked STAT3 activation, whereas inhibition of EGFR kinase led to a slight reduction of STAT3 activation. STAT3 was coimmunoprecipitated with ErbB2. SFM stimulation caused an increase in the association of ErbB2 and STAT3, which was blocked by inhibition of ErbB2 kinase. Expression of a STAT3 dominant negative prevented SFM-stimulated cell proliferation of MIA PaCa-2 cells, suggesting that activation of STAT3 by ErbB2 is required for a growth factor-independent phenotype of these cells. Consistent with this observation in PDAC cell lines, we found that most PDAC tumor specimens (10 of 11) showed constitutive activation of STAT3 and that ErbB2 was readily detected in most of these tumors (nine of 11). We believe that these findings indicate a novel mechanism of oncogenesis in PDAC and may suggest future therapeutic strategies in the treatment of PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W1989065979,"Sister chromatid cohesion is resolved at anaphase onset when separase, a site-specific protease, cleaves the Scc1 subunit of the chromosomal cohesin complex that is responsible for holding sister chromatids together. This mechanism to initiate anaphase is conserved in eukaryotes from budding yeast to man. Budding yeast separase recognizes and cleaves two conserved peptide motifs within Scc1. In addition, separase cleaves a similar motif in the kinetochore and spindle protein Slk19. Separase may cleave further substrate proteins to orchestrate multiple cellular events that take place during anaphase. To investigate substrate recognition by budding yeast separase we analyzed the sequence requirements at one of the Scc1 cleavage site motifs by systematic mutagenesis. We derived a cleavage site consensus motif (not(FKRWY))(ACFHILMPVWY)(DE)X(AGSV)R/X. This motif is found in 1,139 of 5,889 predicted yeast proteins. We analyzed 28 candidate proteins containing this motif as well as 35 proteins that contain a core (DE)XXR motif. We could so far not confirm new separase substrates, but we have uncovered other forms of mitotic regulation of some of the proteins. We studied whether determinants other than the cleavage site motif mediate separase-substrate interaction. When the separase active site was occupied with a peptide inhibitor covering the cleavage site motif, separase still efficiently interacted with its substrate Scc1. This suggests that separase recognizes both a cleavage site consensus sequence as well as features outside the cleavage site.

This suggests that separase recognizes both a cleavage site consensus sequence as well as features outside the cleavage site. The segregation of sister chromatids to daughter cells during mitosis requires a complex series of cellular events to be performed faithfully, which has been studied in some detail in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1.Nasmyth K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 673-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). One of the key events is activation of a site-specific protease, separase, which triggers the resolution of sister chromatid cohesion at anaphase onset. Sister chromatids are kept aligned in metaphase by a protein complex, cohesin, which counteracts the pulling force of the mitotic spindle. Cohesion is lost abruptly at anaphase onset when separase cleaves the Scc1 subunit of the cohesin complex. During meiosis Scc1 in cohesin is replaced by a related subunit, Rec8, which is cleaved by separase during the two subsequent rounds of meiotic chromosome segregation. Premature loss of cohesion leads to chromosome missegregation, thus cohesin cleavage by separase is kept under tight cellular control (2.Uhlmann F. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Separase is required for processes in addition to sister chromatid separation. These include anaphase spindle stabilization and the coupling of anaphase to mitotic exit during budding yeast mitosis (3.Ciosk R. Zachariae W. Michaelis C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Nasmyth K.

In fission yeast, separase binds to the mitotic spindle and has been implicated in spindle pole body morphology and positioning (10.Uzawa S. Samejima I. Hirano T. Tanaka K. Yanagida M.

In nematode worms separase is required for correct centrosome positioning during the first asymmetric mitotic division (13.Rappleye C.A. Tagawa A. Lyczak R. Bowerman B. Aroian R.V. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) as well as for formation of an intact eggshell of the one-cell embryo (14.Siomos M.F. Badrinath A.

One way in which separase could contribute to multiple processes is that target proteins other than cohesin exist and that cleavage of several proteins during mitosis coordinates these events. We demonstrated previously that the yeast kinetochore and spindle protein Slk19 is a substrate for separase cleavage (15.Sullivan M. Lehane C. Uhlmann F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Slk19 is cleaved concomitantly with Scc1 at the metaphase to anaphase transition, and failure to cleave Slk19 leads to defects of the anaphase spindle. Human and Drosophila separases undergo self-cleavage, contributing to the down-regulation of separase activity at the end of mitosis (16.Waizenegger I.C. Gimenez-Abian J.F. Wernic D. Peters J.-M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1368-1378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 17.Zou H. Stemmann O. Anderson J.S. Mann M. Kirschner M.W.

Identification of further separase cleavage targets could yield insight into how multiple events are orchestrated during mitosis. Some of the requirements for separase may also be explained through the recent discovery of a second, protease-independent, activity within separase (8.Sullivan M. Uhlmann F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).With the aim of aiding identification of separase cleavage targets we investigated how separase recognizes its substrates. All known budding yeast substrates (Scc1, Rec8, and Slk19) are cleaved at one or two conserved peptide motifs, about eight amino acids in length (see Fig. 1A) (15.Sullivan M. Lehane C. Uhlmann F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19.Uhlmann F. Lottspeich F. Nasmyth K.

Science. 2001; 293: 1320-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Separase always cleaves downstream of a conserved arginine residue, mutation of which to a negatively charged amino acid largely abolishes cleavage. The exact sequence requirements for recognition of the cleavage site motif have not been characterized. We therefore performed a systematic mutational analysis of the major separase cleavage site in Scc1. The experimentally derived consensus motif is less stringent than would have been predicted based on sequence conservation, and it can be found in at least 1,100 proteins within the yeast proteome. We show that determinants in addition to the cleavage site are likely to contribute to substrate recognition by separase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESScc1 Cleavage Site Mutagenesis—The SCC1 gene including its native promoter was cloned into YIplac128 (23.Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar), fused to a triple HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; Bio-SVEQGR-amk, biotinyl-6-aminohexanoyl-Ser-Val-Glu-Gln-Gly-Arg-acyloxymethyl ketone. epitope at the C terminus. PCR-based mutagenesis was used to introduce the restriction sites Bcl1 and AvrII surrounding the separase cleavage site at amino acid position 268. The SCC1 coding sequence at nucleotides 780–786 was changed to TGATCAG introducing the Bcl1 site. This created a conservative point mutation of the amino acid sequence (N262Q). Nucleotides 805–812 were changed to CGCCTAGG to introduce the AvrII site, which did not alter the encoded amino acids. After restriction with these two enzymes oligonucleotide linkers encoding the mutant cleavage site motifs were inserted. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.Analysis of Scc1 Cleavage Site Mutants—Scc1 plasmids were linearized by digestion with EcoRV and integrated at the LEU2 locus of strain K7062 (MATa, scc1Δ GAL-SCC1myc18, w303 background) (24.Michaelis C. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 91: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). The endogenous SCC1 gene in this strain is under control of the galactoseinducible GAL1 promoter. All mutant Scc1 plasmids supported cell growth on glucose media when the GAL1 promoter was repressed, indicating that the mutant Scc1 proteins complemented the essential function of the protein. Transformants were chosen which exhibited levels of mutant Scc1 expression similar to endogenous wild type Scc1. Protein extracts were prepared from exponentially growing cultures of these strains, and the relative abundance of the two Scc1 cleavage fragments containing the C-terminal HA epitope tag was analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody 12CA5.Screening of Potential Separase Substrates—Putative separase substrates were identified by searching the yeast genome for the optimal separase consensus cleavage motif (not(FKRWY))(ACFHILMPVWY)(DE)X(AGSV)R using the PatMatch program at the Saccharomyces Genome Data Base. 2The Saccharomyces Genome Data Base can be accessed at www.yeastgenome.org. Other putative substrates containing a (DE)XXR core motif were selected which are known to function in mitotic processes influenced by separase. Candidate genes were modified at their endogenous loci in strain K7428 (MATa, cdc20Δ, GAL-CDC20) (25.Lim H.H. Goh P.-Y. Surana U. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 231-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by a one-step PCR tagging technique to introduce a C-terminal HA6 epitope tag. These strains were arrested in metaphase and released synchronously into anaphase using GAL1 promoter-controlled CDC20 as described previously (19.Uhlmann F. Lottspeich F. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1999; 400: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were prepared at 10-min time intervals, and the migration of candidate proteins was analyzed by Western blotting against the HA epitope tag.Analysis of the Separase-Scc1 Interaction—Recombinant Scc1 was purified from insect cells infected with a baculovirus expressing an Scc1-HA6-FLAG-Intein-chitin binding domain construct as described previously (6.Uhlmann F. Wernic D. Poupart M.-A. Koonin E.V. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2000; 103: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Overexpression in budding yeast cells of separase, fused to a FLAG epitope and chitin binding domain, and its purification on chitin beads were as described previously (6.Uhlmann F. Wernic D. Poupart M.-A. Koonin E.V. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2000; 103: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 26.Hornig N.C.D. Knowles P.P. McDonald N.Q. Uhlmann F. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Separase purified on beads was incubated with 6 μm separase inhibitor Bio-SVEQGR-amk (6.Uhlmann F. Wernic D. Poupart M.-A. Koonin E.V. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2000; 103: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) for 10 min at 25 °C to saturate inhibitor binding to separase. Beads were then incubated with 500 ng of Scc1 for 10 min at 25 °C. After washing, bound proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting.RESULTSAnalysis of a Separase Cleavage Site Motif by Site-directed Mutagenesis—There are five known separase cleavage sites in budding yeast proteins, two in Scc1, two in Rec8, and one in Slk19, which all are characterized by a conserved amino acid motif (Fig. 1A). A systematic analysis of the significance of this motif for cleavage by separase has not been performed to date. We therefore constructed a series of cleavage site motif mutant Scc1 proteins to assess the contribution of each amino acid in this motif to cleavage by separase. Of the two cleavage sites in Scc1, the second more C-terminally located site is cleaved more efficiently, and we used this site for our analysis (Fig. 1B). The task to express and purify large quantities of active separase for biochemical studies in vitro is still a considerable challenge. We therefore constructed yeast strains expressing the mutant proteins as their sole source of Scc1 and analyzed the pattern of cleavage of these mutant proteins in vivo. Separase cleavage of only one site in Scc1 is sufficient for chromosome segregation such that cells can tolerate even complete inactivation of one cleavage site (19.Uhlmann F. Lottspeich F.

Cleavage at the remaining wild type site can serve as an internal comparison for the efficiency of cleavage at the mutant site.To facilitate analysis of Scc1 cleavage, we fused Scc1 to a C-terminal HA epitope tag. Western blotting of extracts from asynchronously growing cells against this epitope revealed three possible bands, corresponding to full-length Scc1 and two C-terminal cleavage fragments (Fig. 1, B and C). In wild type cells only full-length Scc1 and a short cleavage product are visible, corresponding to cleavage at the efficiently used C-terminal site at amino acid 268 (Fig. 1C). The more N-terminal site at amino acid 180 is also cleaved in most of the Scc1 molecules, but the longer fragment thereby produced is processed further by cleavage at the second site (19.Uhlmann F. Lottspeich F. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1999; 400: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Mutation of the conserved arginine at the C-terminal cleavage site to aspartate abolishes separase cleavage at this site, and detection of the C-terminal epitope tag now visualizes the longer Scc1 cleavage fragment (Fig. 1C). We expected that mutations in the second cleavage site that reduce but do not abolish cleavage would generate a mixture of both cleavage products and that their relative intensities would relate to the efficiency of cleavage at the mutant site.We engineered two restriction sites in the coding sequence flanking the C-terminal cleavage site to facilitate mutagenesis. This introduced a conservative point mutation (N262Q) upstream of the cleavage site motif. We analyzed this mutation as well as two other amino acid changes at this position (N262L and N262H) and found that they had no noticeable effect on cleavage (Fig. 1C). The N262Q change is therefore contained in all further mutant proteins. We constructed 30 mutations in the separase cleavage site motif, corresponding to 29 single amino acid changes and an insertion of one amino acid (Fig. 1C). We then compared the effect that each mutation had on the relative abundance of the two C-terminal Scc1 cleavage fragments.Result of the Cleavage Site Analysis—We use the convention P1, P2,... P6 to indicate amino acid positions upstream of the cleavage site, the numeral indicating the distance from the cleavage site. P1′ is the amino acid following the cleavage site. The P6 position is occupied by an invariant serine in all known budding yeast separase cleavage sites (Fig. 1A). The serines at the Scc1 cleavage sites are subject to mitotic phosphorylation by Polo-like kinase, which is thought to regulate cleavage positively (27.Alexandru G. Uhlmann F. Poupart M.-A. Mechtler K. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2001; 105: 459-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). It came therefore to our surprise that substitution not only by negatively charged aspartate or glutamate, but also by hydrophobic leucine or phenylalanine was well tolerated and only led to a minute accumulation of the longer cleavage fragment, indicative of less efficient cleavage at the mutant cleavage site (Fig. 1C). Even an arginine, of opposite charge to phosphoserine, had only a small effect. When compared side by side, phenylalanine and arginine appeared somewhat less favored at P6 compared with other amino acids. Therefore, large hydrophobic or positively charged amino acids at P6 may not be optimal for recognition of this site by separase.P5 is a small hydrophobic residue in most of the known cleavage sites, although a histidine is found at one site in Rec8. Introduction of a large hydrophobic phenylalanine or tyrosine at this position did not affect cleavage. Polar serine or charged glutamate or arginine in contrast strongly reduced or even abolished cleavage at this site. The hydrophobic character of the amino acid at P5 is therefore important for cleavage by separase.The P4 position is filled by a negatively charged amino acid in all known cleavage sites, in most cases glutamate. Removal of the negative charge by mutation to glutamine significantly interfered with cleavage, and changes to a polar serine or threonine, hydrophobic leucine, or positively charged arginine prevented cleavage entirely. The negatively charged character of P4 is therefore indispensable for cleavage by separase.P3 shows no conservation. Various hydrophobic, polar, or positively charged amino acids are found in the natural cleavage sites. We tested also whether negatively charged aspartate was tolerated at this position, and this was indeed the case. Thus, there is no evidence for any preference at P3.The P2 position is taken by the smallest amino acid, glycine, in all known budding yeast cleavage sites. Replacement with the next smallest amino acids, alanine, serine, and valine made little difference to the efficiency of cleavage. Larger amino acids, proline, threonine, phenylalanine, and leucine caused an increasing impediment to cleavage. It is unclear why the very large phenylalanine was tolerated somewhat better than medium sized leucine. In any event, a small amino acid at P2 seems important for efficient cleavage.The P1 residue is crucial for substrate recognition by many proteases. It is an arginine in all known separase cleavage sites, not only in budding yeast but in all organisms so far studied. Mutation of this arginine to aspartate or glutamate has been used to block cleavage of both Scc1 and Slk19 efficiently, although residual slow cleavage occurred when similar mutations were introduced into Rec8 (15.Sullivan M. Lehane C. Uhlmann F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19.Uhlmann F. Lottspeich F. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1999; 400: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 20.Buonomo S.B.C. Clyne R.K. Fuchs J. Loidl J. Uhlmann F. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2000; 103: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). When we placed an uncharged glutamine at P1 of the Scc1 cleavage site, cleavage was blocked almost as effectively as by aspartate. Mutation of the arginine to likewise positively charged lysine resulted in accumulation of the longer Scc1 cleavage product, although some cleavage still occurred at the mutant site. This suggests that a positive charge at P1 is essential and that arginine in particular is an important determinant for substrate recognition by separase.The P1′ position is arginine or lysine in the Scc1 and Rec8 cleavage sites and serine in Slk19. The amino acid at P1′ will form the new N terminus of the C-terminal cleavage product and will according to the N end rule determine its stability (28.Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Both arginine and lysine render the Scc1 and Rec8 fragments very short lived, whereas serine ensures stability of the Slk19 cleavage product (15.Sullivan M. Lehane C. Uhlmann F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20.Buonomo S.B.C. Clyne R.K. Fuchs J. Loidl J. Uhlmann F. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2000; 103: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 29.Rao H. Uhlmann F. Nasmyth K. Varshavsky A. Nature. 2001; 410: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Mutation of P1′ to large or small hydrophobic phenylalanine or leucine, to negatively charged glutamate, or to polar glutamine did all not influence the efficiency of cleavage. This is consistent with the idea that the P1′ residue in separase cleavage sites does not contribute to recognition by separase but helps to determine the stability of the respective cleavage products (29.Rao H. Uhlmann F. Nasmyth K. Varshavsky A. Nature. 2001; 410: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar).Lastly, we analyzed whether the spacing of critical amino acids within the cleavage site motif is important. We inserted a glycine between P4 and P3, which increased the distance between the important hydrophobic/negative amino acid pair at P5/P4 and the arginine at P1. This led to a strong impediment of cleavage, indicating that the distance between P4 and P3 cannot be changed without losing efficient cleavage site recognition by separase.A Separase Cleavage Site Consensus—The above analysis revealed a strict requirement at P4 for a negatively charged amino acid and at P1 for arginine, forming a core (DE)XXR motif at separase cleavage sites. The residues at P6, P5, and P2 also influenced cleavage efficiency albeit to a lesser extent. We studied the effect of amino acids with representative characteristics at these positions, from which we extrapolated to derive a consensus motif for optimal recognition by separase. Phenylalanine and arginine, a positively charged and a large hydrophobic amino acid, were least tolerated at P6, therefore we excluded these and related amino acids (FKRWY) from the consensus. At P5, small or large hydrophobic amino acids work best, whereas a hydrophilic (S) or charged amino acid (ER) prevented cleavage. Histidine is found at this position in one of the budding yeast Rec8 cleavage sites, which was therefore also included in the consensus, as well as two other weakly polar amino acids cysteine and methionine. At the P2 position four small amino acids (AGSV) were all tolerated well, whereas somewhat larger ones (PTL) caused a decrease in cleavage. The consensus therefore only includes the four smallest. We could not find evidence for specificity at either the P3 or P1′ position. Taken together an optimal motif at the analyzed cleavage site in Scc1 may be described as (not(FKRWY))(ACFHILMPVWY)(DE)X(AGSV)R/X, where X denotes any amino acid and “/” is the site of cleavage.A Search for New Separase Substrates—We utilized this separase cleavage site consensus in an attempt to identify novel separase cleavage targets in budding yeast which could help to explain the multiple roles of separase during cell division. The above described consensus motif for cleavage by separase is found in 1,139 budding yeast proteins (based on the current 5,889 translated standard open reading frames collated at the Saccharomyces Genome Data Base). We decided to screen a small number of these proteins for electrophoretic mobility shifts during mitosis which would be consistent with cleavage by separase at the respective predicted sites. We selected proteins containing the consensus motif which either have a known role during mitosis or are of so far unknown function. Of the latter we selected only ones that show cell cycle-regulated mRNA expression, a feature that might be expected from proteins irreversibly modified during mitosis. Because not all separase targets might strictly adhere to the optimal cleavage site consensus, we also included several proteins that only contained the core (DE)XXR motif and that were particularly good candidates because of their known roles in processes thought to be regulated by separase. At least one (DE)XXR motif is found in more than 80% of predicted yeast proteins. The candidates studied included microtubule- or kinetochore-associated proteins, topoisomerases, as well as regulators of chromosome condensation and mitotic exit. We analyzed a total of 63 proteins (Table I), which we visualized by Western blotting after HA epitope tagging. Cultures containing the epitope-tagged proteins were arrested in metaphase by depleting the anaphase-promoting complex activator protein Cdc20 under control of the galactose regulated GAL1 promoter. Reinduction of Cdc20 induced synchronous anaphase followed by cytokinesis and entry into the next cell cycle (Fig. 2).Table ICandidate separase target proteins analyzed Selected proteins containing the optimal separase consensus motif derived in this study, or a minimal (DE) XXR motif, were analyzed.

Symbols indicate whether each protein showed a change in electrophoretic mobility (faster migration ▾, slower migration ▴), a decrease in abundance (▪), or did not show detectable changes (○) during mitotic progression (compare Fig. 2, A–C).Proteins containing the separase consensus motifProteins containing a core (DE) XXR motifBbc1238QVESGR○Ase1▾, ▪375QADEARAsk1▾Bni426TLDHAR○Bik1○881VHDDSRBir1▾Bni5180DVEEGR▴Bfa1▾247NHESSRBrn1○Bre151QYELSR○Cdc14▾59CIDVSRCik1▪Bub1869LIDFGR○Cin8▪Cnm67185VIELGR○Ctf4○Csm259LPENVR○Ctf18○Ent4206THEYAR○Ipl1○Hof181SVEKAR▴Kar3○215EMENARKin4○Kel2571ELETAR○Kip1▪737MHETVRKip2▪Mhp151QMDTAR○Kip3○1005LAEAVRMif2○Srl2255SAEDGR○Msb4○Scc253SADDGR○Mtw1○825IIDMARNet1▾Smc2479GFDPSR○Nud1○566LLERGRRio1○945DFDLVRSli15▾Smc54LIDLGR○Smc4○549PAETVRSpc34○Spc29183SLEHSR▾Spo12○Spc105125QIDDAR○Stu2○199DVEAVRTop1○Ycg1240ILERAR○Top2○Ycs4499SAELSR○Top3○Ynk1110GIDLGR○Utp20○YBL009w40AVDVGR▪Vik1▪643LLDPARYMR196w○YDL144c51SCDYGR○YOR084w○YDL211c299SFENGR○326DHESGRYDR089w609SVDSGR○YJL181w240VLELGR○YMR003w19AAEPGR○YMR134w68ELERGR○YNL176c496CHEIGR○ Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Mitotic regulation of putative separase substrates.

We hypothesized that the response in the isolated heart may be due to augmentation of TXA2R density, which may be initiated by the presence of oxidative radicals. Previous studies have shown that TXA2R density is increased during atherosclerosis on both the medial and intimal smooth muscle layers in human coronary arteries. Here we describe the effect of oxidative stress on TXA2R. The thromboxane A2 receptor β isoform (TXA2Rβ) was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Immunofluorescence suggested that the presence of H2O2 increased translocation of TXA2Rβ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex. H2O2 treatment also increased binding of a TXA2R antagonist ([3H]SQ29548) to membranes. Degradation kinetics of TXA2Rβ following cycloheximide treatment, a protein synthesis inhibitor, suggested not only that TXA2Rβ is a short-lived protein predominantly localized to the ER but also that TXA2Rβ degradation is modulated in the presence of H2O2. Our results indicate that oxidative stress induces maturation and stabilization of the TXA2Rβ protein probably by intracellular translocation. Importantly, these observations also suggest that TXA2Rβ levels are modulated by ER-associated degradation and controlled by the efficiency of transport to post-ER compartments.

Healy C. Daugherty J. Fed. Proc. 1987; 46: 154-158PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of TXA2 to its receptor, a polytopic membrane-spanning protein, induces vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation, as well as mitogenesis and hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells (2Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Two TXA2 receptor (TXA2R) isoforms have been identified, TXA2Rα (343 amino acids), which is mainly located in the placenta, and TXA2Rβ (407 amino acids), located in the endothelium; these isoforms are generated by the alternative splicing of a single gene (3Hirata M.

The TXA2R is part of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, and evidence suggests that TXA2-induced production of second messenger inositol polyphosphates results from the activation of the Gq11 family of heterotrimeric G proteins (5Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isoprostanes are formed by free radical attack on membrane phospholipids during oxidative stress (6Morrow J.D. Harris T.M. Roberts II, L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). They are found in increased concentration in patients with coronary heart disease and are potent vasoconstrictors (7Mehrabi M.R. Ekmekcioglu C. Tatzber F. Oguogho A. Ullrich R. Morgan A. Tamaddon F. Grimm M. Glogar H.D. Sinzinger H. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have shown that one of these, the 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α, is a potent coronary vasoconstrictor, and its effect is exerted via partial agonist action on the TXA2R (8Kromer B.M. Tippins J.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This mechanism of action on TXA2R, in vascular smooth muscle and in platelets, has been confirmed in a TXA2R knock-out mouse (9Audoly L.P. Rocca B. Fabre J.E. Koller B.H. Thomas D. Loeb A.L. Coffman T.M. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2833-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Our data suggested that a critical determinant of the intrinsic activity of the isoprostane is the TXA2R reserve, and this has subsequently been supported by another study (10John G.W. Valentin J.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have shown that, in the normal rat heart perfused at constant pressure in the Langendoff mode, 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α had no effect, even though U46619, a TXA2R agonist, produced a pronounced vasoconstriction. However, after an oxidative stress induced by 30 min of low flow and reperfusion or by a superoxide-generating system (i.e. xanthine and xanthine oxidase), 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α became a potent vasoconstrictor, whereas the response to U46619 was unchanged (11Kromer B.M. Tippins J.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 1171-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Responses to both agonists were inhibited by the TXA2R antagonist SQ29548, suggesting that they act upon the same receptor. The rapidity of the change in response suggests that this is unlikely to be due to alterations in gene expression and could be explained in several ways including loss of NO-mediated physiological antagonism (12Kamekura I. Okumura K. Matsui H. Murase K. Mokuno S. Toki Y. Nakashima Y. Ito T. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1999; 33: 836-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), changes in the second messenger systems that transduce the response to isoprostane, or an increase in receptor reserve. Evidence for this last possibility has been gained from clinical studies; platelet TXA2R expression is increased in patients in acute myocardial infarction (13Modesti P.A. Colella A. Cecioni I. Costoli A. Biagini D. Migliorini A. Neri Serneri G.G. Am. Heart. J. 1995; 129: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and in human coronary arteries TXA2R density is augmented during cardiovascular disease (14Katugampola S.D. Kuc R.E. Maguire J.J.

One of the possible mechanisms for oxidative stress to increase the TXA2R reserve could be the relocation of an inactive pool of receptor; in hypoxic or ischemic hearts, oxidative stress may induce the translocation of glucose transporters GLUT 1 and GLUT 4 (16Sun D. Nguyen N. DeGrado T.R. Schwaiger M. Brosius III, F.C. Circulation. 1994; 89: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Alternatively, stabilization of the protein could account for activation; in melanoma cells, dihydroxyphenylalanine induces the transition of misfolded wild type tyrosinase to the native and functional form, which is competent to exit the ER (17Halaban R. Cheng E. Svedine S. Aron R. Hebert D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11933-11938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that oxidative stress could act on the TXA2R folding, as dihydroxyphenylalanine on tyrosinase, through the unfolded protein response (UPR) mechanism, which is activated under a variety of stress conditions (18Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar).

At 24 h post-transfection, COS-7 cells were treated with cycloheximide (200 μg/ml, 2 h) by adding the drug to the medium, and then the cells were submitted to oxidative stress (H2O2, 10 μm, 40 min). The cells were washed twice in 10 mm triethanolamine, 10 mm acetic acid, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, harvested with a rubber policeman in 800 μl of buffer containing protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture tablets; Roche Applied Science), and homogenized by 15 passages through a 25-gauge needle on a 1-ml syringe. Nuclei and intact cells were removed by microcentrifugation at 1200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The postnuclear supernatant was loaded on preformed Nycodenz gradients prepared exactly as described (19Rickwood D. Ford T. Graham J. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 123: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The postnuclear supernatant was loaded on top of the gradients and centrifuged for 1.5 h at 46,000 rpm in a Beckman L8-55 ultracentrifuge. Equal fractions were collected, and aliquots of each fraction were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE gels. The distribution of TXA2Rβ, calnexin (ER marker), and β-COP (intermediate compartment/Golgi complex marker) in the gradients was determined by immunoblotting. Immunoblotting—Protein estimation was performed (Bradford assay), and 20 μg of cell lysate protein/lane were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by wet transfer. The filters were blocked in 5% milk, phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.1% Tween 20, probed with primary antibodies (in a 10-ml block) for 1 h, washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20, and then incubated with secondary antibody (diluted 1:5000) in blocking buffer for 1 h and washed. Detection was by chemiluminescence. Kinetic Analysis—COS-7 cells were grown on coverslips and transiently transfected with pCDNA4/TXA2Rβ-Myc-His as described above. At 24 h post-transfection, the COS-7 cells were treated with cycloheximide (200 μg/ml, 2 h) by adding the drug to the medium, and then cells were submitted to oxidative stress (H2O2, 10 μm, 40 min). The medium was replaced by a new medium containing cyloheximide throughout the experiment. At the indicated time the cells were collected and subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE gels. Loading control was performed using an anti-tubulin mouse antibody (gift from Keith Gull, Oxford, UK). Binding Analysis—COS-7 cells were grown on coverslips and transiently transfected with pCDNA4/TXA2Rβ-Myc-His as described above. At 24 h post-transfection, the COS-7 cells (107) were homogenized in 1 ml of binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 μm indomethacin, 50 μg/ml glutathione) using a cell homogenizer. After 5 min of centrifugation at 1000 × g, the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet corresponding to the membrane fraction was further resuspended in 600 μl of binding buffer and homogenized. For the binding assay, 50 μg of protein of the membrane fraction was incubated with a TXA2R antagonist ([3H]SQ29548, 30 Ci/mol, 1-100 nm; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence or absence of 5 μm of unlabeled (cold) SQ29548 in a 0.1-ml reaction volume with vigorous shaking at room temperature for 60 min. The reaction was then terminated by adding 1 ml of ice-cold washing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The unbound ligand was filtered under vacuum through a Whatman GF/C glass filter (Whatman, Clifton, NJ) presoaked with the ice-cold washing buffer. The radioactivity of the TP receptor-bound [3H]SQ29548 remaining on the glass filter was counted in 8 ml of scintillation mixture (EN3HANCE; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a Beckman counter (Fullerton, CA). The Kd and Bmax values (means ± S.D.) were compared using Student's unpaired t test with a significance value of p < 0.05. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline with 3.6% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 10 min with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature. For the localization of the TXA2Rβ wild type, the cells were doubly stained using DAPI (nuclear staining) and polyclonal antibody against the TXA2Rβ (described above). The secondary antibody used was Oregon Green-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. For co-localization of TXA2Rβ-Myc-His, the cells were stained using DAPI, anti-Myc Cy3-conjugated, and anti-Golgin-97 (cis-Golgi marker) monoclonal antibody. The secondary antibody used was Oregon Green-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Immunofluorescence was visualized under a Nikon E600 immunofluorescence microscope equipped with 100×/1.3 Plan-Fluor oil immersion objective. The digital images were merged and assembled into figures using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc.). Electron Microscopy—The cells were fixed in suspension by adding chilled 5% glutaraldehyde and 8% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline in a 1:1 ratio to the growth medium. The final dilutions were therefore 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were fixed on ice for 10 min, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant carefully replaced with fresh fixative for a further 50 min without disturbing the pellet, rinsed in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer at room temperature for 1 h. After rinsing in buffer, the cells were then dehydrated in an ethanol series, adding 1% uranyl acetate at the 30% stage, followed by propylene oxide and then embedded in Epon/Araldite 502 and finally polymerized at 60 °C for 48 h. The sections were cut on a Leica Ultracut T ultramicrotome at 70 nm using a diamond knife, contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined on a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope. Confocal Microscopy—COS-7 cells were grown on coverslips and transiently transfected with pCDNA3.1/TXA2Rβ-GFP. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were incubated 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of 200 μg/ml of cycloheximide (control), submitted to oxidative stress, fixed, permeabilized, and stained with the anti-golgin-97 monoclonal antibody and anti-mouse Texas Red-conjugated antibody as described above. The slides were examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Axioplan 2 with LSM 510; Carl Zeiss Inc.) equipped with 100×/1.4 Plan-APOCHROMAT oil immersion objective. GFP and Texas Red were excited with 488 and 595 nm of krypton-argon lasers, respectively, and individual channels were scanned in series to prevent cross-channel bleed through. Each image represents a single 0.4 μm “Z” optical section of GFP-transfected cells. Detection and Localization of TXA2Rβ in COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells express an endogenous TXA2Rα (20Becker K.P. Ullian M. Halushka P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 27: 109-114Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting that these cells have the intracellular signaling pathway with which to transduce a response to isoprostane and therefore constitute a relevant model system for this study. Determination of expression of Myc-His-tagged TXA2Rβ in COS-7 cells was performed by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). No detectable level of endogenous TXA2Rβ-Myc-His was observed in the nontransfected cell lysate (Fig. 1A, lane 1). In contrast, monoclonal antibody was able to detect TXA2Rβ-Myc-His in the transiently transfected cell lysate (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Interestingly, the addition of H2O2 (10 μm, 40 min) increased the quantity of TXA2Rβ-Myc-His detected in the cell lysate (35 ± 5% increase, n = 3; Fig. 1A, lane 3). The observed increase in TXA2Rβ-Myc-His quantity present in the cell lysate after H2O2 treatment suggests that the receptor stabilization may occur rapidly after oxidative stress, similarly to that found in vivo. Further, TXA2Rβ wild type was visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy using rabbit anti-TXA2Rβ C-terminal antibody and anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that in permeabilized cells, TXA2Rβ wild type was distributed throughout the cell, mainly on a reticular network, suggesting an ER localization (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether oxidative stress could induce some morphology modifications, the cells were observed under electron microscopy before (Fig. 2A) and after oxidative stress (Fig. 2B). No gross modification to the morphology of the cell was observed by thin section electron microscopy, following H2O2 treatment under the conditions used here.Fig. 2Electron microscopy. To determine whether oxidative stress induces major morphology modifications, COS-7 cells were observed under thin section electron microscopy before (A) and after oxidative stress (B). No gross modification to the morphology of the cells was observed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Intracellular Localization of TXA2Rβ Is Not a Consequence of the Transient Expression—To investigate whether the intracellular localization of TXA2Rβ was a consequence of the expression system, we transfected TXA2Rβ into an inducible mammalian expression system. Using the inducible mammalian expression vector (pEGSH vector) containing TXA2Rβ, we transiently transfected pERV3 CHO stable cells in the presence of different concentrations of the inducer, ponasterone A (0-10 μm). Western blot analysis revealed that interaction between the inducer and the ligand-binding domain of the pEGSH vector induced a dose-responsive expression of TXA2Rβ (Fig. 3A, first six lanes). Control (homogenate of transiently transfected COS-7 cells; Fig. 3A, seventh lane) indicated a similar level of expression to that in pERV3 CHO cells in presence of 8 μm of ponasterone A (Fig. 3A, fifth and seventh lanes). To investigate the intracellular localization of TXA2Rβ at low level of expression, transiently transfected cells were maintained in presence of ponasterone A (2 μm) and visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3B). The nuclei were stained in blue, and TXA2Rβ was stained in red. TXA2Rβ-Myc-His was distributed throughout the cell, mainly on a reticular network, suggesting an ER localization. This localization, which is consistent with the ER, was obtained even with the minimal detectable level of receptor (see the increased signal gain in Fig. 3B, inset). A similar ER localization was also observed in the stably transfected COS-7 cells line (Fig. 4A) or in transiently transfected HCASMc (Fig. 4B) that endogenously express this receptor (21Morinelli T.A. Zhang L.M. Newman W.H. Meier K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5693-5698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that the ER localization of TXA2Rβ is not a consequence of the artificial expression system.Fig. 4TXA2Rβ expression in COS-7 stable cell line and in HCASMc. COS-7 cells were stably transfected with TXA2Rβ-Myc-His and visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy (A). The nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue), and TXA2Rβ was stained with anti-Myc Cy3 conjugate (red). A perinuclear and reticular network localization was observed, which is consistent with the ER localization described above (Figs. 1 and 3). HCASMc were transiently transfected and visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy (B). The nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue), and TXA2Rβ was stained with anti-Myc fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (green). Similar ER localization of the receptor was observed (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Oxidative Stress Is Involved in the Intracellular Translocation of TXA2Rβ—To determine more precisely the subcellular localization of TXA2Rβ, transiently transfected COS-7 cells were fractionated on nonlinear Nycodenz gradients, using a method previously developed to provide effective separation of ER and Golgi complex proteins (19Rickwood D. Ford T. Graham J. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 123: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, in the absence of oxidative stress, the main proportion of c-Myc immunoreactivity sedimented to the bottom of the gradient, co-sedimenting with calnexin, a well established ER marker. In contrast, in the presence of H2O2 (10 μm, 40 min), sedimentation of a proportion of TXA2Rβ was shifted to a lighter fraction, co-sedimenting with β-COP, a Golgi complex marker (Fig. 5). This observation suggests that upon H2O2 treatment a proportion of the TXA2Rβ is translocated to a post-ER compartment. To confirm this observation, TXA2Rβ was localized by confocal fluorescence microscopy. At steady state, confocal microscopy showed that a large proportion of TXA2Rβ was localized to the ER (Fig. 6A), and no significant co-localization between TXA2Rβ and Golgin-97, a resident Golgi membrane protein, was apparent. In contrast, the addition of H2O2 evoked an intracellular translocation of the TXA2Rβ from the ER to the Golgi complex inducing a partial co-localization with Golgin-97 (Fig. 6B, yellow). These results are consistent with the previous observations based on subcellular fractionation suggesting a rapid translocation of the receptor to a post-ER compartment. Oxidative Stress Is Involved in the Stabilization of the TXA2Rβ—To determine the role of H2O2 in the biogenesis of TXA2Rβ, we used kinetic analysis. At 24 h post-transfection, cycloheximide was used to abolish protein synthesis; TXA2Rβ was chased for different time periods, before Western blot analysis. Fig. 7A shows that in the absence of H2O2, TXA2Rβ is more rapidly degraded than in the presence of H2O2. After 5 h, TXA2Rβ decreased by 80 ± 5% (n = 3). In contrast, in the presence of H2O2, TXA2Rβ degradation occurred less rapidly, and only 25 ± 5% of TXA2Rβ was degraded after 5 h (n = 3), suggesting that oxidative stress is able to mediate TXA2Rβ stabilization. This is consistent with the observation in Fig. 1A where H2O2 treatment increased the amount of TXA2Rβ detected. One of the effects of H2O2 on the TXA2Rβ is an increase of the proportion of the TXA2Rβ in the Golgi complex. We attempted to determine whether the Golgi complex localization had a role in TXA2Rβ stabilization. Identical TXA2Rβ kinetic experiments to those described above were performed in the presence of brefeldin A (Fig. 7B). BFA treatment abolished the TXA2Rβ stabilization induced by the H2O2 (93 ± 5% of degradation after 5 h in presence of BFA versus 25 ± 5% in the absence of BFA), without affecting the basal level of TXA2Rβ (Fig. 7B). Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that in quiescent cells, TXA2Rβ was located mainly in the ER compartment (Fig. 8A). Oxidative stress induced a translocation to the Golgi complex area with an ER staining below the detection limit (Fig. 8B). This translocation is partially abol"

Thyroid neoplasms have low proliferative index, low apoptotic index and a high incidence of metastasis. TGF-beta is overexpressed in thyroid follicular tumor cells. To investigate the role of TGF-beta in thyroid tumor progression, we established cultures of human thyrocytes from different proliferative pathologies (Grave's disease, multinodular goiter, follicular adenoma, papillary carcinoma), lymph node metastasis, and a normal thyroid sample. All cultures maintained the thyrocyte phenotype. TGF-beta induced cell-cycle arrest in all cultures, in contrast with results reported for other epithelial tumors. In deprived medium, TGF-beta induced apoptosis in normal thyrocyte cultures and all neoplastic cultures except the metastatic cultures. This apoptosis was mediated by a reduction in p27kip1 levels, inducing cell-cycle initiation. Antisense p27 expression induced apoptosis in the absence of TGF-beta. By contrast, in cells in which p27 was overexpressed, TGF-beta had a survival effect. In growth medium, a net survival effect occurs in neoplastic thyrocytes only, not normal thyrocytes, due to activation of the NF-kappaB survival program. Together, these findings suggest that (a) thyroid neoplasms are due to reduced apoptosis, not increased division, in line with the low proliferative index of these pathologies, and (b) TGF-beta induces apoptosis in normal thyrocytes via p27 reduction, but that in neoplastic thyrocytes this effect is overridden by activation of the NF-kappaB program."

Although mechanisms of ligand binding have been directly explored for those receptors, current knowledge of the molecular basis of calcitonin binding to its receptor is based only on receptor mutagenesis. In this work we have utilized the more direct approach of photoaffinity labeling to explore spatial approximations between distinct residues within calcitonin and its receptor. For this we have developed two human calcitonin analogues incorporating a photolabile p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine residue in the mid-region and carboxyl-terminal half of the peptide in positions 16 and 26, respectively. Both probes specifically bound to the human calcitonin receptor with high affinity and were potent stimulants of cAMP accumulation in calcitonin receptor-bearing human embryonic kidney 293 cells. They covalently labeled the calcitonin receptor in a saturable and specific manner. Further purification, deglycosylation, specific chemical and enzymatic cleavage, and sequencing of labeled wild type and mutant calcitonin receptors identified the sites of labeling for the position 16 and 26 probes as receptor residues Phe137 and Thr30, respectively. Both were within the extracellular amino terminus of the calcitonin receptor, with the former adjacent to the first transmembrane segment and the latter within the distal amino-terminal tail of the receptor.

Calcitonin, a hypocalcemic peptide hormone, is secreted from the thyroid gland in response to elevations in serum calcium levels. Its hypocalcemic effect is mediated by inhibition of bone resorption by osteoclasts and enhancement of renal calcium excretion. These actions are important for its widespread clinical use for treatment of bone disorders, including Paget's disease, osteoporosis, and hypercalcemia of malignancy (1.Sexton P.M. Findlay D.M.

The calcitonin peptide consists of 32 amino acids, with a disulfide bond between residues 1 and 7 which is conserved among all species and that is believed to be critical for its agonist activity. The amino acid sequence and biological potency of calcitonin vary considerably from species to species, but the integrity of the disulfide bond and the carboxyl-terminal proline-amide are necessary for full biological activity (1.Sexton P.M. Findlay D.M. Martin T.J. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 1067-1093PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Purdue B.W. Tilakaratne N. Sexton P.M.

The disulfide bond can be replaced by other covalent bonds that lead to improved biological stability while retaining full potency (1.Sexton P.M. Findlay D.M. Martin T.J. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 1067-1093PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence within the amino-terminal loop region is highly conserved in a variety of species but demonstrates divergence in the rest of the sequence (4.Pondel M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2000; 81: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Like secretin and peptides for other members of class B G protein-coupled receptor family, the amino-terminal region of calcitonin contains key determinants for receptor agonist selectivity, whereas the carboxyl-terminal region contains determinants for high affinity binding. Progressive truncation of residues in the disulfide bond-looped domain leads first to partial and then to antagonist peptides (1.Sexton P.M. Findlay D.M. Martin T.J. Curr. Med.

It shares ∼30% identity with the secretin receptor and 32% with the PTH 1 receptor. The human calcitonin receptor has three isoforms resulting from alternative mRNA splicing. Isoform I has 490 amino acids, including a 22-residue signal sequence and a 16-residue insert in the predicted first intracellular loop domain (residue 175–190) that is absent in isoforms II and III. Apart from this 16-amino acid insert, isoform III also has the first 47 residues missing at the receptor amino terminus. Knowledge of the molecular basis of ligand binding is important for structure-based drug design. At the present time, our understanding of the mechanism of calcitonin binding to its receptor is based predominantly on limited chimeric receptor studies (8.Bergwitz C. Gardella T.J. Flannery M.R.

For this we have developed two photolabile radioiodinatable agonist probes by incorporating a photolabile residue, p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa), into the mid-region of the human calcitonin peptide in position 16 and into the carboxyl-terminal half of the ligand in position 26. Both probes bound to the human calcitonin receptor specifically and with high affinity and efficiently covalently labeled the receptor. By sequential targeted enzymatic and chemical fragmentation reactions, the ligand binding region for the position 16 probe was localized to a domain within the amino terminus of its receptor adjacent to the first transmembrane domain, whereas that for the position 26 probe was localized within the distal amino terminus of the receptor. Using radiochemical Edman degradation sequencing, the specific residues labeled by these probes were identified as Phe137 and Thr30, respectively. These represent the first experimentally derived residue-residue approximations between calcitonin-like agonists and this receptor and should be very helpful for docking this ligand in a molecular model. Materials—Human calcitonin was purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Cyanogen bromide (CNBr) and solid phase oxidant N-chlorobenzenesulfonamide (IODO-BEAD) were purchased from Pierce. Endoproteinase Lys-C was from Calbiochem. Endoproteinase F (Endo F) was produced in our laboratory (18.Pearson R.K. Miller L.J. Hadac E.M. Powers S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13850-13856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other reagents were analytical grade. Peptide Synthesis—The probes, human (Ile8,Bpa16,Arg18)calcitonin (Bpa16 analogue or probe) and (Ile8,Arg18,Bpa26)calcitonin (Bpa26 analogue or probe), were designed to contain a photolabile Bpa in position 16 or 26, respectively, for covalent labeling of the calcitonin receptor. Both probes contained a naturally occurring Tyr residue in position 12 as the site for radioiodination and an Ile residue in the position of Met8 to eliminate a site for potential oxidative damage during radiolabeling. Additionally, Lys18 was replaced with an Arg to facilitate the specific digestion of the labeled receptor without the cleavage of the probes themselves (Fig. 1). These changes were demonstrated to be well tolerated without resulting in substantial loss of biological activity of the ligand (19.Suva L.J. Flannery M.S. Caulfield M.P. Findlay D.M. Juppner H. Goldring S.R. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 876-884PubMed Google Scholar). Both probes were synthesized by manual solid-phase techniques and purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase HPLC using techniques that were previously described (20.Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The expected molecular masses of the probes were verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Radioiodination—Fifteen μg of the synthetic probes ((Ile8,Bpa16, Arg18)calcitonin or (Ile8,Arg18,Bpa26)calcitonin) were radioiodinated oxidatively with Na125I upon exposure to an IODO-BEAD for 15 s and purified by reversed-phase HPLC to yield specific radioactivities of 2000 Ci/mmol (20.Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the same way radioiodination of the natural human calcitonin was performed to produce a radioligand for calcitonin receptor binding. Receptor Preparations—The receptor-bearing human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell line stably expressing the human calcitonin isoform II receptor (HEK293-CTR) was provided by GlaxoSmithKline and was used as the source of receptors for the current study. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment on Falcon tissue culture plasticware in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal clone-2 (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Cells were passaged twice a week and lifted mechanically before use. Development of new calcitonin receptor mutants was necessary for the current study. One of these incorporated an additional site for CNBr cleavage in a key position for localization of the site of labeling for the Bpa26 probe. This represented mutation of Ser27 of the calcitonin receptor to Met (S27M). A triple-mutant calcitonin receptor construct was developed to introduce a new CNBr cleavage site while simultaneously eliminating a pair of naturally occurring Met residues, representing Ser27 to Met, Met48 to Ile, and Met49 to Ile (S27M/M48I/M49I) receptor mutant. This was used for radiochemical sequencing to identify the site of labeling with the Bpa26 probe. In addition, two more calcitonin receptor constructs were generated that included Phe137 to Ala (F137A) and Thr30 to Ala (T30A), each representing mutation of the site of labeling by the Bpa16 and Bpa26 probes, respectively. All above constructs were prepared using an oligonucleotide-directed approach with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). They were subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), and their sequences were verified by direct DNA sequencing (21.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). All mutant calcitonin receptor constructs were expressed transiently in COS cells (American Type Cell Collection, Manassas, VA) after transfection using a modification of the DEAE-dextran method (22.Holtmann M.H. Ganguli S. Hadac E.M. Dolu V. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14944-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These cells were harvested mechanically 72 h after transfection. Receptor-enriched plasma membranes were prepared from the above stable HEK293 cell line and transiently transfected COS cells using methods that we previously reported (23.Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Ligand Binding—Receptor binding of calcitonin, the Bpa16 analogue, and the Bpa26 analogue was characterized in a standard assay using membranes from the HEK293-CTR cell line. Membranes (∼10 μg) were incubated with a constant amount of radioligand, 125I-calcitonin (3–5 pm), in the presence of increasing concentrations of non-radiolabeled calcitonin or the Bpa16 analogue or the Bpa26 analogue (0–1 μm) for 1 h at room temperature in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES medium (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Bound and free radioligand were separated using a Skatron cell harvester (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with glass fiber filtermats that had been soaked in 0.3% Polybrene for 1 h, and bound radioactivity was quantified in a γ-spectrometer. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm calcitonin and represented <20% of total binding. Biological Activity Assay—The agonist activities of the Bpa16 and Bpa26 analogues were studied for stimulation of cAMP in the HEK293-CTR cells using a competition binding assay (Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA). Cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of calcitonin or the Bpa16 or Bpa26 analogue at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reactions were stopped by adding ice-cold perchloric acid. After adjusting the pH to 6 with KHCO3, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were used in the assay as previously described (24.Ganguli S.C. Park C.G. Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Kenakin T.P. Miller L.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 593-598PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting in a Beckman LS6000. Photoaffinity Labeling Studies—For covalent labeling studies, plasma membranes from receptor-bearing HEK293-CTR cells containing ∼50 μg of protein were incubated with ∼0.1 nm125I-(Ile8,Bpa16,Arg18)calcitonin or 125I-(Ile8,Arg18,Bpa26)calcitonin in the presence of increasing concentrations of calcitonin (0–1 μm) for 1 h at room temperature before photolysis for 30 min at 4 °C in a Rayonet photochemical reactor (Southern New England Ultraviolet, Hamden, CT) equipped with 3500-Å lamps. To scale up receptor purification, a larger amount of membranes (∼150–200 μg) was incubated with each radiolabeled probe (∼0.5 nm) in the absence of competing calcitonin. After photolysis, membranes were washed, pelleted, solubilized in SDS sample buffer, and applied to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis (25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled bands were detected by autoradiography. Peptide Mapping—Radioactive receptor bands were cut out from the gel and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer in water followed by lyophilization and ethanol precipitation. Purified materials were used for chemical or enzymatic cleavage experiments. CNBr and endoproteinase Lys-C were used to separately or sequentially cleave the labeled receptor using procedures previously described (16.Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The products of cleavage were resolved on 10% NuPAGE gels using MES running buffer (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, labeled bands were identified by exposure to x-ray film with intensifying screens at -80 °C. Aliquots of affinity-labeled receptor and relevant receptor fragments were deglycosylated with endoglycosidase F, as described previously (23.Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Radiochemical Sequencing—For this, the purified fragment from CNBr cleavage of the wild type human calcitonin receptor labeled with the Bpa16 or from cleavage of the S27M/M48I/M49I mutant receptor labeled with the Bpa26 probe was coupled to N-(2-aminoethyl-1)-3-aminopropyl glass beads (Sigma) through the sulfhydryl side chain of Cys residues. Cycles of Edman degradation were repeated manually in a manner that has been previously reported in detail (26.Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z. Holicky E.L. Henne R.M. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12988-12993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and the radioactivity released in each cycle was quantified in a γ-spectrometer. Statistical Analysis—All observations were repeated at least three times in independent experiments and are expressed as the means ± S.E. Binding curves were analyzed and plotted using the nonlinear regression analysis routine for radioligand binding in the Prism software package (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Binding kinetics was determined by analysis with the LIGAND program of Munson and Rodbard (27.Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Characterization of Photolabile Calcitonin Probes—Both the Bpa16 and Bpa26 probes were synthesized by manual solid phase techniques and purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and their identities were verified by mass spectrometry. They both bound saturably and specifically to calcitonin receptor-bearing HEK293-CTR membranes. As shown in Fig. 2, the Bpa16 probe bound to its receptor with similar affinity to that of natural calcitonin (calcitonin, Ki = 83 ± 6 pm; Bpa16 probe, Ki = 168 ± 18 pm), whereas the Bpa26 probe had affinity more than an order of magnitude lower (Ki = 3.1 ± 0.3 nm). They both represented full agonists, simulating cAMP accumulation in HEK293-CTR cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with the Bpa16 probe having higher potency than the Bpa26 probe (calcitonin, EC50 = 30 ± 7 pm; Bpa16 probe, EC50 = 28 ± 6 pm; Bpa26 probe, EC50 = 97 ± 14 pm; Fig. 2). Photoaffinity Labeling of the Calcitonin Receptor—Both the Bpa16 and Bpa26 probes were used to explore their ability to covalently label the calcitonin receptor. As shown in Fig. 3, they labeled the calcitonin receptor specifically and saturably. The protein band labeled with each probe migrated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel at approximate Mr = 97,000 that shifted to Mr = 52,000 after deglycosylation with endoglycosidase F. The differential migration of the labeled glycosylated receptor from earlier studies may relate to species differences and/or to different degrees of receptor glycosylation in distinct cell lines used (19.Suva L.J.

As expected, the labeling was inhibited by increasing concentrations of calcitonin (Bpa16 probe, IC50 = 81 ± 9 nm; Bpa26 probe, IC50 = 5.0 ± 1.2 nm). No radioactive band was present in the affinity-labeled non-receptor bearing HEK293 cell membranes. Identification of Domains of Labeling by Peptide Mapping—We have successfully used CNBr for identification of ligand binding sites of the cholecystokinin receptor (26.Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z.

Here again, we used CNBr as the first indication of domain of labeling for the calcitonin receptor. Theoretically, CNBr cleavage of the calcitonin receptor would yield 16 fragments ranging in molecular mass from 0.1 to 11 kDa, with 2 of the fragments also containing potential sites of N-linked glycosylation (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, CNBr cleavage of the calcitonin receptor labeled with the Bpa16 probe resulted in a band that migrated on a 10% NuPAGE gel at approximate Mr = 9,500 and did not further shift after deglycosylation with endoglycosidase F. Given the molecular mass of the radioiodinated Bpa16 probe (3657 Da) and the absence of glycosylation, there was only one candidate fragment matching these data. This represents the fragment spanning the amino terminus, the first transmembrane domain, the first intracellular loop, and the second transmembrane domain (Cys134-Met187, molecular mass = 6138 Da). As also shown in Fig. 4, CNBr cleavage of the calcitonin receptor labeled with the Bpa26 probe yielded a band migrating at approximate Mr = 20,000 and shifted to approximate Mr = 6,500 after deglycosylation. Taking into account the molecular mass of the radioiodinated Bpa26 probe (3732 Da) and clear evidence of glycosylation, the first CNBr fragment at the distal amino terminus of the calcitonin receptor is the only candidate that matches these data. Endoproteinase Lys-C, which specifically cleaves at Lys residues, was used either separately or sequentially with CNBr to further refine the labeled receptor domain for the Bpa16 probe. As shown in Fig. 5, endoproteinase Lys-C cleavage of the intact calcitonin receptor labeled with the Bpa16 probe yielded a glycosylated fragment band (Mr = 26,000, top right panel, third lane) that migrated at approximate Mr = 5,500 (top right panel, fourth lane) after deglycosylation. This represents the fragment His121-Lys141. Taken together with the above CNBr data, the labeling domain for the Bpa16 probe was now narrowed to the segment Cys134-Lys141. This conclusion was further supported by endoproteinase Lys-C cleavage of the labeled Mr = 9,500 fragment resulting from the CNBr digestion of the labeled intact calcitonin receptor (Figs. 4 and 5). This sequential digestion yielded a labeled fragment that migrated at approximate Mr = 4,500 (Fig. 5, top right panel, second lane, the labeled segment Cys134-Lys141). Endoproteinase Lys-C was also used sequentially with CNBr to refine the labeled receptor domain for the Bpa26 probe. As also shown in Fig. 5 (bottom right panel), endoproteinase Lys-C cleavage of the labeled Mr = 20,000 fragment resulting from CNBr digestion of the labeled intact calcitonin receptor yielded a radioactive band migrating on a 10% NuPAGE gel at approximate Mr = 19,000 (Fig. 5, bottom right panel, fourth lane). Moreover, endoproteinase Lys-C cleavage of the deglycosylated Mr = 6,500 CNBr fragment (Fig. 5, bottom right panel, second lane) from the intact calcitonin receptor labeled with the Bpa26 probe yielded a radioactive band shifting to approximate Mr = 5,500 (Fig. 5, bottom right panel, third lane). These data, suggesting that the 22-amino acid signal sequence was cleaved in the mature calcitonin receptor, clearly demonstrate that the first endoproteinase Lys-C fragment Leu23-Lys37 at the distal amino terminus of the calcitonin receptor represented the domain of labeling for the Bpa26 probe. To further refine the region of labeling for the Bpa26 probe, a receptor mutant was developed to introduce an additional site for CNBr cleavage, representing the Ser27 to Met (S27M) calcitonin receptor mutant, and was transiently expressed in COS cells. The S27M construct bound calcitonin with high affinity (Ki = 4.0 ± 1.1 nm) and had a normal cAMP response to calcitonin (EC50 = 96 ± 15 pm). It was also labeled by the Bpa26 probe saturably and specifically (Fig. 6, left panel). CNBr cleavage of the labeled S27M receptor construct resulted in a band migrating at approximate Mr = 19,500, migrating slightly faster than the labeled glycosylated Mr = 20,000 band from CNBr cleavage of the labeled wild type receptor (Fig. 6, middle panel). After deglycosylation, the Mr = 6,500 CNBr fragment from the labeled wild type receptor (Fig. 6, right panel, second lane) shifted to approximate Mr = 6,000 in the labeled S27M receptor construct (Fig. 6, right panel, first lane). Together with the above data from the endoproteinase Lys-C cle"
https://openalex.org/W2140529820,"The p19ARF gene product responds to oncogenic stresses by interfering with the inhibitory effects of Mdm2 on p53, thus enhancing p53 activity and its antiproliferative functions. The absence of p19ARF in the mouse leads to early tumor susceptibility, presumably in part due to decreased p53 activity. To examine the tumorigenic cooperativity of p19ARF, Mdm2, and p53 in vivo, p19ARF-deficient mice were crossed first to p53-deficient mice and then to Mdm2 transgenic mice. The progeny were monitored for tumors. Cooperativity between p19ARF and p53 deficiencies in accelerating tumor formation was observed for most genotypes except p53-/- p19ARF-/- mice. p53-/- p19ARF-/- mice had a tumor incidence similar to p53-/- mice. In this context, tumor suppression by ARF appears to be primarily p53 dependent. The majority of the p19ARF+/- tumors deleted the wildtype p19ARF allele, in agreement with the previous studies, suggesting that p19ARF is a classic 'two hit' tumor suppressor. In a p53+/- background, however, all p19ARF+/- tumors retained a wildtype ARF allele and most also retained wildtype p53. In the second cross between p19ARF-deficient and Mdm2 transgenic mice, cooperativity in tumor incidence between Mdm2 overexpression and ARF deficiency was observed, consistent with the role of p19ARF in negatively regulating Mdm2 activity. These experiments further demonstrate in vivo the inter-relationships of the p19ARF-Mdm2-p53 signaling axis in tumor suppression."

Its mechanistic function is the stabilization of carbanions adjacent to amino groups. This cofactor therefore plays a key role in amino acid metabolism; PLP-containing enzymes catalyze racemization, decarboxylation, transamination, and side-chain substitution reactions of amino acids. PLP is biosynthesized in bacteria, fungi, and plants, but it is an essential nutrient in animals (1.Drewke C. Leistner E. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 61: 121-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was clear from studies involving the incorporation of isotopically labeled PLP precursors that the PLP biosynthetic pathway in eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae is different from the well studied Escherichia coli pathway (Fig. 1). In E. coli, PLP is biosynthesized from d-erythrose-4-phosphate, deoxy-d-xylulose-5 phosphate, and glutamate (2.Tazuya K. Adachi Y. Masuda K. Yamada K. Kumaoka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas in yeast, it is biosynthesized from an unidentified pentulose or pentose, glyceraldehyde, and glutamine (3.Zeidler J.

All of the genes required for PLP biosynthesis in E. coli have now been identified, the biosynthesis has been fully reconstituted in vitro, and the structures of three of the biosynthetic enzymes have been determined (6.Cane D.E. Chimia. 2003; 57: 75-76Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, PLP biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae has not yet been reconstituted in a cell-free system, and the genes involved in the pyridine ring formation have only recently been identified (7.Antelmann H.

Extensive phylogenetic analysis revealed that PLP biosynthesis, by what was considered previously to be the eukaryotic pathway, is widespread, and this pathway has now been found in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and in the archaebacteria (15.Mittenhuber G. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 1-20PubMed Google Scholar). YaaD and YaaE have been identified as the PLP biosynthetic enzymes in Bacillus subtilis (16.Sakai A. Kita M. Katsuragi T. Ogasawara N. Tani Y. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2002; 93: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). YaaD revealed no homology with any known enzyme class. However, YaaE shows high sequence similarity to glutamine aminotransferase, suggesting that this protein is involved in the hydrolysis of the amide of glutamine, releasing ammonia for incorporation into the pyridine ring in a reaction likely catalyzed by YaaD. We report here the crystal structure of the B. subtilis YaaE at 2.5-Å resolution. A comparison of this structure with that of other glutaminases revealed a high structural similarity to the histidine biosynthetic protein HisH from Thermotoga maratima (17.Douangamath A. Walker M. Beismann-Driemeyer S. Vega-Fernandez M.C. Sterner R. Wilmanns M. Structure. 2002; 10: 185-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We also report a homology model of YaaD and propose a model for the YaaD-YaaE complex. Molecular Cloning—Standard methods were used for DNA restriction endonuclease digestion, ligation, and transformation of DNA (18.Sambrook J. Fritsch G.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Guide. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.1-8.8013.1–14.30Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was purified with the Wizard™ Plus SV DNA miniprep kit (Promega). DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and then excised and purified with the QiaQuick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). E. coli strain DH5α was used as a recipient for transformations during plasmid construction and for plasmid propagation and storage. A PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp PCR System 2400 and Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) were used for PCR. The plasmid pET-28a was obtained from Novagen. Sequencing was performed at the Cornell BioResources Center. Genomic DNA from B. subtilis CU1065 was used as a template for the PCR amplification of yaaE using 5′-AGG AGC GCT GCT CAT ATG TTA ACA ATA GGT GTA CTA GG-3′ (inserts an NdeI site (underlined) at the start codon) and 5′-CTA TCA ACG CTT CTC GAG CTT TAT TTG TGC TTA TAA TG-3′ (inserts an XhoI site (underlined) after the stop codon) as the primer pair. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into similarly digested pET-28a to give pCLK1501. All PCR-derived DNA was sequenced to ensure that no mutations had been introduced in the cloning process. Expression and Purification of YaaE—For protein purification, the expression construct was transformed into E. coli B834(DE3) cells (Novagen), which are auxotrophic for methionine. One liter of Luria-Bertani medium containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin was inoculated with 5 ml of saturated starter culture and incubated at 37 °C. When the culture reached an A595 of ∼0.6, the cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h at 25 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 25 ml of cold extraction buffer (10 mm imidazole, 50 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). All subsequent protein purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were lysed by two passes through a French pressure cell at 15,000 p.s.i., and the insoluble cell debris was removed by high speed centrifugation. The clarified cell extract was mixed with a 3-ml slurry of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), which was pre-equilibrated in extraction buffer, and gently stirred for 1 h. The resin was centrifuged for 15 min at low speed, and the supernatant was decanted. The resin was resuspended in the extraction buffer and poured onto a nickel column. The column was thoroughly washed with the extraction buffer. The His-tagged protein was then eluted with 130 mm imidazole, 50 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. The eluted enzyme was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and was concentrated to 5 mg/ml. Production of selenomethionine-labeled YaaE (SeMet-YaaE) follows the same protocol as above with the following modifications. The cells were grown in 1 liter of cultures containing M9 minimal medium supplemented with 40 μg/ml l-amino acids (excluding methionine), 1% BME vitamin solution (Invitrogen), 0.4% (w/v) glucose, 2 mm MgSO4, 25 μg/ml FeSO4·7H2O, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 25 μg/liter kanamycin, and 50 μg/liter l-selenomethionine. This medium was inoculated with a 1:20 dilution of cells from a 50-ml starter culture containing the above medium but with l-methionine in place of l-selenomethionine to encourage growth. Prior to inoculation, the starter cells were pelleted and washed with the induction culture to remove the l-methionine. Purification of the labeled enzyme then proceeded as for the native protein. Crystallization of YaaE—The optimized conditions for both the native and the selenomethionine-labeled proteins were found to be 10–12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol-8000, 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.0–7.2, 6% (v/v) ethylene glycol, and a protein concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. Crystals of SeMet-YaaE also grew in the presence of 2 mm dithiothreitol. The crystals were grown at 18 °C using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique. Drops (8 μl) containing a 1:1 mixture of protein and reservoir solutions were optimal for crystal growth. Crystals of diffraction quality grew over a period of 1–2 weeks. YaaE crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 45.50 Å, b = 80.87 Å, and c = 115.39 Å. Each asymmetric unit contains two monomers corresponding to a calculated solvent content of 50%. Data Collection and Processing—Initially, a single-wavelength anomalous diffraction data set was collected on a single frozen SeMet-YaaE crystal at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) beamline F2. A cryoprotectant solution of 18% ethylene glycol in the mother liquor was used to prevent damage during freezing. An x-ray absorption spectrum in the vicinity of the selenium absorption edge was determined for the SeMet-YaaE crystal by recording x-ray fluorescence as a function of wavelength. Diffraction data were then collected to 2.85 Å at the wavelength corresponding to the peak of this spectrum (0.979 Å). The data were measured in 0.5° oscillation steps with 2.5-min exposure times using a Quantum-4 CCD detector (San Diego Area Detector Systems Corp.) with a crystal-to-detector distance of 180 mm. A total of 90° of data was collected. These data were processed with DENZO and scaled using SCALEPACK (19.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38501) Google Scholar). A three-wavelength MAD data set was collected on a single frozen SeMet-YaaE crystal on the 8-BM beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). An x-ray fluorescence spectrum was again determined, and diffraction data were collected to 2.5-Å resolution at wavelengths corresponding to the inflection point of the spectrum (0.9796 Å), the peak of the spectrum (0.9794 Å), and a high energy remote (0.9642 Å). The data were measured in 1° oscillation steps with 15-s exposure times using a Quantum-315 CCD detector (San Diego Area Detector Systems Corp.) with a crystal-to-detector distance of 350 mm. A total of 100° of data was collected for each wavelength. The data were processed with MOSFLM (20.Leslie A.G.W. MOSFLM. Version 6.2.2, Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK1997Google Scholar) and scaled using SCALA (21.Evans P.R. SCALA.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—The selenium atom positions were determined from the CHESS data using the Patterson search routine of CNS 1.0 (22.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16954) Google Scholar). The MAD phasing component of CNS was used to calculate the initial phases and density modification (22.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16954) Google Scholar). Symmetry averaging was attempted using a matrix generated by PROFESSS (23.Collaborative Computational Project-Number 4.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19742) Google Scholar); the resulting electron density map was, unfortunately, uninterpretable. An interpretable map was calculated from the three-wavelength MAD data set collected at APS and from the selenium sites from the single wavelength CHESS data set using CNS. Electron density visualization and model building were done with O (24.Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). Simulated annealing torsion angle refinement was followed by group B-factor refinement and energy minimization and performed using CNS. Several rounds of refinement were combined with model rebuilding in O after inspection of both 2Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc maps. The refinement was carried out using the peak wavelength of the MAD data set. In verifying the final model, a simulated annealing composite omit map was calculated, and the B-factors were refined individually. Water molecules were initially picked using CNS and then manually verified in O.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3874) Google Scholar) were used to produce the figures. YaaD-YaaE Complex Modeling—Templates for a homology model of B. subtilis YaaD were identified using 3D-PSSM (27.Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) and a sequence search of the Protein Data Bank (28.Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27213) Google Scholar). The initial list of nine candidate β-barrel structures was reduced to five (PDB codes 1GPW, 1JVN, 1DVJ, 1PII, and 2TPS) using the following biases: (a) favor structural diversity as indicated by root mean square deviation from other structures, (b) favor higher resolution structures, and (c) favor structures that bind ligands most similar to PLP. The highest sequence identity with YaaD was 20% for PDB code 1GPW. The β-barrel domains of the templates were structurally superimposed on PDB code 2TPS using CE (29.Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar), and a ClustalX (30.Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4876-4882Crossref Scopus (35373) Google Scholar) alignment with YaaD was manually adjusted based on the structural superposition. Predicted loop regions in YaaD were aligned only with loops of similar size in the template structures. Ten homology models were built using Modeler version 6 (31.Marti-Renom M.A. Yerkovich B.

Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10496) Google Scholar) with two cycles of very slow MD (molecular dynamics) annealing (MD_LEVEL = refine_4, LIBRARY_SCHEDULE = 2). A DALI (33.Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) search with the lowest energy model revealed no additional related structures. The three lowest energy YaaD models and the YaaE crystal structure were superimposed on the HisH-F structure from yeast (PDB code 1JVN) and the HisH-HisF complex from T. maritima (PDB code 1GPW) using ProFit (34.Martin A.C. ProFit, Version. 1.8. SciTech Software, London, England1998Google Scholar). Overlaps were resolved through a four-stage minimization using the OPLS-AA (35.Jorgenson W.L. Maxwell D.S. Tirado-Rives J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11225-11236Crossref Scopus (10581) Google Scholar) force field and GB/SA solvation model (36.Qiu D. Shenkin P.S. Hollinger F.P. Still W.C. J. Phys. Chem. A. 1997; 101: 3005-3014Crossref Scopus (920) Google Scholar) as implemented in version 7.2 of the program MacroModel (37.Mohamadi F. Richards N.G.J. Guida W.C. Liskamp R. Lipton M. Caufield C. Chang G. Hendrickson T. Still W.C. J. Comput. Chem. 1990; 11: 460-467Crossref Scopus (3929) Google Scholar). First, gross overlaps were corrected. Some residues were manually adjusted to remove knots, and the YaaE loop at residues 110–113, YaaE side chains within 2.5 Å of YaaD, and YaaD residues within 6 Å of YaaE were energy-minimized with all other atoms frozen. Second, hydrogen atoms were energy-minimized with all other atoms frozen. Third, the initial minimization was repeated but with all YaaD atoms permitted to move subject to a 100 kJ/mol-Å2 restraint. Due to software limitations, bond angle and torsion parameters were not applied to the restrained atoms in the initial minimizations, making it necessary to relieve some strained geometries through a final minimization. This fourth cycle included all force field parameters for restrained atoms, decreased the YaaD restraint to 10 kJ/mol-Å2, and allowed the previously frozen YaaE atoms to move subject to a 300 kJ/mol-Å2 restraint. Crystal Packing Analysis—The asymmetric unit contains two monomers (referred to hereafter as A and B). Superimposing the monomers reveals that residues 9–14, 45–60, 87–96, and 106–115 are in noticeably different conformations (Fig. 3a). These differences appear to be completely explainable in terms of crystal packing. An adjacent monomer packs against monomer A in such a way that the loop containing residues 9–14 is forced back against the helix containing residues 45–60, forcing this helix into a somewhat distorted position; no such packing constraint exists for monomer B, in which the loop containing residues 9–14 is permitted to move freely. Residues 9–14 were not visible in the initial MAD phasing map of monomer B and appeared only weakly in the later composite omit maps; residues 45–60 were visible in the initial map but were too disordered to be built until the later stages of refinement. In both monomer A and monomer B, the loop containing residues 87–96 is unconstrained and is somewhat disordered; even at the later stages of refinement, it was possible to build the main chain atoms only approximately. The majority of the residues in the generously allowed region of the Ramachandran plot are from these loops. These poorly ordered regions of the structure contain nearly 15% of the residues and are probably responsible for the slightly high crystallographic R-factor reported in Table II. The remaining residues in the generously allowed region are Cys-79 from both monomers; as detailed below, these residues serve as active site nucleophiles. Finally, the loop containing residues 106–115 is pushed into a slightly different position in monomer A as a result of the C-terminal helix of an adjacent monomer of A packing against this loop; this also had the effect of making the C-terminal residues of monomer A somewhat more ordered than those of monomer B. Overall Structure—YaaE is an α/β three-layer sandwich containing a seven-stranded twisted mixed parallel β-sheet flanked by six α-helices on the N-terminal stretch of the sheet, four on one side and two on the other. The first five strands in the sheet, β1-β4, β12, and the last strand, β10, share the same orientation, whereas β11, the next-to-last strand in the sheet, lies antiparallel to the rest. This type of mixed β-sheet appears to be common to the triad aminotransferases. A pair of antiparallel β-strands is located along the exposed edge of the central β-sheet. A mixed, three-stranded region of short β-strands flanks the other side of the central sheet. The α-helices lie close to the N-terminal edge of the central sheet, whereas the flanking β-strands lie at the C-terminal edge of the central sheet. These connections are illustrated in the topology diagram shown in Fig. 3b. The overall structure of YaaE is shown in Fig. 3c. The molecule folds as a single domain with approximate dimensions of 27 Å × 22 Å × 50 Å. YaaE adopts the form of a rough cylinder with a cleft between β4 and β12 and below a loop near the center of the upper face. At the bottom of this cleft lies a tight turn between β4 and α5, oriented in such a way that the side chain of Cys-79 protrudes into the center of the cavity. The side chain of His-170 lies 3.4 Å from the sulfur atom of Cys-79 and 2.7 Å from the carboxyl side chain of Glu-172 in an orientation suggesting a Glu-His-Cys catalytic triad. This, along with sequence and structural alignments of YaaE with known triad aminotransferases (38.Amuro N. Paluh J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14844-14849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Thoden J.B. Miran S.G. Phillips J.C. Howard A.J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8825-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), led us to designate this cleft as the active site. Active Site—The active site crevice lies below a two-strand stretch of antiparallel β-sheet. Cys-79 has (ϕ, ψ) values of (51.5, –132.2); average values for active site cysteines in triad aminotransferases are (50, –110). In keeping with the active sites of other aminotransferases, His-170 and Glu-172 are separated by Pro-171. Continuing with the analogy with other triad aminotransferases, we expected an oxyanion hole to be formed by the amide NH of Ala-80 and Gly-47; however, no water molecules were found bound in this location. Comparison with the structurally similar HisH from T. maritima leads us to suspect that in the absence of YaaD, the oxyanion hole is not well formed (17.Douangamath A. Walker M. Beismann-Driemeyer S. Vega-Fernandez M.C. Sterner R. Wilmanns M. Structure. 2002; 10: 185-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). By superimposing the active sites for the two monomers, it may be observed that three bound water molecules in the active site superimpose within 1 Å of their corresponding partner; two of these pairs are located in positions indicative of catalytic significance. One pair is located within hydrogen bonding distance of the histidine ring of His-170, the second is within hydrogen bonding distance of two backbone carbonyls (168 and 134) and one backbone amide (134 N) and appears to be positioned in such a way as to serve the function of nucleophile. When the active site residues of YaaE are superimposed with the active site residues of HisH from T. maritima (17.Douangamath A. Walker M. Beismann-Driemeyer S. Vega-Fernandez M.C. Sterner R.

Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8825-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), analogues for this water molecule superimpose within 1 Å of each other. Furthermore, in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and anthranilate synthase, this water molecule also lies within hydrogen bonding distance of the imidazole side chain of the catalytic histidine. A comparison of the structure of YaaE with those of other known protein structures using the DALI server returned the highest scores (Table III) for free HisH from T. maritima (17.Douangamath A. Walker M. Beismann-Driemeyer S. Vega-Fernandez M.C. Sterner R. Wilmanns M. Structure. 2002; 10: 185-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and the HisH subunit from the structure of HisH-F complex from S. cerevisae. HisH and the remaining entries in Table III are all triad aminotransferases or triad glutaminase domains of multifunctional proteins. A least squares superimposition of YaaE with each of these other proteins reveals that they all possess the same α/β structure with loops of various lengths and conformations; this motif has been designated as the triad aminotransferase fold (42.Tesmer J.J. Klem T.J Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Salient characteristics of this fold include a seven-stranded parallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices with the active site located at the C-terminal end of the sheet and below an overhanging loop. The active site cystine residue is generally near the 80th residue in the domain and lies on a nucleophilic elbow: a tight turn between a β-strand and an α-helix at the bottom of the active site. A least squares superimposition of the active sites using the catalytic triad and oxyanion hole residues reveals that the active site of YaaE is largely similar to that of the other aminotransferases; however, there are a few minor, but notable, differences. YaaE lacks a substrate-interacting glutamine present in the other aminotransferases. Additionally, a conserved histidine, which does not interact directly with the substrate, is absent in YaaE. In its place is a proline that serves to kink a loop into a somewhat different conformation in YaaE from the other glutaminases. Finally, YaaE has three arginine residues located above the active site, which the other glutaminases appear to lack. It is presently not possible to speculate on the functional significance, if any, of these differences. One additional point of similarity exists: a water molecule, located within 3.5 Å of the cysteine sulfur atom, is present in all glutaminases examined in Table III. When the active site residues are superimposed, these water molecules superimpose within 1 Å of each other. In every case, they are located in a position consistent with nucleophilic behavior and are anchored there by at least two hydrogen bonds; in two of the five cases examined, they are close enough to the catalytic histidine to hydrogen-bond to one of the nitrogen atoms of the imidazole ring.Table IIIComparison of YaaE with known protein structures using DALI (33.Holm L.

Open table in a new tab The active site residues of YaaE are shown in Fig. 4 superimposed upon the active site residues of yeast HisH with bound (αS,5S)-α-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid (acivicin) (40.Chaudhuri B.N. Lange S.C. Myers R.S. Chittur S.V. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Structure. 2001; 9: 987-997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This inhibitor functions by covalently modifying the nucleophilic sulfur of the active site cysteine. The superposition shows conservation of the catalytic triad (Cys-79-His-170-Glu-172); however, the only other conserved residue is Gly-47, which is believed to contribute to the oxyanion hole. In HisH, the α-amino group of the substrate is positioned to hydrogen-bond to Gln-87, whereas the carboxyl group interacts with the backbone nitrogen atoms of Ser-148 and Phe-149 and also forms a hydrogen bond to Gln-397. The superposition suggests that Arg-106, which is conserved in YaaE sequences, may play a role in substrate binding. If so, the α-amino and carboxyl groups of the substrate glutamine would be interchanged by rotation about the Cα-Cβ bond, keeping the terminal amide group near Cys-79. The water molecule shown is found in all triad glutaminase structures and is positioned for nucleophilic attack in the final step of product formation in which the glutamate-enzyme thioester intermediate is hydrolyzed to glutamate and free enzyme. As seen in Table III, the protein with the closest structural similarity to YaaE is the histidine biosynthesis protein HisH. HisH complexes with HisF to catalyze the reaction shown in Fig. 5. Secondary and tertiary structural prediction of YaaD using the SCOP (structural classification of proteins) data base (43.Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5584) Google Scholar) indicated that YaaD most likely folds in a (β/α)8 barrel motif. Since HisF is also a (β/α)8 fold and it complexes with HisH, which had the closest structural match to YaaE, it seemed as though a modeling study would reveal useful information. The lowest energy complex model is shown in Fig. 6.Fig. 6The complex model created using the crystal structure of YaaE and the lowest energy homology model of YaaD. In this model, YaaE binds to YaaD in much the same orientation as HisH binds to HisF. It can also bee seen that β-strands 7 and 8 appear to have some role in the association of YaaE and YaaD. YaaE binds to YaaD in much the same orientation as HisH binds to HisF. As with YaaE, HisH utilizes two β-strands in creating the protein-protein interface.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this model, YaaE binds to YaaD in the same general orientation as HisH binds to HisF: the active site of YaaE faces up into the N-terminal end of the YaaD model. The closest approach of YaaE to YaaD is where strands β7 and β8 pack against the N-terminal end of the β-barrel of YaaD. These strands contain three invariant phenylalanine residues that face in the direction of YaaD. The orientation of β8 appears to be due to an invariant Pro-137, which is also responsible for distorting one of the strands involved in the YaaE active site. The three invariant arginine residues that line the opening to the active site of YaaE are close enough to YaaD to presumably play some role in the interaction of YaaE with YaaD. One of the more interesting features of the HisH-F enzyme complex is the hydrophobic tunnel through the center of the β-barrel, finally delivering the ammonia to the HisF active site (17.Douangamath A. Walker M. Beismann-Driemeyer S. Vega-Fernandez M.C. Sterner R. Wilmanns M. Structure. 2002; 10: 185-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In modeling YaaD, we looked for a corresponding channel. In the YaaD model, a number of invariant residues were located in the barrel interior and in two adjacent loops, one between residues 212 and 218 and the other between residues 234 and 236 (Fig. 7). The region between these two loops corresponds to one of the phosphate binding sites of HisF and is predicted to be a phosphate binding site in YaaD based on sequence analysis. The remaining loops consist largely of unconserved residues. A number of hydrophobic residues were located in the core of the barrel, but a number of invariant polar or charged residues and two aromatic residues are also present near the interface. Calculating the accessible surface area using SPOCK (44.Christopher J.A. SPOCK. Texas A&M University, College Station, TX1998Google Scholar) does not unambiguously indicate either the presence or the absence of a channel large enough for NH3 to pass through. During the model construction, no attempt was made to place conserved residues at the C-terminal end of the barrel; however, it is known that the interface of the barrel is very highly conserved for HisH-F (17.Douangamath A. Walker M. Beismann-Driemeyer S. Vega-Fernandez M.C. Sterner R. Wilmanns M. Structure. 2002; 10: 185-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 40.Chaudhuri B.N. Lange S.C. Myers R.S. Chittur S.V. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Structure. 2001; 9: 987-997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and it would seem reasonable to expect similar conservation of the interface residues of YaaD-YaaE. In summary, the model of YaaD reported here allows us to identify possible active site residues, whereas the model of the YaaD-YaaE complex indicates that the two enzymes can bind in an orientation favorable toward channeling of the ammonia molecule. The existence of an ammonia channel through YaaD cannot be definitely inferred from the model because of ambiguities in side chain positions. However, the structural and functional similarities of YaaD-E and HisH-F strongly suggest ammonia channeling.

The competition studies with these DAGs on [3H]PDBu binding to RasGRP revealed different Ki values for these DAG molecular species. Furthermore, we transfected human Jurkat T cells by a plasmid containing RasGRP and assessed the implication of endogenous DAGs on activation of MAP kinases ERK1/ERK2, induced by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). In control cells, GF109203X, a protein kinase C inhibitor, inhibited ERK1/ERK2 activation. However, this agent curtailed but failed to completely diminish ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation in RasGRP-overexpressing cells, though calphostin C, a DAG binding inhibitor, suppressed the phosphorylation of MAP kinases in these cells. In cells incubated with arachidonic acid (AA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), PMA induced the production of endogenous DAGs containing these fatty acids, respectively: DAG-AA, DAG-DHA, and DAG-EPA. The inhibition of production of DAG-AA and DAG-DHA significantly inhibited MAP kinase activation in RasGRP overexpressing, but not in control, cells. Our study demonstrates that three DAG molecular species bind to RasGRP, but only DAG-AA and DAG-DHA participate in the modulation of RasGRP-mediated activation of MAP kinases in Jurkat T cells.

Our study demonstrates that three DAG molecular species bind to RasGRP, but only DAG-AA and DAG-DHA participate in the modulation of RasGRP-mediated activation of MAP kinases in Jurkat T cells. The Ras family of small GTPases is comprised of the classical Ras GTPases (H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras) as well as a more divergent group of Ras-related GTPase (TC21, R-Ras, R-Ras3, Rals, and Raps) (1.Bokoch G.M. Der C.J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 750-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These proteins cycle between an inactive form bound to GDP and an active GTP-bound state. To reach the active GTP-bound state, Ras proteins must first release bound GDP. This rate-limiting step in GTP binding is catalyzed by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine-nucleotide exchange factors; AA, arachidonic acid; DAG, diacylglycerol; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; SAG, 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol; SDG, 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycerol; SEG, 1-stearoyl-2-eicosapentaenoyl-sn-glycerol; PA, phosphatidic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PLD, phospholipase D; PCPLD, PC-specific PLD; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5 biphosphate; PLC, phospholipase C; PI-PLC, PI-specific-PLC; PS, phosphatidylserine; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PUFAs, polyunsaturated fatty acids; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ANOVA, analysis of variance. Several mammalian GEFs have been identified so far, including Sos (2.Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W. van Aelst L. Schlessinger J. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), RasGRF (3.Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and RalGDS (4.Albright C.F. Giddings B.W. Liu J. Vito M. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A new class of GEFs, expressed mainly in brain and T cells (5.Pierret P. Dunn R.J. Djordjevic B. Stone J.C. Richardson P.M. J. Neurocytol. 2000; 29: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 6.Pierret P. Vallee A. Mechawar N. Dower N.A. Stone J.C. Richardson P.M. Dunn R.J. Neuroscience. 2001; 108: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), is composed of at least four members: 1) RasGRP, the first member characterized as a GEF for Ras (7.Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar); 2) CalDAGI or RasGRP2, which possesses GEF activity for N-Ras, K-Ras, and Rap1 (8.Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34901-34908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); 3) CalDAGIII or Ras-GRP3, which can activate both Ras and Rap 1 (9.Rebhun J.F. Chen H. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13406-13410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); 4) RasGRP4, recently discovered, has been shown to activate H-Ras in a cation-dependent manner (10.Yang Y. Li L. Wong G.W. Krilis S.A. Madhusudhan M.S. Sali A. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25756-25774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 11.Reuther G.W. Lambert Q.T.

All these GRP members have a pair of atypical EF-hands (a calcium-binding motif), and the C1 domain, which represents a signature motif that is involved in the recognition of phorbol ester and diacylglycerol (DAG) (12.Lorenzo P.S. Kung J.W. Bottorff D.A. Garfield S.H. Stone J.C. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 943-949PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Tognon C.E. Kirk H. Passmore L.A. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Kay R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6995-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 14.Rong S.B. Enyedy I.J. Qiao L. Zhao L. Ma D. Pearce L.L. Lorenzo P.S. Stone J.C. Blumberg P.M. Wang S. Kozikowski A.P. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although calmodulin-like EF-hands are present in RasGRP, [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) binding is independent of calcium (12.Lorenzo P.S. Kung J.W. Bottorff D.A. Garfield S.H. Stone J.C. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 943-949PubMed Google Scholar). This is in marked contrast to the calcium-dependence observed for conventional protein kinase C (PKC) (15.Lorenzo P.S. Beheshti M. Pettit G.R. Stone J.C. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 840-846PubMed Google Scholar). For many years, DAG was believed to act solely through the PKC family of isoenzymes. Now, RasGRP provides a direct link between DAG generation and Ras activation (12.Lorenzo P.S. Kung J.W. Bottorff D.A. Garfield S.H. Stone J.C. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 943-949PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Rong S.B. Enyedy I.J. Qiao L. Zhao L. Ma D. Pearce L.L. Lorenzo P.S. Stone J.C. Blumberg P.M. Wang S. Kozikowski A.P. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Ebinu et al. (7.Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) monitored the subcellular fractionation of RasGRP in Rat2 cells, and they observed that PMA binding increased the recruitment of RasGRP to plasma membrane where it interacted efficiently with ras. Activated RasGRP and PKC, in turn, stimulate the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase-signaling pathway (12.Lorenzo P.S. Kung J.W. Bottorff D.A. Garfield S.H. Stone J.C. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 943-949PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Propagation of these signaling cascades promotes the transcription of numerous genes including those encoding cytokines critical for T cell development, activation, and proliferation. In fact, deletion of C1 domain of the RasGRP not only abolishes phorbol ester binding but also MAP kinase activation (7.Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 13.Tognon C.E. Kirk H. Passmore L.A. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Kay R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6995-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Numerous reports have described a beneficial effect of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA) on cellmediated immunity. Fish oil supplementation of human and animal diets has been shown to decrease interleukin-2 production, T cell mitogen-induced proliferation, and delayed type hypersensitivity, indicating an overall decrease in T cell-mediated immune function (17.Harbige L.S. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1998; 57: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Hence, the omega 3 fatty acids incorporated into cell phospholipids could affect cell signaling via DAG production after phospholipid hydrolysis. In T cells, DAG is produced in a biphasic way (18.Khan N.A. Hichami A. Pandali G. Recent Advances in Research in Lipids. 6. Transworld Publications, Trivendrum2002: 65-78Google Scholar). The transient production of DAG is assured by the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2), catalyzed by phospholipase C (PLC). The second sustained phase of DAG generation is associated with an increase in the activation of phospholipase D (PLD)catalyzed phosphatidylcholine (PC) hydrolysis, producing phosphatidic acid (PA), which can be converted to DAG by the action of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (19.Khan N.A. Hichami A. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20.Sebaldt R.J. Adams D.O. Uhing R.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In cardiomyocytes, addition of DHA has been shown to modulate cell contractility via the production of DAG, containing this fatty acid (21.Bordoni A. Biagi P.L. Turchetto E. Rossi C.A. Hrelia S. Cardiologia. 1992; 37: 631-634PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, EPA incorporated into DAG has been found to reduce vascular complications associated with diabetes (22.Kuroki T. Inoguchi T. Umeda F. Nawata H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 24: 473-477Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the same way, we have recently demonstrated that different isoforms of conventional PKCs (α, βI, and γ) and novel PKCs (ϵ and δ) differ in their response to DAGs containing omega 6 or omega 3 PUFAs in a cell-free system (23.Madani S. Hichami A. Legrand A. Belleville J. Khan N.A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2595-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As far as the modulation of RasGRP by DAG is concerned, to our knowledge, a few studies are available. Lorenzo et al. (15.Lorenzo P.S. Beheshti M. Pettit G.R. Stone J.C. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 840-846PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol was 20-fold more potent for binding to rat C1 RasGRP than with PKCα. These authors also examined the translocation pattern of RasGRP3 in response to 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol in HEK-293 cells (12.Lorenzo P.S. Kung J.W. Bottorff D.A. Garfield S.H. Stone J.C. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 943-949PubMed Google Scholar). They found that 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol induced RasGRP3 redistribution to the perinuclear region, and to a lesser extent, to the plasma membrane. Nonetheless, no comparative study is available on the affinity of RasGRP to bind DAGs containing either omega 6 or omega 3 PUFAs. Therefore, it was thought worthwhile to elucidate 1) the comparative effects of different DAGs molecular species containing arachidonic acid (AA), an omega 6 PUFA, and DHA and EPA, two omega 3 PUFAs, on binding isotherm of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate to RasGRP, and 2) the implication of endogenously produced DAGs containing these fatty acids in the regulation of MAPK activation in human Jurkat T cells. Materials—[3H]AA (217 Ci/mmol) and [14C]DHA (50 mCi/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [3H]EPA (100–200 Ci/mmol) was from ICN Biomedical (Orsay, France). Phosphatidyl-l-serine (PS) from bovine brain, 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine, propranolol, PMA, AA, DHA, and EPA were obtained from Sigma. [3H]PDBu (629 GBq/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. Anti-phosphorylated MAP kinase (ERK1/ERK2) antibodies were obtained from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-RasGRP antibodies (R20) were obtained from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). GF109203, calphostin C, and U73122 were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The MAP kinase assay kit (BIOTRAK) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Expression and Purification of Rat RasGRP Proteins in Echerichia coli—The cDNA coding for RasGRP was cloned from rat brain mRNA (7.Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Recombinant RasGRP produced in E. coli was used for the assays. Briefly, BL-21 bacteria, transformed with the RasGRP-pMAL-c2 construct, were induced using 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-f-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. The bacterial culture was then centrifuged for 20 min at 4,000 × g at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors). Cell lysis was completed by six 15-s pulses of sonication over 2 min. The lysate was centrifuged 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, and the supernatant was used as the crude extract for the subsequent purification. The maltose basic protein-RasGRP fusion protein was purified using an amylose resin according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England BioLabs). Depending on the batch, 10 μg of partially purified protein per tube were used for the binding assays. Synthesis of SAG, SDG, and SEG—SAG, SDG, and SEG were obtained by the action of phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus on 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-PC), 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-PC) and 1-stearoyl-2-eicosapentaenoyl-PC, respectively, as described previously (23.Madani S. Hichami A. Legrand A. Belleville J. Khan N.A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2595-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, DAGs after their synthesis were purified using straight-phase HPLC on a 30 cm μporasil column (Millipore, Saint-Quentin, France) and eluted isocratically with hexane/isopropyl alcohol, 100:1 (v/v). The purified DAGs were identified by comparing their retention times with those of standards [3H]DAGs. Standards of radiolabeled DAGs were obtained as follow: [3H]AA, [14C]DHA, and [3H]EPA were esterified by lysoPC by using rat liver microsomes. The radiolabeled phospholipids obtained were hydrolyzed by phospholipase C, and DAGs were purified using straight-phase HPLC as described in this paragraph. HPLC-purified DAGs were quantified after transesterification at 80 °C for 20 min by BF3/methanol, using dinonadecanoin as internal standard. Fatty acid methyl esters were extracted with 2 ml hexane, separated by gas-liquid chromatography in a Packard Model 417 gas-liquid chromatograph, and equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 30-m capillary gas column-coated with carbowax 20 m. The analysis conditions were as follows: oven at 194 °C, injector and ionizing detector at 240 °C. Helium was used as carrier gas, with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Quantification of fatty acid peaks was achieved with reference to the internal standard by using DELSI ENICA 31 (Delsi Nermag, Rungis, France). Preparation of Vesicles—The required amounts of PS, DAG, labeled [3H]PDBu and unlabeled-PDBu in chloroform or ethanol were dried under a stream of nitrogen in a glass tube and solubilized in Tris-HCl 20 mm by vortexing and sonication at 30 °C for 5 min. Binding of [3H]PDBu—Binding of [3H]PDBu was measured using polyethylene glycol precipitation assay as described by Sharkey and Blumberg (24.Sharkey N.A. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 19-24PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mg/ml IgG, 0.1 mm CaCl2, RasGRP protein and the corresponding lipid mixture or sonicated PS dispersion. Incubations were carried out for 5 min at 18 °C. Nonspecific binding was measured using an excess of PDBu (30 μm), and specific binding was performed in triplicate at each ligand concentration (0.125–30 nm). For competition experiments on [3H]PDBu binding to RasGRP by different DAG molecule species, the reactions were performed under similar conditions, but using a fixed concentrations of [3H]PDBu (6 nm) and increasing concentrations of the nonradioactive ligands. In atypical competition assay, ten different concentrations (in triplicate) of the competing ligand were used. IC50 values were determined from the competition curve and the Ki for the competing ligand was calculated from the IC50 by using the relationship Ki = IC50/(1 + L)/KD, where L is the concentration of free [3H]PDBu used and Kd is the dissociation of constant for [3H]PDBu for RasGRP. The Hill coefficient (nH) was calculated according to the following equation: -log × %Bmax/100% - %Bmax, as a function of -log [c], which will provide a straight line. y = ax + b; where a = slope of the straight line and is equal to Hill number; [c] is the concentration of the ligand. Saturation and competition studies were analyzed using the software RADLIG 4.0, by non-linear curvefitting LIGAND (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Plasmids—The construct, which coded for the myelin basic protein-RasGRP fusion protein, was used for bacterial expression and purification. To produce a construct suitable for mammalian expression, the cDNA of RasGRP was subcloned into PQE-TriSystem vector (Qiagen) using BamHI and HindIII sites. Cell Culture and Transfection—To assess the effects of DAGs on the expression of RasGRP and MAP kinase signaling, Jurkat T cells, which possess a little RasGRP activity (25.Flenger J.H. Kumar R. Sridhar C.N. Wheeler C.J. Tsai Y.J. Border R. Ramsey P. Martin M. Felgner P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2550-2561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were engineered to overexpress the rat RasGRP cDNA using PQE-TriSystem vector. The Jurkat T cells were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with l-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified chamber containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were counted and assessed for viability by trypan blue exclusion test. Cells (7.5 × 106) were then plated in 24-well plates and transient transfection of Jurkat cells with RasGRP-PQE-TriSystem construct was performed using X-treme-GENE Q2 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science). Non-transfected cells (control) received all transfection reagents except RasGRP cDNA. 48 h after, control and RasGRP-transfected cells were used for experiments. To access transfection efficiency, in separate wells, cells were transfected with pCH 110 vector (Amersham Biosciences) containing lacZ gene, and β-galactosidase expression was monitored using a photometric assay as described by Flenger et al. (25.Flenger J.H. Kumar R. Sridhar C.N. Wheeler C.J. Tsai Y.J. Border R. Ramsey P. Martin M. Felgner P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2550-2561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detection of RasGRP by Immunoblotting—The protein lysate were prepared from non-transfected and rasGRP-transfected cells. Protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes, and immunodetection of RasGRP was performed by using goat polyclonal anti-RasGRP antibodies raised against a peptide mapping at the carboxyl terminus of RasGRP of rat origin. This antibody reacts with both rat and human RasGRP. After treating the membrane with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat secondary antibodies, peroxidase activity was detected with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Fatty Acid-Albumin Complexes—Free AA, DHA, and EPA were stored at -20 °C in ethanol solution under nitrogen. Aliquots of the ethanolic solution were evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) in RPMI 1640 medium was added to give a final fatty acid concentration of 10 μm. The mixtures were incubated under nitrogen for 4 h at 37 °C. Measurement of DAG Production—To determine the contribution of phospholipases and PKC in DAG production, we used specific inhibitors of phospholipases and PKC. U73122 was used for inhibition of phosphoinositide-specific-PLC (PI-PLC), propranolol for phosphatidylcholine-specific PLD (PC-PLD) and GF109203X for PKC. Both control and RasGRP-transfected Jurkat T cells were incubated for 3 h in RPMI without serum. Cells were further incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 (0.2% BSA) in the presence or not (none) of [3H]AA (10 μm, 17 mCi/mmol), [14C]DHA (10 μm, 20 mCi/mmol) or [3H]EPA (10 μm, 20 mCi/mmol). After the incubation period, cells were washed three times in RPMI 1640 medium (0.2% BSA). Cells (4 × 106/ml) were then incubated for 30 min with either U73122, propranolol, U73122 + propranolol, or GF109203X before incubation for 10 min at 37 °C in the absence (Unstim.) or presence of PMA. Incubation were stopped by the addition of methanol and DAGs were extracted three time with hexane and quantitatively converted to [32P]PA as described by Preiss et al. (27.Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedle J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the dry extract was suspended in a cardiolipin + n-octyl-β-f-glucopyranoside solution and incubated with DAG kinase in the presence of [32P]ATP. The resulting PA was then extracted and separated by TLC (chloroform/methanol/acetic acid, 65:15:5 (v/v)). The area corresponding to PA was scraped and the radioactivity spectrum was measured by liquid scintillation counting to establish the 32P/3H or 32P/14C ratios. DAG containing exogenous fatty acids were quantified with reference to the specific activity of these radiolabeled fatty acids incubated in the presence of cells. MAP Kinase Assay—Prior to experiments, both control and RasGRP-transfected Jurkat T cells were incubated for 3 h in RPMI without serum. Cells were further incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 (0.2% BSA) in the presence or not (none) of non-radiolabeled PUFA: (each at 10 μm) AA, DHA, or EPA. Later on, cells were washed three times in RPMI 1640 medium (0.2% BSA). Cells (4 × 106/ml) were then incubated for 30 min with either U73122 (10 μm), propranolol (100 μm), U73122 + propranolol, GF109203X (500 nm), or calphostin C (1 μm), and again incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the absence (Unstim.) or presence of PMA (200 nm). After incubation, the cells were lysed and centrifuged (2,500 × g for 1 min). The protein contents of cell lysate were determined with a Sigma Bradford reagent kit. Denatured protein (20 μg) was separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes, and immunodetection was performed by using anti-phosphorylated anti-rat ERK1/ERK2 antibodies. After treating the membrane with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibodies, peroxidase activity was detected with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). MAP kinase enzyme activity was determined according to the instructions, furnished with the kit. The enzyme activity was assessed by monitoring the incorporation of 32Pi into a peptidic fraction of EGF receptor, containing the PLS/TP sequence, which is a more specific substrate for MAP kinases than the myelin basic protein. Assays were terminated by spotting cell lysates onto P-81 filter paper followed by extensive washing with 75 mm orthophosphoric acid. Radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation. Statistical Analysis—Results are shown as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis of data was carried out using STATISTICA (version 4.1, Statsoft, Paris, France). The significance of the differences between mean values was determined by employing one way ANOVA. Binding of [3H]PDBu to RasGRP and Its Displacement by SAG, SDG, and SEG—As shown in Fig. 1, [3H]PDBu bound to RasGRP (Bmax, 152 ± 1.66 pmol/mg protein) with high affinity, the dissociation constant (Kd) being 1.5 ± 0.35 nm (n = 6). To determine the structure-activity relationship for ligand recognition by RasGRP, we performed competition binding studies using different DAGs in which sn-2 position contained either omega 6 or omega 3 fatty acids. The ligands included SAG, an omega 6 PUFA, and SDG and SEG, two omega 3 PUFAs (Fig. 2 and Table I). The displacement of [3H]PDBu by all nonradiolabeled DAG molecular species revealed nH values of 0.79, 1.03, and 0.87 for SAG, SDG, and SEG, respectively (Table I). The competition curve of the displacement of [3H]PDBu by SAG begins at 0.5 μm with an IC50 of 4.52 μm (Fig. 2, Table I). In the case of SDG, the IC50 is 8.41 μm and this DAG begins to displace the binding of [3H]PDBu beyond 2.5 μm (Fig. 2). The displacement of [3H]PDBu by SEG begins at 1 μm and provides an IC50 of 5 μm (Fig. 2). The Ki values for SA, SDG, and SEG were, respectively, 4.49 ± 0.01 μm, 8.37 ± 1.02 μm, and 4.97 ± 1.04 μm. These results indicate a high affinity of RasGRP for SAG and SEG and low affinity for SDG.Fig. 2Displacement of [3H]PDBu binding to RasGRP by different DAG molecular species. Lipid vesicles were prepared with different DAGs (SAG, SDG, or SEG) and the displacement of [3H]PDBu binding was determined as a function of increasing concentrations of DAG as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are the mean ± S.E.

The presence of three fatty acids in cell lipids was confirmed with a higher incorporation of DHA (10% of the amount present in the culture medium), compared with AA (8%) and EPA (2%) (results not shown). Fatty acid incorporation into total phospholipids was 52, 48, and 28% for AA, DHA, and EPA, respectively, of total lipids including phospholipids cholesterol esters and triglycerides (results not shown). On the other hand, the three fatty acids, i.e. DHA, AA and EPA, being incorporated at a similar rate in PC, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and PI/PS, varied from 80, 11, and 8% of total phospholipids, respectively (results not shown). In the neutral lipids, AA, DHA, and EPA incorporation was 45, 50, and 70%, respectively, of total lipids including phospholipids cholesterol esters and triglycerides. To determine the optimal production of DAG by PMA, the cells were incubated for different periods (0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min) in the absence of PUFA. We observed that PMA incubation of cells for 10 min exerted optimal stimulatory effects on DAG production as shown in Fig. 3. Basal DAG production was not different between control and transfected cells whether or not cells were incubated with PUFAs (Fig. 4A). We noticed that after incubation in the presence of AA, DHA, or EPA, unstimulated (Unstim.) cells contained DAGs acylated with these fatty acids (Fig. 4B). DAG containing radiolabeled AA, DHA, and EPA represent 18, 25, and 3% of total endogenous DAG, respectively (Fig. 4). The basal level of 1-acyl-2-(DHA)glycerol (DAG-DHA) was higher (30 ± 2 pmol/million cells), compared with 1-acyl-2-(AA)glycerol (DAG-AA) or 1-acyl-2-(EPA)glycerol (DAG-EPA) (6 ± 0.50 and 2 ± 0.10 pmol/million cells, respectively"

The unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) is an established experimental model of renal interstitial inflammation. In our previous study, we postulated that L-selectin on monocytes is involved in their infiltration into the interstitium by UUO and that a sulfated glycolipid, sulfatide, is the physiological L-selectin ligand in the kidney. Here we tested the above hypothesis using sulfatide- and L-selectin-deficient mice. Sulfatide-deficient mice were generated by gene targeting of the cerebroside sulfotransferase (Cst) gene. Although the L-selectin-IgG chimera protein specifically bound to sulfatide fraction in acidic lipids from wild-type kidney, it did not show such binding in fractions of Cst-/- mice kidney, indicating that sulfatide is the major L-selectin-binding glycolipid in the kidney. The distribution of L-selectin ligand in wild-type mice changed after UUO; sulfatide was relocated from the distal tubules to the peritubular capillaries where monocytes infiltrate, suggesting that sulfatide relocated to the endothelium after UUO interacted with L-selectin on monocytes. In contrast, L-selectin ligand was not detected in Cst-/- mice irrespective of UUO treatment. Compared with wild-type mice, Cst-/- mice showed a considerable reduction in the number of monocytes/macrophages that infiltrated the interstitium after UUO. The number of monocytes/macrophages was also reduced to a similar extent in L-selectin-/- mice. Our results suggest that sulfatide is a major L-selectin-binding molecule in the kidney and that the interaction between L-selectin and sulfatide plays a critical role in monocyte infiltration into the kidney interstitium.

Blood monocytes that extravasate to sites of inflammation differentiate into macrophages and induce inflammatory response and apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells leading to tubulointerstitial injury in renal inflammation (1.Nikolic-Paterson D.J.

Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1995; 26: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although infiltration of monocytes/macrophages into the interstitium following UUO is well documented, the mechanism involved in this process remains elusive. Monocyte infiltration is a multistep process in which chemokines and adhesion molecules play key roles. The initial step of this process involves the binding of monocytes to the endothelium of venules, mediated by various adhesion molecules such as selectins (6.Bevilacqua M.P. Nelson R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). The selectin family consists of three members, designated P-, E-, and L-selectin. The P- and E-selectins are present on activated endothelial cells, whereas L-selectin is expressed on leukocytes. Results of our previous study in rats with UUO (7.Shikata K. Suzuki Y. Wada J. Hirata K. Matsuda M. Kawashima H. Suzuki T. Iizuka M. Makino H. Miyasaka M. J. Pathol. 1999; 188: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) suggested that L-selectin on monocytes mediates their infiltration into the interstitium, based on the observation that a neutralizing antibody against L-selectin inhibited monocyte infiltration. L-selectin was originally identified as a homing receptor to capture lymphocytes in the flowing bloodstream in lymph nodes (8.Gallatin W.M. Weissman I.L. Butcher E.C. Nature. 1983; 304: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 9.Lasky L.A. Singer M.S. Yednock T.A. Dowbenko D. Fennie C. Rodriguez H. Nguyen T. Stachel S. Rosen S.D.

Science. 1989; 243: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, L-selectin ligands are expressed not only in lymphoid organs but also in other tissues (11.Tamatani T. Kuida K. Watanabe T. Koike S. Miyasaka M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1735-1745PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Norgard-Sumnicht K.E. Varki N.M. Varki A.

The main L-selectin-binding molecules are sialylated, fucosylated, and sulfated glycans on mucin-like molecules such as Gly-CAM-I and CD34, which are located on lymph node high endothelial venules and are involved in the homing (14.Imai Y. Lasky L.A. Rosen S.D. Nature. 1993; 361: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). L-selectin also binds to a sulfated glycolipid, sulfatide (15.Suzuki Y. Toda Y. Tamatani T. Watanabe T.

We have recently shown that collagen XVIII interacts with L-selectin (21.Kawashima H. Watanabe N. Hirose M. Sun X. Atarashi K. Kimura T. Shikata K. Matsuda M. Ogawa D. Heljasvaara R. Rehn M.

Furthermore, chemically synthesized 3′-sulfo Lewisa and 3′-sulfo Lewisx oligosaccharides were found to be potent L-selectin ligands as are sialyl Lewisa/Lewisx determinants or sulfatide (22.Green P.J. Tamatani T. Watanabe T. Miyasaka M. Hasegawa A. Kiso M. Yuen C.T. Stoll M.S. Feizi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Results of our previous study (7.Shikata K. Suzuki Y. Wada J. Hirata K. Matsuda M. Kawashima H. Suzuki T. Iizuka M. Makino H. Miyasaka M. J. Pathol. 1999; 188: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) suggested that sulfatide is an L-selectin ligand in the rat kidney and contributes to the interstitial monocyte infiltration following UUO. These conclusions were based on the histochemical distribution of sulfatide, demonstrated by an anti-sulfatide monoclonal antibody that was very close to that of L-selectin ligand detected by an L-selectin-IgG chimera protein before and after ureteric ligation and that exogenously added anti-L-selectin monoclonal antibody or sulfatide considerably inhibited monocyte infiltration (7.Shikata K.

Sulfoglycolipids are comprised of acidic glycolipids containing sulfate esters on their oligosaccharides. They have been implicated in a variety of physiological functions through their interactions with extracellular matrix proteins, cellular adhesion receptors, blood coagulation systems, complement activation systems, cation transporter systems, and microorganisms (23.Ishizuka I. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 245-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The distribution of sulfoglycolipids is tissue-specific and they are abundant in myelin sheaths, spermatozoa, renal tubular cells, and epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract (23.Ishizuka I. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 245-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Sulfation of glycolipids is catalyzed by cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST, EC 2.8.2.11), which is located in the Golgi apparatus (24.Honke K. Tsuda M. Hirahara Y. Ishii A. Makita A. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4864-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Recently, Cst-null mice were generated by gene targeting to elucidate the physiological functions of sulfoglycolipids (25.Honke K. Hirahara Y. Dupree J. Suzuki K. Popko B. Fukushima K. Fukushima J. Nagasawa T. Yoshida N. Wada Y. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4227-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The Cst-/- mice completely lack sulfatide in the brain and seminolipid in the testis and manifest some neurological disorders because of myelin dysfunction as well as spermatogenesis arrest (25.Honke K. Hirahara Y. Dupree J. Suzuki K. Popko B. Fukushima K. Fukushima J. Nagasawa T. Yoshida N. Wada Y. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4227-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 26.Ishibashi T. Dupree J.L. Ikenaka K. Hirahara Y. Honke K. Peles E. Popko B. Suzuki K. Nishino H. Baba H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6507-6514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations emphasize the critical roles of sulfoglycolipids in the intercellular interactions during myelin formation and spermatogenesis. Because sulfatide is rich in renal tubular cells, its involvement in renal function such as ion transport has been suggested (23.Ishizuka I. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 245-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, the Cst-null mice do not exhibit signs of renal failure or apparent histological abnormality in the kidney (25.Honke K. Hirahara Y. Dupree J. Suzuki K. Popko B. Fukushima K. Fukushima J. Nagasawa T. Yoshida N. Wada Y. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4227-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). A detailed analysis with some stress would be desirable to elucidate the biological function of sulfatide in the kidney. Here we tested the hypothesis that interaction between sulfatide and L-selectin mediates infiltration of monocytes into the kidney interstitium, using sulfatide- and L-selectin-deficient mice. The present results established the critical role of their interaction in monocyte infiltration that occurs in the inflamed kidney. Animals—Cst-/- mice and L-selectin-/- mice were generated as described previously (25.Honke K. Hirahara Y. Dupree J. Suzuki K. Popko B. Fukushima K. Fukushima J. Nagasawa T. Yoshida N. Wada Y.

All experimental protocols described in the present study were approved by the Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation of Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry. Lipid Extraction and Analysis—Pooled kidneys (1.4-2 g) from 8- to 12-week-old mice of each genotype and sex were extracted with 19 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1 by volume) and then with 10 volumes of chloroform/methanol/water (60:120:9 by volume). The pooled extracts (the total lipid extract) were analyzed by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography (TLC), using the solvent system chloroform/methanol/water containing 0.2% CaCl2 (65:35:8 by volume) (first direction) and chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/water (7:2:4:2:1 by volume) (second direction) (28.Tadano-Aritomi K. Hikita T. Fujimoto H. Suzuki K. Motegi K. Ishizuka I. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1237-1243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycolipids were visualized with the orcinol-sulfuric acid reagent. Thin-layer Chromatogram Blotting—Total lipid was extracted from kidney with chloroform/methanol/water (30:60:8 by volume) followed by chloroform/methanol (2:1 by volume). The extracts were combined and applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (Amersham Biosciences) column. After washing with chloroform/methanol/water (30:60:8 by volume) and methanol, acidic glycolipids were eluted with 200 mm ammonium acetate in methanol and desalted using a SepPak C18 cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA). The desalted glycolipids were applied to a TLC plate (Silica Gel 60; Merck) and developed with chloroform/methanol/0.2% CaCl2 (60:30:7 by volume). After chromatography, glycolipids were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon; Millipore) and incubated with L-selectin-IgG chimera (LEC-IgG) (11.Tamatani T. Kuida K. Watanabe T. Koike S. Miyasaka M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1735-1745PubMed Google Scholar), followed by peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-human IgG (Cappel, Durham, NC) as described previously (29.Taki T. Handa S. Ishikawa D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction—Cst-/- mice (n = 5, female) were subjected to complete UUO as described previously (3.Dziukas L.J. Sterzel R.B. Hodson C.J. Hoyer J.R. Lab. Investig. 1982; 47: 185-193PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the right ureter was ligated with a silk ligature under anesthesia at the junction of the upper third and lower two-thirds. Wild-type mice (n = 5, female) from the same litter were used as control. At day 2, the mice were sacrificed, and the obstructed and non-obstructed kidneys were removed. Portions of the tissue were processed for TLC blotting and immunohistochemistry. L-selectin-/- mice (n = 5, female) and wild-type mice (n = 5, female) were operated on in the same way as Cst-/- mice and were sacrificed and the kidneys dissected out for immunohistochemistry. Histopathological Examination—Each kidney specimen was divided into two parts. One portion was fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Four-micrometer-thick sections were stained with periodic acid Schiff for morphological examination. The other portion of each specimen was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and cut with a cryostat. Four-micrometer-thick acetone-fixed frozen sections were used for immunohistological evaluation. Ligands for L-selectin and sulfatide were detected by the indirect immunofluorescence method as described previously (7.Shikata K. Suzuki Y. Wada J. Hirata K. Matsuda M. Kawashima H. Suzuki T. Iizuka M. Makino H. Miyasaka M. J. Pathol. 1999; 188: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, the frozen sections were fixed with cold acetone for 3 min and stained with LEC-IgG or anti-sulfatide monoclonal antibody (GS5) (7.Shikata K. Suzuki Y. Wada J. Hirata K. Matsuda M.

Recombinant Ig chimera or mouse IgM was used as a control for nonspecific staining (7.Shikata K. Suzuki Y. Wada J. Hirata K. Matsuda M. Kawashima H. Suzuki T. Iizuka M. Makino H. Miyasaka M. J. Pathol. 1999; 188: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11.Tamatani T. Kuida K. Watanabe T. Koike S. Miyasaka M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1735-1745PubMed Google Scholar). Then, the sections were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-human IgG antibody (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Aurora, OH) or FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgM antibody (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, mounted with PermaFluor (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA), and examined under a fluorescence microscope (LSM-510; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Monocyte/macrophage infiltration into the renal interstitium was estimated by immunostaining, using a specific rat monoclonal antibody against mouse monocyte/macrophage (F4/80; Serotec, Oxford, UK). In brief, the frozen sections were fixed with cold acetone for 3 min, and nonspecific protein binding was blocked by incubation with normal goat serum and avidin for 20 min. The sections were first incubated with F4/80 for 60 min at room temperature. Rat IgG was used as a control for nonspecific staining. Then the sections were incubated with biotin-labeled goat anti-rat IgG antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 30 min at room temperature. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating the sections in methanol containing 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min. After that, the sections were stained with a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The sections were then counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Cell Counts—The nuclei of F4/80-positive cells were counted by examining 10 randomly selected areas near the borderline of the cortex and medulla under high magnification (×400). Cell number per mm2 was expressed according to the method described by Saito and Atkins (31.Saito T. Atkins R.C. Kidney Int. 1990; 37: 1076-1083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were examined for statistical significance using one-way analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's test. A p value less than 0.05 denoted the presence of a statistically significant difference. Sulfatide Is Absent in Cst-null Mice—Because the profiles of the kidney glycolipids were noticeably different between normal male and female mice (Fig. 1, a and c) as described before (28.Tadano-Aritomi K. Hikita T. Fujimoto H. Suzuki K. Motegi K. Ishizuka I. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1237-1243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), total glycolipids from male and female kidneys of Cst-null mice were separately investigated. As shown in Fig. 1, spots corresponding to authentic sulfatide SM4s were absent in both cases. Instead, spots corresponding to GalCer, which is the precursor of sulfatide in terms of CST, increased. These results indicate that CST is responsible for the biosynthesis of sulfatide in the kidney. Sulfatide Is a Ligand for L-selectin in Mouse Kidney—To investigate biochemically the ligands for L-selectin in mouse kidney, acidic lipids were extracted from the kidney and their reactivity to L-selectin was examined by TLC blotting analyses. As shown in Fig. 2B, the LEC-IgG bound to a material comigrating with sulfatide in the acidic lipid fraction from the wild-type kidney as well as the authentic bovine brain sulfatide, whereas it did not react to ganglioside GM3, consistent with the results of Suzuki et al. (15.Suzuki Y. Toda Y. Tamatani T. Watanabe T. Suzuki T. Nakao T. Murase K. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Tadano-Aritomi K. Ishizuka I. Miyasaka M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In Cst-/- kidney, sulfatide disappeared from the acidic lipid fraction (Fig. 2A), consistent with the results in Fig. 1, and the reactivity to LEC-IgG was also completely abolished (Fig. 2B). These results clearly indicate that the L-selectin ligand in lipid fraction of mouse kidney is sulfatide. Interstitial Changes in UUO—No abnormalities were detected in Cst-/- or wild-type mice before UUO (Fig. 3, A and B). UUO resulted in tubular dilation and atrophic changes in the interstitium of the obstructed kidney (Fig. 3, C and D). In contrast, the non-obstructed kidney showed no signs of tubular dilation or atrophy (Fig. 3, E and F). The non-obstructed kidneys of L-selectin-/- and wild-type mice were also similar to the normal control kidneys (data not shown). Distribution of L-selectin Ligands and Sulfatide in Mouse Kidney—LEC-IgG reacted exclusively with the distal tubules where sulfatide is expressed in wild-type mouse kidney (Figs. 4A and 5A). This reactivity was almost absent in the kidney of Cst-/- mice (Figs. 4B and 5B), supporting the results of biochemical experiments showing that the major L-selectin ligand in the kidney is sulfatide. Following ureteric ligation, the reactivity of LEC-IgG in the distal tubules disappeared and, instead, a new reactivity emerged in the interstitium and peritubular capillaries (Figs. 4C and 5C). This reactivity of LECIgG after ureteral obstruction was also almost abolished in the interstitium of Cst-/- mice (Figs. 4D and 5D). Distribution of the reactivity with LEC-IgG showed a similar pattern with that of anti-sulfatide antibody before and after ureteral obstruction. No staining was observed in the kidney when irrelevant immunoglobulin was used as a negative control.Fig. 5Immunohistochemical analysis of the kidneys of wild-type and Cst-/- mice with GS5. Mouse kidneys of wild-type (A, C) and Cst-/- (B, D) mice before (A, B) and after (C, D) UUO treatment were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis with GS5 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, GS5 reacted exclusively with the distal tubular epithelial cells in the kidney of wild-type mice. Glomeruli, peritubular capillaries, and arteries were negative for the reaction. C, the reactivity with GS5 shifted from the distal tubules to the interstitium and peritubular capillaries (arrowheads) after UUO. Inset, a high magnification of the dashed line area.

Because monocyte infiltration commences as early as 4-12 h after UUO (3.Dziukas L.J. Sterzel R.B. Hodson C.J. Hoyer J.R. Lab. Investig. 1982; 47: 185-193PubMed Google Scholar), it was evaluated at 48 h after UUO in the present study. Monocytes/macrophages were stained with a specific anti-monocyte/macrophage monoclonal antibody, F4/80 (Fig. 6). No staining was observed in the kidney when irrelevant immunoglobulin was used as a negative control. There was no difference in the number of monocytes/macrophages between Cst-/- mice and wild-type mice before UUO (Fig. 7). After UUO, there was a 4-fold increase in the number of these cells compared with pre-UUO in wild-type mice (Fig. 7). However, the increased number of monocytes/macrophages induced by UUO was suppressed to almost 50% of that before UUO in Cst-/- mice (Figs. 6 and 7), suggesting that sulfatide is highly responsible for the infiltration of monocytes into the renal interstitium.Fig. 7Quantitative analysis of UUO-induced infiltrating monocytes/macrophages in the renal interstitium of Cst-/- mice. Immunoperoxidase staining of kidneys of wild-type (+/+) and Cst-/- (-/-) mice with or without UUO treatment was performed as shown in Fig. 6. The nuclei of F4/80-positive cells were counted in 10 randomly selected areas near the borderline of the cortex and medulla under high magnification (×400). All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. *, p < 0.01, **, p < 0.05, by one-way analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Monocyte/Macrophage Infiltration in the Renal Interstitium of L-selectin-/- Mice—To determine the contribution of L-selectin to the monocyte infiltration into the interstitium, the number of monocytes/macrophages into the interstitium after UUO was compared between L-selectin-/- and wild-type mice. Although there was no difference in the number of monocytes/macrophages between these mice before UUO, the increased number of these cells induced by UUO was significantly reduced in L-selectin-deficient mice (Fig. 8). The suppressed rate of the increment of infiltrated monocytes/macrophages induced by UUO was almost the same between Cst-/- and L-selectin-/- mice, suggesting that sulfatide on the endothelial cells of peritubular capillaries is the major ligand for L-selectin on the monocytes when they enter the interstitium. The residual elevation in the number of monocytes/macrophages after UUO in Cst-/- and L-selectin-/- mice indicates the contribution of other as yet unknown factors. Our previous results indicated that interaction between sulfatide in the kidney and L-selectin on monocytes mediates monocyte infiltration into the kidney interstitium (7.Shikata K. Suzuki Y. Wada J. Hirata K. Matsuda M. Kawashima H. Suzuki T. Iizuka M. Makino H. Miyasaka M. J. Pathol. 1999; 188: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on the following results: blockade of L-selectin function by a neutralizing antibody protects against monocyte infiltration after UUO in rats (7.Shikata K. Suzuki Y. Wada J. Hirata K. Matsuda M. Kawashima H. Suzuki T. Iizuka M. Makino H. Miyasaka M. J. Pathol. 1999; 188: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); sulfatide binds specifically to L-selectin through the sulfated sugar chain (15.Suzuki Y. Toda Y. Tamatani T. Watanabe T. Suzuki T. Nakao T. Murase K. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Tadano-Aritomi K. Ishizuka I. Miyasaka M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); L-selectin ligand relocates from the distal tubules to the interstitium and peritubular capillaries by UUO as sulfatide does (7.Shikata K. Suzuki Y. Wada J. Hirata K. Matsuda M. Kawashima H. Suzuki T. Iizuka M. Makino H. Miyasaka M. J. Pathol. 1999; 188: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); and exogenously administrated sulfatide inhibits monocyte infiltration after UUO (7.Shikata K. Suzuki Y. Wada J. Hirata K. Matsuda M. Kawashima H. Suzuki T. Iizuka M. Makino H. Miyasaka M. J. Pathol. 1999; 188: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The present study further strengthens the above results and shows that L-selectin ligand is absent in sulfatide-deficient mice and that monocyte infiltration after UUO is reduced in sulfatide-deficient mice to the same extent as in L-selectin-deficient mice. During the preparation of this report, Lange-Sperandio et al. (32.Lange-Sperandio B. Cachat F. Thornhill B.A. Chevalier R.L. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 516-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) reported that inhibition of macrophage recruitment to the obstructed kidneys with L-selectin deficiency is associated with a reduction of apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells and interstitial fibrosis. This finding adds strong support to our conclusion. Where does L-selectin on the monocytes contact with sulfatide in the kidney? Sulfatide is expressed in the distal tubules in normal kidney, where no leukocyte traffic is seen. In addition, leukocytes rarely enter the renal interstitium under normal conditions. It is speculated that sulfatide mediates rolling and/or migration after UUO. First, after UUO, sulfatide relocates from the distal tubules to the interstitium and peritubular capillaries, where monocytes are considered to extravasate into the interstitium. Thus, L-selectin and sulfatide seem to make contact on the peritubular capillary walls. Second, sulfatide, which relocates from the distal tubules to the interstitium, mediates extravasation and migration of monocytes into the kidney interstitium. Recently, it was demonstrated that the number of emigrated leukocytes and the distance of extravascular migration was significantly reduced in L-selectin-deficient mice (33.Hickey M.J. Forster M. Mitchell D. Kaur J. De Caigny C. Kubes P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7164-7170Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The same phenomenon might occur in sulfatide-deficient mice. Then why does the distribution of sulfatide change following UUO? There are also two possible mechanisms. One is that sulfatide is shed from injured tubular epithelial cells and moves into the interstitium and peritubular capillary walls. A similar event has been observed in Tamm Horsfall protein (4.Schreiner G.F. Harris K.P. Purkerson M.L. Klahr S. Kidney Int. 1988; 34: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The other is that sulfatide is newly synthesized in the interstitium and peritubular capillary walls following ureteric ligation. In addition to obstructive nephropathy, interstitial infiltration of mononuclear cells is also observed in tubulo-interstitial nephritis, severe glomerulonephritis, and rejection of transplanted kidney. Selectins and their ligands have been shown to mediate monocyte infiltration in a variety of kidney inflammation. For instance, induced E-selectin on the peritubular capillary is implicated in monocyte infiltration in diabetic nephropathy (34.Hirata K. Shikata K. Matsuda M. Akiyama K. Sugimoto H. Kushiro M. Makino H. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Induction of L-selectin ligands on peritubullar and venous endothelium is suggested to be involved in acute kidney allograft rejection (35.Kirveskari J. Paavonen T. Hayry P. Renkonen R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 2358-2365PubMed Google Scholar). E- and P-selectin have been shown to mediate leukocyte infiltration during ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute renal failure (36.Singbartl K. Ley K. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 28: 2507-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 37.Singbartl K. Green S.A. Ley K. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Thus, all members of the selectin family may contribute to monocyte infiltration in the kidney. In the present study, monocyte infiltration induced by UUO was considerably, but not completely, suppressed in L-selectin-deficient mice. The residual recruitment activity might be attributed to E- and P-selectins (38.Naruse T. Yuzawa Y. Akahori T. Mizuno M. Maruyama S. Kannagi R. Hotta N. Matsuo S. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 94-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, there was no significant difference in the number of infiltrated monocytes/macrophages induced by UUO between triple selectin-deficient mice and L-selectin-deficient mice (32.Lange-Sperandio B. Cachat F. Thornhill B.A. Chevalier R.L. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 516-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This finding strongly suggests that E- and P-selectins scarcely contribute to monocyte infiltration in obstructive nephropathy. Sulfatide has been demonstrated to bind specifically to L-selectin and P-selectin (15.Suzuki Y. Toda Y. Tamatani T. Watanabe T. Suzuki T. Nakao T. Murase K. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Tadano-Aritomi K.

In fact, sulfatide appears to regulate inflammation and tumor metastasis mediated by P-selectin. Mulligan et al. (40.Mulligan M.S. Miyasaka M. Suzuki Y. Kawashima H. Iizuka M. Hasegawa A. Kiso M. Warner R.L. Ward P.A. Suzuki T. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1107-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) showed the preventive effect of sulfatide in P-selectin-dependent lung injury. On the other hand, Borsig et al. (41.Borsig L. Wong R. Hynes R.O. Varki N.M. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2193-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) reported that sulfatide on tumor cells serves as a P-selectin ligand and facilitates tumor metastasis by interaction with platelets leading to tumor microemboli. The present study provided in vivo evidence that sulfatide plays a critical role as an L-selectin-binding molecule during the process of inflammation. In conclusion, we demonstrated that sulfatide is a major L-selectin-binding molecule in the kidney and mediates monocyte infiltration in obstructive nephropathy. Our results suggest that blockade of the interaction of sulfatide and L-selectin could be a potentially useful strategy for the treatment of interstitial nephritis. We thank Dr. F. G.

In an attempt to elucidate the specific role of caspase-7 we generated a chicken DT40 cell line in which both alleles of the gene were disrupted. Viability assays showed that caspase-7–/– clones are more resistant to the common apoptosis-inducing drugs etoposide and staurosporine. Caspase-7–/– cells show a delay in phosphatidylserine externalization and DNA fragmentation as well as cleavage of the caspase substrates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 and lamins B1 and B2. Caspase affinity labeling and activity assays indicated that deficient cells exhibit a delay in caspase activation compared with wild type DT40 cells, providing an explanation for the differences in apoptotic execution between caspase-7 null and wild type DT40 cells.

These results strongly suggest that caspase-7 is involved earlier than other effector caspases in the apoptotic execution process in DT40 B lymphocytes. The first significant progress in understanding apoptosis came from studies of developmental cell death in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (1.Ellis R.E. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar), where genetic analysis revealed that the worm CED-3 gene encodes an enzyme that is an essential executor of apoptosis (2.Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). Mammalian counterparts of CED-3 have been identified as members of a family of intra-cellular proteases called caspases that are an integral part of the apoptotic machinery (3.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar, 4.Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev.

Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6296) Google Scholar). 13 caspases have been identified to date. In vivo and in vitro studies have grouped them into two main categories, initiator caspases, which transduce various signals into proteolytic activity, and effector caspases, which are responsible for the bulk of the proteolytic cleavages observed during apoptosis (3.Thornberry N.A.

We recently found that caspase-6–/– chicken DT40 B lymphocytes undergo a kinetically and morphologically normal apoptotic response to the topoisomerase II poison etoposide (22.Ruchaud S. Korfali N.

Further analysis demonstrated that activation of caspase-3 was normal in the caspase-6–/– cells. Although many studies point to a critical role for caspase-3 in mammalian cell apoptosis, caspase-3 knockout mice have developmental defects mainly in the central nervous system (23.Kuida K.

The requirement for caspase-3 for apoptotic execution varies in a stimulus- and tissue-specific manner (10.Woo M. Hakem R. Soengas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian A. Kägi D. Hakem A. McCurrach M. Khoo W.

Other studies have suggested that caspase-7 might have a unique role during apoptosis. Caspase-7 appears to be essential for the clonal deletion of autoreactive B cells by B cell receptor cross-linking (28.Nitta T. Igarashi K. Yamashita A. Yamamoto M. Yamamoto N. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). IgM treatment of immature B lymphocytes causes growth arrest and caspase-7 activation independently of caspase-8 activation and cytochrome c release (29.Ruiz-Vela A. Gonzalez de Buitrago G. Martinez A.C. Le X.F. Marcelli M. McWatters A. Nan B. Mills G.B. O'Brian C.A. Bast Jr, R.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4988-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, B cell receptor cross-linking induces the selective activation of caspase-7 but not caspase-3 (30.Bras A. Ruiz-Vela A. Gonzalez de Buitrago G. Martinez A.C. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). More recently, caspase-7 activation was reported in T and B cells undergoing apoptosis under conditions in which the classical apoptosome/caspase-9 pathway was inactivated by targeted deletion of Apaf-1 (31.Marsden V.S. O'Connor L. O'Reilly L.A. Silke J. Metcalf D. Ekert P.G. Huang D.C. Cecconi F. Kuida K. Tomaselli K.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Vaux D.L. Bouillet P. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Nature. 2002; 419: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Targeted gene disruption studies have identified differential requirements for caspases-1, -2, -3, -8, -9, -11, and -12 during development, homeostasis, and disease (32.Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 33.Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar). However, at least one research group has reported an inability to determine the exact functions of caspase-7 because nullizygous embryos died early during embryogenesis (32.Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 34.Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Momoi T. Srinivasan A. Nicholson D.W. Lazebnik Y. Flavell R.A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We therefore exploited the powerful DT40 knockout system to elucidate the function of this caspase during the apoptotic process. We report here the derivation of a number of DT40 clones in which the caspase-7 gene has been disrupted. Our results show that, unexpectedly, caspase-7 is required for the early stages of apoptosis in these cells. Cell Culture—Chicken B lymphoma cell line DT40 was cultured as described previously (35.Buerstedde J.-M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Cell viability was assessed using trypan blue staining under phase-contrast microscopy. Targeted Disruption of the Caspase-7 Gene—A 19-kb fragment containing part of the caspase-7 gene locus isolated from a λ FIX II DT40 genomic library using chicken caspase-7 cDNA 5′- and 3′-ends as probes was fully sequenced and used to construct the targeting vectors. A 3-kb arm upstream of the first codon found in the cloned genomic sequence and a 2-kb fragment downstream of the stop codon were amplified by PCR. The knockout vectors were obtained by inserting a blasticidin or histidinol resistance cassette between the 5′- and 3′-arms. The knockout constructs (25 μg each) were linearized with XhoI and used to electroporate 2 × 106 DT40 cells (950 microfarads; 300 V on a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser system). Stable transfectants were selected by limiting dilution in 25 μg/ml blasticidin or 1 mg/ml histidinol for 5–7 days. After amplification of resistant clones, DNA was extracted and analyzed by Southern blotting. The 3′-genomic external probe was amplified by PCR. Southern Blot Analysis and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Genomic DNA (5 μg) was digested with EcoRI, separated on an agarose gel, transferred to Hybond N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and subjected to Southern blotting. Hybridization was performed in 1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, SDS 7% at 65 °C using an external 3′-probe labeled by random primer extension (Amersham Biosciences). Caspase-7 mRNA expression was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR using 1 μg of total RNA and oligonucleotide primers designed to amplify the caspase-7 open reading frame. Cell Viability, TUNEL and Annexin V Assays—Cell viability was assessed after a 24-h treatment with etoposide or staurosporine using a colorimetric assay (WST-1 from Roche Applied Science). TUNEL (Roche Applied Science) and annexin V (BioVision) assays were performed at various times after treatment with etoposide or staurosporine and analyzed by FACS (FACSCalibur flow cytometer; BD Biosciences). Data were acquired and analyzed using CellQuest software. DNA Fragmentation Analysis—Cells or nuclei were pelleted and disrupted immediately in DNA lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 0.5% SDS). After DNase-free RNase was added to 20 μg/ml, lysates were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and then treated with 100 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C overnight. The DNA was extracted with phenol, pelleted with 2 volumes of ethanol and 0.1 volume of 10 m ammonium acetate, dissolved in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA), and separated on a 1.5% agarose gel. Preparation of Cell Extracts—Cytosolic extracts were prepared from untreated and apoptotic wild type, heterozygote, and knockout DT40 cells (expressing or not expressing a rescue construct). Cells were treated with 10 μm etoposide for 30 min to 6 h, pelleted, and washed once in PBS and once in KPM buffer (50 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm cytochalasin B, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin). Cells were then lysed by three freeze/thaw cycles, sonicated, and centrifuged at 190,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The clear supernatant was collected, aliquoted, and frozen at –80 °C. Preparation of HeLa Nuclei and in Vitro Apoptosis Induction—HeLa nuclei were prepared as described previously (36.Wood E.R. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2839-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To induce apoptosis under cell-free conditions, nuclei were washed twice in MDB buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) before the addition of apoptotic extracts and an ATP regenerating system (2 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 50 μm creatine kinase). Mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h then lysed in Laemmli buffer for immunoblotting (see below). Immunoblotting and Antibodies—Cytosolic extracts (30 μg of protein) or whole cell lysates (from 1 million cells) were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and stained with Ponceau S (Sigma). Membranes blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS were incubated with specific antibody diluted in PBS and 2% milk for 3 h at 25 °C. After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 25 °C. Each step was followed by three washes for 10 min in PBS and 5% milk. Bound antibody was detected using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Monoclonal antibody to chicken lamin B2 was obtained from Pr. Reimer Stick. Monoclonal antibody to chicken lamin B1, polyclonal antibody to human PARP (9542), and monoclonal antibody to human α-tubulin (clone B512) were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc., Cell Signaling Technology, and Sigma, respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to chicken caspase-7 (R1106) was raised against the large subunit of caspase-7 expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Immunoprecipitations were performed from cytosolic extracts (5 mg of protein) using the anti-caspase-7 (R1106) cross-linked to sheep anti-rabbit IgG-covered beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dynal Biotech). Caspase Affinity Labeling and Activity Analysis—Cytosolic extracts (30 μg of protein) were incubated in 1 μm zEK(bio)D-aomk (Peptide Institute, Kyoto, Japan) for 15 min at 37 °C before being boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After transfer and blocking in PBS and 5% milk, membranes were incubated with horse-radish peroxidase-linked streptavidin (Sigma) for 3 h at 25 °C, washed, and reacted with ECL. Cleavage of DEVD-AFC (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), VEID-AFC, and LEHD-AFC (Enzyme Systems Products, Dublin, CA) was assayed as described previously (17.Martins L.M. Kottke T. Mesner P.W. Basi G.S.

In brief, 25 μg of cytosolic protein in 50 μl of buffer A (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5 at 4 °C), 5 mm MgCl2, 1mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) or 0 μg of protein (as a blank) was diluted with 225 μl of freshly prepared buffer B (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 100 μm substrate and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After reactions were terminated by addition of 1.225 ml of ice-cold buffer B, fluorescence was measured using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and emission wavelength of 475 nm. Standards containing 0–15 nmol of AFC were utilized to determine the amount of fluorochrome released. Generation of Caspase-7-deficient DT40 Clones—An EST clone obtained from the Delaware University chicken EST bank and containing the complete cDNA sequence of chicken caspase-7, was used to generate different probes to screen a genomic DT40 phage library. After a phage clone containing part of the caspase-7 locus was isolated and sequenced, the positions of the exons were determined by comparison with the cDNA sequence. The phage sequence covers the last 5 exons of the gene locus, excluding the 5′-end of the gene (Fig. 1A). To disrupt the caspase-7 gene, we constructed targeting vectors in which a resistance cassette (blasticidin or histidinol) was flanked by a 5′-genomic arm situated upstream of the first exon found in the phage clone and a 3′-genomic arm situated downstream of the stop codon (Fig. 1A). Targeted integration of these constructs, which were termed Casp7blast and Casp7his, respectively, would remove a 3,700-bp gene fragment containing the majority of the open reading frame (786 of 930 bp). After insertion of these vectors, only the first 13 amino acids of the enzyme prodomain and 3 amino acids of the large subunit could potentially be expressed, giving a peptide highly unlikely to be functional. The deletion was performed by homologous recombination in the chicken B cell lymphoma line DT40. After wild type DT40 cells were transfected with the Casp7his construct, histidinolresistant clones were obtained. Targeted events were recognized by Southern blot analysis of EcoRI-digested DNA and the use of a 3′-external probe. The probe recognizes an 11-kb band corresponding to the wild type allele and a 4.3-kb band after targeted integration of the Casp7blast or Casp7his construct (Fig. 1B). Putative targeting events were further verified by Southern blot analysis using an external genomic 5′-probe (data not shown). Several of these heterozygous clones were then transfected with the Casp7blast construct to delete the second allele. The targeting efficiency for the first allele of 1.4% was similar for both knockout constructs. Because the targeting efficiency for the second allele was an unexpectedly high 10%, many independent caspase-7-deficient clones were isolated. The loss of caspase-7 expression was then confirmed by immunoblotting and reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 1, C and D). Fig. 1D is representative of three experiments in which we detected the caspase-7 mRNA in wild type DT40 cells. We could never detect caspase-7 mRNA in heterozygous cells. This suggests that caspase-7 mRNA is expressed at very low levels in DT40 cells, and this was confirmed by comparison with other chicken cell lines (data not shown). The caspase-7 mRNA was easily detectable in caspase-7–/– cells overexpressing either untagged chicken caspase-7 or the chicken caspase-7 cDNA fused at its C terminus to EGFP (Fig. 1D, lanes 6 and 7). To confirm the effect of the gene knockout on caspase-7 protein levels, we performed the immunoblotting experiment shown in Fig. 1C. Procaspase-7 was observed very faintly in immunoblots of DT40 cells after immunoprecipitation from cytosolic extracts containing 5 mg of protein from apoptotic cells (lane 1). The antibody recognizes the cleaved form better than the pro-form of caspase-7 and could not detect the protein in nonapoptotic DT40 cells. Importantly, the protein could not be detected in lysates from caspase-7 knockout cells. Caspase-7-deficient DT40 Cells Show Increased Resistance to Apoptosis—Caspase-7+/– and caspase-7–/– cells proliferated at a rate similar to wild type DT40 cells (Fig. 2A). To examine whether caspase-7 deletion affected resistance of the cells to proapoptotic stimuli, we assayed cell viability 24 h after initiating treatment with different concentrations of etoposide in wild type cells and two independent clones each of caspase-7+/– and caspase-7–/– cells (Fig. 2B). Both types of caspase-7-deficient clones were 3.5 to 4.5 times more resistant to the drug than wild type cells tested in parallel. The IC50 values for the wild type, caspase-7+/–, and caspase-7–/– cells were 1.35 ± 0.10, 5.25 ± 0.15, and 7.75 ± 0.15 μm, respectively (Fig. 2B). Resistance of caspase-7+/– and caspase-7–/– cells was likewise observed after treatment with staurosporine, another inducer of apoptosis in DT40 cells (data not shown). Although we were surprised that the heterozygous clones showed a phenotype similar to the knockout cells, this resistance could explain the higher targeting efficiency obtained for the second allele if heterozygous cells were also more resistant to apoptosis during electroporation. Four independent heterozygous clones were tested in viability assays similar to those shown in Fig. 2 with comparable results. This appears to confirm that caspase-7 is haploinsufficient and to rule out the possibility of clonal variability. To confirm that this drug resistance phenotype was a direct result of the caspase-7 gene deletion, caspase-7–/– cells were transfected with a construct containing the chicken caspase-7 cDNA fused at its C terminus to EGFP and under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. After cells containing the cDNA were selected, clones expressing the transgene were identified based on fluorescence of the caspase-7-EGFP fusion protein. Caspase-7-EGFP appears to be overexpressed roughly 5–10-fold in these cells but is fully processed during apoptosis (Fig. 1C). We have shown elsewhere that EGFP is cleaved very near its N terminus in apoptotic cells, and this explains why the caspase-7 has a normal mobility in these extracts (22.Ruchaud S. Korfali N. Villa P. Kottke T.J. Dingwall C. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1967-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Cell viability assays were performed by comparing caspase-7–/–-casp-7-EGFP clones with the wild type cells and a third caspase-7–/– clone (Fig. 2C). In all cases, transfection with caspase-7–/–-casp-7-EGFP restored drug sensitivity to levels observed in wild type cells. This rescue of the phenotype by expression of an exogenous caspase-7 in caspase-7–/– cells confirmed that the drug-resistance phenotype arose as a result of the deletion of the caspase-7 locus. Caspase-7-deficient Cells Show Delayed DNA Fragmentation during Apoptotic Execution—Because caspase-7 has been viewed as an effector caspase, we examined terminal events in the apoptotic process in parental and caspase-7–/– cells. At various times after treatment with etoposide, cellular DNA was extracted and examined for internucleosomal cleavage (Fig. 3A), a classical feature of apoptotic execution (38.Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (6728) Google Scholar). The onset of DNA fragmentation was delayed ∼2 h after the addition of etoposide in two different knockout clones relative to wild type cells. This delay was no longer visible by 3 h after the addition of etoposide. To obtain a more quantitative determination of the lag in endonuclease activation, we turned to the use of the TUNEL technique and FACS analysis (Fig. 3B). The results revealed a clear delay of TUNEL staining in the caspase-7–/– cells compared with wild type. 90 min after the addition of etoposide, 30% of wild type cells were TUNEL-positive, whereas this same percentage was only reached by the knockout cells after 5 h of etoposide treatment. This delay was caused by disruption of the caspase-7 gene, as expression of the caspase-7-EGFP fusion protein in the caspase-7–/– cells largely eliminated the delay (Fig. 3B). Because we have shown previously (19.Samejima K. Tone S. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol.

Human intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes physiologically exhibit minimal proliferation in response to antigen receptor stimulation when compared with peripheral blood T-lymphocytes. This hyporeactivity is partially abolished in inflammatory bowel disease. We hypothesized that differences in Ca2+ signaling could be related to the disease. To test this possibility, we measured Ca2+ signals in identified lymphocytes from human blood and human intestinal mucosa. Ca2+ signals in lamina propria T-lymphocytes from non-inflamed tissue were drastically reduced when compared with Ca2+ signals of blood T-lymphocytes from the same persons. However, Ca2+ signals in T-lymphocytes from inflamed intestinal mucosa were much higher than the ones from non-inflamed mucosa and almost reached levels of Ca2+ signals in peripheral blood T-cells. Furthermore, Ca2+ influx was closely linked to cell proliferation in both peripheral blood T-lymphocytes and lamina propria lymphocytes cells. We conclude that differences in Ca2+ signaling can explain the differences of T-lymphocyte reactivity in blood versus lamina propria and, importantly, also between T-lymphocytes from inflamed and non-inflamed intestinal mucosa. Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane of T-lymphocytes might thus prove an excellent target to screen for immunosuppressiva to potentially treat the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.

Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane following stimulation of Jurkat T-cells or peripheral blood T-lymphocytes is a necessary signal for T-cell activation (1Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev.

Ins-1,4,5-P3 initiates Ca2+ signaling in T-cells by two coupled processes: Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptor channel and subsequent activation of plasma membrane Ca2+ channels. Activation of the Ca2+ channels is dependent on the Ca2+ filling state of the endoplasmic reticulum. A low Ca2+ concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum provides the signal to activate the plasma membrane Ca2+ channels, whereas a high Ca2+ concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum terminates the response (2Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 199-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). These channels are therefore referred to as store-operated Ca2+ channels. In T-lymphocytes, the store-operated Ca2+ channels are highly Ca2+ selective (3Hoth M. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and are also termed CRAC channels (1Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev.

Immunol. 2001; 31: 1228-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). T-lymphocytes from inflamed tissue are hyperreactive and reach proliferation rates comparable to blood T-lymphocytes following TCR stimulation (12Pirzer U. Schonhaar A. Fleischer B. Hermann E. Meyer zumüschenfelde B K.-H. Lancet. 1991; 338: 1238-1239Abstract PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The reason for the differences in reactivity of PB and LP T-cells is not known. Because Ca2+ signals are closely linked with activation and proliferation of T-cells (1Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 497-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 7Fanger C.M. Hoth M. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that differences in Ca2+ signaling in LP T-cells could explain their hyporeactivity (compared with PB T-cells) and also their hyperreactivity in inflamed tissue. We developed protocols that allowed us to measure Ca2+ signals in identified T-cells from the intestinal mucosa and peripheral blood of healthy individuals and patients with active IBD. We found that store-operated Ca2+ influx correlated well with the reactivity of the cells and that the amplitude of Ca2+ signals due to Ca2+ influx was linked to the proliferative response of the cells. Our results explain the differences of reactivity found in intestinal T-lymphocytes from inflamed and non-inflamed tissues. Isolation of Lamina Propria Lymphocytes (LPLs) and Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes (PBLs)—LPLs were obtained from 6–8 mucosa biopsies taken from colonoscopic examinations. Biopsies were washed three times in HBSS (PAA Laboratories GmbH, catalog number H15-009). The mucosa was cut into little pieces and shaken for 3 h at 37 °C in collagenase medium of the following composition: 500 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, catalog number 21875-034); 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), catalog number 10270-106); 2.5 ml of gentamycin (Biochrom, catalog number A2710); 1 ml of amphotericin B (500x, Roche Applied Science, catalog number 14977600); 12.5 ml of HEPES (1 m); 0.5 ml of mercaptoethanol (0.5 m), 5 ml of collagenase (10 mg/ml, Biochrom, collagenase-type CLS III (141 units/mg), catalog number C3-22); 5 ml of trypsin inhibitor (10 mg/ml, Sigma, trypsin inhibitor from Glyxine max (soybean), type I-S, product number T6522); 5 ml of DNase I (10 mg/ml, Roche Applied Science, DNase I from bovine pancreas (100 mg), catalog number 1284932); 50 units/ml penicillin; and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, catalog number 15140-122). Following digestion, the suspension was carefully sucked through a syringe to disrupt the remaining tissue. Cells were separated from larger mucosa remnants by filtration through a 70 μm cell sieve. The suspension was then centrifuged for 10 min at 360 × g at room temperature. The pellet was resuspended in 30% Percoll (Amersham Biosciences, catalog number 17-0891-01, diluted with 0.9% NaCl) and layered over a 70% Percoll solution. The following density centrifugation for 20 min at 1230 × g yielded a population of mononuclear cells at the interface. Cells were carefully recovered and washed twice in medium by centrifugation at 360 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Before use, cells were kept for 1–8 h at 37 °C in culture medium at a concentration of 1 million/ml. PBLs were obtained from fresh blood anti-coagulated with heparin. 10 ml of blood was diluted with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen, catalog number 14190-094) and layered over Ficoll (Ficoll-Paque Plus, Amersham Biosciences, catalog number 17-1440-03). Density centrifugation for 20 min at 1230 × g yielded a population of mononuclear cells at the interface. The following isolation steps were equal to those described for LPL isolation. For proliferation experiments, PBLs were purified from leukocyte reduction filters from the local blood bank. Cells were collected by back-flushing the filter with 120 ml of HBSS (PAA, catalog number 15-009). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by a density gradient centrifugation at 450 × g for 30 min at room temperature (Ficoll-Paque Plus, Amersham Biosciences, catalog number 17144002) in 50 ml of Leucosep tubes (Greiner, catalog number 227290). The peripheral blood mononuclear cell layer was washed in HBSS. Remaining red blood cells were removed by the addition of 3 ml of lysis buffer (155 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm KHCO3, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.3) for 3 min. After lysis, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were washed with HBSS (200 × g for 10 min at room temperature). Viability of the cells was checked by staining with trypan blue. Cells were further purified by adhering to plastic for 24 h in RPMI 1640 complete medium at 37 °C (1.5 × 106 cells/ml). Non-adherent cells, mostly PBLs, were collected and used for proliferation assays. Ca2+ Imaging—Cells were loaded at 22–23°C for 20 min with 1 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) in medium with 10 mm HEPES added, washed with fresh medium, stored at room temperature for 10 min, and immediately used. Cells were allowed to adhere to poly-l-ornithine-coated (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma) glass coverslip chambers on the stage of an Olympus IX 70 microscope equipped with a ×40 Uplan/Apo (numerical aperture 1.0) objective. Cells were alternately illuminated at 340 and 380 nm with the Polychrome IV monochromator (TILL Photonics). The fluorescence emissions at λ > 440 nm were captured with a CCD camera (TILL Imago), digitized, and analyzed using TILL Vision software (TILL Photonics). Ratio images were recorded at intervals of 5 s. [Ca2+]i was estimated from the relation [Ca2+]i = K*(R - Rmin)/(Rmax - R) where the values of K*, Rmin, and Rmax were determined from an in situ calibration of Fura-2/AM in Jurkat T-cells as described previously (18Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ca2+ Ringer's solution contained (in mm): 155 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2,10 d-glucose, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). CaCl2 was replaced by MgCl2 in the Ca2+-free Ringer's solution with 1 mm EGTA added. Thapsigargin (1 μm, stock 1 mm in Me2SO, Molecular Probes) and anti-CD3 (OKT-3) monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml, stock at 4 mg/ml, obtained from the hybridoma OKT-3, ATCC) were used to stimulate the cells. A sandwiched self-made chamber was used for all of the measurements, which allowed for a complete solution exchange <1 s. Identification of T-lymphocytes—To allow identification of different subtypes of lymphocytes, cells were stained with anti-CD3-PE, anti-CD4-Cy5, and anti-CD8-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibodies (diluted 1:12 in 0.9% NaCl containing 3% fetal bovine serum, Dako) on the stage of the microscope following the Ca2+-imaging experiment. After 5–10 min, the antibody solution was washed away with Ringer's solution. Standard HQ filter sets (AHF Analysentechnik) were used for identification of cells, which were excited with the Polychrome IV monochromator at 480 nm (fluorescein isothiocyanate), 540 nm (PE), or 620 nm (Cy5). Proliferation Assays—Proliferation experiments using the EZ4U assay were carried out in 96-well cell culture plates (BD Biosciences, catalog number 353072, flat bottom), and data points were measured as triplicates. 50,000 PBLs were cultured in a total volume of 200 μl in each well. Cells were stimulated using 5 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma, catalog number P1585) and 0.5 μm ionomycin (Sigma, catalog number I0634). Plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity. After incubation time, the number of living cells was determined by the reduction of the tetrazolium salt EZ4U to formazan derivatives (Biozol, catalog number BI-5000). 20 μl of EZ4U reagent was added to each well, and plates were incubated for another 4 h. Optical density was measured in a ELX800UV universal microplate reader (BIO-TEK Instruments) at wavelength settings of 465–630 nm. For proliferation experiments using [3H]thymidine incorporation, 5 × 104 purified cells were added in 0.2 ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2% l-glutamine, and antibiotics. After 96-h incubation at 37 °C, 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine was incorporated over a 6-h period before harvesting the cells (Inotec, Wohlen, Switzerland). [3H]Thymidine incorporation was measured in a liquid scintillation spectrometer (Beckmann, Munich, Germany). All of the assays were performed in triplets, and the results differed by <15%. To analyze the impact of [Ca2+]i on cell proliferation, the Ca2+ concentration in the medium was modified by adding extra Ca2+ or EGTA. Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using TILL Vision, Igor Pro (Wavemetrics), and Microsoft Excel. Averages are presented as the mean ± S.E. For statistical analysis, an unpaired two-sided Student's t test was used. Data were considered significantly different if p was smaller than 0.01. To allow Ca2+ measurements in identified T-lymphocytes from intestinal mucosa and peripheral blood without potential pre-activation of the cells, separation steps of the cells with antibodies through magnetic beads or FACS were avoided. A protocol was developed that allowed parallel Ca2+ imaging and identification of the same cells with up to three different antibodies after the experiment. Fig. 1 shows a typical example of such a LPL experiment with an infrared picture (A), [Ca2+]i measurements of cells at one time point (B), and resulting [Ca2+]i traces for two of the cells over time (C). To enable identification of T-cell subtypes, cells were stained on the stage of the microscope with anti-CD3, anti-CD4, and anti-CD8, respectively (D–F). To activate store-operated Ca2+ channels, cells were stimulated with 1 μm TG in Ca2+-free Ringer's solution. TG fully inhibits the SERCA Ca2+-ATPases of the endoplasmic reticulum, causing a small transient rise in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1C) due to the unopposed leakage of Ca2+ from stores followed by extrusion across the plasma membrane. Depletion of Ca2+ stores by this method maximally activates store-operated Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane, also referred to as CRAC channels in T-lymphocytes (4Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar, 5Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). No Ca2+ entry through the channels is observed during TG stimulation when the extracellular solution does not contain any Ca2+. Changing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration to 1 mm following complete store depletion, then allows Ca2+ influx through store-operated Ca2+ channels, giving rise to long-lasting Ca2+ signals in T-cells (Fig. 1C). To compare LP T-cells, which are hyporeactive, with “normal” reactive PB T-cells, we isolated PBLs from the same patients. PBLs were analyzed using exactly the same protocol applied for the LPLs in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 compares the Ca2+ signals of LPLs and PBLs grouped into CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Fig. 2, A and B, shows representative experiments, and the statistical analysis of all of the experiments is presented in Fig. 2C. PB T-cells display larger Ca2+ signals following activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry through CRAC Ca2+ channels than LP T-cells (p < 0.0001). This is true for CD4+ and CD8+ cells, whereas in general, CD4+ cells respond slightly but significantly better than CD8+ cells (p < 0.01). The larger Ca2+ signals in PB T-cells correlate well with their reactivity and proliferation following activation of the cells, whereas the smaller Ca2+ signals in LP T-cells correlate with their previously described hyporeactivity (11Zeitz M. Quinn T.C. Graeff A.S. James S.P. Gastroenterology. 1988; 94: 353-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We did not observe differences in resting Ca2+ levels between LP and PB T-cells, which have been reported by another group (19De Maria R. Fais S. Silvestri M. Frati L. Pallone F. Santoni A. Testi R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 3104-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy was not further investigated. It is noteworthy, however, that we observed higher LPL resting Ca2+ signals when the cell preparation was not optimal, which was evident by a very low yield of cells and many debris and “degranulated” cells. Whereas LP T-cells of healthy individuals are hyporeactive, this is completely changed in T-cells from inflamed tissue of patients with active IBD. In the latter case, the T-cells proliferate quite well and almost reach rates comparable with “normal” reactive PB T-cells. Considering the importance of intracellular Ca2+ signals for T-cell proliferation, we hypothesized that Ca2+ signals in T-cells from inflamed tissue could be increased, thus explaining the higher proliferation rates. Fig. 3 summarizes our evidence that TG-induced Ca2+ signals are indeed increased in LP T-cells from inflamed mucosa. In Fig. 3A, LP T-cells from inflamed and non-inflamed intestine of the same patient were compared with his PB T-cells. All of the CD8+-positive cells of this patient were pooled, revealing a clear difference of Ca2+ signals between LP T-cells of non-inflamed and inflamed mucosa, the latter of which reached Ca2+ concentrations almost as high as the respective PB CD8+ T-cells. The same was found for the CD4+ cells of the patient (data not shown). In Fig. 3B, the CD3+ T-cells from all of the patients are compared. Ca2+ signals due to Ca2+ influx are clearly enhanced in LP T-cells from inflamed tissue versus non-inflamed tissue and reach levels of Ca2+ signals in PB T-cells. Ca2+ signals in PB T-cells did not differ between cells from IBD and non-IBD individuals. Fig. 3, C and D, depicts the statistical analysis of the Ca2+ peak and plateau for the different T-cell populations analyzed. In CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells as well as in CD3+ CD4- CD8- T-cells, we found the same pattern. Whereas Ca2+ peak and plateau in all of the LP T-cell subpopulations from non-inflamed tissue are significantly lower than the signals from the respective PB T-cell subpopulations (p < 0.0001), Ca2+ signals in LP T-cells from inflamed tissue are significantly increased compared with the ones from non-inflamed tissue (p < 0.01 for Ca2+ peak and plateau) and almost reach levels of Ca2+ signals in PB T-cells. These findings correlate well with the hyperreactivity of LP T-cells from inflamed intestine of individuals with active IBD. TG induces a complete depletion of Ca2+ stores and thus allows us to study the maximal Ca2+ entry through store-operated Ca2+ channels independent of the activation of TCR-dependent signaling cascades. Activation of the TCR through OKT-3, which binds to CD3, also induces Ca2+ signaling in T-lymphocytes but only partially depletes Ca2+ stores because the released Ca2+ can be pumped back into the Ca2+ stores by the SERCA ATPases. TCR stimulation by 10 μg/ml OKT-3 in Ca2+-free Ringer's solution induces Ca2+ release transients because of the generation of Ins-1,4,5-P3, which releases Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum stores and subsequent re-uptake of Ca2+ into the stores or clearance of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. Fig. 4A shows examples of LP and PB T-cells to illustrate typical response patterns. In cells that do not show release transients in response to OKT-3 (one of the LP T-cells, thin solid line), only very little influx is observed. The influx is clearly enhanced when OKT-3 stimulation induces a Ca2+ release spike, thereby partially depleting Ca2+ stores that then results in activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry. The release transients due to OKT-3 stimulation can occur at different times (Fig. 4A) and are therefore not visible in the Ca2+ traces when averaging cells (Fig. 4B). We compared LP and PB T-cells from the same individuals. Approximately 44% PB T-cells from healthy individuals or patients with IBD showed clear Ca2+ release transients during the OKT-3 application and were counted as responders and used for the average in Fig. 4B. In contrast, only 16% of the LP T-cells from healthy individuals or patients with IBD responded to OKT-3 stimulation. Comparing the Ca2+ influx signals of PB and LP responders, we again observed that the Ca2+ peak and plateau following Ca2+ influx in responding LP T-cells was lower than that in the responding PB T-cells (p < 0.01, Fig. 4B, statistics on the calcium plateau in 4C). Similar to the TG stimulation protocol, Ca2+ peak and plateau following influx were enhanced in LP T-cells from patients with active IBD compared with LP T-cells from non-IBD individuals (p < 0.01). Surprisingly, we also found an influx increase in PB T-cells from patients with active IBD when compared with PB T-cells from healthy individuals (p < 0.01), which was not observed following TG stimulation. The reason for this difference is currently unknown but could result from the T-cells of the IBD patients being already activated. To link the observed differences in Ca2+ signaling between LP T-lymphocytes from persons with and without active IBD to T-cell function, we analyzed the importance of Ca2+ entry for cell proliferation. Proliferation of PBL and LPL cells were analyzed while varying the net Ca2+ influx rate through changes in the extracellular Ca2+ concentration (details are described in the figure legend). Fig. 5A illustrates the strong dependence of PBL proliferation rates on the external Ca2+ concentration. Free [Ca2+]ext below 100 μm is not sufficient to induce the full proliferative response of PBLs, even when a strong stimulus (PMA, ionomycin) was used. Using TG or OKT-3 as a stimulus, cell proliferation was also completely blocked by low micromolar [Ca2+]ext (Fig. 5B), whereas it could be slightly enhanced by adding 1 mm Ca2+ to the medium, indicating that proliferation in PBL depends on the external Ca2+ concentration and therefore on net Ca2+ entry. The same pattern was found in LPL cells using TG as stimulus (Fig. 5C), the overall proliferation rates, however, being much smaller. The proliferation rates in LPL cells from inflamed tissue were found to be higher than the ones of LPL cells from non-inflamed tissue. These results link Ca2+ signals in PBL cells, LPL cells, and LPL cells from inflamed mucosa with cell proliferation and the immune response. It can be speculated that reduced Ca2+ signals are causally related to cell hyporeactivity LPL cells from healthy individuals, whereas the enhanced Ca2+ signals might well account for the pathological hyperreactivity of LPLs from patients with active IBD. Several groups have shown that T-lymphocytes of the intestinal mucosa are hyporeactive and respond with low proliferative response and low transcriptional activity upon antigen presentation (11Zeitz M. Quinn T.C. Graeff A.S. James S.P. Gastroenterology. 1988; 94: 353-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 17Stallmach A. Giese T. Pfister K. Wittig B.M. Kunne S. Humphries M.

Immunol. 1995; 102: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). In contrast, T-lymphocytes from peripheral blood are able to react with strong proliferative activity upon antigen stimulation. The hyporeactivity of intestinal T-cells is one mechanism likely to avoid pathologic inflammatory responses in the intestine, which is continuously exposed to antigen. The molecular mechanism for the different reactivity of LP and PB T-cells is unclear. Because elevations of [Ca2+]i have been closely linked to activity and proliferation of T-lymphocytes (1Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 497-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 7Fanger C.M. Hoth M. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 10Feske S. Giltnane J. Dolmetsch R. Staudt L.M. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), we compared Ca2+ signals in resting and activated LP and PB T-cells. We found resting [Ca2+]i levels to be similar in LP and PB T-cells following stimulation; however, PB T-cells reached much higher [Ca2+]i levels than LP T-cells, which correlate well with their proliferative responses. Ca2+ signals in LP T-cells from inflamed tissue were drastically increased, which could explain the enhanced T-cell proliferation described in those cells. The increased responsiveness of LP T-cells from inflamed tissue could be attributed to infiltration of the lamina propria by PB T-cells or to increased Ca2+ influx of the resident LP T-cells themselves. It has been shown that lymphocytes, which are primed and differentiated in Peyer's patches and in mesenteric lymph nodes, migrate into the blood stream and preferentially return to Peyer's patches or the lamina propria of the gut (22Westermann J. Engelhardt B. Hoffmann J.C. Ann. Intern. Med. 2001; 135: 279-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 23Mowat McI. A Nature Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Tissue-specific accumulation and proliferation of T-cells and/or proliferation of resident T-cells may both modulate chronic inflammation such as IBD. At present, we cannot distinguish whether the increased Ca2+ responses observed in LP T-cells from inflamed tissue are caused by infiltrating PB T-cells or resident LP T-cells. The only hint that we measure LP T-cells and not infiltrated PB T-cells in the inflamed tissue comes from the observation that the same amount of LP T-cells (16%) responds to OKT-3 stimulation in inflamed and non-inflamed tissue. De Maria et al. (19De Maria R. Fais S. Silvestri M. Frati L. Pallone F. Santoni A. Testi R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 3104-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) postulated that elevated resting levels of [Ca2+]i are responsible for the hyporeactivity of LP T-cells. They used FACS analysis to measure [Ca2+]i, which does not allow kinetic measurements of individual cells, limits resolution, and requires pre-labeling of cells that might pre-activate the cells. Using high resolution Ca2+ imaging, our kinetic analysis of individual T-cells did not reveal differences of resting [Ca2+]i between LP and PB T-cells from the same individuals. Pre-activation of the cells was also excluded by identification of the cells as T-lymphocytes after the Ca2+ measurements. We conclude that differences in resting Ca2+ levels cannot explain the differences of higher basal activity of LP T-cells versus PB T-cells. Similar to De Maria et al. (19De Maria R. Fais S. Silvestri M. Frati L. Pallone F. Santoni A. Testi R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 3104-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), Qiao et al. (24Qiao L. Schurmann G. Betzler M. Meuer S.C. Gastroenterology. 1991; 101: 1529-1536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) showed by FACS analysis that in contrast to PB T-cells, LP T-cells did not respond with [Ca2+]i elevations following stimulation of the cells. Analyzing single identified T-cells, we came to a different conclusion. Whereas Ca2+ release from stores was on average comparable in PB and LP T-cells following TG stimulation, only very few LP T-cells (16% compared with 44% PB T-cells) responded to TCR stimulation with clear Ca2+ release transients during the 500-s OKT-3 exposure. Ca2+ entry following activation of plasma Ca2+ channels by OKT-3 or thapsigargin was present in all of the LP T-cells, but it was clearly reduced when compared with PB T-cells. Because activity of the plasma membrane Ca2+ channels is closely correlated with T-cell activation and proliferation (7Fanger C.M. Hoth M. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the reduction of Ca2+ entry could explain the hyporeactivity of LP T-cells upon antigen stimulation. Recent publications highlight the importance of Ca2+ signals for the induction of peripheral tolerance in T-cells. Macian et al. (25Macian F. Garcia-Cozar F. Im S.H. Horton H.F. Byrne M.C. Rao A. Cell. 2002; 109: 719-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) reported that TCR stimulation without co-stimulation strongly favors Ca2+-dependent signal transduction via nuclear factor of activated T-cells over other TCR-dependent signal transduction pathways, thereby inducing T-cell anergy, which is a tolerance mechanism in which T-cells are functionally inactivated (26Schwartz R.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 305-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). On the other hand, oral tolerance can also be associated with an impairment of Ca2+-dependent signal transduction (27Asai K. Hachimura S. Kimura M. Toraya T. Yamashita M. Nakayama T. Kaminogawa S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4723-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). At first sight, our results would better fit in with the latter observation. However, one can easily imagine that both mechanisms (25Macian F. Garcia-Cozar F. Im S.H. Horton H.F. Byrne M.C. Rao A. Cell. 2002; 109: 719-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 27Asai K. Hachimura S. Kimura M. Toraya T. Yamashita M. Nakayama T. Kaminogawa S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4723-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) could even co-exist in the same cell because Ca2+ can have very different specific cellular functions depending on kinetics, amplitude, and localization of the [Ca2+]i elevation (1Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 497-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 28Crabtree G.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 109: S67-S79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar, 29Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). How the molecular mechanism of mucosal T-cell hyporeactivity exactly works is still unknown, but it has been speculated that the microenvironment of the intestinal mucosa is important for the suppression of T-cell responses (30Qiao L. Schurmann G. Autschbach F. Wallich R. Meuer S.C. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 814-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Kellermann S.A. McEvoy L.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 682-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A continuous suboptimal stimulation by mucosal factors and/or antigen would be likely to induce the tolerance of mucosal T-lymphocytes. One could speculate that such a suboptimal stimulation leads to a reduction of Ca2+ influx through CRAC channels that in turn would suppress activation and proliferation of the cells following optimal TCR stimulation. Abnormal activity and proliferation of T-lymphocytes from the human intestinal lamina propria is thought to play an important role in IBD such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis (12Pirzer U.

Following TCR stimulation, the cells show abnormally high proliferation rates that are thought to be one reason for the constant intestinal inflammation. If our hypothesis that Ca2+ entry is closely linked to proliferation in LP T-cells were correct, we would expect to find increased Ca2+ entry in LP T-cells from inflamed tissue. Indeed, this was the case. Whereas the number of responding cells following TCR stimulation was not increased in T-cells from inflamed intestine, there was a clear increase of Ca2+ signals because of Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane following TCR or thapsigargin stimulation when compared with LP T-cells from non-inflamed tissue. This increase of [Ca2+]i following stimulation could explain the hyperreactivity of LP T-cells from inflamed intestine of patients with active IBD. Because enhanced proliferation of activated T-cells is believed to be one of the problems during IBD, decreasing Ca2+ influx could potentially also decrease inflammation in the intestine. An important question is how the higher Ca2+ signals in LP T-cells from patients with active IBD are generated. There are two principal possibilities to account for the differences. One is an increase of net influx, the other is a decrease of net efflux of Ca2+ from the cytosol. A change in the net efflux is not very likely because Ca2+ clearance rates were not different between PB and LP T-cells from healthy individuals or patients with active IBD. 2A. Schwarz and M. Hoth, unpublished data. This leaves increased Ca2+ entry as the best explanation, which could be achieved by higher expression of Ca2+ channels or expression of a different type of Ca2+ channels with higher Ca2+ permeability in the plasma membrane. Alternatively, an increase in the net Ca2+ influx rate could also be mediated by a more negative membrane potential of the cells. In any case, influx of Ca2+ through store-operated CRAC Ca2+ channels is increased in LP T-cells from inflamed tissue and reaches levels of PB T-cells, thus abolishing the hyporeactivity of the LP T-cells. Inhibition of store-operated Ca2+ entry in LP T-cells of patients with active IBD could decrease activation and proliferation of the cells leading to a reduction of intestinal inflammation. Their localization in the plasma membrane makes the CRAC Ca2+ channels in T-cells a good target for future immunosuppressiva to potentially treat the symptoms of IBD.

https://openalex.org/W2013559491,"We reconstituted a three-dimensional gastric carcinoma model similar to invasive gastric carcinoma tissue. This model consists of a human gastric carcinoma cell line, GCTM-1, a human fibroblast cell line, TIG-1-20, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-containing type I collagen gel. Using this model, we were able to observe the growth of the two cell types, especially carcinoma cell invasive growth, in real time for more than 30 days. TGF-β and TIG-1-20 were essential for GCTM-1 invasive growth and proliferation, respectively. TGF-β induced the enhanced expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) in GCTM-1 at both the protein and enzymatic activity levels. The TGF-β-induced invasion of GCTM-1 was inhibited by MMP9- or uPA-antisense (AS) oligonucleotide transfection to GCTM-1. When exogenous interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was added to this model, TGF-β-dependent GCTM-1 invasion was significantly inhibited, concomitant with the decreased expression of MMP9 and uPA. The intracellular signal transduction of Smad was examined to analyse the mechanism of the inhibitory effect of IFN-γ. TGF-β accelerated the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and nuclear translocation of the Smad2/3–Smad4 complex in GCTM-1, but these TGF-β-induced effects were significantly inhibited by IFN-γ-induced Smad7 expression. When GCTM-1 was cotransfected with AS oligonucleotide of Smad2 and Smad3, the TGF-β-induced invasion of GCTM-1 disappeared. In addition, the inhibitory effect of IFN-γ on TGF-β-dependent GCTM-1 invasion vanished by the AS oligonucleotide of Smad7 transfection. These results indicate that IFN-γ inhibits TGF-β-dependent GCTM-1 invasion through cross-talk in the Smad pathway. IFN-γ may be a new therapeutic tool for TGF-β-expressed invasive carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2051480140,"The ATM-dependent accumulation of p53 and induction of p21waf1 are key events for G1 cell-cycle checkpoint arrest following DNA damage. In ATM-null AT cells, even though the p53 and p21waf1 responses are kinetically delayed and quantitatively reduced, the G1 checkpoint is virtually disrupted, suggesting that these proteins arrive too late in G1 to enforce the arrest. As the precise mechanism remains unclear, we examined the response to DNA double-strand breaks generated by γ-radiation (IR), to determine if ATM deficiency affects the cell-cycle phase regulation of these molecules. We find that, after irradiation, whereas normal LCL-N cells markedly increase their levels of p53 in all phases of the cell cycle, AT cells fail to show any p53 increase in the G1 phase. In addition, whereas in LCL-N p21waf1 is induced in G1 and G2-M, in AT cells this induction is partly seen in G2-M, but not in G1, indicating a different cell-cycle phase regulation of p53 and p21waf1 as a result of ATM deficiency. The levels and catalytic activity of the p53-targeting kinases ATR and DNA-PK in LCL-N and AT cells are very similar throughout the cell cycle, both before and after IR, thus excluding a phase-specific activity for these kinases. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that, in ATM-deficient cells, the p53-dependent p21waf1 response to DNA damage is not only quantitatively reduced, but also specifically suppressed in the G1 phase, thus providing a mechanistic explanation for the severe disruption of the G1 checkpoint in AT cells."
https://openalex.org/W2085943117,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene expression is regulated post-transcriptionally by hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia. This regulation is dependent upon binding of protective trans-acting factors to a specific element in the PTH mRNA 3′-untranslated region (UTR). We have previously demonstrated that a 63-nucleotide (nt) AU-rich PTH mRNA element is sufficient to confer regulation of RNA stability by calcium and phosphate in an in vitro degradation assay (IVDA). The 63-nt element consists of a core 26-nt minimal binding sequence and flanking regions. We have now studied the functionality of this element in HEK293 cells using reporter genes and showed that it destabilizes mRNAs for green fluorescent protein (GFP) and growth hormone, similar to its effect in the IVDA. To understand how the cis-element functions as an instability element, we have analyzed its structure by RNase H, primer extension, and computer modeling. The results indicate that the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR and in particular the region of the cis-element are dominated by significant open regions with little folded base pairing. Mutation analysis of the 26-nt core element demonstrated the importance of defined nucleotides for protein-RNA binding. In the GFP reporter system, the same mutations that prevented binding were also ineffective in destabilizing GFP mRNA in HEK293 cells. This is the first study of an AU-rich element that relates function to structure. The PTH mRNA 3′-UTR cis-acting element is an open region that utilizes the distinct sequence pattern to determine mRNA stability by its interaction with trans-acting factors.

The parathyroids (PTs) are regulated by calcium, phosphate, and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 (1.Silver J. Naveh-Many T. Kronenberg H.M. Bilezikian J.B. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego2002: 407-420Google Scholar). Hypocalcemia dramatically increases PTH mRNA levels, secretion, and, after prolonged stimulation, PT cell proliferation (2.Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The increase in PTH mRNA levels is post-transcriptional. Phosphate also regulates PTH secretion, gene expression, and PT cell proliferation (3.Kilav R. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 327-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Naveh-Many T. Rahamimov R. Livni N. Silver J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1786-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Dietary induced phosphate depletion dramatically decreases PTH mRNA levels, and this is also post-transcriptional (3.Kilav R. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 327-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that this post-transcriptional regulation is mediated by protein-RNA interactions involving protein binding to a specific element in the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR that determine PTH mRNA stability (2.Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 5.Kilav R. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8727-8733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Protein binding to the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR was increased by hypocalcemia and decreased by hypophosphatemia. The regulation of binding by calcium and phosphate was observed only in the PT and not in other tissues of the same rats. We have identified AUF1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D) as a protein trans-acting factor that stabilizes the PTH mRNA (6.Sela-Brown A. Silver J. Brewer G. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7424-7429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). There is no PT cell line; therefore, we have utilized a cell-free mRNA in vitro degradation assay (IVDA) to demonstrate the functionality of the parathyroid cytosolic proteins in determining the stability of the PTH transcript. This assay has been shown to authentically reproduce cellular decay processes. PT protein extracts from hypocalcemic rats stabilized and PT protein extracts from hypophosphatemic rats destabilized the full-length PTH transcript, correlating with mRNA levels in vivo. Deletion of the proteinbinding element of the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR resulted in stabilization of the transcript compared with the full-length PTH transcript. Moreover, calcium and phosphate did not regulate the stability of the truncated transcript. Therefore, the IVDA reproduces the in vivo stabilizing effect of low calcium and destabilizing effects of low phosphate on PTH mRNA levels, and this regulation in the IVDA is dependent upon protein binding that protects an instability sequence in the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR (2.Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, it is not known yet if the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR protein-binding element is the cleavage site itself or if it induces some exonucleolytic pathway that acts either on the 5′ or the 3′-end of the mRNA. We have identified the minimal sequence for protein binding in the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR and determined its functionality. A minimal sequence of 26 nt in the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR was sufficient for protein binding. To study the functionality of the protein binding element in the context of a different RNA, a 63-bp fragment coding for the 26 nt and flanking nt was fused to growth hormone (GH) reporter gene. RNAs were transcribed in vitro, and transcripts were subjected to IVDA with PT proteins. The chimeric GH PTH 63-nt transcript, as the full-length PTH transcript, was stabilized by PT proteins from rats fed a low calcium diet and destabilized by proteins of a low phosphate diet, correlating with PTH mRNA levels in vivo. The native GH transcript was more stable than PTH and the chimeric RNAs and was not affected by PT proteins from the different diets. These results demonstrate that the protein binding region of the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR is both necessary and sufficient to confer responsiveness to calcium and phosphate and determines PTH mRNA stability and levels (5.Kilav R. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8727-8733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have now studied the function of the PTH element in cells, using the heterologous cell line HEK293. Plasmids containing the native GH or GFP gene or chimeric genes containing the PTH 3′-UTR sequences at the 3′-end of the gene were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, and mRNA levels were measured by Northern blot. There was a marked decrease in GH and GFP mRNA levels of the chimeric constructs compared with the WT constructs or chimeric constructs that contained a truncated sequence of the PTH mRNA element, and this effect was post-transcriptional. These results are in agreement with the decreased stability of the chimeric transcript in the in vitro degradation assay with PT proteins, and they demonstrate the functional importance of the RNA protein binding region in the PTH 3′-UTR (5.Kilav R. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8727-8733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In order to understand the mechanism by which the specific sequences in the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR regulate mRNA half-life both in vitro and in vivo and PTH gene expression in response to changes in calcium and phosphate, we studied the structure of the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR. Our results show that the 3′-UTR and in particular the 100 nt that include the 26-nt protein binding core and flanking sequences do not form a stable secondary structure. Mutation analysis confirmed the importance of specific sequence patterns for protein binding and for the destabilizing effect of the cis-acting element. Construction of the chimeric GH and GFP mRNAs containing 63 and 100 nt, respectively, of the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR for transfection experiments. The 63- or 100-bp DNA corresponding to the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR 63- and 100-nt transcripts that were subcloned into PGEM-T vector (5.Kilav R. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8727-8733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were excised. The 63-bp fragment or a 40-bp truncated fragment was inserted into the SmaI site of the pS16-GH expression plasmid that contained the S16 ribosomal protein promoter linked to the GH structural gene lacking GH promoter sequences (7.Levy S. Avni D. Hariharan N. Perry R.P. Meyuhas O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3319-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The 63- or 40-bp fragments were inserted between the coding region and the 3′-UTR of GH mRNA. For GFP chimeric constructs, a 100-bp fragment of the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR consisting of the 63-bp element and flanking nucleotides in pCRII plasmid (Invitrogen) was inserted into the SacI-ApaI site of the MCS of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) at the 3′-end of GFP cDNA before the poly(A) signal. The mutated PTH 100-nt sequence was prepared by PCR using mutated oligonucleotides for each construct, as described below. Transient Transfection Experiments—The plasmids (1 μg of DNA/24-well plate) were transiently transfected into HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. In experiments using sense (oligonucleotide 1) or antisense (oligonucleotide 2) oligonucleotides, the oligonucleotides to the 26-nt protein-binding region were cotransfected at a concentration of 0.25 μg/well using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24-48 h after transfection, total RNA was extracted by TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) and analyzed for GH or GFP mRNAs by Northern blot. Expression of co-transfected cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase plasmid demonstrated transfection efficiency. In some experiments, DRB (Sigma) (25 μg/ml) or actinomycin D (Sigma) (2.5 μg/ml) was added 24 h after transfection to suppress transcription for 3-24 h. In Vitro RNA Synthesis—In vitro transcribed RNA was prepared from linearized plasmids using an RNA production kit (Promega) and the appropriate RNA polymerases as previously described (5.Kilav R. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8727-8733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The RNAs were quantified by spectrophotometry at 260/280 and visualization on agarose gels. RNase H Analysis—RNase H analysis was performed according to Argaman et al. (8.Argaman L. Altuvia S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) with some modifications. 3 pmol of oligonucleotides were annealed with 1 pmol of in vitro transcribed RNA by incubation at 37-45 °C according to the denaturing temperature of each oligonucleotide for 10 min in 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Then MgCl2 (10 mm) and 1 unit of RNase H (Promega) were added, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The RNA samples were then extracted with phenol/chloroform, denatured, separated on 2% agarose gel, and transferred to Hybond N membrane. The membranes were hybridized for PTH and autoradiographed for 14 min. To analyze endogenous PT RNA, rat thyro/parathyroid RNA from a single rat was extracted with TRi reagent (Molecular Research Center) and subjected to RNase H analysis. For endogenous PTH mRNA, 9 pmol of oligonucleotide were annealed with 2 μg of total PT RNA, subjected to RNase H and analyzed as the in vitro transcribed RNA. The oligonucleotides used were as follows from 5′ to 3′: the sense oligonucleotide 1 (CAATATATTCTTCTTTTTAAAGTATTA; residues 623-648) and the antisense oligonucleotides oligonucleotide 2 (TAATACTTTAAAAAGAAGAATATATTG; residues 648-623), oligonucleotide 3 (AAAGAAGAATATATTG; residues 638-623), oligonucleotide 4 (GGTTCATGA; residues 701-693), oligonucleotide 5 (TTTATTTATATTTAAGGAGAG; residues 684-663), oligonucleotide 6 (AAATGGAATCATTGGAAGAGAC; residues 622-601), oligonucleotide 7 (ATTACAGTAGAA; residues 562-551), oligonucleotide 8 (TCTAGAATACGT; residues 484-473), and oligonucleotide 9 (ATCATCACCTTA; residues 142-150). For the endogenous PT RNA, oligonucleotide dT consisting of 21 repeats was used. For the analysis of the chimeric GFP-PTH 100 transcript, the antisense oligonucleotide of the polylinker sequence of the pCRII plasmid that was also part of the GFP-PTH chimeric transcript was AAGTCCGGACTCAGATCTCGA. PTH RNA Structure by Primer Extension—In vitro transcribed RNA for the full-length PTH mRNA, the 3′-UTR, or the 100 nt of the 3′-UTR (2 pmol) was partially digested by RNase T1 and U2 (Amersham Biosciences) and V1 (Pierce). RNase T1 digestion was performed at 37 °C for 10 min with 0.005-0.5 units of T1 in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 μg of tRNA. Digestion with U2 was performed at 55 °C for 10 min with 0.005-0.5 units in 33 mm sodium citrate (pH 3.5), 1.7 mm EDTA, and 3.5 m urea. RNase V1 digestion was at 37 °C for 30 min with 0.01-0.4 units in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 and 10 μg of tRNA. All digestions were performed in a final volume of 10 μl. Reactions were stopped by phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitation with ethanol in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl and 1 μl of Quik-Precip (Edge Biosystems). A primer extension reaction was performed using a 32P-5′-end-labeled antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the 3′-end of the PTH mRNA (antisense oligonucleotide 4 in Fig. 2A). An annealing mixture containing 2 pmol of 5′-endlabeled primer and 2 pmol of partially digested PTH RNA was incubated at 65 °C for 3 min and cooled at 4 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, the primer was extended toward the cleavage site by reverse transcription with 2 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and 0.5 mm each dXTP for 20 min at 42 °C. The extension products were run on 6% sequencing gels along with a sequencing reaction that was carried out with the same end-labeled PTH primer. The sequencing reaction was performed using a Termo-sequenase kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). The gels were exposed to x-ray film. Mutations for Binding and Transfection Experiments—The transcripts of WT and mutated 26-nt element (Fig. 4A) were prepared from annealed sense and antisense oligonucleotides that were constructed to include the T3 RNA polymerase sequence (underlined). For the WT 26 nt, the sense oligonucleotide was AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGCAATATATTCTTCTTTTTAAAGTATTAT, and the antisense oligonucleotide was TAATACTTTAAAAAGAAGAATATATTG. The mutations described in the legend to Fig. 4B were constructed by replacing two or three specific nt at a time, as indicated. The following sense oligonucleotides were used for the mutated transcripts: for m1, CAATATATTCTTCTTTTTAAAGCCCT; for m2, CAATATATTCTTCTTTTTCCAGTATT; for m3, CAATATATTCTTCTGCGTAAAGTATT; for m4, CAATATATTCGGCTTTTTAAAGTATT; for m5, CAATATACCCTTCTTTTTAAAGTATT; for m6, CCGCATATTCTTCTTTTTAAAGTATT. All oligonucleotides were linked to the T3 RNA polymerase sequence (not shown) as for the WT and annealed to the corresponding antisense oligonucleotides (not shown). The mutated PTH 100-nt sequence was prepared by PCR using mutated oligonucleotides for each construct as shown in Fig. 4 and the antisense oligonucleotide 4 that is described for RNase H analysis. The PCR products were subcloned first into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and then excised and inserted into the GFP expression plasmid as for the WT PTH 100-nt element.

The program EDscan computed a standard Z score, Zscre of the free energy difference, Ediff between the lowest free energy structure of the local segment and its corresponding optimal restrained structure where all base pairs formed in the original minimal structure were prohibited. The greater the Ediff of the segment is, the more well ordered the folded RNA structure is expected to be. Thus, the measures Ediff and Zscre signify both the thermodynamic stability and well ordered conformation of a local folded segment. In practice, Ediff and Zscre were computed by sliding a fixed length window in steps of one or a few nt from 5′ to 3′ along the sequence. The stability and statistical significance of a given RNA folding relative to others in the sequence were assessed by the two standard Z scores, significance score (SIGSCR) and stability score (STBSCR) (12.Le S.Y. Maizel Jr, J.V. J. Theor. Biol. 1989; 138: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13.Le S.Y. Chen J.H. Maizel J.V. Sarma R.H. Sarma M.H. Structure and Methods VI: Human Genome Initiative and DNA Recombination. Adenine Press, Schenectady, NY1990Google Scholar). The score SIGSCR of a local RNA segment was calculated by dividing the energy difference between the actual and mean random stabilities by the S.D. value of the random stabilities. The STBSCR was calculated by dividing the difference between the stability of the given segment and the mean stability of all overlapping segments by the S.D. value of the stabilities of these segments that were generated by taking successive, overlapping, fixed length segments stepped one or few nt at a time along the sequence. The primary approach SigStb was used to explore unusual folding regions whose SIGSCR and/or STBSCR are unusually small or large in the sequence by sliding a fixed length window along the sequence. The significant open region (14.Le S.Y. Chen J.H. Chatterjee D. Maizel J.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3275-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), whose SIGSCR and STBSCR are unusually large can be discovered. The term “significant open region” indicates that the structure folded by the biological segment is very unstable, and the structure of the random permutation of the biological sequences is statistically more stable than that of the natural sequence.

The Effect of the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR cis-Element on the Expression of Reporter Genes in HEK293 Cells—We have previously identified a protein-binding cis-acting element in the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR. We demonstrated the function of a 63-nt element in an IVDA with parathyroid cytosolic proteins and the PTH mRNA transcript or a chimeric reporter gene transcript containing the PTH element (5.Kilav R. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8727-8733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To show the functionality of the cis-element in vivo in cells, we studied its effect on reporter genes by transfection experiments. Since there is no PT cell line, we studied the function of the PTH binding element in the heterologous cell line HEK293. We used plasmids containing the native GH gene or the chimeric GH PTH 63- or 40-nt truncated element all driven by a S16 ribosomal protein promoter. The truncated 40-nt element that was shown not to bind PT proteins was used as a control (5.Kilav R. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8727-8733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The 63- or 40-bp fragments were inserted into the same site of a GH expression plasmid, between the coding region and the 3′-UTR of GH mRNA. The plasmids were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, and mRNA levels were measured at 24 and 48 h by Northern blot. Fig. 1A shows a representative Northern blot for GH mRNA for four transfections of each expression plasmid. There was a marked decrease in GH mRNA levels of the GH PTH 63-nt chimeric construct but not of the truncated 40-nt construct compared with the WT GH construct at 24 h (not shown) or 48 h (Fig. 1A). Uniform transfection efficiency was demonstrated by cotransfection with a β-galactosidase expression plasmid. There was a similar decrease in secreted GH levels in the cell culture medium, shown as the mean for four transfections in each group (Fig. 1A). Because all GH constructs utilize the same S16 promoter, these results suggest that insertion of the 63-nt element decreased the stability of the GH transcript and not its transcription. These results are in agreement with the decreased stability of the GH chimeric transcript in the IVDA with PT proteins (5.Kilav R. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8727-8733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrate the functional importance of the RNA protein binding region in the PTH 3′-UTR as an instability element not only in vitro in the IVDA but also in vivo in HEK293 cells. To show the functionality of the cis-element in the context of another RNA, we used the cDNA for bacterial GFP as a reporter gene. A fragment coding for the PTH 3′-UTR 100 nt that included the 63 nt and flanking nt was inserted into a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven GFP plasmid at the 3′-end of the GFP cDNA before the polyadenylation signal. Wild type and chimeric plasmids were transiently transfected in quadruplicate into HEK293 cells. After 24 and 48 h, the expression of GFP protein was visualized by immunofluorescence, and then total RNA was extracted, and GFP mRNA levels were measured by Northern blot. Insertion of the PTH element resulted in a marked decrease in GFP mRNA and protein levels in the chimeric gene compared with the WT gene in the four transfections in each group (Fig. 1B). As for the GH mRNAs, this result suggests that the PTH element affected GFP mRNA stability and not its transcription, since both GFP constructs utilized the same cytomegalovirus promoter. To confirm the post-transcriptional effect of the PTH instability element, actinomycin D or DRB were added to the GFP-transfected cells 24 h after transfection. WT and chimeric GFP mRNA levels were measured by Northern blot at 16 h after the addition of the transcription inhibitors to compare the decay of the two mRNAs (Fig. 1C). The basal levels of wild type GFP mRNA levels before the addition of the transcriptional inhibitors (control) were set as 100%, and L32 was used as a control mRNA. The results are expressed as percentage of GFP/L32 mRNA levels and are the mean of three independent experiments each comprising four repeat samples. The presence of the 100-nt element decreased basal GFP mRNA levels by 50% (Fig. 1C) as in Fig. 1B. After transcriptional inhibition by the addition of DRB or actinomycin D, GFP WT mRNA levels decreased to 70% of base line at 16 h. In contrast, the mRNA levels for GFP with the 100-nt PTH element were decreased to 5% of basal level (Fig. 1C). This demonstrates that the GFP mRNA with the 100-nt PTH element was significantly less stable than the WT GFP mRNA. Therefore, the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR 100-nt element is a destabilizing element, and its effect is post-transcriptional. Secondary Structure of the PTH mRNA—To understand how the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR 63 and 100 nt that include the proteinbinding element destabilize the PTH transcript as well as reporter RNA, we analyzed the putative structure of the element. We first used oligonucleotide-targeted RNase H digestion to study the domain structure of the PTH transcript. RNase H cleaves DNA/RNA hybrids, and we used antisense oligonucleotides spanning different regions of the PTH mRNA and RNase H digestion to study the secondary structure of the PTH transcript. Targeted sequences that are part of a stable double-stranded structure will not anneal to the oligonucleotide and will therefore not be cleaved by RNase H. In contrast, antisense oligonucleotides will anneal to open regions in the transcript and will therefore mediate cleavage by RNase H. In vitro transcribed PTH RNA representing the full-length PTH mRNA or endogenous PTH mRNA as part of total parathyroid RNA extracted from rat parathyroids was used. We targeted sequences along the PTH 3′-UTR and coding region, using 6-20-nt-long antisense oligonucleotides (Fig. 2A). The antisense oligonucleotides were incubated with the RNA, and then RNase H was added. After digestion, RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blots. Fig. 2 shows the results of representative gels of RNase H analysis using a full-length in vitro transcribed RNA (Fig. 2B) and PTH mRNA of total parathyroid RNA (Fig. 2C). The RNAs were incubated with oligonucleotide 1 in the sense orientation that does not anneal to the RNA or oligonucleotides 2-9 in the antisense orientation (Fig. 2A). As expected, the full-length in vitro transcribed PTH transcript without added oligonucleotides (Fig. 1B, first lane) or with oligonucleotide 1 in the sense orientation (Fig. 1B, lane 2) was not cleaved by RNase H. In addition, antisense oligonucleotides 7 and 9 did not mediate cleavage of the RNA, suggesting that they target sequences that are double-stranded. Oligonucleotide 8 showed partial cleavage, suggesting that the target of this oligonucleotide is only partly double-stranded. In contrast, the addition of antisense oligonucleotides 2-6 spanning the 100-nt element all led to complete cleavage of the PTH RNA. Cleavage by RNase H resulted in two fragments. The larger 5′ cleavage product is seen in Fig. 2B, and the smaller 3′ corresponding cleavage product was seen after longer exposure of the gels (not shown). The size of the cleavage product was proportional to the distance of the oligonucleotide used from the 5′-end of the transcript. RNase H cleavage with oligonucleotide 4, which is close to the 3′-end of the transcript, resulted in a small decrease in the size of the full-length transcript (Fig. 2B, lane 5). In contrast, oligonucleotide 6, which is more proximal, mediated cleavage that resulted in a smaller 5′ transcript than with oligonucleotide 4 (Fig. 2B, lane 7) RNase H cleavage is dependent upon annealing of the antisense oligonucleotide to a single-stranded accessible region in the target RNA. When the antisense oligonucleotides were added to the PTH transcript that had been previously denatured by heating at 80 °C, there was cleavage by RNase H with all of the oligonucleotides, including oligonucleotides 7 and 9 (not shown). This confirms that in the undenatured RNA, secondary structures had prevented annealing to the regions targeted by these oligonucleotides. Fig. 2B shows the results of in vitro transcribed PTH RNA. Similar results were obtained when the same experiments were performed on endogenous PTH mRNA that had been transcribed and processed in vivo in the rat parathyroid (Fig. 2C). For that, RNase H analysis was performed as in Fig. 2B but with total RNA extracted from the rat parathyroid (Fig. 2C). The only significant difference was seen with oligonucleotide 8 (lane 9) that showed no cleavage with the endogenous PTH mRNA and partial cleavage with the in vitro transcribed RNA. The reason for this is not clear, but oligonucleotide 8 targets RNA that is not part of the 3′-UTR; therefore, its exact structure is less relevant to this study. The RNase H cleavage anal"

By monovalently displaying human LIF on the surface of M13 phage and randomizing clusters of residues in regions predicted to be important for human LIFR binding, we have identified mutations, which lead to significant increases in affinity for binding to LIFR. Six libraries were constructed in which regions of 4–6 amino acids were randomized then panned against LIFR. Mutations identified in three distinct clusters, residues 53–57, 102–103, and 150–155, gave rise to proteins with significantly increased affinity for binding to both human and mouse LIFR. Combining the mutations for each of these regions further increased the affinity, such that the best mutants bound to human LIFR with >1000-fold higher affinity than wild-type human LIF. NMR analysis indicated that the mutations did not alter the overall structure of the molecule relative to the native protein, although some local changes occurred in the vicinity of the substituted residues. Despite increases in LIFR binding affinity, these mutants did not show any increase in activity as agonists of LIF-induced proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing human LIFR and gp130 compared with wild-type LIF. Incorporation of two additional mutations (Q29A and G124R), which were found to abrogate cell signaling, led to the generation of highly potent antagonists of both human and murine LIF-induced bioactivity.

Heath J.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2399-2411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As with most of these proteins, LIF displays a wide variety of biological actions on numerous cell types and tissues, including neurons, embryonic stem cells, hepatocytes, megakaryocytes, adipocytes, and osteoblasts (2.Hilton D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 72-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). All are four α-helical bundle type cytokines that exert their biological effects following the formation of high affinity receptor complexes involving at least one gp130 molecule. In the case of LIF, formation of the signaling complex is a two-step process: LIF initially binds to the LIF receptor α-chain (LIFR) with low (nm) affinity, then LIF-LIFR binds to gp130 to form the high (pm) affinity LIF-LIFR-gp130 signaling complex (1.Bravo J. Heath J.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2399-2411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Zhang J.G. Owczarek C.M. Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Fabri L.J. Roberts B.A. Nicola N.A. Biochem.

Cosman D. Science. 1992; 255: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Using alanine scanning mutagenesis, the sites on human LIF important for binding to both LIFR and gp130 have been characterized (5.Hudson K.R. Vernallis A.B. Heath J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11971-11978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In particular, a Phe and Lys near the start of the D-helix were found to be critical for LIFR binding, while a number of residues in both the A- and C-helices were important for interaction with gp130. These receptor binding sites are referred to as Site III and Site II, respectively, following the convention established for IL-6 (6.Simpson R.J. Hammacher A. Smith D.K. Matthews J.M. Ward L.D. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 929-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). While many of the in vitro functions of LIF appear to overlap with those of other cytokines in the family, it has been shown through gene deletion studies in mice that LIF has a critical role in embryo implantation that cannot be compensated for by the other family members (7.Stewart C.L. Kaspar P. Brunet L.J. Bhatt H. Gadi I. Kontgen F. Abbondanzo S.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar). It therefore follows that antagonists of LIF may be able to act as novel contraceptives. Indeed, in several studies in which anti-LIF antibodies have been injected into both mice and monkeys, a decrease in the pregnancy rate of both animals was observed (8.Yue Z.P. Yang Z.M. Wei P. Li S.J. Wang H.B. Tan J.H. Harper M.J. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 508-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9.Mitchell M.H. Swanson R.J. Oehninger S. Biol.

Further studies of the contraceptive potential of anti-LIF agents would benefit from the development of novel antagonists of LIF signaling. One non-antibody approach to the development of LIF antagonists is through the design of mutant LIF molecules which inhibit signaling by binding to only one of the two receptor chains. Antagonists of LIF (5.Hudson K.R. Vernallis A.B. Heath J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11971-11978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), or other related cytokines (11.Vernallis A.B. Hudson K.R. Heath J.K. J. Biol.

Content J. Aarden L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 86-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have previously been made by mutation of residues important for interaction with gp130. Such antagonists, however, are not particularly potent as they only bind the cytokine-specific receptor, the affinity of which is considerably lower than that of the wild-type cytokine forming the higher affinity gp130-containing complex. To improve the potency of such molecules, and hence convert them into so-called “superantagonists,” additional mutations are introduced that improve the affinity for binding the cytokine-specific receptor. This affinity maturation process is usually achieved using phage display technology (13.Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 564-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Of the gp130-signaling cytokines, superantagonist forms of IL-6 (14.Ehlers M. de Hon F.D. Bos H.K. Horsten U. Kurapkat G. van De Leur H.S. Grotzinger J. Wollmer A. Brakenhoff J.P. Rose-John S. J.

In the present report, we describe the affinity maturation of LIF through the use of phage display, and the subsequent conversion of these mutants into potent superantagonists. Construction of Mutant LIF Libraries—To enable monovalent display of human LIF as a fusion to the gene III coat protein of M13 phage (geneIIIp), LIF cDNA was subcloned into an in-house phage display vector. Libraries were constructed essentially as described by Sidhu et al. (18.Sidhu S.S. Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 333-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to construction, the codons for each residue to be randomized (library A: 48–53, library B: 53–58; library C: 102–107; library D: 150–155; library E: 155–160; library F: 170–175) were mutated to TGA stop codons by site-directed mutagenesis using the method of Kunkel et al. (19.Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Randomization of each of these residues was then performed using the same method, but with degenerate oligonucleotides in which an NNS codon was incorporated at each randomized position. Following transformation of electrocompetent SS320 E. coli (18.Sidhu S.S. Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 333-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the mutated phagemids, M13KO7 helper phage was added and the culture incubated overnight in 500 ml of 2YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Phage particles were then isolated from the supernatants by polyethylene glycol-NaCl precipitation as described previously (18.Sidhu S.S. Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 333-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Panning of Libraries—Each library was subjected to four rounds of panning against recombinant human LIFR. Five wells of a 96-well microtiter plate were coated with LIFR at 2.5 μg/ml (rounds 1 and 2) or 1 μg/ml (rounds 3 and 4) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with PBS containing either 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (rounds 1 and 3) or 0.5% (w/v) casein (rounds 2 and 4), the initial phage stocks, or phage from the previous round of panning, were diluted 10-fold with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 and either 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (rounds 1 and 3) or 0.5% (w/v) casein (rounds 2 and 4). Diluted phage stock (100 μl; ∼1012 phage) was added to each well and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. Plates were then washed 15 times, and bound phage were eluted by incubation with 100 μl/well of 0.1 m HCl for 3 min. The eluate was neutralized with 1.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, the phage repropagated by infection of XL1-Blue Escherichia coli (Strategene, La Jolla, CA), and then harvested from an overnight culture in 50 ml of 2YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and ∼1010 M13KO7 helper phage. After the fourth round of panning, eluted phage were serially diluted and used to infect XL1-Blue cells for 1 h prior to plating onto agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. To determine the sequences of LIF mutants displayed by the selected clones, 1 μl of culture supernatant from individual colonies grown in the presence of helper phage was used in a PCR to amplify a fragment encompassing the encoded LIF sequence. This PCR product was then treated with ExoSAPit, (USB Corp., Cleveland, OH) to degrade unconsumed deoxynucleotides and primers, and sequenced directly. Production of Recombinant Proteins—LIFR proteins corresponding to residues 52–536 of human LIFR, or 50–531 of murine LIFR, together with an N-terminal FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK), were produced as previously described (20.Fairlie W.D. Uboldi A.D. Hemmings G.J. Smith B.J. Martin H.M. Morgan P.O. Baca M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13193-13201Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For production of LIF proteins, the cDNA for either human or murine LIF, or the human/murine chimera MH35 (21.Layton M.J. Owczarek C.M. Metcalf D. Clark R.L. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29891-29896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were subcloned into a modified pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) in which an f1 origin of replication had been inserted to enable single-stranded DNA preparation for mutagenesis. All mutant forms were then made using the method of Kunkel et al. (19.Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were expressed from the same vector as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in BL-21 DE3 pLys E. coli, purified, and cleaved from the fusion partner essentially as described previously (22.Gearing D.P. Nicola N.A. Metcalf D. Foote S. Willson T.A. Gough N.M. Williams R.L. Biotechnology. 1989; 7: 1157-1161Google Scholar, 23.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). For production of uniformly 15N-labeled protein, E. coli were grown in minimal medium containing 15N ammonium chloride as previously described (24.Hinds M.G. Maurer T. Zhang J.G. Nicola N.A. Norton R.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Final products were purified by reverse phase HPLC on a C4 (25 × 0.75 cm) column equilibrated in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 4 ml/min, and eluted with a 0–70% (v/v) acetonitrile gradient over 35 min. The eluate was monitored at 280 nm and fractions containing the protein were pooled and lyophilized. All purified proteins were subjected to analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to confirm they were of the expected molecular mass. Proteins were solubilized in PBS prior to use, and the concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using the method of Gill and von Hippel (25.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Expression of LIF Mutants on M13 Phage—Mutants of LIF were prepared according to the method of Kunkel et al. (19.Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) in a phagemid vector which enabled monovalent display on phage as fusions to geneIIIp. These constructs were used to transform XL-1 Blue E. coli, and phage were propagated from individual colonies following incubation in the presence M13KO7 helper phage. Phage displaying the various mutant proteins were isolated from culture supernatants by PEGNaCl precipitation as described previously (18.Sidhu S.S. Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 333-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Competitive Phage Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—The competition ELISA was performed essentially as described previously (26.Fairlie W.D. Uboldi A.D. De Souza D.P. Hemmings G.J. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 26: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the format used in these studies, Maxisorp 96-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated overnight at 4 °C with either human LIFR at 2.5 μg/ml, or murine LIFR at 1.25 μg/ml. A subsaturating concentration of phage (previously determined by titration against either receptor), monovalently displaying wild-type or mutant LIF was incubated with increasing concentrations of soluble human or murine LIFR. Bound phage were detected with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-M13 phage antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine/hydrogen peroxide substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) as described previously (26.Fairlie W.D. Uboldi A.D. De Souza D.P. Hemmings G.J. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 26: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Kinetic Analysis by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—Kinetic analysis of wild-type or mutant cytokines was performed by SPR using a BIAcore 3000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Proteins were immobilized onto a CM5 biosensor chip at 1000 ± 200 response units (RU) per channel. Sensorgrams were obtained following injection of various concentrations of recombinant human LIFR at a flow rate of 40 μl/min for 4 min. Bound receptor was then allowed to dissociate for times up to 10 h. Binding profiles were analyzed by using BIAevaluation software Ver. 3.2 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). NMR Spectroscopy—Lyophilized uniformly 15N-enriched MH35-LIF mutant MH35-BD was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 90% H2O/10% 2H2O without the addition of buffer. The concentration was ∼0.7 mm and the pH was adjusted to 4.4 without correcting for the deuterium isotope effect. Spectra were recorded at 37 °C on a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer using triple-resonance probes equipped with triple-axis gradients; these included two-dimensional 1H-15N-HSQC, three-dimensional 1H-15N-NOESY-HSQC with a 150-ms mixing time, and three-dimensional HNHA spectra. Measurements of steady-state 1H-15N NOE values were carried out as described previously (27.Yao S. Smith D.K. Hinds M.G. Zhang J.G. Nicola N.A. Norton R.S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All spectra were processed using XWINNMR, version 3.5 (Bruker AG, Karlsruhe, Germany), and analyzed with XEASY, version 1.4 (28.Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). The 1H chemical shifts were referenced to 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate at 0 ppm via the H2O signal, and the 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly using the 15N/1H γ-ratios (29.Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). The standard deviations of NOE values were determined from the background noise level of the spectra as described by Farrow et al. (30.Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M.

Ba/F3 Cell Proliferation Assay—Ba/F3, an IL-3-dependent cell line, is derived from murine pro B lymphocytes and does not normally express LIFR or gpl30 (31.Gearing D.P. Ziegler S.F. Comeau M.R. Friend D. Thoma B. Cosman D. Park L. Mosley B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with either murine LIFR/gp130 or human LIFR/gp130 (32.Zhang Y. Willson T.A. Metcalf D. Cary D. Hilton D.J. Clark R. Nicola N.A. J. Biol.

For agonist assays, the various wild-type or mutant forms of LIF were added at increasing concentrations in a total volume of 100 μl/well. After incubation for 48 h, proliferation was measured colorimetrically at 570 nm using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich). In the antagonist assays, cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of LIF antagonist in the presence of a fixed, submaximal concentration of either human LIF (60 pm), murine LIF (40 pm), or IL-3 (6 pm) in a total volume of 100 μl/well. Proliferation was again measured as described for the agonist assays. Agonist and antagonist assays were always performed in triplicate, and mean values for each assay point were plotted. M1 Cell Colony Differentiation Assay—M1 differentiation assays were performed as described previously (33.Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Leukemia. 1988; 2: 216-221PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with a fixed, submaximal concentration of recombinant murine LIF (8 pm) in the presence of increasing concentrations of the various LIF antagonists. Design and Construction of Libraries—Six mutant libraries of LIF were designed in which residues that contribute to LIFR binding were randomly mutated. The selection of residues to be randomized was based primarily on the alanine-scanning mutagenesis study of Hudson et al. (5.Hudson K.R. Vernallis A.B. Heath J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11971-11978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), although data from other LIF structure-function studies (21.Layton M.J. Owczarek C.M. Metcalf D. Clark R.L. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29891-29896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were also considered. Residues which had been shown to contribute to LIFR binding were mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of human LIF, then this and other nearby residues were incorporated into the libraries (Fig. 1A). Each library contained a total of six randomized residues. Libraries A–E formed a near contiguous surface in vicinity of Phe156 and Lys159, two residues on LIF that were found to be critical for binding to LIFR (Fig. 1B). Library F, which included three residues that had been shown to result in a 2–3-fold decrease in binding to receptor when substituted with Ala, was located at the C-terminal end of the D-helix (Fig. 1A). Following electroporation into E. coli, each library contained between 108 and 109 transformants, with mutation rates of 40–80%. While this is below the level required for representation of all possible protein sequences within a library containing six randomized positions (2.5 × 109 transformants required for a complete library at the 90% confidence level, Ref. 18.Sidhu S.S. Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 333-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was expected to provide a high enough level of diversity for the purposes of the study. Panning of Libraries—Each of the libraries was panned against human LIFR. After four rounds of panning, individual clones were picked and the sequences in the randomized region were determined. Panning of library A (residues 48–53) failed to identify any specifically binding mutants, as many of the clones sequenced after four rounds of panning contained the template sequence, or contaminating wild-type LIF or high affinity clones from other libraries. It has been suggested that vulnerability to contamination in panning phage display libraries indicates an absence of clones within the library that exhibit high affinity for the target protein (34.Ballinger M.D. Jones J.T. Lofgren J.A. Fairbrother W.J. Akita R.W. Sliwkowski M.X. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11675-11684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to prepare a new library with reduced diversity by limiting the randomized segment to four residues located near the beginning of the AB loop (amino acids 49–52). Following four rounds of panning with this library, 20/24 clones analyzed contained the wild-type sequence. Only three clones contained a sequence, which differed from wild type, and this variation only occurred at residue 50. No single dominant sequence emerged from library B in which residues 53–58 in the A-B loop were randomized, but certain amino acids were selected preferentially at several of the randomized positions. In particular, Gly was strongly selected at residue 53 in place of the wild-type Pro (10/17 clones), and a large hydrophobic residue (Leu/Met/Phe/Trp) in place of Asn at 54 and 55 (11/17 and 14/17 clones, respectively). There was also a preference for Gly or Pro (8/17 clones) at residue 57 in place of Asp, and retention of a positively charged residue (7/17 clones), at residue 58. For library C (residues 102–107, end of B-helix), non-wild-type residues were strongly selected at 102 and 103, with retention of the wild-type sequence at the remaining positions. Trp was found in 7/13 clones in place of the wild-type Lys at residue 102, while 11/13 clones contained an acidic residue (predominantly Glu) in place of Ile at 103. The wild-type sequence was completely retained for residues 104–106, and in 7/13 clones for residue 107. As with library B, there was no dominant sequence that emerged following panning of library D (residues 150–155, C-D loop). However, the majority of clones (14/17) had a Trp at residue 150, a large hydrophobic residue (12/17 with Tyr/Phe/Trp) at 154, and Thr (9/17 clones) at 155. There was a weak preference for Glu at residue 153 in place of the oppositely charged Lys found in the wild-type sequence. Library E (residues 155–160, start of D-helix) included residues 156 and 159, which had previously been shown to be critical for LIFR binding (5.Hudson K.R. Vernallis A.B. Heath J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11971-11978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The wild-type sequence was retained at these two positions in all of the clones analyzed. Most clones had a Ser at residue 157 in place of Gln, and Met at 160 in place of the native Lys. Interestingly, all clones contained a Tyr at residue 155. This residue was also randomized in library D, where the preferred residue was Thr, although some clones (4/17) from library D did contain a Tyr. This result may be a consequence of library E being incomplete, with few clones containing the critical Phe156 and Lys159 in addition to Thr at residue 155. Alternatively, this result may reflect a preference for Tyr in the context of the other changes at residues 157 and 160. In contrast to libraries A–E, clones selected after panning library F showed no real consensus in sequence for most of the randomized positions (170–175, end of D-helix), with the exception of residue 170 where 10/18 clones had Val in place of the wild-type Lys. This may indicate that additional rounds of panning may be required. Alternatively, it may suggest that a variety of amino acids are tolerated between amino acids 171 and 175. Affinities of Phage Display-selected LIF Mutants—Because of the large number of libraries screened in this study and the many unique sequences identified, it was not practical to functionally characterize all of the clones obtained. Instead, a small number of representative clones were selected with sequences that best matched the consensus for each library. Clones were not selected from library A, as the majority of these contained the wild-type LIF sequence. For these initial binding experiments, wild-type LIF and the selected mutants were expressed monovalently on M13 phage, and the LIFR binding affinities were determined by competition ELISA. The results of these experiments (Table I) indicate that clones selected from most of the libraries showed increased affinity for binding LIFR relative to wild-type LIF. In particular, clone B-11 from library B had the highest affinity and bound to LIFR with an IC50 that was 100-fold lower than that of wild-type LIF. Clones from libraries C, D, and E showed improvements in LIFR binding affinities between 3- and 36-fold. Where two clones were tested from any one library, the clone that was more highly represented in the final pool tended to have the higher affinity. Only clones from library F did not show any significant improvement in binding affinity compared with wild-type LIF. As the sequences of clones analyzed from this library did not show any obvious consensus, it is possible that they were selected on the basis of improved display or expression on the phage surface, and not enhanced LIFR binding affinity.Table IBinding affinities of LIF mutants selected by phage display Clones from each library with sequences similar to the consensus were characterized in a competitive binding ELISA. Mutants were expressed monovalently as fusions to geneIIIp and tested for their ability to bind immobilized LIFR. The IC50 was the concentration of soluble LIFR required to inhibit 50% of the maximal binding response. The wild type sequence within each of the randomized segments is shown in column 1, and the modified sequences within the clones analyzed are shown in column 3.Library (wt sequence)CloneSequenceIC50IC50 wt/IC50 mutantnmwt LIFawt, wild typeNAbNA, not applicableNA3.6NAB (53PNNLDK58)B-1153GLLKGK580.036100C (102KILNPS107)C-2102AMLNPE1070.824.4C-3102WELNPS1070.2514D (150TSGKDV155)D-8150WAQEYT1550.1036D-10150WAEMFS1550.3311E (155VFQKKK160)E-2155YFSRKM1601.23.0E-12155YFSQKM1600.705.1F (170KQIIAV175)F-10170VSVSEE1752.61.4F-11170VVRVRE1753.31.1a wt,"
https://openalex.org/W2008928132,"The HLA class II expression is controlled by the transcriptional activator CIITA. The transcription of CIITA is controlled by different promoters, among which promoter-IV is inducible by IFN-gamma. We analysed the regulation of HLA class II molecules by IFN-gamma in a large series of human neuroblastoma cell lines. No induction of surface or intracellular HLA class II molecules and of specific mRNA was observed, in all neuroblastomas, with the exception of a nonprototypic cell line, ACN. In a large subset of neuroblastomas IFN-gamma induced expression of CIITA mRNA, derived from promoter-IV, which was not methylated. In contrast, in another subset of neuroblastomas, CIITA was not inducible by IFN-gamma and CIITA promoter-IV was either completely or partially methylated. Interestingly, the use of DNA demethylating agents restored CIITA gene transcriptional activation by IFN-gamma, but not HLA class II expression. The defect of HLA class II was not related to alterations in RFX or NF-Y transcription factors, as suggested by EMSA or RFX gene transfection experiments. In addition, the transfection of a functional CIITA cDNA failed to induce HLA class II expression in typical neuroblastoma cells. Confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis suggested a defective nuclear translocation and/or reduced protein synthesis in CIITA-transfected NB cells. Altogether, these data point to multiple mechanisms preventing HLA class II expression in the neuroblastoma, either involving CIITA promoter-IV silencing, or acting at the CIITA post-transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2102238970,"Glycosphingolipids are widely viewed as integral components of the Golgi-based machinery by which membrane proteins are targeted to compartments of the endosomal/lysosomal system and to the surface domains of polarized cells. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae creates glycosphingolipids by transferring mannose to the head group of inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC), yielding mannosyl-IPC (MIPC). Addition of an extra phosphoinositol group onto MIPC generates mannosyldi-IPC (M(IP)2C), the final and most abundant sphingolipid in yeast. Mannosylation of IPC is partially dependent on CSG1, a gene encoding a putative sphingolipidmannosyltransferase. Here we show that open reading frame YBR161w, renamed CSH1, is functionally homologous to CSG1 and that deletion of both genes abolishes MIPC and M(IP)2C synthesis without affecting protein mannosylation. Csg1p and Csh1p are closely related polytopic membrane proteins that co-localize with IPC synthase in the medial-Golgi. Loss of Csg1p and Csh1p has no effect on clathrin- or AP-3 adaptor-mediated protein transport from the Golgi to the vacuole. Moreover, segregation of the periplasmic enzyme invertase, the plasma membrane ATPase Pma1p and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein Gas1p into distinct classes of secretory vesicles occurs independently of Csg1p and Csh1p.

Our results indicate that protein sorting in the late Golgi of yeast does not require production of mannosylated sphingolipids. Correct sorting of membrane proteins and lipids is essential for establishing and maintaining the identity and function of the different cellular organelles. Although much progress has been made in uncovering the transport machinery for delivering endosomal/lysosomal proteins (1.Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar, 2.Burd C.G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the mechanisms for cargo sorting to the cell surface are still poorly defined. Exocytic cargo can reach the cell surface by multiple pathways in most, if not all eukaryotic cells (3.Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the polarized organization of epithelial cells relies on the sorting of both proteins and lipids into distinct classes of Golgi-derived vesicles that are targeted to the apical or basolateral surface (4.Mostov K.E. Verges M. Altschuler Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Apical and basolateral proteins expressed in fibroblasts are also sorted into different vesicles (5.Yoshimori T. Keller P. Roth M.G. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and it appears that the Golgi-based sorting machinery for apical and basolateral cargo operates both in polarized and non-polarized cell types (6.Musch A. Xu H. Shields D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Characterization of secretory vesicles that accumulate in late (post-Golgi-blocked) secretory yeast mutants has identified two vesicle populations with different densities and unique cargo proteins (7.Harsay E. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 8.David D. Sundarababu S. Gerst J.E. J.

Hence, transport of exocytic cargo by independent routes seems a conserved feature of eukaryotic cells.There are numerous indications that lipid microheterogeneity plays a role in cargo sorting along the secretory pathway. Importantly, sphingolipids and in particular glycosphingolipids have the propensity to segregate from glycerolipids and to cluster with sterols into lateral microdomains with physicochemical properties distinct from those of the bulk membrane (10.Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). Glycosphingolipid/sterol-rich microdomains were first conceived in polarized MDCK cells as Golgi-based sorting platforms for apically directed proteins and lipids (11.van Meer G. Stelzer E.H.K.

Biochem. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). In support of this model, inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis with fumonisin B randomizes the cell surface distribution of apical GPI 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; IPC, inositol phosphorylceramide; MIPC, mannosyl-IPC; HA, hemagglutinin; ORF, open reading frame; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; ALP, alkaline phosphatase. 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; IPC, inositol phosphorylceramide; MIPC, mannosyl-IPC; HA, hemagglutinin; ORF, open reading frame; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; ALP, alkaline phosphatase.-anchored proteins in MDCK cells (13.Mays R.W.

A similar glycosphingolipid-based sorting mechanism is held responsible for axonal delivery of GPI-anchored proteins in neurons (14.Ledesma M.D. Simons K. Dotti C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3966-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), regulated apical secretion of zymogens from pancreatic acinar cells (15.Schmidt K. Schrader M. Kern H.F. Kleene R. J. Biol.

Glycosphingolipids are also required for transport of melanosomal proteins from the Golgi to melanososomes in melanoma cells (20.Sprong H. Degroote S. Claessens T. van Drunen J. Oorschot V. Westerink B.H. Hirabayashi Y. Klumperman J. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), but the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. The ubiquitous expression of glycosphingolipids suggests that they exert organizing functions in all eukaryotic cells.Animals as well as some plants and fungi generate glycosphingolipids by transferring glucose or galactose to the C1 hydroxyl group of ceramide. These additions can be further decorated by additional sugars and sometimes sulfates to yield hundreds of different glycosphingolipid species (21.Merrill Jr., A.H. Sweeley C.C. Vance D. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 309-339Google Scholar). In the yeast S. cerevisiae, however, the direct precursor for glycosphingolipid synthesis is not ceramide but inositolphosphorylceramide (IPC, Ref. 22.Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 305-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). IPC is formed by addition of phosphoinositol released from phosphatidylinositol to ceramide, a reaction catalyzed by IPC synthase in a medial compartment of the yeast Golgi (23.Levine T.P. Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2267-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). IPC is then mannosylated to yield mannosyl-IPC (MIPC), which in turn can receive a second phosphoinositol group from phosphatidylinositol to generate the final and by far most abundant sphingolipid, M(IP)2C (22.Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 305-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). MIPC and M(IP)2C synthesis occurs in the lumen of the Golgi (22.Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 305-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 24.Dean N. Zhang Y.B. Poster J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31908-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Whereas IPC is highly enriched in Golgi and vacuolar membranes, the largest amounts of MIPC and M(IP)2C are found in the plasma membrane (25.Hechtberger P. Zinser E. Saf R. Hummel K. Paltauf F. Daum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Hence, the yeast Golgi seems to be a branching point in sphingolipid trafficking from where mannosylated sphingolipids selectively migrate to the cell surface and sphingolipids without the sugar moiety reach the vacuole. However, direct evidence that mannosylated sphingolipids play a role in cargo sorting to the cell surface is lacking.Addressing the biological function of mannosylated sphingolipids in yeast is hampered by the fact that little is known about the enzyme(s) responsible for their synthesis. Three structurally unrelated genes have been implicated in the mannosylation of IPC. The VRG4 gene encodes a nucleotide sugar transporter that mediates GDP-mannose import into the Golgi lumen (24.Dean N. Zhang Y.B. Poster J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31908-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Besides being essential for IPC mannosylation, VRG4 also affects N-linked and O-linked glycoprotein modifications (24.Dean N. Zhang Y.B. Poster J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31908-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Null mutations in either the CSG1 or CSG2 gene cause a reduction in, but do not completely eliminate MIPC synthesis (26.Beeler T. Gable K. Zhao C. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7279-7284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Csg1p is predicted to have a catalytic function since it contains a region of 93 amino acids with homology to the yeast α-1,6-mannosyltransferase, Och1p (27.Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The function of Csg2p is less obvious. Csg2p contains an EF-Ca2+-binding domain and has been localized to the ER where it may play a role in Ca2+ homeostasis (28.Tanida I. Takita Y. Hasegawa A. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The recent finding that Csg2p forms a complex with Csg1p raises the possibility that IPC mannosyltransferase activity in yeast is regulated by Ca2+ through Csg2p (29.Uemura S. Kihara A. Inokuchi J.I. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45049-45055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Yeast open reading frame YBR161w, recently renamed CSH1, encodes a protein exhibiting strong similarity to the putative sphingolipid mannosyltransferase, Csg1p (27.Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 29.Uemura S. Kihara A. Inokuchi J.I. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45049-45055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here we report that Csh1p is functionally homologous to Csg1p and provide evidence that Csg1p and Csh1p function as two independent sphingolipid mannosyltransferases. Loss of Csg1p and Csh1p had no effect on the delivery of vacuolar proteins or on the packaging of cell surface components into distinct classes of secretory vesicles. From these results, we conclude that the organization of the various post-Golgi delivery pathways in yeast does not depend on production of mannosylated sphingolipids.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Plasmids—Unless indicated otherwise, yeast strains were grown at 28 °C to mid-logarithmic phase (0.5–1.0 OD600) in synthetic dextrose (S.D.) medium or in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YEPD) medium. Yeast transformations were carried out as described (30.Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast mutants Δpep12Δvam3, Δanp1, Δmnn10 and Δvan1 were all derived from the strain SEY6210 (MATα ura3-52 his3 Δ200 leu2-3-112 trpl-Δ901 suc2-Δ9 lys2-801) and have been described elsewhere (31.Holthuis J.C.M.

All other gene deletion phenotypes were characterized in the strain EHY227 (MATα sec6-4 TPI1::SUC2::TRP1 ura3-52 his3 Δ200 leu2-3-112 trp1-1). For the deletion of CSG1, CSH1, and IPT1 genes, 450–550 base pair fragments of the promoter and ORF 3′-end of each gene were amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA. The gene promoters and ORF ends were cloned into NotI/EcoRI and SpeI/MluI sites located on either site of a loxP-HIS3-loxP cassette that was ligated into the EcoRI/SpeI sites of a pBluescript KS– vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA; the loxP-HIS3-loxP plasmid was a gift of T. Levine, University College London, UK). Gene deletion constructs were linearized with NotI and MluI and transformed into EHY227 to generate Δcsg1 (JHY075), Δcsh1 (JHY088), and Δipt1 (JHY079) strains. Double deletions were performed sequentially in EHY227 by repeated use of the loxP-HIS3-loxP cassette and subsequent removal of the HIS3 marker by excisive recombination using Cre recombinase (33.Sauer B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 2087-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), yielding the Δcsg1Δcsh1 strain (JHY090). In each case, the correct integration or excision event was confirmed by PCR.Aur1p was tagged at its C terminus with three copies of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope using the PCR knock-in approach (34.Wach A. Brachat A. Alberti-Segui C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and plasmid p3xHAt-HIS5 (S. Munro, MRC-LMB, Cambridge, UK). Pma1p was tagged at its N terminus with one copy of the HA epitope using integration plasmid pRS305Δ51 as described (35.Ziman M. Chuang J.S. Schekman R.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1909-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Vam3p was tagged at its N terminus with three copies of the HA epitope using integration plasmid pRS405(HA)3VAM3 (B. Nichols, MRC-LMB, Cambridge, UK). Expression plasmids encoding Myc-tagged invertase, Myc-tagged Mnt1p and GFP-tagged Sed5p have been described previously (23.Levine T.P. Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2267-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Promoter regions (650 bp) and open reading frames of CSG1 and CSH1 were PCR-amplified from yeast genomic DNA and subsequently ligated into single copy vector pRS413 (CEN, HIS3) or multicopy vector pRS425 (2μ, LEU2) (36.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second version of these constructs was prepared, but then with 3 copies of the HA epitope fused to the C termini of CSG1 and CSH1, using PCR.Lipid Analysis—Exponentially grown cells (0.5 OD600) were inoculated in 5 ml of S.D. medium containing 10 μCi myo-[3H]inositol (16 Ci/mmol; ICN Biomedicals, Eschwege) and grown for 16 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 10 mm NaN3 and lipids extracted by bead bashing in H2O/methanol/chloroform (5: 16:16). The organic extracts were dried and subjected to butyl alcohol/water partitioning. Lipids recovered from the butyl alcohol phase were deacylated by mild base treatment using 0.2 n NaOH in methanol. After neutralizing with 1 m acetic acid, lipids were extracted with chloroform and separated by TLC using chloroform/methanol/4.2 m NH3 (9:7:3). The TLC plate was dipped in 0.4% 2,5-diphenyloxazol dissolved in 2-methylnaphthalene supplemented with 10% xylene (37.Bonner W.M. Stedman J.D. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 89: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and 3H-labeled lipids detected by fluorography using Kodak X-Omat S films exposed at –80 °C. Alternatively, 3H-labeled lipids were detected by exposure to BAS-TR2040 imaging screens (Fuji, Japan) and read out on a BIO-RAD Personal Molecular Imager (BioRad, Hercules, CA).Analysis of IPC Mannosyltransferase Activity in Cell Extracts—Exponentially grown Δcsg1Δcsh1 cells (2.5 OD600) were inoculated in 50 ml S.D. medium containing 100 μCi myo-[3H]inositol and then grown for 16 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 10 mm NaN3, and lysed by bead bashing in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm NEM) in the presence of fresh protease inhibitors. After removal of unbroken cells (500 × g, 10 min), membranes were collected (100,000 × g, 60 min) and solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% and fresh protease inhibitors. After incubation for 60 min at room temperature, the extract was centrifuged (100,000 × g, 60 min), and 50-μl aliquots were stored at –80 °C. In addition, 400 OD600 of non-radiolabeled, exponentially-grown wild-type or Δcsg1Δcsh1 cells transformed with multicopy CSG1, CSH1, or control plasmids were lysed by bead bashing in 4 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing fresh protease inhibitors. Upon removal of unbroken cells, total membranes were collected, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and rotated at 4 °C for 60 min.For IPC mannosyltransferase assays, 50 μl of radiolabeled extract was mixed with 150 μl of unlabeled extract and then preincubated with 10 mm GDP-mannose (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were diluted 10-fold in lysis buffer and then incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 6.4 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:2.2). Lipids were extracted, deacylated, and separated by TLC as above.Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Peptides corresponding to C-terminal regions of Csg1p and Csh1p (Fig. 1) were synthesized and then coupled to a carrier before immunization of rabbits. The resulting antisera were affinity-purified against peptides coupled to NHS-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow according to instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Affinity-purified antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1000 for immunoblot analysis and at 1:250 for immunofluorescence microscopy. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to CPY, Gos1p, Pep12p, Tlg1p, and Tlg2p were described previously (38.Holthuis J.C.M. Nichols B.J. Dhruvakumar S. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Sso2p were provided by S. Keränen, (Biotechnology and Food Research, Espoo, Finland) and to Gas1p by H. Riezman (Sciences II, Geneve, Switzerland). The Myc epitope was detected with mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 or with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the HA epitope with rat monoclonal antibody 3F10, mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science) or rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For immunoblotting, all antibody incubations were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% dried milk and 0.5% Tween-20. After incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad), blots were developed using a chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce). Chemiluminescent bands were quantified using a GS-710 calibrating imaging densitometer (BioRad) with QuantityOne software.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Exponentially grown cells were fixed and mounted on glass-slides as described previously (38.Holthuis J.C.M. Nichols B.J. Dhruvakumar S. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). All antibody incubations were performed in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2% dried milk and 0.1% saponin for 2 h at room temperature. Primary polyclonal antibodies to Csg1p, Csh1p, and the rat monoclonal 9F10 to HA were used at a dilution of 1:400, 1:150, and 1:250 respectively. Fluorescein- or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used at a dilution of 1:100. Fluorescence microscopy and image acquisition were carried out using a Leica DMRA microscope (Leitz, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (KX85, Apogee Instruments Inc., Tucson, AZ) driven by Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD).Fractionation of Secretory Vesicles—Exponentially grown sec6-4 cells expressing HA-tagged Pma1p (2.0 OD600) were inoculated into YEPD medium (500-ml culture per gradient) and then grown for 14–16 h at 25 °C to 0.7 OD600/ml. Next, cells were collected (500 × g, 5 min) resuspended in 250 ml of YEPD and then shifted to 38 °C for 60 min to induce the sec6–4 secretory block. Spheroplasting, cell lysis, and collection of membrane pellet enriched in secretory vesicles (SVs) were performed essentially as described (7.Harsay E. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) except that SVs were collected on a 60% Nycodenz cushion in lysis buffer. SVs were resuspended in 1.5 ml of lysis buffer adjusted to 30% Nycodenz and then loaded at the bottom of a 11-ml linear 16–26% Nycodenz/0.8 M sorbitol gradient. Following centrifugation at 100,000 × gav for 16 h min at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor, 0.6-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. Fraction densities were determined by reading refractive indices on a Bausch and Lomb refractometer. Equal amounts per fraction were subjected to immunoblotting and analyzed for ATPase and invertase enzyme activity as described (7.Harsay E. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).Immunoisolation of Secretory Vesicles—Immunoisolations of Pma1p-HA-containing SVs were performed using magnetic Dynabeads protein G (Dynal Biotech GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) loaded with mouse anti-HA (12CA5) or anti-Myc (9E10) monoclonal antibodies. Beads were incubated with antibodies for 40 min at room temperature and antibodies bound quantified by SDS-PAGE. Anti-HA beads contained 0.35 μgof 12CA5/μl of bead-slurry and control beads contained 0.1 μg of 9E10/μl bead-slurry. For immunoisolation of Pma1p-containing vesicles, a 300-μl reaction was prepared in lysis buffer containing 126 μl Dynabeads slurry, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 15 μl membranes from Nycodenz gradient PM-ATPase peak fractions obtained by fractionating membranes derived from 1 g of cells. The reactions were rotated gently at 4 °C for 2 h. Supernatants were subjected to centrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C), and membrane pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. Beads were washed twice for 30 min in 1 ml of bovine serum albumin-containing lysis buffer, twice in lysis buffer, and resuspended in 75 μl of SDS sample buffer. Bound and unbound membranes were analyzed by immunoblotting.RESULTSCSH1 Encodes a Novel Putative IPC Mannosyltransferase— Comparative sequence analysis revealed that Csh1p is 67% identical to Csg1p and has the same predicted protein topology, namely a putative N-terminal signal sequence and two potential transmembrane segments localized to the C-terminal half of the protein (Fig. 1). Between the signal sequence and first transmembrane segment there is a region of 93 residues sharing 29% identity with the luminal portion (residues 96–197) of the yeast α-1,6-mannosyltransferase, Och1p (39.Nakayama K. Nagasu T. Shimma Y. Kuromitsu J. Jigami Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2511-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This region contains a conserved DXD motif that occurs in a wide range of glycosyltransferase families and likely forms part of a catalytic site (40.Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar).Csg1p is required for accumulation of mannosylated sphingolipids in yeast and its similarity to Och1p suggests that the protein serves as an IPC mannosyltransferase (27.Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, loss of Csg1p is not sufficient to abolish IPC mannosylation (see also below), raising the possibility that Csh1p represents an alternative IPC mannosyltransferase that functions independently of Csg1p. To investigate this possibility, we constructed yeast strains in which the ORFs of CSG1, CSH1, or both were removed. TLC analysis of alkaline-treated lipid extracts prepared from myo-[3H]inositol-labeled cells showed that, compared with the wild-type strain, the Δcsg1 mutant produced greatly reduced levels of the mannosylated sphingolipids MIPC and M(IP)2C, and accumulated IPC-C and IPC-D (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2; note that IPC-C contains a monohydroxylated C26 fatty acid whereas the C26 fatty acid in IPC-D is dihydroxylated; (41.Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Unlike Δcsg1 cells, the Δcsh1 mutant produced IPC and mannosylated IPC species at ratios similar to those in wild-type cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 3). In the Δcsg1Δcsh1 double mutant, however, production of MIPC and M(IP)2C was completely abolished (Fig. 2A, lane 4). These results are consistent with those reported in a recent study (29.Uemura S. Kihara A. Inokuchi J.I. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45049-45055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and indicate that Csg1p and Csh1p have redundant functions in IPC mannosylation.Fig. 2Csg1p and Csh1p have redundant functions in sphingolipid mannosylation. A, deletion of CSG1 and CSH1 abolishes IPC mannosylation. Yeast cells were labeled overnight with myo-[3H]inositol and the lipid extracts either deacylated by mild alkaline hydrolysis with NaOH (+) or control incubated (–). Lipids were extracted, separated by TLC, and then visualized by autoradiography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lane 1, wild-type; lane 2, Δcsg1; lane 3, Δcsh1; lane 4, Δcsg1Δcsh1; lanes 5 and 6, Δipt1. Note that IPT1 is known to have an essential function in M(IP)2C synthesis. B, analysis of IPC mannosyltransferase activity in Triton X-100 extracts derived from wild-type and Δcsg1Δcsh1 cells. Extracts prepared from myo-[3H]inositol-labeled Δcsg1Δcsh1 cells were either control-incubated (lane 1) or mixed with extracts of unlabeled wild-type cells (lanes 2 and 3), Δcsg1Δcsh1 cells (lane 4), or Δcsg1Δcsh1 cells transformed with a multicopy vector containing CSG1 (lane 5) or CSH1 (lane 6). Incubations were performed in the presence (+) or absence (–) of 1 mm GDP-mannose as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lipids were extracted, deacylated, and then separated by TLC before autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The block in MIPC and M(IP)2C synthesis observed in Δcsg1Δcsh1 cells can be explained by a complete loss of IPC mannosyltransferase activity, but may also be due to a defective delivery of IPC or GDP-mannose to the transferase-containing compartment. To explore these possibilities, we analyzed the IPC mannosyltransferase activity in detergent extracts derived from wild-type and Δcsg1Δcsh1 cells. To this end, Triton X-100 extracts prepared from myo-[3H]inositol-labeled Δcsg1Δcsh1 cells were mixed with extracts from unlabeled wild-type or mutant cells, and then incubated in the presence or absence of externally added GDP-mannose. When extracts from inositol-labeled Δcsg1Δcsh1 cells were incubated with unlabeled wild-type cell extracts, radioactive IPC was converted to MIPC and M(IP)2C"
https://openalex.org/W2146021917,"SAPK/JNK, which belongs to the family of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), is activated by many types of cellular stresses or extracellular signals and is involved in embryonic development, immune responses, and cell survival or apoptosis. However, the physiological roles of SAPK/JNK in the signaling of stress-induced apoptosis are still controversial. To evaluate the precise function, SAPK/JNK-inactivated mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were generated by disrupting genes of the MAPK activators, SEK1 and MKK7. Although SAPK/JNK activation by various stresses was completely abolished in sek1–/– mkk7–/– ES cells, apoptotic responses including DNA fragmentation and caspase 3 activation still occurred normally, which displays a sharp contrast to apaf1–/– ES cells exhibiting profound defects in the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. These normal apoptotic responses without SAPK/JNK activation were also observed in fibroblasts derived from sek1–/– mkk7–/– ES cells. Instead, interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced IL-6 gene expression was greatly suppressed in sek1–/– mkk7–/– fibroblasts. These results clearly show that SAPK/JNK activation is responsible for the inflammatory cytokine-induced gene expression but not essentially required for the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis at least in ES or fibroblast-like cells, which are prototypes of all cell lineages.

Apoptosis or programmed cell death is critical for many biological events such as embryonic development, immune responses, and tissue homeostasis in multicellular organisms. In mammalian cells, apoptotic signaling cascades can be divided into two broad categories: the intrinsic (mitochondria-dependent) and the extrinsic (death receptor-mediated) pathways. The initiation of mitochondria-dependent pathway requires a change in the organella membrane permeability that is prevented by anti-apoptotic molecules such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and promoted by pro-apoptotic molecules including Bax and Bak, and the permeability change results in the release of mitochondrial proteins. One of the released proteins, cytochrome c, associates with Apaf1 and caspase 9 to activate the effector caspase 3 (1.Peng L. Deepak N. Imawati B. Srinivasa M.S. Manzoor A. Emad S.A. Xiaodong W.

Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar). Cellular stresses such as UV irradiation and heat shock mediate apoptosis through the mitochondria-dependent pathway (3.Yoshida H. Kong Y.-Y. Yoshida R. Elia A.J. Hakem A. Hakem R. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). However, upstream signaling that regulates the pro-apoptotic molecules remains to be elucidated.

The activated SAPK/JNK phosphorylates a number of substrates including the c-Jun component of the activator protein-1 transcription factor to regulate gene expression for the stress responses. Activation of SAPK/JNK requires the dual phosphorylation of Tyr and Thr residues located in a Thr-Pro-Tyr motif of the MAPK, and two kinases, SEK1 (also known as MKK4) and MKK7 (SEK2), are responsible for the phosphorylation (4.Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3633) Google Scholar, 5.Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4382) Google Scholar, 6.Manning A.M. Davis R.J. Nature Rev. Mol. Drug Disc. 2003; 2: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). SEK1 and MKK7 preferentially phosphorylate the Tyr and Thr residues of SAPK/JNK, respectively (7.Lawler S. Fleming Y. Goedert M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1387-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Tyr phosphorylation by SEK1 is sequentially followed by the Thr phosphorylation by MKK7 in stress-stimulated mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (8.Wada T. Nakagawa K. Watanabe T. Nishitai G. Seo J. Kishimoto H. Kitagawa D. Sasaki T. Penninger J.M. Nishina H. Katada T. J. Biol.

Targeted gene-disruption experiments in mice demonstrate that both SEK1 and MKK7 are required for embryonic development. Sek1–/– embryos die between embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) and E12.5 with impaired liver formation and massive apoptosis (10.Ganiatsas S. Kwee L. Fujiwara Y. Perkins A. Ikeda T. Labow M.A. Zon L.I. Proc.

Kishimoto H. Iwatsubo T. Katada T. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Development. 1999; 126: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that SEK1-mediated SAPK/JNK pathway downstream TNF-α receptor 1 participates in embryonic hepatoblast proliferation and survival via a pathway different from NF-κB-induced anti-apoptosis. On the other hand, mkk7–/– embryos die between E11.5 and 12.5 with similar defects in liver formation. These results indicate that SAPK/JNK activation mediated through SEK1 plus MKK7 plays indispensable roles in hepatoblast proliferation and survival during mouse embryogenesis (12.Watanabe T. Nakagawa K. Ohata S. Kitagawa D. Nishitai G. Seo J. Tanemura S. Shimizu N. Kishimoto H. Wada T. Aoki J. Arai H. Iwatsubo T. Mochita M. Watanabe T. Satake M. Ito Y. Matsuyama T. Mak T.W. Penninger J.M. Nishina H. Katada T. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 332-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of SAPK/JNK activation in cell survival and apoptosis is still controversial, being suggested to have an anti-apoptotic, pro-apoptotic, or no function in these processes (13.Lin A. BioEssays. 2002; 25: 17-24Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Mice lacking both JNK1 and JNK2 (Jnk1–/– Jnk2–/–) die around E11 with defective neural tube morphogenesis and altered apoptosis (14.Kuan C.-Y. Yang D.D. Roy D.R.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A.

Dev. 1999; 89: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These results assign both pro- and anti-apoptotic functions to JNK1 and JNK2 in the development. It also appears that the SAPK/JNK pathway functions in a manner dependent on the types of cells and stimulus, and its different components can sometimes play opposing roles in apoptosis. The most convincing evidence to date that shows that the involvement of SAPK/JNK activation in pro-apoptotic function comes from Jnk1–/– Jnk2–/– and mkk4–/– mkk7–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Both Jnk1–/– Jnk2–/– and mkk4–/– mkk7–/– MEFs exhibited profound defects in stress-induced apoptosis (16.Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that active JNK causes the release of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c and Smac from isolated mitochondria in a cell-free system (18.Aoki H. Kang P.M.

These results strongly indicate that the SAPK/JNK activation directly regulates mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in pro-apoptotic direction. To evaluate the exact role of SAPK/JNK activation in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, we here utilized mouse ES cells in terms of the following advantages. 1) ES cells are a prototype of all cell lineages and can be differentiated into MEF-like cells with retinoic acid. 2) ES cells do not express death receptors including Fas and TNF-α receptor 1 but have stress-induced mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway. 3) The molecular mechanism of SAPK/JNK activation is well characterized in ES cells. The present results clearly show that SAPK/JNK activation is not required for the stress-induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in ES and MEF-like cells. Instead, we found that IL-1-induced IL-6 gene expression was greatly impaired in MEF derived from sek1–/– mkk7–/– ES cells.

Generation of ES Cells Lacking Both SEK1 and MKK7—sek1 and mkk7 genes were disrupted as shown in Fig. 2a.

Assay of SAPK/JNK Activity—ES cells were plated at 1.5 × 106 cells/35-mm dish and cultured for overnight. The cells were stimulated by anisomycin (Sigma, 5 μg/ml), cisplatinum (Sigma, 50 μm), etoposide (Sigma, 2 μg/ml), thapsigargin (Sigma, 200 nm), tunicamycin (Sigma, 10 μg/ml), UV (1 kJ/m2, UV Stratalinker 1800, Stratagene), and heat shock (44 °C for 20 min). SAPK/JNK proteins were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 2 h using the anti-SAPK/JNK antibody (C-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.).

The amount of the precipitated SAPK/JNK that had been monitored by immunoblotting with the anti-SAPK/JNK (FL) antibody was almost constant in a series of the present experiments. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—ES cells (2 × 106 cells) were suspended at 4 °C in 0.2 ml of a lysis buffer consisting of 1% Nonidet P-40, 80 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, and 4 μg/ml aprotinin. The cell lysates were incubated for 30 min and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and probed with antibodies against anti-SAPK/JNK1, anti-ERK2, anti-p38, and anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK. The bands were visualized by SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate for the development of immunoblots utilizing a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). For detection of phospho-p38, cells were lysed directly in Laemmli sample buffer and sonicated by Ultrasonic Disruptor (TOMY) followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.

DNA Fragmentation Assay—ES cells (2 × 106 cells), which had been attached to and detached from culture dishes after stimuli, were collected by means of incubation with trypsin/EDTA and centrifugation, respectively. The cells were mixed, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and collected by centrifugation. After removing the supernatants, the cells were lysed in 0.33 ml of a buffer consisting of 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100. After centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and insoluble fraction, the cell lysates were subjected to phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation for DNA purification. The precipitated DNA was suspended in 20 μl of H2O and treated with 50 μg/ml RNase for 30 min at 37 °C. The DNA samples (10 μl) were subjected to electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and visualized by a UV illuminator (22.Kitagawa D. Tanemura S. Ohata S. Shimizu N. Seo J. Nishitai G. Watanabe T.

Assay of Caspase 3 Activity—ES cells were harvested as described above and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells, after being resuspended in 50 μl of a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, were frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at 37 °C three times. The cell lysates (50 μg) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 20 μm acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp α-(4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide) (DEVD-MCA; Peptide Institute, Inc.) in the final volume of 50 μl in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. The reaction was terminated by adding 450 μl of ice-cold H2O, and substrate cleavage leading to the release of free MCA was monitored (excitation 355 nm and emission 460 nm) at room temperature (22.Kitagawa D.

Sub-G1 Assay—For flow-cytometric analysis, cells were first fixed with 70% ethanol and further incubated with 10 μg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were stained in a solution (50 μg of propidium iodide/ml, 0.1% sodium citrate, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 30 min at 4 °C. The apoptotic sub-G1 population was determined by FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with Cell Quest software (23.Nishina H. Bachmann M. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Kozieradzki I. Fischer K.D. Odermatt B. Wakeham A. Shahinian A. Takimoto H. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. Penninger J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation—ES cells (1 × 107 cells) were harvested by cell scraper (SUMILON) and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells, after being resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A consisting of 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm Na-EGTA, 1.5 mm Na-EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin, were homogenized 10 strokes by a 27-gauge syringe. After homogenization, cells were centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei, unbroken cells, and large debris. Supernatants containing mitochondria were transferred to a new tube and further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Mitochondrial pellets were washed in 100 μl of buffer A followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and lysed in 1.5× Laemmli sample buffer. The samples (10 μl) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was probed with the anti-Bax and mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 antibodies. Northern Blotting—Total RNA was prepared from differentiated ES cells by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), separated by formamide agarose gel, and transferred to a Hybond-XL (Amersham Biosciences). IL-6 and β-actin were detected by Northern blotting using the specific DNA probes. The cDNA fragments corresponding to mouse IL-6 and β-actin were amplified using the following primers: IL-6, 5′-ATG AAG TTC CTC TCT GCA AGA GAC T-3′ and 5′-CAC TAG GTT TGC CGA GTA GAT CTC-3′, and β-actin, 5′-CAT CAC TAT TGG CAA CGA GC-3′ and 5′-ACG CAG CTC AGT AAC AGT CC-3′. All of the experiments were repeated at least three times with different batches of the cell samples, and the results were fully reproducible. Hence, most of the data shown are representative of several independent experiments. Various Stresses Induce Apoptosis through Mitochondria in Mouse ES Cells—We first investigated the thermotolerance effect on apoptosis in ES cells, which protects cells against successive stress by the pretreatment of mild heat shock. For this mechanism, a recent study revealed that HSP70 and HSP27 induced by thermotolerance suppress mitochondria-dependent apoptosis by directly associating with Apaf1 and cytochrome c and blocking the assembly of a functional apoptosome (24.Beere H.M. Wolf B.B. Cain K. Mosser D.D. Mahboubi A. Kuwana T. Tailor P. Morimoto R.I. Cohen G.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 25.Saleh A.

Diaz-Latoud C. Gurbuxani S. Arrigo A.-P. Kroemer G. Solary E. Garrido C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, various stresses could induce DNA ladder formation (Fig. 1a) and caspase 3 activation, which was measured by DEVD cleavage (Fig. 1b) in wild-type ES cells. However, these apoptotic responses were markedly attenuated by the thermotolerance treatment. To confirm the involvement of Apaf1 in the stress-induced apoptosis, ES cells lacking Apaf1 (apaf1–/–) (3.Yoshida H. Kong Y.-Y. Yoshida R. Elia A.J. Hakem A. Hakem R. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar) were subjected to the same experiments. As shown in Fig. 1c, apoptosis in response to various stresses including heat shock, UV, cisplatinum, etoposide, thapsigargin, and tunicamycin was almost completely blocked in apaf1–/– ES cells. These results clearly show that the stress-induced apoptosis is mediated through mitochondria in ES cells. Stress-induced SAPK/JNK Activation Is Impaired in ES Cells Lacking both MKK4 and MKK7—To examine the role of SAPK/JNK activation in the stress-induced and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, ES cells lacking both MKK4 and MKK7 were generated. For generation of the null mutant, we constructed a novel mkk7-targeting vector containing puromycin-resistant cassette (Fig. 2a), and disrupted sek1 and mkk7 genes as described previously (9.Kishimoto H. Nakagawa K. Watanabe T. Kitagawa D. Momose H. Seo J. Nishitai G. Shimizu N. Ohata S. Tanemura S. Asaka S. Goto T. Fukushi H. Yoshida H. Suzuki A. Sasaki T. Wada T. Penninger J.M. Nishina H. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16595-16601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20.Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvanyi L. Shahinian A. Hakem R. Rubie E.A. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The mutant sek1(neo/neo) mkk7(puro/del) clones thus generated lack both SEK1 and MKK7 completely (Fig. 2b), and these clones are used as sek1–/– mkk7–/– ES cells in this study. As shown in Fig. 2c, not only stress-induced activation but also the basal level of SAPK/JNK was completely lost in sek1–/– mkk7–/– ES cells. Stress-induced Apoptosis Is Still Observed in sek1–/– mkk7–/– ES Cells—To examine the SAPK/JNK-inactivation effect, various apoptotic responses including caspase 3 activation, DNA fragmentation, and sub-G1 population were further analyzed in sek1–/– mkk7–/– ES cells in comparison with wild-type and apaf1–/– ES cells (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, the apoptotic responses were still observed clearly in sek1–/– mkk7–/– ES cells at the same levels as wild-type ES cells. In sharp contrast, such responses were almost completely abolished in apaf1–/– cells. The dose dependence and time course of etoposide-induced apoptosis were also the same between sek1–/– mkk7–/– and wild-type ES cells (Fig. 3d and data not shown). Thus, the SAPK/JNK inactivation appears to exert no influence on the stress-induced apoptosis in ES cells. No Involvement of p38 Activation in Stress-induced Apoptosis in sek1–/– mkk7–/– ES Cells—Since it has been reported that another stress-responsive MAPK, p38, plays a pro-apoptotic role under certain conditions (27.Xia Z.G. Dickens M. Raigeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5032) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of a p38 inhibitor (SB203580) on UV stress-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 4, SB203580 markedly suppressed the phosphorylation of p38 but failed to inhibit the stress-induced apoptosis both in wild-type and sek1–/– mkk7–/– ES cells. These results indicate that p38 activation is not responsible for the stress-induced apoptosis in ES cells. No Requirement of SAPK/JNK Activation for Bax Translocation in ES Cells—The above results shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3 suggest that SAPK/JNK activation is not required for mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in ES cells. We next measured the initiation step of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, the translocation of Bax from cytoplasm to mitochondrial membranes, since it has been recently reported that SAPK/JNK activation potentiates Bax-dependent apoptosis in neuronal cells (28.Putcha G.V. Le S. Frank S. Besirli C.G. Clark K. Chu B. Alix S. Youle R.J. LaMarche A. Maroney A.C. Johnson Jr, E.M. Neuron. 2003; 38: 899-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the time courses of the Bax translocation in response to UV irradiation in sek1–/– mkk7–/–, apaf1–/–, and wild-type ES cells. There were no significant differences among the three types of ES cells. These results clearly show that SAPK/JNK activation is not required for the initiation of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in ES cells. Stress-induced Apoptosis Is Also Observable in sek1–/– mkk7–/– MEF-like Cells—Since it has recently been reported that SAPK/JNK is crucial for stress-induced apoptosis in MEF (16.Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar, 17.Tournier C. Dong C. Turner T.K. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), ES cells were treated with retinoic acid and induced to differentiate into MEF-like cells. As shown in Fig. 6, stress-induced apoptosis measured by DNA fragmentation was also observed at the same level between sek1–/– mkk7–/– and wild-type MEF-like cells as had been observed in non-differentiated ES cells (see Fig. 3b). These results indicate that SAPK/JNK inactivation does not exert its influence on the stress-induced apoptosis in MEF-like cells as well as in ES cells. IL-1-induced IL-6 Gene Expression Is Impaired in sek1–/– mkk7–/– MEF-like Cells—To understand the physiological role of SAPK/JNK activation in ES or MEF-like cells, we examined gene expression induced by an inflammatory cytokine, IL-1. As shown in Fig. 7a, IL-6 mRNA was induced at 1 and 6 h in wild-type cells. However, this induction was greatly inhibited in sek1–/– mkk7–/– MEF-like cells, which express IL-1 receptors. Furthermore, the IL-1-dependent IL-6 expression was greatly suppressed by adding the JNK inhibitor SP600125 in wild-type MEF-like cells (Fig. 7b). Thus, SAPK/JNK activation appears to play an important role in the inflammatory cytokine-induced gene expression rather than the apoptotic responses at least in ES or MEF-like cells. In the previous study, we have reported that sek1–/– thymocytes are susceptible to Fas/CD95- and CD3-mediated apoptosis and that apoptosis is increased in sek1–/– hepatoblasts (11.Nishina H. Vaz C. Billia P. Nghiem M. Sasaki T. Pompa J.L. Furlonger K. Paige C. Hui C.-C. Fischer K.D. Kishimoto H. Iwatsubo T. Katada T. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M.

Nature. 1997; 385: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These results indicate that SAPK/JNK activation is involved in cell survival. However, it has been reported that Jnk1–/– Jnk2–/– and mkk4–/– mkk7–/– MEFs are resistant to UV-induced apoptosis (16.Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar, 17.Tournier C. Dong C. Turner T.K. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there are many other reports supporting the involvement of SAPK/JNK activation both in cell survival and in apoptosis. Thus, the role of SAPK/JNK in cell survival and apoptosis is still controversial (13.Lin A. BioEssays. 2002; 25: 17-24Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Our present results do not support the concept that “SAPK/JNK activation is required for the stress-induced and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis” (4.Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3633) Google Scholar, 16.Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), at least in ES and MEF-like cells, based on the following findings. First, SAPK/JNK activation is completely dependent on the existence of both SEK1 and MKK7 in mouse ES cells in which stress-induced apoptosis is mediated through mitochondria (Fig. 1). The mutant sek1–/– mkk7–/– ES cells had a defect in the SAPK/JNK activation in response to a variety of stimuli (Fig. 2) but displayed normal stress-induced apoptosis as the same level as wild-type cells (Fig. 3). Another stress-responsive MAPK, p38, was not involved in the stress-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4). Second, Bax was capable of translocating into mitochondrial membranes in response to UV irradiation in sek1–/– mkk7–/– ES cells as observed in the wild-type cells (Fig. 5). Third, the apoptosis in response to various stresses such as UV, etoposide, tunicamycin, and anisomycin occurred even in sek1–/– mkk7–/– MEF-like cells. Therefore, there must be a SAPK/JNK-independent signaling that is required for the initiation of stress-induced apoptosis in ES and MEF-like cells. To examine the involvement of MKK7 in cell cycle and senescence, we have recently prepared mkk7–/– MEFs from mouse embryos. Interestingly, early passaged wild-type and mkk7–/– MEFs showed comparable extent and kinetics of cell death in response to UV irradiation; however, at late time points of culture (after getting cellular immortality), mkk7–/– MEFs displayed a resistance to the UV-induced apoptosis. 2T. Wada, N. Joza, H.-Y. M. Cheng, T. Sasaki, I. Kozieradzki, M. Nghiem, K. Bachmaier, T. Katada, H. Nishina, and J. M. Penninger, submitted for publication. These results suggested that the resistance to UV response observed in Jnk1–/– Jnk2–/– and mkk4–/– mkk7–/– MEFs (16.Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar, 17.Tournier C. Dong C. Turner T.K. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) might have some relations to cellular immortality. Because SAPK/JNK activation is crucial for hepatoblast proliferation (12.Watanabe T. Nakagawa K. Ohata S. Kitagawa D. Nishitai G. Seo J. Tanemura S. Shimizu N. Kishimoto H. Wada T. Aoki J. Arai H. Iwatsubo T. Mochita M. Watanabe T. Satake M. Ito Y. Matsuyama T. Mak T.W. Penninger J.M. Nishina H. Katada T. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 332-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the immortalized MEFs may lose the regulation of checkpoint in cell cycle and result in resistance to stress-induced apoptosis due to impaired G1 growth arrest. Therefore, it will be interesting to find out whether re-expression of JNK1 plus JNK2 in Jnk1–/– Jnk2–/– or MKK4 plus MKK7 in mkk4–/– mkk7–/– MEFs can restore the apoptotic response to UV stress. However, recent reports with Jnk1–/– Jnk2–/– mice clearly show that SAPK/JNK activation is required not only for anti-apoptosis but also for pro-apoptosis in the development of mouse fetal brain (14.Kuan C.-Y. Yang D.D. Roy D.R.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 15.Sabapathy K. Jochum W. Hochedlinger K. Chang L. Karin M. Wagner E.F. Mech. Dev. 1999; 89: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). There was a reduction of cell death in the lateral edges of hind brain prior to neural tube closure. In contrast, there was increased apoptosis and caspase activation in the forebrain in Jnk1–/– Jnk2–/– mouse embryos. Thus, SAPK/JNK activation plays a pro-apoptotic role under some circumstances. SAPK/JNK activation may be involved in regulating apoptosis indirectly rather than directly. SAPK/JNK is activated in T cells by co-stimulation with antigen and CD28 receptors and regulates the production of growth factor IL-2 and cell proliferation (29.Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Benneriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported impaired CD28-mediated IL-2 production and proliferation in sek1–/– T lymphocytes (23.Nishina H. Bachmann M. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Kozieradzki I. Fischer K.D. Odermatt B. Wakeham A. Shahinian A. Takimoto H. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. Penninger J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that activation of wild-type CD8+ T cells in the presence of different concentrations of SP600125 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-2 production and cell proliferation (30.Conze D.

Thus, SAPK/JNK activation plays an important role in T cell functions. IL-1 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine in inflamed tissues, and the molecular mechanism of IL-1-induced gene expression will yield novel molecular targets for anti-inflammatory therapy. It has been reported that SAPK/JNK activation is required for the gene expression of a cytokine IL-6 and a chemokine IL-8 in a human epidermal carcinoma cell line by using overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant or antisense RNA of SAPKβ (31.Krause A.

These results indicate that IL-1-mediated activation of SAPK/JNK induces the phosphorylation of a Jun family of component(s) of activator protein-1, resulting in the gene expression of IL-6 and IL-8. In this study, we have also observed the impaired IL-1-mediated IL-6 gene expression both in sek1–/– mkk7–/– MEF-like cells and in SP600125-treated wild-type cells (Fig. 7). These results provide the first genetic link between SAPK/JNK activation and IL-6 gene expression using gene-disrupted cells and also indicate that SAPK/JNK activation provides a crucial and specific signal for immune responses. Thus, the molecular switch, SAPK/JNK activation, regulates cell proliferation and gene expression in embryonic development and immune responses rather than stress-induced apoptosis.

As for the synthetic mechanism, there are two alternative manners for the sugar elongation process. Some bacterial HASs add new sugars to the non-reducing end of the acceptor to grow polymers. On the other hand, some vertebrate enzymes seem to transfer sugars to the reducing end. Expression of vertebrate HASs as active and soluble proteins will accelerate further precise insight into mechanisms of sugar elongation reactions by natural HASs. Since large scale production of HA polymers and oligomers would become powerful tools both for basic studies and new biotechnology to create functional carbohydrates in medicinal purposes, advent of an efficient method for the expression of HASs in Escherichia coli is strongly expected. Here we communicate the first success of the production of recombinant human HAS2 proteins composed of only the catalytic region in E. coli as the active form. It was demonstrated that an engineered HAS2 expressed in E. coli exhibited significant activity to synthesize a mixture of HAS oligomers from 8-mer (HA8) to 16-mer (HA16). Engineered HAS2 prepared herein elongated sugars from exogenous tetrasaccharide to form polymers with a direction to the non-reducing end.

HA is a major constituent of glycosaminoglycan in the extracellular matrix of most tissues and organs, and this polysaccharide plays important roles in cell migration, proliferation, and the development of tissue architecture. The enzymes responsible for the synthesis of HA, HAS genes have been cloned from bacteria to mammalian cells (1.DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol.

HASs are the first glycosyltransferases that can catalyze transfer reactions of two distinct sugars in contrast to the vast majority of other known glycosyltransferases, which transfer only one saccharide moiety (6.Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 7.Yoshida M. Itano N. Yamada Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 497-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). HASs are classified into two groups, Class I and Class II, based on the homology of amino acid sequences and topology. PmHAS from Pasteurella multocida is the only one known member of the Class II HAS. On the other hand, Class I HASs include streptococcal, viral, and vertebrate enzymes. In human HASs, for example, there have been three related enzymes, HAS1 (8.Shyjan A.M. Heldin P. Butcher E.C. Yoshino T. Briskin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23395-23399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), HAS2 (5.Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22945-22948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and HAS3 (9.Spicer A.P. Olson J.S. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8957-8961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Particularly it was reported that HAS2 shows much higher enzyme activity and produces the highest molecular weight of HA among common HASs (10.Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1923-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 11.Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y.

Human HAS2 was cloned in 1996 by Yamaguchi et al. (5.Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22945-22948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and it was suggested that this enzyme seems to have the most potent enzymatic activity among the known human HASs from a viewpoint of the possibility for the production of engineered glycosyltransferases used in enzyme-assisted glycosynthetic strategy (12.Nishimura S.-I. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13.Nishimura S.-I. Yamada K. J. Am. Chem.

The peptide chains of the Class I HASs in the membrane region also have similar predicted topologies (15.Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). As for the HAS activity, it seems that the proteins should have five to seven membrane-associated regions and a cytoplasmic region (16.DeAngelis P.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This large central cytoplasmic domain of about 260–320 amino acid residues is flanked by two membrane-associated regions at the amino and the carboxyl terminus. The efficient synthetic process of HA molecules at the plasma membrane clearly suggests that the required enzymatic machinery of the Class I HASs would be located in a specific cytoplasmic region and/or at the cell membrane domains. However, it should be noted that the exact catalytic regions of Class I HASs have not been previously identified. In regard to the synthetic mechanism of HA, it has been reported that PmHAS (Class II HAS) added sugars to the non-reducing terminus of the growing chain at the saturated GlcUA of a tetramer of HA as an acceptor (17.DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26557-26562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the exact mechanism of the synthesis and polymerization of HA molecules by Class I HASs has not yet been systematically elucidated. Streptococcus pyogenes HAS has been reported to add sugars to the non-reducing terminus of the growing chain as determined by selective labeling and degradation studies (18.Stoolmiller A.C. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 236-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using a similar approach, however, two laboratories working with the enzyme preparations from mammalian cells concluded that the new sugars were added to the reducing end of the nascent chain (19.Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20.Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 21.Asplund T. Brinck J. Suzuki M. Briskin M.J. Heldin P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1380: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our interest has been directed toward these different polymerization manners by Class I HASs. Despite their similarity in the homology of the HAS polypeptides between vertebrates and streptococcus, why do they actually utilize different reaction pathways? Recently it was demonstrated that some of eukaryotic glycosyltransferases such as β-1,4 galactosyltransferase, α-2,3 sialyltransferase, α-2,6 sialyltransferase, and α-1,6 fucosyltransferase could be expressed as active and soluble forms in Escherichia coli (22.Uejima T. Uemura M. Nozawa S. Narimatsu H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6158-6163PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Grundmann U. Nerlich C. Rein T. Zettlmeissl G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 667Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 24.Yanagidani S. Uozumi N. Ihara Y. Miyoshi E. Yamaguchi N. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, the number of recombinant glycosyltransferases produced in E. coli is still limited. It is likely that the recombinant human HASs (rhHASs) expressed in E. coli might lose a chance to bind a nascent HA chain because E. coli host cells do not produce UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc required for the synthesis of HA polysaccharide. However, it is anticipated that the exogenous HA-derived oligosaccharides as acceptor substrates can access the active site of rhHAS and be utilized for sugar elongation reactions in the presence of exogenous glycosyl donor substrates. It has also been reported that PmHAS added new sugar residues to the saturated tetramer prepared by means of ovine testis hyaluronidase at the non-reducing end (17.DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26557-26562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Moreover the recent work of DeAngelis et al. (25.DeAngelis P.L. Oatman L.C. Gay D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35199-35203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) clearly demonstrated that the engineered PmHAS could be converted into two single action glycosyltransferases, and reactor enzymes immobilized onto solid supports were utilized in an alternating fashion to make pure HA molecules of a single length in a controlled and stepwise manner. In vertebrates HASs, it is known that HAS of Xenopus DG42 expressed in yeast exhibited a significant activity as HA synthase (26.DeAngelis P.L. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23657-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this report, we communicate the production in E. coli and characterization of some modified recombinant human HAS2s (rhHAS2s) containing the sequences corresponding to a common catalytic region found in human HAS2. It is demonstrated that rhHAS2s produced in this study show potent activity to synthesize HA polymers in vitro by using exogenous tetrasaccharide as an acceptor substrate, and sugar elongation was performed at the non-reducing end of the saturated GlcUA residue. Materials and Strains—The starting vector for the expression of PCR-mediated fusion proteins, pMALp2x, was purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. Reagents for the molecular biology were obtained from Toyobo Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan) and Takara Co., Ltd. (Shiga, Japan) unless noted. Custom oligonucleotides were purchased from Hokkaido System Science Co. (Hokkaido, Japan). UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc were purchased from Sigma. Radiolabeled sugar nucleotides UDP-[14C]GlcUA and UDP-[3H]GlcNAc were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO) and PerkinElmer Life Sciences, respectively. Even-numbered HA oligosaccharide standards ((GlcUA-GlcNAc)n, n = 2 or 3) were gifts from Denki Kagaku Kogyo K. K. (Tokyo, Japan). All other reagents were the highest grade available from either Sigma or Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan) unless otherwise noted. Plasmid Construction—Human HAS2 gene was obtained from the human small intestine cDNA plasmid pAP3neo. The coding open reading frame region of 552 residues was amplified by 25 cycles of the polymerase chain reaction with Taq DNA polymerase and oligonucleotide primers designed to add flanking BamHI and HindIII restriction sites. The cassette was subcloned into pMALp2x expression vector in E. coli and constructed on phHAS2ORF. Subsequently, as shown in Fig. 1, to create the PCR-mediated rhHAS2 fused with maltose-binding protein, three kinds of encoding genes composed of only cytoplasmic region were generated by PCR as template on phHAS2ORF. These plasmids corresponded to amino acids 122–414, 122–355, and 122–347, respectively. The following primers were used: 122–414: forward primer, 5′-CGGGATCCGGGAACTCAGAAGATGAC-3′ (this primer contains BamHI site), and reverse primer, 5′-CCCAAGCTTCTGGACAGTTAAC-3′ (this primer contains HindIII site); 122–355: reverse primer, 5′-CCCAAGCTTGCTCCAACGGGTCTGC-3′ (this primer contains HindIII site); and 122–347: reverse primer, 5′-CCCAAGCTTCCATCTGAGATACTCTATAGG-3′ (this primer contains HindIII site). The PCR products prepared as template on phHAS2ORF were purified by using the MinElute™ gel extraction kit (Qiagen, GmbH) after digestion with BamHI and HindIII. The products were ligated overnight with T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen). E. coli strain JM109 was transformed with the newly constructed plasmid, and colonies were maintained on LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. Sequences of the resultant constructs were determined using an Applied Biosystems 310 automated DNA sequencer. Preparation of Membrane Fraction—Membranes from E. coli were obtained by modifications of a protoplast method as reported previously (27.Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Kempner E.S. Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26100-26109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28.DeAngelis P.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9768-9771Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The fusion plasmids for the rhHAS2 fusion constructs were grown in JM109 cells. Cells containing the HAS-encoding MBP fusion plasmids were grown at 37 °C overnight in Luria broth containing 0.2% glucose. The overnight culture was diluted 1:100 to start a new culture in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 0.2% glucose; cells were grown with vigorous shaking to midlog phase (0.4–0.6 A600). The cells were then induced with 100 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside and grown for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The cell pellet was thawed and resuspended in 2.7% of the original culture volume with 20% sucrose, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 including 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.3 mg/ml lysozyme in 0.1 m EDTA, pH 8. The suspension was incubated for 30 min on ice and centrifuged to fractionate the periplasm (10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C). The cells were resuspended by pipetting in a similar buffer containing 46 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 50 mm MgCl2 followed by sonication (Bioruptor sonifier from Cosmo Bio Co. Ltd.). The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C). The supernatant fraction was diluted 20-fold in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the membrane fraction was harvested by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 1 h). The prepared membrane fraction containing active enzyme was suspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4 at a concentration of 1–3 mg/ml protein. Although the pMalp2x vector usually targets the recombinant protein to the periplasm fraction, the present rhHAS2 fusions were obtained as a membrane fraction. These active fractions were found to dissolve in supernatant after centrifugation for 20,000 × g for 5 min (3.Itano N. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9875-9878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 28.DeAngelis P.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9768-9771Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Quantification of protein in the crude membrane preparations was carried out using the BCA™ protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Determination of Expressed Fusion Proteins—Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE (4–20% gel) were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane at 100 V for 2 h in a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Cell blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) and blocked with Block Ace (Dainipponseiyaku Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) for 30 min. Membranes were then exposed to an anti-MBP monoclonal antibody (New England Biolabs, Inc.) in buffer containing 10% Block Ace in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 for 1 h followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). Immune complexes were detected using a Konica immunostaining kit (Konica Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Acceptor Oligosaccharides—Even-numbered HA oligosaccharides ((GlcNAc-GlcUA)n) were generated by degradation of macromolecular HA (from pig skin) with either ovine testicular hyaluronidase or Streptococcus dysgalactiae hyaluronidase (n = 2 or 3) in 20 mm sodium acetate, 0.15 m sodium chloride, pH 5.7, at 30 °C overnight. The preparation of hydrolysate of HA by treating with ovine testicular hyaluronidase involved a saturated GlcUA residue at the non-reducing end of tetramer (HA4) and/or hexamer HA (HA6). Ovine testicular hyaluronidase produces oligosaccharides with an elimination mechanism to cleave the polysaccharide chain, resulting in an unsaturated GlcUA residue at the non-reducing terminus of each fragment (17.DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26557-26562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For further purification and desalting, some crude preparations were subjected to gel filtration with Bio-Gel P-4 (Bio-Rad) eluted with 0.2 m ammonium formate, and the pure fractions were lyophilized. Uronic acid was quantitated by the carbazole method (29.Taylor K.A. Buchanan-Smith J.G. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and the masses of the HA oligosaccharides were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) on a Bruker BIFLEX™. Measurement of HAS Activity of Recombinant Human HAS2 Fusion Peptides—Samples were assayed for HAS activity in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl solution (pH 7.4) containing 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 15% glycerol, 0.5 mm UDP-GlcNAc, and 0.5 mm UDP-GlcUA. General conditions for the HA synthesis were as follows. To initiate the enzymatic reaction, 500 μg of membrane protein and a series of 100 μg of d-GlcUA or oligosaccharide acceptors were added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by boiling the mixtures for 10 min. HA products were fractionated by gel filtration chromatography using Superdex peptide HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) eluted with 0.2 m ammonium acetate. Sugar-containing fractions were lyophilized, and the molecular masses were measured with MALDI-TOF MS. MALDI-TOF MS Analysis—Determination of the molecular weight of the HA products was performed by positive ion mode MALDI-TOF MS analysis on a REFLEX™ III and BIFLEX™ (Bruker, Bremen, Germany). The samples were dissolved in distilled water and subsequently mixed well at a ratio of 1:1 with a matrix solution of N-2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid solution in 80% methanol (w/v). Linear mass scans were recorded over 400 Da by using a pulse delay time of 20,000 ns. Production of rhHAS2 Fusion Proteins in E. coli—It has been reported that the major catalytic regions of eukaryotic HAS seem to exist in the cytoplasmic region by topology research and Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis (5.Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22945-22948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 15.Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 30.Heldermon C. DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2037-2046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), although the essential structure of the catalytic domain is still putative and has not been identified previously. In this study, we designed three constructions: (i) a peptide composed of the two common catalytic domains of HAS in the cytoplasmic region and the sequence including a part of the transmembrane region (rhHAS2-(122–414)), (ii) a peptide containing only two catalytic sites (rhHAS2-(122–355)), and (iii) a small peptide lacking one of the catalytic sites (rhHAS2-(122–347)) as illustrated in Fig. 1. These constructs were expressed as induction proteins with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside in E. coli. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” each DNA fragment was amplified from a human small intestine cDNA library by PCR. Then PCR products were placed into pMALp2x vectors encoding MBP (42.9 kDa) and transformed into JM109 cells. The sequences of the fusion junctions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Constructs were checked for expression of fusion protein by Western blot analysis, and the molecular weights of the subunits for all constructs were found to be consistent with MBP fusion proteins (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the open reading frame region of the rhHAS2 protein was not expressed in E. coli (data not shown) probably because of the complicated topology and high hydrophobicity of vertebrate HASs. HA Synthesis by rhHAS2 Produced in E. coli—To investigate whether vertebrate HAS genes on plasmids inserted into foreign hosts have the ability to produce HA polymer in vitro, rhHAS2 fusion protein (rhHAS2-(122–414)) produced in E. coli was preliminarily subjected to the reaction with two radiolabeled sugar nucleotides, UDP-[14C]GlcUA and UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, as donors in the presence of the GlcUA as a monosaccharide acceptor substrate. As shown in the chromatographic analyses of the products (Fig. 3, A and B), rhHAS2-(122–414) apparently incorporated both [14C]GlcUA and [3H]GlcNAc to produce some new compounds showing higher molecular weight than [14C]GlcUA or [3H]GlcNAc. It was also suggested that the HA product could be digested by treating with S. dysgalactiae hyaluronidase to give a mixture of low molecular weight fragments. In addition, Fig. 3D shows a MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of the HA fractions produced using normal (non-radiolabeled) sugar nucleotides as donors instead of radiolabeled substrates with GlcUA acceptor. Although the significant peak due to 5-mer (HA5) at 1016.28 was detected, it seems that the polypeptide did not exhibit satisfactory HAS activity to produce longer HA polymers from the monosaccharide acceptor. It was also suggested that GlcNAc cannot be used as a glycosyl acceptor for this enzyme (data not shown). Since it has been known that a tetrasaccharide derivative (HA4) could become exogenous and a potential acceptor substrate for PmHAS (17.DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26557-26562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), our attention was next directed toward the reaction of rhHAS2 with this tetrasaccharide substrate as an acceptor. Interestingly it was shown that rhHAS2-(122–414) seemed to produce much longer HA oligosaccharides than HA5, and the existence of the HA8, HA10, and HA14 could be detected by MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of the crude product as indicated in Fig. 4A. Further purification of the mixture by using Superdex peptide HR 10/30 and MS analyses of each fraction revealed that the mixture contained HA8, HA10, HA12, HA14, and HA16. Since we have preliminarily found the reproducible accumulation of HA14 in the above experiments using rhHAS2-(122–414), HA synthetic activity of the three polypeptides rhHAS2-(122–414), rhHAS2-(122–355), and rhHAS2-(122–347) were discussed by comparing the production of HA14 as indicated in Fig. 5B. It was suggested that rhHAS2-(122–414) and rhHAS2-(122–355) peptides showed potent HAS activity and the advent of a major peak at 2850.17. On the other hand, rhHAS2-(122–347) exhibited activity that was lower than that of the two other peptides (Fig. 5C), suggesting that a part of the deletion of the catalytic region of HAS2 drastically reduced its HAS activity. In addition, HA14 synthesized by rhHAS2-(122–414) was sensitive to the treatment by S. dysgalactiae hyaluronidase, the intensity of the MALDI-TOF MS peak corresponding to the HA14 apparently disappeared, and a new peak due to disaccharide product was observed (Fig. 5D).Fig. 5Hyaluronan produced by the reaction of rhHAS2 peptides with UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcUA as donor substrates in the presence of a tetramer of HA as an acceptor substrate. Membrane fractions of rhHAS2 peptides were incubated in the reaction mixture containing UDP-GlcUA (0.5 mm), UDP-GlcNAc (0.5 mm), and tetramer HA (100 μg) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The positive ion MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the products were measured.

Furthermore it was also suggested that rhHAS2-(122–414) may be utilized for the synthesis of various lengths of HA polymers from HA8 to HA16 as indicated in Fig. 4. rhHAS2-(122–414) could not synthesize longer (high molecular weight) HA chains even by using longer incubations (over 24 h) or reactions with higher UDP-sugar concentrations (data not shown). Incubation of the tetrasaccharide acceptor with a single donor, UDP-GlcNAc, did not yield HA5, suggesting that the recombinant truncated HAS2 polypeptides cannot be utilized for the stepwise synthesis of HA performed by using the engineered PmHAS method reported by DeAngelis et al. (25.DeAngelis P.L. Oatman L.C. Gay D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35199-35203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For the purpose of the regulation of the molecular size of the HA, some improvement or optimization of the reaction conditions will be required. Oligosaccharide Acceptors for rhHAS2 Peptides—To investigate the suitability of exogenous oligosaccharide substrates and the mechanism of HA synthesis by rhHAS2-(122–414), sugar elongation reactions using some oligosaccharide materials as acceptor substrates were examined. As shown in Fig. 6, a tetrasaccharide carrying a saturated GlcUA residue at the non-reducing end was found to become a suitable and desirable acceptor substrate for rhHAS2-(122–414) among the materials used in this study. Interestingly a tetrasaccharide bearing an unsaturated GlcUA residue at the non-reducing end derived by the action of S. dysgalactiae hyaluronidase could not be used as a substrate for this reaction at all (Fig. 6D). This result clearly suggests that HA polymerization catalyzed by rhHAS2 was initiated at the non-reducing GlcUA residue of this tetrasaccharide. Neither hexamer prepared by treating HA with ovine testis hyaluronidase nor the structurally similar disaccharide chondrosine became an even tentative substrate (Fig. 6, B and C). Likewise the rhHAS2 did not use free GlcNAc as a glycosyl acceptor substrate (data not shown). GlcUA and GlcNAc monosaccharides are not acceptors for synthesis of HA14 even though GlcUA will serve as an acceptor for synthesis of HA5. In this study, we found some new pieces of invaluable information on the expression of recombinant human HAS peptides and their ability to synthesize HA molecules. First it was found that the rhHAS2 peptides composed of only the partial catalytic domain located in cytoplasmic region were successfully produced in E. coli, and the peptides showed a potent ability to synthesize HAs in vitro. The amino acid sequences in the catalytic region of a variety of vertebrate HASs have been known to show high homology with the region of 272–461 in human HAS2. Therefore, the recombinant human HAS2s prepared in this study, rhHAS2-(122–414) and rhHAS2-(122–355), were involved in the high homology region in the catalytic domain. At present, we can conclude that rhHAS2-(122–414) and rhHAS2-(122–355) containing partial structures of the cytoplasmic catalytic domain of human HAS2 synthesize relatively low molecular weight HA (from 8-mer to 16-mer) as elucidated mainly by MALDI-TOF MS. Moreover peptide domains found in the membrane-associated regions are not necessary, at least, for this simple synthetic process observed in the action by rhHAS2-(122–414) and rhHAS2-(122–355). However, it seems that reproducible accumulation of the 14-mer (HA14) as a major product in this procedure means the lack of the capacity to synthesize further high molecular weight HA. Although the reason for the accumulation of HA14 is not clear, it would be affected by some intrinsic factors because this tendency could not be controlled by limiting time, substrate, or enzyme concerns. Therefore, it should be noted that membrane-associated peptide domains deleted in this study might have a crucial function to accelerate the highly efficient and high speed polymerization reaction of HA as well as transportation of high molecular weight HA from inside to outside of the cells. As for the mechanism of HA synthesis by rhHAS2 peptides, it was clearly demonstrated that these rhHAS2s elongated sugar residues from the non-reducing end of the exogenous acceptor molecule, a saturated form of the tetrasaccharide derivative. However, it was previously demonstrated that of the Class I HASs neither recombinant S. pyogenes HAS nor recombinant Xenopus DG42 used the saturated tetrasaccharide (HA4) as exogenous acceptor (17.DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26557-26562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, it could be speculated that the access of the tetrasaccharide to a catalytic site/cleft was blocked by the flanking membrane-associated regions. The tetrasaccharide derivative having unsaturated GlcUA at the non-reducing end did not become a good substrate for rhHAS2 at all. These results are not contradictory with the fact that S. pyogenes HAS, carrying a large cytoplasmic domain homologously similar to that of human HAS2 (30.Heldermon C. DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2037-2046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), also elongates sugars at the non-reducing end (18.Stoolmiller A.C. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 236-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was also revealed that the hexasaccharide derivative could not be used for the synthesis of larger HA molecules. This may be caused by the limit of the spatial size of the carbohydrate-binding cavity or pocket of the rhHAS2 peptides. Although the essentials in the mechanism of HA synthesis by native human HASs expressed in mammalian cells have not been discussed thoroughly (19.Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20.Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 21.Asplund T. Brinck J. Suzuki M. Briskin M.J.

In conclusion, we have successfully expressed and produced modified rhHAS2 as the active form in E. coli. It was demonstrated that rhHAS2 polymerizes HA using an exogenous tetrasaccharide as acceptor substrate and elongates sugars from the non-reducing end of the saturated GlcUA residue in vitro.

In contrast to parental L cells, mutant LX cells harbor defects that interfere with the maturation and activity of cathepsin B and cathepsin L but not cathepsin H. The cDNAs encoding cathepsin B and cathepsin L in L cells are identical to those in LX cells, indicating that LX cells manifest an extrinsic block to the function of these enzymes.

Moreover, this regulation influences host cell susceptibility to intracellular pathogens. The protease cascades required for complement activation, hemostasis, programmed cell death, and replication of some viruses illustrate that protease activity must be tightly regulated. Mechanisms of regulation include synthesis as zymogens, blockade by specific inhibitors, kinetic instability, and sequestration in localized environments. Endocytic proteases play important roles in propagating signals from the cell surface, hydrolysis of phagocytosed substrates, and generation of antigen-specific immune responses (1Barrett A.J.

Virol. 1999; 73: 9532-9543Google Scholar). During the first 4 days in culture, the persistently infected cell line underwent an intense period of crisis in which most of the cells in the culture were lysed. Over the next 2-3 weeks, small colonies of cells became apparent, and these colonies eventually reached sufficient density to permit passage. After stabilization, the cell line produced titers of infectious virus between 106 and 108 plaque forming units/ml throughout its maintenance. By passage in medium containing a reovirus-specific antiserum, the cultures were cured of viral infection as documented by plaque assay, infectious center assay, viral antigen staining, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for viral RNA (5Dermody T.S.

Virol. 1999; 73: 9532-9543Google Scholar). L cells support growth of reovirus after infection by intact virions or ISVPs, generated by protease treatment of virions in vitro. In contrast, LX cells do not support growth of reovirus after infection by virions but do so after infection by ISVPs (5Dermody T.S. Nibert M.L. Wetzel J.D. Tong X. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2055-2063Google Scholar, 8Baer G.S. Ebert D.H. Chung C.J. Erickson A.H. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9532-9543Google Scholar). This observation suggests that mutant cells do not support entry steps leading to formation of ISVPs. Virions and ISVPs have identical requirements for binding to reovirus receptors (26Nibert M.L. Chappell J.D. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5057-5067Google Scholar); however, ISVPs do not require acid-dependent proteolysis to penetrate into the cytoplasm (5Dermody T.S. Nibert M.L. Wetzel J.D. Tong X. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2055-2063Google Scholar, 7Baer G.S. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4921-4928Google Scholar, 15Sturzenbecker L.J. Nibert M.L. Furlong D.B.

Ebert D.H. Chung C.J. Erickson A.H. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9532-9543Google Scholar). Intravesicular pH is equivalent in both cell types, and virions colocalize with an acid-sensitive fluorophore in both L cells and LX cells (8Baer G.S. Ebert D.H. Chung C.J. Erickson A.H. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9532-9543Google Scholar). However, LX cells do not support the proteolytic disassembly of the viral outer capsid following internalization into the endocytic pathway (8Baer G.S. Ebert D.H. Chung C.J. Erickson A.H. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9532-9543Google Scholar). Ultrastructurally, LX cells accumulate electron-dense, membrane-bound vesicles that resemble large lysosomes (8Baer G.S. Ebert D.H. Chung C.J. Erickson A.H. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9532-9543Google Scholar). Preliminary characterization of mutant LX cells indicates that these cells manifest a defect in the expression of endocytic protease cathepsin L (8Baer G.S. Ebert D.H. Chung C.J. Erickson A.H. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9532-9543Google Scholar). By immunoblot analysis, LX cells express procathepsin L. However, unlike parental L cells, LX cells lack the mature, enzymatically active forms of this enzyme (8Baer G.S. Ebert D.H. Chung C.J. Erickson A.H. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9532-9543Google Scholar). Neither overexpression of cathepsin L nor treatment with cysteine protease inhibitor E64, which leads to an accumulation of the single-chain and double-chain forms of cathepsin L in wild-type (wt) cells (27Salminen A. Gottesman M.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 39-44Google Scholar), can rescue the defect in cathepsin L maturation in LX cells (8Baer G.S. Ebert D.H. Chung C.J. Erickson A.H. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9532-9543Google Scholar). Cathepsin L cDNA recovered from LX cells contains no mutations, indicating that the mutation in LX cells responsible for alterations in cathepsin L expression is extrinsic to the enzyme (8Baer G.S. Ebert D.H. Chung C.J. Erickson A.H. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9532-9543Google Scholar). The cysteine endocytic proteases include cathepsins B, C, F, H, L, O, and X, which are expressed ubiquitously, and cathepsins K, S, and V, which are expressed in a restricted subset of tissues (28Turk V. Turk B. Turk D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4629-4633Google Scholar). Cathepsins B, H, and L are the most abundant endocytic cysteine proteases in fibroblasts (29Kirschke H. Langner J. Wiederanders B. Ansorge S. Bohley P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 74: 293-301Google Scholar, 30Gottesman M.M. Sobel M.E. Cell. 1980; 19: 449-455Google Scholar, 31Barrett A.J. Kirschke H.

Commun. 1986; 139: 156-162Google Scholar). These proteases are first synthesized as preproenzymes with the signal peptide directing entry into the endoplasmic reticulum where the signal peptide is removed and the enzymes are glycosylated. Mannose 6-phosphate receptors in the Golgi bind the glycosylated proenzymes, leading to their transport to the endocytic pathway. As prelysosomal compartments acidify, the proenzymes are released from mannose 6-phosphate receptors (34Mort J.S. Buttle D.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 715-720Google Scholar, 35Kornfeld S. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 462-468Google Scholar) and proteolytically cleaved to single-chain forms, liberating the propeptides. Both autocatalytic and intermolecular cleavage have been proposed for cathepsin B (36Rowan A.D. Mason P. Mach L. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15993-15999Google Scholar). For cathepsin L, it has been suggested that initial cleavage of the propeptide is not autocatalytic (27Salminen A. Gottesman M.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 39-44Google Scholar). For both cathepsin B and cathepsin L, subsequent cleavage of the single-chain form results in heavy and light chains. The heavy and light chains are linked by a disulfide bond, forming the double-chain form of the enzyme. Both the single-chain and double-chain forms of cathepsin B and cathepsin L are enzymatically active, whereas the proenzyme forms of these enzymes are not (34Mort J.S. Buttle D.J. Int. J. Biochem.

To better understand the function and regulation of endocytic proteases, cysteine endocytic proteases in LX cells were characterized. Expression of cathepsin B, H, and L was assessed by immunoblot analysis, and activity was tested using fluorogenic substrates and substrate analogs. Based on these studies, we focused on determining how mature forms of cathepsin B could be present yet lack activity. The findings provide new insights into mechanisms underlying the regulation of endocytic proteases and illuminate the molecular basis of virus-cell coevolution during persistent reovirus infection.

Immunoblot Analysis of Cathepsin B, L, and H—L cells and LX cells were collected by scraping and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were lysed with detergent (PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 5 min. Insoluble material was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. Supernatants were mixed 1:1 with 2× sample buffer (125 mm Tris, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. Alternatively, monolayers of cells were washed with PBS and incubated in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 6 h. The medium was collected and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to remove remaining cells. Proteins in the medium were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid containing salmon sperm DNA (25 μg/ml), centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and resuspended in 1× sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue). Protein samples, normalized for cell number, were loaded into lanes of 12% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed at 200 constant voltage for 50 min. Following equilibration of the gel in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol) for 20 min, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 100 V for 1 h. After removal from the transfer apparatus, membranes were air-dried for 5 min and treated for 1 h with agitation in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% low-fat dry milk. Membranes were incubated with rabbit antisera raised against human cathepsin B (Athens Research and Technology, Athens, GA) diluted 1:500 in TBS plus Tween 20 and milk at 37 °C for 2 h, murine cathepsin L (42Portnoy D.A. Erickson A.H. Kochan J. Ravetch J.V. Unkeless J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 26: 14697-14703Google Scholar) diluted 1:10,000 at room temperature for 1 h, or human cathepsin H (Athens Research and Technology) diluted 1:1,000 at room temperature for 1 h. After three washes with TBS plus Tween 20, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:2500 in TBS plus Tween 20 and milk. Membranes were washed three times in TBS plus Tween 20, incubated with enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 min, and exposed to Bio-Max MR film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Cysteine Protease Active-site Labeling—Cysteine protease labeling reagent benzyloxycarbonyl (Z)-Tyr-Ala-CHN2 (Peptides International, Louisville, KY) was dissolved in 25% ethanol to generate a 1 mm stock that was aliquoted and frozen at -20 °C. The cathepsin B-specific inhibitor CA-074Me (Peptides International) and the cathepsin L-specific inhibitor Z-Phe-Tyr(t-Bu)diazomethylketone (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) were dissolved in Me2SO to generate 10 mm stocks that were aliquoted and frozen at -20 °C. The cysteine protease labeling reagent was iodinated by incubating 25 μl of 1 mm Z-Tyr-Ala-CHN2, 10 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 1 mCi (10 μl) of Na125I in NaOH (Amersham Biosciences) in an IODO-GEN tube (Pierce) at room temperature for 10 min with mixing every 30 s. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 455 μl of 50 μm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and removal from the IODO-GEN tube (43Mason R.W. Wilcox D. Wikstrom P. Shaw E.N. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 125-129Google Scholar). The 50 μm Z-[125I-Tyr]Ala-CN2 solution was aliquoted and frozen at -70 °C. Cell suspensions (1 × 106 cells in 1 ml of cell culture medium) were incubated with 0.5 μm Z-[125I-Tyr]Ala-CN2 at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in 50 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 1% Triton X-100) (43Mason R.W. Wilcox D. Wikstrom P. Shaw E.N. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 125-129Google Scholar). Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g, and 30 μl of supernatant was mixed with 6 μl of 6× sample buffer (0.35 m Tris, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.6 m DTT, and 0.012% bromphenol blue), boiled, and loaded into lanes of 12% polyacrylamide gels. Alternatively, cell suspensions were preincubated with 0-10 μm CA-074Me or with 0 to 10 μm Z-Phe-Tyr(t-Bu)diazomethylketone at 37 °C for 1 h prior to addition of 10 μl of 50 μm Z-[125I-Tyr]Ala-CN2, for a final concentration of 0.5 μm, to the cell suspension. For cell lysate experiments, cells were first lysed with detergent (100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 4 mm DTT) and then incubated with 0.5 μm Z-[125I-Tyr]Ala-CN2 at 30 °C for 30 min (43Mason R.W. Wilcox D. Wikstrom P. Shaw E.N. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 125-129Google Scholar). For experiments using mixed lysates, L cell and LX cell lysates were mixed and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min before adding 0.5 μm Z-[125ITyr]Ala-CN2. Samples were mixed 5:1 with 6× sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE using 12% polyacrylamide gels. Dried gels were exposed to film for autoradiography. For the mixed lysate experiments, dried gels were exposed to an imaging plate, and band intensity was quantitated by determining photostimulus luminescence units using a Fuji2000 Phosphorimager (Fuji Medical Systems, Inc., Stamford, CT). Densities of bands corresponding to cathepsin B and cathepsin L were quantitated, and background density, calculated from an identically sized box positioned directly below the bands, was subtracted. Band densities were divided by the density for either cathepsin B or cathepsin L in the 1 L cell equivalent lane to give a ratio. An average ratio and standard deviation were calculated for two independent experiments. Measurement of Cathepsin B Activity—Cathepsin B substrate Z-Arg-Arg-MCA (Peptides International) was dissolved in Me2SO to generate a 10 mm stock that was aliquoted and frozen at -20 °C. L cells and LX cells grown in monolayer culture were collected by scraping and washed three times with PBS. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100), and insoluble material was sedimented in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. One cell equivalent corresponded to 2.5 × 105 cells in 1 μl. Lysates were mixed with lysis buffer in a total volume of 20 μl in a black 96-well plate (Costar, Corning Inc., Corning, NY). Eighty μl of reaction buffer (100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm DTT) and 100 μl of substrate solution (100 μm Z-Arg-Arg-MCA diluted in 0.1% Brij 35 (Sigma)) were added to each well and mixed by pipetting (31Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 800: 535-561Google Scholar). For control reactions done in the presence of CA-074, the reaction buffer was supplemented with 1 μm CA-074 prior to mixture with 1 L cell equivalent, leading to a concentration of 0.5 μm CA-074 in the final reaction. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, fluorescence was measured using a FLUOstar 403 fluorometer (BMG LabTechnologies, Durham, NC) with excitation of 390 nm and emission of 460 nm. Measurement of Cathepsin H Activity—L cells and LX cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100). Insoluble material was sedimented in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Lysates were incubated with 100 μm E64, 1 μm CA-074, 3.3 μm Z-Phe-Tyr(t-Bu)-diazomethylketone, or dH2O on ice for 2 h. For each reaction, 3 μl of lysate was added to 97 μl of reaction buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm DTT, 1 mm puromycin) and 100 μl of substrate solution (100 μm Arg-MCA diluted in 0.1% BRIJ 35) (31Barrett A.J.

After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, fluorescence was measured using a FLUOstar 403 fluorometer with excitation of 390 nm and emission of 460 nm. Cloning and Sequencing of Procathepsin B-encoding cDNA—Cellular mRNA was purified from cell lysates using oligo(dT) magneto-beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). Oligodeoxynucleotide primers 5′-GCTCGGTGAGTGCAGGATCCAGC and 5′-GGACTGGACAATGAAGTCAAAGC, which correspond to the 5′ and 3′ non-translated regions of the preprocathepsin B cDNA, were used to generate PCR products from isolated mRNA. Purified mRNA was melted in 90% Me2SO at 95 °C for 5 min. Ice-cold primers were annealed to the melted template, and cDNA was generated using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Sciences). PCR was performed using Taq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 39 cycles, using a program of template denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, primer annealing at 50 °C for 2 min, and polynucleotide synthesis at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR was completed by a synthesis step at 72 °C for 1 h. Resultant cDNAs were cloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen). Unambiguous sequences of preprocathepsin B cDNA, including the entire open reading frame, were determined by dideoxy chain termination at the DNA Sequencing Shared Resource at Vanderbilt. Sequences of two cDNA clones generated from independent reverse transcriptase-PCR were determined. Construction of a Plasmid Encoding a Cathepsin B-GFP Fusion Protein—To generate a 3′ SalI site in place of the stop codon, oligonucleotide primers 5′-GCTCGGTGAGTGCAGGATCCAGC and 5′-AATTGTCGACGAATCTTCCCCAGTACTG, corresponding to the 5′ non-translated region and the modified 3′ translated region of procathepsin B, were mixed in a PCR with the template preprocathepsin B cDNA cloned in pCRII. The PCR product was cloned into pEGFP N3 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using the restriction enzymes EcoRI and SalI. This plasmid encodes preprocathepsin B-green fluorescent protein (GFP) with preprocathepsin B on the N-terminal end of the fusion protein. Immunoprecipitation of Cathepsin B-GFP—L cells (4 × 106) and LX cells (3 × 106) were plated on 100-mm plates. On the following day, the cells were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid encoding either cathepsin B-GFP or GFP alone using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, cells were collected by scraping and washed three times with PBS. GFP fluorescence was measured using a FLUOstar 403 fluorometer with excitation of 485 nm and emission of 510 nm. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6, 0.5% Triton X-100), normalizing for GFP expression. Insoluble material was collected by centrifugation, and the supernatant fraction was precleared by incubation at 4 °C for 15 min with protein A-Sepharose (20 μl) that had been prewashed with lysis buffer. GFP-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) B-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was pre-bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (20 μl) by rotation at 4 °C for at least 1 h. The precleared lysate was added to the antibody-conjugated beads and rotated at 4 °C for 4 h. The immunoprecipitate was washed five times with lysis buffer, pelleting by centrifugation at 500 × g between washes. The immunoprecipitate was resuspended in 250 μl of reaction buffer (100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm DTT) and 250 μl of substrate solution (100 μm Z-Phe-Arg-MCA diluted in 0.1% BRIJ 35). Samples were protected from light and rotated at 37 °C for 2 h. Samples were divided into two equal aliquots and added to wells of a black 96-well plate. Fluorescence was measured using a FLUOstar 403 fluorometer with excitation of 390 nm and emission of 460 nm. The readings in the two wells were averaged for each sample. Experiments were performed in triplicate. For immunoblot analysis of cathepsin B-GFP immunoprecipitates, cells were either transfected with cathepsin B-GFP or mock transfected, lysed, and incubated with GFP-spec"
https://openalex.org/W2008254299,"Elongation factor Ts (EF-Ts) is the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), which promotes the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-programmed ribosome in prokaryotes. The EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex, one of the EF-Tu complexes during protein synthesis, is also a component of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases like the polymerase from coliphage Qβ. The present study shows that the <i>Escherichia coli</i> mutant GRd.tsf lacking the coiled-coil motif of EF-Ts is completely resistant to phage Qβ and that Qβ-polymerase complex formation is not observed. GRd.tsf is the first <i>E. coli</i> mutant ever described that is unable to form a Qβ-polymerase complex while still maintaining an almost normal growth behavior. The phage resistance correlates with an observed instability of the mutant EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex in the presence of guanine nucleotides. Thus, the mutant EF-Tu·EF-Ts is the first EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex ever described that is completely inactive in the Qβ-polymerase complex despite its almost full activity in protein synthesis. We propose that the role of EF-Ts in the Qβ-polymerase complex is to control and trap EF-Tu in a stable conformation with affinity for RNA templates while unable to bind aminoacyl-tRNA."

We have identified an additional Pthlh variant, consisting of Thr and three amino-acid changes in the C-terminus (Pthlh(SerAspTyr)), carried by an evolutionarily distant Mus spretus (SPRET/Ei) inbred strain. When transfected into NCI-H520 tumor cells, this Pthlh(SerAspTyr) variant did not stimulate tumor growth in nude mice. Analysis of cell adhesion, migration, and invasion patterns of Pthlh(Pro)-, Pthlh(Thr)-, and Pthlh(SerAspTyr)-transfected NCI-H520 cells revealed a 1.5-fold decrease in adhesion efficiency on both collagen type I and Matrigel, and a 5-6-fold increase in migration capability in Pthlh(Pro) transfectants as compared to nontransfected, vector-transfected, Pthlh(Thr)-, or Pthlh(SerAspTyr)-transfected cells. These findings suggest that the cancer modifier effects of the mouse Pthlh gene are mediated by differential cell adhesion and migration effects of PTHrP variants."
https://openalex.org/W2088827491,"Transposition of mobile genetic elements proceeds through a series of DNA phosphoryl transfer reactions, with multiple reaction steps catalyzed by the same set of active site residues. Mu transposase repeatedly utilizes the same active site DDE residues to cleave and join a single DNA strand at each transposon end to a new, distant DNA location (the target DNA). To better understand how DNA is manipulated within the Mu transposase-DNA complex during recombination, the impact of the DNA immediately adjacent to the Mu DNA ends (the flanking DNA) on the progress of transposition was investigated. We show that, in the absence of the MuB activator, the 3 ′-flanking strand can slow one or more steps between DNA cleavage and joining. The presence of this flanking DNA strand in just one active site slows the joining step in both active sites. Further evidence suggests that this slow step is not due to a change in the affinity of the transpososome for the target DNA. Finally, we demonstrate that MuB activates transposition by stimulating the reaction step between cleavage and joining that is otherwise slowed by this flanking DNA strand. Based on these results, we propose that the 3 ′-flanking DNA strand must be removed from, or shifted within, both active sites after the cleavage step; this movement is coupled to a conformational change within the transpososome that properly positions the target DNA simultaneously within both active sites and thereby permits joining.

The successful relocation of mobile genetic elements, as with all DNA rearrangement processes, requires the precise spatial and temporal organization of DNA components within the active sites of large nucleoprotein complexes. This dynamic organization permits the proper series of DNA cleavage and joining reactions that comprise each DNA recombination pathway. Transposition and retroviral integration occur via one of two pathways that share common reaction steps (1Mizuuchi K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1011-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 2Kleckner N. Chalmers R.M. Kwon D. Sakai J. Bolland S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 204: 49-82PubMed Google Scholar). Similar phosphoryl transfer reactions also take place during the early steps of VDJ recombination (3Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Many transposases and integrases form a recombinase family related both by the three-dimensional structure of their catalytic domains and by a conserved set of acidic active site residues (4Rice P.A. Baker T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 302-307Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Bacteriophage Mu transposase is a well studied member of this family. Transposases and integrases promote recombination via either a replicative or cut-and-paste transposition pathway. These pathways share two common steps (see Fig. 1). First, one strand at each element end is hydrolyzed to yield a 3′OH at the terminus of the element sequence. This donor cleavage step separates this strand at each element end from the surrounding (or flanking) DNA. In the second common step, called DNA strand transfer or joining, each liberated 3′OH directly attacks closely spaced phosphodiester bonds in opposite strands of the DNA at the new location (the target DNA). Mu transposase promotes these two steps during replicative transposition to yield a transposition product in which each transposon end is covalently attached to both the flanking DNA and the target DNA. Cut-and-paste transposases catalyze one or more additional steps in which the non-transferred strand at each element end is cleaved, thus excising the transposon from the flanking DNA before joining. The composition of the Mu nucleoprotein complex, or transpososome, in which these reaction steps take place is relatively well characterized (5Chaconas G. Lavoie B.D. Watson M.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 817-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The stable Mu complex contains four identical transposase subunits (6Lavoie B.D. Chan B.S. Allison R.G.

The Mu transpososome promotes recombination through the repeated use of only two active sites, as defined by the required sets of DDE amino acids. Two of the four stably bound transposase subunits provide DDE resides to the active sites, with each active site containing DDE residues from a single subunit. Each active site catalyzes both donor cleavage and joining at the same Mu DNA end (24Namgoong S.Y. Harshey R.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3775-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Williams T.L.

A second phage-encoded protein, MuB, can also contribute to the Mu transpososome. MuB interacts with the C-terminal domain of transposase (29Wu Z. Chaconas G. J. Biol.

MuB activates assembly of the Mu transpososome, stimulates transposase to promote strand transfer, and guides the choice of target DNA (31Maxwell A. Craigie R. Mizuuchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

S. A. 1987; 84: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 37Chaconas G. Gloor G. Miller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2662-2669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the specific DNA binding and protein conformational changes within the transpososome that are otherwise slow or inefficient in the absence of MuB remain to be discovered. The Mu transpososome binds and manipulates both flanking and target DNA during transposition. DNase I protection studies indicate that up to 20 nucleotides of flanking DNA are bound by transposase subunits within the transpososome (9Mizuuchi M. Baker T.A. Mizuuchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9031-9035Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Before cleavage, the flanking DNA of the cleaved strand must lie within the active sites. The in-line mechanism of phosphoryl transfer dictates that, between the cleavage and joining reaction steps, an organizational change must occur within the two active sites such that the proximity of each 3′OH shifts from near the flanking DNA to near the target DNA. To gain insight into how the Mu transpososome organizes and manipulates these DNA regions during transposition, we studied the impact of the flanking DNA on the kinetics of transposition in the absence of MuB. We show that the presence of the flanking DNA strand that was attached to the 3′OH transposon DNA end before cleavage (the 3′-flanking strand) can specifically slow one or more reaction steps that occur after cleavage. This slow step is clearly observed in the presence of an inhibitor. In addition, the 3′-flanking strand at a single Mu DNA end can slow this step coordinately in both active sites. Furthermore, we provide evidence suggesting that initial binding of the target DNA is not altered by the presence of the 3′-flanking strand. Finally, we demonstrate that MuB enhances the rate of transposition by stimulating the step after cleavage that can otherwise be inhibited by the 3′-flanking strand. Based on these results, we suggest that release of the 3′-flanking strand from both active sites is required after cleavage for efficient and productive binding of the target DNA within the two active sites. A model is proposed for the conversion from cleavage to joining in which MuB allosterically stimulates a conformational change that accomplishes this DNA movement within the active sites. Protein and DNA—MuA 77-663 was purified as described previously (25Williams T.L. Jackson E.L. Carritte A. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2725-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and was used for all transposition reactions. Synthesis, purification, and 32P phosphorylation of the donor fragment component oligonucleotides and annealing of these oligonucleotides to create the donor fragments were as described previously (25Williams T.L. Jackson E.L. Carritte A. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2725-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Donor fragments were made by annealing the following sets of oligonucleotides: long = TB837 plus TB839; long precleaved, with 5′-phosphate of 3′-flanking strand = TB837 plus TB996 plus TB876 (phosphorylated at 5′ end); long precleaved, missing 5′-phosphate = TB837 plus TB996 plus TB876; long mispaired flank = TB837 plus TB1136; long 3′ flank, short 5′ flank = TB612 plus TB839; long precleaved, missing 3′ flank = TB837 plus TB996; short = TB612 plus TB996. All component oligonucleotides lacked a 5′-phosphate unless otherwise stated. Sequence of the oligonucleotides (see Fig. 2A): TB837 = long top strand; TB839 = long bottom strand; TB612 = short top strand; TB996 = short bottom strand; TB876 = 5′-CTAGCAGCTTGGCGTAATCGGGCGTAATGC; TB1136 = 5′-GCTAATGCGGTTCGACGATCTGAAGCGGCGCACGAAAAACGCGAAAGCGTTTCACGATAAATGCGAAAACG. The short donor included only four nucleotides of flanking DNA attached to the 5′ end of the Mu DNA sequence. The supercoiled target DNAs, ϕX174 RFI, 1The abbreviation used is: !

Transposition Reactions—Most reactions (usually greater than 100 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 15% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 12% Me2SO, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 19 nm donor fragment, 19 nm ϕX RFI, 82 nm MuA. MuA stock was diluted directly before use into MuA buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The specific radioactivity of the labeled donor fragment was maintained at a low level (∼2% of donor molecules were 32P-phosphorylated) in each reaction to ensure that most radiolabeled complexes (∼98%) contained one radiolabeled and one unlabeled donor fragment. In the target DNA titration experiments, pBR322 was varied over the indicated range, whereas the ϕX174 concentration was kept at 9.5 nm (which provided a saturating level of inhibitor). In all other experiments, each target DNA molecule included was present at 19 nm. For experiments including MuB, reaction conditions were nearly identical except for the addition of 2 mm ATP (sodium complex, pH 7) and 100 μg/ml MuB. For time-course reactions, all components except MuA were first mixed at 4 °C and then equilibrated to 30 °C for 5 min before adding MuA to start the reaction. The time course proceeded at 30 °C, and 5-μl aliquots were withdrawn at the various time points. For agarose gel analysis, each aliquot was added to 2 μl of stop solution (3% SDS, 50 mm EDTA, 37.5% glycerol, bromphenol blue) already in tubes at room temperature. Quenched time points were separated on a 1% high gelling temperature-agarose (SeaKem) gel in 1× TBE (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA) 7 V/cm, 1.5 h. For sequencing gel analysis, each aliquot was diluted into an aqueous solution (45 μl) containing SDS and EDTA (final concentrations were 0.2% SDS and 70 mm EDTA in 50 μl). After mixing, the quenched time points were extracted once with 25:24:1 phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and then EtOH precipitated with glycogen at –20 °C for exactly 30 min. Time points were resuspended in 10 μl of sequencing sample mix (80% formamide, 10 mm NaOH, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and separated on a pre-warmed 8% urea sequencing gel, at 1700 V, for ∼1 h. Both agarose and sequencing gels were transferred to DEAE paper and dried. Gels were exposed to an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager cassette and were analyzed using MD ImageQuant. Inhibitor—Although the inhibitor present in New England Biolabs ϕX174 RFI has not yet been identified, the effects of the inhibitor were observed in three different preparations, spanning lot numbers 146–150. Similar results were observed over 17 months in 28 independent experiments. Neither Qiagen purification, nor extensive dialysis against 100 mm NaCl, nor treatment with 20 mm EDTA separated the inhibitor from the ϕX174 DNA (data not shown). Where noted, ϕX174 was partially purified by gravity-assisted gel filtration through Bio-gel A5m resin (Bio-Rad) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl; this treatment partially purified the DNA from the inhibitor. The protocol for manufacture of ϕX174 remains constant from the time of experiment to the present (New England Biolabs technical support communication). Samples of New England Biolabs ϕX174 RFI are available upon request. A Single 3′-Flanking DNA Strand within the Mu Transpososome Can Inhibit Transposition in the Absence of MuB—The impact of the flanking DNA on Mu transposition was assessed by following the progress of joined product accumulation in vitro. Time courses were initiated by the addition of Mu transposase monomers to a mixture containing MgCl2, a large supercoiled DNA to serve as the transposition target, and one of two different types of Mu DNA end fragment that functioned as the transposition donor (see Figs. 1B and 2A). In addition to the Mu DNA sequence, the “long” donor fragment contained flanking DNA that extended on both strands past the cleavage site. The “short” donor lacked most flanking DNA and was “precleaved.” Activity was monitored by 32P labeling the donor fragment on the 5′ end of the bottom strand (Fig. 2A) and by following the joining of this strand to the target DNA (Fig. 1). These reactions lacked the MuB activator. MuB was included only in the experiments described in the final section, where its effect is described. Analysis of the progress of joined product accumulation revealed that the long donor fragment was joined to the target DNA significantly more slowly than the short donor fragment. In reactions containing either donor type, agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2B) of the joined DNA species present at early reaction time points showed that both donor fragments within a transpososome were joined to one target DNA molecule nearly simultaneously (Fig. 2B, DEST). Very few products (8–10%) in which a single donor fragment was joined to the target (SEST) were observed. Graphing the fraction of total donor fragments that were joined as a function of time indicated that joined products accumulated more slowly when the reaction contained the long donor fragment (Fig. 2C). The long and short donor fragments differed from each other in two general ways, either (or both) of which could contribute to the difference in progress curves. Unlike the short donor, the long donor fragment possessed both a longer segment of DNA flanking the cleavage site and an intact phosphodiester bond at the cleavage site. To test whether slower transposition was due to the intact cleavage site, the scissile phosphate was removed from the long donor fragment. This “precleaved” long donor analog was therefore identical to the original long donor except for the presence of a “nick” at the cleavage site. Time-course analysis indicated that this precleaved long donor was joined to the target at a rate nearly identical to that observed for the original long donor (Fig. 3A: compare filled circles to filled diamonds), suggesting that the phosphodiester bond at the cleavage site was not responsible for the slower transposition. These results are consistent with the notion that cleavage occurs quickly compared with the rate-determining step(s) (see also next section). During transposition, the 3′OH of the cleaved Mu DNA end must shift proximity from the flanking DNA strand to the target DNA within an active site. This shift could be accomplished by removing only the 5′-phosphate on the 3′-flanking strand from the active site after cleavage (38Kennedy A.K. Haniford D.B. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 2000; 101: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (see also “Discussion”). However, the observation that the “precleaved” long donor, which lacked this phosphate, exhibited the same transposition progress as the original long donor suggested that this phosphate had little impact. To verify this conclusion, transposition progress curves were compared using “precleaved” long donors that either contained or lacked this 5′-phosphate. This analysis indicated that the presence of the 5′-phosphate on the 3′-flanking strand did not appreciably change the transposition progress (Fig. 3B). Together, these results suggest that the slower accumulation of joined product in reactions containing the long donor is due to the presence of the flanking DNA. To identify the flanking DNA feature responsible for slower transposition, time-course reactions were repeated using donor fragment analogs carrying different portions or configurations of the flanking DNA (Fig. 3A). Three were tested: 1) a donor fragment containing unbasepaired flanking strands, where the two strands were identical rather than complimentary (filled triangles), 2) a donor fragment carrying the 3′-flanking strand but only four nucleotides of the 5′-flanking strand (filled squares), and 3) a donor fragment including only the 5′-flanking strand (open triangles). Like the original long donor, transposition occurred slowly when donor analogs included the 3′-flanking strand, regardless of the nature of the 5′-flanking strand. In contrast, when the donor analog lacked the 3′-flanking DNA strand (but contained the 5′-flanking strand), joined product accumulated at a rate nearly identical to that of the original short donor fragment. Thus, some or all of the nucleotides of the 3′-flanking strand, but not the 5′-phosphate itself, slows one or more reaction steps during transposition. This inhibition is independent of both the basepairing between the two flanking strands and the covalent attachment of the 3′-flanking strand to the Mu DNA end. Our previous studies show that, in Mu transpososomes containing one wild-type and one mutant (DDE–) active site, the presence of an uncleaved Mu DNA end in the mutant active site inhibits joining in the wild-type active site (25Williams T.L. Jackson E.L. Carritte A. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2725-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This study suggests that an event required for joining occurs coordinately in the two active sites and that an uncleaved Mu DNA end in just one active site antagonizes this event. To determine whether the 3′-flanking strand similarly slowed transposition in both active sites in wild-type transpososomes, complexes containing one short and one long donor fragment were analyzed. These mixed flank complexes were generated by including both types of donor fragment in the reaction mixture (mixed donor reactions) (25Williams T.L. Jackson E.L. Carritte A. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2725-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This mixture contains not only the mixed flank complexes but also complexes with two long donor fragments and complexes with two short donor fragments. The activity of mixed flank complexes was assessed by 32P labeling either the long or short donor fragment and by then supplying this fragment in limiting quantity; thus, most radiolabeled complexes (∼95%) will be the mixed variety (see Fig. 4A). The transposition activity of the mixed donor reactions demonstrated that the presence of 3′-flanking DNA at just one Mu DNA end within a wild-type transpososome slowed the rate of transposition in both active sites. In reactions containing excess unlabeled long donor, the labeled short donor was joined to the target more slowly than when reactions included only the short donor fragment (Fig. 4B, compare circles to squares). As above, products in which only a single Mu DNA end was joined to the target were rarely observed (data not shown), indicating that joining of the two donor fragments within the transpososome occurred nearly synchronously. Comparison of the progress curve for these mixed donor reactions with the set of curves for the short donor alone indicated that these curves differed significantly (p = 1.6e–34, see Fig. 4). Likewise, when mixed donor reactions contained excess unlabeled short donor, the progress curve approached that observed in reactions containing only the long donor fragment. Although joined product accumulated more quickly in mixed donor reactions when the short donor was radiolabeled, this is likely due to the elevated activity of the contaminating complexes (see Fig. 4). Nonetheless, the progress curves for the mixed donor reactions suggest that the presence of a single 3′-flanking DNA strand within the transpososome can slow recombination of both Mu DNA ends. An Inhibitor in the ϕX174 Target DNA Preparation Cooperates with the 3′-Flanking DNA to Slow Transposition—Although the presence of the 3′-flanking strand within a transpososome inhibits transposition in the experiments described above, the rate of accumulation of joined products did not always differ between the short and long donor fragments. In the above reactions, we included ϕX174 RFI DNA as the target, which is the DNA used as target in numerous published Mu transposition in vitro experiments. We discovered that a contaminant present in the ϕX174 preparation specifically slowed transposition by transpososomes containing the 3′-flanking strand. Several experimental observations support this hypothesis. First, joined products accumulated at a similar rate in reactions containing either the short or long donor fragment when the pUC19 plasmid (or pBR322, data not shown) was substituted for ϕX174 as the target DNA. Second, transposition into these other targets by complexes containing the 3′-flanking strand was slowed when the ϕX174 preparation was also included (Fig. 5A and data not shown). Third, gel filtration of the ϕX174 preparation partially removed the inhibitory contaminant (Fig. 5B). Together, these results suggest that an as yet unidentified inhibitor, present in multiple ϕX174 preparations (see “Experimental Procedures”), slowed transposition in a way that is specific to the presence of the 3′-flanking DNA strand. We asked whether the combination of 3′-flanking DNA and inhibitor acted competitively with respect to target DNA binding to slow transposition. This analysis relies on two assumptions: 1) the inhibitor and the target DNA interact with the transpososome in a reversible manner and 2) binding of inhibitor and target to the complex is in rapid equilibri"
