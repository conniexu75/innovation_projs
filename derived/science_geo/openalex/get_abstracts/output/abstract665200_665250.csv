https://openalex.org/W3112002945,"Rivers support some of Earth’s richest biodiversity1 and provide essential ecosystem services to society2, but they are often fragmented by barriers to free flow3. In Europe, attempts to quantify river connectivity have been hampered by the absence of a harmonized barrier database. Here we show that there are at least 1.2 million instream barriers in 36 European countries (with a mean density of 0.74 barriers per kilometre), 68 per cent of which are structures less than two metres in height that are often overlooked. Standardized walkover surveys along 2,715 kilometres of stream length for 147 rivers indicate that existing records underestimate barrier numbers by about 61 per cent. The highest barrier densities occur in the heavily modified rivers of central Europe and the lowest barrier densities occur in the most remote, sparsely populated alpine areas. Across Europe, the main predictors of barrier density are agricultural pressure, density of river-road crossings, extent of surface water and elevation. Relatively unfragmented rivers are still found in the Balkans, the Baltic states and parts of Scandinavia and southern Europe, but these require urgent protection from proposed dam developments. Our findings could inform the implementation of the EU Biodiversity Strategy, which aims to reconnect 25,000 kilometres of Europe’s rivers by 2030, but achieving this will require a paradigm shift in river restoration that recognizes the widespread impacts caused by small barriers. Validated barrier inventories and modelling indicate that Europe’s rivers are fragmented by more than one million barriers, such as dams, weirs and fords, causing major impacts on biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W3110919514,"Urban, peri-urban forests and other natural areas provide a wide range of material and non-material benefits to people known as ecosystem services. Access to these areas has been linked to benefits for physical and mental health of local populations. In the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic forced many governments to impose a set of restrictions including the closure of businesses, cancelation of public events and schooling, social distancing, limitations on the size of social gatherings, and travel restrictions. During this period of restrictions, we conducted a study assessing the importance of urban and peri-urban forests and other natural areas to people living in and around the city of Burlington, Vermont, USA. We evaluated the self-reported use and changes in personal importance related to these natural areas before and during the period of restrictions. We received over 400 responses to our field survey. The results show that 69.0% of the respondents had increased or greatly increased their visitation rate to our natural areas and urban forests, and 80.6% of respondents considered that the importance of these areas, and access to them, either increased or greatly increased . Moreover 25.8% of the sample had either never, or very rarely accessed their local natural areas before the pandemic, but 69.2% of the first time or infrequent visitors reported that having access to these areas during COVID-19 as ‘very important’. People reported that these areas were important for a wide range of activities from exercise to birding, but also reported values related to reducing stress in a time of global chaos. Our results indicate the increasing demand and value of such areas in times of crisis such as COVID-19. Experts in zoonotic disease predict the potential for more frequent pandemic events, thus predicating the importance for continued funding for, maintenance of, and improved access to, natural areas to our largely urban civilization."
https://openalex.org/W3111231459,"Simple models of interacting spins play an important role in physics. They capture the properties of many magnetic materials, but also extend to other systems, such as bosons and fermions in a lattice, systems with gauge fields, high-Tc superconductors, and systems with exotic particles such as anyons and Majorana fermions. In order to study and compare these models, a versatile platform is needed. Realizing such a system has been a long-standing goal in the field of ultracold atoms. So far, spin transport has only been studied in the isotropic Heisenberg model. Here we implement the Heisenberg XXZ model with adjustable anisotropy and use this system to study spin transport far from equilibrium after quantum quenches from imprinted spin helix patterns. In the non-interacting XX model, we find ballistic behavior of spin dynamics, while in the isotropic XXX model, we find diffusive behavior. For positive anisotropies, the dynamics ranges from anomalous super-diffusion to sub-diffusion depending on anisotropy, whereas for negative anisotropies, we observe a crossover in the time domain from ballistic to diffusive transport. This behavior contrasts with expectations for the linear response regime and raises new questions in understanding quantum many-body dynamics far away from equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W3111661047,"State-of-the-art atomic clocks are based on the precise detection of the energy difference between two atomic levels, which is measured in terms of the quantum phase accumulated over a given time interval1–4. The stability of optical-lattice clocks (OLCs) is limited both by the interrupted interrogation of the atomic system by the local-oscillator laser (Dick noise5) and by the standard quantum limit (SQL) that arises from the quantum noise associated with discrete measurement outcomes. Although schemes for removing the Dick noise have been recently proposed and implemented4,6–8, performance beyond the SQL by engineering quantum correlations (entanglement) between atoms9–20 has been demonstrated only in proof-of-principle experiments with microwave clocks of limited stability. The generation of entanglement on an optical-clock transition and operation of an OLC beyond the SQL represent important goals in quantum metrology, but have not yet been demonstrated experimentally16. Here we report the creation of a many-atom entangled state on an OLC transition, and use it to demonstrate a Ramsey sequence with an Allan deviation below the SQL after subtraction of the local-oscillator noise. We achieve a metrological gain of $$4.{4}_{-0.4}^{+0.6}$$ decibels over the SQL by using an ensemble consisting of a few hundred ytterbium-171 atoms, corresponding to a reduction of the averaging time by a factor of 2.8 ± 0.3. Our results are currently limited by the phase noise of the local oscillator and Dick noise, but demonstrate the possible performance improvement in state-of-the-art OLCs1–4 through the use of entanglement. This will enable further advances in timekeeping precision and accuracy, with many scientific and technological applications, including precision tests of the fundamental laws of physics21–23, geodesy24–26 and gravitational-wave detection27. A many-atom state of trapped 171Yb atoms that are entangled on an optical atomic-clock transition overcomes the standard quantum limit, providing a proof-of-principle demonstration towards entanglement-based optical atomic clocks."

In this case series, we describe characteristics and outcomes of racially and ethnically diverse patients tested for and hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York City's public hospital system.We reviewed the electronic health records of all patients who received a SARS-CoV-2 test between March 5 and April 9, 2020, with follow up through April 16, 2020. The primary outcomes were a positive test, hospitalization, and death. Demographics and comorbidities were also assessed.22254 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2. 13442 (61%) were positive; among those, the median age was 52.7 years (interquartile range [IQR] 39.5-64.5), 7481 (56%) were male, 3518 (26%) were Black, and 4593 (34%) were Hispanic. Nearly half (4669, 46%) had at least one chronic disease (27% diabetes, 30% hypertension, and 21% cardiovascular disease). Of those testing positive, 6248 (46%) were hospitalized. The median age was 61.6 years (IQR 49.7-72.9); 3851 (62%) were male, 1950 (31%) were Black, and 2102 (34%) were Hispanic. More than half (3269, 53%) had at least one chronic disease (33% diabetes, 37% hypertension, 24% cardiovascular disease, 11% chronic kidney disease). 1724 (28%) hospitalized patients died. The median age was 71.0 years (IQR 60.0, 80.9); 1087 (63%) were male, 506 (29%) were Black, and 528 (31%) were Hispanic. Chronic diseases were common (35% diabetes, 37% hypertension, 28% cardiovascular disease, 15% chronic kidney disease). Male sex, older age, diabetes, cardiac history, and chronic kidney disease were significantly associated with testing positive, hospitalization, and death. Racial/ethnic disparities were observed across all outcomes.This is the largest and most racially/ethnically diverse case series of patients tested and hospitalized for COVID-19 in New York City to date. Our findings highlight disparities in outcomes that can inform prevention and testing recommendations."
https://openalex.org/W3111636946,"Commercial fisheries globally experienced numerous and significant perturbations during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting the livelihoods of millions of fishers worldwide. In the Northeast United States, fishers grappled with low prices and disruptions to export and domestic markets, leaving many tied to the dock, while others found ways to adapt to the changing circumstances brought about by the pandemic. This paper investigates the short-term impacts of the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-June 2020) on commercial fishers in the Northeast U.S. to understand the effects of the pandemic on participation in the fishery and fishers’ economic outcomes, using data collected from an online survey of 258 Northeast U.S. commercial fishers. This research also assesses characteristics of those fishers who continued fishing and their adaptive strategies to the changing circumstances. Analysis of survey responses found the majority of fishers continued fishing during the early months of the pandemic, while a significant number had stopped fishing. Nearly all reported a loss of income, largely driven by disruptions of export markets, the loss of restaurant sales, and a resulting decline in seafood prices. Landings data demonstrate that while fishing pressure in 2020 was reduced for some species, it remained on track with previous years for others. Fishers reported engaging in a number of adaptation strategies, including direct sales of seafood, switching species, and supplementing their income with government payments or other sources of income. Many fishers who had stopped fishing indicated plans to return, suggesting refraining from fishing as a short-term adaptation strategy, rather than a plan to permanently stop fishing. Despite economic losses, fishers in the Northeast U.S. demonstrated resilience in the face of the pandemic by continuing to fish and implementing other adaptation strategies rather than switching to other livelihoods."
https://openalex.org/W3112285873,"The global epidemic of (mis)information, spreading rapidly via social media platforms and other outlets, can be a risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders among vulnerable individuals. Cyberchondria can be a vulnerability factor for developing anxiety in a pandemic situation, particularly when the Internet is flooded with (mis)information. The aim of our study was to examine how cyberchondria is related to changes in levels of COVID-19 concern and safety behaviours among persons living in Croatia during the period in which the first COVID-19 case was identified and when the country recorded its first fatality. Repeated cross-sectional data collection was conducted during two waves over a period of three weeks (N1 = 888; N2 = 966). The first began on the day of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Croatia (February 24th, 2020) and the second wave began three weeks later, on the day the first COVID-19 fatality was recorded in Croatia (March 19th, 2020). Participants completed an online questionnaire regarding various COVID-19 concerns and safety behaviours aimed at disease prevention (information seeking, avoidance and hygiene) and a measure of cyberchondria (Short Cyberchondria Scale, SCS). We analysed whether changes to the epidemiological situation during the period between the two waves of data collection led to an increase in COVID-19 related behaviour directly and indirectly via an increase in COVID-19 concerns. The results indicated that, between the two waves of research, there was a pronounced increase in concerns regarding COVID-19 ( b = 1.11, p &lt; .001) as well as significant behavioural changes ( b = 1.18–2.34, p &lt; .001). Also, results demonstrated that cyberchondria plays a moderating role in these changes. In the first wave, persons with severe cyberchondria were already intensely concerned with safety behaviours. High cyberchondria and high levels of concern about the COVID-19 are associated with intense avoidance behaviours, R 2 = .63, p &lt; .001. A moderated partial mediation model was confirmed, in which the effect of the epidemiological situation was weaker for those with higher results on the SCS (as indicated by index of moderated mediation between -.10 and -.15, p &lt; .05). As such, cyberchondria is a contributing factor to long-term anxiety and its impact during pandemic on the general mental health burden should therefore be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W3111140248,"Determination of pile bearing capacity is essential in pile foundation design. This study focused on the use of evolutionary algorithms to optimize Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) algorithm to predict the bearing capacity of driven pile. For this purpose, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) was developed to select the most significant features in the raw dataset. After that, a GA-DLNN hybrid model was developed to select optimal parameters for the DLNN model, including: network algorithm, activation function for hidden neurons, number of hidden layers, and the number of neurons in each hidden layer. A database containing 472 driven pile static load test reports was used. The dataset was divided into three parts, namely the training set (60%), validation (20%) and testing set (20%) for the construction, validation and testing phases of the proposed model, respectively. Various quality assessment criteria, namely the coefficient of determination (R 2 ), Index of Agreement (IA), mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), were used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning (ML) algorithms. The GA-DLNN hybrid model was shown to exhibit the ability to find the most optimal set of parameters for the prediction process.The results showed that the performance of the hybrid model using only the most critical features gave the highest accuracy, compared with those obtained by the hybrid model using all input variables."
https://openalex.org/W3111572917,"Objectives As people living with HIV (PLHIV) age, the burden of non-HIV related comorbidities increases resulting in additional healthcare costs. The present study aimed to describe the profile, the prevalence and the incremental costs of non-HIV related comorbidities in PLHIV compared to non-HIV matched controls (1:2 ratio) in France. Methods The French permanent sample of health beneficiaries ( Echantillon généraliste de bénéficiaires [EGB]), a claims database representative of the national population, was used to assess comorbidities in PLHIV which were identified by the ICD-10 diagnosis codes of hospitalization, full healthcare coverage, and drug reimbursements between 2011 and 2014. The control group was matched by year of birth, gender, region of residence, and economic status. Total costs of outpatient care and hospitalizations were analysed from a societal perspective. A general linear model was used to assess the incremental cost per patient in PLHIV. Results A total of 1,091 PLHIV and 2,181 matched controls were identified with a mean ± standard deviation age of 46.7 ± 11.5 years. The prevalence of alcohol abuse (5.8% vs 3.1%; p&lt;0.001), chronic renal disease (1.2% vs 0.3%; p = 0.003), cardiovascular disease (7.4% vs 5.1%; p = 0.009), dyslipidaemia (22% vs 15.9%; p&lt;0.001), hepatitis B (3.8% vs 0.1%; p&lt;0.001) and hepatitis C (12.5% vs 0.6%; p&lt;0.001) was significantly higher in PLHIV compared with non-HIV controls. Other comorbidities such as anaemia, malnutrition, psychiatric diseases, and neoplasms were also more prevalent in PLHIV. Hospitalizations were significantly increased in PLHIV compared to controls (33.2% vs 16%; p&lt;0.001). Mean total cost was 6 times higher for PLHIV compared to controls and 4 times higher after excluding antiretroviral drugs (9,952€ vs. 2,593€; p&lt;0.001). Higher costs per person in PLHIV were significantly associated to aging (42€ per patient/year), chronic cardiovascular disease (3,003€), hepatitis C (6,705€), metastatic carcinoma (6,880€) and moderate or severe liver disease (6,299€). Conclusion Our results demonstrated an increase in non-HIV related comorbidities among PLHIV compared to matched controls. This study contributes to raise awareness on the burden of chronic comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W3112875168,"Objectives The goal of the present study was to probe the effects of mindfulness practice in a naturalistic setting as opposed to a lab-based environment in the presence of continuous heart rate variability (HRV) measurements. The specific experimental goals were to examine the effects of a brief 10-day online-based mindfulness intervention on both chronic and acute HRV responses. Method We conducted a fully randomized 10-day longitudinal trial of mindfulness practice, explicitly controlling for practice effects with an active-control group (music listening) and a non-intervention control group. To assess c hronic cardiovascular effects, we asked participants in the 3 groups to complete 2-day HRV pre- and post-intervention measurement sessions. Using this experimental setup enabled us to address training effects arising from mindfulness practice to assess physiological impact on daytime as well as nighttime (i.e. assessing sleep quality) on the underlying HRV response. To assess acute cardiovascular effects, we measured HRV in the 2 active intervention groups during each of the 10 daily mindfulness or music sessions. This allowed us to track the development of purported training effects arising from mindfulness practice relative to the active-control intervention in terms of changes in the HRV slope over the 10-day time-course. Results Firstly, for the acute phase we found increased HRV during the daily practice sessions in both the mindfulness and active-control group indicating that both interventions were effective in decreasing acute physiological stress. Secondly, for the chronic phase we found increased HRV in both the day- and nighttime indicating increased sleep quality, specifically in the mindfulness group. Conclusion These results suggest causal effects in both chronic and acute phases of mindfulness practice in formerly naïve subjects and provides support for the argument that brief online-based mindfulness interventions exert positive impact on HRV."
https://openalex.org/W3110804228,"Since the epidemic outbreak in early months of 2020 the spread of COVID-19 has grown rapidly in most countries and regions across the World. Because of that, SARS-CoV-2 was declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020, by The World Health Organization (WHO). That’s why many scientists are working on new methods to reduce further growth of new cases and, by intelligent patients allocation, reduce number of patients per doctor, what can lead to more successful treatments. However to properly manage the COVID-19 spread there is a need for real-time prediction models which can reliably support various decisions both at national and international level. The problem in developing such system is the lack of general knowledge how the virus spreads and what would be the number of cases each day. Therefore prediction model must be able to conclude the situation from past data in the way that results will show a future trend and will possibly closely relate to the real numbers. In our opinion Artificial Intelligence gives a possibility to do it. In this article we present a model which can work as a part of an online system as a real-time predictor to help in estimation of COVID-19 spread. This prediction model is developed using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to estimate the future situation by the use of geo-location and numerical data from past 2 weeks. The results of our model are confirmed by comparing them with real data and, during our research the model was correctly predicting the trend and very closely matching the numbers of new cases in each day."
https://openalex.org/W3113300247,"Objective To estimate the prevalence of disability and anxiety in Covid-19 survivors at discharge from hospital and analyze relative risk by exposures. Design Multi-center retrospective cohort study. Setting Twenty-eight hospitals located in eight provinces of China. Methods A total of 432 survivors with laboratory-confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection participated in this study. At discharge, we assessed instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) with Lawton’s IADL scale, dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) with the Barthel Index, and anxiety with Zung’s self-reported anxiety scale. Exposures included comorbidity, smoking, setting (Hubei vs. others), disease severity, symptoms, and length of hospital stay. Other risk factors considered were age, gender, and ethnicity (Han vs. Tibetan). Results Prevalence of at least one IADL problem was 36.81% (95% CI: 32.39–41.46). ADL dependence was present in 16.44% (95% CI: 13.23–20.23) and 28.70% (95% CI: 24.63–33.15) were screened positive for clinical anxiety. Adjusted risk ratio (RR) of IADL limitations (RR 2.48, 95% CI: 1.80–3.40), ADL dependence (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.15–3.76), and probable clinical anxiety (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.69–3.79) were consistently elevated in survivors with severe Covid-19. Age was an additional independent risk factor for IADL limitations and ADL dependence; and setting (Hubei) for IADL limitations and anxiety. Tibetan ethnicity was a protective factor for anxiety but a risk factor for IADL limitations. Conclusion A significant proportion of Covid-19 survivors had disability and anxiety at discharge from hospital. Health systems need to be prepared for an additional burden resulting from rehabilitation needs of Covid-19 survivors."
https://openalex.org/W3111785302,"In the last 40 years, Latin America countries, including Brazil, have suffered from the emergence and reemergence of arboviruses, first Dengue (DENV) and recently Zika (ZIKV) and Chikungunya (CHIKV). All three arboviruses are currently endemic in Brazil and have caused major outbreaks in recent years. Rio de Janeiro city, host of the last Summer Olympic Games and the Football World Cup, has been specially affected by them. A surveillance system based on symptomatic reports is in place in Rio, but the true number of affected individuals is unknown due to the great number of Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya asymptomatic cases. Seroprevalence studies are more suitable to evaluate the real number of cases in a given population. We performed a populational seroprevalence survey in Rio, with recruitment of a sample of volunteers of all ages and gender from July to October 2018, within randomly selected census tracts and household. A total of 2,120 volunteers were interviewed and tested with rapid immunochromatographic test for ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV. Individuals with positive results for IgG and/or IgM from only one virus were classified accordingly, while those with test results positive for both ZIKV and DENV were classified as flaviviruses. We corrected for sample design and non-response in data analysis, and calculated point estimate prevalence and 95% confidence intervals for each virus. Arbovirus prevalence in the Rio's population (n = 6,688,927) was estimated at 48.6% [95% CI 44.8–52.4] (n = 3,254,121) for flaviviruses and at 18.0% [95% CI 14.8–21.2] (n = 1,204,765) for CHIKV. Approximately 17.0% [95% CI 14.1–20.1] (n = 1,145,674) of Rio´s population had no contact with any of the three arboviruses. The reported cases of Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya by the current surveillance system in place is insufficient to estimate their real numbers, and our data indicate that Zika seroprevalence could be at least five times and Chikungunya 45 times bigger. The high number of individuals having never been infected by any of the three arboviruses, may indicate a proper scenario for future outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W3111862337,"Background A significant proportion of patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) suffer from excessive coagulation activation and coagulopathy which is associated with an increased risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism and adverse outcome. Our study investigates coagulation markers and the incidence of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients receiving recommended anticoagulation strategies. Methods In a retrospective single-center analysis at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland, we investigated 31 adult COVID-19 patients between April 6 th and May 13 th , 2020 and with at least one laboratory assessment of the coagulation markers prothrombin time/Quick, thrombin time, fibrinogen and D-dimers. For antithrombotic prophylaxis low-molecular-weight-heparin or unfractionated heparin was administered and two patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia received argatroban. Results We analyzed 31 patients (68% male, mean age 60± SD 15 years). 22 (71%) of these required intensive care unit treatment, 5 (16%) were hospitalized in a ward, and 4 (13%) were outpatients. Mean fibrinogen levels were markedly elevated to 6.4± SD 1.8g/l, with a peak in the third week of the disease and no significant decrease over time. D-dimers were elevated to a mean value of 5.1±4.4mg/l with peak levels of 6.8±5.3mg/l in the fourth week of disease, and a subsequent decrease. Platelet count (308±136G/l) and PT/Quick (85±22%) showed no significant changes over time. Sensitivity analyses for patients treated in the ICU showed that D-dimer levels were higher in this group. The results of other sensitivity analyses were comparable. Thromboembolic events were diagnosed in 4 (13%) patients and 5 (16%) patients died during the observation period. Conclusion We find coagulation alterations in COVID-19 patients indicating significant hypercoagulability. These alterations are visible despite antithrombotic treatment, and peak around week 3–4 of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3113373567,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) offer the possibility to generate diverse disease-relevant cell types, from any genetic background with the use of cellular reprogramming and directed differentiation. This provides a powerful platform for disease modeling, drug screening and cell therapeutics. The critical question is how the differentiated iPSC-derived cells translate to their primary counterparts. Our refinement of a published differentiation protocol produces a CD14+ monocytic lineage at a higher yield, in a smaller format and at a lower cost. These iPSC-derived monocytes can be further differentiated into macrophages or dendritic cells (DC), both with similar morphological and functional profiles as compared to their primary counterparts. Transcriptomic analysis of iPSC-derived cells at different stages of differentiation as well as comparison to their blood-derived counterparts demonstrates a complete switch of iPSCs to cells expressing a monocyte, macrophage or DC specific gene profile. iPSC-derived macrophages respond to LPS treatment by inducing expression of classic macrophage pro-inflammatory response markers. Interestingly, though iPSC-derived DC show similarities to monocyte derived DC, they are more similar transcriptionally to a newly described subpopulation of AXL + DC. Thus, our study provides a detailed and accurate profile of iPSC-derived monocytic lineage cells."
https://openalex.org/W3083395297,"In the Agriculture sector, control of plant leaf diseases is crucial as it influences the quality and production of plant species with an impact on the economy of any country. Therefore, automated identification and classification of plant leaf disease at an early stage is essential to reduce economic loss and to conserve the specific species. Previously, to detect and classify plant leaf disease, various Machine Learning models have been proposed; however, they lack usability due to hardware incompatibility, limited scalability and inefficiency in practical usage. Our proposed DeepLens Classification and Detection Model (DCDM) approach deal with such limitations by introducing automated detection and classification of the leaf diseases in fruits (apple, grapes, peach and strawberry) and vegetables (potato and tomato) via scalable transfer learning on AWS SageMaker and importing it on AWS DeepLens for real-time practical usability. Cloud integration provides scalability and ubiquitous access to our approach. Our experiments on extensive image data set of healthy and unhealthy leaves of fruits and vegetables showed an accuracy of 98.78% with a real-time diagnosis of plant leaves diseases. We used forty thousand images for the training of deep learning model and then evaluated it on ten thousand images. The process of testing an image for disease diagnosis and classification using AWS DeepLens on average took 0.349s, providing disease information to the user in less than a second."
https://openalex.org/W3112282885,"Melanin, a pigment synthesized by melanocytes in the skin, resists the damage caused by ultraviolet rays to cells. Citric acid, a well-known food additive, is commonly used as an antioxidant and is an important part of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for energy production during cellular metabolism. Here, we aimed to investigate whether the addition of excess citric acid regulates melanin synthesis, and to delineate the underlying mechanism. First, we observed that citric acid exerts opposite redox effects on mouse and human cells. Interestingly, treatment with excess citric acid increased the melanin content in mouse cells but decreased it in human cells. Furthermore, the expression of factors important for melanin synthesis, such as microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), was also regulated by citric acid treatment—it was promoted in mouse cells and suppressed in human cells. Citric acid also impacted the upstream regulators of MITF, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), and β-catenin. Second, we determined the importance of GSK3β in the citric acid-mediated regulation of melanin synthesis, using a GSK3β inhibitor (BIO). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that citric acid regulates melanin synthesis via the GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway, and that equal amounts of exogenous citric acid exert opposing effects on mouse and human cells."
https://openalex.org/W3111864809,"Background Intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) of colorectal cancer (CRC) complicates molecular tumor classification, such as transcriptional subtyping. Differences in cellular states, biopsy cell composition, and tumor microenvironment may all lead to ITH. Here we analyze ITH at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels to ascertain whether subtype discordance between multiregional biopsies reflects relevant biological ITH or lack of classifier robustness. Further, we study the impact of tumor location on ITH. Methods Multiregional biopsies from stage II and III CRC tumors were analyzed by RNA sequencing (41 biopsies, 14 tumors) and multiplex immune protein analysis (89 biopsies, 29 tumors). CRC subtyping was performed using consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), CRC intrinsic subtypes (CRIS), and TUMOR types. ITH-scores and network maps were defined to determine the origin of heterogeneity. A validation cohort was used with one biopsy per tumor (162 tumors). Results Overall, inter-tumor transcriptional variation exceeded ITH, and subtyping calls were frequently concordant between multiregional biopsies. Still, some tumors had high transcriptional ITH and were classified discordantly. Subtyping of proximal MSS tumors were discordant for 50% of the tumors, this ITH was related to differences in the microenvironment. Subtyping of distal MSS tumors were less discordant, here the ITH was more cancer-cell related. The subtype discordancy reflected actual molecular ITH within the tumors. The relevance of the subtypes was reflected at protein level where several inflammation markers were significantly increased in immune related transcriptional subtypes, which was verified in an independent cohort (Wilcoxon rank sum test; p&lt;0.05). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the protein data identified large ITH at protein level; as the multiregional biopsies clustered together for only 9 out of 29 tumors. Conclusion Our transcriptomic and proteomic analyses show that the tumor location along the colorectum influence the ITH of CRC, which again influence the concordance of subtyping."
https://openalex.org/W3112324279,"Currently, qigong and tai chi exercises are the two most common preventive as well as therapeutic interventions for chronic metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the quantitative evaluation of these interventions is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of qigong and tai chi intervention in middle-aged and older adults with T2DM. The study included 103 eligible participants, who were randomized to participate for 12 weeks, in one of the following intervention groups for the treatment of T2DM: fitness qigong, tai chi, and control group. Three biochemical measures, including fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), and C-peptide (C-P) levels, assessed at baseline and 12 weeks, served as the primary outcome measures. During the training process, 16 of the 103 participants dropped out. After the 12-week intervention, there were significant influences on HbA1C ( F 2,83 = 4.88, p = 0.010) and C-P levels ( F 2,83 = 3.64, p = 0.031). Moreover, significant reduction in C-P levels was observed after 12-week tai chi practice ( p = 0.004). Furthermore, there was a significant negative correlation between the duration of T2DM and the relative changes in FPG levels after qigong intervention, and the relative changes in HbA1C levels were positively correlated with waist-to-height ratio after tai chi practice. Our study suggests that targeted qigong exercise might have a better interventional effect on patients with a longer duration of T2DM, while tai chi might be risky for people with central obesity. Trial registration: This trial was registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. The registration number is ChiCTR180020069 . The public title is “Health-care qigong · study for the prescription of chronic diabetes intervention.”"
https://openalex.org/W3034094654,"A lack of sufficient training data, both in terms of variety and quantity, is often the bottleneck in the development of machine learning (ML) applications in any domain. For agricultural applications, ML-based models designed to perform tasks such as autonomous plant classification will typically be coupled to just one or perhaps a few plant species. As a consequence, each crop-specific task is very likely to require its own specialized training data, and the question of how to serve this need for data now often overshadows the more routine exercise of actually training such models. To tackle this problem, we have developed an embedded robotic system to automatically generate and label large datasets of plant images for ML applications in agriculture. The system can image plants from virtually any angle, thereby ensuring a wide variety of data; and with an imaging rate of up to one image per second, it can produce lableled datasets on the scale of thousands to tens of thousands of images per day. As such, this system offers an important alternative to time- and cost-intensive methods of manual generation and labeling. Furthermore, the use of a uniform background made of blue keying fabric enables additional image processing techniques such as background replacement and plant segmentation. It also helps in the training process, essentially forcing the model to focus on the plant features and eliminating random correlations. To demonstrate the capabilities of our system, we generated a dataset of over 34,000 labeled images, with which we trained an ML-model to distinguish grasses from non-grasses in test data from a variety of sources. We now plan to generate much larger datasets of Canadian crop plants and weeds that will be made publicly available in the hope of further enabling ML applications in the agriculture sector."
https://openalex.org/W3111020600,"Livestock grazing and non-native plant species affect rangeland habitats globally. These factors may have important effects on ecosystem services including pollination, yet, interactions between pollinators, grazing, and invasive plants are poorly understood. To address this, we tested the hypothesis that cattle grazing and site colonization by cheatgrass ( Bromus tectorum ) impact bee foraging and nesting habitats, and the biodiversity of wild bee communities, in a shortgrass prairie system. Bee nesting habitats (litter and wood cover) were marginally improved in non-grazed sites with low cheatgrass cover, though foraging habitat (floral cover and richness, bare soil) did not differ among cattle-grazed sites or non-grazed sites with low or high cheatgrass cover. However, floral cover was a good predictor of bee abundance and functional dispersion. Mean bee abundance, richness, diversity and functional diversity were significantly lower in cattle-grazed habitats than in non-grazed habitats. Differences in bee diversity among habitats were pronounced early in the growing season (May) but by late-season (August) these differences eroded as Melissodes spp. and Bombus spp. became more abundant at study sites. Fourth-corner analysis revealed that sites with high floral cover tended to support large, social, polylectic bees; sites with high grass cover tended to support oligolectic solitary bees. Both cattle-grazed sites and sites with high cheatgrass cover were associated with lower abundances of above-ground nesting bees but higher abundance of below-ground nesters than non-grazed sites with low cheatgrass cover. We conclude that high cheatgrass cover is not associated with reduced bee biodiversity or abundance, but cattle grazing was negatively associated with bee abundances and altered species composition. Although floral cover is an important predictor of bee assemblages, this was not impacted by cattle grazing and our study suggests that cattle likely impact bee communities through effects other than those mediated by forbs, including soil disturbance or nest destruction. Efforts aimed at pollinator conservation in prairie habitats should focus on managing cattle impacts early in the growing season to benefit sensitive bee species."

https://openalex.org/W3113111365,"Peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2) is upregulated in various cancers including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). It is a known tumor promoter in some cancers, but its role in OSCC is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of arecoline, an alkaloid of the betel nut, and human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) E6/E7 oncoproteins on induction of PRDX2 expression, and also the effects of PRDX2 overexpression in oral cell lines. Levels of PRDX2 protein were determined using western blot analysis of samples of exfoliated normal oral cells (n = 75) and oral lesion cells from OSCC cases (n = 75). Some OSCC cases were positive for HPV infection and some patients had a history of betel quid chewing. To explore the level of PRDX2 by western blot, the proteins were extracted from oral cell lines that were treated with arecoline or retroviruses containing HPV16 E6 gene and HPV16 E6/E7 expressing vector. For analysis of PRDX2 functions, cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, apoptosis and migration was compared between oral cells overexpressing PRDX2 and cells with PRDX2-knockdown. PRDX2 expression levels tended to be higher in OSCC samples that were positive for HPV infection and had history of betel quid chewing. Arecoline treatment in vitro at low concentrations and overexpression of HPV16 E6 or E6/E7 in oral cells induced PRDX2 overexpression. Interestingly, in oral cells, PRDX2 promoted cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression (G2/M phase), cell migration and inhibited apoptosis. Upregulation of PRDX2 in oral cells was induced by arecoline and HPV16 oncoproteins and promoted growth of OSCC cells."
https://openalex.org/W3111590699,"Introduction Kangaroo mother care (KMC) involves continuous skin-to-skin contact of baby on mother’s chest to provide warmth, frequent breastfeeding, recognizing danger signs of illness, and early discharge. Though KMC is safe, effective and recommended by the World Health Organization, implementation remains limited in practice. The objective of this study is to understand barriers and facilitators to KMC practice at tertiary and secondary health facilities in southern Malawi from the perspective of health workers. Methods This study is part of the “Integrating a neonatal healthcare package for Malawi” project in the Innovating for Maternal and Child Health in Africa initiative. In-depth interviews were conducted between May-Aug 2019 with a purposively drawn sample of service providers and supervisors working in newborn health at a large tertiary hospital and three district-level hospitals in southern Malawi. Data were analyzed using a thematic approach using NVivo 12 software (QSR International, Melbourne, Australia). Findings A total of 27 nurses, clinical officers, paediatricians and district health management officials were interviewed. Staff attitudes, inadequate resources and reliance on families emerged as key themes. Health workers from Malawi described KMC practice positively as a low-cost, low-technology solution appropriate for resource-constrained health settings. However, staff perceptions that KMC babies were clinically stable was associated with lower prioritization in care and poor monitoring practices. Neglect of the KMC ward by medical staff, inadequate staffing and reliance on caregivers for supplies were associated with women self-discharging early. Conclusion Though routine uptake of KMC was policy for stable low birthweight and preterm infants in the four hospitals, there were gaps in monitoring and maintenance of practice. While conceptualized as a low-cost intervention, sustainable implementation requires investments in technologies, staffing and hospital provisioning of basic supplies such as food, bedding, and KMC wraps. Strengthening hospital capacities to support KMC is needed as part of a continuum of care for premature infants."
https://openalex.org/W3111866274,"Background The aetiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is still very controversial, with a peculiar lack of established risk factors or protective behavior. Methods We carried out a case–control study of 634 idiopathic PD patients admitted from 2011 to 2015 to two hospitals located in central Italy and 532 controls matched by hospital, gender and age (± 5 years). The study questionnaire included questions on host factors, family history, residence, occupation and lifestyle. Odds ratios (ORs) for PD and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with logistic regression, adjusting for actual and potential confounders. Results A lower OR was observed in females (0.74; 95%CI:0.58–0.96), while older age classes showed a constantly increased risk for PD (p&lt;0.005) starting from the class 65–69 years. Subjects who reported a first degree relative affected by PD showed a borderline increase which was more evident in those enrolled in the urban center of Rome (OR = 1.65; 95%CI: 1.09–2.50). Significant reduction of the risk was associated to current smoking (OR = 0.48; 95%CI: 0.24–0.54), and to vegetables consumption (p&lt;0.03), while borderline increases were associated to meat and cold cut consumption. Occupational activities classified according to ISCO-08 categories did not show increased risk, while higher ORs’ were found for pilots and physicians. Conclusions The results from this study confirmed the higher risk of PD in males and in elderly, and the inverse association with smoking habit. The possible etiological role of familial clustering, dietary habit, and some job tasks is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W3112054060,"Age and sex differences in brain metabolite concentrations in early life are not well understood. We examined the associations of age and sex with brain metabolite levels in healthy neonates, and investigated the associations between neonatal brain metabolite concentrations and developmental outcomes. Forty-one infants (36–42 gestational weeks at birth; 39% female) of predominantly Hispanic/Latina mothers (mean 18 years of age) underwent MRI scanning approximately two weeks after birth. Multiplanar chemical shift imaging was used to obtain voxel-wise maps of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine, and choline concentrations across the brain. The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, a measure of cognitive, language, and motor skills, and mobile conjugate reinforcement paradigm, a measure of learning and memory, were administered at 4 months of age. Findings indicated that postmenstrual age correlated positively with NAA concentrations in multiple subcortical and white matter regions. Creatine and choline concentrations showed similar but less pronounced age related increases. Females compared with males had higher metabolite levels in white matter and subcortical gray matter. Neonatal NAA concentrations were positively associated with learning and negatively associated with memory at 4 months. Age-related increases in NAA, creatine, and choline suggest rapid development of neuronal viability, cellular energy metabolism, and cell membrane turnover, respectively, during early life. Females may undergo earlier and more rapid regional developmental increases in the density of viable neurons compared to males."
https://openalex.org/W3112563843,"To address the increase in overweight and obesity among mothers and children in sub-Saharan Africa, an understanding of the factors that drive their food consumption is needed. We hypothesized food consumption in Malawi is driven by a combination of factors, including season, food accessibility (area of residence, convenience of purchasing food, female autonomy), food affordability (household resources, food expenditures, household food insecurity), food desirability (taste preferences, body size preferences), demographics, and morbidity. Participants in Lilongwe and Kasungu Districts were enrolled across three types of mother-child dyads: either the mother (n = 120), child (n = 80), or both (n = 74) were overweight. Seven-day dietary intake was assessed using a quantitative food frequency questionnaire during the dry and rainy seasons. Drivers associated with intake of calories, macronutrients, and 11 food groups at p&lt;0.1 in univariate models were entered into separate multivariate linear regression models for each dietary intake outcome. Mother-child dyads with an overweight child had a higher percent of calories from carbohydrates and lower percent of calories from fat compared to dyads with a normal weight child (both p&lt;0.01). These mothers also had the highest intake of grains (p&lt;0.01) and their children had the lowest intake of oil/fat (p = 0.01). Household food insecurity, maternal taste preferences, and maternal body size preferences were the most consistent predictors of food group consumption. Household food insecurity was associated with lower intake of grains, fruits, meat and eggs, oil/fat, and snacks. Maternal taste preferences predicted increased consumption of grains, legumes/nuts, vegetables, fish, and oil/fat. Maternal body size preferences for herself and her child were associated with consumption of grains, legumes/nuts, dairy, and sweets. Predictors of food consumption varied by season, across food groups, and for mothers and children. In conclusion, indicators of food affordability and desirability were the most common predictors of food consumption among overweight mother-child dyads in Malawi."
https://openalex.org/W3110983153,"Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) often becomes resistant to targeted therapies, and in addition, dose-dependent toxicities limit the effectiveness of therapeutic agents. Therefore, identifying novel drug delivery approaches to achieve optimal dosing of therapeutic agents can be beneficial in managing toxicities and to attain optimal therapeutic effects. Previously, we have demonstrated that Honokiol, a natural compound with potent anti-tumorigenic and anti-inflammatory effects, can induce cancer cell apoptosis and inhibit the growth of renal tumors in vivo . In cancer treatment, implant-based drug delivery systems can be used for gradual and sustained delivery of therapeutic agents like Honokiol to minimize systemic toxicity. Electrospun polymeric fibrous scaffolds are ideal candidates to be used as drug implants due to their favorable morphological properties such as high surface to volume ratio, flexibility and ease of fabrication. In this study, we fabricated Honokiol-loaded Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) electrospun scaffolds; and evaluated their structural characterization and biological activity. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance data proved the existence of Honokiol in the drug loaded polymeric scaffolds. The release kinetics showed that only 24% of the loaded Honokiol were released in 24hr, suggesting that sustained delivery of Honokiol is feasible. We calculated the cumulative concentration of the Honokiol released from the scaffold in 24hr; and the extent of renal cancer cell apoptosis induced with the released Honokiol is similar to an equivalent concentration of direct application of Honokiol. Also, Honokiol-loaded scaffolds placed directly in renal cell culture inhibited renal cancer cell proliferation and migration. Together, we demonstrate that Honokiol delivered through electrospun PLGA-based scaffolds is effective in inhibiting the growth of renal cancer cells; and our data necessitates further in vivo studies to explore the potential of sustained release of therapeutic agents-loaded electrospun scaffolds in the treatment of RCC and other cancer types."
https://openalex.org/W3112877350,"Enterobacterales resistant to carbapenems, a class of last-resort antimicrobials, are ranked as an “urgent” and “critical” public health hazard by CDC and WHO. IMP-type carbapenemase-containing Enterobacterales are endemic in Japan, and bla IMP-6 is one of the notable carbapenemase genes responsible for the resistance. The gene is plasmid-encoded and confers resistance to meropenem, but not to imipenem. Therefore, IMP-6-producing Enterobacterales isolates are occasionally overlooked in clinical laboratories and are referred to as ‘stealth-type’. Since previous reports in Japan were confined only to some geographical regions, their distribution across prefectures and the factors affecting the distribution remain unclear. Here, we revealed the dynamics of the geographical distribution of Enterobacterales with IMP-6 phenotype associated with antimicrobial use in Japan. We utilized comprehensive national surveillance data of all routine bacteriological test results from more than 1,400 hospitals in 2015 and 2016 to enumerate Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates with the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern (phenotype) characteristic of IMP-6 (imipenem susceptible, meropenem resistant), and to tabulate the frequency of isolates with the phenotype for each prefecture. Isolates were detected in approximately half of all prefectures, and combined analysis with the national data of antimicrobial usage revealed a statistically significant association between the frequency and usage of not carbapenems but third-generation cephalosporins ( p = 0.006, logistic mixed-effect regression) and a weaker association between the frequency and usage of fluoroquinolones ( p = 0.043). The usage of third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones may select the strains with the IMP-6 phenotype, and contribute to their occasional spread. We expect the findings will promote antimicrobial stewardship to reduce the spread of the notable carbapenemase gene."
https://openalex.org/W3111040083,"Chronic alcohol abuse has been linked to the disruption of executive function and allostatic conditioning of reward response dysregulation in the mesocorticolimbic pathway (MCL). Here, we analyzed genome-wide mRNA and miRNA expression from matched cases with alcohol dependence (AD) and controls (n = 35) via gene network analysis to identify unique and shared biological processes dysregulated in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). We further investigated potential mRNA/miRNA interactions at the network and individual gene expression levels to identify the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD in the brain. By using genotyped and imputed SNP data, we identified expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) uncovering potential genetic regulatory elements for gene networks associated with AD. At a Bonferroni corrected p≤0.05, we identified significant mRNA (NAc = 6; PFC = 3) and miRNA (NAc = 3; PFC = 2) AD modules. The gene-set enrichment analyses revealed modules preserved between PFC and NAc to be enriched for immune response processes, whereas genes involved in cellular morphogenesis/localization and cilia-based cell projection were enriched in NAc modules only. At a Bonferroni corrected p≤0.05, we identified significant mRNA/miRNA network module correlations (NAc = 6; PFC = 4), which at an individual transcript level implicated miR-449a/b as potential regulators for cellular morphogenesis/localization in NAc. Finally, we identified eQTLs (NAc: mRNA = 37, miRNA = 9; PFC: mRNA = 17, miRNA = 16) which potentially mediate alcohol’s effect in a brain region-specific manner. Our study highlights the neurotoxic effects of chronic alcohol abuse as well as brain region specific molecular changes that may impact the development of alcohol addiction."
https://openalex.org/W3111087721,"We previously found that the elevated abundance of the fungus Candida tropicalis is positively correlated with the bacteria Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens in Crohn’s disease patients and the three pathogens, when co-cultured, form a robust mixed-species biofilm. The finding suggests that these three pathogens communicate and promote biofilm formation, possibly through secretion of small signaling molecules. To identify candidate signaling molecules, we carried out a metabolomic analysis of the single-species and triple-species cultures of the three pathogens. This analysis identified 15 metabolites that were highly increased in the triple-species culture. One highly induced metabolite was indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which has been shown to induce filamentation of certain fungi. We thus tested the effect of IAA on biofilm formation of C . tropicalis and demonstrated that IAA promotes biofilm formation of C . tropicalis . Then, we carried out isotope tracing experiments using 13 C-labeled-tryptophan as a precursor to uncover the biosynthesis pathway of IAA in C . tropicalis . The results indicated that C . tropicalis synthesizes IAA through the indole-3-pyruvate pathway. Further studies using inhibitors of the indole-3-pyruvate pathway are warranted to decipher the mechanisms by which IAA influences biofilm formation."

Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1803) is crucial to optimise breeding success in captive breeding programmes of this threatened species. In this study, the pattern of faecal androgen metabolite (fAM) production related to reproductive events (calving or birthing, mating, gestation, and lactation), sexual behaviours as well as environmental cues were studied in captive adult male roan antelope. Faecal sample collection and behavioural observations were carried out from August 2017 to July 2018 for three reproductive males participating in a conservation breeding programme at the Lapalala Wilderness Nature Reserve in South Africa. As a prerequisite, the enzyme immunoassay used in this study was biologically validated for the species by demonstrating a significant difference between fAM concentrations in non-breeding adults, breeding adults and juvenile males. Results revealed that in adults males, the overall mean fAM levels were 73% higher during the breeding period compared to the non-breeding periods, and 85% higher when exclusively compared to the lactation/gestation periods, but only 5.3% higher when compared to the birthing period. Simultaneously, fAM concentrations were lower during the wet season compared to the dry season, increasing with a reduction in photoperiod. With the exception of courtship, frequencies of sexual behaviours monitored changed in accordance with individual mean fAM concentrations in male roan antelope, the findings suggest that androgen production varies with the occurrence of mating activity and may be influenced by photoperiod but not with rainfall."

We propose that this process can be used as a model system to investigate the mechanisms that regulate indirect regeneration of higher plants without the addition of exogenous hormones. This study analyzed the patterns of trans-zeatin and miRNA expression during in vivo regeneration of tomato. Analysis of trans-zeatin revealed that the hormone cytokinin played an important role in in vivo regeneration of tomato. Among 183 miRNAs and 1168 predicted target genes sequences identified, 93 miRNAs and 505 potential targets were selected based on differential expression levels for further characterization. Expression patterns of six miRNAs, including sly-miR166, sly-miR167, sly-miR396, sly-miR397, novel 156, and novel 128, were further validated by qRT-PCR. We speculate that sly-miR156, sly-miR160, sly-miR166, and sly-miR397 play major roles in callus formation of tomato during in vivo regeneration by regulating cytokinin, IAA, and laccase levels. Overall, our microRNA sequence and target analyses of callus formation during in vivo regeneration of tomato provide novel insights into the regulation of regeneration in higher plants."

E . coli -associated illness range from asymptomatic conditions of mild diarrhoea to haemorrhagic colitis which can progress into life threatening haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Beef from cattle are regarded as the main reservoir of Shiga toxin-producing E . coli (STEC) pathogen. The aim of this study was to assess the level and sources of contamination of raw beef with STEC, and determine the incidences of STEC strains in raw beef from informal and commercial abattoirs in Windhoek, Namibia. A total of 204 raw beef samples, 37 equipment and 29 hand swabs were collected and tested for STEC. The meat samples were first enriched with pre-warmed buffered peptone water, cultured on Tryptone Bile X-Glucuronide and CHROMagar STEC, and then sub-cultured on nutrient agar. The presence of E . coli in the samples was confirmed by using VITEK 2 E . coli identification cards and PCR. The overall prevalence of STEC in the meat samples from both the abattoirs was 41.66% raw beef samples; 5.40% equipment swabs; and none of the hand swabs was STEC positive. From the STEC positive meat samples 29.41% contained one of the major STEC strains. Moreover, 52% of the 25 samples that contained the major STECs were characterised by eae and stx 1 , 8% characterised by eae and stx 2 while 40% were characterised by eae , stx 1 and stx 2 virulence genes. This study has revealed the necessity for proper training on meat safety (for meat handlers) as well as the development, implementation and maintenance of effective sanitary dressing procedures at abattoirs to eliminate beef contamination by STECs thereby ensuring the production of wholesome meat, and to prevent the occurrences of STEC infections."
https://openalex.org/W3111481463,"The control charts with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approach and its extension are among the data-driven methods for process monitoring and the detection of faults. Industrial processing data involves complexities such as high dimensionality, auto-correlation, and non-stationary which may occur simultaneously. An efficient fault detection technique is an approach that is robust against data training, sensitive to all the feasible faults of the process, and agile to the detection of the faults. To date, approaches such as the recursive PCA (RPCA) model and the moving-window PCA (MWPCA) model have been proposed when data is high-dimensional and non-stationary or dynamic PCA (DPCA) model and its extension have been suggested for autocorrelation data. But, using the techniques listed without considering all aspects of the process data increases fault detection indicators such as false alarm rate (FAR), delay time detection (DTD), and confuses the operator or causes adverse consequences. A new PCA monitoring method is proposed in this study, which can simultaneously reduce the impact of high-dimensionality, non-stationary, and autocorrelation properties. This technique utilizes DPCA property to decrease the effect of autocorrelation and adaptive behavior of MWPCA to control non-stationary characteristics. The proposed approach has been tested on the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). The findings suggest that the proposed approach is capable of detecting various forms of faults and comparing attempts to improve the detection of fault indicators with other approaches. The empirical application of the proposed approach has been implemented on a turbine exit temperature (TET). The results demonstrate that the proposed approach has detected a real fault successfully."
https://openalex.org/W3112689730,"DNA repair requires reorganization of the local chromatin structure to facilitate access to and repair of the DNA. Studying DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in specific chromatin domains has been aided by the use of sequence-specific endonucleases to generate targeted breaks. Here, we describe a new approach that combines KillerRed, a photosensitizer that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) when exposed to light, and the genome-targeting properties of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Fusing KillerRed to catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) generates dCas9-KR, which can then be targeted to any desired genomic region with an appropriate guide RNA. Activation of dCas9-KR with green light generates a local increase in reactive oxygen species, resulting in “clustered” oxidative damage, including both DNA breaks and base damage. Activation of dCas9-KR rapidly (within minutes) increases both γH2AX and recruitment of the KU70/80 complex. Importantly, this damage is repaired within 10 minutes of termination of light exposure, indicating that the DNA damage generated by dCas9-KR is both rapid and transient. Further, repair is carried out exclusively through NHEJ, with no detectable contribution from HR-based mechanisms. Surprisingly, sequencing of repaired DNA damage regions did not reveal any increase in either mutations or INDELs in the targeted region, implying that NHEJ has high fidelity under the conditions of low level, limited damage. The dCas9-KR approach for creating targeted damage has significant advantages over the use of endonucleases, since the duration and intensity of DNA damage can be controlled in “real time” by controlling light exposure. In addition, unlike endonucleases that carry out multiple cut-repair cycles, dCas9-KR produces a single burst of damage, more closely resembling the type of damage experienced during acute exposure to reactive oxygen species or environmental toxins. dCas9-KR is a promising system to induce DNA damage and measure site-specific repair kinetics at clustered DNA lesions."
https://openalex.org/W3113137819,"It has recently been demonstrated through invasive electrophysiology that visual stimulation with extended patches of uniform colour generates pronounced gamma oscillations in the visual cortex of both macaques and humans. In this study we sought to discover if this oscillatory response to colour can be measured non-invasively in humans using magnetoencephalography. We were able to demonstrate increased gamma (40–70 Hz) power in response to full-screen stimulation with four different colour hues and found that the gamma response is particularly strong for long wavelength (i.e. red) stimulation, as was found in previous studies. However, we also found that gamma power in response to colour was generally weaker than the response to an identically sized luminance-defined grating. We also observed two additional responses in the gamma frequency: a lower frequency response around 25–35 Hz that showed fewer clear differences between conditions than the gamma response, and a higher frequency response around 70–100 Hz that was present for red stimulation but not for other colours. In a second experiment we sought to test whether differences in the gamma response between colour hues could be explained by their chromatic separation from the preceding display. We presented stimuli that alternated between each of the three pairings of the three primary colours (red, green, blue) at two levels of chromatic separation defined in the CIELUV colour space. We observed that the gamma response was significantly greater to high relative to low chromatic separation, but that at each level of separation the response was greater for both red-blue and red-green than for blue-green stimulation. Our findings suggest that the stronger gamma response to red stimulation cannot be wholly explained by the chromatic separation of the stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W3111270671,"Background Deficits in visual statistical learning and predictive processing could in principle explain the key characteristics of inattention and distractibility in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Specifically, from a Bayesian perspective, ADHD may be associated with flatter likelihoods (increased sensory processing noise), and/or difficulties in generating or using predictions. To our knowledge, such hypotheses have never been directly tested. Methods We here test these hypotheses by evaluating whether adults diagnosed with ADHD ( n = 17) differed from a control group ( n = 30) in implicitly learning and using low-level perceptual priors to guide sensory processing. We used a visual statistical learning task in which participants had to estimate the direction of a cloud of coherently moving dots. Unbeknown to the participants, two of the directions were more frequently presented than the others, creating an implicit bias (prior) towards those directions. This task had previously revealed differences in other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autistic spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Results We found that both groups acquired the prior expectation for the most frequent directions and that these expectations substantially influenced task performance. Overall, there were no group differences in how much the priors influenced performance. However, subtle group differences were found in the influence of the prior over time. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity in ADHD do not stem from broad difficulties in developing and/or using low-level perceptual priors."

https://openalex.org/W3113119249,"The main cause of problematic soil failure under a certain load is due to low bearing capacity and excessive settlement. With a growing interest in employing shallow foundation to support heavy structures, it is important to study the soil improvement techniques. The technique of using geosynthetic reinforcement is commonly applied over the last few decades. This paper aims to determine the effect of using geogrid Tensar BX1500 on the bearing capacity and settlement of strip footing for different types of soils, namely Al-Hamedat, Ba’shiqah, and Al-Rashidia in Mosul, Iraq. The analysis of reinforced and unreinforced soil foundations was conducted numerically and analytically. A series of conditions were tested by varying the number ( N ) and the width ( b ) of the geogrid layers. The results showed that the geogrid could improve the footing’s bearing capacity and reduce settlement. The soil of the Al-Rashidia site was sandy and indicated better improvement than the other two sites’ soils (clayey soils). The optimum geogrid width ( b ) was five times the footing width ( B ), while no optimum geogrid number ( N ) was obtained. Finally, the numerical results of the ultimate bearing capacity were compared with the analytical results, and the comparison showed good agreement between both the analyses and the optimum range published in the literature. The significant findings reveal that the geogrid reinforcement may induce improvement to the soil foundation, however, not directly subject to the width and number of the geogrid alone. The varying soil properties and footing size also contribute to both BCR and SRR values supported by the improvement factor calculations. Hence, the output complemented the benefit of applying reinforced soil foundations effectively."

This study aims to: (1) understand the current diagnosis and staging practices for PC; and (2) explore the factors (barriers and enablers) that influence the use of a pancreatic protocol computed tomography (PPCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to confirm diagnosis and/or accurately stage PC. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with radiologists, surgeons, gastroenterologists, medical and radiation oncologists from the states of New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, Australia. Interviews were conducted either in person or via video conferencing. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, de-identified and data were thematically coded according to the 12 domains explored within the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Common belief statements were generated to compare the variation between participant responses. Findings In total, 21 clinicians (5 radiologists, 10 surgeons, 2 gastroenterologists, 4 medical and radiation oncologists) were interviewed over a four-month-period. Belief statements relevant to the TDF domains were generated. Across the 11 relevant domains, 20 themes and 30 specific beliefs were identified. All TDF domains, with the exception of social influences were identified by participants as relevant to protocol-based imaging using either a PPCT or MRI, with the domains of knowledge , skills and environmental context and resources being offered by most participants as being relevant in influencing their decisions. Conclusions To maximise outcomes and personalise therapy it is imperative that diagnosis and staging investigations using the most appropriate imaging modalities are conducted in a timely, efficient and effective manner. The results provide an understanding of specialists’ opinion and behaviour in relation to a PPCT or MRI and should be used to inform the design of future interventions to improve compliance with this practice."
https://openalex.org/W3111344136,"Sutures, the thin, soft tissue between skull bones, serve as the major craniofacial growth centers during postnatal development. In a newborn skull, the sutures are straight; however, as the skull develops, the sutures wind dynamically to form an interdigitation pattern. Moreover, the final winding pattern had been shown to have fractal characteristics. Although various molecules involved in suture development have been identified, the mechanism underlying the pattern formation remains unknown. In a previous study, we reproduced the formation of the interdigitation pattern in a mathematical model combining an interface equation and a convolution kernel. However, the generated pattern had a specific characteristic length, and the model was unable to produce a fractal structure with the model. In the present study, we focused on the anterior part of the sagittal suture and formulated a new mathematical model with time–space-dependent noise that was able to generate the fractal structure. We reduced our previous model to represent the linear dynamics of the centerline of the suture tissue and included a time–space-dependent noise term. We showed theoretically that the final pattern from the model follows a scaling law due to the scaling of the dispersion relation in the full model, which we confirmed numerically. Furthermore, we observed experimentally that stochastic fluctuation of the osteogenic signal exists in the developing skull, and found that actual suture patterns followed a scaling law similar to that of the theoretical prediction."

https://openalex.org/W3111451786,"Alkane-based biofuels are desirable to produce at a commercial scale as these have properties similar to current petroleum-derived transportation fuels. Rationally engineering microorganisms to produce a desirable compound, such as alkanes, is, however, challenging. Metabolic engineers are therefore increasingly implementing evolutionary engineering approaches combined with high-throughput screening tools, including metabolite biosensors, to identify productive cells. Engineering Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce alkanes could be facilitated by using an alkane-responsive biosensor, which can potentially be developed from the native alkane-sensing system in Yarrowia lipolytica , a well-known alkane-assimilating yeast. This putative alkane-sensing system is, at least, based on three different transcription factors (TFs) named Yas1p, Yas2p and Yas3p. Although this system is not fully elucidated in Y . lipolytica , we were interested in evaluating the possibility of translating this system into an alkane-responsive biosensor in S . cerevisiae . We evaluated the alkane-sensing system in S . cerevisiae by developing one sensor based on the native Y . lipolytica ALK1 promoter and one sensor based on the native S . cerevisiae CYC1 promoter. In both systems, we found that the TFs Yas1p, Yas2p and Yas3p do not seem to act in the same way as these have been reported to do in their native host. Additional analysis of the TFs suggests that more knowledge regarding their mechanism is needed before a potential alkane-responsive sensor based on the Y . lipolytica system can be established in S . cerevisiae ."
https://openalex.org/W3111655370,"Over 1 billion USD are devoted annually to rehabilitating freshwater habitats to improve survival for the recovery of endangered salmon populations. Mitigation often requires the creation of new habitat (e.g. habitat offsetting) to compensate population losses from human activities, however offsetting schemes are rarely evaluated. Anadromous Pacific salmon are ecologically, culturally, and economically important in the US and Canada, and face numerous threats from degradation of freshwater habitats. Here we used a matrix population model of coho salmon ( Oncorhynchus kisutch ) to determine the amount of habitat offsetting needed to compensate mortality (2–20% per year) caused by a range of development activities. We simulated chronic mortality to three different life stages (egg, parr, smolt/adult), individually and simultaneously, to mimic impacts from development, and evaluated if the number of smolts produced from constructed side-channels demographically offset losses. We show that under ideal conditions, the typical size of a constructed side-channel in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) (3405 m 2 ) is sufficient to compensate for only relatively low levels of chronic mortality to either the parr or smolt/adult stages (2–7% per year), but populations do not recover if mortality is &gt;10% per year. When we assumed lower productivity (e.g.; 25 th percentile), we found that constructed channels would need to be 2.5–4.5 fold larger as compared to the typical size built in the PNW, respectively, to maintain population sizes. Moreover, when we imposed mortality to parr and smolt/adult stages simultaneously, we found that constructed side-channels would need to be between 1.8- and 2.3- fold larger that if the extra chronic mortality was imposed to one life stage only. We conclude that habitat offsetting has the potential to mitigate chronic mortality to early life stages, but that realistic assumptions about productivity of constructed side-channels and cumulative effects of anthropogenic disturbances on multiple life stages need to be considered."
https://openalex.org/W3112158643,"Software developers need to cope with a massive amount of knowledge throughout the typical life cycle of modern projects. This knowledge includes expertise related to the software development phases (e.g., programming, testing) using a wide variety of methods and tools, including development methodologies (e.g., waterfall, agile), software tools (e.g., Eclipse), programming languages (e.g., Java, SQL), and deployment strategies (e.g., Docker, Jenkins). However, there is no explicit integration of these various types of knowledge with software development projects so that developers can avoid having to search over and over for similar and recurrent solutions to tasks and reuse this knowledge. Specifically, Q&amp;A sites such as Stack Overflow are used by developers to share software development knowledge through posts published in several categories, but there is no link between these posts and the tasks developers perform. In this paper, we present an approach that (i) allows developers to associate project tasks with Stack Overflow posts, and (ii) recommends which Stack Overflow posts might be reused based on task similarity. We analyze an industry dataset, which contains project tasks associated with Stack Overflow posts, looking for the similarity of project tasks that reuse a Stack Overflow post. The approach indicates that when a software developer is performing a task, and this task is similar to another task that has been associated with a post, the same post can be recommended to the developer and possibly reused. We believe that this approach can significantly advance the state of the art of software knowledge reuse by supporting novel knowledge-project associations."
https://openalex.org/W3112791660,"Acceleration change index (ACI) is a fast and easy to understand heart rate variability (HRV) analysis approach used for assessing cardiac autonomic control of the nervous systems. The cardiac autonomic control of the nervous system is an example of highly integrated systems operating at multiple time scales. Traditional single scale based ACI did not take into account multiple time scales and has limited capability to classify normal and pathological subjects. In this study, a novel approach multiscale ACI (MACI) is proposed by incorporating multiple time scales for improving the classification ability of ACI. We evaluated the performance of MACI for classifying, normal sinus rhythm (NSR), congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation subjects. The findings reveal that MACI provided better classification between healthy and pathological subjects compared to ACI. We also compared MACI with other scale-based techniques such as multiscale entropy, multiscale permutation entropy (MPE), multiscale normalized corrected Shannon entropy (MNCSE) and multiscale permutation entropy (IMPE). The preliminary results show that MACI values are more stable and reliable than IMPE and MNCSE. The results show that MACI based features lead to higher classification accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3110830302,"Objective This study examined the feasibility and safety of allogeneic uterus transplantation (UTx) from a living donor and assessed short-term graft viability in a rhesus model. This research is an important step towards further clinical application of UTx in humans. Materials and methods Four female rhesus monkeys with regular menstrual cycles were used in this study, the animals were either donors or recipients depending on ABO blood type compatibility. Retrieval surgery was performed to connect the uterus and uterine arteries together with the ovarian uterine vein from the living donor, and the vagina of the recipient was excised. After the back table had been prepared, bilateral uterine arteries were anastomosed end-to-side with the iliac externa arteries, and bilateral ovarian uterine veins were anastomosed end-to-side with the iliac externa vena. The transplanted uterus was evaluated based on the conditions of arterial blood, and flow was evaluated by transabdominal ultrasonography one month post operation. The conditions of the transplanted uterus were examined by secondary laparotomy. The reproductive function of rhesus monkeys was evaluated on the basis of the menstrual cycle. Results All 4 rhesus monkeys received the transplantation surgery without any surgical complications. No injury occurred in the other organs, and no vascular injury was observed in the allogeneic uterus. All recipients survived after the surgery with a 100% short-term survival rate. All recipients resumed normal menstruation within two months after surgery. Conclusions Our short follow-up shows that allogeneic UTx surgery is a safe and feasible technology in the rhesus model. The arterial conditions and blood flow of the grafted uterus can be monitored by ultrasonography examination."
