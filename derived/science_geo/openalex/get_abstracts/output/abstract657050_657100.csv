https://openalex.org/W3045872583,"Non-genetic factors can cause individual cells to fluctuate substantially in gene expression levels over time. It remains unclear whether these fluctuations can persist for much longer than the time of one cell division. Current methods for measuring gene expression in single cells mostly rely on single time point measurements, making the duration of gene expression fluctuations or cellular memory difficult to measure. Here, we combined Luria and Delbruck's fluctuation analysis with population-based RNA sequencing (MemorySeq) for identifying genes transcriptome-wide whose fluctuations persist for several divisions. MemorySeq revealed multiple gene modules that expressed together in rare cells within otherwise homogeneous clonal populations. These rare cell subpopulations were associated with biologically distinct behaviors like proliferation in the face of anti-cancer therapeutics. The identification of non-genetic, multigenerational fluctuations can reveal new forms of biological memory in single cells and suggests that non-genetic heritability of cellular state may be a quantitative property."
https://openalex.org/W3046758654,"Secretion of pulmonary surfactant in the alveoli of the lungs is essential to maintain lung function. Stretching of alveoli during lung inflation is the main trigger for surfactant secretion. Yet, the molecular mechanisms how mechanical distension of alveoli results in surfactant secretion are still elusive. The alveolar epithelium consists of alveolar epithelial type I (ATI) and surfactant secreting type II (ATII) cells. ATI, but not ATII cells, express caveolae, small plasma membrane invaginations that can respond to plasma membrane stresses and serve mechanotransductive roles. Within this study, we investigated the role of caveolae as mechanosensors in the alveolus. We generated a human caveolin-1 knockout ATI cell (hAELVicav-/- ) using CRISPR/Cas9. Wildtype (hAELViwt ) and hAELVicav-/- cells grown on flexible membranes responded to increasing stretch amplitudes with rises in intracellular Ca2+ . The response was less frequent and started at higher stretch amplitudes in hAELVicav-/- cells. Stretch-induced Ca2+ -signals depended on Ca2+ -entry via piezo1 channels, localized within caveolae in hAELViwt and primary ATI cells. Ca2+ -entry via piezo1 activated pannexin-1 hemichannels resulting in ATP release from ATI cells. ATP release was reduced in hAELVicav-/- cells. In co-cultures resembling the alveolar epithelium, released ATP stimulated Ca2+ signals and surfactant secretion from neighboring ATII cells when co-cultured with hAELViwt but not hAELVicav-/- cells. In summary, we propose that caveolae in ATI cells are mechanosensors within alveoli regulating stretch-induced surfactant secretion from ATII cells."
https://openalex.org/W3046717519,"Neurofibrillary tangles of abnormally hyperphosphorylated Tau are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Tau is truncated at multiple sites by various proteases in AD brain. Although many studies have reported the effect of truncation on the aggregation of Tau, these studies mostly employed highly artificial conditions, using heparin sulfate or arachidonic acid to induce aggregation. Here, we report for the first time the pathological activities of various truncations of Tau, including site-specific phosphorylation, self-aggregation, binding to hyperphosphorylated and oligomeric Tau isolated from AD brain tissue (AD O-Tau), and aggregation seeded by AD O-Tau. We found that deletion of the first 150 or 230 amino acids (aa) enhanced Tau's site-specific phosphorylation, self-aggregation, and binding to AD O-Tau and aggregation seeded by AD O-Tau, but deletion of the first 50 aa did not produce a significant effect. Deletion of the last 50 aa was found to modulate Tau's site-specific phosphorylation, promote its self-aggregation, and cause it to be captured by and aggregation seeded by AD O-Tau, whereas deletion of the last 20 aa had no such effects. Among the truncated Taus, Tau151–391 showed the highest pathological activities. AD O-Tau induced aggregation of Tau151–391 in vitro and in cultured cells. These findings suggest that the first 150 aa and the last 50 aa protect Tau from pathological characteristics and that their deletions facilitate pathological activities. Thus, inhibition of Tau truncation may represent a potential therapeutic approach to suppress Tau pathology in AD and related tauopathies.

We found that Tau truncation from either the N- or C-terminal toward microtubule-binding repeat region (MTBR) modulated the site-specific phosphorylation and enhanced its self-aggregation, its binding to AD O-Tau, and aggregation seeded by AD O-Tau. Among these truncations, Tau151–391 showed the highest pathological activities and aggregation induced by AD O-Tau, both in vitro and in cultured cells. In AD brain, Tau is truncated at multiple sites by various proteases (25Zilka N. Filipcik P. Koson P. Fialova L. Skrabana R. Zilkova M. Rolkova G. Kontsekova E. Novak M. Truncated Tau from sporadic Alzheimer's disease suffices to drive neurofibrillary degeneration in vivo.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580 (16753151): 3582-358810.1016/j.febslet.2006.05.029Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 33Quinn J.P.

Normally, the acidic termini of Tau interact with the microtubule-binding repeats to prevent its aggregation (41Jeganathan S. von Bergen M. Brutlach H. Steinhoff H.J. Mandelkow E. Global hairpin folding of Tau in solution.Biochemistry. 2006; 45 (16475817): 2283-229310.1021/bi0521543Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Based on the truncation sites reported in AD brain and on the acidic terminal regions of Tau (Fig. 1A), we constructed 11 truncation forms of Tau from both the N and C termini of the protein (Fig. 1A), expressed them in HEK-293FT cells, and analyzed the expression by Western blots developed with a battery of monoclonal Tau antibodies (Fig. 1B). Western blots showed that the truncation forms with deletion of the first 50 amino acids (aa)—Tau51–441, Tau51–421, and Tau51–391—were not recognized by antibody 43D (6–18 aa). Truncation with the deletion of the first 150 aa—Tau151–441, Tau151–421, and Tau151–391—was not recognized by antibodies 43D or 63B (74–103 aa). Truncation with the deletion of the first 230 aa—Tau231–441, Tau231–421, and Tau231–391—was not recognized by antibodies 43D, 63B, or Tau 5 (210–230 aa). Deletions of the last 20 aa—Tau1–421, Tau51–421, Tau151–421—or the last 50 aa—Tau1–391, Tau51–391, Tau151–391, and Tau231–391—were not recognized by antibody Tau46.1 (428–441 aa) (Fig. 1C). mAb 77G7 against MTBR was able to detect all truncation forms (Fig. 1C). All truncation forms were tagged with HA at the N terminus and were detected by anti-HA (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that the 12 truncation forms of Tau were constructed and expressed as expected. To learn the toxicity of these Taus, we overexpressed Tau1–441 and 11 truncates of Tau in HEK-293T cells and analyzed lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the medium leaked from cells 48 h after transfection. We found similar levels of released LDH activity from cells overexpressed with the above 12 forms of Tau (Fig. 1D). We further analyzed cell viability in HEK-293T cells by Cell Counting Kit 8 and found similar cell viability in cells with overexpression of the 12 Taus (Fig. 1D). Thus, Tau truncates showed similar effect in cytotoxicity and cell viability as the full-length protein. Abnormal hyperphosphorylation is central to Tau pathogenesis (3Iqbal K. Liu F. Gong C.X. Tau and neurodegenerative disease: the story so far.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2016; 12 (26635213): 15-2710.1038/nrneurol.2015.225Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of Tau truncation on its phosphorylation, we overexpressed the above truncated Taus in HEK-293FT cells and analyzed phosphorylation by Western blots developed with site-specific and phosphorylation-dependent Tau antibodies. We found no detectable Tau phosphorylation at Ser199, Thr205, Thr212, Ser214, or Thr217 in Tau231– (Fig. 2, A–E); at Ser396 or Ser404 in Tau–391 (Fig. 2, I and J); and at Ser422 in Tau–421 and Tau–391 truncation forms (Fig. 2K), confirming the site-specific phosphorylation of Tau. To simplify the comparison, we first analyzed the impact of N-terminal truncation on Tau phosphorylation. We found that deletion of the first 50 aa did not affect Tau phosphorylation at Ser199 (Fig. 2A), Thr212 (Fig. 2C), Ser214 (Fig. 2D), Thr217 (Fig. 2E), Ser235 (Fig. 2G), Ser262 (Fig. 2H), Ser396 (Fig. 2I), Ser404 (Fig. 2J), and Ser422 (Fig. 2K), regardless of C-terminal truncations but slightly suppressed Tau phosphorylation at Thr205 (Fig. 2B) and Thr231 (Fig. 2F). Deletion of the first 150 aa suppressed Tau phosphorylation at Ser199 but significantly increased it at most sites, except at Ser396 and Ser422, independent of the C-terminal truncation (Fig. 2), suggesting that deletion of the first 150 aa enhances Tau phosphorylation at most sites. Deletion of the first 230 aa did not change (Tau–441 and Tau–421) or decreased (Tau-391) Ser235 phosphorylation (Fig. 2G) but significantly increased Tau phosphorylation at Ser262 (Fig. 2H), Ser396 (Fig. 2I), Ser404 (Fig. 2J), and Ser422 (Fig. 2K) in Tau–441 and at Ser262 (Fig. 2H) in Tau–421 (Fig. 2G). However, there was no increase of Ser262 phosphorylation (Fig. 2H) in Tau-391 and of Ser396 phosphorylation (Fig. 2I) in Tau–421. Thus, deletion of the first 50 aa did not affect, but deletion of the first 150 aa significantly enhanced, Tau phosphorylation regardless of the C-terminal truncation. The increase in phosphorylation in Tau with deletion of the first 230 aa depended on intact or partially intact C terminus. Then we determined the effect of the C-terminal truncations on Tau phosphorylation. We found that the C-terminal truncation also modulated Tau phosphorylation site-specifically (Fig. 3). Deletion of the last 20 aa decreased Ser199 phosphorylation in Tau1–, but not in the Tau51– and Tau151– truncation forms (Fig. 3A). Deletion of the last 20 aa did not significantly affect Tau phosphorylation at Thr205, Thr212, Ser214, Thr217, or Ser262 (Fig. 3, B–E), increased at Ser235 (Fig. 3G), and decreased at Ser396 and Ser404 (Fig. 3, I and J) in most truncation forms. Deletion of the last 50 aa increased or tended to increase Tau phosphorylation at Thr205, Thr212, Ser214, Thr217, and Ser235 but did not significantly affect phosphorylation at Ser262 in the most N-terminal truncates (Fig. 3, B–E). Interestingly, deletion of the last 20 or 50 aa suppressed Ser262 phosphorylation in Tau231– truncation forms (Fig. 3H), and deletion of either the last 20 or 50 aa almost abolished or dramatically suppressed Tau phosphorylation at Thr231, Ser396, and Ser404 regardless of N-terminal truncation (Fig. 3, F, I, and J), suggesting that the last 20 aa play a critical role in the regulation of phosphorylation at these sites. These findings suggest that generally, C-terminal truncation can increase the phosphorylation of Tau at the sites located in proline-rich domain (Thr205, Thr212, Ser214, and Thr217) but decrease at sites in microtubule-binding repeat (Ser262) and C-terminal domains (Ser396 and Ser404). Tau is aggregated into NFTs in AD brain. To learn the impact of truncation in Tau aggregation, we overexpressed various HA-tagged truncated Taus in HEK-293FT cells for 48 h, separated RIPA buffer–soluble and –insoluble fractions, and analyzed Tau levels by Western blots developed with anti-HA. We found a significant amount of RIPA buffer–insoluble Tau in cells expressed with Tau truncations, except Tau231–391 (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, we found ∼70-kDa HMW-Tau only in the RIPA buffer–insoluble fraction of Tau151–391 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that Tau151–391 formed the AD-like SDS- and reducing agent–resistant aggregates described previously (21Li L.

The major biological responses of TGFβ signaling are determined by the effector proteins SMAD2 and SMAD3. However, the regulators of TGFβ–SMAD signaling are not completely revealed yet. Here, we showed that the scaffolding protein PDLIM5 (PDZ and LIM domain protein 5, ENH) critically promotes TGFβ signaling by maintaining SMAD3 stability in NSCLC. First, PDLIM5 was highly expressed in NSCLC compared with that in adjacent normal tissues, and high PDLIM5 expression was associated with poor outcome. Knockdown of PDLIM5 in NSCLC cells decreased migration and invasion in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo. In addition, TGFβ signaling and TGFβ-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition was repressed by PDLIM5 knockdown. Mechanistically, PDLIM5 knockdown resulted in a reduction of SMAD3 protein levels. Overexpression of SMAD3 reversed the TGFβ-signaling-repressing and anti-migration effects induced by PDLIM5 knockdown. Notably, PDLIM5 interacted with SMAD3 but not SMAD2 and competitively suppressed the interaction between SMAD3 and its E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1. Therefore, PDLIM5 protected SMAD3 from STUB1-mediated proteasome degradation. STUB1 knockdown restored SMAD3 protein levels, cell migration, and invasion in PDLIM5-knockdown cells. Collectively, our findings indicate that PDLIM5 is a novel regulator of basal SMAD3 stability, with implications for controlling TGFβ signaling and NSCLC progression.

At the initial stage of tumor formation, TGFβ acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation; however, at the later stage, TGFβ plays prometastatic roles (2Massagué J.

The prometastatic effects of TGFβ signaling include accelerated tumor infiltration, cell adhesion, angiogenesis, cell epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and extracellular matrix degradation. In previous decades, lung cancer constituted the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide (4Siegel R.L. Miller K.D. Jemal A. Cancer statistics, 2019.CA Cancer J.

Nevertheless, although numerous therapeutic approaches are available for treating NSCLC, its prognosis remains poor (6Hirsch F.R. Scagliotti G.V. Mulshine J.L. Kwon R. Curran W.J. Wu Y.L. Paz-Ares L. Lung cancer: current therapies and new targeted treatments.Lancet. 2017; 389 (27574741): 299-31110.1016/S0140-6736(16)30958-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). As with most cancers, metastasis represents the dominant reason of NSCLC-related death (7Asselin-Paturel C. Echchakir H. Carayol G. Gay F. Opolon P. Grunenwald D. Chouaib S. Mami-Chouaib F.

According to clinical studies, TGFβ signaling is frequently enhanced in NSCLC, promoting EMT and tumor metastasis (8Xue J. Lin X. Chiu W.T. Chen Y.H. Yu G. Liu M. Feng X.H. Sawaya R. Medema R.H. Hung M.C. Huang S. Sustained activation of SMAD3/SMAD4 by FOXM1 promotes TGF-β–dependent cancer metastasis.J. Clin.

SMAD2 and SMAD3 are two key downstream regulators of TGFβ signaling and play critical roles in TGFβ-mediated biologic functions (10Massagué J. TGFβ signalling in context.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13 (22992590): 616-63010.1038/nrm3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). SMAD3 inhibition diminishes TGFβ-induced EMT in cancer cells (8Xue J. Lin X. Chiu W.T. Chen Y.H.

In addition, the overexpression of SMAD3 accelerates TGFβ-mediated metastasis in NSCLC cells (11Ying Z. Tian H. Li Y. Lian R. Li W. Wu S. Zhang H.Z. Wu J. Liu L. Song J. Guan H. Cai J. Zhu X. Li J.

Notably, the post-translational modification of SMAD3 protein is crucial for regulation of TGFβ signaling. The E3 ligase DEAR has been reported to interact with SMAD3, thus resulting in SMAD3 polyubiquitination and degradation (12Chen N. Balasenthil S. Reuther J. Killary A.M. DEAR1, a novel tumor suppressor that regulates cell polarity and epithelial plasticity.Cancer Res. 2014; 74 (25261235): 5683-568910.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation at Thr66 in SMAD3, mediated by GSK3β, primes the protein for phosphorylation-directed ubiquitination (13Guo X. Ramirez A. Waddell D.S. Li Z. Liu X. Wang X.F. Axin and GSK3-control Smad3 protein stability and modulate TGF-signaling.Genes Dev. 2008; 22 (18172167): 106-12010.1101/gad.1590908Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Hence, it is important to fully understand SMAD3 regulatory mechanisms and how their regulation influences the TGFβ signaling pathway. The scaffolding protein PDLIM5 (also termed ENH), a member of the PDZ–LIM domain protein family, was initially identified as a PKC kinase–binding protein (14Maeno-Hikichi Y. Chang S. Matsumura K. Lai M. Lin H. Nakagawa N. Kuroda S. Zhang J.F. A PKCε-ENH-channel complex specifically modulates N-type Ca2+ channels.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6 (12665800): 468-47510.1038/nn1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). PDLIM5 contains one PDZ and three LIM domains that mediate protein–protein interactions (15Te V.A. Bagowski C.P. PDZ and LIM domain-encoding genes: molecular interactions and their role in development.ScientificWorldJournal. 2007; 7 (17767364): 1470-149210.1100/tsw.2007.232Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition to PKC, PDLIM5 binds multiple protein kinases, including PKD, AMPK, and PKA, making it a versatile scaffolding protein in signaling transduction pathways (16Zheng M. Cheng H. Banerjee I. Chen J. ALP/Enigma PDZ–LIM domain proteins in the heart.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 2 (20042479): 96-10210.1093/jmcb/mjp038Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17Lin C. Guo X. Lange S. Liu J.

PDLIM5 itself is a substrate of AMPK; its phosphorylation represses the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (18Yan Y. Tsukamoto O. Nakano A. Kato H. Kioka H. Ito N. Higo S. Yamazaki S.

Furthermore, PDLIM5 functions as a cytoplasmic sequestration protein for transcription factors ID2 and YAP (19Lasorella A. Iavarone A.

It has been suggested that PDLIM5 promotes EMT and migration of prostate cancer cells (23Liu X. Chen L. Huang H. Lv J.M. Chen M. Qu F.J. Pan X.W. Li L. Yin L. Cui X.G. Gao Y. Xu D.F. High expression of PDLIM5 facilitates cell tumorigenesis and migration by maintaining AMPK activation in prostate cancer.Oncotarget. 2017; 8 (29228678): 98117-9813410.18632/oncotarget.20981Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition, PDLIM5 regulates TGFβ3 signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells and hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in mice (24Chen T. Zhou G. Zhou Q. Tang H. Ibe J.C. Cheng H. Gou D. Chen J.

Moreover, silencing of PDLIM5 suppresses TGFβ signaling and SMAD3 expression in alveolar epithelial cells (25Cheng H. Chen T. Tor M. Park D. Zhou Q. Huang J.B. Khatib N. Rong L. Zhou G. A high-throughput screening platform targeting PDLIM5 for pulmonary hypertension.J. Biomol. Screen. 2016; 21 (26762503): 333-34110.1177/1087057115625924Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, the role of PDLIM5 in NSCLC and in regulation TGFβ signaling remains largely unknown. In the current study, we found that PDLIM5 was up-regulated in NSCLC tissues. PDLIM5 knockdown in NSCLC cells inhibited cellular migration and invasion and TGFβ signaling. PDLIM5 interacted with SMAD3, and PDLIM5 knockdown enhanced the interaction between SMAD3 and its E3 ligase STUB1, resulting in SMAD3 degradation. Together, these results demonstrated that PDLIM5 is a novel SMAD3 regulator linking to SMAD3-mediated TGFβ signaling and lung cancer progression. To evaluate the importance of PDLIM5 in NSCLC, PDLIM5 expression was analyzed using data sets available in the Oncomine database (RRID:SCR_007834). PDLIM5 was highly expressed in three different cohorts of NSCLC patients (Fig. 1, A–C). We confirmed the up-regulation of PDLIM5 in NSCLC samples by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 1D). Moreover, PDLIM5 were significantly increased in NSCLC tissues compared with paired adjacent normal lung tissues as evaluated by immunohistochemistry assay in 40 NSCLC subjects (Fig. 1, E and F). Finally, survival analysis was performed to estimate the association between PDLIM5 expression and lung cancer patient survival using the Kaplan–Meier plotter online bioinformatics resource (RRID:SCR_018753), which revealed that elevated PDLIM5 expression in lung cancer patients was correlated with poor prognosis (Fig. 1G). Thus, PDLIM5 is up-regulated in lung cancer and associated with poor outcome. Next, we evaluated the expression of PDLIM5 in various NSCLC cell lines. PDLIM5 was abundant in A549, H1975, and MSTO cells but not in PC9 cells (Fig. 2A). A549 and H1975 cells were selected for further loss-of-function studies. PDLIM5 was reduced by PDLIM5 knockdown in A549 and H1975 cells using viral-mediated RNA inference (shPDLIM5) (Fig. 2B). Among the three different targeting sequences, shPDLIM5-1 and shPDLIM5-3 resulted in high knockdown efficiency (Fig. 2, B and C). We next performed wound-healing and Transwell migration assays to investigate the function of PDLIM5. PDLIM5 knockdown significantly inhibited the wound-healing capacity (Fig. 2, D and E) and cellular migration (Fig. 2, F and G) of A549 and H1975 cells. Cell invasion was also greatly halted in PDLIM5-knockdown lung cancer cells (Fig. 2, H and I). In addition, PDLIM5 was overexpressed in PC9 cells. PDLIM5 overexpression increased wound-healing capacity, cellular migration, and invasion (Fig. S1, A–D). To explore the role of PDLIM5 in lung metastasis in vivo, we intravenously injected Pdlim5-knockdown Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells (Fig. 2J) into BALB/c nude mice via tail vein. Lung metastatic nodules were significantly reduced in mice injected with Pdlim5-knockdown cells compared with those in mice receiving control LLC cells (Fig. 2, K and L). Together, these observations suggest that PDLIM5 promotes cell migration, invasion, and lung metastasis of lung cancer cells. Next, PDLIM5-knockdown in A549 and H1975 cells reduced cell spreading (Fig. S2A) and adhesion to vascular endothelial cells (Fig. S2, B and C). Using a real-time cell analyzer to record cell adhesion (26Hamidi H. Lilja J. Ivaska J. Using xCELLigence RTCA instrument to measure cell adhesion.Bio. Protoc. 2017; 7 (29367941): e2646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that PDLIM5 knockdown reduced cell adhesion to fibronectin (Fig. S2D). Thus, PDLIM5 is required for cell spreading and cell–ECM and cell–cell interactions. PDLIM5 knockdown in A549 and H1975 cells also significantly attenuated vasculogenic mimicry (Fig. S2, E and F), a process associated with tumor malignancy whereby tumor cells mimic the vascular network (27Fernández-Cortés M. Delgado-Bellido D. Oliver F.J. Vasculogenic mimicry: become an endothelial cell “but not so much.”.Front. Oncol. 2019; 9 (31508365): 80310.3389/fonc.2019.00803Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, PDLIM5 knockdown did not affect cell proliferation, colony formation, and the expression of cell cycle markers PCNA and cyclin D1 (Fig. S1, F–H). Consistently, cell proliferation was not altered in PC9 cells with PDLIM5 overexpression (Fig. S1E). Furthermore, we isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts from Pdlim5 knockout and WT mouse embryos to evaluate the universality of the findings. As in lung cancer cells, Pdlim5 deletion decreased wound-healing capacity without affecting cell proliferation (Fig. S1, I–K). Cell migration and invasion are regulated by TGFβ signaling, and PDLIM5 has been reported to be related to this signaling (24Chen T. Zhou G. Zhou Q. Tang H. Ibe J.C. Cheng H. Gou D. Chen J. Yuan J.X. Raj J.U. Loss of microRNA-17∼92 in smooth muscle cells attenuates experimental pulmonary hypertension via induction of PDZ and LIM domain 5.Am. J. Respir. Crit.

To examine the role of PDLIM5 in regulating TGFβ signaling in lung cancer, gene set enrichment analysis was used with The Cancer Genome Atlas database of lung cancer to analyze the potential association between PDLIM5 and TGFβ pathway. PDLIM5 was strongly co-expressed with genes belonging to the TGFβ pathway in lung cancer (Fig. 3A). TGFβ1 markedly induced SBE-Luc activity in A549 cells, which was significantly repressed by PDLIM5 knockdown (Fig. 3B). PAI1 and JUNB are two well-known downstream targeting genes of TGFβ signaling, whose expression was notably decreased in PDLIM5-knockdown A549 and H1975 cells (Fig. 3C) and in embryonic fibroblasts isolated from Pdlim5-knockout mice (Fig. S3A). Consistent with this, forced expression of PDLIM5 in PC9 cells increased the expression of PAI1 and JUNB (Fig. S3B). EMT is typically induced in lung cancer cells treated with TGFβ1 (9Wang L. Yang H. Lei Z. Zhao J. Chen Y. Chen P. Li C. Zeng Y. Liu Z. Liu X. Zhang H.T. Repression of TIF1γ by SOX2 promotes TGF-β–induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition in non–small-cell lung cancer.Oncogene. 2016; 35 (25961934): 867-87710.1038/onc.2015.141Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Accordingly, upon TGFβ1 stimulation, A549 and H1975 cells exhibited a fibroblast-like morphology, whereas this morphological change was blocked by PDLIM5 knockdown (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis revealed that PDLIM5 knockdown in A549 and H1975 cells significantly decreased TGFβ1-responsive and mesenchymal-related gene expression following TGFβ1 treatment (Fig. 3, E and F). Interestingly, SMAD3 but not SMAD2 expression was decreased in PDLIM5-knockdown cells (Fig. 3, F–H) and in Pdlim5-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Fig. S3C). p-Smad3/Smad3 was unaltered in TGFβ1-treated PDLIM5-knockdown cells (Fig. 3G). PDLIM5 knockdown did not affect the expression of SMAD4, SMAD7, and TGFβR1 (Fig. 3H). In addition, PC9 cells with PDLIM5 overexpression increased the SMAD3 level (Fig. S3D). Together, these results indicated that PDLIM5 regulates SMAD3-mediated TGFβ signaling. To explore whether PDLIM5 function in lung cancer cells was mediated by SMAD3, we first explored the role of SMAD3 in cell migration and invasion. SMAD3 knockdown in A549 cells inhibited cell wound-healing capacity, cellular migration, and invasion (Fig. S1, L–P). The expression of SMAD3 was reduced in Pdlim5-knockout mouse lungs (Fig. S3E). Pdlim5 deletion in mice resulted in alveolarization retardation, which was similar to Smad3-knockout mice (28Chen H. Sun J. Buckley S. Chen C. Warburton D. Wang X.F. Shi W. Abnormal mouse lung alveolarization caused by Smad3 deficiency is a developmental antecedent of centrilobular emphysema.Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2005; 288 (15591413): L683-L69110.1152/ajplung.00298.2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Fig. S3, F and G). Therefore, similar to PDLIM5, SMAD3 promotes cancer cell migration and invasion and lung development. Next, we restored SMAD3 in PDLIM5-knockdown A549 cells. The decreased expression of PAI1 and JUNB in PDLIM5-knockdown A549 cells was recovered upon SMAD3 overexpression (Fig. 4A). The repression of EMT induced by PDLIM5 knockdown was also attenuated by SMAD3 overexpression (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, SMAD3 ectopic expression rescued PDLIM5 knockdown–induced defects in cellular attachment to fibronectin (Fig. S2G) and vasculogenic mimicry (Fig. S2H). Finally, the decreased wound-healing capacity, cellular migration, and invasion in PDLIM5-knockdown A549 cells were all restored by SMAD3 overexpression (Fig. 4, C–F). Taken together, these results clearly support our assessment that the defects in PDLIM5-knockdown cells were due to the decrease of SMAD3. To explore the regulation between PDLIM5 and SMAD3, first, we analyzed PDLIM5 and SMAD3 mRNA levels in NSCLC cell lines available in the Expression Atlas database. No relationship between PDLIM5 and SMAD3 mRNA levels was suggested (r = 0.03, p = 0.77) (Fig. 5A). In contrast, PDLIM5 and SMAD3 protein levels were highly correlated in NSCLC cell lines and NSCLC tissues (Fig. 5, B and C). Further, RT-PCR analysis indicated that PDLIM5 knockdown did not alter SMAD3 mRNA level in A549 and H1975 cells (Fig. 5D). These observations indicated that in the lung cancer cells, PDLIM5 specifically regulates SMAD3 stability. Next, to evaluate SMAD3 turnover, we treated A549 cells with cycloheximide (CHX) to inhibit protein synthesis. PDLIM5 knockdown promoted SMAD3 turnover (Fig. 5E), whereas this was markedly inhibited upon PDLIM5 overexpression in A549 cells (Fig. 5F). Because ubiquitination is an important mechanism for regulating SMAD3 stability, we co-expressed FLAG–SMAD3 and ubiquitin constructs in A549 cells to evaluate whether PDLIM5 regulates SMAD3 ubiquitination. We found that SMAD3 ubiquitination was enhanced upon PDLIM5 knockdown (Fig. 5G) and repressed after PDLIM5 overexpression (Fig. 5G). Importantly, MG132 (an inhibitor of proteasome degradation) effectively inhibited SMAD3 decrease in PDLIM5-knockdown cells (Fig. 5H). Collectively, these findings indicate that PDLIM5 protects SMAD3 from proteasome-mediated degradation. It has been reported that the serine/threonine kinase GSK3β is responsible for SMAD3 degradation (13Guo X. Ramirez A. Waddell D.S. Li Z. Liu X. Wang X.F. Axin and GSK3-control Smad3 protein stability and modulate TGF-signaling.Genes Dev. 2008; 22 (18172167): 106-12010.1101/gad.1590908Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). However, GSK3β activity, as indicated by its phosphorylated state, was not altered in PDLIM5 knockdown A549 cells (Fig. S4A). Moreover, GSK3β knockdown (Fig. S4B) and a GSK3β inhibitor (LiCl) (Fig. S4C) all failed to restore SMAD3 levels in PDLIM5-knockdown A549 cells. Then we questioned whether PDLIM5 stabilizes SMAD3 by direct binding. To test this, FLAG-tagged SMAD3 and HA-tagged PDLIM5 were ectopically expressed in HEK293T cells. Protein pellets precipitated using the anti-FLAG antibody contained the HA-tagged PDLIM5 protein. Specifically, no interaction between SMAD2 and PDLIM5 was detected (Fig. 6A). Immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins in A549 cells confirmed the interaction between PDLIM5 and SMAD3 (Fig. 6B). We therefore proceeded to map the interacting domains in PDLIM5 and SMAD3. LIM domains, the PDZ domain, and PDLIM5 without LIM domains (ΔLIM) were individually expressed in HEK293T cells. SMAD3 was found to interact with the LIM but not the PDZ domain of PDLIM5 (Fig. 6C). In comparison, either the SMAD3 MH1 or MH2 domain interacted with PDLIM5 (Fig. 6D). Last, PDLIM5 co-localization with SMAD3 as revealed by immunofluorescence assay further confirmed this interaction (Fig. 6E). Therefore, PDLIM5 interacts with SMAD3 but not SMAD2. To answer whether the interaction between PDLIM5 and SMAD3 plays a role in stabilizing SMAD3 by PDLIM5, we first transfected truncated PDLIM5 without LIM domains (ΔLIM) in PC9 cells to detect whether it promotes SMAD3 expression. As expected, PDLIM5 mutation, destroying the PDLIM5–SMAD3 interaction, failed to up-regulate SMAD3 in PC9 cells (Fig. S3D). Similarly, PDLIM5 re-expression restored the wound-healing capacity, cellular migration, and invasion in PDLIM5-knockdown cells. However, expression of PDLIM5 mutation (ΔLIM) did not restore the defects (Fig. S3, H–L). Thus, the interaction is required for PDLIM5 to stabilize SMAD3. Because several E3 ligases reportedly regulate SMAD3 degradation, we hypothesized that PDLIM5 may modulate SMAD3 degradation by regulating the activity of certain E3 ligase. An immunoprecipitation (IP)–MS experiment revealed that PDLIM5 bound multiple E3 ligases, among which STUB1 is a E3 ligase for SMAD3 (Fig. 7A). The interaction was confirmed in HEK293T cells expressing HA-PDLIM5 and FLAG-STUB1 by a co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. S4D). Overexpression of STUB1 decreased SMAD3 without altering SMAD2 in A549 cells (Fig. S4E). Moreover, PAI1 and JUNB expression was reduced in STUB1 overexpressed cells (Fig. S4F). Importantly, STUB1 knockdown restored SMAD3 level in PDLIM5 knockdown cells (Fig. 7B). Specifically, STUB1 interacted with the MH2 domain of SMAD3 (Fig. S4G and Fig. 7C). Because both PDLIM5 and STUB1 interacted with the MH2 domain of SMAD3, we next tested whether PDLIM5 affected the interaction between STUB1 and SMAD3. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that reduced PDLIM5 expression enhanced the interaction between STUB1 and SMAD3, whereas PDLIM5 overexpression perturbed this interaction (Fig. 7, D and E). Next, acceptor bleach FRET experiments were carried out with CFP-SMAD3 as the donor and YFP-STUB1 as the acceptor to verify the results. Photobleaching of YFP-STUB1 significantly increased the postbleaching fluorescence intensity of CFP-SMAD3, indicating significant FRET between these two protein. The FRET between CFP-SMAD3 and YFP-STUB1 was disrupted upon PDLIM5 overexpression, suggesting that PDLIM5 repressed STUB1 interacting with SMAD3 (Fig. 7F). Moreover, the decrease of SMAD3 in STUB1-overexpression A549 cells was reversed by the expression of PDLIM5 but not LIM-domain deletion PDLIM5 mutation (Fig. 7G). Notably, STUB1 overexpression in A549 cells reduced cell migration, invasion, cell adhesion, and vasculogenic mimicry (Fig. 8, A–D, and Fig. S2, I and J), similar to those in PDLIM5-knockdown cells. Furthermore, knockdown STUB1 restored the wound-healing capacity, cellular migration, and invasion of PDLIM5-knockdown cells (Fig. 8, E–H). All of these observations indicate that PDLIM5 and STUB1 competitively bind to SMAD3, and PDLIM5 stabilizes SMAD3 by protecting it from STUB1-mediated proteasome degradation.Figure 8STUB1 knockdown reverses the defects in cell migration and invasion upon PDLIM5 knockdown.

https://openalex.org/W3046571233,"The pathological aggregation of tau plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease and many other related neurodegenerative diseases, collectively referred to as tauopathies. Recent evidence has demonstrated that tau oligomers, small and soluble prefibrillar aggregates, are highly toxic due to their strong ability to seed tau misfolding and propagate the pathology seen across different neurodegenerative diseases. We previously showed that novel curcumin derivatives affect preformed tau oligomer aggregation pathways by promoting the formation of more aggregated and nontoxic tau aggregates. To further investigate their therapeutic potential, we have extended our studies o disease-relevant brain-derived tau oligomers (BDTOs). Herein, using well-characterized BDTOs, isolated from brain tissues of different tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and dementia with Lewy bodies, we found that curcumin derivatives modulate the aggregation state of BDTOs by reshaping them and rescue neurons from BDTO-associated toxicity. Interestingly, compound CL3 showed an effect on the aggregation pattern of BDTOs from different tauopathies, resulting in the formation of less neurotoxic larger tau aggregates with decreased hydrophobicity and seeding propensity. Our results lay the groundwork for potential investigations of the efficacy and beneficial effects of CL3 and other promising compounds for the treatment of tauopathies. Furthermore, CL3 may aid in the development of tau imaging agent for the detection of tau oligomeric strains and differential diagnosis of the tauopathies, thus enabling earlier interventions."

Sensory neurons of diabetic patients and diabetic mice demonstrated changes in the SUMOylation status of metabolic enzymes and ion channels. In support of this, profound metabolic dysfunction, accelerated neuropathology, and sensory loss were observed in diabetic gene-targeted mice selectively lacking the ability to SUMOylate proteins in peripheral sensory neurons. TRPV1 function was impaired by diabetes-induced de-SUMOylation as well as by metabolic imbalance elicited by de-SUMOylation of metabolic enzymes, facilitating diabetic sensory loss.

Our work sheds light on the gene networks regulating early gastrulation events in human by defining essential drivers of specific embryonic germ layer fates and essential genes for the exit from pluripotency. The versatile nature of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) grants them the ability to give rise to over 200 somatic cell types (Murry and Keller, 2008Murry C.E. Keller G. Differentiation of embryonic stem cells to clinically relevant populations: lessons from embryonic development.Cell. 2008; 132: 661-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). This capacity awards these cells a central role in analyzing human embryogenesis, in disease modeling, and in regenerative medicine (De Los Angeles et al., 2015De Los Angeles A. Ferrari F. Xi R.

One well-established approach to characterize hPSCs and their differentiated derivatives is to analyze their transcriptome and the changes that occur during their differentiation. Indeed, transcriptome analyses of different stages of early human embryos, as well as the in vitro differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into the early stages of embryonic germ layers at the population or single cell level have proved to be valuable to reveal the regulators of differentiation in an unbiased and systematic way (Blakeley et al., 2015Blakeley P.

Yet, the functional redundancy between similar regulators of differentiation limits the power of transcriptome analysis to predict the essentiality of these factors. Alternatively, loss-of-function genetic screens provide a means to investigate essential genes required for differentiation of hPSCs. Although previously performed short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screens provided insight into the spectrum of gene networks required for specific differentiation pathways, complete loss-of-function studies in human cells to identify essential genes have recently become more feasible with the advent of precise genome editing techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9 (Yang et al., 2012Yang S.-H.

We have recently isolated and characterized haploid hESCs, which provide unequivocal advantage in generating loss-of-function mutations in genome-wide screens (Sagi et al., 2016Sagi I. Chia G.

Using haploid hESCs, we have previously constructed an extensive loss-of-function library by CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, using over 180,000 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and targeting ~18,000 protein-coding genes (Yilmaz et al., 2018Yilmaz A.

Here, we utilized the screening platform we established in haploid hESCs and performed high-throughput genetic screens to interrogate questions regarding early differentiation events during human embryonic development. This systematic approach allowed us to identify and analyze essential genes for the differentiation of hESCs into all three embryonic germ layers. To assess the essentiality of genes for embryonic germ layer differentiation, we first differentiated the loss-of-function library of haploid hESCs into neuroectoderm, early mesoderm, and definitive endoderm (Figure 1A). We characterized the differentiation status of the cells belonging to each germ layer by analyzing their transcriptome, specific gene expression patterns, and protein levels for germ layer markers. Transcriptome signatures of germ layers showed significant divergence from each other and from the undifferentiated hESCs by a principal component analysis (PCA) (Figure 1B). Expression levels of specific markers for neuroectoderm (NES, SOX1, and PAX6), early mesoderm (T, SNAI1, and TBX6), and definitive endoderm (FOXA2, SOX17, and GATA6) increased significantly only in the corresponding germ layer upon differentiation of hESCs (Figure 1C). We also analyzed a larger panel of specific germ layer markers and showed that the expression of these markers selectively increased in their corresponding germ layers upon differentiation (Figures S1A–S1C). Flow cytometry analysis of undifferentiated and differentiated germ layer cells was in agreement with the expression studies and showed that the cells in the differentiated populations had increased SOX1 protein levels for neuroectoderm, NCAM1 for early mesoderm, and SOX17 for definitive endoderm (Figures 1D and S1D–S1F). These analyses demonstrated that the loss-of-function library of haploid hESCs could be efficiently differentiated into the cells of each embryonic germ layer. We then analyzed the changes in abundance of mutant cells between undifferentiated control and differentiated cell populations of each germ layer to determine essentiality during differentiation. The abundance of a mutant cell within the entire mutant cell library is expected to decrease during the course of differentiation, if the mutation affects the fitness of the cells under the differentiation conditions, suggesting that this gene is required for full differentiation. Therefore, such mutations, and hence the cells carrying the sgRNAs causing these mutations, would be represented less within the differentiated mutant populations. To identify these mutations, we amplified the sgRNA-containing regions from the genomic DNA of differentiated and undifferentiated mutant cell populations and quantified the abundance of sgRNAs by high throughput DNA sequencing. We then assigned a CRISPR score (CS) to every gene targeted in the mutant library for each lineage by averaging the log2 ratio of abundance of all sgRNAs targeting each gene between the differentiated and undifferentiated populations. A statistically significant and negative CS indicates depletion of the mutant gene upon differentiation into the germ layer of interest, suggesting essentiality of the gene for normal differentiation. Upon quantifying the changes in abundance of mutants for all germ layers, we could identify essential genes for the normal differentiation of hESCs into neuroectoderm, early mesoderm, and definitive endoderm separately (Table S1). Next, we profiled the distribution of essential genes across cellular compartments for each germ layer and compared this distribution to that of the essential genes for the normal growth and survival of hESCs by using a previously published dataset generated with the same mutant library and methodology (Yilmaz et al., 2018Yilmaz A. Peretz M. Aharony A. Sagi I. Benvenisty N. Defining essential genes for human pluripotent stem cells by CRISPR-Cas9 screening in haploid cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This comparison revealed an enrichment bias toward extracellular matrix- and plasma membrane-associated essential genes for differentiation into each of the three germ layers as compared to the normal growth of hESCs, highlighting the significance of signaling events during these highly dynamic cell fate changes (Figure 1E). In order to gain insight into the specific essential signaling pathways for germ layer differentiation, we profiled all essential genes among the expressed extracellular matrix- and plasma membrane-associated genes for the differentiation of hESCs into neuroectoderm, early mesoderm, and definitive endoderm (Figures 1F–1H). We could identify 239 such genes for neuroectoderm, 211 for early mesoderm, and 302 for definitive endoderm. A predicted protein-protein interaction map among these essential genes revealed several nodes of interactions containing members of both previously suggested and novel specific signaling pathways in each germ layer (Morali et al., 2000Morali O.G.

Yanuka O. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Melton D.A. Benvenisty N. Effects of eight growth factors on the differentiation of cells derived from human embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 11307-11312Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Examples of these pathways included nerve growth factor (NGF), Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT), rearranged during transfection-mitogen-activated protein kinase (RET-MAPK), Ephrin, and NOTCH signaling for neuroectoderm; insulin growth factor (IGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and NOTCH signaling for early mesoderm; and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), FGF, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling for definitive endoderm (Figures 1F–1H, upper panels). To assess the activity of some of these pathways during differentiation into their respective germ layers, we analyzed transcript levels of predicted sets of transcriptional target genes of these pathways based on the NetPath database (Kandasamy et al., 2010Kandasamy K. Mohan S.S. Raju R. Keerthikumar S. Kumar G.S.S. Venugopal A.K. Telikicherla D. Navarro J.D. Mathivanan S. Pecquet C. et al.NetPath: a public resource of curated signal transduction pathways.Genome Biol. 2010; 11: R3Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Among the curated signal transduction pathways available in NetPath database, we analyzed TGF-β pathway for definitive endoderm, FGF pathway for early mesoderm, and NOTCH pathway for neuroectoderm. This analysis revealed that 87% of the predicted transcriptional target genes of TGF-β pathway were expressed in definitive endoderm cells, and 73% of those genes were upregulated during differentiation of hESCs into this germ layer. Similarly, 88% of the predicted target genes of FGF pathway were expressed in early mesoderm cells, whereas 73% of those genes were upregulated upon differentiation of hESCs into early mesoderm. Neuroectoderm cells expressed 75% of the predicted target genes of NOTCH pathway, and 33% of those were upregulated during differentiation into these cells. Together, these observations on specific signaling pathways provide insight into the unique combinations of signaling events that regulate germ layer specifications. A previous analysis of the essential genes for the normal growth and survival of hESCs demonstrated that the growth-retardation phenotypes seen in a group of autosomal recessive disorders could be traced back to the pluripotent state (Yilmaz et al., 2018Yilmaz A. Peretz M. Aharony A. Sagi I. Benvenisty N. Defining essential genes for human pluripotent stem cells by CRISPR-Cas9 screening in haploid cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, we aimed to analyze the differentiation phenotype of the genes causing developmental disorders affecting a specific germ layer. We focused on the disorders affecting cells derived from the neuroectoderm due to the abundance of neurological disorders and the involvement of cell types that are developmentally closer to the neuroectoderm stage we tested in our genetic screen. For this analysis, we retrieved the lists of genes causing developmental disorders associated with single genes from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database (https://omim.org/). We first assessed if the genes causing neurological disorders differed from all the genes in the distribution of their CRISPR scores that represent the changes in abundance of genes between the earliest time points of the mutant hESC library and the differentiated neuroectoderm cells. Indeed, the distribution of scores shifted moderately toward more negative values for this gene group, suggesting increased essentiality for the genes associated with neurological disorders during differentiation into neuroectoderm (Figure 2A). We next investigated genes causing specific neurodevelopmental disorders, namely autism, microcephaly, and macrocephaly, to understand the contribution of early differentiation phenotypes to the development of such disorders (Figures 2B–2E). Interestingly, a group of autism-related genes exhibited increased essentiality based on the shift of their CRISPR scores toward more negative values when compared to all genes (Figure 2B). This essentiality bias was most apparent for microcephaly causing genes, suggesting that early differentiation phenotypes in neuroectoderm contribute to the microcephaly phenotype seen in a group of disorders including hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome, Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, Blackfan-Diamond syndrome, and Ververi-Brady syndrome (Figures 2C–2E). Similar to the comparison made to the earliest time points of the mutant hESC library, early differentiation phenotypes for these disorders could also be detected in a comparison made between differentiated neuroectoderm cells and their corresponding undifferentiated controls, judged by the significant depletion of their mutants (Figure S2A). Conversely, there was no apparent distribution bias toward negative CRISPR scores for genes causing macrocephaly. However, a minor fraction of macrocephaly related genes exhibited a shift in the distribution of their scores toward more positive values, suggesting a contribution of an overgrowth phenotype to the development of these specific disorders with macrocephaly phenotype such as the Cowden syndrome and Joubert syndrome (Figures 2D and 2E). To ensure that the increased essentiality we observed was not caused by any expression bias between the gene groups of different disease categories, we analyzed expression levels of genes belonging to each category in hESCs and the neuroectoderm. For each of the four disease categories, the expression distribution in neuroectoderm shifted toward higher values as compared to the hESCs. However, the median expression levels did not differ drastically from each other between the categories, ruling out any expression bias. These observations suggest that a fraction of neurodevelopmental disorders exhibit early phenotypes during neuroectoderm differentiation and hence can be studied within this easily accessible developmental window. Transcription factors directly regulate cell fate changes by instructing major changes in the transcriptional landscapes of differentiating cells. Thus, we aimed to identify essential transcription factors for the differentiation of hESCs into the three embryonic germ layers and analyze their functional connectivity and upstream regulators. To this end, we first determined essential transcription factors that were predicted to have protein-protein interactions with each other. 68% of the essential expressed transcription factors for neuroectoderm, 64% of those for early mesoderm, and 69% of those in definitive endoderm were predicted to form protein-protein interactions within each group. Next, we analyzed these interconnected essential transcription factor sets in each germ layer for their predicted upstream regulatory transcription factors. Essential expressed transcription factors for neuroectoderm differentiation that were also interconnected by protein-protein interactions were divided into four major groups based on their upstream regulatory transcription factor networks predicted by the online predicting associated transcription factors from annotated affinities (PASTAA) tool (Roider et al., 2009Roider H.G. Manke T. O’Keeffe S. Vingron M. Haas S.A. PASTAA: identifying transcription factors associated with sets of co-regulated genes.Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A, left, heatmap). These four groups showed differing degrees of functional connectivity judged by the extent of predicted protein-protein interactions between the genes within each group (Figure 3A, left, protein-protein interaction maps). Among the four predicted common regulators for neuroectoderm, TEAD2 together with EGR1/2 and SP1/2 families were predicted to co-regulate a group of essential genes, which showed a high degree of functional connectivity, suggesting that this group might act as one of the core essential transcriptional units during neuroectoderm differentiation. Notably, this group includes well-studied neuroectoderm regulators such as SOX2 and POU3F2. Similar to the case of neuroectoderm, essential transcription factors for differentiation into early mesoderm and definitive endoderm were also divided into several smaller commonly regulated groups, each of which showed different levels of functional connectivity (Figure 3A, middle and right). We then analyzed the level of upregulation in expression of these predicted common regulators during differentiation into each germ layer (Figure 3B). In each family of common regulators, members of the family showed different degrees of induction upon differentiation into their germ layer, suggesting that specific family members might be preferentially involved in the transcriptional regulation of the downstream group of essential transcription factors. Moreover, the redundancy between these common regulatory family members might also prevent these factors from being essential for differentiation into their germ layers, as suggested by the failure of their mutants to be significantly depleted in our differentiation screens (Table S2). These analyses on the functional and upstream regulatory connections between essential transcriptional factors revealed unique sets of genes that are transcriptionally co-regulated and might work together as units in a germ layer-specific way. Previously, it has been suggested that a combinatorial analysis between the gene essentiality and expression specificity can be informative to identify the core essential processes for a specific cell type (Yilmaz and Benvenisty, 2019Yilmaz A. Benvenisty N. Defining human pluripotency.Cell Stem Cell. 2019; 25: 9-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed the essentiality of all transcription factors that were selectively upregulated during differentiation of hESCs into each individual germ layer in our screen (Figures 4A–4C) and demonstrated the changes in expression for the essential ones across undifferentiated hESCs and their differentiated progenies in three germ layers (Figures 4D–4F). To better understand the differentiation phenotypes of these essential and germ layer-specific transcription factors, we aimed to individually investigate those factors that showed high levels of specific upregulation in their expression and high essentiality scores (Figures 4A–4C, darker shades of blue, red, and orange). To characterize the differentiation phenotypes of POU3F2, POU3F3, and TBL1X for neuroectoderm, CDX2 and ZBTB10 for early mesoderm, and HNF4α and GLIS1 for definitive endoderm, we targeted these genes in diploid hESCs by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis, using two sgRNAs simultaneously for each gene. By analyzing the expression of the targeted genes by high throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we could show examples of lower expression of the mutant genes in each germ layer, suggesting nonsense-mediated decay as a result of mutagenesis (Figure S3). Transcriptome analysis upon differentiation of these mutants and the control hESCs carrying a non-targeting control sgRNA or no sgRNA in the presence of Cas9 demonstrated a phenotypical hierarchy between different mutants in each germ layer (Figures 5A and S4A–S4C). This hierarchy indicated that the overall transcriptome profiles of TBL1X, ZBTB10, and GLIS1 null mutants were more similar to those of the differentiated control cells in their respective germ layers, whereas POU3F2, POU3F3, CDX2, and HNF4α null mutants had more distinct profiles as compared to the control cells (Figure 5A). Next, we analyzed the genes that were significantly upregulated upon differentiation of hESCs into the control cells of each germ layer, hence can be considered as the marker genes of the germ layers. Each mutant failed to sufficiently upregulate its own unique set of marker genes in its germ layer (Figures 5B–5D). In accord with the phenotypical hierarchy we observed for the overall transcriptome signatures between different mutants, marker expression profile of TBL1X mutant neuroectoderm cells was more similar to the control neuroectoderm cells than to the POU3F2 and POU3F3 mutants (Figure 5B). In contrast, the marker expression profiles of POU3F2 and POU3F3 mutants appeared to be more similar to that of the undifferentiated hESCs, suggesting more central roles for these homeobox gene homologs in the differentiation into neuroectoderm lineage. Similarly, marker expression profiles of CDX2 and HNF4α mutants resembled that of the undifferentiated hESCs, whereas ZBTB10 and GLIS1 null mutants were more similar to their control differentiated mesodermal and endodermal cells, respectively, suggesting a weaker phenotype for the latter two (Figures 5C and 5D). Although each mutant demonstrated a unique transcriptional profile for its expression of marker genes, mutants of the same germ layer shared substantial number of marker genes that they failed to upregulate upon differentiation, suggesting that these essential transcription factors regulate, at least in part, similar downstream pathways. These shared responses between the mutants of each germ layer were enriched in Gene Ontology (GO) terms that were associated with the cell types that these early germ layer cells give rise to (Figures 5E–5G). In neuroectoderm, GO terms such as central nervous system development and neuron differentiation were examples of the most enriched terms among these shared downstream responses across three mutants (Figures 5E and S4D). The genes that contributed to these two GO terms included WNT pathway components such as WNT1, WNT7B, and WLS and also transcription factors such as ATF5, LMX1A, and OLIG3. Notably, the transcription factor LMX1A was identified as an essential gene for neuroectoderm differentiation in our screen. Failure of upregulation of LMX1A transcript levels upon differentiation of POU3F2, POU3F3, or TBL1X mutants suggests that the expression of this essential transcription factor is regulated downstream of three other essential transcription factors. Moreover, the presence of multiple members of WNT pathway that were previously shown to have a role during neuronal differentiation suggests that this important pathway is regulated by these three essential transcription factors (Kalani et al., 2008Kalani M.Y.S.

Currently, this practice predominantly involves task-based fMRI (T-fMRI). Resting state fMRI (RS-fMRI) offers an alternative with several methodological advantages. Here, we compare group-level analyses of RS-fMRI vs. T-fMRI as methods for language localization. Purpose To contrast RS-fMRI vs. T-fMRI as techniques for localization of language function. Methods We analyzed data obtained in 35 patients who had both T-fMRI and RS-fMRI scans during the course of pre-surgical evaluation. The RS-fMRI data were analyzed using a previously trained resting-state network classifier. The T-fMRI data were analyzed using conventional techniques. Group-level results obtained by both methods were evaluated in terms of two outcome measures: (1) inter-subject variability of response magnitude and (2) sensitivity/specificity analysis of response topography, taking as ground truth previously reported maps of the language system based on intraoperative cortical mapping as well as meta-analytic maps of language task fMRI responses. Results Both fMRI methods localized major components of the language system (areas of Broca and Wernicke) although not with equal inter-subject consistency. Word-stem completion T-fMRI strongly activated Broca's area but also several task-general areas not specific to language. RS-fMRI provided a more specific representation of the language system. Conclusion We demonstrate several advantages of classifier-based mapping of language representation in the brain. Language T-fMRI activated task-general (i.e., not language-specific) functional systems in addition to areas of Broca and Wernicke. In contrast, classifier-based analysis of RS-fMRI data generated maps confined to language-specific regions of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W3046417213,"Inhibitors of cAMP-phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) exert a number of promising therapeutic benefits, but adverse effects, in particular emesis and nausea, have curbed their clinical utility. Here, we show that PAN-selective inhibition of PDE4, but not inhibition of PDE3, causes a time- and dose-dependent accumulation of chow in the stomachs of mice fed ad libitum without changing the animals' food intake or the weight of their intestines, suggesting that PDE4 inhibition impairs gastric emptying. Indeed, PDE4 inhibition induced gastric retention in an acute model of gastric motility that traces the passage of a food bolus through the stomach over a 30 minutes time period. In humans, abnormal gastric retention of food is known as gastroparesis, a syndrome predominated by nausea (>90% of cases) and vomiting (>80% of cases). We thus explored the abnormal gastric retention induced by PDE4 inhibition in mice under the premise that it may represent a useful correlate of emesis and nausea. Delayed gastric emptying was produced by structurally distinct PAN-PDE4 inhibitors including Rolipram, Piclamilast, Roflumilast, and RS25344, suggesting that it is a class effect. PDE4 inhibitors induced gastric retention at similar or below doses commonly used to induce therapeutic benefits (e.g., 0.04 mg/kg Rolipram), thus mirroring the narrow therapeutic window of PDE4 inhibitors in humans. YM976, a PAN-PDE4 inhibitor that does not efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier, induced gastroparesis only at significantly higher doses (≥1 mg/kg). This suggests that PDE4 inhibition may act in part through effects on the autonomic nervous system regulation of gastric emptying and that PDE4 inhibitors that are not brain-penetrant may have an improved safety profile. The PDE4 family comprises four subtypes, PDE4A, B, C, and D. Selective ablation of any of these subtypes in mice did not induce gastroparesis per se, nor did it protect from PAN-PDE4 inhibitor-induced gastroparesis, indicating that gastric retention may result from the concurrent inhibition of multiple PDE4s. Thus, potentially, any of the four PDE4 subtypes may be targeted individually for therapeutic benefits without inducing nausea or emesis. Acute gastric retention induced by PDE4 inhibition is alleviated by treatment with the widely used prokinetic Metoclopramide, suggesting a potential of this drug to alleviate the side effects of PDE4 inhibitors. Finally, given that the cause of gastroparesis remains largely idiopathic, our findings open the possibility that a physiologic or pathophysiologic downregulation of PDE4 activity/expression may be causative in a subset of patients."

Based on random sampling of school types and regions, a nationwide hearing survey of the first-year middle and high school students of South Korea was performed. The subjects underwent an otologic examination followed by pure tone audiometry up to 8 kHz. Questionnaires about the factors associated with hearing and tinnitus were completed by the students and their parents. Among the 1,593 subjects who completed the questionnaire and underwent pure tone audiometry, the prevalence of tinnitus was 46.0% and that of severe tinnitus was 9.1%. Tinnitus was associated with age, female gender, history of ear infection and sinusitis, leisure noise exposure due to karaoke and local-area-network gaming, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking. Noticeable hearing loss was not detected but participants with tinnitus complained of difficulty with sound localization, hearing in noise, and verbal working memory and were more susceptible to fatigue. The subjects with tinnitus also suffered more physical and mental health problems than did those without tinnitus. Thus, protection of the ears from noise and appropriate counseling should be considered for adolescents with tinnitus."
https://openalex.org/W3046648668,"Strong evidence suggests that dysregulated lipid metabolism involving dysfunction of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) underlies the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the elderly. A hallmark of AMD is the overproduction of lipid- and protein-rich extracellular deposits that accumulate in the extracellular matrix (Bruch's membrane (BrM)) adjacent to the RPE. We analyzed apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA-1)-containing lipoproteins isolated from BrM of elderly human donor eyes and found a unique proteome, distinct from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) isolated from donor plasma of the same individuals. The most striking difference is higher concentrations of ApoB and ApoE, which bind to glycosaminoglycans. We hypothesize that this interaction promotes lipoprotein deposition onto BrM glycosaminoglycans, initiating downstream effects that contribute to RPE dysfunction/death. We tested this hypothesis using two potential therapeutic strategies to alter the lipoprotein/protein profile of these extracellular deposits. First, we used short heparan sulfate oligosaccharides to remove lipoproteins already deposited in both the extracellular matrix of RPE cells and aged donor BrM tissue. Second, an ApoA-1 mimetic, 5A peptide, was demonstrated to modulate the composition and concentration of apolipoproteins secreted from primary porcine RPE cells. Significantly, in a mouse model of AMD, this 5A peptide altered the proteomic profile of circulating HDL and ameliorated some of the potentially harmful changes to the protein composition resulting from the high-fat, high-cholesterol diet in this model. Together, these results suggest that targeting HDL interactions with BrM represents a new strategy to slow AMD progression in humans.

This is true despite the fact that complement activation is equivalent in these two mouse models (33Landowski M. Kelly U. Klingeborn M. Groelle M. Ding J.D. Grigsby D. Bowes Rickman C.

Interestingly, the variant specific differences detected in these mice were associated with changes in lipid homeostasis. Aged CFH-H/H∼HFC mice have increased ApoA-1 and ApoB48 in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE)/BrM/choroid following the HFC diet when compared with the age-matched, control CFH-Y/0 mice fed the HFC diet (CFH-Y/0∼HFC) (33Landowski M.

ApoA-1 is the major, defining protein associated with HDL, accounting for ∼70% of the protein on the particle, and each HDL particle typically contains 2–5 ApoA-1 molecules (34Kontush A. Lindahl M.

In addition, CFH-H/H∼HFC mice had lower levels of plasma LDL-cholesterol than the CFH-Y/0∼HFC mice (33Landowski M. Kelly U. Klingeborn M. Groelle M. Ding J.D. Grigsby D. Bowes Rickman C.

Taken together, the CFH-H/H∼HFC AMD model provides evidence that there is an intersection between lipid metabolism and the human His-402 “risk”-associated variant of FH. This paper details experimental evidence demonstrating that the lipoproteins present in aged, human donor BrM are HDL-like based on density and size. The protein composition of these HDL-like lipoproteins is very different from the composition found on HDL isolated from the plasma of the same donor, and these BrM HDL-like particles are likely made by the RPE cells. A 96-well plate binding assay was developed that measures the binding of proteins to primary porcine RPE cell culture extracellular matrix (ECM), which we show has a heparan sulfate fingerprint similar to that of human and porcine BrM. This assay was used to demonstrate the binding characteristics of various lipoproteins in the presence or absence of FH and heparan sulfate molecules. In an ex vivo system, using human BrM tissue from aged donors, we demonstrate the potential for therapeutic use of short HS oligosaccharides to remove lipoproteins from deposits in BrM. The effects of an ApoA-1 mimetic peptide, 5A peptide, were also examined in RPE cells and were shown to increase the secretion of HDL-associated proteins when exposed to the peptide. In addition, the 5A peptide was administered to a cohort of the old CFH-H/H∼HFC mice, by intraperitoneal injection for the duration of the HFC diet. HDL was then isolated from the plasma of these mice (CFH-H/H∼HFC + 5A), mice fed an HFC diet alone (CFH-H/H∼HFC), and mice fed a normal diet (CFH-H/H∼ND). The proteomes of these HDL particles were analyzed, and, as shown below, the HDL proteome of the 5A peptide–treated animals was modified to more closely resemble the normal control CFH-H/H∼ND plasma HDL proteome than the HDL proteome in the CFH-H/H∼HFC animals. This is significant because the proteins attached to HDL particles have been shown to affect the properties of HDL (35Van Lenten B.J. Hama S.Y. de Beer F.C. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M.

In certain disease states or even with aging, there is evidence that the HDL proteome can dictate whether the HDL particle is an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant particle or is more harmful, becoming inflammatory and promoting oxidation (35Van Lenten B.J.

Currently, there are no good therapeutic options for those suffering from the early to intermediate forms of AMD, characterized by the appearance of medium-sized sub-RPE drusen (63–125 μm) in early AMD and large drusen (>125 μm) and/or pigmentary abnormalities in intermediate AMD (38Ferris 3rd, F.L.

The ideal therapy would ameliorate the early symptoms and prevent the progression to the late, more impactful disease. Age is the strongest risk factor in developing AMD, with small drusen being a normal finding in aged patients. Understanding the mechanisms that give rise to pathogenic changes in individuals with drusen accumulation that progresses to late AMD is likely to be a key to developing successful therapies for the disease. In this paper, we highlight two potential therapeutic options, one that could reduce already established deposits and the other that may prevent the initial build-up of lipids and proteins. BrM-enriched tissue was isolated from aged human donor eyes. BrM lysates were prepared from 6-mm punches of the tissue using RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors. Lysates from three central “near macula” punches were pooled and fractionated by FPLC, and the total cholesterol in each fraction was analyzed. The majority of cholesterol was detected in HDL-sized lipoproteins (Fig. 1A), although the amounts found in BrM from individual donors were variable. Substantial amounts of cholesterol (>2 μg of HDL-cholesterol per lysate from three 6-mm diameter biopsy punches of BrM-rich tissue) were detected in 11 of 30 eyes (37%) from donors >70 years of age (Table S1). Cholesterol in the FPLC fractions where VLDL and LDL would elute was rarely detected. Human plasma (30 μl) was fractionated in a similar manner (Fig. 1B). Comparison with the fractions containing cholesterol in the BrM tissue lysate confirmed that the cholesterol eluted in the same size fractions as HDL in the plasma (Fig. 1, A and B). Eyes that had appreciable amounts (>2 μg of cholesterol/3 punches, Table S1) of HDL-cholesterol were used to isolate highly purified HDL particles, using the method described by Holzer et al. (39Holzer M. Kern S. Birner-Grünberger R. Curcic S. Heinemann A. Marsche G. Refined purification strategy for reliable proteomic profiling of HDL2/3: impact on proteomic complexity.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 (27917957): 3853310.1038/srep38533Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that uses a 5-h (relatively short) density gradient ultracentrifugation followed by size fractionation on FPLC. This method allows for the reliable quantification and analysis of the HDL proteome. We purified HDL from both BrM (Fig. 1C) and plasma (Fig. 1D) from the same donor and measured cholesterol in each of the FPLC fractions. Most of the cholesterol in the BrM tissue HDL sample was detected in fractions 22–29, and all of the cholesterol in plasma HDL was in fractions 24–28. ApoA-1, ApoE, and ApoB were assayed in each of these fractions by Western blotting (Fig. 1E). With the amount of ApoA-1 normalized, considerably more ApoB and ApoE were found in the HDL-like lipoproteins isolated from the BrM tissue than in the HDL purified from the plasma (Fig. 1E). The LC–MS/MS–based proteomic analysis of 25 μg of protein from each of the isolated BrM HDL and plasma HDL confirmed these findings and revealed other interesting protein changes (Table 1). The amounts of proteins are displayed as the percentage of each protein (fmol) relative to ApoA-1 (fmol) in each sample. In total, three sets of HDL from BrM and plasma were isolated and analyzed. Two of the sets were BrM and plasma HDL from the same donor (Table 1, sets A and B), and one set was plasma HDL from a normal American Red Cross plasma donor and BrM HDL from an aged human donor eye (Table 1, set C). In all three comparisons, ApoB, ApoE, ApoA-IV, and ApoC-III were higher in the BrM HDL than in the plasma HDL. In addition, there was more C3, clusterin, and vitronectin in the BrM HDL. Albumin, fibrinogen, and hemoglobin β were also consistently higher in the BrM HDL (Table 1). The extent of the changes was highly variable; however, two of the most prevalent proteins increased on the BrM HDL are ApoB and ApoE, and they, unlike most of the other proteins identified by proteomics, are known to bind to GAGs.Table 1Comparison of the HDL proteomes isolated from human BrM tissue and plasma of the same donorsAccession no.

https://openalex.org/W3046318901,"The craniofacial developmental disorder Burn-McKeown Syndrome (BMKS) is caused by biallelic variants in the pre-messenger RNA splicing factor gene TXNL4A/DIB1. The majority of affected individuals with BMKS have a 34 base pair deletion in the promoter region of one allele of TXNL4A combined with a loss-of-function variant on the other allele, resulting in reduced TXNL4A expression. However, it is unclear how reduced expression of this ubiquitously expressed spliceosome protein results in craniofacial defects during development. Here we reprogrammed peripheral mononuclear blood cells from a BMKS patient and her unaffected mother into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated the iPSCs into induced neural crest cells (iNCCs), the key cell type required for correct craniofacial development. BMKS patient-derived iPSCs proliferated more slowly than both mother- and unrelated control-derived iPSCs, and RNA-Seq analysis revealed significant differences in gene expression and alternative splicing. Patient iPSCs displayed defective differentiation into iNCCs compared to maternal and unrelated control iPSCs, in particular a delay in undergoing an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). RNA-Seq analysis of differentiated iNCCs revealed widespread gene expression changes and mis-splicing in genes relevant to craniofacial and embryonic development that highlight a dampened response to WNT signalling, the key pathway activated during iNCC differentiation. Furthermore, we identified the mis-splicing of TCF7L2 exon 4, a key gene in the WNT pathway, as a potential cause of the downregulated WNT response in patient cells. Additionally, mis-spliced genes shared common sequence properties such as length, branch point to 3' splice site (BPS-3'SS) distance and splice site strengths, suggesting that splicing of particular subsets of genes is particularly sensitive to changes in TXNL4A expression. Together, these data provide the first insight into how reduced TXNL4A expression in BMKS patients might compromise splicing and NCC function, resulting in defective craniofacial development in the embryo."
https://openalex.org/W3046537129,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is the canonical enzyme for investigating how distinct structural elements influence enzyme catalytic activity. Although it is recognized that dynamics are essential for PTP1B function, the data collected thus far have not resolved whether distinct elements are dynamically coordinated or, alternatively, whether they fulfill their respective functions independently. To answer this question, we performed a comprehensive 13C-methyl relaxation study of Ile, Leu, and Val (ILV) residues of PTP1B, which, because of its substantially increased sensitivity, provides a comprehensive understanding of the influence of protein motions on different time scales for enzyme function. We discovered that PTP1B exhibits dynamics at three distinct time scales. First, it undergoes a distinctive slow motion that allows for the dynamic binding and release of its two most N-terminal helices from the catalytic core. Second, we showed that PTP1B 13C-methyl group side chain fast time-scale dynamics and 15N backbone fast time-scale dynamics are fully consistent, demonstrating that fast fluctuations are essential for the allosteric control of PTP1B activity. Third, and most importantly, using 13C ILV constant-time Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill relaxation measurements experiments, we demonstrated that all four catalytically important loops—the WPD, Q, E, and substrate-binding loops—work in dynamic unity throughout the catalytic cycle of PTP1B. Thus, these data show that PTP1B activity is not controlled by a single functional element, but instead all key elements are dynamically coordinated. Together, these data provide the first fully comprehensive picture on how the validated drug target PTP1B functions."

The PrLmSAP sequence was fused to the β-glucuronidase (gusA) reporter gene and transferred to rice. Histochemical GUS staining showed a pattern of tissue-specific expression in transgenic rice, with staining observed in roots, coleoptiles, leaves, stems and floral organs but not in seeds or in the root elongation zone. Wounding strongly stimulated GUS accumulation in leaves and stems. Interestingly, we observed a high stimulation of the promoter activity when rice seedlings were exposed to NaCl, PEG, ABA, MeJA, GA, cold, and heavy metals (Al3+, Cd2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+). These results suggest that the LmSAP promoter can be a convenient tool for stress-inducible gene expression and is a potential candidate for crop genetic engineering."
https://openalex.org/W3046382541,"Background Second-line treatments boost overall survival in advanced gastric cancer (AGC). However, there is a paucity of information as to patterns of use and the results achieved in actual clinical practice. Materials and methods The study population comprised patients with AGC in the AGAMENON registry who had received second-line. The objective was to describe the pattern of second-line therapies administered, progression-free survival following second-line (PFS-2), and post-progression survival since first-line (PPS). Results 2311 cases with 2066 progression events since first-line (89.3%) were recorded; 245 (10.6%) patients died during first-line treatment and 1326/2066 (64.1%) received a second-line. Median PFS-2 and PPS were 3.1 (95% CI, 2.9–3.3) and 5.8 months (5.5–6.3), respectively. The most widely used strategies were monoCT (56.9%), polyCT (15.0%), ramucirumab+CT (12.6%), platinum-reintroduction (8.3%), trastuzumab+CT (6.1%), and ramucirumab (1.1%). PFS-2/PPS medians gradually increased in monoCT, 2.6/5.1 months; polyCT 3.4/6.3 months; ramucirumab+CT, 4.1/6.5 months; platinum-reintroduction, 4.2/6.7 months, and for the HER2+ subgroup in particular, trastuzumab+CT, 5.2/11.7 months. Correlation between PFS since first-line and OS was moderate in the series as a whole (Kendall’s τ = 0.613), lower in those subjects who received second-line (Kendall’s τ = 0.539), especially with ramucirumab+CT (Kendall’s τ = 0.413). Conclusion This analysis reveals the diversity in second-line treatment for AGC, highlighting the effectiveness of paclitaxel-ramucirumab and, for a selected subgroup of patients, platinum reintroduction; both strategies endorsed by recent clinical guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W3046629175,"Maximum lifespan for most animal species is difficult to define. This is challenging for wildlife management as it is critical for estimating important aspects of population biology such as mortality rate, population viability, and period of reproductive potential. Recently, it has been shown cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) density is predictive of maximum lifespan in vertebrates. This has made it possible to predict lifespan in long-lived species, which are generally the most intractable. In this study, we use gene promoter CpG density to predict the lifespan of five marine turtle species. Marine turtles are a particularly difficult group for lifespan estimation because of their migratory behaviour, longevity and high juvenile mortality rates, which all restrict individual tracking over their lifespan. Sanger sequencing was used to determine the CpG density in selected promoters. We predicted the lifespans for marine turtle species ranged from 50.4 years (flatback turtle, Natator depressus) to 90.4 years (leatherback turtle, Dermochelys coriacea). These lifespan predictions have broad applications in marine turtle research such as better understanding life cycles and determining population viability."
https://openalex.org/W3046239554,"Pathogenic mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, and Mycobacterium marinum, can trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation leading to maturation and secretion of interleukin 1β (IL-1β). However, the mycobacterial factors involved in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome are not fully understood. Here, we identified that the PPE family protein PPE13 was responsible for the induction of IL-1β secretion in a NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent manner. We found that the recombinant Mycobacterium smegmatis expressing PPE13 activates NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby inducing caspase-1 cleavage and IL-1β secretion in J774A.1, BMDMs, and THP-1 macrophages. To examine whether this inflammasome activation was triggered by PPE13 rather than components of M. smegmatis, PPE13 was introduced into the aforementioned macrophages by lentivirus as a delivery vector. Similarly, this led to the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, indicating that PPE13 is a direct activator of NLRP3 cascade. We further demonstrated that the NLRP3 complex activated the inflammasome cascade, and the assembly of this complex was facilitated by PPE13 through interacting with the LRR and NATCH domains of NLRP3. Finally, we found that all PPE13 proteins isolated from M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, and M. marinum can activate NLRP3 inflammasome through binding to NLRP3, which requires C-terminal repetitive MPTR domain of PPE13. Thus, we, for the first time, revealed that PPE13 triggers the inflammasome-response by interacting with the MPTR domain of PPE13 and the LRR and NATCH domains of NLRP3. These findings provide a novel perspective on the function of PPE proteins in the immune system during mycobacteria invasion."

It has been proposed that each TF interacts with a dedicated MED subunit to induce specific transcriptional responses. But are these binary partnerships sufficient to mediate TF functions? We have previously established that the Med1 Mediator subunit serves as a cofactor of GATA TFs in Drosophila, as shown in mammals. Here, we observe mutant phenotype similarities between another subunit, Med19, and the Drosophila GATA TF Pannier (Pnr), suggesting functional interaction. We further show that Med19 physically interacts with the Drosophila GATA TFs, Pnr and Serpent (Srp), in vivo and in vitro through their conserved C-zinc finger domains. Moreover, Med19 loss of function experiments in vivo or in cellulo indicate that it is required for Pnr- and Srp-dependent gene expression, suggesting general GATA cofactor functions. Interestingly, Med19 but not Med1 is critical for the regulation of all tested GATA target genes, implying shared or differential use of MED subunits by GATAs depending on the target gene. Lastly, we show a direct interaction between Med19 and Med1 by GST pulldown experiments indicating privileged contacts between these two subunits of the MED middle module.

We propose several mechanisms to account for the transcriptional regulation of GATA-targeted genes. Transcription, the first stage of gene expression, is a fundamental cellular process governed by the binding of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) at gene enhancers, inducing the recruitment/activation of the general RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) machinery at gene promoters. In eukaryotes, TFs do not bind directly the Pol II enzyme but instead contact a multisubunit complex called Mediator (MED), serving as a physical and functional interface between DNA-bound TFs and PolII (for review see Refs. 1Soutourina J.

Although TF DNA-binding specificity has been largely decoded, how TFs interact with the Mediator complex has been less extensively studied, and it is not clear whether each TF binds a specific MED subunit or whether TF–MED interactions obey more complex rules.

Interestingly, among the five GATA TFs encoded by the Drosophila genome, only Serpent (Srp), is a bona fide hematopoietic GATA factor, whereas Pannier (Pnr) is involved in cardiac development (27Sorrentino R.P.

Different contributions of pannier and wingless to the patterning of the dorsal mesothorax of Drosophila.Development. 1999; 126 (10409499): 3523-3532PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Pnr activates the wingless gene in a strip of cells of the presumptive thorax (31Sato M. Saigo K.

In a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila cultured cells we identified a set of MED subunits as modulators of GATA/Serpent–induced transactivation, among which were Med12, Med13, Med1, and Med19 (32Gobert V. Osman D. Bras S. Augé B. Boube M. Bourbon H.-M. Horn T. Boutros M. Haenlin M. Waltzer L.

This work further showed that Med12 and Med13 subunits are required in vivo for Srp-driven developmental processes, but we were unable to detect direct physical interaction with Srp in vitro, suggesting that GATA/Srp may recruit the Mediator complex by contacting other MED subunits. Indeed, we recently showed that Med1 mediates GATA TFs function in Drosophila (33Immarigeon C. Bernat-Fabre S. Augé B. Faucher C. Gobert V. Haenlin M. Waltzer L. Payet A. Cribbs D.L. Bourbon H.-M.G. Boube M. Drosophila Mediator subunit Med1 is required for GATA-dependent developmental processes: Divergent binding interfaces for conserved coactivator functions.Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 39 (30670567): 1-1810.1128/MCB.00477-18Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Med1 does interact physically with both Pnr and Srp GATA TFs, through their conserved zinc finger region. Furthermore, in vivo experiments showed that Med1 is involved in Srp-driven hematopoiesis and Pnr-driven thorax differentiation and is required for Srp and Pnr target gene expression in the corresponding tissues. These data established that the Med1 GATA cofactor activity is evolutionarily conserved and involves the GATA N- and C-zinc finger domains in both mammals and Drosophila. Nevertheless, we also showed that Drosophila Med1 is not critical for wingless-induced transactivation by Pnr, raising the possibility that other MED subunits could mediate some GATA TFs functions. Here, we reveal that another MED subunit, Med19, also acts as a GATA coactivator. Med19 mutants phenocopy pnr loss-of-function and extinguish the expression of both Pnr target genes achaete and wg, whereas Med1 mutants were previously shown to affect only achaete expression. Using immunoprecipitation, pulldown, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) techniques, we establish that Med19 physically interacts with Pnr in cellulo, in vivo, and in vitro through its C-ZF domain. Med19 also interacts physically with GATA/Srp, suggesting that Med19 acts as a generic GATA cofactor. Moreover, we show that both Med1 and Med19 jointly regulate a series of Srp target genes in Drosophila cultured cells. Finally, in vitro experiments revealed that Med1 and Med19 physically interact through the Med1 domain which is conserved throughout eukaryotes. Taken together, our results show that GATA-driven regulatory functions in Drosophila require two MED complex subunits, Med19 in all tested cases and Med1 in a majority. The evolutionary conservation of Med19 and GATA interacting domains suggests that Med19 may play a conserved GATA cofactor function in mammals. Our whole-genome dsRNA screen in Drosophila cultured cells identified Med19 as one MED subunit capable of modulating Srp TF-induced transactivation ex vivo (32Gobert V. Osman D. Bras S. Augé B. Boube M. Bourbon H.-M. Horn T. Boutros M. Haenlin M. Waltzer L.

To this end, we generated Med19 mutant clones in the larval wing imaginal disc, which gives rise to adult thoracic structures whose proper development depends on GATA/Pnr activity. Flies bearing Med19- clones displayed specific phenotypes in the thorax, including thoracic cleft and loss of DC mechanosensory macrochaetes (Fig. 1, A and D), typical of pnr loss-of-function (29Ramain P.

We observed similar phenotypes upon expression of RNAi against Med19 in the apterous (ap) domain encompassing all the presumptive notum (Fig. S1, A and B). To investigate the functional relationship between Med19 and Pnr, we first examined pnr gene expression in Med19-deficient wing discs by FISH and observed that pnr is expressed in Med19-depleted wing discs (Fig. S1, C–F). Thus, Med19 mutant phenotypes cannot be explained by a loss of pnr expression. To further analyze the functional relationship between Med19 and Pnr, we then examined GATA/Pnr TF activity in Med19 loss-of-function clones by analyzing the expression of known Pnr target genes. Compared with WT cells shown in Fig. 1, B–C′′, we observed that both wingless (wg) and achaete (ac) expression was cell autonomously lost in Med19−/− cells (Fig. 1, E–F′′), indicating that Med19 is required for the expression of both Pnr target genes. Note that ac expression has been visualized by a DC-ac-lacZ reporter gene which is directly activated upon Pnr binding to the DC ac enhancer (28García-García M.J. Ramain P. Simpson P. Modolell J. Different contributions of pannier and wingless to the patterning of the dorsal mesothorax of Drosophila.Development. 1999; 126 (10409499): 3523-3532PubMed Google Scholar). These data show that Med19 is cell autonomously required for Pnr activity but not for Pnr expression, suggesting that it could act as a GATA/Pnr cofactor. We investigated whether GATA/Pnr transcription factor and Med19 physically interact by using three independent experimental approaches: Co-immunoprecipitation from cultured cells, in vitro pulldown and in vivo Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) interaction tests. We first tested whether Pnr-MED complexes actually form within Drosophila cells by performing co-immunoprecipitations experiments on total protein extracts from cultured cells expressing a functional Myc-tagged Pnr form. We observed that Pnr co-precipitated with endogenous Drosophila Med19 (Fig. 2A). In the reverse experiment, endogenous Med19 protein co-precipitated with Myc-tagged Pnr protein (Fig. 2B). These data provide complementary evidence for the formation of Med19-GATA complexes in Drosophila cells. To investigate whether Med19–Pnr interaction is direct, we tested the ability of Med19 and Pnr proteins to bind each other physically in vitro through pulldown assays with GSH S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. In vitro–produced Med19 readily bound full-length recombinant GST-Pnr (Fig. 2C), and vice versa (Fig. 2D). These results show that Med19 and Pnr can interact physically in the absence of any other Drosophila MED subunits. We then used BiFC (16Boube M. Hudry B. Immarigeon C. Carrier Y. Bernat-Fabre S.

Based on fusing N- and C-terminal portions (VN and VC) of the GFP-variant Venus protein with two proteins of interest respectively, this technique allows the reconstitution of a fluorescent Venus protein if the two candidate proteins are close enough within the cell. We used the dppGAL4 driver (Gal4/UAS system (35Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Targeted gene expression as a means of altering cell fates and generating dominant phenotypes.Development. 1993; 118 (8223268): 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) to co-express VN-Pnr with either Med19-VC or another MED subunit fusion, CycC-VC, along the antero/posterior frontier of the wing imaginal disc (Fig. 2, E and F). The co-expression of VN-Pnr and Med19-VC resulted in a clear BiFC signal, whereas the control VN-Pnr/CycC-VC combination gave a very low signal (Fig. 2, E′ and F′), even though CycC-VC and Med19-VC proteins were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 2, E and F). These data indicate that the BiFC technique discriminates specific interactions between different subunits within the MED complex and that Med19 and Pnr are in close proximity in the nucleus of living cells. Of note, the BiFC signal was observed in the entire dppGAL4 expression domain, including the wing pouch where endogenous GATA/Pnr is not expressed, showing that the Pnr-Med19 interaction can occur at ectopic locations independently of tissue-specific Pnr partners, thus providing further support for a direct molecular interaction in vivo. Collectively, in cellulo, in vitro, and in vivo data support a direct physical interaction between the GATA/Pnr transcription factor and the Med19 Mediator subunit. Together with our previous results (33Immarigeon C. Bernat-Fabre S. Augé B. Faucher C. Gobert V. Haenlin M. Waltzer L. Payet A. Cribbs D.L. Bourbon H.-M.G. Boube M. Drosophila Mediator subunit Med1 is required for GATA-dependent developmental processes: Divergent binding interfaces for conserved coactivator functions.Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 39 (30670567): 1-1810.1128/MCB.00477-18Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar), these data suggest that the Pnr TF can interact with the entire MED complex via a direct molecular contact with the Med19 subunit in addition to or in place of the Med1 subunit. We previously showed that Med1 directly interacts with the dual zinc finger domains of Pnr (33Immarigeon C. Bernat-Fabre S. Augé B. Faucher C. Gobert V. Haenlin M. Waltzer L. Payet A. Cribbs D.L. Bourbon H.-M.G. Boube M. Drosophila Mediator subunit Med1 is required for GATA-dependent developmental processes: Divergent binding interfaces for conserved coactivator functions.Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 39 (30670567): 1-1810.1128/MCB.00477-18Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to characterize interacting domains within Pnr and Med19 to determine whether Med19 and Med1 interact with the same Pnr domain. We first looked for the Med19-interacting domain(s) within the GATA/Pnr protein using full-length GST-Med19 as a bait (Fig. 3A). Pnr was split into three parts: The poorly evolutionarily conserved N-terminal region (amino acids (aa) 1–137), the strongly conserved central region spanning the two zinc fingers, N- and C-ZF, and the divergent C-terminal region containing two amphipathic α helices, H1 and H2. Only the ZF-containing region (aa 130–278) displayed significant binding. When cutting full-length Pnr into two halves separating the two zinc finger domains, binding was observed only with the C-ZF–containing part (Fig. 3A), suggesting that C-ZF mediates binding of Pnr to Med19. Consistently, the ability of the N-ZF–containing half of Pnr to bind Med19 was recovered when we added back the C-ZF proper (aa 220–253) containing the four zinc-chelating cysteines forming the finger structure. Interestingly, binding was increased when the C-ZF proper was extended by its neighboring C-terminal 25 amino acids (basic tail motif, aa 253–278) (Fig. 3B). Sequence alignment of Drosophila and mammalian GATAs indicates that the C-ZF basic tail has been strongly conserved during evolution, especially at positions shown to participate in DNA binding (open circles in Fig. 3B) (36Ghirlando R. Trainor C.D. Determinants of GATA-1 binding to DNA: The role of non-finger residues.J. Biol.

Together, these experiments indicate that the entire Pnr C-ZF domain, zinc-finger proper and adjacent basic tail, is necessary for optimal Med19 binding. In the reciprocal experiment, we identified the GATA/Pnr interacting domain within Med19.

To investigate which protein domain(s) is (are) required for Pnr binding, we tested the ability of in vitro translated Pnr1–291 to bind a series of GST-Med19 truncated forms (Fig. 3, C–G). A Med19 protein deleted for its evolutionarily conserved CORE domain (ΔCORE) still bound Pnr1–291 (Fig. 3D). Binding was also retained after truncating both C-terminal and HIM domains but was abolished if the deletion included the C-terminal end of the CORE domain (aa 126–165) (Fig. 3E).

Our objective was to ablate proliferating osteoblast lineage cells in order to investigate the importance of these cells as a source for loading-induced bone formation. We utilized 3.6Col1a1-tk mice in which replicating osteoblast lineage cells can be ablated in an inducible manner using ganciclovir (GCV). Male and female mice were aged to 5- and 12-months and subjected to 5 days of tibial compression. Experimental mice were tk-positive, treated with GCV; control mice were either tk-negative treated with GCV, or tk-positive treated with PBS. We confirmed that experimental mice had a decrease in tk-positive cells that arose from proliferation. Next, we assessed bone formation after loading to low (7N) and high (11N) forces and observed that periosteal bone formation rate in experimental mice was reduced by approximately 70% for both forces. Remarkably, woven bone formation induced by high-force loading was blocked in experimental mice. Loading-induced lamellar bone formation was diminished but not prevented in experimental mice. We conclude that osteoblast proliferation induced by mechanical loading is a critical source of bone forming osteoblasts for maximal lamellar formation and is essential for woven bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W3046609928,"Background An integrated chronic disease management (ICDM) model was introduced by the National Department of Health in South Africa to tackle the dual burden of HIV/AIDS and non-communicable diseases. One of the aims of the ICDM model is to reduce HIV-related stigma. This paper describes the viewpoints of service users and providers on HIV stigma in an ICDM model in rural South Africa. Materials and methods A content analysis of HIV stigmatisation in seven primary health care (PHC) facilities and their catchment communities was conducted in 2013 in the rural Agincourt sub-district, South Africa. Eight Focus Group Discussions were used to obtain data from 61 purposively selected participants who were 18 years and above. Seven In-Depth Interviews were conducted with the nurses-in-charge of the facilities. The transcripts were inductively analysed using MAXQDA 2018 qualitative software. Results The emerging themes were HIV stigma, HIV testing and reproductive health-related concerns. Both service providers and users perceived implementation of the ICDM model may have led to reduced HIV stigma in the facilities. On the other hand, service users and providers thought HIV stigma increased in the communities because community members thought that home-based carers visited the homes of People living with HIV. Service users thought that routine HIV testing, intended for pregnant women, was linked with unwanted pregnancies among adolescents who wanted to use contraceptives but refused to take an HIV test as a precondition for receiving contraceptives. Conclusions Although the ICDM model was perceived to have contributed to reducing HIV stigma in the health facilities, it was linked with stigma in the communities. This has implications for practice in the community component of the ICDM model in the study setting and elsewhere in South Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3046221565,"Targeted drug delivery to the endothelium has the potential to generate localized therapeutic effects at the blood-tissue interface. For some therapeutic cargoes, it is essential to maintain contact with the bloodstream to exert protective effects. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of endothelial surface-targeted affinity ligands and biotherapeutic cargo remain a largely unexplored area, despite obvious translational implications for this strategy. To bridge this gap, we site-specifically radiolabeled mono- (scFv) and bivalent (mAb) affinity ligands specific for the endothelial cell adhesion molecules, PECAM-1 (CD31) and ICAM-1 (CD54). Radiotracing revealed similar lung biodistribution at 30 minutes post-injection (79.3% ± 4.2% vs 80.4% ± 10.6% ID/g for αICAM and 58.9% ± 3.6% ID/g vs. 47.7% ± 5.8% ID/g for αPECAM mAb vs. scFv), but marked differences in organ residence time, with antibodies demonstrating an order of magnitude greater area under the lung concentration vs. time curve (AUCinf 1698 ± 352 vs. 53.3 ± 7.9 ID/g*hrs for αICAM and 1023 ± 507 vs. 114 ± 37 ID/g*hrs for αPECAM mAb vs scFv). A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model, fit to and validated using these data, indicated contributions from both superior binding characteristics and prolonged circulation time supporting multiple binding-detachment cycles. We tested the ability of each affinity ligand to deliver a prototypical surface cargo, thrombomodulin (TM), using one-to-one protein conjugates. Bivalent mAb-TM was superior to monovalent scFv-TM in both pulmonary targeting and lung residence time (AUCinf 141 ± 3.2 vs 12.4 ± 4.2 ID/g*hrs for ICAM and 188 ± 90 vs 34.7 ± 19.9 ID/g*hrs for PECAM), despite having similar blood PK, indicating that binding strength is more important parameter than the kinetics of binding. To maximize bivalent target engagement, we synthesized an oriented, end-to-end anti-ICAM mAb-TM conjugate and found that this therapeutic had the best lung residence time (AUCinf 253 ± 18 ID/g*hrs) of all TM modalities. These observations have implications not only for the delivery of TM, but also potentially all therapeutics targeted to the endothelial surface."
https://openalex.org/W3046361568,"Lung cancer is one of most common malignancies worldwide. We have previously identified retinoic acid-induced gene G (Rig-G) as a tumor suppressor in not only acute promyelocytic leukemia, but also in other solid tumors. However, the clinical significance of Rig-G and the underlying mechanism(s) for its biological function in lung cancer remain largely unexplored. Herein, we first compared the expression of Rig-G between lung cancer (n = 138) and normal tissues (n = 23), from public-available data sets and our patient cohort. We further analyzed the correlation of Rig-G expression with key clinico-pathological features and survival outcomes in a multi-site clinical cohort of 300 lung cancer patients. Functional studies for Rig-G were performed in cell lines, and an animal model to support clinical findings. We found that Rig-G was frequently downregulated in lung cancer tissues and cell lines, and correlated with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients. Overexpression of Rig-G led to significantly reduced cell growth and suppressed migration in A549 and NCI-H1944 cells, accompanied by reduced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Likewise, restoration of Rig-G in Lewis lung carcinoma cells permitted development of fewer cancer metastases versus controls in an animal model. Gene expression profiling results identified p53 pathway as a key downstream target of Rig-G, and p53 inhibition by pifithrin-α caused abrogation of tumor-suppressive effects of Rig-G in lung cancer. In conclusion, we, for the first time, have identified Rig-G as a novel and important tumor suppressor, which may serve as a potential therapeutic target for restoring p53 expression in lung cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3046833531,"Mice deficient in intestinal epithelial TLR9 develop small intestinal Paneth cell hyperplasia and higher Paneth cell IL-17A levels. Since small intestinal Paneth cells and IL-17A play critical roles in hepatic ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury, we tested whether mice lacking intestinal TLR9 have increased hepatic IR injury. Mice lacking intestinal TLR9 had profoundly increased liver injury after hepatic IR compared to WT mice with exacerbated hepatocyte necrosis, apoptosis, neutrophil infiltration, and inflammatory cytokine generation. Moreover, we observed increased small intestinal inflammation and apoptosis after hepatic IR in intestinal TLR9 deficient mice. As a potential explanation for increased hepatic IR injury, fecal short-chain fatty acids butyrate and propionate levels were lower in intestinal TLR9 deficient mice. Suggesting a potential therapy for hepatic IR, exogenous administration of butyrate or propionate protected against hepatic IR injury in intestinal TLR9 deficient mice. Mechanistically, butyrate induced small intestinal IL-10 expression and downregulated the claudin-2 expression. Finally, IL-10 neutralization abolished the protective effects of butyrate against hepatic IR injury. Our studies show intestinal TLR9 deficiency results in exacerbated hepatic IR injury with increased small intestinal apoptosis and inflammation. Furthermore, short-chain fatty acids butyrate and propionate protect against hepatic IR injury and intestinal apoptosis/inflammation in intestinal TLR9 deficient mice."
https://openalex.org/W3047555958,"Mechanical stimulations can prevent bone loss, but their effects on the tumor-invaded bone or solid tumors are elusive. Here, we evaluated the effect of knee loading, dynamic loads applied to the knee, on metastasized bone and mammary tumors. In a mouse model, tumor cells were inoculated to the mammary fat pad or the proximal tibia. Daily knee loading was then applied and metabolic changes were monitored mainly through urine. Urine samples were also collected from human subjects before and after step aerobics. The result showed that knee loading inhibited tumor progression in the loaded tibia. Notably, it also reduced remotely the growth of mammary tumors. In the urine, an altered level of cholesterol was observed with an increase in calcitriol, which is synthesized from a cholesterol derivative. In urinary proteins, knee loading in mice and step aerobics in humans markedly reduced WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 1, WISP1, which leads to poor survival among patients with breast cancer. In the ex vivo breast cancer tissue assay, WISP1 promoted the growth of cancer fragments and upregulated tumor-promoting genes, such as Runx2, MMP9, and Snail. Collectively, the present preclinical and human study demonstrated that mechanical stimulations, such as knee loading and step aerobics, altered urinary metabolism and downregulated WISP1. The study supports the benefit of mechanical stimulations for locally and remotely suppressing tumor progression. It also indicated the role of WISP1 downregulation as a potential mechanism of loading-driven tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W3046260008,"The rabbit retinal vein occlusion (RVO) model is an experimental system that mimics retinal ischemic diseases in humans. The rabbit RVO model is widely used to assess the therapeutic efficacy of various experimental surgical procedures. In the present study, we measured temporal retinal expression of Vegfa, which is known as an ischemic response gene, in rabbit RVO. This analysis revealed that the retinal Vegfa transcriptional response began 7 days after generation of RVO, rather than immediately after induction of ischemia. Next, in order to analyze ischemia-induced changes in gene expression profiles, we performed microarray analysis of day 7 RVO retina versus control retina. The angiogenic regulators Dcn and Mmp1 and pro-inflammatory factors Mmp12 and Cxcl13 were significantly upregulated in RVO retinas. Further, we suggest that epigenetic regulation via the REST/cofactor-complex could contribute to RVO pathology. Among human homologous genes in rabbits, genes associated with hypoxia, angiogenesis, and inflammation were significantly upregulated in RVO retinas. Components of the Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways, which play regulatory roles in angiogenesis and inflammation, were significantly upregulated in RVO, and the expression levels of downstream factors, such as the transcription factor AP-1 and chemokines, were increased. Further, connectivity map analyses suggested that inhibitors of the NF-κB pathway are potential therapeutic agents for retinal ischemic disease. The present study revealed new insights into the pathology of retinal ischemia using the rabbit RVO model, which accurately recapitulates human disease."
https://openalex.org/W3046667782,"Class Ia phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) are critical mediators of insulin and growth factor action. We have demonstrated that the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K modulates the unfolded protein response (UPR) by interacting with and regulating the nuclear translocation of XBP-1s, a transcription factor essential for the UPR. We now show that PI3K activity is required for full activation of the UPR. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K in cells blunts the ER stress-dependent phosphorylation of IRE1α and PERK, decreases induction of ATF4, CHOP, and XBP-1 and upregulates UPR target genes. Cells expressing a human p85α mutant (R649W) previously shown to inhibit PI3K, exhibit decreased activation of IRE1α and PERK and reduced induction of CHOP and ATF4. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K, overexpression of a mutant of p85α that lacks the ability to interact with the p110α catalytic subunit (∆p85α) or expression of mutant p85α (R649W) in vivo, decreased UPR-dependent induction of ER stress response genes. Acute tunicamycin treatment of R649W+/- mice revealed reduced induction of UPR target genes in adipose tissue, whereas chronic tunicamycin exposure caused sustained increases in UPR target genes in adipose tissue. Finally, R649W+/- cells exhibited a dramatic resistance to ER stress-dependent apoptosis. These data suggest that PI3K pathway dysfunction causes ER stress that may drive the pathogenesis of several diseases including Type 2 diabetes and various cancers."

ATP binding to BchL drives the assembly of the BchL and BchNB proteins and the transient assembly of this complex promotes electron transfer (ET) (8Fujita Y. Bauer C.E.

The electron is transferred from the [4Fe-4S] cluster of BchL, to the [4Fe-4S] cluster of one half of BchNB and finally to the C17=C18 double bond of Pchlide. Two rounds of electron and proton transfer are required to reduce Pchlide to Chlide (Fig. 1b). In DPOR, one proton required for reduction originates intrinsically from within the C17 propionate of Pchlide, and the second proton is donated in trans from an Asp-274 of the opposing BchB subunit (Fig. 1c) (11Bröcker M.J.

These reductive steps fine-tune the spectral and reactive properties of bacteriochlorophyll to be optimally suited for photosynthesis. An overarching question about these enzymes is centered on their conserved architectural complexity: Why are these enzymes assembled as two functional halves, and how do they cooperatively function during substrate reduction? Because two rounds of ET (per half) are required for substrate reduction, multiple BchL binding and dissociation cycles occur at each BchNB half. The two BchL binding interfaces on BchNB are situated ∼100 Å apart (4Moser J. Lange C. Krausze J. Rebelein J. Schubert W.D. Ribbe M.W. Heinz D.W. Jahn D. Structure of ADP-aluminium fluoride-stabilized protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2013; 110 (23341615): 2094-209810.1073/pnas.1218303110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). If their binding events are coordinated, long-range, intersubunit allosteric communication is necessary. Here, we explored such fundamental mechanistic questions using DPOR components from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. We show that the two halves indeed communicate, and that perturbation of substrate reduction activity at one-half abolishes ET at the other, thus stalling the entire DPOR complex. The findings explain key functional advantages of the oligomeric architecture found in many enzymes that catalyze electron transfer reactions. To test the functional importance of the α2β2 architecture, we first generated half-reactive versions of DPOR and tested overall Pchlide reduction activity. BchN and BchB are expressed as separate open reading frames and form a tetramer. To generate a half-reactive BchNB complex, we used a dual-affinity tag approach where two BchB open reading frames were generated, coding for either a poly-histidine or Strep-affinity tag on the N terminus. N-terminal positioning of either affinity tag does not affect Pchlide reduction activity, as their rates of Pchlide reduction are similar (Fig. 2, a and b). Reduction of Pchlide to Chlide results in a spectral shift with appearance of an absorption maximum at 666 nm. We note that placing affinity tags on the C terminus of BchB perturbs Pchlide reduction activity (data not shown). These tagged BchB constructs were co-expressed along with an untagged version of the BchN polypeptide. This strategy generated an ensemble of BchNB tetramers carrying either two poly-histidine–tagged BchB, two Strep-tagged BchB, or one of each in the context of a BchNB tetramer (Fig. 2c). This dual-tagged approach enabled us to sequentially fractionate the mixed population of BchNB proteins over Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and Strep-Tactin agarose resins. The final purified BchNB complex had one BchB subunit carrying a poly-histidine tag and the other a Strep-tag (Fig. 2e). The presence of the appropriate affinity tags over the sequential purification steps were further confirmed by Western blotting using anti-His and anti-Strep antibodies (Fig. 2, g and i and Fig. S1). To generate a half-active BchNB complex, we introduced an Asp-274 to Ala substitution only in the BchB subunit carrying the poly-histidine tag. Asp-274 acts as one of the necessary proton donors for Pchlide reduction, the other coming from the Pchlide itself (Fig. 1c). Asp-274 interacts with the Pchlide molecule and substitution of Asp-274 to Ala has been shown to perturb substrate reduction in DPOR (3Muraki N. Nomata J. Ebata K. Mizoguchi T. Shiba T. Tamiaki H. Kurisu G. Fujita Y. X-ray crystal structure of the light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase.Nature. 2010; 465 (20400946): 110-11410.1038/nature08950Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). When expressed along with WT BchN and WT Strep-tag BchB, a mixture of BchB complexes were generated (Fig. 2d) carrying either entirely WT BchNB (strep-B:[BchN]2:strep-B); variant BchNB (his-BD274A:[BchN]2:his-BD274A); or half-active BchNB (his-BD274A:[BchN]2:strep-B). Using the dual-affinity purification strategy we were able to isolate the half-reactive BchNB (his-BD274A:[BchN]2:strep-B) (Fig. 2f) and confirmed the presence of both affinity tags by Western blotting using the above-described antibodies (Fig. 2, h and j and Fig. S1). We next monitored Pchlide reduction activity of the dual-tagged WT and half-active BchNB complexes by mixing them with Pchlide, BchL, and ATP. Whereas WT BchNB carrying either affinity tag reduces Pchlide, the half-active BchNB is defective for Pchlide reduction (Fig. 2, a and b). These data show that two functional halves in the context of the α2β2 BchNB tetramer are required for substrate reduction. The predicted sequence of Pchlide-reduction events in DPOR involve binding of Pchlide to BchNB, the binding of BchL to BchNB, and the respective electron transfer events. In addition, ATP binding and hydrolysis within the BchL complex are also elemental steps in substrate reduction (15Nomata J. Kondo T. Itoh S. Fujita Y. Nicotinamide is a specific inhibitor of dark-operative protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase, a nitrogenase-like enzyme, from Rhodobacter capsulatus.FEBS Lett. 2013; 587 (23954297): 3142-314710.1016/j.febslet.2013.07.054Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 16Nomata J.

Because the half-active BchNB proteins were defective for overall Pchlide reduction, we next sought to identify where the enzyme stalled in the catalytic cycle. Thus, we focused on measuring the electronic properties of the [4Fe-4S] clusters of BchNB using EPR spectroscopy. Unfortunately, the yields of the half-active BchNB protein were minimal after the dual-affinity purification and hence precluded us from performing detailed EPR studies. Hence, we investigated the spectral properties of WT and variant (BchNBD274A) DPOR complexes to capture the steps in the electron transfer cycle. The Asp-274 residue in BchB is unique in its role as a proton donor to Pchlide (3Muraki N. Nomata J. Ebata K. Mizoguchi T. Shiba T. Tamiaki H. Kurisu G. Fujita Y.

Structurally, it functions in trans, where Asp-274 from one half of the BchNB tetramer serves as the proton donor to the Pchlide molecule bound to the active site of the opposing half BchNB (Fig. 1c) (3Muraki N. Nomata J. Ebata K. Mizoguchi T. Shiba T. Tamiaki H. Kurisu G. Fujita Y.

Thus, this residue probably serves as a key communication element between the two halves of the α2β2 BchNB tetramer. The [4Fe-4S] cluster of BchNB is ligated by three Cys residues from BchN (Cys-29, Cys-54 and Cys-115) and one Asp residue from BchB (Asp-36; R. sphaeroides numbering) (Fig. 3a). The EPR spectral properties of the BchNB [4Fe-4S] cluster have not been thoroughly characterized, but a small EPR signal has been observed and described by an S = 3/2 spin state (17Kondo T. Nomata J. Fujita Y. Itoh S.

We measured the EPR spectra of BchNB alone, in complex with its substrate (Pchlide), and upon addition of BchL (± ATP). As described before (17Kondo T. Nomata J. Fujita Y. Itoh S. EPR study of 1Asp-3Cys ligated 4Fe-4S iron-sulfur cluster in NB-protein (BchN-BchB) of a dark-operative protochlorophyllide reductase complex.FEBS Lett. 2011; 585 (21126521): 214-21810.1016/j.febslet.2010.11.044Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the [4Fe-4S] cluster of BchNB is EPR silent (Fig. 3b, red trace). In comparison, the [4Fe-4S] cluster of BchL produces a large signal in the ∼350 mT range as reported previously (Fig. 3b, gray trace) (18Nomata J. Kitashima M. Inoue K. Fujita Y. Nitrogenase Fe protein-like Fe-S cluster is conserved in L-protein (BchL) of dark-operative protochlorophyllide reductase from Rhodobacter capsulatus.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580 (17064695): 6151-615410.1016/j.febslet.2006.10.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Even at higher BchNB concentrations (90 μm tetramer) no EPR signature is observed for the [4Fe-4S] cluster of BchNB (Fig. 3c, red trace). When Pchlide is added to BchNB, we do not observe a change in signal either (Fig. 3c, blue trace). When BchNB, BchL, and Pchlide are mixed together in the absence of ATP, the signal for the [4Fe-4S] cluster for BchL is observed, but no new signals for BchNB are observed (Fig. 3c, green trace). This finding is not surprising as ATP binding to BchL is required to drive complex formation between BchNB and BchL. When we introduce BchL and ATP to the reaction containing BchNB in the absence of Pchlide, a peak appears at ∼130 mT (Fig. 3, b and c, black traces), which resembles the EPR spectra previously reported (17Kondo T. Nomata J. Fujita Y. Itoh S. EPR study of 1Asp-3Cys ligated 4Fe-4S iron-sulfur cluster in NB-protein (BchN-BchB) of a dark-operative protochlorophyllide reductase complex.FEBS Lett. 2011; 585 (21126521): 214-21810.1016/j.febslet.2010.11.044Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This suggests that ATP-bound BchL forms a complex with BchNB in the absence of Pchlide and donates an electron to the [4Fe-4S] cluster of BchNB. When the entire reaction is reconstituted with BchL, BchNB, Pchlide, and ATP, the steady-state reaction results in the presence of the ∼130 mT peak (Fig. 3c, orange trace). Previous models for DPOR suggest that the [4Fe-4S] cluster of BchNB exists in an oxidized state. The mechanism of action includes BchNB binding to Pchlide, followed by complex formation with BchL, and the transfer of the first electron from BchL to BchNB and then onto Pchlide. In our experiments, because ATP-bound BchL can reduce BchNB in the absence of Pchlide, we suggest an alternate possibility where BchNB could be pre-reduced in the cell followed by Pchlide binding, and the subsequent transfer of the first electron to Pchlide. This model is congruent with the deficit spending mechanism proposed for nitrogenase (19Danyal K. Dean D.R. Hoffman B.M. Seefeldt L.C. Electron transfer within nitrogenase: Evidence for a deficit-spending mechanism.Biochemistry. 2011; 50 (21939270): 9255-926310.1021/bi201003aCrossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), wherein the first electron donation to substrate from the pre-reduced MoFe protein is accomplished before ATP-dependent reduction from the Fe-protein (electron donor component). We next measured the kinetics of substrate reduction in DPOR by following the appearance of the absorbance signal at 666 nm (Fig. 4a), and the appearance of the ∼130 mT EPR signal (Fig. 4b). Reduction reactions containing BchL, BchNB, and Pchlide were initiated by adding ATP and quenched samples were assessed for electron transfer (EPR) and Pchlide formation (absorbance). The appearance of the EPR signal correlates with the formation of Chlide, albeit at a slower rate (Fig. 4c), suggesting that (a) the EPR signal represents electron transfer to the [4Fe-4S] cluster of BchNB. (b) Because rate of appearance of the EPR spectra lag behind the Chlide formation (absorbance signal), the EPR signal likely reflects the re-reduced cluster on BchNB. Thus, during the reaction, the BchNB cluster is always in a reduced state and primed to donate an electron to Pchlide during the next substrate reduction cycle, as would be expected in the deficit spending model. This agrees with reduction of the BchNB by BchL (+ATP) in the absence of Pchlide (Fig. 3c). Establishment of the order of Pchlide binding to BchNB is necessary to understand the mechanism of ET. From the half-reactive BchNB experiments we deciphered that multiple rounds of ET do not occur when one or both BchNB halves carry a substitution in the proton donor residue, Asp-274. Thus, we proposed that a stalled BchNB intermediate could be identified through EPR for the BchNBD274A complex. Interestingly, the EPR signature of BchNBD274A (in the absence of Pchlide, BchL, or ATP) showed the presence of a peak at ∼130 mT, indicative of the presence of a reduced [4Fe-4S] cluster (Fig. 5a, orange trace). This is in stark contrast to WT BchNB that is EPR silent (Fig. 5a, red trace). This suggests that the substitution at Asp-274 influences the electronic properties of the [4Fe-4S] cluster either by physically promoting structural changes in the protein that make the cluster more accessible to the reductant (dithionite) in the reactions, or by propagating/perturbing a network of amino acid interactions that change the reduction potential of the cluster, making it EPR visible. Analysis of the crystal structures of the Pchlide-free (20Bröcker M.J. Schomburg S. Heinz D.W. Jahn D. Schubert W.D. Moser J. Crystal structure of the nitrogenase-like dark operative protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase catalytic complex (ChlN/ChlB)2.J. Biol.

Shiba T. Tamiaki H. Kurisu G. Fujita Y. X-ray crystal structure of the light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase.Nature. 2010; 465 (20400946): 110-11410.1038/nature08950Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) crystal structures show large-scale conformational changes that might likely explain this difference (Fig. S2). The collapse of the binding pocket in WT BchNB, in the absence of Pchlide, likely serves as a protective mechanism for the [4Fe-4S] cluster as the cluster is not reduced when recombinantly purified. Binding of Pchlide or BchL (or both) likely triggers the necessary conformational changes and primes the [4Fe-4S] cluster for accepting electrons. BchNB can bind to Pchlide in the absence of BchL; similarly, BchL can bind to BchNB in the absence of Pchlide and donate an electron in the presence of ATP (Fig. 5b, black trace). Thus, Pchlide or BchL binding to BchNB are likely not mutually exclusive events and a specific order of binding may not dictate overall substrate reduction activity. Because BchNBD274A is defective for Pchlide reduction but is preloaded with electrons, we next tested whether ET occurs. When incubated with Pchlide, the EPR spectra for the [4Fe-4S] cluster of BchNBD274A disappears (Fig. 5a, yellow trace). Thus, BchNBD274A donates its preloaded electrons to Pchlide. The complete disappearance of the EPR signal implies that the first ET event occurs in both halves. Interestingly, when BchNBD274A is incubated with BchL, Pchlide, and ATP, the EPR signal at ∼130 mT is restored (Fig. 5b, blue trace). However, the intensity of the EPR peak is almost exactly 50% of the amplitude of the signal intensity observed for WT BchNB under similar conditions (Fig. 5c). This is indicative of a stalled intermediate where re-reduction of only one of the two [4Fe-4S] clusters of BchNB has occurred. The data also affirm our interpretation that the EPR signal at ∼130 mT for WT BchNB (and the BchNBD274A without Pchlide) reflects two total electrons per tetramer, one per BchNB half. These findings further support the sequential ET model in DPOR where events in one half control activity in the other. If the two halves were to act independently, (a) the half-reactive DPOR complex should have been able to retain partial Pchlide reduction activity, but this is not the case (Fig. 2b). (b) Similarly, in the EPR analysis, for an independent model, the amplitude of the spectra for BchNBD274A should have been either around 100 or 0% of WT BchNB, but this again is not the case (Fig. 5c). Thus, similar to our observations for nitrogenase (21Danyal K. Shaw S. Page T.R. Duval S. Horitani M. Marts A.R. Lukoyanov D. Dean D.R. Raugei S. Hoffman B.M. Seefeldt L.C. Antony E. Negative cooperativity in the nitrogenase Fe protein electron delivery cycle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113 (27698129): E5783-E579110.1073/pnas.1613089113Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we propose that an intrinsic functional asymmetry exists in DPOR. Because the two halves in the BchNB complex appear to transfer electrons to Pchlide in a sequential manner, we next tested how asymmetry is established. We explored two potential models: 1) BchNB, when synthesized, is intrinsically endowed with asymmetric Pchlide binding properties through differences in active-site conformations between the two halves. 2) Alternatively, Pchlide binding to either active site is stochastic and changes in the active site upon Pchlide binding then sets asymmetry and allosterically controls Pchlide binding to the other half. To test these models, we directly monitored Pchlide binding by capturing the changes in fluorescence upon binding to BchNB. A scan of the fluorescence properties of Pchlide shows an excitation and emission maxima at 440 and 636 nm, respectively (Fig. S3). Based on the spectral features, we excited a sample of Pchlide at 440 nm and measured the change in fluorescence in the absence and presence of BchNB (Fig. 6a). When BchNB is added to the reaction, the fluorescence emission of Pchlide increases ∼700-fold (Fig. 6a). The utility of Pchlide fluorescence to investigate its binding to other proteins has been controversial. One such study using protochlorophyllide reductase showed no significant changes in Pchlide fluorescence upon binding to Pchlide, as nonspecific binding to BSA also generated similar changes in fluorescence (22Heyes D.J. Ruban A.V. Wilks H.M. Hunter C.N. Enzymology below 200 K: The kinetics and thermodynamics of the photochemistry catalyzed by protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99 (12177453): 11145-1115010.1073/pnas.182274199Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, such changes in Pchlide fluorescence were ascribed to nonspecific solution partition effects. This is not the case for Pchlide binding to the BchNB complex. Under our reaction conditions, BSA does not produce a change in Pchlide fluorescence (Fig. 6a, insert). Thus, for BchNB, changes in Pchlide fluorescence are an excellent measure of binding. Because the fluorescence signal arises from Pchlide, we performed binding experiments with a fixed concentration of Pchlide and titrated in increasing concentrations of the BchNB tetramer (Fig. 6b). An increase in Pchlide fluorescence is observed as a function of BchNB concentration (Fig. 6b). The signal plateaus when a stoichiometric amount of BchNB is present to bind all the Pchlide molecules in the reaction. Curiously, when an excess of BchNB is added to the reaction the fluorescence does not plateau. Instead, a drop in the Pchlide fluorescence is observed (Fig. 6b). As the concentration of BchNB is increased in the reaction, the equilibrium likely shifts from a 2-Pchlide–bound BchNB complex (higher fluorescence) to a 1-Pchlide–bound complex (lower fluorescence).

Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), which acts as the ATP subunit of mammalian SWI-SNF-related chromatin remodeling complexes, is involved in human acute myeloid leukemia and highly expresses in short-term HSPCs. But its role and regulatory mechanism for HSPC development have not yet been well established. Here, we generated a brg1 knockout zebrafish model using TALEN technology. We found that in brg1-/- embryo, the primitive hematopoiesis remained well, while definitive hematopoiesis formation was significantly impaired. The number of hemogenic endothelial cells was decreased, further affecting definitive hematopoiesis with reduced myeloid and lymphoid cells. During embryogenesis, the nitric oxide (NO) microenvironment in brg1-/- embryo was seriously damaged and the reduction of HSPCs could be partially rescued by a NO donor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that BRG1 could bind to the promoter of KLF2 and trigger its transcriptional activity of NO synthase. Our findings show that Brg1 promotes klf2a expression in hemogenic endothelium and highlight a novel mechanism for HSPC formation and maintenance."

In two Internet-based vignette experiments, we tested whether juvenile sentencing recommendations among U.S. adults are responsive to variation in the salience of the taxpayer costs and public safety benefits of incarceration. Using a 2 Cost (present vs. absent) x 2 Benefit (present vs. absent) factorial design, Experiment 1 (N = 234) found that exposure to information about the direct costs of incarcerating the juvenile offender reduced sentencing recommendations by about 28%, but exposure to the public safety benefits had no effect on sentences. Experiment 2 (N = 301) manipulated cost-benefit salience by asking participants to generate their own list of costs of incarceration, benefits of incarceration, or an affectively neutral, unrelated word list. Results revealed a similar selective effect whereby sentencing recommendations were reduced in the cost condition relative to the benefits and control conditions, but sentences in the benefit condition did not differ from the control. This combined pattern suggests that laypeople selectively neglect to factor cost considerations into these judgments, thereby inflating their support for punishment, unless those costs are made salient. These findings contribute to the debate on transparency in sentencing."

Contrast administration is needed to accurately assess the arteries. On non-contrast computed tomography, arteries are hardly distinguishable from the brain tissue, therefore, radiologists do not consider this imaging modality appropriate for the evaluation of vascular pathologies. There are known contraindications to administering iodinated contrast media, and in these cases, the patient has to undergo another examination to visualize cerebral arteries, such as magnetic resonance angiography. Deep learning for image segmentation has proven to perform well on medical data for a variety of tasks. The aim of this research was to apply deep learning methods to segment cerebral arteries on non-contrast computed tomography scans and consequently, generate angiographies without the need for contrast administration. The dataset for this research included 131 patients who underwent brain non-contrast computed tomography directly followed by computed tomography with contrast administration. Then, the segmentations of arteries were generated and aligned with non-contrast computed tomography scans. A deep learning model based on the U-net architecture was trained to perform the segmentation of blood vessels on non-contrast computed tomography. An evaluation was performed on separate test data, as well as using cross-validation, reaching Dice coefficients of 0.638 and 0.673, respectively. This study proves that deep learning methods can be leveraged to quickly solve problems that are difficult and time-consuming for a human observer, therefore providing physicians with additional information on the patient.

https://openalex.org/W3046572100,"The tamoxifen-dependent Cre/lox system in transgenic mice has become an important research tool across all scientific disciplines for manipulating gene expression in specific cell types. In these mouse models, Cre-recombination is not induced until tamoxifen is administered, which allows researchers to have temporal control of genetic modifications. Interestingly, tamoxifen has been identified as a potential therapy for spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury patients due to its neuroprotective properties. It is also reparative in that it stimulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination after toxin-induced demyelination. However, it is unknown whether tamoxifen is neuroprotective and neuroreparative when administration is delayed after SCI. To properly interpret data from transgenic mice in which tamoxifen treatment is delayed after SCI, it is necessary to identify the effects of tamoxifen alone on anatomical and functional recovery. In this study, female and male mice received a moderate mid-thoracic spinal cord contusion. Mice were then gavaged with corn oil or a high dose of tamoxifen from 19–22 days post-injury, and sacrificed 42 days post-injury. All mice underwent behavioral testing for the duration of the study, which revealed that tamoxifen treatment did not impact hindlimb motor recovery. Similarly, histological analyses revealed that tamoxifen had no effect on white matter sparing, total axon number, axon sprouting, glial reactivity, cell proliferation, oligodendrocyte number, or myelination, but tamoxifen did decrease the number of neurons in the dorsal and ventral horn. Semi-thin sections confirmed that axon demyelination and remyelination were unaffected by tamoxifen. Sex-specific responses to tamoxifen were also assessed, and there were no significant differences between female and male mice. These data suggest that delayed tamoxifen administration after SCI does not change functional recovery or improve tissue sparing in female or male mice."
https://openalex.org/W3046621115,"There is a significant unmet need for a safe and effective therapy for the treatment of children with congenital hyperinsulinism. We hypothesized that amplification of the glucagon signaling pathway could ameliorate hyperinsulinism associated hypoglycemia. In order to test this we evaluated the effects of loss of Prkar1a, a negative regulator of Protein Kinase A in the context of hyperinsulinemic conditions. With reduction of Prkar1a expression, we observed a significant upregulation of hepatic gluconeogenic genes. In wild type mice receiving a continuous infusion of insulin by mini-osmotic pump, we observed a 2-fold increase in the level of circulating ketones and a more than 40-fold increase in Kiss1 expression with reduction of Prkar1a. Loss of Prkar1a in the Sur1-/- mouse model of KATP hyperinsulinism significantly attenuated fasting induced hypoglycemia, decreased the insulin/glucose ratio, and also increased the hepatic expression of Kiss1 by more than 10-fold. Together these data demonstrate that amplification of the hepatic glucagon signaling pathway is able to rescue hypoglycemia caused by hyperinsulinism."
https://openalex.org/W3046709318,"Equal segregation of chromosomes during mitosis ensures euploidy of daughter cells. Defects in this process may result in an imbalance in the chromosomal composition and cellular transformation. Proteolytic and non-proteolytic ubiquitylation pathways ensure directionality and fidelity of mitotic progression but specific mitotic functions of deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) remain less studied. Here we describe the role of the DUB ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L3 (UCHL3) in the regulation of chromosome bi-orientation and segregation during mitosis. Downregulation or inhibition of UCHL3 leads to chromosome alignment defects during metaphase. Frequent segregation errors during anaphase are also observed upon inactivation of UCHL3. Mechanistically, UCHL3 interacts with and deubiquitylates Aurora B, the catalytic subunit of chromosome passenger complex (CPC), known to be critically involved in the regulation of chromosome alignment and segregation. UCHL3 does not regulate protein levels of Aurora B or the binding of Aurora B to other CPC subunits. Instead, UCHL3 promotes localization of Aurora B to kinetochores, suggesting its role in the error correction mechanism monitoring bi-orientation of chromosomes during metaphase. Thus, UCHL3 contributes to the regulation of faithful genome segregation and maintenance of euploidy in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W3046837890,"Staphylococcus aureus is the main cause of septic arthritis in humans, a disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. Inflammation triggered in response to infection is fundamental to control bacterial growth but may cause permanent tissue damage. Here, we evaluated the role of Lipoxin A4 (LXA4 ) in S aureus-induced arthritis in mice. Septic arthritis was induced by S aureus injection into tibiofemoral joints. At different time points, we evaluated cell recruitment and bacterial load in the joint, the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, and LXA4 in inflamed tissue and analyzed joint damage and dysfunction. LXA4 was investigated using genetically modified mice or by pharmacological blockade of its synthesis and receptor. CD11c+ cells were evaluated in lymph nodes by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry and dendritic cell chemotaxis using the Boyden chamber. Absence or pharmacological blockade of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) reduced joint inflammation and dysfunction and was associated with better control of infection at 4 to 7 days after the infection. There was an increase in LXA4 in joints of S aureus-infected mice and administration of LXA4 reversed the phenotype in 5-LO-/- mice. Blockade or absence of the LXA4 receptor FPR2 has a phenotype similar to 5-LO-/- mice. Mechanistically, LXA4 appeared to control migration and function of dendritic cells, cells shown to be crucial for adequate protective responses in the model. Thus, after the first days of infection when symptoms become evident therapies that inhibit LXA4 synthesis or action could be useful for treatment of S aureus-induced arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W3046326974,"Background The ability to detect one’s own memory capacity and develop strategies based on daily contexts is important for daily activities. The Contextual Memory Test (CMT) assesses self-awareness, self-efficacy, self-perception/evaluation of performance, recall, and strategy use that are associated with daily contexts, and could be a potentially suitable measurement for assessing memory and meta-memory in older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, the test-retest reliability and minimal detectable change (MDC) remain unknown in these individuals. Objective The purpose of this study was to examine test-retest reliability and calculate MDC of the CMT in healthy older adults and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods Eighty-three participants completed the CMT twice with a one-month interval. Test-retest reliability was examined using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) in all seven domains of the CMT and the recognition subtest. The standard error of measurement (SEM) and MDC were calculated. The Bland-Altman analysis was performed to evaluate the degree of agreement between measurements. Results The ICC of five domains (self-awareness, self-perception/evaluation of performance, immediate/delayed/total recall) and the recognition subtest were good to excellent (ICC = 0.63–0.94) in healthy and MCI participants and the MDC% were less than 30% The ICC of the other two domains (self-efficacy and total strategy use, TSS) were low (ICC = 0.07–0.59) and the MDC% exceeded 30%. The Bland-Altman analysis showed generally better performance in the 2nd than the 1st measurement in most CMT domains. Conclusions Our results revealed sufficient test-retest reliability and acceptable MDC in most CMT domains in healthy and MCI participants. Only the self-efficacy and TSS domains demonstrated low ICC and large MDC. Possible practice effects were found between repeated measurements. Clinicians should be cautious when evaluating self-efficacy and strategy use using the CMT in older adults. Further improvements are needed for these two domains."
https://openalex.org/W3046541716,"The definition of an in vivo nodal anatomical baseline is crucial for validation of representative lymph node dissections and accompanying pathology reports of pelvic cancers, as well as for assessing a potential therapeutic effect of extended lymph node dissections. Therefore the number, size and distribution of lymph nodes in the pelvis were assessed with high-resolution, large field-of-view, 7 Tesla (T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with frequency-selective excitation.We used 7 T MRI for homogeneous pelvic imaging in 11 young healthy volunteers. Frequency-selective imaging of water and lipids was performed to detect nodal structures in the pelvis. Number and size of detected nodes was measured and size distribution per region was assessed. An average volunteer-normalized nodal size distribution was determined.In total, 564 lymph nodes were detected in six pelvic regions. Mean number was 51.3 with a wide range of 19-91 lymph nodes per volunteer. Mean diameter was 2.3 mm with a range of 1 to 7 mm. 69% Was 2 mm or smaller. The overall size distribution was very similar to the average volunteer-normalized nodal size distribution.The amount of in vivo visible lymph nodes varies largely between subjects, whereas the normalized size distribution of nodes does not. The presence of many small lymph nodes (≤2mm) renders representative or complete removal of pelvic lymph nodes to be very difficult. 7T MRI may shift the in vivo detection limits of lymph node metastases in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3046822825,"Background and objectives Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common type of glomerulonephritis with variable renal outcome. The association between IgAN and patient survival is limited. The effect of crescents on patient survival was never studied. Materials We conducted a retrospective cohort study between January 2003 and December 2013. All patients with the biopsy-proved IgAN was enrolled for the analysis of patient survival and renal survival. Cox regression model was used analyze the associated factors for patient survival. Results All 388 participants with IgAN were enrolled, in which 45 patients with crescents. The mean percentage of glomeruli involvement was 23±18.9%. After long-term follow-up, crescents group had both worse renal (p = 0.034) and patient survivals (p = 0.016). In univariate Cox regression model, the age (HR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.05–1.12, p<0.001), crescents (HR = 3.93, 95% CI = 1.18–13.07, p = 0.025), serum albumin (HR = 0.023, 95%CI = 0.11–0.50, p<0.001), blood total protein (HR = 0.46, 95%CI = 0.28–0.75, p = 0.002), HDL (HR = 0.95, 95%CI = 0.91–0.99, p = 0.009), daily urine protein (HR = 1.14, 95%CI = 1.01–1.29, p = 0.038), urine PCR (HR = 1.07, 95%CI = 1.02–1.12, p = 0.003), serum IgM (HR = 0.98, 95%CI = 0.96–1.00, p = 0.036), BUN (HR = 1.02, 95%CI = 1.01–1.02, p = 0.005), and eGFR (HR = 0.097, 95%CI = 0.94–0.99, p = 0.0011) were associated with patient survival. After multivariate Cox regression analysis, age (HR = 1.08, 95%CI = 1.01–1.13, p = 0.013), crescents (HR = 5.57, 95%CI = 1.14–29.05, p = 0.034), and HDL (HR = 0.94, 95%CI = 0.90–0.99, p = 0.026) were associated with patient survival. Crescents IgAN is with the highest risk (up to 5.75 of HR) for patient mortality. Conclusions The major strengths of the present study is that crescents IgAN had worse patient survival compared to non-crescents IgAN. Clinicians should be more careful to care patients with crescents IgAN."
https://openalex.org/W3046902485,"Osteoarthritis in cats is more prevalent because cats are living longer with advancement in veterinary medicine. Objective evaluation of behavioral changes in cats with osteoarthritis can facilitate an early diagnosis. The objective of this study was to investigate the utility of a novel activity monitor for analyzing physical activities and sleep quality in cats. First, a novel activity monitor (Plus Cycle®; JARMeC, Kanagawa, Japan), with a built-in three-directional accelerometer and an air pressure sensor specifically designed for cats, was compared to a human activity monitor (Actical®; Philips Respironics, OR, USA) previously used in cats (n = 10). Second, the validity of the measurement accuracy of the amount of physical activity, the number of vibrations, the number of jumps, and the resting and sleeping time was evaluated using Plus Cycle® in healthy cats (n = 6). Finally, the effects of gender and age of cats and time of day on the amount of physical activity, the number of vibrations, the number of jumps, and the resting and sleeping time were investigated in client-owned cats (n = 61). There were strong correlations between Plus Cycle® and Actical® in total activity (p < 0.05) and activity intensity (p < 0.05). When the physical activities were measured using Plus Cycle® in healthy cats, those data were quantified with high accuracy. In addition, it was also found to be very accurate in discriminating the resting and sleeping conditions of cats. In client-owned cats, there were no significant differences with respect to gender in any measured traits. The amount of physical activity and the number of jumps significantly decreased with the age of the cat. In contrast, the resting and sleeping times significantly increased with the age of the cat. In conclusion, Plus Cycle® can accurately and objectively assess physical activities and sleep quality with age of the cat, suggesting that this novel activity monitor can be used to manage the feline musculoskeletal health."
https://openalex.org/W3046919996,"Mutations that cause Huntington's Disease involve a polyglutamine (polyQ) sequence expansion beyond 35 repeats in exon 1 of Huntingtin. Intracellular inclusion bodies of mutant Huntingtin protein are a key feature of Huntington's disease brain pathology. We previously showed that in cell culture the formation of inclusions involved the assembly of disordered structures of mHtt exon 1 fragments (Httex1) and they were enriched with translational machinery when first formed. We hypothesized that nascent mutant Httex1 chains co-aggregate during translation by phase separation into liquid-like disordered aggregates and then convert to more rigid, amyloid structures. Here we further examined the mechanisms of inclusion assembly in a human epithelial kidney (AD293) cell culture model. We found mHttex1 did not appear to stall translation of its own nascent chain, or at best was marginal. We also found the inclusions appeared to recruit low levels of RNA but there was no difference in enrichment between early formed and mature inclusions. Proteins involved in translation or ribosome quality control were co-recruited to the inclusions (Ltn1 Rack1) compared to a protein not anticipated to be involved (NACAD), but there was no major specificity of enrichment in the early formed inclusions compared to mature inclusions. Furthermore, we observed co-aggregation with other proteins previously identified in inclusions, including Upf1 and chaperone-like proteins Sgta and Hspb1, which also suppressed aggregation at high co-expression levels. The newly formed inclusions also contained immobile mHttex1 molecules which points to the disordered aggregates being mechanically rigid prior to amyloid formation. Collectively our findings show little evidence that inclusion assembly arises by a discrete clustering of stalled nascent chains and associated quality control machinery. Instead, the machinery appear to be recruited continuously, or secondarily, to the nucleation of inclusion formation."
https://openalex.org/W3046921973,"Although most felids have an exclusive carnivore diet, the presence of plant matter in scat has been reported among various species. This indicates that there may be an adaptive significance to the conservation of plant-eating behavior in felid evolution. Some studies have hypothesized that felids consume plants for self-medication or as a source of nutrition. In addition, it is thought that plant intake helps them to excrete hairballs, however, no scientific work has confirmed these effects. Thus, the objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between plant intake and hair evacuation in felid species. We selected snow leopards (Panthera uncia) as the study species because they have longer and denser hair than other felids. The behavior of 11 captive snow leopards was observed and scat samples from eight of them and two other captive individuals were analyzed. Snow leopards evacuate hair possibly by vomiting and excreting in scats. The frequency of plant-eating and vomiting and the amount of hair and plant in scat were evaluated. We found that the frequency of vomiting was much lower than the frequency of plant-eating. In addition, there was no significant relationship between the amount of plant matter contained in scats and the amount of hair in scats. Contrary to the common assumption, our results indicate that plant intake has little effect on hair evacuation in felid species."
https://openalex.org/W3046437965,"Selenoprotein P (SEPP1) is a kind of secretory glycoproteins with an antioxidant effect during the development of some diseases. In this study, we attempted to observe the expression of SEPP1 in livers from the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and explore its effect on HCC cells. All the tissues from patients with HCC were obtained from Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University. Western blot and immunohistochemical results showed that SEPP1 was reduced in HCC liver tissues. Its expression was negatively correlated with Ki67 expression in tissues. The expression of SEPP1 in normal liver cell line was significantly higher than those in the liver cancer cell lines. Serum starvation and release experiment demonstrated that SEPP1 expression was reduced and PCNA expression was increased, when the serum was re-added into cell culture system and the cells were on a proliferation state. After SEPP1 over-expression plasmid was transfected into HepG2 cells, cell proliferation of HepG2 cells and PCNA expression level were all inhibited by SEPP1. Results obtained via 8-isoprostane ELISA further indicated that inhibited ROS level was found in HepG2 cells transfected with SEPP1 over-expression plasmid. In addition, RT-qPCR results demonstrated that GPX1 expression levels increased in HepG2 cells transfected with SEPP1 over-expression plasmid. In conclusion, SEPP1 may inhibit the proliferation of HCC cells, accompanied by the reduction of ROS production and the increasing of GPX1 expression."

Macrophages play an important role in host defense against infectious agents, but the role of this cell in L. intracellularis infection is not well understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the permissibility of macrophages to L. intracellularis infection in vitro. Pure culture of L. intracellularis was added to swine peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages. Viability of intracytoplasmic L. intracellularis was evaluated at different time points by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Potential replication of L. intracellularis in macrophages was also evaluated by qPCR. By TEM, phagocytosis L. intracellularis within of phagolysosomes were observed 1-hour post-infection (hpi) and bacterial structures in binary fission at 48 hpi. The number of intracellular bacteria was determined at 1, 4, 24, 48, and 72 hpi by qPCR in infected macrophages and compared to the number of intracellular bacteria from culture in McCoy cells. In both cell lines, the amount of L. intracellularis was decreased at 4 hpiand increased at 24 hpi. The number of intracellular bacteria continued to increase in McCoy cells over time. This is the first study showing interaction, survival and propagation of L. intracellularis in macrophages. These findings are critical to establish an experimental model for future studies of the pathogenesis of porcine proliferative enteropathy and the potential persistence of L. intracellularis in macrophages during chronic infections."
https://openalex.org/W3046452728,"Osteoclast-mediated inflammatory bone resorption is a major cause of many inflammatory bone disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis. However, the mechanisms regulating osteoclast differentiation in inflammatory settings are not well understood. We demonstrate here that early estrogen-induced gene 1 (EEIG1)-deficient mice are protected from inflammatory bone loss as determined with the use of models of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone destruction. EEIG1-deficient macrophages markedly decreased RANKL- and TNFα-mediated osteoclastogenesis due to the downregulation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), which is an essential transcription factor for osteoclast formation. In contrast, expression of interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), a transcriptional repressor that blocks osteoclast differentiation, is elevated in EEIG1-deficient macrophages relative to wild-type cells. We found that reduced expression of B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp1) by siRNA downregulated RANKL-induced EEIG1 levels, whereas overexpression of Blimp1 potentiated EEIG1 levels. Mechanistic studies revealed that EEIG1 forms a complex with Blimp1 to negatively regulate the expression of the anti-osteoclastogenic gene, Irf8. We elucidated a novel mechanism by which EEIG1 restricts IRF8 expression and function, thereby enhancing the osteoclast formation by contributing to Blimp1-mediated IRF8 regulation. Together, these findings identify EEIG1 as a key regulator of osteoclastogenesis and a possible therapeutic target for pathological bone destruction."
https://openalex.org/W3046672597,"Protein energy wasting (PEW) including muscle atrophy is a common complication in chronic hemodialysis patients. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is the main proteolytic system causing muscle atrophy in chronic kidney disease and proteasome 20S is the catalytic component of the UPS. Circulating proteasome 20S (c20S proteasome) is present in the blood and its level is related to disease severity and prognosis in several disorders. We hypothesized that c20S proteasome could be related with muscle mass, other PEW criteria and their evolution in hemodialysis patients. Stable hemodialysis patients treated at our center for more than 3 months were followed over 2 years. C20S proteasome assay was performed at baseline. Biological and clinical data were collected, muscle mass was assessed by multi-frequency bio-impedancemetry, and nutritional scores were calculated at baseline, 1 year and 2 years. Hospitalizations and mortality data were collected over the 2 years. Forty-nine patients were included. At baseline, the c20S proteasome level was 0.40[0.26–0.55] μg/ml. Low muscle mass as defined by a lean tissue index (LTI) < 10th in accordance with the International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism guidelines was observed in 36% and PEW in 62%. Increased c20S proteasome levels were related with LTI at baseline (R = 0.43, p = 0.004) and with its 2 year-variation (R = -0.56, p = 0.003). Two-year survival rate was not different between higher and lower c20S proteasome values (78.9 vs 78.4%, p = 0.98 log-rank test). C20S proteasome is not a good marker for assessing nutritional status in hemodialysis patients and predicting patient outcomes."

PYGM (muscle glycogen phosphorylase gene) mRNA expression and its association with clinical, morphological, and genetic aspects of the disease as a set have not been studied previously. Methods We investigated genetic variation in PYGM considering the number of PTCs (premature termination codon) per sample and compared mRNA expression in skeletal muscle samples from 15 patients with McArdle disease and 16 controls to PTCs number and different aspects of the disease. Results The main variant found was c.148C>T (PTC—premature termination codon). Patients with two PTCs showed 42% mRNA expression compared to the control group. Most cases showed an inversely proportional relation among PTCs and mRNA expression. Association between mRNA expression and other aspects of the disease showed no statistically significant difference (p> 0.05). Discussion mRNA expression is not useful as a predictor factor for the prognosis and severity of the disease. Different mechanisms as post-transcriptional events, epigenetics factors or protein function may be involved."

We also aimed to purify hGH from the milk, to characterize the purified protein, and to assess the potential of our model for mass production of therapeutic proteins using transgenic techniques. Using ~15.5 L transgenic pig milk, we obtained proteins with ≥ 99% purity after three pre-treatments and five column chromatography steps. To confirm the biosimilarity of our milk-derived purified recombinant hGH (CGH942) with commercially available somatropin (Genotropin), we performed spectroscopy, structural, and biological analyses. We observed no difference between the purified protein and Genotropin samples. Furthermore, rat models were used to assess growth promotion potential. Our results indicate that CGH942 promotes growth, by increasing bone development and body weight. Toxicity assessments revealed no abnormal findings after 4 weeks of continuous administration and 2 weeks of recovery. The no-observed-adverse-effect level for both males and females was determined to be 0.6 mg/kg/day. Thus, no toxicological differences were observed between commercially available somatropin and CGH942 obtained from transgenic pig milk. In conclusion, we describe a transgenic technique using pigs, providing a new platform to produce human therapeutic proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3046596954,"Pyrazinamide is an important drug against the latent stage of tuberculosis and is used in both first- and second-line treatment regimens. Pyrazinamide-susceptibility test usually takes a week to have a diagnosis to guide initial therapy, implying a delay in receiving appropriate therapy. The continued increase in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and the prevalence of pyrazinamide resistance in several countries makes the development of assays for prompt identification of resistance necessary. The main cause of pyrazinamide resistance is the impairment of pyrazinamidase function attributed to mutations in the promoter and/or pncA coding gene. However, not all pncA mutations necessarily affect the pyrazinamidase function.To develop a methodology to predict pyrazinamidase function from detected mutations in the pncA gene.We measured the catalytic constant (kcat), KM, enzymatic efficiency, and enzymatic activity of 35 recombinant mutated pyrazinamidase and the wild type (Protein Data Bank ID = 3pl1). From all the 3D modeled structures, we extracted several predictors based on three categories: structural stability (estimated by normal mode analysis and molecular dynamics), physicochemical, and geometrical characteristics. We used a stepwise Akaike's information criterion forward multiple log-linear regression to model each kinetic parameter with each category of predictors. We also developed weighted models combining the three categories of predictive models for each kinetic parameter. We tested the robustness of the predictive ability of each model by 6-fold cross-validation against random models.The stability, physicochemical, and geometrical descriptors explained most of the variability (R2) of the kinetic parameters. Our models are best suited to predict kcat, efficiency, and activity based on the root-mean-square error of prediction of the 6-fold cross-validation.This study shows a quick approach to predict the pyrazinamidase function only from the pncA sequence when point mutations are present. This can be an important tool to detect pyrazinamide resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3046611063,"Scientific and reasonable treatment of dredged silt can not only protect the ecological environment but also play an essential role in the utilization of silt resources. Due to high water content, low permeability and high organic matter content of the silt, a large amount of bacteria and harmful gases are often produced during the process of silt sedimentation. Thermal drying has been taken as a technically attractive method for harmless treatment of contaminated dredged silt. In this study, ultrasound technology is introduced to shorten the time needed for silt drying. A preliminary laboratory study is carried out to assess the effectiveness of ultrasound on thermal drying. A series of thermal drying tests, with and without ultrasound, were conducted on kaolin soil specimens that were prepared by settling and self-weight consolidation. The test results show that the length of drying time can be shortened by increasing temperature and ultrasound power. The drying time plays a dominant role in the determination of the total energy consumption. This is because reduction of drying time leads to significant decrease in energy consumption for thermal drying, and the energy consumption for additional ultrasound is relatively marginal. For thermal drying at temperatures 60 and 100°C, when combined with 100 W ultrasound, the length of drying time was shortened by 44.19% and 45.16%, and the energy consumption was saved by 30.07% and 38.16%, respectively; when combined with 60 W ultrasound, the length of drying time was shortened by 4.65% and 6.45%, but the energy consumption was increased by 9.79% and 0.48%, respectively. The combination of thermal drying and 100 W ultrasound is found to be optimal in terms of drying rate and energy consumption for silt drying."
