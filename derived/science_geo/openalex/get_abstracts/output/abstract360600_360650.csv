https://openalex.org/W1976572901,"The importin α/β pathway mediates nuclear import of proteins containing the classical nuclear localization signals (NLSs). Although the consensus sequences of the classical NLSs have been defined, there are still many NLSs that do not match the consensus rule and many nonfunctional sequences that match the consensus. We report here six different NLS classes that specifically bind to distinct binding pockets of importin α. By screening of random peptide libraries using an mRNA display, we selected peptides bound by importin α and identified six classes of NLSs, including three novel classes. Two noncanonical classes (class 3 and class 4) specifically bound the minor binding pocket of importin α, whereas the classical monopartite NLSs (class 1 and class 2) bound to the major binding pocket. Using a newly developed universal green fluorescent protein expression system, we found that these NLS classes, including plant-specific class 5 NLSs and bipartite NLSs, fundamentally require the regions outside the core basic residues for their activity and have specific residues or patterns that confer the activities differently between yeast, plants, and mammals. Furthermore, amino acid replacement analyses revealed that the consensus basic patterns of the classical NLSs are not essential for activity, thereby generating more unconventional patterns, including redox-sensitive NLSs. These results explain the causes of the NLS diversity. The defined consensus patterns and properties of importin α-dependent NLSs provide useful information for identifying NLSs.

Chem. 2007; 282: 5101-5105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Nuclear import of proteins is generally initiated by the formation of a ternary complex with importin α, importin β1, and a cargo, where importin β1 docks the complex to the NPC to release the cargo into the nucleus through the binding of Ran-GTP to importin β1 (6Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 7Weis K. Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). An asymmetric distribution of Ran-GTP and Ran-GDP between the nucleus and the cytoplasm controls the cargo import and export, and this gradient is maintained by various Ran-associated regulatory factors (8Kalab P. Weis K. Heald R. Science. 2002; 295: 2452-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In the importin α/β pathway, importin α serves as an adaptor that links cargos and importin β1 and recognizes NLSs within the cargos. Importin α recognizes two classes of NLSs, known as classical NLSs: monopartite NLSs having a single cluster of basic amino acid residues and bipartite NLSs having two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a 10–12-amino acid linker (5Lange A. Mills R.E. Lange C.J. Stewart M. Devine S.E. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5101-5105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Further, there are two types of monopartite NLSs; one has at least four consecutive basic amino acids, exemplified by the SV40 large T antigen NLS (PKKKRKV) (9Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar), whereas the other has only three basic amino acids and is represented by K(K/R)X(K/R) as a putative consensus sequence. The latter is exemplified by the c-Myc NLS (PAAKRVKLD) (10Dang C.V. Lee W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4048-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In this study, the two types of the monopartite NLS have been designated as “class 1” and “class 2” NLS, respectively. A putative consensus sequence of the bipartite NLS has been defined as (K/R)(K/R)X10–12(K/R)3/5, where (K/R)3/5 represents at least three of either lysine or arginine of five consecutive amino acids, in which the linker region has been found to be tolerant to amino acid conversion (11Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar, 12Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Although the putative consensus sequences of the classical NLSs have been defined, there are a number of experimentally defined NLSs that do not match the consensus sequences, and furthermore, there is likely to be a great number of nonfunctional sequences that match the consensus. Importin α possesses two distinct NLS binding sites, and the major NLS binding site binds to the classical monopartite NLS, whereas both sites are required for binding to bipartite NLS (13Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 14Fontes M.R. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol.

Structure. 2000; 8: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). It is likely that the presence of two distinct binding sites in a single importin α molecule generates a number of NLS patterns. In addition, monopartite NLSs require specific residues flanking the core basic cluster for their complete activity (17Fontes M.R. Teh T. Toth G. John A. Pavo I. Jans D.A. Kobe B. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 18Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol.

In this study, we have collected various types of NLS by screening random peptide libraries and identified six different classes of NLS, including noncanonical ones that bind specifically to the minor binding site of importin α. The results demonstrate that a single importin α can bind more diverse patterns of NLS than previously recognized. Plasmid Construction—The cDNA fragments of importins were PCR-amplified and cloned to pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) or pMAL-c2. Universal green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression constructs were generated using DNA fragments encoding an enhanced GFP from pQBI25-fC1 (Qbiogene, CA) and a tTA transactivator from pTet-off (Clontech). For more details, see the supplemental material. Production of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant importin proteins fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST) or maltose-binding protein were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) or amylose resin (New England Biolabs). For more details, see the supplemental material. Construction of Random Peptide-mRNA/cDNA Fusion Libraries—IVV libraries containing randomized peptides were prepared with oligonucleotides (supplemental Table S1). Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing SP6 promoter were in vitro transcribed, ligated to a polyethylene glycol-puromycin spacer (21Horisawa K. Tateyama S. Ishizaka M. Matsumura N. Takashima H. Miyamoto-Sato E. Doi N. Yanagawa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e169Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Miyamoto-Sato E. Ishizaka M. Horisawa K. Tateyama S. Takashima H. Fuse S. Sue K. Hirai N. Masuoka K. Yanagawa H. Genome Res. 2005; 15: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and in vitro translated. The resulting peptide-mRNA fusions were converted to peptide-mRNA/cDNA by reverse transcription. For more details, see supplemental material. Library Screening—The random peptide IVV library (40 pmol) of cDNA/mRNA-peptide fusion was diluted in 60 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.8), 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% skim milk) and incubated for 30 min with the rice, human, and yeast importin α (20 μg) fused with GST, which had been bound to 20–25 μl of glutathione beads packed in a minicolumn made of a 200-μl pipette tip. For the rice maltose-binding protein-importin α (10 μg) the incubation with the library was conducted in solution for 30 min at room temperature, and the solution was repeatedly passed through a 200-μl pipette tip column containing 25 μl of amylose resin. These columns were sequentially washed with 200 μl of binding buffer, 200 μl of washing buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.8), 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40), and 200 μl of washing buffer lacking NaCl and eluted with 30 μl of 20 mm glutathione and 20 mm maltose. The volume of the washing buffer was increased to 600–800 μl with each cycle of the screening. The selected DNAs in the eluate were PCR-amplified with SP6-SD2 and Flag2 primers (supplemental Table S1) and HotStarTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen). The amplified DNA fragments were purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and used as a library for the subsequent round of screening. As the screening cycle was increased, the amount of library and the amplification cycles of PCR were decreased to 10–20 pmol and 23–25 cycles, respectively. Finally, the amplified DNAs were digested with BamHI and XbaI and cloned into the pTUE-GFP3 vector for sequencing and transfection assay. At least 10 clones from each screening round (except for the first round) were sequenced and assayed for nuclear import activity. The optimal round was selected to satisfy both high sequence diversity and high rate of functional NLS in the pool from the respective rounds. Cell Culture and Transfection and GFP Observation—The mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 or the HeLa cell line was grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for NIH3T3 cells and Eagle’s minimum essential medium for HeLa cells, each supplemented with 10% calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Transfections were performed in 5 × 104 cells/ml in 24-well plates or 35-mm culture dishes, and the cells were cotransfected with ∼0.5 μg of a GFP reporter plasmid and 0.3 μg of a pTet-Off plasmid (Clontech) using 2 μl of jet-PEI reagent (PolyPlus-transfection, Strasbourg, France) according to the manufacturer’s instruction and cultured for 36–48 h. For plant cells, suspension-cultured tobacco cells were established from calli of Nicotiana tobacum cv. Sumsun NN and maintained as previously described (23Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cultured tobacco cells were blotted on 5-cm filter paper discs and transfected with plasmid DNA by microprojectile bombardment (23Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), except that 1.2 mg of ∼1-μm tungsten particles were coated with 2 μg each of a GFP reporter and 4 μg of a p35S-tTA plasmid. Bombarded cells were cultured at 28 °C for 20 h in the dark. Yeast manipulations, including culture and transformation, were performed as described (23Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and strain SFY526 (Clontech) was used in most experiments. SFY526 was cotransformed with 0.5 μg each of a GFP reporter and a pGBK-tTA plasmid and cultured with the SD synthetic medium lacking leucine and tryptophan in 48-well plates at 30 °C. The yeast expressing tTA grew very slowly, so the transformed cells were cultured for at least 3 days. GFP expressed in these transfected cells was observed using an epifluorescence microscope, model BX51 (Olympus), with an excitation filter specific to 460–490 nm. Importin Binding Assay—The purified GST-importin fusion proteins (2.0 or 3.0 μg) were incubated with the thioredoxin (Trx)-GFP-NLS proteins (2.0 μg) in 20 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 12.5% glycerol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 60 min at room temperature. The reactions were electrophoresed on native 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, 1× Tris-glycine buffer containing 10% glycerol for 50 min under a constant voltage of 160 V. The GFP fluorescence of Trx-GFP fusion proteins on the gel was observed with a fluorescence image analyzer, Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Five Classes of Monopartite NLSs Identified by mRNA Display Screening with Importin α—To identify many examples of functional monopartite NLSs, we screened random peptide libraries by an in vitro virus (IVV) method with different importin α variants as bait (Fig. 1, A and B). IVV is an mRNA display technique for the production of a protein covalently linked to its encoding mRNA, and it is more suitable for screening a large library as compared with other conventional methods (22Miyamoto-Sato E.

Using importin α variants (Osimp α1 and Hsimp α3) lacking the N-terminal importin β binding (IBB) domain from rice importin α1a and human importin α3, which comprise the major subgroups of the importin α family (27Goldfarb D.S.

Yamamoto N. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we selected 218 and 253 sequences from 12X and XBBX IVV libraries, which could encode monopartite NLSs, after five and six rounds of screening, respectively. Many of the selected sequences exhibited a significant level of nuclear import activity and could be classified into five classes of monopartite NLS when aligned (Fig. 2). Unexpectedly, the sequences selected from the 12X and XBBX libraries contained many unconventional NLSs with only two or three consecutive basic amino acids, and these could be divided into three classes, designated classes 3–5 (Fig. 2). A native NLS that matched class 3 NLS was observed at the C terminus of the mammalian nucleolar RNA helicase II/Gu involved in rRNA synthesis and was confirmed to be responsible for its nuclear import (Fig. 3). In contrast to classes 3 and 4, class 5 NLS was functional only in plant cells. An in vitro binding assay with recombinant importin α variants from different species showed that a class 5 NLS strongly interacted only with a rice importin α, whereas the classical NLSs and class 3 and class 4 NLSs bound to most importin α variants from yeast, rice, and humans, which indicates that class 5 NLS is plant-specific (Fig. S1).FIGURE 2NLS peptides screened from 12X and XBBX libraries. The 12X and XBBX libraries were screened with Osimpα1ΔIBB as bait. All of the indicated sequences, which were classified into five classes by alignment, had a strong or moderate activity for nuclear import when assayed in cultured tobacco cells. The numbers indicated at the left of the sequences represent the clone numbers, and the numbers given in parentheses at the right represent the numbers of the identical sequences contained in a selected pool. The clone numbers that begin with “a” and “b” represent the sequences selected from 12X and XBBX libraries, respectively. Lysine and arginine are highlighted in red, and aromatic amino acids conserved in class 3 and class 4 NLSs are in blue. Sequences, AF and LG, conserved in class 3 and class 5 NLSs are marked in purple and green, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Nuclear import of nucleolar RNA helicase II/Gu depending on class 3 NLS. A class 3 NLS was observed in the C terminus (residues 842–849) of the nucleolar RNA helicase II/Gu (Ddx21) from mouse. The C-terminally intact (wt; residues 71–851) and truncated forms (dC; residues 71–841) were fused at the C terminus of GFP of pTUE-GFP2 and were expressed in NIH3T3 cells. The GFP fluorescence of GFP-dC was observed in the cytoplasm as well as the nucleolus (in ∼70% of the cells), in contrast to that of wild type observed exclusively at the nucleolus and nucleoplasm (in >90% of the cells). Nuclei are indicated by arrowheads and, alternatively, outlined with broken lines. Photographs are representatives of the cells showing the GFP localization for each construct.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To collect many more kinds of noncanonical NLSs, we extracted 29 unconventional NLSs from over 400 sequences previously reported in the literature. These unconventional NLSs had relatively short stretches of residues and appeared not to match the NLSs defined in this study. Unexpectedly, only three of these NLSs had a strong or medium level of activity, suggesting that the other 26 sequences may require additional sequences for complete activity (data not shown). Mutational analyses revealed that these three NLSs (BDV-P1-NLS, RHA-NLS, and HCV-NS5A-NLS) were unconventional class 2 NLSs that had a stretch of activating flanking residues (see Fig. 6C) (described below). This result indicates that most of the importin α-dependent monopartite NLS sequences are categorized into the five NLS classes defined in this study. Class 3 and Class 4 NLSs Bind to the Minor Binding Groove of Importin α—Importin α contains two NLS binding grooves, the major and minor NLS binding sites, each located at the N-terminal Armadillo (Arm) repeat 2–4 and C-terminal Arm repeat 7–8 (Fig. 4A). We examined which of the two NLS binding grooves of importin α makes specific contact with class 3 and class 4 NLSs. We created a ΔIBB variant (Kapα) of Kap60p, an importin α of budding yeast, and its mutants (Kapα mut1 and Kapα mut2, each mutated at the major and minor NLS-binding sites) (29Málen K. Fagerlund R. Franke J. Ko¨hler M. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28193-28200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). An in vitro binding assay with these importin variants and GFP fusions with various classes of NLS showed that class 1 NLS (SV40 NLS) was specifically bound to the major binding site of importin α, whereas the bipartite NLS (NP-NLS) was bound to the both sites (Fig. 4B); this concurred with previous findings (13Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 30Leung S.W. Harreman M.T. Hodel M.R. Hodel A.E. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41947-41953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, class 3 (KRSWSMAF) and class 4 (KRKYF) NLSs exhibited specific binding to the minor binding site of importin α, although the binding of the class 4 sequence was considerably weak because of a lack of its N-terminal Arg or Pro (see Fig. 5). These results explain the reason underlying the considerable difference in sequence between class 1/2 and class 3/4 NLS subgroups, although they bind to the same importin α species.FIGURE 5Amino acid replacement analysis of class 2–5 monopartite NLSs. One or two residues within the indicated classes of NLSs were replaced with different residues at different positions. The NLS mutants were assayed in yeast (Y), tobacco (P), and NIH3T3 (M). The asterisks represent unchanged residues. Activity scores were represented as in Fig. S3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Determination of Relative Levels of NLS Activity in Different Species—Although the importin α/β pathway is a well conserved system in eukaryotes, identification of the plant-specific class 5 NLS suggests that NLS specificities differ among species. Human and Arabidopsis possess six and eight importin α subtypes, respectively, which contain the conserved Arm repeat domain that is directly involved in NLS recognition. The Arm domains of human and Arabidopsis importin α subtypes exhibit 51–90% (average of 61%) and 45–87% (average of 66%) amino acid identities within species, respectively and 34–63% (average of 52%) identity between the species (Fig. S2). This suggests that the differences in NLS specificities among importin α subtypes of different species are likely to be larger than those of same-species importin α subtypes. Thus, we examined the specificities of various patterns and classes of NLS from different species. To effectively assess the nuclear import activity of peptide sequences in different species, we developed a universal GFP expression system that functioned in budding yeast, higher plants, and mammals (Fig. 1C). This cotransfection system comprised a universal GFP reporter plasmid and a species-specific expression plasmid for the tTA transactivator, which is a tetracycline repressor (TetR) fused with the herpes simplex virus VP16 activation domain. The universal reporter pTUE-GFP3 encodes an enhanced GFP fused with bacterial β-glucuronidase under the control of a Tet operator-containing promoter and chimeric terminator. In the presence of the tTA transactivator, the chimeric terminator greatly facilitated the expression of the β-glucuronidase-GFP fusion protein in the three above mentioned species. We cloned DNA fragments encoding peptides into pTUE-GFP3 and assayed the nuclear import activity of the peptide fused at the C terminus of the β-glucuronidase-GFP reporter in budding yeast, suspension-cultured tobacco, and NIH3T3 cells. To determine activity levels of various NLSs, we ranked the relative levels of the nuclear import activities as one of the 10 levels (alternatively four levels) based on the localization phenotype of the GFP reporter, as explained in detail in Fig. S3. In this analysis, however, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the observed nuclear and cytoplasmic phenotypes of the GFP fusions could be due to nuclear export signals or nuclear/cytoplasmic retention signals potentially contained in fused peptides (31Bennett R.P. Presnyak V. Wedekind J.E. Smith H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7320-7327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 32Kim B.J. Kim S.Y. Lee H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30029-30038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Since these signal sequences are generally short, some screened and mutated NLS sequences could overlap with either of these signal sequences to affect their NLS activities. Optimal Consensus Patterns for Each NLS Class Determined by Amino Acid Replacement Analyses—Using this GFP expression system, we conducted amino acid replacement analyses for each class of NLS and determined relative levels of the activities in the three organisms. The analyses revealed that flanking residues and basic patterns influence NLS activity, depending on the organisms assayed (Fig. 5 and Fig. S4). For class 1 NLSs, the nonarbitrary nature of the basic pattern is consistent with the biased basic patterns observed for the selected class 1 NLSs (Fig. 2 and Fig. S4). Similar amino acid biases were observed for 189 class 2 NLSs selected by screening of a BBXB library. Most of the selected class 2 NLSs contained KRX(K/R) as a basic core, and the activity levels varied depending on the flanking residues and the organisms assayed (Fig. S5). For other noncanonical classes, the basic and flanking patterns conserved in the selected NLSs were crucial for their NLS activities. These results confirm previous observations regarding the regulatory roles of flanking sequences of the classical NLSs and furthermore demonstrate that NLS activities can significantly vary, depending on the basic patterns, flanking residues, and organisms assayed. Although these results indicate that it is difficult to determine specific consensus sequences for each NLS class, optimal consensus patterns for each NLS class are suggested to be KR(K/R)R or K(K/R)RK for class 1, (P/R)XXKR(^DE)(K/R) for class 2, KRX(W/F/Y)XXAF for class 3, (R/P)XXKR(K/R)(^DE) for class 4, and LGKR(K/R)(W/F/Y) for class 5, where (^DE) represents any amino acid except for Asp or Glu (Table 1).TABLE 1Consensus sequences of six classes of importin α-dependent NLSNLS classConsensus sequenceaSequence representation is as follows: (^DE), any amino acid except Asp or Glu; X10–12, any 10–12 amino acidsClass 1KR(K/R)R, K(K/R)RKClass 2(P/R)XXKR(^DE)(K/R)Class 3KRX(W/F/Y)XXAFClass 4(R/P)XXKR(K/R)(^DE)Class 5LGKR(K/R)(W/F/Y)BipartiteKRX10–12K(KR)(KR)bFor more optimal patterns, acidic residues should be rich in the central linker region and rare in the terminal linker region, whereas basic and hydrophobic residues should be rare in the central region and proline-rich in the terminal regionKRX10–12K(KR)X(K/R)bFor more optimal patterns, acidic residues should be rich in the central linker region and rare in the terminal linker region, whereas basic and hydrophobic residues should be rare in the central region and proline-rich in the terminal regiona Sequence representation is as follows: (^DE), any amino acid except Asp or Glu; X10–12, any 10–12 amino acidsb For more optimal patterns, acidic residues should be rich in the central linker region and rare in the terminal linker region, whereas basic and hydrophobic residues should be rare in the central region and proline-rich in the terminal region Open table in a new tab The Core Basic Residues of the Classical Class 2 NLSs Can Be Replaced by Hydrophobic Amino Acids, and KRXC-containing NLSs Exhibit Redox Sensitivity—In a class 2 NLS with a highly activating flanking sequence, the basic core residues at positions +2 and +4 could be replaced with several hydrophobic residues and asparagines (Fig. 6A), and this feature was most prominent in mammalian cells and was indeed found in several natural noncanonical NLSs from the Borna disease virus P protein (BDV-P1) (33Shoya Y.

https://openalex.org/W2002340836,"Background Intestinal parasitic infections are endemic worldwide and have been described as constituting the greatest single worldwide cause of illness and disease. Poverty, illiteracy, poor hygiene, lack of access to potable water and hot and humid tropical climate are the factors associated with intestinal parasitic infections. The study aimed to estimate prevalence and identify factors associated with intestinal parasitic infections among 1 to 5 years old children residing in an urban slum of Karachi Pakistan. Methods and Principal Findings A cross sectional survey was conducted from February to June 2006 in Ghosia Colony Gulshan Town Karachi, Pakistan. A simple random sample of 350 children aged 1–5 years was collected. The study used structured pre-tested questionnaire, anthropometric tools and stool tests to obtain epidemiological and disease data. Data were analyzed using appropriate descriptive, univariate and multivariable logistic regression methods. The mean age of participants was 2.8 years and 53% were male. The proportions of wasted, stunted and underweight children were 10.4%, 58.9% and 32.7% respectively. The prevalence of Intestinal parasitic infections was estimated to be 52.8% (95% CI: 46.1; 59.4). Giardia lamblia was the most common parasite followed by Ascaris lumbricoides, Blastocystis hominis and Hymenolepis nana. About 43% children were infected with single parasite and 10% with multiple parasites. Age {Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1; 1.9}, living in rented households (aOR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.0; 3.9) and history of excessive crying (aOR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.0; 3.4) were significantly associated with intestinal parasitic infections. Conclusions Intestinal parasites are highly prevalent in this setting and poverty was implicated as an important risk factor for infection. Effective poverty reduction programmes and promotion of deworming could reduce intestinal parasite carriage. There is a need for mass scale campaigns to create awareness about health and hygiene."
https://openalex.org/W2099797193,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a leading human bacterial pathogen capable of producing invasive infections even in previously healthy individuals. As frontline components of host innate defense, macrophages play a key role in control and clearance of GAS infections. We find GAS induces rapid, dose-dependent apoptosis of primary and cultured macrophages and neutrophils. The cell death pathway involves apoptotic caspases, is partly dependent on caspase-1, and requires GAS internalization by the phagocyte. Analysis of GAS virulence factor mutants, heterologous expression, and purified toxin studies identified the pore-forming cytolysin streptolysin O (SLO) as necessary and sufficient for the apoptosis-inducing phenotype. SLO-deficient GAS mutants induced less macrophage apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, allowed macrophage cytokine secretion, and were less virulent in a murine systemic infection model. Ultrastructural evidence of mitochondrial membrane remodeling, coupled with loss of mitochondrial depolarization and cytochrome c release, suggests a direct attack of the toxin initiates the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. A general caspase inhibitor blocked SLO-induced apoptosis and enhanced macrophage killing of GAS. We conclude that accelerated, caspase-dependent macrophage apoptosis induced by the pore-forming cytolysin SLO contributes to GAS immune evasion and virulence."
https://openalex.org/W1989563075,"Arrestins bind active phosphorylated G protein-coupled receptors, precluding G protein activation and channeling signaling to alternative pathways. Arrestins also function as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) scaffolds, bringing together three components of MAPK signaling modules. Here we have demonstrated that all four vertebrate arrestins interact with JNK3, MKK4, and ASK1, but only arrestin3 facilitates JNK3 activation. Thus, the functional specificity of arrestins is not determined by differential binding of the kinases. Using receptor binding-impaired mutant, we have shown that free arrestin3 readily promotes JNK3 phosphorylation. We identified key arrestin-binding elements in JNK3 and ASK1 and investigated the molecular interactions of arrestin2 and arrestin3 and their individual domains with the components of the two MAPK cascades, ASK1-MKK4-JNK3 and c-Raf-1-MEK1-ERK2. We found that both arrestin domains interact with all six kinases. These findings shed new light on the mechanism of arrestin-mediated MAPK activation and the spatial arrangement of the three kinases on arrestin molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1978745418,"Based on the structural information of acetylaszonalenin isolated from Neosartorya fischeri, a putative biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in the genome sequence of this fungus by genomic mining. This cluster consists of three genes coding for a putative non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (AnaPS), a prenyltransferase (AnaPT), and an acetyltransferase (AnaAT). The coding sequences of anaPT and anaAT were cloned in pQE70 and pQE60, respectively, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The soluble His6 fusion proteins were purified to near homogeneity and characterized biochemically. The structures of the enzymatic products were elucidated by NMR and mass spectroscopy analysis. AnaPT was found to catalyze the reverse prenylation of (R)-benzodiazepinedione at position C3 of the indole moiety in the presence of dimethylallyl diphosphate, resulting in formation of aszonalenin. AnaAT was found to catalyze the acetylation of aszonalenin at position N1 of the indoline moiety in the presence of acetyl coenzyme A, resulting in formation of acetylaszonalenin. Km values of AnaPT were determined for dimethylallyl diphosphate at 156 μm and for (R)-benzodiazepinedione at 232 μm. Km values of AnaAT were determined for acetyl coenzyme A at 96 μm and for aszonalenin at 61 μm.

Sun H.H. J. Nat. Prod. 1994; 57: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Computer-assisted Sequence Analysis—FGENESH and the DNASIS software package (Version 2.1: Hitachi Software Engineering, San Bruno, CA) were used for exon prediction and sequence analysis, respectively. Sequence identities were obtained by alignments of amino acid sequences using the BLAST program BLAST 2 SEQUENCES.Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Cultural Conditions for Escherichia coli—pGEMT easy vector was obtained from Promega (Mannheim, Germany), and pQE60 and pQE70 were from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany).E. coli XL1 Blue MRF′ (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands) was used for cloning and overexpression experiments and grown in liquid or on solid Luria-Bertani medium with 1.5% (w/v) agar at 37 °C. Carbenicillin (50 μg·ml–1) was used for selection of recombinant E. coli strains. N. fischeri NRRL181 was kindly provided by ARS Culture Collection (Peoria, IL).Cultivation of N. fischeri and Extraction of Secondary Metabolites—N. fischeri mycelia from agar plate was inoculated and cultivated in 300-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of modified Czapek Dox liquid medium at 30 °C without shaking (31Unso¨ld I.A. Li S.-M. Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After cultivation for 3 weeks, the cultures were extracted with ethyl acetate (100 ml). The ethyl acetate phase was evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator at 37 °C. The residue was dissolved in methanol (1 ml), analyzed, and purified on HPLC. 0.2 mg of acetylaszonalenin could be obtained from 100 ml of culture.Cultivation of N. fischeri for DNA Isolation—For DNA isolation, mycelia of N. fischeri from plates were inoculated into 300-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of YES media (yeast extract plus sucrose) consisting of yeast extract (0.6% (w/v)), sucrose 0.2% (w/v) (pH 5.8), and cultivated at 30 °C and 170 rpm for 48 h.DNA Propagation in E. coli—Standard procedures for DNA isolation and manipulation were performed as described (32Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.in: 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001: 4-35Google Scholar). DNA isolation from N. fischeri was carried out according to the protocol described by Ausubel et al. (33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.in: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 158-263Google Scholar).PCR Amplification and Gene Cloning—PCR amplification was carried out on an iCycler from BioRad. The entire coding sequence of anaPT was obtained after three rounds of PCR amplification by using genomic DNA as template and Expand High Fidelity Kit (Roche Diagnostics). The first round PCR is used for separate amplification of the two exons. The primers for the first exon were AnaPT_a1 (5′-GTCCGCAGTGTAGTAGTATACA-3′) at the 5′-end and AnaPT_a2 (5′-GTAGTGGTCTCTGCGAGGTTTCGACAAGGGTTGTTCGCATAGAGATCCTT-3′) at the 3′-end. The primers for the second exon were AnaPT_b1 (5′-GCAGTACAAGAAGGATCTCTATGCGAACAACCCTTGTCGAAACCTCGCAG-3′) at the 5′-end and AnaPT_b2 (5′-CAATTGCTACCTATGGAAGCCA-3′) at the 3′-end. Bold underlined letters represent overlapping region of two exons. The PCR products of first and the second exon were mixed in a molar ratio of 1:1 and used as template for a second round of PCR to get a fragment consisting of the two exons with help of the overlapping region. A third round PCR was then carried out by using a nested primer pair and the PCR product from the second round as template. The nested primers are AnaPT_for (5′-CTGCATGCCTCCCTTGTCTATGCAA-3′) at the 5′-end and AnaPT_rev (5′-GAAGATCTGAGATTGCCCTTCATACC-3′) at the 3′-end of the gene. Bold letters represent mutations inserted in comparison to the original genome sequence to give the underlined restriction sites SphI, located in the start codon in AnaPT_for, and BglII, located in the predicted stop codon in AnaPT_rev, respectively. A PCR fragment of 1323 bp containing the entire coding sequence of anaPT could be amplified after three rounds of PCR. The PCR fragment was cloned into pGEMT easy vector, resulting in plasmid pWY16, which was subsequently sequenced (Eurofins MWG Operon, Ebersberg, Germany) to confirm the sequence. To create the expression vector pWY22, pWY16 was digested with SphI and BglII, and the resulting SphI-BglII fragment of 1313 bp was ligated into pQE70, which had been digested with the same enzymes, previously.For the amplification of anaAT, a PCR fragment of 1540 bp containing the entire coding sequence of NFIA_055310 was amplified from the genomic DNA by using the primers AnaAT_for (5′-ATTCCATGGCCTGACCATCAGTTTC-3′) at the 5′-end and AnaAT_rev (5′-GAAGATCTTTCTTCTCCATGCCAGAAC-3′) at the 3′-end of the gene. Bold letters represent mutations inserted in comparison to the original genome sequence to give the underlined restriction sites NcoI, located at the start codon in AnaAT_for, and BglII, located at the predicted stop codon in AnaAT_rev. The PCR fragment was cloned into pGEM-Teasy vector resulting in plasmid pWY18, which was subsequently sequenced to confirm the sequence. To create the expression vector pWY23, pWY18 was digested with NcoI and BglII, and the resulting NcoI-BglII fragment of 1533 bp was ligated into pQE60, which had been digested with the same enzymes, previously.Overproduction and Purification of His6-AnaPT and His6-AnaAT—For anaPT expression, E. coli XL1 Blue MRF′ cells harboring the plasmid pWY22 were cultivated in 300-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of liquid Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with carbenicillin (50 μgml–1) and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.7. For induction, isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the cells were cultivated for further 6 h at 37 °C before harvest. The bacterial cultures were centrifuged, and the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm imidazole, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl (pH 8.0)) at 2–5 ml/g wet weight. After the addition of 1 mg ml–1 lysozyme and incubation on ice for 30 min, the cells were sonicated 6 times for 10 s each at 200 watts. To separate the cellular debris from the soluble proteins, the lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. One-step purification of the recombinant His6-tagged fusion protein by affinity chromatography with Ni-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen) was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl (pH 8.0). To change the buffer, the protein fraction was passed through a NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare) which had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 15% (v/v) of glycerol (pH 7.5) previously. AnaPT was eluted with the same buffer and stored frozen at –80 °C for enzyme assays.For anaAT expression, E. coli XL1 Blue MRF′ cells harboring the plasmid pWY23 were cultivated in 300-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of liquid Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with carbenicillin (50 μgml–1) and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6. For induction, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.7 mm, and the cells were cultivated for further 16 h at 37 °C before harvest. Protein purification was carried out in analogy to AnaPT.Protein Analysis—Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206038) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250.Determination of Molecular Mass of Active His6-AnaPT and Active His6-AnaAT—The molecular mass of the recombinant His6-AnaPT and His6-AnaPT was determined by gel filtration on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl. The column was calibrated with dextran blue 2000 (2000 kDa), conalbumin (75 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) (GE Healthcare). The proteins were eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl. The molecular mass of the recombinant His6-AnaPT was determined as 162.2 kDa. This indicated that AnaPT acts likely as a tetramer. The molecular mass of the recombinant His6-AnaAT was determined as 43 kDa. This indicated that AnaAT acts as a monomer.Assay for AnaPT and AnaAT Activity—For quantitative determination of the AnaPT activity, the reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm CaCl2, 1 mm (R)-benzodiazepinedione, 1 mm DMAPP, 1.5% (v/v) glycerol, and 1.0 μg of purified recombinant AnaPT. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and the reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of methanol per 100 μl of reaction mixtures. The protein was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The enzymatic products were analyzed by HPLC under the conditions described below. For quantitative measurement of the enzyme activity, duplicate values were determined routinely. The assays for determination of the kinetic parameters (100 μl) of (R)-benzodiazepinedione contained 1 mm DMAPP, 0.5 μg of AnaPT, and (R)-benzodiazepinedione at final concentrations of 0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mm. The incubation time was 30 min. For determination of kinetic parameters of DMAPP, (R)-benzodiazepinedione at 1 mm and DMAPP at final concentrations of 0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mm were used.For quantitative determination of the AnaAT activity, the reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm CaCl2, 1 mm aszonalenin, 1 mm acetyl coenzyme A, 1.5% (v/v) glycerol, and 1.0 μg of purified recombinant AnaAT. The incubation and termination conditions were identical to those for AnaPT. The assays for determination of the kinetic parameters (100 μl) of aszonalenin contained 1 mm acetyl coenzyme A, 1 μg of AnaAT, and aszonalenin at final concentrations of 0.0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.2. The incubation time was 30 min. For determination of kinetic parameters of acetyl coenzyme A, aszonalenin at 1 mm and acetyl coenzyme A at final concentrations of 0.0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mm were used.Preparative Synthesis of Enzymatic Products for Structural Elucidation—AnaPT assay for isolation of the enzymatic product (10 ml) contained DMAPP (1 mm), (R)-benzodiazepinedione (1 mm), CaCl2 (10 mm), Tris-HCl (50 mm (pH 7.5)), glycerol 1.5% (v/v), and AnaPT (0.8 mg). AnaAT assay for isolation of the enzymatic product (10 ml) contained acetyl coenzyme A (1 mm), aszonalenin (1 mm), Tris-HCl (50 mm (pH 7.5)), glycerol 1.5% (v/v), and AnaAT (0.8 mg). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h and extracted subsequently with ethyl acetate. After evaporation of the solvent, the residues were dissolved in methanol and purified on HPLC under the conditions described below. 2.8 mg of aszonalenin and 1.5 mg of acetylaszonalenin could be obtained from the AnaPT and AnaAT incubations, respectively. The isolated products were subjected to 1H NMR, 13C NMR, H-H COSY, C-H COSY as well as positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry with a ThermoFinnigan TSQ Quantum. The mass spectrometer was coupled with an Agilent HPLC series 1100 equipped with a RP18 column (250 × 2 mm, 5 μm). For separation, the column was run with 10% (v/v) solvent B (CH3OH) in solvent A (H2O) (each containing 0.1% (v/v) HCOOH) for 5 min followed by a gradient from 10% (v/v) to 100% B over 30 min. After washing with 100% B for 10 min, the column was equilibrated with 10% (v/v) B for 10 min. The flow rate was at 0.2 ml·min–1.HPLC Conditions for Analysis and Isolation of Enzymatic Products of AnaPT and AnaAT—The enzymatic products of the incubation mixtures of AnaPT and AnaAT were analyzed by HPLC on an Agilent series 1200 by using a LiChrospher RP 18–5 column (125 × 4 mm, 5 μm, Agilent) at a flow rate of 1 ml·min–1. 50% methanol in water (solvent A) and methanol (solvent B) were used as solvents. For analysis of enzymatic products, a linear gradient of 10–50% (v/v) solvent B in 15 min was used. The column was then washed with 100% solvent B for 5 min and equilibrated with 10% (v/v) solvent A for 5 min. Detection was carried out by a photodiode array detector and illustrated at 254 nm in the figures in this paper.For isolation, the same HPLC equipment with a Multospher 120 RP-18 column (250 × 10 mm, 5 μm, C+S Chromatographie Service, Langenfeld, Germany) was used. A linear gradient of 30–70% (v/v) solvent B in 12 min at a flow rate of 2.5 ml·min–1 was used. The column was then washed with 100% solvent B for 8 min and equilibrated with 30% (v/v) solvent A for 5 min.

To expand the usage of this strategy, indole derivatives should be isolated and identified from fungal strains, whose genome sequences are available. HPLC analysis of the ethyl acetate extracts of 3-week-old cultures of N. fischeri NRRL181 showed a dominant peak at 10.9 min (Fig. 2) with a typical UV spectrum of indole derivatives (data not shown). This compound was isolated on a preparative scale and subjected to 1H NMR and MS analysis. 1H NMR spectrum showed clearly signals for a reverse prenyl moiety at 5.89 (1H, dd, 17.4, 10.4 Hz), 5.14 (1H, d, 10.4 Hz), 5.13 (1H, d, 17.4, Hz), 1.19 (3H, s), and 0.99 (3H, s) ppm (Table 1) (37Ruan H.-L. Yin W.-B. Wu J.-Z. Li S.-M. Chembiochem. 2008; 9: 1044-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This was also confirmed by H-H COSY analysis (data not shown). A singlet for three protons at 2.59 ppm could be assigned for an acetyl group. A three-spin system at 3.90 (1H, t, 8.4 Hz), 3.37 (1H, dd, 13.9, 8.5 Hz), and 2.44 (1H, dd, 13.9, 8.2 Hz) ppm was typical for the three protons at α and β positions of aromatic amino acids such as tryptophan or its dipeptides (37Ruan H.-L.

In addition, two aromatic systems with four coupled protons each were also observed (Table 1). A literature search revealed that the NMR data of the isolated compound corresponded very well to those of acetylaszonalenin (3Ellestad G.A. Mirando P. Kunstmann M.P. J. Org.

Acetylaszonalenin is chemically a cyclic dipeptide derivative of tryptophan and anthranilic acid which is acetylated at position N1 and prenylated at position C3 of the indoline ring. It could be expected that at least three genes/enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of acetylaszonalenin, i.e. a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase for the formation of the cyclic dipeptide (40Maiya S.

The formation of the ring system between the indoline and the diketopiperazine ring would require an additional enzyme or would be catalyzed during the prenylation by the prenyltransferase.Indeed, a 12.8-kilobase DNA segment consisting of three genes and spanning bp 130,585–143,349 of AAKE03000024.1 could be identified on chromosome of N. fischeri NRRL181 by homologous search and sequence analysis (Fig. 3A).

https://openalex.org/W2033693969,"Background Septic patients treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) often develop multiple organ failure including persistent skeletal muscle dysfunction which results in the patient's protracted recovery process. We have demonstrated that muscle mitochondrial enzyme activities are impaired in septic ICU patients impairing cellular energy balance, which will interfere with muscle function and metabolism. Here we use detailed phenotyping and genomics to elucidate mechanisms leading to these impairments and the molecular consequences. Methodology/Principal Findings Utilising biopsy material from seventeen patients and ten age-matched controls we demonstrate that neither mitochondrial in vivo protein synthesis nor expression of mitochondrial genes are compromised. Indeed, there was partial activation of the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway involving NRF2α/GABP and its target genes TFAM, TFB1M and TFB2M yet clearly this failed to maintain mitochondrial function. We therefore utilised transcript profiling and pathway analysis of ICU patient skeletal muscle to generate insight into the molecular defects driving loss of muscle function and metabolic homeostasis. Gene ontology analysis of Affymetrix analysis demonstrated substantial loss of muscle specific genes, a global oxidative stress response related to most probably cytokine signalling, altered insulin related signalling and a substantial overlap between patients and muscle wasting/inflammatory animal models. MicroRNA 21 processing appeared defective suggesting that post-transcriptional protein synthesis regulation is altered by disruption of tissue microRNA expression. Finally, we were able to demonstrate that the phenotype of skeletal muscle in ICU patients is not merely one of inactivity, it appears to be an actively remodelling tissue, influenced by several mediators, all of which may be open to manipulation with the aim to improve clinical outcome. Conclusions/Significance This first combined protein and transcriptome based analysis of human skeletal muscle obtained from septic patients demonstrated that losses of mitochondria and muscle mass are accompanied by sustained protein synthesis (anabolic process) while dysregulation of transcription programmes appears to fail to compensate for increased damage and proteolysis. Our analysis identified both validated and novel clinically tractable targets to manipulate these failing processes and pursuit of these could lead to new potential treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2038208558,"Background The androgen receptor (AR) is a steroid-activated transcription factor that binds at specific DNA locations and plays a key role in the etiology of prostate cancer. While numerous studies have identified a clear connection between AR binding and expression of target genes for a limited number of loci, high-throughput elucidation of these sites allows for a deeper understanding of the complexities of this process. Methodology/Principal Findings We have mapped 189 AR occupied regions (ARORs) and 1,388 histone H3 acetylation (AcH3) loci to a 3% continuous stretch of human genomic DNA using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) microarray analysis. Of 62 highly reproducible ARORs, 32 (52%) were also marked by AcH3. While the number of ARORs detected in prostate cancer cells exceeded the number of nearby DHT-responsive genes, the AcH3 mark defined a subclass of ARORs much more highly associated with such genes – 12% of the genes flanking AcH3+ARORs were DHT-responsive, compared to only 1% of genes flanking AcH3−ARORs. Most ARORs contained enhancer activities as detected in luciferase reporter assays. Analysis of the AROR sequences, followed by site-directed ChIP, identified binding sites for AR transcriptional coregulators FoxA1, CEBPβ, NFI and GATA2, which had diverse effects on endogenous AR target gene expression levels in siRNA knockout experiments. Conclusions/Significance We suggest that only some ARORs function under the given physiological conditions, utilizing diverse mechanisms. This diversity points to differential regulation of gene expression by the same transcription factor related to the chromatin structure."

Disulfide bonds play an essential role in the folding and assembly of secretory proteins and membrane proteins. The formation of non-natural disulfide bonds leads to protein mis-folding and further aggregation. Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes possess specialized cellular compartments in which disulfide bonds are formed, complete with enzymes devoted to catalyzing disulfide formation and rearrangement (1Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 797-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).

PDI comprises four thioredoxin (Trx) domains, two catalytic domains, a (9–116) and a′ (352–462), separated by two homologous non-catalytic domains, b (120–217) and b′ (219–332), plus a C-terminal region (463–491). In addition, there is a short linker region “x” (333–351) between the b′ and a′ domains (4Tian G. Xiang S. Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. Schindelin H.

As an abundant multifunctional protein within the lumen of the ER, PDI acts as both an enzyme and a chaperone in many physiological processes (6Yao Y. Zhou Y.C. Wang C.C.

PDI can act in vitro to catalyze both protein-disulfide isomerization and net protein disulfide formation, but the latter process requires a further source of oxidizing equivalents to reoxidize PDI. Hence a net source of oxidizing equivalents is required in vivo to sustain formation of protein disulfides and oxidative protein folding. Ero1p was found to be directly responsible for the production of disulfide bonds in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ER (9Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 10Pollard M.G. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The catalytic cycle carried out by Ero1p involves direct oxidation of PDI by the shuttle cysteine pair (Cys100-Cys105), and re-oxidation of the reduced shuttle cysteine residues through internal dithiol-disulfide exchange with the active site (Cys352-Cys355). The latter are re-oxidized by transfer of their electrons to the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor and further to molecular oxygen, resulting in the formation of hydrogen peroxide. Ero1p activity can be modulated through the redox state of two non-essential “regulatory” cysteine pairs (Cys90-Cys349 and Cys150-Cys295) by controlling the range of motion for the shuttle-cysteine-containing loop region (11Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, there are two homologues of Ero1p, Ero1-Lα, and Ero1-Lβ, which show different tissue distribution and transcriptional regulation (12Cabibbo A. Pagani M. Fabbri M. Rocchi M.

Both Ero1-Lα and Ero1-Lβ accelerate oxidative protein folding in the ER of human cells through their action on PDI (14Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Although it was suggested, by analogy to the case in Ero1p, that the two conserved cysteine triads (Cys85-Cys94-Cys99 and Cys391-Cys394-Cys397) in Ero1-Lα molecule may cooperate in electron transfer (15Bertoli G.

Indeed, very little work has been reported on the reconstitution of this process in vitro. In this work, we report that Ero1-Lα utilizes oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor, producing one disulfide bond and one molecule of hydrogen peroxide using the prosthetic group FAD as an electron transfer component. Furthermore, we have reconstituted the in vitro Ero1-Lα/hPDI oxidative folding system, and demonstrated by mutagenesis studies on hPDI and domain-swapped hPDI (DShPDI) that the a and a′ domains of hPDI have distinct activities in Ero1-Lα-mediated oxidative folding and that this is primarily due to their positions in the PDI molecule. Calorimetry and pull-down determinations revealed that the b′xa′ region is the minimal fragment of hPDI that is able to bind with Ero1-Lα. Our studies provide insights into the interaction of these two important catalysts of the mammalian oxidative protein folding machine.

Sitia, Universitá Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Minalo, Italy) was inserted into pGEX-6P-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) at BamHI and XhoI sites. The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Ero1-Lα fusion construct was expressed in BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen). Cultures were grown in 2 liters of 2× YT medium at 37 °C for 4 h and shaken for an additional 20 h at 25 °C after isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 40 μm. The supernatant of the cell lysate was applied onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3). After washing with 5–10 column volumes of PBS, the GST-Ero1-Lα fusion protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm GSH, pH 8.0. The elution was dialyzed against buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH7.6) to remove GSH, and then digested with 100 μl (200 units) of PreScission Protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences) at 4 °C for 4 h followed by chromatography on a glutathione 4 Fast Flow column pre-equilibrated with buffer A to remove the GST moiety and the PreScission Protease. The flow-through was concentrated and stored as aliquots in buffer A at –80 °C. The final purified Ero1-Lα protein has an additional GPLGS pentapeptide at the N terminus after removing the GST tag. Recombinant full-length hPDI was purified as described (16Li S.J. Hong X.G. Shi Y.Y. Li H. Wang C.C. J. Biol.

All other hPDI and DShPDI mutants were constructed by overlap extension PCR using pQE30-hPDI plasmid as a template and subsequently inserted into pQE30 vector (Qiagen). The mutated proteins, containing an N-terminal His tag (MRGSHHHHHHGS), were expressed and purified using the same protocol as for the full-length hPDI. The sequences of all the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard (17Bradford M.M. Anal.

Oxygen Consumption Assay—Escherichia coli Trx (a kind gift from Dr. Xi Wang in this group) was reduced by DTT as described (18Gross E. Sevier C.S. Heldman N. Vitu E. Bentzur M. Kaiser C.A. Thorpe C.

Oxygen consumption was measured by using an Oxygraph Clark-type oxygen electrode (Hansatech Instruments). All components of each reaction, except Ero1-Lα, were fresh mixed in a total volume of 0.5 ml, and the reaction was initiated by injection of Ero1-Lα into the reaction vessel of the oxygen electrode. For detection of hydrogen peroxide, 5 μl of catalase at 2 mg/ml was injected into the reaction vessel at 10 min, when the thiol oxidation reaction was complete. All experiments were performed in buffer B (100 mm Tris-HAc, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). RNase A Assay—Denatured and reduced RNase A was prepared as described (19Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). RNase A reactivation was assayed quantitatively by monitoring the absorbance increase at 296 nm at 25 °C due to the hydrolysis of cCMP, and the isomerase and oxidoreductase activities of hPDI proteins are calculated as previously reported (20Wang L.K. Wang L. Vavassori S. Li S.J. Ke H.M. Anelli T. Degano M. Ronzoni R. Sitia R. Sun F. Wang C.C. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 642-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The relative activity (%) was calculated as (A-A0)/(A1-A0) × 100%, where A, activity of hPDI mutants or DShPDI mutants; A1, activity of hPDI or DShPDI; A0, activity of hPDIC1/2 or DShPDIC1/2, respectively. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. (n = 3). Gel-based RNase A re-oxidation analyses were performed by addition of Ero1-Lα, hPDI, and/or FAD into buffer B containing 15 μm denatured and reduced RNase A. At the indicated time points, free thiols were blocked by the addition of 6× SDS-loading buffer containing 12 mm 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′ disulfonic acid (AMS, invitrogen). The oxidized and reduced forms of RNase A were detected by Coomassie Blue staining after non-reducing SDS-PAGE. GST-Pull-down Assay—GST-Ero1-Lα fusion protein on glutathione-Sepharose resin was incubated with hPDI proteins for 2 h at 4 °C in PBS, washed with PBS for three times, and bound proteins were detected by Coomassie Blue staining after reducing SDS-PAGE. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) Measurement—Thermodynamic parameters associated with the reactions between hPDI proteins and Ero1-Lα were measured on a VP-ITC titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.) at 25 °C. A solution of 12 μm Ero1-Lα was loaded into the sample cell (1.43 ml), and a solution of 75–120 μm hPDI proteins was placed in the injection syringe (295.7 μl). The first injection (5 μl) was followed by 29 injections of 10 μl. Dilution heats of the hPDI proteins were measured by injecting the hPDI proteins into buffer alone and were subtracted from the experimental curves prior to data analysis. Data were analyzed using MicroCal ORIGIN software supplied with the instrument. All experiments were performed in buffer A. The stirring rate was 300 rpm. Characterization of Ero1-Lα—After cleavage of the GST tag, the Ero1-Lα protein was bright yellow; it exhibited a single band of about 55 kDa on reducing SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1) and two peaks, corresponding to apparent molecular mass of 44 kDa and 100 kDa, respectively, on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column, indicating that the preparation is largely composed of monomer with less than 20% dimer (Fig. 1A). Because the content of dimer decreased but did not disappear after DTT treatment, the dimer is mainly a disulfide-linked homodimer with a small fraction of non-covalent homodimer (also see supplemental Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 1B, the absorption of Ero1-Lα preparation exhibits a typical unresolved flavin spectrum with the maximum absorbance at 454 nm with a shoulder at 485 nm and another peak at ∼370 nm, in addition to the protein peak at 280 nm. Each Ero1-Lα molecule contains 0.9 FAD determined by using the extinction coefficient of 12.5 mm–1 cm–1 at 454 nm (18Gross E. Sevier C.S. Heldman N. Vitu E. Bentzur M. Kaiser C.A. Thorpe C. Fass D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Dialysis of Ero1-Lα against 2 mm EDTA buffer revealed that FAD binds tenaciously to the enzyme. After treatment by 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, the spectrum became like that of free FAD indicated by the shift of the maximum absorbance from 454 nm to ∼447 nm and disappearance of the shoulder at 485 nm. As shown in Fig. 1C the absorbance at 454 nm of 10 μm Ero1-Lα started decreasing after 4 min of 2 mm DTT treatment, suggesting the reduction of bound FAD to FADH2. The lag corresponds to the time required to remove solution-dissolved oxygen. In contrast, no absorbance change was detected for 10 μm free FAD over the course of the experiment. The results indicated that electrons can be transferred from reducing agent to Ero1-Lα-bound FAD but not to free FAD. Thus, Ero1-Lα contains an equimolar FAD as its prosthetic group, and the bound FAD is redox active. Oxygen Is Reduced to Form Hydrogen Peroxide during Ero1-Lα-catalyzed Thiol Oxidation—There were conflicting reports on whether hydrogen peroxide was a byproduct of the thiol oxidation driven by yeast Ero1p (18Gross E. Sevier C.S. Heldman N. Vitu E. Bentzur M. Kaiser C.A. Thorpe C. Fass D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 21Tu B.P. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 983-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). We monitored the oxygen consumption of a system containing Ero1-Lα and thiol reagents. As shown in Fig. 2A, a drop of 49 μm oxygen (after subtracting the background oxygen consumption by a nonenzymatic reaction) was detected during Ero1-Lα-catalyzed oxidation of 50 μm reduced E. coli Trx (Trxred), and addition of catalase at 10 min restored 20 μm oxygen in the solution, indicating a production of 40 μm hydrogen peroxide (2H2O2 → 2H2O + O2). Thus, the general reaction (2R-SH + O2 → R-S-S-R + H2O2) catalyzed by flavoprotein sulfhydryl oxidases applies also to Ero1-Lα. Table 1 compares the catalytic activities of our recombinant Ero1-Lα with recombinant Ero1p. GSH is a rather poor substrate of Ero1-Lα, similar to Ero1p (22Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), while DTT and Trxred are good substrates of Ero1-Lα. The Km for oxygen was determined by observing the rate of reaction as oxygen was depleted from the system (Fig. 2B). The low Km of 5 μm for oxygen is similar to that of Ero1p (Table 1), suggesting that Ero1-Lα can function efficiently at low oxygen tension, minimizing the risk of reductive stress in the ER. Moreover, the turnover number of Ero1-Lα for oxygen is about 3-fold that of Ero1p.TABLE 1Comparison of substrate kinetics of Ero1-Lα and Ero1pEro1-LαEro1pkcatakcat are expressed in terms of oxygen molecules consumed per min.

Open table in a new tab Effect of Exogenous FAD on the Reaction Catalyzed by Ero1-Lα—Ero1p purified from yeast has been reported to be active only in the presence of exogenous FAD (21Tu B.P.

Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), however, two C-terminal-truncated Ero1p mutants expressed in E. coli showed activity without addition of FAD (18Gross E. Sevier C.S. Heldman N. Vitu E. Bentzur M. Kaiser C.A. Thorpe C. Fass D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of exogenous FAD on the activity of recombinant Ero1-Lα using oxygen consumption assay. As shown in Fig. 3, the presence of 100 μm exogenous FAD did not affect the oxygen consumption rate in Ero1-Lα-catalyzed oxidation of either 50 μm Trxred or 10 mm DTT. Also, exogenous FAD was not required for the reactivation of RNase A driven by Ero1-Lα (see below). Hence the FAD found bound to recombinant Ero1-Lα is fully functional. Reconstitution of the Ero1-Lα/hPDI Oxidative Folding Pathway in Vitro—By monitoring the reactivation of denatured and reduced RNase A, which requires the formation of four specific disulfides necessary for its activity, we reconstituted the Ero1-Lα/hPDI system in vitro, and attempted to resolve the isomerase and oxidoreductase activities of hPDI in this system. As shown in Fig. 4A, either Ero1-Lα or hPDI alone did not promote reactivation of RNase A. The presence of Ero1-Lα and hPDI together did catalyze reactivation of RNase A, and the reactivation rate increased with increasing concentrations of Ero1-Lα. Exogenous FAD is not required for the reactivation of RNase A in this system. The direct observation of distribution of reduced and oxidized RNase A during reactivation (Fig. 4B) supported the above results. The data show that the reactivation of RNase A results from the oxidative formation of disulfide bonds, which requires both hPDI as catalyst and either Ero1-Lα or a glutathione buffer to deliver oxidizing equivalents. The transfer of oxidizing equivalents in the system of Ero1-Lα/hPDI is similar to what has been observed in the case of Ero1p (22Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We then isolated the monomer Ero1-Lα fraction by gel filtration and subsequently assayed this monomer fraction in the reconstituted system. The monomer Ero1-Lα is somewhat more active than the unfractionated preparation (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating that the monomer fraction contributes the dominating activities in our Ero1-Lα preparation and the dimer fraction is either inactive or less active than the monomer fraction. However, this does not exclude the possibility that Ero1-Lα homodimer could have a potential function in vivo, which needs further investigation and is beyond the scope of this research. The experiments shown in Fig. 4A represent a one-pot assay in which reduced RNase A is oxidized and re-activated, and the active RNase A then hydrolyzes its substrate, giving rise to a change in absorbance; the data shown represent the instantaneous RNase A activity as a function of time (19Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 23Wilkinson B. Xiao R. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11483-11487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The data show a lag phase followed by a period in which RNase A activity increases linearly. The lag is interpreted as a period during which reduced RNase A is oxidized to produce a mix of inactive disulfide isomers, while the linear phase represents isomerization of these species to native active RNase A. We have calculated the rate of RNase A reactivation (essentially the isomerase activity of hPDI) by measuring the rate of increase of RNase A activity during the linear phase, and the rate of RNase A oxidation (the oxidoreductase activity of the complete system) by measuring the reciprocal of the lag time before the appearance of active RNase A. As shown in Fig. 4C, increasing concentrations of Ero1-Lα significantly enhanced the oxidoreductase activity, but did not significantly influence the isomerase activity of hPDI. The isomerase and oxidoreductase activities of hPDI in the presence of the optimal glutathione redox buffer (1 mm GSH/0.2 mm GSSG) are shown in Fig. 4C for comparison, and it is apparent that the isomerase activity is approximately invariant and is basically independent of the nature of the source of oxidizing equivalents. Ero1-Lα-mediated and hPDI-catalyzed Oxidative Folding Is Strongly Influenced by the Positions of Catalytic Trx Domains in hPDI—To explore the structural and functional requirements for the interaction of hPDI with Ero1-Lα, we examined the reactivation of RNase A in the reconstituted system containing Ero1-Lα and different hPDI domain combinations and mutants (Fig. 5, upper panel). The activities of the various PDI constructs were studied in the presence either of the glutathione redox buffer or of Ero1-Lα. In the optimal glutathione redox buffer, hPDI-ΔC showed similar activities to those of the full-length hPDI. Those constructs that contain only one intact dithiol active site (hPDI-bb′xa′ and hPDI-abb′x) or one intact site plus one -CGHC-mutated to -SGHS-(hPDIC1 and hPDIC2), all showed similar abilities to catalyze the reactivation of RNase A. Hence, all combinations of one active Trx domain plus the core bb′x region showed roughly equivalent isomerase and oxidoreductase activities in GSH/GSSG-driven oxidative protein folding. The single domains (hPDI-a and hPDI-a′c) showed low oxidoreductase activity (<20%) and very low isomerase activity (<5%). The mutant full-length PDI with two active sites both mutated to -SGHS-(hPDIC1/2) showed no activity at all and was taken as a negative control. In the system in which Ero1-Lα supplied the oxidative equivalents, hPDI-ΔC did not show any inferiority to the full-length hPDI, indicating that the C-terminal tail is not involved in the interaction with Ero1-Lα. However, in this system, the various constructs containing a single redox-active Trx domain were not equivalent in activity, in contrast to the situation with the glutathione system as oxidant. Absence of domain a′ (hPDI-abb′x) or mutation of the active site in domain a′ (hPDIC2) decreased the activity markedly (to <10% of wild-type). Conversely, hPDI-bb′xa′ and hPDIC1 with the active site in domain a′ intact are both ∼50% active as wild-type, suggesting that the a′ domain is responsible for the dominating flow of electrons to Ero1-Lα. Moreover, the single domains (hPDI-a and hPDI-a′c) did not show any detectable activity in this system. The difference between domains a and a′ of hPDI in Ero1-Lα-mediated oxidative folding is not likely a result of their distinct abilities to interact with the RNase A substrate or facilitate RNase A reactivation, since they behave similarly in the optimal glutathione redox buffer (Fig. 5, upper panel). Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the difference arises from their interaction with Ero1-Lα and may depend either on some intrinsic difference between the domains or on their position, i.e. whether the active Trx domain is located N-terminal or C-terminal of the bb′x fragment. To distinguish between these factors, we produced a series of DShPDI combinations and mutants (Fig. 5, lower panel), with the a and a′ domains exchanged positionally. Because DShPDI showed defective activity compared with hPDI we then took the activity of DSh-PDI as 100% for evaluating the activities of all DShPDI proteins. In the optimal glutathione redox buffer, compared with DShP-DIC1/2 with both active sites mutated, DShPDI-bb′xa and DShPDI-a′bb′x were both able to promote RNase A reactivation, and the former is about 3-fold more active than the latter. Similar to the case in un-swapped proteins, addition of an inactive a′ or a domain in the “swapped position” to one of these constructs (DShPDIC1 and DShPDIC2) does not enhance nor reduce activity further. In Ero1-Lα-mediated oxidative folding, DShPDI-bb′xa is over 10-fold more active than DShPDI-a′bb′x, and again the addition of the missing domain in mutated form has little effect. All the above results strongly suggest that either domain a or a′ is able to donate electrons to Ero1-Lα, provided that it is in the position to the C-terminal of the bb′x fragment of hPDI, but operates much less efficiently if in the position to the N-terminal of bb′x. b′xa′ of hPDI Is the Minimal Element for Binding with Ero1-Lα—We have further investigated the direct interaction of hPDI proteins and Ero1-Lα by GST-pull-down assay. As shown in Fig. 6, full-length hPDI and hPDI-ΔC strongly interacted with Ero1-Lα, whereas hPDI-bb′xa′ and hPDI-b′xa′ bound to Ero1-Lα to a lesser extent, and other mutants did not show interaction with Ero1-Lα, consistent with the result obtained by RNase A refolding assay (Fig. 5). The above results indicated that b′xa′ is the minimal element for efficient interaction with Ero1-Lα. In addition, hPDI-b′xa′ showed similar enzymatic activities to hPDI-bb′xa′ in the Ero1-Lα-mediated oxidative refolding of RNase A (Fig. 5). ITC was then used to describe quantitatively the interaction between Ero1-Lα and hPDI (Fig. 7). The binding of hPDI with Ero1-Lα is an exothermic reaction (Fig. 7A), showing favorable van der Waals, hydrogen bond, and electrostatic interactions (24Kozlov G. Maa"

Supplementation with choline during embryonic days (E) 11–17 in rats improves memory performance in adulthood and protects against age-related memory decline, whereas choline deficiency impairs certain cognitive functions. We previously reported that global and gene-specific DNA methylation increased in choline-deficient fetal brain and liver, and these changes in DNA methylation correlated with an apparently compensatory up-regulation of the expression of DNA methyltransferase <i>Dnmt1</i>. In the current study, pregnant rats were fed a diet containing varying amounts of choline (mmol/kg: 0 (deficient), 8 (control), or 36 (supplemented)) during E11–17, and indices of histone methylation were assessed in liver and frontal cortex on E17. The mRNA and protein expression of histone methyltransferases G9a and Suv39h1 were directly related to the availability of choline. DNA methylation of the <i>G9a</i> and <i>Suv39h1</i> genes was up-regulated by choline deficiency, suggesting that the expression of these enzymes is under negative control by methylation of their genes. The levels of H3K9Me2 and H3K27Me3, tags of transcriptionally repressed chromatin, were up-regulated by choline supplementation, whereas the levels of H3K4Me2, associated with active promoters, were highest in choline-deficient rats. These data show that maternal choline supply during pregnancy modifies fetal histone and DNA methylation, suggesting that a concerted epigenomic mechanism contributes to the long term developmental effects of varied choline intake <i>in utero</i>."

Remarkable degrees of protection against coronary heart disease were observed in humans heterozygous for the mutations Y142X and C679X (88% reduced incidence) and by R46L (47% reduced incidence) (7Cohen J.C.

Consequently, PCSK9 represents a novel therapeutic target for the prevention of premature atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease, and an understanding of its mechanism of action is of significant medical interest. PCSK9 is the ninth member of the mammalian proprotein convertase family of serine proteases. The translated proprotein includes an N-terminal signal sequence directing its secretion (residues 1-30), a prodomain (residues 31-152), a catalytic domain (residues 153-451), and a cysteine-rich C-terminal domain (residues 452-692) (8Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J. Jasmin S.B. Stifani S. Basak A. Prat A. Chretien M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). PCSK9 undergoes autocleavage in the endoplasmic reticulum, and only the processed form is secreted (8Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J. Jasmin S.B. Stifani S. Basak A. Prat A.

The autocleavage event occurs between residues Gln-152 and Ser-153 and is dependent on a canonical triad of catalytic residues (Asp-186, His-226, and Ser-386). Unlike other members of the proprotein convertase family, following autocleavage the PCSK9 prodomain remains associated with the catalytic and C-terminal domains of the protein. The three-dimensional structure of this stable PCSK9 heterodimer as determined by x-ray crystallography reveals a large noncovalent interface between the prodomain and the catalytic domain (10Cunningham D.

A noteworthy feature of the interaction is that after autocleavage the C-terminal residues of the prodomain occupy the active site of the catalytic domain inhibiting further enzymatic activity by PCSK9. PCSK9 is expressed predominantly in the liver, small intestine, and kidney (8Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J. Jasmin S.B. Stifani S. Basak A. Prat A. Chretien M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Recently, several independent groups have shown that processed PCSK9 binds to the LDL receptor (LDLR) and decreases total and cell surface LDLR levels by directing the receptor to the lysosomes for degradation (13Horton J.D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 71-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Although an intracellular mechanism preceding secretion is not formally excluded, the introduction of PCSK9 into the circulation of mice through parabiosis reduces hepatic LDLR levels (14Lagace T.A.

This in vivo study is further supported by in vitro experiments in which the addition of PCSK9 to cultured cell medium results in LDLR degradation (9Cameron J. Holla O.L. Ranheim T.

Prior to its degradation, the PCSK9-LDLR complex is internalized by endocytosis in a manner dependent on clathrin (18Nassoury N. Blasiole D.A. Tebon Oler A. Benjannet S. Hamelin J. Poupon V. McPherson P.S. Attie A.D. Prat A. Seidah N.G. Traffic. 2007; 8: 718-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and on the association of a cytosolic region of the LDLR with the ARH protein (14Lagace T.A. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. McNutt M.C.

A plausible mechanism of action leading to LDLR degradation rather than its vesicular recycling has been proposed following binding studies demonstrating that PCSK9 binds the LDLR ectodomain with ∼100-fold higher affinity at the acidic pH of late endosomes/lysosomes compared with the neutral pH of the cell surface (10Cunningham D. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Griffor M.C. Hawkins J.L. Subashi T.A. Varghese A.H. Ammirati M.J. Culp J.S. Hoth L.R. Mansour M.N. McGrath K.M. Seddon A.P. Shenolikar S. Stutzman-Engwall K.J. Warren L.C.

The enhanced affinity at acidic pH suggests that, differently from the LDLR-LDL complex, the LDLR-PCSK9 complex does not dissociate in the endosomes, thus preventing LDLR recycling and instead leading to shuttling of the complex to the lysosomes for degradation. Of note, the PCSK9D374Y mutant (a “gain-of-function” (GOF) mutant associated with hypercholesterolemia) was shown to bind the LDLR with 6-30-fold higher affinity than wild type (WT) PCSK9, supporting the notion that a tight interaction between PCSK9 and LDLR promotes degradation of the receptor. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analyses were used by Hobbs and colleagues (19Zhang D.W. Lagace T.A. Garuti R. Zhao Z. McDonald M. Horton J.D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18602-18612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) to demonstrate that the epidermal growth factor-like repeat A (EGF(A)) of the LDLR is sufficient for PCSK9 binding. Recently, the x-ray crystal structure of the PCSK9-EGF(AB) complex, crystallized at pH 4.8, was also reported (20Kwon H.J. Lagace T.A. McNutt M.C. Horton J.D. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 1820-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Here we extend these data by characterizing the interaction, at both neutral and acidic pH, of the LDLR ectodomain and of the EGF(A) and EGF(AB) repeats of the LDLR with both full-length PCSK9 and a form of PCSK9 lacking the C-terminal domain (PCSK9ΔC). Moreover, we present the neutral pH x-ray crystal structure of WT PCSK9ΔC bound to EGF(AB) and the structures of mutant forms of these proteins associated with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), including EGF(AB) bound to PCSK9ΔCD374Y and PCSK9ΔCD374H, and of WT PCSK9ΔC bound to EGF(AB)H306Y (21Naoumova R.P.

Further, comparisons of the previously reported low pH PCSK9EGF(AB) complex structure with the structures reported here, and accompanying binding data, provide the molecular basis for the pH dependence of the PCSK9-EGF(A) interaction. Finally, we characterize the inhibitory properties of the isolated EGF repeats in a cellular LDL uptake assay demonstrating that in vitro these LDLR subfragments are sufficient to inhibit the LDLR-lowering activity mediated by PCSK9. Full-length human PCSK9 with C-terminal V5 and His6 epitope tags was cloned into the pcDNA3.1-F1-WT plasmid and expressed in stably transfected HEK293 cell lines as described previously (17Fisher T.S. Lo Surdo P. Pandit S. Mattu M. Santoro J.C. Wisniewski D. Cummings R.T. Calzetta A. Cubbon R.M. Fischer P.A. Tarachandani A. De Francesco R. Wright S.D. Sparrow C.P. Carfi A. Sitlani A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20502-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A modified form of the PCSK9 expression plasmid was also constructed to encode PCSK9 with the AviTag peptide sequence (GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE) between the V5 and His6 tags, enabling site-specific biotinylation on the Lys (K) residue (underlined). The human LDLR ectodomain (residues 1-720) was cloned into the pDEST40 plasmid (Invitrogen) and the H306Y mutation was introduced. DNA fragments encoding the proteins PCSK9ΔC (Gln-31—Ala-451) and ΔN-PCSK9ΔC (Ala-53—Ala-451) were subcloned from the pcDNA3.1-F1-WT plasmid into the pETM-10 expression plasmid (EMBL Heidelberg, Germany) which was subsequently modified to encode a C-terminal His6 tag. The EGF(A) (Gly-293—Glu-332) and EGF(AB) (Gly-293—Lys-372) domains from human LDLR (numbering excludes N-terminal signal peptide) were cloned into the pETM-11 expression plasmid, which allows removal of the His6 tag by digestion with tobacco etch virus protease (EMBL Heidelberg). All point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Full-length PCSK9 and PCSK9-AviTag were expressed following stable transfection of HEK293 cells and purified as described previously (17Fisher T.S. Lo Surdo P. Pandit S. Mattu M. Santoro J.C. Wisniewski D. Cummings R.T. Calzetta A. Cubbon R.M. Fischer P.A. Tarachandani A. De Francesco R. Wright S.D. Sparrow C.P. Carfi A. Sitlani A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20502-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Purified PCSK9-AviTag was biotinylated in vitro with biotin ligase following the manufacturer's instructions (Avidity, Inc.). The PCSK9ΔC, ΔN-PCSK9ΔC, EGF(A), and EGF(AB) proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 cells with induction of protein production by 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and subsequent incubation with shaking at 18 °C overnight. After cell lysis, proteins were purified from the soluble fraction by nickel affinity chromatography. The EGF(A) and EGF(AB) proteins were then reduced by the addition of 0.1 m dithiothreitol and subjected to a 72-h oxido-shuffling refolding protocol by dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 5% glycerol, 5 mm CaCl2, 3 mm l-cysteine, and 0.3 mm l-cystine as described previously (25Malby S. Pickering R. Saha S. Smallridge R. Linse S. Downing A.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2555-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The N-terminal His6 tag was removed from the EGF(A/AB) proteins by overnight incubation at room temperature with a solubility-enhanced tobacco etch virus protease (26van den Berg S. Lofdahl P.A. Hard T. Berglund H. J. Biotechnol. 2006; 121: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). All proteins were purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex-75 (16/60 or 26/60) column equilibrated in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm CaCl2 for EGF proteins and in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.05% n-octyl-β-glucoside for PCSK9ΔC and ΔN-PCSK9ΔC. The LDLRH306Y protein was produced in HEK293-EBNA cells following transient transfection. Cell supernatants were exchanged by ultrafiltration into buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and the protein was purified by metal affinity chromatography (TALON resin, Clontech), followed by ion exchange chromatography (Resource Q, GE Healthcare) and size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare) in 25 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2. All SPR experiments were performed using Biacore instruments at 25 °C. Running buffers contained 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.005% (v/v) P-20 surfactant, and either 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, or 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.7. For studies of EGF(AB) binding to PCSK9, the purified full-length C-terminally biotinylated PCSK9 was noncovalently immobilized on a streptavidin-coated sensor surface (SA chip, GE Healthcare). For studies of PCSK9 or PCSK9ΔC binding to LDLR proteins, the purified full-length LDLR (WT or H306Y mutant) was covalently immobilized by amine coupling to a carboxymethylated dextran sensor surface (CM5 chip, GE Healthcare). Binding constants were obtained from a series of injections at 50 μl/min of analyte (PCSK9, PCSK9ΔC, or EGF(AB)) at concentrations up to 2 μm. Following injections of PCSK9 or PCSK9ΔC, LDLR-coupled sensor chip surfaces were regenerated with a 5-s injection of 30 mm NaOH. Following injections of EGF(AB), the PCSK9-coupled sensor chip surface was regenerated with a 25-s injection of 5 mm EDTA followed by a 30-s injection of 6 mm CaCl2. Data were analyzed using BIAevaluation software, with reference sensorgrams subtracted from experimental sensorgrams to yield curves representing specific binding. Steady-state analysis was used to plot equilibrium binding response (Req) against analyte concentration in order to obtain thermodynamic dissociation constants (KD). For each series, simultaneous fitting of dissociation curves was used to obtain koff, which was then used to obtain kon (KD = koff/kon) as described previously (17Fisher T.S. Lo Surdo P. Pandit S. Mattu M. Santoro J.C. Wisniewski D. Cummings R.T. Calzetta A. Cubbon R.M. Fischer P.A. Tarachandani A. De Francesco R. Wright S.D. Sparrow C.P. Carfi A. Sitlani A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20502-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). TR-FRET experiments were performed essentially as described previously (17Fisher T.S. Lo Surdo P. Pandit S. Mattu M. Santoro J.C. Wisniewski D. Cummings R.T. Calzetta A. Cubbon R.M. Fischer P.A. Tarachandani A. De Francesco R. Wright S.D. Sparrow C.P. Carfi A. Sitlani A. J. Biol.

Reactions were performed at 20 °C in 50 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Disruption of the PCSK9-LDLR interaction was assessed in titrations in which putative competitor proteins, typically in concentration ranges of 0.1 nm to 2.5 μm, were added to the reaction mixture with incubations for 16 h prior to fluorescence measurements. IC50 values were determined from triplicate experiments by fitting data to a sigmoidal dose-response curve using nonlinear regression (GraphPad Software Inc.). For proteins that did not give full titrations, data were fitted with the dose-response minimum defined by the signal obtained in the presence of 1 mm EDTA, which renders LDLR inactive. LDL uptake was measured in HEK293 cells stably expressing the pcDNA3.1 vector alone as described previously (17Fisher T.S. Lo Surdo P. Pandit S. Mattu M. Santoro J.C. Wisniewski D. Cummings R.T. Calzetta A. Cubbon R.M. Fischer P.A. Tarachandani A. De Francesco R. Wright S.D. Sparrow C.P. Carfi A. Sitlani A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20502-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The only experimental difference is that Alexa Fluor 546-labeled LDL, rather than LDL labeled with 3,3-dioctadecylindocarbocyanine (Dil), was used to follow cellular LDL uptake; labeling was performed as described previously (27Pandit S. Wisniewski D. Santoro J.C. Ha S. Ramakrishnan V. Cubbon R.M. Cummings R.T. Wright S.D. Sparrow C.P. Sitlani A. Fisher T.S. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 1333-1343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The inhibition of PCSK9 activity was assessed in titrations in which putative competitor proteins, in the nanomolar to micromolar concentration range, were added to the growth medium at the same time as PCSK9 followed by a 6.5-h incubation at 37 °C. The amount of competitor protein required for half-maximal inhibition of PCSK9 (IC50) was determined by fitting data to a sigmoidal dose-response curve using nonlinear regression (GraphPad Software Inc.). Immobilization of EGF(AB) on Sepharose Beads and Complex Formation with PCSK9D374Y—CNBr-activated Sepharose beads (50 mg/ml) were resuspended in 1 mm HCl. A 100-μl volume of beads was packed into two 0.8-ml micro-columns and washed extensively with 1 mm HCl. The two columns were washed with 20 ml of 0.1 m NaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3 (equilibration buffer), and the coupling reaction was performed for 2 h at 37 °C using either 50 μg of EGF(AB) in 200 μl of equilibration buffer or simply the equilibration buffer in the absence of EGF(AB) (control column). After coupling the columns were washed with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, then were incubated in the same buffer at 37 °C for 2 h to achieve complete deactivation of the Sepharose beads, and finally were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. EGF(AB)-coupled beads and control beads were incubated with 0.1 μg/μl PCSK9D374Y in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at 37 °C. The beads were then washed with 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Epitope Excision with Endoproteases—The complex-bound beads and the control beads were incubated with several endoproteases: chymotrypsin and AspN (1 μg/100 μl), trypsin (0.5 μg/100 μl), GluC (5 μg/100 μl), and aminopeptidase (100 μg/100 μl). Enzyme addition was repeated until the mass spectrum profile of the peptides bound to the EGF(AB)-coupled beads remained unchanged. The enzymes were added in the following order in four independent experiments: 1) chymotrypsin followed by trypsin, 2) GluC and aminopeptidase, 3) chymotrypsin followed by AspN, 4) trypsin followed by aminopeptidase. MALDI-TOF MS Analysis—The peptides associated with the Sepharose beads were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. 1 μl of EGF(AB)-coupled beads was deposited on a MALDI target, and a saturated solution of sinapinic acid (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid; Aldrich) in 50% acetonitrile and 1% trifluoroacetic acid was added. The spectra of positive ions were recorded in linear mode on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Voyager-STR, Perseptive Biosystem, Inc., Framingham, MA) equipped with a delayed extraction device and a nitrogen laser (λ = 337 nm). Approximately 500 shots were averaged for each spectrum acquired. External calibration was performed with Glu1-FibrinopeptideB, ACTH-(1-17), ACTH-(18-39), and ACTH-(7-38) using the monoprotonated ion of the monomers with average mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios. The difference between the calculated average mass and the experimental mass determination (0.05-0.1%) was consistent with the accuracy of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in linear mode. Purified ΔN-PCSK9ΔC and EGF(AB) WT or mutant proteins were mixed in a 1:3 molar ratio, and the complex was separated from excess EGF(AB) by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex-200 (26/60) column equilibrated in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 20 μm CaCl2, and 5% glycerol. The complex was concentrated to 4 mg/ml in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 20 μm CaCl2, and 5% glycerol and was crystallized by the vapor diffusion method. Crystals of WT ΔN-PCSK9ΔC with WT EGF(AB) were obtained using a reservoir containing 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) 2-propanol, and 20% polyethylene glycol 4000. Crystals for all other complexes were obtained using a reservoir containing 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 8% ethylene glycol. Before data collection, crystals were transferred into stabilizing reservoir solutions containing increased precipitant concentration and 20% glycerol as cryoprotectant and were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on the ID-23 beam line at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). Diffraction data were processed with MOSFLM (28Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar), and the CCP4 suite of programs (29CCP4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar) was used for further data processing and analysis. All crystals belong to the P43212 space group and contain one ΔN-PCSK9ΔC-EGF(AB) complex per asymmetric unit and 65-70% solvent. The ΔN-PCSK9ΔC-EGF(AB) WT structure was determined by the molecular replacement method with PHASER (30McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar) using the structure of PCSK9 (2QTW) with the C-terminal domain removed as a search model. After rigid body refinement, 2|Fo|-|Fc| electron density maps were calculated and used to build the LDLR EGF(A) domain. Model building was performed within Coot (31Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar), and REFMAC (32Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The final models include residues Thr-60—Ser-447 of PCSK9 and Gly-293—Glu-332 of EGF(A). No electron density was observed for the EGF(B) domain, which is presumed to be disordered in the crystals. The amount of solvent-accessible surface area buried by protein complex formation was determined using the PISA software (33Krissinel E. H"
https://openalex.org/W2169688673,"The discovery of mirror neurons has suggested a potential neural basis for simulation and common coding theories of action perception, theories which propose that we understand other people's actions because perceiving their actions activates some of our neurons in much the same way as when we perform the actions. We propose testing this model directly in humans with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) by means of cross-modal classification. Cross-modal classification evaluates whether a classifier that has learned to separate stimuli in the sensory domain can also separate the stimuli in the motor domain. Successful classification provides support for simulation theories because it means that the fMRI signal, and presumably brain activity, is similar when perceiving and performing actions. In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of the technique by showing that classifiers which have learned to discriminate whether a participant heard a hand or a mouth action, based on the activity patterns in the premotor cortex, can also determine, without additional training, whether the participant executed a hand or mouth action. This provides direct evidence that, while perceiving others' actions, (1) the pattern of activity in premotor voxels with sensory properties is a significant source of information regarding the nature of these actions, and (2) that this information shares a common code with motor execution."
https://openalex.org/W2017619851,"The study was undertaken to investigate whether the two major monocyte subsets defined by the surface markers CD14(+)CD16(+) and CD14(++)CD16(-) show differences in their responses to hypercholesterolemia. Monocytes were rapidly isolated from the blood of hypercholesterolemic, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-defective familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients and from control persons. Using flow cytometry and uptake, adhesion, and phagocytosis assays as well as laser scanning microscopy, we found significant differences between the monocyte subsets. FH-CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes exhibit an increased uptake of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) via CD36, whereas FH-CD14(++)CD16(-) monocytes preferentially take up native LDL (nLDL). FH-CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes have an increased expression of surface proteins CD68, stabilin-1, and CD11c and a higher adherence to activated endothelial cells in response to oxLDL and nLDL stimulation. In addition, all CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes have an increased ability for phagocytosis and a higher resistance to phagocytosis impairment by oxLDL compared with CD14(++)CD16(-) monocytes. We conclude that FH-CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes have specialized functions in the uptake of oxLDL at activated endothelial cell surfaces, and we hypothesize that these functions are critical for the clearance of oxLDL deposits and apoptotic cells from the vessel wall under hyperlipidemic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1978384694,"Seven-transmembrane (G-protein coupled) receptors are key regulators of normal physiology and a large number of diseases, and this family of receptors is the target for almost half of all drugs. Cell culture models suggest that homodimerization and heterodimerization of 7-transmembrane receptors regulate processes including specificity of ligand binding and activation of downstream signaling pathways, making receptor dimerization a critical determinant of receptor biology and a promising new therapeutic target. To monitor receptor dimerization in cell-based assays and living animals, we developed a protein fragment complementation assay based on firefly luciferase to investigate dimerization of chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7, two 7-transmembrane receptors with central functions in normal development, cancer, and other diseases. Treatment with chemokine ligands and pharmacologic agents produced time- and dose-dependent changes in reporter signal. Chemokines regulated reporter bioluminescence for CXCR4 or CXCR7 homodimers without affecting signals from receptor heterodimers. In a tumor xenograft model of breast cancer, we used bioluminescence imaging to measure changes in receptor homodimerization in response to pharmacologic agents. This technology should be valuable for analyzing function and therapeutic modulation of receptor dimerization in intact cells and living mice."
https://openalex.org/W2091518548,"The thyroid hormone receptor TRα1 regulates intestinal development and homeostasis by controlling epithelial proliferation in the crypts. This involves positive control of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. To further investigate the effect of thyroid hormone-TRα1 signaling on the intestinal epithelium proliferating compartment, we performed a comparative transcription profile analysis on laser microdissected crypt cells recovered from wild type animals with normal or perturbed hormonal status, as well as from TR knock-out mice. Statistical analysis and an in silico approach allowed us to identify 179 differentially regulated genes and to group them into organized functional networks. We focused on the “cell cycle/cell proliferation” network and, in particular, on the Frizzled-related protein sFRP2, whose expression was greatly increased in response to thyroid hormones. In vitro and in vivo analyses showed that the expression of sFRP2 is directly regulated by TRα1 and that it activates β-catenin signaling via Frizzled receptors. Indeed, sFRP2 stabilizes β-catenin, activates its target genes, and enhances cell proliferation. In conclusion, these new data, in conjunction with our previous results, indicate a complex interplay between TRα1 and components of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Moreover, we describe in this study a novel mechanism of action of sFRP2, responsible for the activation of β-catenin signaling.

T3 and T4, control cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis depending on tissue targets (1Yen P.M. Ando S. Feng X. Liu Y. Maruvada P. Xia X. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 246: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This is well illustrated during TH-dependent amphibian metamorphosis (2Tata J.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 246: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The action of TH is mediated by T3 binding to nuclear receptors (TRs), encoded by the TRα and TRβ genes (3Laudet V. Hanni C. Coll J. Catzeflis F. Stehelin D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The TRs activate or repress transcription of target genes by binding to specific DNA sequences named thyroid hormone-responsive elements (TRE) (1Yen P.M. Ando S. Feng X. Liu Y. Maruvada P. Xia X. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 246: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In some organs of the gastrointestinal tract, TH-TRs stimulate cell proliferation (4Bockhorn M. Frilling A.

Wong M.H. Saam J.R. Mysorekar I.U. Gordon J.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 702-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells acquire differentiated phenotypes during their migration up to the villi, where they eventually die and are shed into the lumen. In the mouse, the whole process lasts 3-4 days (9Stappenbeck T.S. Wong M.H. Saam J.R. Mysorekar I.U. Gordon J.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 702-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 10Karam S.M. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D286-D298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This continuous cell renewal is regulated by several intrinsic (i.e. transcription factors) and extrinsic (i.e. growth factors and hormones) components. A complex interplay between different signaling pathways maintains epithelial homeostasis (11He X.C. Zhang J. Tong W.G. Tawfik O. Ross J. Scoville D.H. Tian Q. Zeng X. He X. Wiedemann L.M. Mishina Y. Li L. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 12Taipale J. Beachy P.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). We recently showed that the TRα1 receptor controls the proliferation of intestinal epithelium progenitors (8Plateroti M. Kress E. Mori J.I. Samarut J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3204-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The mechanism behind this effect involves direct transcriptional regulation of the Ctnnb1 gene, which encodes β-catenin, the intracellular mediator of the canonical Wnt pathway (13Clevers H. Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4427) Google Scholar).Canonical Wnt is activated when Wnt proteins bind to the Frizzled receptors, allowing stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. β-Catenin then binds to the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors to regulate the expression of Wnt target genes (13Clevers H. Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4427) Google Scholar). Because some of these factors control intestinal progenitor cell proliferation (12Taipale J. Beachy P.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar, 13Clevers H. Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4427) Google Scholar), this pathway is thought to be a key regulator of intestinal homeostasis.To analyze the TH-responsive genes in the intestinal epithelium, we used global comparative transcription profiling of laser microdissected intestinal crypt cells. This approach allowed us to define in detail the cross-talk between genes and signaling pathways involved in the control of epithelial cell homeostasis. Moreover, we were able to extend our previous results regarding the control of β-catenin expression by TH. In fact, we identified a new target of TRα1, the secreted Frizzled-related protein sFRP2, which in these cells behaves as a positive regulator of β-catenin stabilization and signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimal Treatment and Tissue Preparation—For microdissection, we used TRα0/0 (14Gauthier K. Plateroti M. Harvey C.B. Williams G.R. Weiss R.E. Refetoff S. Willott J.F. Sundin V. Roux J.P. Malaval L. Hara M. Samarut J. Chassande O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4748-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), TRβ-/- (15Gauthier K. Chassande O. Plateroti M. Roux J.P. Legrand C. Pain B. Rousset B. Weiss R. Trouillas J. Samarut J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and wild type animals, housed and maintained with approval from the animal experimental committee of the Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (Lyon, France), and in accordance with European legislation on animal care and experimentation. TH deficiency in pups was induced by 0.15% propylthiouracil (PTU) in the diet (Harlan/Teklad) as described previously (8Plateroti M. Kress E. Mori J.I. Samarut J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3204-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A group of PTU-treated animals received a single IP injection of TH (2.5 mg/kg T4 and 0.25 mg/kg T3 in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline) 24 h before sacrifice. Control animals were fed with standard mouse chow. Animals were euthanized at 14 days, and segments of proximal, median, and distal small intestine were embedded together in Tissue-Tek mounting medium and frozen at -80 °C for cryosectioning. For RNA and protein analysis in the whole mucosa, animals were sacrificed at 14 days, and the intestine was quickly removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for immunohistochemistry or frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA and/or protein extraction.Isolation of Villus-Crypt Epithelial Fractions—The sequential isolation of mouse small intestinal epithelial cells along the villus-crypt axis has been described previously and validated (16Weiser M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2536-2541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1-Month-old mice were maintained under a standard chow diet and either untreated or TH-injected (a single IP injection). They were euthanized 24 h after the injection. TH status was confirmed by measuring the circulating levels of free T3 and T4 (Biomerieux).Laser Capture Microdissection and GeneChip Analysis—Tissue-Tek-embedded intestine fragments were prepared for LCM by using the protocol described previously (17Stappenbeck T.S. Hooper L.V. Manchester J.K. Wong M.H. Gordon J.I. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 356: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Details for RNA extraction, labeling, and hybridization can be found in the supplemental Materials and Methods.Statistics—For pairwise comparisons (WT-PTU-treated versus WT-Control; WT-TH-injected versus WT-Control; WT-TH versus WT-PTU; TRα0/0 versus WT-Control; TRβ-/- versus WT-Control), we used Affymetrix Microarray Suite software 5.0 and two-tailed Student's T-Test (Zoe software). We also applied the analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. More details can be found in the supplemental “Materials and Methods.Ingenuity Pathway Analysis—The associations between the genes were further evaluated using the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software (Ingenuity Systems). See also the supplemental Materials and Methods.Primary Culture of Intestine Epithelial Cells—Intestinal epithelial primary cultures were derived from 4- to 6-day-old neonatal mice, using the protocol and culture conditions described previously (8Plateroti M. Kress E. Mori J.I. Samarut J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3204-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Either 2 × 10-7 m T3 or the vehicle alone was added to the culture medium for the indicated length of time. For proliferation studies, 10 μm BrdUrd was added to the culture medium during an overnight incubation. Recombinant sFRP2, Wnt3a, chimeric Fz4, and chimeric Fz7 (R & D Systems) were added to the culture medium for 24 h, at the indicated concentrations. In blocking experiments, 1 μg/ml of anti-sFRP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science) antibodies were added to the culture medium for 24 h. After 4 days in culture, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and frozen at -80 °C prior to being used for RNA or protein extraction, or they were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for immunofluorescence.RNA Preparation and Analysis—RNA was extracted from primary cultures with Absolutely RNA nanoprep kit (Stratagene), and from epithelial fractions with total RNA and protein isolation kit (Macherey-Nagel). Reverse transcription was performed using 1 μg of RNA and the Sprint PowerScript Pre-Primed SingleShots with random hexamer primers (Clontech). For RNA recovered by laser microdissection, 1 ng of RNA was retro-transcribed. See the supplemental Materials and Methods for details of quantitative PCR.Immunostaining and Western Blot—Immunolabeling for β-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and BrdUrd (Roche Applied Science) was performed on 2% paraformaldehyde-fixed cell cultures. Staining for β-catenin was also performed on 5-μm paraffin sections. Secondary fluorescent antibodies were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories. For fluorescence (Zeiss Axioplan) or confocal microscopy (Zeiss Axiophot), nuclei were stained by Hoechst or by propidium iodide, respectively.Whole proteins from the intestine or from fractionated epithelial cells were extracted using the total RNA and protein isolation kit (Macherey-Nagel). Proteins from cell cultures were obtained by adding the SDS-loading buffer directly to the culture dish. The culture medium was concentrated with centrifugal filter devices (Centricon, Millipore). Proteins were separated and analyzed as described previously (8Plateroti M. Kress E. Mori J.I. Samarut J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3204-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We used the following primary antibodies: anti-sFRP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-activated β-catenin (Upstate), anti-actin (Sigma), anti-Dishevelled 1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-phospho-GSK3β (Ser-9; Cell Signaling).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The chromatin immunoprecipitation study was performed on collagenase-dispase separated epithelial fragments from 3- to 6-day-old mouse intestine as described previously (8Plateroti M. Kress E. Mori J.I. Samarut J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3204-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For conventional PCR, we used the Euroblue Taq (Eurobio). Oligonucleotides are listed in supplemental Fig. S5B. All amplicons were sequenced.RESULTSCrypt Cell Isolation and Microarray Data—Crypt cells were from wild type (WT) animals with normal or perturbed TH status, as well as from TRα and TRβ knock-out mice (14Gauthier K. Plateroti M. Harvey C.B. Williams G.R. Weiss R.E. Refetoff S. Willott J.F. Sundin V. Roux J.P. Malaval L. Hara M. Samarut J. Chassande O. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The supplemental Fig. S1 summarizes the approach of laser microdissection. Statistic methods were used to identify the differentially expressed genes illustrated in supplemental Table S1.Fig. 1 shows examples of validation by RT-QPCR on RNA recovered from microdissected cells. Fig. 1, A and B, displays Ccnb1 (cyclin B1) and Mad2L1 (mitotic arrest deficient homolog-like 1) genes, which encode regulators of cell cycle progression and mitotic checkpoint, respectively (18Hardwick K.G. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R122-R124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Lindqvist A. van Zon W. Karlsson Rosenthal C. Wolthuis R.M. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e123-e127Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Similar results obtained by microarray and by RT-QPCR approaches are illustrated in supplemental Fig. S2.For a finer in silico study, we used the software Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, and defined groups of functions and canonical pathways represented in the set of input genes (supplemental Fig. S3). Finally, we used the gene network tool, which links genes and/or proteins based on a knowledge base. The highest score corresponded to the network “cell cycle/cell proliferation,” which contained 35 input genes (Fig. 1C). This network gives good evidence of the global response to the TH-mediated proliferative stimulus in crypt cells. It is composed of two major nodes. One is Fos, which is up-regulated by TH treatment, coherent with its positive control of cell proliferation (20Hess J. Angel P. Schorpp-Kistner M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5965-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). The second is Ctnnb1, encoding β-catenin, already described as a TH-TRα1 target (8Plateroti M. Kress E. Mori J.I. Samarut J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3204-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). An interesting result was the positive relationship between the Frizzled-related protein sFRP2 and β-catenin, in agreement with work described previously (21Lee J.L. Chang C.J. Wu S.Y. Sargan D.R. Lin C.T. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 84: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Sfrp2 Is a Target Gene of TH in Vivo and in Vitro—We focused on the Sfrp2 gene because its expression was highly stimulated upon treatment with TH, and it participates in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Moreover, the action of sFRP2 on canonical Wnt has been described in contradictory terms, either repression or activation (21Lee J.L. Chang C.J. Wu S.Y. Sargan D.R. Lin C.T. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 84: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Jones S.E. Jomary C. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 23Kawano Y. Kypta R. J.

A. 2007; 104: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Our goal was to clarify its role in intestinal epithelial progenitors.First, we validated sFRP2 differential expression depending on TH status or on TR genotype in vivo. Fig. 2A shows that sFRP2 mRNA levels in WT crypts were lower in hypothyroid conditions and were stimulated in hyperthyroid conditions compared with the control condition. Moreover, they decreased in TRα0/0 and increased in TRβ-/- compared with WT control crypts. It is worth noting that TRβ-/- mice are congenitally hyperthyroid (15Gauthier K. Chassande O. Plateroti M. Roux J.P. Legrand C. Pain B. Rousset B. Weiss R. Trouillas J. Samarut J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). We also quantified sFRP2 mRNA and protein in the intestines of TRα and TRβ mutant mice with altered TH status to evaluate whether TH responsiveness depended on a specific TR subtype (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B). WT and TRβ-/- animals both showed decreased sFRP2 mRNA and protein expression under hypothyroid conditions and an induction of sFRP2 after TH treatment. In TRα0/0 mice, sFRP2 expression was unchanged by alteration of TH levels. Slight differences in the results reported in Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S4A are probably because of the use of isolated crypt cells in the first case and the whole mucosa in the second.FIGURE 2In vivo and in vitro regulation of the Sfrp2 gene.

J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2536-2541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (supplemental scheme Fig. S5). sFRP2 protein was present at comparable levels along the villus-crypt axis in control animals (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-4). However, TH injection increased the protein specifically in the two last fractions, corresponding to crypt-associated progenitors (Fig. 2B, lanes 3′ and 4′ versus lanes 3 and 4). It is worth pointing out that TRα1 is the only TR receptor expressed and exclusively present in crypt cells. This observation was made both in this study and previously (8Plateroti M. Kress E. Mori J.I. Samarut J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3204-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data demonstrated that the regulation of sFRP2 expression by TH depended specifically on the TRα1 receptor.To analyze whether the regulation of sFRP2 by TH was epithelial cell-autonomous, we used intestinal epithelium primary cultures maintained in the absence or presence of T3 for 24 h (Fig. 2C). In WT cells, sFRP2 mRNA levels were clearly and significantly increased by T3 treatment. We obtained a similar result by short term T3 treatment (6 h, Fig. 2D), strongly suggesting that this gene might be a direct target of TRα1. The mRNA levels of sFRP2 in TRα0/0 cells maintained in control condition were significantly decreased compared with WT control cells. As expected, the up-regulation of sFRP2 mRNA by T3 was abolished in cells from TRα0/0 mutant mice (Fig. 2C).Characterization of a TRE in the Promoter of the sFRP2 Gene—Using an in silico approach, we found a putative TRE located at -924 bp from the transcription start site (supplemental Fig. S6). To check whether this TRE is a binding site for TRα1 in vivo, we carried out chromatin IP assays on freshly isolated intestinal epithelium. Sonicated chromatin was incubated with anti-TRα1, anti-TRβ1, or preimmune serum. The DNA precipitated and in starting inputs was analyzed by PCR (Fig. 3). Using primers that amplified a fragment of DNA comprising the sFRP2-TRE, we showed the presence of a band only in samples incubated with the anti-TRα1 antibody. A similar result was obtained for the positive control Ctnnb1-TRE (8Plateroti M. Kress E. Mori J.I. Samarut J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3204-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We also quantified by QPCR the DNA precipitated by the TRα1 antibody, expressed as a percentage of the starting input. We obtained a value of 6.4 ± 0.3% (n = 4) for sFRP2-TRE and 5.8 ± 0.4% (n = 4) for Ctnnb1-TRE. Negative controls included Sfrp2 promoter regions located 1 and 3 kb from the TRE, and the TH-insensitive 36B4 gene. The binding of TRα1 to sFRP2-TRE was also demonstrated in vitro by gel shift analysis (supplemental Fig. S7). Altogether, these data clearly demonstrated that TRα1 binds sFRP2-TRE in intestinal epithelial cells both in vitro and in vivo.FIGURE 3Molecular analysis of the thyroid hormone-responsive element present in the Sfrp2 gene, by in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation.

Our results showing strong positive regulation by TH-TRα1 in vivo and in vitro were intriguing. We took advantage of the intestinal epithelium primary culture model to study in detail the action of sFRP2 on β-catenin as well as its function on epithelial progenitor cell proliferation.We treated WT or TRα0/0 cells with recombinant sFRP2 and monitored the mRNA levels of c-Myc (Fig. 4A) and cyclin D1 (not shown), which are established targets of β-catenin (26He T.C.

A concentration of 50 ng/ml in the culture medium significantly stimulated the expression of both targets. This stimulation was similar to that obtained by treating the cells with the canonical Wnt3a ligand (Fig. 4A). The simultaneous addition of sFRP2 and Wnt3a resulted in similar expression levels of c-Myc mRNA as in each single treatment. We obtained similar results in primary cultures from both WT and TRα0/0 intestine, indicating that stimulation of β-catenin targets by exogenous sFRP2 was independent of TRα1 signaling.FIGURE 4sFRP2 stabilizes β-catenin in vitro.

Because the levels of β-catenin mRNA were not changed by sFRP2 treatment in vitro (Fig. 4B), we focused on protein analysis and in particular on the amount of total as well as nonphosphorylated stabilized β-catenin. For this we used a specific antibody recognizing the N-terminal part of the protein only when not phosphorylated at residues Ser-37 and Thr-41. Wnt signals specifically increase the levels of dephosphorylated β-catenin as detected with this antibody (28van Noort M. Meeljik J. van der Zee R. Destree O."
https://openalex.org/W2044576782,"Bone morphogenetic proteins such as BMP4 are essential for proper development of telencephalic forebrain structures and induce differentiation of telencephalic neural stem cells into a variety of cellular fates, including astrocytic, neuronal, and mesenchymal cells. Little is yet understood regarding the mechanisms that underlie the spatiotemporal differences in progenitor response to BMP4. In a screen designed to identify novel targets of BMP4 signaling in telencephalic neural stem cells, we found the mRNA levels of the previously uncharacterized factor CXXC5 reproducibly up-regulated upon BMP4 stimulation. In vivo, CXXC5 expression overlapped with BMP4 adjacent to Wnt3a expression in the dorsal regions of the telencephalon, including the developing choroid plexus. CXXC5 showed partial homology with Idax, a related protein previously shown to interact with the Wnt-signaling intermediate Dishevelled (Dvl). Indeed CXXC5 and Dvl co-localized in the cytoplasm and interacted in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Moreover, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments verified that CXXC5 and Dvl2 were located in close spatial proximity in neural stem cells. Studies of the functional role of CXXC5 revealed that overexpression of CXXC5 or exposure to BMP4 repressed the levels of the canonical Wnt signaling target Axin2, and CXXC5 attenuated Wnt3a-mediated increase in TOPflash reporter activity. Accordingly, RNA interference of CXXC5 attenuated the BMP4-mediated decrease in Axin2 levels and facilitated the response to Wnt3a in neural stem cells. We propose that CXXC5 is acting as a BMP4–induced inhibitor of Wnt signaling in neural stem cells.

Stimulation of telencephalic neural stem cells by BMP4 induces differentiation into a variety of cellular fates, including neuronal, astrocytic and smooth muscle cells in vitro, and genetic studies have shown that BMP4 is essential for proper differentiation and regionalization of the telencephalic forebrain (1Shimogori T. Banuchi V. Ng H.Y. Strauss J.B. Grove E.A. Development.. 2004; 131: 5639-5647Google Scholar, 2Panchision D.M. Pickel J.M. Studer L. Lee S.H. Turner P.A. Hazel T.G. McKay R.D.

Cell Biol.. 2003; 161: 911-921Google Scholar). BMP4 mediates its effects through nuclear translocalization of Smad proteins such as Smad1 and Smad4 that can act directly as transcription factors and associate with a number of important cofactors, including TGIF, Sip1, and CBP/p300 (6van Grunsven L.A. Verstappen G. Huylebroeck D. Verschueren K. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev.. 2005; 16: 495-512Google Scholar, 7Xu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2006; 1759: 503-513Google Scholar). BMP activity exert cross-talk with many signaling pathways, such as the membrane-bound receptor Notch, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), and Wnt factors (8Dahlqvist C. Blokzijl A. Chapman G. Falk A. Dannaeus K. Ibanez C.F. Lendahl U. Development.. 2003; 130: 6089-6099Google Scholar, 9Kleber M. Lee H.Y. Wurdak H. Buchstaller J. Riccomagno M.M. Ittner L.M. Suter U. Epstein D.J. Sommer L. J. Cell Biol.. 2005; 169: 309-320Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that BMP molecules act in synergy with canonical Wnt signaling molecules, such as Wnt3a, to regulate telencephalic regionalization (1Shimogori T. Banuchi V. Ng H.Y. Strauss J.B. Grove E.A. Development.. 2004; 131: 5639-5647Google Scholar, 10Sur M. Rubenstein J.L. Science.. 2005; 310: 805-810Google Scholar). Less is known regarding downstream targets of BMP signaling that regulate the spatial and temporal context-specific differences in progenitor responsiveness to extracellular signaling factors. BMP activity is directly regulated by extracellular inhibitors such as noggin and chordin, and Wnt signaling activity is regulated at many levels by both extra- and intracellular mechanisms. An example of an intracellular inhibitor of Wnt signaling with reported effects on forebrain development is Idax. Idax binds directly to the Wnt signaling mediator Dishevelled (Dvl) and seems to compete at the binding site of Axin, resulting in an inhibition of Wnt activity (11Hino S. Kishida S. Michiue T. Fukui A. Sakamoto I. Takada S. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2001; 21: 330-342Google Scholar). Idax belongs to the CXXC family of proteins of which other members, such as MBD1, are predominantly nuclear DNA-binding proteins with chromatin-modifying properties (12Katoh M. Int. J. Oncol.. 2004; 25: 1193-1199Google Scholar). Dvl is predominantly albeit not exclusively localized in the cytoplasm, and Idax appears to be an exception to other CXXC domain-containing proteins, being localized largely in the cytoplasm (11Hino S. Kishida S. Michiue T. Fukui A. Sakamoto I. Takada S. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2001; 21: 330-342Google Scholar). It has been shown that some CXXC proteins are cancer-associated genes that can regulate the activity and function of important transcriptional complexes, such as Polycomb proteins (12Katoh M. Int. J. Oncol.. 2004; 25: 1193-1199Google Scholar). Idax is expressed in anterior brain structures and is required for appropriate forebrain development as loss of Idax by morpholinos in Xenopus tadpoles result in severe forebrain defects (13Michiue T. Fukui A. Yukita A. Sakurai K. Danno H. Kikuchi A. Asashima M. Dev. Dyn.. 2004; 230: 79-90Google Scholar). In a systematic attempt to increase the understanding of the mechanisms underlying cell context-specific responses of telencephalic neural stem cells (NSCs) to BMP4 signaling during forebrain development, we have pursued gene expression profiling analysis using microarrays to identify putative direct and novel targets for BMP4 signaling in NSCs. By this approach, we identified CXXC5 as a direct BMP4 target in NSCs. In situ hybridization experiments revealed that CXXC5 expression localized selectively to the BMP4-rich dorsal telencephalon adjacent to the neighboring regions expressing Wnt3a. Although CXXC5 displayed predominantly nuclear localization, it co-localized and interacted with several Dvl isoforms in the cytoplasm. CXXC5 influenced the expression of the endogenous Wnt signaling target Axin2 as well as Wnt3a-induced activation of a TOPflash reporter. Based on these results, we propose that CXXC5 is a novel BMP-regulated modulator of Wnt signaling and targets thereof in telencephalic NSCs. Cortical NSC Cultures—NSCs were obtained from the dissociated cerebral cortices of Sprague-Dawley rat E15.5 embryos and cultured as previously described (14Johe K.K. Hazel T.G. Muller T. Dugich-Djordjevic M.M. McKay R.D. Genes Dev.. 1996; 10: 3129-3140Google Scholar, 15Hermanson O. Jepsen K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature.. 2002; 419: 934-939Google Scholar, 16Brunkhorst A. Karlen M. Shi J. Mikolajczyk M. Nelson M.A. Metsis M. Hermanson O. Mol Cell Neurosci.. 2005; 29: 250-258Google Scholar). Briefly NSCs were cultured in serum-free DMEM:F12 media (Invitrogen) enriched with N2 supplement and grown on poly-l-ornithine/fibronectin (Sigma)-coated cell culture dishes (Corning). Cells were maintained in a proliferative state using 10 ng/ml FGF2 (R&D Systems) and passaged once before nucleofections or twice before stimulations. After the second passage, cells were plated at 500–10,000 cells/cm2 and allowed to proliferate for 24 h prior to commencement of the experiment. To induce differentiation of NSCs, FGF2 was withdrawn from the cultures with or without the addition of other soluble factors. BMP4 and Wnt3a (R&D Systems) were both used at 10 ng/ml. Addition of soluble factors was carried out every 24 h, and media was changed every 48 h. For inhibition of protein synthesis, 10–20 μg/ml Cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to the media 15–30 min before addition of BMP4. All experiments in this study involving animals and stem cell isolation were approved by the ethics committee for animal research in Stockholm, Sweden. Gene Expression Profiling Using Microarrays—Rat neural stem cells were exposed to BMP4 or kept in FGF2 for 3 h before the cells were lysed and RNA extracted (Qiagen). RNA from the time for stimulation start was extracted and used as control. The microarray was carried out by KI seq-express (former KIChip). Briefly, RNA was amplified (17Marko N.F. Frank B. Quackenbush J. Lee N.H. BMC Genomics.. 2005; 6: 27Google Scholar) and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and hybridized onto Agilent whole rat genome array (G4131A) (all kits and arrays from Agilent). The arrays were scanned at two different intensities, and the images were analyzed for background correction. Both BMP4 and FGF2 samples where co-hybridized with RNA from the starting point and a dye-swap was performed. The arrays were normalized and the differential gene expression analyzed using the R and bioconductor-based method LIMMA (18Smyth G.K. Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol.. 2004; 3 (Article 3)Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Quantitative RT-PCR—RNA was isolated using RNeasy and contaminating DNA removed using RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen). First strand cDNA synthesis was obtained using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). For quantitative PCR 0.5× Platinum SYBR green mix (Invitrogen) was used and run on Applied Biosystems 7300 Real Time PCR system using the PCR-program recommended by Invitrogen for Platinum SYBR green. Primers used for the quantitative RT-PCR were designed to span an intron where possible. Sequences can be obtained upon request. To further exclude DNA contamination, -RT (no reverse transcriptase) samples were run as controls. Data were analyzed using the statistical programming language R. DNA Constructs—The open reading frame of rat CXXC5 was amplified using Taq-polymerase (Invitrogen) and gene-specific primers and cloned into pCR4 using TOPO TA kit according to manufacturers instructions (Invitrogen). Isolated clones were sequenced (KI seq-express) before subcloning into pcDNA3 and subsequent use in overexpression experiments. To obtain CXXC5-GFP and GFP-CXXC5 fusion proteins, the PCR product was purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen), cut with restriction enzymes (NEB), and ligated using Quick ligase (NEB) into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pNGFP-EU or pCGFP-EU (19Kawate T. Allerson C.R. Wolfe J.L. Org. Lett.. 2005; 7: 3865-3868Google Scholar). Clones were sequenced and subsequently used for co-immunoprecipitation, FRET, and subcellular localization experiments. In vitro transcription/translation was performed using TNT (Promega) according to the supplier's instructions. The BMP4 and Wnt3a constructs were kind gifts from Dr. John L. R. Rubenstein. In Situ Hybridization—Non-radioactive in situ hybridization on sections was performed as previously described (20Schaeren-Wiemers N. Gerfin-Moser A. Histochemistry.. 1993; 100: 431-440Google Scholar). Heads (E10.5, E12.5, and E14.5) of mouse embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 2–5 h and then transferred to 30% sucrose at 4 °C overnight before frozen in Tissue-Tek (Sakura Finetek) on dry ice and kept in -70 °C until cryostat-sectioned (Microm) onto SuperFrost Plus glasses (Menzel-GmbH & Co KG) as 12-μm sections. Prior to hybridization, sections were permeabilized with 1 μg/ml proteinase K (Invitrogen), acetylated with 13.5 ml/L triethanolamine (Sigma), 44 mm acetic anhydride (Sigma) and 1.7 mm HCl (Merck), and pre-hybridized with hybridization buffer (50% formamide (Fluka), 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution (Sigma), 250 μg/ml bakers' yeast RNA (Sigma), 500 μg/ml herring sperm DNA (Invitrogen), 1 g/50 ml blocking reagent (Boehringer)) for 3–6 h. Hybridization was carried out at 70 °C overnight with 1–4 μl of DIG-labeled probe (0.1–0.2 μg/μl) per 100 μl of hybridization buffer and glass. Post-hybridization washes were performed for 1–2 h at 70 °C in 0.2× SSC. Sections were then blocked with 10% fetal calf serum for 2–4 h before being subjected to an anti-DIG antibody (1:5000, Roche) at 4 °C overnight. Finally, the slides were submerged into a 10% polyvinyl alcohol (Sigma) solution containing 1.72 ml/l NBT (Roche) and 1.72 ml/l B-CIP (Roche) chromogen components until sufficiently stained (3–72 h). DIG probes were produced according to the manufacturers' recommendations using DIG RNA labeling mix (Roche). After in situ hybridization, the sections were analyzed and micrographs obtained with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 mot plus microscope. CXXC5, BMP4, and Wnt3a probes were used on >3 littermate brains per developmental stage. Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Immunocytochemistry—COS7 and HEK-293 cells were transfected with GFP-CXXC5, CXXC5-GFP, or vector control only containing GFP individually or cotransfected with a full-length XDi-shevelled-Myc (21Ossipova O. Dhawan S. Sokol S. Green J.B. Dev. Cell.. 2005; 8: 829-841Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and culturing of COS7 and HEK-293 cells were performed essentially as previously described (22Bryja V. Schulte G. Rawal N. Grahn A. Arenas E. J. Cell Sci.. 2007; 120: 586-595Google Scholar). Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were anti-GFP (Fitzgerald Industries), rabbit anti-Myc (SCBT) and anti-Dvl3 (Cell Signaling Technology). Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting: anti-ß-catenin (BD Biosciences), anti-Dvl1 (SCBT), anti-Dvl2 (SCBT), anti-Dvl3 (SCBT), anti-GFP (Chemicon), mouse anti-Myc (SCBT), and anti-ß-actin (Abcam) (22Bryja V. Schulte G. Rawal N. Grahn A. Arenas E. J. Cell Sci.. 2007; 120: 586-595Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry, cultures were fixed using 10% formalin (Sigma) 24 h after transfections. Immunostaining was performed using standard protocols using chicken polyclonal anti-GFP (Chemicon, 1:1000) and mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc (SCBT, 1:200) followed by appropriate species-specific Alexa-488 and Alexa-594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, 1:500). Nuclei were visualized using Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Fluorescent and brightfield images were acquired using Zeiss Axioskop2/MRm camera with Axiovision software. Images were assembled using Adobe Photoshop. FRET—To perform Förster (Fluorescent) Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) measurements, we used a Zeiss LSM 5 Exciter inverted confocal scanning laser microscope using a ×63/1.2 NA objective as described previously (23Miyakawa-Naito A. Uhlen P. Lal M. Aizman O. Mikoshiba K. Brismar H. Zelenin S. Aperia A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 50355-50361Google Scholar). CXXC5-GFP-expressing NSCs were grown on prepared glass coverslips, and 24 h after nucleofection, cells were fixed using a 50% methanol/50% acetone fixing solution and then processed for immunocytochemistry. The coverslips were mounted on slides using the ProLong Antifade mounting media kit (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) to enable perfect conservation of the fluorescent signal. A detailed description of the FRET technique can be found elsewhere (24Uhlen P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.. 2003; 986: 514-518Google Scholar, 25Wouters F.S. Verveer P.J. Bastiaens P.I. Trends Cell Biol.. 2001; 11: 203-211Google Scholar). The Förster constant, R0, for the donor-acceptor pair, GFP and Alexa-555, used in this study was 6.3 nm (Handbook of Probes, Invitrogen). FRET occurs when the fluorophores are separated by distances 0.5 R0 < r < 2 R0. Thus, it is possible to distinguish proteins that are spatially colocalized within a ∼14-nm radius. To determine FRET, we quantified the quenching of donor fluorescence by performing acceptor photobleaching. NSCs expressing CXXC5-GFP and stained with Alexa555-labeled secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen; 1:100) to detect rabbit polyclonal antibody to Dvl2 (SCBT; 1:100) were excited with the 488 and 561 nm lasers. The acceptor, Alexa555, was then irreversibly photobleached in a selected adequate cytoplasmic region (∼5–10 μm2) by continuous excitation with the 561 nm laser for 10–20 s. Thereafter, the residual Alexa555 and GFP image was obtained, and a region of interest (ROI) was outlined in the photobleached area and processed using Zeiss LSM image Examiner. Ratios between GFP intensities in the ROI, before and after photobleaching, were calculated to quantify FRET. The FRET values presented are corrected for erroneous intensity changes for each cell in two cytoplasmic ROIs randomly selected outside the bleached area. 10–25 cells were measured for each experiment. Overexpression and siRNA-mediated Knockdown—NSCs were nucleofected according to the manufacturer's instructions using program A-33 on the Nucleofector (Amaxa) as previously described (26Ilkhanizadeh S. Teixeira A.I. Hermanson O. Biomaterials.. 2007; 28: 3936-3943Google Scholar). Experiments were commenced 24 h after nucleofection, during which NSCs were maintained in FGF2. As the healthiness of the cells varied significantly when obtaining very high (>90%) or very low (<20%) knockdown of CXXC5 expression levels, experiments where a knockdown of CXXC5 mRNA showed between 40–70% efficiency (n = 5) were chosen for detailed analysis. Transient transfection studies for luciferase assay in fibroblasts were performed essentially as previously described (27Sacchetti P. Dwornik H. Formstecher P. Rachez C. Lefebvre P. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 35088-35096Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 24-well plates 24 h before transfection and transfected with 0.6 μg of plasmid DNA/well complexed with 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Typically, cells were transfected with 200 ng of the reporter construct and increasing doses of CXXC5 expression vector. After 5 h of incubation, the lipid/DNA mix was replaced with fresh 10% serum medium. Cells were serum-starved 24-h post-transfection and stimulated with vehicle or purified Wnt3a (R&D Systems). Luciferase activities were assayed using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega), following the manufacturer's protocol. Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting: anti-ß-catenin (BD Biosciences), anti-activated (dephosphorylated) ß-catenin (Upstate), anti-Dvl2 (SCBT), and anti-ß-actin (Abcam). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed in Prism4 (GraphPad software). Initially variance analysis (ANOVA) was performed, followed by Student's t test (unpaired). Significance were assumed at the level of p < 0.05 (*, p < 0.05; ***, p < 0.001, see figure legends). BMP4 Rapidly Induces Significant Changes in Gene Expression in Neural Stem Cells—To elucidate novel downstream targets of BMP signaling in neural progenitors, we used a well-characterized rat embryonic telencephalic NSC preparation that has previously been used to study BMP signaling. During the continuous administration of FGF2 the NSCs remain undifferentiated with the capacity to differentiate into neuronal, astrocytic, oligodendrocyte, and mesenchymal cells (14Johe K.K. Hazel T.G. Muller T. Dugich-Djordjevic M.M. McKay R.D. Genes Dev.. 1996; 10: 3129-3140Google Scholar, 15Hermanson O. Jepsen K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature.. 2002; 419: 934-939Google Scholar, 16Brunkhorst A. Karlen M. Shi J. Mikolajczyk M. Nelson M.A. Metsis M. Hermanson O. Mol Cell Neurosci.. 2005; 29: 250-258Google Scholar, 26Ilkhanizadeh S. Teixeira A.I. Hermanson O. Biomaterials.. 2007; 28: 3936-3943Google Scholar). Upon BMP4 stimulation these cells respond with increased Smad phosphorylation, subsequent nuclear translocation of Smads and increase in transcription of Smad target genes (5Rajan P. Panchision D.M. Newell L.F. McKay R.D. J. Cell Biol.. 2003; 161: 911-921Google Scholar), and subsequent differentiation into astrocytic and mesenchymal cells (5Rajan P. Panchision D.M. Newell L.F. McKay R.D. J. Cell Biol.. 2003; 161: 911-921Google Scholar, 28Sailer M.H. Hazel T.G. Panchision D.M. Hoeppner D.J. Schwab M.E. McKay R.D. J. Cell Sci.. 2005; 118: 5849-5860Google Scholar). After primary FGF2 expansion, one passage and continued FGF2 expansion, NSCs were treated with either FGF2 or BMP4 for 3 h. This time point was chosen due to the rapid induction (<30 min) of Smad-mediated transcription downstream of BMP4 stimulation (5Rajan P. Panchision D.M. Newell L.F. McKay R.D. J. Cell Biol.. 2003; 161: 911-921Google Scholar). The gene expression profile was subsequently investigated using microarrays. This procedure identified 162 spots that were putatively (p value < 0.05) up- or down-regulated more than 1.5-fold after 3 h (supplemental data). To initially validate the array, we picked ≈10% of the identified genes and performed quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) on the same samples that were used for the microarrays. This experiment showed that around 90% of the genes identified in the screen were up- or down-regulated, in approximate accordance with the chosen p value predicting 95% accuracy (see further below). The effects of BMP4 stimulation of NSCs are highly dependent on the microenvironment and cell culture conditions, such as plating density (4Tsai R.Y. McKay R.D. J. Neurosci.. 2000; 20: 3725-3735Google Scholar, 28Sailer M.H. Hazel T.G. Panchision D.M. Hoeppner D.J. Schwab M.E. McKay R.D. J. Cell Sci.. 2005; 118: 5849-5860Google Scholar). To analyze the reproducibility of the effects of BMP4 on the expression of the identified genes in NSCs, we therefore picked eight factors from our screen (Fig. 1A and see below), including known and potentially novel targets of BMP4, and repeated the experimental procedure four times. Six out of these eight mRNAs were reproducibly BMP4-regulated in NSCs: Gas1, Olig1, Id2, Idb4, CXXC5, and Hey1 (Fig. 1A), whereas two mRNAs, Sin3A and Skiip, were regulated only in occasional experiments (data not shown). CXXC5 Is a Novel Direct Target of BMP4 in NSCs—Id2 and Idb4 have previously been shown to be direct targets of BMP signaling. These factors interact with and down-regulate the activity of bHLH proteins, such as the oligodendrocyte-associated bHLH transcription factors Olig1 and Olig2 thus interfering with oligodendrocyte differentiation (29Samanta J. Kessler J.A. Development.. 2004; 131: 4131-4142Google Scholar). In addition to this mechanism, we found that Olig1 expression was significantly down-regulated by BMP4 stimulation (Fig. 1A), suggesting that BMP4-mediated inhibition of oligodendrocyte differentiation may occur at several levels. Other reproducibly BMP4-regulated mRNAs were the Notch-associated repressor Hey1 (8Dahlqvist C. Blokzijl A. Chapman G. Falk A. Dannaeus K. Ibanez C.F. Lendahl U. Development.. 2003; 130: 6089-6099Google Scholar), and Gas1 recently linked to Sonic Hedgehog signaling (30Allen B.L. Tenzen T. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev.. 2007; 21: 1244-1257Google Scholar, 31Lee C.S. Buttitta L. Fan C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2001; 98: 11347-11352Google Scholar, 32Martinelli D.C. Fan C.M. Genes Dev.. 2007; 21: 1231-1243Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Another significantly BMP4-regulated mRNA was the previously uncharacterized factor CXXC5 (Fig. 1A). CXXC5 expression levels were up-regulated by BMP4 approximately 15-fold in average after 3 h as assessed by RT-qPCR (Fig. 1, A and B). Time course experiments (0, 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 min, 4, 6, 10 h after initial BMP4 exposure) revealed that CXXC5 expression levels started to increase at 40 min, were high at 60 min and remained up-regulated at 10 h after BMP4 exposure (see further below and data not shown). To investigate whether CXXC5 could be a direct target of BMP4 signaling, we pretreated the NSCs with cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of translation and thus de novo protein synthesis. We then evaluated the expression levels of CXXC5 3 h after subsequent FGF2 versus BMP4 stimulation. Pretreatment with CHX 15–30 min before BMP4 or FGF2 stimulation did not significantly inhibit BMP4-mediated up-regulation of CXXC5 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the increased levels of CXXC5 mRNA could be the result of a direct effect of BMP4 signaling on CXXC5 gene expression. CXXC5 Is Highly Expressed in the Dorsal Telencephalon Where BMP4 Expression Is Enriched—To confirm the gene product of CXXC5, we performed in vitro transcription/translation by TNT using a sequenced construct harboring full-length CXXC5. The protein product revealed a major band migrating at around 38 kDa (data not shown), in close range of the predicted protein product of the CXXC5 gene. To assess the gene expression pattern of CXXC5 in vivo in relation to BMP4 in neural progenitors, we performed in situ hybridization on forebrain sections from mice at embryonic age (E) 10.5, 12.5, and 14.5. At E10.5 and E12.5, CXXC5 expression was largely restricted to the dorsal pallium (Fig. 2, A and D). These regions are known to be rich in expression of BMP receptors as well as several BMP molecules, including BMP4 (2Panchision D.M. Pickel J.M. Studer L. Lee S.H. Turner P.A. Hazel T.G. McKay R.D. Genes Dev.. 2001; 15: 2094-2110Google Scholar, 3Hebert J.M. Mishina Y. McConnell S.K. Neuron.. 2002; 35: 1029-1041Google Scholar). Indeed in situ hybridization experiments using a probe for BMP4 demonstrated a clear overlap in expression of CXXC5 and BMP4 in the dorsal pallium (Fig. 2, A, B, D, and E). Importantly, CXXC5 expression was prominent in and around the developing choroid plexus (Fig. 2D), a non-neuronal structure producing and secreting the cerebrospinal fluid. At E14.5 however, only low levels of CXXC5 expression were detected (Fig. 2G), whereas BMP4 transcripts displayed a high expression selectively in the ventricular zone at the region of the developing choroid plexus (Fig. 2H). In addition to BMP4, the signaling molecule Wnt3a has been shown to be required for proper development of the dorsal telencephalon, influencing the development of the hippocampal formation and pyramidal neurons therein (10Sur M. Rubenstein J.L. Science.. 2005; 310: 805-810Google Scholar). At E10.5, Wnt3a mRNA showed an overlapping expression with CXXC5 and BMP4 (Fig. 2, A–C), while at E12.5 Wnt3a transcripts showed a marked reduction in expression just at the border of CXXC5 and BMP4 expression (Fig. 2, D–F), possibly demarcating the regions of the developing hippocampal formation and the choroid plexus. At E14.5 a marked expression of the Wnt3a gene was detected just lateral to the BMP4 expression (Fig. 2, H and I). The expression pattern of CXXC5 thus suggests that this factor could play a role in telencephalic development and strengthens the association between CXXC5 and high BMP signaling activity. CXXC5 Interacts with the Wnt Signaling Mediator Dishevelled in Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—CXXC5 has been predicted to be a paralogue of another CXXC domain containing factor named Idax (CXXC4) (11Hino S.

Supplementation of yeast cells with nicotinamide riboside extends replicative lifespan and increases Sir2-dependent gene silencing by virtue of increasing net NAD+ synthesis. Nicotinamide riboside elevates NAD+ levels via the nicotinamide riboside kinase pathway and by a pathway initiated by splitting the nucleoside into a nicotinamide base followed by nicotinamide salvage. Genetic evidence has established that uridine hydrolase, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and methylthioadenosine phosphorylase are required for Nrk-independent utilization of nicotinamide riboside in yeast. Here we show that mammalian purine nucleoside phosphorylase but not methylthioadenosine phosphorylase is responsible for mammalian nicotinamide riboside kinase-independent nicotinamide riboside utilization. We demonstrate that so-called uridine hydrolase is 100-fold more active as a nicotinamide riboside hydrolase than as a uridine hydrolase and that uridine hydrolase and mammalian purine nucleoside phosphorylase cleave nicotinic acid riboside, whereas the yeast phosphorylase has little activity on nicotinic acid riboside. Finally, we show that yeast nicotinic acid riboside utilization largely depends on uridine hydrolase and nicotinamide riboside kinase and that nicotinic acid riboside bioavailability is increased by ester modification.

Sirtuins utilize the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD+ to accept the acetyl modification of lysine, thereby producing a deacetylated protein plus Nam and a mixture of 2′- and 3′-acetylated ADP-ribose (2Tanny J.C.

ADP-ribose transferases and polyADP-ribose polymerases utilize NAD+ to add ADP-ribose as a post-translational modification and/or to form ADP-ribose polymers (12Burkle A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4576-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 13Schreiber V. Dantzer F. Ame J.C. de Murcia G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Immunol. 2000; 75: 39-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 15Ying W. Front Biosci. 2007; 12: 1863-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, via pleiotropic ways and means, NAD+ is a central mediator of cellular and organismal metabolism and signaling. Although co-enzymatic NAD+ functions do not necessitate ongoing NAD+ synthesis, the activities of the NAD+-consuming enzymes mandate either ongoing de novo or salvage synthesis (see Fig. 1). In yeast, de novo synthesis from tryptophan maintains intracellular NAD+ at ∼0.8 mm, at which concentration cells grow well but perform Sir2-dependent gene silencing poorly and have relatively short replicative life spans (16Belenky P. Racette F.G. Bogan K.L. McClure J.M. Smith J.S. Brenner C. Cell. 2007; 129: 473-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, supplementation with 10 μm nicotinamide riboside (NR) more than doubles intracellular NAD+ and doubles replicative longevity(16Belenky P. Racette F.G. Bogan K.L. McClure J.M. Smith J.S. Brenner C. Cell. 2007; 129: 473-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). NR is imported into yeast cells by a specific, pH-dependent NR transporter, Nrt1, with a Km of 22 μm (17Belenky P.A. Moga T.G. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8075-8079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). NR is converted to NAD+ in two steps by nicotinamide riboside kinase (Nrk)-dependent phosphorylation and adenylylation by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (18Bieganowski P. Brenner C. Cell. 2004; 117: 495-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Additionally, NR is split into Nam plus a ribosyl product for NAD+ synthesis through Nam salvage. Genetic analysis indicates that enzymes initially characterized for splitting other nucleosides, namely uridine hydrolase (Urh1), purine nucleoside phosphorylase (Pnp1), and methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (Meu1), are responsible for Nrk-independent NR utilization (16Belenky P.

Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Nicotinic acid riboside (NaR), synthesized from nicotinic acid riboside ethyl ester, can function as an NAD+ precursor in yeast, through both an Nrk-dependent and an Nrk-independent pathway (20Tempel W. Rabeh W.M. Bogan K.L. Belenky P. Wojcik M. Seidle H.F. Nedyalkova L. Yang T. Sauve A.A. Park H.W. Brenner C. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e263Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Human Nrk1 and Nrk2 are closely related ATP- and GTP-dependent metabolite kinases, which can function in place of yeast Nrk1 (18Bieganowski P. Brenner C. Cell. 2004; 117: 495-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Both enzymes have approximately equal activity in phosphorylation of NaR and NR and exhibit a crystallographically defined nucleoside-binding site with spatial complementarity to both substrates (20Tempel W. Rabeh W.M. Bogan K.L. Belenky P. Wojcik M. Seidle H.F. Nedyalkova L. Yang T. Sauve A.A. Park H.W. Brenner C. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e263Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As newly discovered eukaryotic NAD+ precursors, NR and NaR have the potential to be important mammalian nutritional supplements and/or drugs (19Ma B. Pan S.J. Zupancic M.L. Cormack B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Bogan K.L. Brenner C. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2008; 28: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). However, problems remain in understanding the nature of NR and NaR utilization in fungi and mammalian systems. Here we demonstrate that human Pnp but not human Mtap functions in two different yeast assays for NR utilization. Confirming the genetic results, we demonstrate that NR cleavage in mammalian systems is entirely phosphate-dependent and is sensitive to a specific inhibitor of Pnp. We purified yeast Pnp1 to conduct comparative enzymology with yeast and bovine enzymes. Although both enzymes convert NR to Nam with a specificity constant that is 8–13% as great as the corresponding inosine reaction, bovine but not yeast Pnp is also an NaR phosphorylase. Despite a recent claim that Urh1 is a uridine-specific nucleoside hydrolase (22Iovane E. Giabbai B. Muzzolini L. Matafora V. Fornili A. Minici C. Giannese F. Degano M. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4418-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), our kinetic analysis of recombinant Urh1 demonstrates a 100-fold greater specificity for NR than for uridine. Urh1 also functions in vitro and in vivo as an NaR hydrolase such that Nrk-independent NaR salvage in yeast principally depends on Urh1. Strains, Media, and Plasmids—Construction of yeast strains has been described (16Belenky P. Racette F.G. Bogan K.L. McClure J.M. Smith J.S. Brenner C. Cell. 2007; 129: 473-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 17Belenky P.A. Moga T.G. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8075-8079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A complete strain and plasmid list is found in the supplemental data. Yeast media were prepared as described (16Belenky P. Racette F.G. Bogan K.L. McClure J.M. Smith J.S. Brenner C. Cell. 2007; 129: 473-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). For yeast expression, human PNP and MTAP cDNAs were cloned under the control of the yeast PNP1 promoter. The yeast PNP1 promoter was amplified using primers 14093 and 14094, which appended HindIII and KpnI restriction sites. Human PNP and MTAP coding sequences were amplified from cDNAs purchased from ATCC and Origene using the primer pair 14091 and 14092 and the primer pair 14095 and 14096, respectively, which appended KpnI and EcoRI restriction sites. The promoter and cDNA products were digested with KpnI and then ligated, and the resulting linear products were gel-purified. Plasmid pRS327 and the linear products were then digested with HindIII and EcoRI and ligated to obtain pPAB011 and pPAB008 for yeast expression of PNP and MTAP, respectively. For bacterial expression, Pnp1 and Urh1 were fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP). The PNP1 coding sequence was amplified from DNA from yeast strain BY4742 using primers 14083 and 14084, which appended EcoRI and BsaI restriction sites. The PCR product was digested with BsaI, filled in with Klenow fragment, and then digested with EcoRI. The pMAL-c2x vector (New England Biolabs) was digested with XmnI and EcoRI and ligated with the blunt to EcoRI insert to generate plasmid pPAB006. The pMAL-URH1 plasmid pPAB003 was generated similarly, initiated with primers 14082 and 14085. DNA primer sequences are provided in the supplemental data. Enzyme Expression, Purification, and Kinetics—TB1 Escherichia coli transformants carrying pPAB003 or pPAB006 were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature for 8 h. Cells (1 liter at an A(600 nm) of 3.8) were lysed by sonication, and the MBP fusion proteins were purified by amylose affinity chromatography and eluted with maltose according to the New England Biolabs protocol. Maltose was removed by hydroxylapatite chromatography. MBP was cleaved from the enzymes of interest with factor Xa. Urh1 and Pnp1 were then recovered from the flow-through of a second amylose column. Bovine Pnp was purchased from Molecular Probes. Hydrolysis and/or phosphorolysis of NR, uridine, NaR, and NaR methyl ester (meNaR) were measured spectroscopically at 269, 280, 260, and 260 nm, respectively, as described (23Wielgus-Kutrowska B. Kulikowska E. Wierzchowski J. Bzowska A. Shugar D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24Magni G. Fioretti E. Ipata P.L. Natalini P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorolysis was measured in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and hydrolysis was measured in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Phosphorolysis of inosine was measure using the coupled xanthine oxidase procedure (23Wielgus-Kutrowska B. Kulikowska E. Wierzchowski J. Bzowska A. Shugar D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis and phosphorolysis activity of crude extracts and phosphorolysis activity of NaR by Pnp1 were measured by strong anion exchange HPLC separation using a sodium phosphate gradient as mobile phase (20Tempel W. Rabeh W.M. Bogan K.L. Belenky P. Wojcik M. Seidle H.F. Nedyalkova L. Yang T. Sauve A.A. Park H.W. Brenner C. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e263Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Reactions at all substrate concentrations were performed alongside no-enzyme controls to account for nonenzymatic nucleoside degradation. All reactions were conducted at room temperature. Data were fit and analyzed using Sigma Plot. Nucleosides—Inosine was purchased from Sigma. NR was produced both enzymatically and chemically as described (16Belenky P. Racette F.G. Bogan K.L. McClure J.M. Smith J.S. Brenner C. Cell. 2007; 129: 473-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 25Yang T. Chan N.Y. Sauve A.A. J. Med. Chem. 2007; 50: 6458-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Immucilin-H was a generous gift of Vern L. Schramm. Syntheses of NaR and meNaR and their verification by NMR are described in the supplemental data. The identities of all nucleosides were determined by strong anion exchange HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry. Human Pnp but Not Mtap Functions in NR Utilization—As Shown in Fig. 1, Qns1-independent NR utilization depends on Nrk1 (18Bieganowski P. Brenner C. Cell. 2004; 117: 495-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). However, when Nrk1 is deleted, NR can be converted to NAD+ via nucleoside splitting and Nam salvage (16Belenky P. Racette F.G. Bogan K.L. McClure J.M. Smith J.S. Brenner C. Cell. 2007; 129: 473-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). By genetic criteria, the enzyme with the greatest apparent role in Nrk1-independent NR utilization is Urh1, which has homologs in a limited number of fungi, protista, and eubacteria but not animals. The two other enzymes in yeast, Pnp1 and Meu1, the yeast homologs of mammalian Pnp and Mtap (26Lecoq K. Belloc I. Desgranges C. Konrad M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4910-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Chattopadhyay M.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), play a moderate and minor role, respectively, in Nrk1-independent NR utilization (16Belenky P. Racette F.G. Bogan K.L. McClure J.M. Smith J.S. Brenner C. Cell. 2007; 129: 473-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Pnp is an extensively studied enzyme (28Mao C. Cook W.J. Zhou M. Federov A.A. Almo S.C. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7135-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) whose human mutation produces symptoms similar to that of severe combined immunodeficiency (29Markert M.L. Immunodefic. Rev. 1991; 3: 45-81PubMed Google Scholar, 30Markert M.L. Finkel B.D. McLaughlin T.M. Watson T.J. Collard H.R. McMahon C.P. Andrews L.G. Barrett M.J. Ward F.E. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 9: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Indeed, because Pnp is critically important for T cell function, it is a target for immunosuppressive drugs (31Lewandowicz A. Tyler P.C. Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31465-31468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Mtap is required for the recycling of methylthioadenosine to maintain cellular S-adenosylmethionine (32Schramm V.L. Gutierrez J.A. Cordovano G. Basu I. Guha C. Belbin T.J. Evans G.B. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. (Oxf.). 2008; : 75-76Crossref Google Scholar), and its deletion is common in tumor cells (33Fernandez-Irigoyen J. Santamaria M. Sanchez-Quiles V. Latasa M.U. Santamaria E. Munoz J. Sanchez Del Pino M.M. Valero M.L. Prieto J. Avila M.A. Corrales F.J. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As an initial assay of whether Pnp or Mtap might function in NAD+ metabolism, human cDNAs encoding Pnp and Mtap were cloned into the pRS327 vector under the control of the yeast PNP1 promoter. We previously showed that the addition of 10 μm NR increases intracellular NAD+ from ∼0.8 to ∼2.0 mm in vitamin-free medium and that genetic deletion of nrk1, urh1, pnp1, and meu1 eliminates NR utilization (16Belenky P. Racette F.G. Bogan K.L. McClure J.M. Smith J.S. Brenner C. Cell. 2007; 129: 473-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Although the expression of Mtap on a multicopy vector failed to restore NR utilization to an nrk1 urh1 pnp1 meu1 strain, human Pnp allowed the yeast strain to increase intracellular NAD+ from 0.85 to 1.34 mm with the addition of 10 μm NR. By comparison, a yeast strain with an intact Nrk-independent salvage pathway (genotype nrk1) increased NAD+ levels from 0.67 to 1.87 mm (Fig. 2A). We previously demonstrated that provision of NR improves Sir2-dependent telomeric gene silencing (16Belenky P. Racette F.G. Bogan K.L. McClure J.M. Smith J.S. Brenner C. Cell. 2007; 129: 473-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). This assay is more sensitive than a measurement of intracellular NAD+ because it detects the slight but reproducible effect of MEU1 on NR-promoted gene silencing, whereas no effect of meu1 deletion was observed in an assay of NAD+ levels (16Belenky P. Racette F.G. Bogan K.L. McClure J.M. Smith J.S. Brenner C. Cell. 2007; 129: 473-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The gene silencing assay utilizes a yeast strain in which the URA3 gene is integrated at a Sir2-silenced telomeric locus. Because URA3 expression confers sensitivity to 5-fluoroorotic acid (5FOA), URA3 silencing can be scored by resistance to 5FOA (34Smith J.S. Brachmann C.B. Celic I. Kenna M.A. Muhammad S. Starai V.J. Avalos J.L. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Grubmeyer C. Wolberger C. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6658-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2B, all strains exhibited 5FOA-resistant growth when supplemented with 10 μm nicotinic acid (NA), indicating strong gene silencing, and showed complete 5FOA sensitivity on NA-free plates, indicating poor silencing. The wild-type strain and the strains lacking only one of the NR-salvaging pathways (i.e. nrk1 or urh1 pnp1 meu1) exhibited 5FOA-resistant growth with 1 or 10 μm NR. However, the strain with nrk1 deleted along with deletion of urh1 pnp1 and meu1 remained 5FOA-sensitive with the addition of NR to 10 μm. Although expression of human Pnp restored convincing 5FOA-resistant growth, the Mtap construct was incapable of contributing to gene silencing (Fig. 2B). Thus, of the two human enzymes homologous to yeast enzymes, which participate in Nrk-independent NR salvage, we demonstrate a role for Pnp but not Mtap as an NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme. Mammalian NR to Nam Conversion Is Phosphorolytic and Sensitive to a Specific Inhibitor of Pnp—Phosphorolysis of NR has been reported to be a function of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (23Wielgus-Kutrowska B.

PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e263Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) hydrolytic enzyme, we wished to test whether mammalian NR-splitting extracts contain any hydrolase activity and whether the phosphorylase activity is sensitive to a specific inhibitor of Pnp. We prepared a cellular lysate from 13 mouse livers and recovered the majority of NR-splitting activity in the 60% ammonium sulfate pellet fraction. When this enzyme fraction was dialyzed against phosphate-free buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) and assayed in the same buffer, no NR to Nam conversion was observed despite increasing the amount of enzyme fraction by 100-fold and extending incubation to overnight. As shown in Fig. 3A, the addition of 50 mm phosphate to this reaction restored enzymatic activity to a Vmax of 4.7 ± 0.2 nmol/μg/h, indicating that all detectable NR to Nam cleavage in mouse liver is phosphorolytic. Despite the crude system, the Km of this reaction, 510 ± 70 μm, is within 2-fold of the Km of bovine Pnp (Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of Pnp1, bovine Pnp and Urh1Kmkcatkcat/Kmμms-1s-1 m-1Pnp1Inosine33.0 ± 5.23.8 ± 0.1115,000NR1,020 ± 14011. ± 0.611,000NaR3,000 ± 1,0000.13 ± 0.0240Bovine PnpInosine51.0 ± 5.114 ± 3.8275,000NR900 ± 10031.2 ± 2.235,000NaR900 ± 2304.4 ± 0.64,900Urh1Uridine1,600 ± 50020.0 ± 4.4125,000NR16.0 ± 223.4 ± 0.81,430,000NaR150.0 ± 401.8 ± 0.912,000MeNaR45.0 ± 152.3 ± 0.251,000 Open table in a new tab Nucleoside to nucleobase conversion was also tested in soluble extracts of human CACO-2 cells, an intestinal epithelial cell line. At 500 mm inosine, phosphorolytic conversion to hypoxanthine occurred with a specific activity of 650 ± 10 pmol/μg/h. NR to Nam conversion at 500 mm was ∼3.5 times slower with a specific activity of 180 ± 20 pmol/μg/h. Immucilin-H is a specific inhibitor of Pnp with a Ki of 56 pm for the human enzyme (31Lewandowicz A. Tyler P.C. Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31465-31468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, inosine to hypoxanthine conversion and NR to Nam conversion were exquisitely sensitive to inhibition by 100 nm immucillin-H. This result, in combination with data from Figs. 2 and 3A, indicate that Pnp is the apparently unique Nrk1-independent NR salvage enzyme in mammalian cells. Urh1 Is Expressed at a Higher Level than Pnp1—Previously, we demonstrated that Urh1 makes a greater contribution to Nrk1-independent NR salvage than does Pnp1 or Meu1 (16Belenky P. Racette F.G. Bogan K.L. McClure J.M. Smith J.S. Brenner C. Cell. 2007; 129: 473-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). To determine whether this is due, in part, to increased protein levels, we measured the steady-state levels of endogenously expressed, C-terminally epitope-tagged Urh1, Pnp1, Meu1, and Nrk1 (37Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar) by Western blot of cells grown in the presence and absence of 100 μm NR. As shown in Fig. 4, the addition of NR did not alter expression of any of the NR salvage enzymes. Earlier, we showed that in the Nrk1-independent NR salvage pathway, the rank order of contributions is Urh1 > Pnp1 > Meu1. However, the rank order of steady-state expression is Meu1 > Urh1 > Nrk1 > Pnp1. Thus, although the greater role of Urh1 than Pnp1 in cellular NR to nicotinamide salvage may be attributable, in part, to greater expression level, the lesser role of Meu1 in NR salvage is despite high expression. Urh1 Prefers NR to Uridine by 100-fold—Prior to the identification of the URH1 gene in 2001, a uridine nucleosidase activity purified from baker’s yeast was described. This activity possessed a Km for uridine of 0.9 mm and showed strong discrimination against other nucleosides including thymidine, cytidine, adenosine, inosine, and guanosine (24Magni G. Fioretti E. Ipata P.L. Natalini P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). URH1 was subsequently cloned, and its biochemical activity was ascribed to that of the uridine nucleosidase without any characterization of the recombinant enzyme (38Mitterbauer R. Karl T. Adam G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 1336-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 39Kurtz J.E. Exinger F. Erbs P. Jund R. Curr. Genet. 2002; 41: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Urh1 was recently classified as a uridine-preferring pyrimidine nucleoside hydrolase in a study that investigated pyrimidine versus purine nucleoside specificity (22Iovane E. Giabbai B. Muzzolini L. Matafora V. Fornili A. Minici C. Giannese F. Degano M. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4418-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, given our genetic assignment of Urh1 as an NR (16Belenky P. Racette F.G. Bogan K.L. McClure J.M. Smith J.S. Brenner C. Cell. 2007; 129: 473-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and NaR (20Tempel W. Rabeh W.M. Bogan K.L. Belenky P. Wojcik M. Seidle H.F. Nedyalkova L. Yang T. Sauve A.A. Park H.W. Brenner C. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e263Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) hydrolase, it was important to characterize pyrimidine versus pyridine nucleoside specificity. Urh1 activity was unaffected by EDTA or the addition of MgCl2. Urh1 hydrolyzed uridine to uracil at high substrate concentrations. As shown in Table 1, the Kmvalue for uridine was 1.6 mm, with a kcat of 20 s–1. However, despite a gene and enzyme name suggesting that uridine is the preferred substrate, Urh1 prefers NR by greater than 100-fold by depression of the Km to 16 μm and maintaining kcat at 23 s–1. The actual contributions of Urh1 to uridine and NR flux remain unknown because the concentrations of these substrates are unknown. Thus, it is conceivable that uridine hydrolysis at high cellular concentrations of uridine is an unavoidable consequence of NR hydrolysis at low cellular concentrations of NR. It is also conceivable that Urh1 is tuned to the cellular concentrations of NR and uridine. Yeast and Bovine Pnp Prefer Inosine to NR by 10-fold—Although terms such as “uridine hydrolase” and “purine nucleoside phosphorylase” suggest a simplified set of reactions in which single enzymes have only one or two substrates, in fact, multiple enzymes, expressed at different levels, participate in the consumption of multiple competitive substrates. Bovine and human Pnp are enzymes with well characterized specificity for guanosine and inosine (40Stoeckler J.D. Poirot A.F. Smith R.M. Parks Jr., R.E. Ealick S.E. Takabayashi K. Erion M.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11749-11756Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Bovine and bacterial Pnp have been reported to exhibit a 50-fold preference for inosine over NR (23Wielgus-Kutrowska B. Kulikowska E. Wierzchowski J. Bzowska A. Shugar D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We purified yeast Pnp1 to measure the phosphorylase activity of recombinant Pnp1 and bovine Pnp on both inosine and NR and to place the kinetic constants of these enzymes on a common scale with Urh1 and the human Nrk enzymes (20Tempel W. Rabeh W.M. Bogan K.L. Belenky P. Wojcik M. Seidle H.F. Nedyalkova L. Yang T. Sauve A.A. Park H.W. Brenner C. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e263Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As shown in Table 1, yeast Pnp1 exhibited a specificity constant for NR greater than 9% of the corresponding value for inosine with the difference mediated by a 31-fold disadvantage in Km offset by a 2.9-fold advantage in kcat. Bovine Pnp exhibited similar discrimination. NR was phosphorylized at 13% of the inosine specificity constant with the difference mediated by an 18-fold disadvantage in Km offset by a 2.2-fold advantage in kcat. The absolute specificity constants (Table 1) and relative protein expression levels (Fig. 4) of Urh1 and Pnp1 can also be compared. Urh1 possesses greater than 100-fold more activity on NR than does Pnp1 and is expressed at a higher level. Thus, the fact that Pnp1 appears to be responsible for 25–35% of Nrk1-independent NR salvage suggests that in vivo Urh1 activity might be attenuated by competition for other substrates. NaR Is a Hydrolysis Substrate of Urh1 but a Poor Substrate of Yeast Pnp1—Our previously work showed that NaR, synthesized from NaR ethyl ester, can serve as an NAD+ precursor in a manner that depends on the Nrk1 and the Urh1/Pnp1 pathways (20Tempel W. Rabeh W.M. Bogan K.L. Belenky P. Wojcik M. Seidle H.F. Nedyalkova L. Yang T. Sauve A.A. Park H.W. Brenner C. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e263Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, the increase in NAD+ levels provided by this precursor supplied at 10 μm was only 34% of the increase in NAD+ levels with provision of 10 μm NR. We also demonstrated that human Nrk1 and Nrk2 phosphorylate NaR and NR with equal efficiency (20Tempel W. Rabeh W.M. Bogan K.L. Belenky P. Wojcik M. Seidle H.F. Nedyalkova L. Yang T. Sauve A.A. Park H.W. Brenner C. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e263Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These data indicated that NaR is a substrate of Pnp1 and/or Urh1. Moreover, there is a suggestion in the data that NaR is either transported less efficiently than NR or split less efficiently by the enzymes of the Urh1/Pnp1 pathway. As shown in Table 1, Urh1 hydrolyzes NaR to NA with a Km of 150 μm and a kcat of 1.8 s–1. The resulting specificity constant of 11,000 s–1m–1 is 130-fold lower than that for NR and on a par with the activity of Urh1 for uridine. Yeast Pnp1 showed no NaR phosphorolysis activity in 30-min continuous spectroscopic assays. However, HPLC runs of the endpoints of the assays indicated low level enzymatic consumption of NaR. To measure this activity, we ran 18-h end point assays and analyzed products by HPLC. As shown in Table 1, the measured Km for NaR is 3 mm, and the kcat is 0.13 s–1. The resulting specificity constant for yeast Pnp1 for NaR phosphorolysis, 40 s–1m–1, compares poorly with that of Urh1 for NaR hydrolysis. These data suggest that Pnp1 may play a negligible role in NaR utilization. Bovine Pnp proved to be over 120-fold more active on NaR than yeast Pnp1. Moreover, as shown in Table 1, the Km of bovine Pnp for NaR, 900 μm, is nearly identical to its Km for NR, such that discrimination in favor of NR is driven by the kcat term. Although the expression levels of Pnp and Nrk isozymes in mammalian systems are likely to be cell type-specific and regulated, our data support the prediction that NR and NaR utilization in mammals depends on both enzyme systems. meNaR Is a Better NAD+ Precursor than NaR—We prepared NaR enzymatically from nicotinic acid mononucleotide (16Belenky P. Racette F.G. Bogan K.L. McClure J.M. Smith J.S. Brenner C. Cell. 2007; 129: 473-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and chemically from meNaR (see supplemental data). We found that the pure, chemically or enzymatically synthesized NaR provided at 10 μm failed to increase intracellular NAD+, whereas 100 μm NaR increased intracellular NAD+ only 16% as much as did 10 μm NR (Fig. 5A). Surprisingly, 10 μm meNAR increased intracellular NAD+ to a greater degree than did 10 μm NaR. meNAR also produced a dose-dependent increase in intracellular NAD+. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 5B, although 1 μm NR and 1 μm meNAR supported the vigorous growth of a bna1 mutant, which is deficient in de novo NAD+ biosynthesis, 1 μm NaR did not. These data suggest that the methyl ester modification of NaR facilitates nucleoside transport and/or enzymatic cleavage of the methyl ester base from the ribose. meNaR Is a Better Urh1 Substrate than NaR—Data indicating that meNaR is a better NAD+ precursor than NaR prompted us to test whether the major Nrk-independent NR/NaR salvage enzyme, Urh1, prefers meNaR to NaR. Remarkably, as shown in Table 1, the methyl esterified pyridine nucleoside is preferred by Urh1 by a factor of 5.4-fold. On the other hand, Pnp1 had little detectable activity on meNaR. We were unable to measure specific kinetic constants for the cleavage of meNaR by Pnp1 because the nonenzymatic conversion of meNaR to NaR was ∼100 times faster than the enzymatic cleavage of the glycosidic bond. The specific enzymatic activity of Pnp1 on meNaR is <100 pmol/min/μg, which is ∼25% less than the specific activity of Pnp1 on NaR. Although NR makes use of a specific nucleoside transporter with a Km for NR of 22 μm (17Belenky P.A. Moga T.G. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8075-8079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and has the ability to support yeast cell growth at a supplement concentration of 1 μm, NaR is a poor supplement, which depends on synthetic ester modifications to improve availability to yeast. These data suggest that a distinction be drawn between NR and NaR as yeast NAD+ precursors. Although both compounds function as salvageable metabolites, NR has the characteristics of a yeast vitamin, whereas meNaR has the characteristics of a low potency provitamin, which can be utilized once it gains entry to cells. Nrk1 and Urh1 Are Responsible for in Vivo meNaR Utilization—Based on the protein expression data in Fig. 4 and the kinetic data in Table 1, we hypothesized that Urh1 is responsible for the majority of Nrk-independent NaR/meNaR utilization. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the meNaR-dependent NAD+ increase in wild-type yeast and in strains deleted for specific components of NaR salvage (Fig. 6). As suspected, deleting pnp1 in the nrk1 background had no detectable effect on meNaR utilization, indicating that Pnp1 does not play a major role in meNaR utilization. On the other hand, deleting urh1 in the nrk1 background lowered the meNaR-dependent NAD+ increase from 1.2 to 0.21 mm. This result indicates that Urh1 is responsible for the majority of Nrk-independent meNaR utilization. Finally, the triple deletion of nrk1 urh1 pnp1 abolished the NAD+ increase from meNaR, demonstrating that Pnp1 has a minor role in meNaR utilization in the absence of Urh1, consistent with the kinetic data. Conclusions—We have undertaken to discover and dissect all components of eukaryotic NAD+ salvage pathways and have discovered unanticipated features and complexity (16Belenky P. Racette F.G.

Chem. 2006; 281: 33395-33402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here we clarified several features of fungal and mammalian salvage of NR and NaR. First, we provide evidence that Pnp but not Mtap has the characteristics of the mammalian NR phosphorylase, and we see no evidence of a mammalian NR hydrolytic activity. Second, we establish that the greater role in yeast of Urh1 than Pnp1 in NR and NaR metabolism is dually driven by higher expression and higher intrinsic activity. Third, we discover that yeast Urh1 is a highly specific NR hydrolase with lower activity on uridine and NaR. This has broad implications on the function of homologous enzymes, which have been termed pyrimidine nucleoside hydrolases (22Iovane E. Giabbai B. Muzzolini L. Matafora V. Fornili A. Minici C. Giannese F. Degano M. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4418-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fourth, we extend knowledge on mammalian Pnp activity, showing that both NR and NaR are alternative substrates for this enzyme. Finally, we reveal that the yeast NAD+ precursor activity of NaR depends largely on ester modification of the acid group, which promotes salvage by Urh1. In the future, we plan to determine to what degree NR utilization by particular mammalian cells depends on the Nrk and the Pnp pathways and to dissect the cellular basis for NR and NaR as intracellular metabolites.

Here we show that monocytic leukemia zinc finger (MOZ) forms a complex with p53 to induce p21 expression and cell-cycle arrest. The levels of the p53-MOZ complex increased in response to DNA damage to levels that induce cell-cycle arrest. MOZ–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts failed to arrest in G1 in response to DNA damage, and DNA damage-induced expression of p21 was impaired in MOZ–/– cells. These results suggest that MOZ is involved in regulating cell-cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Screening of tumor-associated p53 mutants demonstrated that the G279E mutation in p53 disrupts interactions between p53 and MOZ, but does not affect the DNA binding activity of p53. The leukemia-associated MOZ-CBP fusion protein inhibits p53-mediated transcription.

The level of the p53-MOZ complex increases after DNA damage, contributing to cell-cycle arrest in the G1 phase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—cDNAs encoding FLAG-tagged or HA-tagged human MOZ, CBP, MOZ-CBP, and AML1 were cloned into the pLNCX retroviral mammalian expression vector, as previously described (32Kitabayashi I. Aikawa Y. Nguyen L.A. Yokoyama A. Ohki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7184-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The sequences of the above constructs were checked by DNA sequencing. N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of MOZ cDNAs were generated by PCR with human wild-type MOZ as the template. The PCR-amplified deletion MOZ fragments were cloned into the HA-tagged pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen). S15A, S15D, S20A, S20D, S46A, S46D, K382R, and K382Q mutants of p53 were derived from FLAG-tagged p53-pLNCX by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene).Cells—Wild-type and MOZ–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared from E13.5 embryos and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol. Bosc 23 and Saos-2 cells were cultured as previously described (32Kitabayashi I. Aikawa Y. Nguyen L.A. Yokoyama A. Ohki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7184-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).Purification of the MOZ Complex and Mass Spectrometry—Bosc 23 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-MOZ-pLNCX by using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Transfected cells (1 × 1010) were solubilized by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min in 50 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and incubated with 2.5 ml of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2)-conjugated affinity beads with rotation at 4 °C for 4 h. The beads were washed eight times, each with 50 ml of lysis buffer. The MOZ complexes were selectively eluted by incubating with 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide in lysis buffer for 1 h. The eluates were concentrated and separated using 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, excised, destained with 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 50% acetonitrile, dried, digested with sequence grade modified trypsin (Promega) in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), extracted with 5% trifluoroacetic acid and 50% acetonitrile, and subjected to LC/MS/MS analysis. LC/MS/MS analysis was performed as previously described (32Kitabayashi I. Aikawa Y. Nguyen L.A. Yokoyama A. Ohki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7184-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunoblot analyses were performed as previously described (38Kitabayashi I. Yokoyama A. Shimizu K. Ohki M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2994-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In short, cells were solubilized with lysis buffer as described above, and sonicated 6 times for 10 s using a BioRuptor (Cosmo Bio) at the high power setting. Cell lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2)-conjugated affinity beads (Sigma) for 4 h at 4°C. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitates were selectively eluted by incubating with 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide in lysis buffer for 1 h. The eluates were concentrated and separated by SDS-PAGE. The rabbit polyclonal antibody to MOZ has been described previously (28Kitabayashi I. Aikawa Y. Yokoyama A. Hosoda F. Nagai M. Kakazu N. Abe T. Ohki M. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Commercially purchased antibodies to human p53 (DO-1), p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-p53 (Ser15, 16G8), phospho-p53 (Ser20), phospho-p53 (Ser46), FLAG M2, β-actin (Sigma), HA (3F10) (Roche), and mouse p53 (Ab-1) (Calbiochem) were also used in this study.GST Pull-down Assays—For GST pull-down assays, in vitro translated products were generated using the TnT Quick Coupled System (Promega). In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of MOZ were incubated in the presence or absence of GST-tagged p53 and in the presence of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) in IP buffer overnight at 4 °C. The affinity beads were washed five times with IP buffer. The precipitates were subsequently resolved by SDS-PAGE and the [35S]methionine-labeled proteins visualized by autoradiography (BAS2000, FUJIX).Flow Cytometry—For flow cytometry analysis, cells were first fixed with 70% ethanol and then incubated with RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml propidium iodide in 0.1% sodium citrate and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then analyzed using a FACS Calibur instrument (BD Biosciences) and Cell Quest software.Luciferase Assays—Saos-2 cells were transfected in 24-well plates using the calcium phosphate precipitation method, and luciferase activity was assayed after 24 h using a luminometer (Veritas Microplate Luminometer, Turner Biosystems), according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega). The results presented are the mean ± S.D. of relative luciferase activity generated from three independent experiments normalized against the activity of the internal control enzyme from pRL-CMV.Semiquantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR experiments were carried out with cDNAs generated from 2 μg of total RNA using a GeneAmp RNA PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems). The RT-PCR exponential phase was determined from 30 cycles of amplification to allow semiquantitative comparisons of cDNAs developed from identical reactions. All reactions involved initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min using a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems). Primers used in the RT-PCR study were as follows: mouse p21, 5′-CCGCACAGGAGCAAAGTGTG-3′ and 5′-GAATCTTCAGGCCGCTCAGAC-3′; mouse Bax, 5′-GCTGATGGCAACTTCAACTG-3′ and 5′-CACAAAGATGGTCACTGTCTG-3′; mouse Mdm2, 5′-CCTGTCCCAGGAGAGTGAC-3′ and 5′-GATTGGCTGTCTGCACACTG-3′; mouse Puma, 5′-GAGCCAAACCTGACCACTAG-3′ and 5′-GTGGTCACACGTGCTCTCTC-3′; control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-CTTCACCACCATGGAGAAGGC-3′ and 5′-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG-3′.DNA Binding Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from Bosc 23 cells 24 h after transfection with wild-type or mutant p53. Procedures for DNA binding reactions were similar to those previously described (39Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3975-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures contained 4 μg of extract in 18 μl of binding buffer (50 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), plus 1 μg of sonicated DNA from salmon testes. The double-stranded p21 oligonucleotide probe 5′-GTCAGGAACATGTCCCAACATGTTGAGCTC-3′ was derived from the p21Waf1 promoter. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 15–20 min at 23 °C with the addition of 1 ng of radiolabeled probe. Each reaction mixture was then loaded onto a native 4% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:Bis, 50:1; 0.5 × TBE) and electrophoresed in 0.25 × TBE at 180–220 V for 3 h at 4 °C.ChIP Assays—MCF-7 cells were fixed directly by adding 270 μl of 37% formaldehyde to 10 ml of culture medium and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The fixed cells were harvested and prepared for immunoprecipitation using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, the lysates were precleared with salmon sperm DNA-protein A-agarose, and subsequently incubated with 1 μg of anti-p53 antibody (DO-1) (Santa Cruz), anti-MOZ antibody, or control IgG at 4 °C overnight. Samples were washed with low salt buffer, high salt buffer, once with LiCl, and twice with TE. Immune complexes were eluted (cross-links reversed), and then purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Samples (5 μl) were subjected to PCR amplification. The PCR were carried out with Pfu Turbo DNA Polymerase (Stratagene).All reactions involved initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min using a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems). The PCR primers used were as follows: p21RE1, 5′-CAGGCTGTGGCTCTGATTGG-3′ and 5′-TTCAGAGTAACAGGCTAAGG-3′; p21RE2, 5′-GGTCTGCTACTGTGTCCTCC-3′ and 5′-CATCTGAACAGAAATCCCAC-3′; p21 (–1808), 5′-CTTAAGAAATATTGAATGTCG-3′ and 5′-CTAGACATTGTCTGTCTG-3′; mdm2, 5′-TGGGCAGGTTGACTCAGCTTTTCCTC-3′ and 5′-TTCCGAAGCTGGAATCTGTGAGGTGG-3′; bax, 5′-CAGCGCTTTGGAAGGCTGAGAC-3′ and 5′-GTGACTGTCCAATGAGCATCTC-3′; and puma, 5′-GAGACTGTGGCCTTGTGTC-3′ and 5′-GGACAAGTCAGGACTTGCAG-3′.Cytotoxicity Assays—Wild-type (WT), MOZ–/–, and p53–/– MEF cells were plated in 96-well plates at a concentration of 1 × 104 cells in 100 μl of complete medium. After a 12-h incubation, MEF cells were treated with 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, or 10 μm adriamycin (ADR). After 36- or 48-h incubations, cell viability, based on mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity, was measured using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojin), which utilizes a WST-8 (2-[2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl]-3-[4-nitrophenyl]-5-[2,4-disulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt) assay. Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.Antisense Oligonucleotides—To inhibit expression of endogenous MOZ, small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex with a 3′ dTdT overhang corresponding to MOZ mRNA (AAGGAUAUGCAAUGCUGUGUC) was synthesized (Dharmacon). Nonspecific control siRNA (Dharmacon) was used as a negative control. Antisense oligonucleotides (200 nm) were transfected twice using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).RESULTSInteraction between p53 and MOZ—To identify MOZ-interacting proteins, we purified MOZ complexes. The complexes of MOZ were partially purified using affinity beads conjugated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Fig. 1A). The MOZ-purified fraction contained multiple proteins that were absent from the mock-purified fraction, suggesting that they interact specifically with MOZ. To identify these proteins in the MOZ fraction, we analyzed these specific proteins using mass spectrometry analysis and found that the spectrum obtained from peptides was identified as p53, as well as BRPF1 (40Doyon Y. Cayrou C. Ullah M. Landry A.J. Cote V. Selleck W. Lane W.S. Tan S. Yang X.J. Cote J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 51-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), C23, HSP70, and B23 (Fig. 1A). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that these putative associated proteins, including p53, were co-precipitated with MOZ (Fig. 1B). Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation showed that MOZ was co-precipitated with p53 (Fig. 1C).Interacting Domains on p53 and MOZ—To determine the p53-interacting domains of MOZ, the interaction between MOZ and p53 was examined by IP immunoblot analysis using deletion mutants of MOZ. Bosc 23 cells, which exhibit very high transfection efficiency, were transfected with FLAG-tagged p53 and HA-tagged wild-type or mutant MOZ. The expression of MOZ mutants and results of the IP immunoblot analysis are shown in supplemental Fig. S1, and summarized in Fig. 1D. These results suggest that there are at least two p53-interacting domains in MOZ, one lies in the basic domain between amino acids 312 and 664, and another lies in the serine-rich domain between amino acids 1517 and 1741. Similarly, to determine the region of p53 required for binding to MOZ, IP immunoblot analysis was conducted using a series of p53 deletion mutants. Each of the p53 mutants was immunoprecipitated by using anti-FLAG antibody M2 (supplemental Fig. S2), and the results are summarized in Fig. 1E. These results suggest that the p53-core DNA binding domain (amino acids 98–180 and 202–296) is required for its interaction with MOZ. To further examine whether these interactions are direct or indirect, we performed in vitro GST pull-down assays, and showed that either the N or C terminus of MOZ could interact directly with p53 in vitro (Fig. 1F).Impaired G1 Arrest in MOZ–/– Cells—To investigate the role of MOZ in DNA damage responses, we tested the effects of ADR on cell cycle progression in wild-type and MOZ–/– MEFs. Analysis by flow cytometry showed that wild-type cells were arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and that the number of cells in G1 peaked 12 h after ADR treatment (Fig. 2, A and B). However, in MOZ-deficient cells, the number of cells in the G1 phase decreased after ADR treatment, and the number of apoptotic cells in the sub-G1 phase increased (Fig. 2, A and C). These differences in sensitivity to ADR-induced DNA damage were also observed in TUNEL assays (Fig. 2D) and in cytotoxicity assays (Fig. 2E). These results suggest that in response to DNA damage, MOZ-deficient cells failed to arrest in G1 phase and tended to undergo apoptosis.FIGURE 2MOZ-deficient cells fail to arrest in G1 phase in response to DNA damage. A, induction of G1 arrest after ADR treatment in wild-type (WT) MEFs, but not MOZ–/– MEFs. FACS analysis at the indicated times after 5 μm ADR treatment of WT and MOZ–/– MEF cells.

To test this hypothesis, we examined the expression of the p53 target gene p21 after ADR treatment. In wild-type MEFs, p21 expression increased after ADR treatment in a dose-dependent manner and reached a maximum at 6–12 h (Fig. 3, A and B, supplemental Fig. S3, A–C). However, expression and induction of p21 were profoundly impaired in MOZ–/– MEFs as assessed by immunoblot analysis, Northern blotting, and real-time RT-PCR analyses. Furthermore, expression of the other p53 target genes, such as Mdm2, Bax, and Puma, were induced by ADR treatment both in wild-type and MOZ–/– cells (supplemental Fig. S3, D and E). Thus, these results suggested that MOZ is required for p53-induced expression of p21, but not for those of Bax, Mdm2, and Puma.FIGURE 3MOZ activates p53-mediated transcription of p21. A, impaired p21 expression in MOZ knock-out cells. Expression of p53 and p21 at the indicated times following 5 μm ADR treatment in wild-type (WT) or MOZ–/– MEF cells. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot analysis using anti-p21, anti-p53, or anti-β-actin (loading control) antibodies. B, impaired p21 induction in MOZ knock-out cells. Induction of p21 and β-actin at the indicated times following 5 μm ADR treatment in WT or MOZ–/– MEF cells. RT-PCR analysis was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, effects of MOZ and p300 on p53 activity. Saos-2 cells were transfected with 50 ng of p21-luc, 10 ng of pLNCX-p53 (lanes 5–11), and 30 (lanes 2, 6, and 9), 100 (lanes 3, 7, and 10), or 350 ng (lanes 4, 8, and 11) of pLNCX-MOZ (lanes 2–4 and 6–8), or pLNCX-p300 (lanes 9-11) and pRL-CMV. Luciferase assays were performed 24 h post-transfection. The expression levels of transfected p53 and MOZ/p300 are shown below in C. D, ChIP assays were performed to assess the co-association of p53, MOZ, and p300 at different p21 promoter regions 12 h after 30 J/m2 UV irradiation (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) in MCF-7 cells. Cell extracts were subjected to ChIP assays with anti-p53 (DO-1, lanes 5 and 6), anti-MOZ (lanes 7 and 8), or anti-p300 (lanes 9 and 10), as well as an IgG control (lanes 3 and 4). Precipitates were analyzed by PCR using the indicated p21 promoter primers shown at the top of the panel. E, ChIP assay at the p21RE1 promoter region in wild-type or MOZ knockdown cells. MCF-7 cells were transfected twice with either control siRNA or MOZ siRNA. At 36 h post-transfection, the cells were treated either with 30 J/m2 of UV radiation or 5 μm ADR. After 12 h the cell extracts were subjected to ChIP assay with anti-p53 antibody (IP: DO-1) as well as IgG control (IP: IgG). Immunoprecipitated and input DNA (INPUT DNA) were then subjected to RT-PCR analysis using p21RE1 promoter primer. Input lysates were partially subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-p53 or anti-MOZ antibodies (lower panels). F, ChIP assay at the p21RE1 promoter region in wild-type (p53+/+) or p53-depleted (p53–/–) HCT-116 cells. The cells were transfected twice with either control siRNA or MOZ siRNA. At 36 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with (UV) or without (Con)30 J/m2 of UV radiation. After 12 h, the cell extracts were subjected to ChIP assay with anti-p53 (IP: DO-1) or anti-MOZ (IP: MOZ) antibodies as well as IgG control (IP: IgG). Immunoprecipitated and input DNA (INPUT DNA) were then subjected to RT-PCR analysis using p21RE1 promoter primer.

https://openalex.org/W2068395411,"Previously, we demonstrated that mitochondria from denervated muscle exhibited dramatically higher Amplex Red dependent fluorescence (thought to be highly specific for hydrogen peroxide) compared with control muscle mitochondria. We now demonstrate that catalase only partially inhibits the Amplex Red signal in mitochondria from denervated muscle. In contrast, ebselen (a glutathione peroxidase mimetic and inhibitor of fatty acid hydroperoxides) significantly inhibits the Amplex Red signal. This suggests that the majority of the Amplex Red signal in mitochondria from denervated muscle is not derived from hydrogen peroxide. Because Amplex Red cannot react with substrates in the lipid environment, we hypothesize that lipid hydroperoxides formed within the mitochondrial lipid bilayer are released as fatty acid hydroperoxides and react with the Amplex Red probe. We also suggest that the release of fatty acid hydroperoxides from denervated muscle mitochondria may be an important determinant of muscle atrophy. In support of this, muscle atrophy and the Amplex Red signal are inhibited in caloric restricted mice and in transgenic mice that overexpress the lipid hydroperoxide-detoxifying enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4. Finally, we propose that cytosolic phospholipase A2 may be a potential source of these hydroperoxides.

Recent studies using this denervation model in rodents point to a role of mitochondrial oxidative stress in the mechanism of muscle atrophy (11Adhihetty P.J. O'Leary M.F. Chabi B. Wicks K.L.

We recently reported a significant elevation in mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using the Amplex Red probe in various mouse models that exhibit muscle atrophy associated with loss of innervation aging, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase knockout (Sod1–/–) mice, and the G93A Sod1 mutant mouse model of ALS (13Muller F.L. Song W. Liu Y. Chaudhuri A. Pieke-Dahl S. Strong R. Huang T.T. Epstein C.J. Roberts 2nd, L.J. Csete M. Faulkner J.A. Van Remmen H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 1993-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrated that ROS were significantly elevated in muscle mitochondria isolated from mice 7 days after surgical sciatic nerve transection (13Muller F.L. Song W. Liu Y. Chaudhuri A. Pieke-Dahl S. Strong R. Huang T.T. Epstein C.J. Roberts 2nd, L.J. Csete M. Faulkner J.A. Van Remmen H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 1993-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). ROS production was positively correlated with the extent of muscle atrophy, indicating that mitochondrial oxidative stress may have a major role in muscle atrophy associated with loss of innervation. Reports from other laboratories have also demonstrated that mitochondrial ROS production is significantly elevated in atrophied muscles from aging rats and in rats that underwent denervation surgery (11Adhihetty P.J. O'Leary M.F. Chabi B. Wicks K.L. Hood D.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 2007; 102: 1143-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 18Chabi B. Ljubicic V. Menzies K.J. Huang J.H. Saleem A. Hood D.A. Aging Cell. 2008; 7: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the nature of the radical species released from isolated mitochondria following denervation by sciatic nerve transection. We propose that the majority of ROS production from muscle mitochondria post-denervation surgery may be due to fatty acid hydroperoxides rather than hydrogen peroxide/superoxide. We also hypothesize that the release of fatty acid hydroperoxides from denervated muscle mitochondria may be mediated by calcium-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). Finally, our data suggest that fatty acid hydroperoxides may be of pathophysiological relevance because interventions that minimize oxidative stress in general (caloric restriction) as well as lipid hydroperoxides specifically (glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4)) inhibited denervation-induced muscle atrophy. Experimental Animals—All of the denervation experiments in this study were performed in 3–9-month-old C57BL/6 female mice. The mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions, housed 3–4/cage, maintained in a 12:12 (light:dark) cycle at 22 ± 2 °C and 50 ± 10% relative humidity. The mice were fed either ad libitum (AL) or calorie-restricted (CR, 40% fewer calories than AL) diets. Sod1–/– and G93A mice are described in an earlier publication (12Muller F.L. Song W. Jang Y.C. Liu Y. Sabia M. Richardson A. Van Remmen H. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: R1159-R1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To harvest skeletal muscle, the mice were euthanized using a CO2 chamber followed by cervical dislocation. All of the procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and the Audie L. Murphy Veterans Hospital. Denervation Surgery—Surgical sciatic nerve transection was performed using constant flow isoflurane inhalation anesthesia. In each hindlimb (at the level of femur), a small incision was made, and the sciatic nerve was isolated. In the left leg, the sciatic nerve was severed and a 5-mm section of nerve was removed. The ends of the nerve were folded back and closed with reabsorbable sutures to prevent nerve regrowth. The skin incisions were closed with wound clips. The contralateral limb served as the intra-animal control. All of the experiments were performed in muscle isolated 7 days post-denervation. The gastrocnemius, soleus, and tibialis (the muscles innervated by the sciatic nerve) were collected and used for analysis (12Muller F.L. Song W. Jang Y.C. Liu Y. Sabia M. Richardson A. Van Remmen H. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: R1159-R1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Chemicals—All of the chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless specified otherwise. Isolation of Skeletal Muscle Mitochondria—Mitochondria were purified from lower hind limb skeletal muscle according to Chappell and Perry, as described previously (19Mansouri A. Muller F.L. Liu Y. Ng R. Faulkner J. Hamilton M. Richardson A. Huang T.T. Epstein C.J. Van Remmen H. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2006; 127: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Briefly, hind limb skeletal muscle was excised, weighed, bathed in 150 mm KCl, and placed in Chappell-Perry buffer with the protease nagarse. The minced skeletal muscle was homogenized, and the homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 600 × g; supernatant was passed through cheesecloth and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The mitochondrial pellet was washed in modified Chappell-Perry buffer with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was further washed twice in modified Chappell-Perry buffer without bovine serum albumin centrifuging each time at 3,500 × g for 10 min. Isolated mitochondria were used immediately. Protein concentration was measured with the Bradford method. Mitochondrial H2O2 Release—Mitochondrial H2O2 production was measured by the Amplex Red-horseradish peroxidase method (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Horseradish peroxidase (2 units/ml) catalyzes the H2O2-dependent oxidation of nonfluorescent Amplex Red (80 μm) to fluorescent resorufin red (20Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was followed at an excitation wavelength of 545 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm using a Fluoroskan Ascent type 374 multi-well plate reader (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). The slope of the increase in fluorescence is converted to the rate of H2O2 production with a standard curve (21Starkov A.A. Fiskum G. Chinopoulos C. Lorenzo B.J. Browne S.E. Patel M.S. Beal M.F. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7779-7788Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). All of the assays were performed at 37 °C, in black 96-well plates in the presence or absence of respiratory substrates and inhibitors. The reaction buffer consisted of 125 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.44. For the H2O2 and hydroperoxide inhibition experiments, catalase (∼4 units) and ebselen (10 μm), respectively, were added to the reaction mix prior to the addition of substrates/inhibitors. Measurements of Superoxide Production—We measured superoxide production by three methods: EPR, the chemiluminescent probe MCLA (2-methyl-6-(p-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroimidazo[1,2-α]-pyrazin-3-one), and mitochondrial aconitase activity. EPR—Extramitochondrial superoxide release was measured by EPR using the spin trap, 5-diisopropoxyphosphoryl)-5-methyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DIPPMPO, Alexis Biochemicals). DIPPMPO forms an adduct with superoxide, resulting in the generation of DIPPMPO-OOH, which decays to the DIPPMPO-OH adduct by the action of glutathione peroxidases (22Frejaville C. Karoui H. Tuccio B. Le Moigne F. Culcasi M. Pietri S. Lauricella R. Tordo P. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). EPR measurements were performed using an X-band MS200 spectrometer (Magnetech, Berlin). Mitochondria (1 mg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C with/without G/M and DIPPMPO (50 mm) for 30 min in 125 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS, 2 mm diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.44. Although it did not affect the DIPPMPO-OH signal, low levels of catalase (10 units/ml) were also added, because it prevented the appearance of small additional and unidentified spectrum peaks after extended incubation. For measurements, 40 μl of sample was transferred to 50-μl capillary tubes and measured at room temperature with the following settings: receiver gain, 5 × 105; microwave power, 20 milliwatt; microwave frequency, 9.55 GHz; modulation amplitude, 2G; scan time, 40 s; and scan width, 100 G, with an accumulation of 10 scans. MCLA—The second method of superoxide measurement utilized the probe MCLA (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). MCLA reversibly reacts with superoxide, forming an adduct whose irreversible decay generates light (∼465 nm) (23Nakano M. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The apparent rate constant of this reaction is ∼105 m–1 s–1. Light emission was detected and quantified using a Fluoroskan-FL Ascent type 374 microplate luminometer (Labsystems) with opaque (white) 96-well plates. The photomultiplier was set to default with an integration time of 1000 ms. The MCLA signal was quantified as an integral of 20 s of continuous measurement and expressed as relative luminescence units/mg of mitochondrial protein. The reaction was conducted in 100 μl of reaction buffer containing ∼0.5 mg/ml mitochondrial protein. The reaction buffer contained 125 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm K2HPO4, and 5 μm MCLA. Xanthine/xanthine oxidase system was used as a positive control. Aconitase Activity—Production of superoxide was also measured indirectly by the assay of aconitase activity. Aconitase catalyzes the reversible isomerization of citrate to isocitrate. In most tissues, aconitase is usually present in both the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm. However, in skeletal muscle, only mitochondrial matrix aconitase is present. Aconitase activity was assayed (in Triton-X-100-treated samples) by measuring NADP+ reduction by citrate in the presence of isocitrate dehydrogenase using a fluorometric method (excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm). Skeletal muscle homogenates (∼1.0 mg of protein/ml) were aliquoted in 96-well plates (100 μl of pH 7.44, 125 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm K2HPO4) and incubated at 30 °C up to 40 min. Incubation was stopped, and aconitase activity measurements were begun by the addition of 1 volume (100 μl) of 50 mm Tris, 0.6 mm MnCl2, 60 mm citrate, 0.2% Triton X-100, 100 μm NADP+, and 1 unit of isocitrate dehydrogenase (Sigma). Fluorometric measurements were then started immediately (Fluoroskan-FL Ascent type 374 microplate reader). The “blank” to measure aconitase-independent NADP+ reduction consisted of the same buffer minus the isocitrate dehydrogenase. The slope of the increase in NADPH fluorescence was taken as the amount of aconitase activity. Effect of Inhibitors on ROS Production—For the cPLA2 and calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) inhibitor studies, 20 μm arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) or bromoenol lactone were added to the 600 × g muscle homogenate during the mitochondrial isolation process. Effect of Hydroperoxides on Amplex Red Signal—Fatty acid hydroperoxide, 15(S)-hydroperoxy-(E,Z,Z,Z)-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (15HpETE), tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) or H2O2 (0–2500 pmol) were incubated with Amplex Red in the absence of mitochondria and substrates/inhibitors, and end point measurements were made. Western Blot—Skeletal muscle homogenates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer with 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate and 1× protease inhibitor). Equivalent amounts of protein (120 μg) for each sample were resolved in 4–20% Tris-HCl SDS-PAGE gels in triplicate. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were incubated in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) containing 10% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were reacted with mouse cPLA2 (1:100) and actin (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) antibodies at 4 °C overnight. After washing with TBS-T, they were incubated with either goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase or goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (1:1000; Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were washed four or five times with TBS-T, and the bands were visualized using chemiluminescent detection reagents from Amersham Biosciences. Measurement of Hydroperoxides by Xylenol-Orange Reagent—Hydroperoxides were measured using the xylenol orange oxidation protocol detailed by Hermes-Lima et al. (24Hermes-Lima M. Willmore W.G. Storey K.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In an acidic environment, Fe2+ oxidizes to Fe3+ with reduction of hydroperoxides. Fe3+ reacts with xylenol orange forming a purple complex absorbance, which is recorded at 580 nm. In brief, 250 μl of FeSO4 (1 mm), 100 μl of 0.25 m H2SO4, 200 μl of xylenol orange (1 mm), and 400 μl of distilled H2O were pipetted in that sequence into a cuvette. The reaction was commenced with the addition of 50 μl of mitochondrial supernatant. After 3 h of incubation, the absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 580 nm. A standard curve was prepared with t-BHP to quantify the amount of hydroperoxides released. Catalase Only Partially Inhibits the Amplex Red Signal—We performed a series of experiments to determine the nature of radical species released by muscle mitochondria following denervation. We previously reported that 7 days post-denervation, State 1 ROS production measured by Amplex Red is 20–30-fold higher in mitochondria isolated from denervated muscle compared with mitochondria isolated from the contralateral intact muscle (19Mansouri A. Muller F.L. Liu Y. Ng R. Faulkner J. Hamilton M. Richardson A. Huang T.T. Epstein C.J. Van Remmen H. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2006; 127: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We measured mitochondrial ROS production in the presence/absence of catalase to determine whether the signal in response to Amplex Red can be attributed entirely to H2O2 or something in addition to H2O2. As shown in Fig. 1, catalase inhibited the Amplex Red signal ∼65, ∼71, and ∼75% in control mitochondria when respiring in the absence of respiratory substrates (State 1), and the presence of glutamate/malate and succinate/rotenone. Catalase inhibited the Amplex Red signal in mitochondria isolated from denervated muscle by ∼20% (State 1), by ∼33% (glutamate/malate), and by ∼48% in mitochondria respiring on succinate/rotenone. In contrast, catalase inhibited the Amplex Red signal by ∼75–80% in the presence of respiratory inhibitors, antimycin A, and rotenone, conditions that dramatically increase the production of superoxide and H2O2 by the mitochondrial electron transport chain. These results suggested that H2O2 only marginally contributes to the Amplex Red signal, post-denervation surgery. No Difference in Superoxide Production between Mitochondria Isolated from Control and Denervated Muscle—In our assay system, the Amplex Red signal represents both H2O2 and superoxide anion. In the absence of a superoxide trapping agent, either exogenous SOD or spontaneous dismutation readily converts all of the superoxide that is released from the mitochondria to H2O2 to be detected by the Amplex Red probe. To determine the relative contribution of superoxide generation to the ROS produced in response to denervation, we measured superoxide radical production in mitochondria from control and denervated muscle by three independent methods. First, we measured superoxide release from mitochondria directly using EPR spectroscopy. EPR is the only technique that can directly detect superoxide radical, but because it occurs in such low abundance, it is only detectable using spin traps. We used the spin trap, DIPPMPO to measure extramitochondrial superoxide release in absence/presence of respiratory substrate in muscle mitochondria. As shown in Fig. 2A, superoxide signal was detectable under State 1 conditions and increased considerably in the presence of complex I-linked substrate, glutamate/malate. However, as Fig. 2B indicates, there was no difference between the superoxide signal in mitochondria isolated from the control and denervated muscle. The addition of exogenous SOD completely removed the superoxide signal (data not shown). We also used aconitase activity inhibition assay as an indirect measure of superoxide released into the mitochondrial matrix in homogenates from control and denervated muscle (Fig. 2C). Our assay did not show any difference in aconitase activity between homogenates from control and denervated muscle. The data suggests that superoxide production by the electron transport chain may not be the primary source of the signal detected by Amplex Red in mitochondria isolated from denervated muscle. To further assess the species of ROS released post-denervation, we used MCLA, a chemiluminescent probe that is highly selective for superoxide and is widely used for its detection in mitochondria (25Muller F.L. Liu Y. Van Remmen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49064-49073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Fig. 2D shows superoxide production under State 1 conditions and in the presence of respiratory substrate glutamate/malate. The assay was unable to detect superoxide in mitochondria from denervated muscle in the absence of respiratory substrates, but a significant increase in the MCLA signal was observed with glutamate/malate. However, there was no difference in the MCLA signal between mitochondria isolated from control and denervated muscle. The results from these three independent measurements indicated that electron transport chaingenerated superoxide does not contribute to the increase in Amplex Red signal measured in mitochondria from denervated muscle. Amplex Red Reacts with Other Hydroperoxides in Addition to H2O2— Our results using the Amplex Red probe in the presence/absence of catalase and the assays of superoxide production suggested the release of species other than H2O2 and/or superoxide from mitochondria isolated from denervated muscle. This led us to consider the possibility that the Amplex Red probe may not be specific for H2O2. To determine whether the –OOH moiety in other molecules may react with Amplex Red, we performed the Amplex Red assay with H2O2 and other molecules that have –OOH in their structure, hydroperoxides, t-BHP, and 15HpETE. We performed the assays in the absence of mitochondria to measure the specificity of the Amplex Red probe in vitro. As we anticipated, H2O2 gives a strong signal with the Amplex Red probe (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, 15HpETE and t-BHP also reacted with the Amplex Red probe, albeit with dose-response intensities lower than that with H2O2 (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that Amplex Red can also react with organic hydroperoxides/fatty acid hydroperoxides in addition to H2O2. Ebselen Inhibits the Amplex Red Signal in Mitochondria from Denervated Muscle—Ebselen is a synthetic seleno-organic compound that has been widely studied for its antioxidant properties. Ebselen is capable of scavenging H2O2 and hydroperoxides, in particular, membrane-bound phospholipid and cholesterylester hydroperoxides (26Maiorino M. Roveri A. Coassin M. Ursini F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 27Sies H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed the Amplex Red assay in the presence of ebselen in mitochondria from denervated muscle and compared it with the effect of catalase. Although ebselen decreased State 1 Amplex Red signal by ∼70–75% in mitochondria from denervated muscle (Fig. 4A), catalase only decreased it by ∼22–25%. These data further support the idea that mitochondria from denervated muscle may release fatty acid hydroperoxides in addition to H2O2. Increased Release of Hydroperoxides from Mitochondria Isolated from Denervated Muscle—To confirm the release of fatty acid hydroperoxides by mitochondria isolated from denervated muscle, we utilized the xylenol-orange oxidation method. Because xylenol-orange can also react with H2O2 (but with much less reactivity than other hydroperoxides), we performed the assay in the presence/absence of catalase. In the absence of catalase, mitochondria from denervated muscle released ∼66% more hydroperoxides compared with control mitochondria (Fig. 4B). The presence of catalase minimally decreased the hydroperoxide signal (∼ 6%), suggesting that fatty acid hydroperoxides are the main radical species released from muscle mitochondria in response to denervation. AACOCF3 Decreases the Amplex Red Signal in Mitochondria from Denervated Muscle—We next asked whether the Amplex Red signal in mitochondria from denervated muscle might be a consequence of activated PLA2 causing the release of fatty acid hydroperoxides. To address this possibility, we tested the effect of AACOCF3, a highly selective cPLA2 inhibitor, and bromoenol lactone, a iPLA2 inhibitor on the Amplex Red signal in mitochondria isolated from denervated muscle. PLA2 catalyzes the first step in the inflammatory pathway leading to production of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes. The addition of AACOCF3 in the homogenate decreased the Amplex Red signal in mitochondria from denervated muscle to control values in the absence of substrates and when respiring with glutamate/malate and succinate/rotenone. However, in the presence of complex I and III inhibitors rotenone and antimycin A, where there is a dramatic increase in superoxide/H2O2 generation, AACOCF3 only marginally decreased the Amplex Red signal. Thus, the effect of AACOCF3 is specific in that it does not inhibit mitochondrial H2O2 production (Fig. 5A). Bromoenol lactone had no effect on the Amplex Red signal (data not shown). These results indicate that cPLA2 is a key mediator of the high State 1 Amplex Red signal that occurs in response to denervation, most likely by preventing the release of fatty acid hydroperoxides from lipid hydroperoxides in the bilayer. We also tested the effect of AACOCF3 in additional mouse models of muscle atrophy associated with the loss of innervation, namely, Sod1–/– and G93A ALS mutant mice (28Thomas C.K. Zijdewind I. Muscle Nerve. 2006; 33: 21-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Flood D.G. Reaume A.G. Gruner J.A. Hoffman E.K. Hirsch J.D. Lin Y.G. Dorfman K.S. Scott R.W. Am. J.

We previously reported that mitochondrial ROS production is significantly elevated in these mice (12Muller F.L. Song W. Jang Y.C. Liu Y. Sabia M. Richardson A. Van Remmen H. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: R1159-R1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B, the addition of AACOCF3 to the muscle homogenate decreased mitochondrial State 1 Amplex Red signal to control levels in Sod1–/– mice, and we found a similar effect in mitochondria isolated from G93A mice (data not shown). These data suggest that the elevation of cPLA2 is potentially a common phenomenon in mice that"
https://openalex.org/W2050423538,"The thioether 3,3-thiodipropionic acid can be used as precursor substrate for biotechnological synthesis of 3-mercaptopropionic acid-containing polythioesters. Therefore, the hitherto unknown catabolism of this compound was elucidated to engineer novel and improved polythioester biosynthesis pathways in the future. Bacteria capable of using 3,3-thiodipropionic acid as the sole source of carbon and energy for growth were enriched from the environment. From eleven isolates, TBEA3, TBEA6, and SFWT were morphologically and physiologically characterized. Their 16 S rDNAs and other features affiliated these isolates to the β-subgroup of the proteobacteria. Tn5::mob mutagenesis of isolate Variovorax paradoxus TBEA6 yielded ten mutants fully or partially impaired in growth on 3,3-thiodipropionic acid. Genotypic characterization of two 3,3-thiodipropionic acid-negative mutants demonstrated the involvement of a bacterial cysteine dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.22) homologue in the further catabolism of the 3,3-thiodipropionic acid cleavage product 3-mercaptopropionic acid. Detection of 3-sulfinopropionate in the supernatant of one of these mutants during cultivation on 3,3-thiodipropionic acid as well as in vivo and in vitro enzyme assays using purified protein demonstrated oxygenation of 3-mercaptopropionic acid to 3-sulfinopropionate by this enzyme; cysteine and cysteamine were not used as substrate. Beside cysteine dioxygenase and cysteamine dioxygenase, this 3-mercaptopropionic acid dioxygenase is the third example for a thiol dioxygenase and the first report about the microbial catabolism of 3-mercaptopropionic acid. Insertion of Tn5::mob in a gene putatively coding for a family III acyl-CoA-transferase resulted in the accumulation of 3-sulfinopropionate during cultivation on 3,3-thiodipropionic acid, indicating that this compound is further metabolized to 3-sulfinopropionyl-CoA and subsequently to propionyl-CoA. The thioether 3,3-thiodipropionic acid can be used as precursor substrate for biotechnological synthesis of 3-mercaptopropionic acid-containing polythioesters. Therefore, the hitherto unknown catabolism of this compound was elucidated to engineer novel and improved polythioester biosynthesis pathways in the future. Bacteria capable of using 3,3-thiodipropionic acid as the sole source of carbon and energy for growth were enriched from the environment. From eleven isolates, TBEA3, TBEA6, and SFWT were morphologically and physiologically characterized. Their 16 S rDNAs and other features affiliated these isolates to the β-subgroup of the proteobacteria. Tn5::mob mutagenesis of isolate Variovorax paradoxus TBEA6 yielded ten mutants fully or partially impaired in growth on 3,3-thiodipropionic acid. Genotypic characterization of two 3,3-thiodipropionic acid-negative mutants demonstrated the involvement of a bacterial cysteine dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.22) homologue in the further catabolism of the 3,3-thiodipropionic acid cleavage product 3-mercaptopropionic acid. Detection of 3-sulfinopropionate in the supernatant of one of these mutants during cultivation on 3,3-thiodipropionic acid as well as in vivo and in vitro enzyme assays using purified protein demonstrated oxygenation of 3-mercaptopropionic acid to 3-sulfinopropionate by this enzyme; cysteine and cysteamine were not used as substrate.

The thioether 3,3-thiodipropionic acid (TDP) 2The abbreviations used are: TDP, thioether 3,3-thiodipropionic acid; PTE, polythioester; DTDP, 3,3-dithiodipropionic acid; Cdo, cysteine dioxygenase; MSM, mineral salts medium; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; GC/MS, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; RT, reverse transcription; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ORF, open reading frame; Ssi, sulfate starvation-induced; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; X-Gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; 3SP, 3-sulfinopropionic acid; 3MP, 3-mercaptopropionic acid; Rt, retention time. and its ester are effective non-toxic antioxidants (1Scott G. Chem. Commun. 1968; 24: 1572-1574Google Scholar), and they are therefore widely used as antioxidant and stabilizer in food, for food packaging, and for various technical applications. Experiment with rats showed that TDP was rapidly adsorbed after oral intake and excreted in the urine (2Reynolds R.C. Astill B.D. Fassett W. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1974; 28: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In technical applications esters of TDP are important stabilizers of polyolefins (1Scott G. Chem. Commun. 1968; 24: 1572-1574Google Scholar), and polymer-bound TDP is used to replace methyl sulfide for the reductive quenching of ozonolysis reactions (3Appel R.B. Tomlinson I.A. Hill I. Synth. Commun. 1995; 25: 3589-3595Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recently, the biotechnological production of medium- and long-chain dialkyl 3,3-thiodipropionate antioxidants by a lipase-catalyzed esterification of 3,3-thiodipropionic acid in the absence of solvents was reported. In contrast to the chemical production of TDP ester, the biotechnological process does not require any materials with deleterious effects on health and environment (4Weber N. Klein E. Vosmann K. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2006; 54: 2957-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Another biotechnological process using TDP as primary product is the microbial production of polythioesters (PTEs) (5Lu¨tke-Eversloh T. Bergander K. Luftmann H. Steinbu¨chel A. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition to 3-mercaptopropionic acid Ralstonia eutropha is able to use the organo sulfur compounds TDP and 3,3-dithiodipropionic acid (DTDP) as precursor substrates for production of copolymers of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 3MP (6Lu¨tke-Eversloh T. Steinbu¨chel A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 221: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast to 3MP the application of TDP and DTDP has numerous advantages, because they have a lower toxicity and they are odorless, inexpensive, and available on a large scale. Until today the use of TDP and DTDP as precursor substrates are limited to R. eutropha, and biotechnological production of PTE using the recombinant Escherichia coli strain JM109 pBPP1 (7Liu S.-J. Steinbu¨chel A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) is only possible when 3MP is added to the media. Because 3MP is incorporated into the polymer if TDP or DTDP is supplied as precursor substrate, it is assumed that these compounds are enzymatically cleaved into 3MP and 3-hydroxypropionate, or two molecules 3MP, respectively (6Lu¨tke-Eversloh T. Steinbu¨chel A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 221: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The corresponding TDP- and/or DTDP-cleaving enzymes as well as the microbial catabolism of the intermediate 3MP are still unknown. The identification of such enzymes could help to engineer the recombinant E. coli JM109 pBPP1 toward TDP- and DTDP-based PTE production. Therefore, the corresponding genes could be used to improve the already established BPEC pathway by heterologous expression (7Liu S.-J. Steinbu¨chel A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For 3MP it is known that it occurs naturally as an intermediate during microbial degradation of the osmoprotectant dimethylsulfoniopropionate and during the biotransformation of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and homocysteine in anoxic coastal sediments (8Kiene R.P. Taylor B.F. Nature. 1988; 332: 148-150Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Kiene R.P. Taylor B.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 2208-2212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yoch D.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 5804-5815Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 11Kiene R.P. Malloy K.D. Taylor B.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 156-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge no reports on the pathways or enzymes for further metabolism of 3MP in bacteria have been published. In contrast, the catabolism of cysteine, the structural analogue of 3MP, is well known in bacteria (12McFall E. Newman E.B. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology.in: ASM Press, Washington, DC1996: 358-374Google Scholar, 13Mihara H. Esaki N. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In addition to the well investigated cysteine degradation pathways, a novel pathway was recently reported in eubacteria by Dominy et al. (14Dominy Jr., J.E. Simmons C.R. Karplus P.A. Gehring A.M. Stipanuk M.H. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5561-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which involves a cysteine dioxygenase (Cdo, EC 1.13.11.20). This Fe2+-dependent enzyme catalyzes the irreversible oxidation of the sulfhydryl group of cysteine to cysteine sulfinic acid. Cdos are well known in eukaryotes and play an important role by reducing the cysteine pool and increasing the levels of important metabolites such as taurine and sulfates (15Chai S.C. Jerkins A.A. Banik J.J. Shalev I. Pinkham J.L. Uden P.C. Maroney M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 9865-9869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The physiological function of this enzyme is not completely understood in bacteria. In addition to the important role in regulating the steady-state cysteine levels, also an important role of this enzyme during changes of bacterial life cycles was suggested (14Dominy Jr., J.E. Simmons C.R. Karplus P.A. Gehring A.M. Stipanuk M.H. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5561-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), because many of the bacteria possessing a Cdo undergo a complex life cycle involving morphological changes. For example, in cells of Bacillus subtilis expression of the cdo gene is up-regulated during transition from the vegetative state to sporulation (14Dominy Jr., J.E. Simmons C.R. Karplus P.A. Gehring A.M. Stipanuk M.H. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5561-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To our knowledge there are so far also no reports about bacteria that utilize the organic thioether TDP as sole source of carbon and energy. Only its use as a sulfur source was described for Mycobacterium goodii X7B (16Li F. Xu P. Feng J. Meng L. Zheng Y. Luo L. Ma C. Appl. Environ. Mirobiol. 2005; 71: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, this bacterium could not grow with TDP in the absence of an additional carbon source, and degradation products of TDP were also not reported. To engineer the PTE biosynthesis in the future toward to use TDP as precursor substrates, we investigated the catabolism of TDP. The isolation and characterization of bacteria capable of using TDP as the sole source of carbon and energy are described in this study. In addition, Tn5::mob mutagenesis was carried out with one of these new isolates, Variovorax paradoxus strain TBEA6, to identify genes possibly involved in TDP catabolism. Isolation of Strains Capable of Using TDP as Sole Source of Carbon and Energy—Samples from different soils, activated sludge, and freshwater tank sediment were incubated in mineral salts medium (MSM) containing 3 g/liter TDP as the sole source of carbon and energy at 30 °C for 3-5 days (17Schlegel H. Kaltwasser G.H. Gottschalk G. Arch. Mikrobiol. 1961; 38: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Aliquots of these cultures were then plated on the same medium solidified with 1.5% (w/v) agar, single colonies were isolated, and the best growing colonies were chosen for further studies. Bacterial Strains and Cultivation Conditions—All bacterial strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. R. eutropha H16, strains of Variovorax paradoxus and isolate TBEA3 were cultivated at 30 °C in nutrient broth or MSM supplemented with 0.1 g/liter yeast extract under aerobic conditions on a rotary shaker at an agitation of 130 rpm. Strains of E. coli were cultivated in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium or M9 medium supplemented with yeast extract (0.1 g/liter) at 37 °C under the same conditions (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.in: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). Carbon sources were supplied as filter-sterilized stock solutions as indicated in the text. For maintenance of plasmids, antibiotics were prepared according to Sambrook et al. (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.in: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar) and added to the media at the following concentrations (μg/ml): ampicillin (75), kanamycin (50), chloramphenicol (34), and tetracycline (12.5). In E. coli heterologous expression of genes under the control of a lac-promotor was induced by addition of 1 mm IPTG to LB medium. Chemicals—Bulk TDP was provided by Bruno Bock Chemische Fabrik GmbH & Co. KG. Organic thiochemicals of high purity grade were purchased from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium) or Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany) (Fig. 1). 3-Sulfinopropionate was synthesized according to Jollás-Bergáret (19Jolles-Bergeret B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 42: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); the procedure was modified by one repetition of the alkaline cleavage of the intermediate bis-(2-carboxyethyl)sulfone. Starting from 111 g of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate (purity, >98%) plus 108 ml of acrylic acid (99.5%), 119 g of the intermediate bis-(2-carboxyethyl)sulfone were chemically synthesized. After alkaline scission, precipitation, and washing procedures, 99 g of the disodium salt of 3SP, with a purity of ∼90%, were finally obtained. Synthesis and purity of the substance was confirmed by HPLC and GC/MS. Strain Identification—API 20NE identification test (bio-Márieux, Marcy-l’Etoile, France) and Bactident oxidase test stripes (Merck KgA, Darmstadt, Germany) were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Presence of catalase was tested using 3% (v/v) H2O2. The 16 S rRNA gene was amplified from total genomic DNA by PCR using Primers 27f and 1525r (20Devereux R. Willis S.G. Molecular Microbial Ecology Manual.in: Kluwer, The Netherlands1995: 509-522Google Scholar). The PCR product was purified using the NucleoTrap kit (Machery and Nagel, Du¨ren, Germany) and applied as template for sequencing in which the following primers were utilized: 27f, 357f, 803f, 907r, 1114f, 1385r, and 1525r (20Devereux R. Willis S.G. Molecular Microbial Ecology Manual.in: Kluwer, The Netherlands1995: 509-522Google Scholar). The assembled sequence was compared with the GenBank™ data base and the Ribosomal Database Project using the Blast and SIMILARITY-RANK (Ribosomal Database Project) algorithms (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Scha¨ffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60220) Google Scholar, 22Maidak B.L. Olsen G.J. Larsen N. Overbeek R. McCaughey M.J. Woese C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). A phylogenetic tree was constructed using ClustalX (23Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35619) Google Scholar). Transposon Mutagenesis and Characterization of Tn5::mob-induced Mutants—Insertional mutagenesis of V. paradoxus strain TBEA6 with transposon Tn5::mob was performed as described previously by using the suicide plasmid pSUP5011, which was delivered from E. coli S17-1 to the recipient by conjugation during spot agar mating (24Simon R. Priefer U. Pu¨hler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-791Crossref Scopus (5658) Google Scholar, 25Friedrich B. Hogrefe C. Schlegel H.G. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 198-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transconjugants were selected on MSM plates containing 0.5% (w/v) gluconate plus kanamycin. Transconjugants impaired in growth on TDP were then identified by plating on MSM agar plates containing 0.3% (w/v) TDP plus kanamycin or 0.5% (w/v) gluconate plus kanamycin. For genotypic characterization of the Tn5::mob-induced mutants, genomic DNA was isolated (26Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 208-218Crossref Scopus (9014) Google Scholar) and digested with SalI or BamHI. The genomic DNA fragments were then ligated to pBluescriptSK- DNA, which was linearized with the same restriction endonuclease; the ligation products were then transformed into CaCl2-competent E. coli Top10 cells. Transformants were selected on LB medium containing ampicillin plus kanamycin, and hybrid plasmids were subsequently isolated and sequenced using the primers M13 forward, M13 reverse, and IS50L (supplemental Table S3). Analysis of Cell-free Supernatants and Sulfur Organic Compounds by HPLC—Concentrations of TDP, 3MP, cysteine sulfinic acid, cysteamine, hypotaurine, and 3SP were analyzed by HPLC. HPLC analysis of TDP, 3MP, cysteamine, and 3SP was carried out in a LaChrom Elite® HPLC apparatus (VWR-Hitachi International GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) consisting of a Metacarb 67H advanced C column (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, Bio-Rad Aminex equivalent) and a 22350 VWR-Hitachi column oven. The primary separation mechanism includes ligand exchange, ion exclusion, and adsorption. A VWR-Hitachi refractive index detector (Type 2490) with an active flow cell temperature control and automated reference flushing eliminating temperature effects on the refractive index baseline was used for detection. Aliquots of 20 μl of cell-free supernatants, solutions of organic sulfur compounds or enzyme assay were injected and eluted with 0.005 n sulfuric acid (H2SO4) in double distilled water at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Online integration and analysis was done with EZ Chrome Elite Software (VWR International GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). Cysteamine was detected under the same conditions using double distilled water as mobile phase. Detection of hypotaurine and cysteine sulfinic acid was carried out in a Kontron Instrument (Neufahrn, Germany). After derivatization with OPA reagent (27Aboulmagd E. Oppermann-Sanio F.B. Steinbu¨chel A. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) using a Smartline Autosampler 3900 (Knauer Advanced Scientific Instruments, Berlin, Germany), 20 μl of the reaction was injected onto a Novapack C18 reversed-phase column (Knauer) and monitored fluorometrically at 330/450 nm (excitation/emission) by using a model 1046A fluorescence detector (Hewlett Packard). Substances were identified by comparison of their retention times to those of standard organic acids. The detection limit for hypotaurine is ∼20 μm and 10 μm for cysteine sulfinic acid. Quantitative Analysis of Polyhydroxyalkanoic Acid and Their Compositions by GC—Lyophilized cell material was subjected to methanolysis in the presence of methanol and sulfuric acid (MeOH: 85%, v/v; H2SO4: 15%, v/v) for 4 h at 100 °C, and the resulting methylesters of the polyhydroxyalkanoic acid constituents were characterized by gas chromatography using an Agilent 6850 GC (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with a BP21 capillary column (50 m by 0.22 mm; film thickness, 250 nm; SGE, Darmstadt, Germany) and a flame ionization detector (Agilent Technologies). A 2-μl portion of the organic phase was analyzed after split injection (split ratio, 1:5); a constant hydrogen flow of 0.6 ml/min was used as carrier gas. The temperatures of the injector and detector were 250 °C and 220 °C, respectively. The following temperature program was applied: 120 °C for 5 min, increase of 3 °C/min to 180 °C, and increase of 10 °C/min to 220 °C and 220 °C for 31 min. Substances were identified by comparison of their retention times to those of standard fatty acid methyl ester. Analysis of 3SP Production by GC/MS—Lyophilized cells, cell-free supernatants, or aliquots of synthesized 3SP were subjected to methanolysis as described above, and the resulting methylesters of the organic acids were characterized by coupled GC/MS using an HP6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a model 5973 EI MSD mass-selective detector (Hewlett Packard). A2-μl portion of the organic phase was analyzed after splitless injection employing a BP21 capillary column (50 m by 0.22 mm; film thickness, 250 nm; SGE). Helium (0.6 ml/min) was used as carrier gas. The temperatures of the injector and detector were 250 °C and 240 °C, respectively. The same temperature program as described for GC analysis was applied. Data were evaluated using the NIST Mass Spectral Search program. 3S. Stein, A. Levitsky, O. Fateev, and G. Mallard (1998). The NIST Mass Spectral Search Program, Windows-Software Version 1.6d. Isolation of RNA and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from V. paradoxus strain TBEA6 by using the Qiagen RNeasy-Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR was performed using the Qiagen “One step RT-PCR” Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To recognize PCR products based on DNA contaminations in isolated RNA, a control with addition of RNA after the reverse transcription step was done. DNA Isolation and Manipulation—Chromosomal DNA of strains of V. paradoxus and R. eutropha H16 was isolated according to Marmur (26Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 208-218Crossref Scopus (9014) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated from E. coli and V. paradoxus strains using the GeneJET™ plasmid miniprep kit from Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s manual. DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases under conditions described by the manufacturer or according to Sambrook et al. (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.in: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). PCR were carried out in an Omnigene HBTR3CM DNA thermal cycler (Hybaid, Heidelberg, Germany) using Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR products were isolated from an agarose gel and purified using the NucleoTrap kit (Machery and Nagel, Du¨ren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. T4-DNA-Ligase was purchased from Invitrogen. Primers were synthesized by MWG-Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany). Transfer of DNA—Competent cells of E. coli strains were prepared and transformed by the CaCl2 procedure (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.in: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). DNA Sequencing and Sequence Data Analysis—DNA sequencing was done in a Li-Cor 4000L automatic sequencing apparatus (Li-COR Inv., Biotechnology Division, NE, USA) using the Thermo long read cycle sequencing Kit (Epicenter Technologies, WI, USA) and IRD 800-labeled oligonucleotides (MWG-Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). BlastX was used for determination of nucleotide identity (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Scha¨ffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60220) Google Scholar). DNA-DNA Hybridization—Southern hybridization was carried out by the method described by Oelmu¨ller et al. (29Oelmu¨ller U. Kru¨ger N. Steinbu¨chel A. Friedrich C.G. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1990; 11: 73-84Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar) at a temperature of 68 °C. Genome Walking—For sequencing of flanking genomic regions of known sequences a PCR-based directional genome walking method (30Mishra R.N. Singla-Pareek S.J. Nair S. Sopory S.K. Reddy M.K. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 830-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was performed. Cloning of cdoVp, cdoARe, and cdoBRe—The cdoVp, cdoARe, and cdoBRe genes were amplified from total genomic DNA of V. paradoxus strain TBEA6 or R. eutropha strain H16 by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and the following oligonucleotides: cdo(NdeI), cdo(XhoI), cdoA(XbaI), cdoA(XhoI), cdoB(ApaI), and cdoB(HindIII) (supplemental Table S3). PCR products were isolated from agarose gels using the NucleoTrap kit (Machery and Nagel) and ligated with pGEMTeasy® DNA (Promega, Madison, WI). Ligation products were transformed into CaCl2-competent cells, and transformants were selected on LB agar plates containing IPTG, X-Gal, plus ampicillin. For heterologous expression in the T7 promoter/polymerase-based expression vector pET23a (Novagen, Madison, WI), cdoVp was obtained by digestion of hybrid plasmid pGEMTeasy®::cdoVp with restriction endonucleases NdeI and XhoI and purified from an agarose gel using the NucleoTrap kit (Machery and Nagel). After ligation into expression vector pET23a, which was linearized with the same restriction endonucleases, the ligation product was used for transformation of CaCl2-competent cells of E. coli Top10. After selection of transformants using LB media containing ampicillin, the hybrid plasmids were isolated, analyzed by sequencing, and transformed to CaCl2-competent cells of E. coli (DE3) strains BL21 pLysS and Rosetta pLysS (Novagen, Madison, WI). For complementation studies and heterologous expression in the broad host vector pBBR1MCS-3 (31Kovach M.E. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 175-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar), cdoVp, cdoARe, and cdoBRe were obtained from pGEMTeasy® vector, which were digested with the respective restriction endonuclease and purified from an agarose gel using the NucleoTrap kit (Machery and Nagel). The purified genes were subsequently ligated into pBBR1MCS-3, which was linearized with the same restriction endonucleases, and the ligation products were transformed to CaCl2-competent cells of E. coli S17-1 and E. coli Top10. Transformants were selected on LB medium containing tetracycline, IPTG, plus X-Gal. The hybrid plasmids pBBR1MCS-3::cdoVp, pBBR1MCS-3::cdoARe, and pBBR1MCS-3::cdoBRe were then conjugated into the transposon-induced mutants 2/5 and 13/33 from E. coli S17-1. Preparation of Crude Extracts—Cells from 50- to 500-ml cultures were harvested by centrifugation (20 min, 4 °C, and 2,800 × g), washed twice, and resuspended in 50 mm NaPO4 buffer (pH 7.6). Cells were disrupted by sonification in a Sonopuls GM200 apparatus (Bandelin, Berlin, Germany) with an amplitude of 16 μm (1 min/ml) while cooling in an NaCl/ice bath. Soluble protein fractions of crude extracts were obtained in the supernatants after 1-h centrifugation at 100,000 × g and 4 °C and were used for enzyme purifications. Immobilized Metal Chelate Affinity Chromatography—To obtain purified hexahistidine-tagged fusion CdoVp, His Spin Trap affinity columns (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) were used according to the instructions of the manufacturer with minor modifications. Tris-HCl (0.1 m, pH 7.6) was used as buffer component instead of sodium phosphate, and for the washing step a buffer containing 40 mm imidazole was applied. The washing step was repeated three times, and the elution step was repeated two times. Enzyme Assay—Standard in vitro activity of cysteine dioxygenase was assayed by incubating 3 μg of purified CdoVp for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of the following components: 10 mm cysteine, 10 mm cysteamine, or 5 mm 3MP, 400 μm (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 × 6H2O, 12.5 μm bathocuproine disulfonate and MES buffer (62 mm, pH 6.3). The reaction was stopped by 10-min incubation at 95 °C. Negative controls were done with denatured protein. The reaction products 3SP, hypotaurine, and cysteine sulfinic acid were analyzed by HPLC. For in vivo testing of recombinant cysteine dioxygenase activity in recombinant E. coli strains, cells were cultivated in M9 medium containing 1% (v/v) glycerol at 30 °C. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced by addition of 1 mm IPTG after 6 h of cultivation. Subsequently, the substrate 3MP was added to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v), and the cells were grown for additional 24 h before they were harvested and washed twice with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl. Finally, the cell pellets were lyophilized. Analysis of the reaction product 3SP was done by GC/MS. Data Deposition—Nucleotide sequences have been deposited in the GenBank™ data base under the following GenBank™ accession numbers: EF641108, 16 S rDNA gene of isolate TBEA6; EU825700, 16 S rDNA gene of isolate TBEA3; EU441166, 16 S rDNA gene of isolate SFWT; EU441167, contiguous sequence comprising bugC, fox, bugA, cdo, and ahpD; and EU449952, contiguous sequence comprising act, acd, and partial sequence of bugB. Isolation of TDP-utilizing Bacteria and Taxonomic Affiliation of Isolate TBEA6—From different samples taken from soil, compost, sewage sludge, or the sediment of a fresh water tank, bacterial strains capable of using TDP as sole source of carbon and energy for growth were enriched and isolated (supplemental Table S1). The best growing isolates were designated as TBEA6, TBEA3, and SFWT; they were further characterized by methods of polyphasic taxonomy and by analysis of the 16 S rDNA sequences to unravel their phylogenetic position. All three isolates were Gram-negative, oxidase, and catalase-positive, and best growth was observed at 30 °C, although isolates TBEA6 and SFWT grew also very slowly at 4 °C. Colonies of TBEA6 and SFWT were yellow-pigmented, and the motile cells are short rods with a cell length of 1.5 μm. Using the API 20NE identification test system, reduction of nitrat"

Here we investigated the role of TNFα-induced down-modulation of the de-ubiquitinating enzyme USP2 for hepatocyte survival. Inhibition of hepatocyte apoptosis by pre-treatment with TNFα (TNFα tolerance) was analyzed in the mouse model of galactosamine/TNFα-induced liver injury and in actinomycin D/TNFα-treated primary mouse hepatocytes. The role of USP2 for TNFα-induced hepatocyte survival was studied using small interference RNA or an expression clone. Injection of mice or preincubation of hepatocytes with TNFα caused a rapid down-regulation of hepatic USP2–41kD, the predominant USP2 isoform in the liver. In vitro an artificial knockdown of USP2 inhibited actinomycin D/TNFα-induced hepatocyte apoptosis, which was associated with elevated levels of the anti-apoptotic protein c-FlipL/S and a concomitant decrease of cellular levels of the ubiquitinligase Itch, a negative regulator of c-Flip. USP2–41kD overexpression abrogated TNFα tolerance in vitro, prevented accumulation of c-FlipL/S and resulted in elevated levels of Itch. Accordingly, c-FlipL/S protein levels were elevated in livers of TNFα-tolerant mice, which correlated to a switch from JNK and ERK to p38 signaling after galactosamine/TNF re-challenge. Our results indicate that TNFα-induced USP2 down-regulation is an effective cytoprotective mechanism in hepatocytes. Hence, USP2 could be a novel pharmacological target, and specific USP2 inhibitors might be potential candidates for the treatment of inflammation-related apoptotic liver damage.

The pro-apoptotic downstream signaling of TNFR1 includes c-Jun activating kinase (JNK) and caspase-8 activation. Anti-apoptotic signaling events are IκBα phosphorylation and ubiquitination and NF-κB translocation into the nucleus (1Wullaert A. Heyninck K. Beyaert R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1090-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). During the past few years it became evident that there are numerous balanced interactions between TNFR1-induced signaling pathways, which determine the biological outcome of TNFR1 stimulation in the liver, such as apoptosis, inflammation, regeneration, and survival (2Wullaert A. van Loo G. Heyninck K. Beyaert R. Endocrine Rev. 2007; 28: 365-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Up to now, only a few mediators and mechanisms of the regulation of these pathways are known. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is indispensable for TNFR1 signal transduction. It controls the activation of NF-κB and balances cellular levels of active pro- and anti-apoptotic factors by ubiquitination and degradation (3Wullaert A. Heyninck K. Janssens S. Beyaert R. Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 533-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Among the multiple functions of the UPS are cell cycle regulation, control of signal transduction pathways (4Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), regulation of receptor function (5Wilkinson K.D. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1933-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and control of apoptosis (6Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, dysfunctions in the UPS can cause human diseases, like neurodegenerative diseases (7Layfield R. Alban A. Mayer R.J. Lowe J. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2001; 27: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), cancer (7Layfield R. Alban A. Mayer R.J. Lowe J. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2001; 27: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and cardiac dysfunction (8Zolk O. Schenke C. Sarikas A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 70: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Powell S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: H1-H19Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, ubiquitination is a reversible process. The ubiquitin system includes ubiquitinating enzymes, which tag proteins for degradation by the proteasome (6Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar), as well as de-ubiquitinating enzymes, which save proteins from degradation by cleaving polyubiquitin chains, thereby retaining the cellular function of their substrates (10Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Hence, changes in activity or expression of enzymes, assigned to the ubiquitin proteasome system, are of major interest to intervene in apoptosis and manifold other cellular regulation mechanisms. USP2, a de-ubiquitinating enzyme, is a member of the ubiquitin-specific-protease (USP) group. Recent studies revealed that USP2 is an effective regulator of apoptosis and differentiation. At least three isoforms of USP2 have been described, i.e. USP2–41kD, USP2–45kD, and USP2–69kD. All enzymes share the same catalytic core with different N- and C-terminal extensions (11Baek S.H. Choi K.S. Yoo Y.J. Cho J.M. Baker R.T. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25560-25565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Among those, the 41-kDa and 69-kDa isoforms have been analyzed to affect apoptosis or cell proliferation. For example, overexpression of human USP2–41kD was sufficient to elicit all features of apoptosis in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) (12Gewies A. Grimm S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 682-688PubMed Google Scholar). In human prostate cancer, USP2–69kD is highly overexpressed and promotes tumor growth by stabilizing fatty acid synthetase; accordingly, a knockdown of USP2–69kD by siRNA enhanced apoptosis (13Graner E. Tang D. Rossi S. Baron A. Migita T. Weinstein L.J. Lechpammer M. Huesken D. Zimmermann J. Signoretti S. Loda M. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mouse double minute 2 E3-ubiquitin ligase was identified as a substrate of USP2–69kD, which thereby indirectly controls p53 and apoptosis in H1299 cells (14Stevenson L.F. Sparks A. Allende-Vega N. Xirodimas D.P. Lane D.P. Saville M.K. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 976-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, the function of USP2 in the liver is yet unknown. In the present study we investigated the behavior of the de-ubiquitinating enzyme USP2 in murine liver following TNFα pre-treatment in vivo. The hepatocyte-specific transcriptional inhibitor galactosamine (GalN) (15Pels Rijcken W.R. Ferwerda W. Van den Eijnden D.H. Overdijk B. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 16Decker K. Keppler D. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1974; 71: 77-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sass G. Shembade N.D. Tiegs G. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) sensitizes hepatocytes toward TNFα-induced apoptosis in vivo, and GalN/TNFα-induced liver injury in mice serves as a model for fulminant hepatic failure (18Zang G.Q. Zhou X.Q. Yu H. Xie Q. Zhao G.M. Wang B. Guo Q. Xiang Y.Q. Liao D. World J. Gastroenterol. 2000; 6: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Leist M. Gantner F. Bohlinger I. Tiegs G. Germann P.G. Wendel A. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1220-1234PubMed Google Scholar). Pre-treatment with TNFα has been shown to induce tolerance toward GalN/TNFα-induced fulminant hepatic failure (20Sass G. Koerber K. Tiegs G. Inflamm. Res. 2002; 51: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, genes that are regulated by TNFα are candidates to provoke cytoprotection (17Sass G. Shembade N.D. Tiegs G. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We found that USP2–41kD was strongly down-regulated after intravenous administration of TNFα in murine liver on mRNA and protein level. This finding prompted us to investigate the role of USP2–41kD in hepatocellular apoptosis. We found that an artificial knockdown of USP2 protected hepatocytes from TNFα-induced apoptosis by interference with NF-κB and c-Flip signaling. Mice—BALB/C and C57BL/6 wild-type mice were obtained from the internal animal breeding house of the Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. Animals were maintained under controlled conditions (22 °C, 55% humidity, 12-h day/night rhythm) and fed standard laboratory chow. All mice received human care according to the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and legal requirements in Germany. Animal Treatment—For pre-treatment studies, murine (rmu)-TNFα (Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium) was dissolved in sterile saline/0.1% human serum albumin and injected intravenously to mice into a lateral caudal vein at a dose of 10 μg/kg body weight. Saline/0.1% human serum albumin was used as vehicle control. For induction of liver damage, rmuTNFα was administered in a dose of 5 μg/kg 30 min after intraperitoneal injection of 700 mg/kg GalN (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) dissolved in saline. Isolation of Primary Hepatocytes, Transfection, and Activation Routes—For primary hepatocyte isolation and culture, William’s E + GlutaMAX™-I medium (Invitrogen) was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Biochrom AG seromed®, Berlin, Germany) and 1% l-glutamine (Invitrogen). Hepatocytes were isolated by a modification of the two-step collagenase perfusion method of Seglen (21Sass G. Shembade N.D. Haimerl F. Lamoureux N. Hashemolhosseini S. Tannapfel A. Tiegs G. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 7042-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1973; 82: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar) followed by 10-min centrifugation in a 90% Percoll® gradient (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) at 50 × g to obtain highly purified hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were transfected using Lipofectamine®2000 (Invitrogen). To monitor the transfection efficiency, 4 × 105 primary hepatocytes were transfected with either an EGFP plasmid (pEGFP-N1, Clontech, Mountain View, CA) or 25 nm of a fluorochrome-linked siRNA (AllStars Neg. siRNA AlexaFluor 488, Qiagen) and incubated for 36 and 24 h, respectively. Cell samples were harvested, and either EGFP expression or AlexaFluor 488 fluorescence was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Transfection efficiency was determined from the percentage of GFP- or AlexaFluor 488-positive cells in each sample and found to be 27.4 ± 0.8% for EGFP and 23.5 ± 2.7% for siRNA in transfected cells compared with 1.26 ± 0.04% and 0.55 ± 0.08% in non-transfected controls, respectively. Although transfection efficiency seems to be low in the case of siRNA (probably due to the fluorochrome), reduction of mRNA and protein expression were 73.5 ± 5% and ∼52%, respectively, in case of siUSP2 (cf. Figs. 5B and 7B, lower panel).FIGURE 7Knockdown of USP2 resulted in enhanced NF-κB 24-h basal activity. A, primary hepatocytes were co-transfected with siRNA against USP2 and a luciferase-reporter plasmid with two NF-κB promoter binding sites or controls. As negative control a luciferase plasmid without promoter/enhancer sequences was used. After 24 h luciferase activity was determined from whole cell lysates via bioluminescence assay (mean values ± S.E., n = 3, **, p < 0.01). B, primary hepatocytes were transfected with siRNA against USP2. After 24 h mRNA was isolated and transcribed to cDNA for RT-PCR analysis. USP2 knockdown was verified and transcriptional status of c-Flip was analyzed via real-time PCR (mean values ± S.E., n = 4, *, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For induction of apoptosis hepatocytes were incubated with Act.D/TNFα as previously described (21Sass G. Shembade N.D. Haimerl F. Lamoureux N. Hashemolhosseini S. Tannapfel A. Tiegs G. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 7042-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For TNFα prestimulation in vitro rmuTNFα was added in a final concentration of 40 ng/ml for 6 h. For accumulation of ubiquitinylated protein, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (23Meiners S. Ludwig A. Stangl V. Stangl K. Med. Res. Rev. 2008; 28: 309-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was added to the culture medium at the doses indicated. Analysis of Liver Enzymes and Cellular Damage—In vitro cytotoxicity assays (LDH activity) and serum ALT activity in plasma were determined as described previously (21Sass G. Shembade N.D. Haimerl F. Lamoureux N. Hashemolhosseini S. Tannapfel A. Tiegs G. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 7042-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cloning and Sequencing—Cloning was carried out as described previously (21Sass G. Shembade N.D. Haimerl F. Lamoureux N. Hashemolhosseini S. Tannapfel A. Tiegs G. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 7042-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Sequencing of USP2–41kD expression clone was performed by GATC Biotech AG Company (Konstanz, Germany) in pred20 quality via forward and reverse runs. RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis RT-PCR—RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis procedures were performed as described recently (21Sass G. Shembade N.D. Haimerl F. Lamoureux N. Hashemolhosseini S. Tannapfel A. Tiegs G. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 7042-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To determine the USP2–69kD and the USP2–45kD mRNA fractions from overall USP2 mRNA in murine liver, USP2–69kD and -45kD specific primers and USP2 overall primers, which detect all USP2 isoforms, were used. Primer efficiency calibration curves were recorded using an USP2 expression clone in 1:10 dilutions steps from 10-2 to 10-10. Together with three murine liver cDNA samples, USP2 expression clone dilutions were analyzed with the USP2–69kD and -45kD specific primer and the USP2-overall primers in separate master mixes, but in the same RT-PCR run (24Vandenbroucke I.I. Vandesompele J. Paepe A.D. Messiaen L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E68Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Primers and siRNA—Following primers were used for RT-PCR analysis: β-Actin (X03765, fwd 5′-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAAA-3′, rev 5′-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCG-3′), USP2 all isoforms (NM016808.2, fwd 5′-AGAGGACATATTGGATGGTG-3′, rev 5′-GGCAGTAGGCTGTATAGTGG-3′), USP2 45kD isoform (NM198091.2, fwd 5′-CTGCTGCTCTCCACCTTC-3′, rev 5′-CTCAGATGGGCTCACCAC-3′), USP2 69kD isoform (NM198092.2, fwd 5′-CAGCAACTCCCTCAGCTAC-3′, rev 5′-CCCTTTCGACCATAGTTCTC-3′), and c-Flip (NM207653.3, fwd 5′-CGTAGATGTTATGGCTGGAG-3′, rev 5′-TCATGTCCAAGGGTAATCTG-3′). SiRNAs against the ubiquitin-specific-protease 2 (siUSP2, 5′-GGAACACGUGCUUCAUGAACT-3′) and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (siEGFP, 5′-GCAUCAAGGUGAACUUCAAGA-3′) were obtained from Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). Western Blot Analysis—Protein extraction and analysis were performed as previously described (21Sass G. Shembade N.D. Haimerl F. Lamoureux N. Hashemolhosseini S. Tannapfel A. Tiegs G. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 7042-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm K2HPO4, 10% v/v glycerol, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 0.15% SDS), and centrifuged at 4 °C and 12,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatant was adjusted to a protein concentration of 1.5 μg/ml and precleared with protein-G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) for 1 h at 4 °C. Itch was immunoprecipitated by incubation with 5 ng of anti-Itch-IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) per microgram of protein at 4 °C for 6 h and subsequent addition of protein-G-Sepharose beads shaking overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. Antibodies—USP2 protein was detected with USP2-S260 primary antibody (Abgent, San Diego, CA). Polyclonal rabbit antiubiquitin antibody Z0458 was purchased from Dako-Cytomation (Glostrup, Denmark). Anti-Flip polyclonal antibody H-202 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Itch antibody was purchased from BD Pharmingen (Heidelberg, Germany). Phospho-p38, caspase-3, phospho-JNK, and phospho-ERK antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Luciferase Assay—Cells were co-transfected in 24-well plates with either siEGFP or siUSP2 together with 0.4 μmol of luciferase reporter pB2LUC, containing two NF-κB-binding sites, or with 0.4 μmol of pGL3Basic, encoding only firefly luciferase without promoter or enhancer sequences as reference plasmid. 24 h later, transfected cells were harvested for preparation of whole cell extracts according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Luciferase reporter activity was measured by a commercial assay (Luciferase Assay System, Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Statistical Analysis—Results were analyzed using the Student’s t test if two groups were compared. If more than one group was compared with a control group or if groups were compared among each other, the one-way analysis of variance test was used followed by Dunnett’s and Bonferri’s tests, respectively. All data are expressed as a mean values ± S.E. A value of p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. TNFα Induces Cytoprotection toward Hepatocyte Death in Vivo and in Vitro—Administration of low doses of TNFα to mice does not induce apoptosis in the liver, but even protects mice from liver damage induced by GalN/TNFα re-challenge (TNF tolerance) (17Sass G. Shembade N.D. Tiegs G. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The time course of TNFα pretreatment shown in Fig. 1A indicates that TNF tolerance was inducible as early as 1–2 h after intravenous injection and persisted for at least 24 h. After 48 h, mice were again susceptible to GalN/TNFα-induced liver damage. TNF tolerance was also inducible in vitro (Fig. 1B), i.e. TNFα pre-treatment for 6 h prevented Act.D/TNFα-induced cell death of cultured primary mouse hepatocytes. TNFα Down-regulates USP2 mRNA and Protein in Murine Liver—In view of the rapid hepatocellular desensitization upon TNFα pretreatment, we focused on a possible involvement of the UPS in the initiating mechanism of TNF tolerance. Recently performed cDNA array screening in TNFR2-/- mice for TNFR1-regulated genes in murine liver revealed both TNFα up-regulated as well as TNFα down-regulated mRNA gene transcripts (17Sass G. Shembade N.D. Tiegs G. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). With regard to mediators assigned to the UPS, we found that the mRNA of the de-ubiquitinating enzyme USP2 was down-regulated by TNFα (17Sass G. Shembade N.D. Tiegs G. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Re-evaluation by quantitative real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that USP2 mRNA levels were substantially decreased in TNFα-treated mice compared with control animals (Fig. 2A). USP2 mRNA down-regulation occurred very rapidly and was restored 4 h after TNFα application. TNFα also decreased USP2 protein in murine liver lysates compared with control (Fig. 2B). The hepatocyte-specific transcriptional inhibitor GalN abolished TNFα-induced down-regulation of USP2 mRNA (Fig. 2C). Hence, USP2 seems to be regulated by TNFα in liver parenchyma and is potentially involved in GalN-induced sensitization of hepatocytes to TNFα. USP2–41kD Is the Predominant Isoform in Murine Liver—USPs have N- and/or C-terminal extensions that allow the selective interaction with distinct substrates and determine the cellular localization of the de-ubiquitinating enzyme (25D'Andrea A. Pellman D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Splicing isoforms of USP2 were shown to exhibit antagonistic biological roles (26Park K.C. Kim J.H. Choi E.J. Min S.W. Rhee S. Baek S.H. Chung S.S. Bang O. Park D. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9733-9738Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and recent studies attribute a tumor-promoting function to human USP2–69kD (13Graner E. Tang D. Rossi S. Baron A. Migita T. Weinstein L.J. Lechpammer M. Huesken D. Zimmermann J. Signoretti S. Loda M. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), but describe human USP2–41kD as a pro-apoptotic regulator (12Gewies A. Grimm S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 682-688PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize the role of USP2 in the liver, we quantitatively analyzed USP2-splicing isoforms via real-time PCR (24Vandenbroucke I.I. Vandesompele J. Paepe A.D. Messiaen L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E68Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and found only small fractions of 45- and 69-kDa mRNA in overall USP2 mRNA (Fig. 3A). Hence it seems that USP2–41kD is the predominant isoform in murine liver on mRNA level (Fig. 3B). Western blot analysis confirmed USP2–41kD as the predominant isoform on the protein level, and only a very small fraction of USP2–69kD could be detected (Fig. 3C). USP2–45kD was not detectable on the protein level (Fig. 3C). Screening of different murine tissues for USP2 expression revealed remarkable USP2–69kD expression only in kidney lysates (Fig. 3D). USP2–41kD Is a Pro-apoptotic Regulator in Hepatocytes in Vitro—To elucidate the role of USP2 in TNFα-induced apoptosis we studied the effect of an artificial USP2 knockdown on Act.D/TNFα-induced cell damage in primary hepatocytes. Compared with siEGFP-transfected primary hepatocytes siUSP2-treated cells showed significantly less cellular damage in response to Act.D/TNFα, as quantified by LDH release (Fig. 4A), as well as substantially reduced cleavage of caspase-3 into its catalytic active 17-kDa fragment, as determined 3.5 h after incubation with Act.D/TNFα (Fig. 4B). Hence, siUSP2 inhibited LDH release by 40 ± 5% at the end of the experiment (Fig. 4A) compared with 58 ± 6% reduction of LDH release by preincubation of hepatocytes with TNFα (Fig. 1B). Because the efficacy of the USP2 knockdown was 73.5 ± 5% with respect to mRNA (Fig. 7B, lower panel) and ∼52% with respect to USP2 protein repression (Fig. 5B), the potency to block cytotoxicity of either siUSP2 or TNFα was in a comparable range. The role of down-modulation of USP2–41kD for TNF tolerance was confirmed by showing that hepatocytes were re-sensitized to Act.D/TNFα-induced apoptosis by USP2–41 overexpression (Fig. 4C). Hepatocellular c-Flip and Itch Protein Levels Correlate with USP2 Expression in Vitro—To investigate the correlation between TNF-induced cytoprotection and down-modulation of the de-ubiquitinating enzyme USP2 we focused on c-Flip, which is an NF-κB-dependent TNFα-inducible survival protein that is also regulated by the UPS (27Perez D. White E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2651-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Chang L. Kamata H. Solinas G. Luo J.L. Maeda S. Venuprasad K. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Cell. 2006; 124: 601-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). We studied whether artificial knockdown of USP2 would affect levels of c-Flip in hepatocytes. As shown in Fig. 5A, transfection of siUSP2 caused elevated levels of c-Flip protein. Because USP2 is a de-ubiquitinating enzyme, these results, showing that the lack of USP2 resulted in c-Flip stabilization, were unexpected and suggested an indirect effect of USP2 down-modulation and inhibition of c-Flip degradation. It has been shown recently that the ubiquitin E3-ligase Itch is a negative regulator of c-Flip (28Chang L. Kamata H. Solinas G. Luo J.L. Maeda S. Venuprasad K. Liu Y.C. Karin M.

Indeed, the USP2 knockdown resulted in a reduction of cellular levels of Itch (Fig. 5B) suggesting an interference of USP2 with the JNK-Itch pro-apoptotic pathway, which has been identified recently (28Chang L.

Proteasome inhibitors were shown to protect hepatocytes from TNFα-induced apoptosis by accumulation of c-Flip (28Chang L. Kamata H. Solinas G. Luo J.L. Maeda S. Venuprasad K. Liu Y.C. Karin M.

The proteasome inhibitor MG132 enriched the fraction of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in hepatocytes in vitro in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (data not shown). Western blot analysis revealed that a concentration of 5 μm MG132 generated a backup of ubiquitinated proteins within 24 h without completely abolishing proteasome function, as 200 μm MG132 resulted in much higher accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins within the same time frame (data not shown). Hence, proteasomal degradation of proteins is still possible in the presence of 5 μm MG132. The regimen of 24-h preincubation with 5 μm MG132 alleviated Act.D/TNFα-induced apoptosis of hepatocytes in vitro (Fig. 5C). Although MG132 alone showed low toxicity at this concentration, probably by its NF-κB-silencing activity (31Gross S. Piwnica-Worms D. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the overall effect seemed to be overcompensated by accumulation of c-Flip (Fig. 5D). To investigate whether USP2–41kD would interfere with MG132-induced accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and c-Flip, we overexpressed USP2–41kD in primary hepatocytes. USP2–41kD transfection inhibited the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 5D) as well as of c-Flip (Fig. 5E) in the presence of MG132. According to our results obtained with the USP2 knockdown we found that protein levels of Itch were elevated by USP2–41kD overexpression (Fig. 5E). Likewise, in contrast to hepatocytes transfected with a control vector, no ubiquitinated Itch protein could be immunoprecipitated from hepatocytes overexpressing USP2–41kD (Fig. 5F). Concordantly, USP2–41kD overexpression caused a mild increase of MG132 cytotoxicity, indicating that the de-ubi"
https://openalex.org/W2045693101,"Background With the exception of some live vaccines, e.g. BCG, subunit vaccines formulated with “classical” adjuvants do not induce similar responses in neonates as in adults. The usual neonatal profile is characterized by lower levels of TH1-associated biomarkers. This has hampered the development of new neonatal vaccines for diseases that require early protection. Tuberculosis is one of the major targets for neonatal immunization. In this study, we assessed the immunogenicity of a novel candidate vaccine comprising a mycobacterial fusion protein, Ag85B-ESAT-6, in a neonatal murine immunization model. Methods/Findings The Ag85B-ESAT-6 fusion protein was formulated either with a classical alum based adjuvant or with the novel IC31® adjuvant. Following neonatal or adult immunization, 3 parameters were studied in vivo: (1) CD4+ T cell responses, (2) vaccine targeting/activation of dendritic cells (DC) and (3) protection in a surrogate mycobacterial challenge model. Conversely to Alum, IC31® induced in both age groups strong Th1 and Th17 responses, characterized by multifunctional T cells expressing IL-2 and TNF-α with or without IFN-γ. In the draining lymph nodes, a similarly small number of DC contained the adjuvant and/or the antigen following neonatal or adult immunization. Expression of CD40, CD80, CD86 and IL-12p40 production was focused on the minute adjuvant-bearing DC population. Again, DC targeting/activation was similar in adults and neonates. These DC/T cell responses resulted in an equivalent reduction of bacterial growth following infection with M. bovis BCG, whereas no protection was observed when Alum was used as adjuvant. Conclusion Neonatal immunization with the IC31®- adjuvanted Ag85B-ESAT-6 subunit vaccine elicited adult-like multifunctional protective anti-mycobacterial T cell responses through the induction of an adult pattern of in vivo DC activation."

Based on studies of S. pombe, it has been proposed that SpHMT-1 transports heavy metal·phytochelatin (PC) complexes into the vacuolysosomal compartment. PCs are glutathione derivatives synthesized by PC synthases (PCS) in plants, fungi, and C. elegans in response to heavy metals. Our previous studies in C. elegans, however, suggested that HMT-1 and PCS-1 do not necessarily act in concert in metal detoxification. To further explore this inconsistency, we have gone on to test whether DmHMT-1, an HMT-1 from a new source, Drosophila, whose genome lacks PCS homologs, functions in heavy metal detoxification. In so doing, we show that heterologously expressed DmHMT-1 suppresses the Cd2+ hypersensitivity of S. pombe hmt-1 mutants and localizes to the vacuolar membrane but does not transport Cd·PC complexes. Crucially, similar analyses of S. pombe hmt-1 mutants extend this finding to show that SpHMT-1 itself either does not transport Cd·PC complexes or is not the principal Cd·PC/apoPC transporter. Consistent with this discovery and with our previous suggestion that HMT-1 and PCS-1 do not operate in a simple linear metal detoxification pathway, we demonstrate that, unlike PCS-deficient cells, which are hypersensitive to several heavy metals, SpHMT-1-deficient cells are hypersensitive to Cd2+, but not to Hg2+ or As3+. These findings significantly change our current understanding of the function of HMT-1 proteins and invoke a PC-independent role for these transporters in Cd2+ detoxification.

The adverse health effects of heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd2+), mercury (Hg2+), and lead (Pb2+) from food and air are well established (1Hyman M.H. Altern. Ther.

Despite this knowledge, exposure to heavy metals continues, and has even increased in some areas, due to their sustained production and emission into the environment. At the cellular level, the toxicity of heavy metals results from the displacement of endogenous cofactors from their cellular binding sites, the oxidation of essential enzymes and other proteins, and promotion of the formation of reactive oxygen species (3Vallee B.L.

The ABC transporter family is one of the largest families of membrane proteins. Although 60 ABC transporter family members are known in Caenorhabditis elegans, 49 in humans, 57 in Drosophila, 103 in Arabidopsis, 30 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and 11 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (10Iwaki T.

Plant Biol. 2007; 58: 347-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), the exact role played by the many that are implicated in heavy metal detoxification remains to be determined. What is known is that ABC transporters mediate the Mg·ATP-energized transmembrane transport of a wide range of substrates, reside on different cellular membranes, and, although functionally diverse, share a common architecture. Canonical, “full-molecule” ABC transporters consist of four domains: two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) that contain the Walker A and B boxes and the ABC signature motif (14Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). “Half-molecule” ABC transporters contain a single TMD and NBD. Some members of either the full- or half-molecule subfamilies of ABC proteins possess a hydrophobic N-terminal extension (NTE). The NTE encompasses five to six transmembrane spans (the TMD0 domain) and a cytosolic linker sequence (L0) contiguous with the TMD or NBD (5Vatamaniuk O.K. Bucher E.A. Sundaram M.V. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23684-23690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Rea P.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2007; 58: 347-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Among ABC transporters, the structure of HMT-1 (heavy metal tolerance factor 1) proteins is unique: they are the only half-molecule ABC proteins with an NTE. This domain organization of HMT-1 proteins is conserved across species and distinguishes the HMT-1 protein subfamily from other members of ABC transporter superfamily (5Vatamaniuk O.K. Bucher E.A.

The first HMT-1-like protein identified, SpHMT-1, was isolated from S. pombe in mutant screens for genes involved in phytochelatin (PC)-mediated heavy metal tolerance (7Ortiz D.F. Kreppel L. Speiser D.M. Scheel G. McDonald G. Ow D.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). PCs are small, cysteine-rich peptides with the general structure γ-(EC)nXaa, where n = 2–11. PCs are synthesized in the presence of heavy metals from glutathione (GSH) and related thiols by PC synthases (PCS), bind heavy metals with high affinity, and facilitate heavy metal sequestration into the vacuole, a lysosome-like compartment of plant and fungal cells (15Zenk M.H. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 16Grill E. Laffler S. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6838-6842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that, in plants, metal·PC complexes are transported into vacuoles by unidentified ABC transporter(s) (17Salt D.E. Rauser W.E. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1293-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Based on in vitro transport assays, it has been proposed that, in S. pombe, SpHMT-1 is a vacuolar membrane Cd·PC and/or apoPC transporter that functions downstream of PC formation in the PCS-dependent pathway (18Ortiz D.F. Ruscitti T. McCue K.F. Ow D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4721-4728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined directly if the transport of PCs is the mechanism by which SpHMT-1 alleviates Cd2+ toxicity in vivo. Indeed, several considerations indicate that the function of HMT-1 in metal detoxification is more complex than previously thought. First, studies of the HMT-1-like protein from C. elegans, CeHMT-1, yielded findings that suggest an alternate and/or auxiliary role for HMT-1 in heavy metal detoxification, which is not obligatorily dependent on the upstream synthesis of PCs (5Vatamaniuk O.K. Bucher E.A. Sundaram M.V. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23684-23690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Second, the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii SpHMT-1 homolog, CrCDS1, confers heavy metal tolerance, yet localizes to the mitochondrion, an organelle that does not directly participate in intracellular Cd·PC sequestration (9Hanikenne M. Matagne R.F. Loppes R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 196: 107-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, genes encoding HMT-1 homologs have not been detected in the genomes of vascular plants, which utilize the PC-dependent pathway (12Sanchez-Fernandez R. Davies T.G.E. Coleman J.O.D. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30231-30244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 13Rea P.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2007; 58: 347-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Fourth, ABC transporters with an HMT-1-type domain organization have been identified in the genomes of organisms that do not have PCS genes. Examples are the fly, Drosophila melanogaster, HMT-1 (DmHMT-1 alias CG4225), and its counterparts in mammals, including human MTABC3 and mouse ABCB6 (5Vatamaniuk O.K. Bucher E.A. Sundaram M.V. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23684-23690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Evidently, these HMT-1 proteins do not ordinarily transport metal·PC complexes and/or apoPCs, because these are substances they would never encounter in vivo. To further our understanding of the role of HMT-1-type transporters, we have sought to determine whether the HMT-1 from Drosophila is involved in metal detoxification. If it is, this would imply that HMT-1 proteins from different species share a conserved role in heavy metal detoxification, but one that does not depend on the synthesis of PCs. The results presented here establish the need for revision of the role that HMT-1 proteins have been considered to play in the detoxification of heavy metals, invoke a specific requirement for HMT-1 of S. pombe in the detoxification of Cd2+, but not other heavy metals while at the same time explain why some of the organisms that engage in PC-dependent metal detoxification lack strict HMT-1 homologs. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—The S. pombe strains used in these studies were the wild type strain YF016 (h- leu 1–32, ura 4-C190T ade7::ura4) and its isogenic hmt-1Δ mutant (h- leu 1–32, ura 4-C190T ade7::ura4; hmt-1::URA4) (19Iwaki T. Goa T. Tanaka N. Takegawa K. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2004; 271: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the wild type strain Sp286 (h+/h+ ade6-M210/ade6-M216 ura4-D18/ura4-D18 leu1–32/leu1–32) and its isogenic pcs-1Δ mutant (h+/h+ ade6-M210/ade6-M216). Cells were grown at 30 °C in Edinburgh minimal medium (EMM), which in addition to leucine, adenine (225 mg/liter each), 2% (w/v) dextrose, and in the case of YF016 and Sp286 cells, uracil (225 mg/liter), contained: 14.7 mm potassium hydrogen phthalate, 15.5 mm Na2HPO4, 93.5 mm NH4Cl, 0.26 m MgCl2·6H2O, 4.99 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 0.67 m KCl, 14.l mm Na2SO4, 80.9 mm boric acid, 23.7 mm MnSO4, 13.9 mm ZnSO4·7H2O, 7.4 mm FeCl2·6H2O, 2.47 mm molybdic acid, 6.02 mm KI, 1.60 mm CuSO4·5H2O, 47.6 mm citric acid, 4.20 mm pantothenic acid, 8l.2 mm nicotinic acid, 55.5 mm inositol, and 40.8 μm biotin. S. pombe transformants were selected for leucine prototrophy in EMM. For the assessment of Cd2+ tolerance, the EMM growth media were supplemented with CdCl2 at the concentrations indicated. Isolation and Heterologous Expression of dm-hmt-1—The cDNA corresponding to dm-hmt-1 was obtained from the Drosophila Genomics Resource Center, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN. Primers for amplification of the open reading frame for dm-hmt-1 were designed to generate Xho1 and Not1 restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-termini, respectively, of the dm-hmt-1 amplification product. The sequences of the two primers yielding the 2.6-kb dm-hmt-1 amplification product were 5′-CGGCTCGAGATGCTGTACTGCCCGCCCAACG-3′ and 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCCTAGCGTGCTCCCCCA-3′. The resulting cDNA (GenBank™ accession number ACE60575) was subcloned into the Xho1 and Not1 restriction sites of the S. pombe-Escherichia coli shuttle vector, pTN197 (19Iwaki T. Goa T. Tanaka N. Takegawa K. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2004; 271: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), to place dm-hmt-1 under the control of the thiamine-repressible promoter of the nmt1 gene. The resulting pTN197-dm-hmt-1 construct, or pTN197 vector lacking the dm-hmt-1 insert, was expressed in S. pombe hmt-1Δ cells. To permit direct comparisons with isogenic wild-type YF016 cells grown under identical conditions, the pTN197 vector was expressed in YF016 cells. Transformation of S. pombe—S. pombe cells were transformed using a standard lithium acetate procedure (20Okazaki K. Okazaki N. Kume K. Jinno S. Tanaka K. Okayama H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6485-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were selected for leucine prototrophy in EMM medium as described above. Isolation of Intact Vacuoles—For the isolation of intact vacuoles, YF016/pTN197, hmt-1Δ/pTN197, or hmt-1Δ/DmHMT-1 cells were subjected to cell wall digestion, disruption, and fractionation by differential centrifugation. 200-ml volumes of stationary phase cultures were diluted into 1.5 liters of EMM medium containing supplements and grown for 4–6 h at 30 °C to an A600 nm of ∼0.6 after which time CdCl2 (500 μm) was added to the cultures to activate PC production. Thereafter the cells were cultured in the presence of CdCl2 for an additional 18 h at 30 °C to an A600 of ∼1.2, collected by centrifugation, and used for the isolation of intact vacuoles by a modification of the procedure described in Ref. 18Ortiz D.F. Ruscitti T. McCue K.F. Ow D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4721-4728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar. Briefly, the sedimented cells were washed in water and harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min. After resuspension in 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.4), the cells were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with gentle shaking. The cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 100 ml of digestion medium containing 1.2 m sorbitol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and converted to spheroplasts by the addition of 50 mg of Zymolyase 20T (ICN) and 100 mg of lysing enzymes from Trichoderma harzianum (Sigma-Aldrich). The suspension was incubated for 2 h at 30 °C with gentle shaking and pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min. The spheroplasts were washed free of digestion medium resuspension in 50 ml of ice-cold homogenization medium (HM) consisting of 1.6 m sorbitol, 10 mm MES-Tris (pH 6.9), 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin. The pelleted spheroplasts were lysed in the same medium (20 ml) by homogenization in a 50-ml glass Dounce homogenizer. The crude lysate was cleared of cell debris and unbroken cells by centrifugation at 4,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in another 20 ml of homogenization medium, homogenized again, and recentrifuged. Partially purified vacuoles (the P13,000 fraction) were collected by centrifugation of the supernatant at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, resuspended in HM, layered onto a Percoll step gradient (18%/30% (v/v) prepared in HM), and pelleted at 68,320 × gat4°C for 1 h. The resulting vacuolar pellet was resuspended in HM and layered on a cushion of 50% (v/v) of Percoll, prepared in HM and re-pelleted at 68,320 × g for 1 h. The pellet containing purified vacuoles was washed free of Percoll by three rounds of resuspension in suspension medium containing 1.6 m sorbitol, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.9, 5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors, and centrifuged at 4 °C at 13,000 rpm for 10 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The final vacuolar preparation was used immediately or stored at -80 °C. Assessment of Integrity of Vacuole Preparations—The integrity of the vacuoles prepared in this way was assessed by testing their ability to retain the fluorescent glutathione S-conjugate of monochlorobimane (MCB), bimane-GS (6Li Z.S. Lu Y.P. Zhen R.G. Szczypka M. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 21Sarry J.E. Chen S. Collum R.P. Liang S. Peng M.

MCB is a membrane-permeant, non-fluorescent compound that is specifically conjugated with GSH by cytosolic glutathione S-transferases to generate the intensely fluorescent, membrane-impermeant product bimane-GS that is actively transported into and sequestered within the vacuole of intact cells. 75-ml volumes of stationary phase S. pombe cell cultures were diluted into 500 ml of EMM medium containing MCB (150 μm) and grown for 20 h at 30 °C, after which time the cells were harvested and converted to spheroplasts for the purification of intact vacuoles as described above. Cells, spheroplasts, and vacuoles from this source were examined without fixation by fluorescent microscopy. Enzyme Assays—The purity of the vacuolar fractions was evaluated by marker enzyme assays. α-Mannosidase activity, a vacuolar membrane marker, was employed to enumerate enrichment of the partially purified (P13,000) and final vacuolar fractions. Cytochrome c oxidase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity were employed to assess contamination of these fractions with mitochondria and cytosolic components, respectively. α-Mannosidase was determined using p-nitrophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside as substrate (22Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was assayed by measuring the rate of glucose-6-phosphate-dependent NADPH formation (22Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The activity of cytochrome c oxidase activity was assayed using a colorimetric assay based on the decrease in absorbance of ferrocytochrome c caused by its oxidation to ferricytochrome c by cytochrome c oxidase (23Poyton R.O. Goehring B. Droste M. Sevarino K.A. Allen L.A. Zhao X.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 97-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Measurement of PC Content—The PC contents of the isolated intact vacuole preparations were estimated by a combination of reverse-phase (RP)-HPLC and thiol quantitation after reaction with Ellman reagent (24Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.P. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31451-31459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Aliquots of vacuoles (10–20 μg of protein) were made 5% (w/v) with 5-sulfosalicylic acid, protein was pelleted by centrifugation, and aliquots of the supernatant (50 μl) were loaded onto an Econosphere C18, 150 × 4.6-mm RP-HPLC column (Alltech). The column was developed with a linear gradient of water/0.05% (v/v) phosphoric acid, 17% (v/v) acetonitrile/0.05% (v/v) phosphoric acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For the quantitation of PCs, thiols were estimated spectrophotometrically at 412 nm by reacting aliquots (500 μl) of the column fractions with 0.8 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (500 μl) dissolved in 250 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.6 (25Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). Calibration was with GSH. Individual PC fractions were identified on the basis of their co-migration with PC standards synthesized in vitro by purified AtPCS1-FLAG (26Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.P. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and by mass spectrometry as described below. ESI-MS and Tandem LC-MALDI-MS—Intact vacuoles were subjected to LC-MALDI-MS and ESI-MS analyses for the identification of PCs. The MALDI analysis utilized an LC Packings UltiMate nano-LC system. Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and the mobile phase B consisted of 0.1% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile (v/v). Injections (6.4 μl) of the PC samples dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid were loaded for 5 min onto a trapping column (C18 Pep-Map100, 300 μmID × 5 mm, 5-μm particle size, 100-Å pore size) in 20 μl/min mobile phase A. Thereafter, a linear 40-min gradient of 0–55% B was directed through the trap column onto an analytical column (C18 PepMap 100, 75 μm inner diameter × 15 cm, 3-μm particle size) at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. The column effluent was directed to an LC Packings Probot fraction collector where it was mixed at a constant 705 nl/min flow rate with 7.5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinammic acid and 20 fmol/μl [Glu]1-fibrinopeptide B dissolved in 2% (w/w) ammonium citrate. This mixture was spotted onto MALDI plates at 20-s collections/fraction. The MALDI plates were analyzed in an Applied Biosystems/MDX Sciex 4700 MALDI TOF/TOF Proteomics Analyzer operated in positive ion mode. An m/z range from 400 to 4000 was scanned for each fraction with internal calibration at an m/z of 1570.677 corresponding to the GluFib added to the matrix solution. PCs were detected by integrating all fractions for representative m/z values to produce ion current chromatograms across each plate. PC2 in the vacuolar extracts was identified as an m/z 540.2 species (theoretical mean isotopic mass [M+H]+ of PC2 (γ-Gly-Cys)2-Gly is 540.14). The ESI analyses were performed using a PerkinElmer 200 micro LC system. Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water, and mobile phase B consisted of 0.1% formic acid in 90% (w/v) acetonitrile. After injection of a 10-μl sample, the column (Vydac C18 MassSpec, 1-mm inner diameter × 150 mm, 5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size) was developed with 100% A (0–2 min); a linear gradient to 60% B (2–30 min); and 60% B (30–35 min) at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. The column effluent was directed to an Applied Biosystems/MDX Sciex API 150 single quadrupole mass spectrometer with a turbo ion spray source. The instrument was operated in positive ion mode with the settings optimized for GSH by scanning in the m/z range 300–1600. PCs were detected by extracting the ion currents for their representative m/z values from the total ion current for each separation. The presence of PC3 and PC4 was inferred from [M+H]+ m/z ratios of 772.2 and 1004.2, respectively (theoretical mean isotopic mass [M+H]+ of PC3 (γ-Gly-Cys)3-Gly is 772.19; that of PC4 (γ-Gly-Cys)4-Gly is 1004.2). Analyses of Cadmium Content of Isolated Intact Vacuoles by ICP-AES—Aliquots of the intact vacuole fractions (70 μl) were placed in 20.0-ml quartz tubes and digested with 0.25 ml of a 50/50 mixture of concentrated nitric acid and perchloric acid at 120 °C until dry before a second 0.25 ml of a 50/50 mixture of concentrated nitric acid, and perchloric acid was added and heated at 220 °C until dry. The ash was dissolved in 15.0 ml of 2% nitric acid and analyzed on an axially viewed ICP trace analyzer emission spectrometer (model ICAP 61E trace analyzer, Thermo Electron, Waltham, MA). To minimize matrix effects, short depth of field optics were employed (U.S. Patent No. 6,122050). Protein Estimations—Protein was estimated by using the dye-binding method (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Chemicals—All of the general reagents were obtained from Fisher, Research Organics, Inc., Invitrogen, or Sigma-Aldrich. Identification and Cloning of dm-hmt-1—dm-hmt-1 (Drosophila melanogaster heavy metal tolerance factor 1 (GenBank™ accession number ACE60575) encoding a 97.9-kDa polypeptide, DmHMT-1, was identified by systematic domain comparisons among the half-molecule ABC transporters in sequence databases by scanning for proteins with an HMT-1-specific organization: the presence of a single TMD, containing six transmembrane spans and an NBF, containing Walker A and B boxes (sequences GPSGAGKS and IVLLD, respectively), separated by an ABC signature motif (sequence LSGGEKQRVAIARTL), and an NTE consisting of an ∼200-residue TMD0 domain containing five hydrophilicity minima and an ∼50 residue L0 domain. DmHMT-1, which shares 55% sequence similarity (37% sequence identity) to SpHMT-1 and 57% sequence similarity (44% sequence identity) to CeHMT-1, possesses a 244-amino acid residue NTE, consisting of a 192-amino acid TMD0 encompassing five hydrophilicity minima and a 54-amino acid residue L0 domain, oriented in tandem with the TMD and NBF domains (Fig. 1). The presence of the NTE distinguishes DmHMT-1 from its closest homologs, the ATMs (ABC transporters of the mitochondrion), which possess a mitochondrial-targeting signal peptide instead of an NTE domain, are implicated in iron homeostasis, and localize to the inner-mitochondrial membrane (28Lill R. Kispal G. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences of representative HMT-1 and ATM subfamily members from yeast, Arabidopsis, C. elegans, Drosophila, and mammals demonstrated that the HMTs form a common subcluster, distinct from that of the ATMs (Fig. 2). As is evident from Fig. 2, DmHMT-1, CeHMT-1, and MTABC3 group together within the HMT-1 subcluster, but are distinct from SpHMT-1, which might imply evolutionary and possibly functional divergence of the former three HMTs from SpHMT1. The cDNA corresponding to the predicted open reading frame of dm-hmt-1 was isolated by PCR from a cDNA clone obtained from the Drosophila Genomics Resource Center. After confirming the fidelity of the 2.6-kb amplification product by sequencing, it was used for the experiments described below. Heterologously Expressed DmHMT-1 Partially Suppresses the Cd2+ Hypersensitivity of S. pombe hmt-1Δ Mutants—All HMT-1-like proteins characterized to date have been isolated from organisms possessing PC synthase genes and have been shown to contribute to the alleviation of Cd2+ toxicity. Based on studies in S. pombe, they have been implicated in the vacuolysosomal sequestration of Cd·PC complexes. Because the Drosophila genome does not possess PC synthase homologs, the question of whether DmHMT-1 confers heavy metal tolerance was intriguing. If dm-hmt-1 encodes a protein that is functionally equivalent to or has significant functional overlap with SpHMT-1, its heterologous expression in a Cd2+-hypersensitive S. pombe hmt-1 mutant strain (hmt-1Δ) should alleviate the hypersen"

In the present study, we have investigated the physiological function of a newly described serine/threonine protein kinase D2 (PKD2) in aspects of endothelial cell biology involved in angiogenesis. We found that PKD2 was expressed in primary human endothelial cells from different tissues and was a critical PKD isoform mediating the phosphorylation of PKD substrates in endothelial cells. By using small interference RNAs that target different PKD2 regions, we found that silencing PKD2, but not PKD1 isoform, markedly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and in vitro angiogenesis of endothelial cells cultured in EGM-2 complete medium. We further showed that PKD2, but not PKD1, was required for the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 that are two key growth factor receptors involved in angiogenesis. These findings indicate that PKD2 plays a pivotal role in endothelial cell proliferation and migration necessary for angiogenesis at least in part through modulation of the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1.

Angiogenesis is the fundamental physiological process by which new blood vessels are generated from pre-existing vasculature. It plays a crucial role in embryonic development in addition to numerous normal physiological processes. Angiogenesis is critically involved in a wide variety of human diseases including ischemic vascular diseases, tumor growth and metastasis, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and rheumatoid arthritis (1Carmeliet P.

Emerging evidence indicates that angiogenesis also plays a critical role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the vessel wall (4Moulton K.S.

For these reasons, an understanding of the complex mechanisms that regulate angiogenesis is seen not only as a fundamental problem in human biology but also critical in fulfilling the important goal of biomedical research to develop more specific and efficacious pro- and anti-angiogenesis therapies. The process of angiogenesis depends on endothelial cell (EC) 2The abbreviations used are: EC, endothelial cell; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; PKD2, protein kinase D2; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR2, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; siRNA, small interference RNA; PMA, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; PECAM-1, platelet-endothelial-cell adhesion molecule-1; TGFβ-RII, transforming growth factor β type-II receptor; IGF1-Rβ, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor-β; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; PTP-MEG2, protein tyrosine phosphatase MEG2. proliferation, migration, and differentiation. It is controlled by a variety of positive and negative signals. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, also termed VEGF-A) is the most critical and potent of all the known proangiogenic factors, and its proangiogenic effect is mediated through the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2, also termed Flk-1 or KDR) that is selectively expressed in vascular ECs (8Olsson A.K. Dimberg A. Kreuger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2479) Google Scholar). Besides VEGF, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors that are expressed on ECs also play a crucial role in angiogenesis (9Presta M. Dell'Era P. Mitola S. Moroni E. Ronca R. Rusnati M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 159-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). ECs express the FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1), and under some circumstances, FGFR2. Activation of FGFR1 or FGFR2 promotes EC proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis (9Presta M. Dell'Era P. Mitola S. Moroni E. Ronca R. Rusnati M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 159-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Additionally, angiopoietins, transforming growth factors, cytokines including interleukins and chemokines, and the extracellular matrix also regulate angiogenesis (9Presta M. Dell'Era P. Mitola S. Moroni E. Ronca R. Rusnati M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 159-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that many cell types including leukocytes, vascular cells, epithelial cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells can produce various proangiogenic factors such as VEGF and FGF in response to stimuli. The regulation of those proangiogenic factors has been well studied (8Olsson A.K. Dimberg A. Kreuger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2479) Google Scholar, 9Presta M. Dell'Era P. Mitola S. Moroni E. Ronca R. Rusnati M.

Res. 2007; 74: 100-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and we have learned much about VEGFR2 and FGFR1 signal transduction. However, comparatively less is known about the regulation of VEGFR2 and FGFR1 expression in ECs. Identification of targetable (drugable) molecules or pathways regulating the expression of these key growth factor receptors on ECs may lead to more specific and efficacious pro- and anti-angiogenic therapies. Protein kinase D2 (PKD2) is a member of a newly described serine/threonine protein kinase family that includes PKD1 (also known as protein kinase C-μ) and PKD3 (protein kinase C-ν) (12Rozengurt E. Rey O. Waldron R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13205-13208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 13Sturany S. Van Lint J. Muller F. Wilda M. Hameister H. Hocker M.

PKD contains a tandem repeat of zinc finger-like cysteine-rich motifs at its N terminus that display high affinity for diacylglycerol or phorbol ester, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a C-terminal catalytic domain that shares homology with the calmodulin-dependent kinases (12Rozengurt E.

It has been demonstrated that PKD2 has unique N-terminal and C-terminal domains that determine its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, activation and substrate targeting (14Auer A. von Blume J.

Commun. 2006; 342: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To date, PKD1 is the best characterized isoform of this family, and it has been implicated to be functionally involved in cell migration, survival/apoptosis, membrane trafficking, and the expression of gene sets modulated by histone deacetylases (12Rozengurt E. Rey O. Waldron R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13205-13208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In contrast, relatively little is known about the biological functions of PKD2 and PKD3. It has been shown that overexpression of PKD2 potentiates DNA synthesis by bombesin in Swiss 3T3 cells (18Sinnett-Smith J. Zhukova E. Rey O. Rozengurt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 211: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PKD2s also regulate the activation of nuclear factor κB evoked by the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase and by lysophosphatidic acid in human myeloid leukemia cells and human colonic epithelial cells, respectively (19Mihailovic T. Marx M. Auer A. Van Lint J. Schmid M. Weber C. Seufferlein T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8939-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Chiu T.T. Leung W.Y. Moyer M.P. Strieter R.M. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C767-C777Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent report has shown that PKD2 regulates EC migration by VEGF, although the mechanism is unclear (21Evans I.M. Britton G. Zachary I.C. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Despite these intriguing observations, the specific physiological functions of PKD2 in EC biology, including the identity of PKD2-regulated genes and of PKD2 protein substrates in ECs, are largely unknown. In this report, we have identified PKD2 as a pivotal regulator of EC proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. We show that PKD2 is expressed in primary human ECs from different tissues and is an important PKD isoform mediating the phosphorylation of PKD substrates in ECs. We further show that PKD2, but not its isoform PKD1, is required for EC expression of both VEGFR2 and FGFR1, two key growth factor receptors involved in angiogenesis. Lastly, we have accumulated substantial lines of evidence indicating that PKD2 is crucial for EC proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis.

For siRNA transfection, HUVECs were seeded into different plates for 24 h to reach 50–70% confluence, and then siRNA was transfected into HUVECs in a final concentration of 20 nm by using Lipofectamine 2000 and Opti-MEM reduced serum medium according to the manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen). The medium was replaced with fresh EGM-2 medium 12 h after transfection. The silencing effects of siRNAs were then confirmed by Western blotting. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as we described previously (22Tang H. Zhao Z.J. Landon E.J. Inagami T. J. Biol.

In addition, the cells in 24-well plates were trypsinized, and viable cells were counted with a Z1 cell counter (Beckman). Alternatively, HUVECs were first seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well, transfected with 20 nm siRNA duplexes, and grown in EGM-2 medium for 60 h. After transfection, HUVECs were trypsinized, and viable cells were replated into 96-well plates at 1.2 × 104 cells/well and grown in basal EBM-2 medium containing 0.1% FBS, EBM-2 containing 0.1% FBS and VEGF (100 ng/ml), or EGM-2 complete medium for an additional 72 h. The proliferation of the transfected cells was then assessed by CellTiter 96 AQueous one solution reagent (Promega). Cell Migration Assay—HUVEC migration was measured essentially by a modified Boyden chamber assay using 24-well plate Transwells (Corning, Lowell, MA) with an 8.0-μm pore size polycarbonate membrane as we described previously (23Tang H. Hao Q. Fitzgerald T. Sasaki T. Landon E.J. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5441-5447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Polycarbonate membranes of Transwell inserts were coated with or without a thin layer of growth factor reduced Matrigel (1:10 dilution) (BD Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. The inserts were placed over the lower chambers that have been filled with serum-free basal EBM-2 or EGM-2 complete medium. HUVECs were transfected with siRNAs and grown in EGM-2 medium for ∼90 h. The cells then were collected by trypsinization, washed, and resuspended in serum-free EBM-2 medium supplemented with 0.15% FBS. Viable cells (5 × 104) in 0.15 ml were added to the inside of each insert and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. HUVECs remaining on the upper side of the insert membrane were mechanically removed with cotton tips, and the filter membranes were fixed in methanol. Cells that had migrated to the under side of filters were stained with Giemsa stain (Sigma) and enumerated under a microscope at a final magnification of ×200. Five random microscopic fields were counted. Cell Adhesion and Spreading Assays—HUVECs were transfected with siRNAs and grown in EGM-2 medium for ∼90 h. The cells were collected by trypsinization, washed, and resuspended in serum-free EBM-2 medium supplemented with 0.15% FBS. The cells were then replated on fibronectin-coated 24-well plates, and the adhesion of cells to fibronectin and their spreading were measured as we described previously (23Tang H. Hao Q. Fitzgerald T. Sasaki T. Landon E.J. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5441-5447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy RNA isolation kit, and semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's protocols (Qiagen). RT-PCR primers were designed with the Oligo6 software (Molecular Biology Insights, Cascade, CO) as follows: VEGFR2 (expected product of 406 bp), 5′-GCG GTC AAC AAA GTC GG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTG CCA CAC GCT CTA GGA CTG-3′ (reverse); FGFR1 (418 bp), 5′-CTC TGA CAA GGG CAA CTA CAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGC TTC CAG AAC GGT CAA C-3′ (reverse); and internal control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-CGC TGA GTA CGT CGT GGA G-3′(forward) and 5′-GAG GAG TGG GTG TCG CTG TTG-3′ (reverse). Relative change in mRNA was measured by densitometric analysis and normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. In Vitro Angiogenesis Assay—The in vitro angiogenesis was determined by measuring the formation of capillary-like structures of ECs in growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences). HUVECs were transfected with siRNAs and grown in EGM-2 medium for ∼90 h. The cells were collected by trypsinization, washed, and resuspended in serum-free EBM-2 medium supplemented with 0.15% FBS. Viable cells were then replated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well on growth factor-reduced Matrigel (10 mg/ml)-coated 48-well plates and incubated at 37 °C in basal EBM-2 medium with 0.1% FBS, EBM-2 with 0.1% FBS and VEGF (100 ng/ml), or EGM-2 complete medium for 8–14 h as indicated. The formation of EC tube-like structures was viewed by phase-contrast microscopy, and random fields were photographed using a Nikon TS-100F microscope equipped with a DXM 1200 digital camera and fitted with a CFI plan achromat ×4 objective (Nikon Instruments, Lewisville, TX). ACT-1 software was used for image processing. PKD2 Is Expressed in Primary Human ECs from Different Tissues—We determined the expression level of PKD2 in five primary human ECs at passage 4. As shown in Fig. 1A (top panel), PKD1 (115 kDa) and PKD2 (105 kDa) were detected in Western blots of cell extracts prepared from all five of the primary human ECs from different tissues using a PKD1/2 (C-20) antibody that recognizes both PKD1 and PKD2 (13Sturany S. Van Lint J. Muller F. Wilda M. Hameister H. Hocker M. Brey A. Gern U. Vandenheede J. Gress T. Adler G. Seufferlein T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3310-3318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It appears that HUVECs and human lung microvascular EC expressed more PKD2 than PKD1, whereas artery ECs such as human coronary artery ECs and human aortic ECs had more PKD1 than PKD2. A single band corresponding to PKD2 molecular mass (105 kDa) was detected in the ECs when an antibody specifically against PKD2 was used (Fig. 1A, second panel). These findings indicate that PKD2 is expressed in a range of primary human ECs. In non-ECs, we found that WI-38 human lung fibroblasts predominantly expressed PKD1, whereas A549 human lung carcinoma cells expressed an abundant amount of PKD2, and H441 human lung adenocarcinoma cells mainly expressed PKD2 isoform (Fig. 1B). Activation of PKD2 by VEGF and PMA in HUVECs—There are no published studies of the activation of PKD2 in ECs, although the activation of PKD1 by VEGF has been reported in ECs (24Wong C. Jin Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33262-33269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The activation of PKD2 is believed to be mediated by an initial protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of two key serine residues in the activation loop followed by an autophosphorylation of Ser-876 in the enzyme (12Rozengurt E. Rey O. Waldron R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13205-13208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 13Sturany S. Van Lint J. Muller F. Wilda M. Hameister H. Hocker M. Brey A. Gern U. Vandenheede J. Gress T. Adler G. Seufferlein T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3310-3318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus it is feasible to monitor PKD2 activation using a phospho-specific antibody against Ser-876-phosphorylated PKD2 (13Sturany S. Van Lint J. Muller F. Wilda M. Hameister H. Hocker M. Brey A. Gern U. Vandenheede J. Gress T. Adler G. Seufferlein T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3310-3318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A (top panels), both VEGF and PMA activated PKD2 by inducing a strong autophosphorylation of PKD2 on Ser-876. Knockdown of PKD2 with validated human PKD2 siRNAs abolished the phosphorylation of PKD2 Ser-876 induced by VEGF and PMA in HUVECs, confirming the specificity of the phospho-specific antibody. In contrast, PKD1 silencing with a validated human PKD1 siRNA virtually did not affect the phosphorylation of PKD2 on Ser-876. Moreover, both VEGF and PMA induced a mobility shift of PKD2 in HUVECs, supporting the activation of PKD2 by these agonists (Fig. 2, second panels). Lastly, immunoprecipitation of PKD2 with a PKD2-specific antibody confirmed that PKD2 was activated and phosphorylated by VEGF in ECs (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these data demonstrate that PKD2 is activated by proangiogenic factors VEGF and PMA in ECs. PKD2 Is An Important PKD Isoform Mediating the Phosphorylation of PKD Substrates in HUVECs—It has been demonstrated that PKD family kinases preferentially phosphorylate substrates with a LXRXX(pS/T) consensus motif, where pS/T denotes the phospho-serine or -threonine (25Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). However, the identity of specific PKD2 substrates in cells is largely unknown. By using a phospho-Ser/Thr PKD substrate antibody that specifically recognizes the PKD consensus motif LXRXX(pS/T), we found that, in resting HUVECs, at least nine protein bands were detected by the PKD substrate antibody (Fig. 3, top panel under control). The phosphorylation of four proteins indicated with * (bands 4, 5, 7, and 9) was reduced by silencing PKD2 but not PKD1 in resting HUVECs. Interestingly, PKD2 silencing increased the phosphorylation of two proteins around 60 kDa indicated with ^ (bands 12 and 13). Remarkably, PMA, a direct activator of PKD family kinases, strongly induced the phosphorylation of at least 13 proteins detected by the PKD substrate antibody (Fig. 3, top panel under PMA). It should be noted that the PKD-mediated phosphorylation of 9 out of the 13 proteins (indicated by *) was markedly reduced by PKD2 silencing, especially for protein bands 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. Similar inhibitory effects were observed in HUVECs transfected with other two different PKD2 siRNAs (data not shown). However, only the phosphorylation of three proteins, bands 2, 3, and 15 (indicated by ·), was inhibited by PKD1 silencing and only slightly. Similarly, two other different PKD1 siRNAs had very minor effects on PKD-dependent protein phosphorylation induced by PMA (data not shown). Stimulation of HUVECs with VEGF also induced the phosphorylation of at least 14 proteins detected by the PKD substrate antibody (Fig. 3, top panel under VEGF), and the phosphorylation of protein band 5 (∼120 kDa) and protein bands 11 and 12 (∼60 kDa) induced by VEGF was higher than that induced by PMA. Again, PKD2 silencing markedly reduced the VEGF-induced phosphorylation of all the proteins except for protein band 14 in HUVECs. Furthermore, the VEGF-induced activation of ERK was abolished by PKD2 silencing in HUVECs (Fig. 3, second panel under VEGF). PKD2 knockdown also inhibited the ERK activation by PMA. The activation of ERK was determined using a phospho-ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody. In contrast, PKD1 silencing only slightly inhibited the VEGF-induced phosphorylation of two proteins, band 5 (∼120 kDa) and band 6 (∼110 kDa) in HUVECs. In addition, the signals of three proteins (bands 11, 12, and 14) seem to be increased by PKD1 silencing in VEGF-treated HUVECs. The knockdown of PKD2 or PKD1 was shown in Fig. 3, third and fourth panels, respectively. It should be noted that the phosphorylation of PKD1 and PKD2 interferes with their recognition by the PKD1/2 antibody, which is against a C-terminal epitope of PKD1/2 (13Sturany S. Van Lint J. Muller F. Wilda M. Hameister H. Hocker M. Brey A. Gern U. Vandenheede J. Gress T. Adler G. Seufferlein T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3310-3318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These novel findings indicate that PKD2 is an important PKD isoform mediating the phosphorylation of PKD substrates in HUVECs. PKD2, but Not PKD1 Isoform, Is Critical for EC Proliferation—We next utilized the loss of function approach by silencing PKD1 and PKD2 with specific siRNAs to determine their roles in EC morphology and proliferation. Because angiogenesis is mediated by a variety of factors, we studied the role of PKD2 in HUVECs cultured in EGM-2 complete growth medium instead of in medium containing single growth factor. EGM-2 complete growth medium contains FBS, multiple recombinant human growth factors including VEGF, FGF, IGF1, and epidermal growth factor, as well as hydrocortisone, heparin, and ascorbic acid. Fig. 4A shows that PKD1 or PKD2 was almost completely knocked down by its respective isoform-specific siRNA in HUVECs and that the knockdown of each isoform had only a minor effect on the expression of the other PKD isoforms. Interestingly, we found that silencing PKD2, but not PKD1, significantly slowed the rate at which HUVECs reach confluence. The PKD2-silenced ECs adhered well but grew slowly and spread more, thus appearing relatively large in size (Fig. 4B). In addition, we measured the histone-associated DNA fragments with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science) and found that PKD2 silencing did not induce apoptosis of HUVECs as compared with cells transfected with control siRNA or PKD1 siRNA (data not shown). These observations suggest that PKD2 may regulate EC proliferation. We next determined the role of PKD2 in EC proliferation using three different siRNAs that target different regions in PKD2 mRNA. Human PKD2 siRNA-1 (catalog number SI02224768) and PKD2 siRNA-2 (catalog number SI02224775) are validated siRNAs obtained from Qiagen. The human PKD2 siRNA-3 (catalog number 004197) was ON-TARGET plus SMARTpool duplexes containing a mixture of four SMARTs-election-predesigned siRNAs targeting PKD2 on different sequences and was"
https://openalex.org/W2081382588,"The CrCAX1 gene encoding a Ca2+/H+ and Na+/H+ exchanger was cloned and characterized from the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to begin to understand the mechanisms of cation homeostasis in this model organism. CrCAX1 was more closely related to fungal cation exchanger (CAX) genes than those from higher plants but has structural characteristics similar to plant Ca2+/H+ exchangers including a long N-terminal tail. When CrCAX1-GFP was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it localized at the vacuole. CrCAX1 could suppress the Ca2+-hypersensitive phenotype of a yeast mutant and mediated proton gradient-dependent Ca2+/H+ exchange activity in vacuolar membrane vesicles. Ca2+ transport activity was increased following N-terminal truncation of CrCAX1, suggesting the existence of an N-terminal auto-regulatory mechanism. CrCAX1 could also provide tolerance to Na+ stress when expressed in yeast or Arabidopsis thaliana because of Na+/H+ exchange activity. This Na+/H+ exchange activity was not regulated by the N terminus of the CrCAX1 protein. A subtle tolerance by CrCAX1 in yeast to Co2+ stress was also observed. CrCAX1 was transcriptionally regulated in Chlamydomonas cells grown in elevated Ca2+ or Na+. This study has thus uncovered a novel eukaryotic proton-coupled transporter, CrCAX1, that can transport both monovalent and divalent cations and that appears to play a role in cellular cation homeostasis by the transport of Ca2+ and Na+ into the vacuole.

This study has thus uncovered a novel eukaryotic proton-coupled transporter, CrCAX1, that can transport both monovalent and divalent cations and that appears to play a role in cellular cation homeostasis by the transport of Ca2+ and Na+ into the vacuole. Controlled ion homeostasis is critical to all organisms. This is certainly the case for alkali metals (Na+, K+) and alkaline earth metals (Ca2+, Mg2+) that play essential roles in many organisms but that must be carefully regulated with regard to their cellular concentrations to prevent osmotic and metal stress. For example, tightly controlled levels of Ca2+ play a critical role in cell signaling, but high concentrations of Ca2+ are very toxic to the cell (1McAinsh M.R. Pittman J.K. New Phytol. 2008; (in press)Google Scholar). Likewise a careful balance between K+ and Na+ ions is required to prevent osmotic stress and the toxic effects of Na+ (2Maser P. Gierth M. Schroeder J.I. Plant Soil. 2002; 247: 43-54Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 3Lang F. J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 2007; 26: 613S-623SCrossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In unicellular organisms particularly, failure of Ca2+ or Na+ homeostasis will lead to death of that organism; therefore the tight control of these ions is paramount. This is certainly the case for many of these organisms that exist in potentially harsh ionic conditions. For example, many of the unicellular green algae of the Chlamydomonas genus can tolerate and adapt to multiple ion stresses. The acidophile Chlamydomonas acidophila and the halotolerant Chlamydomonas sp. W80 can tolerate very severe ion stresses (4Spijkerman E. Barua D. Gerloff-Elias A. Kern J. Gaedke U. Heckathorn S.A. Extremophiles. 2007; 11: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Tanaka S. Suda Y. Ikeda K. Ono M. Miyasaka H. Watanabe M. Sasaki K. Hirata K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2007; 271: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The soil and freshwater living Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (herein referred to as Chlamydomonas), although not as tolerant to these stresses as the extremophile species, have adaptive mechanisms to many ion stress conditions (6Mendez-Alvarez S. Leisinger U. Eggen R.I. Int. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 15-22PubMed Google Scholar), either by direct removal of an ion through efflux or by mediating Ca2+-signaling processes. Some of the mechanisms of Na+ and Ca2+ homeostasis and transport are well understood in model eukaryotes such as yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In both species, ΔpH-dependent cation/H+ exchangers are important in mediating the removal of excess Na+ and Ca2+ from the cytosol across the plasma membrane or the vacuolar membrane (7Pardo J.M. Cubero B. Leidi E.O. Quintero F.J. J. Exp. Bot. 2006; 57: 1181-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Na+, K+, or Ca2+ transporting cation/H+ exchangers derive from at least four phylogenetic superfamilies. One of these is the CaCA (Ca2+/cation antiporter) superfamily, which includes mammalian Na+/Ca2+ exchanger genes and cation/H+ exchanger (CAX) 2The abbreviations used are: CAX, cation/H+ exchanger; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NHX, Na+/H+ exchanger; TAP, Tris-acetate-phosphate; TnT, transcribed and translated; RT, reverse transcription. genes (8Cai X.J.

Evol. 2006; 63: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). CAX genes have been identified in bacteria, fungi, protozoa, plants, and lower vertebrates but are absent from higher animals (9Shigaki T. Rees I. Nakhleh L. Hirschi K.D. J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 63: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The majority of the CAX genes characterized to date encode H+-coupled exchangers that transport Ca2+. Many are highly specific for Ca2+ such as the yeast and Arabidopsis vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchangers ScVCX1 and AtCAX1 (10Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 11Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), whereas others have a broader specificity and can transport a range of divalent cations (12Shigaki T. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6610-6617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). An interesting exception is the yeast CAX family transporter ScVNX1, which can transport Na+ and K+ but appears not to transport Ca2+ (13Cagnac O. Leterrier M. Yeager M. Blumwald E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24284-24293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A disparate feature of these transporters is the mechanism of regulation. Ca2+ transport by ScVCX1 is negatively regulated by the protein phosphatase calcineurin (10Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), whereas a post-translational mode of regulation involving an N-terminal domain has been demonstrated for plant CAX transporters. For example, when full-length AtCAX1 is heterologously expressed in yeast, it has no Ca2+/H+ exchange activity unless the N terminus of the protein is truncated (14Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Further analysis in yeast and plants confirmed that the N-terminal tail regulates AtCAX1 Ca2+ transport activity through an autoinhibitory mechanism (15Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Cheng N.H. Hirschi K.D.

Chlamydomonas is a model organism for studying photosynthesis and other aspects of cell biology and should be an excellent model to study adaptive responses to stress and the evolutionary relationships of cation transporters among eukaryotes. The recently sequenced Chlamydomonas genome has indicated the wide range of transporters present including members of the CaCA superfamily (21Merchant S.S. Prochnik S.E. Vallon O. Harris E.H.

Here we describe the first functional analysis of a cation/H+ exchanger from Chlamydomonas and demonstrate that it functions as a H+-coupled Ca2+ and Na+ transporter that provides a role in cation homeostasis. DNA Manipulations—CrCAX1 and N-terminally truncated CrCAX1 (sCrCAX1) cDNA was amplified by PCR from cDNA template derived from isolated Chlamydomonas RNA using primers CrCAX1F, CrCAX1R, and sCrCAX1F (see supplemental Table S1 for primer sequences). PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T vector for propagation and sequencing. CrCAX1 and sCrCAX1 cDNAs were subcloned into the XbaI and SacI sites of the yeast expression vector piHGpd and into a p35S-CAMBIA2300 plant kanamycin-resistant expression vector that had been modified to contain the CaMV 35S promoter sequence and nos terminator sequence. To identify the position of translation initiation, CrCAX1 cDNA constructs were generated that encode an N-terminal fragment. A CrCAX1 cDNA that encodes the first predicted 180 amino acids was amplified using primers CrCAX1TnTF and CrCAX1TnTR. A mutant variant was generated using the forward primer CrCAX1M1TnTF where the predicted Met1 was mutated to Ala so that translation would be predicted to initiate at Met91. The PCR products were subcloned into the XbaI and BamHI sites of pSP64 (Promega) for in vitro transcription-translation analysis. For comparison with AtCAX1, an AtCAX1 cDNA that encodes the first 67 amino acids was amplified using primers CAX1TnTF and CAX1aa67R. This PCR product was fused to a previously amplified rsGFP sequence containing a 5′ BglII site and 3′ SacI site (23Sunderland P.A. West C.E. Waterworth W.M. Bray C.M. Plant J. 2006; 47: 356-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The AtCAX1-67-GFP cDNA was subcloned into the PstI and SacI sites of pSP64. A mutant construct in which Met37 was substituted with Ala was generated using AtCAX1-67-GFP as template using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using primers CAX1M37AF and CAX1M37AR. To generate C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions to CrCAX1 and sCrCAX1, a HindIII site was introduced into the 3′ end of the cDNA using the primer CrCAX1HR in combination with CrCAX1F or sCrCAX1F. A GFP cDNA was amplified from a synthetic GFP (S65G, S72A) plasmid (24Primavesi L.F. Wu H.X. Mudd E.A. Day A. Jones H.D. Transgenic Res. 2008; 17: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and was cloned into the HindIII and SacI sites of CrCAX1- and sCrCAX1-pGEM-T. The CrCAX1-GFP and sCrCAX1-GFP constructs were then subcloned into piHGpd and p35S-CAMBIA2300. Cell and Plant Growth—C. reinhardtii wild type strain 137C+ (CC-125 or CCAP 11/32C) was obtained from the UK Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa (CCAP). The cells were grown in Tris-acetate-phosphate (TAP) liquid medium with agitation and on plates at 25 °C in 100 μmol of photons/m2 × s-1 light provided by fluorescent tubes. Cell growth was determined by measuring at A750 nm. The yeast (S. cerevisiae) strains K667 (cnb1::LEU2 pmc1::TRP1 vcx1Δ) (10Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), AXT3 (nhx1::TRP1 ena1-4::HIS3 nha1::LEU2) (25Quintero F.J. Blatt M.R. Pardo J.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and nhx1Δ::kanMX4 (Euroscarf) were used for heterologous expression. Transformed yeast strains were grown in synthetic defined medium minus appropriate amino acids for selective growth for the expression plasmid and the mutations. For metal tolerance assays, serial dilutions of K667 yeast were grown at 30 °C on solid yeast extract-peptone-dextrose medium containing a range of metal salts including CaCl2, NaCl, CoCl2, and CdCl2 for 4 days. For determination of AXT3 yeast growth rate in liquid NaCl solutions, yeast strains of the same starting cell density were inoculated in arginine-phosphate-dextrose medium containing 1 mm KCl and a range of NaCl concentrations and grown at 30 °C, shaking for 48 h in 24-well flat bottomed plates, and cell growth was determined by measuring at A600 nm. A. thaliana accession Col-0 was grown on soil or on solid 0.5× strength Murashige and Skoog medium at 22 °C in a 16 h/8 h light/dark cycle in 100 μmol of photons/m2 × s-1 light provided by fluorescent tubes. Total chlorophyll (chlorophyll a+b) measurements were determined as described (26Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4696) Google Scholar). DNA Transformations—Yeast strains were transformed with piHGpd plasmid constructs using the lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol method as described previously (27Pittman J.K. Cheng N.H. Shigaki T. Kunta M. Hirschi K.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 1104-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis was transformed with p35S-CAMBIA2300 plasmid constructs using the standard Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated floral dipping method. Following screening for kanamycin-resistant seeds, at least four homozygous lines were selected for each independent transformation with CrCAX1 and sCrCAX1. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis using a RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). RNA was isolated from yeast by acid phenol extraction. RNA was isolated from Chlamydomonas cells grown in liquid TAP medium supplemented with various metal salts. The cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in water, and lysed in a lysis solution containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, and 40 pg/ml proteinase K for 20 min at room temperature. RNA was purified from the lysed cells by four extractions with equal volumes of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol followed by two extractions of the aqueous phase with an equal volume of chloroform. RNA was precipitated in 2 volumes of 100% isopropanol, and the pellet was collected by centrifugation. First strand cDNA was produced from 1 μg of DNase-treated total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and an oligo(dT) primer. To determine CrCAX1 expression in transgenic Arabidopsis lines or yeast cells, RT-PCR was performed using sCrCAX1F and CrCAX1TnTR primers and actin or tubulin primers as a constitutive control. To determine relative CrCAX1 expression in metal-treated Chlamydomonas cells, RT-PCR was performed using CrCAX1TnTF and CrCAX1TnTR primers and 18 S rRNA primers as a constitutive control. PCR products were amplified with a 60 °C annealing temperature for 25 cycles and detected with ethidium bromide. In Vitro Transcription and Translation—CrCAX1-pSP64, CrCAX1-M1A-pSP64, AtCAX1-pSP64, and AtCAX1-M37A-pSP64 constructs were transcribed and translated (TnT) in vitro, in the presence of 35S-labeled Met, using a TnT-coupled wheat germ cell-free system (Promega). TnT reactions were separated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, dried, and analyzed using a BAS-1800 phosphorimaging device (Fuji Photo Film). Vacuolar Membrane Vesicle Isolation and Transport Measurements—Vacuolar-enriched membrane vesicles were isolated from K667 or nhx1Δ yeast cells expressing sCrCAX1 and CrCAX1, as described previously (27Pittman J.K. Cheng N.H. Shigaki T. Kunta M. Hirschi K.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 1104-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Ca2+/H+ exchange activity was determined by measuring pH gradient-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake into K667-derived vesicles, as described previously (28Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2648-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Na+/H+ exchange activity was determined in nhx1Δ-derived vesicles by measuring Na+-dependent acridine orange fluorescence quench, essentially as described in Ref. 29Apse M.P. Sottosanto J.B. Blumwald E. Plant J. 2003; 36: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar using a Jasco FP750 fluorescence spectrometer. GFP Visualization—Cells expressing CrCAX1-GFP, sCrCAX1-GFP, or GFP alone were imaged by epifluorescence microscopy using a Leica DMR microscope and an enhanced GFP filter cube (Chroma Technology). The fluorescent yeast vacuole marker stain carboxy-5- and 6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (30Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) was used to visualize yeast vacuoles and was detected using a L4 fluorescein isothiocyanate filter cube (Leica Microsystems). Identification of a CAX Gene from C. reinhardtii—Analysis of sequence from Chlamydomonas expressed sequence tag cDNA clones and the completed genome sequence has identified the presence of open reading frames homologous to Arabidopsis and S. cerevisiae CAX genes. One of these annotated open reading frames designated CrCAX1 (JGI I.D. 157233) was analyzed further by comparison with known CAX genes. Following DNA and amino acid sequence alignment, the accuracy of the sequence prediction was ascertained. PCR primers were designed to amplify the predicted CrCAX1 cDNA from C. reinhardtii 137C+ (wild type) RNA isolated from cells grown in liquid TAP medium. CrCAX1 (accession number FM253128) has a 1344-bp open reading frame and encodes a protein of 447 amino acids. Sequence comparisons of CrCAX1 found highest sequence identity with fungal and protozoan CAX genes (40% sequence identity with PbCAX1 from Plasmodium berghei, 35% identity with ScVCX1, and 30% identity with AtCAX1; supplemental Table S2). However, sequence alignment and transmembrane span prediction comparison of CrCAX1 with CAX genes from fungi and higher plants indicated that CrCAX1 encodes a protein with similar topology to higher plant CAX transporters including a long hydrophilic tail predicted to be cytosolic and 11 predicted transmembrane spans (supplemental Fig. S1). The CrCAX1 hydrophilic N-terminal tail sequence is longer (94 amino acids) than that of ScVCX1 (32 amino acids) and AtCAX1 (67 amino acids). Detailed phylogenetic analysis was recently performed using 138 CAX gene sequences that were previously cloned or identified from genome sequences of bacteria, fungi, plants, protozoa, and lower vertebrates (9Shigaki T. Rees I. Nakhleh L. Hirschi K.D. J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 63: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This analysis indicated that CAX genes could be separated into three main phylogenetic groups (Type I, Type II, and Type III). Arabidopsis and S. cerevisiae CAX genes formed part of the Type I group, which was further divided into subtypes (Type I-A to Type I-H). Phylogenetic analysis performed with the CrCAX1 sequence and using the classification of Shigaki et al. (9Shigaki T. Rees I. Nakhleh L. Hirschi K.D. J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 63: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) indicates that CrCAX1 falls within clade Type I-C, which includes CAX genes from protozoa, including Plasmodium falciparum and Cryptosporidium hominis, the red algae Thalassiosira pseudonana (Fig. 1), and the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum (data not shown). In Vitro Translation Analysis of CrCAX1—To confirm that translation of CrCAX1 did initiate from the predicted first AUG start codon (Met1) rather than the downstream AUG (Met91), an in vitro cell-free transcription and translation experiment was performed. For comparison translation analysis was performed using the previously characterized AtCAX1. To improve translation efficiency, partial length constructs were used that encode the first 180 amino acids of CrCAX1 and the first 67 amino acids of AtCAX1. A single 35S-labeled protein band of the expected size was identified for CrCAX1, confirming that translation occurred solely from Met1 (Fig. 2A), unlike for AtCAX1 where some translation (16% of total AtCAX1 protein) initiated from the second AUG (Met37) (Fig. 2B). Analysis of an AtCAX1-M37A mutant confirmed that the lower protein band was due to initiation from Met37. When CrCAX1 Met1 was mutated to Ala, translation was able to initiate from Met91, and a smaller protein product was observed (Fig. 2A). Functional Analysis of CrCAX1 in S. cerevisiae—To assess the transport function of CrCAX1, a yeast heterologous expression approach was used. This has been extremely successful previously to ascertain the function of higher plant cation/H+ exchangers (11Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 14Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31Kamiya T. Akahori T. Maeshima M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2005; 46: 1735-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The K667 yeast mutant lacks vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchange and Ca2+-ATPase activity and is therefore unable to sufficiently sequester Ca2+ into the vacuole in response to Ca2+ stress and cannot grow on high Ca2+ containing media (10Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Many plant CAX transporters including AtCAX1 possess an N-terminal regulatory domain that inhibits Ca2+ transport activity when expressed in a heterologous system (14Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); therefore for comparison an N-terminal truncation mutant of CrCAX1 (termed sCrCAX1) was generated in which translation was initiated from the first downstream AUG, which encodes Met91 immediately prior to the first predicted transmembrane span (supplemental Fig. S1). C-terminally tagged CrCAX1-GFP and sCrCAX1-GFP constructs were also generated and expressed in yeast. Both CrCAX1-GFP and sCrCAX1-GFP localized equivalently to the vacuole (Fig. 3). As predicted transmembrane proteins, CrCAX1 and sCrCAX1 are likely to be located at the vacuolar membrane, although imaging by epifluorescence microscopy was unable to unequivocally confirm this. Comparison of CrCAX1 and sCrCAX1 in yeast grown on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose medium supplemented with a high concentration (200 mm) of CaCl2 found that sCrCAX1 could efficiently suppress the Ca2+ hypersensitivity of K667 yeast in a manner equivalent to N-terminally truncated AtCAX1 (sAtCAX1) (Fig. 4A). Full-length CrCAX1 could only weakly suppress the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype. Transformed K667 yeast growth was evaluated on other metal conditions. CrCAX1 or sCrCAX1 could not suppress sensitivity to Mn2+ or Zn2+ but could provide some Cd2+ tolerance to yeast (data not shown). Growth of yeast on 0.75 m NaCl was significantly enhanced following expression of either CrCAX1 or sCrCAX1, but there was no difference between full-length and truncated CrCAX1 in the ability to provide Na+ tolerance (Fig. 4A). Likewise, slight tolerance to 2.5 mm CoCl2 was observed by expression of either CrCAX1 or sCrCAX1. sAtCAX1 was unable to provide tolerance to either Na+ or Co2+ stress, indicating that tolerance was not linked to altered Ca2+ homeostasis. The Ca2+ and Na+ tolerance by CrCAX1 and sCrCAX1 was clearly due to their expression in the yeast (Fig. 4B). To confirm the Na+ tolerance phenotype of CrCAX1, plasmids were transformed into AXT3 yeast, which lacks plasma membrane and endomembrane Na+ transporters and is hypersensitive to Na+ (25Quintero F.J. Blatt M.R. Pardo J.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Transformed AXT3 yeast strains were grown in liquid arginine-phosphate-dextrose medium supplemented with various concentrations of NaCl, and cell growth was measured. Both sCrCAX1 and CrCAX1 could provide AXT3 yeast with significant tolerance to high concentrations of NaCl, whereas AXT3 expressing empty vector or sAtCAX1 was unable to grow on this salt medium (Fig. 4C). Ca2+/H+ Exchange Activity of CrCAX1—To confirm that growth of yeast on Ca2+-containing medium was due to enhanced vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchange activity, ΔpH-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake in the presence of the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor vanadate was measured in tonoplast-enriched membrane vesicles isolated from K667 yeast expressing sCrCAX1. Ca2+/H+ exchange activity was determined for sCrCAX1, and this 45Ca2+ uptake was significantly inhibited in the presence of 5 μm of protonophore FCCP (Fig. 5A). In contrast, Ca2+/H+ exchange activity mediated by full-length CrCAX1 was significantly reduced (by 78%) but was detectable over basal levels (Fig. 5B). A competition 45Ca2+ uptake assay was performed to assess the substrate specificity of sCrCAX1. A 10-fold excess concentration of nonradioactive Ca2+ and Cd2+ could significantly inhibit 10 μm 45Ca2+ uptake (Fig. 5C). A 10-fold excess of Na+ (as 0.1 mm NaCl), in addition to 0.1 mm NaN3 present in the uptake buffer, making the total Na+ concentration 0.2 mm, could inhibit ∼60% of 45Ca2+ uptake, whereas Ca2+ and Cd2+ could inhibit ∼85-95% of uptake. A 10-fold excess of Co2+ could only marginally inhibit sCrCAX1 45Ca2+ uptake. Expression of CrCAX1 in Arabidopsis—CrCAX1 and sCrCAX1 were expressed highly under the control of the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter in wild type Arabidopsis Col-0 (Fig. 6B) to assess the impact that this cation transporter had to higher plant stress tolerance. CrCAX1- or sCrCAX1-expressing plants had no obvious alteration in morphology in nonstressed conditions. No phenotypic changes were observed between empty vector control and CAX-expressing lines under most ion stress conditions tested, except when grown under salt stress conditions. Multiple CrCAX1 and sCrCAX1 lines were able to provide significant tolerance when seedlings were germinated and grown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium containing 100 mm NaCl, as observed by enhanced growth and increased chlorophyll content compared with the vector control lines (Fig. 6, A and C). No significant difference was observed between the CrCAX1 and sCrCAX1 lines. Na+/H+ Exchange Activity of CrCAX1—The salt tolerance phenotype of yeast and Arabidopsis seedlings expressing CrCAX1, coupled with the ability of Na+ to inhibit Ca2+/H+ exchange activity, suggested that Na+ may also be a substrate for transport. Na+/H+ exchange activity was assessed in vacuolar-enriched membrane vesicles isolated from nhx1Δ yeast lacking the endogenous endomembrane Na+/H+ exchanger NHX1 and expressing sCrCAX1 and CrCAX1. Na+-dependent H+ flux was determined by the fluorescence quenching of acridine orange. After H+ pumping into the vesicles was initiated by the addition of Mg2+-ATP, fluorescence quenching was observed until a steady-state pH gradient was obtained. The addition of 5 μm of the protonophore FCCP or 0.1% Triton X-100 completely abolished the pH gradient (data not shown). In the vector control vesicles from nhx1Δ yeast, basal levels of quench recovery were observed following Na+ addition, presumably because of the remaining endogenous Na+/H+ exchange activity (Fig. 7). Significant quench recovery following the addition of 50 mm NaCl was observed in yeast expressing CrCAX1 and sCrCAX1 (Fig. 7). No significant K+/H+ or Li+/H+ exchange activity was observed. In the K667 yeast background lacking the Ca2+/H+ exchanger ScVCX1 but with the endogenous Na+/H+ exchanger ScNHX1 still present, significant background Na+/H+ exchange activity was measured, although the expression of CrCAX1 did slightly enhance Na+/H+ exchange activity (data not shown). Transcriptional Regulation of CrCAX1 by Metal Stress Conditions—Chlamydomonas cells were grown in TAP medium supplemented with various metal salts, and CrCAX1 mRNA transcript expression was determined following 16 h of treatment by RT-PCR. CrCAX1 expression was not enhanced by any metal treatment tested (data not shown). Following treatment with a range of CaCl2 concentrati"
https://openalex.org/W2047184421,"Classic tissue engineering paradigms are limited by the incorporation of a functional vasculature and a reliable means for reimplantation into the host circulation. We have developed a novel approach to overcome these obstacles using autologous explanted microcirculatory beds (EMBs) as bioscaffolds for engineering complex three-dimensional constructs. In this study, EMBs consisting of an afferent artery, capillary beds, efferent vein, and surrounding parenchymal tissue are explanted and maintained for 24 h ex vivo in a bioreactor that preserves EMB viability and function. Given the rapidly advancing field of stem cell biology, EMBs were subsequently seeded with three distinct stem cell populations, multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs), and bone marrow and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We demonstrate MAPCs, as well as MSCs, are able to egress from the microcirculation into the parenchymal space, forming proliferative clusters. Likewise, human adipose tissue-derived MSCs were also found to egress from the vasculature and seed into the EMBs, suggesting feasibility of this technology for clinical applications. We further demonstrate that MSCs can be transfected to express a luciferase protein and continue to remain viable and maintain luciferase expression in vivo. By using the vascular network of EMBs, EMBs can be perfused ex vivo and seeded with stem cells, which can potentially be directed to differentiate into neo-organs or transfected to replace failing organs and deficient proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2068278450,"Chlamydiales and Rickettsiales as metabolically impaired, intracellular pathogenic bacteria essentially rely on ""energy parasitism"" by the help of nucleotide transporters (NTTs). Also in plant plastids NTT-type carriers catalyze ATP/ADP exchange to fuel metabolic processes. The uptake of ATP4-, followed by energy consumption and the release of ADP3-, would lead to a metabolically disadvantageous accumulation of negative charges in form of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in the bacterium or organelle if no interacting Pi export system exists. We identified that Pi is a third substrate of several NTT-type ATP/ADP transporters. During adenine nucleotide hetero-exchange, Pi is cotransported with ADP in a one-to-one stoichiometry. Additionally, Pi can be transported in exchange with solely Pi. This Pi homo-exchange depends on the presence of ADP and provides a first indication for only one binding center involved in import and export. Furthermore, analyses of mutant proteins revealed that Pi interacts with the same amino acid residue as the gamma-phosphate of ATP. Import of ATP in exchange with ADP plus Pi is obviously an efficient way to couple energy provision with the export of the two metabolic products (ADP plus Pi) and to maintain cellular phosphate homeostasis in intracellular living ""energy parasites"" and plant plastids. The additional Pi transport capacity of NTT-type ATP/ADP transporters makes the existence of an interacting Pi exporter dispensable and might explain why a corresponding protein so far has not been identified."
https://openalex.org/W2071675755,"In contextual memories, an association between a positive or negative reinforcement and the contextual cues where the reinforcement occurs is formed. The re-exposure to the context without reinforcement can lead to memory extinction or reconsolidation, depending on the number of events or duration of a single event of context re-exposure. Extinction involves the temporary waning of the previously acquired conditioned response. The molecular processes underlying extinction and the mechanisms which determine if memory will reconsolidate or extinguish after retrieval are not well characterized, particularly the role of transcription factors and gene expression. Here we studied the participation of a transcription factor, NF-kappaB, in memory extinction. In the crab context-signal memory, the activation of NF-kappaB plays a critical role in consolidation and reconsolidation, memory processes that are well characterized in this model. The administration of a NF-kappaB inhibitor, sulfasalazine prior to extinction session impeded spontaneous recovery. Moreover, reinstatement experiments showed that the original memory was not affected and that NF-kappaB inhibition by sulfasalazine impaired spontaneous recovery strengthening the ongoing memory extinction process. Interestingly, in animals with fully consolidated memory, a brief re-exposure to the training context induced neuronal NF-kappaB activation and reconsolidation, while prolonged re-exposure induced NF-kappaB inhibition and memory extinction. These data constitutes a novel insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch between memory reconsolidation and extinction. Moreover, we propose the inhibition of NF-kappaB as the engaged mechanism underlying extinction, supporting a novel approach for the pharmacological enhancement of this memory process. The accurate description of the molecular mechanisms that support memory extinction is potentially useful for developing new strategies and drug candidates for therapeutic treatments of the maladaptive memory disorders such as post-traumatic stress, phobias, and drug addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2002821211,"Male gyro (Gy) mice, which have an X chromosomal deletion inactivating the SpmS and Phex genes, were found to be profoundly hearing impaired. This defect was due to alteration in polyamine content due to the absence of spermine synthase, the product of the SpmS gene. It was reversed by breeding the Gy strain with CAG/SpmS mice, a transgenic line that ubiquitously expresses spermine synthase under the control of a composite cytomegalovirus-IE enhancer/chicken β-actin promoter. There was an almost complete loss of the endocochlear potential in the Gy mice, which parallels the hearing deficiency, and this was also reversed by the production of spermine from the spermine synthase transgene. Gy mice showed a striking toxic response to treatment with the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). Within 2–3 days of exposure to DFMO in the drinking water, the Gy mice suffered a catastrophic loss of motor function resulting in death within 5 days. This effect was due to an inability to maintain normal balance and was also prevented by the transgenic expression of spermine synthase. DFMO treatment of control mice or Gy-CAG/SpmS had no effect on balance. The loss of balance in Gy mice treated with DFMO was due to inhibition of polyamine synthesis because it was prevented by administration of putrescine. Our results are consistent with a critical role for polyamines in regulation of Kir channels that maintain the endocochlear potential and emphasize the importance of normal spermidine:spermine ratio in the hearing and balance functions of the inner ear.

Polyamines are essential for viability in mammals. Knockouts of the genes for ornithine decarboxylase and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, which are enzymes needed for the synthesis of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, are lethal at early stages of embryonic development (1Pendeville H.

There is convincing evidence that the formation of hypusine in eIF5A, which requires spermidine as a precursor, is essential for eukaryotes (3Park M.H. J. Biochem.

Gene (Amst.). 1998; 210: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells in culture also grow normally in the presence of inhibitors of spermine synthase (5Pegg A.E. Coward J.K.

Inactivation of both of the genes that were originally described as encoding spermine synthases in plants leads to profound developmental defects (9Imai A. Akiyama T. Kato T. Sato S. Tabata S.

Romer P. Sumper M. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3081-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In contrast, spermine is clearly required for normal development in mammals. The rare human Snyder-Robinson syndrome is caused by mutations in SpmS located in the X chromosome that drastically reduces the amount of spermine synthase (13Cason A.L. Ikeguchi Y. Skinner C.

Such Gy mice suffer from hypophosphatemia, have a greatly reduced size, sterility, and neurological abnormalities, and have a short life span (6Mackintosh C.A. Pegg A.E. Biochem.

Biol. Chem. 2004; 49: 51370-51375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The original characterization of Gy mice also reported preliminary indications that these mice had hearing defects lacking the Preyer reflex (21Barkway C. Glenn N. Harvey D. Moorjani P.A. Palmer A.R.

This is of particular interest in the context of polyamine metabolism because a drug, α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO, Eflornithine), that targets ornithine decarboxylase has been shown to cause occasional hearing loss in some patients (23Horn Y.

Although DFMO was ineffective for cancer treatment, it is an extremely promising agent for cancer chemoprevention (27Meyskens, F. L., Jr., McLaren, C.

When combined with sulindac, DFMO treatment produced a substantial reduction in the recurrence of colorectal adenomas in a large clinical trial (27Meyskens, F. L., Jr., McLaren, C. E., Pelot, D., Fujikawa-Brooks, S., Carpenter, P. M., Hawk, E., Kelloff, G., Lawson, M. J., Kidao, J., McCracken, J., Albers, C. G., Ahnen, D. J., Turgeon, D.

DFMO is a major drug for the treatment of African sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma brucei (29Priotto G. Pinoges L. Fursa I.B. Burke B. Nicolay N. Grillet G. Hewison C. Balasegaram M.

It is also used as a topically applied cream for treatment of unwanted facial hair in women (31Hamzavi I. Tan E. Shapiro J. Lui H. J. Am. Acad.

DFMO is generally well tolerated even at high doses, but reversible hearing loss has been reported in multiple clinical trials (25Meyskens Jr., F.L. Gerner E.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 945-951PubMed Google Scholar, 33Abeloff M.D. Rosen S.T. Luk G.D. Baylin S.B. Zeltzman M. Sjoerdsma A. Cancer Treat.

Ototoxicity has been demonstrated to occur in experimental animals treated with DFMO including rats (35Brock M. Henley C.M. Hear.

Laryngoscope. 2004; 114: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and mice (38Nie L. Feng W. Diaz R. Gratton M.A. Doyle K.J. Yamoah E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15097-15102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Using immunohistochemistry, a high level of ornithine decarboxylase was observed in the inner ear of the rat, with the highest in the organ of Corti and lateral wall followed by the cochlear nerve (39Henley C.M. Salzer T.A. Coker N.J. Smith G. Haddox M.K. Hear. Res. 1995; 84: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Measurements of polyamines in the relevant structures are very difficult due to the small amount of tissue available, but as expected, DFMO treatment reduced polyamine levels and ornithine decarboxylase activity in the inner ear of the guinea pig (36Marks S.C. Mattox D.E. Casero R.A. Hear. Res. 1991; 53: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A plausible explanation for the importance of polyamines in auditory physiology is based on their well documented role as regulators of potassium channels (38Nie L. Feng W. Diaz R. Gratton M.A. Doyle K.J. Yamoah E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15097-15102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The inward rectification of Kir channels is caused by blockage of the outward current by polyamines (40Lopatin A.N. Lopatin N.M.E. Nichols C.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 41John S.A. Xie L.H. Weiss J.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 42Kurata H.T. Marton L.J. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Studies of the cloned mouse cochlear lateral wall-specific Kir4.1 channel showed that inward rectification was reduced and that there was a marked reduction in endocochlear potential (EP). It was proposed that DFMO treatment increases the outward Kir4.1 current, resulting in a drop in EP (38Nie L. Feng W. Diaz R. Gratton M.A. Doyle K.J. Yamoah E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15097-15102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the experiments reported here, we have studied in more detail the role of polyamines in auditory physiology using Gy mice and crosses of these mice with transgenic CAG/SpmS mice (43Ikeguchi Y. Wang X. McCloskey D.E. Coleman C.S. Nelson P. Hu G. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These mice express spermine synthase under the control of a composite cytomegalovirus-IE enhancer/chicken β-actin promoter, which was designed to provide ubiquitous expression (44Okabe M. Ikawa M. Kominami K. Nakanishi T. Nishimune Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar, 45Sawicki J.A. Morris R.J. Monks B. Sakai K. Miyazaki J.-I. Exp.

Dev. 1999; 54: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Assays of the spermine synthase activity in CAG/SpmS line 8 confirmed that there was a high level of expression of the transgene in many different organs and that this level was maintained for at least 1 year (43Ikeguchi Y. Wang X. McCloskey D.E. Coleman C.S. Nelson P. Hu G. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our studies confirm that Gy mice are totally deaf and that this condition is reversed by the expression of the SpmS gene. These changes are due to a virtually complete loss of the EP in the Gy mice. We have also examined the effect of DFMO on the Gy mice. Unexpectedly, it was found that these mice show a rapid and profound toxicity to this drug, leading to death within a few days. Within 5 days of exposure to DFMO in the drinking water, the DFMO-treated mice suffered a catastrophic loss of balance due to inner ear effects. This toxicity was also prevented by the transgenic expression of spermine synthase in the Gy background. All chemicals, unless noted, were purchased from Sigma. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides used as primers were synthesized in the Macromolecular Core Facility, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. Polyamine content was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography using an ion-pair reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography separation method with post-column derivatization using o-phthalaldehyde (47Seiler N. Knödgen B. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 339: 45-57Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Heterozygous Gy mice were a kind gift from Dr. R. A. Meyer, Jr., of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Carolinas Medical Center, Charlotte, NC. Further animals were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). XGy females were bred with B6C3H males from The Jackson Laboratory. Female offspring were retained, and the heterozygous females required for breeding were distinguished from homozygous wild type females by phosphate analyses of blood plasma (18Lyon, M. F., Scriver, C. R., Baker, L. R., Tenenhouse, H. S., Kronick, J., and Mandla, S. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 4899–4903Google Scholar, 43Ikeguchi Y. Wang X. McCloskey D.E. Coleman C.S. Nelson P. Hu G. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The Gy males resulting from the breeding of these mice were identified by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from the tails as described previously (43Ikeguchi Y. Wang X. McCloskey D.E. Coleman C.S. Nelson P. Hu G. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The CAG/SpmS mice were generated by DNA microinjection of fertilized B6D2F2 oocytes using a 3.5-kb fragment released by SalI and BamHI digestion from plasmid pCAG-hSpmSyn, which was constructed by replacing the insert encoding green fluorescent protein in plasmid pCX-EGFP with the human spermine synthase cDNA (43Ikeguchi Y. Wang X. McCloskey D.E. Coleman C.S. Nelson P. Hu G. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from the tails and subjected to PCR analysis to identify mice bearing the transgene. For identification of the CAG/SpmS, the 5′ sense primer used was 5′-TTCGGCTTCTGGCGTGTGAC-3′, which corresponds to a sequence in the actin promoter region, and the 3′ antisense primer was 5′-CCAGTACTGTCCTGACTC-3′, which corresponds to nucleotides 300–317 in the spermine synthase coding sequence. A 440-bp fragment was produced from the transgene. Plasma level of phosphate was measured by a colorimetric assay. The blood from a retro-orbital bleed was collected in heparinized microcentrifuge tubes and spun at 14,000 rpm (15,000 × g) for 15 min, and then plasma was prepared for analysis. 1.35 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to the microcentrifuge tubes along with 20 μl of plasma, and then samples were vortexed and spun at 14,000 rpm (15,000× g) for 10 min. 1 ml of supernatant was placed into a clean glass tube, diluted with 2 ml of a solution containing 2% ascorbic acid, 0.5% ammonium molybdate, and 1.2 n H2SO4, and vortexed. Samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 90 min and cooled to room temperature for 10 min, and absorbance was measured on a spectrophotometer at 820 nm. Gross Assessment—We assessed the ear twitch response of mice with a hand clap (Preyer reflex) to grossly assess the hearing functions. To obtain a gross assessment of the vestibular function of mice, we performed a balance test (48Casimiro M.C. Knollmann B.C. Yamoah E.N. Nie L. Vary Jr., J.C. Sirenko S.G. Greene A.E. Grinberg A.

Balance was tested by placing mice on a soft fabric-covered horizontal cylinder (∼7 cm in diameter) and positioned 10 cm above a foam pad. The cylinder was connected to a variable speed motor that runs from 0 to 15 rpm. The ability of each animal to balance on both the stationary cylinder and the rotating cylinder was scored as balanced index (49Dou H. Vazquez A.E. Namkung Y. Chu H. Cardell E.L. Nie L. Parson S. Shin H.S. Yamoah E.N. J. Assoc. Res. Otolaryngol. 2004; 5: 215-226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Auditory Brainstem Responses—Mice were anesthetized with Avertin, and auditory brainstem response measurements were recorded as described previously (50Flagella M. Clarke L.L. Miller M.L. Erway L.C. Giannella R.A. Andringa A. Gawenis L.R. Kramer J. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Lorenz J.N. Yamoah E.N. Cardell E.L. Shull G.E. J. Biol.

Briefly, a ground needle electrode and recording needle were placed subcutaneously in the scalp, and then a calibrated electrostatic speaker coupled to a hollow ear bar was placed inside the pinna. Broadband clicks and pure tones (8, 16, and 32 kHz) were presented in the ear of the animal in 10-dB increments, starting from 0 dB of SPL and ending at 100 dB of SPL. The auditory brainstem response sweeps were computer-averaged (time-locked with onset of 128–1024 stimuli, at 20/s) out of the continuous electroencephalographic activity. The threshold of hearing was determined as the lowest intensity of sound required to elicit a characteristic waveform. Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE)—Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (95 mg/kg) and xylazine (4 mg/kg). The f1 and f2 primary tones, which were generated by a two-channel frequency synthesizer (Hewlett Packard 3326A), were presented over two tweeters (Realistic) and delivered through a small soft rubber probe tip. Ear canal sound pressure was measured with a commercial acoustic probe (Etymotic Research 10B+). The ear canal sound pressure was sampled and synchronously averaged (n = 8) by a digital signal processor for frequencies <20.1 kHz and by a dynamic signal analyzer (Hewlett Packard 3561A) for frequencies >20.1 kHz. Distortion products were collected over a range of geometric mean frequencies between 5.6 and 48.5 kHz (f2 = 6.3–54.2 kHz) in 0.5-octave intervals at stimulus levels of L1 = L2 = 65 dB of SPL with f2/f1 = 1.25. Endocochlear Potential Measurement—The EP was measured as described briefly (38Nie L. Feng W. Diaz R. Gratton M.A. Doyle K.J. Yamoah E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15097-15102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The mice were anesthetized with 20% urethane (0.01 ml/g). A tracheal cannula was inserted, and the bulla was opened using a retroauricular approach. A small hole was made in the bony wall of the cochlea over the basal turn. A glass micropipette electrode filled with 150 mm KCl was advanced through the hole while secured to a hand-controlled micromanipulator. The electrode was connected to a high impedance direct current amplifier. The reference electrode (silver/silver chloride pellet) was placed under the dorsal skin. The recording electrode passed through the spiral ligament of the lateral wall into the scala media. The potential difference (mV) between the scala media and the reference electrode was recorded. Light Microscopic Cochlear Morphology—Animals were anesthetized (Avertin, (2,2,2-tribromethanol), 300 μg/g of body weight, intraperitoneally) and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (5 ml, 23 °C) followed by a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (10 ml, pH 7.4, 23 °C). The temporal bones were removed and opened to expose the otic capsule. The stapes was removed, and a perforation was made in the round window, following which fixative was perfused through the oval window. The bulla was then immersed in fixative (12 h, 4 °C), rinsed with phosphate buffer, postfixed (1% OsO4 in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, 30 min), and decalcified (80 ml, 120 mm, disodium EDTA, 23 °C). The cochleae were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanols and propylene oxide prior to infiltration and were embedded in plastic resin (EmBed 812, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). After polymerization (12 h, 58 °C), the cochlea was bisected in the mid-modiolar plane. The half-cochlea were re-embedded and completely polymerized (18 h, 58 °C). Semi-thick sections (1 μm) in the mid-modiolar were cut and stained with toluidine blue for light microscopic examination. Images were captured using an Olympus BH-2 microscope fitted with a SPOT RT-KE CCD camera and image analysis software (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Final figures were assembled using Adobe PhotoShop and Illustrator software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). XGy carrier females were bred with transgenic male CAG/SpmS mice from CAG/SpmS line 8 (43Ikeguchi Y. Wang X. McCloskey D.E. Coleman C.S. Nelson P. Hu G. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the male offspring (control, Gy, SPS, and SPS/Gy) were tested for hearing and cochlear function. As shown in Fig. 1, no response was seen in the Gy mice at any frequency tested. The hearing defect was completely reversed by the transgenic expression of spermine synthase. The control, SPS, and SPS/Gy groups showed identical responses (Fig. 1). Similarly, DPOAE testing showed no difference between the response of Gy mice and the noise floor, whereas the SPS and SPS/Gy groups showed a similar response to the controls (Fig. 2). These results confirm and extend the preliminary abstracts, stating that there was an absence of the Preyer reflex in Gy mice (21Barkway C. Glenn N. Harvey D. Moorjani P.A. Palmer A.R. Stabler S.

Mean distortion products for 7–8-week-old control (wild type, n = 21), Gy (n = 7), SPS (n = 7), and SPS/Gy mice were tested measuring the levels of the 2 f1 – f2 DPOAE over a geometric-mean frequency range from 5.6 to 48.5 kHz, using an f2/f1 of 1.25 and primary tone stimuli at L1 = L2 = 65 SPL. Clearly, Gy mice yielded no significant DPOAEs at low-to-high frequencies (5.6–45 kHz) when compared with controls, SPS, and SPS/Gy mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) There was an almost complete loss of the EP in the Gy mice, which parallels the hearing deficiency (Fig. 3). The loss of EP was also abolished by the provision of transgenic spermine synthase in the SPS/Gy mice. The cochlear tissues of the SPS and SPS/Gy mice appear normal with the exception of an increased width of the stria vascularis (Fig. 4, A–C). Examination of the stria at higher magnification indicated normal basal cells as well as marginal cell bodies, suggesting that the increased width was due to the increased area of the intermediate cells and the interdigitations of the intermed"

Cancer cells undergo either growth arrest or apoptosis with restoration of wild-type p53 function in vitro and in vivo (6Ventura A. Kirsch D.G. McLaughlin M.E. Tuveson D.A. Grimm J. Lintault L.

These studies have prioritized further understanding of p53 signaling and regulation that would have major impact in cancer drug development. It is yet to be resolved how functional restoration of p53 culminates to growth arrest/senescence in some cells and apoptosis in others. Is it driven by the level of p53 expression, modulating partner proteins or its upstream regulators? Among the large number of p53-binding proteins that influence its activities, ARF and HDM2 have been demonstrated as its major regulators. HDM2 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase) is transcriptionally activated by p53 and acts to degrade p53 in turn; thus, executing a negative feedback loop on p53 activity. ARF has been shown to bind and inhibit HDM2 activity resulting in the activation of p53 pathway (9Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Yarbrough W.G. Cell. 1998; 92: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). CARF (Collaborator of ARF) protein was initially cloned as an ARF-binding protein by yeast two-hybrid screening and was shown to activate ARF-dependent and -independent p53 functions (10Hasan M.K.

CARF interacts not only with ARF but also with p53 and HDM2, and thereby executes a new feedback loop in p53 pathway: CARF activates p53 → activates HDM2 → degrades CARF and p53. CARF also regulates HDM2 by its transcriptional repressor function (10Hasan M.K. Yaguchi T. Minoda Y. Hirano T. Taira K. Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Biochem.

Ageing Dev. 2008; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that CARF is vital for senescence of normal human fibroblasts. Whereas the overexpression of CARF induces premature senescence, its suppression leads to genomic instability and apoptosis. Construction of Retroviral Expression Vectors—For construction of retrovirus-driven expression of CARF-Myc, pCX4neo (provided by Dr. Tsuyoshi Akagi, Osaka, Japan) was used. cDNA-encoding Myc-tagged CARF protein was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the vector. For pCX4neo-CARF-GFP construction, CARF cDNA was first cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI site of the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech), and then CARF-GFP fragment was isolated by EcoRI-NotI digestion and subcloned into the EcoRI-NotI site of the pCX4neo vector. Cell Culture—Cells (HeLa, U2OS, TIG-1, MRC5 and the multicolor MDA-MB-435 cells stably expressing GFP-Aurora A kinase, DsRed-Dimportin α2, and CFP-histone H3 as markers for the centrosomes/mitotic spindles, nuclear membrane, and the nucleus/chromosomes, respectively) were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 5 mg/ml streptomycin. U2OS cells with Zn-inducible CARF expression were prepared as described earlier (11Hasan M.K. Yaguchi T. Harada J.I. Hirano T. Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Int. J. Oncol. 2008; 32: 663-671PubMed Google Scholar). p53-/- and MDM2-/- fibroblasts were a kind gift from Dr. Lozano (15Barboza J.A. Iwakuma T. Terzian T. El-Naggar A.K. Lozano G. Mol. Cancer Res. 2008; 6: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) For the production of retroviruses, Plat-E, an ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-packaging cell line, was transfected with the pVPack-GP (expression gal and pol) and pVPack VSVG (expressing env) vectors (Stratagene, CA), with CARF expressing pCXneo retroviral vector either as pCX4neo/CARF-Myc or pCX4neo-CARF-GFP using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science). After 48 h, culture supernatants were collected, passed through 0.45-μm filters and used as viral stocks for infection. TIG-1 and MRC5 cells in 10-cm dishes were treated with 8 μg/ml polybrene at 37 °C for 1 h, following which cells were infected with 1 ml of filtered viral stock for 1 h, then 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for another 48 h. Cells were selected in medium containing G418 (200 μg/ml) until stable cell lines were obtained. The expression of CARF was examined by Western blotting and immunostaining using anti-Myc or anti-GFP antibody as indicated. For growth rate analysis, 4 × 104 cells were seeded in 35-mm dish in duplicates. The cells were trypsinized and counted everyday for next 5 days. For induction of oncogene-induced SIPS, U2OS cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding either the wild-type Ras (Wt Ras) or mutant oncogenic Ras (Mut Ras, G12V). Cells were selected in medium supplemented with G418 (500 μg/ml) for 15 days and were then examined for Ras and CARF levels by Western blotting as described below. CARF-compromised cells were generated by small interference RNA (siRNA) treatment. CARF-targeting 21-nucleotide RNAs were chemically synthesized using Expedite RNA phosphoramidites and thymidine phosphoramidite. Synthetic oligonucleotides were deprotected and gel-purified. Sequences of two control and two target oligos for CARF were 5′-AAGACCGAGUCCAUGAGGCUT-3′, 5′-GCCUCAUGGACUCGGUCUUUT-3′ and 5′-CGGAGUACCUGAGCCAGAAUT-3′, 5′-UUCUGGCUCAGGUACUCCGUT-3′, respectively. For annealing of siRNAs, 20 mm of two control or target single strands were incubated in annealing buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm HEPES-KOH at pH 7.4, 2 mm magnesium acetate) for 1 min at 90 °C followed by 1 h at 37 °C. Transfections of siRNA duplexes were carried out using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Typically, 1–5 μl of the 20 mm duplexes were used per 12-well dish and were assayed after 24–48 h by immunostaining and Western blotting with anti-CARF antibody as described below. Western Blotting—Cells treated with CARF and control siRNAs were harvested at 72-h post-transfection by resuspending cell pellets with lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). The whole cell lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay following the manufacturer's instructions. Lysates containing 20–30 μg of protein were boiled in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer for 5 min, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and then transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (ATTO, Japan). After washing with TBS-T, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min. The membrane was washed three times in TBS-T and once in TBS, then subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)-mediated visualization (Amersham Biosciences) using Lumino Image Analyzer equipped with CCD camera (LAS3000-mini, Fuji Film). Various antibodies used were anti-CARF (Fl-A10) (16Hasan M.K. Yaguchi T. Sugihara T. Kumar P.K. Taira K. Reddel R.R. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. J. Biol.

Fluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Fluorescence and laser confocal microscopy were used to observe cell phenotypes, cell cycle stages, and immunofluorescence. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were probed with primary antibodies against β-tubulin (monoclonal, Sigma), CARF (FL-A10, rabbit polyclonal), and phospho-H3 (monoclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Staining was visualized by Alexa 488 (mouse)- or Alexa 594 (rabbit)-conjugated secondary antibodies. Cells were also stained for nucleus with Hoechst dye (H-33258, Sigma) for 5 min and then mounted using FA mounting fluid (Difco). Images were taken using an Olympus (IX7151F-2, Japan) microscope equipped with confocal scanner unit (CSU-20, Yokogawa Inc., Japan) and EMCCD camera (Andor, UK), operating with the 488 nm (Argon), 351 nm and 364 nm (Argon and UV) laser, and a Carl Zeiss Axiovert microscope attached with Photometrics Synsys monochrome CCD. Senescence-associated β-Gal Assay—Senescent cells were detected using the standard protocol for senescence associated β-gal staining assay. In brief, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 2% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed again with PBS, followed by overnight incubation in staining solution (citric acid/phosphate buffer pH 6.0, 5 mm K3Fe (CN)6, 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6, 2 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, supplemented with 1 mg/ml of X-gal) at 37 °C. Stained cells were observed under the microscope and photodocumented with a NIKON camera. BrdU Incorporation Assay—TIG-1 cells were transfected with pEGFPN1 (Clontech) and pEGFPN1-CARF plasmids. After 48 h of transfection, 10 ml of BrdU labeling reagent (Amersham Biosciences) was added per ml of culture medium for 4 h. Cells were fixed and immunostained with anti-BrdU antibody following manufacturer's protocol. BrdU was visualized with Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibody. About 400 GFP-positive cells were counted for BrdU incorporation in both CARF and vector-transfected culture. Apoptosis Assay—Cells grown on coverslips in 12-well plates were transfected with CARF and control siRNA for 72 h, then subjected to TUNEL assay (Promega), following the manufacturer's instructions provided with the kit. In addition, to verify apoptosis, cells were stained with Hoechst dye (333242) to determine the nuclear condensation and fragmentation. Live Cell Imaging—Cells were grown in glass bottom dish and transfected with CARF and control siRNA as described above. Between 48–60-h post-transfection, live cell microscopy was performed with a heated (37 °C) objective and stage incubator (Tokai Hit) using a laser spinning disc confocal microscope (Yokogawa electric Corp.) equipped with EMCCD camera (Andor, UK). Multicolor live cell imaging system was performed as previously described in detail (16Hasan M.K. Yaguchi T. Sugihara T. Kumar P.K. Taira K. Reddel R.R. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37765-37770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Images were recorded at intervals of 3 min and each z-series typically contained 5–10 slices of up to 20 μmin thickness. Image stacks were converted to maximum intensity projections using Lumina Vision software (Mitani Corp., Fukui, Japan). Overexpression of CARF Caused Premature Senescence of Human Fibroblasts—To resolve the function of CARF, it was overexpressed in human fetal lung fibroblasts (MRC5) that harbor a complete set of its downstream effector components (p53, HDM2 and p21WAF1). MRC5 cells were infected with CARF-Myc expressing retroviral vector at PD 30; the expression was confirmed by Western blotting and immunostaining with anti-Myc antibody for more than three subsequent population doublings (Fig. 1, A and B; data not shown). Control and CARF-overexpressing cells were serially passaged. Whereas CARF-overexpressing cells showed senescence at PD 40, the control cells senesced at about 60 PD. We examined senescence specific markers in control and CARF-overexpressing cells and found that consistent with senescence-like morphology and loss of proliferation, the CARF-overexpressing cells showed autofluorescence, senescence-specific β-gal staining and enhanced levels of p53 protein and its downstream effector, p21WAF1 (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained when CARF was overexpressed in human fetal skin fibroblasts (TIG-1) using GFP-CARF fusion protein (Fig. 1, A and D). CARF-overexpressing TIG-1 cells showed premature senescence (45 PD in contrast to 67 PD in control cells), also signified by altered cell morphology (enlarged, flattened, multinucleated cells and lack of spiral arrangement), enhanced β-gal staining, autofluorescence, and inhibition of DNA synthesis (Fig. 1D and data not shown) and slower growth rate as compared with the vector-infected control cells (Fig. 1E). Of note, CARF overexpression in cells that lack p53, MDM2 and p21WAF1, did not induce senescence suggesting that the effect is predominantly mediated by p53 pathway. This was consistent with our earlier data in which overexpression of CARF induced strong growth arrest in U2OS and HCT116 (wild-type p53 function) but was not effective in Saos-2 that lack functional p53 (10Hasan M.K. Yaguchi T. Minoda Y. Hirano T. Taira K. Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). CARF Is Up-regulated during Replicative and Stress-induced Senescence—Induction of premature senescence with overexpression of CARF led us to examine its role during replicative senescence of normal cells. We found that CARF expression was distinctly increased at later passages of human normal cells and most interestingly, it correlated with enhanced levels of p21WAF1 and reduction in HDM2 (Fig. 2A). These data were consistent with the previously demonstrated functions of CARF as (i) collaborator of ARF (16Hasan M.K. Yaguchi T. Sugihara T. Kumar P.K. Taira K. Reddel R.R. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37765-37770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and p53 (10Hasan M.K. Yaguchi T. Minoda Y. Hirano T. Taira K. Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and (ii) transcriptional repressor of HDM2 (11Hasan M.K. Yaguchi T. Harada J.I. Hirano T. Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Int. J. Oncol. 2008; 32: 663-671PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, we found a strong correlation between up-regulation of CARF with increase in p53 and p21WAF1 (Fig. 2, B and C). Furthermore, it also correlated with presence of endogenous β-gal activity in senescent fibroblasts (Fig. 2D). In senescent cultures, more than 75% cells were enriched with CARF and p21WAF1 expression in concert. Endogenous β-gal staining revealed equivalent percentage of positive cells (Fig. 2D). We next investigated if CARF was also involved in stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) of human cells. As shown in Fig. 3, exposure of TIG-1 (normal human fibroblasts) and U2OS (osteosarcoma) cells to an oxidative stress agent (H2O2) caused senescence as detected by β-gal staining (Fig. 3A). Significantly, CARF was up-regulated in both the cell types, and paralleled the increase in p53 and p21WAF1 proteins (Fig. 3, B and C). Of note, premature senescence induced by oncogenic ras also showed clear up-regulation of CARF (Fig. 3D).FIGURE 3CARF is up-regulated in SIPS. A, induction of SIPS by oxidative stress resulted in appearance of senescence-associated β-gal. B–C, up-regulation of CARF, p53 and p21WAF1 as detected by Western blotting (B) and immunostaining (C). D, induction of SIPS by mutant Ras (G12V) also involved increase in CARF level.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CARF-compromised Cells Undergo Apoptosis—Based on the above data, on the role of CARF in cellular senescence, we predicted that CARF-compromised cells might be able to escape senescence and progress to immortalization. We tested this by employing CARF siRNA in normal (TIG-1 and MRC5) cells (Fig. 4A). Contrary to our prediction, we found that CARF siRNA caused cell death resembling apoptosis. Similar results were obtained in cancer (HeLa and U2OS) cells (Fig. 4A), suggesting that CARF may have some essential function in both normal and cancer cells. In CARF-compromised cells, CARF siRNA (which caused 60–80% reduction in CARF expression) (Fig. 4B and data not shown) not only reduced the levels of p53 and p21WAF1 (assessed as transcriptional activation function of p53) (Fig. 4, B and C), but also caused induction of cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9 (Fig. 4, B–D). These data firmly suggested that the CARF-compromised cells undergo cell death by caspase-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk caused inhibition of cell death caused by CARF knockdown (Fig. 4E). These data confirmed the role of CARF in apoptosis that was mediated by caspase pathways. We also tested if CARF was suppressed during drug-induced apoptosis by using staurosporine as a model reagent. As shown in Fig. 4F, the expression level of CARF was found to be decreased during staurosporine-induced apoptosis, also marked by an increase in amount of cleaved caspase-8. To investigate the role of CARF in both growth arrest and apoptosis, we next used a doxorubicin model of cell death. Low doses of doxorubicin are known to cause growth arrest of cells that resembles senescence, and high doses cause apoptosis (Fig. 4G). Of note, consistent with the above data on the induction of senescence with overexpression of CARF, its expression was increased with low doses of doxorubicin (0.25–0.50 μg/ml) in both U2OS and HeLa cells (Fig. 4G). An increase in the level of CARF expression was paralleled with increase in p53 and p21WAF1 proteins. High doses of doxorubicin (1–3 μg/ml) that resulted in cell death (Fig. 4G), caused reduction in CARF, p53 level and activity (observed by p21WAF1 level), and induced cleavage of caspase-8 (Fig. 4G), signifying apoptosis. Similar results were obtained with doxorubicin, etoposide, and camptothecin treatments in U2OS, HeLa, and HCT116 cells (data not shown), suggesting that the involvement of CARF in senescence and apoptosis is not a cell type or drug-specific response. In view of the role of CARF both in growth arrest and apoptosis as described above, we also performed reconstitution of CARF in CARF-compromised cells by Zn-inducible CARF expression system (11Hasan M.K. Yaguchi T. Harada J.I. Hirano T. Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Int. J. Oncol. 2008; 32: 663-671PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hasan M.K. Yaguchi T. Sugihara T. Kumar P.K. Taira K. Reddel R.R. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37765-37770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). CARF expression was induced at 3-h post-transfection of CARF-siRNA. The results revealed that (i) CARF siRNA was specific and highly efficient; whereas CARF was strongly induced by ZnSO4 in control-siRNA-transfected cells, the presence of CARF-siRNA strongly compromised the reconstitution, (ii) consistent with the overexpression of CARF and p21WAF1, the control-siRNA transfected cells showed strong growth arrest, and (iii) CARF-siRNA compromised the CARF and p21WAF1 levels and resulted in decline in viability (Fig. 4H) that represented combined effect of growth arrest and apoptosis mediated by CARF overexpression and silencing, respectively as also supported by the data in Figs. 2A, 3, A–D, and 4, A–G). Similar effects of CARF-siRNA and reconstitution of CARF expression were recorded by using HDM2 reporter assay (11Hasan M.K. Yaguchi T. Harada J.I. Hirano T. Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Int. J. Oncol. 2008; 32: 663-671PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas CARF overexpression caused decline in HDM-2, increase in p53 and growth arrest in U2OS cells, CARF siRNA abrogated these effects (11Hasan M.K. Yaguchi T. Harada J.I. Hirano T. Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Int. J. Oncol. 2008; 32: 663-671PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hasan M.K. Yaguchi T. Sugihara T. Kumar P.K. Taira K. Reddel R.R. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37765-37770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To get further insights into the mechanism of CARF-silencing induced cell death, we observed that a high number of CARF-compromised cells were TUNEL positive and had condensed chromatin (Hoechst staining), suggesting that CARF silencing caused apoptosis and abnormal cell division (Fig. 5A). Consistent with the presence of condensed chromatin, CARF-suppressed cells were enriched with phosphorylated H3 histone (Fig. 5B), an early marker of mitosis (18Sauve D.M. Anderson H.J. Ray J.M. James W.M. Roberge M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The result indicated that the mitotic progression was inhibited in CARF knockdown cells and that may have been arrested in pro-metaphase stage. Cell cycle analysis of control and CARF siRNA transfected also revealed a 2.6-fold increase in cells at G2/M phase and decrease in cells at G1 suggesting CARF is required for mitotic progression (Fig. 5C). We examined γ-tubulin immunostaining of spindle fibers in CARF-compromised cells and found high proportion of multi-polar, aneuploid, and enlarged cells (Fig. 5, D and E). Time-Lapse Sequence of G2/M Progression in CARF-compromised (with siRNA) Cells—Based on the above data, we performed live cell imaging (time-lapse microscopy) to observe cell division in control and CARF-siRNA-transfected cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 6A, mitotic cycle was visually determined by rounding of the parent cells with condensed chromatin and separation into two daughter cells by cytokinesis. In control cells, mitosis completed in ∼40 min, while in CARF-siRNA-treated cells, although many cells rounded up as in normal mitosis, they did not complete cell division even over a period of 8 h. Instead, these cells were triggered to undergo apoptosis, as shown by their typical blebbing phenotype (Fig. 6, A and B; supplemental Movies S1A and S1B). Similar results were obtained in U2OS, HeLa, and MDA-MB-435 cells. To further prove this phenomenon, we used the multicolor MDA-MB-435 Auro/imp/H3 cell line stably expressing GFP-Aurora A kinase, DsRed-D importin α2 (DsRed-importin), and CFP-histone H3, simultaneously, as markers for the centrosomes/mitotic spindles, nuclear membrane and nucleus/chromosomes, respectively (17Sugimoto K. Urano T. Zushi H. Inoue K. Tasaka H. Tachibana M. Dotsu M. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and performed live cell imaging. As shown in Fig. 7A, untransfected and control siRNA-transfected cells clearly showed the different stages of mitosis, including disappearance of nuclear envelope (red), condensation of chromatin (blue), appearance of spindle poles (green), aligning of chromosomes on metaphase plates, separation of two chromosome sets and progression to anaphase, resulting in two daughter nuclei after the disappearance of the centrosome and reformation of the nuclear envelope (Fig. 7A, supplemental Movie S2). In sharp contrast, CARF-compromised cells showed very faint signal for the centrosome, extensive chromatin condensation ultimately forming a single large structure and an accumulation of importin in the nucleus (Fig. 7B and supplemental Movie S3). Taken together, these data demonstrated that CARF is essential for normal progression of cell division; its absence causes inadequate centrosome formation, excessive chromatin condensation leading to aneuploidy and apoptosis, as evidenced by data in Figs. 6 and 7.FIGURE 7Time lapse examination of mitosis in CARF-compromised multi-label MDA-MB435 cells. A, untransfected cells underwent normal mitosis. (a) Merged image of triply labeled cells, CFP-histone H3 (blue, b), DsRed-importin α (red, c), and GFP-Aurora A (green, d) are shown. Mitotic cell (marked by chromatin condensation and disappearance of nuclear envelope indicated by white arrowheads in b and c, respectively) are shown. At 3 min, appearance of two spindle poles (centrosomes) (black arrowheads in d) was marked. Chromosomes aligned to the cell equator and formed the metaphase plate (24 min). Cell entered anaphase at 36 min (shown by white arrows in b) followed by formation of two daughter nuclei with reformation of nuclear envelope that gradually expanded along with the decondensation of chromatin, disappearance of centrosomes (42–123 min) and exit of mitosis (arrows in d). See also supplemental Movies S2, A–D.

The abundance of calcitonin and calcitonin receptor mRNA displays positive correlation with the Gleason grade of primary prostate cancers. Moreover, calcitonin increases tumorigenicity and invasiveness of multiple prostate cancer cell lines by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated actions. These actions include increased secretion of matrix metalloproteinases and urokinase-type plasminogen activator and an increase in prostate cancer cell invasion. Activation of calcitonin-calcitonin receptor autocrine loop in prostate cancer cell lines led to the loss of cell-cell adhesion, destabilization of tight and adherens junctions, and internalization of key integral membrane proteins. In addition, the activation of calcitonin-calcitonin receptor axis induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of prostate cancer cells as characterized by cadherin switch and the expression of the mesenchymal marker, vimentin. The activated calcitonin receptor phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3, a key regulator of cytosolic beta-catenin degradation within the WNT signaling pathway. This resulted in the accumulation of intracellular beta-catenin, its translocation in the nucleus, and transactivation of beta-catenin-responsive genes. These results for the first time identify actions of calcitonin-calcitonin receptor axis on prostate cancer cells that lead to the destabilization of cell-cell junctions, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and activation of WNT/beta-catenin signaling. The results also suggest that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase plays a key role in calcitonin receptor-induced destabilization of cell-cell junctions and activation of WNT-beta-catenin signaling."

Here, we further describe that CSF1R is upregulated at both the mRNA and protein level in hTERT immortalized human normal OSE cells from two different donors and in hTERT immortalized human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. CSF1R was not upregulated in hTERT immortalized epithelial clones that subsequently underwent senescence or in immortalized fibroblasts. Upon stimulation by the CSF1R ligand CSF1, the immortalized epithelial cell lines showed rapid internalization of CSF1R with concomitant down-modulation and colocalization of phosphorylated NFκBp65 with hTERT protein, hTERT translocation into the nucleus and the binding of c-Myc to the hTERT promoter region. Reducing the expression of CSF1R using short hairpin interfering RNA abolished these effects and also decreased cell survival and the number of population doublings under suboptimal culture conditions. The telomerase inhibitor GRN163L confirmed a role for telomerase in the cleavage of the intracellular domain of CSF1R. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that CSF1R may be a critical factor facilitating hTERT immortalization of epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2028540474,"Cochrane reviews are regarded as being scientifically rigorous and are increasingly used by a variety of stakeholders. However, factors predicting the publication of Cochrane reviews have never been reported. This is important because if a higher proportion of Cochrane protocols with certain characteristics (e.g., funding) are being published, this may lead to inaccurate decisions. We examined the frequency of published and unpublished Cochrane reviews and protocol factors that predict the publication of Cochrane reviews.Retrospective cohort study of Cochrane protocols published in 2000 (Issues 2 to 4) and 2001 (Issue 1). The publication status of these reviews was followed up to Issue 1, 2008 in The Cochrane Library. Survival analysis of the time from protocol publication to the first review publication and protocol factors predicting the time to publication was conducted. There were 411 new Cochrane protocols in the cohort. After excluding 39; 71/372 (19.1%) were unpublished and 301/372 (80.9%) were published as full Cochrane reviews at the time of study analysis (January 2008). The median time to publication was 2.4 years (range: 0.15 to 8.96). Multivariate analyses revealed that shorter time to publication was associated with the review subsequently being updated (hazard ratio, HR: 1.80 [95% confidence interval, CI: 1.39 to 2.33 years]) and longer time to publication was associated with the review having two published protocols, indicating changes to the review plan (HR: 0.33 [95% CI: 0.12 to 0.90 years]).Only about 80% Cochrane protocols were published as full reviews after over 8 years of follow-up. The median time to publication was 2.4 years and some reviews took much longer. Strategies to decrease time to publication should be considered, such as streamlining the review process, increased support for authors when protocol amendments occur, and better infrastructure for updating Cochrane reviews."
https://openalex.org/W2032413647,"NXF, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS transcription factor family, is thought to be involved in functional regulation of neurons, because significant expression is found in the mature brain. To elucidate functions of NXF in vivo, here we generated mice lacking NXF using homologous recombination with embryonic stem cells. NXF-/- mice were morphologically indistinguishable (with no growth retardation) from their littermates (wild type) at birth. However, they started to die at a rate of 1 death/20–30 animals per week under specific pathogen-free grade breeding conditions when over 3 months old. Histological analyses revealed age-dependent neurodegeneration in brain, and only 20–30% of the NXF-/- mice survived for 16 months. To clarify the role of NXF in protection against neurodegeneration in normal cells, we analyzed gene expression under several conditions in vitro and in vivo. The NXF gene was up-regulated by several neurodegenerative cell-stress inducers such as thapsigargin (endoplasmic reticulum stress), SIN-1 (oxidative stress), and sorbitol (osmotic stress) in cultured cells. Furthermore, elevated NXF gene expression was apparent with in vivo stroke models featuring kainate-induced hippocampal injury and transient global ischemia. When NXF-/- mice were evaluated in the glutamate excitotoxicity model, they proved more susceptible to hippocampal injury at 15 weeks after birth. The findings in this study suggest that the NXF gene could be induced in response to several neurodegenerative stimuli/excitations for the cell protection, and thus provide an “on demand” cell-protection system in nervous tissue.

The basic helix-loop-helix-PAS type protein family is an important class of transcription factors that are generally responsive to various environmental and physiological, including developmental, stimuli and that play roles in cell adaptation as “sensor” proteins, regulating target gene expression (1Kewley J.R. Whitelaw L.M. Chapman-Smith A. Inst. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Family members have been identified from insects to humans, and Drosophila Sim, for example, has been well characterized as a master regulator that is critical for Drosophila midline development (2Crews S.T. Fan C.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). At least two homologues of Sim (Sim1 and Sim2) are known to be present in the human genome (3Probst M.R. Fan C.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4451-4457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and one of them, Sim2, has attracted interest in the context of Down syndrome pathogenesis (4Chrast R.

In the course of a search for additional hypothetical human Sim homologues (hypothetical Sim3), we previously isolated a novel gene, “human NXF” (7Ooe N. Saito K. Mikami N. Nakatuka I. Kaneko H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), whose C-terminal half demonstrated no homology to all known other members of the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS family (including Sim1/2). Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans also have NXF-like-genes, and the Drosophila example (called Dys (8Jiang L. Crews S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6547-6556Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or dNXFL) has been functionally characterized by gene knock-down. The expression pattern of the Drosophila NXF-like gene exhibits little tissue specificity, unlike the mammalian NXF gene that is selectively expressed in the nervous system. Although the Drosophila NXF-like gene has been shown to be critical for development of the Drosophila trachea (8Jiang L. Crews S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6547-6556Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), mammalian NXF is only slightly expressed in the mammalian development stage, rather becoming evident when development of all tissues is complete (7Ooe N. Saito K. Mikami N. Nakatuka I. Kaneko H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The observed clear increase in expression in mammalian NXF in the nervous system after birth suggests important roles in neural functions in the mature brain. In the present report, we document “on demand” expression of NXF in cultured cells treated with several cell-stress inducers in vitro, and in two animal models accompanying neurodegeneration in vivo. To investigate the significance of NXF-inducible expression in vivo, we utilized NXF-deficient (null: NXF(-/-)) mice. NXF-/- mice were evaluated in the kainate-induced hippocampal injury model (excitotoxicity model). Comparison of the NXF-/- mouse with the wild-type littermate provides insights into important NXF function in vivo. Targeted Disruption of NXF—A targeting vector was constructed using a neo gene cassette for positive selection and a diphtheria toxin A-chain gene cassette for negative selection. NXF exons 1–3 (2.1-kb EcoRI-EcoRV genomic fragment) was replaced by the neo gene cassette. neo was franked by 4.3-kb (EcoRV-ScaI) and 4.7-kb (HpaI-EcoRI) NXF genomic sequences derived from the 129/Sv genomic library. The diphtheria toxin A-chain gene cassette was ligated to the HpaI site. After linearization, this construct was electroporated into 129/Sv-derived embryonic stem (ES) 2The abbreviations used are: ES, embryonic stem; WT, wild type; KO, knock-out; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein. cells (Xenogen Biosciences Corp.), and G418-resistant colonies were selected. Homologous recombination events were assessed and confirmed by Southern blot hybridization. Two independent clones (the targeted ES clones) were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts and transferred to foster mothers to obtain chimeric mice. Chimeric males were then mated with C57BL/6 females and F1 heterozygous mice carrying the NXF mutation were identified by Southern blot hybridization and intercrossed to produce F2 homozygous offspring. Two independent lines of F4 mice were assessed in the present study. No essential differences were observed between these two lines of NXF-deficient mice, and also between F4 and F8 generations examined later for confirmation. All wild-type (WT) mice used in each assay were wild-type littermates of the NXF-deficient mice analyzed. Experimental Animal Treatment—Experiments using rats and mice were performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. 15-week-old C57BL/6 (Charles River, Tokyo, Japan) mice, NXF-deficient mice, and wild-type littermates were injected (intraperitoneally) with saline (vehicle) or 28 mg/kg sodium kainate (kainate, Wako, Japan) and the brains were removed, fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, and embedded in paraffin 5 days thereafter for immunostaining. Transient global ischemia treatment was performed in Nihon Bioresearch Center (Gifu, Japan). For this purpose, 8-week-old Crj:Wistar rats (Charles River, Tokyo, Japan) were anesthetized, and the vertebral arteries were closed by heat-coagulation at the first cervical vertebrae. On the day after this irreversible obliteration, both common carotids exposed in the cervical region were temporary closed for 10 min with clips (Sugita Clip, Hozumiikakogyo, Japan). At 10 days after the transient ischemia, the brains were fixed, paraffin-embedded, and subjected to immunostaining. Cell Culture and Stress Treatments—PC12 cells (ATCC) cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 15% horse serum and 1 mm sodium pyruvate were pre-incubated in RPMI1640 supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum and 1 mm sodium pyruvate for 16 h, then stimulated with medium containing vehicle (final 0.1% DMSO), 10 μm thapsigargin (Wako, Japan), 1 μm SIN-1 (Dojin Chemical, Japan) plus 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin or 1 mg (6160 units)/ml SOD (Nakaraitesuku, Japan), or 1 m sorbitol (Wako, Japan). Cells were harvested at the indicated time points, and extracted RNAs were subjected to real-time PCR analysis with a rat NXF-specific TaqMan probe (Rn00596522_ml; ABI). The level of NXF (n = 6) was normalized with a control TaqMan probe (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, ABI). Whole Brain Real-time PCR—NXF-deficient mice (KO) and wild-type littermates (WT) were sacrificed at 15 weeks (n = 10 each) or 30 weeks (n = 10 for each) of age, and RNAs from half of whole brain (right hemisphere) were subjected to real-time PCR analysis with mouse NXF-specific TaqMan probes (MN00463644_ml, ABI), normalized to a control TaqMan probe (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, ABI). Similarly, TaqMan probes for GFAP (Mm00546086_ml, ABI), XBP-1 (Mm00457359_ml, ABI), GRP78 (Mm00517691_ml, ABI), ATF6 (Mm01295316_ml, ABI), Ern1 (Mm00470233_ ml, ABI), GPX1 (Mm00656767_gl, ABI), and GPX2 (Mm00850074_gl, ABI) were used for quantification of the respective gene expression levels. Histopathological Analyses—Fluoro-jade B (Chemicon), an anionic fluorescein derivative that has specific affinity for neurons undergoing degeneration, was used to stain animal brain sections following a standard procedure (9Schmued L.C. Hopkins K.J. Brain Res. 2000; 874: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Deparaffined sections were treated in 0.06% KMnO4 solution for 15 min and then stained with 0.001% Fluoro-jade B/0.1% acetic acid solution for 30 min. The tissue was then examined under a fluorescence microscope with the filter set for fluorescein isothiocyanate to visualize Fluoro-jade B fluorescence (Olympus, IX-FLA-DP50 system). For immunostaining, tissue sections (10-μm thickness) from paraffin-embedded brains were activated (100 °C 5 min) in Target Retrieval Solution (DAKO), then exposed to anti-NXF, anti-pJunK (SC-6254, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-IbaI (Wako), or anti-Nitrotyrosine (AB5411, Chemicon) antibodies. For production of anti-NXF antibodies, rabbits were immunized with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide (CRFNTSKSLRRQSAGNKL) specific for NXF, using a standard immunization protocol (Asahi Tekuno Glass, Chiba, Japan). The IgG fraction from pooled antiserum was purified using a standard affinity method for use in immunostaining. Visualization of binding was performed with a 3,3′-diaminobenzidinetetrahydrochloride staining kit (HistoFine simple stain MXA-PO kit and 3,3′-diaminobenzidinetetrahydrochloride solution, Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan). For anti-GFAP immunostaining, a commercially available GFAP staining kit containing anti-GFAP antibody was employed (HistoFine SAB-PO GFAP kit, Nichirei). A terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) kit (ApopTag Plus Peroxidase In situ Apoptosis Detection Kit, Chemicon) was used for detection of apoptosis by the TUNEL method. Generation of NXF-deficient (Null) Mice—A targeting vector for the mouse NXF gene was created by inserting a neomycin resistance cassette into the NXF locus genomic fragment derived from the 129/Sv mouse, replacing the promoter and exons 1–3, which encode the DNA binding domain essential for NXF function (Fig. 1A). The targeting vector was introduced into ES cells through homologous recombination, and proper recombination events were identified using Southern blot analysis. Several independent recombinant ES clones were obtained and microinjected into C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. Several lines of chimeric mice derived from independent mutant ES clones were found to transmit the mutant allele to their offspring. Through animal breeding, wild-type, homozygous, and heterozygous mutant genotypes were generated and confirmed by Southern blot analysis of DNA from the progeny obtained (Fig. 1B), and two independent lines of NXF-deficient mice derived from two independent recombinant ES clones were obtained. Such homologous mutation of the NXF gene should led to NXF functional deficiency (NXF-/-) in the mice, because it results in no promoter and no DNA binding domain. To confirm the lack of expression of NXF, we performed real-time PCR analysis using total RNAs of brains from wild-type and homozygous mice. As with null mice, no significant expression of NXF was detected in both lines of NXF-deficient (null) mice (Fig. 1C, KO-(1) and KO-(2)). Progressive Brain Damage Observed in NXF-deficient Mice—Newborn NXF-deficient mice showed no morphological abnormality, compared with their littermates (wild type) at birth, and demonstrated the expected Mendelian ratio and bred normally, indicating that NXF is dispensable for embryonic development. The NXF-deficient mice showed no growth retardation and no significant abnormality at young age. However, after ∼3 months, a small percent of NXF-deficient mice in both independent NXF-null lines started to show abnormal behavior such as crouching, bending back, or abnormal jumping, often resulting in self-injury, suggesting some neurological abnormality (data not shown). Although their symptoms and severity differed greatly each other, such abnormalities progressively developed and NXF-deficient mice finally start to die at a rate of 1 death/20–30 animals per week under clean (specific pathogen-free grade) breeding conditions. Differences in survival rates among NXF-deficient mice, heterozygotes, and control wild mice (littermates) are illustrated in Fig. 2A. Although almost all wild mice survived 16 months, this was the case for only 20–30% of NXF-deficient mice. In addition, many of the NXF-deficient survivors demonstrated abnormal behavior (mentioned above). The heterozygote (NXF+/-) mice also showed vulnerability compared with control wild-type mice, some 20% dying during the 16 months. In the NXF-deficient mice brains on histopathological analyses, performed when they died or they were dying, severe neuronal cell damage accompanied by heavy glial cell activation was apparent with no abnormality in any of the other major tissues examined. As a first step in characterizing the brain damage in detail, expression levels of a glial cell activation marker, GFAP, in NXF-deficient mice (KO1–10) and control wild littermates (WT1–10) were examined (Fig. 2B). Induction of GFAP, which indicates glial cell activation, is known to accompany proximal neuronal cell damage, and is often used as an indirect marker of brain damage (10Herrmann M. Ehrenreich H. Restor. Neurol. Neurosci. 2003; 21: 177-190PubMed Google Scholar). When 15 weeks old, NXF-deficient (null) mice (KO1–10) in this experiment, lacking significant abnormality in behavior, did not show any significant difference in the GFAP mRNA expression level as compared with control wild-type littermates (WT1–10) (Fig. 2B, upper panel). However, in the NXF-deficient brains at 30 weeks of age, significant induction of GFAP mRNA was detected, albeit with marked variation in the extent (Fig. 2B, lower panel). In this experiment, there were no deaths of NXF-deficient mice (KO11–20) at 30 weeks of age. Histopathological analyses of the NXF-deficient mice brains, however, confirmed GFAP induction in glial cells (data described in the next section). Using the same RNA samples, we also quantified the expression level of several genes related to cell-stress tolerance. Among cell-stress-responsive/-related genes tested (over 50 genes), XBP-1 (11Feldman D.E. Chauhan V. Koong A.C. Mol. Cancer Res. 2005; 3: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), GRP78 (12Hayashi T. Saito A. Okuno S. Ferrand-Drake M. Chan P.H. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2003; 23: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), Ern1 (13Mori K. Ma W. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1993; 74: 743-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), and GPX2 (14Yan W. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7856-7862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) declined in their expression in the NXF-deficient mice at 30 weeks of age (Fig. 2C). These may be examples of indirect NXF target genes that are responsible for cell-stress tolerance preventing damage of brain such as that observed in NXF-null mice. XBP-1 and Ern1 function as ER-stress sensor proteins, whereas GRP78 and GPX2 are also stress-inducible cell-protective proteins that are important for cell-stress tolerance. It could be anticipated that the NXF-deficient brain at 30 weeks of age is more susceptible to cell stress than at 15 weeks, contributing to progressive brain damage. A spiral toward cell death could clearly originate from the decreased expression of stress-tolerance genes. All of the above genes had normal expression at the 15-week time point. Thus, as another possibility, these genes may be secondly or thirdly influenced by a certain event that should be regulated by some NXF direct target gene products, which remain to be identified in future investigations. On the other hand, nonspecific gene down-expression or simple cell loss in the brain does not appear to contribute to the repressed gene expression observed at 30 weeks of age in this experiment, because ATF6 (15Kim R. Emi M. Tanabe K. Murakami S. Apoptosis. 2006; 11: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and GPX1 (16Lei X.G. Biofactors. 2001; 14: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as control genes here and internal control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (and over 50 genes with other factors tested; data not shown) were unaltered. Histopathologically Detected Brain Damage in NXF-deficient Mice—To confirm the brain damage, we performed a histopathological analysis of NXF-deficient brains. No differences between NXF-deficient and wild-type mice (and among 10 animals for each) were evident at 15 weeks of age (data not shown). However, at 30 weeks, obvious degeneration of neurons was evident in the NXF-deficient animals sacrificed for histopathological analyses. Degeneration of neurons was also detected by Fluoro-jade B (known to specifically stain degenerated neurons (9Schmued L.C. Hopkins K.J. Brain Res. 2000; 874: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar)) fluorescence staining analysis (Fig. 3A). It should be pointed out that there were large individual differences in the damaged brain sites and the degree of injury each other. In some NXF-deficient mouse brains, almost all hippocampal CA1–2 neurons had already died. An example of individual damage differences is shown figure 3B with anti-GFAP immunostaining, a conventional tool to show proximal neuron damage. Individual NXF-deficient mice (KO11–13) showed different distribution patterns of GFAP immunoreactivity in the hippocampus (Fig. 3B Hippocampus), although brain damage was not restricted to the hippocampus (Fig. 3B lower panel: Cerebral cortex). In the NXF-deficient brains, the TUNEL method (17Huerta S. Goulet E.J. Huerta-Yepez S. Livingston E.H. J. Surg. Res. 2007; 139: 143-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) detected apoptosis (Fig. 3C, top panel). Gathering of microglial cells was also observed (Fig. 3C, middle panel), as often observed in the degenerating brain after ischemia (18del Zoppo G.J. Milner R. Mabuchi T. Hung S. Wang X. Berg G.I. Koziol J.A. Stroke. 2007; 38: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The presence of oxidized proteins with nitrotyrosines (19Abu-Qare A.W. Abou-Donia M.B. J. Toxicol Environ. Health B Crit. Rev. 2001; 4: 313-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) suggested that oxidation could be involved in neuronal damage observed in the NXF-deficient mice (Fig. 3C, bottom panel). The pathology of brain damage was reminiscent of that observed in cerebral stroke (20Kirino T. Neuropathology. 2000; 20: S95-S97Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Because NXF-deficient mice did not exhibit seizures or epilepsy during daily observation, they do not appear to suffer from stroke, epilepsy, ischemia, or related symptoms, which themselves could lead to neuronal damage. Rather, environmental neural stresses such as auto-excitotoxicity in daily life might be responsible. If so, NXF could be an essential molecule for neural stress responses and neuronal cell survival in the mature brain. On Demand NXF Expression in Vitro and in Vivo—It is well known that, as a kind of self-defense mechanism, several cell-protective genes are induced by cell stresses in parallel with cell damage (21Barone F.C. Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 104: 105-184PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dirnagl U. Simon R.P. Hallenbeck J.M. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 248-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects of several typical neurodegenerative stress stimuli on NXF mRNA expression in PC12 cells. A typical ER-stress inducer, thapsigargin (10 μm) (23Kass G.E. Orrenius S. Environ. Health Perspect. 1999; 107: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), induced NXF mRNA with a peak at 0.5 h (Fig. 4A, top panel). With a typical oxidative stress inducer, SIN-1 (1 mm) (24Naoi M. Maruyama W. Shamoto-Nagai M. Yi H. Akao Y. Tanaka M. Mol. Neurobiol. 2005; 31: 81-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the peak occurred after 3 h (Fig. 4A, middle panel). The delay of NXF induction time (with a peak at 3 h) observed in comparison with the ER stress case may be due to the fact that generation of oxidative radicals from SIN-1 in culture medium requires a few hours. Confirming the oxidative stress involvement in the NXF induction, the co-presence of SOD protein, a typical oxidative radical scavenger (25Kim G.W. Kondo T. Noshita N. Chan P.H. Stroke. 2002; 33: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), abolished the induction of NXF by SIN-1 treatment, whereas control bovine serum albumin protein was without influence. Thirdly, osmotic stress induced by treatment with 1 m sorbitol (26Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kültz D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) also activated NXF expression (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). Thus several cell-degenerative stresses could induce NXF expression before they started to otherwise impair cells. Moreover, distinct up-regulation of NXF gene expression was found in an in vivo stroke model. A glutamate analogue, kainate, binds to glutamate receptors on neurons and induces specific brain damage derived from excessive excitation of neurons (glutamate excitotoxicity) (27Puig B. Ferrer I. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 321: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The same mechanism underlies neuron damage observed in stroke (28Caccamo D. Campisi A. Curró M. Li Volti G. Vanella A. Ientile R. Amino Acids. 2004; 27: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, in the kainate-treated mouse brain, significant NXF protein induction was detected in surviving neurons next to dying cells (Fig. 4B, top and middle panels). In contrast to NXF, a control protein, the phosphorylated form of Jun kinase (pJNK) (29Hochedlinger K. Wagner E.F. Sabapathy K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2441-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), had exactly the reverse distribution and showed expression signals in dying but not surviving neurons (Fig. 4B, bottom panel). The complementary results confirmed the reliability and specificity of each immunostaining. NXF protein induction in brain could be detected also in another kind of stroke model, in animals challenged by transient global ischemia (30Nitatori T. Sato N. Waguri S. Karasawa Y. Araki H. Shibanai K. Kominami E. Uchiyama Y. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4C, up-regulated expression of NXF was observed in surviving cells surrounded by dying cells in the hippocampus. These results show that NXF gene can be induced on demand in response to several neurodegenerative neuronal stimuli/excitations. To confirm the NXF protein induction in surviving cells, not in dying cells, we performed anti-NXF immunostaining, TUNEL assay, and Fluoro-jade B staining on same brain slices sample (Brain challenged by transient global ischemia). The result shown in Fig. 4D indicates that there are few NXF protein-expressing cells in this damaged hippocampus (Anti-NXF). We can detect strong positive signals on this same brain slice with TUNEL assay and Fluoro-jade B staining instead. The NXF-deficient Brain Shows Increased Susceptibility to a Typical Nerve Stress, Glutamate Excitotoxicity—Hypothesizing that the NXF-deficient mice have an impaired brain protective mechanism as the result of lacking on demand-inducible expression of NXF, we challenged NXF-deficient mice and control wild-type littermates with a typical glutamate receptor stimulator, kainate (27Puig B.

In the 15-week-old wild-type mice, 28 mg/kg induced mild glutamate excitotoxicity accompanied by neuronal damage, particularly in the hippocampus, one of the most susceptible regions of the brain (20Kirino T. Neuropathology. 2000; 20: S95-S97Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). A mild increase of GFAP immunoreactivity was also detected (Fig. 5, lower panel). The dose of kainate was not fatal for the wild-type mice. In contrast, three of eight 15-week-old NXF-deficient mice, with no obvious abnormality before the treatment, died within 5 days of the kainate injection, and the remainder exhibited severely abnormal behavior (myoclonic epilepsy) and serious brain damage with strong GFAP immunoreactivity (Fig. 5, upper panel). In particular, for example, K1, K2, and K3, which present relatively strong GFAP signals among other examples as shown Fig. 5, gave conspicuous Fluoro-jade B-positive signals in the hippocampus at CA3 region. There were no cases of such GFAP induction in saline-injected control NXF-deficient mice (n = 8) in this experiment. The induction of NXF protein by kainate (Fig. 4B) may provide protection against glutamate excitotoxicity in the brain. Considering that similar NXF induction was observed with other stimuli such as osmotic stress (Fig. 4A), NXF-deficient mice may have lowered thresholds for several kinds of neuronal cell stress. The NXF gene product may thus be responsible for one neuronal-stress tolerance mechanism, induced on demand in response to several neurodegenerative stimuli. In summary, our generated NXF-deficient mice (NXF-/-) showed no abnormality at birth, but progressively featured brain damage from ∼3 months of age, resulting in only 20–30% survival after 16 months. An ER stress inducer, thapsigargin, an oxidative stress inducer, SIN-1, and an osmotic stress inducer, 1 m sorbitol, up-regulated NXF expression in vitro. We also observed induced expression of NXF in kainate (glutamate analogue)-treated brain and in degenerating brain with transient global ischemia. To determine whether the NXF expression is cell-protective or not, we challenged NXF-deficient mice (NXF-/-) with an excitotoxicity inducer, kainate. The NXF-deficient brain showed elevated vulnerability to a typical nerve stress: glutamate excitotoxicity. Taking our results together, we propose a hypothetical model for NXF functions in brain (Fig. 6). Neural stresses such as transient ischemia and glutamate excitotoxicity in daily life induce NXF mRNA, and the translated NXF protein contributes to the on demand cell protection under neural stresses. NXF-deficient mice (NXF-/-) lack this system and therefore exhibit increased susceptibility. Because NXF is a transcription factor, NXF-dependent cell protection should be executed by NXF target genes. Although XBP-1, GRP78, Ern1, and GPX2, which we found in this study to be candidates of indirect NXF target genes, could be important cell-protection players, direct NXF target genes need to be characterized in future studies.

Proteins containing iron-sulfur ([Fe-S]) clusters are employed in a wide array of metabolic functions (reviewed in Ref. 1Beinert H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 2-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Research addressing the biosynthesis of the iron-molybdenum cofactor of nitrogenase in Azotobacter vinelandii led to the discovery of an operon (iscAnifnifUSVcysE1) involved in the biosynthesis of [Fe-S] clusters (reviewed in Ref. 2Frazzon J. Dean D.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments led to the finding of two more systems involved in the de novo biosynthesis of [Fe-S] clusters, the isc and the suf systems (3Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol.

Like Escherichia coli, the genome of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium encodes for the isc and suf [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis machinery. Recent studies have identified a number of additional or non-isc/-suf-encoded proteins that are involved in bacterial [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis and repair. Examples include the following: CyaY, an iron-binding protein believed to be involved in iron trafficking and iron delivery (5Layer G. Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Fontecave M. J. Biol.

Analysis of the metabolic network anchored to thiamine biosynthesis in S. enterica identified lesions in three non-isc or -suf loci that compromise Fe-S metabolism as follows: apbC, apbE, and rseC (17Skovran E.

This metabolic system was subsequently used to dissect a role for cyaY and gshA in [Fe-S] cluster metabolism (6Vivas E. Skovran E. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1175-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Gralnick J. Webb E. Beck B. Downs D. J.

Of these, the apbC (mrp in E. coli) locus was identified as the predominant site of lesions that altered thiamine synthesis by disrupting [Fe-S] cluster metabolism (17Skovran E. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Petersen L. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5676-5682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ApbC is a member of the ParA subfamily of proteins that have a wide array of functions, including electron transfer (24Igarashi R.Y. Seefeldt L.C. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 38: 351-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), initiation of cell division (25Lutkenhaus J. Sundaramoorthy M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and DNA segregation (26Leonard T.A. Butler P.J. Lowe J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 27Friedman S.A. Austin S.J. Plasmid. 1988; 19: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Importantly, ATP hydrolysis is required for function of all well characterized members of this subfamily, and all members contain a “deviant” Walker A motif, which contains two lysine residues instead of one (GKXXXGK(S/T)) (28Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). ApbC has been shown to hydrolyze ATP (17Skovran E. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recently, five proteins with a high degree of identity to ApbC have been shown to be involved in [Fe-S] cluster metabolism in eukaryotes. The sequence alignments of the central portion of these proteins and bacterial ApbC are shown in Fig. 1. HCF101 was demonstrated to be involved in chloroplast [Fe-S] cluster metabolism (29Lezhneva L. Amann K. Meurer J. Plant J. 2004; 37: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 30Stockel J. Oelmuller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10243-10251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The CFD1, Npb35, and huNbp35 (formally Nubp1) proteins were demonstrated to be involved in cytoplasmic [Fe-S] cluster metabolism (31Roy A. Solodovnikova N. Nicholson T. Antholine W. Walden W.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4826-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 32Hausmann A. Aguilar Netz D.J. Balk J. Pierik A.J. Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3266-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Ind1 was demonstrated to be involved in the maturation of [Fe-S] clusters in the mitochondrial enzyme NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (33Bych K. Kerscher S. Netz D.J. Pierik A.J. Zwicker K. Huynen M.A. Lill R. Brandt U. Balk J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1736-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). There is currently no report of any of these proteins hydrolyzing ATP. Biochemical analysis of ApbC indicated that it could bind and transfer [Fe-S] clusters to Saccharomyces cerevisiae apo-isopropylmalate isomerase (34Boyd J.M. Pierik A.J. Netz D.J. Lill R. Downs D.M. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8195-8202Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Additional genetic studies indicated that ApbC has a degree of functional redundancy with IscU, a known [Fe-S] cluster scaffolding protein (35Boyd J.M. Lewis J.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 4596-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Raulfs E.C. O'Carroll I.P. Dos Santos P.C. Unciuleac M.C. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 8591-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this study we investigate the correlation between the biochemical properties of ApbC (i.e. ATPase activity, [Fe-S] cluster binding, and [Fe-S] cluster transfer rates) and the in vivo function of this protein. This is the first detailed kinetic analysis of ATP hydrolysis for a member of the ParA subfamily of deviant Walker A proteins and the first functional analysis of a member of the ever expanding family of ApbC/Nbp35 proteins. Data presented indicate that noncomplementing variants have distinct biochemical properties that place them in three distinct classes. Materials—FeCl3 (ACS grade), thiamine (>99%), Li2S (>98%), Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 (>99%), 3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-di(2-furyl)-1,2,4-triazine-5′,5″-disulfonic acid (>99%), ascorbic acid (>99%), (C2H3O2)2Zn·2H2O (reagent grade), N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate (98%), and l-cysteine (>98%) were purchased from Sigma. dl-threo-3-Isopropylmalic acid (96%) was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Co Osaka, Japan. All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. The BCA protein assay kit and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Pierce. E. coli BL21 (AI*) cells were purchased from Novagen. Bacterial Strains, Culture Media, and Growth Conditions—Bacterial strains were derivatives of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain LT2 (specifically DM1) whose genotypes are shown in Table 1. Plasmids carrying the desired allele of apbC fused to a C-terminal His tag in pET20b were constructed as described (17Skovran E. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using XhoI instead of NcoI. All constructs used were verified by sequencing at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center. Plasmids were moved between strains via electroporation. Overnight cultures were grown in Difco nutrient broth with appropriate antibiotic for strains harboring a plasmid. Test cultures were grown at 37 °C shaking at an approximate 45° angle to increase aeration. The absorbance of cultures was taken at 650 nm on a Bausch and Lomb Spectronic 20.TABLE 1Strains and plasmidsStrainGenotypeDM5104DM1 wild typeDM5986apbC55:Tn10d(Tc) yggX::GmaResistances are indicated as follows: Tc, tetracycline; Ap, ampicillin; Gm, gentamycin.DM9450purF2085 apbC55::Tn10d(Tc)PlasmidVector and insertInsertpET20bpET20b(Ap)NonepES1pET20b(Ap)apbCbPlasmids were constructed for a previous study (17).pES2pET20b(Ap)apbC (K121A)bPlasmids were constructed for a previous study (17).pJB1pET20b(Ap)apbC (S122A)pJB2pET20b(Ap)apbC (C70A)pJB3pET20b(Ap)apbC (C283A)pJB4pET20b(Ap)apbC (C286A)pJB5pET20b(Ap)apbC (S182A)pJB6pET20b(Ap)apbC (S116A)pJB7pET20b(Ap)apbC (C283A, C286A)a Resistances are indicated as follows: Tc, tetracycline; Ap, ampicillin; Gm, gentamycin.b Plasmids were constructed for a previous study (17Skovran E.

Open table in a new tab Nutritional Analysis—Complementation analyses were performed in strains where plasmids encoded the only copy of apbC present in the cell. Complementation was assessed using 5-ml cultures of no carbon E (NCE) medium supplemented with 1 mm MgSO4 and trace minerals. Cultures were started with a 1:100 inoculum. When present in the media, the following were used at the specified final concentration: adenine, 0.4 mm; thiamine, 100 nm; glucose, 11 mm; tricarballylate, 20 mm; gluconate, 11 mm; and ampicillin, 30 μg/ml. Three growth assays, using two genetic backgrounds, were used to examine the ability of ApbC proteins to function in vivo. The two genetic backgrounds used were apbC yggX and purF apbC. In vivo function was assayed by growth on tricarballylate as a carbon and energy source or growth in the absence of exogenous thiamine on either glucose or gluconate, respectively. The requirement for ApbC in these growth conditions has been described previously (17Skovran E. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Petersen L.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Anaerobic Work—Anaerobic work was performed using a Coy anaerobic glove box (Grass Lake, MI) or vacuum manifold. Before placement inside the anaerobic chamber, solutions were made anoxic by repeated evacuation and flushing with N2 gas passed over a heated copper column for removal of O2. Outside of the glove box, all solutions were added to anaerobic cuvettes using gas-tight Hamilton syringes. ApbC and Leu-1 Protein Purification—Purification of ApbC and Leu-1 has been described previously (34Boyd J.M. Pierik A.J. Netz D.J. Lill R. Downs D.M. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8195-8202Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Protein Concentration Determination—Protein concentration was determined using a colorimetric assay or an empirically determined extinction coefficient (apo-ApbC-His280 = 43.1 mm–1 cm–1). The colorimetric assay was copper-based and used a reagent containing bicinchoninic acid to detect of the cupreous ion (Pierce). Bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml) was used as a standard. [Fe-S] Cluster Reconstitution—Iron-sulfur cluster reconstitution was described previously (34Boyd J.M. Pierik A.J. Netz D.J. Lill R. Downs D.M. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8195-8202Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, ApbC protein (2.1 mg/ml; 52 μm) suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) was incubated for 1 h in an anoxic environment in the presence of 5 mm DTT. 2The abbreviation used is: DTT, dithiothreitol. A 5-fold excess of FeCl3 was added to the protein followed by a 5-fold excess Li2S. Proteins were incubated for 1 h, and excess S2–, Fe3+, and DTT was removed by passing the reaction mixture over a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare). One mm DTT was added to protein post desalting. Leu-1 Activation Assays—Leu-1 activation assays have been described previously (34Boyd J.M. Pierik A.J. Netz D.J. Lill R. Downs D.M. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8195-8202Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, apo-isopropylmalate isomerase (apo-Leu-1) (25 μm) was pre-reduced with 5 mm DTT in the anaerobic glove box for at least 1 h prior to assay initiation. The Leu-1 activation assays contained 3.5 μm Leu-1, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl in a total volume of 500 μl. Assays were initiated by the addition of 4 μm ApbC protein. Ten-μl aliquots of the assay mixture were removed at time points, and Leu-1 was assayed for the ability to convert 3-isopropylmalate to dimethylcitraconate acid spectrophotometrically (dimethylcitraconate ε235 = 4.35 mm–1 cm–1) (38Gross S.R. Burns R.O. Umbarger H.E. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 1046-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The second-order rate constant for ApbC dependent Leu-1 activation was determined by linearization of the data and fitting the data using linear regression. The ApbC-dependent activation of Leu-1 is summarized by Reaction 1,holo−ApbC+apo−Leu−1→holo−Leu−1Reaction 1 The amount of holo-ApbC protein present (4 μm initial) in the assay mixture at a given time point was determined using Equation 1,[holo−ApbC]=4−(SAx/SA40)ċ4Eq. 1 where SAx is the specific activity of Leu-1 at a fixed time point, and SA40 is the specific activity of Leu-1 after the reaction had proceeded for 40 min. The second-order rate constant of cluster transfer was determined by fitting the 1/[holo-ApbC protein] versus time post the addition of holo-ApbC protein to apo-Leu-1 data using linear regression, where k is the slope of the fit. Spectroscopic Techniques—The UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a Lambda Bio 40 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using 1.5-ml Sterna Cell cuvettes that can be anaerobically sealed (Atascadero, CA). Metal Analysis—Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry was conducted by the Soil and Plant Analysis Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The concentration of non-heme iron and acid-labile sulfide was also determined as described elsewhere (39Balk J. Pierik A.J. Netz D.J. Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2105-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Assay to Monitor Inorganic Phosphate—The direct colorimetric malachite green/molybdate/polyvinyl alcohol assay as described by Chan et al. (40Chan K.M. Delfert D. Junger K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) was used to monitor inorganic phosphate (Pi) release from nucleotide hydrolysis. Assays contained 0–0.34 mg of purified wild-type ApbC, 0 or 5 mm MgCl2, 0 or 200 mm KCl, 0 or 5 mm nucleotide triphosphate, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The assays were initiated by addition of ApbC. The mixture was allowed to react at room temperature for 30 min before 20 μl of the reaction mixture was removed, diluted to 250 μl with buffer A, and quickly added to 1 ml of the malachite green/molybdate/polyvinyl alcohol assay mixture. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature before sample absorbance was monitored at 630 nm in a Molecular Devices Spectra-MAX Plus microplate reader. Because of daily variation of absorbance, a standard curve containing 0–15 nmol of Pi was constructed for each set of assays. Coupled Spectrophotometric Assay for ApbC ATPase Activity—A continuous spectrophotometric assay was developed that couples ADP production with the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ (41Kreuzer K.N. Jongeneel C.V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 144-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) as shown in Reactions 2 and 3.ADP+phosphoenolpyruvate→ATP+pyruvateReaction 2 pyruvate+NADH+H+→NAD++lactateReaction 3 The assays were initiated when purified ApbC protein (10–350 μg) was added to an assay mixture containing 0.2 mm NADH, 4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0–12 mm MgCl2, 200 mm KCl, 20 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 20 units of pyruvate kinase, 0.01–10 mm ATP (stocks prepared in 1 m Tris, pH 8.0), and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The assay volume was 1 ml, and assays were conducted anaerobically in 1.5 ml of Sterna Cell cuvettes (Atascadero, CA) that had a screw cap top and rubber septum. After the addition of ApbC, the oxidation of NADH was monitored by following the absorbance change at A340 from 2 to 4 min (linear region). The linear steady-state portion of the A340 versus time plot was used to determine the Hill coefficient by fitting initial velocity data to Equation 2 (R2 ≥ 0.99),v=VmaxċS∧h/(Km∧h+S∧h)Eq. 2 where v is velocity; S is the concentration of varied substrate; Vmax is the velocity at saturating substrate; Km is the Michaelis constant for the varied substrate, and h is the Hill coefficient (labeled nH in Table 4). The kinetic parameters Vmax and Km were determined by fitting the v versus [ATP] initial velocity data to Equation 3 (R2 ≥ 0.99),v=Vmax1ċS/(Km1+S)+Vmax2ċS/(Km2+S)Eq. 3 The velocity data as plotted in the double-reciprocal form was fit by Equation 4,y=(a+bx+cx∧2)/(1+ex)Eq. 4 where the initial slope is defined as b – ae; the slope of the asymptote is c/e; the y intercept is a, and the asymptote intercept is (be – c)/e^2.TABLE 4Nucleotide specificity of ApbCNucleotide (5 mm)Pi releasenmol mg-1ATP518 ± 18ATP - Mg2+NDaNo phosphate release was detected.ATP - K+63 ± 27ATP + AMP429 ± 36ATP + ADPNDADPNDAMPNDdATP261 ± 30CTP42 ± 21GTP75 ± 15TTPNDUTPNDa No phosphate release was detected. Open table in a new tab Computational Analysis—Nonlinear and linear regression analyses and curve fitting to first-order rate laws were performed using the software SigmaPlot (version 9.0). Bioinformatic Analysis—Protein sequences were acquired from the NCBI website in FASTA format. The accession numbers for sequences used are as follows: Ind1 EAK91699; Nbp35 CAA96797.1; Cfd1, AAS56623; Hcf101, AAR97892.1, ApbC (mrp), NP_461098; and Nubp1, NP_002475.2. Sequence alignments were performed using the Clustal_W function of the Lasergene software by DNAstar, Madison, WI. Default settings were used, including the Gonnet Series for Protein Weight Matrix, gap penalty of 10, and a gap length penalty of 0.2. Selected regions of sequences were used to give the best alignment of the similar regions. The protein sequences for the proteins used in Fig. 1 were acquired in FASTA format from the NCBI Protein Sequence Data Base. The ApbC amino acid sequence was used as the input for the three-dimensional Jigsaw version 2.0 Comparative Modeling Server by Cancer Research UK using the automatic mode (42Bates P.A. Kelley L.A.

Protein Sequence Alignments Show Significant Conservation of Protein Sequence within the ApbC/Nbp35 Subfamily of ParA Homologs—The ApbC/Nbp35 subfamily proteins show a high degree of conservation in their central and C-terminal domains. Representative members of the ApbC/Nbp35 family are shown in Fig. 1. The N-terminal 100 amino acids of bacterial ApbC are sparsely conserved in the plant homolog HCF101, yeast Nbp35, human Nubp1, and mitochondrial Ind1 and therefore are not included in the alignments. The N-terminal extension is missing in yeast Cfd1. The N-terminal region of ApbC showed no similarity to characterized functional domains of the N-terminal extension found in ParA and ParA homologs (25Lutkenhaus J. Sundaramoorthy M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The central and C-terminal domains of these proteins contain two highly conserved domains as follows: the Walker A box for ATP binding/hydrolysis, and a CXXC motif in the C-terminal third of the protein. In Fig. 1 the Walker A box, conserved Cys residues, and conserved Ser are boxed for clarity. All six of these proteins are thought to be involved in [Fe-S] cluster metabolism (29Lezhneva L. Amann K.

In Vivo Function of ApbC Is Abolished by Mutations in the Walker A Motif, CXXC Motif, and a Conserved Serine—A number of mutant alleles of apbC were created using plasmid pES1, which encodes the C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged ApbC protein (17Skovran E. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Directed mutations substituted single residues to alanine in three regions of the protein (see Fig. 1) as follows: 1) deviant Walker A motif necessary for ATP binding/hydrolysis (ApbCK116A, ApbCK121A, and ApbCS122A) (28Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar); 2) conserved cysteine residues with spacing consistent with a metal-binding/thioredoxin motif (ApbCC283A and ApbCC286A) (45Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and 3) conserved serine (ApbCS182A) and nonconserved cysteine (ApbCC70A). To probe the in vivo function of ApbC variants, complementation assays were conducted examining three growth defects using two genetic backgrounds. Complementation of two of the growth defects required restoration of the low flux thiamine biosynthesis pathway (the amount of thiamine pyrophosphate in wild-type S. enterica grown in minimal glucose medium is 41.4 pmol/mg dry weight (46Enos-Berlage J.L. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 841-848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Stains lacking apbC and yggX (or purF) are thiamine auxotrophs likely because of poor cluster occupancy of ThiH/ThiC (47Leonardi R. Fairhurst S.A. Kriek M. Lowe D.J. Roach P.L.

Complementation of a third growth defect required function of the high flux tricarballylate catabolic metabolic pathway (35Boyd J.M. Lewis J.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 4596-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 37Lewis J.A. Horswill A.R. Schwem B.E. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J.

Strains lacking yggX and apbC are unable to use tricarballylate as a carbon and energy source, and presumably, this is from poor [Fe-S] cluster occupancy of TcuB (35Boyd J.M. Lewis J.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 4596-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Plasmids carrying alleles of apbC were introduced into two genetic backgrounds (apbC yggX and apbC purF) and provided the only source of apbC in the resulting strains. Each of the seven mutant alleles was tested for the ability to complement growth in both the low and high flux demand situations. The data in Table 2 show that substitutions in the Walker A (ApbCK116A, ApbCK121A, and ApbCS122A) and CXXC (ApbCC283A and ApbCC286A) motifs resulted in proteins unable to complement any of the three growth conditions. Changing the nonconserved Cys-70 to Ala had no detectable effect on in vivo function of the protein. In all cases, the empty vector and wild-type control plasmids displayed the growth patterns anticipated by past experiments (17Skovran E. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 1"
https://openalex.org/W2039130555,"Background Rickettsia conorii, the causative agent of the Mediterranean spotted fever, is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected ticks Rhipicephalus sanguineus. The skin thus constitutes an important barrier for the entry and propagation of R. conorii. Given this, analysis of the survival strategies used by the bacterium within infected skin is critical for our understanding of rickettsiosis. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we report the first genome-wide analysis of R. conorii gene expression from infected human skin biopsies. Our data showed that R. conorii exhibited a striking transcript signature that is remarkably conserved across patients, regardless of genotype. The expression profiles obtained using custom Agilent microarrays were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Within eschars, the amount of detected R. conorii transcripts was of 55%, this value being of 74% for bacteria grown in Vero cells. In such infected host tissues, approximately 15% (n = 211) of the total predicted R. conorii ORFs appeared differentially expressed compared to bacteria grown in standard laboratory conditions. These genes are mostly down-regulated and encode proteins essential for bacterial replication. Some of the strategies displayed by rickettsiae to overcome the host defense barriers, thus avoiding killing, were also pointed out. The observed up-regulation of rickettsial genes associated with DNA repair is likely to correspond to a DNA-damaging agent enriched environment generated by the host cells to eradicate the pathogens. Survival of R. conorii within eschars also involves adaptation to osmotic stress, changes in cell surface proteins and up-regulation of some virulence factors. Interestingly, in contrast to down-regulated transcripts, we noticed that up-regulated ones rather exhibit a small nucleotide size, most of them being exclusive for the spotted fever group rickettsiae. Conclusion/Significance Because eschar is a site for rickettsial introduction, the pattern of rickettsial gene expression observed here may define how rickettsiae counteract the host defense."

EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1079-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), heptameric structures (20Yu X. VanLoock M.S. Poplawski A. Kelman Z. Xiang T. Tye B.K. Egelman E.H.

Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The conflicting data regarding the structure of the M. thermautotrophicus MCM hinder our progress in elucidating the mechanism of enzyme action at the replication fork. Knowledge of the active form of the enzyme is needed to form a working and testable hypothesis regarding MCM helicase activity during the initiation and elongation phases. One would expect, for example, that a hexamer would work differently than a filament. A study was therefore initiated to determine the active form of the enzyme using different substrates and experimental conditions. These studies suggested that hexamers are the active form of the M. thermautotrophicus MCM helicase. Thus, the results presented here show that the M. thermautotrophicus helicase is similar to all other archaeal MCM helicases, which are active as hexameric rings. Labeled and unlabeled nucleotides were purchased from GE Healthcare. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the DNA facility at the Center for Advanced Research in Biotechnology. The MCM protein containing a cAMP-dependent protein kinase recognition motif was purified as described previously (22Kasiviswanathan R. Shin J.H. Kelman Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4940-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Construction and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Wild-type and mutant MCM proteins were generated by cloning the genes encoding the proteins into a vector containing a His6-MBP-TEV protease recognition site at the N terminus (23Tropea J.E. Cherry S. Nallamsetty S. Bignon C. Waugh D.S. Methods. Mol. Biol. 2007; 363: 1-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following expression in Escherichia coli, the proteins were purified on a nickel column at room temperature. The column-bound His6-MBP-MCM protein was eluted in buffer A, containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, and 300 mm imidazole. The eluted fraction was diluted 6-fold in buffer A without imidazole. His6-TEV protease was added to the protein solution, and the mixture was incubated at 22 °C for 16 h. Following digestion, the protein mixture was passed over a large-volume nickel column to remove the undigested His6-MBP-MCM, the His6-MBP, and the His6-TEV protease. The flow-through was collected, and the purified proteins were dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol and stored at -80 °C. Protein Labeling—32P labeling of MCM was performed as described previously (22Kasiviswanathan R. Shin J.H. Kelman Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4940-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using 1 nmol of protein (as monomer) in a 100-μl reaction containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 15 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 nmol of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, GE Healthcare), and 5 units of protein kinase A (Sigma) at 37 °C for 60 min. The labeled proteins were separated from the unincorporated nucleotides using a Sephadex G-50 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with reaction buffer. The specific activity was 5 cpm/fmol. DNA Helicase Assay—Substrates for helicase assay were generated as described previously (24Shin J.H. Jiang Y. Grabowski B. Hurwitz J. Kelman Z. J. Biol.

The oligonucleotides used for the studies are shown in supplemental Table 1. Helicase assays were performed as described previously in reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm ATP, 10 fmol of 32P-labeled DNA substrate, and MCM proteins as indicated in the legends for Figs. 5 and 6 and supplemental Fig. 3. Mixtures were incubated at 60 °C for 1 h. Reactions were stopped by adding 5 μl of buffer containing 0.5% SDS, 100 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 50% glycerol and then placed on ice. Aliquots were loaded onto a 4% (for the bubble substrates) or 8% (for all other helicase substrates) native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA and electrophoresed for 1 h at 150 V at 4 °C. The helicase activity was visualized and quantitated by phosphorimaging.FIGURE 6Hexameric helicase can be assembled on closed circular DNA substrate.

The column was run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 250-μl fractions were collected. The presence of the proteins was determined either by ultraviolet absorbance or by scintillation counting of the 32P-labeled proteins. All proteins were incubated at the conditions indicated below for 1 h prior to loading on the column. To determine the effect of salt on the oligomeric state of the MCM protein, gel filtration was performed at 25 °C with 100 μg of protein in 100 μl (13 μm as monomer) of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0, 0.5, or 1 m KCl. To determine the effect of temperature on the oligomeric state of the MCM protein, the gel filtration was performed with 100 μg of protein in 100 μl (13 μm as monomer) of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.5 m KCl at 4, 25, and 50 °C. Column and buffers were pre-equilibrated at the respective temperature. To determine the effect of protein concentration on the oligomeric state of MCM, the gel filtration was performed at 25 °C with 9, 27, 81, 243, or 729 mm32P-labeled MCM proteins (5 cpm/fmol) in 300 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.5 m KCl. To determine the molecular mass of wild-type and R161A mutant MCM proteins, gel filtration was performed at 25 °C with 100 μg of protein in 100 μl (13 μm as monomer) of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.1 or 1 m KCl. To study whether the MCM oligomers can change aggregation state, two gel filtration steps were performed. The first gel filtration was performed at 50 °C with 500 μg of protein in 500 μl (13 μm as monomer) of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.5 m KCl. Five hundred microliters of each protein peak in the first gel filtration were incubated for 16 h at 25 °C prior to reinjection to the column under the same buffer conditions. Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation—Glycerol gradient sedimentation studies were performed by applying 300 μg of MCM protein to a 5-ml 20-50% glycerol gradient in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.1 or 1 m KCl. After centrifugation at 40,000 rpm (150,000 × g) for 16 h in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor at 25 °C, fractions (188 μl) were collected. The distribution of the protein was determined by fractionation on 8% SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250). Molecular mass standards were analyzed under the same conditions. M. thermautotrophicus MCM Oligomerization Depends upon Temperature, Salt, and Protein Concentration—Using size exclusion chromatography, the oligomeric state of the MCM helicase under different conditions was determined. Because M. thermautotrophicus grows at 60 °C, the role of temperature on MCM structure was determined first (Fig. 1A). The gel filtration analyses were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” at 4, 25, and 50 °C. The structure of the protein at higher temperature was not evaluated due to the limitations of the ÄKTA purifier (GE healthcare) and the column used. The samples were incubated at the indicated temperature for 1 h prior to analysis on a superose-6 gel filtration column pre-equilibrated at the same temperature. As shown in Fig. 1A, at 4 °C, most of the proteins are distributed between polymer (likely filaments) and dodecameric structures. As the temperature increases, more protein is found as hexamer. It also appears that the position of the dodecamer (D) is shifted toward a smaller complex as the temperature increases (Fig. 1A). It is important to note that the resolution of gel filtration cannot resolve hexamers from heptamers or double hexamers from double heptamers. We labeled the figures as hexamers (H) and dodecamers (D), but it might also be heptamers and double heptamers. Thus, it is possible that the double heptamer (14-mer) is shifted toward a dodecamer (12-mer) as temperature increases. Alternatively, it may also be an effect of running the buffer at high temperature, although no effect was observed on the molecular weight standard. A small fraction of the protein, at all temperatures tested, eluted as expected for a monomer. Because a similar amount of protein is monomeric at all temperatures tested, this fraction is likely to represent misfolded proteins within the preparation. Next, the effect of salt on the MCM aggregation state was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” using buffer containing 0, 0.5, or 1 m KCl (Fig. 1B). Following incubation in the buffer for 1 h, the samples were run on a superose-6 gel filtration column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. Size standards were also run under the three buffer conditions because salt concentration changes the elution profile of the protein standards (supplemental Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1B, when salt concentration increases, less protein is found in large aggregation forms, polymers and dodecamers, and more as hexamer. As the salt concentration within M. thermautotrophicus is about 800 mm potassium (25Zeikus J.G. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 707-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the data presented in Fig. 1B suggest that in vivo, the protein is likely to be hexameric. After establishing that temperature and salt affect the oligomeric structure of MCM, the role of protein concentration was determined. To detect a low protein concentration, a 32P-labeled MCM protein (22Kasiviswanathan R. Shin J.H. Kelman Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4940-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was used. It was previously shown that the phosphorylation does not affect helicase activity (22Kasiviswanathan R. Shin J.H. Kelman Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4940-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As expected, at high protein concentrations, larger oligomers were observed. At 729 nm, dodecamers are the main oligomeric state. As protein concentration dropped a large fraction of the proteins form hexamers and monomers (Fig. 1C). The gel filtration studies described in Fig. 1 and summarized in supplemental Table 2 show that the M. thermautotrophicus MCM protein forms different structures under different conditions. However, protein size determination using gel filtration depends not only on the size but also on the shape of the protein. Thus, to get a more accurate size determination, a glycerol gradient sedimentation was also performed under low and high salt concentrations (Fig. 2). At low salt concentrations (0.1 m KCl), a single peak was observed at fraction 8 (Fig. 2A). At high salt concentration (1 m KCl), two peaks were observed (Fig. 2B), one at fraction 13 and the other at fraction 17. Combining the sedimentation values obtained from the glycerol gradient (Fig. 3, B and D) and the Stokes radius from gel filtration (Fig. 3, A and C) in the mass equation (26Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar) yields a native mass of 937.92 kDa for the MCM helicase at low salt (Fig. 3, A and B) and 838.72 and 462.11 kDa at high salt (Fig. 3, C and D). This is in good agreement with the expected size of the dodecameric (906.64 kDa) and hexameric (453.32 kDa) structures, respectively.FIGURE 3MCM forms dodecamers at low salt and a mixture of hexamers and dodecamers at high salt concentration. A and C, the Stokes ratios of wild-type MCM protein was determined following superose-6 gel filtration performed at 25 °C with 100 μg of protein in 100 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.1 m (A) and 1 m (C) KCl and compared with the elution profile of proteins with known Stokes radii. The proteins are: thyroglobulin (Tyr, 669 kDa, 85 Å), ferritin (Fer, 232 kDa, 61 Å), aldolase (Ald, 158 kDa, 48.1 Å), and ovalbumin (Ova, 44 kDa, 34.9 Å). The elution of MCM is marked by X. The gel filtration profile is shown in the inset in each panel. B and D, the sedimentation coefficient of wild-type MCM protein was determined following 20-50% glycerol gradient sedimentation performed at 25 °C with 300 μg of protein in 100 μl of buffer containing 20% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.1 m (B) and 1 m (D) KCl and compared with the sedimentation of proteins with known sedimentation coefficients; thyroglobulin (Tyr 669 kDa, 19.4 s), catalase (Cat, 232 kDa, 11.3 s), aldolase (Ald 158 kDa, 7.3 s), and ovalbumin (Ova 44 kDa, 3.5 s). The elution of MCM is marked by X.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fifty degrees Celsius is the upper limit at which the gel filtration column and the fast protein liquid chromatography can operate. Furthermore, when the experiments are performed at high temperature, the column has to be equilibrated with low salt buffer. When high salt was used, the column did not perform well. Therefore, the experiments were not performed at the same high temperature and high salt conditions found in vivo. Re-equilibration of the MCM Oligomeric Structure—Figs. 1 and 2 show that the MCM protein forms different oligomers under different conditions. Although the effect of protein concentration on the structure suggests that the different forms are in equilibrium a more direct experiment to demonstrate that this was performed. A gel filtration experiment that was similar to the one performed at 50 °C and described in Fig. 1A was repeated with a larger amount of protein (but at similar concentrations). The sample was run on a gel filtration column at 50 °C (Fig. 4A) with similar results as in Fig. 1A. Following gel filtration, each peak was reinjected onto the column under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 4B, each sample was re-equilibrated and formed several other oligomeric forms. As the proteins are diluted in the column and in the tubes prior to reinjection, the results suggest that the MCM structure is dynamic and in constant equilibrium. The Active Helicase Is a Hexamer—The results presented in Fig. 1 show that at high concentration (0.7 μm), the MCM helicase is mainly dodecameric, at 80 nm, it is hexameric, and below 27 nm, it is mainly monomeric. This information was used to determine the active form of the enzyme. Helicase assays were performed using different enzyme concentrations and a forked (Fig. 5A), a flat (Fig. 5B), or a duplex (Fig. 5C) substrate. As shown in Fig. 5, A-C, the helicase is not active as a monomer (Fig. 5, A-C, lanes 1-3) on all substrates studied. The enzyme is active as hexamers (Fig. 5, A-C, lanes 4-6). However, when higher protein concentrations (>243 nm) were used, the helicase activity was inhibited (Fig. 5, A-C, lanes 7 and 8). The data presented in Fig. 1C show that at these high concentrations, the helicase forms dodecamers, and thus, the results suggest not only that the hexamer is the active form but also that the dodecamer form is not active. It was shown that an Arg to Ala substitution at residue 161 (R161A) results in a protein that can only form hexamers at micromolar concentrations (27Fletcher R.J. Shen J. Gomez-Llorente Y. Martin C.S. Carazo J.M. Chen X.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42405-42410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5H). Also, in contrast to the observation with the wild-type protein, salt concentration does not affect the structure of the mutant protein (supplemental Fig. 2). Combining the Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient in the mass equation yields a native mass of 532.32 kDa for the R161A MCM at 0.1 m KCl and 492.07 kDa at 1 m KCl. This is in good agreement with the expected size of a single hexameric (453.32 kDa) or heptameric (528.87 kDa) structure. Thus, this mutant protein was used as a control for the helicase experiment described above. As shown in Fig. 5, D-F, the mutant enzyme is active even at high protein concentration (Fig. 5, D-F, lanes 7 and 8). Similar protein concentrations inhibit the activity of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 5, compare panels A-C with panels D-F, see also panel G). These results support the observation made with the wild-type enzyme that hexamers are the active form of the M. thermautotrophicus MCM helicase. Hexamers Can Be Loaded on Small, Closed Circular DNA—M. thermautotrophicus MCM can be assembled around large single-stranded plasmid DNA (13Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1530-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 14Shechter D.F. Ying C.Y. Gautier J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 49371-49377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The minimum circle size that is required for helicase assembly together with the estimated size of the helicase (15Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) can provide additional, although indirect, evidence for the minimal size of the enzyme that is active. Helicase assays were performed with substrates differing in circle size (schematically shown in Fig. 6, top). Each substrate contains two identical short 32P-labeled oligonucleotides that form two duplex regions flanking a circle structure made of varying lengths of ssDNA. Thus, unwinding of the duplex region can occur only when the helicase assembles around the ssDNA region in the circle. Based on the predicted size of the helicase (130 × 100 Å for a single hexamer (19Pape T. Meka H. Chen S. Vicentini G. van Heel M. Onesti S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1079-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)), a circle containing two 50-mer ssDNA regions should be sufficient for hexamer assembly and thus should be unwound by a hexameric helicase without steric interference. Similar calculations suggest that the minimum required circle for a dodecameric helicase to assemble on is an 80-mer ssDNA region. As shown in Fig. 6, the helicase can unwind circles made of two 50-mer oligonucleotides (Fig. 6A, lanes 11-15, see also panel B). As only hexamers can assemble around this circle, the data suggest that hexamers are sufficient for helicase activity. When smaller circles were used, no unwinding could be detected (Fig. 6A, lanes 1-10, see also panel B), demonstrating that monomers, which can assemble onto these smaller circles, are not active (as was shown in Fig. 5 with other substrates). These results support the data shown in Fig. 5 that hexamers are the active form of the M. thermautotrophicus MCM helicase. However, the data cannot rule out the possibility that a dodecameric ring could assemble and unwind a larger bubble substrate bidirectionally. Nevertheless, similar results were observed with the R161A mutant MCM (supplemental Fig. 3). In addition, similar to the results obtained with the substrates used in Fig. 5, high protein concentrations inhibit helicase activity of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 6C but not of the R161A mutant MCM (supplemental Fig. 3B)). These results are similar to those previously reported with the E. coli DnaB helicase. DnaB forms hexameric rings with a molecular mass of about 300 kDa. It was shown that a circle substrate with at least 55-bp ssDNA regions is required for helicase assembly (29Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To date, several archaeal MCM helicases have been biochemically characterized. Those include the enzymes from S. solfataricus, A. fulgidus, A. pernix, T. acidophilum, Pyrococcus furiosus, and M. thermautotrophicus. All except the M. thermautotrophicus enzyme were shown to form hexamers in solution and also to be active as hexamers. As all archaeal MCM proteins are very similar in their biochemical properties, primary amino acid sequences, and predicted structures, the discrepancies between the oligomeric structures have not been clear. The data presented here suggest that, as is the case with the MCM proteins from other archaea, the M. thermautotrophicus enzyme is also active as a hexameric ring. These observations are not only consistent with those observed with other archaeal MCM proteins but also with the observations made with DnaB, the replicative helicase of E. coli (1Yu X. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 2San Martin M.C. Stamford N.P. Dammerova N. Dixon N.E. Carazo J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 114: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and eukaryotic MCM helicase (30Adachi Y. Usukura J. Yanagida M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 31Sato M. Gotow T. You Z. Komamura-Kohno Y. Uchiyama Y. Yabuta N. Nojima H. Ishimi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The reason for the formation of dodecameric structures in solution by the M. thermautotrophicus MCM protein is not yet clear. Although the protein is similar to other archaeal enzymes, it may have a local ionic or hydrophobic patch that holds the dodecamer together at high concentration. The crystal structure shows that hydrogen bonds can form across the ring-ring interface to form the dodecameric structure when the arginine 161 is present (15Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). These interactions are abolished in the mutant protein. The hydrogen bonds between the two hexamers would also explain why salt helps to dissociate the two hexamers. However, in vitro studies do not always correlate with what occurs within the cell. Thus, it is possible that in vivo, the enzyme is active as a dodecameric ring. Future in vivo studies may address this possibility. It is well established that the hexameric helicases change their conformation upon DNA and nucleotide binding. Electron microscopic studies with the M. thermautotrophicus MCM helicase have shown structural changes upon double-stranded DNA and nucleotide binding to the protein (17Costa A. Pape T. van Heel M. Brick P. Patwardhan A. Onesti S. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic studies, however, are not reliable in determining conformational changes. It was found that under different conditions, different results were obtained. When short double-stranded DNA was used, the DNA was found in the central cavity of the M. thermautotrophicus MCM dodecamers (17Costa A. Pape T. van Heel M. Brick P. Patwardhan A. Onesti S. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas when long duplex DNA was used, the DNA was located on the surface of the hexameric ring (32Costa A. van Duinen G. Medagli B. Chong J. Sakakibara N. Kelman Z. Nair S.K. Patwardhan A. Onesti S. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2250-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Structural studies with viral and phage helicases also support the notion of large conformational changes occurring upon nucleotide and DNA binding (33Gai D. Zhao R. Li D. Finkielstein C.V. Chen X.S. Cell. 2004; 119: 47-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 34Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B.

Thus, it is possible that in the presence of ATP and/or DNA, the hexamer-heptamer equilibrium described here may also change. In the future, when the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme is determined in the presence and absence of nucleotide, this question may be addressed.

https://openalex.org/W1964801428,"Classic and novel protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes contain two zinc finger motifs, designated ""C1a"" and ""C1b"" domains, which constitute the recognition modules for the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) or the phorbol esters. However, the individual contributions of these tandem C1 domains to PKC function and, reciprocally, the influence of protein context on their function remain uncertain. In the present study, we prepared PKCdelta constructs in which the individual C1a and C1b domains were deleted, swapped, or substituted for one another to explore these issues. As isolated fragments, both the deltaC1a and deltaC1b domains potently bound phorbol esters, but the binding of [(3)H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ([(3)H]PDBu) by the deltaC1a domain depended much more on the presence of phosphatidylserine than did that of the deltaC1b domain. In intact PKCdelta, the deltaC1b domain played the dominant role in [(3)H]PDBu binding, membrane translocation, and down-regulation. A contribution from the deltaC1a domain was nonetheless evident, as shown by retention of [(3)H]PDBu binding at reduced affinity, by increased [(3)H]PDBu affinity upon expression of a second deltaC1a domain substituting for the deltaC1b domain, and by loss of persistent plasma membrane translocation for PKCdelta expressing only the deltaC1b domain, but its contribution was less than predicted from the activity of the isolated domain. Switching the position of the deltaC1b domain to the normal position of the deltaC1a domain (or vice versa) had no apparent effect on the response to phorbol esters, suggesting that the specific position of the C1 domain within PKCdelta was not the primary determinant of its activity."
https://openalex.org/W2085537538,"Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are characterized by loss of proteoglycans (PGs) and their glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains that are essential for cartilage function. Here, we investigated the role of glycosyltransferases (GTs) responsible for PG-GAG chain assembly during joint cartilage destruction and repair processes. At various times after antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) and papain-induced cartilage repair in rats, PG synthesis and deposition, expression of GTs, and GAG chain composition were analyzed. Our data showed that expression of the GT xylosyltransferase I (XT-I) gene initiating PG-GAG chain synthesis was significantly reduced in AIA rat cartilage and was associated with a decrease in PG synthesis. Interestingly, interleukin-1beta, the main proinflammatory cytokine incriminated in joint diseases, down-regulated the XT-I gene expression with a concomitant decrease in PG synthesis in rat cartilage explants ex vivo. However, cartilage from papain-injected rat knees showed up-regulation of XT-I gene expression and increased PG synthesis at early stages of cartilage repair, a process associated with up-regulation of TGF-beta1 gene expression and mediated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Consistently, silencing of XT-I expression by intraarticular injection of XT-I shRNA in rat knees prevented cartilage repair by decreasing PG synthesis and content. These findings show that GTs play a key role in the loss of PG-GAGs in joint diseases and identify novel targets for stimulating cartilage repair."

This wide tissue distribution and the high sequence identity across species strongly suggest that GEC1 has important biological functions in mammalian cells.Based on sequence similarity, GEC1 is classified as a member of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), which also include GABAA receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDa (GATE16), GABARAP-like 3 (GABARAPL3), light chain 3 (LC3) of MAP 1A/1B, and the yeast autophagy protein 8 (Atg8) (12Xin Y.

Among these homologues, GEC1 share the highest identity with GABARAPL3 (93%), followed by GABARAP (86%), GATE16 (61%), Atg8 (55%), and LC3 (∼30%).A growing body of evidence shows that this protein family is closely related to two distinct biological functions. Studies mainly on GABARAP, GATE16, and GEC1 indicate that they promote intracellular protein trafficking by enhancing vesicle fusion (10Chen C. Li J.G. Chen Y. Huang P. Wang Y. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Biol.

In addition, they facilitate degradation of proteins and intracellular organelles via autophagy-related pathways, which is bolstered largely by research on Atg8 and LC3 (22Ichimura Y. Kirisako T.

GEC1 expression enhances hKOPR expression through facilitating its anterograde trafficking along the protein biosynthesis pathway without affecting degradation of the receptor (10Chen C. Li J.G.

Our electron microscopic studies in the rat brain showed that GEC1 was associated with ER, Golgi apparatus, endosome-like vesicles, and plasma membranes and scattered in cytoplasm in neurons (14Wang Y.

In addition, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, a protein critical for intracellular membrane-trafficking events, binds directly to GEC1 (10Chen C. Li J.G. Chen Y. Huang P. Wang Y. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7983-7993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).In this study, we employed Y2H techniques to determine the amino acid residues in both GEC1 and hKOPR C-tail involved in the interaction. Further studies were then carried out in mammalian cells to examine if elimination of the interaction affected the effect of GEC1 on hKOPR expression. In addition, we generated a molecular model of GEC1 based on the x-ray crystal structure of GABARAP and found that the residues involved in hKOPR binding formed hydrophobic patches on the exterior surface of GEC1. Moreover, we found that the cytosolic tail of AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 has the same FPXXM motif as that found in the hKOPR C-tail to be involved in GEC1 binding and that GEC1 expression up-regulated GluR1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[15,16-3H]Diprenorphine (∼56 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

The cDNA constructs of HA-tagged human prostaglandin receptor EP3.f and EP3.I in pcDNA3.1 were provided by Dr. Barrie Ashby (Department of Pharmacology, Temple University, Philadelphia). Rabbit anti-GEC1 polyclonal antibody (PA629p) was generated previously (10Chen C. Li J.G. Chen Y. Huang P. Wang Y. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7983-7993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The following software products were used: Prism 3.0 program from GraphPad Software Inc. (San Diego, CA), ImageJ 1.34S from National Institutes of Health (Bethesda), and OptiQuant (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Cell LinesA clonal CHO cell line stably expressing the FLAG-hKOPR was generated previously (25Li J. Li J.-G. Chen C. Zhang F. Liu-Chen L.-Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the Bmax value of FLAG-hKOPR was ∼1.9 pmol/mg protein (26Zhang F. Li J. Li J.-G. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1184-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CHO cells with stable expression of FLAG-hKOPR-F346A (residue Phe346 replaced by Ala), FLAG-hKOPR-P347A, FLAG-hKOPR-M350A, rGluR1, HA-hEP3.f, and HA-hEP3.I were established similarly. For cells stably expressing hKOPR mutants, further screening using [3H]diprenorphine binding assay was performed to obtain cells with similar Bmax values as that of FLAG-hKOPR. All cells were cultured in 10-cm culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.2 mg/ml geneticin in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C.Transient Expression of GEC1Lipofectamine-mediated DNA transfection experiments were performed by following the manufacturer's protocol with some modifications. GEC1-pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+) was previously constructed (10Chen C. Li J.G. Chen Y. Huang P. Wang Y. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7983-7993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Twenty four hours before transfection, 1.8–2.0 million cells stably expressing FLAG-hKOPR were seeded on each 10-cm Petri dish. On the experiment day, transfection was carried out with 40 μl of Lipofectamine (1 mg/ml), 10 μg of the DNA construct or the plasmid vector (control), and 6 ml of Opti-MEM medium per 10-cm dish. At 16 h after transfection, medium was replaced by 10 ml of Opti-MEM containing 10% FBS. Forty hours following transfection, the cells were harvested for further experiments.Co-immunoprecipitation of hKOPR and GEC1-(38–117)The cDNA construct of wild-type or mutant FLAG-hKOPR or the vector pcDNA3.1 was co-transfected with HA-GEC1-(38–117) at a ratio of 5:5 (μg) into one 100-mm dish of CHO cells. Forty hours after transfection, two dishes of cells (2 × 107) were collected and solubilized in 1 ml of TTSEC (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 105 × g followed by filtration through a 0.2-μm filter. One ml of supernatant was incubated with 20 μl of anti-FLAG-agarose beads (M2, Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with TTSEC containing 1% Triton X-100 and extracted in 40 μl of loading buffer (4% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.25, and 100 mm dithiothreitol). Samples were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon (Millipore), and immunoblotting of HA-GEC1-(38–117) and FLAG-hKOPR was performed with rabbit anti-HA antibody and rabbit anti-FLAG antibody, respectively, and followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Transfection and co-immunoprecipitation of HA-GEC1-(38–117) or its mutants with FLAG-hKOPR were performed similarly. The program OptiQuant (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to analyze the immunoblotting results.[3H]Diprenorphine Binding to hKOPR in Intact CellsSamplesturation binding was performed with six concentrations of [3H]diprenorphine (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0, and 2.0 nm) and 150,000 cells/tube in duplicate in 1 ml of PBS buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 60 min. Ten μm naloxone was used to define nonspecific binding. The Kell program (known as EBDA previously) was used to analyze data and to obtain the Bmax and Kd values. Binding with ∼1 nm [3H]diprenorphine was performed with 200,000 cells/tube in a similar manner. Naloxone (10 μm) was employed to define the nonspecific binding for total receptors as described previously (10Chen C. Li J.G. Chen Y. Huang P. Wang Y. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7983-7993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).SDS-PAGE and ImmunoblottingCells were harvested using Versene buffer, solubilized in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and subjected to Tricine-SDS-PAGE on 8% separating gel as described previously (10Chen C. Li J.G. Chen Y. Huang P. Wang Y. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7983-7993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The separated protein bands were transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes on which immunoblotting was carried out with primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody, and SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent reagents (10Chen C. Li J.G. Chen Y. Huang P. Wang Y. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7983-7993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG (F7425) antibody (0.8 mg/ml, 1:5000), rabbit polyclonal anti-GluR1 antibody (1:5000) or mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1 mg/ml, 1:5000). The protein bands were visualized and then digitalized with Fuji LAS-1000 Plus gel documentation system (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Expression level of transfected GEC1 protein was evaluated by immunoblotting as described above except using 15% Tricine/SDS-PAGE, boiled (100 °C, 5 min) sample solution, and rabbit polyclonal anti-GEC1 (PA629p) antibody (0.49 μg/ml, 1:7500).Y2H AssaysThe general strategies were to use different hKOPR-C tail (334–380) or GEC1-(38–117) mutants to narrow down (truncation mutants) and then to define (double and single alanine substitution mutants) the amino acid residues that account for GEC1-hKOPR interaction. GEC1-(38–117) is a truncated GEC1, which was the form originally identified to bind the hKOPR C-tail in our previous Y2H studies (10Chen C. Li J.G. Chen Y. Huang P. Wang Y. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7983-7993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).For determining the amino acid residues in GEC1 involved in hKOPR binding, GAL4 yeast two-hybrid system was employed to evaluate interaction between GEC1 mutants and hKOPR-(334–380). GEC1 mutant cDNA was generated using PCR and inserted into the prey vector pGADT7 containing a LEU2 selection marker for yeast, which was then transformed into yeast strain Y187 that is auxotrophic for adenine (Ade), tryptophan (Trp), histidine (His), and leucine (Leu). Human KOPR-(334–380) cDNA was inserted into the bait vector pGBKT7 containing a TRP1 nutritional marker for yeast selection that was then transformed into yeast strain AH109 that is also auxotrophic for Ade, Trp, His, and Leu. After selecting transformants on SD/-Leu and SD/-Trp media, respectively, the two positive haploids were mated, and growth status of the diploids on media with different stringency was monitored and evaluated. The amino acids in hKOPR C-tail involved in GEC1 binding were determined with the same method except that the plasmid constructs of hKOPR-(334–380) mutants/pGBKT7 and GEC1-(38–117)/pGADT7 were used.Plasmid Construction for Y2H—N and C termini of GEC1-(38–117) were truncated by an increment of 10 and 2 residues via a series of PCRs. The PCR products digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and BamHI were ligated into the prey vector pGADT7. After delineating the hKOPR binding region using aforementioned GEC1-(38–117) truncation mutants, single alanine substitution mutants were generated within the 40–67 and 109–113 fragments of GEC1-(38–117) by overlap PCR to define the residues required for the GEC1-hKOPR interaction. With the same strategy, five-amino acid truncation, double and single alanine substitution mutants of hKOPR-(334–380) in pGBKT7 (NdeI/SalI) were established. All the resulting DNA plasmids were purified using QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit. DNA sequences of the inserts were verified by the University of Pennsylvania DNA sequencing facility.Transformation of Yeast Cells—Transformation of yeast with constructs was carried out using standard PEG/LiAc protocol as described in our previous publication (10Chen C. Li J.G. Chen Y. Huang P. Wang Y. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7983-7993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Mating of Yeast Cells—The two mating partner strains, Y187 and AH109, were transformed with prey (GEC1/pGADT7) and bait (hKOPR-C/pGBKT7) plasmids, respectively. Transformants were selected using the proper SD dropout medium, and the mating was conducted in 96 six-well plates. For both transformants, a single colony (2–3 mm, less than 1 month old) was suspended in 1 ml of 2× YPDA/kanamycin medium. Twenty μl each of the Y187 and the AH109 cell suspension was added to one well containing 200 μl of 2× YPDA medium with kanamycin (10 μg/ml) and mixed well. The plate was then incubated at 30 °C for 16–18 h on an orbital shaker set at 200 rpm. Mating reactions were monitored for diploid formation using phase-contrast microscope (27Soellick T.R. Uhrig J.F. Genome Biol. 2001; 2RESEARCH0052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mating culture was diluted with physiological saline and then plated in a volume of 100 μl onto SD medium with three levels of stringency: double dropout (2DO) SD/-Leu/-Trp, triple dropout (TDO) SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His, and quadruple dropout (QDO) SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His/-Ade. The plates were incubated upside-down at 30 °C for 5–7 days to obtain well separated colonies with a diameter of 1–3 mm. Dilution factor for the mating culture was adjusted so that the resulting colony number of the diploid on the 2DO plate was 200–400.Assessment of the Protein-Protein Interaction—Throughout the yeast two-hybrid assays, the mating mixture of GEC1-(38– 117)/pGADT7 and hKOPR-C(334–380)/pGBKT7 was used as the positive control and GEC1-(38–117)/pGADT7 combined with pGBKT7(-) as the negative control. Plasmid pGBKT7(-) was derived from the pGBKT7 vector of which the sequence between the NdeI site and SalI site (in the multiple cloning sites) was deleted. Five to 7 days after yeast mating, the colony number on the SD agar plates was counted using software ImageJ 1.34S. For each mating reaction, the diploid number on TDO and QDO plates was normalized against that on 2DO plate. Then the normalized numbers were compared with its counterparts in the positive control group. The protein-protein interaction between GEC1-(38–117) and hKOPR C-tail was considered to be strong (+++), moderate (++), weak (+), or absent (-) if the resulting percentages were larger than 80%, between 30 and 80%, between 5 and 30%, or less than 5%, respectively.Structural Modeling of GEC1Initial Model—Although no crystal structure of GEC1 has been published, GEC1 shares 86% identity with GABARAP. So the 1.75-Å resolution GABARAP x-ray crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1GNU) (28Knight D. Harris R. McAlister M.S. Phelan J.P. Geddes S. Moss S.J. Driscoll P.C. Keep N.H. J. Biol.

Hydrogens were added to the model using Maestro version 8.0.110 (Schrödinger, LLC, New York), with a short minimization performed to optimize the hydrogen positions. Energy minimization was performed using Macromodel version 9.5 (31Mohamadi F. Richards N.G.J. Guida W.C. Liskamp R. Lipton M. Caufield C. Chang G. Hendrickson T. Still W.C. J. Comput.

https://openalex.org/W2077299950,"Background A canonical proposition states that, in mature brain, neurons responsive to sensory stimuli are tuned to specific properties installed shortly after birth. It is amply demonstrated that that neurons in adult visual cortex of cats are orientation-selective that is they respond with the highest firing rates to preferred oriented stimuli. Methodology/Principal Findings In anesthetized cats, prepared in a conventional fashion for single cell recordings, the present investigation shows that presenting a stimulus uninterruptedly at a non-preferred orientation for twelve minutes induces changes in orientation preference. Across all conditions orientation tuning curves were investigated using a trial by trial method. Contrary to what has been previously reported with shorter adaptation duration, twelve minutes of adaptation induces mostly attractive shifts, i.e. toward the adapter. After a recovery period allowing neurons to restore their original orientation tuning curves, we carried out a second adaptation which produced three major results: (1) more frequent attractive shifts, (2) an increase of their magnitude, and (3) an additional enhancement of responses at the new or acquired preferred orientation. Additionally, we also show that the direction of shifts depends on the duration of the adaptation: shorter adaptation in most cases produces repulsive shifts, whereas adaptation exceeding nine minutes results in attractive shifts, in the same unit. Consequently, shifts in preferred orientation depend on the duration of adaptation. Conclusion/Significance The supplementary response improvements indicate that neurons in area 17 keep a memory trace of the previous stimulus properties, thereby upgrading cellular performance. It also highlights the dynamic nature of basic neuronal properties in adult cortex since repeated adaptations modified both the orientation tuning selectivity and the response strength to the preferred orientation. These enhanced neuronal responses suggest that the range of neuronal plasticity available to the visual system is broader than anticipated."
https://openalex.org/W1987378840,"p73 and p63 are members of the p53 gene family that play an important role in development and homeostasis, mainly by regulating transcription of a variety of genes. We report here that apolipoprotein D (apoD), a member of the lipocalin superfamily of lipid transport proteins, is a direct transcriptional target of the p53 family member genes. We found that the expression of apoD was specifically up-regulated by either TAp73 or TAp63 but not significantly by p53. In addition, apoD transcription is activated in response to cisplatin in a manner dependent on endogenous p73. By using small interference RNA designed to target p73, we demonstrated that silencing endogenous p73 abolishes induction of apoD transcription following cisplatin treatment. We also identified a p73/p63-binding site in the promoter of the apoD gene that is responsive to the p53 family members. The ectopic expression of TAp73 as well as the addition of recombinant human apoD to culture medium induced the osteoblastic differentiation of the human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2, as assessed by alkaline phosphatase activity. Importantly, apoD knockdown abrogated p73-mediated alkaline phosphatase induction. Moreover, TAp73-mediated apoD expression was able to induce morphological differentiation, as well as expression of neuronal markers, in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. These results suggest that apoD induction may mediate the activity of p73 in normal development. p73 and p63 are members of the p53 gene family that play an important role in development and homeostasis, mainly by regulating transcription of a variety of genes.

These proteins share a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity and major functional domains. The p53 gene, the first member of the family to be identified, is the most frequent target gene for genetic alterations in human cancers. p53 protein is present at low levels in normal cells but is activated in response to environmental stimuli, such as DNA damage, hypoxia, viral infection, or oncogene activation, resulting in transactivation of a specific set of target genes. These targets are involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, DNA replication, repair, proliferation, inhibition of angiogenesis, and cellular stress response (1El-Deiry W.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 2Tokino T. Nakamura Y. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2000; 33: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 3Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5745) Google Scholar). The other two members, p73 and p63, share high homology to p53, especially in the central DNA binding domain. Thus, p73 and p63 can bind to p53 response elements to transactivate a subset of p53 target genes and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, which suggests that the p53 family members have a potential for functional overlap with p53 itself (4Jost C.A.

Unlike p53 as a classical tumor suppressor, p73 and p63 are rarely mutated in human cancers, suggesting that the two relatives are not classical tumor suppressor genes (9Melino G. De Laurenzi V. Vousden K.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Moreover, p73 and p63 encode multiple isoforms generated by the use of a second promoter or alternative 3′-end splicing.

In contrast, the ΔN isoforms lack the p53-like transactivation domain but do in fact retain transactivation activity. The ΔN isoforms are also thought to play a role in blocking transactivation of target genes of p53 and their respective TA isoforms. In general, therefore, the TA isoforms might have a role in tumor suppression, whereas increased expressed of the ΔN isoforms might be oncogenic (for review, see Refs. 9Melino G. De Laurenzi V.

Flores et al. recently reported that p73+/–, p73–/–, and p63+/– animals die prematurely from tumors, suggesting a broader range of tumor suppressor functions for the p53 family than previously detected (13Flores E.R. Sengupta S. Miller J.B. Newman J.J. Bronson R. Crowley D. Yang A. McKeon F. Jacks T. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 363-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). p53-deficient mice develop normally (14Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Butel J.S. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (4009) Google Scholar), whereas p73-deficient mice exhibit neurological, pheromonal, and immune system defects (15Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). p63-deficient mice have major defects in their limbs and craniofacial development as well as a striking absence of stratified epithelia (16Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X.J. Vogel H. Roop D.R. Bradley A. Nature. 1999; 398: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). In humans, heterozygous germ line mutations in the p63 gene are identified in patients with ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and facial clefts syndrome (17Celli J. Duijf P. Hamel B.C. Bamshad M. Kramer B. Smits A.P. Newbury-Ecob R. Hennekam R.C. Van Buggenhout G. van Haeringen A. Woods C.G. van Essen A.J. de Waal R. Vriend G. Haber D.A. Yang A. McKeon F. Brunner H.G. van Bokhoven H. Cell. 1999; 99: 143-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), suggesting that p63 plays an essential role in epidermal development during embryogenesis. Additionally, p73α and p63α isoforms have a C-terminal region showing similarity with the sterile α motif (SAM) domain, a protein-protein interaction domain found in proteins involved in development regulation. Thus, these current data suggest that p73 and p63 are mainly involved in normal development and differentiation (for review, see Refs. 10Yang A. McKeon F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 11Irwin M.S. Kaelin W.G. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 337-349PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yang A. Kaghad M. Caput D. McKeon F. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 90-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). These differences among the p53 family probably depend on activation or repression of different sets of target genes.In the context of this background, identifying the novel specific targets of p73 and p63 is an important step to better understand the roles of these genes in normal development. It also remains to be determined how different stimuli selectively recruit one or more members of the p53 family to achieve specialized transcriptional responses in specific cellular contexts. Here, we report the identification of apolipoprotein D (apoD) as a direct transcriptional target of the p53 family members p73 and p63. ApoD is a 29-kDa glycoprotein primarily associated with high density lipoproteins in human plasma and is a member of the lipocalin family, based on its primary structure. Current evidence suggests that apoD plays an important role in the homeostasis or housekeeping functions of all organs. The apoD gene is expressed in many tissues, with high levels of expression in the spleen, testis, and brain. Although one of the functions of apoD is likely to be the transport of hydrophobic ligands, its physiological ligands are unknown. A marked up-regulation of apoD synthesis has been observed during nerve regeneration. ApoD may, therefore, participate in maintenance and repair within the central and peripheral nervous systems. Although its role in metabolism has yet to be defined, apoD is probably a multiple-ligand, multifunctional transporter (for review, see Refs. 18Weech P.K. Provost P. Tremblay N.M. Camato R.N.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar).Chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays demonstrated that TAp73 or TAp63 protein bind directly to the promoter region of the apoD gene, implying p73/p63-dependent transcriptional activity. We found that TAp73β-mediated apoD induction can enhance osteoblastic differentiation of human osteosarcoma cells and terminal differentiation of human neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, TAp73-mediated apoD expression was able to inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Taken together, our data reveal a role for TAp73 in the regulation of the apoD function involved in cellular differentiation and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Recombinant Adenovirus—The human cancer cell lines used in this study were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection or the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (Osaka, Japan). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared according to standard methods (20Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar) from day 9.5 embryos and were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. The generation, purification, and infection procedures of replication-deficient recombinant adenoviruses containing p53 (Ad-p53), TAp73α (Ad-p73α), TAp73β (Ad-p73β), TAp63γ (Ad-p63γ), and TAp63α (Ad-p63α) genes or the bacterial lacZ gene (Ad-lacZ) were described previously (21Ishida S. Yamashita T. Nakaya U. Tokino T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 2000; 91: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Sasaki Y. Morimoto I. Ishida S. Yamashita T. Imai K. Tokino T. Gene Ther. 2001; 8: 1401-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We titered adenovirus for the duplicate samples to confirm the reproducibility of the experiments. The relative efficiency of adenovirus infection was determined by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining of cells infected with a control Ad-lacZ. 90–100% of the cells could be infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 25–100 (data not shown).Immunoblot Analysis—The primary antibodies used for immunoblotting in this study are as follows: mouse anti-human p53 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (DO-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); mouse anti-human p73 mAb (ER-15 (Oncogene Research), 5B429 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and EP436Y (Epitomics)); mouse anti-human p63 mAb (4A4, Oncogene Research); mouse anti-human p21 mAb (EA10; Oncogene Research); mouse anti-human apoD mAb (36C6; Novocastra); mouse anti-human GAP-43 mAb (GAP-7B10; Sigma); rabbit anti-human p27 polyclonal antibody (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and mouse anti-human actin mAb (Chemicon). Whole cell lysates were prepared by scraping cell monolayers into radioimmune precipitation buffer without SDS (containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), protease and phosphatase inhibitors, 5 mg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm NaF, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate). Protein concentrations were quantitated (Lowry reagent; Bio-Rad). Equal protein quantities were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore).Microarray—Total RNA was isolated from adenovirus-infected Saos-2 human osteosarcoma cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). U133 plus 2.0 GeneChip, which contains oligonucleotides representing 47,000 unique human transcripts, was purchased from Affymetrix. Experimental procedures were performed according to the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual. Washes and staining of the arrays were performed with an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450, and images were obtained using an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000. Initial analysis and quality assessment of the array data were performed using GeneChip Operating Software version 1.1. Microarray data has been deposited into NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (available on the World Wide Web) and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE13504.Northern Blot and Semiquantitative RT-PCR—For Northern blot analysis, total RNA (10 μg) was electrophoretically separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). RNA was visualized with ethidium bromide to ensure that it was intact and loaded in equal amounts and to confirm proper transfer. Hybridization was performed as described previously (23Sasaki Y. Ishida S. Morimoto I. Yamashita T. Kojima T. Kihara C. Tanaka T. Imai K. Nakamura Y. Tokino T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 719-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). cDNA probes for apoD (nucleotides 464–981) and p21 (nucleotides 11–429) were amplified by RT-PCR and were sequenced to verify their identity. For semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis, cDNAs were synthesized from 5 μg of total RNAs with the SuperScript preamplification system (Invitrogen). The RT-PCR exponential phase was determined within 20–30 cycles to allow semiquantitative comparisons among cDNAs from identical reactions. The PCR conditions involved an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles (for apoD) or 25 cycles (for GAPDH) of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. Oligonucleotide primer sequences were as follows: human TA-p73 sense (5′-CACCTGGAGGGCATGACTAC-3′), human ΔN/ΔN′p73 sense (5′-ACCATGCTGTACGTCGGTGAC-3′), human p73 antisense (5′-TTGCCTTCCACGCGGATGAG-3′), mouse p73 sense (5′-GAGCACCTGTGGAGTTCTCTAGAG-3′), mouse p73 antisense (5′-GGTATTGGAAGGGATGACAGGCG-3′), human apoD sense (5′-GGCCAACTACTCACTAATGGAAA-3′), human apoD antisense (5′-GGTAGGGCATGGTTACATGTTTA-3′), mouse apoD sense (5′-CTTCACCACAGCCAAAGGAC-3′), mouse apoD antisense (5′-CGGGCAGTTCGCTTGATCTG-3′), human and mouse GAPDH sense (5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′), and human and mouse GAPDH antisense (5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′). The PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels.RNA Interference—Four human p73 siRNAs (si-p73-1 (5′-AAUGCUCUGUAACCCUUGGGAGGUG-3′), si-p73-2 (5′-AAGACGUCCAUGCUGGAAUCCGUUC-3′), si-p73-3 (5′-UUACACAUGAAGUUGUACAGGAUGG-3′), and si-p73-4 (5′-CGGAUUCCAGCAUGGACGUdTdT-3′)), human APOD siRNAs (5′-AAAUUCUCCUGCACCGGAGGAUUGG-3′, 5′-UCACCUUCGAUUUGAUUCACAGUUC-3′, and 5′-AUAGUUCUCAUAGUCGGUGGCCAGG-3′), two mouse p73 siRNAs (si-mp73-1 (5′-UGAGAUCUUGAUGAAAGUCAA) and si-mp73-2 (5′-CCCACUCUUGAAGAAGUUGUA-3′)), and nonspecific control siRNA (nonspecific control VII; target sequence 5′-NNACTCTATCGCCAGCGTGAC-3′) were purchased from Invitrogen or Qiagen and used according to the manufacturer's protocols. 1 × 105 cells were plated per well in 6-well plates with 2 ml of medium in each well. The following day, siRNAs were transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) to a final RNA concentration of 50 nm/well. Transfection was repeated 24 h later, and a DNA-damaging agent was added to the cells 6 h after the last transfection.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were performed as described (23Sasaki Y. Ishida S. Morimoto I. Yamashita T. Kojima T. Kihara C. Tanaka T. Imai K. Nakamura Y. Tokino T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 719-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). 2 × 106 cells were cross-linked with a 1% formaldehyde solution for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were then lysed in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer and sonicated to generate 300–800-bp DNA fragments. After centrifugation, the cleared supernatant was diluted 10-fold with the ChIP dilution buffer and split into three equal portions; one was incubated with the specific antibody (5 μg; DO-1 for p53, ER-15 for p73, and 4A4 for p63) at 4 °C for 16 h, and the other two portions were used as controls (anti-FLAG antibody and no antibody). One-fiftieth volume of total extract was used for PCR amplification as an input control. Immune complexes were precipitated, washed, and eluted as recommended. DNA-protein cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4 h, and the DNA fragments were purified and dissolved in 40 ml of TE. Two microliters of each sample were used as a template. PCR amplification of the consensus p53-binding sequence upstream of the apoD gene (–419, renamed the RE-APOD) was performed on immunoprecipitated chromatin using the specific primers 5′-AGTCAGGAACTCCATGTTCCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACAGCTGCTCCCTGAAGAAG-3′ (reverse). Amplifications were also performed on immunoprecipitated chromatin using the specific primers 5′-CCTGTGTGCAGCATCCTCTCTTTTC-3′ and 5′-CTCACTGCAACCTCTGCCTCCC-3′ for intron 2 of the apoD gene or 5′-GTTCAGTGGGCAGGTTGACT-3′ and 5′-GCTACAAGCAAGTCGGTGCT-3′ for the MDM2 promoter containing a p53-binding sequence. To ensure that PCR amplification was performed in the linear range, template DNA was amplified for a maximum of 30 cycles. PCR products generated from the ChIP template were sequenced to verify the identity of the amplified DNA.Luciferase Assay—A 40-bp fragment of the response element for p73, RE-APOD (5′-ATACCAGATGTTTGAAAACATGTTGCAACACGTCCTGCTG-3′) and its mutant form RE-APOD-mut (5′-ATAACATATGTTTGAAAAAATTTTGCAACACGTACTTCTG-3′), were synthesized and inserted upstream of a minimal promoter in the pGL3-promoter vector (Promega), and the resulting constructs were designated pGL3-RE-APOD and pGL3-RE-APOD-mut, respectively. Subconfluent cells in 24-well plates were transfected with 2 ng of pRL-TK reporter (Renilla luciferase for internal control) and 100 ng of pGL3 reporter (firefly luciferase, experimental reporter), together with 100 ng of a pcDNA3.1 control vector (Invitrogen) or a vector that expresses p53, TAp73α, TAp73β, or TAp63γ by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the reporter gene activities were measured by a dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times.Conditioned Medium—To obtain conditioned medium lacZ-CM and p73β-CM, SW480 cells were infected with Ad-LacZ and Ad-p73β at an MOI of 100, respectively. After 8 h, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were rinsed twice with serum-free DMEM. Fresh serum-free DMEM was then added, and cells were incubated for 16 h. Their conditioned media were collected and centrifuged to remove debris. For immunoblot analysis, the supernatant was concentrated using a Centricon YM-10 concentrator (Millipore).ALP Activity—ALP activity was determined using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate (24Kobayashi D. Takita H. Mizuno M. Totsuka Y. Kuboki Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Total cell lysates or culture medium were assayed for ALP activity using LabAssay ALP (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan). Enzyme activity assay was performed in assay buffer containing 6.7 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.2 n NaOH, and absorbance was read on an optical densitometer at 405 nm using a plate reader. Relative ALP activity is defined as mmol of p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolyzed/min per mg of total protein or per ml of medium.Differentiation of Neuroblastoma Cells—To assess the differentiated phenotype in vitro, SH-SY5Y cells (1 × 105 cells) were seeded into 12-well plates. After 24 h, cells were incubated with lacZ-CM or p73β-CM with 0.5% fetal calf serum. Recombinant human apoD protein (200 ng/ml; Abcam) was added to the medium of some cultures. The conditioned medium was renewed every 24 h for up to 3 days, cells were then examined under a ×40 objective lens, and images were recorded using a CCD camera VB-7000 (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). Cell differentiation was also assessed by immunoblot analysis of GAP-43 and p27.Colony Formation Assay—For colony formation assays, 5 × 103 cells were plated in triplicate in 60-mm tissue culture plates. After 16 h, the cells were incubated with the conditioned medium lacZ-CM or p73β-CM for 48 h. When necessary, recombinant human apoD protein (100 ng/ml) was added to the medium. After 2 weeks, colonies were fixed and stained. The percentage of colony survival was determined from the number of colonies remaining in the treated groups divided by the number of colonies in the control group. The assay was repeated in at least three independent experiments.Statistical Analysis—Experimental data were evaluated using Student's t test, with probability values less than 0.05 considered significant.RESULTSTAp73 and TAp63 Induce Expression of ApoD mRNA and Protein—To express the human p53 family genes, we generated replication-deficient recombinant adenoviral vectors Ad-p53, Ad-p73α, Ad-p73β, Ad-p63γ, and Ad-p63α for the p53, TAp73α, TAp73β, TAp63γ, and TAp63α genes, respectively. To determine the relative efficiency of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, cells were infected with adenovirus containing the bacterial lacZ gene (Ad-lacZ). We used several human cancer cell lines that showed highly efficient gene transfer, with 90–100% of the cells staining for β-galactosidase activity at an MOI of 25–100. Infection with Ad-p53, Ad-p73α, Ad-p73β, Ad-p63γ, and Ad-p63α resulted in expression of exogenous p53, TAp73α, TAp73β, TAp63γ, and TAp63α proteins, respectively (e.g. see Fig. 1A). We mainly used TAp73β and TAp63γ isoforms in this study, because we and others have demonstrated that transcription of a p53 response reporter gene was activated more strongly in TAp73β than in TAp73α and more strongly in TAp63γ than TAp63α, respectively (5Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D.

Gene Ther. 2001; 8: 1401-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify targets specifically regulated by p73, we performed microarray analysis and compared expression patterns in a human osteosarcoma cell line, Saos-2, infected separately with Ad-p53 and Ad-p73β (data not shown). Using this approach, we found that the apoD gene was reproducibly upregulated at least 4-fold in p73-transfected cells relative to p53-transfected cells. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that expression of the apoD gene was increased considerably in a time-dependent manner in A172 and DLD1 cells by infection with Ad-p73β but was not significantly induced by infection with Ad-p53 (Fig. 1B). The apoD induction was observed as early as 12 h after Ad-p73β infection. In contrast, the p21 gene was induced by p53 as well as by its family members (Fig. 1B). Moreover, we examined the effect of transduction of p73 in five human cancer cell lines, including A172, SW480 (colorectal cancer), Saos-2 (osteosarcoma), U373 (glioma), and MKN28 (stomach cancer). The status of the endogenous p53 gene in these lines is mutant for SW480, DLD1, U373, and MKN28; wild type for A172; and p53 null for Saos2. As shown in Fig. 1C, apoD mRNA was clearly induced by TAp73β in all cell lines tested but not significantly by p53. Although apoD was still induced in response to TAp73α in four of the five cell lines tested (A172, SW480, U373, and MKN28), the degree of induction was less remarkable than that of the TAp73β isoform. In contrast, p53 induced p21 significantly in all cell lines tested (Fig. 1C, middle).To determine whether the increase in apoD mRNA was accompanied by an increase in protein expression, we then examined the level of apoD protein by immunoblot using an antibody against human apoD. Fig. 2A shows increased total cellular apoD protein in p73-transfected cells. Furthermore, an ∼30-kDa protein was detected by immunoblotting with antibodies against human apoD in a CM used for SW480 cells transfected with p73 (Fig. 2B), showing that exogenous p73 induced secreted apoD protein in SW480 cells. Altogether, the results presented here suggest that the apoD gene is a specific target of p53 family members, particularly p73.FIGURE 2Induction of apoD protein by p53 family members in human cancer cell lines. A, cells were infected with adenovirus as described above and harvested 24 h after infection. Immunoblot analysis was performed using an anti-apoD antibody. B, secreted apoD protein in conditioned media. 2 × 106 SW480 cells were infected with adenovirus at an MOI of 100, as described above. After 8 h, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were rinsed twice with serum-free DMEM. Fresh serum-free DMEM was then added, cells were incubated for 16 h, and the media were collected and centrifuged to remove debris. The supernatant was concentrated for immunoblot analysis. The blot was probed with an anti-apoD antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ApoD Expression Is Regulated by Endogenous p73—The effect of p53 family members on apoD induction shown above was based on their overexpression. We then addressed whether this effect could occur under more physiological conditions in noncancerous HEK293 cells using double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides (siRNA) corresponding to a part of the p73 cDNA sequence. p73 siRNAs used here were designed to target all p73 isoforms. An siRNA lacking sequence homology with any human or mouse gene was used as a control siRNA (sicont). The TA isoforms of p73 were prominently expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3A). HEK293 cells were transfected with p73 siRNAs every 24 h for three consecutive days. Both mRNA and protein levels of p73 were significantly reduced in cells transfected with p73 siRNAs (Fig. 3A). We then evaluated the expression of apoD after treatment with p73 siRNAs. apoD transcript levels were significantly reduced in the p73-silenced HEK293 cells when compared with mock or si-cont-transfected cells (Fig. 3A). Similar results were observed for MEF"
https://openalex.org/W2016764773,"FKBP36 has been previously shown to be a crucial factor in spermatogenesis because of its interplay with the synaptonemal complex protein SCPI. Here we show that beyond this function, FKBP36 forms complexes with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; EC 1.2.1.12) and Hsp90. Both proteins bind independently to different sites of the FKBP36 tetratricopeptide repeat domain. The interaction between FKBP36 and GAPDH directly inhibits the catalytic activity of GAPDH. In addition, FKBP36 expression causes a significant reduction of the GAPDH level and activity in COS-7 cells. Particularly in the cytosolic fraction, GAPDH was depleted by FKBP36 expression. Thus, FKBP36 diminishes GAPDH activity by direct interaction and down-regulation of GAPDH, which represents a previously unknown mechanism of GAPDH regulation and a novel function of FKBP36 in testis-specific signaling. FKBP36 has been previously shown to be a crucial factor in spermatogenesis because of its interplay with the synaptonemal complex protein SCPI. Here we show that beyond this function, FKBP36 forms complexes with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; EC 1.2.1.12) and Hsp90. Both proteins bind independently to different sites of the FKBP36 tetratricopeptide repeat domain. The interaction between FKBP36 and GAPDH directly inhibits the catalytic activity of GAPDH. In addition, FKBP36 expression causes a significant reduction of the GAPDH level and activity in COS-7 cells. Particularly in the cytosolic fraction, GAPDH was depleted by FKBP36 expression. Thus, FKBP36 diminishes GAPDH activity by direct interaction and down-regulation of GAPDH, which represents a previously unknown mechanism of GAPDH regulation and a novel function of FKBP36 in testis-specific signaling. FKBP36 (FK506-binding protein 36; FKBP6) belongs to the human immunophilins and is predominantly found in testes. FKBP6 was initially identified as one of the genes on chromosome 7 whose deletion is linked to Williams-Beuren syndrome (1Meng X. Lu X. Morris C.A. Keating M.T. Genomics. 1998; 52: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Williams-Beuren syndrome is a dominant autosomal disorder, which may include supravalvular aortic stenosis, multiple peripheral pulmonary arterial stenoses, elfin face, mental and statural deficiency, characteristic dental malformation, and infantile hypercalcemia (2Tassabehji M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: R229-R237Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).FKBP36 is predominantly expressed in testes and plays an important role in spermatogenesis. The loss of FKBP36 causes a significant reduction of the size of testes and the infertility of male mice. The testis-specific FKBP was identified as a component of the synaptonemal complex, which forms between two homologous chromosomes during meiosis (3Crackower M.A. Kolas N.K. Noguchi J. Sarao R. Kikuchi K. Kaneko H. Kobayashi E. Kawai Y. Kozieradzki I. Landers R. Mo R. Hui C.C. Nieves E. Cohen P.E. Osborne L.R. Wada T. Kunieda T. Moens P.B. Penninger J.M. Science. 2003; 300: 1291-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The synaptonemal complex participates in chromosome pairing, synapsis, and recombination (4Page S.L. Hawley R.S. Science. 2003; 301: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar).FKBP36 contains an N-terminal peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase domain and three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) 3The abbreviations used are: TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; GA-3-P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FKBP, FK506-binding protein; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight.3The abbreviations used are: TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; GA-3-P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FKBP, FK506-binding protein; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. motifs in its C-terminal segment. Furthermore, FKBP36 displays a high sequence homology to the regulated FKBP38, and the absence of FKBP36 activity might suggest a similar activation scenario (5Edlich F. Erdmann F. Jarczowski F. Moutty M.C. Weiwad M. Fischer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15341-15348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The TPR domains of FKBP38, FKBP51, and FKBP52 have been shown to interact with the heat shock protein Hsp90 (5Edlich F. Erdmann F. Jarczowski F. Moutty M.C. Weiwad M. Fischer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15341-15348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 6Pirkl F. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The interactions between the different FKBPs and Hsp90 are mediated by the Hsp90 C90 domain. Complexes of FKBP51 and FKBP52 with Hsp90 have been reported to interact with client molecules, e.g. steroid hormone receptors, to modify the activity, stability, or subcellular localization of the client proteins (7Pratt W.B. Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. DeFranco D.B. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Within these complexes, the FKBPs interact with both the receptor and Hsp90 (8Smith D.F. Baggenstoss B.A. Marion T.N. Rimerman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18365-18371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study, we show that FKBP36 interacts with Hsp90 via the TPR domain. A second binding site in the TPR domain of FKBP36 mediates the interaction with GAPDH, leading to GAPDH-FKBP36-Hsp90 complexes, which are comparable to complexes formed by other TPR-containing immunophilins. Furthermore, our experiments showed that FKBP36 controls GAPDH activity either by direct interference with binding of the coenzyme NAD+ or down-regulation of GAPDH levels. Hence, FKBP36 represents a novel non-metabolic and multifunctional inhibitor of GAPDH.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSources of enzymes used in the experiments, recombinant human FKBP36 and recombinant human Hsp90 C90 (Hsp90627–731), were recombinantly expressed by using a pET28a vector in Escherichia coli Rosetta™ cells. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion FKBP36 variants were expressed by using a pGEX4T1 vector in E. coli Rosetta™ cells. The C-terminal Hsp90 peptides Hsp90C20 (Hsp90712–731, PDEIPPLEGDEDASRMEEVD), Hsp90C7 (Hsp90725–731, SRMEEVD), and Hsp90C5 (Hsp90727–731, MEEVD) were produced by solid-phase synthesis using the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy.Rabbit muscle GAPDH was purchased from Sigma. The FKBP36 antibody was a section 4 polyclonal antibody from rabbit against purified FKBP36. Additional antibodies used were polyclonal rabbit anti-actin (Sigma), monoclonal mouse anti-His5 (Qiagen), monoclonal mouse anti-GST (Sigma), monoclonal rat anti-Hsp90 (Stressgen), polyclonal rabbit anti-GAPDH (Sigma), and polyclonal rabbit anti-H3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). MG115, NAD+, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GA-3-P) were obtained from Sigma.GAPDH Activity Assay—GAPDH activity was measured with an HP 8452A spectrophotometer by following the reduction of NAD+ at 340 nm. The reaction mixture in a volume of 1.5 ml contained 10 mm sodium arsenate, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl (pH 8.5).Unless mentioned otherwise, 25 μl of COS-7 crude cell extract, 1 mm NAD+, and 1 mm GA-3-P were used in all assays. One unit of enzyme activity is expressed as the amount of enzyme that forms 1 μmol of NADH/min at 25 °C.Protein Interaction Assays—For GSH-Sepharose-binding assay, 30-μl volume of GSH-Sepharose was pre-equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol and saturated with GST or GST fusion proteins. The beads were then washed twice with buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and subsequently incubated for 2 h with 100 μl of rat testis cytoplasm. In some experiments, 50 μm Hsp90 C90 or 1 mm NAD+, NADH + H+, GA-3-P, or arsenate was added. Beads were centrifuged, washed three times, and mixed with an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were then subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal mouse anti-His5 (Pharmingen), monoclonal mouse anti-GST, monoclonal rat anti-Hsp90 (Stresgen), and polyclonal rabbit anti-GAPDH antibody.Co-immunoprecipitation was performed with 5 ml of rat testis cytosol (pre-cleaned with 200 μl of Protein G-Sepharose™ 4 Fast Flow for 1 h at 4 °C). The samples (3 × 1.5 ml) were subjected to 5 μg of polyclonal goat anti-Hsp90 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 5 μg of polyclonal goat anti-GAPDH antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or buffer, respectively. After a 3-h pre-incubation at 4 °C, Protein G Sepharose™ 4 Fast Flow (50 μl) (GE Healthcare) was added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 min, washed five times with 200 μl of buffer B, boiled with 50 μl of sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting.Cell Culture—For FKBP36 expression, transformed African green monkey kidney fibroblast cells (COS-7 line) (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany) were used. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 10% (v/v) CO2. COS-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA-FKBP36 and seeded at 5 × 106 cells/ml in 6-well plates.To analyze GAPDH proteasomal degradation, COS-7 cells were transfected with either pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA-FKBP36 constructs. After 48 h, cells were treated with 0, 25, and 50 μm MG115 for 5 h. Subsequently, cells were harvested and analyzed by Western blot.To prepare COS-7 crude cell extract, cells were harvested and centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 × g, and cell pellets were resuspended in the same volume of hypotonic lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, (pH 7.4), 20 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Triton X-100), followed by sonication. The crude extract was centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g. The pellet was used for the preparation of nuclei (9Blobel G. Potter V.R. Science. 1966; 154: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). The supernatant was centrifuged again for 45 min at 100,000 × g to prepare cytosol and membrane fractions. The preparation of rat testis cytoplasm was described previously (10Zakeri Z.F. Wolgemuth D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1791-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).RESULTSFKBP36 Interacts with GAPDH and Hsp90—The TPR domains of several immunophilins have been shown to mediate interactions with Hsp90 (7Pratt W.B. Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. DeFranco D.B. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Hence, we tested whether FKBP36 is able to interact with Hsp90 as well.We performed a GST pulldown experiment loading GST-FKBP36 on GSH-Sepharose and applying rat testis lysate to the matrix. Several endogenous proteins from rat testis cells bound to the FKBP36 affinity matrix, Hsp90, Hsp70, tubulin, actin, GAPDH, and GST (Fig. 1A), as identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (data not shown). However, Hsp70, tubulin, and actin were also found in the control experiment using only a GST matrix. Thus, only Hsp90 and GAPDH can be considered as specific binders of FKBP36. To confirm these results, a second interaction assay was performed using FKBP36 with Strep-Tag II fusion immobilized on a StrepTactin matrix. The FKBP36-affinity matrix was incubated with rat-testis lysate in parallel to the previous experiment, and bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GAPDH and anti-Hsp90 antibodies (Fig. 1B). GAPDH and Hsp90 only interacted with the FKBP36 affinity matrix, whereas no binding was observed to the matrix alone.The FKBP36 TPR Domain Binds GAPDH and Hsp90—To test whether FKBP36 binds directly to GAPDH, we made use of purified GAPDH from rabbit muscle, which was previously utilized in several similar studies (11Kragten E.

Fig. 2A shows that GAPDH bound specifically to FKBP36, demonstrating direct interaction between both proteins.FIGURE 2The FKBP36 TPR domain binds GAPDH and Hsp90. A, direct binding between FKBP36 and GAPDH was investigated by incubation of purified GAPDH from rabbit muscle with GST-FKBP36- or GST-pre-loaded GSH-Sepharose. The samples were analyzed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (12.5%). Samples without GAPDH served as a control. B, binding of GAPDH and Hsp90 to different domains of FKBP36 was tested by incubation of rat testis lysate with GSH-Sepharose pre-loaded with different GST-FKBP36 variants or GST alone. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-Hsp90 and anti-GAPDH antibodies. Eluted GST and GST-FKBP36 variants were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-GST antibodies (lower panel). C, endogenous GAPDH and Hsp90 from rat testis lysate bound to GSH-Sepharose loaded with GST-FKBP36 variants was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-Hsp90 and anti-GAPDH antibodies. The Western blot analysis of eluted GST-FKBP36 variants using anti-GST antibodies is displayed in the lower panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, several GST-FKBP36 variants were applied to GSH-Sepharose and incubated with rat testis lysate to investigate which segment of FKBP36 mediates the interaction with GAPDH. Western blot analysis using anti-GAPDH antibody showed that GAPDH bound only to the full-length FKBP36 and to the FKBP36145–327 variant containing the three TPR motifs (Fig. 2B) and a C-terminal segment.A similar interaction pattern was observed for Hsp90 using the different FKBP36 variant affinity matrices. Thus, the C-terminal FKBP36 segment, which contains the three TPR motifs, interacts with both Hsp90 and GAPDH. Further experiments using a FKBP36 variant lacking the C-terminal extension were carried out to investigate the contribution of the FKBP36 C terminus to the interaction with either GAPDH or Hsp90. Fig. 2C shows that both GAPDH and Hsp90 bound similarly to the FKBP36 variants independent of the presence of the C-terminal FKBP36 extension. Hence, only the FKBP36 segment that contains the TPR motifs mediates the interactions with GAPDH and Hsp90.The Hsp90 MEEVD Segment and GAPDH Interact with Different Binding Sites in the FKBP36 TPR Domain—Given the interaction between the FKBP36 TPR domain and Hsp90, we tested if this interaction is mediated by the C90 domain of Hsp90 in parallel to other immunophilin-Hsp90 complexes. To this end, we incubated FKBP36 with either a C90-GST affinity matrix or a GST matrix (Fig. 3A). Indeed, the C90 domain sufficed to interact with FKBP36. Hence, the interaction between FKBP36 and Hsp90 is mediated by the TPR domain and the C90 domain similar to other FKBP-Hsp90 complexes.FIGURE 3GAPDH and Hsp90 bind to different interaction sites in the FKBP36 TPR domain. A, binding of recombinant FKBP36 and FKBP52 to GST-Hsp90C90- or GST-pre-loaded GSH-Sepharose was analyzed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (12.5%) of supernatant (S) and pellet (P). A sample without FKBP served as a control. B, interaction between endogenous Hsp90 from rat testis lysate and FKBP36-pre-loaded GSH-Sepharose in the presence of different segments derived from the Hsp90 C terminus was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Hsp90 antibodies. Loaded GST-FKBP36 was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-GST antibodies (lower panel). C, far-UV CD spectrum of FKBP36 and the Hsp90 C90 domain either separated (○) or mixed (•) in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). Changes in the minimum at 208.5 nm are displayed in the inlay. mdpg; millidegrees. D, the influence of GAPDH and Hsp90 on the interactions between FKBP36 and both proteins was examined by incubating rat-testes cell lysate with GST-FKBP36-loaded GSH-Sepharose in the absence or presence of Hsp90 C90 or purified GAPDH from rabbit muscle cells. Input and eluate were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequently analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Hsp90 and anti-GAPDH antibodies. The presence of Hsp90 C90 was analyzed using anti-His5 antibodies. E, the presence of GAPDH-FKBP36-Hsp90 complexes was studied by co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins from rat testis cytosol using goat anti-Hsp90 or goat anti-GAPDH antibodies. Antibody-protein complexes were bound to Protein G Sepharose. After washing precipitates, input and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using rat anti-Hsp90 antibody, rabbit anti-GAPDH antibody, and rabbit anti-FKBP36 antibody. As a control, cell lysate pre-incubated with Protein G-Sepharose was used. IP, immunoprecipitate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Furthermore, we investigated using a FKBP36 affinity matrix which C-terminal segments of Hsp90 can compete with endogenous rat Hsp90 and thus mediate the interaction with FKBP36. The results in Fig. 3B show that the different segments of the C90 domain including the very C-terminal MEEVD motif competed with endogenous Hsp90 from testis lysate for FKBP36 binding. Thus, the interaction between Hsp90 and FKBP36 is mediated by the C-terminal MEEVD motif of Hsp90, which is similar to previously described interactions between Hsp90 and human FKBPs.Far-UV CD spectroscopic measurements show changes in the secondary structure elements of either FKBP36 or the C90 domain because of complex formation (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, these changes of the protein ellipticity in the far-UV CD spectra were not observed for interactions between FKBP36 and the MEEVD peptide, suggesting either structural changes in the C90 domain upon FKBP36 binding or additional binding sites between Hsp90 and FKBP36.Furthermore, we analyzed whether Hsp90 and GAPDH compete for the same interaction site in the FKBP36 TPR domain or perhaps can be found together in a complex with FKBP36. Thereto, we applied purified proteins to a FKBP36 affinity matrix that was incubated with testis lysate (Fig. 3D). The presence of additional C90 domain had no effect on the binding of GAPDH to the FKBP36 affinity matrix. Further addition of purified GAPDH (5 μm) did not influence the FKBP36/Hsp90 interaction either. The lack of competition between Hsp90 and GAPDH for the TPR domain binding implies different interaction sites for both proteins in FKBP36.To analyze the presence of protein complexes containing FKBP36, GAPDH, and Hsp90 in spermatocytes, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation using cytosol from rat testis cells (Fig. 3E). Endogenous FKBP36 bound either Hsp90 or GAPDH, and in addition, Hsp90 was detected in the fraction of GAPDH-interacting proteins and vice versa, suggesting the presence of GAPDH-FKBP36-Hsp90 complexes in testis cells. Furthermore, we incubated cell lysate of COS-7 cells either expressing FKBP36 or lacking the human FKBP with a GST-Hsp90 C90 affinity matrix (supplemental Fig. 1). GAPDH only interacted with the C90 affinity matrix in the presence of FKBP36, demonstrating the requirement of FKBP36 for the formation of the trimeric complex.FKBP36 Inhibits GAPDH Activity—Next, GAPDH activity measurements were performed in the presence of FKBP36 to investigate the role of FKBP36 in complexes with GAPDH. FKBP36 had only a slight effect on GAPDH activity at 1 mm NAD+, reducing the residual activity to about 90% compared with the absence of FKBP36 (Fig. 4A). FKBP36-mediated GAPDH inhibition was not influenced by GA-3-P concentrations in the range of 0.01–1 mm. However, the inhibitory effect of FKBP36 on GAPDH activity was increased significantly at lower NAD+ concentrations of 0.01 mm. Under these conditions, FKBP36 reduced the GAPDH activity in a concentration-dependent manner to less than 40% residual activity at 2.5 μm FKBP36 with a Ki of 1.5 ± 0.45 μm. Thus, we analyzed whether FKBP36 competes with NAD+ for GAPDH binding. The Eadie-Hofstee plot (Fig. 4B) shows deviations from the linear function, which are caused by negatively cooperative NAD+ binding at four binding sites in a GAPDH tetramer (14Nagradova N.K. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2001; 66: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Meunier J.C. Dalziel K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 82: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Henis Y.I. Levitzki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5055-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The FKBP36-mediated GAPDH inhibition differs from the pattern of a competitive inhibitor by indicating different Vmax, and thus indicates a mixed form of inhibition that is not solely caused by competition with NAD+. Interactions between FKBP36 and NAD+ can be excluded because the fluorescence spectra of both FKBP36 and NAD+ remain unaltered in the presence of each other (supplemental Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, the interference of GAPDH substrates and effectors with the interaction between GAPDH and FKBP36 was tested using the FKBP36 affinity matrix (Fig. 4C). In the presence of NAD+ or NADH + H+, the amount of FKBP36-bound GAPDH was significantly reduced, which corresponds to the kinetic measurements. However, neither GA-3-P nor arsenate influenced the FKBP36/GAPDH interaction, demonstrating interference only between FKBP36/GAPDH interactions and NAD+ binding.FIGURE 4GAPDH is inhibited by FKBP36. A, activity measurements of GAPDH (60 nm) at various FKBP36 concentrations (0.25–2.5 μm). GAPDH activity is displayed in percent residual activity at 1 mm NAD+ and 1 mm GA-3-P (○), 1 mm NAD+ and 0.01 mm GA-3-P (•), and 0.01 mm NAD+ and 1 mm GA-3-P (▴). B, Eddie-Hofstee plot of residual GAPDH (1.2 μg/ml) activity and NAD+ concentration in the presence of 0 μm (•), 0.7 μm (○), 1.4 μm (▾), and 2.8 μm (▿) FKBP36. The measurements were carried out in the presence of 1 mm GA-3-P. Linear regression for measurements at 10, 25, 50, and 100 μm NAD+ is displayed as lines. C, binding of endogenous GAPDH from rat testis cell lysate to GST-FKBP36 loaded onto GSH-Sepharose in the presence of 1 mm NAD+, NADH + H+, GA-3-P, or arsenate. The GAPDH binding was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-GAPDH antibodies. The amount of FKBP36 loaded onto the matrix was analyzed by anti-GST antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FKBP36 Reduces GAPDH Levels and Activity in Cells—Next, we studied the influence of FKBP36 on endogenous GAPDH activity to get inside the physiological effect of this interaction. Thus, the testis-derived cell lines NTERA-2, F9, TM3, and TM4 were analyzed for FKBP36 and GAPDH expression levels. However, the FKBP36 levels in the different cell lines were significantly lower than in testis lysate. In the absence of a cell system reflecting the physiological FKBP36 concentration, COS-7 cells were, thus, transfected with a pcDNA-FKBP36 construct, and the GAPDH activity in transfected cells was compared with that in normal cells. Fig. 5A shows that FKBP36 reduced the GAPDH activity by about 70 units/g of total cell protein, which is 32% of the GAPDH activity in these cells. To test whether the reduction of GAPDH activity is caused by an altered GAPDH concentration or by direct inhibition because of FKBP36 binding, the GAPDH protein levels were analyzed. Interestingly, the presence of FKBP36 reduced the GAPDH protein level by about 33% in COS-7 cells based on the densitometric analysis, which is likely to be the major cause of the reduction of GAPDH activity (Fig. 5, B and C). Furthermore, COS-7 cells expressing FKBP36 were fractionized, and the GAPDH localization was compared with the pattern observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 5D). GAPDH was found in the cytosol and the membrane fraction of COS-7 cells both in presence and absence of FKBP36. However, FKBP36 expression significantly reduced the GAPDH levels in both cell fractions. In fact, the cytosolic GAPDH concentration seems to be affected in particular by FKBP36 expression.FIGURE 5FKBP36 expression reduces GAPDH protein levels in COS-7 cells. A, GAPDH activity measurements using cell lysate of either untransfected COS-7 cells or COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA-FKBP36 constructs, respectively.

C, densitometric analysis of the GAPDH levels of the Western blot analysis depicted in B. GAPDH levels are displayed as percent of endogenous protein found in untransfected COS-7 cells. Data are represented as mean ± S.D. from four replicates. *, p < 0.05. D, Western blot analysis of a cell fractionation of COS-7 cells were either transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1 FKBP36 construct using anti-FKBP36, anti-GAPDH, and anti-histone antibodies. E, influence of FKBP36 on proteasomal GAPDH degradation analyzed by treatment of pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA-FKBP36-transfected COS-7 cells with 0, 25, or 50μm MG115 for 5 h and subsequent analysis of crude cell extracts by anti-GAPDH, anti-FKBP36, and anti-β actin antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GAPDH was previously found to be degraded by the proteasome (17Buchczyk D.P. Grune T. Sies H. Klotz L.O. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed if the presence of FKBP36 increases GAPDH degradation using the proteasome inhibitor MG115. Fig. 5E shows a significant reduction of GAPDH levels in the presence of FKBP36. However, this reduction was not prevented by 50 μm MG115. On the other hand, FKBP36 was found at slightly higher levels in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor. Thus, FKBP36 does not increase the GAPDH degradation rate, but is likely reduces GAPDH expression.DISCUSSIONFKBP36 is a multifunctional immunophilin, which has been reported to interact with components of the synaptonemal complex. Here, we show interactions of this testis-specific FKBP with Hsp90 and GAPDH, suggesting additional cellular functions. The interaction between FKBP36 and the C-terminal domain of Hsp90 is mediated by its TPR domain (Figs. 2B and 3A) and is thus similar to interactions between Hsp90 and other immunophilins (e.g. FKBP52) (7Pratt W.B. Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. DeFranco D.B. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The FKBP52 residues Lys282, Lys354, and Arg358 were reported to assemble a dicarboxylate clamp, which binds the Hsp90 C-terminal MEEVD motif to form the FKBP52-Hsp90 complex (18Wu B. Li P. Liu Y. Lou Z. Ding Y. Shu C. Ye S. Bartlam M. Shen B. Rao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8348-8353Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). FKBP36 features identical residues in the corresponding positions, and the MEEVD pentapeptide was sufficient for the interaction with FKBP36 (Fig. 3C), implying a similar binding mechanism. Changes in the far-UV CD spectrum (Fig. 3C) suggest either additional binding sites between FKBP36 and Hsp90 or structural changes in the C90 domain upon FKBP36 binding. However, the competition between the MEEVD peptide suggests that the latter possibility is more likely.GAPDH also binds to the TPR domain of FKBP36, but GAPDH and Hsp90 interact with different sites in FKBP36 because both proteins do not compete for FKBP36 binding (Fig. 3D). In fact, the results of binding studies with rat-testis proteins and COS-7 cell lysate containing or lacking FKBP36 suggest the presence of the GAPDH-FKBP36-Hsp90 complexes in the cytosol, where all three proteins are present. These interactions occurred with recombinant human proteins, purified rabbit GAPDH, or endogenous rat proteins, suggesting similar interactions in different mammalian organisms perhaps based on the high similarity of the interaction partners in different mammals. Such GAPDH-FKBP36-Hsp90 complexes might be similar to steroid hormone receptor complexes. Thus, the FKBP36-mediated GAPDH control is perhaps comparable with the reduction of steroid hormone receptor activity induced by high cellular FKBP51 concentrations (19Scammell J.G. Denny W.B. Valentine D.L. Smith D.F. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2001; 124: 152-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), but presents a unique mechanism, because GAPDH, in contrast to receptor molecules, is not a client protein of Hsp90 and direct interactions between both proteins were not observed. Nevertheless, Hsp90"
https://openalex.org/W2078116484,"Formation of a partition complex on plasmid F by binding of SopB protein to the sopC centromere is the first step in the partition process that ensures stability of F in dividing cells. Establishment of the complex enables nonspecific binding of SopB to neighboring DNA, which extends the partition complex and provokes reduction of negative supercoiling of the plasmid. This reduction is believed to reflect winding of DNA into positive supercoils about SopB to create a nucleoprotein structure of probable importance to partition. We have searched for evidence that SopB alters plasmid topology. Permutation analysis indicated only modest bending of linear DNA fragments, and in vivo DNase I footprinting revealed no enhanced cleavages indicating curvature. In vitro, SopB binding left no topological trace in relaxed-circular DNA treated with topoisomerase I or in nicked circles closed by ligase. In vivo, novobiocin-mediated inhibition of DNA gyrase relaxed a plasmid carrying the partition complex but left no residue of positive supercoils. Hence, SopB does not reduce plasmid supercoiling directly. We did observe that SopB partly prevented removal of negative supercoils from plasmid DNA by topoisomerase I and partly prevented ligation of nicked circles, indicating that it acts as a physical obstacle. The supercoil deficit is thus better explained as SopB recoating of just-replicated DNA, which shelters it from gyrase and from topological changes in SopB-free DNA. This topological simplicity distinguishes the Sop partition complex from other complexes described.

This topological simplicity distinguishes the Sop partition complex from other complexes described. The partition mechanisms that ensure stability of low copy number bacterial replicons resemble eukaryotic mitosis stripped to its simplest elements. This is most clearly seen in the case of plasmids. Each carries a characteristic set of sequence repeats that serve as a centromere. A specific protein, generically termed ParB, binds to the centromere to form a partition complex, functionally equivalent to a kinetochore. A cytoskeleton-like ATPase or GTPase, ParA, then acts on the partition complexes to transport their attached plasmids to daughter cells. The proteins are encoded in an autoregulated two-gene operon, parAB, to which the centromere is usually adjacent. Most bacterial chromosomes specify a similar set of functions but how these contribute to chromosome partition is at present less well defined. Our focus here is plasmid partition complexes, whose formation following replication of the centromere is the essential first step of the partition mechanism. Recent studies have indicated that partition complexes serve not only to link plasmid molecules to their cognate ParAs but also to activate the dynamic properties of these proteins that enable them to segregate plasmid copies (1Moller-Jensen J. Jensen R.B. Lowe J. Gerdes K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 2Ebersbach G. Gerdes K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15078-15083Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The dynamics of ParA proteins stem from their ability to form metastable polymers. In vivo, dynamic behavior is seen only if the cognate ParB and centromere are both present (2Ebersbach G. Gerdes K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15078-15083Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar); ParB proteins, though able to interact with ParA (3Hirano M. Mori H. Onogi T. Yamazoe M. Niki H. Ogura T. Hiraga S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 4Bouet J.Y. Funnell B.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and to stimulate ATP hydrolysis (5Watanabe E. Wachi M. Yamasaki M. Nagai K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), do not alone promote ParA dynamics. Some aspect of partition complex structure appears to be needed to explain this key event in partition. One factor could be size. Centromeres typically consist of a cluster of ParB binding sites, and formation of a partition complex might raise local ParB concentration to the point where it is a strong enough signal to promote ParA polymerization. Reduction of binding site number has been seen to diminish centromere efficiency (7Breuner A. Jensen R.B. Dam M. Pedersen S. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The effective size of certain partition complexes may be increased by spreading, the recruitment by the ParB component of further ParB molecules which bind nonspecifically to neighboring DNA for up to several kilobases (8Biek D.P. Shi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8027-8031Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 9Lynch A.S. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is also possible that ParA senses not size itself but partition complexes which have paired (“metaphase”), and that larger partition complexes pair more readily. Alternatively, the feature of partition complexes essential for ParA stimulation could be the specific nature of their superstructure. Recent studies of P1 partition complex structure have led to the proposal that the combination of two types of binding site in the parS centromere, two distinct motifs in ParB that recognize them and a flexible peptide that links the motifs could confer the versatility that enables partition complex assembly, pairing of plasmid copies and condensation of neighboring DNA via spreading (11Schumacher M.A. Funnell B.E. Nature. 2005; 438: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Schumacher M.A. Mansoor A. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10456-10464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A spring washer structure deduced for the ParR-parC complex of pB171 suggested a mechanism for trapping and feeding ParM-ATP molecules onto the growing tip of the ParM filament (13Moller-Jensen J. Ringgaard S. Mercogliano C.P. Gerdes K. Lowe J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4413-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). While we do not yet know to what extent the structural features so far identified are exploited in vivo, it is clear that defining partition complex structure will be necessary for understanding events at the ParA-partition complex interface. A striking structural idiosyncrasy appears to characterize the SopB-sopC partition complex of plasmid F. SopC is a tandem array of twelve 43-bp units (Fig. 1), each containing a short inverted repeat to which SopB binds as a dimer (14Ogura T. Hiraga S. Cell. 1983; 32: 351-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 15Hayakawa Y. Murotsu T. Matsubara K. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 349-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hanai R.

Shi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8027-8031Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and Lynch and Wang (17Lynch A.S. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that mini-F and other plasmids carrying sopC extracted from cells producing SopB are less negatively supercoiled than plasmids without sopC. These authors proposed, on the basis of various prokaryotic precedents (18Serrano M. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. Science. 1990; 248: 1012-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Musgrave D.R. Sandman K.M. Reeve J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10397-10401Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1399-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), that upon binding to sopC, SopB protein wraps it in a right-handed sense, creating a zone of positive supercoiling and leaving negative supercoiling of the remaining plasmid DNA to be adjusted by topoisomerase action. An overall increase in linking number results, which is seen following deproteinization. Notably, the supercoil deficit induced by a single 43-bp unit was comparable to that seen with the entire sopC, implying that the initial partition complex could nucleate the addition of further SopB molecules and so extend the zone of local positive supercoiling over flanking DNA (8Biek D.P. Shi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8027-8031Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This suggestion received strong support from demonstrations that SopB could inhibit methylase and gyrase action, as well as promoter activity, on DNA flanking sopC (9Lynch A.S. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1896-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Hanai R. Liu R. Benedetti P. Caron P.R. Lynch A.S. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17469-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Hence the F plasmid partition complex has generally been viewed as an extended nucleoprotein structure whose formation involves introduction of local positive supercoiling. However, direct evidence that the increased linking number of mini-F plasmids results from creation of a zone of positive supercoiling, by wrapping of DNA on SopB or by other means, has not been reported. We report here an exploration of the topological consequences of SopB binding to DNA in vitro and in vivo. Our findings indicate that rather than introducing positive supercoils, SopB raises mini-F linking number by sheltering it from DNA gyrase. Proteins, Enzymes, and Reagents—SopB was purified as described previously (21Bouet J.Y. Ah-Seng Y. Benmeradi N. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 468-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). HU was a gift from J. Rouviére-Yaniv. Restriction and nicking endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK), Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and Taq polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs, calf thymus topoisomerase I (Topo I) 2The abbreviations used are: Topo I, topoisomerase I; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. from Invitrogen, and oligonucleotides, bovine serum albumin (Fraction V), chloroquine and Sybr green from Sigma. Filter Binding Assay—SopB DNA binding activity was assayed by double filter binding as previously described (21Bouet J.Y. Ah-Seng Y. Benmeradi N. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 468-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The specific and nonspecific DNA species were, respectively, a 144-bp sopC+ fragment produced by PCR amplification from pJYB55 (22Bouet J.Y. Bouvier M. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in the presence of [α-32P]dATP, using oligonucleotides sopC22 (5′-CTAGTGGATCCCCCGGGCTGCAG-3′) and sopC23 (5′-CCCTCACTAAAGGGAACAAAAGC-3′), and a 127-bp repE fragment from pDAG114 (23Ravin N. Lane D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6898-6906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using repE1 (5′-AGTTACCAGCGTATGCCTGACTTCC-3′) and repE2 (5′-ACGATATGAGTCGTCTGGCGGCCTT-3′). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Binding reactions were started by adding purified SopB protein to 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 100 μg·ml–1 bovine serum albumin, 50 μg·ml–1 sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol containing 0.5 nm 32P-labeled restriction fragments with (106 bp) and without (83 bp) a SopB binding site in a final volume of 10 μl. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the mixtures were analyzed by electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide gels in TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA) and phosphorimaging as previously described (22Bouet J.Y. Bouvier M. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For DNA bending analysis, a 43-bp sopC unit generated by oligonucleotide annealing (sequence shown in Fig. 1) was inserted into the SalI restriction site of pBend2 (24Kim J. Zwieb C. Wu C. Adhya S. Gene. 1989; 85: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), giving pJYB69. Fragments of 169 bp were excised from pJYB69 to yield a circularly permuted set (see Fig. 2C), and radiolabeled using PNK and [γ-32P]ATP. SopB binding reactions were assembled and processed as above. Preparation of Plasmid DNA Substrates—A p15A-based plasmid carrying sopC, pZC204 (25Yates P. Lane D. Biek D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), was purified according to the Qiagen miniprep procedure. When necessary, pZC204 monomers were further purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and extraction using the Qiaex2 (Qiagen) kit. Relaxed CCC DNA for Topo I assays was prepared by incubating pZC204 DNA (600 ng) with Topo I (30 units) in T buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μg·ml–1 bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C for 15 min. Removal of supercoils was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the relaxed DNA was used directly in subsequent reactions. Nicked circular DNA for ligation assays was prepared by incubating monomeric pZC204 with N.BstNBI endonuclease in NEBuffer 3 for 1 h at 55 °C, then purifying the DNA by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Topo I Assay—Negatively supercoiled or relaxed pZC204 (at 2 nm) was incubated with SopB (0.01–4.0 μm) in 10 μl of T buffer at 30 °C for 10 min. 3 units of Topo I (0.5 μl) were then added, and incubation continued for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of 10 μl of 2% SDS, 50 mm EDTA, and incubated at 55 °C for 15 min, and the DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation prior to analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis and Sybr green staining. Ligase Assay—Nicked pZC204 (1 nm) was incubated with SopB (0.025–2.5 μm) in 10 μl of B buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol) at 30 °C for 15 min. 1 μl of ligase mix (40U T4 DNA ligase in B buffer containing 10 mm ATP) was then added and incubation continued for 20 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of 5 μl of Stop mix (3.3% SDS, 100 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, bromphenol blue) and incubated at 55 °C for 15 min, and the DNA was purified and analyzed as for the Topo I assay. Electrophoresis—The electrophoresis medium for all experiments was 1% agarose in 40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA. Topo I assay samples were run at 4 °C for 16 h at 60 V, ligase assay samples at room temperature for 16 h at 30 V, and two-dimensional topoisomer analysis samples at 4 °C and 60 V, for 16 h in the first dimension and with 0.5 or 1 μg·ml–1 chloroquine for 4–5 h in the second dimension, all with buffer recirculation. Gels were stained with Sybr green and scanned using a FluorImager 585 (Molecular Dynamics). Data were analyzed using Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics). In Situ DNAse I Footprinting—Strain DLT1472 (lacOP::sopB; (26Bouet J.Y. Rech J. Egloff S. Biek D.P. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)) transformed with pZC204 was grown overnight in LB broth containing chloramphenicol (20 μg·ml–1), diluted 2000-fold into the same medium with or without IPTG (250 μm) and incubated at 37 °C. At A600 ∼0.2, 3-ml samples were permeabilized with cold ethanol and subjected to DNase I footprinting prior to extraction and purification of the DNA (final volume 50 μl of TE), essentially as described by Cassler et al. (27Cassler M.R. Grimwade J.E. McGarry K.C. Mott R.T. Leonard A.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4570-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Fifteen cycles of primer extension were then carried out using 5.5 μl of DNA in a 10-μl volume containing DNA polymerase (Hot Tub) and radiolabeled oligonucleotides sopC8 (5′-ATGTCCTTTGTTACAGGCCAGAAAGC-3′) or sopC9 (5′-CGACGACATGTCAATACTTGCCCTTG-3′). 5 μl of 95% formamide, 10 mm Na3EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 10 mm NaOH were added, and 3–5 μl of the mixtures were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and fractionated by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel. The DNAse I patterns were revealed by phosphorimaging and scanned using ImageGauge software (Fuji). For topoisomer analysis, 40 ml samples of the same cultures were processed as described previously (28Lemonnier M. Bouet J.Y. Libante V. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Plasmid Supercoiling in Vivo—Strains AS19 or DLT2503 carrying pZC204 or pACYC184 were grown overnight in LB broth containing chloramphenicol (20 μg·ml–1), diluted 1000-fold into the same medium containing 100 μm IPTG and incubated at 37 °C. At A600 ∼0.3, each culture was divided, and half was further incubated with novobiocin (100 μg·ml–1), half without. From 17.5-ml samples taken after 0, 20, and 60 min, plasmid DNA was purified as described (28Lemonnier M. Bouet J.Y. Libante V. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), except that the Wizard (Promega) miniprep procedure was used and followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Plasmid topoisomers were resolved by one-dimensional or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described above, revealed by Sybr green staining with a luminescence analyser (LAS4000, Fuji) and analyzed with Multigauge software (Fuji). Several measurements of the linking number difference (ΔLk) between wild type mini-F and its ΔsopC equivalent have shown it to be –12 ± 1 (8Biek D.P. Shi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8027-8031Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Yates P. Lane D. Biek D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Bouet J.Y. Rech J.

The correspondence of this number with that of specific binding sites in sopC is purely fortuitous; mini-F with a single sopC unit (43 bp) centromere has a ΔLk about 7 higher than that of the ΔsopC mutant, implying that much of the supercoil deficit in mini-F plasmids (about half on the basis of these figures) arises from nonspecific binding of SopB to the DNA that flanks sopC. In any case, only ten of the binding sites in sopC are likely to be effective; footprinting data (30Mori H. Mori Y. Ichinose C. Niki H. Ogura T. Kato A. Hiraga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15535-15541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that the degenerate terminal repeats do not bind SopB strongly. Anticipating that both specific and nonspecific binding would contribute to plasmid topology, we began by characterizing both. DNA Binding by SopB—To establish the conditions needed for analyzing topological effects of SopB binding to sopC,we purified SopB as the native protein, and used a filter retention assay to measure its binding to DNA in the presence of nonspecific competitor DNA. Fig. 2A shows binding of radioactively labeled 144-bp fragments with or without a 43-bp sopC unit as a function of SopB concentration. Binding to the sopC fragment was by far the stronger under these conditions, as expected. A double-reciprocal plot of the binding data (not shown) yielded an apparent Kd of 0.015 μm and 2.9 μm for the sopC and nonspecific fragments respectively. The Kd for sopC binding is 15-fold higher than the DNA concentration (1 nm) used, not a vast excess but sufficient for confidence that the Kd is accurate within a factor of 2. The nonspecific binding constant is similar to that reported previously (21Bouet J.Y. Ah-Seng Y. Benmeradi N. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 468-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The substrates used in previous determinations of specific SopB-sopC affinity (30Mori H. Mori Y. Ichinose C. Niki H. Ogura T. Kato A. Hiraga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15535-15541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Watanabe E. Inamoto S. Lee M.H. Kim S.U. Ogua T. Mori H. Hiraga S. Yamasaki M. Nagai K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) differ too much from the single-binding site, linear fragments used here to allow meaningful comparison. The electrophoretic mobility shift analysis shown in Fig. 2B confirmed the filter retention results. SopB showed no significant binding to the control 83-bp fragment but formed a distinct band (“B”) by retarding a radioactively labeled 106-bp fragment containing one 43-bp unit of sopC. In addition, a smear of DNA appeared behind the sopC fragment and migrated more slowly as SopB concentration rose. Only the sopC fragment contributes to this; the 83-bp control band is not diminished even at the highest concentration of SopB used. The smearing suggests that some of the SopB-sopC complexes are not fully stable in the gel buffer and disintegrate during electrophoresis. Bending of sopC DNA by SopB Protein—As a first test of the likelihood that SopB wraps DNA, we examined a necessary consequence of wrapping, SopB-induced curvature. Curvature of linear DNA decreases the distance between its ends and increases its effective cross-sectional area, thus retarding its reptational migration in gel matrices (32Kolb A. Spassky A. Chapon C. Blazy B. Buc H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7833-7852Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 33Wu H.M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). This phenomenon has served as the basis of a widely used method for measuring bend angles. Retardation of a fragment bent in the middle results not only from the added mass of the bound protein but also from the maximum reduction in the end-to-end distance, and is therefore greater than retardation of a fragment bent near the end which is caused mainly by protein bulk. The bend angle is proportional to the ratio between these two retardations and can be calculated from it (34Thompson J.F. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9687-9705Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). To estimate the degree of bending that SopB produces upon binding to a single 16-bp sopC site, we inserted the site into the vector pBend2, then re-excised it on fragments of ∼164 bp (Fig. 2C) and measured SopB-induced retardation of each fragment on polyacrylamide gels. The distance migrated by the complex relative to that migrated by the bare fragment, Rf, is plotted against the distance from the fragment end to the binding site center in Fig. 2D. SopB retards the fragments according to the binding site position and most strongly for the more central positions, implying that the apex of the bends is at or within a few base pairs of the center of the sopC site. The relative mobilities of fragments with centrally located and terminally located bends was shown by Thompson and Landy (34Thompson J.F. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9687-9705Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) to conform fairly closely to the relation: ratio of mobilities = cos(angle/2) provided the bend is not too sharp (<∼100°). The shallowness of the Rf distribution in Fig. 2D indicated that the SopB-induced angle would not be large, and accordingly we derived a bending angle from these data. Because even the binding site furthest from the middle, in the AflIII fragment, was not close to the end we calculated Rf values for a feasible complex as close as possible to the end (8 bp) and for a theoretical complex at the very end, by extrapolating the non-linear least squares regression fit to the data (solid curve). This procedure allowed the estimates of the angle shown in Fig. 2D. Although the extrapolation introduces an inaccuracy of unknown magnitude, we provisionally take the angle of the bend induced by SopB upon binding to sopC to be ∼50°. We also attempted to measure the cumulative bend produced by binding at two naturally spaced sites, reasoning that the 43-bp interval would correspond closely enough to four complete helical turns (of 10.5 bp) for the individual bends to be in phase and thus measurable in the same way. The value obtained, ∼70° (data not shown) was considerably less than twice the solo angle, suggesting that in sopC successive SopB binding sites are not bent in the same plane. It also suggests that, at least under our electrophoresis conditions, two bound SopB dimers do not interact to loop the intervening DNA into a tight bend. Permutation analysis allows curvature estimations only for specifically bound protein. Multiplicity of binding sites, potential for rapid exchange of SopB between them and site-to-site variation prevents the use of this method for estimation of bending induced by nonspecifically bound protein. In general the degree of induced curvature is correlated with binding affinity (35Gartenberg M.R. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1988; 333: 824-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 36Lloubes R.

The ∼50° bend induced in sopC scarcely qualifies as wrapping, and an in-phase 10-fold repetition in sopC would introduce at most only ∼1.5 turns. If the contributions of specific and nonspecific binding to the mini-F supercoil deficit are about equal (see above), explaining the ΔLk of +12 on the basis of directly introduced positive supercoils seems problematic. Effect of SopB Protein on Plasmid Topology—If SopB directly increases plasmid linking number, this should be manifested as a residue of positive supercoils after removal of supercoiling from the SopB-free portion of plasmid DNA. A binding mixture consisting of SopB protein and a negatively supercoiled plasmid carrying sopC, pZC204, was treated with calf thymus topoisomerase I, which removes both negative and positive supercoils. After deproteinization the DNA was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, with the result shown in Fig. 3A. In the absence of SopB, topoisomerase I relaxed pZC204 to a mixture of topoisomers which two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (not shown) showed to consist largely of species –1 to +4 (lane 2). We assume that the topoprofile is not centered at zero because of the difference in temperatures at which Topo I treatment and gel electrophoresis were carried out. The profile was not detectably altered at SopB concentrations ≤ 0.05 μm. At SopB concentrations ≥ 0.1 μm the same topoisomers were the major products but in addition a series of higher order topoisomers appeared (lanes 3–5). Their sign was determined by subjecting the 0.9 μm SopB sample to two-dimensional electrophoresis (Fig. 3B), in which the chloroquine present in the second electrophoresis buffer causes helix unwinding and a compensatory reduction of negative superhelicity. The faster migrating, more highly wound topoisomers from the first dimension are slowed in the second, and the slower ones accelerated, showing that the SopB-related topoisomers were of negative sign. (Distinct migration of positive and negative topoisomers of a given density is also seen in the standard gel conditions of Fig. 3A, as observed previously (39Lockshon D. Morris D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 2999-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)). The essential result of this experiment is that SopB does not generate new positively supercoiled species or increase the amounts of those made in its absence, and so does not affect plasmid DNA in vitro as it does in vivo. It suggests that that the increased in vivo linking number of sopC plasmids is an indirect consequence of SopB binding. How to account for the negatively sup"

We isolated both LDL and Lp(a) from the plasma of a population of high-Lp(a) subjects and in each Lp(a) particle separated apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], from the LDL component, Lp(a(-)). These products were assayed by an ELISA using monoclonal antibody T15 with a known specificity for oxPLs. In each subject, the T15 reactivity was confined to apo(a). Moreover, the amount of oxPL bound to apo(a) was unaffected by plasma Lp(a) levels and apo(a) size polymorphism. We have previously shown that kringle V (KV) is the site of oxPL linkage in human apo(a). In this work, we expressed in human embryonic kidney cells a KV-containing recombinant that, when purified from the medium, contained oxPLs. In summary, in human plasma Lp(a), the oxPLs are located in apo(a) and not in the circulating LDLs, suggesting a cellular origin. This latter concept is supported by the studies in which an expressed KV-containing apo(a) microdomain exhibited oxPL reactivity. Thus, apo(a) can undergo potentially pathogenic posttranslational modifications in a cellular environment able to generate oxPL."
https://openalex.org/W2007023423,"We have previously shown that vaccination with DNA encoding the encephalitogenic peptide myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)(91-108) (pMOG) suppresses MOG(91-108)-induced rat Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for human Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The suppressive effect of pMOG is dependent on inclusion of CpG DNA in the plasmid backbone and is associated with early induction of Interferon (IFN)-beta.In this study we examined the mechanisms underlying pMOG-induced protection. We found that in the DNA vaccinated cohort proinflammatory Interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-21 responses were dramatically reduced compared to in the control group, but that the expression of Foxp3 and Tumor Growth Factor (TGF)-beta1, which are associated with regulatory T cells, was not enhanced. Moreover, genes associated with Type I IFNs were upregulated. To delineate the role of IFN-beta in the protective mechanism we employed short interfering RNA (siRNA) to IFN-beta in the DNA vaccine. SiRNA to IFN-beta completely abrogated the protective effects of the vaccine, demonstrating that a local early elaboration of IFN-beta is important for EAE protection. IL-17 responses comparable to those in control rats developed in rats injected with the IFN-beta-silencing DNA vaccine.We herein demonstrate that DNA vaccination protects from proinflammatory Th17 cell responses during induction of EAE. The mechanism involves IFN-beta as IL-17 responses are rescued by silencing of IFN-beta during DNA vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2062307376,"Many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) recycle after agonist-induced endocytosis by a sequence-dependent mechanism, which is distinct from default membrane flow and remains poorly understood. Efficient recycling of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) requires a C-terminal PDZ (PSD-95/Discs Large/ZO-1) protein-binding determinant (PDZbd), an intact actin cytoskeleton, and is regulated by the endosomal protein Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated substrate). The PDZbd is thought to link receptors to actin through a series of protein interaction modules present in NHERF/EBP50 (Na+/H+ exchanger 3 regulatory factor/ezrin-binding phosphoprotein of 50 kDa) family and ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) family proteins. It is not known, however, if such actin connectivity is sufficient to recapitulate the natural features of sequence-dependent recycling. We addressed this question using a receptor fusion approach based on the sufficiency of the PDZbd to promote recycling when fused to a distinct GPCR, the δ-opioid receptor, which normally recycles inefficiently in HEK293 cells. Modular domains mediating actin connectivity promoted receptor recycling with similarly high efficiency as the PDZbd itself, and recycling promoted by all of the domains was actin-dependent. Regulation of receptor recycling by Hrs, however, was conferred only by the PDZbd and not by downstream interaction modules.

While these receptors share a common 7-transmembrane-spanning topology, structural differences between individual GPCR family members confer diverse functional and regulatory properties (1Palczewski K.

A fundamental mechanism of GPCR regulation involves agonist-induced endocytosis of receptors via clathrin-coated pits (4Lefkowitz R.J. Acta Physiologica.. 2007; 190: 9-19Google Scholar). Regulated endocytosis can have multiple functional consequences, which are determined in part by the specificity with which internalized receptors traffic via divergent downstream membrane pathways (5Sorkin A. Von Zastrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol.. 2002; 3: 600-614Google Scholar, 6Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J. Krueger K. Daaka Y. Adv. Pharmacol.. 1998; 42: 416-420Google Scholar, 7Marchese A. Chen C. Kim Y.-M. Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci.. 2003; 28: 369-376Google Scholar). Trafficking of internalized GPCRs to lysosomes, a major pathway traversed by the δ-opioid receptor (δOR), contributes to proteolytic down-regulation of receptor number and produces a prolonged attenuation of subsequent cellular responsiveness to agonist (8Law P.Y.

Trafficking of internalized GPCRs via a rapid recycling pathway, a major route traversed by the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), restores the complement of functional receptors present on the cell surface and promotes rapid recovery of cellular signaling responsiveness (6Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J. Krueger K. Daaka Y. Adv. Pharmacol.. 1998; 42: 416-420Google Scholar, 10Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol.. 1995; 47: 666-676Google Scholar, 11Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. EMBO J.. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Google Scholar). When co-expressed in the same cells, the δOR and β2AR are efficiently sorted between these divergent downstream membrane pathways, highlighting the occurrence of specific molecular sorting of GPCRs after endocytosis (12Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Google Scholar). Recycling of various integral membrane proteins can occur by default, essentially by bulk membrane flow in the absence of lysosomal sorting determinants (13Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol.. 1995; 7: 552-563Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that various GPCRs, such as the β2AR, require distinct cytoplasmic determinants to recycle efficiently (14Hanyaloglu A.C. von Zastrow M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol.. 2008; 48: 537-568Google Scholar). In addition to requiring a cytoplasmic sorting determinant, sequence-dependent recycling of the β2AR differs from default recycling in its dependence on an intact actin cytoskeleton and its regulation by the conserved endosomal sorting protein Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor receptor substrate) (11Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. EMBO J.. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Google Scholar, 14Hanyaloglu A.C. von Zastrow M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol.. 2008; 48: 537-568Google Scholar). Compared with the present knowledge regarding protein complexes that mediate sorting of GPCRs to lysosomes (15Saksena S. Sun J. Chu T. Emr S.D. Trends Biochem. Sci.. 2007; 32: 561-573Google Scholar, 16Marchese A. Paing M.M. Temple B.R.S. Trejo J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol.. 2008; 48: 601-629Google Scholar), however, relatively little is known about the biochemical basis of sequence-directed recycling or its regulation. The β2AR-derived recycling sequence conforms to a canonical PDZ (PSD-95/Discs Large/ZO-1) protein-binding determinant (henceforth called PDZbd), and PDZ-mediated protein association(s) with this sequence appear to be primarily responsible for its endocytic sorting activity (17Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature.. 1999; 401: 286-290Google Scholar, 18Gage R.M. Kim K.A. Cao T.T. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

Kobilka B.K. Xiang Y. Mol. Pharmacol.. 2007; 72: 429-439Google Scholar). Fusion of this sequence to the cytoplasmic tail of the δOR effectively re-routes endocytic trafficking of engineered receptors from lysosomal to recycling pathways, establishing the sufficiency of the PDZbd to function as a transplantable sorting determinant (18Gage R.M. Kim K.A. Cao T.T. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 44712-44720Google Scholar). The β2AR-derived PDZbd binds with relatively high specificity to the NHERF/EBP50 family of PDZ proteins (21Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S.

Chem.. 2005; 281: 2820-2827Google Scholar). A well-established biochemical function of NHERF/EBP50 family proteins is to associate integral membrane proteins with actin-associated cytoskeletal elements. This is achieved through a series of protein-interaction modules linking NHERF/EBP50 family proteins to ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) family proteins and, in turn, to actin filaments (23Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol.. 2000; 16: 113-143Google Scholar, 24Reczek D. Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 18452-18458Google Scholar, 25Reczek D. Bretscher A. J.

Such indirect actin connectivity is known to mediate other effects on plasma membrane organization and function (23Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol.. 2000; 16: 113-143Google Scholar), however, and NHERF/EBP50 family proteins can bind to additional proteins potentially important for endocytic trafficking of receptors (23Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol.. 2000; 16: 113-143Google Scholar, 25Reczek D. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol.. 2001; 153: 191-206Google Scholar). Thus it remains unclear if actin connectivity is itself sufficient to promote sequence-directed recycling of GPCRs and, if so, if such connectivity recapitulates the normal cellular regulation of sequence-dependent recycling. In the present study, we took advantage of the modular nature of protein connectivity proposed to mediate β2AR recycling (24Reczek D. Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 18452-18458Google Scholar, 26Turunen O. Wahlstrom T. Vaheri A. J. Cell Biol.. 1994; 126: 1445-1453Google Scholar), and extended the opioid receptor fusion strategy used successfully for identifying diverse recycling sequences in GPCRs (27Galet C. Hirakawa T. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol.. 2004; 18: 434-446Google Scholar, 28Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 45978-45986Google Scholar, 29Vargas G.A. Von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 37461-37469Google Scholar), to address these fundamental questions. Here we show that the recycling activity of the β2AR-derived PDZbd can be effectively bypassed by linking receptors to ERM family proteins in the absence of the PDZbd itself. Further, we establish that the protein connectivity network can be further simplified by fusing receptors to an interaction module that binds directly to actin filaments. We found that bypassing the PDZ-mediated interaction using either domain is sufficient to mimic the ability of the PDZbd to promote efficient, actin-dependent recycling of receptors. Hrs-dependent regulation, however, which is characteristic of sequence-dependent recycling of wild-type receptors, was recapitulated only by the fused PDZbd and not by the proposed downstream interaction modules. These results support a relatively simple architecture of protein connectivity that is sufficient to mimic the core recycling activity of the β2AR-derived PDZbd, but not its characteristic cellular regulation. Given that an increasing number of GPCRs have been shown to bind PDZ proteins that typically link directly or indirectly to cytoskeletal elements (17Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature.. 1999; 401: 286-290Google Scholar, 27Galet C. Hirakawa T. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol.. 2004; 18: 434-446Google Scholar, 30Lahuna O. Quellari M. Achard C. Nola S.

Pharmacol.. 2005; 67: 1581-1590Google Scholar), the present results also suggest that actin connectivity may represent a common biochemical principle underlying sequence-dependent recycling of various GPCRs. DNA Constructs—All receptor constructs studied were created from a FLAG-tagged version of the murine δOR cloned into pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen), described previously (12Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Google Scholar). A C-terminal fusion of the distal 10 residues derived from the β2AR tail, which contains the PDZbd, was also described previously (18Gage R.M. Kim K.A. Cao T.T. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 44712-44720Google Scholar) and is called δOR-PDZbd in the present study. The ERM protein-binding domain (Ebd) was isolated from EBP50 (also called human NHERF1, accession no. O14745, generously provided by A. Bretscher at Cornell University) by PCR-mediated amplification of the sequence encoding the C-terminal 39 residues. The actin-binding domain (Abd) was generated by chemical synthesis of a sequence encoding the 34-residue modular domain defined in a C-terminal portion human ezrin (26Turunen O. Wahlstrom T. Vaheri A. J. Cell Biol.. 1994; 126: 1445-1453Google Scholar). In both cases, appropriate stop codon and linker sequences were added to facilitate ligation to the Srf1/Xba1 sites present in the sequence encoding the distal C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the FLAG-δOR construct. The δOR-Abdt[6] construct was generated by adding a stop codon at the -6 position in the δOR-ABD construct, using oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene), a mutation that disrupts actin binding to the fused Abd (26Turunen O. Wahlstrom T. Vaheri A. J. Cell Biol.. 1994; 126: 1445-1453Google Scholar). FLAG-δOR-GFP was constructed using PCR amplification of the FLAG-δOR coding sequence together with AgeI/HindIII appendages, followed by ligation in-frame into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). The GFP-Hrs construct was created using PCR amplification of a Myc-tagged construct described previously (34Bache K.G. Raiborg C. Mehlum A. Stenmark H. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 12513-12521Google Scholar) and generously provided by H. Stenmark (Norwegian Radium Hospital). EcoRI/XbaI appendages were added to facilitate ligation into pEGFP-C2 (Clontech), effectively replacing the N-terminal Myc tag with EGFP. All constructs were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (Elim Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.). Cell Culture and Transfections—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (University of California, San Francisco Cell Culture Facility). Cells plated in 6-well plates were transfected at ∼50% confluency using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stably transfected cells were selected in 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen), and cell clones expressing FLAG-tagged receptor constructs were chosen at closely similar levels based on average surface immunofluorescence/cell measured through flow cytometry and found to have at least 75% of cells expressing surface immunoreactivity (the minor proportion of cells lacking substantial immunoreactivity was excluded in subsequent analyses). Receptor expression was quantified by whole cell radioligand binding using [3H]diprenorphine (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (18Gage R.M. Kim K.A. Cao T.T. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 44712-44720Google Scholar). Cell clones selected for further study expressed receptors in the range of 0.2-1 pmol/mg cell protein. For immunofluorescence studies of receptor trafficking in transiently transfected cells, cells were transfected as above, plated onto coverslips in a 12-well plate 24 h post-transfection, and experiments were conducted 48-72 h post-transfection. In experiments requiring coexpression of GFP-Hrs, cell clones expressing the indicated receptor construct were transiently transfected at ∼50% confluency, as above, except using the GFP-Hrs construct. Cells were split into 12-well plates 24 h after transfection, and used for the preparation of flow cytometry samples 24 h thereafter. Fluorescence Microscopy—FLAG-tagged receptors present in the plasma membrane of living cells were labeled with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M1, Sigma) as described previously (18Gage R.M. Kim K.A. Cao T.T. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 44712-44720Google Scholar). Endocytosis of labeled receptors was promoted by adding 10 μm [d-Ala2, d-Leu5]Enkephalin (DADLE, Research Biochemicals) to the culture medium and incubating cells at 37 °C for 25 min. Recycling was assessed by carrying out a medium change after DADLE incubation, and incubating cells at 37 °C for an additional 45 min in the presence of 10 μm of the opioid antagonist naloxone (Research Biochemicals, used to block residual agonist activity in the culture medium). Following the indicated incubations, specimens were fixed (4% formaldehyde in PBS) and permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS), then antibody-labeled receptors were visualized by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugates (Invitrogen) linked to AlexaFluor594 (wide-field microscopy), AlexaFluor555 (scanning confocal microscopy), or AlexaFluor488 (transferrin colocalization). For visualizing internalized transferrin receptors, 10 μg/ml Texas Red-labeled diferric transferrin (Invitrogen) was added to serum-free culture medium together with DADLE. Wide field fluorescence images were collected using a Nikon Diaphot epifluorescence microscope with mercury arc lamp illumination and 60×/NA1.4 objective. Images were captured using a cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments) interfaced to a PC running MetaMorph acquisition and analysis software (Molecular Devices). Confocal images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope with 63×/NA1.3 objective, using instrument settings verified to produce negligible bleedthrough between channels, and an estimated section thickness of 1 μm. Micrographs shown are representative optical sections imaged through the center of the cell. Fluorescence Flow Cytometry—FLAG-tagged receptors present in the plasma membrane were labeled as described previously (18Gage R.M. Kim K.A. Cao T.T. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 44712-44720Google Scholar), except that M1 anti-FLAG antibody was conjugated with AlexaFluor647 (Invitrogen) rather than AlexaFluor488 to reduce background autofluorescence in the subsequent analysis. The mean fluorescence of 5,000-20,000 cells/sample was determined using a FACSCalibur instrument and CellQuest Software (BD Biosciences). The mean fluorescence calculated from triplicate samples was normalized to reflect the relative change in surface receptor pools, and these levels were averaged from at least three experiments per cell clone analyzed. The percentage of receptor recycling occurring after agonist washout was then calculated from mean surface receptor fluorescence values (F) as follows: % recycling = (Fwashout - Fagonist-treated)/(Funtreated - Fagonist-treated) × 100. For analysis of recycling under conditions of cytoskeletal disruption, cytochalasin D (Sigma) was administered in culture medium at a 1:500 dilution from a 1 mg/ml stock in DMSO, which was added 20 min prior to incubation with the indicated opioid ligands. Vehicle control was accomplished by adding 1:500 DMSO alone. To evaluate the Hrs-sensitivity of GPCR recycling, 10,000-20,000 cells expressing the indicated receptor construct together with GFP-Hrs (generated as described above) were analyzed. Labeled receptors (AlexaFluor647) and Hrs (EGFP) were quantified simultaneously using separate laser excitations and detection channels in which negligible bleedthrough was verified using singly labeled specimens. This strategy produced a population of cells with uniform levels of receptor expression (based on stable transfection) and variable levels of Hrs overexpression (based on transient transfection). In the analysis, this range of GFP-Hrs expression was divided into two cell populations based on EGFP fluorescence intensity (regions R2 and R3, see Fig. 6A). These two internally controlled groups were then analyzed for AlexaFluor647-labeled receptor fluorescence in triplicates, averaged within each group and drug treatment, and normalized to calculate independent recycling percentages as described above. The average percentage recycling calculated from region R3 was subtracted from that calculated from region R2 and averaged to assess dose-dependent inhibition of recycling by GFP-Hrs expression. Data shown represent mean determinations from 4-5 independent experiments per receptor-expressing cell clone. Graphing and statistical analysis was carried out using Prism (GraphPad, Inc.) software. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean determinations across the experiments.

Chem.. 1976; 251: 4778-4786Google Scholar), was generously provided by R. D. Mullins and group (UCSF). Monomeric actin was maintained at 4 °C at a concentration of 50 μm in 0.5 mm TCEP (0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 2 mm Tris pH 8.0) before dilution to 4 μm into KMEH buffer (10 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2 pH 7.0) supplemented with 0.04 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Incubation in this buffer at 25 °C for 1 h allowed polymerization into filaments, which were subsequently stabilized by addition of 4 μg/ml phalloidin (Sigma). Extracts from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the indicated FLAG-tagged receptor construct (or mock-transfected without added plasmid DNA) were prepared in KMEH supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free mixture, Roche Applied Science). Extracts were clarified by microcentrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 × g followed by ultracentrifugation in a TLA 100 rotor (BD Biosciences) at 48,000 rpm for an additional 30 min. Total protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by a Bradford assay and adjusted as needed with KMEH lysis buffer to achieve equal concentrations (2-5 μg/ml depending on the individual experiment) of total protein. Extracts (50 μl) were then mixed with 50 μl of F-actin mixture and left on ice for 10 min before sedimenting in a TLA 100 rotor for 30 min at 48K rpm. 20 μl of supernatant was subsequently removed per sample for immunoblot analysis, and the pellet was cleared of remaining supernatant and washed in 100 μl of KMEH lysis buffer before solubilizing by boiling for 5 min in 30 μl of NuPAGE (Invitrogen) LDS sample buffer (500 mm Tris base, 8% lithium dodecyl sulfate, 40% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA) containing 0.25 m 2-mercaptoethanol, separated on 4-12% NuPAGE LDS gels (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad), and blotted for FLAG-tagged receptors using 2.5 μg/ml M1 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) followed by secondary antibody incubation using sheep anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:3000 dilution, Amersham Biosciences). Detection was carried out using enzyme-linked chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce) and immunoreactive signals were analyzed using a FluorChem 8000 imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corporation). Statistical Analysis—Internalization and recycling percentages were calculated for each individual experiment and collected as replicates in a Prism spreadsheet for statistical and graphing analysis (Graphpad, Inc.). Mean percentages were compared between receptors by ANOVA and analyzed post-hoc for pair-wise differences using the Bonferroni Multiple Comparisons test with a significance level of 0.05. Mean recycling was compared between DMSO and cytochalasin D-treated cells, per receptor expressed, by Student's t test at a significance level of 0.05, whereas comparison of recycling means between cells expressing low and high amounts of GFP-Hrs in the same sample were compared for each receptor using a paired t test with a significance level of 0.05. The ERM Protein Binding Domain Conserved in NHERF/EBP50 Family Proteins Is Sufficient to Promote Efficient Recycling When Fused to the δOR—The β2AR-derived PDZbd is sufficient, when fused to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the δOR (δOR-PDZbd mutant receptor), to re-route endocytic trafficking of this distinct GPCR from its usual lysosomal fate to the rapid recycling pathway (18Gage R.M. Kim K.A. Cao T.T. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 44712-44720Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that downstream protein connectivity to actin is sufficient to mediate this recycling activity, we applied the same receptor fusion approach to modular domains proposed to function downstream of the PDZbd (Fig. 1A). We first asked if it is possible to effectively bypass the PDZbd using only a conserved ERMbd. To do so, we fused the C-terminal 39-residues derived from EBP50 (human NHERF1), which fully includes the previously mapped ERMbd (24Reczek D. Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 18452-18458Google Scholar), to the δOR tail (δOR-ERMbd receptor fusion protein, Fig. 1B). We compared the trafficking behavior of the δOR-ERMbd to that of FLAG-tagged versions of the wild-type δOR and δOR-PDZbd constructs described previously (18Gage R.M. Kim K.A. Cao T.T. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 44712-44720Google Scholar). In the absence of agonist (control), tagged receptors labeled with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody were observed in a peripheral pattern indicative of plasma membrane localization, demonstrating that all three tagged receptors were effectively delivered to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1C, left column). Within 25 min after adding the opioid agonist DADLE to the culture medium, labeled receptors redistributed to a punctate intracellular pattern, indicating that each of the constructs was able to undergo rapid agonist-induced endocytosis (Fig. 1C, middle column). 45 min after agonist removal from the culture medium (Fig. 1C, right column), wild-type δOR remained predominantly in intracellular vesicles (top row), consistent with its failure to recycle efficiently. The δOR-PDZbd fusion receptor, as expected, returned to a predominantly plasma membrane localization pattern (middle row). Significantly, the δOR-ERMbd fusion receptor also returned to a predominantly plasma membrane localization pattern after agonist washout (bottom row), which was indistinguishable from efficient recycling of the δOR-PDZbd fusion receptor and visibly different from the endosomal retention observed for the wild-type δOR. This selective return of both the δOR-PDZbd and δOR-ERMbd fusion receptors to the plasma membrane was emphasized in confocal optical sections imaged through the middle of the cell (Fig. 1D). Together, these observations suggest that the ERMbd is indeed sufficient to promote recycling of receptors in the absence of the PDZbd itself. To quantify the trafficking properties of engineered receptors, a previously established flow cytometric assay was applied that allows evaluation of receptor trafficking in a large population of cells and in the absence of bound antibody (12Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Google Scholar). Substantial agonist-induced internalization of all receptor constructs tested was confirmed by the pronounced reduction in surface receptor immunoreactivity observed following incubation of cells in the presence of 10 μm DADLE for 25 min (Fig. 1E) (36Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharm. Sci.. 1997; 18: 276-287Google Scholar). Assay of surface receptor recovery after agonist washout established clearly that fusion of the ERMbd promoted recycling of receptors, as indicated by a nearly complete recovery of surface receptors that was indistinguishable in magnitude from that produced by fusion of the PDZbd itself (Fig. 1F). The statistical significance of ERMbd-promoted recycling, and its quantitative similarity to that promoted by the PDZbd, was confirmed by statistical analysis of flow cytometric data across multiple experiments (legend to Fig. 1). Direct Association of Receptors with the Actin Cytoskeleton Is Sufficient to Promote Efficient Recycling—Having established that the isolated ERMbd promotes recycling of engineered receptors, we next tested the sufficiency of direct receptor connectivity to actin. A conserved F-actin-binding domain (Abd) has been mapped to the carboxyl-terminal 34 residues of human ezrin, and shown to confer specific actin binding in vitro when fused to the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase (26Turunen O. Wahlstrom T. Vaheri A. J. Cell Biol.. 1994; 126: 1445-1453Google Scholar). Accordingly, we fused this sequence to the C terminus of the δOR (δOR-Abd fusion receptor, Fig. 2A) and assessed effects on endocytic trafficking.

https://openalex.org/W2087499202,"Background It is well known that CD1d-restricted Vα14 invariant natural killer T (NKT) cells are derived from cells in the CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) population in the thymus. However, the developmental progression of NKT cells in the earlier stages remains unclear, and the possible existence of NKT cell presursors in the earlier stages than DP stage remains to be tested. Principal Findings Here, we demonstrate that NKT cell precursors that express invariant Vα14-Jα18 transcripts but devoid of surface expression of the invariant Vα14 receptor are present in the late CD4−CD8− double-negative (DN)4 stage and have the potential to generate mature NKT cells in both in vivo and in vitro experimental conditions. Moreover, the DN4 population in CD1d knock-out (CD1dKO) mice was similar to those with an NKT cell potential in wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 (B6) mice, but failed to develop into NKT cells in vitro. However, these precursors could develop into NKT cells when co-cultured with normal thymocytes or in an in vivo experimental setting, indicating that functional NKT cell precursors are present in CD1dKO mice. Conclusions Together, these results demonstrate that thymic DN4 fraction contains NKT cell precursors. Our findings provide new insights into the early development of NKT cells prior to surface expression of the invariant Vα14 antigen receptor and suggest the possible alternative developmental pathway of NKT cells."
https://openalex.org/W2067234455,"Malaria continues to be the most lethal protozoan disease of humans. Drug development programs exhibit a high attrition rate and parasite resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs exacerbates the problem. Strategies that limit the development of resistance and minimize host side-effects are therefore of major importance. In this study, a novel approach, termed evolutionary patterning (EP), was used to identify suitable drug target sites that would minimize the emergence of parasite resistance. EP uses the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (ω) to assess the patterns of evolutionary change at individual codons in a gene and to identify codons under the most intense purifying selection (ω≤0.1). The extreme evolutionary pressure to maintain these residues implies that resistance mutations are highly unlikely to develop, which makes them attractive chemotherapeutic targets. Method validation included a demonstration that none of the residues providing pyrimethamine resistance in the Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase enzyme were under extreme purifying selection. To illustrate the EP approach, the putative P. falciparum glycerol kinase (PfGK) was used as an example. The gene was cloned and the recombinant protein was active in vitro, verifying the database annotation. Parasite and human GK gene sequences were analyzed separately as part of protozoan and metazoan clades, respectively, and key differences in the evolutionary patterns of the two molecules were identified. Potential drug target sites containing residues under extreme evolutionary constraints were selected. Structural modeling was used to evaluate the functional importance and drug accessibility of these sites, which narrowed down the number of candidates. The strategy of evolutionary patterning and refinement with structural modeling addresses the problem of targeting sites to minimize the development of drug resistance. This represents a significant advance for drug discovery programs in malaria and other infectious diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1973220260,"Background Probabilistic reaction norms (PRNs) are an extension of the concept of reaction norms, developed to account for stochasticity in ontogenetic transitions. However, logistic regression based PRNs are restricted to discrete time intervals, whereas previously proposed models for continuous transitions are demanding in terms of modelling effort and data needed. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we introduce two alternative approaches for the probabilistic modelling of continuous ontogenetic transitions. The models are simplified in their description of forces underlying transitions, thus being empirical rather than mechanistic by their nature, but therefore applicable to situations where data and prior knowledge of transitions are limited. The models provide continuous time description of the transition pattern, insights into how it is affected by covariates, at the same time allowing for fine scale transition probability predictions. Performance of the models is demonstrated using empirical data on metamorphosis in common frogs (Rana temporaria) reared in a common garden experiment. Conclusions/Significance As being user-friendly and methodologically easily accessible, the models introduced in this study aid the concept of probabilistic reaction norms becoming as general and applicable tool in the studies of life-history variation as the deterministic reaction norms are today."
