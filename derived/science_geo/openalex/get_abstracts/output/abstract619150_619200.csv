Current PDRC designs are promising alternatives to electrical cooling but are either inefficient or have limited applicability. We present a simple, inexpensive, and scalable phase inversion-based method for fabricating hierarchically porous poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) [P(VdF-HFP)HP] coatings with excellent PDRC capability. High, substrate-independent hemispherical solar reflectances (0.96 ± 0.03) and long-wave infrared emittances (0.97 ± 0.02) allow for subambient temperature drops of ~6°C and cooling powers of ~96 watts per square meter (W m-2) under solar intensities of 890 and 750 W m-2, respectively. The performance equals or surpasses those of state-of-the-art PDRC designs, and the technique offers a paint-like simplicity."

However, the molecular understanding of blastema formation had previously been hampered by the inability to identify and isolate blastema precursor cells in the adult tissue. We have used a combination of Cre-loxP reporter lineage tracking and single-cell messenger RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to molecularly track mature connective tissue (CT) cell heterogeneity and its transition to a limb blastema state. We have uncovered a multiphasic molecular program where CT cell types found in the uninjured adult limb revert to a relatively homogenous progenitor state that recapitulates an embryonic limb bud-like phenotype including multipotency within the CT lineage. Together, our data illuminate molecular and cellular reprogramming during complex organ regeneration in a vertebrate."

Their production was banned in the United States in 1978, though they are still produced globally and persist in the environment. Persistent organic compounds, like PCBs, magnify across trophic levels, and thus apex predators are particularly susceptible to their ill effects. Desforges et al. looked at the continuing impact of PCBs on one of the largest marine predators, the killer whale. Using globally available data, the authors found high concentrations of PCBs within killer whale tissues. These are likely to precipitate declines across killer whale populations, particularly those that feed at high trophic levels and are the closest to industrialized areas.

https://openalex.org/W2893361790,"Alkene aminoarylation with a single, bifunctional reagent is a concise synthetic strategy. We report a catalytic protocol for the addition of arylsulfonylacetamides across electron-rich alkenes with complete anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity and excellent diastereoselectivity to provide 2,2-diarylethylamines. In this process, single-electron alkene oxidation enables carbon-nitrogen bond formation to provide a key benzylic radical poised for a Smiles-Truce 1,5-aryl shift. This reaction is redox-neutral, exhibits broad functional group compatibility, and occurs at room temperature with loss of sulfur dioxide. As this process is driven by visible light, uses readily available starting materials, and demonstrates convergent synthesis, it is well suited for use in a variety of synthetic endeavors."
https://openalex.org/W2890753820,"The regulatory specificity of enhancers and their interaction with gene promoters is thought to be controlled by their sequence and the binding of transcription factors. By studying Pitx1, a regulator of hindlimb development, we show that dynamic changes in chromatin conformation can restrict the activity of enhancers. Inconsistent with its hindlimb-restricted expression, Pitx1 is controlled by an enhancer (Pen) that shows activity in forelimbs and hindlimbs. By Capture Hi-C and three-dimensional modeling of the locus, we demonstrate that forelimbs and hindlimbs have fundamentally different chromatin configurations, whereby Pen and Pitx1 interact in hindlimbs and are physically separated in forelimbs. Structural variants can convert the inactive into the active conformation, thereby inducing Pitx1 misexpression in forelimbs, causing partial arm-to-leg transformation in mice and humans. Thus, tissue-specific three-dimensional chromatin conformation can contribute to enhancer activity and specificity in vivo and its disturbance can result in gene misexpression and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2893221764,"Outcomes of anticancer therapy vary dramatically among patients due to diverse genetic and molecular backgrounds, highlighting extensive intertumoral heterogeneity. The fundamental tenet of precision oncology defines molecular characterization of tumors to guide optimal patient-tailored therapy. Towards this goal, we have established a compilation of pharmacological landscapes of 462 patient-derived tumor cells (PDCs) across 14 cancer types, together with genomic and transcriptomic profiling in 385 of these tumors. Compared with the traditional long-term cultured cancer cell line models, PDCs recapitulate the molecular properties and biology of the diseases more precisely. Here, we provide insights into dynamic pharmacogenomic associations, including molecular determinants that elicit therapeutic resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and the potential repurposing of ibrutinib (currently used in hematological malignancies) for EGFR-specific therapy in gliomas. Lastly, we present a potential implementation of PDC-derived drug sensitivities for the prediction of clinical response to targeted therapeutics using retrospective clinical studies. Analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data from 462 patient-derived tumor cell (PDC) samples across 14 cancer types, along with pharmacological responses to 60 agents, indicates that PDC-derived drug sensitivities might be predictive of clinical response to targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3098052061,"Controlling femtosecond optical pulses with temporal precision better than one cycle of the carrier field has a profound impact on measuring and manipulating interactions between light and matter. We explore pulses that are carved from a continuous-wave laser via electro-optic modulation and realize the regime of sub-cycle optical control without a mode-locked resonator. Our ultrafast source, with a repetition rate of 10 GHz, is derived from an optical-cavity-stabilized laser and a microwave-cavity-stabilized electronic oscillator. Sub-cycle timing jitter of the pulse train is achieved by coherently linking the laser and oscillator through carrier-envelope phase stabilization enabled by a photonic-chip supercontinuum that spans up to 1.9 octaves across the near infrared. Moreover, the techniques we report are relevant for other ultrafast lasers with repetition rates up to 30 GHz and may allow stable few-cycle pulses to be produced by a wider range of sources."

He et al. used a combination of CRISPR mutagenesis and short hairpin RNA–based gene knockdowns to interrogate Hox gene function in a cnidarian, the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (see the Perspective by Arendt). Four homeobox-containing genes constitute a molecular network that coordinately controls the morphogenesis of radial endodermal segments and the patterning of tentacles. Thus, an ancient Hox code may have evolved to regulate both tissue segmentation and body patterning in the bilaterian-cnidarian common ancestor. Science , this issue p. 1377 ; see also p. 1310"
https://openalex.org/W2894315454,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulatory molecules in various biological and pathological processes, including cancer development. We have previously shown that the MEG3 lncRNA plays an essential role in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)–induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of human lung cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the function of another lncRNA, MEG8, which shares the DLK1–DIO3 locus with MEG3, in the regulation of EMT. MEG8 lncRNA expression was immediately induced during TGF-β–mediated EMT of A549 and LC2/ad lung cancer and Panc1 pancreatic cancer cell lines. MEG8 overexpression specifically suppressed the expression of microRNA-34a and microRNA-203 genes, resulting in up-regulation of SNAIL family transcriptional repressor 1 (SNAI1) and SNAI2 transcription factors, which repressed expression of cadherin 1 (CDH1)/E-cadherin. Mechanistic investigations revealed that MEG8 associates with enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2) protein and induces its recruitment to the regulatory regions of the two microRNA genes for histone H3 methylation and transcriptional repression. Interestingly, expression of both MEG8 and MEG3, but not each individually, could induce EMT-related cell morphological changes and increased cell motility in the absence of TGF-β by activating the gene expression program required for EMT. MEG8 knockdown indicated that endogenous MEG8 lncRNA is indispensable for TGF-β–induced EMT in A549 lung cancer and Panc1 pancreatic cancer cells. Our findings indicate that MEG8 lncRNA significantly contributes to epigenetic EMT induction and increase our understanding of the lncRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms involved in malignant progression of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2894373629,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic skin disease of the pilo-sebaceous apocrine unit characterized by significant inflammation and an impaired quality of life. The pathogenesis of HS remains unclear. To determine the HS skin and blood transcriptomes and HS blood proteome, patient data from previously published studies were analysed and integrated from a cohort of patients with moderate to severe HS (n = 17) compared to healthy volunteers (n = 10). The analysis utilized empirical Bayes methods to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (fold change (FCH) >2.0 and false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05), and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) (FCH>1.5, FDR<0.05). In the HS skin transcriptome (lesional skin compared to non-lesional skin), there was an abundance of immunoglobulins, antimicrobial peptides, and an interferon signature. Gene-sets related to Notch signalling and Interferon pathways were differentially activated in lesional compared to non-lesional skin. CIBERSORT analysis of the HS skin transcriptome revealed a significantly increased proportion of plasma cells in lesional skin. In the HS skin and blood transcriptomes and HS blood proteome, gene-sets related to the complement system changed significantly (FDR<0.05), with dysregulation of complement-specific DEGs and DEPs. These data point towards an exaggerated immune response in lesional skin that may be responding to commensal cutaneous bacterial presence and raise the possibility that this may be an important driver of HS disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2894018010,"Warm water and big winds The 2017 North Atlantic hurricane season was highly active, with six major storms—nearly two standard deviations above the normal number. Three of those storms made landfall over the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean, causing terrible damage and loss. Why was the season so fierce? Murakami et al. used a suite of high-resolution model experiments to show that the main cause was pronounced warm sea surface conditions in the tropical North Atlantic. This effect was distinct from La Niña conditions in the Pacific Ocean that were involved in other years. It remains unclear how important anthropogenic forcing may be in causing such increased hurricane activity. Science , this issue p. 794"
https://openalex.org/W2892734654,"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF; now often referred to as CCN2) is a secreted protein predominantly expressed during development, in various pathological conditions that involve enhanced fibrogenesis and tissue fibrosis, and in several cancers and is currently an emerging target in several early-phase clinical trials. Tissues containing high CCN2 activities often display smaller degradation products of full-length CCN2 (FL-CCN2). Interpretation of these observations is complicated by the fact that a uniform protein structure that defines biologically active CCN2 has not yet been resolved. Here, using DG44 CHO cells engineered to produce and secrete FL-CCN2 and cell signaling and cell physiological activity assays, we demonstrate that FL-CCN2 is itself an inactive precursor and that a proteolytic fragment comprising domains III (thrombospondin type 1 repeat) and IV (cystine knot) appears to convey all biologically relevant activities of CCN2. In congruence with these findings, purified FL-CCN2 could be cleaved and activated following incubation with matrix metalloproteinase activities. Furthermore, the C-terminal fragment of CCN2 (domains III and IV) also formed homodimers that were ∼20-fold more potent than the monomeric form in activating intracellular phosphokinase cascades. The homodimer elicited activation of fibroblast migration, stimulated assembly of focal adhesion complexes, enhanced RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation of RAW264.7 cells, and promoted mammosphere formation of MCF-7 mammary cancer cells. In conclusion, CCN2 is synthesized and secreted as a preproprotein that is autoinhibited by its two N-terminal domains and requires proteolytic processing and homodimerization to become fully biologically active."

https://openalex.org/W2893312319,"To improve cancer patient outcome significantly, we must understand the mechanisms regulating stem-like cancer cells, which have been implicated as a cause of metastasis and treatment resistance. The transcription factor C/EBPδ can exhibit pro- and anti-tumorigenic activities, but the mechanisms underlying the complexity of its functions are poorly understood. Here we identify a role for breast cancer cell intrinsic C/EBPδ in promoting phenotypes that have been associated with cancer stem cells (CSCs). While C/EBPδ expression is not abundant in most metastatic breast cancers, our data support a pro-tumorigenic role of C/EBPδ when expressed in subsets of tumor cells and/or through transient activation by the tumor microenvironment or loss of substrate adhesion. Using genetic mouse models and human breast cancer cell lines, we show that deletion or depletion of C/EBPδ reduced expression of stem cell factors and stemnness markers, sphere formation and self-renewal, along with growth of tumors and established experimental metastases in vivo. C/EBPδ is also known as a mediator of the innate immune response, which is enhanced by hypoxia and interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling, two conditions that also play important roles in cancer progression. Our mechanistic data reveal C/EBPδ as a link that engages two positive feedback loops, in part by directly targeting the IL-6 receptor (IL6RA) gene, and, thus, amplifying IL-6 and HIF-1 signaling. This study provides a molecular mechanism for the synergism of tumor microenvironmental conditions in cancer progression with potential implications for the targeting of CSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2893942679,"It has been proposed that pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes is promoted by oxidative stress caused by NADPH oxidase (Nox) over-activity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of novel Nox inhibitors as protective agents against cytokine- or high glucose + palmitate-induced human beta-cell death. The Nox2 protein was present mainly in the cytoplasm and was induced by cytokines. Nox4 protein immunoreactivity, with some nuclear accumulation, was observed in human islet cells, and was not affected by islet culture in the presence of cytokines or high glucose + palmitate. Nox inhibitors with partial or no isoform selectivity (DPI, dapsone, GLX351322, and GLX481372) all reduced ROS production of human islet cells exposed to high glucose + palmitate. This was paralleled by improved viability and reduced caspase 3 activation. The Nox1 selective inhibitor ML171 failed to reduce human islet cell death in response to both cytokines and high glucose + palmitate. The selective Nox2 inhibitor Phox-I2 also failed to protect against cytokines, but protected partially against high glucose + palmitate-induced cellular death. The highly selective Nox4 inhibitor GLX7013114 protected islet cells against both cytokines and high glucose + palmitate. However, as no osmotic control for high glucose was used, we cannot exclude the possibility that the high glucose effect was due to osmosis. It is concluded that Nox4 may participate in stress-induced islet cell death in human islets in vitro. We propose that Nox4 mediates pro-apoptotic effects in intact islets under stressful conditions and that selective Nox4-inhibition may be a therapeutic strategy in type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2893228210,"Oxidative damage is implicated in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The dry form of AMD (geographic atrophy) is characterized by loss of RPE, photoreceptors, and macular pigments. The cumulative effects of oxidative stress impact mitochondrial function in RPE. In Sod2flox/floxVMD2-cre mice, the RPE specific deletion of Sod2, the gene for mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), leads to elevated oxidative stress in retina and RPE, and causes changes in the RPE and underlying Bruch’s membrane that share some features of AMD. This study tested the hypothesis that zeaxanthin supplementation would reduce oxidative stress and preserve RPE structure and function in these mice. Zeaxanthin in retina/RPE/choroid and liver was quantified by LC/MS, retinal function and structure were evaluated by electroretinogram (ERG) and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and antioxidant gene expression was measured by RT-PCR. After one month of supplementation, zeaxanthin levels were 5-fold higher in the retina/RPE/choroid and 12-fold higher in liver than in unsupplemented control mice. After four months of supplementation, amplitudes of the ERG a-wave (function of rod photoreceptors) and b-wave (function of the inner retina) were not different in supplemented and control mice. In contrast, the c-wave amplitude (a measure of RPE function) was 28% higher in supplemented mice than in control mice. Higher RPE/choroid expression of antioxidant genes (Cat, Gstm1, Hmox1, Nqo1) and scaffolding protein Sqstm1 were found in supplemented mice than in unsupplemented controls. Reduced nitrotyrosine content in the RPE/choroid was demonstrated by ELISA. Preliminary assessment of retinal ultrastructure indicated that supplementation supported better preservation of RPE structure with more compact basal infoldings and intact mitochondria. We conclude that daily zeaxanthin supplementation protected RPE cells from mitochondrial oxidative stress associated with deficiency in the MnSOD and thereby improved RPE function early in the disease course."

The study aims to investigate the role of PDGF-AA in adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) enhancing wound healing. In this study, ASCs and EPCs were applied to treat wounds in an animal wound model with a wound-healing assay. We knocked down PDGF-AA expression in ASCs using the PDGF-AA short hairpin RNA technique and investigated the related molecular mechanism. The wound model and wound-healing assay of the study showed that transplantation of ASCs could enhance wound healing. The results showed that the PDGF-AA knockdown ASC group had much less improvement of wound healing than other groups treated with wild-type ASCs in wound tissues. The regulation of PDGF-AA in ASCs may contribute to improve wound healing through the PI3K7Akt/eNOS signaling pathway. The data indicated that PDGF-AA might play a vital role in ASCs and EPCs enhancing wound healing, possibly by its effects on angiogenesis. It would be a potential approach using PDGF-AA for clinical treatment of chronic wounds.—Wu, L.-W., Chen, W.-L., Huang, S.-M., Chan, J. Y.-H.

https://openalex.org/W2894132870,"Perturbations in the gastrointestinal microbiome caused by antibiotics are a major risk factor for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Probiotics are often recommended to mitigate CDI symptoms; however, there exists only limited evidence showing probiotic efficacy for CDI. Here, we examined changes to the GI microbiota in a study population where probiotic treatment was associated with significantly reduced duration of CDI diarrhea. Subjects being treated with standard of care antibiotics for a primary episode of CDI were randomized to probiotic treatment or placebo for 4 weeks. Probiotic treatment consisted of a daily multi-strain capsule (Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, ATCC 700396; Lactobacillus paracasei Lpc-37, ATCC SD5275; Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07, ATCC SC5220; Bifidobacterium lactis B1-04, ATCC SD5219) containing 1.7 x 1010 CFUs. Stool was collected and analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Microbiome analysis revealed apparent taxonomic differences between treatments and timepoints. Subjects administered probiotics had reduced Verrucomicrobiaceae at week 8 compared to controls. Bacteroides were significantly reduced between weeks 0 to 4 in probiotic treated subjects. Ruminococcus (family Lachnospiraceae), tended to be more abundant at week 8 than week 4 within the placebo group and at week 8 than week 0 within the probiotic group. Similar to these results, previous studies have associated these taxa with probiotic use and with mitigation of CDI symptoms. Compositional prediction of microbial community function revealed that subjects in the placebo group had microbiomes enriched with the iron complex transport system, while probiotic treated subjects had microbiomes enriched with the antibiotic transport system. Results indicate that probiotic use may impact the microbiome function in the face of a CDI; yet, more sensitive methods with higher resolution are warranted to better elucidate the roles associated with these changes. Continuing studies are needed to better understand probiotic effects on microbiome structure and function and the resulting impacts on CDI."

Skin color is among the major objectives for breeding. Yellow skin is an important trait in watermelon, but the underlying genetic mechanism is unknown. In this study, we identified a locus for yellow skin through BSA-seq and GWAS. A segregation analysis in F2 and BC1 populations derived from a cross of two inbred lines ‘94E1’(yellow skin) and ‘Qingfeng’(green skin) suggested that skin color is a qualitative trait. BSA-seq mapping confirmed the locus in the F2 population, which was detected on chromosome 4 by GWAS among 330 varieties. Several major markers, namely, 15 CAPS markers, 6 SSR markers and 2 SNP markers, were designed to delimit the region to 59.8 kb region on chromosome 4. Utilizing the two populations consisting of 10 yellow and 10 green skin watermelons, we found a tightly linked functional SNP marker for the yellow skin phenotype. The application of this marker as a selection tool in breeding programs will help to improve the breeder’s ability to make selections at early stages of growth, thus accelerating the breeding program."

Indeed, recent evidence suggests that CS is a priority nutrient for prominent gut microbes such as Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bacteroides ovatus and that only a subset of HGM species are capable of metabolizing the GAG (13Pudlo N.A.

Understanding how GAGs are metabolized could therefore inform strategies including nutrient-based approaches to manipulate the HGM and hence improve human health. In line with this, several studies (reviewed by Ndeh and Gilbert (18Ndeh D. Gilbert H.J. Biochemistry of complex glycan depolymerisation by the human gut microbiota.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2018; 42 (29325042): 146-16410.1093/femsre/fuy002Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar)) have examined the metabolism of dietary GAGs by the HGM. The results demonstrate that GAG degradation is largely orchestrated by a combination of three major enzyme types including polysaccharide lyases (PLs, EC 4.2.2.-), sulfatases (EC 3.1.6.-), and glycoside hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-). In the model human gut microbe B. thetaiotaomicron, as well as other gut Bacteroidetes, the genes encoding these enzymes are typically located within polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) (14Raghavan V. Groisman E.A. Species-specific dynamic responses of gut bacteria to a mammalian glycan.J.

These genetic loci are diverse and encode a variety of cell envelope–associated multiprotein systems involved in complex glycan metabolism. Although the mechanisms of various GAG PULs in these organisms have been extensively investigated, knowledge of their functioning is incomplete, evident by the presence of as-yet uncharacterized GAG-inducible genes within these PULs (21Terrapon N. Lombard V. Gilbert H.J. Henrissat B.

In the CS PUL of B. thetaiotaomicron, three of such genes, BT_3328, BT_3329, and BT_3330 (all of unknown function), appear in a distinct operon (BT_3328–30) conserved in several HGM Bacteroidetes (14Raghavan V.

The latter suggests that they might be an important adaptation for CS metabolism in these microbes. Here, we characterized the largest member of this operon (BT_3328), revealing that it encodes a novel polysaccharide lyase hereafter referred to as BtCDH, reflecting its source (B. thetaiotaomicron (Bt)) and ability to degrade the GAGs CS, DS, and HA. We also provide evidence suggesting that BtCDH is not only the founding member of a novel enzyme family but also a cell surface GAG-degrading enzyme, the first to be reported in B. thetaiotaomicron and related species. Taken together, our findings contribute new insights into our knowledge of CS metabolism by the HGM, a key player in host–microbial interactions. The gene encoding native BtCDH lyase (BT_3328 from B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482) is 2607 bp in length and has a GC content of 51%. BtCDH is a large protein of 868 amino acid residues, a molecular mass of 96 kDa, and an isoelectric pI of 5.33. A majority of the top hits (>50% identity) from a BLASTp search with native BtCDH are hypothetical/putative uncharacterized proteins mainly annotated as DUF4955 domain–containing. The DUF4955 domain whose function is unknown is present at the C terminus of the protein, whereas another domain DUF4988 is located directly after the putative lipoprotein signal peptide sequence at the N terminus of the protein (Fig. 1A). Top BtCDH lyase homologs were mostly detected in species from the Bacteroides, Alistipes, and Prevotella genera, all highly represented in the HGM. They were also prominent in species from marine environments including Saccharophagus degradans, Zobellia galactinovorans, Vibrio harveyi, and Coraliomargarita akajimensis. A phylogenetic tree of selected homologs of BtCDH is presented in Fig. 1B. Purified recombinant BtCDH was initially assayed spectrophotometrically using CS from bovine trachea (which is mainly CS-4 sulfate or CSA (22Shaya D. Hahn B.-S. Park N.Y. Sim J.-S. Kim Y.S. Cygler M. Characterization of chondroitin sulfate lyase ABC from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron WAL2926.Biochemistry. 2008; 47 (18512954): 6650-666110.1021/bi800353gCrossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 2A) as substrate. BtCDH degraded CSA generating unsaturated products that were detected by TLC and high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) using a UV detector at 235 nm (A235) (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively). Limit products of the reaction were also resolved by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and analyzed by 1H NMR (Fig. 2D and Fig. S1). Distinct resonance signals were detected at 5.9 and 5.2 ppm in the spectra of the digested products as opposed to undigested CSA. The former is evidence of a H4 proton chemical shift consistent with glyosidic bond cleavage and the generation of C4,5 double bonds (Δ4,5) in the terminal nonreducing end GlcA or uronic acid (UA) residue (Δ4,5UA) of various products, whereas the latter peak at 5.2 ppm corresponds to resonance signals of the H1 anomeric proton of the same sugar (Fig. 2D) (23Rani A.

To explore the substrate specificity in BtCDH in more detail, the enzyme was also tested against a series of commercially available uronic acid-based substrates including CS from shark cartilage (mainly CS-6 sulfate or CSC), DS from porcine intestinal mucosa (mainly DS-4 sulfate), high and low molecular weight HA sodium salt from Streptococcus equi (10,000–30,000 (HAL) and 90,000–110,000 Da (HAH), respectively), heparin, alginate, ulvan, and polygalacturonic acid. BtCDH was active against CS DS and HA (in the order CSC > CSA/HAL > DS > HAH) but not heparin, alginate, ulvan, and polygalacturonic acid (Table 1). Previous studies analyzing CSA and CSC have reported major differences in the sulfated disaccharide composition of both substrates with the most prominent being the levels of the ΔUA-GalNAc4S, which is higher in CSA, and ΔUA-GalNAc6S, which is higher in CSC (12Ulmer J.E.

BtCDH activity thus appears to be affected by the type of sulfation in the GAG substrates.Table 1Activity of BtCDH lyase against various uronate substrates To determine whether BtCDH was endo- or exo-acting, we performed time-course experiments with HAL, a less chemically complex GAG compared with its sulfated counterparts. HAL was incubated with BtCDH over different times (0, 1, 5, and 60 min and ∼12 h (overnight), after which reactions were stopped by boiling and analyzed by TLC. BtCDH degraded HAL within 10 min, generating a fast migrating band (band A) (Fig. 3A). After 1 h of the reaction, the original HAL spot at the origin disappeared accompanied by the appearance another major band (band B), as well as low staining intermittent bands (Fig. 3A). The pattern of products remained unchanged even after overnight digestion, and hence the generated sugars represented the final limit products of HAL digestion. Bands A and B limit products were purified by SEC and analyzed by MS (HILIC LC-MS). Purified Band A yielded incremental masses of 380.117, 381.120, and 382.123 Da (differing by a mass of 1 Da) equivalent to the mass of singly charged ions of the unsaturated Δ4,5UA-GlcNAc disaccharide, whereas band B yielded incremental masses of 759.227, 759.729, and 760.230 Da (differing by a mass of 0.5 Da) etc. (Fig. 3B), equivalent to the mass of doubly charged fragments derived from the unsaturated Δ4,5UA-[GlcNAc-GlcA]3-GlcNAc octasaccharide parent ion. To detect underrepresented sugars, all SEC fractions were pooled in one sample and analyzed. The spectra revealed the presence of new products with incremental masses of 759.226, 760.230, and 761.232 (differing by a mass of 1 Da) and 1138.337, 1139.340, and 1140.344 (differing by a mass of 1 Da), corresponding to singly charged ions of the unsaturated Δ4,5UA-GlcNAc-GlcA-GlcNAc tetrasaccharide and Δ4,5UA-[GlcNAc-GlcA]2-GlcNAc hexasaccharide sugars, respectively (Fig. 3B). The generation of diverse molecular weight limit products thus suggests that BtCDH is an endo-acting enzyme. In addition, the accumulation of the high molecular weight HA octasaccharide suggests that BtCDH preferentially cleaves sugars with a degree of polymerization (DP) typically ≥10. The requirement for substrates with a DP ≥ 10 was also demonstrated using sulfated CS oligosaccharides as substrates with HPAEC data showing a major shift in the DP10 oligosaccharide profile (as opposed to a minor shift for DP8) after treatment with BtCDH (Fig. 4). The proportion of each HA product generated was also determined by UV with the results showing that over 70% of the generated products were Δ4,5UA-GlcNAc disaccharides (Fig. S2). Time-course experiments with sulfated GAGs CSA and CSC as substrates also yielded fairly similar patterns observed for HAL (Fig. S3). As with HAL, high amounts of the basic disaccharide building block (Δ4,5UA-GalNAc) were detected, suggesting high processivity in the enzyme.Figure 4Activity of BtCDH against various chondroitin sulfate oligosaccharides. Substrates (1 mg/ml each) were treated with 0.5 μm of BtCDH (shown as DPx +, with x being the number of constituent monosaccharides) overnight or diluted in equivalent volume of buffer as control (DPx). HPAEC chromatograms show major shifts in the signals of sulfated DP10 and DP12 oligosaccharides following treatment, accompanied by the appearance of a strong signals for the Δ4,5UA-GalNAc disaccharide in each case.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effects of temperature, pH and metal ions on BtCDH activity were tested with CSA as substrate. BtCDH preferred higher reaction temperatures with the activity increasing linearly from 20 °C to a maximum rate of ∼15 μm/min at 60 °C (Fig. 5A). After this optimum temperature, the enzyme activity dropped sharply. To determine the optimum pH of BtCDH, enzyme activity was examined against CSA in different buffers over a pH range of 4–9. BtCDH activity rose gradually with increase pH between 4 and 6 and then sharply to an optimum pH of 7.0 in 10 mm MES buffer (Fig. 5B). BtCDH activity against CS was also tested in the presence of 5 mm EDTA and metal ions including Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+, and Ni2+. Its activity was only slightly affected by metals with the most inhibition (27.42%) observed in the presence of Co2+ ions (Fig. 5C). A genetic mutant ΔBtCDH lacking the entire ORF for BtCDH (the BT_3328 gene) was created by counter selectable allelic exchange. Growth experiments with both B. thetaiotaomicron WT and ΔBtCDH strains were carried out with four different GAG substrates CSA, DS, CSC, HAL, and glucose as sole carbon source for at least 24 h. B. thetaiotaomicron WT and BtCDH cells grew at a very similar rates on various substrates, except for CSC where a minor defect in late phase growth was observed (Fig. S4). Rabbit anti-BtCDH polyclonal antibodies where generated using the recombinant BtCDH protein as immunogen. On Western blots containing cell-free extracts of B. thetaiotaomicron grown on CSA, two immunosensitive bands (BtCDHH and BtCDHL of high and low molecular weights, respectively) were detected (Fig. 6A). Despite its poor enrichment relative to BtCDHL, BtCDHH’s molecular weight was close to 96 kDa, corresponding to the mass of native BtCDH, whereas the mass of BtCDHL was ∼30 kDa. Interestingly, when cell extracts of the ΔBtCDH strain lacking BtCDH were tested with the same antibodies, both bands were not detected, suggesting that BtCDHL is a subcomponent possibly a truncated form of BtCDH (Fig. 6A, top panel). To confirm this, BtCDH was FLAG-tagged (BtCDH FLAG) by genetically introducing a FLAG peptide sequence (DYKDDDK) at the C-terminal of the protein, thus allowing for its detection using rabbit anti-FLAG specific antibodies. Under these circumstances, only BtCDHH was detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 6A), suggesting that BtCDHL was an N-terminal truncated version of BtCDH. As indicated earlier, BtCDH contains an N-terminal lipidation sequence (Fig. 1A) and hence is potentially localized extracellularly at the cell surface of B. thetaiotaomicron. To confirm this experimentally, we performed proteinase K (PK) and immunofluorescence assays. B. thetaiotaomicron WT cells were grown to exponential phase in 1% CSA, harvested, and treated with 0.5 mg/ml PK. Treated and untreated cells (controls) were lysed under reducing conditions, and cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-BtCDH antibodies. The results showed degradation of BtCDHL and BtCDHH in PK-treated but not control cells (Fig. 6B). The experiment was also controlled by immunoblotting the same extracts with polyclonal antibodies targeting the constitutively expressed periplasmic heparin lyase BT4657 (16Cartmell A. Lowe E.C.

The data thus suggest that BtCDH is localized to cell surface of B. thetaiotaomicron. The cell-surface localization of BtCDH was finally confirmed through immunofluorescence assays using anti-BtCDH antibodies (Fig. 6C). We also performed whole-cell aerobic assays on B. thetaiotaomicron WT and ΔBtCDH following growth on CSA. Under these conditions, transport across the outer membrane is limited, and only surface enzyme activity is detected. The cells were harvested at exponential phase and reincubated with CSA and CSC for 2 h, and the reaction was examined by TLC. The results showed extensive degradation of both CSA and CSC by the WT strain, visible as a smear of products (Fig. 6D). This was significantly reduced in the knockout strain especially for the CSA substrate in which just a single band of generated product was observed (Fig. 6D). Supernatants at exponential phase were also analyzed for secreted BtCDH by Western blotting with polyclonal rabbit anti-BtCDH ant"

Cancer resistance to androgen deprivation therapies ensues when tumors engage metabolic processes that produce sustained androgen levels in the tissue. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this resistance process are unclear, and functional imaging modalities that predict impending resistance are lacking. Here, using the human LNCaP and C4-2 cell line models of prostate cancer, we show that castration treatment–sensitive prostate cancer cells that normally have an intact glucuronidation pathway that rapidly conjugates and inactivates dihydrotestosterone and thereby limits androgen signaling, become glucuronidation deficient and resistant to androgen deprivation. Mechanistically, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene ablation, we found that loss of UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 2 member B15 (UGT2B15) and UGT2B17 is sufficient to restore free dihydrotestosterone, sustained androgen signaling, and development of castration resistance. Furthermore, loss of glucuronidation enzymatic activity was also detectable with a nonsteroid glucuronidation substrate. Of note, glucuronidation-incompetent cells and the resultant loss of intracellular conjugated dihydrotestosterone were detectable in vivo by 18F-dihydrotestosterone PET. Together, these findings couple a mechanism with a functional imaging modality to identify impending castration resistance in prostate cancers.

CRPC is also accompanied by tumors developing the metabolic capability of regenerating their own potent androgens, i.e. testosterone and/or dihydrotestosterone (DHT), from extragonadal precursor steroids (5Montgomery R.B.

The role and requirement for extragonadal androgen synthesis in advanced prostate cancer was recently bolstered by a profound prolongation of survival in clinical trials of patients treated upfront with extragonadal androgen synthesis inhibition in addition to castration (8James N.D. de Bono J.S.

The metabolic mechanisms that enable sustained tissue concentrations of potent androgens in CRPC that occurs alongside the absence of gonadal testosterone in circulation remain poorly understood. Furthermore, imaging for prostate cancer is very limited and mainly focused on tumor localization. There is a complete absence of functional imaging approaches that are informative of the metabolic state of the disease that provides information on tumor susceptibility to systemic therapies in the clinical standard of care. Glucuronidation is a major mechanism of androgen inactivation that normally limits AR stimulation and downstream signaling in peripheral tissues, including prostatic tissues (10Barbier O. Bélanger A. Inactivation of androgens by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in the human prostate.Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 22 (18471784): 259-27010.1016/j.beem.2008.01.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The 17β-OH group of testosterone and DHT make them substrates for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes to form their respective inactivated glucuronide metabolites. In humans, testosterone is glucuronidated primarily by UGT2B7 and -17, and DHT is glucuronidated by UGT2B7, -15, and -17 (11Sten T. Bichlmaier I. Kuuranne T. Leinonen A. Yli-Kauhaluoma J. Finel M. UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 2B7 and UGT2B17 display converse specificity in testosterone and epitestosterone glucuronidation, whereas UGT2A1 conjugates both androgens similarly.Drug Metab.

We show here that a profound metabolic switch marked by loss of glucuronidation enzymatic activity occurs in CRPC, protects intratumoral testosterone and/or DHT from its normal mechanism of tissue inactivation, and allows androgens from extragonadal origins to be sustained, thus enabling persistent AR signaling. We also show that positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging can be used to distinguish glucuronidation proficient tumors from their glucuronidation incompetent and androgen deprivation-resistant descendants. The LNCaP human cell line model of prostate cancer and its C4-2 derivative, which was developed as a resistant model by repeatedly propagating LNCaP through castrated mice (13Thalmann G.N. Anezinis P.E. Chang S.M. Zhau H.E. Kim E.E. Hopwood V.L. Pathak S. von Eschenbach A.C. Chung L.W. Androgen-independent cancer progression and bone metastasis in the LNCaP model of human prostate cancer.Cancer Res. 1994; 54 (8168083): 2577-2581PubMed Google Scholar), probably represent the most widely utilized human matched models of castration-sensitive (formerly known as “androgen-sensitive”) and castration-resistant (formerly known as “androgen-independent”) prostate cancer. Development of resistance by way of a truly androgen-independent mechanism would be expected to occur without the acquisition of an androgen-sustaining metabolic phenotype. In contrast, we found that although the LNCaP model normally rapidly inactivates DHT by glucuronidation, the C4-2 model has completely lost this enzymatic activity. For example, 3 h after DHT treatment, all DHT in media is glucuronidated in the LNCaP model and all detectable DHT remains free in the C4-2 model (Fig. 1A). This results in a marked prolongation of cellular exposure to DHT in media (Fig. 1B) and as well as in the intracellular space (Fig. 1C). UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 are the 2 major enzymes that are responsible for androgen glucuronidation in prostate cancer (10Barbier O. Bélanger A. Inactivation of androgens by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in the human prostate.Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 22 (18471784): 259-27010.1016/j.beem.2008.01.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14Bao B.Y. Chuang B.F. Wang Q. Sartor O. Balk S.P. Brown M. Kantoff P.W. Lee G.S.

The transition from LNCaP to the resistant C4-2 model is accompanied by a profound loss of expression of the glucuronidation machinery (Fig. 1, D and E), which accounts for the apparent switch in metabolic phenotype (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the loss of glucuronidation activity that occurs in the C4-2 model that allows the persistence of free DHT is attributable to the development of castration-resistance, LNCaP xenografts were grown in eugonadal or castrated mice and xenograft tissues were interrogated for DHT glucuronidation activity (Fig. 2A). A subset of these tumors lose the capability of rapidly inactivating DHT, which otherwise consistently occurs with LNCaP xenografts grown in eugonadal mice. Expression of UGT2B15 protein was assessed and is lost in tumors with metabolic phenotypes that permit high free DHT compared with those that restrict DHT maintenance (Fig. 2B). A tumor subclone was grown from a xenograft selected for the absence of an ability to inactivate free DHT (Fig. 2A) and stably displayed glucuronidation incompetence (Fig. 2C) that is attributable to loss of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 expression (Fig. 2D). Together, these results suggest that coordinate UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 loss commonly occurs in the transition to CRPC. To determine whether the androgen-glucuronidation incompetence that occurs in the transition from LNCaP to C4-2 cells is attributable to loss of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17, CRISPR-Cas was employed to genetically ablate these two genes, resulting in loss of transcript and protein expression (Fig. 3, A and B). Loss of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 in LNCaP is sufficient to block glucuronidation and maintain persistence of free testosterone and DHT in media to an extent that is comparable with that which occurs in C4-2 cells (Fig. 3C). UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 loss also enables sustained intracellular free DHT, as assessed with radioactive signal emitted from [3H]DHT (Fig. 3D) and with the DHT concentration assessed by LC tandem-MS (LC-MS/MS; Fig. 3E). In contrast, glucuronidated androgens predominate to a much greater extent in Ctrl compared with UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 knockout cells (Fig. S1). Furthermore, the concentration of intracellular testosterone and DHT is also augmented in cells that are UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 deficient when treated with DHEA, a major adrenal precursor steroid that is converted to more potent androgens by steroidogenic enzymes (Fig. 3F). Castration-resistant growth of C4-2 cells is generally thought to be androgen independent (15Asim M. Siddiqui I.A. Hafeez B.B. Baniahmad A. Mukhtar H. Src kinase potentiates androgen receptor transactivation function and invasion of androgen-independent prostate cancer C4–2 cells.Oncogene. 2008; 27 (18223692): 3596-360410.1038/sj.onc.1211016Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar16Krueckl S.L.

We sought to determine whether the loss of androgen-glucuronidation activity in this model allows for exaggerated and more sustainable responses to a single treatment with a low concentration of DHT that would provide an alternative explanation to androgen-independent mechanisms. C4-2 cells treated with DHT (10 nm) indeed have sustained induction of DHT-stimulated androgen-responsive gene expression (PSA, FKBP5, and TMPRSS2) compared with the original LNCaP model (Fig. 4A). Genetic elimination of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 expression from LNCaP recapitulates sustained induction of androgen-regulated transcripts relative to expression in glucuronidation-competent cells (Fig. 4B) and results in augmented responses to direct treatment over a concentration range of DHT (Fig. 4C) as well as the adrenal precursor DHEA (Fig. 4D). Unimpeded exposure to DHEA, testosterone, and DHT, due to loss of glucuronidation activity enables rapid cell proliferation (Fig. 4E) and hastened development of CRPC in vivo (Fig. 4F). Reinstatement of glucuronidation activity reverses prostate cancer accessibility to sustained active DHT (Fig. 4G) and restricts castration-resistant growth (Fig. 4H). We set out to explore alternative approaches that might be feasible for noninvasively distinguishing between androgen-glucuronidation-proficient and androgen-glucuronidation-deficient tumors by exploiting changes in the balance between free versus conjugated substrates of glucuronidation. We reasoned that under certain circumstances, nonsteroid substrates of glucuronidation might be advantageous as alternatives to steroid substrates. SCH23390 is a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist that is also a substrate for hepatic glucuronidation (19Tephly T.R. Coffman B. Styczynski P. Rios G. Charkowski D.M. Vanrollins M. McQuade R.D. Tedford C.E. Studies on the glucuronidation of dopamine D-1 receptor antagonists, SCH 39166 and SCH 23390, by human liver microsomes.Drug Metab. Dispos. 1994; 22 (7835222): 713-718PubMed Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that [3H]SCH23390 is clearly glucuronidated by prostate cancer cells, although it appears to be a less effective substrate compared with DHT (Fig. 5A). Similar to androgen glucuronidation, SCH23390 glucuronidation is genetically reversible with loss of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 (Fig. 5B). However, our attempts to image prostate cancer xenografts with [11C]SCH23390 resulted in very little tumor radiotracer uptake. Next, we reasoned that a pulse-chase approach using [3H]DHT would mimic in vivo conditions for PET imaging with 18F-DHT. [3H]DHT treatment followed by a chase yields higher total radioactivity in glucuronidation-proficient cells compared with glucuronidation-deficient cells that is greatest at earliest time points and diminishes over the washout time (Fig. 5C). Cellular radioactivity residing in the aqueous (glucuronidated) and organic (free) phases of steroid extraction demonstrate that the increase in cellular signal in the glucuronidation-proficient cells is attributable to glucuronidated DHT (Fig. 5D). It should be noted that these data differ from Fig. 3D, which is instead done with continuous DHT treatment, as opposed to a pulse-chase approach. To determine whether the intracellular glucuronidated fraction could be further selectively increased in glucuronidation-competent cells, we performed similar experiments with cyclosporin A (CSA) co-treatment, which is known to inhibit membrane transporters that normally export intracellular substrates and would therefore be expected to increase cellular glucuronidated DHT retention (20Giacomini K.M. Huang S.M. Tweedie D.J. Benet L.Z. Brouwer K.L. Chu X. Dahlin A. Evers R. Fischer V. Hillgren K.M. Hoffmaster K.A. Ishikawa T. Keppler D. Kim R.B. Lee C.A. et al.International Transporter ConsortiumMembrane transporters in drug development.Nat. Rev. 2010; 9 (20190787): 215-23610.1038/nrd3028Google Scholar). CSA selectively increases radioactivity attributable to [3H]DHT in cells with intact glucuronidation activity (Fig. 5E) and only augments the glucuronidated DHT fraction without any change in intracellular free DHT (Fig. S2). Finally, we sought to determine whether preferential retention is demonstrable in glucuronidation-competent prostate cancer with 18F-DHT and PET imaging. Matched xenografts that are glucuronidation-competent (Ctrl) and UGT2B15/UGT2B17-defective LNCaP (KO) were grown in mice and treated with CSA immediately prior to administration of 18F-DHT and microPET-CT scanning (Fig. 5F). Control tumors demonstrated higher maximum tracer uptake and more rapid washout compared with KO tumors. There was no difference in AR protein expression between Ctrl and KO cells, supporting a model in which the increase in 18F-DHT uptake in Ctrl tumors occurs independent of AR content (Fig. S3). Together, these results demonstrate that the glucuronidation-deficient metabolic phenotype, which occurs in the transition to castration resistance is detectable with a timed PET imaging approach that assesses the tumor's functional metabolic status.

One of the themes that has emerged from these rich studies is that although there is an incredible level of genetic heterogeneity on one hand, there is also a requirement for a common set of pathways that drive tumor progression and resistance to systemic therapies. Another theme that has developed is the dynamic nature of the repertoire of somatic genetic aberrations, which evolves through response and resistance to systemic treatments (24Carreira S. Romanel A.

Long missing have been imaging modalities that capture aspects of the biologic state of the disease in a way that reflects on tumor susceptibility to response or resistance to systemic therapies. Functional imaging modalities are required to capture the dynamic evolution of metastatic tumors that are spatially and temporally separated. No such imaging modalities are currently employed in standard clinical practice, which are usually instead employed to determine tumor size and/or localization (27Harmon S.A. Perk T. Lin C.

As currently used, 18F-DHT does not offer any advantages over 18F-deoxyglucose for metastatic prostate cancer localization and neither are routinely used for clinical management (29Feldman J.L.

PET imaging with 18F-DHT was mainly developed as a high-affinity ligand for localization and expression of AR ligand binding in prostate cancer (31Liu A. Carlson K.E. Katzenellenbogen J.A.

In our study, we found no increase in AR protein expression in glucuronidation-proficient tumors (Fig. S3), thus excluding the possibility that the increase in 18F-DHT signal that we show in these tumors is due to the known effect and affinity of 18F-DHT for AR (30Larson S.M.

In fact, a decrease in free 18F-DHT and AR binding occurring in glucuronidation-proficient tumors probably blunts the detectable difference in PET signal with glucuronidation-defective prostate cancer (Fig. 5). We would anticipate that development of a nonsteroidal glucuronidation substrate may therefore in fact exhibit an accentuated difference in tracer retention between these tumor types. Although we demonstrated that the prostatic glucuronidation machinery that normally physiologically inactivates androgens also conjugates the (nonsteroid) substrate SCH23390, tumor uptake was negligible. Nonetheless, this approach with nonsteroid substrates should be explored further in future studies. Our approach in some ways mimics the strategy used for the development and use of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose. Both strategies have in common the use of a tracer that undergoes intracellular modification to a polar and membrane-impermeable metabolite that may be trapped in cells. Although we demonstrate a proof of principle approach for noninvasive detection of a switch in enzymatic steroid inactivation, we acknowledge that our approach may benefit from further optimization. Finally, we highlight the discovery of a novel metabolic phenotype that enables the sustenance of elevated intratumoral androgens in androgen deprivation therapy resistance, specifically by way of a mechanism downstream of biologically active androgens that blocks intratumoral androgen loss. These studies complement known mechanisms upstream of biologically active androgens that increase synthesis from extragonadal androgen precursor steroids.

Methods A retrospective study was conducted from March 2012 to May 2016 in Fuxing Hospital, Capital University of Medical Science. We collected 906 cases (525 males, 381 females, mean age 81.86±9.75 years) diagnosed with AECOPD. The NLR was calculated from their white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil (NEU), and lymphocyte (LYM) counts, which were obtained at laboratory examination. Result After treatment, 698 patients with AECOPD improved. The NLR was higher at admission (6.89±6.82) than after treatment (4.19±5.11) (P = 0.000). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the NLR for predicting the 28-day mortality rate was 0.737. Using 8.130 as the critical NLR value, the sensitivity was 60.5%, and the specificity was 74.8%. The AUC of the NLR for predicting the frequency of the need for invasive mechanical ventilation was 0.732. Using 10.345 as the critical NLR value, the sensitivity was 54.3%, and the specificity was 84.8%. The AUC of WBC, NEU and LYM for predicting 28-day mortality and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in these patients were all less than 0.7. An increased NLR was an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality (OR = 1.067, 95% CI = 1.039 to 1.095, P = 0.000), intensive care unit occupancy (OR = 1.046, 95% CI = 1.023 to 1.068, P = 0.000), and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.042, 95% CI = 1.019 to 1.066, P = 0.000). Compared with those patients without comorbidities, patients with renal dysfunction or upper gastrointestinal bleeding had an increased risk of death within 28 days (OR = 3.102, 95% CI = 1.525 to 6.312; OR = 4.598, 95% CI = 1.825 to 11.583, respectively), ICU admission (OR = 2.228, 95% CI = 1.286 to 3.860; OR = 3.103, 95% CI = 1.402 to 6.866, respectively), and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (OR = 3.572, 95% CI = 1.822 to 7.000; OR = 4.279, 95% CI = 1.823 to 10.045, respectively). Conclusion In patients with AECOPD, the accuracy of the NLR for predicting the 28-day mortality rate and frequency of the need for mechanical ventilation was significantly higher than the accuracy of WBC, NEU and LYM counts. AECOPD patients with an NLR≥8.130 had higher 28-day mortality rate, while those with an NLR ≥10.345 were more likely to need invasive mechanical ventilation."
https://openalex.org/W2893286377,"Protein lysine acetylation is a post-translational modification that alters the charge, conformation, and stability of proteins. A number of genome-wide characterizations of lysine-acetylated proteins, or acetylomes, in bacteria have demonstrated that lysine acetylation occurs on proteins with a wide diversity of functions, including central metabolism, transcription, chemotaxis, and cell size regulation. Bacillus subtilis is a model organism for studies of sporulation, motility, cell signaling, and multicellular development (or biofilm formation). In this work, we investigated the role of global protein lysine acetylation in multicellular development in B. subtilis. We analyzed the B. subtilis acetylome under biofilm-inducing conditions and identified acetylated proteins involved in multicellularity, specifically, swarming and biofilm formation. We constructed various single and double mutants of genes known to encode enzymes involved in global protein lysine acetylation in B. subtilis. Some of those mutants showed a defect in swarming motility while others demonstrated altered biofilm phenotypes. Lastly, we picked two acetylated proteins known to be important for biofilm formation, YmcA (also known as RicA), a regulatory protein critical for biofilm induction, and GtaB, an UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase that synthesizes a nucleotide sugar precursor for biosynthesis of exopolysaccharide, a key biofilm matrix component. We performed site-directed mutagenesis on the acetylated lysine codons in ymcA and gtaB, respectively, and assayed cells bearing those point mutants for biofilm formation. The mutant alleles of ymcA(K64R), gtaB(K89R), and gtaB(K191R) all demonstrated a severe biofilm defect. These results indicate the importance of acetylated lysine residues in both YmcA and GtaB. In summary, we propose that protein lysine acetylation plays a global regulatory role in B. subtilis multicellularity."
https://openalex.org/W2893466074,"In view of the vast number of natural products with potential antiplasmodial bioactivity and cost of conducting antiplasmodial bioactivity assays, it may be judicious to learn from previous antiplasmodial bioassays and predict bioactivity of these natural products before experimental bioassays. This study set out to harness antimalarial bioactivity data of natural products to build accurate predictive models, utilizing classical machine learning approaches, which can find potential antimalarial hits from new sets of natural products. Classical machine learning approaches were used to build four classifier models (Naïve Bayesian, Voted Perceptron, Random Forest and Sequence Minimization Optimization of Support Vector Machines) from bioactivity data of natural products with in-vitro antiplasmodial activity (NAA) using a combination of the molecular descriptors and two-dimensional molecular fingerprints of the compounds. Models were evaluated with an independent test dataset. Possible chemical features associated with reported antimalarial activities of the compounds were also extracted. From the results, Random Forest (accuracy 82.81%, Kappa statistics 0.65 and Area under Receiver Operating Characteristics curve 0.91) and Sequential Minimization Optimization (accuracy 85.93%, Kappa statistics 0.72 and Area under Receiver Operating Characteristics curve 0.86) showed good predictive performance for the NAA dataset. The amine chemical group (specifically alkyl amines and basic nitrogen) was confirmed to be essential for antimalarial activity in active NAA dataset. This study built and evaluated classifier models that were used to predict the antiplasmodial bioactivity class (active or inactive) of a set of natural products from interBioScreen chemical library."
https://openalex.org/W2892978723,"Excess energy intake causes obesity, which leads to insulin resistance and various other complications of metabolic syndrome, including diabetes, atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Although recent studies have depicted altered lipid metabolism as an underlying feature, the detailed mechanisms are still unclear. Here we describe a possible role in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity for monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL), an enzyme that is also known to hydrolyze the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol in brain. MGL-deficient [MGL-knockout (KO)] mice fed a HFD gained less body weight than wild-type mice and were protected from insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Food intake and energy expenditure were not altered in MGL-KO mice, but blood triglyceride levels after oral olive oil gavage were suppressed, indicating a role for MGL in intestinal fat absorption. Experiments with cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1)/MGL double-KO mice revealed that these phenotypes may include mechanisms that are independent of CB1-receptor-mediated endocannabinoid functions. We also noted that MGL-KO mice had less preference for HFD over normal chow diet. Oral but not intraperitoneal lipid administration strongly suppressed the appetites of MGL-KO and CB1/MGL double-KO mice, but not of wild-type and CB1-KO mice. Appetite suppression was reversed by vagotomy, suggesting involvement of MGL in the gut-brain axis regulation of appetite. Our results provide mechanistic insights of MGL's role in diet-induced obesity, lipid metabolic disorder, and regulation of appetite.-Yoshida, K., Kita, Y., Tokuoka, S.

https://openalex.org/W2892850869,"Estimates indicate that 20-70% of renal transplant recipients are medication non-adherent, significantly increasing the risk of organ rejection. Medication adherence is negatively impacted by lower everyday problem solving ability, and associations between depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, and adherence are reported in renal transplant recipients. Nonetheless, to date, these associations have not been examined concurrently. Given the relationship between non-adherence and organ rejection, it is critical to gain a better understanding of the predictors of adherence in renal transplant recipients. To this end, we modeled relationships among cognitive abilities, depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, and adherence in this group.Participants (N = 211) underwent renal transplant at least one year prior to participation. Adherence was measured via self-report, medication possession ratio, and immunosuppressant blood-level. Traditionally-measured neurocognitive and everyday problem-solving abilities were assessed. Depressive symptoms were measured via self-report, as were general and medication adherence related self-efficacy. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the fit of the model to available data.Everyday problem solving and self-efficacy had direct positive associations with adherence. Depressive symptoms were negatively associated with self-efficacy, but not adherence. Traditionally-measured neurocognitive abilities were positively associated with self-efficacy, and negatively associated with depressive symptoms.We present a comprehensive investigation of relationships between cognitive and psychosocial factors and adherence in medically stable renal transplant recipients. Findings confirm the importance of everyday problem solving and self-efficacy in predicting adherence and suggest that influences of depressive symptoms and neurocognitive abilities are indirect. Findings have important implications for future development of interventions to improve medication adherence in renal transplant recipients."

These next generation vaccines could replace the current standard of care with vaccines that elicit broadly cross-protective immune responses. However, a variety of in vitro and in vivo models are necessary to make the best assessments of these vaccine formulations to determine their mechanisms of action, and allow for downselection of candidates prior to human clinical trials. Our group has developed the computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) technology to develop HA head-based strategies to elicit antibodies against H1, H3, and H5 influenza strains. These vaccines elicit broadly reactive antibody responses that neutralize not only historical and contemporary vaccine strains, but also co-circulating variants in mice. In this study, we used H1 and H3 HA antigens in a split, inactivated vaccine (IIV) formulation in combination with the AF03 squalene-in-water emulsion adjuvant in ferrets immunologically naïve to influenza virus. The H3 COBRA IIV vaccine T11 elicited antibodies with HAI activity against more H3N2 influenza strains compared to IIV expressing wild-type H3 HA antigens, except for IIV vaccines expressing the HA from A/Texas/50/2012 (Tx/12) virus. H1 COBRA IIV vaccines, P1 and X6, elicited antibodies that recognized a similar number of H1N1 viruses as those antibodies elicited by IIV expressing the A/California/07/2009 (CA/09) HA. Ferrets vaccinated with the P1 or X6 COBRA IIV were protected against CA/09 challege and cleared virus from the lungs of the ferrets, similar to ferrets vaccinated with the CA/09 IIV."
https://openalex.org/W2892552694,"Background Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a race-specific malignancy. The nasal cavity is the main entry point for air pollutants or poisonous gases into the human body. However, the risk of NPC in populations exposed to air pollution remains unknown. Methods We combined data from the Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Database (TAQMD) and the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID) to assess the risk of NPC in a population exposed to air pollution. Results Multivariate analysis revealed positive trends for the association between the risk of NPC and exposure to air pollution. After adjusting for potential covariates, the risk of developing NPC increased with the increase in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure concentrations from 1.39 to 2.28 and 2.01 to 1.97, respectively, compared to the risks at the lowest concentration levels. Conclusions We identified a significant risk of NPC in a population exposed to air pollution. However, this study had several limitations. Moreover, additional experimental and clinical studies on the associations between environmental factors and NPC risk are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2892481122,"Blue whales are sighted every year around the Azores islands, which apparently provide an important seasonal foraging area. In this paper we aim to characterize habitat preferences and analyze the temporal distribution of blue whales around São Miguel Island. To do so, we applied Generalized Additive Models to an opportunistic cetacean occurrence dataset and remotely sensed environmental data on bathymetry, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration and altimetry. We provide a brief description of the oceanography of the area, emphasizing its high spatio-temporal variability. In order to capture this dynamism, we used environmental data with two different spatial resolutions (low and high) and three different temporal resolutions (daily, weekly and monthly), thus accounting for both long-term oceanographic events such as the spring bloom, and shorter-term features such as eddies or fronts. Our results show that blue whales have a well-defined ecological niche around the Azores. They usually cross the archipelago from March to June and habitat suitability is highest in dynamic areas (with high Eddy Kinetic Energy) characterized by convergence or aggregation zones where productivity is enhanced. Multi-scale studies are useful to understand the ecological niche and habitat requirements of highly mobile species that can easily react to short-term changes in the environment."

The aims of this study were to compare parents' and adolescents' traffic- and crime-related safety perceptions of their neighborhood and to analyze the associations of these perceptions with adolescents' IM. A total of 291 adolescents and their parents completed the Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale (NEWS) questionnaire. Multilevel (two-level models: individual level-neighborhood level) regression analyses were conducted to examine whether the environmental perceptions differed between parents and adolescents and the association between the parental and adolescents' perception to the IM and the active independent mobility (AIM). Parents reported a more negative perception of traffic (except for amount and speed) and crime-related safety. Adolescents' environmental perceptions were not associated with their IM but parental perceptions of traffic- and crime-related safety were associated with IM and with active IM, although not all associations were in the expected direction. Future urban policy efforts should address environments where parents perceive sufficient levels of safety to increase the levels of IM in adolescents."

However, little is known about the views of citizens from emerging countries regarding animal production. The aims of this study were to explore the views of Brazilian and Chilean consumers towards egg farming, and to investigate if these views are associated with participants’ eggs purchasing habits and reported willingness to pay (WTP) more for eggs produced in the conditions they perceive as important. In an open question, participants (n = 716) were asked to describe an ideal egg production farm and explain their reasons. This was followed by closed questions asking egg purchasing habits, willingness to pay for eggs produced in the conditions they perceive as important and demographic information. Participants main concerns were with animal welfare, naturalness, hygiene, production, and ethical aspects, which many associated with improved health, sensory, and nutritional quality of the eggs. The views of participants towards an ideal egg production farm were associated, to some extent, with type of egg purchasing habits and WTP a premium for organic or free-range eggs. Our results suggest a demand for more natural, animal friendly egg production systems; furthermore, they indicate a disconnect between lay citizens’ expectations and industry practices, given that intensive confined systems typically fail to supply many of the expected characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2894038083,"In this work, we examined the longitudinal measurement invariance of a battery composed of distinct cognitive parameters. A sample of 86 individuals (53.5% females; mean age = 65.73), representative of the Portuguese older population, with respect to sex, age and level of education was assessed twice over an average of two years. By means of a confirmatory factor analysis approach, we tested whether a two-factor solution [corresponding to measures of memory performance (MEM) and executive functioning (EXEC)] was reliable over time. Nested models of longitudinal invariance demonstrated the existence of partial strong invariance over time. In other words, this indicates that there is an equivalence of the factorial structure and factor loadings for all items; this was also observed for the item intercepts for all the items, except for one of the items from the EXEC dimension. Stability coefficients revealed high associations between the dimensions over time and that, whereas there was a significant decline of the MEM across time, this was not observed for the EXEC dimension. These findings reveal that changes in MEM and EXEC scores can be attributed to true changes on these constructs, enabling the use of this battery as a reliable method to study cognitive aging."
https://openalex.org/W2894354453,"Protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), a serine/threonine phosphatase, has a wide range of biological functions and exhibits elevated expression in tumor cells. We previously reported that pp5-deficient mice have altered ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-mediated signaling and function. However, this regulation was likely indirect, as ATM is not a known PP5 substrate. In the current study, we found that pp5-deficient mice are hypersensitive to genotoxic stress. This hypersensitivity was associated with the marked up-regulation of the tumor suppressor tumor protein p53 and its downstream targets cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21), MDM2 proto-oncogene (MDM2), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in pp5-deficient tissues and cells. These observations suggested that PP5 plays a role in regulating p53 stability and function. Experiments conducted with p53+/−pp5+/− or p53+/−pp5−/− mice revealed that complete loss of PP5 reduces tumorigenesis in the p53+/− mice. Biochemical analyses further revealed that PP5 directly interacts with and dephosphorylates p53 at multiple serine/threonine residues, resulting in inhibition of p53-mediated transcriptional activity. Interestingly, PP5 expression was significantly up-regulated in p53-deficient cells, and further analysis of pp5 promoter activity revealed that p53 strongly represses PP5 transcription. Our results suggest a reciprocal regulatory interplay between PP5 and p53, providing an important feedback mechanism for the cellular response to genotoxic stress."

High-resolution structures of Thermus thermophilus CarHTt have provided snapshots of the dark and light states and have revealed a unique DNA-binding mode whereby only three of four DNA-binding domains contact an operator comprising three tandem direct repeats. To gain further insights into CarH photoreceptors and employing biochemical, spectroscopic, mutational, and computational analyses, here we investigated CarHBm from Bacillus megaterium. We found that apoCarHBm, unlike monomeric apoCarHTt, is an oligomeric molten globule that forms DNA-binding tetramers in the dark only upon AdoCbl binding, which requires a conserved W-X9-EH motif. Light relieved DNA binding by disrupting CarHBm tetramers to dimers, rather than to monomers as with CarHTt. CarHBm operators resembled that of CarHTt, but were larger by one repeat and overlapped with the −35 or −10 promoter elements. This design persisted in a six-repeat, multipartite operator we discovered upstream of a gene encoding an Spx global redox-response regulator whose photoregulated expression links photooxidative and general redox responses in B. megaterium. Interestingly, CarHBm recognized the smaller CarHTt operator, revealing an adaptability possibly related to the linker bridging the DNA- and AdoCbl-binding domains.

In this experiment freely flying workers of two Brazilian species of stingless bees–Partamona helleri and Melipona bicolor–were tested for colour preferences concerning the colour parameters dominant wavelength, spectral purity and intensity (≙ brightness). Each individual bee had to perform 57 tests, in which a definite series of dual choices between colour stimuli varying in intensity, spectral purity or dominant wavelength were presented. The results show that P. helleri chose colours of higher spectral purity and preferred bluish colours, while M. bicolor made generalized colour choices. Intensity did not influence the colour choice of any bee species. The results of P. helleri are consistent with findings for honeybees and bumblebees, while colour preferences in M. bicolor seem to be absent."

A priority of DREAMS is to characterise the male partners for effective targeting.Using population-based data (2010-2015) in three DREAMS impact evaluation settings in Kenya and South Africa, we describe the demographic characteristics and sexual behaviour of male partners reported by AGYW, and the characteristics of males who report sexual activity with AGYW.In all settings, over 90% of recent male partners reported by AGYW were aged <35 years. Median ages of spousal and non-spousal partners were 29 and 23 years respectively in uMkhanyakude (rural South Africa) and 21 and 20 years respectively in Nairobi (urban Kenya). Most males reporting an AGYW partner had never been married (89%) and many were in school (39%). Most male partners reported only 1 AGYW partner in the past year; in Gem (rural Kenya) and Nairobi 25%-29% reported 2+(AGYW or older female) partners. Concurrent partners were reported by 16% of male partners in Gem and 3-4% in uMkhanyakude. Two thirds of male partners in Gem reported testing for HIV in the past 6 months and under half in uMkhanyakude reported testing for HIV in the past year. Almost all (96%) partners in Nairobi were circumcised, compared to 45% in Gem and 43% in uMkhanyakude.With almost all AGYW's sexual partners aged 15-34 years, this is an appropriate target group for DREAMS interventions. Encouraging young men to reduce their number of partners and concurrency, and uptake prevention and treatment services such as HIV testing, circumcision and ART is crucial in the effort to reduce HIV among both AGYW and young men."

Previously, we have shown that systemic inflammatory stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced the daytime-dependent phosphorylation of STAT3 in the SCN. Here, we demonstrate the LPS-induced Stat3 mRNA expression in the SCN and show also the circadian rhythm in Stat3 expression in the SCN, with high levels during the day. Moreover, we examined the effects of LPS (1mg/kg), applied either during the day or the night, on the rhythm in locomotor activity of male Wistar rats. We observed that recovery of normal locomotor activity patterns took longer when the animals were injected during the night. The clock genes Per1, Per2 and Nr1d1, and phosphorylation of kinases ERK1/2 and GSK3β are sensitive to external cues and function as the molecular entry for external signals into the circadian clockwork. We also studied the immediate changes in these clock genes expressions and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and GSK3β in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in response to daytime or night-time inflammatory stimulation. We revealed mild and transient changes with respect to the controls. Our data stress the role of STAT3 in the circadian clock response to the LPS and provide further evidence of the interaction between the circadian clock and immune system."

In the ""discover"" phase, we conducted desk research and field research of stakeholders to identify the unmet needs in existing patient care services. We used service design tools, including service safaris, user shadowing, and customer journey maps to identify pain and opportunity points in the current services. We also performed focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with stakeholders to explore the needs for improved services. In the ""define"" phase, we generated the service concept by mind mapping and brainstorming about the needs of stakeholders. The service concept was defined to be a Patient-oriented, Collaborative, Advanced, Renovated, and Excellent (P-CARE) service. We named the service ""DrugTEAM"" (Drug Therapy Evaluation And Management). In the ""design"" phase, we designed and refined four prototypes based on results from validation tests for their application towards following services: 1) medication reconciliation, 2) medication evaluation and management, 3) evidence-based drug information, and 4) pharmaceutical care transition services. During the ""develop"" phase, we implemented four services in a longitudinal chronic care model, considering the time spent by patients for each inpatient and outpatient setting. In conclusion, this is a study to develop a collaborative MTC service model using service design framework, focused on managing the unmet needs of patients and healthcare providers. As a result of implementing this service model, we expect to strengthen the professional relationship between pharmacists and stakeholders to ultimately create better patient outcomes."

In those weight-bearing activities, postural stability (PS) plays an important role. Correlations among foot type, PS, and other musculoskeletal problems that increase sport injury risk are known. However, long-term associations among the foot type, the PS, and body weight (BW) distribution are lacking. Thus, the purpose of this study was to longitudinally identify changes in foot morphology, PS, and symmetry in BW distribution during adolescence among elite male soccer players. Methods Thirty-five Czech elite male soccer players (age, 15.49 ± 0.61 years; BW, 64.11 ± 6.16 kg; body height, 174.62 ± 5.71 cm) underwent foot type, PS, and BW distribution measurements during 3 consecutive years (T1, T2, T3). The Chippaux-Smirak index (CSI), BW distribution, and centre of pressure (COP) displacement (total traveled way [TTW]) of each player for the preferred (PL) and non-preferred leg (NL) were acquired. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM ANOVA), Bonferroni´s post hoc tests, and partial eta-squared (ηp2) coefficient were used for investigating the effect of time on selected variables and effect size evaluation. Results Statistically significant effect of time on CSI values (PL: F2,68 = 5.08, p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.13 and NL: F2,68 = 10.87, p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.24) and COP displacement values (PL: F2,68 = 5.07, p <0.01, ηp2 = 0.13; NL: F2,68 = 3.53, p <0.05, ηp2 = 0.09) for both legs over 3-years period was identified. Furthermore, the Bonferroni´s post hoc analysis revealed a significant improvement of PS values in the PL (TTWT1 = 1617.11 ± 520.22 mm vs. TTWT2 = 1405.29 ± 462.76, p < 0.05; and between TTWT1 = 1617.11 ± 520.22 mm vs. TTWT3 = 1370.46 ± 373.94, p < 0.05). Only BW distribution parameter showed no significant differences, although slightly improved over time. Conclusions We observed changes in foot typology, PS, and BW distribution in young elite male soccer players during 3 consecutive years. Results demonstrated that changes in PS and body weight distribution under the high-load sport conditions during adolescence may improve with aging, except for foot morphology. Therefore, foot morphology should be carefully monitored to minimize sport injury risk in professional young soccer players during adolescence. Further research is necessary to determine more clear associations between these parameters, soccer-related injuries, and sport performances."

This paper proposes a new coordinated optimization approach for freeway network, aiming to relieve the traffic congestion in freeway network equipped with the coordinated traffic controllers. The challenge is how to solve the problem between the traffic control goals of each path and those of the network. In this paper, the bi-level programming theory is used to address this problem. More exactly, in the path level, the optimal control model is designed to relieve congestion in each path of the test network. Furthermore, in the network level, the optimal model considers the traffic equilibrium and cost optimization. The efficiency of the proposed approach is tested on a well-known traffic network calibrated by the field test data of freeway network. The results show that the proposed approach has positive effects in balancing traffic load and improving the service level of freeway networks."

Molecular analysis was done to determine influenza type and subtype at the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) in Kinshasa using real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Analysis of antiviral resistance by enzyme inhibition assay and nucleotide sequencing was performed by the Collaborating center in the USA (CDC, Atlanta).Out of 2,376 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from patients, 218 (9.1%) were positive for influenza virus. Among the positive samples, 149 were characterized as influenza virus type A (Flu A), 67 as type B (Flu B) and 2 mixed infections (Flu A and B). Flu A subtypes detected were H3N2 and H1N1. The Yamagata strain of Flu B was detected among patients in the country. Individuals aged between 5 and 14 years accounted for the largest age group affected by influenza virus. All influenza viruses detected were found to be sensitive to antiviral drugs such as oseltamivar, zanamivir, peramivir and laninamivar.The present study documented the possible involvement of both circulation of Flu A and B viruses in human respiratory infection in certain DRC provinces during 2015. This study emphasises the need to extend the influenza surveillance to other provinces for a better understanding of the epidemiology of influenza in DRC. It is envisioned that such a system would lead to improved disease control and patient management."
https://openalex.org/W2894232066,"To describe the clinical, virological and immune characteristics of internationally adopted children on arrival in France and after 6-months follow-up.Multicenter retrospective study.30 centers from 24 cities were asked to include, after informed consent, HIV+ children living in France and internationally adopted between 1st Jan 2005 and 1st Jan 2015. Sociodemographic, medical and biological variables collected during the first medical evaluation in France and 6 months later were analyzed.41 HIV+ adoptees were included (female: 56%; median age: 3.91 years) in 14 centers. Adoptees tend to represent an increasing part of newly diagnosed HIV positive children over the years. The majority came from East-Asia. At arrival, one child was diagnosed with lymphobronchial tuberculosis and three with latent chronic hepatitis B, cleared HBV infection and chronic active hepatitis C, respectively. The mean CD4% was 32.8 ± 9% (range: 13-49%). The 34 children (83%) have been initiated on treatment from their countries of origin. Of these, 25 (74%) had an undetectable viral load (VL) on arrival. Resistance to ART was detected in five. At 6 months, 36 adoptees received ART, and the VL was undetectable in 29 children (71%), with one acquired resistance to NRTI & NNRTI.An increasing number of HIV-infected children have been internationally adopted in France since 2005. Most of the children have been initiated on treatment from their countries of origin, had good immunity, with few opportunistic infections, and infrequently detectable VL. Low level of mutation conferring resistance was detected."
https://openalex.org/W2893246785,"Background Increasing rates of postpartum haemorrhage and obstetric transfusion mean that more women are entering subsequent pregnancies with a history of blood transfusion. This study investigates subsequent pregnancy outcomes of women with a prior obstetric red cell transfusion, compared to women without a transfusion. Methods All women with a first pregnancy resulting in a liveborn singleton infant of at least 20 weeks gestation delivering in hospitals in New South Wales, Australia, between 2003 and 2012 were included in the study, with followup for second births until June 2015. Linked hospital and births data were used to identify women with a transfusion and/or postpartum haemorrhage in their first birth, time to second pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes (including transfusion, postpartum haemorrhage and severe morbidity) in their subsequent birth. Results There were 358,384 singleton births to primiparous women, with 1.4% receiving an obstetric blood transfusion. Sixty-three percent of women had at least one subsequent birth. The relative risk (RR) of requiring a transfusion in a second birth was 4.9 (95% CI 4.1,6.1) for women with a previous transfusion compared with women without. The risk (RR) of severe morbidity in a second birth was 4.1 times higher (95% CI 2.2,7.4) for those receiving a transfusion without haemorrhage in their first birth compared with women with neither haemorrhage nor transfusion. Conclusion It is important to consider a woman’s history of transfusion and/or haemorrhage as part of her obstetric history to ensure management in a manner that minimises risk in subsequent pregnancies."
https://openalex.org/W2893536426,"Can structural information of proteins generate essential features for predicting the deleterious effect of a single nucleotide variant (SNV) independent of the known existence of the SNV in diseases? In this work, we answer the question by examining the performance of features generated from prior knowledge with the goal towards determining the pathogenic effect of rare variants in rare disease. We take the approach of prioritizing SNV loci focusing on protein structure-based features. The proposed structure-based features are generated from geometric, physical, chemical, and functional properties of the variant loci and structural neighbors of the loci utilizing multiple homologous structures. The performance of the structure-based features alone, trained on 80% of HumVar-HumDiv combination (HumVD-train) and tested on 20% of HumVar-HumDiv (HumVD-test), ClinVar and ClinVar rare variant rare disease (ClinVarRVRD) datasets, showed high levels of discernibility in determining the SNV’s pathogenic or benign effects on patients. Combined structure- and sequence-based features generated from prior knowledge on a random forest model further improved the F scores to 0.84 (HumVD-test), 0.75 (ClinVar), and 0.75 (ClinVarRVRD). Including features based on the difference between wild-type in addition to the features based on loci information increased the F score slightly more to 0.90 (HumVD-test), 0.78 (ClinVar), and 0.76 (ClinVarRVRD). The empirical examination and high F scores of the results based on loci information alone suggest that location of SNV plays a primary role in determining functional impact of mutation and that structure-based features can help enhance the prediction performance."
https://openalex.org/W2894056287,"The regulation of temporo-spatial compartmentalization of protein synthesis is of crucial importance for a variety of physiologic cellular functions. Here, we demonstrate that the cell membrane-anchored disintegrin metalloproteinase ADAM15, upregulated in a variety of aggressively growing tumor cells, in the hyperproliferative synovial membrane of inflamed joints as well as in osteoarthritic chondrocytes, transiently binds to poly(A) binding protein 1 (PABP) in cells undergoing adhesion. The cytoplasmic domain of ADAM15 was shown to selectively interact with the proline-rich linker of PABP. Immunostainings of adhesion-triggered cells demonstrate an ADAM15-dependent recruitment of PABP to cell membrane foci coinciding with ongoing mRNA translation as visualized by the detection of puromycin-terminated polypeptides. Moreover, the increase in cell membrane-associated neosynthesis of puromycylated proteins upon induction of cell adhesion was proven linked to ADAM15 expression in HeLa and ADAM15-transfected chondrocytic cells. Thus, down regulation of ADAM15 by siRNA and/or the use of a cell line transfected with a mutant ADAM15-construct lacking the cytoplasmic tail resulted in a considerable reduction in the amount of cell membrane-associated puromycylated proteins formed during induced cell adhesion. These results provide first direct evidence for a regulatory role of ADAM15 on mRNA translation at the cell membrane that transiently emerges in response to triggering cell adhesion and might have potential implications under pathologic conditions of matrix remodeling associated with ADAM15 upregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2894255505,"Introduction Elements such as zinc, iron, copper, sulphur and phosphorus have been identified in retinal layers and implicated in vital retinal functions. Regarding mineral composition of epiretinal membranes (ERMs), literature is lacking. This study aimed to analyze both mineral composition and anatomical ultrastructure of ERMs to clarify the pathophysiology of this disease. Methods Twenty ERMs (10 diabetic ERMs and 10 idiopathic ERMs) from 20 patients were harvested during pars plana vitrectomy. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the anatomical ultrastructure of the peeled ERMs. Mineral composition was analyzed using energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS). The most frequent elements were evaluated in relation to appearance of ERMs analyzed at SEM and at OCT images. Results Sulphur was the most frequent element found (in 80% of the samples), followed by sodium (50%) and phosphorus (45%). The presence of these elements was not significantly different between diabetic and idiopathic ERMs (P >0.05). Using SEM we found a folded tissue in all ERMs, except in 4 ERMs, where we observed only a smooth tissue. There was a trend of sodium to be more frequent in ERMs with folded layers at SEM examination. Conclusions Several elements were identified in ERMs, and sulphur, sodium and phosphorus were the most frequent ones. This finding may help to understand their role in the physiopatology of epiretinal proliferation and in glial activation."
https://openalex.org/W2894411160,"Background We examined the equivalence of the individual and the country-level factor structure of the Belief in a Zero-Sum Game (BZSG) scale, a tool designed to measure antagonistic beliefs about social relations (i.e., perceived social antagonism) in the struggle for limited resources. Aims In this article we focused on a test of construct isomorphism in a multilevel modeling approach. It was hypothesized that the BZSG measure satisfies all requirements for a strong level of configural isomorphism, and thus that it is useful to investigate BZSG at both the individual and the country levels. The relationships between the BZSG at a country level with other macro-socio-economic indicators were also investigated. Method Multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA) was carried out on a cross-country sample composed of 11,368 participants from 43 different countries. We also used the country-level latent BZSG factor in each country as an indicator of a property that we attributed to a particular culture: cultural dimension (collectivism-individualism), macroeconomic indicators (GDP per capita and GNI per capita) and macrosocial indicators (Human Development Index and Democracy Index) describing societies. Results The results revealed an isomorphic factor structure of perceived social antagonism (measured by BZSG scale), defined in terms of the equivalence factor structure at the both individual and country levels. Furthermore, the relationship between the perceived social antagonism, gross national income per capita, and collectivism were confirmed. Conclusions Our study supports the usefulness of the BZSG scale for cross-cultural comparison, in the case of its isomorphic structure. At the country level, antagonistic beliefs emerge in hierarchical collectivist societies with lower income. The main contribution of this article is the presentation of the test of construct isomorphism. We made an effort to present a full perspective on construct isomorphism putting together two different but very recent approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2893525189,"Understanding sensitive behaviors—those that are socially unacceptable or non-compliant with rules or regulations—is essential for creating effective interventions. Sensitive behaviors are challenging to study, because participants are unlikely to disclose sensitive behaviors for fear of retribution or due to social undesirability. Methods for studying sensitive behavior include randomized response techniques, which provide anonymity to interviewees who answer sensitive questions. A variation on this approach, the quantitative randomized response technique (QRRT), allows researchers to estimate the frequency or quantity of sensitive behaviors. However, to date no studies have used QRRT to identify potential drivers of non-compliant behavior because regression methodology has not been developed for the nonnegative count data produced by QRRT. We develop a Poisson regression methodology for QRRT data, based on maximum likelihood estimation computed via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The methodology can be implemented with relatively minor modification of existing software for generalized linear models. We derive the Fisher information matrix in this setting and use it to obtain the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix of the regression parameter estimates. Simulation results demonstrate the quality of the asymptotic approximations. The method is illustrated with a case study examining potential drivers of non-compliance with hunting regulations in Sierra Leone. The new methodology allows assessment of the importance of potential drivers of different quantities of non-compliant behavior, using a likelihood-based, information-theoretic approach. Free, open-source software is provided to support QRRT regression."
