https://openalex.org/W2000902397,"Fractal-like networks effectively endow life with an additional fourth spatial dimension. This is the origin of quarter-power scaling that is so pervasive in biology. Organisms have evolved hierarchical branching networks that terminate in size-invariant units, such as capillaries, leaves, mitochondria, and oxidase molecules. Natural selection has tended to maximize both metabolic capacity, by maximizing the scaling of exchange surface areas, and internal efficiency, by minimizing the scaling of transport distances and times. These design principles are independent of detailed dynamics and explicit models and should apply to virtually all organisms."

https://openalex.org/W1975522586,"Endoglin is a transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) binding protein expressed on the surface of endothelial cells. Loss-of-function mutations in the human endoglin gene ENG cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1), a disease characterized by vascular malformations. Here it is shown that by gestational day 11.5, mice lacking endoglin die from defective vascular development. However, in contrast to mice lacking TGF-beta, vasculogenesis was unaffected. Loss of endoglin caused poor vascular smooth muscle development and arrested endothelial remodeling. These results demonstrate that endoglin is essential for angiogenesis and suggest a pathogenic mechanism for HHT1."

https://openalex.org/W2036431121,"Oxygen-isotope ratios of precipitation (δ 18 O P ) inferred from deep-lake ostracods from the Ammersee (southern Germany) provide a climate record with decadal resolution. The record in detail shows many of the rapid climate shifts seen in central Greenland ice cores between 15,000 and 5000 years before the present (B.P.). Negative excursions in the estimated δ 18 O P from both of these records likely reflect short weakenings of the thermohaline circulation caused by episodic discharges of continental freshwater into the North Atlantic. Deviating millennial-scale trends, however, indicate that climate gradients between Europe and Greenland changed systematically, reflecting a gradual rearrangement of North Atlantic circulation during deglaciation."

https://openalex.org/W2072459093,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP 3 ) is a second messenger that elicits complex spatiotemporal patterns of calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) mobilization and has essential roles in the regulation of many cellular functions. In Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells, green fluorescent protein–tagged pleckstrin homology domain translocated from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm in response to increased concentration of IP 3 . The detection of translocation enabled monitoring of IP 3 concentration changes within single cells and revealed spatiotemporal dynamics in the concentration of IP 3 synchronous with Ca 2+ oscillations and intracellular and intercellular IP 3 waves that accompanied Ca 2+ waves. Such changes in IP 3 concentration may be fundamental to Ca 2+ signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2165606044,"Analytic results and experiments in ultrahigh vacuum indicate that the static friction between two clean crystalline surfaces should almost always vanish, yet macroscopic objects always exhibit static friction. A simple and general explanation for the prevalence of static friction is proposed. “Third bodies,” such as small hydrocarbon molecules, adsorb on any surface exposed to air and can arrange to lock two contacting surfaces together. The resulting static friction is consistent with experimental behavior, including Amontons' laws."
https://openalex.org/W1964606590,"Plants constantly monitor their light environment in order to grow and develop optimally, in part through use of the phytochromes, which sense red/far-red light. A phytochrome binding protein, PKS1 (phytochrome kinase substrate 1), was identified that is a substrate for light-regulated phytochrome kinase activity in vitro. In vivo experiments suggest that PKS1 is phosphorylated in a phytochrome-dependent manner and negatively regulates phytochrome signaling. The data suggest that phytochromes signal by serine-threonine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2148439661,"Like humans engaged in risky activities, group members of some animal societies take turns acting as sentinels. Explanations of the evolution of sentinel behavior have frequently relied on kin selection or reciprocal altruism, but recent models suggest that guarding may be an individual's optimal activity once its stomach is full if no other animal is on guard. This paper provides support for this last explanation by showing that, in groups of meerkats (Suricata suricatta), animals guard from safe sites, and solitary individuals as well as group members spend part of their time on guard. Though individuals seldom take successive guarding bouts, there is no regular rota, and the provision of food increases contributions to guarding and reduces the latency between bouts by the same individual."
https://openalex.org/W2015509108,"Vaccines based on preferential expression of bacterial antigens during human infection have not been described. Staphylococcus aureus synthesized poly- N -succinyl β-1-6 glucosamine (PNSG) as a surface polysaccharide during human and animal infection, but few strains expressed PNSG in vitro. All S. aureus strains examined carried genes for PNSG synthesis. Immunization protected mice against kidney infections and death from strains that produced little PNSG in vitro. Nonimmune infected animals made antibody to PNSG, but serial in vitro cultures of kidney isolates yielded mostly cells that did not produce PNSG. PNSG is a candidate for use in a vaccine to protect against S. aureus infection."

It was found that management of fisheries through reserves and management through effort control produce identical yields under a reasonable set of simplifying assumptions corresponding to a broad range of biological conditions. Indeed, for populations with sedentary adults (invertebrates and reef fishes), reserves have important advantages for sustainability, making marine reserves the preferred management approach."

https://openalex.org/W1967520902,"The mammalian GTP-binding protein GSPT, whose carboxyl-terminal sequence is homologous to the eukaryotic elongation factor EF1α, binds to the polypeptide chain releasing factor eRF1 to function as eRF3 in the translation termination. The amino-terminal domain of GSPT was, however, not required for the binding. Search for other GSPT-binding proteins in yeast two-hybrid screening system resulted in the identification of a cDNA encoding polyadenylate-binding protein (PABP), whose amino terminus is associating with the poly(A) tail of mRNAs presumably for their stabilization. The interaction appeared to be mediated through the carboxyl-terminal domain of PABP and the amino-terminal region of GSPT. Interestingly, multimerization of PABP with poly(A), which is ascribed to the action of its carboxyl-terminal domain, was completely inhibited by the interaction with the amino-terminal domain of GSPT. These results indicate that GSPT/eRF3 may play important roles not only in the termination of protein synthesis but also in the regulation of mRNA stability. Thus, the present study is the first report showing that GSPT/eRF3 carries the translation termination signal to 3′-poly(A) tail ubiquitously present in eukaryotic mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2046104345,"The molecular mode of action of lonidamine, a therapeutic agent employed in cancer chemotherapy, has been elusive. Here we provide evidence that lonidamine (LND) acts on mitochondria to induce apoptosis. LND provokes a disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential which precedes signs of nuclear apoptosis and cytolysis. The mitochondrial and cytocidal effects of LND are not prevented by inhibitors of caspases or of mRNA or protein synthesis. However, they are prevented by transfection-enforced overexpression of Bcl-2, an oncoprotein which inhibits apoptosis by stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane barrier function. Accordingly, the cell death-inducing effect of LND is amplified by simultaneous addition of PK11195, an isoquinoline ligand of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor which antagonizes the cytoprotective effect of Bcl-2. When added to isolated nuclei, LND fails to provoke DNA degradation unless mitochondria are added simultaneously. In isolated mitochondria, LND causes the dissipation of the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential and the release of apoptogenic factors capable of inducing nuclear apoptosis in vitro. Thus the mitochondrion is the subcellular target of LND. All effects of LND on isolated mitochondria are counteracted by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial PT pore. We therefore tested the effect of LND on the purified PT pore reconstituted into liposomes. LND permeabilizes liposomal membranes containing the PT pore. This effect is prevented by addition of recombinant Bcl-2 protein but not by a mutant Bcl-2 protein that has lost its apoptosis-inhibitory function. Altogether these data indicate that LND represents a novel type of anti-cancer agent which induces apoptosis via a direct effect on the mitochondrial PT pore."

Only aware subjects acquired a differential behavioral response to the tones. Regional cerebral blood flow in left prefrontal cortex showed learning-related changes only in aware subjects. Left prefrontal cortex also showed changes in functional connectivity with contralateral prefrontal cortex, sensory association cortices, and cerebellum. Several of the interacting areas correlated with aware subjects' behavior. These results suggest cerebral processes underlying awareness are mediated through interactions of large-scale neurocognitive systems."

The interferometer provided maps 300 kilometers by 1000 kilometers of both polar regions at 150-meter spatial resolution and 50-meter height resolution. Using ray tracing, these digital elevation models were used to locate regions that are in permanent shadow from solar illumination and may harbor ice deposits.

https://openalex.org/W2314722778,"The CDK inhibitor p21waf is a principal mediator of p53 function but can also be transactivated by many p53-independent stimuli leading to cell growth arrest or differentiation. In order to study the function of p21waf in a p53-deficient environment, we established an inducible expression of p21waf in the p53-null lung cancer cell line H1299, based on the muristerone-regulated system. Overexpression of p21waf led cells to growth arrest which after several days became irreversible and the arrested cells acquired a senescent phenotype as judged by cell shape, the senescence-associated beta-gal marker and inhibition of colony formation. The effect of p21waf overexpression, in the absence of p53, on the cytotoxicity caused by irradiation, doxorubicin and taxol was studied. Expression of p21waf provided protection against the cytotoxic effect of radiation and doxorubicin but not of taxol. These results are relevant to treatment of cancer when p53 is inactive."

https://openalex.org/W2333809012,"Constitutively active Ras proteins, their regulatory components, and overexpressed tyrosine kinase receptors that activate Ras, are frequently associated with cell transformation in human tumors. This suggests that functional Ras antagonists may have anti-tumor activity. Studies in rodent fibroblasts have shown that S-trans, transfarnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS) acts as a rather specific nontoxic Ras antagonist, dislodging Ras from its membrane anchorage domains and accelerating its degradation. FTS is not a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, and does not affect Ras maturation. Here we demonstrate that FTS also acts as a functional Ras antagonist in human pancreatic cell lines that express activated K-Ras (Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2). In Panc-1 cells, FTS at a concentration of 25-100 microM reduced the amount of Ras in a dose-dependent manner and interfered with serum-dependent and epidermal growth factor-stimulated ERK activation, thus inhibiting both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth of Panc-1 cells in vitro. FTS also inhibited tumor growth in Panc-1 xenografted nude mice, apparently without systemic toxicity. Daily FTS treatment (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally) in mice with tumors (mean volume 0.07 cm3) markedly decreased tumor growth (after treatment for 18 days, tumor volume had increased by only 23+/-30-fold in the FTS-treated group and by 127+/-66-fold in controls). These findings suggest that FTS represents a new class of functional Ras antagonists with potential therapeutic value."
https://openalex.org/W2062065423,"A controversial hypothesis has proposed that lizards are subject to a speed-dependent axial constraint that prevents effective lung ventilation during moderate- and high-speed locomotion. This hypothesis has been challenged by results demonstrating that monitor lizards (genus Varanus ) experience no axial constraint. Evidence presented here shows that, during locomotion, varanids use a positive pressure gular pump to assist lung ventilation. Disabling the gular pump reveals that the axial constraint is present in varanids but it is masked by gular pumping under normal conditions. These findings support the prediction that the axial constraint may be found in other tetrapods that breathe by costal aspiration and locomote with a lateral undulatory gait."

Experimentally measured fluid/melt partition coefficients of sulfur ranged from 47 under oxidizing conditions (where SO 2 is the dominant sulfur species in the fluid) to 468 under reducing conditions (where H 2 S dominates). Therefore, a few weight percent of hydrous fluid accumulated in the top of a magma chamber may extract most of the sulfur out of the entire magma reservoir and generate sulfur excesses upon eruption."

Its precursor (pro-EMAPII) has been suggested to be identical to p43, which is associated with the multi-tRNA synthetase complex. Herein, we have demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of pro-EMAPII interacts with the N-terminal extension of human cytoplasmic arginyl-tRNA synthetase (RRS) using genetic and immunoprecipitation analyses. Aminoacylation activity of RRS was enhanced about 2.5-fold by the interaction with pro-EMAPII but not with its N- or C-terminal domains alone. The N-terminal extension of RRS was not required for enzyme activity but did mediate activity stimulation by pro-EMAPII. Pro-EMAPII reduced the apparent K m of RRS to tRNA, whereas the k cat value remained unchanged.

The present work was designed to address whether pro-EMAPII is identical to p43 and to understand its function in the normal cell. The results showed that pro-EMAPII is associated with the N-terminal extension of human arginyl-tRNA synthetase (RRS), facilitating aminoacylation reaction. Human pro-EMAPII is genetically separated into the N- and C-terminal domains by proteolytic cleavage at Asp147. The cDNA encoding the full-length pro-EMAPII was isolated from pM338 2H. Motegi and K. Shiba, unpublished data. by NdeI andXhoI digestion and then used as a template to separately amplify the DNA encoding its N- and C-terminal domains by PCR using the primer pairs of R1EF/S1ENB and R1ECF/S1EB (Table I). The PCR products were digested and cloned into pET28a using EcoRI andSalI. The DNA encoding the 72-amino acid N-terminal extension of human RRS was also amplified by PCR using the primers of R1RNF and S1RNB (Table I) and cloned into the EcoRI andSalI sites of pET28a. The resulting clones were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21-DE3, and the inserted genes were induced at 0.1 mm IPTG. The cells expressing the recombinant proteins were harvested, resuspended in 20 mmKH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl (pH 7.8), and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and then lysed by ultrasonication. After centrifugation of the lysate at 25,000 × g, the supernatants were recovered and the recombinant proteins containing a 6-histidine tag were isolated by nickel affinity chromatography according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen).Table IPrimers used for subcloning of human pro-EMAPII and RRSPrimersSequencesR1EF5′-CCGGAATTCATGGCAAATAATGATGCTR1ECF5′-CCGGAATTCTCTAAGCCAATAGATGTTS1EB5′-CCGGTCGACTTATTTGATTCCACTGTTS1ENB5′-CTGGTCGACGTCGGCACTTCCAGCR1RNF5′-TGGAATTCATGGACGTACTGGTGR1RTN5′-CCGGAATTCATGATTAACATTATTAGCS1RB5′-ACGCGTCGACTTACATCCTTGGGCCS1RNB5′-GACGCGTCGACTTAATTTTTAGTTGG Open table in a new tab The cDNAs encoding the full-length and N-terminal 72-amino acid truncated (ΔN72) human RRS proteins were also amplified by PCR with the primer pairs of R1RNF/S1RB and R1RTN/S1RB, respectively (Table I).

Protein extracts were prepared as described above, and the GST fusion proteins were purified by glutathione affinity chromatography. The GST tag was then removed by thrombin cleavage and the RRS proteins were further purified according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The plasmid pM109 containing the full-length human lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KRS) fused to a 6-histidine tag (13Shiba K. Stello T. Motegi H. Noda T. Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. J. Biol.

The His-KRS fusion protein was purified using nickel affinity chromatography (CLONTECH). The purified recombinant human pro-EMAPII (500 μg) was mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant at 1:1 volume ratio and then injected into two New Zealand White rabbits. Booster injections were conducted three times at 1-week intervals using the same amount of the protein mixed with the incomplete adjuvant at a 1:1 ratio. The rabbits were sacrificed by cardiac puncture, and the antiserum was obtained. The antibody was purified by protein A column chromatography. Specificity and titer were determined by Western blotting. The purified N-terminal extension of human RRS (10 μg) was mixed with each of the full-length, N- or C-terminal domains of pro-EMAPII (10 μg each) at 4 °C overnight. The polyclonal rabbit (20 μg) antibody raised against human pro-EMAPII was then added to each of the mixtures and incubated on ice for 4 h. The protein A-agarose suspension in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 25 mm NaCl was also added, and incubation was continued at 4 °C for 5 h. The mixture was centrifuged, and the agarose pellet was washed three times with 400 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 25 mm NaCl and 0.01% Triton X-100. The agarose was treated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 100 mmdithiothreitol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol, and the solution was then boiled for 5 min to elute the bound proteins. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were separated by electrophoresis and detected by Coomassie Blue staining. Human proteins interacting with human pro-EMAPII were screened by a yeast two-hybrid system (14Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the full-length pro-EMAPII was isolated by PCR using the primers R1EF and S1EB (Table I) and ligated next to the gene for LexA using the EcoRI andSalI sites. The plasmid was transformed into yeast strain, EGY48 (MAT, his3, trp1, ura3–52, leu2::pLeu2-LexAop6/pSH 18–34 (LexAop-lacZ)). A human fetal brain cDNA library in which the proteins are expressed as fusion proteins with the B42 transcriptional activator (CLONTECH) was used to screen for proteins interacting with LexA-pro-EMAPII. The plasmids containing human cDNAs were transformed into EGY48 expressing LexA-pro-EMAPII. Interactions were detected by the induction of reporter genes, LEU2 and LacZ, which resulted in cell growth on leucine-depleted yeast synthetic media containing 2% galactose and also formation of blue colonies on the yeast synthetic media containing 0.2 mm X-gal, 2% galactose, and 2% raffinose. The cDNAs encoding the N- and C-terminal domains of pro-EMAPII were cleaved from the histidine tag construction usingEcoRI and SalI and religated into the pLexA vector using the same sites. Aminoacylation activity of the purified human RRS was determined as described previously (15Vellekamp G. Sihag R.K. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9843-9847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 125 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.4), 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm ATP, 4 mmEDTA, 50 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 μCi/μl [3H]arginine. Aminoacylation of human KRS was carried out in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 4 mm ATP, and 0.12 μCi/μl [3H]lysine. Human RRS and KRS were pre-incubated on ice with the full-length, N- or C-terminal domain of pro-EMAPII for 5 min and then added to their respective reaction mixtures at a concentration of 0.14 nm. The reaction was initiated by adding bovine liver total tRNA (0.34 μm). Reaction samples were taken at 1-min intervals and spotted on filter discs presoaked with 5% trichloroacetic acid. After 1 min, the filter discs were added to ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and washed three times with fresh 5% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C. The radioactivity adsorbed to the filters was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Reactions were also carried out at different concentrations of pro-EMAPII for kinetic analysis. To investigate the function of pro-EMAPII and its relationship to p43, we screened for protein(s) interacting with human pro-EMAPII using a yeast two-hybrid system (16Fields S. Sternglanz R.

The 312-amino acid polypeptide of human pro-EMAPII was fused to LexA (DNA-binding domain), and this fusion protein was used as a bait. Human proteins fused to B42 (transcriptional activator) were screened, and interaction between the two fusion proteins was detected by the induction of the reporter genes, LEU2 and LacZ, in a yeast host strain (14Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Approximately 300,000 cDNA clones of human fetal brain were screened to identify proteins interacting with pro-EMAPII. The N-terminal 58-amino acid region of human RRS was selected as one of the six positive clones interacting with pro-EMAPII (data not shown). In the present work, we focused on the interaction between pro-EMAPII and RRS. The N-terminal 72-amino acid peptide region is only found in human (18Girjes A.A. Hobson K. Philip C. Lavin M.F. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 164: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and hamster RRS proteins (19Lazard M. Mirande M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We conducted deletion analysis to determine the peptide regions of pro-EMAPII and RRS responsible for the interaction. The peptides from Gln15 to Tyr53and from Ser38 to Asn72 were able to interact with pro-EMAPII, suggesting that the residues from Gln15 to Ser38 are responsible for the interaction (Fig.1). The N-terminal domain of pro-EMAPII showed the interaction with RRS but its C-terminal cytokine domain did not (Fig. 1). Interaction between the N-terminal extension of RRS and pro-EMAPII was also tested by co-immunoprecipitation. The full-length, N- and C-terminal domains of pro-EMAPII and the 72-amino acid N-terminal extension of RRS were all expressed as His-tag fusion proteins and were purified by nickel affinity chromatography (Fig.2). The purified N-terminal peptide of RRS was mixed with each of the isolated full-length, N- and C-terminal pro-EMAPII in separate reactions. Polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against pro-EMAPII was then added to the mixture and precipitated with protein A-agarose. The proteins in the precipitate were dissolved and separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The N-terminal peptide of RRS was co-precipitated with the full-length or N-terminal domains of pro-EMAPII but not with its C-terminal domain (Fig. 2). These results further confirmed that the N-terminal domain of pro-EMAPII interacts with the N-terminal extension of RRS as initially identified by the two hybrid analysis (Fig. 1). The functional significance of the interaction between RRS and pro-EMAPII was further investigated. We tested whether the aminoacylation activity of RRS was affected by interaction with pro-EMAPII. The full-length and N-terminal 72-amino acid truncated (ΔN72) RRS were expressed as GST-fusion proteins. The fused GST was removed by proteolytic cleavage, and the purified full-length and N-terminal truncated RRS proteins were used for the enzyme assay (Fig. 3). The reaction catalyzed by tRNA synthetases proceeds in two steps. The first step is activation of the amino acid by reaction with ATP, and the second step involves transfer of the activated amino acid to the cognate tRNAs. Aminoacylation activity of the full-length RRS was enhanced approximately 2.5-fold in the presence of pro-EMAPII (Fig.4, left bars). Since arginine-dependent [32P]pyrophosphate-ATP exchange assay showed that the adenylation step of RRS was not affected by addition of pro-EMAPII (data not shown), the activity enhancement probably results from the second step of the reaction. Activity stimulation was not detected when the separated N- or C-terminal domain of pro-EMAPII was added, indicating that the full-length pro-EMAPII is necessary for the effect (Fig. 4, left bars). The truncated RRS retained aminoacylation activity comparable with the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that the N-terminal extension is not essential for the enzyme activity (Fig. 4, middle bars). However, the activity of this mutant was not increased by pro-EMAPII, indicating that interaction of pro-EMAPII with the N-terminal extension of RRS is essential for the stimulatory effect (Fig. 4, middle bars). To investigate whether the stimulatory effect of pro-EMAPII is specific for RRS, we employed human lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KRS) which does not appear to interact with p43 (7Quevillon S. Robinson J.-C. Berthonneau E. Siatecka M. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The aminoacylation activities of KRS were measured in the absence and presence of pro-EMAPII. KRS activity was not affected by the addition of pro-EMAPII, suggesting that activity stimulation is specific to RRS (Fig. 4, right bars). Kinetic analyses on the aminoacylation of RRS were carried out at different concentrations of pro-EMAPII to understand how pro-EMAPII enhances the RRS activity. The activity enhancement reached a maximum at a 2-fold molar excess of pro-EMAPII to RRS and further addition of pro-EMAPII resulted in gradual decrease in the reaction rate (Fig.5, left panel). A Lineweaver-Burk plot of the reaction showed that the apparentK m of RRS with respect to tRNA was reduced by the addition of pro-EMAPII, whereas its k cat value was not changed (Fig. 5, right panel). Excess pro-EMAPII probably binds to the tRNA substrate and lowers its effective concentration. Pro-EMAPII (8Kao J. Ryan J. Brett J. Chen J. Shen H. Fan Y.-G. Godman G. Familletti P. Wang F. Pan Y.-C. Stern D. Clauss M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20239-20247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and p43 (6Quevillon S. Agou F. Robinson J.-C. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32573-32579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) have been independently isolated from different organisms. In this work, we found that pro-EMAPII interacts with RRS (Figs. 1 and 2). Previous cross-linking and genetic experiments showed the linkage of p43 and RRS (7Quevillon S. Robinson J.-C. Berthonneau E. Siatecka M. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, all of these results support that p43 and pro-EMAPII are responsible for similar functions within the cell. The full-length pro-EMAPII was required for the activity enhancement of RRS although the N-terminal domain of pro-EMAPII was sufficient for the direct interaction with pro-EMAPII (Fig. 4). It was previously shown that the C-terminal domain of pro-EMAPII contains tRNA binding activity (6Quevillon S. Agou F. Robinson J.-C. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32573-32579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The kinetic analyses showed that pro-EMAPII affected only the apparent K m value to tRNA and notk cat of the enzyme (Fig. 5). Probably, tRNA recruited to the C-terminal domain of pro-EMAPII is delivered to the active site of RRS. Although the activity of RRS was enhanced about 2.5-fold by pro-EMAPII under our experimental conditions, its effect may be more significant in vivo because RRS present in the multi-protein complex would have limited accessibility to tRNA Mammalian RRS exists in two forms differing by the N-terminal extension (15Vellekamp G. Sihag R.K. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9843-9847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The larger RRS containing the N-terminal extension is found in the multi-synthetase complex, whereas the smaller RRS exists in a free form (18Girjes A.A. Hobson K. Philip C. Lavin M.F. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 164: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Lazard M. Mirande M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The complex-associated larger RRS showed a 7-fold higherK m for the tRNA substrate than the complex-free RRS, whereas other kinetic properties were similar (15Vellekamp G. Sihag R.K. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9843-9847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps, the higherK m value of the complex-associated RRS for the tRNA substrate requires compensation by an active delivery of the tRNA substrate. In the case of RRS, the delivery of tRNA appears to be mediated by a trans-acting factor, pro-EMAPII. This mechanism is also reminiscent of yeast Arc1p, which forms a complex with methionyl-tRNA synthetase and stimulates its aminoacylation activity (21Simos G. Sauer A. Fasiolo F. Hurt E.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). ARSs have developed different ways to modulate their catalytic activities and the efficiency of protein synthesis. For example, the N-terminal extension of rat aspartyl-tRNA synthetase facilitates the release of aminoacylated tRNA to elongation factor (22Reed V.S. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32937-32941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Reed V.S. Wasteny M.E. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32932-32936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the aminoacylation reaction of rabbit valyl-tRNA synthetase is enhanced by interaction with elongation factor EF-1H (24Negrutskii B. Shalak V.F. Kerjan P. El'skaya A.N. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4545-4550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The N-terminal extension of yeast glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase promotes specific recognition of its cognate tRNA (25Whelihan E.F. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2968-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal appendix of E. coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase helps to dock its cognate tRNA to the active site (26Kim S. Landro J.A. Gale A.J. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13026-13031Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Whereas all of these functions are exerted by the peptide extensions connected in cis to the catalytic domains of ARSs, yeast Arc1p and mammalian pro-EMAPII aretrans-acting factors. These factors may have more functional flexibility than the cis-acting peptide extensions because they can easily dissociate from the ARS and interact with cellular molecules for other physiological roles. Human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was recently shown to be secreted from apoptotic tumor cells and is cleaved to release the two distinct cytokine domains (27Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the released C-terminal domain is homologous to EMAPII. These results along with our data suggest that protein synthesis and apoptosis are functionally coordinated via novel domains covalently or noncovalently linked to ARSs. We thank Drs. Y. G. Ko, W. Seol, K. Zahn, and S. Martinis for critical comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2019750243,"The chemical dynamics of highly vibrationally excited molecules have been studied by measuring the quantum state–resolved scattering probabilities of nitric oxide (NO) molecules on clean and oxygen-covered copper (111) surfaces, where the incident NO was prepared in single quantum states with vibrational energies of as much as 300 kilojoules per mole. The dependence of vibrationally elastic and inelastic scattering on oxygen coverage strongly suggests that highly excited NO ( v = 13 and 15) reacts on clean copper (111) with a probability of 0.87 ± 0.05, more than three orders of magnitude greater than the reaction probability of ground-state NO. Vibrational promotion of surface chemistry on metals (up to near-unit reaction probability) is possible despite the expected efficient relaxation of vibrational energy at metal surfaces."

https://openalex.org/W2009074195,"The nuclear factor kappaB, a transcription factor regulating the expression of multiple genes including genes essential for cell cycle control, is found in most cells in a dormant state in the cytoplasm bound to the inhibitory family I kappaB via an ankyrin repeat domain. Stimulation of cells with a variety of inducers inactivates I kappaB proteins. The active dimeric NF-kappaB complex, often composed of 50- and 65-kilodalton subunits of the Rel family, translocates into the nucleus, where the NF-kappaBp65 subunit stimulates transcription. Here we report that a family of proteins containing ankyrin repeats, the inhibitors of Cdk4 (INK4) is able to bind NF-kappaBp65. The association of p16INK4 with NF-kappaBp65 is considerable in HeLa- or 293 cells, if the NF-kappaB inhibitor I kappaB alpha is degraded in response to TNFalpha stimulation. Overexpression of INK4 molecules suppresses the transactivational ability of NF-kappaB significantly. In contrast to INK4 proteins, the cell cycle inhibitor p27 enhances NF-kappaB transactivation activity. Thus, the effect of INK4 proteins on NF-kappaB function possibly modifies NF-kappaB mediated transcriptional activation of cell cycle associated factors."

https://openalex.org/W2790819968,"Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine/threonine kinases that play an important role in mediating intracellular signal transduction in eukaryotes. U937 cells were exposed to microgravity during a space shuttle flight and stimulated with a radiolabeled phorbol ester ([3H]PDBu) to both specifically label and activate translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the particulate fraction of the cell. Although significant translocation of PKC occurred at all g levels, the kinetics of translocation in flight were significantly different from those on the ground. In addition, the total quantity of [3H]PDBu binding PKC was increased in flight compared to cells at 1 g on the ground, whereas the quantity in hypergravity (1.4 g) was decreased with respect to 1 g. Similarly, in purified human peripheral blood T cells the quantity of PKCdelta varied in inverse proportion to the g level for some experimental treatments. In addition to these novel findings, the results confirm earlier studies which showed that PKC is sensitive to changes in gravitational acceleration. The mechanisms of cellular gravisensitivity are poorly understood but the demonstrated sensitivity of PKC to this stimulus provides us with a useful means of measuring the effect of altered gravity levels on early cell activation events."

The Gα subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins are GTP hydrolyases which, upon receptor activation, bind to GTP and regulate effector molecules (1Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu.

Gα-catalyzed hydrolysis of GTP to GDP releases the Gα·GDP product complex from effector and allows its sequestration by inhibitory Gβγsubunits.

In particular, the positions of the presumptive nucleophilic water (Wnuc), Mg2+, and the side chains of catalytically significant residues have been determined. Structures of Giα1 and Gtα complexed with GDP·AlF4−·Wnuc, a mimic of the pentavalent transition state for GTP hydrolysis, have also been determined (8Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E.

In crystals of Giα1·GTPγS, which mimics the ground state E·S complex, the side chains of these residues are partly disordered and do not interact with the substrate analog. In contrast, in complexes of Giα1 and its homolog Gtα with GDP·AlF4−, both residues are well ordered and interact with AlF4− and its axial water ligand (8Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 3.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar, 4.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar min−1) exhibited by Giα1 (14Linder M.E. Ewald D.A. Miller R.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8243-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and its homologs might be attributed to a high activation energy for the conformational rearrangement of Arg178 and Gln204 from the ground state to the transition state (3.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). However, the nature of this rearrangement is not established, in part because the Giα1·GTPγS complex may not accurately mimic the true E·S complex. Specifically, the thiol substituent of the γ-phosphate in GTPγS may sterically perturb the catalytic site. The sulfur atom is both more bulky than the corresponding oxygen atom of GTP (van der Waals radii of 1.8 and 1.4 Å, respectively) and has a longer bond length with the γ-phosphate atom (P-S, 1.86 Å; P-O, 1.52 Å). Hence, to obtain a more accurate view of the E·S ground state, we have determined a high resolution x-ray crystal structure of Giα1 complexed with an alternative nonhydrolyzable GTP analog: GppNHp. In GppNHp all three terminal substituents of the γ-phosphate group are oxygen atoms. The active site of the Giα1·GppNHp complex differs from that with GTPγS in several respects, but most importantly in the conformation of the catalytic residue Gln204. In this conformation, Gln204 interacts with Wnuc, but neither contacts the nucleotide nor is positioned to interact with the pentavalent transition state. Thus, Gln204 may participate directly in the Giα1·GTP ground state but must reorient to stabilize the transition state. RGS4, a member of the RGS family of G protein stimulatory factors (15Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol.

Non-myristoylated, recombinant rat Giα1 was synthesized in E. coli and purified as described previously (17Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Crystals of Giα1 complexed with GppNHp and Mg2+ were grown and prepared for x-ray data collection as described except that GppNHp was substituted for GTPγS (18Coleman D.E. Lee E. Mixon M.B.

The first was measured at the Cornell synchrotron source (CHESS) A1 line (λ = 0.91 Å) equipped with an ADSC Quantum 1 CCD detector.

Small changes in the side chain conformations of other residues were also observed. Simulated annealing omit maps (22Hodel A. Kim S.-H. Brünger A.T. Acta Cryst. Sec. A. 1992; 48: 851-858Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar) were used to confirm that the observed differences were not caused by model bias. The protein model was manually rebuilt and ligands were added using the interactive graphics model building program O (23Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M.O. O, Version 5.9. Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden1993Google Scholar). Positional and atomic temperature factor refinement was carried out on the rebuilt model using XPLOR (24Brünger A.T. XPLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) followed by additional rounds of model building and refinement. In the final rounds, a bulk solvent correction (25Jiang J.S. Brünger A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 100-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) was applied using XPLOR. Electron density about the active site is shown in Fig. 2. The free-R factor, computed using 5% of the data, was used to monitor the refinement (26Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3834) Google Scholar). The structure exhibits good stereochemistry, with 94% of the residues in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot as analyzed by PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Comparisons and superposition of the model with other proteins was carried out using O. Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table I. The model of the RGS4·Giα1·GppNHp complex was made by superimposing the Cα atoms of residues 34–343 of Giα1 from the Giα1·GppNHp complex onto the corresponding atoms of the RGS4·Giα1·GDP·AlF4−complex (PDB accession code 1agr). Giα1·GDP·AlF4− was then replaced by the superimposed Giα1·GppNHp complex. Analysis and in silico mutations were then performed on the resulting RGS4·Giα1·GppNHp model using O. The structure of the Giα1·GppNHp complex (Fig.2 A) differs from that of Giα1·GTPγS (Fig.2 B) in two ways. First, there are small changes in the side-chain positions of several surface residues that are poorly ordered in crystals of Giα1·GTPγS. These differences are most likely because of damping of thermal motions in the frozen Giα1·GppNHp crystals. In contrast, 2.0 Å data from Giα1·GTPγS crystals were collected at 14 °C. Additionally, the Giα1·GppNHp data set was measured to 1.5 Å, permitting unambiguous assignment of side chain conformations. The second, and more interesting, group of changes relative to Giα1·GTPγS are observed in the active site and are most likely attributable to GppNHp (Fig. 2 A). For the most part, the active site is similar to that observed in the Giα1·GTPγS complex (Fig. 2 B). All of the interactions between the guanine nucleotide, Mg2+, and the protein observed in the latter complex are also present in Giα1·GppNHp. The presumptive water nucleophile (Wnuc) is also clearly observed (Fig.1). A new feature of the active site is a highly ordered (B = 21.9Å2) water molecule (W600) bound to the O1G oxygen of the γ-phosphate (Fig. 1and Fig. 2 A). Modeling indicates that this water molecule cannot bind to the Giα1·GTPγS complex because it would be sterically excluded by the γ-thiophosphate sulfur atom of GTPγS. The conformation of Glu43 is altered, and its carboxylate moiety forms a hydrogen bond to W600 and consequently cannot form the hydrogen bond to Arg242 that is present in Giα1·GTPγS (Fig. 2, A and B). In Giα1·GppNHp, Glu43 and Arg178 form a doubly hydrogen-bonded ion pair (Fig.2 A), in contrast to the less intimate ion pair interaction observed in the Giα1·GTPγS complex (Fig.2 B). This enhanced salt-bridge may strengthen binding of GTP in the ground state. Remarkably, the same interaction occurs in crystals of Giα1·GDP complexed with G protein βγ subunits (28Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). The conformations of Arg178 in Giα1·GppNHp and Giα1·GTPγS differ slightly, but in neither case does Arg178 interact with the GTP substrate analog. In contrast, in the Gtα·GTPγS complex, the corresponding residue, Arg174, interacts directly with the oxygen bridging the β- and γ-phosphate atoms and the γ-thiophosphate sulfur atom. The bridging NH group of GppNHp would not be capable of this interaction however. The orientation of Gln204 in the GppNHp complex is particularly interesting. In the Giα1·GTPγS complex the side chain of this residue, which assumes the favoredgauche + χ1 conformation, is poorly ordered and directed out of the active site, and does not appear to interact with any other residues (Fig. 2 B). Similar conformations for the corresponding catalytic glutamine (Glncat) are observed in the GTPγS-Gtα, -Gsα, and -Gsα·adenylyl cyclase complexes (6Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sunahara R.K. Tesmer J.J.G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In contrast, Gln204 exhibits strong density for thegauche − χ1 conformation in the Giα1·GppNHp complex and makes several contacts with other moieties (Figs. 1 and 2 A). Notably, while Gln204 does not interact directly with the substrate analog, its side chain amino group forms a hydrogen bond to Wnuc. The orientation of the amide group is defined by the functionality of the three other moieties to which Wnuc is hydrogen bonded: the O1G oxygen of the γ-phosphate group, which is proposed to act as a catalytic base (30Schweins T. Geyer M. Scheffzek K. Warshel A. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 31Schweins T. Geyer M. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Warshel A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14225-14231Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Thr181, and the main chain NH group of Gln204 (Fig. 2 A). Gln204 is also anchored by a hydrogen bond between its carboxamide oxygen atom and the hydroxyl moiety of Ser206. The thiophosphate moiety of GTPγS does not prevent Gln204from adopting the conformation observed in the GppNHp complex; however, it does block entry of W600 to the active site. W600, in turn prevents Gln204 from assuming the conformation that is partly populated in the GTPγS complex. In the GppNHp complex, the hydrogen bond between the phosphate O1G oxygen and Wnuc is shorter than the corresponding interaction in the GTPγS complex (2.82 versus 3.27 Å). The position of Wnuc closer to the γ-phosphate permits a more favorable interaction with the side chain of Gln204. The well ordered conformation of Gln204 in the GppNHp complex may be attributed to hydrogen bonds formed with Wnuc and Ser206 but also to the conformational restriction imposed by W600 as well as the cryogenic data measurement conditions. In other G protein-GppNHp or -GppCp complexes, Glncat also interacts with Wnuc (32Hirshberg M. Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 33Milburn M.V. Tong L. deVos A.M. Brünger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.-H. Science. 1990; 247: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). However, in these cases Glncat assumes the gauche + χ1 conformation. The most intriguing feature of the Giα1·GppNHp complex is the conformation of the side chain of Gln204 and its implications for the mechanism of both intrinsic and RGS-stimulated GTP hydrolysis. As established by mutagenesis studies (11Freissmuth M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21907-21914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Gln204, and the corresponding residues in other G proteins (13.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar, 34Der C.J. Finkel T.

Nature. 1989; 340: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar), is absolutely required for enzymatic activity. Studies of substrate-assisted catalysis using GTPase-deficient Gsαhave demonstrated that a hydrogen donor group near the γ-phosphate can substitute for Glncat (36Zor T. Andorn R. Sofer I. Chorev M. Selinger Z. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the function of Glncat during GTP hydrolysis by G proteins has been debated. Hydrolysis of GTP in G proteins is believed to occur by a direct, in-line attack on the γ-phosphate atom by a nucleophilic water (37Webb M.R. Eccleston J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7734-7737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Eccleston J.F. Webb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5046-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Feuerstein J. Goody R.S. Webb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6188-6190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crystal structures of Giα1 and other G proteins have identified, near the γ-phosphate group, a well ordered water molecule (Wnuc) that is positioned to carry out a nucleophilic attack (7Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 8Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

Nature. 1993; 365: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Although Gln204 is near Wnuc in Giα1·GTPγS, it does not directly contact it. Further, Wnuc is observed in Gln204 → Leu Giα1·GTPγS, and Gln61 → Leu Ras·GppNHp (Gln61 is Glncat in Ras) (8Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

Cell. 1990; 62: 539-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), indicating that Glncatis not required for binding of Wnuc in the ground state. It has been pointed out that the basicity of glutamine is low, and it is therefore unlikely that Glncat acts as the general base that deprotonates Wnuc (43Privé G.G. Milburn M.V. Tong L. deVos A.M. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3649-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Rather, an oxygen of the presumably dianionic γ-phosphate is proposed to serve this function in Ras (30Schweins T. Geyer M. Scheffzek K. Warshel A. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 31Schweins T. Geyer M. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Warshel A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14225-14231Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Hence, Glncat may only polarize Wnuc in the ground state. X-ray crystallographic studies have indicated that Glncatstabilizes the transition state (5.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar), as originally proposed by Priveet al. (43Privé G.G. Milburn M.V. Tong L. deVos A.M. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3649-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Structures of Giα1 and Gtα complexed with the transition state analog GDP·AlF4−, reveal Glncatpositioned within the active site and directly interacting with a fluorine substituent and Wnuc of the GDP·AlF4−·Wnuc complex. Fig.2 C shows these interactions in the RGS4·Giα1·GDP·AlF4−complex (44Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the amino group of Glncat stabilizes negative character on the equatorial oxygen of the transition state and its carbamoyl oxygen stabilizes the attacking nucleophilic water. A similar configuration is observed in the Ras-GAP·Ras·GDP·AlF4− and the Rho-GAP·Cdc42Hs·GDP·AlF4− complexes (45Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F.

Biol. 1998; 5: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations that perturb the transition state conformation of Glncat abolish GTPase activity (42Krengel U. Schlichting I. Scherer A. Schumann R. Frech M. John J. Kabsch W. Pai E.F. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1990; 62: 539-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 48Raw A.S. Coleman D.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15660-15669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that Glncat stabilizes the transition state for GTP hydrolysis. The GppNHp complex provides novel insights into both the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis as well as to the role of both Argcat and Glncat in the ground state E·S complex. GppNHp, but not GTPγS, permits a water molecule, W600, to occupy a position in which it could act as the ultimate proton acceptor from Wnuc. Water molecules in similar, but not identical, positions are present in the GppNHp- or GppCp-bound complexes of Ras and Rac1 (32Hirshberg M. Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 40Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). A proton could be relayed from Wnuc to W600 via O1G of the GTP γ-phosphate. This substituent does not otherwise participate in hydrogen bonds with the protein and corresponds to the thiol of GTPγS. The basicity of W600may be enhanced by hydrogen bond formation with Glu43, which is well conserved in Gα proteins with the exception of Gzα where it is replaced with an asparagine residue. Glu43 also forms a hydrogen-bonded ion pair with Arg178. In this conformation, Arg178 is restrained from interacting with the γ-phosphate of GTP. Transfer of a proton from Wnuc to W600 would tend to weaken this ion pair, releasing Arg178 to stabilize the incipient pentacoordinate phosphoryl transition state. W600 also blocks the side chain of Gln204 from interacting with the pentacoordinate phosphate. Thus, until it diffuses from the active site, W600 impedes the reorganization of the catalytic site that is required for transition state stabilization. Gln204 is anchored in a noncatalytic conformation by hydrogen bonds to both Wnuc and Ser206(Ser206 is substituted by an Asp in Gαs,). In the ground state, Gln204 could orient and perhaps activate Wnuc; however, to stabilize the transition state as represented by G protein GDP·AlF4−complexes, Gln204 must sever its hydrogen bond with Ser206 and Wnuc and rotate ≈120° about χ1 and ≈90° about χ2 and χ3 (to gauche+ and gauche−, respectively) such that its carbamoyl group donates a hydrogen bond to the equatorial oxygen of the pentacoordinate γ-phosphoryl group and accepts a hydrogen bond from Wnuc. Such would incur a substantial penalty in catalytic efficiency and perhaps account, at least in part, for the low catalytic rate of GTP hydrolysis in Gα and perhaps in other G proteins. We propose that the ground state Giα1·GTP complex is “auto-inhibited” with Glncat locked into an unproductive conformation. Active site residues in the EF-Tu·GppNHp complex also assumes anti-catalytic positions; in this case Hiscat, the residue corresponding to Glncat, cannot interact with the substrates because of steric interference by other active site residues (41Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O.A. Schirmer N.K. Sprinzl M. Hilgenfeld R. Nature. 1993; 365: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In Giα1, catalysis could occur only if the bonds that hold Glncat in this position are broken, and the side chain freed to interact with the pentacoordinate transition state. This model predicts that changes that disrupt the ground state conformation of Gln204, while not otherwise compromising the active site, would increasek cat. RGS proteins, which accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis by Giα1 by 50–100-fold, may act in part by destabilizing the ground state conformation of Glncat, as well as stabilizing its productive conformation in the transition state (44Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the RGS4·Giα1·GDP·AlF4−complex demonstrates that RGS4 stabilizes the active site of Giα1 in the conformation corresponding to that of the transition state complex (Fig. 2 C) (44Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). No residues from RGS4 are inserted into the active site except Asn128, which could enhance catalysis by aiding in binding, orienting, and polarizing Wnuc in the pre-transition state complex (44Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). However, superposition of Giα1·GppNHp and Giα1·GDP·AlF4− from the RGS4·Giα1·GDP·AlF4−complex reveals that the carbamoyl groups of Gln204 and Asn128 occupy nearly the same positions, although the side chains approach from opposite directions (Fig. 2 D). Further, both residues are positioned such that they can bind the nucleophilic water and Ser206. We suggest that Asn128 of RGS4 displaces the side chain of Gln204 from its “anti-catalytic” position in the ground state, freeing it to participate in stabilization of the transition state. Mutational analysis of RGS proteins supports this hypothesis. Mutation of Asn131 in hRGSr (analogous to Asn128 of RGS4) to either serine or glutamine resulted in a relatively small decrease in the k cat of Gtα (49Natochin M. McEntaffer R.L. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6731-6735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, hRGSr in which Asn131 was mutated to leucine or alanine also retains substantial stimulatory activity, and the loss of activity that was observed could be attributed to weakened binding of these mutants to Gtα. Similar mutagenic studies have been performed with RGS4 (50Posner B.A. Mukhopadhyay S. Tesmer J.J.G. Gilman A.G. Ross E.M. Biolchemistry. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Mutants of Asn128analogous to those of hRGSr Asn131 were modeled in the structure of the “RGS4·Giα1·GppNHp” complex. In all cases these residues were in steric conflict with Gln204. These findings indicate that the bulk and binding of the residue at position 128 is important to the stimulatory activity of RGS4 although it is unlikely that it has a direct catalytic role in stimulation of GTPase activity (49Natochin M. McEntaffer R.L. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6731-6735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The evidence presented is consistent with a self-inhibited or anti-catalytic model of the ground state of Gα proteins, and a role for RGS proteins in stimulating GTPase activity by releasing Gα subunits from this ground state while stabilizing the transition state."

https://openalex.org/W1993101800,"The cell cycle machinery is regulated by cyclin dependent kinases and sets of activating and inhibitory proteins. The G1-S control mechanism is often deregulated in tumours supposedly leading to increased kinase activity, phosphorylation of substrates and subsequent S phase entrance. Increased kinase activity has been proposed to be essential in cell cycle aberrations, but few studies have actually shown enhanced kinase activity related to specific cell cycle defects in primary tumours. In the present study we have determined the cyclin E dependent kinase activity (cyclin Ekinase) in 59 primary breast cancers, using an H1-kinase assay, and related the activity to the expression of cyclin E, p27 and p21. In a subgroup of 48 tumours, we further characterized the association between cyclin Ekinase, in vivo phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and proliferation. The cyclin Ekinase correlated significantly with cyclin E content and inversely with p27 and p21 expression. P27, but not p21, was associated with low cyclin Ekinase in specimens with normal/low levels of cyclin E. At elevated cyclin E levels, suppression of cyclin Ekinase seemed to require high levels of both p21 and p27. The cyclin Ekinase correlated with the phosphorylation status of pRb as well as with proliferation. Surprisingly, pRb phosphorylation did not correlate with proliferation. Our results support that pRb is a substrate for cyclin Ekinase in primary breast cancer and that deregulation of cyclin E and p27 act through increased CDK-kinase activity, but cyclin E associated events beside pRb phosphorylation might be rate-limiting for entrance into S phase."
https://openalex.org/W2325799722,"Several regions of chromsome arm 8p are frequently deleted in a variety of human malignancies including those of the prostate, head and neck, lung, and colon, suggesting that there is more than one tumor suppressor gene on this chromosome arm. Both laryngeal and oral squamous cell carcinomas exhibit three distinct and nonoverlapping regions of deletion on 8p. We have further refined the localization of the putative suppressor in 8p23 by using eight microsatellite loci to create a high resolution deletion map of 150 squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx and oral cavity. These new data demonstrate that there are two distinct classes of deletion within this relatively small region of the chromosome and suggest two possible locations for the gene within the D8S264 to D8S1788 interval. We also determined that there is little difference between the allelic loss frequencies of microsatellites mapping near the telomeric ends of other chromosome arms and loci mapping to more centromere proximal regions of the same arm. These data suggest that the high allelic loss frequencies seen at 8p23 loci are not the result of a generalized instability of chromosome ends and are instead consistent with the activation of a specific suppressor gene."
https://openalex.org/W1916755621,"The well-defined osteoblast line, MC3T3-E1 was used to examine fibronectin (FN) mRNA levels, protein synthesis, and extracellular FN matrix accumulation after growth activation in spaceflight. These osteoblasts produce FN extracellular matrix (ECM) known to regulate adhesion, differentiation, and function in adherent cells. Changes in bone ECM and osteoblast cell shape occur in spaceflight. To determine whether altered FN matrix is a factor in causing these changes in spaceflight, quiescent osteoblasts were launched into microgravity and were then sera activated with and without a 1-gravity field. Synthesis of FN mRNA, protein, and matrix were measured after activation in microgravity. FN mRNA synthesis is significantly reduced in microgravity (0-G) when compared to ground (GR) osteoblasts flown in a centrifuge simulating earth's gravity (1-G) field 2.5 h after activation. However, 27.5 h after activation there were no significant differences in mRNA synthesis. A small but significant reduction of FN protein was found in the 0-G samples 2.5 h after activation. Total FN protein 27.5 h after activation showed no significant difference between any of the gravity conditions, however, there was a fourfold increase in absolute amount of protein synthesized during the incubation. Using immunofluorescence, we found no significant differences in the amount or in the orientation of the FN matrix after 27.5 h in microgravity. These results demonstrate that FN is made by sera-activated osteoblasts even during exposure to microgravity. These data also suggest that after a total period of 43 h of spaceflight FN transcription, translation, or altered matrix assembly is not responsible for the altered cell shape or altered matrix formation of osteoblasts.—Hughes-Fulford, M., Gilbertson, V.

Mechanical stimulation of LE-RPE cells triggers Ca2+ influx, mediated by stretch-sensitive cation channels followed byintracellular Ca2+ release. A regenerative [Ca2+]i wave was found with a lower propagation rate in RCS-RPE cells. This rate could be increased by PKC down-regulation. Mechanical stimulation caused a [Ca2+]i increase in the mechanically stimulated (MS) cell followed after a delay by a [Ca2+]i rise in the adjacent cell layers. The intercellular [Ca2+]i wave propagation could be blocked by gap junction blockers such as halothane or PKC activation. An inhibition of the [Ca2+]i-wave propagation similar to that induced by halothane could be observed in cells grown in solutions containing 14 mM or higher concentrations of glucose. PKC down-regulated cells grown in glucose-rich medium did not develop this inhibitory effect on gap junction communication (GJC). FRAP experiments confirmed that the observed changes were consistent with a PKC-mediated inhibitory effect of high glucose concentrations on GJC. FASEB J. 13 (Suppl.), S63–S68 (1999)"

https://openalex.org/W1839245335,"European Space Agency (ESA) studies demonstrated that bull sperm swim with higher velocity in microgravity (microG) than at 1 G. Coupling between protein phosphorylation and sperm motility during activation in microG and at 1 G was examined in the ESA Biorack on two space shuttle missions. Immotile sperm were activated to swim (86-90% motility) at launch +20 h by dilution into artificial seawater (ASW). Parallel ground controls were performed 2 h after the flight experiment. Activation after 0, 30, and 60 s was terminated with electrophoresis sample buffer and samples analyzed for phosphoamino acids by Western blotting. Phosphorylation of a 130-kDa phosphothreonine-containing protein (FP130) occurred three to four times faster in microG than at 1 G. A 32-kDa phosphoserine-containing protein was significantly stimulated at 30 s but returned to 1 G control levels at 60 s. The rate of FP130 phosphorylation in microG was attenuated by D2O, suggesting that changes in water properties participate in altering signal transduction. Changes in FP130 phosphorylation triggered by the egg peptide speract were delayed in microG. These results demonstrate that previously observed effects of microG on sperm motility are coupled to changes in phosphorylation of specific flagellar proteins and that early events of sperm activation and fertilization are altered in microG."
https://openalex.org/W2169606301,"Primary adult rat cardiomyocytes (ARC)in culture are shown to be a model system for cardiac cell hypertrophy in vitro. ARC undergo a process of morphological transformation and grow only by increase in cell size, however, without loss of the cardiac phenotype. The isolated cells spread and establish new cell-cell contacts, eventually forming a two-dimensional heart tissue-like synchronously beating cell sheet. The reformation of specific cell contacts (intercalated disks) is shown also between ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes by using antibodies against the gap junction protein connexin-43 and after microinjection into ARC of N-cadherin cDNA fused to reporter green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA. The expressed fusion protein allowed the study of live cell cultures and of the dynamics of the adherens junction protein N-cadherin during the formation of new cell-cell contacts. The possible use of the formed ARC cell-sheet cells under microgravity conditions as a test system for the reformation of the cytoskeleton of heart muscle cells is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1509616964,"Tip-growing, unicellular Chara rhizoids that react gravitropically on Earth developed in microgravity. In microgravity, they grew out from the nodes of the green thallus in random orientation. Development and morphogenesis followed an endogenous program that is not affected by the gravitational field. The cell shape, the polar cytoplasmic organization, and the polar distribution of cell organelles, except for the statoliths, were not different from controls that had grown on earth (ground controls). The ultrastructure of the organelles and the microtubules were well preserved. Microtubules were excluded from the apical zone in both ground controls as well as microgravity-grown rhizoids. The statoliths (vesicles containing BaSO4 crystals in a matrix) in microgravity-grown rhizoids were spread over a larger area (up to 50 microm basal to the tip) than the statoliths of ground controls (10-30 microm). Some statoliths were even located in the subapical zone close to microtubules, which was not observed in ground controls. The crystals in statoliths from microgravity-grown rhizoids appeared more loosely arranged in the vesicle matrix compared with ground controls. The chemical composition of the crystals was identified as BaSO4 by X-ray microanalysis. There is evidence that the amount of BaSO4 in statoliths of rhizoids developed in microgravity is lower than in ground controls, indicating that the gravisensitivity of microgravity-developed rhizoids might be reduced compared with ground controls. Lack of gravity, however, does not affect the process of tip growth and does not inhibit the development of the structures needed for the gravity-sensing machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2041252271,"The regulation of transcription by signal transduction pathways is well documented. In addition, we have previously shown that src can regulate pre-mRNA processing. To investigate which functional domains of src are involved in the regulation of splicing and transport of Lymphotoxin alpha (LTalpha) transcripts, we have used src mutants in the catalytic, SH2 and SH3 domains in association with the Y527F or the E378G activating mutation. Our results establish that the regulation of pre-mRNA processing and transcription can occur independently of each other. The splicing and transport phenotypes require an intact tyrosine kinase domain and both are insensitive to the deletion of the SH3 domain. Therefore these phenotypes do not depend upon the recruitment through the SH3 domain of src of RNA binding proteins (Sam 68, hnRNP K). By contrast, deletions in the SH2 domain have no effect on splicing but either abolish or exacerbate the transport phenotype depending upon the activating mutation (Y527F or E378G). These divergent responses are associated with specific changes in the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. Thus, the regulation of transcription, splicing and mRNA transport implicate different effector pathways of src. Furthermore, analysis of the transport phenotype reveals the interplay between the SH2 and catalytic domain of the protein."

https://openalex.org/W2153034427,"Spore color mutants of the fungus Sordaria macrospora Auersw. were crossed under spaceflight conditions on the space shuttle to MIR mission S/MM 05 (STS-81). The arrangement of spores of different colors in the asci allowed conclusions on the influence of spaceflight conditions on sexual recombination in fungi. Experiments on a 1-g centrifuge in space and in parallel on the ground were used for controls. The samples were analyzed microscopically on their return to earth. Each fruiting body was assessed separately. Statistical analysis of the data showed a significant increase in gene recombination frequencies caused by the heavy ion particle stream in space radiation. The lack of gravity did not influence crossing-over frequencies. Hyphae of the flown samples were assessed for DNA strand breaks. No increase in damage was found compared with the ground samples. It was shown that S. macrospora is able to repair radiation-induced DNA strand breaks within hours.—Hahn, A., Hock, B.
