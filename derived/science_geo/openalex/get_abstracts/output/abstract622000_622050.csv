https://openalex.org/W2899763402,"Budding yeasts (subphylum Saccharomycotina) are found in every biome and are as genetically diverse as plants or animals. To understand budding yeast evolution, we analyzed the genomes of 332 yeast species, including 220 newly sequenced ones, which represent nearly one-third of all known budding yeast diversity. Here, we establish a robust genus-level phylogeny comprising 12 major clades, infer the timescale of diversification from the Devonian period to the present, quantify horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and reconstruct the evolution of 45 metabolic traits and the metabolic toolkit of the budding yeast common ancestor (BYCA). We infer that BYCA was metabolically complex and chronicle the tempo and mode of genomic and phenotypic evolution across the subphylum, which is characterized by very low HGT levels and widespread losses of traits and the genes that control them. More generally, our results argue that reductive evolution is a major mode of evolutionary diversification."
https://openalex.org/W2899927624,"Strong evidence implicates the complement pathway as an important contributor to amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the role of complement in tau modulation remains unclear. Here we show that the expression of C3 and C3a receptor (C3aR1) are positively correlated with cognitive decline and Braak staging in human AD brains. Deletion of C3ar1 in PS19 mice results in the rescue of tau pathology and attenuation of neuroinflammation, synaptic deficits, and neurodegeneration. Through RNA sequencing and cell-type-specific transcriptomic analysis, we identify a C3aR-dependent transcription factor network that regulates a reactive glial switch whose inactivation ameliorates disease-associated microglia and neurotoxic astrocyte signatures. Strikingly, this C3aR network includes multiple genes linked to late-onset AD. Mechanistically, we identify STAT3 as a direct target of C3-C3aR signaling that functionally mediates tau pathogenesis. All together our findings demonstrate a crucial role for activation of the C3-C3aR network in mediating neuroinflammation and tau pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2809141540,"Hedgehog protein signals mediate tissue patterning and maintenance by binding to and inactivating their common receptor Patched, a 12-transmembrane protein that otherwise would suppress the activity of the 7-transmembrane protein Smoothened. Loss of Patched function, the most common cause of basal cell carcinoma, permits unregulated activation of Smoothened and of the Hedgehog pathway. A cryo-EM structure of the Patched protein reveals striking transmembrane domain similarities to prokaryotic RND transporters. A central hydrophobic conduit with cholesterol-like contents courses through the extracellular domain and resembles that used by other RND proteins to transport substrates, suggesting Patched activity in cholesterol transport. Cholesterol activity in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is reduced by PTCH1 expression but rapidly restored by Hedgehog stimulation, suggesting that PTCH1 regulates Smoothened by controlling cholesterol availability."

Using population- and single-cell transcriptomics, as well as long-term lineage tracing, we studied whether murine dermal fibroblasts are altered during physiological aging under different dietary regimes that affect longevity. We show that the identity of old fibroblasts becomes undefined, with the fibroblast states present in young skin no longer clearly demarcated. In addition, old fibroblasts not only reduce the expression of genes involved in the formation of the extracellular matrix, but also gain adipogenic traits, paradoxically becoming more similar to neonatal pro-adipogenic fibroblasts. These alterations are sensitive to systemic metabolic changes: long-term caloric restriction reversibly prevents them, whereas a high-fat diet potentiates them. Our results therefore highlight loss of cell identity and the acquisition of adipogenic traits as a mechanism underlying cellular aging, which is influenced by systemic metabolism.

Tissue function declines with age, impairing the ability of tissues to sustain daily homeostasis and repair damage. A major source of physiological tissue aging is the functional decay of adult stem cells through the cell-intrinsic accumulation of damage (such as DNA damage, loss of proteostasis, and oxidative damage). This is exemplified by their ineffectiveness at repopulating young tissues after transplantation, as well as their inability to grow in culture even in the presence of growth factors and nutrients (López-Otín et al., 2013López-Otín C.

Stem cells and healthy aging.Science. 2015; 350: 1199-1204Google Scholar). Interestingly, much of this cell-intrinsic damage is a consequence of the predominant function each specific type of stem cell performs during homeostasis; for instance, aged interfollicular epidermal stem cells predominantly accumulate DNA damage due to their continual proliferation, whereas muscle stem cells (which almost never divide) have problems in biomass recycling through autophagy as well as in sensing damage (García-Prat et al., 2016García-Prat L.

In addition to the cell-intrinsic accumulation of stress in aged progenitors, other traits associated to aging occur in all tissues, such as increased inflammation and fibrosis, circadian rhythm reprogramming, and imbalances in oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism. This suggests that these traits arise from local and systemic signals established during organismal aging (Doles et al., 2012Doles J. Storer M. Cozzuto L. Roma G. Keyes W.M.

Regarding local signals, there is increasing evidence that stem cells continuously engage in a reciprocal communication with surrounding stromal cells (Driskell and Watt, 2015Driskell R.R. Watt F.M.

The progressive functional decay of stromal cells is believed to contribute significantly to the inability of tissues to sustain homeostasis and to properly respond to injury during aging. Nonetheless, whether and how stromal cells are altered during aging is unknown in most tissues (Kusumbe et al., 2016Kusumbe A.P. Ramasamy S.K. Itkin T. Mae M.A. Langen U.H. Betsholtz C. Lapidot T.

Zhang C. et al.Aging of the skeletal muscle extracellular matrix drives a stem cell fibrogenic conversion.Aging Cell. 2017; 16: 518-528Google Scholar). Stromal changes are particularly apparent in aged human and mouse dermis. These include decreased dermal thickness and ECM density, and reduced numbers of fibroblasts (Demaria et al., 2015Demaria M. Desprez P.Y. Campisi J. Velarde M.C. Cell autonomous and non-autonomous effects of senescent cells in the skin.J. Invest.

These dermal changes contribute to the cosmetic consequences of having reduced skin turgor and increased wrinkling and perhaps also contribute to the increased propensity of aged skin for infections, tumorigenesis, and inefficient wound healing (Driskell and Watt, 2015Driskell R.R. Watt F.M. Understanding fibroblast heterogeneity in the skin.Trends Cell Biol. 2015; 25: 92-99Google Scholar, Kaur et al., 2016Kaur A. Webster M.R. Marchbank K. Behera R. Ndoye A. Kugel C.H.

In the three-dimensional tissue stroma scaffold, fibroblasts play a major role in maintaining the extracellular matrix (ECM) and in heterotypic signaling with epithelial cells during steady-state and injury response. However, a detailed characterization of the cellular and molecular traits of old dermal fibroblasts is lacking. Thus, whether dermal aging is related to a loss of fibroblasts, to acquired alterations in the remaining old fibroblasts, or to both is not known. In order to study fibroblast aging, we purified dermal fibroblasts by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of cells double-positive for the PDGF receptor alpha (Pdgfrα+) and CD34+ from the dermis of young (2 months) and old (18 months) female mice. We determined by immunohistochemistry that the vast majority of fibroblastic dermal cells, but not the α-smooth muscle actin+ arrector pili muscle, were positive for both CD34 and Pdgfrα (Figures S1A and S1B). In addition, Pdgfrα+/CD34+ fibroblasts comprised about 90%–95% of the cells within the dermis, as was evident once pre-adipocytes (CD24+), epithelial cells (EpCAM+), melanocytes (CD117+), hematopoietic cells (CD45+), and endothelial cells (CD31+) were gated out of the single-cell preparations (Figures 1E and S2A). Thus, our purified cells account for the majority of fibroblasts that are embedded in murine dermis. After FACS purification, we compared old and young dermal fibroblasts by whole-transcriptome analysis (Figures 1E and 1F). The old mice had clear histological signs of dermal alterations, such as overall decreased thickness and density of the dermis but with a significantly increased thickness of the adipocyte-containing lower dermal layer (Figures 1A–1D). Interestingly, most of these changes were already visible in middle-aged mice (9-month-old; Figures 1A–1D).Figure S2FACS Plots of Skin Cells from Young and Old Mice and qPCR Validation of Differentially Expressed Genes Identified by Transcriptome Analysis, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) FACS strategy to isolate dermal fibroblasts.

(B) Verification of the differential expression of selected genes between young and old fibroblasts by quantitative PCR using three biological replicates. Error bars represent mean ± SD. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the transcriptome data indicated that young and old fibroblasts primarily clustered by age and that old fibroblasts expressed approximately 1,000 transcripts that differed from their young counterparts with a fold change of > 1.5 (FDR < 0.05) (Figure 1F, Table S1). Gene ontology (GO) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the data indicated that old fibroblasts had a strong reduction in the expression of the main extracellular matrix genes, including collagens and glycosaminogycans, and of genes involved in their secretion (i.e., Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and vesicle-mediated transport) (Figure 1G, Table S1). Concomitantly, old fibroblasts showed upregulation of genes involved in inflammation, innate immunity, the formation of stress fibers, and differentially expressed genes related to the establishment of cell contacts (Figures 1G, Table S1). Interestingly, they also had upregulation of a significant number of genes related to adipogenesis, lipid metabolism, and fat cell differentiation (Figure 1G, Table S1). These genes related to signaling downstream of master regulators of adipogenesis, such as PPARγ, VLDLR, and LDLR (Figure 2A; Table S1). Importantly, the genes defining each GO category clustered young and old samples in an unsupervised manner, strongly supporting their fundamental role in determining the traits associated with dermal fibroblast aging (Figures 1H, 2B–2D, and S3).Figure S3Unsupervised Clustering of Young and Old Fibroblast Samples Isolated from Female Mice Based on Gene Ontology Signatures, Related to Figure 1Show full captionClustering results are shown in a heatmap in which the intensity of the colors represents the expression intensity from blue (low expression) to red color (high expression).

By subjecting genes to repeated cycles of mutation and functional selection, the field of directed evolution has yielded extraordinary successes, including numerous industrial enzymes and therapeutic proteins, expanded genetic codes, and significant insights into how RNAs and proteins evolve (Davis et al., 2017Davis A.M.

However, existing approaches to directed evolution are difficult to scale: classical methods rely on onerous rounds of in vitro gene diversification followed by transformation into cells for expression and selection, and a pioneering phage-assisted continuous evolution system requires specialized setups and is largely incompatible with selections based on cellular phenotypes (Esvelt et al., 2011Esvelt K.M. Carlson J.C. Liu D.R. A system for the continuous directed evolution of biomolecules.Nature. 2011; 472: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). These shortcomings limit the routine evolution of novel biomolecular functions that require long mutational paths to access, the rapid evolution of enzymes and metabolic pathways that fully integrate with host systems, and the extensive parallelization of directed evolution experiments to discover multiple related functions or to map the scope of adaptive trajectories leading to important properties such as drug resistance. In principle, the most scalable and experimentally straightforward evolution systems are living cells, since populations of cells will continuously adapt when simply passaged under selective conditions. For example, microbial evolution experiments are routinely run in high-throughput (i.e., scores of replicate lines) to optimize strains, map adaptive landscapes, and understand evolutionary dynamics (Hegreness et al., 2008Hegreness M.

However, because genomic mutation rates are low, any single gene can only evolve slowly, making the basic passaging of cells a poor approach to the directed evolution of novel biomolecules or specific genes.

Furthermore, genome-wide mutagenesis allows adaptation to occur through mutations outside of user-defined genes, which defeats the purpose of most directed evolution experiments that aim to deliver a specific protein or enzyme with new function, and risks the fixation of trivial solutions (e.g., cheater mutations) that satisfy the selection conditions. We report OrthoRep, a highly error-prone orthogonal DNAP-DNA plasmid pair in yeast (Ravikumar et al., 2014Ravikumar A. Arrieta A. Liu C.C. An orthogonal DNA replication system in yeast.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that mutates user-defined genes at rates of ∼1 × 10−5 substitutions per base (s.p.b.) without increasing the genomic mutation rate (∼10−10 s.p.b.) at all. This ∼100,000-fold mutational acceleration enables the rapid, continuous evolution of genes entirely in vivo. We describe a substantial DNAP engineering effort that yielded highly error-prone orthogonal DNAP variants, show that OrthoRep stably replicates desired genes at error rates above the mutation-induced extinction threshold of the host genome (Herr et al., 2011Herr A.J. Ogawa M. Lawrence N.A. Williams L.N. Eggington J.M. Singh M. Smith R.A. Preston B.D.

By encoding Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (PfDHFR) (Wooden et al., 1997Wooden J.M. Hartwell L.H. Vasquez B. Sibley C.H.

Prevailing analyses of PfDHFR resistance focus on a single fitness peak observed widely in the field (Chusacultanachai et al., 2002Chusacultanachai S. Thiensathit P. Tarnchompoo B. Sirawaraporn W.

USA. 1997; 94: 1124-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), but our experiment reveals a more complex landscape including other genotypes of similar fitness. We find that a highly adaptive first-step mutation constrains path choice, leading to convergence, but also that rare mutations direct trajectories to alternative outcomes or a suboptimal fitness trap, illustrating the balance between fate and chance in drug resistance. By drastically scaling and simplifying directed evolution, OrthoRep should have widespread utility in the search for new biomolecular and cellular functions and the study of molecular adaptation. The basis of OrthoRep is a DNA polymerase (TP-DNAP1) that replicates a linear, high-copy, cytoplasmic DNA plasmid, p1, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Figure 1A; see Figure S1 for a full description of OrthoRep). Owing to the unique mechanism of p1 replication initiation via protein-priming and the spatial separation of p1 and TP-DNAP1 from nuclear DNA, engineered changes to TP-DNAP1’s properties should not affect the host genome. For example, we previously found that expression of TP-DNAP1 (Y427A) moderately increased the mutation rate of genes encoded on p1 to 3.5 × 10−8 s.p.b., while the endogenous mutation rate of genes in the genome (∼10−10 s.p.b.) remained unchanged (Ravikumar et al., 2014Ravikumar A.

ORFs with unknown function are indicated. TRF, Terminal Recognition Factor. In order to enable accelerated directed evolution experiments in small culture volumes amenable to high-throughput serial passaging, we drastically increased the mutation rate of p1 replication by engineering highly error-prone variants of TP-DNAP1. First, we sought to find a collection of single amino acid mutant TP-DNAP1s with elevated mutation rates. We anticipated that single amino acid changes would yield modest mutators that could then serve as a basis set for building TP-DNAP1s with multiple mutations that act together to reduce fidelity. Indeed, in a study of Escherichia coli Pol I, a combination of three moderately fidelity-reducing mutations in the exonuclease domain, active site, and O-helix resulted in an 80,000-fold increase in Pol I’s error rate (Camps et al., 2003Camps M. Naukkarinen J. Johnson B.P. Loeb L.A. Targeted gene evolution in Escherichia coli using a highly error-prone DNA polymerase I.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 9727-9732Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Initial attempts to populate the TP-DNAP1 basis set, based on homology analysis to related family B DNAPs, (Figure S2A; Table S1) mostly yielded low activity variants (Table S2), due to the idiosyncrasies of protein-priming DNAPs. Mutators identified from this effort (referred to below as Rd1 mutants) seeded our basis set, but we pursued a comprehensive approach to find high-activity variants suitable for combination. In the largest fidelity screen of a DNAP to date, ∼14,000 clones from a scanning saturation mutagenesis library of TP-DNAP1 were assayed for p1 replication activity and substitution mutation rate changes (see Figures S2 and S3, Table S3, and STAR Methods for details.) From this screen, we found 95 promising error-prone TP-DNAP1 candidates (Table S2). After measuring their mutation rates more accurately through large-scale fluctuation tests, we identified 41 unique variants (Rd2 mutants) with error rates up to ∼2 × 10−7 s.p.b. (Table S2). Unlike Rd1 mutants, Rd2 mutants retained high activity, and on average replicated p1 at only a 2-fold lower copy number than did wild-type (WT) TP-DNAP1. Only 9 of the Rd2 hits contained mutations at positions considered in the homology-based library design that generated Rd1 hits, indicating that fidelity determinants of TP-DNAP1 can lie outside of the most-conserved regions of DNAPs. Incidentally, we also discovered 210 TP-DNAP1 variants that replicated p1 at a higher copy number than did WT TP-DNAP1 (Table S4) and added the mutation from one of these variants to several low-activity mutator TP-DNAP1s to confirm the generality of the activity-boosting phenotype (Table S5). (These variants were not included in subsequent experiments here, but should prove useful in future TP-DNAP1 engineering efforts.) Rd2 hits were combined with Rd1 hits to form a 65-member basis set of mutations that moderately increase the error rate of TP-DNAP1 (Figure 1B). Using this basis set, we designed, cloned, and screened combinatorial libraries in order to find highly error-prone TP-DNAP1s. To limit combinatorial diversity in our designs, we grouped basis set mutations according to their proximity to DNAP motifs known to affect fidelity (i.e., the A and C motifs in the palm domain, the B motif in the fingers domain, and the Exo I, II, and III motifs in the exonuclease domain [Joyce and Steitz, 1994Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Function and structure relationships in DNA polymerases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar]) and cloned only inter-motif combinations. We expected that synergy between inter-motif mutations from different domains (e.g., motif A mutations with motif B mutations) would yield super-additive or super-multiplicative reductions in fidelity, as observed with RB69 DNAP and E. coli Pol I, respectively (Bebenek et al., 2001Bebenek A. Dressman H.K. Carver G.T. Ng S. Petrov V. Yang G. Konigsberg W.H. Karam J.D. Drake J.W. Interacting fidelity defects in the replicative DNA polymerase of bacteriophage RB69.J. Biol.

Targeted gene evolution in Escherichia coli using a highly error-prone DNA polymerase I.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 9727-9732Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We screened a library of motif B mutants crossed with motif A and C mutants and found 46 mutators (Table S2). The most error-prone of these 46 include three TP-DNAP1 variants (Rd3 mutants) with mutation rates of ∼1 × 10−6 s.p.b., representing an ∼400-fold increase over the WT TP-DNAP1 mutation rate and an ∼10,000-fold increase over the yeast genomic mutation rate. We then crossed these Rd3 mutants with all of the exonuclease domain mutants from our basis set. After screening the resulting library, we obtained four hits (Rd4 mutants), including two highly error-prone variants, TP-DNAP1-4-1 (V574F, I777K, L900S) and TP-DNAP1-4-2 (L477V, L640Y, I777K, W814N), that replicate p1 at mutation rates of ∼7 × 10−6 s.p.b. and ∼1 × 10−5 s.p.b., respectively, and that both sustain a p1 copy number of ∼5 (Figure 1C; Table S2). Additional rounds of library design and screening should reach even higher error rates, but these two Rd4 mutants are already exceptionally error-prone, so we ended our polymerase engineering effort at this point. As a practical guide, for facile generation of DNA libraries in vivo with TP-DNAP1-4-2, a 1-μL saturated yeast culture is theoretically sufficient for 1-fold coverage of all single mutants of a 1-kb gene and a 200-mL culture is sufficient for all double mutants. With mutational accumulation, highly diverse libraries can be generated in even smaller volumes: 1-fold coverage of all double mutants of a 1-kb gene can be achieved in a 650-μL culture with just 50 generations of propagation. We found that the high p1 mutation rates driven by error-prone TP-DNAP1s remained completely stable for the longest duration tested (90 generations; Table S2), and genomic mutation rates remain unchanged in the presence of p1 replication by the most error-prone TP-DNAP1, TP-DNAP1-4-2 (Figure 1C; Table 1). Therefore, OrthoRep can durably sustain in vivo mutagenesis with complete orthogonality (i.e., at least ∼100,000-fold mutational targeting) to enable continuous evolution experiments. A comparison of OrthoRep to other directed evolution systems is provided in Table S7 and is discussed below.Table 1Yeast Genomic Substitution Mutation Rates in the Presence of OrthoRepTP-DNAP1Mutation Rate (s.p.b.)Lower 95% CI (s.p.b.)Upper 95% C.I.

OrthoRep can access and sustain mutation rates that untargeted genome mutagenesis cannot. There is a theoretically predicted and empirically observed inverse relationship between the length of an information-encoding polymer, such as a gene or genome, and the tolerable error rate of replication (Biebricher and Eigen, 2006Biebricher C.K.

At sufficiently high mutation rates, essential genetic information is destroyed every generation, guaranteeing extinction, and even moderately elevated mutation rates can erode fitness (Herr et al., 2011Herr A.J.

Continuous directed evolution systems fundamentally work by targeting mutagenesis to desired genes in order to bypass the low error thresholds of large cellular genomes, but existing systems still elevate genome-wide mutation rates of cells or phages, falling short of a complete bypass (Badran and Liu, 2015Badran A.H.

Since OrthoRep is fully orthogonal to genomic replication, it achieves the complete bypass of genomic error thresholds for genes of interest, which should result in the ability to run in vivo continuous evolution for indefinitely large numbers of generation at mutation rates that are exclusively limited by the thresholds of user-selected genes. In order to demonstrate the limitations of genomic error thresholds on continuous evolution, we experimentally applied high mutation rates to the host genome. This was done by transplanting previously discovered mutations that increase the substitution mutation rate of POL3 (Herr et al., 2011Herr A.J. Ogawa M. Lawrence N.A. Williams L.N. Eggington J.M.

However, the supply of transplantable HHs is severely constrained by limited donor availability and compromised capacity for in vitro expansion. In response to chronic injury, some HHs are reprogrammed into proliferative cells that express both hepatocyte and progenitor markers, suggesting exploitable strategies for expanding HHs in vitro. Here, we report defined medium conditions that allow 10,000-fold expansion of HHs. These proliferating HHs are bi-phenotypic, partially retaining hepatic features while gaining expression of progenitor-associated genes. Importantly, these cells engraft into injured mouse liver at a level comparable to primary HHs, and they undergo maturation following transplantation in vivo or differentiation in vitro. Thus, this study provides a protocol that enables large-scale expansion of transplantable HHs, which could be further developed for modeling and treating human liver disease."

Here, we found that efficient biogenesis of β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) and other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) requires the conserved ER membrane protein complex (EMC). Reconstitution studies of β1AR biogenesis narrowed the EMC requirement to the co-translational insertion of the first transmembrane domain (TMD). Without EMC, a proportion of TMD1 inserted in an inverted orientation or failed altogether. Purified EMC and SRP receptor were sufficient for correctly oriented TMD1 insertion, while the Sec61 translocon was necessary for insertion of the next TMD. Enforcing TMD1 topology with an N-terminal signal peptide bypassed the EMC requirement for insertion in vitro and restored efficient biogenesis of multiple GPCRs in EMC-knockout cells. Thus, EMC inserts TMDs co-translationally and cooperates with the Sec61 translocon to ensure accurate topogenesis of many membrane proteins."

Human emotion arises from interactions between brain regions within the limbic system, which includes the amygdala, hippocampus, insula, and cingulate cortex (LeDoux, 2003LeDoux J.E. Emotion Circuits in the Brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 155-184Google Scholar, Phillips et al., 2003Phillips M.L. Drevets W.C. Rauch S.L. Lane R. Neurobiology of emotion perception I: The neural basis of normal emotion perception.Biol. Psychiatry. 2003; 54: 504-514Google Scholar). Much of what is known about emotion networks in the human brain comes from fMRI and positron emission tomography (PET) studies, in which specific emotions are provoked using controlled stimuli while neural responses are observed non-invasively (Phan et al., 2002Phan K.L.

These studies have shown, for example, that an insula-cingulate salience network is associated with affective experience (Seeley et al., 2007Seeley W.W. Menon V. Schatzberg A.F. Keller J. Glover G.H.

Neurosci. 2009; 3: 17Google Scholar). Importantly, PET imaging has identified changes in brain activity that are associated with antidepressant treatment response (Mayberg et al., 2000Mayberg H.S. Brannan S.K. Tekell J.L. Silva J.A. Mahurin R.K. McGinnis S. Jerabek P.A. Regional metabolic effects of fluoxetine in major depression: serial changes and relationship to clinical response.Biol. Psychiatry. 2000; 48: 830-843Google Scholar), leading to pioneering studies that have used deep brain stimulation to target specific structures to treat major depression (Mayberg et al., 2005Mayberg H.S. Lozano A.M. Voon V. McNeely H.E. Seminowicz D. Hamani C. Schwalb J.M. Kennedy S.H. Deep brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression.Neuron. 2005; 45: 651-660Google Scholar). Although these studies have revealed fundamental insights into the neural networks of emotion, they suffer from two major limitations. First, non-invasive imaging is restricted to short recording periods (1 to 2 hr) and often requires averaging across measurements to detect effects. As a result, these experiments cannot identify real-time neural correlates for slower changes in emotional state, such as changes in mood, that evolve over hours or days. Second, fMRI and PET are both indirect measures of neural activity with low temporal resolution on the order of seconds. As such, they cannot resolve sub-second oscillatory brain activity, which is thought to underlie information processing and cognitive function (Schnitzler and Gross, 2005Schnitzler A. Gross J. Normal and pathological oscillatory communication in the brain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 285-296Google Scholar). Thus, almost nothing is known about how rapid-timescale interactions between limbic brain regions contribute to changes in mood. To address these two questions, we took advantage of a unique dataset: multi-site, semi-chronic intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from the human limbic system, collected over several days as participants periodically rated their mood. These recordings were performed in patients with epilepsy for the primary clinical purpose of seizure localization and treatment. Given that the amygdala is a major hub in brain networks that support emotional processing (Phelps and LeDoux, 2005Phelps E.A. LeDoux J.E. Contributions of the amygdala to emotion processing: from animal models to human behavior.Neuron. 2005; 48: 175-187Google Scholar), we postulated that amygdala-containing subnetworks would also underlie mood variation. Subjects in our study were thus selected on the basis of amygdala electrode coverage in addition to three or more other limbic regions that are connected to the amygdala (Bickart et al., 2014Bickart K.C. Dickerson B.C. Barrett L.F. The amygdala as a hub in brain networks that support social life.Neuropsychologia. 2014; 63: 235-248Google Scholar). These included the hippocampus (ventral), cingulate cortex (inferior or superior), insular cortex, orbitofrontal cortex (anterior or posterior), and subtemporal cortex (anterior, middle, or posterior). However, not all subjects had electrode coverage in all of these regions because this was determined by clinical needs (Figure S1; Table S1). Because iEEG measures neural activity directly from the brain, these recordings offer the potential to detect fast oscillatory network interactions that correlate in real time with changes in mood. However, they also have an inherent complication: because the number of network interactions is much greater than the number of mood ratings from a subject, there is a risk of detecting spurious correlations. To overcome this risk, we first used pattern recognition techniques (unsupervised machine learning) to define subnetworks that represent dominant interactions across the brain regions defined above. We next used multivariate regression (supervised machine learning) to determine how activity within these subnetworks related to subjects’ mood ratings. Our study identifies a conserved subnetwork, driven by β-frequency (13–30 Hz) interactions between the amygdala (AMY) and hippocampus (HPC) that was present in 62% (13 of 21) of study subjects. Furthermore, when present, increased temporal variance of activity within this AMY-HPC β-frequency subnetwork consistently predicted worsening mood. To identify limbic subnetworks, we first obtained a more tractable, low-dimensional data representation of our iEEG recordings by identifying a small number of patterns that explain the variation in network activity over time. Specifically, we identified intrinsic coherence networks (ICNs) that correspond to groups of brain regions that exhibit statistically significant, correlated fluctuations in rhythmic activity across recording sites (Bowyer, 2016Bowyer S.M. Coherence a measure of the brain networks: past and present.Neuropsychiatric Electrophysiology. 2016; 2: 1Google Scholar). To identify ICNs, we first computed time series of coherence between all pairs of recording sites and in four frequency bands, which are thought to reflect distinct aspects of neural function and cognitive processing (Schnitzler and Gross, 2005Schnitzler A. Gross J. Normal and pathological oscillatory communication in the brain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 285-296Google Scholar): theta (θ, 4–8 Hz), alpha (α, 8–13 Hz), beta (β, 13–30 Hz), and gamma (γ, 30–70 Hz) (Figures 1A and 1B ). We then performed principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality and noise, followed by independent component analysis to derive statistically significant, independent components that capture the variation in coherence across the network over time (Lopes-dos-Santos et al., 2013Lopes-dos-Santos V. Ribeiro S. Tort A.B.L. Detecting cell assemblies in large neuronal populations.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2013; 220: 149-166Google Scholar). Each independent component defines an ICN (Figure 1C). To visualize ICNs, we constructed connectivity diagrams showing pairs of electrodes whose temporal variance exceeds a threshold (Figure 1D). On average, we found 10 ± 4 (mean ± SD) ICNs for each subject and frequency band, which explained 45% ± 10% (θ), 47% ± 10% (α), 67% ± 8% (β), or 77% ± 7% (γ) (mean ± SD) of the total variance in coherence over time (Figure 1E). Common ICN motifs that are present in many subjects are likely to reflect strong, biologically conserved connectivity and functionality. Subjects had heterogeneous electrode placement, driven by clinical needs for seizure localization (Figure S1; Table S1), precluding a direct, one-to-one comparison of ICNs across subjects. To overcome this constraint, we projected each ICN onto a “common network template” (Figure S2A; STAR Methods). We then constructed a similarity matrix based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (CC) between all pairs of common network-projected ICNs to determine the spatial similarity between each ICN pair (Figure S2B). We visualized ICN similarity graphically, where each node corresponds to an ICN, and edges connect ICNs whose similarity exceeds a threshold (CC > 0.55; Figure S2B). To identify the most common ICN motifs, we considered the subgraph composed only of “core nodes” that were connected to at least 7 other nodes; this step corresponded to excluding idiosyncratic ICNs and retained 37% of all ICNs (Figure S3A). These thresholds therefore winnowed the number of connections to yield a sparse graph that is suitable for analysis. The resulting topological graph of ICNs clustered into nine “cliques” (Figure 2A; Figure S3B). Importantly, we verified that this clique structure was largely preserved using different correlation and core node thresholds that maintained a similar proportion (∼40%) of ICNs (Figure S3C). Conversely, shuffling the similarity matrix completely eliminated cliques, confirming that the observed clique structure is non-random (Figure S3D).Figure S3Clique Structure Is Preserved for Different Threshold Values, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Fraction of “core ICNs” (#core ICNs/#all ICNs) over range of cross-correlation and core node connectivity thresholds.(B) Left: Proportion of ICNs per clique (#ICNs in clique x/#core ICNs, where x = 1–9) for topological ICN graph in Figure 2 (cross-correlation threshold = 0.55, core node connectivity threshold = 7, clique connectivity threshold = 5).

See also Figures S2 and S3. Individual cliques comprised ICNs from many frequency bands and subjects (Figure 2B; Figure S3E). The most common ICN motif was dominated by interactions between electrodes in the AMY and HPC (clique 1) and present in 62% (13 of 21) of subjects (Figure 2B). Other conserved motifs were characterized by AMY-HPC interactions with other brain regions, including the insula (cliques 2 and 3, 52% of subjects), inferior cingulate cortex (clique 4, 48% of subjects), and subtemporal cortex (clique 5, 48% of subjects). The dominance of ICNs involving AMY and HPC electrodes is likely introduced by uneven electrode coverage, which favors these mesolimbic regions (Figure S1). Nonetheless, these observations suggest that there exist common modes of functional connectivity that give rise to conserved ICN motifs that are shared across individuals. We hypothesized that mood-related patterns of activity should be major features of limbic system activity and, thus, be reflected in ICN dynamics. To measure subjects’ subjective mood state, we used a custom-designed questionnaire (Nahum et al., 2017Nahum M. Van Vleet T.M. Sohal V.S. Mirzabekov J.J. Rao V.R. Wallace D.L. Lee M.B. Dawes H. Stark-Inbar A. Jordan J.T. et al.Immediate Mood Scaler: Tracking Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety Using a Novel Mobile Mood Scale.JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2017; 5: e44Google Scholar; Posit Science, Immediate Mood Scaler [IMS]). This consisted of a series of self-report items (Table S2) based on and validated against the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Rumination scales (Treynor et al., 2003Treynor W. Gonzalez R. Nolen-Hoeksema S. Rumination Reconsidered: A Psychometric Analysis.Cognit. Ther. Res. 2003; 27: 247-259Google Scholar). The final IMS score was found by summing individual responses to provide a single score, with higher values corresponding to a more positive instantaneous mood (Figures S4A and S4B). Note that, although we refer to this as a measure of “mood,” it is more precisely a measure of “subjective well-being” that combines multiple aspects of mood and anxiety. This measure contrasts with scales such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) or Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), which are weighted toward longer-timescale symptoms and designed to measure enduring trait levels of depression or anxiety rather than moment-to-moment variations in mood state (Kabacoff et al., 1997Kabacoff R.I. Segal D.L. Hersen M. Van Hasselt V.B. Psychometric properties and diagnostic utility of the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory with older adult psychiatric outpatients.J. Anxiety Disord. 1997; 11: 33-47Google Scholar, Richter et al., 1998Richter P. Werner J. Heerlein A. Kraus A. Sauer H. On the validity of the Beck Depression Inventory. A review.Psychopathology. 1998; 31: 160-168Google Scholar). We then used a model-based regression analysis (described below) to determine which ICNs correlated with variations in IMS score. This initial analysis was limited to subjects with 10 or more IMS data points and an IMS coefficient of variation of more than 5% because the remaining subjects had insufficient IMS points or variation to fit a model (6 subjects total; Table S3). The primary goal of this analysis was not to identify individualized mood-subnetwork relationships specific for each subject but, rather, to look for emergent similarities in mood-predictive subnetworks across subjects. If we can identify conserved mood-predictive network(s) in this way, then we can then use cross-validation to test whether these generalize to a broader set of subjects. To obtain traces of ICN activity over time, we projected the time series of coherence matrices onto each ICN. These traces exhibited a sharply peaked temporal structure, suggestive of mostly low coherence interspersed with transient periods of high coherence (Figure 3A, blue traces). To capture this temporal structure, we computed the variance of ICN activity over time. For each individual subject, we then regressed the IMS scores against the average temporal variance of activity in the specific ICNs (i.e., ICNs discovered by principal component analysis [PCA] and independent component analysis [ICA] on that subjects’ dataset), using averaging windows (tave) that ranged between 5 and 30 min (in 5-min increments), centered on each IMS time point (tIMS). To mitigate the possibility of overfitting, we used an elastic net linear model (Zou and Hastie, 2005Zou H. Hastie T. Regularization and variable selection via the elastic net.J. R. Stat. Soc. Series B Stat. Methodol. 2005; 67: 301-320Google Scholar). This models IMS score based on a weighted sum of ICN variances and promotes sparsity by adding a penalty based on the sum of the weights, forcing weights for ICNs that are not correlated with IMS to zero. The best model parameters were selected for each subject using 3-fold cross-validation. We found that using a 20-min averaging window resulted in all 6 subjects having a non-zero R2 regression score; therefore, we chose this window for subsequent analysis. However, similar results could be obtained using a range of averaging windows, in particular for 15- and 25-min windows (Figure S4D), indicating that the model selection was robust to this temporal parameter. Across subjects, the average number of ICNs retained was 3.7 ± 2.4 (mean ± SD; Figure 3B; Table S3). In contrast, for models using mean ICN activity (rather than variance), the average number of ICNs retained was 8.2 ± 6.3 ICNs. This suggests that mean-based models are less sparse than variance-based ones and, hence, potentially more prone to overfitting. To further validate that we identified statistically meaningful relationships and not spurious ones, we used the elastic net approach to fit linear models for IMS based on randomly shuffled time series of ICN activity (100 for each subject). For each subject, models fit to true data consistently outperformed those fit to shuffled data from the same subject; i.e., models fit to true data retained fewer ICNs and had higher R2 (∗p < 0.005; Figure 3B). This confirms that the ability to predict the IMS score based on ICN activity is not simply due to the number of degrees of freedom; if it were, then models based on shuffled data would have performed as well as those based on true data. Although we constructed independent models for each subject, we observed a striking and highly improbable degree of convergence. Across subjects, the single most IMS-predictive ICN (i.e., the ICN with the highest absolute magnitude coefficient) was consistently dominated by an interaction between electrodes located in the AMY and HPC and almost always in the β-frequency band (apart from EC108, which was in the γ-band) (Figure 3C). Moreover, all of these ICNs clustered in the same clique in ICN topological space (Figure 2A, clique 1; nodes with thick borders represent the ICNs with highest coefficients). We estimated the probability that the most IMS-predictive ICN for these 6 subjects would converge in a single cluster (clique 1), with 5 of 6 of these in the same frequency band (β-band) to be 4 × 10−8 (STAR Methods). This highly significant degree of convergence indicates that the multivariate regression (performed independently for each subject) was not identifying spurious correlations driven by multiple comparisons (had this been the case, the ICNs identified by regression for each subject would more likely have been randomly distributed). Rather, the regression identified a mood-network relationship that was conserved across subjects. We next performed additional cross-validation of this relationship by determining whether it generalized to additional subjects who were not part of this initial elastic net analysis. Based on the convergence noted above, we hypothesized that activity in this characteristic ICN alone (the β-frequency ICN in clique 1), which we refer to as the “β-AH ICN,” should correlate with IMS score across subjects, not just for the 6 for whom we fit a model. We found β-frequency AMY-HPC (β-AH) ICNs belonging to clique 1 in 13 of 21 subjects (Figure 2B). For each of these subjects, we regressed the IMS score against the temporal variance of activity in their corresponding β-AH ICN over a 20-min window centered around each IMS time point. In every case, we observed a negative trend between IMS score and β-AH ICN activity (Figure 4), consistent with the negative coefficients derived from the elastic net. Importantly, we are not claiming that this relationship was statistically significant on an individual subject basis—this is clearly not the case because many subjects had an insufficient number of IMS ratings to yield a significant relationship. Rather, to definitively test for a conserved relationship between activity in this subnetwork and mood, we used cross-validation; i.e., we split our population into a training set and a distinct, out-of-sample test set (Figure 5A). For each of the 13 subjects who had the β-AH ICN, we quantified the conserved feature of this subnetwork: AMY-HPC β-coherence. We computed the time series of AMY-HPC β-coherence for each subject by averaging across all electrode pairs within these two structures. Similar to the temporal structure of ICN activity, AMY-HPC β-coherence showed sharp peaks in its temporal structure, which we again captured using variance over time.Figure 5Temporal Variance of AMY-HPC β-Coherence Predicts Mood across Subjects Who Share a β-AH NetworkShow full caption(A) Schematic of data partitioning into training and test datasets for IMS prediction based on variance of AMY-HPC β-coherence.

Methods for detecting single nucleic acids in cell and tissues, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), are limited by relatively low signal intensity and nonspecific probe binding. Here we present click-amplifying FISH (clampFISH), a method for fluorescence detection of nucleic acids that achieves high specificity and high-gain (>400-fold) signal amplification. ClampFISH probes form a 'C' configuration upon hybridization to the sequence of interest in a double helical manner. The ends of the probes are ligated together using bio-orthogonal click chemistry, effectively locking the probes around the target. Iterative rounds of hybridization and click amplify the fluorescence intensity. We show that clampFISH enables the detection of RNA species with low-magnification microscopy and in RNA-based flow cytometry. Additionally, we show that the modular design of clampFISH probes allows multiplexing of RNA and DNA detection, that the locking mechanism prevents probe detachment in expansion microscopy, and that clampFISH can be applied in tissue samples."

Here, we show that HSCs harbor an early, constitutively active innate immune block to lentiviral transduction that can be efficiently overcome by cyclosporine H (CsH). CsH potently enhances gene transfer and editing in human long-term repopulating HSCs by inhibiting interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), which potently restricts VSV glycoprotein-mediated vector entry. Importantly, individual variability in endogenous IFITM3 levels correlated with permissiveness of HSCs to lentiviral transduction, suggesting that CsH treatment will be useful for improving ex vivo gene therapy and standardizing HSC transduction across patients. Overall, our work unravels the involvement of innate pathogen recognition molecules in immune blocks to gene correction in primary human HSCs and highlights how these roadblocks can be overcome to develop innovative cell and gene therapies."

The regenerative ability and plasticity of adult skeletal muscle is largely due to its resident muscle satellite cells (Sambasivan and Tajbakhsh, 2015Sambasivan R. Tajbakhsh S. Adult skeletal muscle stem cells.Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2015; 56: 191-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In resting muscle, satellite cells are quiescent and express the paired-box transcriptional factor Pax7 (Seale et al., 2000Seale P. Sabourin L.A. Girgis-Gabardo A. Mansouri A. Gruss P. Rudnicki M.A. Pax7 is required for the specification of myogenic satellite cells.Cell. 2000; 102: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Following injury, they re-enter the cell cycle and proliferate to generate myoblasts that further differentiate and fuse to restore the damaged fiber, while a subpopulation of myogenic cells returns to quiescence for self-renewal of the satellite cell pool (Baghdadi and Tajbakhsh, 2018Baghdadi M.B. Tajbakhsh S. Regulation and phylogeny of skeletal muscle regeneration.Dev. Biol. 2018; 433: 200-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Notch is a crucial regulator of satellite cells as the satellite cell-specific depletion of RBPJ, the DNA binding factor essential for mediating canonical Notch signaling, leads to spontaneous differentiation and progressive loss of satellite cells (Mourikis et al., 2012bMourikis P. Sambasivan R. Castel D. Rocheteau P. Bizzarro V. Tajbakhsh S.

Notch activity antagonizes myogenesis by induction of transcriptional repressors (members of the HES and/or HEY family) (Mourikis et al., 2012bMourikis P. Sambasivan R. Castel D. Rocheteau P.

Notch signaling is necessary to maintain quiescence in adult muscle stem cells.Stem Cells. 2012; 30: 232-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), and we recently showed that Notch-induced production of Collagen V by satellite cells is a critical component of the quiescent niche, as its depletion leads to gradual diminution of the stem cell pool (Baghdadi et al., 2018Baghdadi M.B. Castel D. Machado L. Fukada S.I. Birk D.E. Relaix F. Tajbakhsh S. Mourikis P. Reciprocal signalling by Notch-Collagen V-CALCR retains muscle stem cells in their niche.Nature. 2018; 557: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether this pleiotropic signaling pathway maintains stem cells by controlling additional cellular processes other than differentiation and niche composition. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential for muscle homeostasis and regeneration upon injury as the conditional deletion of Dicer (an RNase III endonuclease required for maturation of miRNAs) in the PAX7+ population, results in a depletion of satellite cells and a quasi-absence of repair upon injury (Cheung et al., 2012Cheung T.H. Quach N.L. Charville G.W. Liu L. Park L. Edalati A. Yoo B. Hoang P. Rando T.A. Maintenance of muscle stem-cell quiescence by microRNA-489.Nature. 2012; 482: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Although numerous miRNAs were reported to regulate myoblast proliferation and differentiation (Kirby et al., 2015Kirby T.J. Chaillou T. McCarthy J.J. The role of microRNAs in skeletal muscle health and disease.Front Biosci (Landmark Ed). 2015; 20: 37-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), only miR-489 (Cheung et al., 2012Cheung T.H. Quach N.L. Charville G.W. Liu L. Park L. Edalati A. Yoo B. Hoang P. Rando T.A. Maintenance of muscle stem-cell quiescence by microRNA-489.Nature. 2012; 482: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) was shown to regulate satellite cell quiescence and/or self-renewal. We performed RNA sequencing on primary skeletal muscle cells (Castel et al., 2018Castel D. Baghdadi M.B. Mella S. Gayraud-Morel B. Marty V. Cavaillé J. Antoniewski C. Tajbakhsh S. Small-RNA sequencing identifies dynamic microRNA deregulation during skeletal muscle lineage progression.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and identified the quiescence specific miR-708 that is regulated by Notch signaling. We show that this micro-RNA plays a critical role in satellite cell maintenance and migration in the niche by targeting Tensin3 (Tns3) mRNA, which encodes a fibrillar adhesion protein that physically links integrins and the actin cytoskeleton (Qian et al., 2009Qian X. Li G. Vass W.C. Papageorge A. Walker R.C. Asnaghi L. Steinbach P.J. Tosato G. Hunter K. Lowy D.R. The Tensin-3 protein, including its SH2 domain, is phosphorylated by Src and contributes to tumorigenesis and metastasis.Cancer Cell. 2009; 16: 246-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, we identify a miR-708 that acts as a gatekeeper of quiescence by modulating muscle stem cell migration. To identify miRNAs that regulate cellular quiescence, we performed RNA deep sequencing on freshly isolated satellite cells (QSC), in vitro-activated satellite cells for 60 hr (ASC) and differentiated cells cultured for 7 days (DIFF) (Figure 1A; (Castel et al., 2018Castel D. Baghdadi M.B. Mella S. Gayraud-Morel B. Marty V. Cavaillé J. Antoniewski C. Tajbakhsh S. Small-RNA sequencing identifies dynamic microRNA deregulation during skeletal muscle lineage progression.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar)). We found that miR-708 was enriched in quiescent satellite cells (Figure 1A). Real-time qPCR analysis showed miR-708 expression to be significantly decreased in vivo in ASCs 5 days post-injury, and in freshly isolated myofibers compared to freshly isolated satellite cells (Figure S1A). Interestingly, miR-708 is a highly conserved mirtron (Ruby et al., 2007Ruby J.G. Jan C.H. Bartel D.P. Intronic microRNA precursors that bypass Drosha processing.Nature. 2007; 448: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar) encoded in the quiescence-specific gene Odz4/Tenm4 (Figure S1B). As is the case with other mirtrons, miR-708 does not have its own promoter; therefore, its expression depends on that of Odz4. Interestingly, Odz4 expression decreases in Notch-depleted myogenic progenitors in embryos (Pax3Cre/+; Rbpj−/−; Myod−/−)(Bröhl et al., 2012Bröhl D. Vasyutina E. Czajkowski M.T. Griger J. Rassek C. Rahn H.P. Purfürst B. Wende H. Birchmeier C. Colonization of the satellite cell niche by skeletal muscle progenitor cells depends on Notch signals.Dev. Cell. 2012; 23: 469-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) suggesting a potential link with Notch signaling. We confirmed this hypothesis by interrogating genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data in adult murine myoblasts (Castel et al., 2013Castel D. Mourikis P. Bartels S.J. Brinkman A.B. Tajbakhsh S. Stunnenberg H.G. Dynamic binding of RBPJ is determined by Notch signaling status.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 1059-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Notably, two NICD and RBPJ binding sites were identified as most proximal to the Odz4 locus (Figure 1B). The combination of histone modifications H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and the acetyltransferase p300 (Figure 1B), in addition to their ability to induce transcription upon Notch activation in cell-based luciferase assays (Figure 1C), indicates that these sequences are in bona fide enhancers. Using genetically modified mice for Notch ablation (Tg:Pax7-CT2; Rbpjflox [Mourikis et al., 2012bMourikis P. Sambasivan R. Castel D. Rocheteau P. Bizzarro V. Tajbakhsh S.

Maintenance of muscle stem-cell quiescence by microRNA-489.Nature. 2012; 482: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar]) and Odz4 tightly followed Notch activity. We confirmed their transcriptional responses in satellite cells isolated from Tg:Pax7-nGFP postnatal day 8 (P8) pups in which endogenous Notch activity gradually declines as cells transit from an upstream Pax7High to a committed Pax7Low state (Mourikis et al., 2012bMourikis P.

Taken together, these data demonstrate that RBPJ and NICD signaling regulates the expression of Odz4, and by consequence miR-708, in satellite cells in vivo by direct binding on distal transcriptional enhancers. To assess whether the sustained expression of miR-708 affects satellite cell behavior, we transfected freshly isolated satellite cells with a synthetic miR-708 molecule (Mimic-708; Figures S1F and S1G for validation, specificity) and scored for proliferation with 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU+) and differentiation (Myogenin+). Interestingly, miR-708 overexpression resulted in a delay in cell-cycle entry (24 hr) and proliferative capacity (48 hr) (Figure 1G), and a decrease in the number of MYOG+ cells compared to control at 72 hr and 4 days (Figure 1H). Taken together, these results show that miR-708 significantly impedes satellite cell proliferation and differentiation, properties reminiscent of activation of Notch signaling. In a complementary loss-of-function assay, we depleted miR-708 using short-interfering RNA (AntimiR-708, Figure S1H) in an ex vivo system where resident satellite cells on isolated myofibers exit quiescence, enter the myogenic program, and form clusters composed of proliferating (PAX7+/MYOD+/MYOG–), differentiated (PAX7–MYOG+) and self-renewed (PAX7+/MYOD–/MYOG–) cells (Zammit et al., 2004Zammit P.S. Golding J.P. Nagata Y. Hudon V. Partridge T.A. Beauchamp J.R. Muscle satellite cells adopt divergent fates: A mechanism for self-renewal?.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Targeting specifically miR-708-5p increased significantly the number of differentiated cells per fiber and reduced the number of proliferating/self-renewing cells (Figure 1I). A concern with experiments involving miR-708 manipulations is the putative effect on Odz4 expression, as germline deletion of this gene results in reduced numbers of myofibers and satellite cells (Ishii et al., 2015Ishii K. Suzuki N. Mabuchi Y. Ito N. Kikura N. Fukada S. Okano H. Takeda S. Akazawa C. Muscle satellite cell protein Teneurin-4 regulates differentiation during muscle regeneration.Stem Cells. 2015; 33: 3017-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, no miR-708 binding sites were noted in the 3′ UTR of Odz4, indicating that it is not a miR-708 target. Furthermore, Odz4 levels were not altered following miR-708 overexpression (Figure S1I). Finally, the induction of miR-708 in Odz4-deficient primary satellite cells (Figure S1J) rescued their precocious differentiation phenotype (Figure 1J). Thus, we conclude that, in this context, the anti-myogenic effect of miR-708 was not due to Odz4 function. To investigate the functional role of miR-708 in vivo, we synthesized a miR-708 antagonist (AntagomiR-708) with an antisense sequence to mature miR-708-5p, as well as control Scramble. Importantly, real-time qPCR analysis on different cell populations extracted from skeletal muscles, namely, endothelial cells, fibro-adipogenic progenitors, and resident and infiltrating macrophages revealed that only satellite cells expressed miR-708 (data not shown). We then labeled the majority of satellite cells with a tamoxifen-inducible membrane-GFP using Tg:Pax7-CreERT2; R26mTmG lineage-traced mice (CT2, CreERT2; ∼95% recombination efficiency, Figure S2A). Surprisingly, 10 days after injection (Figure 2A), isolated GFP+ cells from resting muscle showed a significant reduction in miR-708 and miR-489 levels, whereas miR-92 expression (activation enriched miRNA, Figure 1A) was strongly upregulated (Figure 2B). In addition, a significant decrease in Pax7 expression was noted, whereas expression of the activation (Myod) and differentiation (Myogenin) genes were strongly upregulated following AntagomiR-708 treatment (Figure 2C). Accordingly, in vivo immunostaining showed that 18% of mGFP+ cells lost PAX7 expression in mice that received AntagomiR-708 during this period (Figure 2D). We previously showed that compromised Notch signaling in vivo induces satellite cells to differentiate spontaneously without entering S-phase (Mourikis et al., 2012bMourikis P. Sambasivan R. Castel D. Rocheteau P. Bizzarro V. Tajbakhsh S. A critical requirement for notch signaling in maintenance of the quiescent skeletal muscle stem cell state.Stem Cells. 2012; 30: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). However, satellite cells lacking miR-708 incorporated bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) following activation (Figure 2E), indicating that miR-708 knockdown induces their entry into S-phase prior to differentiation. In addition, satellite cells isolated from AntagomiR-708-treated mice exhibited premature expression of Myogenin (Figure 2F) and consequently an increase in myotube formation as indicated by a higher fusion index (Figure 2G). Taken together, these results indicate that reduced miR-708 levels in satellite cells leads to spontaneous exit from quiescence, activation, and premature differentiation. Interestingly, long-term inhibition of miR-708 (28 days; Figure 2A) showed a 50% reduction in satellite cell numbers in vivo (Figures 2H and S2B). Furthermore, immunostaining with cleaved-caspase 3 showed no significant change in the number of apoptotic cells following AntagomiR-708 treatment (Figure S2C). In contrast, numerous GFP+ fibers were observed in resting muscle indicating that mGFP+ satellite cells spontaneously fused with pre-existing myofibers (Figure 2I). Taken together, these results demonstrate that miR-708 is necessary for maintaining satellite cell quiescence in vivo. Of note, transcript analysis of this residual population showed normal levels of miR-708 as well as quiescence and differentiation markers (Figure S2D) suggesting that they escaped AntagomiR-708 treatment. In the context of muscle damage, AntagomiR-708-treated mice displayed a slight delay in regeneration at 14 days post-injury (dpi) as indicated by smaller myofibers (Figure S2E); however, this delay was not prominent by 31 dpi (Figure S2F). In keeping with this finding, PAX7+ cells were observed at this stage, albeit at much reduced numbers, suggesting that they were escapers. Notably, the severe defect in self-renewal of AntagomiR-treated mice following injury and regeneration (Figures 2J, 2K, and S2G) indicates that miR-708 also regulates re-entry into quiescence. Suppression of miR-708 has been shown to promote invasion and metastasis of numerous cancer cells types by targeting different genes or pathways involved in the regulation of cell migration (Lin et al., 2015Lin K.T. Yeh Y.M. Chuang C.M. Yang S.Y. Chang J.W. Sun S.P. Wang Y.S. Chao K.C. Wang L.H. Glucocorticoids mediate induction of microRNA-708 to suppress ovarian cancer metastasis through targeting Rap1B.Nat.

During homeostasis, satellite cells are localized between the myofiber membrane and the basal lamina (Sambasivan and Tajbakhsh, 2015Sambasivan R. Tajbakhsh S.

Surprisingly, we observed abnormal localization of PAX7+ cells in the interstitial space in the TA muscle of AntagomiR-708-treated mice (Figure 3A) suggesting that loss of miR-708 perturbed the anchorage of satellite cells and resulted in their release from their niche. We confirmed this phenotype by overexpressing miR-708 in freshly isolated satellite cells combined with videomicroscopy (Figure 3B). In addition to the decrease in the number of dividing cells (Figure 1G), the migration distance and velocity of myogenic cells treated with miR-708 were strongly diminished (Figures 3C and 3D; see Video S1). Notably, miR-708 also altered the motility of Odz4-depleted satellite cells (Figure S3A) underscoring its specific involvement in this process. Taken together, these results show that miR-708 actively inhibits the migration and motility of satellite cells. https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/63ad6df7-eb3d-4045-9927-41645b359b32/mmc2.mp4Loading ...

Images were taken every 13min. Scale bar: 50 μm. Recently, intravital imaging showed that satellite cell properties can be monitored in vivo (Webster et al., 2016Webster M.T. Manor U.

Intravital imaging reveals ghost fibers as architectural units guiding myogenic progenitors during regeneration.Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 18: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To confirm the observed in vitro phenotype directly in muscle, we optimized live microscopy on freshly isolated mouse hind limb explants containing the Extensor digitorium longus (EDL) muscle from Scramble- or AntagomiR-treated mice using 2-photon microscopy. Intriguingly, over the 10- to 12-hr imaging period, no displacement was detected in control Scramble (n = 6 mice, ≥250 cells, Figure 3E). In contrast, miR-708 silencing in vivo resulted in 9% of satellite cells spontaneously exiting their niche and migrating an average distance of 8.7 ± 6.5 μm with an average velocity of 7.8 ± 4.4 nm/min during the assay period (Figures 3E and 3F; Videos S2, S3, S4, and S5). These experiments provide direct evidence for a role of miR-708 as an active repressor of satellite cell migration. https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/1ba8ac72-8178-4e19-8d32-1637e5019db2/mmc3.mp4Loading ...

See Video S4, Related to Figures 3E and 3F To identify miR-708 putative targets, we combined three target prediction algorithms (see Figure 3G) and identified 24 overlapping genes, among which 3 were highly expressed in activated compared to quiescent satellite cells (Liu et al., 2013Liu L. Cheung T.H. Charville G.W. Hurgo B.M. Leavitt T. Shih J. Brunet A. Rando T.A. Chromatin modifications as determinants of muscle stem cell quiescence and chronological aging.Cell Rep. 2013; 4: 189-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar): Tensin3 (Tns3), Dickkopf3 (Dkk3), and Syndecan-1 (Sdc1) (Figure S3B). Their relevance as potential targets was tested by transfection of HEK293 cells with a luciferase reporter vector containing the 3′ UTR of Tns3, Dkk3, or Sdc1 (Table S2). Notably, miR-708 repressed luciferase activity of both Dkk3 and Tns3, but not Sdc1 (Figure 3H). Interestingly, only Tns3 inhibition (Figure S3C) phenocopied the overexpression of miR-708 and significantly decreased cell migration (Figure 3I), whereas Dkk3 knockdown showed no overt cell motility phenotype (data not shown). Mutations in Tns3 miRNA-binding sites significantly decreased miR-708-mediated repression (Figure 3H), as confirmed by a Target Protector assay combined with videomicroscopy (Figure S3D). In keeping with these observations, overexpression of TNS3 in satellite cells was sufficient to rescue the inhibition of migration mitigated by mir-708 (Figure 3J; Video S6). In summary, these findings demonstrate that miR-708 exerts its repressive activity on cell migration primarily through Tns3. Finally, given that siTns3 also phenocopied miR-708 inhibition of differentiation (Figure S3E), we propose that miR-708 downregulation during satellite cell activation releases Tns3 repression to promote satellite cell migration and lineage progression. https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/95f011fd-8e51-4cda-ad03-f14a0dfd0686/mmc7.mp4Loading ...

Reduced Cell Migration in Prescence of mi-R-708 Is Rescued by Overexpression of TNS3, Related to Figure 3JCell trajectory of primary satellite cells overexpressing miR-708 (Mimic) only or both miR-708 and TNS3. Overexpression of TNS3 was sufficient to rescue the inhibition of migration mitigated by mir-708. Images were taken every 10 min for 20 hr. Tns3 is a member of focal adhesion (FA)-associated proteins that are important regulators of cell adhesion and migration (Blangy, 2017Blangy A. Tensins are versatile regulators of Rho GTPase signalling and cell adhesion.Biol. Cell. 2017; 109: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Tensin SH2 domain forms a complex with the tyrosine phosphorylated protein FAK allowing its phosphorylation and activation (Qian et al., 2009Qian X. Li G. Vass W.C. Papageorge A. Walker R.C. Asnaghi L. Steinbach P.J. Tosato G. Hunter K. Lowy D.R. The Tensin-3 protein, including its SH2 domain, is phosphorylated by Src and contributes to tumorigenesis and metastasis.Cancer Cell. 2009; 16: 246-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Figure 4A). Notably, miR-708 overexpression in myogenic cells showed a reduction in TNS3 protein levels (Figures 4B and S4A for antibody validation), whereas FAK phosphorylation (p-FAK) levels decreased (Figure 4B). The presence of miR-708 did not affect the ratio of ERK/p-ERK suggesting that p-FAK was inhibited at the local level, rather than by interference of upstream effectors of the migration pathway (Figures 4B and S4B). As observed with miR-708 gain of function, specific inhibition of Tns3 resulted in downregulation of p-FAK (Figure 4C). In contrast, the absence of miR-708 in primary satellite cells (AntagomiR) resulted in increased levels of TNS3 and p-FAK (Figures 4D and S4C). This decrease in p-FAK was verified by immunostaining satellite cells transfected with either Mimic-708 or siTns3 (Figures 4E and 4E′). Notably, temporal in vivo activation showed a rapid increase in Tns3 expression within 3 hr following injury (Figure S4D) and appearance of TNS3 preceded that of MYOD and cell-cycle entry (Figure S4E) indicating that release of cell migration is an early event during satellite cell activation. We note that miR-708 overexpression resulted in a delay in cell proliferation of cultured satellite cells (Figure 1G); however, analysis of miR-708 putative targets did not identify cell-cycle regulators. Thus, we propose that the inhibition of migration indirectly inhibits cell-cycle progression. To uncouple proliferation and migration properties, we induced miR-708 in cycling satellite cells isolated from Fucci-Green mice (Fluorescence ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator), which allows temporal patterns of cell-cycle dynamics using Azami green to label S-G2-M phases (Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008Sakaue-Sawano A. Kurokawa H. Morimura T. Hanyu A. Hama H. Osawa H. Kashiwagi S. Fukami K. Miyata T.

Intriguingly, total duration of cell cycle was extended by 25% following miR-708 overexpression (Figure 4F; Video S7), and this was due to a significant extension of G1 (Figures 4G and 4H). These findings indicate that miR-708 exerts cell cycle regulation by modulating the G1 phase of the cell cycle. https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/8af11a83-9d0f-4e18-b075-a8caec177a1b/mmc8.mp4Loading ...

https://openalex.org/W2900144760,"Epithelial-neuronal signaling is essential for sensory encoding in touch, itch, and nociception; however, little is known about the release mechanisms and neurotransmitter receptors through which skin cells govern neuronal excitability. Merkel cells are mechanosensory epidermal cells that have long been proposed to activate neuronal afferents through chemical synaptic transmission. We employed a set of classical criteria for chemical neurotransmission as a framework to test this hypothesis. RNA sequencing of adult mouse Merkel cells demonstrated that they express presynaptic molecules and biosynthetic machinery for adrenergic transmission. Moreover, live-cell imaging directly demonstrated that Merkel cells mediate activity- and VMAT-dependent release of fluorescent catecholamine neurotransmitter analogs. Touch-evoked firing in Merkel-cell afferents was inhibited either by pre-synaptic silencing of SNARE-mediated vesicle release from Merkel cells or by neuronal deletion of β2-adrenergic receptors. Together, these results identify both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms through which Merkel cells excite mechanosensory afferents to encode gentle touch. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2900102681,"Fibroblasts are an essential cellular and structural component of our organs. Despite several advances, the critical behaviors that fibroblasts utilize to maintain their homeostasis in vivo have remained unclear. Here, by tracking the same skin fibroblasts in live mice, we show that fibroblast position is stable over time and that this stability is maintained despite the loss of neighboring fibroblasts. In contrast, fibroblast membranes are dynamic during homeostasis and extend to fill the space of lost neighboring fibroblasts in a Rac1-dependent manner. Positional stability is sustained during aging despite a progressive accumulation of gaps in fibroblast nuclei organization, while membrane occupancy continues to be maintained. This work defines positional stability and cell occupancy as key principles of skin fibroblast homeostasis in vivo, throughout the lifespan of mice, and identifies membrane extension in the absence of migration as the core cellular mechanism to carry out these principles."
https://openalex.org/W2901448493,"Dementia has become a global critical issue. It is estimated that the global cost of dementia was 818 billion USD in 2015. The situation in Japan, which is the most aged country in the world, should be critical. However, the societal cost of dementia in Japan has not yet been estimated. This study was designed to estimate cost of dementia from societal perspective.We estimated the cost from societal perspective with prevalence based approach.Main data sources for the parameters to estimate the costs are the National Data Base, a nationwide representative individual-level database for healthcare utilization, the Survey of Long-Term Care Benefit Expenditures, a nationwide survey based on individual-level secondary data for formal long-term care utilization, and the results of an informal care time survey for informal care cost. We conducted the analyses with 'probabilistic modeling' using the parameters obtained to estimate the costs of dementia. We also projected future costs.The societal costs of dementia in Japan in 2014 were estimated at JPY 14.5 trillion (se 66.0 billion). Of these, the costs for healthcare, long-term care, and informal care are JPY 1.91 trillion (se 4.91 billion), JPY 6.44 trillion (se 63.2 billion), and JPY 6.16 trillion (se 12.5 billion) respectively. The cost per person with dementia appeared to be JPY5.95 million (se 27 thousand). The total costs would reach JPY 24.3 trillion by 2060, which is 1.6 times higher than that in 2014.The societal cost of dementia in Japan appeared to be considerable. Interventions to mitigate this impact should be considered."

Uncovering the relationship between the connectivity and function of cortical neurons is fundamental to understanding the circuit mechanisms of information processing. While a neuron’s receptive field, determined by the pattern of inputs it receives, defines a set of stimulus features that drive it to fire, its local and long-range axonal projections define its impact on other neurons. Recent work has begun to uncover the rules by which the receptive fields of excitatory neurons constrain their local connectivity. In layer 2/3, pyramidal neurons preferentially connect to neurons that receive common synaptic input (Morgenstern et al., 2016Morgenstern N.A. Bourg J. Petreanu L.

However, little is known about how neurons’ long-range projection targets relate to their local connectivity and functional properties. Paired recordings of layer-5 pyramidal neurons indicate that connectivity between different projection classes is asymmetric (Brown and Hestrin, 2009Brown S.P. Hestrin S.

Highly differentiated projection-specific cortical subnetworks.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 10380-10391Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The large pyramidal-tract-type neurons in layer 5, such as corticospinal cells in motor cortex and corticocollicular cells in visual cortex, receive more input than they provide to intratelencephalic (IT) projection neurons (e.g., corticostriatal or corticocortical cells), suggesting that they integrate local input before broadcasting information to subcerebral motor-related structures. Whether similar rules govern the local connections of projection neurons targeting different cortical areas is not known. Signals from primary sensory areas of the neocortex are distributed to downstream areas that work in parallel to deconstruct the sensory scene. Cortical projection neurons innervating different areas may already specialize in encoding different attributes of sensory input (Chen et al., 2013Chen J.L. Carta S. Soldado-Magraner J.

Kampa B.M. Distinct functional properties of primary and posteromedial visual area of mouse neocortex.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 9716-9726Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Among these, the anterolateral visual area (AL) specializes in processing fast-moving, low-spatial-frequency stimuli, while the posteromedial visual area (PM) responds primarily to high spatial frequencies. The axonal boutons of V1 neurons in these areas share these biases (Glickfeld et al., 2013Glickfeld L.L. Andermann M.L. Bonin V. Reid R.C. Cortico-cortical projections in mouse visual cortex are functionally target specific.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, Matsui and Ohki, 2013Matsui T. Ohki K. Target dependence of orientation and direction selectivity of corticocortical projection neurons in the mouse V1.Front. Neural Circuits. 2013; 7: 143Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To understand how the long-range targets of V1 neurons that comprise these projections relate to their local connectivity, we measured the connection rates between neurons projecting to areas AL and PM using multiple whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. These recordings reveal that layer 2/3 neurons tend to make connections with cells projecting to the same long-range target, while connections between cells projecting to different areas are rare. These observations show that the long-range projection target of corticocortical neurons may constrain their potential local synaptic partners. We have previously observed that local connectivity of pyramidal neurons in mouse V1 is correlated with their selectivity for visual stimuli (Cossell et al., 2015Cossell L. Iacaruso M.F. Muir D.R. Houlton R. Sader E.N. Ko H. Hofer S.B. Mrsic-Flogel T.D.

Buchanan K.A. Sjöström P.J. Mrsic-Flogel T.D. Functional specificity of local synaptic connections in neocortical networks.Nature. 2011; 473: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). To examine how the specific connectivity of AL and PM projection neurons relates to their visual response properties, we recorded the activity of these cell populations simultaneously in awake mice using two-photon calcium imaging. Although they differed in their speed tuning and direction selectivity, both populations were highly heterogeneous in their visual responses. The activity patterns of cell pairs projecting to the same area tended to be more similar than of those projecting to different ones. However, these differences were not sufficient to explain the segregated connectivity of these populations, suggesting that other mechanisms play a role in preventing crosstalk between different projection neuron populations. To what extent do V1 projections to areas AL and PM originate from distinct populations of neurons? To answer this question, we injected the tracer choleratoxin B or retrograde pseudorabies virus (PRV) (Oyibo et al., 2014Oyibo H.K. Znamenskiy P. Oviedo H.V. Enquist L.W. Zador A.M. Long-term Cre-mediated retrograde tagging of neurons using a novel recombinant pseudorabies virus.Front. Neuroanat. 2014; 8: 86Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) into these areas (Figure S1), identified using intrinsic signal imaging, and examined the distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons in V1 (Figures 1A–1D; 80 slices from 5 mice). Cells labeled with both tracers, and therefore projecting to both higher visual areas, were rare (Figures 1C and 1D; 4,612 PM-only projection neurons, 2,664 AL-only projection neurons, and 127 AL and PM projection neurons; Figure S2), consistent with recent single-cell tracing experiments (Han et al., 2018Han Y. Kebschull J.M. Campbell R.A.A. Cowan D. Imhof F. Zador A.M. Mrsic-Flogel T.D. The logic of single-cell projections from visual cortex.Nature. 2018; 556: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Therefore, AL- and PM-projecting neurons in V1 comprise intermingled, largely non-overlapping populations. Excitatory neurons in layer 2/3 form synaptic connections with only a small fraction of nearby neurons that share their visual preferences (Cossell et al., 2015Cossell L. Iacaruso M.F. Muir D.R. Houlton R. Sader E.N. Ko H. Hofer S.B. Mrsic-Flogel T.D.

To understand if the projection target of layer 2/3 neurons in V1 further constrains their local connectivity, we measured the connection rates between different populations of corticocortical projection neurons in layer 2/3. After functionally mapping V1 and surrounding cortical areas using intrinsic signal imaging (see STAR Methods), we injected the fluorescent retrograde tracer cholera toxin B (CTB) conjugated with AlexaFluor-488 and AlexaFluor-594 into areas AL and PM (Figure 1E; see STAR Methods). After allowing at least 3 days for the retrograde transport of the tracers, we assessed the connectivity of retrogradely labeled AL and PM projection neurons in layer 2/3 of V1. We targeted up to six neurons for simultaneous whole-cell patch-clamp recording in acute slices (Figures 1F and 1G) to access their synaptic connectivity, strength, and intrinsic membrane properties (Cossell et al., 2015Cossell L.

However, AL projection neurons were less likely to provide input to PM projection neurons than to other AL projection neurons (Figure 1H, p=0.0002, Fisher’s exact test). Similarly, connections from PM to AL projection neurons were less common than between PM projecting cells (Figure 1H, p=0.01, Fisher’s exact test). There was no significant difference in distances between the somata of AL-AL and AL-PM pairs (Figure 1J, median 69.5 μm and 64.0 μm, respectively, p=0.66). AL-PM pairs tended to be further apart than PM-PM pairs as measured by their absolute distance (median 64 μm and 48 μm, p=0.024) as well as laminar separation (Figure 1L, median 32 μm and 18 μm, p=0.003). We used logistic regression to determine whether the rate of connections between neurons in our dataset was influenced by their spatial separation and whether or not they projected to the same target (STAR Methods). Euclidean (p=0.75), cortical plane (p=0.66), and interlaminar distance (p=0.73) were not significantly related to connection probability, while the effect of projection target persisted when controlling for these parameters (p=0.0002). In fact, none of the 44 AL-PM pairs in our sample closer than 48 μm, the median separation of PM-PM pairs, were connected. This analysis confirms that cell-type identity and not cell separation contributes to the low rate of connections between AL and PM projection neurons. The difference in connection frequency between cells projecting to the same and different targets could result from either preferential connectivity between the former or reduced connectivity between the latter. To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared the rates of connectivity between AL and PM projection neurons to the previously reported connectivity rate for pyramidal cells recorded under similar conditions with no knowledge of their projection target (75/520 pairs; Cossell et al., 2015Cossell L. Iacaruso M.F. Muir D.R. Houlton R. Sader E.N. Ko H. Hofer S.B. Mrsic-Flogel T.D. Functional organization of excitatory synaptic strength in primary visual cortex.Nature. 2015; 518: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Connections from AL to PM projection neurons and from PM to AL projection neurons were under-represented (p=0.0044, and p=0.0137 respectively, Fisher’s exact test) compared to randomly sampled neurons. On the other hand, connectivity rates between pairs projecting to the same target were not significantly different from the reference rate (p=0.055 for AL-AL pairs, p=0.48 for PM-PM pairs, Fisher’s exact test). This analysis suggests that the differences in connectivity rates we observed between different populations of projection neurons are the result of an exclusion rule that decreases the probability of connections between neurons projecting to different targets and not a result of increased connectivity between pairs projecting to the same target. The amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials between connected PM projection neurons was similar to that of AL projection neuron pairs (p=0.10, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Figure 1I). Due to the rarity of connections between AL and PM projection neurons, no conclusion could be made about their connection strength. Finally, we found no statistical difference in intrinsic membrane properties of AL and PM projection neurons in L2/3 (Figure S3) or short-term plasticity (paired pulse ratios) of postsynaptic responses of AL and PM neurons (30 Hz, 5 ms pulse stimulation; AL to AL, 0.92±0.39, n = 26; PM to PM, 0.92±0.61, n = 11; AL to PM, 1.05±0.22, n = 3; PM to AL, 0.94±0.19, n = 4; means ± standard deviations). These values are comparable to findings reported previously (Maravall et al., 2004Maravall M. Stern E.A. Svoboda K.

In summary, AL and PM projection neurons in V1 have similar biophysical properties but differ in their patterns of local connectivity. They form restricted subnetworks with little synaptic crosstalk, preferentially making synaptic connections with neurons projecting to the same target. How do the mutually exclusive subnetworks of AL and PM projection neurons differ in their responses to visual stimuli? To answer this question, we simultaneously imaged the activity of these cell populations in awake mice passively viewing grating stimuli. After identifying areas AL and PM using intrinsic signal imaging, we used PRV-Cre (Oyibo et al., 2014Oyibo H.K. Znamenskiy P. Oviedo H.V. Enquist L.W. Zador A.M. Long-term Cre-mediated retrograde tagging of neurons using a novel recombinant pseudorabies virus.Front. Neuroanat. 2014; 8: 86Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and CTB conjugated with AlexaFluor-647 to back-label V1 neurons projecting to these areas (Figures 2A and 2B ). Meanwhile, we expressed GCaMP6f broadly in V1 neurons. We then imaged brain volumes spanning 320–420 μm across and 80 μm in depth 100–300 μm below cortical surface while tracking animals running behavior and eye movements (Figure S4). To characterize the selectivity of AL and PM projection neurons for different attributes of visual input, we varied the spatial and temporal frequency (SF and TF) of the grating stimuli over 6 octaves (Figure 2C). Neurons in both subpopulations were highly heterogeneous and spanned the full range of spatial and temporal frequency preference and direction selectivity (Figure 2D; 235 PM cells from 22 sessions in 9 mice; 320 AL cells from 22 sessions in 8 mice). However, they were quantitatively different in several respects. First, PM projection neurons tended to prefer high-spatial-frequency stimuli (Figures 2E and 2G, p=0.025, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), while AL projection neurons preferred high-temporal-frequency (p=0.0064) and high-speed stimuli (Figures 2F and 2H–2I, p=6×10−5). In addition, reminiscent of MT projection neurons in macaque area V1 (Movshon and Newsome, 1996Movshon J.A. Newsome W.T. Visual response properties of striate cortical neurons projecting to area MT in macaque monkeys.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7733-7741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cells targeting area AL tended to be more sensitive to the direction of motion (Figure 2J, p=1.7×10−5). While the direction of these effects is consistent with previously reported visual response properties of axonal boutons of V1 neurons in areas AL and PM (Glickfeld et al., 2013Glickfeld L.L. Andermann M.L. Bonin V. Reid R.C. Cortico-cortical projections in mouse visual cortex are functionally target specific.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, Matsui and Ohki, 2013Matsui T. Ohki K. Target dependence of orientation and direction selectivity of corticocortical projection neurons in the mouse V1.Front. Neural Circuits. 2013; 7: 143Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the distributions of response properties of individual AL and PM projection neurons overlapped extensively. This overlap was independent of the cell inclusion criteria and persisted if the analysis was restricted to the most responsive subset of both populations (Figure S5). Spatial and temporal frequency preference is weakly topographically organized in mouse V1 (Ji et al., 2015Ji W. Gămănuţ R. Bista P. D’Souza R.D. Wang Q. Burkhalter A. Modularity in the organization of mouse primary visual cortex.Neuron. 2015; 87: 632-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Differences in topographic location between imaging sessions could serve as a potential source of heterogeneity of AL and PM projection neuron responses and obscure differences between them. On the other hand, the biases in tuning of AL and PM projection neurons could arise as a consequence of differences in the density of these populations across V1. To determine how variation in imaging location influenced our estimates of selectivity of these populations, we subtracted the median preferred SF, TF, speed, and DSI of unlabeled neurons in each recording from our estimates of these parameters for projection neurons (Figures S6A–S6D). Compared to the median of the local population, AL projection neurons had significantly higher DSI (p=0.000004, sign-rank test), while PM projection neurons had higher preferred spatial frequency (p=0.0002, sign-rank test) and lower preferred speed (p=0.03, sign-rank test). After correcting for local biases in tuning, AL projection neurons preferred lower spatial frequencies (p=0.0007, rank-sum test) and higher speeds (p=0.003, rank-sum test) than PM projection neurons. The distributions of response properties of individual AL and PM projection neurons still overlapped extensively after correcting for local population biases, showing that variation of imaging location does not contribute to their apparent heterogeneity. The analysis above used parametric fits of direction and temporal and spatial frequency preference, assuming that tuning for spatial and temporal frequency and direction are independent and the response of the cell is proportional to the product of direction, SF, and TF tuning. If this assumption were incorrect, it could skew the estimates of stimulus preference. An alternative, non-parametric analysis generated similar estimates of SF, TF, and direction tuning of projection neurons (Figure S7, see STAR Methods), confirming the overlap in their visual selectivity. Behavioral state modulates the responses of neurons in mouse V1 (Niell and Stryker, 2010Niell C.M. Stryker M.P. Modulation of visual responses by behavioral state in mouse visual cortex.Neuron. 2010; 65: 472-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). To determine whether AL and PM projection neurons are differentially modulated by behavioral parameters, we examined the relationship of their responses with running speed and pupil diameter (Figure 2K). Since running speed and pupil diameter are themselves correlated with each other, to disambiguate their effects, we calculated the partial correlation of single-cell responses with each of these two parameters while controlling for the other. Responses of AL projection neurons were more strongly correlated with both pupil diameter and running speed (Figures 2L and 2M). However, just as for visual selectivity, the correlation distributions of individual AL and PM projection neurons were broad and heavily overlapping. In summary, while there are significant biases in tuning of AL and PM projection neurons, with AL projection cells preferring fast-moving stimuli and PM neurons responding to high-spatial-frequency stimuli, both populations span the full range of stimulus selectivity of V1 neurons. In layer 2/3 of mouse V1, pyramidal neurons that show correlated responses to visual stimuli are more likely to connect to each other (Cossell et al., 2015Cossell L. Iacaruso M.F. Muir D.R. Houlton R. Sader E.N. Ko H. Hofer S.B. Mrsic-Flogel T.D.

Buchanan K.A. Sjöström P.J. Mrsic-Flogel T.D. Functional specificity of local synaptic connections in neocortical networks.Nature. 2011; 473: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Could the similarity of responses of cell pairs projecting to the same long-range target explain the exclusive local connectivity of AL and PM projection neurons? Simultaneous recordings of AL and PM projection neurons allowed us to directly test this hypothesis. We first compared the overall similarity of activity patterns by calculating Pearson’s correlation coefficient of fluorescence traces between pairs of cells (Figure 3A). Across the population, correlations decayed with separation between cell pairs (Figure 3B) (Lur et al., 2016Lur G. Vinck M.A. Tang L. Cardin J.A. Higley M.J. Projection-specific visual feature encoding by layer 5 cortical subnetworks.Cell Rep. 2016; 14: 2538-2545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, Ringach et al., 2016Ringach D.L.

Commun. 2016; 7: 12270Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Correlations of cell pairs projecting to the same long-range target showed the same pattern as unlabeled neurons. On the other hand, pairs of cells projecting different long-range targets were less correlated than either unlabeled cell pairs or pairs projecting to the same target. These results parallel the relative absence of local connections between AL and PM projection neurons observed in vitro (Figure"
https://openalex.org/W2901233057,"Islet transplantation is an established clinical procedure for select patients with type 1 diabetes and severe hypoglycemia to stabilize glycemic control. Post-transplant, substantial beta cell mass is lost, necessitating multiple donors to maintain euglycemia. A potential strategy to augment islet engraftment is the co-transplantation of islets with multipotent mesenchymal stem cells to capitalize upon their pro-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. Herein, we examine the in vitro and in vivo effect of co-culturing murine islets with human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs). Islets co-cultured with Ad-MSCs for 48 hours had decreased cell death, superior viability as measured by membrane integrity, improved glucose stimulated insulin secretion and reduced apoptosis compared to control islets. These observations were recapitulated with human islets, albeit tested in a limited capacity. Recipients of marginal mouse islet mass grafts, co-transplanted with Ad-MSCs without a co-culture period, did not reverse to normoglycemia as efficiently as islets alone. However, utilizing a 48-hour co-culture period, marginal mouse islets grafts with Ad-MSCs achieved a superior percent euglycemia rate when compared to islets cultured and transplanted alone. A co-culture period of human islets with human Ad-MSCs may have a clinical benefit improving engraftment outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2901322082,"Background The World Health Organization has recommended the introduction of HPV vaccines into national immunization programme (NIP), but vaccination coverage remains low worldwide. We assessed the coverage and the parental acceptance of female and male HPV vaccination in Brazil after its introduction into the NIP. Methods We conducted a random-digit-dial survey of parents in seven major Brazilian cities from July-2015 to October-2016. A knowledge, attitude and practices questionnaire was developed and validated by expert analysis, semantic analysis, and pre-testing. Results 826 out of 2,324 (35.5%) eligible parents completed the interview. Parental acceptance of the HPV vaccine for daughters and sons 18 years of age or less was high (92% and 86%, respectively). Parents refusing vaccination were less likely to know that: HPV is sexually transmitted and causes genital warts, HPV vaccination is more beneficial before sexual debut, and HPV vaccine reactions are minor, and they were more likely to believe HPV vaccination can cause severe adverse events. Parents accepting HPV vaccine for daughters but not forsons were more likely to ignore that the vaccine is recommended for boys. Attitudes associated with HPV vaccine acceptance included: general belief in vaccines, trust in the NIP and in the HPV vaccine efficacy. Among girls eligible for HPV vaccination through the NIP, 58.4% had received a two-dose scheme and 71.1% at least one dose. “No vaccination/missed vaccination at school” was the most common reason for missed HPV vaccination in theNIP. Conclusions One year after introduction in the NIP, most parents surveyed in Brazil accepted HPV vaccination for their daughters and sons. Low coverage in the NIP seemed to be due to challenges in adolescent vaccine delivery and HPV vaccination barriers at health-care centers, rather than to vaccine refusal."
https://openalex.org/W2899613162,"Type IV pili (T4P) are bacterial appendages composed of protein subunits, called pilins, noncovalently assembled into helical fibers. T4P are essential, in many bacterial species, for processes as diverse as twitching motility, natural competence, biofilm or microcolony formation, and host cell adhesion. The genes encoding type IV pili are found universally in the Gram-negative, aerobic, nonflagellated, and pathogenic coccobacillus Acinetobacter baumannii, but there is considerable variation in PilA, the major protein subunit, both in amino acid sequence and in glycosylation patterns. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of PilA from AB5075, a recently characterized, highly virulent isolate, at 1.9 A resolution and compare it to homologues from A. baumannii strains ACICU and BIDMC57, which are C-terminally glycosylated. These structural comparisons revealed that PilAAB5075 exhibits a distinctly electronegative surface chemistry. To understand the functional consequences of this change in surface electrostatics, we complemented a ΔpilA knockout strain with divergent pilA genes from ACICU, BIDMC57, and AB5075. The resulting transgenic strains showed differential twitching motility and biofilm formation while maintaining the ability to adhere to epithelial cells. PilAAB5075 and PilAACICU, although structurally similar, promote different characteristics, favoring twitching motility and biofilm formation, respectively. These results support a model in which differences in pilus electrostatics affect the equilibrium of microcolony formation, which in turn alters the balance between motility and biofilm formation in Acinetobacter."
https://openalex.org/W2900524154,"European forests have a long record of management. However, the diversity of the current forest management across nations, tree species and owners, is hardly understood. Often when trying to simulate future forest resources under alternative futures, simply the yield table style of harvesting is applied. It is now crucially important to come to grips with actual forest management, now that demand for wood is increasing and the EU Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry Regulation has been adopted requiring 'continuation of current management practices' as a baseline to set the Forest Reference Level carbon sink.Based on a large dataset of 714,000 re-measured trees in National Forest inventories from 13 regions, we are now able to analyse actual forest harvesting.From this large set of repeated tree measurements we can conclude that there is no such thing as yield table harvesting in Europe. We found general trends of increasing harvest probability with higher productivity of the region and the species, but with important deviations related to local conditions like site accessibility, state of the forest resource (like age), specific subsidies, importance of other forest services, and ownership of the forest. As a result, we find a huge diversity in harvest regimes. Over the time period covered in our inventories, the average harvest probability over all regions was 2.4% yr-1 (in number of trees) and the mortality probability was 0.4% yr-1. Our study provides underlying and most actual data that can serve as a basis for quantifying 'continuation of current forest management'. It can be used as a cornerstone for the base period as required for the Forest Reference Level for EU Member States."
https://openalex.org/W2901845010,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that has spread to over 100 countries. Dengue fever is caused by dengue virus (DENV), which belongs to the Flavivirus genus of the family Flaviviridae. DENV comprises 4 serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4), and each serotype is divided into distinct genotypes. Thailand is an endemic area where all 4 serotypes of DENV co-circulate. To understand the current genotype distribution of DENVs in Thailand, we enrolled 100 cases of fever with dengue-like symptoms at the Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute during 2016–2017. Among them, 37 cases were shown to be dengue-positive by real-time PCR. We were able to isolate DENVs from 21 cases, including 1 DENV-1, 8 DENV-2, 4 DENV-3, and 8 DENV-4. To investigate the divergence of the viruses, RNA was extracted from isolated DENVs and viral near-whole genome sequences were determined. Phylogenetic analysis of the obtained viral sequences revealed that DENV-2 genotype Cosmopolitan was co-circulating with DENV-2 genotype Asian-I, the previously predominating genotype in Thailand. Furthermore, DENV-3 genotype III was found instead of DENV-3 genotype II. The DENV-2 Cosmopolitan and DENV-3 genotype III found in Thailand were closely related to the respective strains found in nearby countries. These results indicated that DENVs in Thailand have increased in genotypic diversity, and suggested that the DENV genotypic shift observed in other Asian countries also might be taking place in Thailand."
https://openalex.org/W2900026840,"The McGurk effect is a classic audiovisual speech illusion in which discrepant auditory and visual syllables can lead to a fused percept (e.g., an auditory /bɑ/ paired with a visual /gɑ/ often leads to the perception of /dɑ/). The McGurk effect is robust and easily replicated in pooled group data, but there is tremendous variability in the extent to which individual participants are susceptible to it. In some studies, the rate at which individuals report fusion responses ranges from 0% to 100%. Despite its widespread use in the audiovisual speech perception literature, the roots of the wide variability in McGurk susceptibility are largely unknown. This study evaluated whether several perceptual and cognitive traits are related to McGurk susceptibility through correlational analyses and mixed effects modeling. We found that an individual’s susceptibility to the McGurk effect was related to their ability to extract place of articulation information from the visual signal (i.e., a more fine-grained analysis of lipreading ability), but not to scores on tasks measuring attentional control, processing speed, working memory capacity, or auditory perceptual gradiency. These results provide support for the claim that a small amount of the variability in susceptibility to the McGurk effect is attributable to lipreading skill. In contrast, cognitive and perceptual abilities that are commonly used predictors in individual differences studies do not appear to underlie susceptibility to the McGurk effect."

On the slaughter line, skin scratches were separately scored in the posterior region (defined as the area including the hind legs and the tail) and the anterior one (as the remaining area), while the whole carcass was examined for external hematomas. Chronic ear and tail lesions referable to the rearing phase, and bursitis were recorded as retrospective welfare indicators. The annual median prevalence of carcasses per batch with severe anterior scratches was 64% while 46.4% had severe posterior scratches. The highest autumn score for both skin scratches (P < 0.001) and traumatic ham defects (P = 0.005) is reflected in the positive correlation between severe posterior scratches and ham hematomas (r2 = 0.27; P < 0.001). Overnight lairage batches resulted in higher prevalence for scratches, while among ham defects only veining increased. Among binary records, only ear lesions were frequently recorded (annual median = 10%). A comparison analysis between pigs in and out of PDO circuit was performed to evaluate the variation related to the different genetics, showing differences for ear and tail lesions and for almost all the considered ham defects. The present study confirms that skin lesions represent a problem also for heavy pigs and that overnight lairage and season can affect their prevalence, with the associated possibility to give ham defects. Ear lesions are suitable to be used as retrospective welfare indicator, while tail lesions usage is nowadays limited by the extensive use of tail docking."
https://openalex.org/W2899518387,"Animals need to inhibit inappropriate actions that would lead to unwanted outcomes. Although this ability, called response inhibition, is impaired in neurological/psychiatric disorders with dopaminergic dysfunctions, how dopamine regulates response inhibition remains unclear. Here we investigated neuronal signals of the nigrostriatal dopamine system in monkeys performing a saccadic countermanding task. Subsets of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and striatal neurons receiving the dopaminergic input were activated when the monkey was required to cancel a planned saccadic eye movement. These activations were stronger when canceling the eye movements was successful compared with failed and were enhanced in demanding trials. The activated dopamine neurons were distributed mainly in the dorsolateral, but not in the ventromedial, part of the nigra. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the striatum dampened the performance of canceling saccadic eye movements. The present findings indicate that disruption of nigrostriatal dopamine signaling causes impairments in response inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2900335057,"Latency-reversing agents (LRAs) are considered a potential strategy for curing cells of HIV-1 infection. Certain protein kinase C (PKC) activators have been previously reported to be LRAs because they can reverse HIV latency. In the present study, we examined the activities of a panel of benzolactam derivatives against cells latently infected with HIV. Using determination of p24 antigen in cell supernatants or altered intracellular GFP expression to measure HIV reactivation from latently infected cells along with a cytotoxicity assay, we found that some of the compounds exhibited latency-reversing activity, which was followed by enhanced release of HIV particles from the cells. One derivative, BL-V8-310, displayed activity in ACH-2 and J-Lat cells latently infected with HIV at a concentration of 10 nm or higher, which was superior to the activity of another highly active PKC activator, prostratin. These results were confirmed with peripheral blood cells from HIV-infected patients. We also found that these drugs up-regulate the expression of caspase 3 and enhance apoptosis specifically in latently HIV-infected cells. Moreover, combining BL-V8-310 with a bromodomain-containing 4 (BRD4) inhibitor, JQ1, not only enhanced HIV latency-reversing activity, but also reduced the effect on cytotoxic cytokine secretion from CD4+ T-cells induced by BL-V8-310 alone. Our results suggest that BL-V8-310 and its related benzolactam derivatives are potential LRA lead compounds that are effective in reversing HIV latency and reducing viral reservoirs in HIV-positive individuals with few adverse effects."
https://openalex.org/W2901159198,"The number of images taken per patient scan has rapidly increased due to advances in software, hardware and digital imaging in the medical domain. There is the need for medical image annotation systems that are accurate as manual annotation is impractical, time-consuming and prone to errors. This paper presents modeling approaches performed to automatically classify and annotate radiographs using several classification schemes, which can be further applied for automatic content-based image retrieval (CBIR) and computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Different image preprocessing and enhancement techniques were applied to augment grayscale radiographs by virtually adding two extra layers. The Image Retrieval in Medical Applications (IRMA) Code, a mono-hierarchical multi-axial code, served as a basis for this work. To extensively evaluate the image enhancement techniques, five classification schemes including the complete IRMA code were adopted. The deep convolutional neural network systems Inception-v3 and Inception-ResNet-v2, and Random Forest models with 1000 trees were trained using extracted Bag-of-Keypoints visual representations. The classification model performances were evaluated using the ImageCLEF 2009 Medical Annotation Task test set. The applied visual enhancement techniques proved to achieve better annotation accuracy in all classification schemes."
https://openalex.org/W2901712126,"The associations between meteorological factors and mortality have been well documented worldwide, but limited evidence is available for the non-fatal health impacts of ambient temperature, particularly there are few population-based investigations on the impacts of emergency ambulance dispatches in Asia. In this study, based on 809,906 ambulance emergency call-outs (AECOs) for the total population from 2010–2016 in the subtropical city of Shenzhen, China, a Poisson regression combined with a distributed lag nonlinear model was used to simultaneously assess the nonlinear and lag effects of daily mean temperature on AECOs. Stratified analyses by age and sex were performed to identify vulnerable subpopulations. A U-shaped relationship was found between temperature and AECOs. Cold effects were delayed and persisted for 3–4 weeks, with a cumulative relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.23 (1.10–1.38) and 1.25 (1.16–1.35) over lag 0–28 when comparing the 1st and 5th percentile of the temperature distribution to the optimal (i.e. minimum AECOs) temperature, respectively. Hot effects were immediate and diminished quickly in 5 days, with an increase of 19% (RR = 1.19, 95%CI: 1.14–1.23) and 21% (RR = 1.21, 95%CI: 1.16–1.26) in AECOs over lag 0–5 when comparing the 95th and 99th percentile of temperature to the optimal temperature. Children and the elderly were more vulnerable to cold effects. The youth and middle-aged people suffered more from high temperature. The effects of temperature were similar between males and females. In summary, significant increases were observed in the frequency of AECOs during cold and hot days, and the weather-associated increases in AECOs are different among age groups. This information has valuable implications in ambulance demand prediction and service provision planning."
https://openalex.org/W2900915215,"Obesity is the result of white adipose tissue accumulation where excess of food energy is stored to form triglycerides. De novo lipogenesis (DNL) is the continuous process of new fat production and is driven by the transcription factor ChREBP. During adipogenesis, white adipocytes change their morphology and the entire cell volume is occupied by one large lipid droplet. Recent studies have implicated an essential role of autophagy in adipogenic differentiation, cytoplasmic remodelling and mitochondria reorganization. The phenolic monoterpenoid carvacrol (2-methyl-5-[1-methylethyl]phenol), produced by numerous aromatic plants, has been shown to reduce lipid accumulation in murine 3T3-L1 cells during adipogenic differentiation by modulating genes associated with adipogenesis and inflammation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether carvacrol could affect autophagy and ChREBP expression during adipogenic differentiation.The study was carried on by using the murine 3T3-L1 and the human WJ-MSCs (Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells) cell lines. Cells undergoing adipogenic differentiation were untreated or treated with carvacrol. Adipogenic differentiation was assessed by analyzing cellular lipid accumulation with Oil-Red O staining and by ultrastructural examination with TEM. Autophagy was evaluated by western immunoblotting of autophagy markers LC3B and p62/SQSTM and by ultrastructural examination of autophagic bodies. Autophagic flux was evaluated by using autophagy inhibitor cloroquine (CQ). ChREBP expression levels was assessed by both western blotting and immunoelectron microscopy and ChREBP activity by analysis of adipogenic target genes expression.We found that carvacrol reduced adipogenic differentiation of about 40% and 30% in, respectively, 3T3-L1 and in WJ-MSCs cells. The effect of carvacrol on adipogenic differentiation correlated with both reduction of autophagy and reduction of ChREBP expression.The results support the notion that carvacrol, through its effect on autophagy (essential for adipocyte maturation) and on ChREBP activity, could be used as a valuable adjuvant to reduce adipogenic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2901406070,"Particulate matter (PM) air pollution is a global environmental health problem contributing to more severe lung inflammation and injury. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of PM-induced exacerbation of lung barrier dysfunction and injury are not well understood. In the current study, we tested a hypothesis that PM exacerbates vascular barrier dysfunction via ROS-induced generation of truncated oxidized phospholipids (Tr-OxPLs). Treatment of human pulmonary endothelial cells with PM caused endothelial cell barrier disruption in a dose-dependent fashion. Biochemical analysis showed destabilization of cell junctions by PM via tyrosine phosphorylation and internalization of VE-cadherin. These events were accompanied by PM-induced generation of Tr-OxPLs, detected by mass spectrometry analysis. Furthermore, purified Tr-OxPLs: POVPC, PGPC and lyso-PC alone, caused a rapid increase in endothelial permeability and augmented pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction induced by submaximal doses of PM. In support of a role of TR-OxPLs-dependent mechanism in mediation of PM effects, ectopic expression of intracellular type 2 platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAFAH2), which specifically hydrolyzes Tr-OxPLs, significantly attenuated PM-induced endothelial hyperpermeability. In summary, this study uncovered a novel mechanism of PM-induced sustained dysfunction of pulmonary endothelial cell barrier which is driven by PM-induced generation of truncated products of phospholipid oxidation causing destabilization of cell junctions."
https://openalex.org/W2901537265,"Research has shown that inflammatory processes affect brain function and behavior through several neuroimmune pathways. However, high order brain functions affected by inflammation largely remain to be defined. Resting state functional connectivity of synchronized oscillatory activity is a valid approach to understand network processing and high order brain function under different experimental conditions. In the present study multi-electrode EEG recording in awake, freely moving rats was used to study resting state connectivity after administration of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Male Wistar rats were implanted with 10 cortical surface electrodes and administered with LPS (2 mg/kg) and monitored for symptoms of sickness at 3, 6 and 24 h. Resting state connectivity and power were computed at baseline, 6 and 24 h. Three prominent connectivity bands were identified using a method resistant to spurious correlation: alpha (5–15 Hz), beta-gamma (20–80 Hz), and high frequency oscillation (150–200 Hz). The most prominent connectivity band, alpha, was strongly reduced 6 h after LPS administration, and returned to baseline at 24 h. Beta-gamma connectivity was also reduced at 6 h and remained reduced at 24 h. Interestingly, high frequency oscillation connectivity remained unchanged at 6 h and was impaired 24 h after LPS challenge. Expected elevations in delta and theta power were observed at 6 h after LPS administration, when behavioral symptoms of sickness were maximal. Notably, gamma and high frequency power were reduced 6 h after LPS and returned to baseline by 24 h, when the effects on connectivity were more evident. Finally, increases in cross-frequency coupling elicited by LPS were detected at 6 h for theta-gamma and at 24 h for theta-high frequency oscillations. These studies show that LPS challenge profoundly affects EEG connectivity across all identified bands in a time-dependent manner indicating that inflammatory processes disrupt both bottom-up and top-down communication across the cortex during the peak and resolution of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2900515629,"Sorting nexin 5 (SNX5), a member of sorting nexin family, plays an important role in membrane trafficking, including the retrograde trafficking of the cation independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR) and macropinocytosis. Using ESI-LCMS/MS analysis, we confirmed that SNX5 serine 226 is phosphorylated. Since SNX5 forms heterodimers with SNX1 or SNX2, we examined the effect of phosphorylation at S226 on the heterodimer formations. Wild-type and mutants of SNX5, in which S226 was mutated to a glutamic acid or an alanine, were expressed in 8505C cells. In pull-down assays using SNX5 as bait, only the S226E mutant failed to precipitate both SNX1 and SNX2. Confocal microscopy data indicated that the wild type and S226A mutant were colocalized with SNX1 and SNX2 in endosomes, but the S226E was not. SNX5 and SNX6 support each other's functions and are involved with CI-M6PR retrograde trafficking. In SNX5 and SNX6 double knockdown cells, CI-M6PR was dispersed and colocalized with the endosomal marker EEA1. In a rescue experiment using SNX5 mutants, the S226A rescued CI-M6PR localization, similar to control cells, but S226E did not. Furthermore, the decrease in the uptake of dextran by macropinocytosis in SNX5 knockdown cells was recovered by the expression of rescue-wild type or S226A mutant, but not by the rescue-S226E mutant. These observations indicate that SNX5 constitutive phosphorylation that mimics the mutant S226E decreases the active SNX5 in these cells. The phosphorylation of SNX5 regulates the dimerization with SNX1 or SNX2, and this suggests that it controls membrane trafficking and protein sorting."
https://openalex.org/W2901427301,"The energy consumption-growth nexus has been widely studied in the empirical literature, though results have been inconclusive regarding the direction, or even the existence, of causality. These inconsistent results can be explained by two important limitations of the literature. First, the use of bivariate models, which fail to detect more complex causal relations, or the ad hoc approach to selecting variables in a multivariate framework; and, second, the use of linear causal models, which are unable to capture more complex nonlinear causal relationships. In this paper, we aim to overcome both limitations by analysing the energy consumption-growth nexus using a Flexible Fourier form due to Enders and Jones (2016). The analysis focuses on the US over the period 1949 to 2014. From our results we can conclude that, where the linear methodology supports the neutrality hypothesis (no causality between energy consumption and growth), the Flexible Fourier form points to the existence of causality from energy consumption to growth. This is contrary to the linear analysis, suggesting that lowering energy consumption would adversely affect US economic growth. Thus, by employing the Flexible Fourier form we find the conclusions can be quite different."

Carnevali D. Identification of RNA polymerase III-transcribed genes in eukaryotic genomes.Biochim Biophys Acta. 2013; 1829: 296-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These Pol III transcripts control several fundamental metabolic processes such as protein translation and RNA processing, thereby dictating the growth rate of a cell. The accurate initiation of Pol III–dependent transcription requires at least two general transcription factors, TFIIIB and TFIIIC (3Vannini A. Cramer P.

TFIIIC recognizes and binds to specific sequence elements in target gene promoters, thereafter allowing the recruitment of TFIIIB. The binding of TFIIIB to the promoter in turn precisely positions Pol III at the transcripti1on start site. The TFIIIB complex, used for transcription of both tRNAs and 5S rRNA, consists of BRF1 (B-related factor 1), TBP (TATA box-binding protein), and BDP1 (B double prime 1). In contrast, the U6 RNA gene uses a TFIIIB complex that is composed of TBP, BDP1, and BRF2, a splicing variant of BRF1 (5Schramm L. Hernandez N.

It has long been recognized that compared with normal cells, both transformed and tumor cells exhibit elevated Pol III–dependent transcription (6Pavon-Eternod M. Gomes S. Geslain R. Dai Q.

Dysregulation of the basal RNA polymerase transcription apparatus in cancer.Nat Rev Cancer. 2013; 13: 299-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), indicating that deregulated Pol III–dependent transcription plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. Consistent with this idea, enhanced Pol III–dependent transcription is required for oncogenic transformation of normal cells (9Johnson S.A. Dubeau L. Johnson D.L.

Chem. 2008; 283: 19184-19191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 10Marshall L. Elevated RNA polymerase III transcription drives proliferation and oncogenic transformation.Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 3327-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In addition, we have previously shown that the Pol III transcription product tRNA is able to inhibit apoptosis via directly binding to cytochrome c and preventing cytochrome c-initiated caspase activation (11Mei Y. Yong J. Liu H. Shi Y. Meinkoth J. Dreyfuss G. Yang X. tRNA binds to cytochrome c and inhibits caspase activation.Mol Cell. 2010; 37: 668-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Given that the evasion of apoptosis is a prominent hallmark of cancer (12Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation.Cell. 2011; 144: 646-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42611) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that increased expression of tRNA, caused by Pol III deregulation, may promote tumorigenesis via the inhibition of apoptosis. These findings suggest that enhanced Pol III–dependent transcription not only allows cancer cells to meet their high demands for protein synthesis, but it is also actively involved in tumorigenesis. Because of the fundamental role of Pol III–dependent transcription, this cellular process is not unexpectedly subjected to intricate regulation (1Turowski T.W. Tollervey D. Transcription by RNA polymerase III: insights into mechanism and regulation.Biochem Soc Trans. 2016; 44: 1367-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, TFIIIB is essential for accurate and efficient Pol III–dependent transcription. Therefore, it is not surprising that a variety of cellular factors are able to regulate Pol III–dependent transcription via targeting TFIIIB directly or indirectly. For instance, the tumor suppressors p53 and Rb directly interact with TFIIIB to inhibit its function (13Crighton D. Woiwode A. Zhang C. Mandavia N. Morton J.P. Warnock L.J. Milner J. White R.J.

Grandori C. Eisenman R.N. White R.J. Direct activation of RNA polymerase III transcription by c-Myc.Nature. 2003; 421: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In contrast, through its ability to control PI3K/Akt activity, the tumor suppressor PTEN indirectly regulates the integrity of the TFIIIB complex by modulating the association between TBP and BRF1 (17Woiwode A. Johnson S.A. Zhong S. Zhang C. Roeder R.G. Teichmann M. Johnson D.L. PTEN represses RNA polymerase III–dependent transcription by targeting the TFIIIB complex.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4204-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition to its regulation by oncogenes and tumor suppressors, Pol III–dependent transcription is also affected by BRF1 expression. It has been shown that reduced BRF1 expression significantly decreases Pol III–dependent transcription (18Zhang Q. Zhong Q. Evans A.G. Levy D. Zhong S. Phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 28 modulates RNA polymerase III–dependent transcription.Oncogene. 2011; 30: 3943-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The biallelic mis-sense mutations of BRF1 also decrease Pol III–dependent transcription activity and cause neurodevelopmental anomalies (19Borck G. Hog F. Dentici M.L. Tan P.L. Sowada N. Medeira A.

Moreover, post-translational modification of BRF1 plays an important role in the regulation of Pol III–dependent transcription. Several protein kinases, including Ck2, ERK, and PlK1, are able to phosphorylate BRF1, thereby controlling Pol III–dependent transcription (20Hu P. Samudre K. Wu S. Sun Y. Hernandez N.

It is well-known that in addition to phosphorylation, protein post-translational modifications also include ubiquitination (23Rape M. Ubiquitylation at the crossroads of development and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether cellular BRF1 is subjected to ubiquitin modification and whether Pol III–dependent transcription is regulated by BRF1 ubiquitination. RNF12, also known as RLIM, is an X-linked and Ring domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase (24Bach I. Rodriguez-Esteban C. Carriere C. Bhushan A. Krones A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Andersen B.

For example, RNF12 regulates the activities of several transcription factors by controlling the protein levels of their co-factors (25Johnsen S.A. Gungor C. Prenzel T. Riethdorf S. Riethdorf L.

RNF12 also modulates the TGFβ superfamily signaling pathways by promoting proteasome-dependent degradation of the negative regulator Smad7 (29Zhang L. Huang H. Zhou F. Schimmel J. Pardo C.G. Zhang T.

In this study, we report RNF12 as a novel interaction partner of BRF1. Via direct interaction, RNF12 promotes both Lys27- and Lys33-linked polyubiquitination of BRF1. Functionally, RNF12 negatively regulates Pol III–dependent transcription and cell proliferation via BRF1. Collectively, these results reveal RNF12 as a critical regulator of BRF1 and define an important function of RNF12 in the regulation of Pol III–dependent transcription. To investigate whether BRF1 undergoes ubiquitin modification, we performed the ubiquitination assay with WT ubiquitin or mutant ubiquitin (Ub–KO, all lysine residues replaced by arginine residues). The results showed that exogenous BRF1 was strongly polyubiquitinated in the presence of WT ubiquitin (Fig. 1A, lane 4). However, in the presence of Ub–KO, the polyubiquitination of BRF1 was barely detected (Fig. 1A, lane 5). In addition, the polyubiquitination of BRF1 was also verified at the endogenous level (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that BRF1 indeed undergoes polyubiquitination in cells. We next sought to determine how cellular BRF1 is polyubiquitinated. We employed an affinity purification method to identify novel BRF1-interacting proteins. HeLa cells were treated with formaldehyde to stabilize protein–protein interactions. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-BRF1 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by MS. RNF12, a RING domain–containing ubiquitin E3 ligase, was identified in the anti-BRF1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C and Table S1). To further verify the interaction between RNF12 and BRF1, we expressed GFP–RNF12 alone or together with Flag–BRF1 in HEK293T cells. An immunoprecipitation assay indicated a specific interaction of these two proteins (Fig. 1D). A reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiment using lysates from HEK293T cells expressing Flag–RNF12 and GFP–BRF1 also confirmed the RNF12–BRF1 interaction (Fig. 1E). Using a co-immunoprecipitation assay with anti-BRF1 antibody, the interaction between endogenous RNF12 and BRF1 was readily detected (Fig. 1F). Moreover, an in vitro binding assay with purified GST–RNF12 and Flag–BRF1 proteins revealed that RNF12 directly associated with BRF1 (Fig. 1G). The immunofluorescence assay showed that ectopically expressed RNF12 and BRF1 were co-localized in the nucleus (Fig. 1H). Taken together, these results demonstrate that RNF12 is a novel binding partner for BRF1. To identify the region of BRF1 that mediates the interaction with RNF12, we generated three BRF1 deletion mutants (Fig. 2A). BRF1 (aa 1–260) strongly associated with RNF12, whereas BRF1 (aa 261–520) and BRF1 (aa 521–677) exhibited no interaction with RNF12 (Fig. 2B), implying that the N-terminal region (aa 1–260) of BRF1 is responsible for its interaction with RNF12. To delineate the BRF1-binding domain in RNF12, we also generated a panel of RNF12 deletion mutants (Fig. 2C). Both RNF12 (aa 1–569) and RNF12 (aa 206–409) strongly bound to BRF1, whereas RNF12 (aa 1–205) and RNF12 (aa 410–624) showed no binding to BRF1 (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that the central region (aa 206–409) of RNF12 mediates the interaction with BRF1. To further determine whether the N-terminal region (aa 1–260) of BRF1 interacts with the central region (aa 206–409) of RNF12, we expressed GFP–RNF12 (206–409) alone or together with Flag–BRF1 (1–260) in HEK293T cells. The subsequent immunoprecipitation experiment showed that RNF12 (206–409) indeed interacted with BRF1 (1–260) (Fig. 2E). In addition, an in vitro binding assay with purified GST–RNF12 (206–409) and Flag–BRF1 (1–260) proteins revealed that RNF12 (206–409) directly associated with BRF1 (1–260) (Fig. 2F). Given the interaction of RNF12 with BRF1 and the previously reported ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of RNF12 (30Gontan C. Achame E.M. Demmers J. Barakat T.S. Rentmeester E. van I.W. Grootegoed J.A. Gribnau J. RNF12 initiates X-chromosome inactivation by targeting REX1 for degradation.Nature. 2012; 485: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we asked whether RNF12 could be responsible for BRF1 polyubiquitination. We first performed an in vivo ubiquitination assay. RNF12 was shown to promote BRF1 polyubiquitination (Fig. 3A). The RNF12-promoted BRF1 polyubiquitination also occurred under denaturing conditions (Fig. 3B). Compared with WT RNF12, the ubiquitin E3 ligase-inactive mutant of RNF12 (H569A/C572A) failed to show any effect on BRF1 polyubiquitination (Fig. 3C). To further determine whether RNF12 acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase for BRF1, an in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed with purified recombinant proteins. The results showed that WT RNF12, but not RNF12 (H569A/C572A), enhanced the polyubiquitination of BRF1 in vitro (Fig. 3D). Moreover, ectopic expression of RNF12 increased, whereas knockdown of RNF12 decreased the polyubiquitination of endogenous BRF1 (Fig. 3, E and F). These data indicate that RNF12 is a bona fide ubiquitin E3 ligase for BRF1. To identify the potential lysine residue(s) of BRF1 that are targeted for polyubiquitination by RNF12, we first evaluated which domain of BRF1 was ubiquitinated in cells. The results showed that similar to WT BRF1, the N-terminal region (aa 1–260) of BRF1 was heavily polyubiquitinated (Fig. 3G, lanes 1–4). In contrast, neither BRF1 (261–520) nor BRF1 (521–677) was polyubiquitinated (Fig. 3G, lanes 5–8). These data suggest that polyubiquitination may occur at the lysine(s) residing in the N-terminal region (aa 1–260) of BRF1. We therefore individually mutated the nine lysines (Lys65, Lys79, Lys115, Lys127, Lys165, Lys199, Lys215, Lys247, and Lys254) residing in the N terminus of BRF1 to arginine. Mutation of each single lysine to arginine did not completely abolish the polyubiquitination of BRF1 by RNF12 (Fig. 3H), indicating that RNF12-mediated BRF1 polyubiquitination may occur at multiple lysine residues. The finding that RNF12 enhanced BRF1 polyubiquitination prompted us to ask whether RNF12 could promote BRF1 protein degradation through the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Surprisingly, neither knockdown nor overexpression of RNF12 had an obvious effect on BRF1 protein levels (Fig. 4A). In addition, the half-life of BRF1 was not affected by ectopic expression of RNF12 (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that RNF12 does not regulate BRF1 protein turnover. We therefore sought to determine the type of BRF1 polyubiquitin chain induced by RNF12. Polyubiquitination usually occurs at Lys48 or Lys63 of ubiquitin. It has been well-known that Lys48-linked polyubiquitination serves as a recognition signal for target protein degradation via proteasome, whereas Lys63-linked polyubiquitination acts primarily as a regulatory rather than a proteolytic signal (35Swatek K.N. Komander D. Ubiquitin modifications.Cell Res. 2016; 26: 399-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 36Nathan J.A. Kim H.T. Ting L. Gygi S.P. Goldberg A.L. Why do cellular proteins linked to K63-polyubiquitin chains not associate with proteasomes?.EMBO J. 2013; 32: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We first performed the ubiquitination assay with four ubiquitin mutants UbK48R (Lys48 replaced by Arg), UbK63R (Lys63 replaced by Arg), Ub48K (lacks all lysine residues except Lys48), and Ub63K (lacks all lysine residues except Lys63). The results showed that RNF12 greatly enhanced the polyubiquitination of BRF1 in the presence of either UbK48R or UbK63R (Fig. 4C). However, RNF12 failed to induce polyubiquitination of BRF1 in the presence of Ub48K or Ub63K (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that the polyubiquitin chains attached to BRF1 catalyzed by RNF12 are not linked via either Lys48 or Lys63 of ubiquitin. We next performed the ubiquitination assay with five additional ubiquitin mutants: Ub6K, Ub11K, Ub27K, Ub29K, and Ub33K, in which all lysine residues were mutated to arginine residues except Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, and Lys33, respectively. In the presence of Ub6K, Ub11K, or Ub29K, RNF12 did not promote BRF1 polyubiquitination (Fig. 4D). Intriguingly, in the presence of Ub27K or Ub33K, RNF12 was shown to enhance the polyubiquitination of BRF1, although to a lesser extent than WT ubiquitin (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these findings indicate that RNF12 promotes both Lys27- and Lys33-linked polyubiquitination of BRF1. In support of this, RNF12 enhanced the polyubiquitination of BRF1 in the presence of either UbK27R (Lys27 replaced by Arg) or UbK33R (Lys33 replaced by Arg) (Fig. 4E). However, RNF12 failed to increase BRF1 polyubiquitination in the presence of UbK27R/K33R (both Lys27 and Lys33 replaced by Arg) (Fig. 4F). To investigate whether RNF12 regulates Pol III–dependent transcription, we performed real-time RT–PCR analysis to examine the levels of Pol III transcripts pre-tRNALeu, tRNATyr, and 5S rRNA. Knockdown of RNF12 greatly increased, whereas ectopic expression of RNF12 strongly decreased the levels of pre-tRNALeu, tRNATyr, and 5S rRNA (Fig. 5, A and B), indicating that RNF12 inhibits Pol III–dependent transcription. To determine whether RNF12 exerts this function via BRF1, exogenous BRF1 was introduced into RNF12-overexpressing cells. Ectopic expression of BRF1 indeed reversed the inhibitory effect of RNF12 on the expression levels of pre-tRNALeu, tRNATyr, and 5S rRNA (Fig. 5B). However, mutant BRF1 (521–677), lacking RNF12-binding ability, failed to reverse the effect of RNF12 on pre-tRNALeu, tRNATyr, and 5S rRNA levels (Fig. 5B). Therefore, these data suggest that RNF12 negatively regulates Pol III–dependent transcription through BRF1. To further determine whether RNF12 could also regulate Pol I– and Pol II–dependent transcription, we performed real-time RT–PCR analysis to examine the levels of Pol I transcripts 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA, and Pol II transcripts PRMT6 and E2F1. The results showed that the levels of these Pol I– and Pol II–specific transcripts were not affected by either overexpression or knockdown of RNF12 (Fig. 5C), indicating the specific regulatory effect of RNF12 on Pol III–dependent transcription. Given the ability of RNF12 to inhibit Pol III–dependent transcription, we sought to evaluate whether RNF12 could regulate cell proliferation. Cell proliferation and colony formation experiments were therefore performed. The results showed that ectopic expression of RNF12 greatly inhibited cell proliferation, as manifested by the slower growth curve and the decreased colony numbers in RNF12-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5, D and E). Intriguingly, RNF12-decreased cell proliferation was rescued by ectopic expression of BRF1, but not by mutant BRF1 (521–677) (Fig. 5E). Taken together, these data suggest that RNF12 negatively regulates Pol III–dependent transcription and cell proliferation via BRF1. To further explore how RNF12 inhibits Pol III–dependent transcription, we first examined whether RNF12 regulates the integrity of the TFIIIB complex such as the BRF1–TBP interaction. The results showed that ectopic expression of RNF12 did not evidently affect the BRF1–TBP interaction (Fig. 5F). We next asked whether RNF12 influences the binding of BRF1 to target gene promoters. The results showed that overexpression of RNF12 decreased, whereas knockdown of RNF12 increased the binding of BRF1 to the promoters of 5S rRNA and tRNALeu (Fig. 5, G and H). These findings indicate that RNF12 may inhibit Pol III–dependent transcription via decreasing the binding of BRF1 to target gene promoters. BRF1 is an essential initiation factor for Pol III–dependent transcription. Therefore, investigation of mechanisms underlying the regulation of BRF1 is of great importance to understanding Pol III–dependent transcription. The current study reveals that RNF12, a RING domain-containing E3 ligase, catalyzes the polyubiquitination of BRF1. Functionally, RNF12 regulates Pol III–dependent transcription and cell proliferation via BRF1. As the critical component of TFIIIB, BRF1 is subjected to intricate regulation in cells. For example, BRF1 is phosphorylated by multiple protein kinases, such as ERK and PlK1 (20Hu P. Samudre K. Wu S. Sun Y. Hernandez N.

The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK induces tRNA synthesis by phosphorylating TFIIIB.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2422-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). BRF1 phosphorylation is capable of regulating Pol III–dependent transcription. In this study, we report for the first time that cellular BRF1 also undergoes ubiquitin modification. Both in vitro and in vivo evidence demonstrates that RNF12 is a bona fide E3 ligase for BRF1. Protein ubiquitination is catalyzed by E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and a variety of E3 ubiquitin-ligating enzymes (37Akutsu M. Dikic I. Bremm A. Ubiquitin chain diversity at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2016; 129: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Depending on the type of polyubiquitin chain formed on the target protein, ubiquitin modification may play distinct functions. For example, the Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chain usually serves as a protein degradation signal, whereas the Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chain primarily acts as a regulatory signal (36Nathan J.A. Kim H.T. Ting L. Gygi S.P. Goldberg A.L.

https://openalex.org/W2900779943,"Background Rubella virus infection in early pregnancy lead to serious multi-organ birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The incidence of CRS varies in different populations and the highest burden is found in developing countries in which rubella vaccination is not included in their national immunization programs. In Ethiopia, there is scarcity of data about congenital rubella syndrome. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the burden of CRS-related birth defects and its incidence in the pre-vaccine era in Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia. Materials and methods A cross sectional study was conducted in Dessie, Felege-Hiwot and University of Gondar Referral Hospitals, from December 2015 to August 2017. After getting informed assent from each parent/guardian, blood was collected from infants < 1 year of age for laboratory determination of anti-rubella virus antibodies. Their socio-demographic data and clinical information compatible with congenital rubella syndrome were collected using WHO guideline. Results During the study period, a total of 50 infants suspected for congenital rubella syndrome were included in the study. All infants suspected for CRS were tested against rubella specific IgM and IgG [for infants ≥ 6 months of age] antibodies using ELISA method. Of these, 9/50 (18%) and 4/14 (28.6%) of them were laboratory confirmed and potential CRS cases, respectively. In the present study, the most common laboratory confirmed defect was ocular manifestations 6 (66.7%) followed by heart related problems 5 (55.6%). In the present study, most of the laboratory confirmed cases (66.7%) were reported among 1–5 months of age infants. In addition, 5 (55.6%) of the infants with laboratory confirmed CRS cases were male and 6 (66.7%) of them were from urban settings. In this study, the incidence of CRS was 0.4 per 1000 live births. Conclusion In this study, nearly one fifth of the infants had laboratory confirmed congenital rubella syndrome and most of them had multiple rubella associated congenital defects at a time. Most of these congenital anomalies were reported among infants ≥ 1 month of age. Based on our result, the incidence of the CRS was line with the global incidence of the CRS in the pre-vaccine era. Therefore, establishing strong rubella/CRS surveillance system as well as introducing the rubella containing vaccine in the national immunization program might be important to reduce the burden of rubella and CRS in the country."
https://openalex.org/W2901570508,"Background Resilience refers to a class of variables that are highly relevant to wellbeing and coping with stress, trauma, and chronic adversity. Despite its significance for health, resilience suffers from poor conceptual integration. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder with altered psychological stress reactivity and a brain-gut-microbiota axis, which causes high levels of chronic strain. Gut-directed Hypnotherapy (GHT) is a standardized treatment for IBS aimed at improving resilience. An improvement of resilience as a result of GHT has been hypothesized but requires further investigation. The aims of the study were to validate the construct and develop an integrational measure of various resilience domains by dimensional reduction, and to investigate changes in resilience in IBS patients after GHT. Method A total of N = 74 gastroenterology outpatients with IBS (Rome III criteria) were examined in 7 resilience domains, quality of life, psychological distress and symptom severity. Of these, n = 53 participated in 7 to 10 GHT group sessions (Manchester protocol). Post-treatment examinations were performed on average 10 months after last GHT session. Results Resilience factors proved to be unidimensional in the total sample. Greater resilience (composite score of resilience domains) and quality of life, and lower symptom severity and psychological distress were found after treatment (n = 16). Similar differences were present in cross-sectional comparisons of n = 37 treated vs. n = 37 untreated patients. Conclusion Resilience factors share a common psychological dimension and are functionally connected. The absence of maladaptive behaviours contributes to resilience. Improvements in resilience after hypnotherapy with parallel increases in quality of life and reduced psychological distress and symptom severity were observed. Independent replications with larger sample sizes and randomized controlled trials are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2901682437,"Extensive vascular remodeling causing pulmonary hypertension (PH) represents a major cause of mortality in patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). The chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a biomarker for the severity of PH and its activation is accompanied by pulmonary influx of monocytes and extensive vascular remodeling. MCP-1 activation can be reversed by application of rosiglitazone (thiazolidinedione). We performed this study to evaluate the role of MCP-1 for the pathogenesis of PH in experimental CDH. We hypothesized that vascular remodeling and MCP-1 activation is accompanied by pulmonary influx of fetal monocytes and can be attenuated by prenatal treatment with rosiglitazone.In a first set of experiments pregnant rats were treated with either nitrofen or vehicle on gestational day 9 (D9). Fetal lungs were harvested on D21 and divided into CDH and control. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot (WB), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to evaluate MCP-1 expression, activation, and localization. Quantification and localization of pulmonary monocytes/macrophages were carried out by IHC. In a second set of experiments nitrofen-exposed dams were randomly assigned to prenatal treatment with rosiglitazone or placebo on D18+D19. Fetal lungs were harvested on D21, divided into control, CDH+rosiglitazone, and CDH+placebo and evaluated by WB as well as IHC.Increased thickness of pulmonary arteries of CDH fetuses was accompanied by increased systemic and perivascular MCP-1 protein expression and significantly higher amounts of pulmonary monocytes/macrophages compared to controls (p<0.01). These effects were reversed by prenatal treatment with rosiglitazone (p<0.01 vs. CDH+P; control).Prenatal treatment with rosiglitazone has the potential to attenuate activation of pulmonary MCP-1, pulmonary monocyte influx, and vascular remodeling in experimental CDH. These results provide a basis for future research on prenatal immunomodulation as a novel treatment strategy to decrease secondary effects of PH in CDH."

The most popular clustering methods assume that the time series are only linearly dependent but this assumption usually fails in practice. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we study clustering methods applicable to time series with a general and dependent structure. We propose a copula-based distance to measure dissimilarity among time series and consider an estimator for it, where the strong consistency of the estimator is guaranteed. Once the pairwise distance matrix for time series has been obtained, we apply a hierarchical clustering algorithm to cluster the time series and ensure its consistency. Numerical studies, including a large number of simulations and analysis of practical data, show that our method performs well."
https://openalex.org/W2901891112,"Background In schizophrenia spectrum disorders, negative symptoms (e.g. social withdrawal) may persist after initial treatment with antipsychotics, much affecting the quality of life (QOL) of patients. This health-economic study evaluated if a dedicated form of cognitive behaviour therapy for social activation (CBTsa) would reduce negative symptoms and improve QOL in an economically sustainable way. Methods A health-economic evaluation was conducted alongside a single-blind randomised controlled trial in two parallel groups: guideline congruent treatment as usual (TAU; n = 50) versus TAU augmented with adjunct CBTsa (n = 49). Outcomes were PANSS negative symptom severity and EQ-5D quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. The health-economic evaluation was conducted both from the societal and the health sector perspective. Results Both conditions showed improvement in the respective outcomes over the follow-up period of six months, but QALY gains were significantly higher in the CBTsa condition compared to the TAU condition. Treatment response rate (i.e. ≥ 5-point decrease on the PANSS) was not significantly different. However, the add-on CBT intervention was associated with higher costs. This did not support the idea that CBTsa is a cost-effective adjunct. Various sensitivity analyses attested to the robustness of these findings. Conclusions In the Dutch context where TAU for psychosis is guideline congruent and well implemented there appears no added value for adjunct CBTsa. In other settings where the treatment for the schizophrenia spectrum disorders solely relies on antipsychotics, add-on CBTsa may lead to clinically superior outcomes, but it should still be evaluated if adjunct CBTsa therapy is a cost-effective alternative.

https://openalex.org/W2901929920,"Several bacterial pathogens produce nucleotidyl cyclase toxins to manipulate eukaryotic host cells. Inside host cells they are activated by endogenous cofactors to produce high levels of cyclic nucleotides (cNMPs). The ExoY toxin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaExoY) and the ExoY-like module (VnExoY) found in the MARTX (Multifunctional-Autoprocessing Repeats-in-ToXin) toxin of Vibrio nigripulchritudo share modest sequence similarity (~38%) but were both recently shown to be activated by actin after their delivery to the eukaryotic host cell. Here, we further characterized the ExoY-like cyclase of V. nigripulchritudo. We show that, in contrast to PaExoY that requires polymerized actin (F-actin) for maximum activation, VnExoY is selectively activated by monomeric actin (G-actin). These two enzymes also display different nucleotide substrate and divalent cation specificities. In vitro in presence of the cation Mg2+, the F-actin activated PaExoY exhibits a promiscuous nucleotidyl cyclase activity with the substrate preference GTP>ATP≥UTP>CTP, while the G-actin activated VnExoY shows a strong preference for ATP as substrate, as it is the case for the well-known calmodulin-activated adenylate cyclase toxins from Bordetella pertussis or Bacillus anthracis. These results suggest that the actin-activated nucleotidyl cyclase virulence factors despite sharing a common activator may actually display a greater variability of biological effects in infected cells than initially anticipated."

https://openalex.org/W2901116794,"Osteoporosis remains a major health concern due to high incidence of fragility fractures followed by higher mortality and morbidity. Implementation of guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis is critically discussed internationally. Aim of this study was to evaluate implementation of these guidelines regarding diagnosis and therapy of osteoporosis in a developed western country. We hypothesized that (a) prior diagnosis of osteoporosis in patients with low-energy fractures is higher than the estimated incidence and (b) diagnosis and therapy of osteoporosis in patients with prior low-energy fractures is higher than in patients without prior low-energy fractures. 399 patients >60 years suffering low-energy-fractures of their spine, femur, humerus or forearm between 03/2014 and 04/2015 were recruited in a German trauma center. All received a standardized interview. In 21% (84/399) of all patients, osteoporosis was diagnosed prior to current admission. 34% (136/399) suffered a prior risk-fracture after age of 50. Of these, only 54% (73/136) reported about following dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to test for decreased bone-marrow-density with positive results in 68% (50/73). 38% (19/50) of these patients with fragility fractures and prior osteoporosis diagnosis received anti-osteoporotic medication. 66% (263/399) of all patients had no prior risk-fracture and were tested for osteoporosis by DXA in 36% (95/263), leading to positive results in 34% (32/95). 44% (14/32) of these patients received anti-osteoporotic medication. Applying FRAX, 33% of all patients showed a calculated 10-year-risk >20% for suffering a major osteoporotic fracture. 61% (83/136) of patients with a prior fracture had a 10-year-risk >20% of which 47% (39/83) patients received no prior DXA. Although guidelines recommend diagnosis and treatment of patients with low-energy fractures, opportunity for early treatment following risk fractures seems rarely used. Expedient risk assessment is necessary to indicate further diagnostics and therapy of osteoporosis to ensure adequate and efficient treatment for osteoporotic fractures."

In this study we examine the impact of external (environmental) and internal (individual differences) factors on the tendency to cooperate or compete in social conflicts. To this end, 53 young adults played blocks of the repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma Game with each other or with a computer. The environmental context was manipulated across blocks, by introducing uncertainty, randomly losing or gaining money. Individual differences were assessed by participants’ attachment style. We found that participants cooperated more when randomly losing money compared to when randomly winning or in the neutral condition. Moreover, in a negative uncertain environment, individuals with higher anxious and avoidant attachment styles cooperated less. The above effects were only observed when playing against a human and not a computer. Overall, the findings highlight the dependency of cooperative behavior on the context as driven by external and internal factors."
https://openalex.org/W2900692823,"This paper introduces a new method for acquiring and interpreting data on cognitive (or perceptual) networks. The proposed method involves the collection of multiple reports on randomly chosen pairs of individuals, and statistical means for aggregating these reports into data of conventional sociometric form. We refer to the method as to emphasize that it aggregates multiple 3rd-party data on the perceived presence or absence of individual properties and pairwise relationships. Key features of the method include its low respondent burden, flexible interpretation, as well as its ability to find robust intransitive ties in the form of perceived non-edges. This latter feature, in turn, allows for the application of conventional balance clustering routines to perceptual tomography data. In what follows, we will describe both the method and an example of the implementation of the method from a recent community study among Alaska Natives. Interview data from 170 community residents is used to ascribe 4446 perceived relationships (2146 perceived edges, 2300 perceived non-edges) among 393 community members, and to assert the perceived presence (or absence) of 16 community-oriented helping behaviors to each individual in the community. Using balance theory-based partitioning of the perceptual network, we show that people in the community perceive distinct helping roles as structural associations among community members. The fact that role classes can be detected in network renderings of tomographic perceptual information lends support to the suggestion that this method is capable of producing meaningful new kinds of data about perceptual networks."

Significant variations were reported between and within seed provenances in all growth characters at both rotational ages. The broad sense heritability was higher at mid-rotational age. This revealed the growth is genetically controlled but with the time environmental effects escort the growth pattern. Growth pattern was different at each stand age. Growth is diameter dependent and the pattern was crown growth type. Families maintained their superiority over the time for tree height, basal diameter and diameter at breast height, which indicated a strong potential to identify good performing families for future plantation program.

https://openalex.org/W2762518689,"In Internet transactions, customers and service providers often interact once and anonymously. To prevent deceptive behavior a reputation system is particularly important to reduce information asymmetries about the quality of the offered product or service. In this study we examine the effectiveness of a reputation system to reduce information asymmetries when customers may make mistakes in judging the provided service quality. In our model, a service provider makes strategic quality choices and short-lived customers are asked to evaluate the observed quality by providing ratings to a reputation system. The customer is not able to always evaluate the service quality correctly and possibly submits an erroneous rating according to a predefined probability. Considering reputation profiles of the last three sales, within the theoretical model we derive that the service provider's dichotomous quality decisions are independent of the reputation profile and depend only on the probabilities of receiving positive and negative ratings when providing low or high quality. Thus, a service provider optimally either maintains a good reputation or completely refrains from any reputation building process. However, when mapping our theoretical model to an experimental design we find that a significant share of subjects in the role of the service provider deviates from optimal behavior and chooses actions which are conditional on the current reputation profile. With respect to these individual quality choices we see that subjects use milking strategies which means that they exploit a good reputation. In particular, if the sales price is high, low quality is delivered until the price drops below a certain threshold, and then high quality is chosen until the price increases again."

Colostrum collection can be challenging due to the small volume produced, and because breast pumps are not designed for colostrum collection. Besides pumping colostrum, the generally accepted practice is to use any available container to hand-express colostrum. Transfer between containers may lead to contamination, higher chance of infection and loss of colostrum. Our aim was to understand if a dedicated colostrum collection system (Primo-Lacto, Maternal Life, LLC, Palo Alto, CA) is more effective than standard hospital practice.Mothers who delivered preterm infants < 34 weeks gestation and mothers with non-latching infants were approached within 24 hours of delivery. Surveys were distributed to participating patients (n = 67), and nurses or lactation consultants (n = 89). Mothers compared ease of use, their confidence level and satisfaction with the amount collected during standard practice vs. the colostrum collection system. Nurses or lactation consultants compared ease of use, differences in colostrum loss and time invested collecting. Quantitative data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and qualitative data were analyzed with grounded theory methods.For mothers, ease of use and confidence were significantly better when they used the colostrum collection system than when they used the standard collection procedure, and this difference was true for both hand and pump expression (p<0.01). Nurses and lactation consultants perceived that ease of use was better, and percent of colostrum lost was significantly less with the colostrum collection system for both hand and pump expression. The collection times were not significantly different between the colostrum collection system and standard practice.The colostrum collection system is a tool to help facilitate successful colostrum collection and improve the experience both for clinicians and patients."
https://openalex.org/W2901687875,"Regulation of mRNA stability by RNA-protein interactions contributes significantly to quantitative aspects of gene expression. We have identified potential mRNA targets of the AU-rich element binding protein AUF1. Myc-tagged AUF1 p42 was induced in mouse NIH/3T3 cells and RNA-protein complexes isolated using anti-myc tag antibody beads. Bound mRNAs were analyzed with Affymetrix microarrays. We have identified 508 potential target mRNAs that were at least 3-fold enriched compared to control cells without myc-AUF1. 22.3% of the enriched mRNAs had an AU-rich cluster in the ARED Organism database, against 16.3% of non-enriched control mRNAs. The enrichment towards AU-rich elements was also visible by AREScore with an average value of 5.2 in the enriched mRNAs versus 4.2 in the control group. Yet, numerous mRNAs were enriched without a high ARE score. The enrichment of tetrameric and pentameric sequences suggests a broad AUF1 p42-binding spectrum at short U-rich sequences flanked by A or G. Still, some enriched mRNAs were highly unstable, as those of TNFSF11 (known as RANKL), KLF10, HES1, CCNT2, SMAD6, and BCL6. We have mapped some of the instability determinants. HES1 mRNA appeared to have a coding region determinant. Detailed analysis of the RANKL and BCL6 3’UTR revealed for both that full instability required two elements, which are conserved in evolution. In RANKL mRNA both elements are AU-rich and separated by 30 bases, while in BCL6 mRNA one is AU-rich and 60 bases from a non AU-rich element that potentially forms a stem-loop structure."
