https://openalex.org/W1972994243,"IT has been shown, that the superprecipitation of ‘natural actomyosin’ is subtly controlled, by a minute amount of calcium, ions1–3; the superprecipitation is promoted or depressed by the increase or the decrease of calcium ions in the reaction medium respectively. This unique action of calcium ions not only affords the basis for the relaxing mechanism of chelating agents2 as well as physiological relaxing factor3, but also appears to be closely associated with the link between excitation and contraction4."

https://openalex.org/W2011768678,"SUTCLIFFE1 has reported that the bacteriostat chloram-phenicol at concentrations of 2 g/l. effectively stops ion accumulation by tissue slices of red beet root and carrot root. Respiration and protoplasmic streaming were unaffected. The concentration of chloramphenicol required was much higher than that needed for inhibition of protein synthesis in most bacteria (2,000 versus about 10 mg/ml.), but the necessity for high concentrations in plant and animal systems is commonly observed2. Sutcliffe assumed that chloramphenicol was acting as a specific inhibitor of protein synthesis, as in bacteria, and interpreted the results as evidence for a close relationship between the process of protein synthesis and salt accumulation as suggested by Steward3. Jacoby and Sutcliffe4 later showed chloramphenicol to inhibit uptake of carbon-14-labelled glutamic acid, glycine and proline, by carrot tissue. The incorporation of the amino-acids into protein was inhibited in short-term experiments, but glycine and proline incorporation was not affected in long-term (24 h) experiments. Net protein synthesis was inhibited."

https://openalex.org/W1969830027,"THE use of Gibbs's reagent1 (2 : 6-dichlor- or 2 : 6-dibrom-p-benzoquinone-4-chlorimine (DBQC)) for locating certain organic thiophosphate pesticides on paper chromatograms was reported by Menn, Erwin and Gordon2. The reagent forms coloured derivatives with a variety of compounds in aqueous alkaline solution, but the development of a red colour in neutral or slightly acid conditions appears to be quite specific for the P→S group, certainly when linked with solubility of the test substance in petroleum solvents. The application of thin-layer chromatography with such a positive identification system offers the possibility of a rapid screening test for these pesticides in toxicological samples."
https://openalex.org/W2005831987,"SMITHIES1 has briefly mentioned a protein band which he found in the starch-gel electrophoretograms of sera from about 10 per cent of women who were either in late pregnancy or had recently delivered. In the work reported here, a much higher frequency has been found for what is probably the same protein band. In some runs in a borate gel at pH = 8.5, under essentially the same conditions as described by Smithies2, the protein of the investigation reported here migrated at a rate slightly slower than the first haptoglobin band of Hp 2–2 sera to which hæmoglobin had been added (Fig. 1). In other runs, the two were not separated. Accordingly, the typings for presence and absence of the band in Hp 2–2 sera are not included in the data given here although it was undoubtedly present in the majority of such sera."

The RF value of this product was identical with that of p-hydroxyphenoxymethyl penicillin, obtained from a sample of crude penicillin V2. This metabolite represents about 10 per cent of the activity found in the urine."

https://openalex.org/W2080177497,"THE highest endemicity of filariasis in the Philippine Islands occurs in the extensive abaca-growing areas of the Bicol Peninsula, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao1. Here the principal vector is the plant-cavity breeding Aedes (Finlaya) poicilius (Theobald), which is able to exist in dense populations because the abundant rainfall keeps the leaf axils of the abaca trees filled with water1. In our survey of 1954–55 (ref. 2), we showed a general correlation between the presence of abaca and filarial endemicity, but there were two notable exceptions. One of these was in the northern mountain province of Luzon. Through the co-operation of the Malaria Eradication Unit stationed at Tabuk, we received a sample of night blood films which showed a 29 per cent microfilaræmia-rate."

https://openalex.org/W1970074226,"IN comparing the immunological responsiveness, in relation to a particular nematode, of old-established hosts on one hand and newly established hosts on the other1, it was necessary to obtain an antigen which could be presumed to have been immunologically active over evolutionary time, that is, a natural product of normal infection. It was therefore essential to collect the excretions and secretions of worms living under conditions resembling as nearly as possible the natural environment, in this instance the liver and abdominal cavity of rats."

https://openalex.org/W1970107422,"IN most considerations of the role of the antigen in antibody formation the assumption is made that a template is either formed or activated. A template, by definition, is a system whereby many replicas are produced. The need for a template is based largely on the secondary response in which large quantities of antibodies are produced in response to small quantities of antigen over a long period of time. This, indeed, does appear to require a template. I wish to question whether the information available indicates that primary antibody formation requires a template."
