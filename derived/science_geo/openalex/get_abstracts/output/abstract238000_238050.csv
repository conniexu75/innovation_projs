https://openalex.org/W2171347020,"World food demand is expected to more than double by 2050. Decisions about how to meet this challenge will have profound effects on wild species and habitats. We show that farming is already the greatest extinction threat to birds (the best known taxon), and its adverse impacts look set to increase, especially in developing countries. Two competing solutions have been proposed: wildlife-friendly farming (which boosts densities of wild populations on farmland but may decrease agricultural yields) and land sparing (which minimizes demand for farmland by increasing yield). We present a model that identifies how to resolve the trade-off between these approaches. This shows that the best type of farming for species persistence depends on the demand for agricultural products and on how the population densities of different species on farmland change with agricultural yield. Empirical data on such density-yield functions are sparse, but evidence from a range of taxa in developing countries suggests that high-yield farming may allow more species to persist."

Here, the structure and dynamics of micelle-bound aS are reported. Val3-Val37 and Lys45-Thr92 form curved α-helices, connected by a well ordered, extended linker in an unexpected anti-parallel arrangement, followed by another short extended region (Gly93-Lys97), overlapping the recently identified chaperone-mediated autophagy recognition motif and a highly mobile tail (Asp98-Ala140). Helix curvature is significantly less than predicted based on the native micelle shape, indicating a deformation of the micelle by aS. Structural and dynamic parameters show a reduced helical content for Ala30-Val37. A dynamic variation in interhelical distance on the microsecond timescale is complemented by enhanced sub-nanosecond timescale dynamics, particularly in the remarkably glycine-rich segments of the helices. These unusually rich dynamics may serve to mitigate the effect of aS binding on membrane fluidity. The well ordered conformation of the helix-helix connector indicates a defined interaction with lipidic surfaces, suggesting that, when bound to larger diameter synaptic vesicles, it can act as a switch between this structure and a previously proposed uninterrupted helix.

Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites found in Parkinson's disease in general contain aggregates of aS (4Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M.

Moreover, three missense mutations (A30P, E46K, and A53T) in the gene encoding aS cause familial Parkinson's disease as well as aS gene triplication (3Nussbaum R.L. Ellis C.E. N. Engl. J.

The amino acid sequence of aS consists of 140 residues with 7 copies of an unusual 11-residue repeat, followed by a hydrophilic tail (Fig. 1). Based on sequence analysis, it was suggested that aS interacts with lipid membranes through its repeat region (10Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol.

In accordance with those properties, aS localizes in a physiological environment at nerve termini in close proximity to synaptic vesicles (15Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti G. Goedert M. J.

As evidenced by a number of biophysical techniques, aS is predominantly a random coil in aqueous solution but has been shown to adopt secondary structure of mostly helical nature upon association with negatively charged SUV or detergent micelle surfaces (10Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar, 12Chandra S. Chen X.C. Rizo J. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). In every case, the repeat region mediates lipid or detergent interactions, whereas the hydrophilic tail remains free in solution. In the presence of SUV the large majority of aS molecules exist vesicle-bound (10Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Based on the backbone 1H-1H NOE and secondary chemical shift pattern, helical secondary structure has been attributed to the entire repeat region in the micelle-bound state with the exception of a short stretch near Ser42-Thr44 (12Chandra S. Chen X.C. Rizo J. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15313-15318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 18Bussell R. Eliezer D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 763-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). When associated with SUVs of 300–400 Å diameter, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) data were interpreted as evidence for an uninterrupted helix extending throughout the entire repeat region (19Jao C.C. Der-Sarkissian A. Chen J. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8331-8336Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Helical wheel models have been proposed to describe the interaction of the helix side chains with the membrane surface (12Chandra S. Chen X.C. Rizo J. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15313-15318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 18Bussell R. Eliezer D. J. Mol.

A. 2004; 101: 8331-8336Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, besides those qualitative properties no further structural information of the lipid-bound state of aS is available. The dynamic properties of aS along the helix and information on site-specific interactions of aS with lipidic surfaces are also unknown. Moreover, although aS adopts β-stranded conformation in the aggregated, fibrillar forms characteristic of Lewy bodies (20Der-Sarkissian A. Jao C.C. Chen J. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37530-37535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), aggregation of aS into dimers and multimers is promoted by lipid environments that induce an α-helical conformation (14Narayanan V. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9927-9934Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 21Cole N.B. Murphy D.D. Grider T. Rueter S. Brasaemle D. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 671-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Thus, high resolution structural and dynamic information of aS in its helical conformation appears pertinent to developing a better understanding of the physiological role of aS, as well as possible structural features relevant to aS misfolding. Here, the structure and dynamics of aS in the micelle-bound form, determined by solution NMR spectroscopy, are presented and related to the vesicle-bound state. As solution NMR is limited by particle size, the direct study of vesicle-bound aS is not feasible. We therefore elected to resort to smaller diameter micelles, which elicit a similar aS helical content as SUV (12Chandra S. Chen X.C. Rizo J. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15313-15318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Protein Production—The human α-synuclein (aS) gene was expressed from the kanamycin restricted, T7lac promoter controlled pET-41 vector (Novagen, Inc.). A mutant, aS(S87C), was constructed from this vector following the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene, Inc.). Both genes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells, cultured in M9 minimal medium (6 g/liter Na2HPO4·7H2O, 3 g/liter KH2PO4, 0.5 g/liter NaC1, 1 mm MgSO4, 100 μm CaC12·2H2O, and d-glucose/NH4Cl as specified below). 1 g/liter 98% 15NH4Cl was employed to achieve 15N enrichment. 2 g/liter 99% [13C]glucose, 1 g/liter 98% 15ND4Cl, and 1 g/liter 98% D/99% 13C/98% 15N-rich growth medium supplement (Isogro, Isotec, Inc.) in D2O solution were employed to label with 2H/13C/15N. Uniformly 2H/13C/15N-enriched protein with selectively protonated Val-γ1,2, Leu-δ1,2, and Ile-δ1 methyl groups was prepared by using 2 g/liter 97% D, 99% [13C]glucose, 1 g/liter 98% 15ND4Cl in D2O solution, and, added 45 min before protein induction, 50 mg/liter 3,3-2H2-, α-[13C]ketobutyrate, and 100 mg/liter 3-2H-, α-[13C]ketoisovalerate (23Goto N.K. Gardner K.H. Mueller G.A. Willis R.C. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Protein expression was induced at A600 = 0.8 for 2 h in H2 Oor 4 h in D2O. Purification involved heat precipitation (10 min, 80 °C) of the cells in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl (2 mm β-mercaptoethanol for S87C). Subsequent ion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) yielded >98% pure protein of the correct mass as judged by SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry. NMR Sample Preparation—All samples were prepared in H2O to contain aS at a concentration of 0.5 mm (ϵ280 = 5120 m-1cm-1), 75 mm SDS, 6% D2O, and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 in a total volume of 270 μl. Nine samples were prepared. Sample A was enriched only in 15N, sample B was uniformly enriched in 2H/13C/15N, sample C with 2H/13C/15N, but selectively protonated at Val-γ1,2, Leu-δ1,2, and Ile-δ1 methyl groups and also employed deuterated SDS. Samples D and E used 2H/13C/15N-enriched aS in the presence of charged stretched polyacrylamide gels (see below). Samples F–H employed 2H/13C/15N-enriched aS(S87C) tagged with cysteaminyl-EDTA, complexed with Ca2+,Mn2+, and Co2+, respectively. Samples A–E were buffered by 20 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, and samples F–H by 20 mm HEPES·NaOH, pH 7.4. The last sample, I, contained 2H/13C/15N-labeled aS, buffered by 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.4. The gel for sample D was polymerized from a 4.6% w/v solution of acrylamide (AA), 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonate (AMPS), and bisacrylamide with a monomer to cross-linker ratio of 39:1 (w/w) and a molar ratio of 96:4 of AA to AMPS. To allow easy comparison between gels containing different amounts of charged monomer, AMPS is counted here as AA and the AMPS:AA ratio is specified separately. Gel for sample E was polymerized from a 5.2% w/v solution of AA, AMPS, and piperazine diacrylamide as cross-linker with a monomer to cross-linker ratio of 39:1 (w/w) and a molar ratio of 98:2 of AA to AMPS. For the reported monomer to cross-linker ratio, piperazine diacrylamide was counted as bisacrylamide to again allow for direct comparison between gels. Polymerization was initiated by the addition of ammonium persulfate and TEMED at 0.1% w/v and v/v, respectively, and allowed to proceed in a cylinder of 5.4-mm diameter for 3 h at 23 °C. Subsequently, gels were dialyzed, dried, soaked with protein solution for 2 days, and transferred to NMR tubes as described (24Ulmer T.S. Ramirez B.E. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 9179-9191Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 25Chou J.J. Gaemers S. Howder B. Louis J.M. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). 2H quadrupolar splittings of 1.2 and 1.7 Hz were measured for samples D and E, respectively. A 20 mm HEPES·NaOH, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3 solution of 50 μm aS(S87C) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol was exchanged into the dithiothreitol-free solution containing 1 mmN-[S-(2-pyridylthio)cysteaminyl]-EDTA (Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc.) by ultrafiltration and allowed to react overnight at room temperature. Small amounts of homodimeric aS(S87C) were removed by ion-exchange chromatography, and aS(S87C)-cysteaminyl-EDTA was exchanged into 20 mm HEPES·NaOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl by ultrafiltration. The EDTA tag was then charged by adding a 1.2 times excess of the desired ion over the protein, washed extensively with 20 mm HEPES·NaOH, pH 7.4, 700 mm NaCl to remove non-specifically bound ions, and exchanged into 20 mm HEPES·NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.02% NaN3 by ultrafiltration. Samples were completed by the addition of SDS and D2O to 75 mm and 6%, respectively. NMR Spectroscopy—All experiments were carried out at 25 °C on Bruker spectrometers operating at 1H frequencies of 600, 750, and 800 MHz equipped with cryogenic (600 MHz) or room temperature (750 and 800 MHz) probes. Data were processed and analyzed with the nmrPipe package (26Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11533) Google Scholar). Throughout most experiments, the TROSY N-H component was selected (27Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar, 28Weigelt J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10778-10779Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). HN, N, Cα, and C′ assignments were made from HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO experiments using sample B and the reported HN, N, and Cα assignments (12Chandra S. Chen X.C. Rizo J. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15313-15318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Hα and partial Hβ assignments were obtained from TOCSY-TROSY experiments (sample A, τmix = 36 ms). CH3 assignments of Val-γ1,2, Leu-δ1,2, and Ile-δ1 moieties of sample C were based on (H)CCONH and H(C)CONH experiments (29Grzesiek S. Anglister J. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1993; 101: 114-119Crossref Scopus (585) Google Scholar). HN-HN NOEs were measured from HSQC-NOESY-TROSY experiments (sample B, τmix = 170 ms), HN-Hα NOEs from NOESY-TROSY experiments (sample A, τmix = 100 ms), HN-Hγ,δ (Val/Leu/Ile) NOEs from NOESY-TROSY experiments (sample C, τmix = 150 ms), and CH3-CH3 NOEs from CT-HSQC-NOESY-CT-HSQC experiments (sample C, τmix = 150 ms). 3JC′Cγ and 3JNCγ couplings for aromatic and aliphatic residues were obtained from quantitative J-correlation spectroscopy (30Hu J.S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Hu J.S. Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 1803-1804Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with dephasing times of 60 and 160 ms, respectively. 1JNH, 1JCαC′, 1JC′N, and 1JNH + 1DNH, 1JCαC′ + 1DCαC′, 1JC′N + 1DC′N couplings were determined from mixed-constant time, HN-coupled HNCO, Cα-coupled HNCO, or quantitative J-correlation HN(CA)CO (32Jaroniec C.P. Ulmer T.S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 30: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and quantitative J-correlation HNCO experiments (33Chou J.J. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) of samples B, D, and E, respectively. The 15N relaxation parameters R1, R2, and {1H}-15N NOE were determined at 60.8-MHz for sample B (34Zhu G. Xia Y.L. Nicholson L.K. Sze K.H. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 143: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 35Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Formankay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). For the {1H}-15N NOE measurement, 5 s of presaturation preceded by a recycling delay of 4 s were used for the NOE experiment and a 9-s recycle delay for the reference experiment. Mn2+-induced paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PRE) of 1HN transverse magnetizations, Γ2, were determined from the difference in R2(1HN) of the Ca2+- and Mn2+-loaded samples, employing the pulse sequence described in Ref. 36Donaldson L.W. Skrynnikov N.R. Choy W.Y. Muhandiram D.R. Sarkar B. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9843-9847Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar. Co2+-induced pseudo-contact shifts were found to result in peak doubling of resonances close to the metal ion, indicating the presence of two diastereomers for the cysteaminyl·EDTA·Co2+ complex and, for this reason, were not pursued further. Structure Calculation—Due to the pronounced differences in dynamics experienced by the RDC (see “Results”), the local geometry of Val3-Lys97, exhibiting general order parameters (S2) above 0.5, was generated by molecular fragment replacement (37Delaglio F. Kontaxis G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2142-2143Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The remaining residues are represented by random-coil conformations. A fragment length of 7 residues, 372 Hα, N, Cα, and C′ chemical shifts, and 520 1DNH, 1DCαC′, and 1DC′N residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were used for molecular fragment replacement, allowing the alignment tensor for each fragment to be an adjustable parameter. For each fragment ten candidates in best agreement with the chemical shifts and RDCs were selected from the molecular fragment replacement data base (37Delaglio F. Kontaxis G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2142-2143Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Backbone dihedral angles were then determined by averaging over all selected candidates of all (overlapping) fragments containing any given angle, but excluding fragments where this angle is located in its N- or C-terminal residue. The alignment tensor magnitudes, Da, calculated for this average structure varies little with fragment lengths ranging from 7 to 11 residues (Supplementary Fig. 1), indicating that dynamics is not significantly impacting the fragment structures over this length range. Standard deviations for the angles were typically between 2 and 10° for most residues, and between 10 and 25° for Ala30-Thr44. The local geometry thus defined was implemented as backbone dihedral restraints in subsequent structure calculations with the program Xplor-NIH 2.9.5 (38Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). The backbone HN-HN,α NOEs were found to be in good agreement with this generated structure, and side-chain conformations were restricted by HN-Hγ(Ile/Thr), HN-Hδ(Val/Leu) and CH3-CH3 NOEs. For residues with non-rotamer-averaged 3JC′Cγ and 3JNCγ couplings, the χ1 rotamer state was selected based on those couplings (30Hu J.S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Hu J.S. Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 1803-1804Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For the translation of PRE Γ2 values into distances, the cysteaminyl-EDTA-Mn2+ group was represented by an ensemble of three structures during simulated annealing, and the model-free Solomon-Bloembergen equations were applied (39Iwahara J. Schwieters C.D. Clore G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 5879-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The Γ2 values of repeat region residues exhibited a constant, reproducible background (Supplementary Fig. 2), which was subtracted (6 Hz) to achieve agreement between the position of the paramagnetic tag and helix-C, i.e. internal referencing was performed. For helix-N the HN intensity ratios between dia- and paramagnetic samples, IMn2+/ICa2+, followed the Γ2 values except for the first nine residues (Supplementary Fig. 2), suggesting some variation in distance between helix-N and -C with more distant conformers contributing overproportionally to the ensemble-averaged R2(Mn2+) rate, i.e. the calculated interhelical distances will be somewhat biased to more remote distances than the actual average. In order not to introduce opposing restraints, the structure was calculated by only considering the Γ2 values of Lys10-Lys21 of helix-N, besides the values for helix-C. It is also noted that the paramagnetic tag is clearly oriented to one side of helix-C (Supplementary Fig. 3). To aid in the placement of the helices relative to each other, global alignment tensors were used to describe RDC for residues with S2 > 0.8 and with fragment number exhibiting |Da| > 6 Hz (residues 9–23, 54–63, and 70–81 for sample D and residues 9–23, 57–63, and 70–81 for sample E). Simulated annealing calculations were carried out from 500 to0Kin the presence of an empirical backbone-backbone hydrogen-bonding potential (40Grishaev A. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 7281-7292Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and torsion angle potentials of mean force (41Kuszewski J.J. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 146: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In order not to distort helix-C by the relatively strong forces acting on the paramagnetic tag, the dihedral angle restraints of residues 85–88 were tightened. To allow a wider range of helix-helix orientations, the dihedral angle restraints of residues 39–43 were relaxed. The energy-minimized average structure, calculated from the ensemble of 20 lowest energy structures, was deposited in the protein data base under accession code 1XQ8. SDS Titration—Titrations were performed in 20 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4)/6% D2O at 25 °C and 800 MHz. The aS starting concentration was 0.2 mm, and 11 titrations steps were performed from aS:SDS molar ratios of 0:422 (Fig. 2). At each titration point a TROSYHSQC spectrum was recorded (t15N,max = 144.9 ms, t1HN,max = 113.9 ms). In the absence of SDS selected aS assignments were made based on an HNCA experiment and comparison of aS wild-type spectra with spectra of aS mutants A30P and A53T. Between aS:SDS ratios of 14 to 43 the assignment of a few residues with characteristic chemical shift was made. For aS:SDS ratios ranging from 58 to 422 peaks shift relatively little and assignments followed directly from the assignments of sample B (cf. above). Association of aS with SDS Micelles Is Quantitative and Not Strongly Dependent on the Chemical Makeup of the Micelle— The transition of aS from the free to the micelle-bound state has been examined by NMR spectroscopy to monitor the structuring of aS and to assess the tightness of aS binding to a micelle composed of SDS molecules. A tight interaction is mandatory for structure determination by NMR. Subsequently, mixed-micelles in which 70% of the SDS molecules have been replaced by the lipid-like detergent dodecyl phosphocholine (DPC) were compared with SDS-only micelles to assess the influence of micelle chemical makeup on aS structural properties. In the presence of aS, a SDS micelle was estimated to contain ∼70 SDS molecules (12Chandra S. Chen X.C. Rizo J. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15313-15318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Consequently, up to a molar aS:SDS ratio of ∼1:70, multiple aS molecules may bind to a single micelle. A titration with SDS was carried out to cover molar aS:SDS ratios ranging from 0 to 422 at an initial aS concentration of 0.2 mm. Chemical shift changes of the backbone 1HN and 15N nuclei of each residue were monitored during the titration, and the 1HN chemical shift changes of four residues, Ala29, Thr54, Ala56, and Met116, are presented here (see Fig. 2). Changes in chemical shifts are sensitive indicators of changes in local structure and, thus, excellent probes of the transition of aS from the free to the micelle-bound state. The first titration step, to an aS:SDS ratio of 1:14, broadened the resonances of the entire repeat region of aS (Fig. 1) essentially beyond detection. The broadening may arise from the binding of multiple copies of aS, resulting in large particle sizes, or exchange kinetics that is intermediate on the NMR timescale. As the titration progresses (aS:SDS = 1:29), the missing resonances reappear at new positions. For residues of the C-terminal tail region (Fig. 1), no significant change in signal intensity was observed during these two titration steps, but essentially all of their very small shift changes take place there (Fig. 2D). At an aS:SDS ratio of 1:43, two species arise for each repeat region residue, one resonance that often, but not always, appears close to the previous titration step and one that is headed toward the final micelle-bound state (Fig. 2C). At aS:SDS ratios of 1:58 and higher only one resonance was observed for all residues, which asymptotically approached the final micelle-saturated state (Fig. 2, A–C). In good agreement with the previous estimate of the SDS micelle size (12Chandra S. Chen X.C. Rizo J. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15313-15318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), the chemical shift changes for repeat region residues leveled off rapidly after the titration point at an aS:SDS ratio of 1:73 was reached (Fig. 2, A–C), i.e. after each micelle had at most a single aS molecule bound, showing that quantitative aS·micelle complex formation had occurred. Remarkably, for most residues of the repeat region, if not all, the chemical shift in the absence of SDS does not fall on the smooth curve toward the final micelle-saturated state (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that the repeat region progresses through an intermediate state to reach the micelle-saturated state. Given the excess of aS over micelles, this intermediate state could involve two or more micelle-bound aS molecules. However, an analogous titration monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy has found the aS helical content to increase until a aS:SDS ratio of ∼1:70 is reached (12Chandra S. Chen X.C. Rizo J. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15313-15318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), indicating that below this ratio the free aS state remains populated and/or that, within such higher order complexes,"

https://openalex.org/W2125765412,"Some of the global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gases is offset by increased reflection of solar radiation by clouds with smaller droplets that form in air polluted with aerosol particles that serve as cloud condensation nuclei. The resulting cooling tendency, termed the indirect aerosol forcing, is thought to be comparable in magnitude to the forcing by anthropogenic CO2, but it is difficult to estimate because the physical processes that determine global aerosol and cloud populations are poorly understood. Smaller cloud droplets not only reflect sunlight more effectively, but also inhibit precipitation, which is expected to result in increased cloud water. Such an increase in cloud water would result in even more reflective clouds, further increasing the indirect forcing. Marine boundary-layer clouds polluted by aerosol particles, however, are not generally observed to hold more water. Here we simulate stratocumulus clouds with a fluid dynamics model that includes detailed treatments of cloud microphysics and radiative transfer. Our simulations show that the response of cloud water to suppression of precipitation from increased droplet concentrations is determined by a competition between moistening from decreased surface precipitation and drying from increased entrainment of overlying air. Only when the overlying air is humid or droplet concentrations are very low does sufficient precipitation reach the surface to allow cloud water to increase with droplet concentrations. Otherwise, the response of cloud water to aerosol-induced suppression of precipitation is dominated by enhanced entrainment of overlying dry air. In this scenario, cloud water is reduced as droplet concentrations increase, which diminishes the indirect climate forcing."

During the last three years several studies have shown that anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can antagonize prion propagation in vitro and in vivo, but the mechanisms of inhibition are not known so far. To identify the most powerful mAbs and characterize more precisely the therapeutic effect of anti-PrP antibodies, we have screened 145 different mAbs produced in our laboratory for their capacity to cure cells constitutively expressing PrPSc.

Antibodies having a cleaning effect are directed against linear epitopes located in at least four different regions of PrP, suggesting an epitope-independent inhibition mechanism. The consequence of antibody binding is the sequestration of PrPc at the cell surface, an increase of PrPc levels recovered in cell culture medium, and an internalization of antibodies. Taken together these data suggest that the cleaning process is more likely due to a global effect on the PrP trafficking and/or transconformation process.

These diseases are closely associated with the conversion of the normal α-helix-rich and protease-sensitive cellular isoform of prion protein (PrPsen or PrPc) into a β-sheet-rich disease-related form (PrPres or PrPSc) that possesses abnormal physicochemical properties such as protease resistance, insolubility, and propensity to polymerize into amyloid-like fibrils (1Prusiner S.B.

Science. 1991; 252: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). This conversion occurs via a post-translational process without any change in protein primary structure. According to “the proteinonly theory” (3Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4072) Google Scholar), transmission of TSEs is mediated by PrPSc itself, which is able to convert PrPc into its own modified conformation by direct interaction. The central event of prion diseases is the accumulation of PrPSc in the brain, which is associated with neuronal degeneration characterized by astrocytic gliosis, spongiosis, and nerve cell loss. TSEs are unique in that they can be spontaneous, genetic, or infectious diseases (4Aguzzi A. Polymenidou M. Cell. 2004; 116: 313-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 5Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E.

Further to the BSE epidemic in Great Britain in 1992, a new infectious form of CJD was identified in 1996; that is, the variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), most likely caused by exposure to bovine prions (6Hill A.F.

Today, the number of vCJD victims in Europe has risen to about 150 cases, and the epidemic appears to be stabilizing. Since removal of specified risk material and post-mortem diagnostic tests are mandatory for slaughtered cattle in Europe, BSE transmission to humans no longer poses a major threat. However, there is uncertainty surrounding possible human to human transmission of the disease through surgery, organ grafting or blood transfusion. Indeed, as opposed to other forms of human prion diseases, where prion infectivity is usually restricted to the central nervous system, for vCJD, PrPSc as well as infectivity is readily detectable in lymphoid organs (8Hill A.F.

Furthermore, the recent identification of vCJD infection in two individuals who received a blood transfusion from a donor who later died of vCJD confirms that such risk of infection actually exists (13Llewelyn C.A.

Currently, no effective treatment exists, and the development of novel therapeutic strategies against prion diseases has become a priority. To date, several chemical compounds have been identified to antagonize prion propagation in vitro on cell culture-based assays and/or in vivo in animal studies (for reviews, see Refs. 15Supattapone S. Nishina K. Rees J.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Nunziante M. Gilch S. Schatzl H.M.

Neurology. 2002; 58: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, many compounds efficient in in vitro studies turned out to be disappointing in animal models because the benefits are only seen if treatment has begun before or close to inoculation with the infectious agent (e.g. polyanions and cyclic tetrapyrroles (19Priola S.A. Raines A. Caughey W.S. Science. 2000; 287: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, many of the compounds identified have limited clinical applications due to severe toxicity (e.g. Congo red (20Rudyk H. Vasiljevic S. Hennion R.M. Birkett C.R. Hope J. Gilbert I.H. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), iododoxorubicin, amphotericin B, chlorpromazine, β-sheet breakers) as well as inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (e.g. Congo red (20Rudyk H.

To date phthalocyanines and porphyrins gave the most interesting results in vivo by increasing survival time by up to 50–300% in mice (19Priola S.A. Raines A. Caughey W.S. Science. 2000; 287: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and only quinacrine and flupirtine are under clinical evaluation in humans (21Nakajima M. Yamada T. Kusuhara T. Furukawa H.

A single patient in the UK has also received pentosan polysulfate for compassionate purposes, and additional patients are being treated with this drug to test its activity (reported by the media). Given the few possibilities for therapeutic and/or prophylactic intervention to date, new therapeutic strategies are a major focus of research to identify new compounds that could interfere with in vivo prion propagation (16Nunziante M. Gilch S. Schatzl H.M. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 1268-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Gilch S. Schatzl H.M. Trends Mol.

Virol. 2003; 77: 10288-10294Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A recent study has suggested that soluble IgG-like dimeric PrP consisting of two moieties fused to the Fcγ tail of human IgG1 (called PrP-Fc2) may represent a new class of anti-prion compounds (26Meier P. Genoud N. Prinz M. Maissen M. Rulicke T. Zurbriggen A. Raeber A.J. Aguzzi A. Cell. 2003; 113: 49-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Another promising therapy lies in the potential of active or passive immunization using anti-PrP antibodies. Although active immunization strategies are confronted with a problem of self-tolerance (27Polymenidou M. Heppner F.L. Pellicioli E.C. Urich E. Miele G. Braun N. Wopfner F. Schatzl H.M. Becher B. Aguzzi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14670-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), polyclonal anti-PrP auto-antibodies can be induced with dimeric PrP in wild-type mice and interfere efficiently with PrPSc propagation in prion-infected cells (28Gilch S. Wopfner F. Renner-Muller I. Kremmer E. Bauer C. Wolf E. Brem G. Groschup M.H. Schatzl H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18524-18531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, vaccination with recombinant mouse prion protein delays the onset of prion disease in mice (29Sigurdsson E.M. Brown D.R. Daniels M. Kascsak R.J. Kascsak R. Carp R. Meeker H.C. Frangione B. Wisniewski T. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 13-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Another vaccination approach by passive immunization is also promising. Indeed, anti-PrP antibodies were not only shown to inhibit formation of protease-resistant PrP in a cell-free system (30Horiuchi M. Caughey B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3193-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) but were also shown to prevent infection of susceptible N2a cells (31Enari M. Flechsig E. Weissmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9295-9299Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and inhibit prion replication in infected cells (32Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Kaneko K. Vergara J. Leclerc E. Schmitt-Ulms G.

Virol. 2004; 85: 3473-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, transgenic expression of the anti-PrP monoclonal antibody 6H4 in mice expressing PrP blocks prion pathogenesis upon intraperitoneal inoculation (35Heppner F.L. Musahl C. Arrighi I. Klein M.A. Rulicke T. Oesch B. Zinkernagel R.M. Kalinke U. Aguzzi A. Science. 2001; 294: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which anti-PrP antibodies interfere with PrPSc replication is not clear, but the main hypothesis presented so far involves either a perturbation of PrP cellular trafficking/PrPc degradation (33Perrier V. Solassol J. Crozet C. Frobert Y. Mourton-Gilles C. Grassi J. Lehmann S. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 454-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) or a disruption of the interaction between PrPc and PrPSc (32Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Kaneko K. Vergara J. Leclerc E. Schmitt-Ulms G. Mehlhorn I.R. Legname G. Wormald M.R. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Burton D.R. Prusiner S.B. Nature. 2001; 412: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) by the antibodies. In this second hypothesis, the 132–140 portion of PrPc is thought to be important for PrPSc binding and is considered as a privileged target for development of anti-prion drugs. Therapy for prion diseases needs delivery of anti-prion compounds either directly into the central nervous system as for all neurodegenerative disorders or in peripheral sites after prion exposure and before the neuroinvasion by the infectious agent. Concerning the first delivery case, a recent study by Solforosi (36Solforosi L. Criado J.R. McGavern D.B. Wirz S. Sanchez-Alavez M. Sugama S. DeGiorgio L.A. Volpe B.T. Wiseman E. Abalos G. Masliah E. Gilden D. Oldstone M.B. Conti B. Williamson R.A. Science. 2004; 303: 1514-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) showing that cross-linking PrPc in vivo using anti-PrP antibodies triggers rapid and extensive apoptosis in hippocampal and cerebellar neurons has prompted extreme caution over the use of PrPc-specific inhibitors directly within the central nervous system. Passive immunization by anti-PrP antibodies is, thus, thought to be more likely applicable to prion diseases where infection occurs from peripheral sites of the body (for example, oral and intraperitoneal infection) and where propagation and transport of prions outside the central nervous system have to take place before neuroinvasion. In this regard the recent in vivo study by White et al. (37White A.R. Enever P. Tayebi M. Mushens R. Linehan J. Brandner S. Anstee D. Collinge J. Hawke S. Nature. 2003; 422: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), in a murine scrapie model using passive immunization, is by far the most significant one in the field of TSE therapy; continued antibody treatment started 7 or 30 days post-intraperitoneal inoculation delayed onset of scrapie for more than 300 days compared with equivalent untreated animals. To identify those monoclonal antibodies that are the most suited for therapeutic application and to characterize more precisely the therapeutic effect of anti-PrP antibodies, we have screened 145 different monoclonal anti-PrP antibodies produced in our laboratory for their capacity to inhibit PrPSc replication in two cell culture models constitutively expressing murine or ovine PrPSc (N2a58/22L and Rov9 cells). We identified more than 30 antibodies appearing to be efficient in curing the infected cells. Some of our antibodies show an IC50 10-fold lower than those previously given in the literature. Our results confirm that a very potent inhibition is obtained with monoclonal antibodies directed against PrPc present at the surface of infected cells, indicating that targeting PrPc is beneficial for prion therapy. The main consequences of antibody binding is a sequestration of PrPc at the cell surface, an increase of PrPc levels recovered in culture medium, and an internalization of antibodies. In contradiction with previous results, we show that the cleaning mechanism seems to be epitope-independent and more likely reflects a global effect on the PrP trafficking and/or transconformation process. Reagents and Antibodies—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with l-glutamine, modified Eagle's medium with l-glutamine, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fetal calf serum, trypsin, and Geneticin were from Invitrogen. The Bio-Rad purification kit (TeSeE® containing proteinase K (PK), buffer A, and buffer B) was used for purification of PrPSc. Doxycycline and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Enzyme immunometric assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates (Immunoplate Maxisorb, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) using specialized microtitration equipment (washer ELX 405 from Bio Tek Instruments, Inc. and a plate reader from Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). Cell dissociation buffer (without trypsin) used for cytometry experiments was from Sigma. Phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM immunoglobulins were from Beckman Coulter. Monoclonal anti-PrP antibodies (mAbs) were produced in our laboratory. They were all raised in PrP0/0 mice by immunizing with either PrP peptides, recombinant PrP or scrapie-associated fibrils (SAFs). Some mAbs have already been described (38Demart S. Fournier J.G. Creminon C. Frobert Y. Lamoury F. Marce D. Lasmezas C. Dormont D. Grassi J. Deslys J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 652-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Those tested during this study are fully described in Table I. mAbs were purified using either caprylic acid precipitation (39Reik L.M. Maines S.L. Ryan D.E. Levin W. Bandiera S. Thomas P.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 100: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) or protein A affinity chromatography. Epitope mapping for identifying linear epitopes possibly recognized by mAbs was performed as described in Morel et al. (40Morel N. Simon S. Frobert Y. Volland H. Mourton-Gilles C. Negro A.

Lehmann and H. Laude/D. Vilette, respectively. N2a cells were stably transfected with a plasmid carrying wild-type mouse prnp cDNA (41Shyng S.L. Lehmann S. Moulder K.L. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30221-30229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 42Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). N2a58 subclone, overexpressing murine PrP, was chronically infected with 22L mouse-adapted scrapie strain (43Nishida N. Harris D.A. Vilette D. Laude H. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Casanova D. Milhavet O. Lehmann S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Non-infected N2a58 and infected N2a22L cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with l-glutamine supplemented with 10% PrP-depleted fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and once a month with 300 μg/ml Geneticin. The cells were split in a ¼ dilution every 3 or 4 days. Rov9 cells were transfected with a plasmid carrying the VRQ allele of ovine prnp cDNA. Doxycycline-induced Rov9 subclone was infected with PG127 natural scrapie isolate (44Vilette D. Andreoletti O. Archer F. Madelaine M.F. Vilotte J.L. Lehmann S. Laude H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4055-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Non-infected and infected Rov9 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with l-glutamine supplemented with 10% PrP-depleted fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 μg/ml doxycycline. They were usually split every week in a 1:8 ratio. All cultured cells were maintained at 37 °C in 6% CO2. PrPc was removed from fetal calf serum by passing the serum through a Sepharose 4B affinity column containing mAb SAF32. Screening Procedure—The screening was performed by incubating infected and non-infected N2a or Rov9 cells for 3 days or 1 week, respectively, in the presence of a 10 μg/ml concentration of purified monoclonal antibody in 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) containing 3 ml of supplemented medium. Antibodies were added to the cell culture medium after cell splitting. At the end of the 3- or 7-day period confluent cells were washed in PBS and collected. Cell pellets were stored at –80 °C and used within a month. The total protein concentration of cells extracted with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) was measured with the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA, Pierce). Samples of equal protein amount and volume (40 μg of total protein in 200 μl final of PBS) were used to determine PrPSc cellular content with the Bio-Rad purification kit followed by a two-site immunometric assay. In detail, selective purification of cellular PrPSc was achieved by adding 200 μl of buffer A containing 10 or 40 μg of PK/mg of total protein for N2a cells or Rov9 cells, respectively, and by incubating each sample at 37 °C for 15 min. Two hundred microliters of precipitating buffer B were then added to each sample and mixed gently by inversion. Selective concentration of PrPSc was achieved by a 10-min centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the PrPSc was denatured with 25 μl of 4 m urea for 10 min at 100 °C. After incubation, each sample was vortexed, and 400 μl of EIA buffer (0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.01% sodium azide) were added per tube. In addition to PrPSc determination, cell-associated PrPc and total cell-associated PrP were measured. For cell-associated PrPc determination, lysed cells were diluted in EIA buffer until 100 μl contained 2 μg of total protein. For total cell-associated PrP determination, the same dilution was performed on lysed cells previously denatured (v/v) in 8 m urea for 10 min at 100 °C. Detections of PrPSc, PrPc, and total denatured PrP were then achieved by means of an appropriate immunoassay described in the next paragraph. Two-site Immunometric Assay—96-Well microtiter plates (Immunoplate, Maxisorp, Nunc) were coated with the captured IgG2a purified monoclonal anti-PrP antibody 11C6 at a 10 μg/ml concentration. The plates were then saturated with EIA buffer and stored at 4 °C until use. One hundred microliters of the different samples (containing 10 μg of total protein for PrPSc determination, 2 μg of total protein for cell-associated PrPc or total PrP determination, and 40 μg of non-denatured or urea-denatured total protein for cell culture medium PrP determination) were dispensed into the wells and reacted for 2 h at room temperature. After 3 washes plates were reacted overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl/well of a 4 units/ml tracer antibody corresponding to either SAF83 covalently coupled to AchE (EC 3.1.1.7, as described previously by Grassi et al. (45Grassi J. Frobert Y. Pradelles P. Chercuitte F. Gruaz D. Dayer J.M. Poubelle P.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 123: 193-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar)) for N2a cell PrP determination or BAR224 AchE for Rov9 cell PrP determination. After 6 washes, solid phase-bound AchE activity was assessed by the colorimetric method of Ellman (46Grassi J. Creminon C. Frobert Y. Fretier P. Turbica I. Rezaei H. Hunsmann G. Comoy E. Deslys J.P. Arch. Virol. 2000; 16: 197-205Google Scholar) performed as described previously, and absorbances at 414 nm were measured with an automatic reader (Labsystem). Concentration-dependent Inhibition and Co-treatment Inhibition— N2a22L cells plated in 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) were incubated with one (concentration-dependent inhibition) or two (co-treatment) purified mAbs at various concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 50 μg/ml over 3 days. At the end of this period cells were collected, and PrPSc, PrPc, and denatured PrP cellular contents were determined as described above. Cell culture media were also collected at the end of the 3-day period, and samples of equal protein amount and volume (40 μg of non-denatured or urea-denatured total protein in 100 μl of EIA buffer/well) were used to determine PrPc content in cell culture medium (same sandwich immunoassay and procedure as described above). Time-course Inhibition—5 × 105 N2a cells plated in 25-cm2 flasks were incubated for 11 days in the presence of a 10 μg/ml concentration of purified and sterile monoclonal anti-PrP mAbs. Antibodies were then removed from the culture, and cells were passaged for an additional period of 17 days without antibodies. Every 3 or 4 days confluent cells were serially split into a flask (used for the prolongation of the treatment with the antibodies), and a 6-well plate was used for sandwich immunoassay analysis. Antibodies were added to the culture medium after cell splitting. PrPSc, PrPc, and denatured PrP cellular content and medium PrPc content were measured as described above. Cytometry Measurements—For the screening procedure, infected or non-infected confluent cells in 75-cm2 flasks were washed with PBS and collected after incubation at 37 °C for 5 min with 5 ml of cell dissociation buffer (without trypsin, Sigma). Samples of 50 μl containing 5 × 105 N2a or Rov9 cells were incubated with the primary antibody (5 or 10 μl at 50 μg/ml, quantities to be in excess for cellular prion staining) for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. After washes, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody, phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or IgM immunoglobulin (Beckman Coulter, 100-fold dilution), for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. Negative controls included cells that had not been incubated with primary and secondary antibodies (autofluorescence), cells incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody alone, and cells incubated with an isotypic control primary antibody and phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody. Isotypic control antibodies were irrelevant purified mAbs: αIL1–101 for IgG1 (anti-α-interleukin), NSP-11 for IgG2a (anti-substance P), G1–5 for IgG2b (anti-G monomer of AchE), NSP-20 for Ig3 (anti-substance P), and NSP-48 for IgM (anti-substance P). On completion of washing samples were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS and immediately analyzed in a flow cytometer (Epics XL, Beckman Coulter) equipped with a 488-nm argon laser, previously calibrated with flow check beads (Beckman Coulter). For experiments aiming at studying the effect of the antibodies on the amount of cell-surface PrPc, infected and non-infected N2a cells plated in 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) were incubated for 3 days in the presence or absence of a 10 μg/ml concentration of purified mAbs. At the end of this period cells were washed and collected, and 5 × 105 cells were reacted with a mAb labeled with fluorescein and presenting a binding compatible with the antibody used for the treatment (either with fluorescein-conjugated SAF34 or Sha31 reacted for 20 min at room temperature in the dark). Sample data were acquired under control by a computer equipped with software (System 2, Beckman Coulter). For each sample studied at least 10,000 living cells were analyzed by appropriate gating to exclude dea"

We report a novel phospholipase C that hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine and is greatly induced in response to phosphate deprivation in Arabidopsis. Since phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing activity by phospholipase C was highly up-regulated in phosphate-deprived plants, gene expression of some phospholipase C was expected to be induced during phosphate starvation. Based on amino acid sequence similarity to a bacterial phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C, six putative phospholipase Cs were identified in the Arabidopsis genome, one of which, NPC4, showed significant transcriptional activation upon phosphate limitation. Molecular cloning and functional expression of NPC4 confirmed that the NPC4 gene encoded a functional phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C that did not require Ca2+ for its activity. Subcellular localization analysis showed that NPC4 protein was highly enriched in the plasma membrane. Analyses of transferred DNA-tagged npc4 mutants revealed that disruption of NPC4 severely reduces the phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C activity in response to phosphate starvation. These results suggest that NPC4 plays an important role in the supply of both inorganic phosphate and diacylglycerol from membrane-localized phospholipids that would be used for phosphate supplementation and the replacement of polar lipids in the root plasma membrane during phosphate deprivation.

Phosphorus is an essential element for plant growth, development, and reproduction. It plays decisive roles not only in regulation of various enzymes but also in constitutive components such as membrane phospholipids and nucleic acids. In most soils, despite its abundance, phosphorus is not freely available for assimilation by roots (1Raghothama K.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 665-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Therefore, plants have developed distinct systems to cope with phosphate deficiency.When plants suffer from phosphate limitation, highly integrated systems are activated both for assimilation of Pi and supplementation of Pi from innermost phosphorus storage. The former action is represented by a morphological modification of root architecture upon Pi starvation, which presumably facilitates Pi uptake by enlargement of absorptive root surface areas (2Lynch J.P. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the latter has been described by the dynamic evolution of metabolism that is altered toward the supply of free Pi. During Pi starvation, overall phospholipid content that corresponds to 30% of total Pi storage is decreased, and conversely, contents of nonphosphorus galactolipid, digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), 1The abbreviations used are: DGDG, digalactosyldiacylglycerol; DAG, 1,2-sn-diacylglycerol; MAG, monoacylglycerol; MGDG, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol; n-BuOH, n-butyl alcohol; NPC, nonspecific phospholipase C; PA, phosphatidic acid; PAQ, plasma membrane aquaporin; PBu, phosphatidylbutanol; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PC-PLC phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PI-PLC, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C; PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; T-DNA, transferred DNA.1The abbreviations used are: DGDG, digalactosyldiacylglycerol; DAG, 1,2-sn-diacylglycerol; MAG, monoacylglycerol; MGDG, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol; n-BuOH, n-butyl alcohol; NPC, nonspecific phospholipase C; PA, phosphatidic acid; PAQ, plasma membrane aquaporin; PBu, phosphatidylbutanol; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PC-PLC phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PI-PLC, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C; PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; T-DNA, transferred DNA. increase significantly (3Ha ̈rtel H. Do ̈rmann P. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10649-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Galactolipids such as monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and DGDG are ubiquitous in plants, but are typically found only in plastids, especially in photosynthetic membranes (4Joyard J. Mare ́chal E. Mie ́ge C. Block M.A. Dorne A.-J. Douce R. Lipids in Photosynthesis: Structure, Function, and Genetics. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 21-52Google Scholar). These galactolipids are synthesized by the galactosylation of diacylglycerol (DAG) by MGDG synthase and DGDG synthase in the plastid envelope membranes. During Pi starvation, however, the increased DGDG is reported to accumulate in extraplastidic membranes (3Ha ̈rtel H. Do ̈rmann P. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10649-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), replacing most of the constitutive phospholipids in the root plasma membrane (5Andersson M.X. Stridh M.H. Larsson K.E. Liljenberg C. Sandelius A.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 537: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In this context, a phospholipid hydrolysis for DAG production is considered as a key step that provides a valuable Pi source and the primary substrate for galactolipid biosynthesis under Pi starvation.A recent study showed that, in response to Pi deprivation, transient increase in phosphatidylcholine (PC) content was followed by its rapid decrease and a concomitant increase of both DAG and DGDG (6Jouhet J. Mare ́chal E. Bligny R. Joyard J. Block M.A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This newly accumulated DAG had a fatty acid composition very similar to that of PC, suggesting that it is derived mainly from PC. Although some studies have reported a PC-hydrolyzing activity that yields DAG in plants (7Kates M. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1955; 33: 575-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Strauss H.

Commun. 2002; 293: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), molecular biological analysis for such activity has not yet been reported (6Jouhet J. Mare ́chal E. Bligny R. Joyard J. Block M.A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12Wang X. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 211-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In addition, it is unclear whether the reaction is mediated by the direct hydrolysis by a phospholipase C (PLC) or an indirect two-step production, the first step by a phospholipase D (PLD) that yields phosphatidic acid (PA) and the second step of PA dephosphorylation mediated by a PA phosphatase.In this report, we cloned a novel PLC from Arabidopsis thaliana, designated nonspecific phospholipase C4 (NPC4), which was prominently induced during Pi starvation. On the basis of detailed analyses, this novel enzyme was shown to play a functional role in the phosphate starvation-inducible PC hydrolysis for Pi and DAG supply in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlant Material and Treatments—A. thaliana (Columbia-0) was used in this study. For Pi deprivation experiments, plants were prepared according to Härtel et al. (3Ha ̈rtel H. Do ̈rmann P. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10649-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In brief, seeds were germinated on Murashige and Skoog medium (13Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (53131) Google Scholar) under continuous light at 22 °C. Ten-day-old plants were transferred onto either Pi-deprived or replete medium and grown for the necessary duration. For subcellular fractionation, 10-day-old seedlings were subjected to Pi starvation for another 10 days in a liquid Murashige and Skoog medium.Assay for Phospholipid-hydrolyzing Activity—Total proteins of each sample were extracted with assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol). Protein concentration in the enzyme extracts was quantified by the method of Bensadoun and Weinstein (14Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Fifty microliters of protein extract was mixed with 100 μl of substrate solution and 50 μl of assay buffer. The substrate solution was prepared as follows. Forty-five nanocuries of l-3-PC, 1,2-di[1-14C]palmitoyl (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was dispersed together with 18 nmol of l-3-PC, 1,2-dipalmitoyl, in 100 μl of suspension buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 0.25% (w/v) deoxycholate). As for phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), PA, or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), l-3-PE, 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]linoleoyl (Amersham Biosciences), l-3-PA[glycerol-14C(U)], 1,2-dipalmitoyl, (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or PIP2, myo-inositol-2-3H, (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) together with l-3-PE, dipalmitoyl, l-3-PA, dipalmitoyl, or PIP2, respectively, were used. For assays in the presence of EGTA or n-butyl alcohol (n-BuOH), 50 μl of EGTA or n-BuOH dissolved in the assay buffer was added instead of assay buffer to make the final concentration 2 mm (EGTA) or 0.75% (v/v; n-BuOH), respectively. The assay was initiated by vigorous vortex of protein extract and substrate solution, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by vigorous vortex with 0.5 ml of ethyl acetate and centrifuged twice at 1,500 × g for 5 min with 0.5 ml of 0.45% NaCl. The upper layer was dried and dissolved in 40 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) for one-dimensional TLC analyses. The product solutions were developed in petroleum ether/ethyl ether/acetic acid (50:50:1, v/v/v) for DAG isolation and ethyl acetate/iso-octane/formic acid/water (13:2:3:10, v/v/v/v) for isolation of PA, phosphatidylbutanol (PBu), or other polar lipids. Radioactive spots were quantitatively analyzed by Image Plate (Fuji Photofilm, Tokyo, Japan) and Image Analyzer (Storm; Amersham Biosciences). For assay with PIP2, incubation was stopped with ethyl acetate 10 min after the addition of enzyme, the lower layer of reaction product was extracted, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting.Enzyme Activity Assay of NPC4 Expressed in E. coli—NPC4 was amplified by PCR using LA-Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) and specific primers designed for NPC4 (AGGCCTATGATCGAGACGACCAAAGGC and AGGCCTTTCAATCATGGCGAATAAAGCAAGAG). The PCR product was cloned into pPICT2 vector (15Kawaguchi J. Kii I. Sugiyama Y. Takeshita S. Kudo A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) by a TA cloning method to screen a clone with correct nucleic acid sequence. Then the fragment was further cloned into pET24b(+) expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI). When the A600 of E. coli culture reached around 0.4, the culture was treated with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated for 12 h at 20 °C to induce the expression of NPC4. Cells were collected by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 1 min) and suspended in the assay buffer to lyse the cells by sonication (output 2, duty 60, 3 s, five times; Ultrasonic Disruptor UD-201; TOMY, Tokyo, Japan). The lysed cell suspension was centrifuged (1,500 × g, 10 min), and supernatant was used for an enzyme activity assay as described above.Northern Blot Hybridization—Total RNA was prepared from A. thaliana grown either on Pi-deprived or -replete medium using the RNA-easy preparation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Two micrograms of RNAs were run in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 1.25% agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were probed with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled DNA that specifically recognizes each NPC. Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C with Church phosphate buffer (16Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7258) Google Scholar), and probed membranes were washed twice with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min. Hybridized RNA bands were visualized by Image Plate (Fuji Photofilm, Tokyo, Japan) and an Image Analyzer (Storm; Amersham Biosciences).Preparation of Anti-NPC4 Antibody and Western Blot Analyses—To avoid a cross-detection with NPC5, which shows markedly high amino acid similarity to NPC4, a polypeptide consisting of the C-terminal 120 amino acid residues of NPC4 was used to raise an anti-NPC4 polyclonal antibody in rabbits. A polynucleotide sequence that corresponds to the polypeptide was amplified with specific primers (CATATGGGGACAATGGCAAAAGAAAATGCA and CTCGAGATCATGGCGAATAAAGCAAGAGAA) and cloned into pET24a(+) to express it as a His-tagged polypeptide in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Cells were lysed, and supernatant was purified with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix (Invitrogen). The purified protein was further separated by SDS-PAGE to eliminate any minor contamination. Four milligrams of purified polypeptide was used to raise a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Kitayama Labes, Nagano, Japan).For Western blot analyses, 50 μg of proteins were separated by 12.5% acrylamide SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PROTORAN nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). NPC4 was detected with the antibody at a 1:1,000 dilution by using a secondary antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase. Preimmune sera gave no signal. For plasma membrane marker, plasma membrane aquaporin (PAQ) antibody (17Ohshima Y. Iwasaki I. Suga S. Murakami M. Inoue K. Maeshima M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was used at a 1:1,000 dilution.Isolation of Plasma Membrane—Cellular membranes were prepared as described previously with minor modifications (18Schaller G.E. DeWitt N.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 129-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Liquid-grown Arabidopsis plants that suffered 10-day Pi starvation were homogenized in a mortar with 2 ml of homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 50 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Homogenates were filtrated through Miracloth (Calbiochem) and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 30 min to pellet microsomes. The remaining supernatant contains primarily soluble proteins. An aqueous two-phase system (19Larsson C. Widell S. Kjellbom P.

Total microsomes were resuspended in 500 μl of SPK buffer (0.33 m sucrose, 5 mm potassium phosphate, and 3 mm KCl, pH 7.8) and added to a 4-g phase system prepared in the same buffer. The final composition of the phase system was 6.3% (w/w) dextran (Mr 413,000) and 6.3% (w/w) polyethylene glycol (Mr 3,350). After thorough mixing by inverting the tube 20–30 times, the phases were separated by centrifugation at 1,400 × g for 5 min. The upper phase, enriched in plasma membrane, was transferred to a clean tube and repartitioned twice with lower phase. Fresh upper phase was centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 30 min again to pellet plasma membrane. All procedures were conducted at 4 °C.Isolation of Intact Chloroplast—Intact chloroplasts were isolated basically according to Douce and Joyard (20Douce R. Joyard J.

Awai K. Masuda T. Shimada H. Takamiya K. Ohta H. Lipids. 2003; 38: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, total lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar) and separated by two-dimensional TLC with the following solvent systems: chloroform/methanol/7 n ammonia (120:80:8, v/v/v) and chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (170:20:15:3, v/v/v/v). Each lipid was collected separately from TLC plates and then hydrolyzed and methylesterified together with 100 μl of 1 mm pentadecanoic acid (internal standard) by 5% HCl in methanol at 85 °C for 150 min to obtain fatty acid methyl esters. Fatty acid composition was determined with gas chromatography (GC14 gas chromatograph, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan; ULBON HR-SS-10 capillary column, 25 m × 0.25 mm, Shinwa Chemical Industries, Kyoto, Japan), and then the amounts of each lipid were calculated.RESULTSPC-hydrolyzing Activity Mediated by a Novel PLC Was Up-regulated during Pi Starvation—To investigate whether PC-hydrolyzing activity is induced under Pi deprivation, both 10-day Pi-deprived or replete plants were analyzed with radiolabeled PC as a substrate. First, we measured radioactive recovery in possible derivatives of PC, namely DAG, PA, lyso-PA, monoacylglycerol (MAG), and free fatty acid by TLC. After a 1-h incubation of crude enzyme extract with radiolabeled PC, we found that production of radioactive DAG is highly induced by Pi starvation (Fig. 1A). Production of radioactive MAG and free fatty acid also increased in response to Pi starvation, although to a much lower extent than DAG. Those increases occurred concomitantly with that of DAG, suggesting that DAG is subsequently deacylated by an acylhydrolase activity present in the reaction mixture. As for the radioactivity in PA and lyso-PA, they were low and not significantly changed between Pi-starved and -replete plants. These results suggest that PC is mainly converted to DAG in Pi-deprived plants. We also compared DAG-producing activity of crude extract from shoots and roots. As seen in Fig. 1B, production of radiolabeled DAG was strongly induced by phosphate starvation, especially in roots, whereas there was no difference between roots and shoots in Pi-replete plants. Therefore, the activity to produce DAG from PC is highly up-regulated specifically in roots during phosphate starvation.As mentioned in the Introduction, two pathways are considered for the production of DAG from PC; one is by a PLC, whereas the other is a combinatory two-step reaction by PLD and PA phosphatase. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate which pathway is responsible for PC hydrolysis upon Pi starvation. To monitor PLD activity, it is suitable to employ the distinct property of transphosphatidylation (24Yang S.F. Freer S. Benson A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 477-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLD is reported to preferentially select n-BuOH as a substrate over H2O, and thus PLD activity in the presence of n-BuOH results in the accumulation of PBu (25Munnik T. Arisz S.A. Vrije T. Musgrave A. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 2197-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). PC hydrolysis of Pi-starved root extract showed considerable accumulation of PBu in the presence of 0.75% n-BuOH (Fig. 1C). However, it was not obviously induced upon Pi starvation compared with the PC-hydrolyzing activity in Fig. 1B. The DAG-producing activity was not affected by the addition of n-BuOH, although PA production from PC was suppressed in part under this condition (data not shown). Therefore, PLD activity is not significantly induced by phosphate limitation. Indeed, Northern blot analyses showed that five representative PLDs so far cloned from Arabidopsis (PLDα1, PLDβ1, PLDγ1, PLDδ, and PLDζ1) were not transcriptionally activated upon Pi deficiency (data not shown). According to these results, the high DAG-producing activity in response to Pi deprivation is mainly mediated not by PLD but by PLC. Although two PLCs have been cloned and characterized in Arabidopsis, they are categorized as phosphoinositide-specific PLCs (PI-PLC) that have substrate preference for phosphoinositides, not for constitutive phospholipids such as PC (26Hirayama T. Ohto C. Mizoguchi T. Shinozaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3903-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 27Hirayama T. Mitsukawa N. Shibata D. Shinozaki K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 34: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This strongly implied the existence of a novel PLC that could hydrolyze PC.Identification of Six Putative Homologues of a Bacterial PC-PLC in Arabidopsis—In order to identify the novel PC-hydrolyzing PLC (PC-PLC) in Arabidopsis, we referred to the bacterial PC-PLCs. To date, several types of PC-PLC have been cloned and characterized from a wide variety of bacteria (28Titball R.W. Symp. Ser. Soc. Appl. Microbiol. 1998; 84: 127S-137SGoogle Scholar). Among them, homologous genes to that of Ralstonia solanacearum or Mycobacterium tuberculosis were found in the Arabidopsis genome as well as that of other higher plants. Based on the amino acid sequence similarity to Ralstonian PC-PLC (protein accession number NP_518440), six putative PLCs were newly identified in Arabidopsis using a BLAST data base search provided by TAIR (available on the World Wide Web at www.arabidopsis.org/). They were numerically named A. thaliana nonspecific phospholipase C1 to -6 (AtNPC1 to -6) by MIPS code number (Table I). These NPCs are ∼60-kDa proteins consisting of 514–538 amino acid residues. NPC1 and NPC2 are located on chromosome I and II, respectively, whereas others are on chromosome III. In particular, NPC3, -4, and -5 are positioned in tandem. The amino acid identities among these isogenes vary from 52.8% (NPC3 and NPC6) to 64.2% (NPC3 and NPC4) except for a prominently higher identity of 84.7% between NPC4 and NPC5. A multiple alignment of AtNPCs and bacterial PC-PLC (M. tuberculosis, Swissprot accession number P95246) (29Johansen K.A. Gill R.E. Vasil M.L. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3259-3266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that there are three domains highly conserved among bacteria and plants, but none corresponded to any known motifs (Fig. 2). Comparison of the domain organization of AtNPCs with that of PI-PLC showed that there are no domains similar to the X,Y-domains or EF-hand motif in PI-PLC. Furthermore, a Ca2+-binding or lipid-binding motif, such as the C2 domain, PX/PH domains, or IYIENQFF motif in the Arabidopsis PLD family was not found by data base search (MOTIF; available on the World Wide Web at motif.genome.ad.jp). Hydropathy plots of NPC1 to -6 revealed no apparent membrane-spanning domains, suggesting that they are soluble or membrane-associated proteins. Among the six isozymes, NPC1, -2, and -6 have putative transit peptides that were predicted to be signal peptide for the secretory pathway by the TargetP program (available on the World Wide Web at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/). The Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing data base (available on the World Wide Web at mpss.udel.edu/at/GeneAnalysis.php/) showed that several NPCs had relatively high expression levels in nonphotosynthetic organs: NPC1 in floral organs, NPC6 in floral organs and siliques, and NPC3/4 in roots. The expression levels of NPC2 and -5 are too low to discern significant differences among organs. Unlike PI-PLC that hydrolyzes only a small portion of membrane lipids, PC-PLC is capable of hydrolyzing the major component of cellular membranes. Since nonphotosynthetic organs like flowers have considerably high membrane lipid biosynthetic activities (22Nakamura Y. Arimitsu H. Yamaryo Y. Awai K. Masuda T. Shimada H. Takamiya K. Ohta H. Lipids. 2003; 38: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Kobayashi K. Awai K. Takamiya K. Ohta H. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 640-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), some of these NPCs might play roles in the lipid turnover or membrane degradation in such organs.Table IArabidopsis NPC family: gene loci, molecular weights, and their predicted localizationNameGene locusaInformation of the gene locus is from the Institute for Genomic Research data base (available on the world wide web at www.tigr.org/).Protein accessionbGiven by NCBI Protein Database (available on the world wide web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/).Amino acidMolecular massLocalizationcPredicted by the TargetP program (available on the world wide web at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP).

As shown in Fig. 3, only expression of NPC4 was markedly induced upon Pi starvation. This induction was detected both in roots and shoots (data not shown), although stronger PC-hydrolyzing activity was observed in roots (Fig. 1A). The analysis further revealed that this induction was observed when Pi concentration in the medium fell to less than 0.1 mm (Fig. 3A). A time course experiment showed that NPC4 was highly induced 6 days after Pi starvation (Fig. 3B), which matched well that of Pi deficiency-inducible galactolipid synthase genes such as MGD2/3 (31Awai K. Mare ́chal E. Block M.A. Brun D. Masuda T. Shimada H. Takamiya K. Ohta H. Joyard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10960-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These results suggest that NPC4 is a strong candidate for a Pi starvation-inducible PC-PLC.Fig. 3Northern blot analysis of NPC4 expression in response to Pi limitation.

https://openalex.org/W2053031729,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are suggested to play a critical role in extracellular matrix degradation and remodeling during inflammation and wound healing processes. However, the role of MMPs in indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer and its healing process are not clearly understood. This study is aimed at determining the regulation of MMP-9 and -2 activities in indomethacin-induced acute gastric ulceration and healing. Indomethacin-ulcerated stomach extracts exhibit significant up-regulation of pro-MMP-9 (92 kDa) activity and moderate reduction of MMP-2 activity, which strongly correlate with indomethacin dose and severity of ulcer. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of curcumin, an active component of turmeric, suggest that curcumin may exert antiulcer activity through scavenging reactive oxygen species, by regulating MMP activity, or both. To test these possibilities, the effect of curcumin in indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer is examined by biochemical and histological methods. The results show that curcumin exhibits potent antiulcer activity in acute ulcer in rat model by preventing glutathione depletion, lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation. Denudation of epithelial cells during damage of gastric lumen is reversed by curcumin through re-epithelialization. Furthermore, both oral and intraperitoneal administration of curcumin blocks gastric ulceration in a dose-dependent manner. It accelerates the healing process and protects gastric ulcer through attenuation of MMP-9 activity and amelioration of MMP-2 activity. Omeprazole, an established antiulcer drug does not inhibit MMP-9 while protecting indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer. We conclude that antiulcer activity of curcumin is primarily attributed to MMP-9 inhibition, one of the major path-ways of ulcer healing.

Healing of ulcer encompasses a complex series of cell/matrix interaction involving cellular proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Wound formation and the healing thereof are dynamic processes of ECM remodeling that are mainly influenced by MMPs and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). MMPs are a growing family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that selectively degrade components of ECM (1Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5031) Google Scholar). The catalytic activities of MMPs are highly regulated at multiple levels, including gene expression, spatial localization, zymogen activation, and inhibition by TIMPs (2Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, New York1998Google Scholar). MMPs especially pro-MMP-2 (72-kDa gelatinase A) and pro-MMP-9 (92-kDa gelatinase B) as well as their active forms are responsible for regulating most of the turnover of matrix proteins because they together are capable of degrading basement membrane proteins like gelatin, collagen IV, collagen V, elastin, and fibronectin (2Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, New York1998Google Scholar). Interestingly, MMP-9 remains as zymogen under identical cellular conditions where a majority of co-expressed pro-MMP-2 is activated via the cell surface mechanism (1Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev.

Although MMP-2 appears to be constitutively expressed by many cell types in culture, MMP-9 expression is induced by cytokines (4Magid R. Murphy T.J. Galis Z.S. J. Biol.

Indomethacin, a NSAID, causes gastric lesions through a number of mechanisms including inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, increased expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and induction of apoptosis (7Miller T.A.

Increased lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and depletion of glutathione are the major indications of the oxidative damage of the gastric mucosal cells by indomethacin (8Yoshikawa T. Naito Y.

MMP-1 concentration is found to be significantly higher in H. pylori-induced ulcer compared with that of NSAIDs ulcer (12Menges M. Chan C.C. Zeitz M. Stallmach A. Z. Gastroenterol. 2000; 38: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The roles for ECM proteins and ECM degrading enzymes (i.e. MMPs) in gastric ulceration have been implicated in few reports during the last few years (15Shahin M. Konturek J.W. Pohle T. Schuppan D. Herbst H. Domschke W. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2001; 53: 396-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Ernst H. Grunert S. Schneider H.T. Beck W.S. Brune K. Hahn E.G. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1995; 30: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but the mechanistic basis is not very clear today. MMP-2 has been suggested to participate in the physiological turnover of the gastric ECM, whereas MMP-9 may be important in the early phase of indomethacin-induced chronic gastric ulcers (13Lempinen M. Inkinen K. Wolff H. Ahonen J. Eur. Surg. Res. 2000; 32: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Very recently, Mori et al. (17Mori N. Sato H. Hayashibara T. Senba M. Geleziunas R. Wada A. Hirayama T. Yamamoto N. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 983-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) reported MMP-9 induction through activation of NF-κB in H. pylori-infected cultured gastric mucosal cells. Literature is also very scanty regarding the role of MMPs and TIMPs during the healing process of the gastric ulcer (18Baragi V.M. Qiu L. Gunja-Smith Z. Woessner J.F.J. Lesch C.A. Guglietta A. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1997; 32: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The roles of MMPs in ulcer development and healing have been demonstrated only in the acetic acid-induced gastric ulcer model (18Baragi V.M. Qiu L. Gunja-Smith Z. Woessner J.F.J. Lesch C.A. Guglietta A. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1997; 32: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The objective of the present study is to investigate in detail the expression and activities of MMP-9 and -2 during indomethacin-induced gastric ulceration and its healing by curcumin. Although the efficacy and safety of omeprazole used for the healing of gastroduodenal ulcers caused by NSAIDs are well established (19Langtry H.D. Wilde M.I. Drugs. 1998; 56: 447-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Some shortcomings have also been reported (20Tytgat G.N. Eur. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2001; 1: S29-S33Google Scholar, 21Klinkenberg-Knol E.C. Nelis F. Dent J. Snel P. Mitchell B. Prichard P. Lloyd D. Havu N. Frame M.H. Roman J. Walan A. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 661-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The quality of healing remains crucial for preventing recurrence (22Wallace J.L. Am. J. Med. 2001; 110: 19S-23SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because ulcer recurs with various adverse side effects when common antiulcer drugs, such as omeprazole, ranitidine, famotidine, etc. are used. Considering these limitations, a search for an alternative nontoxic antiulcer compound is always welcome. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a bioactive constituent from Curcuma longa possesses remarkable anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticarcinogenic properties (23Ruby A.J. Kuttan G. Babu K.D. Rajasekharan K.N. Kuttan R. Cancer Lett. 1995; 94: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 24Surh Y.J. Food Chem. Toxicol. 2002; 40: 1091-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). This compound has been shown to inhibit the expression of a sequence of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1, or IL-8 (24Surh Y.J. Food Chem. Toxicol. 2002; 40: 1091-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Curcumin is a potential scavenger of oxidized free radicals, and it also increases the level of glutathione during apoptosis (25Jaruga E. Salvioli S. Dobrucki J. Chru S. Bandorowicz-Pikula Sickora E. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. Bartosz G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant states are closely linked to ulcer development, a polyphenolic compound like curcumin having potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities is anticipated to exert an antiulcer effect. Based on its ethnopharmacological studies and medicinal use in traditional practice (24Surh Y.J. Food Chem. Toxicol. 2002; 40: 1091-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), the present study is undertaken to examine the gastroprotective and ulcer healing effect of curcumin in indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer and its healing process with special emphasis on the regulation of MMP-9 and -2 activities. Evidence has been presented to show that curcumin not only protects gastric mucosal cell damage and oxidative insult, but it also regulates expression and activities of MMPs during protection and healing of indomethacin-induced gastric damage. Our studies have revealed for the first time the antiulcer activity of curcumin and its mechanism of action that blocks gastric damage by inhibiting the up-regulation of MMP-9 and down-regulation of MMP-2. Furthermore, characterization of ulcer prevention by omeprazole showed its properties to be distinct from curcumin and to involve the MMP-9-independent pathway. This finding identifies the MMP-9-dependent pathway in addition to the MMP-independent pathway for ulceration. Chemicals—Gelatin from porcine skin, indomethacin, curcumin, Triton X-100, protease inhibitors mixture, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium solution were obtained from Sigma. MMP-9 and MMP-2 were purchased from Chemicon. Polyclonal goat antihuman anti-MMP-9 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz. Omeprazole was purchased from Ranbaxy (Mumbai, India). Animals Used—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (180–220 g) bred inhouse with free access to food and water were used for all of the experiments. All of the rats were kept in 12-h light/dark cycles and housed at 25 °C room temperature. All of the experiments were designed to minimize animal suffering and to use the minimum number associated with valid statistical evaluation. The animals were anesthetized by ketamine (12 mg kg-1 body weight) followed by cervical dislocation for killing. The animal experiments (n = 12) were conducted in accordance to the guidelines of the animal ethics committee of the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology. Indomethacin-induced Gastric Ulceration and Its Protection Studies—Before ulcer induction animals of both control and experimental groups kept separately in standard controlled conditions were fasted for 24 h with free access to water. Acute gastric ulcers were induced by oral administration of indomethacin at a dose of 48 mg kg-1 body weight and rats were sacrificed after 4 h of indomethacin treatment. The control group received the vehicle only, whereas the experimental group received indomethacin for gastric ulceration. After 4 h, the animals were sacrificed, and gastric lesions in the fundic stomach were scored and expressed as ulcer index (26Biswas K. Bandyopadhyay U. Chattopadhyay I. Varadaraj A. Ali E.

Chem. 2003; 278: 10993-11001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) as follows: 0 = no pathology; 1 = a small pinhead ulcer spot; and 2–5 = a bandlike lesion of 2–5 mm length (26Biswas K.

The sum of the total scores divided by the number of animals is expressed as the mean ulcer index. Curcumin was administered intraperitoneally or orally 30 min prior to indomethacin treatment to see the gastroprotective effect. Omeprazole and Me2SO were administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 15 mg kg-1 body weight and 3 ml kg-1 body weight, respectively. Histological Analysis—After scoring the ulcer index, the fundic stomach was sectioned for histological studies. The tissue samples were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. The sections (5 μm) were cut using microtome, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (27Morise Z. Komatsu S. Fuseler J.W. Granger D.N. Perry M. Issekutz A.C. Grisham M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G246-G252PubMed Google Scholar), and assessed under an Olympus microscope (1 × 70). Images were captured using Camedia software (E-20P 5.0 Megapixel) and processed using Adobe Photoshop version 6.0. Measurement of GSH Level—Fundic stomach homogenate was made in 0.2 m Tris, pH 8.2, containing 20 mm EDTA and centrifuged. An aliquot of 1.0 ml of homogenate was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged. The supernatant (1.0 ml) was added to 2.0 ml of 0.8 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, containing 20 mm EDTA (28Sedlak J. Lindsay R.H. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (6380) Google Scholar) and mixed with 0.1 ml of 10 mm 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid. The intense yellow color of nitromercaptobenzoate was read at 412 nm. For calibration, a standard curve was prepared treating varied concentrations of reduced glutathione with 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid under identical conditions. Measurement of Lipid Peroxidation—The mitochondrial membrane fraction from the fundic stomach homogenate was used for measurement of lipid peroxide content as thiobarbituric acid reactive species (29Ohkawa H. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (22506) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of the membrane fraction was allowed to react with 2 ml of 15% trichloroacetic acid, 0.375% thiobarbituric acid, 0.25 n HCl reagent, heated in a boiling water bath for 15 min, cooled, and centrifuged. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 535 nm, and the number of nmol of thiobarbituric acid reactive species produced was determined from a standard curve using tetraethoxypropane as standard. Measurement of Protein Carbonyl Content—Protein oxidation was measured as carbonyl content in the low speed supernatant of the fundic stomach homogenate (26Biswas K. Bandyopadhyay U. Chattopadhyay I. Varadaraj A. Ali E. Banerjee R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10993-11001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The fundic stomach from control, ulcerated, and curcumin-pretreated (40 mg kg-1) indomethacin-treated rats were homogenized in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in a Potter-Elvehjem glass homogenizer for 2 min to get 20% homogenate. After centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min, the proteins from 1.0 ml of the supernatant were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and allowed to react with 0.5 ml of 10 mm 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine for 1 h. After precipitation with 20% trichloroacetic acid, the protein was washed thrice with a mixture of ethanol-ethyl acetate (1:1), dissolved in 1.0 ml of a solution containing 6 m guanidine HCl in 20 mm potassium phosphate adjusted to pH 2.3 with trifluroacetic acid, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was read for carbonyl content at 362 nm (e = 22,000 m-1 cm-1). Tissue Extraction and Gelatin Zymography—The fundic part of the gastric mucosa was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors, minced, and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was extracted in the lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min to obtain TX extract. Tissue extracts were preserved at -70 °C and used in future studies. MMP activity was significantly decreased within a short period of time if the mucosa was processed in the absence of protease inhibitors. For assay of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity, mucosal extracts were electrophoresed in SDS-poly-acrylamide gel containing 1 mg ml-1 gelatin under nonreducing conditions. The gels were washed in 2.5% Triton-X-100 and incubated in CAB buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2) for 18 h at 37 °C and stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue followed by destaining (18Baragi V.M. Qiu L. Gunja-Smith Z. Woessner J.F.J. Lesch C.A. Guglietta A. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1997; 32: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The zones of gelatinolytic activity came as negative staining. Enzymatic activity was determined by scanning bands using a scanner (HP Scanjet Scanner 5550C) connected to a computer linked to proper software (Image QUANT) to measure the area produced by each peak. Western Blotting—Proteins (120 μg) were resolved by 8% nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (30Swarnakar S. Beers J. Strickland D.K. Azhar S. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21121-21128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked for 2 h at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 7% nonfat dry milk followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C in 1:500 dilution of polyclonal goat antihuman MMP-9 antibody in TBST. The membrane was washed three times with TBST and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody, and the bands were visualized using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate solution from Sigma. The blots shown in this study are representative replicates selected from at least three experiments. Healing of Indomethacin-induced Gastric Ulcer—Indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer was developed in a group of animals under the conditions described above. One group served as control for autohealing, whereas the other groups were treated intraperitoneally with 40 mg kg-1 body weight curcumin or 15 mg kg-1 body weight omeprazole after 4 h of administration of indomethacin. Healing was monitored after sacrificing animals at different time points (n = 12), and the ulcer index was scored as described above. The activity profile of MMP-9 and -2 during ulcer healing was determined as described before. Statistical Analysis—The ulcer index data were fitted using a Sigma plot. The data were presented as the means ± S.E. Significance was calculated from Student's t test. Histological Analysis of Gastric Mucosa during Ulceration and the Effect of Curcumin—Rats sacrificed 4 h after indomethacin administration showed hemorrhagic lesions covering the total glandular area of the stomach. Gastric lesions were observed macroscopically and expressed as ulcer index that became maximal at 4 h after administration of indomethacin at a dose of 48 mg kg-1 body weight Macroscopically visible gastric hemorrhagic lesions in the fundic stomach were not found in curcumin-pretreated (40 mg kg-1 body weight) rats. Histological inspection of the tissue indicated that indomethacin caused exfoliation of the gastric epithelial cells along with disruption of mucosal layer of stomach compared with that of control (Fig. 1, A and B), and this evidence of ulcer was completely abolished in curcumin-pretreated indomethacin-treated tissue (Fig. 1C). Ulcer re-epithelialization with an appearance of intact mucosal layer was observed in healed tissue (Fig. 1C). Effect of Curcumin on Oxidative Damage in Indomethacininduced Gastric Ulcer—ROS is one of the major causative factors for gastric ulceration by indomethacin that creates oxidative damage by increasing membrane lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and glutathione depletion. Therefore, the effect of curcumin on oxidative damage of the gastric mucosa caused by indomethacin treatment was studied. Table I showed the antioxidant activity of curcumin in protecting gastric lesions through blocking of indomethacin-induced increase in lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation. The glutathione level, which was significantly decreased in indomethacin-treated samples, was completely restored to the control level by curcumin.Table IEffect of curcumin on indomethacin-induced oxidative damage of gastric mucosa Curcumin (40 mg kg-1) was injected intraperitoneally 30 min prior to indomethacin administration (48 mg kg-1 body weight). The control animals received only vehicle orally. Glutathione, lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation were measured as described in the text. TBARS, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance.

Indomethacin at different doses was administered to develop ulcer at different stages of severity. The result as shown in Fig. 2A indicated that increasing doses of indomethacin caused gradual increase in the mean ulcer index reaching maximum at 48 mg kg-1 body weight. The gelatinolytic activity of pro-MMP-9 (92 kDa) was significantly increased with increasing doses of indomethacin reaching the maximum at 48 mg kg-1 body weight (Fig. 2B), and similarly MMP-9 expression was correlated parallel with increasing doses of indomethacin as shown in Western blot (Fig. 2C). In contrast, under the same condition, the activities of both pro-MMP-2 and active MMP-2 were decreased (Fig. 2B). At the highest dose of indomethacin (48 mg kg-1), although the mean ulcer index was 40, the index varied from as low as 10 to as high as 50. To ascertain any changes in the activity of MMPs at different stages of severity of ulcer, gelatin zymography was carried out with gastric tissue extracts from four different degrees of ulcer indices, e.g. 10, 20, 30, and 40. The changes in the activity of both MMPs were found well correlated with the increase in the severity of ulcer as measured by ulcer index (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B represents the percentage of activity of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in different stages of ulcer. A 12-fold higher level of MMP-9 activity was observed in indomethacin-treated samples compared with those of untreated controls (Fig. 3B). Total activity of MMP-2 (both pro and active forms) appeared to be 2-fold lower in indomethacin-treated samples compared with those of untreated controls (Fig. 3B). Ulcer index value as well as MMP-9 activity (Fig. 4) was also measured at different time points after indomethacin administration. We found that the ulcer index was increased at 3–4 h in comparison with the earlier time points (Fig. 4A), and corresponding MMP-9 activity in the gastric tissue increased ∼10–12-fold at 3–4 h after indomethacin administration (Fig. 4), with respect to the earlier time points.Fig. 3Correlation of ulcer index with MMP-9 and -2 activities.

https://openalex.org/W2078143516,"Regulation of ribosome biogenesis is central to the control of cell growth. In rapidly growing yeast cells, ribosomal protein (RP) genes account for approximately one-half of all polymerase II transcription-initiation events, yet these genes are markedly and coordinately downregulated in response to a number of environmental stress conditions, or during the transition from fermentation to respiration. Although several conserved signalling pathways (TOR, RAS/protein kinase A and protein kinase C) impinge upon RP gene transcription, little is known about how initiation at these genes is controlled. Rap1 (refs 6, 7) and more recently Fhl1 (ref. 8) were shown to bind upstream of many RP genes. Here we show that the essential protein Ifh1 binds to and activates many RP gene promoters under optimal growth conditions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ifh1 is recruited to RP gene promoters through the forkhead-associated domain of Fhl1. Ifh1 binding decreases when RP genes are downregulated either by TOR inhibition or nutrient depletion, and is restored after release from starvation or upon regulated induction of IFH1 expression. These findings indicate a central role for Ifh1 and Fhl1 in RP gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2122680836,"The position-dependent specification of root epidermal cells in Arabidopsis provides an elegant paradigm for cell patterning during development. Here, we describe a new gene, SCRAMBLED (SCM), required for cells to appropriately interpret their location within the developing root epidermis. SCM encodes a receptor-like kinase protein with a predicted extracellular domain of six leucine-rich repeats and an intracellular serine-threonine kinase domain. SCM regulates the expression of the GLABRA2, CAPRICE, WEREWOLF, and ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 transcription factor genes that define the cell fates. Further, the SCM gene is expressed throughout the developing root. Therefore, SCM likely enables developing epidermal cells to detect positional cues and establish an appropriate cell-type pattern."

https://openalex.org/W2073440628,"It is well documented that long term potentiation (LTP) is impaired in the hippocampus of the aged animal. Among the changes that contribute to this impairment is an increase in hippocampal concentration of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and increased IL-1β-induced signaling. In this study we investigated the possibility that these changes were a consequence of decreased concentration of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-4, and decreased IL-4-stimulated signaling. We report that functional IL-4 receptors are expressed on granule cells of the dentate gyrus and that receptor activation results in phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT6. Hippocampal IL-4 concentration was decreased with age, and this was accompanied by a decrease in phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT6. The evidence indicates that IL-4 modulates expression of IL-1β mRNA and protein and that it attenuates IL-1β-induced impairment of LTP and phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun. We argued that, if a decrease in hippocampal IL-4 concentration significantly contributed to the age-related impairment in LTP, then restoration of IL-4 should restore LTP. To test this, we treated rats with VP015 (phospholipid microparticles-incorporating phosphatidylserine), which increases IL-4 concentration in hippocampus. The data indicate that the VP015-induced increase in IL-4 concentration in hippocampus of aged rats and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated rats was accompanied by a reversal of the age-related and LPS-induced impairment in LTP in perforant path granule cell synapses. We propose that interplay between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses impact significantly on synaptic function in the hippocampus of the aged rat.

Inflammatory changes contribute to the deficits that accompany several neurodegenerative conditions, and, in animal models, it has been repeatedly shown that inflammation is associated with deficits in synaptic function and consequently impairments in cognitive function. For example, peripheral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; IL-1RI, IL-1 receptor type I; LTP, long term potentiation; Th1, -2, T helper types 1 and 2; JAK1, Janus tyrosine kinase 1; STAT6, signal transducers and activators of transcription 6; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NBM, neurobasal medium; ES, excretory/secretory; BSA, bovine serum albumin; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; NGS, normal goat serum; ANOVA, analysis of variance; p, phosphorylated; epsp, excitatory post-synaptic potential.), which increases pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) concentration in the brain, is accompanied by evidence of cell stress and neuronal cell death (1Vereker E.

Inflammatory responses are regulated in part by anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-10, which are produced by T cells and cells of the innate immune system. T helper type 2 (Th2) cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 and are responsible for reciprocally regulating the T helper type 1 (Th1) subtype, which mediate cellular and inflammatory responses. IL-4 also plays a role in promoting the differentiation of naïve T cells to Th2 cells. A key anti-inflammatory action of IL-4 results from its ability to inhibit release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells and to up-regulate the synthesis of IL-1 receptor antagonist (12Brown M.A. Hural J. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Vannier E. Miller M.C. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Several cells express IL-4 receptors, including hematopoietic, endothelial, and epithelial cells (14Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar), but robust evidence indicating their presence on neurons is lacking, although expression on cultured glial cells has been reported (15Brodie C. Goldreich N. Haiman T. Kazimirsky G. J. Neuroimmunol. 1998; 81: 20-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Molina-Holgado E. Vela J.M. Arevalo-Martin A. Guaza C. Eur.

Neuroimmunol. 2001; 113: 49-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The study of signaling events following IL-4 receptor activation has been confined largely to hematopoietic cells where it has been shown that formation of the ligand-receptor complex leads to sequential activation of the Janus family of tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and JAK3 and the transcription factor STAT6 (14Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). Because of the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-4, we hypothesized that the age-related changes in hippocampal function, which we have attributed to the increase in IL-1β concentration (4Murray C. Lynch M.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2974-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and up-regulated IL-1β-induced signaling (18Lynch A.M. Lynch M.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 1779-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), may be exacerbated by a decrease in IL-4 concentration and down-regulation of IL-4-stimulated signaling. We addressed this hypothesis by assessing parallel age-related changes in cytokine concentration and signaling and LTP in perforant path-granule cell synapses. Our findings demonstrate the presence of functional IL-4 receptors in rat hippocampus and indicate that the age-related decrease in IL-4 concentration and the associated down-regulation of IL-4-stimulated signaling significantly contribute to the deficit in LTP observed in aged rats. Significantly, restoration of IL-4 concentration to that observed in hippocampus of young rats was associated with successful maintenance of LTP. Animals—Male Wistar rats (BioResources Unit, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland) of mean age 4 months (250–350 g) or 22 months (450–550 g) were used in these experiments. Animals were housed in pairs (22-month-old rats) or groups of 4–6 (4-month-old rats) under a 12-h light schedule, ambient temperature was controlled between 22 and 23 °C, and rats were maintained under veterinary supervision throughout the study. These experiments were performed under a license issued by the Department of Health (Ireland). VP015 Treatment Regimen—Rats were randomly assigned to four treatment groups; rats in two of these groups were injected with VP015 (150 μl, 6 × 106 particles incorporating phosphatidylserine/ml of suspension in PBS; Vasogen Inc., Mississauga, Canada) intramuscularly into the upper hind limb 14 days, 13 days, and 24 h before treatment with anesthetic and subsequent assessment of the ability of rats to sustain LTP. At corresponding times, the remaining two groups received three injections of saline and/or phospholipid microparticles-incorporating phosphatidylcholine as control. The effect of this treatment was assessed in rats treated intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline (see below). In a separate set of experiments, groups of young (4 months) and aged (23 months) male Wistar rats underwent the same treatment regime. Injections were given on alternate limbs and no local adverse effects were observed at any time. Induction of LTP in Vivo—On the day of the experiment, rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of urethane (1.5 g/kg); the absence of a pedal reflex was considered to be an indicator of deep anesthesia. In those experiments where rats were challenged with LPS, intraperitoneal injection of LPS (100 μg/kg; Sigma) or saline was administered to young (4 months) rats 3 h before analysis of LTP as described previously (1Vereker E. Campbell V. Roche E. McEntee E. Lynch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26252-26258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, a bipolar stimulating electrode and a unipolar recording electrode were stereotaxically positioned in the perforant path (4.4-mm lateral to lambda) and dorsal cell body region of the dentate gyrus (2.5-mm lateral and 3.9-mm posterior to Bregma), respectively. Test shocks were delivered at 30-s intervals, and recorded for 10 min before and 40 min after tetanic stimulation (three trains of stimuli; 250 Hz for 200 ms; 30-s intertrain interval). In some experiments, rats were injected intracerebroventricularly (2.5-mm posterior, and 0.5-mm lateral, to Bregma) with either 5 μl of saline, or 5 μl of IL-1β (3.5 ng/ml, R & D Systems, UK) 5 min after an intracerebroventricular IL-4 injection (5 μl, 20 μg/ml, R & D Systems, UK) and in a further series of experiments, a group of aged rats were injected intracerebroventricularly with IL-4 to assess whether acute treatment with the anti-inflammatory cytokine might attenuate the age-related deficit in LTP. In these studies, tetani were delivered to the perforant path 30 min after IL-1β or IL-4 injection. At the end of the experiment, rats were killed by decapitation, and the brains rapidly removed. The hippocampus was dissected free from the whole brain; slices (350 × 350 μm) were prepared using a McIlwain tissue chopper and stored in Krebs buffer containing CaCl2 (1.13 mm) and 10% Me2SO at -80 °C as described previously (19Haan E.A.

In some cases, untreated brains were removed whole, coated with OCT compound (Sakura Tissue-Tek, Netherlands), immersed in isopentane at -30 °C and stored at -80 °C until sections were prepared. 20-μm cryostat sections were prepared, mounted on gelatin-coated slides, air dried for 30 min, and stored at -20 °C until used for immunohistochemical analysis. Preparation of Primary Neuronal and Glial Cultures—Primary hippocampal neurons were isolated and prepared from 1-day-old Wistar rats (BioResources Unit, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland) and maintained in neurobasal medium (NBM, Invitrogen) as described previously (6Nolan Y. Martin D. Campbell V.A. Lynch M.A. J. Neuroimmunol. 2004; 151: 12-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Tissue from three neonates was pooled and represented an individual culture. Data were obtained from a total of six cultures. Rats were decapitated, the hippocampus dissected, and the meninges removed. Tissue was incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Sigma) with trypsin (0.25 μg/ml, Sigma) for 25 min at 37 °C, triturated in PBS containing soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.2 μg/ml, Sigma) and DNase (0.2 mg/ml, Sigma) and gently passed through a sterile mesh filter (40 μm). The suspension was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 3 min at 20 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in warm NBM, supplemented with heat-inactivated horse serum (10%, Sigma), penicillin (100 units/ml, Invitrogen), streptomycin (100 units/ml, Invitrogen), and Glutamax (2 mm, Invitrogen). Suspended cells were plated at a density of 0.25 × 106 cells on circular 10-mm diameter coverslips, coated with poly-l-lysine (60 μg/ml, Sigma), and incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2:95% O2 at 37 °C for 2 h prior to being flooded with pre-warmed NBM. After 48 h, 5 ng/ml cytosine-arabino-furanoside (Sigma) was added to the culture medium to suppress the proliferation of non-neuronal cells. Culture media were exchanged every 3 days and cells were grown in culture for up to 7 days prior to treatment. Neurons were incubated in the absence or presence of LPS (100 ng/ml in NBM) with or without a 2-h pre-treatment with IL-4 (100 ng/ml in NBM). 24 h later supernatant was removed and stored for analysis of IL-1β concentration. Cells were rinsed in TBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in TBS for immunohistochemical assessment of expression of IL-4 receptor (IL-4R), pJAK1, pJAK3, pSTAT6, and IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI). In some cases, hippocampal neurons were incubated in the presence or absence of IL-4 (100 ng/ml for 2 h) and harvested for analysis of expression of IL-1RI and IL-4R; the protocols used for assessment of expression of IL-4R and IL-1RI are outlined below. In a separate set of experiments, total RNA was extracted from LPS- and/or IL-4-treated hippocampal neurons using TRI reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions and used for analysis of IL-1β and IL-1RI mRNA (see below). Mixed glial cultures were prepared from whole brains of 1-day-old Wistar rats (BioResources Unit, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland). In this case, dissected tissue was roughly chopped and added to pre-warmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml). Tissue was triturated, and the suspension was filtered through a sterile mesh filter (40 μm) and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 3 min at 20 °C, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in warmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Resuspended cells were pipetted onto poly-l-lysine-coated (60 μg/ml) coverslips in 24-well plates at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells and incubated for 1 h before addition of warmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2:95% air environment, and media were changed every 3 days. Resultant cells were composed of microglia and astrocytes as visualized by OX-42 and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity, respectively. Tissue from three neonates was pooled and represented an individual culture. Data were obtained from a total of four cultures. Glia and neurons were incubated in the presence or absence of homogenate (20 μg/ml) prepared from the helminth parasite, Fasciola hepatica (liver fluke homogenate) or excretory/secretory (ES) products (20 μg/ml) obtained from the parasite. Twenty-four hours later supernatant was removed and stored for analysis of IL-4 concentration. Generation of Bone Marrow-derived Dendritic Cells—Femurs were removed from BALB/c mice (BioResources Unit, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland) and dissected from the surrounding muscle tissue. The bone marrow was flushed out with RPMI medium (Invitrogen), and cell aggregates were disintegrated using a syringe. The resulting cells were washed, pelleted by centrifugation (1200 rpm for 5 min), and resuspended in fresh RPMI. Immature bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were prepared by culturing cells from one leg per tissue culture flask in complete RPMI supplemented with 10% of a supernatant from a granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor-secreting cell line, J558. The cells were maintained in culture for 3 days at 37 °C with 5% CO2, loosely adherent cells were removed, and fresh medium containing 10% granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor was added. Cells were re-cultured for an additional 4 days, and the viability of these myeloid dendritic cells was assessed and found to be 80% (20McGuirk P. McCann C. Mills K.H. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Dendritic cells were incubated in the presence or absence of liver fluke homogenate (20 μg/ml) or ES products (20 μg/ml). 24 h later supernatant was removed, and the IL-4 concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (21O'Neill S.M. Brady M.T. Callanan J.J. Mulcahy G. Joyce P. Mills K.H.G. Dalton J.P. Parasite Immunol. 2000; 22: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Analysis of IL-4 and IL-1β Protein Concentration—The concentration of IL-1β was assessed in supernatant obtained from neuronal culture as well as in hippocampal homogenates, whereas IL-4 concentration was assessed in hippocampal homogenate and in supernatant prepared from glia, which were treated in the presence and absence of liver fluke homogenate or ES. Analysis was carried out by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R & D Systems). Hippocampal slices were thawed and rinsed three times in ice-cold Krebs solution and homogenized in ice-cold Krebs solution. Protein concentrations in homogenates were equalized (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and triplicate aliquots (100 μl) were used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody-coated (with either 1.0 μg/ml goat anti-rat IL-1β antibody or 2.0 μg/ml mouse anti-rat IL-4 antibody diluted in PBS, pH 7.3) 96-well plates were incubated overnight at room temperature, washed several times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, blocked for 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer (PBS, pH 7.3, 5% sucrose, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.05% NaN3), and incubated with standards (IL-1β (0–1000 pg/ml), IL-4 (0–1000 pg/ml)) or samples for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed with PBS, incubated with secondary antibody (350 ng/ml biotinylated goat anti-rat antibody for IL-1β or 50 ng/ml biotinylated goat anti-rat antibody for IL-4; each diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA and 2% normal goat serum) for 2 h at room temperature, washed again, and incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:200 dilution in PBS containing 1% BSA) for 20 min at room temperature. Substrate solution (1:1 mixture of H2O2 and tetramethylbenzidine) was added, incubation was continued at room temperature in the dark for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped using 1 m H2SO4. Absorbance was read at 450 nm; values were corrected for protein in the case of homogenates and expressed as picograms/mg of protein. Analysis of IL-1β mRNA and IL-1RI mRNA—cDNA synthesis was performed on 1 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) primer (Superscript reverse transcriptase, Invitrogen). The RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen) at 1 unit/μg of RNA for 10 min at 65 °C. Equal amounts of cDNA were used for PCR amplification for a total of 26 cycles. Primers were pre-tested through an increasing number of cycles to obtain reverse transcription-PCR products in the exponential range. In the case of rat IL-1β mRNA expression the following sequences of primers were used: upstream, 5′-GCA CCT TCT TTT CCT TCA TC-3′; downstream, 5′-CTG ATG TAC CAG TTG GGG AA-3′; and for rat β-actin mRNA expression: upstream, 5′-GAA ATC GTG CGT GAC ATT-3′; downstream, 5′-TCA GGA GGA GCA ATG ATC TTG A-3′. The cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 60 s followed by cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s. The reaction was stopped by final extension for 10 min at 70 °C. These primers generated IL-1β PCR products of 447 bp and β-actin PCR products of 360 bp. In the case of IL-1RI mRNA, cDNA synthesis was performed on 1 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) primer (Superscript reverse transcriptase, Invitrogen). The RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen) at 1 unit/μg of RNA for 10 min at 65 °C. Equal amounts of cDNA were used for PCR amplification for a total of 30 cycles. Primers were pre-tested through an increasing number of cycles to obtain reverse transcription-PCR products in the exponential range. The following sequences of primers were used: upstream, 5′-AGA TGG AAG GAC CTA TGA TC-3′; downstream, 5′-TGC AGC ATC TGA CGA CAG GA-3′; and for rat β-actin mRNA expression: upstream, 5′-GAA ATC GTG CGT GAC ATT-3′; downstream, 5′-TCA GGA GGA GCA ATG ATC TTG A-3′. The cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 180 s, 54 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 180 s followed by cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 54 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. The reaction was stopped by final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. These primers generated IL-1RI PCR products of 640 bp and β-actin PCR products of 360 bp. Equal volumes of PCR product from each sample were loaded onto 1.5% agarose gels, and bands were separated by application of 90 V, photographed, and quantified using densitometry. Estimation of mRNA expression was carried out using β-actin as a reference gene. No observable change in β-actin mRNA was observed in any of the treatment conditions. Western Immunoblot Analysis of pJAK1, pJAK3, pSTAT6, pJNK1, p-c-Jun, IL-1RI, and IL-4R—Phosphorylated forms of JAK1 (p-JAK1), JAK3 (p-JAK3), STAT6 (p-STAT6), and JNK1 (p-JNK1) were assessed in homogenates obtained from hippocampus. Phosphorylated STAT6 was assessed in nuclear fraction while p-JNK, p-JAK1, and p-JAK3 were analyzed in cytosolic fractions. The effects of IL-1β and IL-4 were also assessed on p-JNK1 and phosphorylated c-Jun (p-c-Jun). Expression of IL-4R and IL-1RI was assessed in preparations obtained from cultured hippocampal neurons incubated in the presence or absence of IL-4 (100 ng/ml in NBM). The nuclear and cytosolic fractions were prepared by homogenizing hippocampal slices in lysis buffer (composition in mm: Hepes 10 (pH 7.0), KCl 10, EDTA 0.1, MgCl2 1.5, Nonidet P-40 0.2%, dithiothreitol 1.0, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 0.5). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and reconstituted in lysis buffer. Lysates were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatants containing the cytosolic extracts were removed. Pelleted nuclei were reconstituted in nuclear extract buffer (composition in mm: Hepes 20 (pH 7.9), NaCl 420, EDTA 0.1, MgCl2 1.5, glycerol 25%, dithiothreitol 1.0, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 0.5). Nuclei were incubated on ice for 15 min at room temperature then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were removed as nuclear extracts. All tissue samples were equalized for protein concentration, and 10-μl aliquots (1 mg/ml) were added to 5 μl of sample buffer (Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm, pH 6.8; glycerol, 10%; SDS, 10%; β-mercaptoethanol, 5%; bromphenol blue, 0.05% w/v), boiled for 5 min and loaded onto gels (7.5% SDS for p-JAK1 and pJAK3, 12% for p-JNK1 and p-c-Jun, and 10% for p-STAT6, IL-1RI, and IL-4R). Proteins were separated by application of 30 mA constant current for 25–30 min, transferred onto nitrocellulose strips (225 mA for 75 min), and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibody. To assess expression of p-JAK1, p-JAK3, and p-STAT6, nitrocellulose strips were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of a goat polyclonal IgG antibody that specifically targets either p-JAK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:200); p-JAK3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:100); or p-STAT6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:200) in TBS containing 5% Triton X-100 and 0.1% BSA. To examine JNK1 and c-Jun phosphorylation, nitrocellulose strips were probed with a mouse monoclonal IgG raised against a recombinant protein corresponding to an amino acid sequence of p-JNK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:300) or p-c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:200) of human origin. Antibodies were diluted in TBS/Tween (0.1% Tween-20) to which 0.1% BSA was added. In the case of p-JNK1, nitrocellulose was stripped and probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody that targets total JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:200). The primary antibodies and conditions used for analysis of IL-4R and IL-1RI were as follows: nitrocellulose strips were probed with rabbit polyclonal IgG antibodies that specifically targets IL-1RI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:1000) or IL-4Rα (S-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:200) in TBS containing 0.1% BSA. Nitrocellulose strips were washed and incubated for1hat room temperature with secondary antibody as follows: peroxidase conjugated anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for p-JAK1, p-JAK3, and p-STAT6, peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) in the case of p-JNK, t-JNK, and p-c-Jun and peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) in the case of IL-1RI and IL-4R. All of the nitrocellulose strips were reprobed for β-actin expression to ensure equal loading of protein on all SDS-PAGE gels. β-Actin expression was assessed using a mouse monoclonal IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:300) in PBS/Tween (0.1% Tween-20) containing 2% nonfat dried milk, and immunoreactive bands were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). Protein complexes were visualized using SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce) in the case of p-JNK, p-c-Jun, IL-1RI, and IL-4R and ECL Western blotting Detection System Reagents (Amersham Biosciences) in the case of p-JAK1, p-JAK3, and p-STAT6. Immunoblots were exposed to film (Amersham Biosciences) and processed using a Fuji x-ray processor. Protein bands were quantitated by densitometric analysis using two software packages, Grab It (Grab It Annotating Grabber 2.04.7, Synotics, UVP Ltd., UK) and Gelworks (Gelworks ID, Version 2.51, UVP Ltd.) for photography and densitometry, respectively. Gelworks provides a single value (in arbitrary units) representing the density of each blot, and the values presented here are means of data generated from several separate experiments. Immunostaining for IL-4R—Frozen cryostat sections were thawed at room temperature, fixed in ice-cold absolute ethanol, washed in PBS, and blocked with 10% normal goat serum (NGS, Vector Laboratories)/4% BSA in PBS. Sections were incubated overnight in a humidified chamber at 4 °C in the presence or absence of a blocking peptide (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and for a further 24 h with IL-4Rα rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody (S-20, at 1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Sections were washed in PBS and incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:50, Vector Laboratories) for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were placed in avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase solution, diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions for 1 h (Vectastain elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories), and then reacted with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAKO) and H2O2 for color development. The reaction was terminated by washing with double distilled H2O, and positively stained cells were viewed under a light microscope at ×4 and ×100 magnifications. Negative control studies were performed by replacing the primary antibodies with PBS. Fluorescent Immunostaining for IL-4R, IL-1RI, p-JAK1, p-JAK3, and p-STAT6—For analysis of IL-4R, IL-1RI p-JAK1, p-JAK3 and p-STAT6 expression in cultured hippocampal neurons, cells were washed in TBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed in TBS, and permeabilized in 0.1% T"

If the decrease in winds reported from recent Hubble Space Telescope images is not a temporal change, then the features tracked must have been at least 130 kilometers higher than in earlier studies. Saturn's south polar stratosphere is warmer than predicted from simple radiative models. The C/H ratio on Saturn is seven times solar, twice Jupiter's. Saturn's ring temperatures have radial variations down to the smallest scale resolved (100 kilometers). Diurnal surface temperature variations on Phoebe suggest a more porous regolith than on the jovian satellites."

https://openalex.org/W2055769271,"T cell death-associated gene 8 (TDAG8) is a G-protein-coupled receptor mainly expressed in lymphoid organs and cancer tissues. TDAG8 shares high amino acid sequence homologies with recently reported proton-sensing G-protein-coupled receptors, G2A, OGR1, and GPR4. Here we have identified TDAG8 as a novel proton-sensing receptor. Upon acid stimulation, stably expressed TDAG8 was internalized from the plasma membrane. As a signaling pathway downstream of TDAG8, accumulation of cyclic AMP was observed in response to solutions with a pH value lower than 7.2. Furthermore, RhoA activation and actin rearrangement were elicited by acid-stimulated TDAG8. These results suggest that TDAG8 may play biological roles in immune response and cellular transformation under conditions accompanying tissue acidosis."

Previous studies using an NF-κB reporter have shown that IκB-ζ inhibits the activity of NF-κB. In the present study, we dissected the amino-terminal region of IκB-ζ, which shows no homology to any other proteins. Indirect immunofluorescence studies demonstrated the presence of a bipartite nuclear localization signal spanning amino acids 163–178. Using GAL4 fusion proteins, we found that internal fragments containing amino acids 329–402 possessed intrinsic transcriptional activation activity. Interestingly, the activity was not detected in GAL4 fusion proteins of the full-length IκB-ζ. On the other hand, the GAL4-dependent transcriptional activity was generated by co-expression of the GAL4-NF-κB p50 subunit fusion protein and the full-length IκB-ζ, neither of which exhibited the activity on their own. A new splicing variant, IκB-ζ(D), with a deletion of amino acids 236–429, was found to lack transactivation activity. Forced expression of IκB-ζ, but not IκB-ζ(D), augmented interleukin-6 production, indicating the functional significance of the transactivation activity. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor-α production was inhibited by expression of IκB-ζ, highlighting the dual functions of this molecule. These results indicate that IκB-ζ harbors latent transcriptional activation activity, and that the activity is expressed upon interaction with the NF-κB p50 subunit. In addition to the inhibitory activity on NF-κB-mediated transcription, the transcriptional activation activity of IκB-ζ should be crucial for the regulation of inflammation.

A wide variety of cellular activities are executed by the coordinated expression of diverse genes. Precise regulation of the transcription factors that control gene expression is vital to accomplish specific tasks as well as to maintain life. Various endogenous and exogenous stimuli induce alterations of the gene expression profiles, and dynamic changes of the profiles are observed in immune responses to microbial infections, an essential reaction for the survival of multicellular organisms. Innate and adaptive immune systems function cooperatively in vertebrate animals for defense against infection by various pathogens (1Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat.

This evolutionarily conserved transcription factor was initially identified as a nuclear factor that binds to the enhancer region of the immunoglobulin κ light chain (5Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar), and is now known to be a ubiquitous and central transcription factor involved in a wide variety of important and diverse biological processes, including inflammation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell differentiation (6Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4585) Google Scholar, 7Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4058) Google Scholar). NF-κB proteins exist as homo- or heterodimers of 5 kinds of subunits containing the Rel homology domain (RHD), which is involved in DNA binding and dimerization. p65 (RelA), c-Rel, and RelB contain a transcriptional activation domain (or transactivation domain, TAD) after the RHD. On the other hand, the p50 and p52 subunits, generated by processing of their larger precursors, namely p105 and p100, respectively, consist of the RHD alone without the TAD. The 5 different subunits produce at least 12 different combinations of NF-κBs. Among these, homo- or heterodimers of p50 and p52 are devoid of transcriptional activity and act as inhibitors of NF-κB-mediated transcription (6Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4585) Google Scholar, 7Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4058) Google Scholar). In quiescent cells, NF-κB is tethered to the cytoplasm as a complex with its inhibitor proteins, IκB-α, -β, and -ϵ (8Davis N. Ghosh S. Simmons D.L. Tempst P. Liou H.C. Baltimore D. Bose Jr., H.R.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The ankyrin-repeat motifs of the IκB proteins interact with the RHD of the NF-κB subunits to mask the nuclear localization signal (NLS). Exposure of cells to various stimuli including various microbial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), proinflammatory cytokines, T- and B-cell mitogens, as well as physical and chemical stresses, induces site-specific phosphorylation of IκBs, leading to ubiquitination followed by proteasome-mediated degradation (6Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4585) Google Scholar). Consequently, liberated NF-κB translocates into the nucleus to drive the transcription of many target genes. Rapid activation of NF-κB without de novo synthesis of new proteins renders this transcription factor ideal for mediating primary cellular responses. Because uncontrolled activation of NF-κB, which is often observed with severe infections, leads to life-threatening symptoms represented by septic shock, the activity of NF-κB is tightly regulated in normal cells. Upon activation of NF-κB, cytosolic IκB-α is degraded, but transcription of IκB-α is up-regulated (12Brown K. Park S. Kanno T. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The NF-κB-mediated induction of their own regulators comprises autonomous negative feedback loops giving rise to transient expression of NF-κB activity. While searching for roles for inducible proteins upon inflammation, we and others identified an ankyrin-repeat-containing protein that was strongly induced in response to LPS (21Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 22Kitamura H. Kanehira K. Okita K. Morimatsu M. Saito M.

This protein, designated IκB-ζ, is hardly detectable in unstimulated cells, but is strongly induced not only by LPS but also other microbial components that stimulate Toll-like receptors (21Yamazaki S.

The induction is also observed upon stimulation by interleukin (IL)-1β, but not by another proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (21Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol.

NF-κB activation is essential, but not sufficient, for the induction of IκB-ζ, and specific mRNA stabilization is required for the induction (21Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol.

Immunogenetics. 2001; 53: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The longer form, IκB-ζ(L), is predominantly induced upon LPS stimulation (26Yamazaki S. Muta T. Matsuo S. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1678-1687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and the shorter form, IκB-ζ(S), lacks the amino-terminal 99 amino acids of IκB-ζ(L). Both forms of IκB-ζ harbor 6 ankyrin-repeats in the carboxyl-terminal region, as observed in other IκB proteins. On the other hand, the amino-terminal regions of these molecules exhibit no significant homology to any other known proteins. In contrast to the typical cytosolic and constitutively expressed IκB proteins, IκB-ζ is localized in the nucleus, where it binds preferentially to the NF-κB p50 subunit, rather than the p65 subunit, without prevention of their nuclear translocation (21Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Initial characterization of IκB-ζ by reporter analyses revealed that it inhibits the activity of NF-κB (21Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments indicated that the carboxyl-terminal domain with the ankyrin-repeats inhibits the DNA binding of the p65·p50 heterodimer as well as the p50 homodimer (21Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although an NLS has been shown to be present, the functions of the IκB-ζ amino-terminal region, which consists of more than 400 amino acids and is unique to IκB-ζ, remain largely unknown. Through efforts to explore the functions of the amino-terminal region, we found that a fragment in this region exhibits transcriptional activation activity. Furthermore, we showed that overexpression of IκB-ζ results in augmentation of IL-6 production in response to LPS, but inhibits TNF-α production. These observations are consistent with an essential role for IκB-ζ in the induction of IL-6 and other inflammatory genes, as revealed by analyses of the recently established IκB-ζ-deficient mice, in which IL-6 production by LPS- or IL-1β-stimulated cells is abolished. Taken together, our findings indicate that IκB-ζ is one of the key regulators of NF-κB, which exhibits dual functions depending on the target genes. Cells and Reagents—Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 and TNF-α were purchased from List Biological Laboratories Inc. (Campbell, CA) and Genzyme Corp. (Cambridge, MA), respectively. Plasmids—Expression plasmids were constructed by subcloning DNA fragments obtained by PCR into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), pFA-CMV (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), pMX, or CSII-EF-MCS-IRES2-Venus with or without an amino-terminal FLAG tag. pMX was kindly provided by Dr. Toshio Kitamura (University of Tokyo), and pCAG-HIVgp, pCMV-VSV-G-RSV-Rev, and CSII-EF-MCS-IRES2-Venus were kind gifts from Drs. Hiroyuki Miyoshi and Atsushi Miyawaki (RIKEN). The pFR-Luc reporter plasmid containing a synthetic promoter with 5 tandem repeats of the yeast GAL4 binding sites and the phRL-TK internal control reporter plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase were purchased from Stratagene and Promega Corp. (Madison, WI), respectively. Various mutants of IκB-ζ were created by PCR. pELAM1-Luc was used as an NF-κB reporter plasmid (29Muta T. Takeshige K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4580-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HeLa or COS-7 cells grown on coverslips were transfected with the indicated expression vectors using FuGENE™ 6. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were fixed with methanol, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and then incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal calf serum. After washing, the cells were further incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragment (Invitrogen Corp.), and then stained with 0.3 μg/ml propidium iodide before observation using a Radiance 2100 confocal laser scanning microscope (Bio-Rad). Reporter Assay—GAL4 reporter assays were carried out as follows. HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated expression plasmids together with the GAL4 reporter plasmid pFR-Luc and the internal control plasmid phRL-TK by the calcium-phosphate method (30Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4816) Google Scholar). One day after transfection, the cells were lysed and the luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-luciferase Reporter System (Promega Corp.). NF-κB reporter assays were carried out using pELAM1-Luc as the NF-κB reporter as described previously (29Muta T. Takeshige K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4580-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The luciferase activities derived from the GAL4 or NF-κB reporters were normalized by the Renilla luciferase activities of the internal control reporter (phRL-TK). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis—RAW264.7 cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 1 h and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five micrograms of the total RNA was then reverse-transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Corp.). PCR was performed on the cDNA products using forward (5′-ACATCACCGCAAACGCCTACACCTG-3′) and reverse (5′-CGTGTCACCATCTCCGTCCCTAGCG-3′) primers for 35 cycles of 98 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. Retroviral Infection—Recombinant retroviruses were prepared using the Plat-E packaging cells and the pMX plasmid (kind gifts from Dr. Toshio Kitamura, University of Tokyo) according to a previously described method (31Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). Lentiviruses were prepared by transfection of HEK293T cells with 3 plasmids, namely the packaging construct pCAG-HIVgp, the VSV-G- and Rev-expressing construct (pCMV-VSV-G-RSV-Rev), and CSII-EF-MCS-IRES2-Venus harboring a cDNA of interest, as described previously (32Miyoshi H. Blomer U. Takahashi M. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8150-8157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar). mRNA Quantification by Real-time RT-PCR—Real-time RT-PCR was carried out with cDNAs reverse transcribed from total RNA using LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics). The primers used were 5′-CCACGGCCTTCCCTAC-3′ and 5′-AGTGCATCATCGTTGTTC-3′ for IL-6, and 5′-TCCCAGAGCTGAACGG-3′ and 5′-GAAGTCGCAGGAGACA-3′ for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Measurement of Cytokine Concentrations—The concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α in the culture supernatants were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay systems from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA) and BIOSOURCE International Inc. (Camarillo, CA), respectively. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.01% SDS and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2)-agarose (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA), and immunoblotted with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2). The amino-terminal region of IκB-ζ shows no significant homology to any other known proteins and it is therefore difficult to speculate about the boundaries of the functional domains from the amino acid sequence. Thus, we constructed serial deletion mutants at the exon/intron junctions for the molecular dissection of IκB-ζ, anticipating that the functional domains would be composed of combinations of modules encoded by each exon. First, we attempted to identify an NLS, which we had previously shown to be present in the amino-terminal region (21Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Because IκB-ζ(L) is the predominantly expressed form in LPS-stimulated cells (26Yamazaki S. Muta T. Matsuo S. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1678-1687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), this form was subjected to the analyses unless otherwise specified, and the amino acid numbering used in the following descriptions refers to that of IκB-ζ(L). The FLAG-tagged full-length (1–728) and deletion mutants of mouse IκB-ζ were transfected into HeLa cells and their localizations were determined by staining with an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1A). In contrast to IκB-α distribution throughout the cells, full-length IκB-ζ was exclusively localized in the nuclei as previously reported (21Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). A mutant (153–728) with a 152-amino acid deletion from the amino terminus exhibited the nuclear localization as the full-length IκB-ζ. On the other hand, the mutants with a 187-amino acid deletion (188–728) and a more extensive deletion (457–728) were not localized in the nucleus but spread throughout the cells, indicating the presence of an NLS in the region between amino acids 153 and 187. Experiments with a series of deletions from the carboxyl terminus also led to the same conclusion (data not shown). This region encoded by exon 6 contains 3 and 2 consecutive basic amino acids (see the sequence at the bottom of Fig. 1B). We focused on these basic amino acids and mutated each of them to alanine (Fig. 1B). Introduction of single point mutations at Lys-163, Arg-164, Lys-177, and Arg-178 perturbed the nuclear localization and the mutants were distributed throughout the cells. In contrast, mutation of Lys-165 did not affect nuclear localization. These results indicate that Lys-163, Arg-164, Lys-177, and R-178 are indispensable for the nuclear localization of IκB-ζ, whereas Lys-165 is not. Thus, these basic amino acids constitute the bipartite NLS of IκB-ζ. A GFP fusion protein containing amino acids 153–187 showed nuclear localization (data not shown), further supporting that this region alone is sufficient to function as an NLS. Although the NLS of IκB-ζ was identified in a relatively short sequence, the functions of most of the long amino-terminal region of IκB-ζ remained unknown. A short amino-terminal region of the typical IκB proteins, such as IκB-α, harbors a motif required for phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination (7Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4058) Google Scholar). However, no such motif is present in the amino-terminal region of IκB-ζ. A relatively large stretch preceding the ankyrin-repeats of IκB-ζ is reminiscent of the structures of p105 and p100, the precursors of the NF-κB p50 and p52 subunits, respectively. This prompted us to examine whether this region is involved in transcriptional activation, similar to the case for the NF-κB subunits. Because it was not known whether IκB-ζ had DNA binding activity, IκB-ζ and its fragments were expressed as fusion proteins with the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 and their transcriptional activation activities were evaluated using a reporter plasmid containing a promoter with the yeast GAL4 binding sites. Mutants of mouse IκB-ζ truncated from the amino and carboxyl termini were expressed as GAL4 fusion proteins in HEK293 cells and the reporter activities derived from the co-transfected GAL4 reporter plasmid were measured (Fig. 2A). The amino-terminal truncated mutants (153–728, 188–728, and 457–728) as well as the full-length IκB-ζ (1–728), which all contained the ankyrin-repeats, did not show any activity above the background level, whereas the mutant consisting of the amino terminus to amino acid 456 (1–456) exhibited substantial activity. Further deletions from the carboxyl terminus beyond amino acid 188 (1–187, 1–152, and 1–95) abolished this activity. The lack of the activities of the mutants are not because of defective expression as revealed by Western blotting using an anti-GAL4 antibody (Supplemental Materials, Fig. S1A). These results indicate that the region between amino acids 188 and 456 harbors a domain with transcriptional activation activity and that the activity is suppressed by the carboxyl-terminal ankyrin-repeats. We assumed that if the activity observed in the above experiment was of physiological significance, then similar phenomena would be observed with the human counterpart. In Fig. 2B, we repeated similar experiments with human IκB-ζ. Again, GAL4 fusion proteins with amino acids 1–403 and 101–403 corresponding to the amino-terminal regions of IκB-ζ(L) and (S), respectively, exhibited significant activity. Furthermore, the full-length human IκB-ζ(L) (1–718) and IκB-ζ(S) (101–718) as well as the carboxyl-terminal ankyrin-repeats (404–718) did not show any activity despite their significant expressions (Supplemental Materials, Fig. S1B). Therefore, the phenomena observed with mouse IκB-ζ were conserved with human IκB-ζ, indicating that transcriptional activation activity is inherent to the middle part of the IκB-ζ molecules, irrespective of the species. When the internal region of amino acids 188–456, encoded by exon 7, was expressed as a GAL4 fusion protein (188–456), it exhibited transactivation activity. We further constructed several deletion mutants and evaluated their activities to examine whether this region could be reduced to a smaller functional unit (Fig. 2C). Truncation of the amino-terminal 112 amino acids (300–456) increased the activity, indicating that these 112 residues are dispensable. Truncation of a further 29 amino acids (329–456) reduced the activity, but the activity observed was still significant. On the other hand, truncation to amino acid 403 (404–456) abolished the activity without affecting the expression (Supplemental Materials, Fig. S1C), indicating an indispensable role for amino acids 329–403. Carboxyl-terminal deletions further supported this conclusion because a GAL4 fusion protein with amino acids 188–403 showed the activity, whereas a shorter one with amino acids 188–328 did not. Although the internal fragments of IκB-ζ exhibited intrinsic transcriptional activation activity, the activity was not expressed by the GAL4 fusion protein with the full-length IκB-ζ. The data shown in Fig. 2 suggested that the carboxyl-terminal domain containing the ankyrin-repeats has a role in suppressing the activity. We speculated that IκB-ζ may be induced to undergo conformational change by interaction with a protein(s) to release the suppression. Our previous studies revealed that the carboxyl-terminal domain containing the ankyrin-repeats interacts with the NF-κB p50 subunit (21Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Therefore, we co-expressed GAL4 fusion proteins of the p50 subunit and the wild-type or mutants of IκB-ζ to measure the transcriptional activities of their complexes on a GAL4-dependent reporter. As expected, the GAL4 fusion protein of the NF-κB p50 subunit alone did not show any activity, because it did not have a TAD. Co-expression of the full-length IκB-ζ (1–728), however, resulted in significant activity (Fig. 3A). Activities were also observed with the amino-terminal truncated mutants from amino acids 153 (153–728) and 188 (188–728), but not with the mutant from amino acid 457 (457–728), again emphasizing an essential role for the region between amino acids 188 and 456. The amino-terminal fragment containing 456 amino acids (1–456) did not show any activity in this system, indicating a requirement for the carboxyl-terminal ankyrin-r"

Enzymatic methods using pectin-degrading enzymes are potentially valuable candidates in this effort because they could reduce the amount of toxic alkaline chemicals currently used. Using high throughput screening of complex environmental DNA libraries more than 40 novel microbial pectate lyases were discovered, and their enzymatic properties were characterized. Several candidate enzymes were found that possessed pH optima and specific activities on pectic material in cotton fibers compatible with their use in the scouring process. However, none exhibited the desired temperature characteristics. Therefore, a candidate enzyme was selected for evolution. Using Gene Site Saturation Mutagenesis™ technology, 36 single site mutants exhibiting improved thermotolerance were produced. A combinatorial library derived from the 12 best performing single site mutants was then generated by using Gene Reassembly™ technology. Nineteen variants with further improved thermotolerance were produced. These variants were tested for both improved thermotolerance and performance in the bioscouring application. The best performing variant (CO14) contained eight mutations and had a melting temperature 16 °C higher than the wild type enzyme while retaining the same specific activity at 50 °C. Optimal temperature of the evolved enzyme was 70 °C, which is 20 °C higher than the wild type. Scouring results obtained with the evolved enzyme were significantly better than the results obtained with chemical scouring, making it possible to replace the conventional and environmentally harmful chemical scouring process.

Scouring results obtained with the evolved enzyme were significantly better than the results obtained with chemical scouring, making it possible to replace the conventional and environmentally harmful chemical scouring process. Before cotton fabric or yarn can be efficiently dyed it needs to be pretreated to remove materials that inhibit dye binding. The current process used by the textile industry involves three different wet processing steps. During scouring, cotton fabric is treated to solubilize and extract undesired non-cellulosic (pectic) material naturally found in cotton. Scouring uses highly alkaline chemicals to remove the non-cellulosic material; this has a serious environmental impact (1Slater K. Environmental Impact of Textiles. Woodhead Publishing Limited, Cambridge, UK2003Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Additionally, the chemicals partially degrade the cellulose in the cotton fiber, which causes a loss of fiber strength and raw materials; as such, chemical scouring is a non-optimal process.Mature cotton fiber is composed of a thin primary wall and a thick secondary cell wall. The goal of cotton processing is removal of the primary cell wall. The chemical composition of the fiber is ∼95% cellulose and ∼5% non-cellulosics. The majority of the non-cellulosic compounds are found in the primary cell wall, which is a complex lattice of pectin (partially methoxylated polygalacturonic acid), protein, cellulose, hemicellulose, and waxes. The secondary cell wall consists almost entirely of cellulose (2Batra S.K. Lewin M. Pearce E.M. Handbook of Fiber Science and Technology. Marcel Decker, New York1985: 727-807Google Scholar, 3Seagull R.W. Oliveri V. Murphy K. Binder A. Kothari S. J. Cotton Sci. 2000; 4: 97-104Google Scholar). An enzyme that could target specifically the non-cellulosic material could reduce or eliminate the use of harsh chemicals, lessening the environmental burden while maintaining the integrity and strength of the cotton fiber.Pectinolytic enzymes are primarily produced in nature by saprophytes and plant pathogens (bacteria and fungi) for degradation of plant cell walls. This group of enzymes has been classified into a larger family of carbohydrate-degrading enzymes (4Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar, 5Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar) and can be accessed at the CAZY web site (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/~cazy/CAZY/index.html). The nomenclature for the different protein families designated at CAZY is used throughout this report. Fig. 1 illustrates the substrates and products of different enzymes involved in pectin degradation. In brief, pectinases are endo-acting hydrolytic enzymes that digest pectate (non-methoxylated polygalacturonic acid) into oligogalacturonic acids. Exo-polygalacturonidases are exo-acting hydrolytic enzymes that digest pectate, producing galacturonic acid. Pectinases and exo-polygalacturonases together with rhamnogalacturonases form glycoside hydrolase family 28. Another exo-acting pectinolytic enzyme is exo-polygalacturonate lyase, which belongs to polysaccharide lyase families 2 or 9. Pectin lyases (polysaccharide lyase family 1) are endo-acting enzymes with an eliminative cleavage mechanism on pectin (methoxylated polygalacturonic acid) that produces unsaturated oligogalacturonides. Pectate lyases are endo-acting enzymes that catalyze eliminative cleavage of pectate, producing unsaturated oligogalacturonides. Pectate lyases are found in polysaccharide lyase families 1, 2, 3, 9, and 10. Pectin methyl esterases belong to carbohydrate esterase family 8 and hydrolyze methoxyl groups in pectin, producing pectate and methanol. Another pectin esterase is pectin acetyl esterase, which is present in carbohydrate esterase families 12 and 13. All of these enzymes are involved in the digestion of pectin-related polysaccharides of the plant cell wall.The source of genes for this study was DNA isolated directly from environmental soil samples. This recovered, highly purified DNA was used to make highly complex expression libraries. This methodology was developed to circumvent the inefficiency encountered in trying to grow all of the organisms present in the environmental samples. In this study, the model pectin substrate azo-rhamnogalacturonan was used to screen these environmental microbial genomic DNA libraries (6Short J.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1322-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in order to find novel pectinolytic enzymes with the potential to replace the chemicals currently used in the scouring process. Newly discovered pectate lyases were characterized and tested in a bioscouring application for optimal enzymatic properties when compared with the chemical scouring procedure. The best performing wild type enzyme was then evolved to deliver superior performance at higher temperatures using directed evolution approaches (7Palackal N. Brennan Y. Callen W.N. Dupree P. Frey G.

Microbiol. 2003; 52: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Optimization of the best wild type enzyme was undertaken by creating sequence variants, screening for improved enzyme characteristics, and then combining the beneficial sequence variations to create further improved variants. Initially, all possible single site mutants of the wild type enzyme were created using the Gene Site Saturation Mutagenesis (GSSM) 1The abbreviations used are: GSSM, Gene Site Saturation Mutagenesis; ORF, open reading frame; PGA, polygalacturonic acid; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; CBM, carbohydrate binding module; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: GSSM, Gene Site Saturation Mutagenesis; ORF, open reading frame; PGA, polygalacturonic acid; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; CBM, carbohydrate binding module; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. technology (9Kretz K.A. Richardson T.H. Gray K.A. Robertson D.E. Tan X. Short J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 388: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This comprehensive technique introduced point mutations into every position within the target gene, using degenerate primer sets containing 32 codons to generate a complete library of variants. Unlike rational mutagenesis, because of its ability to generate all mutations at all positions within the protein the GSSM technique does not require prior knowledge of the structure or mechanism of the target protein. Unbiased pools of variants are produced for screening and the number of amino acid substitutions is greatly expanded as compared with error-prone and chemical-based mutagenesis. Following the identification of multiple beneficial single amino acid substitutions, a library representing all possible combinations of the mutations was created using the Gene Reassembly technology that could be screened to identify the optimal enzyme for this application.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPectinolytic Enzyme Discovery, Expression Screening—More than 2,000 genomic DNA libraries from DNA purified directly from environmental samples, isolates, and primary enrichments have been constructed at Diversa Corporation. Samples were collected under formal agreement with all legal parties. The methods of generating these libraries have been described previously (6Short J.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1322-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11.Short, J. M. (September 28, 1999) U. S. Patent 5,958,672Google Scholar). These libraries represent a vast array of ecological niches and biotopes that span the globe. For pectinolytic enzyme discovery, libraries constructed from soil samples containing decaying plant material were targeted. Most of these libraries were constructed from samples from tropical areas like Bermuda, Costa Rica, and Indonesia. Up to 2,000,000 clones/library were plated on semisolid medium according to standard procedures. After plaques had formed, the plates were overlaid with molten substrate (2% azo-rhamnogalacturonan (Megazymes, Bray, Ireland) in 0.7% NZY Top agar). Plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight (∼18 h). Clear halos surrounding clones expressing activity against azo-rhamnogalacturonan were detected against the blue background. These clones were purified and excised into phagemids using standard techniques (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 2.25-2.105Google Scholar, 16Snead M.A. Alting-Mees M.A. Short J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 69: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar).Sequencing—Plasmid DNA was purified using Qiagen (Valencia, CA) Turbo96 kits on a Beckman (Fullerton, CA) Biomek® 2000 robot according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing reactions were performed using Applied Biosystems (ABI, Foster City, CA) PRISM® BigDye™ 3.0 terminator kits, using conditions recommended by ABI, and vector primers and internal primers as needed. The DNA sequence was determined using an ABI PRISM® 3700 DNA analyzer. Data were analyzed using Sequencher software from GeneCodes (Ann Arbor, MI).Annotation and Phylogenetic Analysis of Pectate Lyases—Sequenced DNA fragments encoding pectate lyase activity were annotated using a fully automated annotation pipeline program developed in-house. In brief, open reading frames (ORFs) were identified and then compared with publicly available protein sequences using standard procedures (BLASTP, SignalP, and Hidden Markov Model homology searches). Representative sequences from each pectate lyase family were extracted from the public databases and aligned with the new sequences using ClustalW followed by manual refinement. For phylogenetic analysis, only the pectate lyase catalytic domain of the proteins was used, because the variable additional domains of the different genes were difficult to align and may not be homologous. Regions in the catalytic domain that could not be reliably aligned were masked from the final alignments. Phylogenetic analysis was performed with the program PROML, which is part of the PHYLIP package, using a maximum likelihood method with Jones-Taylor-Thornton sequence matrix, equal rates, and five random sequence additions followed by global rearrangements. To assess confidence for branching order we used a Bayesian inference approach as implemented in the program MrBayes 3.0. Four Monte Carlo Markov chains were run for 800,000 generations after stabilization of the likelihood values, generating 8,000 trees. A majority rule consensus tree was generated, and the percentage of the time a particular clade occurred, i.e. its posterior probability, was recorded at the major nodes. Values higher than 80–85% were considered a strong support and are equivalent to high confidence values obtained by boot-strap analysis.Homology Modeling of Wild Type and 12×-Mutant—Homology models were constructed for both the wild type enzyme (BD9904) and for the hypothetical enzyme containing all 12 single site GSSM mutations (12×-mutant) using the nest module and default parameters of the protein structure modeling software Jackal (trantor.bioc.columbia.edu/programs/jackal). The homology models were based on the optimal alignment with the family 10 polysaccharide lyase (polygalacturonic acid lyase) from Cellvibrio (Protein Data Bank accession number 1GXN) (17Charnock S.J. Brown I.E. Turkenburg J.P. Black G.W. Davies G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12067-12072Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the optimal alignment, the sequence identity was 84% between 1GXN and the wild type enzyme and 83% between 1GXN and the 12×-mutant. Structure analysis of the homology models to calculate solvent-accessible surface areas and to identify hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions was performed with the program Molmol (18Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6469) Google Scholar).Pectate Lyase Activity Assay—Pectate lyase activity was routinely measured using 0.2% (w/v) polygalacturonic acid (Sigma) in 25 mm Tris/HCl, 25 mm glycine/NaOH, pH 9, buffer (PGA assay). Activity was determined by measuring a linear increase in absorbance at 235 nm for 5 min. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of protein that produced 1 μmol unsaturated oligogalacturonides/min, equivalent to 1 μmol unsaturated digalacturonide, using a molecular extinction coefficient for the dimer of 4600 m-1 cm-1 at 235 nm. Protein concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient specific for each protein based on its amino acid sequence. Specific activity was determined as units/mg of pure pectate lyase.Protein Expression and Purification—Pectate lyase genes were subcloned without native signal sequence (if predicted) into pSE420 expression vector (Invitrogen) and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli HMS174. The cultures (1 liter) were grown at 37 °C and 180 rpm to an A600 of ∼0.6 in Luria Bertani medium containing ampicillin and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were harvested ∼5 h post-induction. The bacterial pellets were resuspended in 25 ml of 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl and lysed by sonication (2 min in 15-s pulses). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 20 min. Pectate lyases were purified by single step cation exchange chromatography using an AKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The cleared lysates were diluted 7-fold with 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, and loaded onto a 5-ml CM-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The pectate lyase retained on the carboxyl methyl resin was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (10 column volumes 0–1 m NaCl in 50 mm MES, pH 6.0). The fractions containing active pectate lyase were identified by assaying enzyme activity using the PGA assay and by protein mobility on SDS-PAGE. Purified lyases were dialyzed against 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl for biochemical analysis and application testing.Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—Calorimetry was performed with a Model 6100 Nano II DSC apparatus (Calorimetry Sciences Corp., American Fork, UT) using the DSCRun software package for data acquisition and CpCalc for analysis. Analysis was carried out with 1 mg ml-1 recombinant protein in 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.2) and 100 mm NaCl at a scan rate of 1 °C min-1. The temperature range of each scan was 30–100 °C. A constant pressure of 3 atm was maintained during all DSC experiments to prevent possible degassing of the solution on heating. The instrument baseline was recorded routinely before the experiments with both cells filled with buffer. Reversibility of the thermally induced transitions was tested by reheating the solution in the calorimeter cell immediately after cooling.Scouring Application Assay—Bioscouring reactions were performed in a Mathis Labomat (Concord, NC) using 200-ml stainless steel vessels. Each reaction beaker featured a rubber penetrable septum that allowed for injection of enzyme samples via syringe. The fabric used for this assay consisted of 1.0-g swatches cut from 400 raw woven cotton (Testfabrics, Inc., West Pittston, PA) that had previously been desized by α-amylase treatment. Each beaker received one cotton swatch, 50 ml of 25 mm NaHCO3 buffer (pH 8.5), and 1.25 ml of a 1:10 dilution of Calloway Surfactant 1663 (Vulcan Performance Chemicals, Columbus, GA). Each enzyme was tested in duplicate, and each experiment included two blanks that received treatment without addition of enzyme. The samples were brought up to temperature, and 400 μl of the desired enzyme (at a concentration giving the desired enzyme dosage) was injected into the corresponding vessel. Reactions were carried out for 15 min, after which the cotton swatch was rinsed with H2O (2 × 400 ml) and soaked with 50 ml of NaOAc (5 g liter-1, pH 5) for 2 min. The swatches were then rinsed with diH2O and allowed to dry. The treated cotton swatches were placed into reaction beakers containing 100 ml of 50 mm Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 6) containing 0.05% Ruthenium Red (Sigma), heated to 50 °C in the Mathis Labomat, and allowed to dye for 30 min. The samples were then rinsed with H2O, placed into beakers containing 100 ml of H2O, and boiled at 100 °C for 10 min. Finally, they were rinsed twice more with H2O and allowed to dry. The quantity of pectin remaining on the samples was directly proportional to the intensity of the Ruthenium Red staining and was measured using a reflectometer (GregtagMacbeth Color-Eye 7000A; Kollmorgen Instrument Corp., New Windsor, NY). The reflectance of each sample (L*) was measured from eight locations on the swatch and averaged.Directed Evolution for Improved Thermostability—GSSM technology was employed as described (9Kretz K.A. Richardson T.H. Gray K.A. Robertson D.E. Tan X. Short J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 388: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19.Short, J. M. (January 9, 2001) U. S. Patent 6,171,820Google Scholar) using 32-fold degenerate oligonucleotides to randomize each codon in the gene so that all possible amino acids would be encoded. A combinatorial library containing all possible combinations of chosen single site mutants was constructed using Gene Reassembly technology (10.Short, J. M. (March 25, 2003) U. S. Patent 6,537,776Google Scholar, 13Richardson T.H. Tan X. Frey G. Callen W. Cabell M. Lam D. Macomber J. Short J.M. Robertson D.E. Miller C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26501-26507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The constructed GSSM and Gene Reassembly libraries were used to transform competent XL1-Blue E. coli (20Bullock W. Fernandez J. Short J. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 376-379Google Scholar). Colonies were picked from plates using an AutoGen Colony Picker (AutoGen, Framingham, MA) into 96-well plates containing Luria Bertani medium supplemented with 100 mg liter-1 ampicillin and grown overnight at 37 °C and 150 rpm. 176 clones were screened per residue site for the GSSM library (∼5× oversampling), and 13,000 clones (∼3× oversampling) from the combinatorial library were screened. Wild type clones were picked into one row of the 96-well plate as a control for the GSSM library screen. Replicas of each master plate were made using the automated plate replicator for recovery of improved mutant clones. After overnight growth, the A600 in each well was determined using the SpectraMax system (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The plates were sealed with foil and centrifuged at 2200 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 min. The PowerWasher system was used to aspirate the supernatant from the plates, leaving only the cells behind. Cells were resuspended in 20 μl of B-Per (Pierce), and the plates were resealed and shaken for 10 min. The plates were placed in an incubator at 50 °C for 50 min for the GSSM library screen and 70 °C for 25 min for the combinatorial library screen. The plates were removed from the incubator after undergoing heat challenge and cooled to room temperature. Substrate (180 μl of 0.2% PGA in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 25 mm glycine/NaOH, pH 9) was added to each well, and residual enzyme activity was measured by recording absorbance at 235 nm over a 2-min period using SpectraMax instrumentation and SoftmaxPro software (Molecular Devices). For the GSSM library screen, a positive clone was identified as a clone with 5× higher enzymatic rate than the wild type control. In the combinatorial library screen, a positive clone was identified as a clone showing pectate lyase activity over background. The primary hits were confirmed by secondary assay (repeat of primary assay) and subjected to DNA sequencing.RESULTSDiscovered Pectinolytic Enzymes—To target the discovery of pectinolytic enzymes, more than 100 environmental DNA libraries derived from niches rich in plant material (i.e. soil samples rich in decaying plant material) were screened for pectinolytic activity. More than 50 clones were discovered that possessed activity on azo-rhamnogalacturonan substrate. Each positive clone was sequenced, and ORFs were identified and annotated. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that within the ∼50 discovered clones there were >70 pectinolytic ORFs, including pectate lyases, pectinases, pectin methyl esterases, and exo-polygalacturonidases. All discovered clones contained either an ORF for a pectate lyase or a pectinase. Additionally, a few clones also encoded an adjacent pectin methylesterase or exo-polygalacturonase ORF. Many of the discovered pectate lyases were modular in structure and contained not only a pectate lyase catalytic domain belonging either to polysaccharide lyase families 1 or 10 but also a variety of other modules such as N- or C-terminal carbohydrate binding modules of family 2 and/or 35 (Fig. 2). A few of the pectinolytic enzymes discovered here also contained fibronectin type 3-like modules. These domains are common among bacterial extracellular glycohydrolases; however, their function has not yet been fully elucidated (21Kataeva I.A. Seidel III, R.D. Shah A. West L.T. Li X.L. Ljungdahl L.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 4292-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). No pectate lyases belonging to polysaccharide lyase families 2, 3, or 9 were found. Several bifunctional enzymes containing a pectin methylesterase domain and a pectate lyase domain from either polysaccharide lyase family 1 or 10 were also discovered. Previous to this study there has been only one report of an enzyme with this structure (22Kobayashi T. Sawada K. Sumitomo N. Hatada Y. Hagihara H. Ito S. World J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 19: 269-277Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In some of the polysaccharide lyase family 10 enzymes that were found there were domains that exhibited weak homology to galactose binding domains as well as to an unknown domain. This varied architecture highlights the structural and functional complexity of this group of enzymes. None of the pectinases or the exo-polygalacturonidases discovered here had modular structures (data not shown).Fig. 2Modular architecture of discovered pectate lyases.A, polysaccharide lyase family 1.

Fig. 3 shows newly discovered sequences, designated by BD prefixes, in relation to other known genes. In general, pectate lyase genes appear to have undergone a series of duplications, as reflected by the presence of multiple paralogues in some bacterial species. It is difficult to predict which bacterial species harbor the discovered genes using the mixed genome environmental DNA library approach (10.Short, J. M. (March 25, 2003) U. S. Patent 6,537,776Google Scholar, 11.Short, J. M. (September 28, 1999) U. S. Patent 5,958,672Google Scholar). However, based on sequence similarities, groups of enzymes have been discovered that appear to be closely related to enzymes found in species of Bacillus or Pectobacterium (polysaccharide lyase family 1 enzymes) and in Cellvibrio (polysaccharide lyase family 10 enzymes). A number of newly discovered genes, especially those belonging to family 10, do not seem to have any close relatives among known bacterial species.Fig. 3Phylogenetic analysis of discovered polysaccharide lyase family 1 and 10 pectate lyases. Several public pectate lyase sequences were added to the analysis. Maximum likelihood analysis. (Jones-Taylor-Thornton, equal rates, 5 random sequence additions and global rearrangements). Polysaccharide lyase family 1 is on the left and family 10 on the right. Enzymes performing the best in the bioscouring application are shaded gray in both families. Numbers represent confidence support in percentage, based on Bayesian inference consensus tree. Scale bar represents calculated amino acid substitutions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Bioscouring Activity of Pectate Lyases—Forty-two purified pectate lyases were subjected to a bioscouring application assay. In each test, an equal amount of enzyme was used for comparative purposes. Six pectate lyases showed substantially better bioscouring efficiency than the rest. Three of these enzymes are members of polysaccharide lyase family 1, and the other three belong to polysaccharide lyase family 10. For both families, the enzymes that exhibited good bioscouring activity also exhibited a degree of sequence similarity (see phylogenetic analysis, Fig. 3). The bioscouring activity of these enzymes was then compared with chemical scouring. Four enzymes (BD8761, BD9903, BD9904, and BD9600) showed equal or better scouring than that obtained with chemical treatment (data not shown). The best performing enzy"

Treatment with EGF stimulated global phosphorylation of the EGFR at Tyr845, Tyr992, Tyr1068, and Tyr1045 in glioblastoma cell lines (U-1242 MG and U-87 MG). Interestingly, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulated phosphorylation of the EGFR only at Tyr1068 in the two glioblastoma cell lines. Phosphorylation of the EGFR at Tyr1068 was not detected in normal human astrocytes treated with the phorbol ester.

Furthermore, gene silencing with PKCδ small interfering RNA (siRNA), siRNA against c-Src, and mutant c-Src(S12C/S48A) and treatment with a c-Src inhibitor (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl) pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine) abrogated PMA-induced EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr1068. PMA induced serine/threonine phosphorylation of Src, which was blocked by both BIM and rottlerin.

The effects of PMA on MAPK phosphorylation and glioblastoma cell proliferation were reduced by BIM, rottlerin, the MEK inhibitor U0126, and PKCδ and c-Src siRNAs.

The EGFR or ErbB family belongs to subclass I of the super-family of the receptor tyrosine kinases. Receptor tyrosine kinases represent an important subclass of these transmembrane proteins, with the EGFR being the most prominent representative. The EGFR controls a wide variety of biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration and modulation of apoptosis (13van der Geer P. Hunter T. Linberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). There are four members of the ErbB family: the EGFR (also termed ErbB1/HER1), ErbB2/Neu/HER2, ErbB3/HER3, and ErbB4/HER4. Members of the ErbB family are characterized by a modular structure consisting of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single hydrophobic transmembrane region, and the intracellular part harboring the highly conserved tyrosine kinase domain (14Prenzel N. Fischer O.M. Streit S. Hart S. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The ErbB receptors are activated by a number of ligands known as EGF-related peptide growth factors (15Riese II, D.J. Stern D.F.

These ligands include EGF, amphiregulin, and transforming growth factor-α, which bind specifically to ErbB1, betacellulin, heparin-binding EGF, and epiregulin, which exhibit dual specificity in that they bind ErbB1 and ErbB4. Neuregulin-1 and -2 both bind to ErbB3 and ErbB4 (16Chang H. Riese II, D.J. Gilbert W. Stern D.F. McMahan U.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), whereas neuregulin-3 and -4 bind to ErbB4 and not ErbB3 (17Zhang D. Sliwlkowski M.X. Mark M. Frantz G. Akita R. Sun Y.

The EGF-related peptide growth factors bind the extracellular domain of the ErbB receptor, leading to formation of homo- and heterodimers. Dimerization consequently stimulates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the receptors and triggers autophosphorylation of specific residues within the cytoplasmic domain. These phosphorylated residues serve as docking sites for signaling molecules involved in the regulation of intracellular cascades (19Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4611) Google Scholar). Activation of the EGFR in a large percentage of glioblastomas suggests an important role for this receptor in astrocytic tumor development. EGFR activation may therefore contribute to tumor malignancy by promoting invasion, proliferation, and metastasis (20Nishikawa R. Ji X.D. Harman R.C. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.J.

PKC comprises a family of phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases that play important roles in signal transduction associated with a variety of cellular responses, including cell growth and differentiation, gene expression, hormone secretion, and membrane function (24Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5760) Google Scholar, 25Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3536) Google Scholar, 26Basu A. Pharmacol.

Activation of PKC leads to the phosphorylation of proteins that are involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (28Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar, 29Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar, 30Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). PKC consists of at least 11 isoforms that show diversity in their structures, cellular distribution, and biological functions and that have been divided into three groups based on their structures and cofactor requirements (31Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The conventional PKC isoforms α, βI, βII, and γ require diacylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, and Ca2+ for activity. The novel PKC isoforms δ, ϵ, η, and θ do not require Ca2+ as a cofactor, but do require diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine. The atypical PKC isoforms ζ and ι/λ do not require Ca2+ and are not activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or diacylglycerol, but do bind to phosphatidylserine when active (24Nishizuka Y.

Furthermore, Samet et al. (37Samet M.J. Dewar B.J. Wu W. Graves M.L. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2003; 191: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have shown that Zn2+, a particulate matter, induces phosphorylation of the EGFR at Tyr1068 in addition to Tyr845 and Tyr1173. The mechanism through which PKC transactivates the EGFR is not fully understood. In this study, we examined the relationship between PKC and EGFR expression in glioblastoma cell lines to identify the PKC isoform and the intermediate downstream target involved in activation of the EGFR. The data suggest that PKCδ and c-Src are involved in transactivation of the EGFR and the glioblastoma mitogenic response to PMA. The existence of cross-talk between PKC activation and the receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR, which is overexpressed in >50% of primary GBMs, provides a novel signaling pathway that is altered in astrocytic tumors and that may provide a useful therapeutic target.

PKCδ and c-Src small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). Mutant c-Src(S12C/S48A) was made in our laboratory (S. J. P.). Cell Cultures—The human U-1242 MG cell line was kindly supplied by Dr. A. J. Yates (Ohio State University), and the U-87 MG cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Normal human astrocytes were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego). The cell lines were originally isolated from astrocytic tumors that were designated as glioblastomas, and their characteristics have been described previously by Hussaini et al. (38Hussaini I.M. Karns L.R. Vinton G. Carpenter J.E. Redpath G.T. Sando J.J. VanderBerg S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22348-22354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cell lines were regularly determined to be free of mycoplasma with reagent from Gen-Probe Inc. (San Diego). Cells were grown in modified α-minimal essential medium with 10% defined fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 20 μg/ml bovine zinc insulin (25.7 IU/mg; Sigma). The cells were cultured to 100% confluence, passaged every 4–5 days from an initial concentration of 6–8 × 103/cm2 in T flasks or 6- or 24-well plates, and cultured in astrocyte growth medium 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 90% relative humidity. Prior to assays, cultures that were 80–100% confluent were washed three times with serum-free medium before exposure to PMA (100 nm). In studies involving the pharmacological inhibitors, the inhibitors were added to the cells for 60 min before PMA. After the treatments, the medium was removed, and the cells were examined by Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—After the different treatments, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, and 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate and extracted with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% Nonidet P-40, in the presence of 2 mm EDTA, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Cells were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by the BCA protein assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins were boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE buffer. Proteins (200 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8% polyacrylamide gels and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose and reacted with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. Immunoblotted proteins were detected using the ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma). EGFR phosphorylation was stimulated in cells that had been cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h by incubation with either PMA (100 nm) or EGF (25 ng/ml) for 10–60 min. The incubation was terminated by the addition of ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate to the culture. PBS was then aspirated, and cells were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 in the presence of 2 mm EDTA, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mg/ml dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate. The 1% Triton X-100 extract was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 min, electrophoresed, and immuno-blotted as described above with mouse or rabbit antibodies specific for the EGFR. Densitometry and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) were used to quantitate the protein bands. siRNA Transfections—PKCδ and c-Src siRNAs were synthesized and purified by Dharmacon, Inc. PKCδ (200 nm) and c-Src (400 nm) siRNAs were transfected separately into both U-1242 MG and U-87 MG cells using the Amaxa Nucleofector™ (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, confluent cells were trypsinized and resuspended in Amaxa Nucleofector solution V at a density of 2 × 106/100 μl of solution, and either 200 nm PKCδ siRNA or 400 nm c-Src siRNA was added. Cells were transfected using the A23 pulsing program. Immediately after electroporation, cells were suspended in 4.9 ml of α-minimal essential medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C (39Maasho K. Marusina A. Reynolds N.M. Coligan J.E. Borrego F. J. Immunol. Methods. 2004; 284: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Similarly, 5 μg of mutant c-Src(S12C/S48A) was transfected into astrocytic tumor cells following a similar protocol. 48 h later, the cells were lysed as described above. The cell lysates (200 μg of proteins/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then electro-blotted onto nitrocellulose and reacted with anti-PKCδ monoclonal antibody, anti-PKCα polyclonal antibody, and anti-phospho-EGFR Tyr1068 antibody. The antibodies were detected with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody, and final detection was carried out using ECL reagents as described by the manufacturer. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were allowed to grow to 70–90% confluence. After starvation for 24 h in α-minimal essential medium containing no fetal bovine serum, cells were treated with EGF (25 ng/ml) or PMA (100 nm) for 10 and 30 min, respectively, at 37 °C. Other cultures were treated with the PKC inhibitor BIM (1 μm) and the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin (5 μm) for 60 min before the addition of PMA. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and extracted with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 in the presence of 2 mm EDTA, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell lysates were then subjected to centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. After normalization of supernatants derived from untreated and treated cells by protein concentration (Bio-Rad), 1 mg of each cell lysate was incubated with anti-c-Src-(2–17) monoclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected with protein G beads and washed five times with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Nonidet P-40. The resulting immunoprecipitate was then subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, followed by Western blot analysis with anti-phosphoserine/phosphothreonine and anti-c-Src-(2–17) antibodies using the ECL detection system. Incorporation of [3H]Thymidine into DNA—Relative rates of DNA synthesis were assessed by determination of [3H]thymidine incorporation. U-87 MG cells (4.5 × 104) were seeded onto a 24-well plate. Upon serum deprivation for 24 h, cells were subjected to a 60-min preincubation with BIM (1 μm), rottlerin (5 μm), PP2 (5 μm), AG 1478 (100 nm), or U0126 (10 μm), followed by treatment with PMA (100 nm) or EGF (25 ng/ml) for an additional 18 h. In another set of experiments, cells transfected with either siRNA directed against PKCδ or c-Src were also seeded onto a 24-well plate at a density of 4.5 × 104. Upon serum starvation, the transfected cells were treated with either PMA or EGF for 18 h. Cells were pulsed with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine for 6 h and washed with PBS. This was followed by 10-min washes with 10% trichloroacetic acid, first at 4 °C and then at room temperature. Cells were dissolved overnight in 1 n NaOH, neutralized with an equal volume of 2 n HCl, and placed in scintillation fluid. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was determined in a Beckman scintillation counter. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Differences between two or multiple groups were tested using analysis of variance, followed by a calculation of Fisher's least significant difference. Differences with a p value of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. PMA and EGF Induce EGFR Tyrosine Phosphorylation in Glioblastoma Cells—Two well characterized glioblastoma cell lines (U-1242 MG and U-87 MG) were used for phosphorylation studies using EGF and PMA. The U-1242 MG cells have mutant p53 (40Uhrbom L. Nister M. Westermark B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), whereas the U-87 MG cells express wild-type p53 and mutant PTEN (41Bostrom J. Cobbers J.M. Wolter M. Tabatabai G. Weber R.G. Licher P. Collins V.P. Reifenberger G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 29-33PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with EGF (25 ng/ml) induced EGFR phosphorylation at all tyrosine residues tested: Tyr1068, Tyr1045, Tyr992, and Tyr845. The phosphorylation induced by EGF was time-dependent (Fig. 1). The two cell lines showed detectable levels of total EGFR, which was not altered by transient treatment with EGF for 10–60 min. Unlike EGF, treatment of the cells with PMA (100 nm) did not induce global phosphorylation of all the tyrosine residues. Only one of the major autophosphorylation sites of the EGFR (Tyr1068) in U-1242 MG and U-87 MG cells was phosphorylated (Fig. 2). Similarly, PMA did not change the level of total EGFR protein. When the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibody and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-EGFR Tyr1068 antibody, both PMA and EGF induced EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr1068 (Fig. 3). The specificity of the antibody against EGFR Tyr1068 was confirmed in NIH3T3 cells expressing a Tyr1068 mutant in which the tyrosine has been replaced with phenylalanine (data not shown). In contrast, treatment of normal human astrocytes with PMA (100 nm) for 30 min did not induce EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr1068, even though the cells express the receptor (Fig. 4).Fig. 2PMA induces phosphorylation of the EGFR at Tyr1068. Serum-starved U-1242 MG and U-87 MG cells were treated with PMA (100 nm) at different time points (0, 10, 30, and 60 min). Triton-solubilized astrocytic tumor cell lysates (200 μg/lane) were separated using 8% polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. The blots were probed with antibodies against phospho-EGFR Tyr1068 and total EGFR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3PMA stimulates phosphorylation of the EGFR at Tyr1068. Serum-starved U-1242 MG and U-87 MG cells were stimulated with PMA for the indicated time periods. These cells were lysed using 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer after washing with ice-cold PBS. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (I.P.) with anti-EGFR antibody and then Western-blotted (W.B.) with antibody against phosphoEGFR Tyr1068 or total EGFR. N.C, negative antibody control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4Effect of PMA and EGF on normal human astrocytes. Normal human astrocytes cells grown to 80–100% confluence were serum-starved overnight. The cells were then treated with PMA (100 nm) for 30 min and EGF (25 ng/ml) for 10 min. Protein lysates (200 μg/lane) were fractionated using 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. The blots were probed with antibody to EGFR Tyr1068. The membrane was stripped and reprobed for total EGFR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Effect of Pharmacological Inhibitors on PMA-induced EGFR Phosphorylation—Since PMA interacts with and activates both classical (α, βI, βII, and γ) and novel (η, δ, ϵ, and θ) PKC isozymes, we designed experiments to identify the PKC isozyme(s) mediating PMA-induced phosphorylation of the EGFR at Tyr1068. Studies from our laboratory and others have shown that BIM inhibits activation of both novel and classical PKCs, whereas Gö 6976 blocks the activities of classical PKCs only. To determine whether classical or novel PKC isozymes are involved in PMA-induced Tyr1068 phosphorylation, we pre-treated the cells with either BIM (1 μm) or Gö 6976 (10 μm) for 60 min prior to PMA addition to the cultures. BIM attenuated PMA-induced EGFR phosphorylation in both U-87 MG and U-1242 MG, whereas Gö 6976 had no effect on PMA-induced phosphorylation of Tyr1068 (Fig. 5). Since BIM but not Gö 6976 inhibited PMA-induced EGFR phosphorylation, we targeted the novel PKC isozymes to identify the mediator of the PMA effect. To determine whether PKCδ is involved, we used the PKCδ-specific inhibitor rottlerin (5 μm). In the presence of rottlerin, PMA-induced phosphorylation of the EGFR was inhibited (Fig. 5), suggesting that PKCδ might mediate the response to PMA. Incubation of both U-1242 MG and U-87 MG cells with ingenol (100 nm), a PKCϵ agonist, did not differentially phosphorylate EGFR at Tyr1068 compared with untreated cells (data not shown). Some pharmacological inhibitors may not be truly specific; for example, apart from inhibiting PKCδ, rottlerin also uncouples mitochondrial ATP production (42Soltoff S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37986-37992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, an alternative approach to down-regulate PKCδ isozyme expression was adopted. PKCδ siRNA (200 nm) was transfected into astrocytic tumor cells for 48 h, followed by the addition of PMA (100 nm) for 30 min. Importantly, however, PKCδ gene silencing down-regulated PKCδ by 90% in U-1242 MG and by almost 100% in U-87 MG cells (Fig. 6, A and B). PKCδ gene silencing abolished PMA-induced EGFR Tyr1068 phosphorylation. We also probed for the expression of PKCα to demonstrate the specificity of PKCδ siRNA. The level of PKCα or tubulin (used as loading control) was not changed. Control transfections had no effect on this signaling pathway. Involvement of Src in PMA Transactivation of the EGFR— The data presented above suggest that PMA-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated by PKCδ. However, PKCδ is a serine/threonine kinase and not a tyrosine kinase. What then is the intermediate kinase between PKCδ and the EGFR? The non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src has been shown to phosphorylate the EGFR at Tyr845 in the C3H1oT1/2 murine fibro-blast cell line and the MDA468 breast cancer cell line (43Biscardi J.S. Tice D.A. Parsons S.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1999; 76: 61-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and at Tyr1068 in A431 human epidermoid cells (37Samet M.J. Dewar B.J. Wu W. Graves M.L. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2003; 191: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the effect of the c-Src kinase-specific inhibitor PP2 and the inactive isomer PP3 on EGFR phosphorylation in glioblastoma cell lines exposed to PMA (100 nm). As expected, the addition of PMA caused phosphorylation of the EGFR at Tyr1068. Pretreatment of glioblastoma cell lines for 60 min with PP2 (5 μm) blocked PMA-induced phosphorylation of the EGFR at Tyr1068 by 90%, but the inactive isomer did not attenuate this effect (Fig. 5). To reconfirm our data on the role of c-Src in mediating the transactivation of EGFR Tyr1068 phosphorylation by PMA, we used siRNA against c-Src. c-Src siRNA (400 nm) w"

When associated with the SecY complex, SecA undergoes repeated cycles of ATP-dependent conformational changes, which are linked to the movement of successive segments of a polypeptide chain through the channel (15Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 16Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5574-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However the mechanism employed by SecA to translocate substrates polypeptide chains through the SecY channel remains largely unknown. An important issue concerning the function of SecA is its oligomeric state during translocation. SecA is a dimer in solution (17Akita M. Shinkai A. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Doyle S.M. Braswell E.H. Teschke C.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11667-11676Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and previous work argued that this is its functional state (19Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13190-13197Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). An x-ray structure of Bacillus subtilis SecA also indicates the existence of a dimer (7Hunt J.F. Weinkauf S. Henry L. Fak J.J. McNicholas P. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 297: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence raises the possibility that SecA might actually function as a monomer; in solution, SecA dimers are in rapid equilibrium with monomers (20Woodbury R.L. Hardy S.J.S. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 21Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although the equilibrium favors dimers, it is shifted almost completely toward monomers in the presence of membranes containing acidic phospholipids or upon binding to the SecY complex (21Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A synthetic signal peptide had a similar effect, although this result is controversial (22Benach J. Chou Y.-T. Fak J.J. Itkin A. Nicolae D.D. Smith P.C. Wittrock G. Floyd D.L. Golsaz C.M. Gierasch L.M. Gierasch F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3628-3638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A monomeric derivative of SecA containing six point mutations retained some in vitro translocation activity (21Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), but the low level of translocation precluded any firm conclusion. In addition, the previous results do not exclude models in which SecA cycles between monomeric and oligomeric states during the translocation of a polypeptide chain (22Benach J. Chou Y.-T. Fak J.J. Itkin A. Nicolae D.D. Smith P.C. Wittrock G. Floyd D.L. Golsaz C.M. Gierasch L.M. Gierasch F.H. J. Biol.

Most importantly, the functional oligomeric state of SecA in vivo remains to be established. In this report, we have tested whether SecA can function as a monomer in vivo. Guided by the x-ray structure of B. subtilis SecA (7Hunt J.F. Weinkauf S. Henry L. Fak J.J. McNicholas P. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 297: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), we generated a monomeric derivative of Escherichia coli SecA that lacks the first 11 amino acids. The monomeric derivative retains significant activity in various in vitro assays and can substitute for endogenous SecA in vivo. Cross-linking experiments in intact cells indicate that even the parental dimeric derivative is mostly present as a monomer. Our results therefore suggest that SecA functions as a monomer. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—Table I lists the bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work. The segment containing the arabinose promoter and the AraC gene on pBAD22 was amplified by PCR using the primers BclIBAD5pr (gtacgtgatcatgcataatgtgcctgtcaaatggac) and SecABAD3pr (gtgcgatcgttacgactaccgaaaactttagttaacaatttgattagcatggtgaattcctcctgctagccc). The kanamycin resistance gene was amplified from pBAD18 using BglIIKan3pr (gcttagatctgcctcgtgaagaaggtgttgctgac) and SecMKan5pr (gtgcgaacgctgttttcttaagcacttttccgcacaacttatcttcattcaagccacgttgtgtctcaaaatctc). The PCR-amplified fragments were digested with either BclI (araC-PBAD) or BglII (kan) and ligated to each other. The ligation mixture was digested with BclI and BglII, and the product fragment was amplified by PCR using SecMKan5pr and SecABAD3pr. The amplified linear cassette (SecM(-50–1)-kan-araC-PBAD-SecA(1–50)) was used to replace the chromosomal region between SecM(+1) and SecA(–1) by homologous recombination using strain DY378 as described (24Yu D.

The resulting strain, EO527, requires arabinose for growth. Strain EO528 was generated by P1 transduction of the prlA4 allele into strain EO527. The presence of the prlA4 mutation was confirmed by sequencing. Strain EO529 was generated by P1 transduction of kan-araC-PBAD-SecA from EO527 into strain SMG96. Δ11/N95 was constructed from pT7N95-SecA (21Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) by PCR-based deletion of residues Leu2–Gly11. N95 and Δ11/N95 were amplified by PCR and cloned between the NcoI and BamHI sites of pDSW204 (25Weiss D.S. Chen J.C. Ghigo J.-M. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 508-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), generating pDSW204N95 and pDSW204Δ11/N95, respectively. Δ11/N95 was also cloned between the BamHI and NotI sites of pET21 (Novagene). The mutations S636C and Q801C were introduced into pT7N95-SecA(C98S) using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Invitrogen) and confirmed by sequencing. The double-cycteine construct, N95(CC), was used to generate Δ11/N95(CC) by PCR-based deletion. Both constructs were then amplified by PCR and cloned between the NcoI and BamHI site of pDSW204, yielding plasmids pDSW204N95(CC) and pDSW204Δ11/N95(CC), respectively.Table IBacterial strains and plasmids used in this workPlasmidsDescriptionSource or referencepT7N95-SecApT7-SecA(Met1-Val831)-His6Ref. 21Or E.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To follow the kinetics of translocation, 40-μl aliquots were withdrawn from a master mixture (380 μl) at different times and mixed with 160 μl of ice-cold 75 mm KCl, 50 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.5. Samples were then processed as usual. Disulfide Cross-linking of SecA Derivatives—Strains EO529 and EO527 expressing N95(CC) from pDSW204N95(CC) were grown in LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 30 °C for 5 h.

Aliquots of 1.5 ml of culture were withdrawn, mixed with 150 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid, incubated on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Pellets were washed with ice-cold acetone, incubated on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged again.

In Vivo Pulse-Chase Labeling of Pro-OmpA—Cells were grown at 30 °C in minimal glycerol medium (M63 salts with 0.5% glycerol, vitamin B1 (1 μg/ml), vitamin B5 (2 μg/ml), 1 mm MgSO4, 18 amino acids, each at 50 μg/ml, and 0.005% yeast extract). Early log phase cells (7.5 ml) were pulsed with 0.1 mCi of [35S]methionine for 20 s, and chase was initiated by adding 750 μl of 1% methionine, chloramphenicol (1 mg/ml). Samples (1 ml) were removed at the indicated times and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid as described (28Katzen F. Beckwith J. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 54-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Acetone-washed pellets were solubilized with 25 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and OmpA was immunoprecipitated using OmpA antibodies and protein A. Generation of a Monomeric Derivative of SecA—We previously generated a monomeric SecA derivative by mutagenizing into alanines six residues that we suspected to be important for dimerization (21Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of B. subtilis SecA (7Hunt J.F. Weinkauf S. Henry L. Fak J.J. McNicholas P. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 297: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) later showed that four of the six residues were indeed close to the interface between the monomers. However, the derivative exhibited low translocation activity in vitro, probably because the specific mutations had additional effects. The x-ray structure of B. subtilis SecA now offers a more rational design of a monomeric derivative. In the crystal, SecA is a dimer with the monomers arranged head-to-tail (7Hunt J.F. Weinkauf S. Henry L. Fak J.J. McNicholas P. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 297: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Most of the intersubunit contacts are contributed by the first nine residues of each subunit (Met1–Phe9), which contact side chains in the C-terminal domain of the other subunit (Fig. 1). To test whether these residues are crucial for dimer stability, we deleted the corresponding sequence (2LIKLLTKVFG11) from N95, an E. coli SecA derivative that lacks the last 70 residues. We used N95 as a starting point, because it is shorter than SecA and yet is fully dimeric and functional (21Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 29Matsuyama S. Kimura E. Mizushima S. J. Biol.

Commun. 1990; 172: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Also, the last 70 residues contribute slightly to dimer formation (data not shown). After sucrose gradient centrifugation, the parental N95 dimer (189 kDa) migrated in fractions 15–17, close to full-length SecA (fraction 18, 204 kDa; Fig. 2). In contrast, the derivative Δ11/N95, lacking residues Leu2–Gly11, migrated in fractions 11–13, close to the position of bovine serum albumin (fraction 9, 70 kDa) and consistent with it being monomeric. Quantification of the experiment showed that at most 1% of Δ11/N95 exists as dimers (data not shown). Cross-linking experiments using EDC (17Akita M. Shinkai A. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 21Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) supported the conclusion that Δ11/N95 is monomeric (Fig. 3E).Fig. 2Deletion of the 11 N-terminal residues converts dimeric N95(SecA) into a monomer. Purified N95(SecA) and Δ11/N95 (90 μg each) were subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation. Twenty-four 520-μl fractions were collected, and 60-μl aliquots from fractions 1–20 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining.

C, pro-OmpA (0.25 μg), spiked with [35S]Met-pro-OmpA, was incubated for 15 min with SecA or with Δ11/N95 in the presence of proteoliposomes containing either wild type SecY or SecY(prlA4) complex.

We first measured their binding affinity to the SecY channel. Increasing amounts of SecA or Δ11/N95 were mixed with a constant amount of 125I-SecA and incubated with proteoliposomes containing the SecY complex (Fig. 3A). As the amount of unlabeled competitor was increased, the level of 125I-SecA bound to reconstituted SecY decreased. A binding constant of 224 ± 19 nm was calculated for wild type SecA (Fig. 3A, circles), in close agreement with previous data (31Dapic V. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25000-25007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The monomeric derivative, Δ11/N95, had an only 2-fold lower affinity of 447 ± 32 nm (triangles). About 28% of the bound 125I-SecA could not be competed away by Δ11/N95, perhaps because the N-terminal residues of SecA have a secondary binding site at SecY. Previous experiments had shown that the prlA4 signal sequence suppressor mutation in SecY (32Emr S.D. Hanley-Way S. Silhavy T.J. Cell. 1981; 23: 79-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) enhances the activity of a monomeric derivative of SecA ∼5-fold (21Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We therefore tested proteoliposomes containing the mutant SecY complex for its ability to bind Δ11/N95. The affinities for SecA and Δ11/N95 were a little higher than with wild type SecY (173 ± 12 and 305 ± 23 nm, respectively), and again, the monomeric SecA derivative, Δ11/N95, had only a slightly reduced affinity for the SecY complex. We next compared the translocation ATPase activity of SecA and Δ11/N95 under conditions where the ATPase activity is proportional to the protein concentration (Fig. 3B). SecA and Δ11/N95 exhibited the same low basal ATPase activity (∼6.5 mol of ATP/mol of protein/min; Fig. 3B, closed and open triangles, respectively). The addition of both SecY complex-containing proteoliposomes and translocation substrate (pro-OmpA), stimulated the ATPase activity of SecA and of Δ11/N95 by a factor of 16 and 10, respectively (closed and open circles, respectively). With SecY(prlA4) proteoliposomes, the factor of stimulation was 13 and 12, respectively (closed and open squares, respectively). Thus, the monomeric derivative has almost the same level of translocation ATPase activity as wild type SecA. To compare the translocation activities of SecA and Δ11/N95, they were incubated with SecY complex-containing proteoliposomes, ATP, and [35S]Met-pro-OmpA. Translocated pro-OmpA was detected by its resistance to protease treatment (Fig. 3C). We found that Δ11/N95 translocated 16% of the amount of pro-OmpA compared with wild type SecA (Fig. 3C, SecY). With SecY(prlA4) complex-containing proteoliposomes, the translocation efficiency of Δ11/N95 increased to 74% (Fig. 3C, prlA4). The kinetics of translocation was almost the same for SecA and Δ11/N95 (Fig. 3D; see inset for raw data). As expected, no protease-protected pro-OmpA was seen in the absence of ATP or when Triton X-100 was added during proteolysis (Fig. 3D, inset). Together, these results show that the Δ11/N95 monomer retains significant activity in several in vitro assays. To exclude the possibility that Δ11/N95 dimerizes when bound to the SecY(prlA4) complex, we performed cross-linking experiments with the carbodiimide EDC. Wild type SecA on its own showed strong dimer cross-links, and these were reduced upon the addition of proteoliposomes containing SecY(prlA4) complex (Fig. 3E, lanes 1 and 2), in agreement with previous experiments showing dissociation of wild type SecA under these conditions (21Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Δ11/N95 did not give rise to dimer cross-links in the absence or presence of proteoliposomes (Fig. 3E, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that it remains monomeric when bound to SecY(prlA4). The Monomeric Derivative Δ11/N95 Supports Cell Growth—To test the activity of Δ11/N95 in vivo, we constructed E. coli strain EO527, in which the 5′ regulatory region of the chromosomal SecA gene (∼300 bp) was replaced with the tightly regulated arabinose promoter. This promoter is active in the presence of arabinose but is turned off completely in the presence of glucose. Indeed, strain EO527 exhibited robust growth in arabinose (doubling time of 45 min), but upon a switch to glucose, the cells stopped growing after 4 h (Fig. 4A). This was paralleled by the expression of SecA; whereas in the presence of arabinose SecA was expressed at similar levels throughout the experiment (Fig. 4B, +Arabinose), its expression dropped to negligible levels 4 h after the switch to glucose (+Glucose). These data are consistent with SecA being essential for viability of E. coli (33Liss L.R. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2299-2303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Next we tested whether Δ11/N95 can replace SecA and support growth of EO527 cells when expression of chromosomal SecA is shut down. N95 and Δ11/N95 were cloned into the plasmid pDSW204 under the control of an attenuated IPTG-driven promoter (25Weiss D.S. Chen J.C. Ghigo J.-M. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 508-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two plasmids and, as a control, the empty vector were each introduced into EO527 cells. It should be noted that the deletion of the sequence coding for Leu2–Gly11 also removes a segment, which plays a key role in translation initiation (34Etchegaray J.-P. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10079-10085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), resulting in much lower expression levels of the Δ11/N95 construct. As expected, all strains grew on plates containing arabinose due to the expression of chromosomal SecA (Fig. 4C, left plate, lower half). On glucose plates lacking IPTG, only the N95-expressing construct gave viable cells (middle plate, lower half). As expected, the incomplete repression of the promoter by the Lac repressor allowed N95 to be made at levels sufficient for growth. Immunoblotting showed that even in the absence of IPTG, N95 was still made in significant amounts (Supplementary Fig. S1). The Δ11/N95 construct did not support growth in the absence of IPTG, consistent with its negligible basal expression level (see Fig. 5D). In the presence of IPTG, both N95 and Δ11/N95 supported growth (right plate, lower half). Immunoblots showed that, in the presence of arabinose, the full-length SecA protein was synthesized from the chromosomal gene, whereas in the presence of IPTG and absence of arabinose, only the plasmidencoded Δ11/N95 protein was made (Fig. 4D, lane 2 versus lane 1). These data show that Δ11/N95 is responsible for cell growth under these conditions. We performed similar experiments using strain EO528, which differs from EO527 by harboring the prlA4 mutation in its chromosomal SecY gene (Fig. 4C, upper halves of the plates). Again, Δ11/N95 supported cell growth only in the presence of IPTG (compare right and middle plates). Interestingly, N95 supported growth in the absence but not in the presence of IPTG. This is explained by the massive overexpression of N95 in the presence of IPTG, which inhibits growth of strain EO528 (Supplemental Fig. S1). To compare the efficiency of Δ11/N95 with wild type SecA in a quantitative manner, we determined the growth rates of cells expressing similar levels of either protein. In the presence of arabinose, EO527 cells had a growth rate that approached that of the parental strain DY378 (Fig. 5A). In the absence of arabinose and presence of IPTG, plasmid-borne Δ11/N95 supported a growth rate that reached 85% of that of the parental strain DY378 (Fig. 5B). Immunoblotting for SecA showed that after induction, the levels of SecA and Δ11/N95 were about equal (Fig. 5, C versus D). These data therefore indicate that the monomeric derivative is almos"
https://openalex.org/W1969575124,"The [PSI+] prion determinant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae causes nonsense suppressor phenotype due to a reduced function of the translation termination factor Sup35 (eRF3) polymerized into amyloid fibrils. Prion state of the Rnq1 protein, [PIN+], is required for the [PSI+] de novo generation but not propagation. Yeast [psi–] [PIN+] cells overproducing Sup35 can exhibit nonsense suppression without generation of a stable [PSI+].

Sup35 polymers contain Rnq1, confirming a hypothesis that Rnq1 polymers seed Sup35 polymerization. About 10% of cells overproducing Sup35 form colonies on medium selective for suppression, which suggests that the proportion of Sup35 monomers to polymers varies between cells of transformants, allowing selection of cells deficient for soluble Sup35. A hybrid Sup35 with the N-terminal domain replaced for 66 glutamine residues also polymerizes and can cause nonsense suppression when overproduced. The described polymers of these proteins differ from the [PSI+] polymers by poor heritability and very high frequency of the de novo appearance, thus being more similar to amyloids than to prions.

The described polymers of these proteins differ from the [PSI+] polymers by poor heritability and very high frequency of the de novo appearance, thus being more similar to amyloids than to prions. The Sup35 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae belongs to the family of eRF3, one of the two key factors required for the termination of translation in eukaryotes (1Stansfield I. Jones K.M. Kushnirov V.V. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Poznyakovski A.I. Paushkin S.V. Nierras C.R. Cox B.S. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Tuite M.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4365-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). This protein has a three-domain structure, but only its C-terminal part (C domain) of 432 amino acids is responsible for the function in translation termination and conserved (2Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Kushnirov V.V. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Didichenko S.A. Chernoff Y.O. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Smirnov V.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The N-terminal (N) Sup35 domain of 123 amino acids allows protein to switch into the aggregated prion-like state. This aggregation reduces the efficiency of translation termination, which manifests as nonsense-suppressor cytoplasmically inherited determinant [PSI+]. The middle domain (M, residues 124–253) is inessential for [PSI+], although it may be important for its stability (3Liu J.J. Sondheimer N. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S A. 2002; 99: 16446-16453Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and is involved in the [PSI+] strain variation (4Bradley M.E. Liebman S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Reduction of the Sup35 function due to its mutations or underproduction also causes nonsense suppression. Surprisingly, overproduction of Sup35 may have the same effect. Transient overproduction of Sup35 can cause its rare conversion into the prion form, which could be revealed by the appearance of a small proportion of cells carrying the nonsense suppressor [PSI+] determinants, which are then able to propagate at the normal levels of Sup35 (5Chernoff Y.O. Derkatch I.L. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Continuous Sup35 overproduction causes frequent appearance of cells with the suppressor phenotype without generation of [PSI+]. Such cells differ from the [PSI+]-carrying cells since their suppressor phenotype is manifested only at increased Sup35 levels (6Chernoff Y.O. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Derkach I.L. Ptyushkina M.V. Tarunina O.V. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Yeast. 1992; 8: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of such “multicopy” suppression is not clear, although it appears to be related to [PSI+] since the suppressor effect of Sup35 overdose depends both on the presence of Sup35 prion-forming domain (2Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Kushnirov V.V. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Didichenko S.A. Chernoff Y.O. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Smirnov V.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and on the prion form of the Rnq1 protein ([PIN+] determinant), which allows induction of [PSI+] upon Sup35 overproduction (7Derkatch I.L. Bradley M.E. Zhou P. Chernoff Y.O. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 1997; 147: 507-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), probably by seeding its polymerization (8Derkatch I.L. Uptain S.M. Outeiro T.F. Krishnan R. Lindquist S.L. Liebman S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12934-12939Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Here, we show that in [psi–][PIN+] cells, overproduced Sup35 is present mostly as amyloid aggregates, which differ from the Sup35 prion amyloids by much higher frequency of appearance and lower efficiency of Sup35 polymerization. Due to this, such cells show normal nonsense codon readthrough but easily develop the suppressor phenotype upon selective pressure. Similar properties were observed for the hybrid Sup35, in which the N domain was replaced for a sequence of 66 glutamine residues. Thus, yeast Sup35 can form non-heritable amyloid structures, which may have phenotypic manifestation. Strains and Genetic Methods—In most cases, the 74-D694 (MATaura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1–289 his3-Δ200 ade1–14) strain (9Chernoff Y.O. Lindquist S.L. Ono B. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W. Science. 1995; 268: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar) and its derivative 74-D694/Q66 (obtained by replacing SUP35 for the chimerical SUP35-Q66 allele encoding glutamines 1–66 instead of amino acids 1–120 of Sup35 under control of MET17 promoter, see below) were used. Since the ade1–14 UGA mutation carried by this strain caused accumulation of red pigment, its suppression (suppressor phenotype, Sup+) could be easily detected by the appearance of colonies with lighter color (white or pink, depending on the suppression efficiency). The 5V-H19 (MATaura3–52 leu2–3,112 ade2–1 SUQ5) and 1–5V-H19 (same, but with the SUP35-C allele, which lacks a region encoding the N and M domains of Sup35) strains were also used in some experiments (10Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Kushnirov V.V. Smirnov V.N. Genetics. 1994; 137: 671-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast were grown at 30 °C in rich (YPD, 10 g of yeast extract, 20 g of peptone, 20 g of glucose/liter) or synthetic (6.7 g of yeast nitrogen base, 20 g of glucose supplemented with the required amino acids) medium. Selective media lacking leucine, uracil, or adenine are designated as –Leu, –Ura, or –Ade, respectively. To select cells that have lost URA3 plasmids, corresponding transformants were grown on 5-fluoroorotic acid medium (11Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 184-185Google Scholar). To cure cells of the [PSI+] determinants, corresponding strains were grown from single cells to colonies on medium containing 3 mm guanidine hydrochloride (12Tuite M.F. Mundy C.R. Cox B.S. Genetics. 1981; 98: 691-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids—YEplac181-SUP35 was constructed by inserting the XhoI-XbaI fragment of SUP35 into the SalI and XbaI sites of YEplac181. The HpaI-XbaI fragment of YEplac181-SUP35 encoding the Sup35 C domain was replaced for the eGFP gene as SmaI-XbaI fragment from peGFP (Clontech). The plasmid yex4Sup35NM6His was obtained from yex4-SUP35 (2Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Kushnirov V.V. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Didichenko S.A. Chernoff Y.O. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Smirnov V.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) by removing the ClaI fragment encoding LEU2 and replacing the BclI-XbaI fragment encoding the Sup35 C domain with oligonucleotides encoding 6 histidines. yex4MetQ66MC35 also derives from yex4-SUP35. The SUP35 promoter starting from the MluI site (position –383) was replaced by the PCR-amplified MET17 promoter starting from position –429. The expressed open reading frame encodes (MPSHFGGSETS, the first amino acids of Met17)-Met-(Glu, 66 residues)-(Sup35 starting from serine 121). To replace the chromosomal SUP35 gene for the SUP35-Q66 allele, the 74-D694 [PSI+] strain was co-transformed with the XhoI-XbaI fragment of yex4MetQ66MC35 and the YEplac181 vector. The transformants with replaced SUP35 gene were distinguished by red colony color (since this eliminated [PSI+]) and then checked by immunoblotting for the presence of altered Sup35 protein. In this strain, the MET17 promoter provided expression of the hybrid protein at a level slightly exceeding that of the native SUP35 promoter (data not shown). Plasmid yex4MetQ66MC35ΔS was obtained from yex4MetQ66MC35 by deletion of SalI fragment encoding amino acids 483–685 of Sup35. To obtain pBC-RNQ1, the RNQ1 gene, including 487 bp upstream and 186 bp downstream of it, was amplified from yeast genomic DNA and inserted into pBC KS+ by XhoI and EclI36II sites. To disrupt RNQ1, the plasmid pBC-rnq1::HIS3 was constructed by inserting the NsiI-BamHI fragment from pBC-HIS3 (BamHI genomic fragment, containing the HIS3 gene, was inserted into the BamHI site of pBC KS+) into the pBC-RNQ1 plasmid cut by NsiI and BglII. Yeast cells containing Sup35 or Q66-Sup35MC aggregates were transformed by the EcoRV-SnaBI fragment of the pBC-rnq1::HIS3 plasmid carrying the RNQ1 gene disrupted by HIS3. RNQ1 disruption events were confirmed by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates for Rnq1. Preparation and Analysis of Yeast Cell Lysates—Yeast cultures were grown in liquid media to an A600 of 1.5. The cells were harvested, washed in water, and lysed by glass beads in buffer A: 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. To prevent proteolytic degradation, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) were added. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 3 min. To equalize the amount of protein in electrophoretic samples, the protein concentration was determined according to Ref. 13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar. To determine the size distribution of Sup35, the cell lysates were fractionated by centrifugation through 20% sucrose cushion in the SW-50 rotor (Beckman) for 30 min at 35,000 rpm (170,000 × g). The in vitro conversion of Sup35 into prion-like aggregated form was performed according to Ref. 14Paushkin S.V. Kushnirov V.V. Smirnov V.N. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Science. 1997; 277: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar. To isolate the Sup35 amyloid-like polymers, the 1–5V-H19 strain was transformed with multicopy plasmids YEplac181-SUP35 and yex4Sup35NM6His and grown in 2 liters of synthetic media. Lysates were obtained as described above and centrifuged in Ti-75 rotor (Beckman) at 40,000 rpm for 2 h. The pellets were dissolved in buffer A containing 2% SDS and centrifuged through 1 ml of 0.1% SDS 30% sucrose cushion in Ti-75 for 10 h at 45,000 rpm, 13 °C. The top of the pellet, containing GFP, 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; SDD-AGE, semidenaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis. was dissolved in buffer A containing 0.05% SDS and incubated with Talon resin (Clontech) overnight at 13 °C. Then the Talon beads were washed with the same buffer, eluted with 50 mm EDTA, and analyzed by Western blotting for Sup35 and Rnq1. The developed blots were scanned and quantified to determine the proportions between Rnq1 and Sup35. Electrophoresis—Protein electrophoresis in 9% polyacrylamide gels was performed according to Ref. 15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar except that, where indicated, boiling of the samples was avoided, and agarose was used for the concentrating gel. For separation of prion particles, we used horizontal 1.8% agarose gels in the Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.E. Maniatis T. Second Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. B.23. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with 0.1% SDS. Samples were incubated in the sample buffer (0.5× Tris-acetate-EDTA, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue) for 5 min at 37 °C (17Kryndushkin D.S. Alexandrov I.M. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Kushnirov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49636-49643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). After the electrophoresis, proteins were transferred from gels to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride sheets (Millipore) by vacuum blotting overnight (agarose gels) or electrophoretically (acrylamide gels). Bound antibody was detected using the Amersham Biosciences ECL system. Determination of the Nonsense Readthrough—The levels of nonsense codon readthrough were determined as a ratio of β-galactosidase activity in cells transformed with pUKC817, -818, and -819 plasmids to that in cells with pUKC815 as described previously (1Stansfield I. Jones K.M. Kushnirov V.V. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Poznyakovski A.I. Paushkin S.V. Nierras C.R. Cox B.S. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Tuite M.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4365-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The 74-D694 [psi–] [PIN+] strain was transformed with LEU2 multicopy vectors lacking or containing SUP35 and with the URA3 pUKC plasmids. Transformants were incubated overnight in liquid –Ura –Leu medium either containing or lacking adenine. When necessary, Sup+ cells grown in the latter medium were transferred to –Ura –Leu medium containing adenine and allowed to grow for about 20 generations. Most of Sup35 Overproduced in [psi–] [PIN+] Cells Is Found in Amyloid Form—To analyze the mechanism of SUP35 multicopy suppression, the strain 74-D694 [psi–][PIN+] was transformed with the multicopy plasmids YEp181-SUP35 or YEp181-SUP35NM-GFP expressing Sup35 or Sup35NM-GFP, respectively, and transformants were selected on –Leu medium. The transformants were red, indicating the absence of suppression of ade1–14 UGA mutation. Quantitative assay confirmed that nonsense codon readthrough in these cells was not increased (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, the analysis of Sup35 by electrophoresis in SDS-agarose gel (SDD-AGE (17Kryndushkin D.S. Alexandrov I.M. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Kushnirov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49636-49643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar)) revealed the presence of a significant proportion of polymerized Sup35 (Fig. 2) and Sup35NM-GFP (data not shown). These polymers should be of amyloid nature since insolubility in SDS at room temperature represents a characteristic property of Sup35 amyloids obtained in vitro (18Serio T.R. Cashikar A.G. Kowal A.S. Sawicki G.J. Moslehi J.J. Serpell L. Arnsdorf M.F. Lindquist S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) and Sup35 prion particles from yeast lysates (17Kryndushkin D.S. Alexandrov I.M. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Kushnirov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49636-49643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Analysis of Sup35 sedimentation and Sup35NM-GFP fluorescence (data not shown) also confirmed their aggregated state. Another characteristic property of amyloids and prions is the ability to seed polymerization of the same protein. Sup35NM-GFP aggregates from the transformants overproducing this protein could seed the aggregation of wild type Sup35 in vitro, although such aggregation proceeded considerably less efficiently than the aggregation seeded by the [PSI+] Sup35 aggregates (Fig. 2). The aggregation of Sup35 in vivo depended on the presence of [PIN+] determinant and was not observed in the [psi–] [pin–] cells. Furthermore, [PIN+] elimination via disruption of RNQ1 in the [psi–] [PIN+] cells possessing these aggregates caused the disappearance of the aggregates (Fig. 2). [PIN+] is known to be required for the de novo [PSI+] generation but not for its propagation (7Derkatch I.L. Bradley M.E. Zhou P. Chernoff Y.O. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 1997; 147: 507-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to [PSI+], maintenance of these aggregates depended on [PIN+], which suggests that they were inherited poorly at cell divisions but were constantly generated de novo.Fig. 2Overproduced Sup35 forms SDS-insoluble polymers able to seed Sup35 polymerizationin vitro. A, analysis of the Sup35 polymer state. Cell lysates of the strain 74-D694 were analyzed by SDD-AGE and immunostained for Sup35. Lane 1, [PSI–] cells; lane 2, [psi–] [PIN+] cells with empty vector YEplac181; lanes 3–5, transformants of the cells with following the genotypes bearing the multicopy plasmid YEplac181-SUP35: 3, [psi–] [PIN+]; 4, [psi–] [pin–]; 5, [psi–] [PIN+] with RNQ1 being disrupted after transformation. Molecular mass standards are as follows: titin (4200 kDa), nebulin (740 kDa), and myosin heavy chain (205 kDa). B, in vitro polymerization of Sup35 caused by Sup35NM-GFP seeds. Lysates of the 5V-H19 [psi–] [pin–] strain were mixed with lysates of 1–5V-H19 cells overproducing Sup35NM-GFP and having the indicated prion status (see “Materials and Methods”). The reactions were incubated for 2 h, fractionated by centrifugation, and analyzed by immunoblotting for Sup35. Centrifugation fractions are as follows: T, total mixed lysates; S, supernatant; P, pellet.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The levels of total and soluble Sup35 in the [psi–] [PIN+] strain overproducing this protein exceeded the total Sup35 levels in the non-transformed [psi–] strain 20- and 3-fold, respectively (data not shown). Thus, 15% (3/20) of Sup35 in transformant cells was soluble and 85% polymerized. A minimum of 85% cells is required to accommodate this amount of polymers, basing this on the assumption that these cells contain no Sup35 monomers, whereas others contain no polymers. However, the lack of suppressor phenotype suggests that all cells contained some amount of soluble Sup35 and, therefore, Sup35 polymers were present in more than 85% of cells, probably in almost all cells. The Sup35 Polymers Contain Rnq1—The dependence of the Sup35 polymerization on [PIN+] suggested, in agreement with the earlier data (8Derkatch I.L. Uptain S.M. Outeiro T.F. Krishnan R. Lindquist S.L. Liebman S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12934-12939Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), that the Sup35 polymerization is seeded by Rnq1 polymers. To confirm this idea, we tried to find Rnq1 in the Sup35 polymers. For this, the strain 1–5V-H19 [PIN+] (SUP35C) was transformed with multicopy plasmids encoding Sup35NM-GFP and Sup35NM-His6. Control transformant expressed only Sup35NM-GFP. The amyloid polymer fraction was isolated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Sup35NM-His6 polymers were affinity-purified from this fraction in the presence of SDS, an agent that dissolves nonspecific protein interactions but leaves intact amyloid polymers (17Kryndushkin D.S. Alexandrov I.M. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Kushnirov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49636-49643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Analysis of the obtained polymers showed the presence of Rnq1, although its proportion to Sup35 was ∼5-fold lower than in total cell extracts (Fig. 3). Since most of Sup35 was in polymer form, this means that about 20% of Rnq1 was incorporated into Sup35 polymers. Nonsense Suppression Caused by Sup35 Overproduction— Transformants of the 74-D694 [psi–][PIN+] strain overproducing Sup35 were able to grow on –Ade –Leu medium, which indicates suppression of the ade1–14 nonsense mutation. Overproduction of Sup35-NM-GFP caused even better suppression of ade1–14 (Fig. 4), presumably because this molecule is similar to Sup35 in its polymerization ability but non-functional in translation and was present in a large excess over Sup35. To analyze the appearance of Sup+ cells, cell suspensions of the transformants overproducing Sup35 grown on –Leu medium were spread to single colonies on either –Leu or –Ade –Leu plates. About 1% of colonies (7 out of 712 checked clones) growing on –Leu medium were light pink. They became red after growth in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride, indicating that these clones were [PSI+]. These [PSI+] represented novel variants since conventional [PSI+] are incompatible with Sup35 overproduction (19Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Genetics. 1991; 128: 513-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, they all depended on Sup35 overexpression and could not propagate at standard Sup35 levels. A relatively high proportion, ∼13% of cells, were able to produce colonies on medium lacking both adenine and leucine; equal aliquots of the cell suspension produced 340 colonies on –Leu plate and 44 on –Ade –Leu plate. The SUP35 plasmid was never lost from these clones under conditions selective for suppression but non-selective for the plasmid marker. This suggests that suppression required continuous Sup35 overproduction. The levels of soluble Sup35 were strongly decreased in the cells grown in –Ade –Leu medium (Fig. 4), which shows that the cause of suppression was the lack of soluble Sup35. In addition, the average size of Sup35 polymers in these cells was decreased in comparison with the cells incubated in medium lacking only leucine (Fig. 4). Such a decrease should lead to an increase in the number of polymer particles, faster polymerization, lower proportion of soluble Sup35 and, therefore, stronger suppression (17Kryndushkin D.S. Alexandrov I.M. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Kushnirov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49636-49643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Quantitative assay confirmed that the nonsense codon readthrough was increased upon selection for suppression and showed that it returned to almost original levels when only the plasmid marker was selected (Fig. 1). The disappearance of Sup+ cells proceeded gradually; spreading of the transformant cells, grown on –Ade –Leu medium, on medium lacking only leucine, produced stable red clones, and unstable light pink clones segregating red sectors (data not shown). It is important that the decrease of suppression efficiency in this medium correlated with an increase in the levels of soluble Sup35 and in the size of Sup35 SDS-insoluble polymers. This suggests that the suppressor phenotype observed upon incubation of transformant cells on –Ade –Leu medium was not due to enrichment by cells with unconventional [PSI+] (see above), which could be then spontaneously lost in the absence of selective pressure. Amyloid-like Aggregation of Sup35 with the N Domain Replaced for a Polyglutamine Sequence—The [psi–][PIN+] strain 74-D694/Q66 was obtained by the replacement of chromosomal SUP35 for the hybrid SUP35-Q66 allele encoding Sup35 with its N domain replaced for a stretch of 66 glutamine residues instead of its N domain (Q66-Sup35MC). This strain showed non-suppressor phenotype, but in contrast to wild type Sup35, a significant proportion of the hybrid Q66-Sup35MC protein formed SDS-insoluble polymers (Fig. 5). Despite this, extra copies of SUP35-Q66 did not cause nonsense suppression; such transformants had red color and did not grow on –Ade –Ura medium. As for Sup35, disruption of RNQ1 in these transformants caused the disappearance of SDS-insoluble polymers (Fig. 5). This is consistent with the observation that proteins containing expanded polyQ stretches aggregate upon overproduction in yeast in a [PIN+]-dependent manner (20Krobitsch S. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 21Meriin A.B. Zhang X. He X. Newnam G.P. Chernoff Y.O. Sherman M.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Suppressor phenotype was, however, observed for the transformants overproducing Q66-Sup35MC without 202 C-terminal amino acids (Q66-Sup35MCΔS), which is inactive in translation termination (Fig. 5). Overproduction of Q66-Sup35MCΔS caused aggregation of both plasmid-encoded Q66-Sup35MCΔS and its chromosomally encoded functional version with the intact C domain, decreasing the levels of soluble Q66-Sup35MC (Fig. 5) and thus stimulating nonsense codon readthrough. As for Sup35, the loss of plasmid expressing Q66-Sup35MCΔS caused the immediate disappearance of the suppressor phenotype, whereas the transfer of such transformants to a medium selective only for plasmid reduced the proportion of Sup+ cells gradually, mainly causing the appearance of pink/red sectored colonies (data not shown). The size of Q66-Sup35MCΔS polymers decreased in medium selective for suppression and increased almost to the original values after return to medium selective only for plasmid (Fig. 5). In contrast to Sup35, Q66-Sup35MCΔS was unable to generate prions. Spreading cells of the transformants overproducing Q66-Sup35MCΔS on medium selective only for plasmid maintenance did not produce colonies with the suppressor phenotype; no white or pink colonies appeared among about 30,000 of checked clones. We also failed to observe the appearance of clones with the suppressor phenotype upon transient overproduction of Q66-Sup35MCΔS. No such clones were observed among about 5000 of clones that have lost the Q66-Sup35MCΔS-encoding multicopy plasmid on 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing medium. Overproduction of the Sup35 protein in yeast may cause nonsense suppression, an effect that suggests a reduced function of this protein. Although it is known that Sup35 overproduction can induce the de novo generation of nonsense suppressor [PSI+] prion determinants (5Chernoff Y.O. Derkatch I.L. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), this does not explain the suppressor effect caused by excess Sup35 since [PSI+] prions appear with very low frequency and, in contrast to [PSI+], the SUP35 multicopy suppressor effect strictly depends on the presence of inducing multicopy plasmid (6Chernoff Y.O. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Derkach I.L. Ptyushkina M.V. Tarunina O.V. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Yeast. 1992; 8: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Here, we have found that Sup35 overproduced in [psi–] [PIN+] cells forms in the majority of those cells SDS-insoluble amyloid-like polymers similar to the [PSI+]-related Sup35 prion polymers. The presence of such polymers strictly depends on [PIN+], and they rapidly disappear when [PIN+] disappears due to disruption of RNQ1. This allowed us to conclude that these Sup35 polymers are poorly inherited but reappear with very high frequency in [PIN+] cells. Such dependence on [PIN+] suggests that Sup35 polymers may be seeded by Rnq1 polymers, and indeed, we found that about ½ of total Rnq1 was bound to Sup35 polymers. This bond was resistant to cold SDS, and thus, this Rnq1 belonged to the Sup35 polymers. It appears unlikely that Rnq1 was dispersed along the Sup35NM polymers since homotypic polymerization should be much more efficient than heterotypic. So most likely, this Rnq1 represented Rnq1 seeds attached to the Sup35NM polymers, which they initiated. Similar properties, low transmissibility and the high frequency of appearance, distinguish mammalian amyloids from prions. Thus, these Sup35 polymers may be considered as non-prion amyloids. The likely reason for the poor inheritance of the polymers was their large size, presumably due to low accessibility to the fragmenting activity mediated by the Hsp104 chaperone (22Kushnirov V.V. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It was proposed that larger polymers have a higher propensity to form higher order aggregates, which unproportionally decreases the number of heritable units (17Kryndushkin D.S. Alexandrov I.M. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Kushnirov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49636-49643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Another likely consequence of the large polymer size was low efficiency of Sup35 polymerization, which resulted in relatively high levels of monomer Sup35 and the lack of suppressor phenotype. Despite the lack of suppression, the presence of Sup35 polymers was a prerequisite for such a phenotype to appear upon selective pressure. Analysis of the population of [psi–] [PIN+] cells overproducing Sup35 revealed two cell categories capable of suppression. About 1% of these cells showed stable suppressor phenotype (pink color of colonies) on –Leu medium containing adenine, whereas 13% were able to form colonies on –Leu –Ade medium. The former group represented unconventional [PSI+] variants, which, in contrast to common [PSI+], were compatible with Sup35 overproduction. The latter group represented cells with an unstable suppressor phenotype, which acquired increased levels of nonsense codon readthrough under selection for suppression but returned gradually to the original levels under non-selective conditions. We propose that the suppressor phenotype may appear due to non-heritable variations in the efficiency of Sup35 polymerization and selection of cells with fastest Sup35 polymerization. A similar property, the ability to cause suppression under selective conditions, was observed for the overproduced polyglutamine fusion Q66-Sup35MCΔS. In this case, no stable [PSI+]-like containing clones appeared, and thus, the effect was solely due to the formation of non-prion amyloids of this protein. Thus, Sup35 overproduction in the [psi–][PIN+] cells caused appearance of a spectrum of its prion/amyloid variants, which differed greatly by their frequency of appearance and the polymerization rate. The most abundant of these variants, non-prion amyloids, are normally phenotypically silent, but the random non-heritable fluctuations of the polymerization process allow the selection of cells capable of nonsense suppression. It is also important that the results obtained show the absence of a sharp difference between the prion and non-prion amyloids. In fact, the gradual disappearance of suppressor phenotype of transformants overproducing Sup35 or Q66-Sup35MCΔ S after their transfer to medium non-selective for suppression shows that this phenotype can be inherited, albeit inefficiently. This makes such transformants similar to strains with weak and poorly heritable [PSI+] variants. Expansion of polyglutamine domains in some human proteins is known to cause several fatal neurodegenerative diseases, for example, Huntington's disease (for a review, see Refs. 23Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar and 24Martin J.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1970-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Earlier, a yeast model establishing a direct link between aggregation of expanded polyglutamine domain and its cytotoxicity was developed. Exploiting this model allowed Merrin et al. (21Meriin A.B. Zhang X. He X. Newnam G.P. Chernoff Y.O. Sherman M.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) to identify chaperones critical for the formation and expansion of aggregates (21Meriin A.B. Zhang X. He X. Newnam G.P. Chernoff Y.O. Sherman M.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and to reveal a defect of endocytosis as one of the reasons for their cytotoxicity (25Meriin A.B. Zhang X. Miliaras N.B. Kazantsev A. Chernoff Y.O. McCaffery J.M. Wendland B. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7554-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Nonsense suppressor phenotype developing upon overproduction of Sup35 demonstrates that this protein can be used as a convenient reporter for the detection of amyloids in the yeast cell. This provides an additional approach for the identification of the host factors involved in amyloid formation and suggests that yeast can be used for the study of mechanisms of both prion and amyloid diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2078797908,"A small noncoding bacterial ribonucleic acid of 62–64 nucleotides, RydC, was identified in the genomes of Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Shigella. In vivo, RydC binds to the RNA-binding protein Hfq, and it is unstable when Hfq is absent. Mobility assays reveal that complex formation between RydC and Hfq is specific, with an apparent binding constant of ∼300 nm. Sequence alignments combined with structural probing demonstrate that RydC folds as a pseudoknot. Hfq binds the loops crossing the deep and shallow grooves of the pseudoknotted RNA and reorganizes its overall conformation. An interaction with a polycistronic mRNA, yejABEF, which encodes a putative ABC transporter, was detected by affinity purification of immobilized RNA-Hfq complexes. In vivo, the yejABEF operon is expressed on minimal medium. Remarkably, its expression is reduced when RydC is absent, and the operon is degraded when RydC expression is stimulated. This observation correlates with the growth defects associated with a stimulation of its expression in vivo, generating a thermosensitive phenotype that affects growth on minimal media supplemented with glycerol, maltose, or ribose. We conclude that RydC regulates the yejABEF-encoded ABC permease at the mRNA level. This small RNA may contribute to optimal adaptation of some Enterobacteria to environmental conditions.

RNAs that generally do not encode proteins or function as transfer or ribosomal RNAs have been characterized in Escherichia coli. Because of their small sizes, they have been referred to as small (s) or noncoding (nc) RNAs. Initially, a dozen sRNAs were identified in E. coli on the basis of their high abundance or by serendipity. In the last few years, computational, microarray and cloning-based screens have led to the identification of around 50 additional sRNAs in E. coli (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Masse E. Majdalani N. Gottesman S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar and 2Hershberg R. Altuvia S. Margalit H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1813-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These RNAs act mainly by pairing with other RNAs, are part of RNA-protein complexes, or adopt the structures of other nucleic acids (3Storz G. Opdyke J.A. Zhang A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar).Bacterial sRNAs base pairing with target mRNAs can have various regulatory fates: sRNAs can repress or activate translation by blocking or promoting ribosome binding to mRNAs (3Storz G. Opdyke J.A. Zhang A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). They can also destabilize or stabilize mRNAs by increasing or decreasing accessibility to RNases. Base pairing between some sRNAs and their RNA targets requires the participation of the Hfq protein, a homolog of the Sm and Sm-like eukaryotic proteins involved in mRNA splicing. Hfq binds AU-rich sequences and forms a homohexameric ring (4Schumacher M.A. Pearson R.F. Moller T. Valentin-Hansen P. Brennan R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3546-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Hfq acts as an RNA chaperone to promote base pairing interactions between Hfq-binding sRNAs and their targets. It can protect many sRNAs and also mRNAs against RNase E digestion (5Moll I. Afonyushkin T. Vytvytska O. Kaberdin V.R. Blasi U. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1308-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which Hfq facilitates interactions between sRNAs and their targets are, however, poorly understood.In this report, the functional and structural identification of a novel sRNA that folds as a pseudoknot and binds Hfq in vitro and in vivo is described. The RNA was detected in the enterobacteriaceae family, in 21 sequenced strains from the three genera Escherichia, Salmonella, and Shigella. Its existence was independently detected by microarrays of Hfq-immunoprecipitated E. coli RNAs and Northern analysis (6Zhang A. Wassarman K.M. Rosenow C. Tjaden B.C. Storz G. Gottesman S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), and it was termed RydC. We have identified by affinity chromatography an mRNA target of RydC that specifies a predicted ABC transport system. In vivo, RydC regulates the expression of the ABC permease at the mRNA level. When the expression of RydC is stimulated in vivo, the mRNA encoding the transporter gets degraded, and growth defects are observed on minimal medium with glycerol, maltose, or ribose as the carbon sources.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESrydC Gene Disruption and Overexpression—The chromosomal rydC gene was deleted by targeted gene substitution using a combination of two described protocols. The cat gene flanked by FLP recognition target from pKD3 was amplified by PCR using P1 (5′-CTACGCATGATGCCGCGTAAACGTTCCTGAAAGGATATTTAGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-3′) and P2 (5′-GATTAAAAATAAGCCAGATGGACGTATGGGCAAGGATTATGCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAGT-3′), as described previously (7Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10970) Google Scholar). Strain KY330 was transformed with the PCR product as described previously (8Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination between the PCR product and the chromosome leads to chloramphenicol-resistant clones in which the chromosomal rydC gene is replaced by the pKD3-encoded cat gene, as confirmed by PCR using P3 (5′-CGGAATTCCGGCATCGGCATAAAAGG-3′) and P4 (5′-CGGGATCCTCTGGAAGGACAA CACAC-3′), and the construct was then introduced into MG1655Z1 (9Bohn C. Collier J. Bouloc P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) by P1 vir-mediated transduction, resulting in strain PhB3089. To overexpress RydC, the rydC gene was PCR-amplified using P5 (5′-CGGAATTCCGGCATCGGCATAAAAGG-3′) and P6 (5′-CGGGATCCTCTGGAAGGACAACACAC-3′). The resulting fragment was digested by BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into BamHI-EcoRI restricted pUC18, resulting in strain PhB3203. Constructions were verified on an ABI310 automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).RNA Isolation and Northern Blots—E. coli strains were grown in either Luria-Bertani (LB) or minimal media (M9) and harvested at the indicated A600. The cell pellets were resuspended in Trizol (Invitrogen). Total RNA extraction was performed as suggested by the manufacturer. Total RNAs were isolated either by Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) or by acid-phenol extraction, in which the cell pellet was dissolved in 0.2 m sodium acetate, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS (pH 5.0), with a volume of water-saturated phenol pre-heated at 65 °C. Incubation was performed for 10 min at 65 °C and 0.5 volume of CHCl3:isoamylic alcohol (24:1). The sample was incubated for 10 additional minutes at 65 °C. Total RNAs were precipitated overnight at 4 °C with 2 m LiCl (final concentration), washed with 80% ethanol, and incubated with an RNase-free DNase followed by phenol extraction. For RydC and transfer-messenger RNA, Northern blots were carried out by loading 30 μg of freshly extracted RNAs per lane onto an 8% PAGE in 1× Tris-borate EDTA for 3 h at 350 V. For yejABEF mRNA, we used a 1% agarose gel in 2.2 m formaldehyde, in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 8 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). For the blots performed on polyacrylamide gels, the transfer of the RNAs was achieved in 0.5× Tris-borate EDTA onto charged nylon membranes (Zeta probe GT; Bio-Rad) for 3 h at 20 V at 4 °C. For the blots performed on agarose gels, the transfer of the RNAs was achieved in 20× SSC onto neutral nylon membranes overnight at room temperature (passive transfer). Either 100–1000- or 200–10000-nt-long RNA markers (Novagen) were used. To monitor yejABEF expression in vivo in a wild-type strain, ΔRydC, and pUC-RydC strains, primer P7 (5′-GTATCGATACCGAGGCTATAGATGGGGC-3′) was used for hybridization. To monitor RydC expression in vivo in a wild-type strain, ΔRydC, and pUC-RydC strains, primer P8 (5′-ACCGACCCGTGGTACAGGCG-3′) was used for hybridization.Primer Extension and RACE—Total RNAs (15 μg) were annealed to 5′-labeled primer P8 at 90 °C for 30 s and 65 °C for 5 min, cooled down on ice, and subjected to primer extension at 42 °C for 30 min with 5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Qbiogene) and 0.5 mm deoxynucleotide triphosphates in a volume of 5 μl. The cDNA products were separated on a 6% PAGE. RACE assays were carried out according to Ref. 10Argaman L. Hershberg R. Vogel J. Bejerano G. Wagner E.G. Margalit H. Altuvia S. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 941-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, with modifications: for the 5′-RACE, 10 μg of total RNAs, with and without a treatment with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase, was denatured in presence of 300 pmol of RNA adapter R1 (5′-UGGCGGACGCGGGUUCAACUCCCGCCAGCUCCACCA-3′) (Dharmacon) at 95 °C for 3 min and cooled down on ice. Ligation was performed at 16 °C overnight with 10 units of T4 RNA ligase (New England Biolabs) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 150 μm ATP, and 10% Me2SO. After phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, 2.5 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed with 2 pmol of gene-specific complementary DNAs P8 or P9 (5′-GTACAGGCGAAGAATACGGG-3′) with 20 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Qbiogene) at 42 °C for 30 min in a final volume of 20 μl. 1 μl of the reaction was used for PCR amplification by 15 pmol of primer P8 or P9 and adapter-specific homologous primer P10 (5′-AACTCCCGCCAGCTCCACCA-3′), 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) in 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 m of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate. Products were separated on a 10% PAGE, eluted, and cloned into PCR2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Recombinant bacteria were selected by PCR, and the positive ones were sequenced by M13 reverse and universal DNA primers. For the 3′-RACE, calf intestinal phosphatase-treated total RNA was ligated to 5′-phosphorylated R1. Reverse transcription was performed with 200 pmol of primer P11 (5′-AGTTGAACCCGCGTCCGCCA-3′) complementary to R1. PCR amplification was performed with gene-specific DNA P12 (5′-GATGTAGACCCGTATTCTTCG-3′), as described for the 5′-RACE.In Vitro Transcription and RNA Labeling—RydC and yejAB were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA. Forward primers contain a T7 promoter sequence and a BamHI site. For RydC, the forward primer was P13 (5′-CGGGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTTCCGATGTAGACCCGTAT-3′) and the reverse primer was P14 (5′-AAGAAAACGCCTGTACTAAAAC-3′). For yejAB, the forward primer was P15 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCCCATCTATAGCCTCGGTATCG-3′) and the reverse primer was P16 (5′-ATCACCAGCAACAGACGGCG-3′). Transcription mixtures contained PCR-generated DNA templates (0.02 μm), 0.5 mm of the four ribodeoxynucleotides (ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP), 2.5 units/μl T7 RNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in 80 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 20 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm spermidine, and 12 mm MgCl2. The incubation was for 1 h at 37 °C, and then 5 units of DNase I was added for 15 min, followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Labeled transcriptions of yejAB were performed the same way, except that the final concentration of cold UTP was reduced to 0.01 mm and [α-32P]UTP was added (800 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). Labeled and unlabeled RNAs were purified on a 10% PAGE. RydC was radiolabeled at either its 5′-end using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) or its 3′-end using [α-32P]pCp and T4 RNA ligase (New England Biolabs) and purified on a 10% PAGE.Gel-shift Assays—Hfq was overproduced from strain BL21(DE3) transformed with pTE607 plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. Hajnsdorf, Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique, Paris, France). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were grown in 3 liters of LB medium at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.4, induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, and centrifuged for 20 min at 5000 × g (4 °C). The bacterial pellets were dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and sonicated on ice (6 rounds of 10 s each with 10-s pauses), followed by treatment with DNase I (100 units/ml, 15 min, 37 °C) and a 20-min centrifugation (10,000 × g at 4 °C). The supernatant was filtered (0.45 μ), loaded onto a FPLC (Amersham Biosciences) equipped with a Ni2+ column washed with 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole; equilibrated at pH 6.0; and eluted in a similar buffer, except for the concentration of imidazole (300 mm). The protein was pure, as shown on a 12% SDS-PAGE (the monomeric and multimeric forms of Hfq were visible, even after boiling the sample in SDS buffer), heated for 15 min at 80 °C, and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g at room temperature, and the supernatant was concentrated on 5kD Amicon in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NH4Cl, 5% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay, and the protein was stored at 4 °C.The transcripts were denatured in 50 mm Hepes (pH 6.9), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2 for 3 min at 85 °C, followed by refolding for 10 min at 30 °C and chilled on ice. 0.02 to 1 pmol of labeled RNA was incubated with a 1000–1500 molar excess of carrier yeast tRNAs, 0.2 μg/μl bovin serum albumin, and the indicated amounts of purified Hfq. The binding reactions were in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min at 30 °C. The samples were supplemented with 10% glycerol (final concentration) and loaded on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 5% glycerol. The electrophoresis was performed in 0.5× Tris-borate EDTA supplemented with 0.5% glycerol at 4 °C for 4 h (100 V). The results were analyzed and quantified either on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) or directly by autoradiography.Isolation of RNAs That Bind to a RydC-Hfq Complex—Total RNAs were extracted at A600 = 0.4. Both the 16S and the 23S rRNAs were removed (Single Place Magnetic Stand; Ambion). RNAs (10 μg) depleted in both 16S and 23S rRNAs, corresponding to roughly 30 μg of total RNAs, were 3′-end-labeled (as described for RydC, see above) and purified from the unincorporated [α-32P]pCp using MicroSpin™ G-25 columns. A complex between 1.5 pmol of refolded cold RydC and 37.5 pmol (a 25-fold molar excess) of His-tagged Hfq was formed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 15 min (at that ratio, all RydC was bound to Hfq). 3′-labeled bacterial RNAs were added to the RydC-Hfq complex, incubated for an additional 15 min at 37 °C, and loaded on a 0.5 ml TALON® metal affinity column (Clontech) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The elution was performed in three steps. In each, 400 μl of 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 6.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 300 mm imidazole was added to the column (first at 37 °C for 30 min, and then at 37 °C for 60 min) and, finally, 400 μl of 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 6.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 300 mm imidazole was added to the column, and the resin was treated with an equal volume of phenol (pH 4.5). The three fractions were collected, treated with phenol/chloroform, and ethanol-precipitated. The eluted RNAs were cloned as described for the 3′-RACE. The terminal 5′-P of the eluted RNAs was removed by the calf intestinal phosphatase. The eluted RNAs are 3′-end-labeled with [α-32P]pCp, thus a 5′-OH R1 can be ligated at their 3′-ends, and cDNAs were generated by primer extension with P11. R1 phosphorylated at its 5′-end was then ligated at the 3′-ends of the cDNAs, PCR-amplified, and loaded onto a 10% PAGE. The PCR fragments were eluted individually, re-amplified by PCR, cloned, and sequenced.Structural Analyses—End-labeled and gel-purified RydC were folded in 50 mm Hepes (pH 6.9), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2 for 3 min at 85 °C and then folded for 10 min at 30 °C and chilled on ice. For secondary structure analysis, the RNAs were partially digested at 30 °C for 10 min with 10–4 or 5.10–5 unit of RNase V1 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm KCl with 2.5 μg of yeast tRNAs. Limited digestions with 0.2 and 1 unit of nuclease S1 were performed at 30 °C for 10 min in 25 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm ZnCl2 with 2.5 μg of yeast tRNAs. Partial alkaline hydrolysis was performed in 0.1 m NaOH and 2 mm EDTA at 90 °C for 50 s. RNase T1 sequencing was performed in 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 7 m urea at 55 °C for 6 min in the presence of 10 μg of yeast tRNAs with 2 units of RNase T1 (final volume, 5 μl). The samples were directly loaded on a 12% PAGE. Probing the structure of either 5′- or 3′-end-labeled RydC in complex with Hfq was performed after refolding the RNA as described above. Then, RydC was bound to a 50-fold molar excess of Hfq. The complex was partially digested at 30 °C for 7 min with either 10–4 or 5.10–5 unit of RNase V1 or 0.5 unit to 5 units of nuclease S1 supplemented with 1 mm ZnCl2. There was either a 400- or a 1200-fold molar excess of yeast tRNA when probing the conformation of RydC in complex with Hfq.RESULTSIdentification, Expression, and End Mapping of a Novel sRNA—Based on sequence conservations between phylogenetically related species, a computer approach was developed (11Pichon C. Felden B. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1707-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to identify novel sRNAs expressed from the intergenic regions of the E. coli genome. All those previously characterized (1Masse E. Majdalani N. Gottesman S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) were identified, plus new ones. Among them, –10 and –35 promoter sequence signals flanked at their 3′-sides by a 50–60-nt-long “GC-rich” region ending by a putative “Rho-independent” terminator could be predicted (Fig. 1A). We selected one of these putative sRNA-encoding genes that was identified in 21 sequenced bacterial genomes, all from the family of the enterobacteriaceae (6 E. coli, 11 Salmonella, and 4 Shigella sequences), for additional studies. A sequence alignment of those that possess sufficient sequence variations is presented in Fig. 1A. While our work was in progress, the presented putative E. coli sRNA was isolated by co-immunoprecipitation with Hfq, identified using microarray and Northern blot analysis, and named RydC (6Zhang A. Wassarman K.M. Rosenow C. Tjaden B.C. Storz G. Gottesman S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), the name by which we will refer to it. The RydC-encoding gene, rydC, is located at 32 min on the E. coli genetic map between cybB and ydcA encoding cytochrome b561 and a hypothetical protein of 5.9 kDa, respectively, both located on the complementary DNA strand (Fig. 1B).Based on the alignment of seven sequences with high nucleotide identity, RydC is proposed to fold as a pseudoknot, as confirmed experimentally using structural probes (see below). Two RNA helices H1 (7 bp) and H2 (9 bp) are predicted. H2 is part of a Rho-independent terminator. Divergent rydC sequences possess three compensatory mutations to maintain the pairings within RNA helix H2. Predicted helices H1 and H2 are entangled and connected by three nt stretches L1, L2, and L3. Based on the known genes, L1 has 6–7 “pyrimidine-rich” nt, L2 has a single conserved Cys residue, and L3 has 7–8 nt.Primer extension analysis on total cellular RNA demonstrates that the predicted promoter is functional in vivo (Fig. 1C). Determination of the 5′ and 3′ boundaries of RydC was required for subsequent functional and structural analyses. They were determined using 5′- and 3′-RACE (Fig. 1D). From several DNA clones, RydC 5′-end mapped at two adjacent positions (Fig. 1A, boxed 5′-CT) 5 or 6 nucleotides downstream from the “–10 box” of the predicted promoter. RydC 3′-end also mapped at two adjacent positions (Fig. 1A, boxed 3′-TT or TG), downstream from the 3′-strand of H2 ending by a T4C stretch that forms a Rho-independent terminator. As determined from the major 5′- and 3′-end points, RydC has 62–64 nucleotides in vivo, consistent with the size estimated from our computer prediction.RydC Forms a Complex with Hfq—Because RydC interacts with Hfq in vivo (6Zhang A. Wassarman K.M. Rosenow C. Tjaden B.C. Storz G. Gottesman S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that its quantity could be Hfq-dependent. RydC expression was compared by Northern blots between a strain deficient for Hfq (Δhfq) and its parental strain. In contrast to the parental strain, RydC could not be detected in the derivative that does not express Hfq (Fig. 2A). It suggests that in the absence of Hfq, RydC is unstable and rapidly degraded by RNases. Stability of sRNAs can be reduced in the absence of Hfq that protects them against RNase activity, including RNase E (1Masse E. Majdalani N. Gottesman S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 5Moll I. Afonyushkin T. Vytvytska O. Kaberdin V.R. Blasi U. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1308-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Hfq might be required for the transcription of RydC. The binding of Hfq to RydC was tested in vitro by gel-shift assays using increasing amounts of purified Hfq and constant amounts of labeled synthetic RydC. Binding assays were performed at various salt conditions, constant pH (pH 7.5–8.0), and a large excess of bulk tRNA from yeast to reduce aspecific binding (from a 30 to a 1500 molar excess relative to RydC). The apparent binding constant between RydC and Hfq varies from 120 to 500 nm, depending on the amount of carrier tRNA (the lowest association constant corresponds to the lowest molar excess of competitor RNA). Retardation assays with increasing amounts of purified Hfq indicate that the RNA-protein complex is detected in vitro at physiological pH and salt concentrations (Fig. 2B shows a typical assay). The binding between RydC and Hfq is specific because a 4000-fold molar excess of total tRNA displaces only a minor fraction of RydC from a preformed RydC-Hfq complex, whereas a 50-fold excess of cold RydC competed labeled RydC out of the complex (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Stabilization of RydC by Hfq in vivo and assessment of the affinity and specificity of the interaction. A, detection of RydC expression by Northern hybridization using a labeled strand-specific probe during bacterial growth in LB medium in cells that do not express Hfq because of chromosomal gene disruption (Hfq Δ) compared with a control strain (Hfq wt). B, native gel retardation assay of purified labeled RydC with increasing amounts of purified His-tagged Hfq. C, the interaction between Hfq and RydC is specific.

Therefore, its conformation was analyzed further by structural probes in solution, an approach that was instrumental in establishing the secondary structures for many RNAs (12Brunel C. Romby P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 318: 3-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A RydC transcript was end-labeled, and its solution conformation was probed by enzymes. RNase V1 cleaves double-stranded RNA or stacked nucleotides, whereas nuclease S1 cleaves single-stranded RNA. The reactivity toward these probes was monitored for each nucleotide of a 64-nt-long synthetic RNA, in the absence and presence of the protein Hfq. Four independent experiments were performed on RydC alone, and four additional ones were performed on the Hfq-RydC complex (Fig. 3, A–C, is representative). These data are summarized on secondary structure models that they, together with the phylogenetic analysis, support (Fig. 3, D and E).Fig. 3Monitoring the solution conformation of RydC (A and D) and the RydC-Hfq complex (B, C, and E) by structural probes. A–C, autoradiograms of 12% PAGE separation of 5′ (A and C)- or 3′ (B)-labeled RydC fragments generated by single (nuclease S1)- or double (RNase V1)-strand-specific digestions in the absence (A) or presence (B and C, +) of Hfq. The secondary structural elements of the RNA are indicated. RNase T1 hydrolysis ladders (lanes GL) indicate the position of each guanosine residue within the RNA sequence (left). Hydrolysis ladders (lanes L) indicate the position of each residue along the RNA sequence. D, experimentally supported secondary structure of RydC. H1 and H2 are the helices; L1 and L3 are the loops crossing the major and minor grooves of the RNA structure, respectively; and L2 connects H2 to H1. Arrowheads show the V1 cleavages, stars show the S1 cuts. Black symbols represent strong cleavage, gray symbols represent moderate cleavage, and white symbols represent weak cleavage. E, enzymatic footprints of RydC in the presence of Hfq. There is a 50:1 molar ratio of the protein to the RNA, with a 1200 molar excess of carrier tRNA. Nucleotides whose reactivity is unaffected upon protein binding are represented by gray circles. Nucleotides with modified reactivity in the presence of Hfq are in capital letters. Symbols are as defined in D. Enzymatic cleavages that are reduced (–) or enhanced (+) upon protein binding are indicated. Upon Hfq binding, five alternate pairings between nt located within the two black boxes are proposed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Double-stranded-specific cuts from C15 to U18 and at the predicted G12-C41 pair and the absence of nuclease S1 cleavages at G12-U18 and A35-C41 suggest that helix H1 forms in solution (Figs. 1A and 3D). RNase V1 cuts at U29-U31, G54, and G57 and the absence of S1 cleavages between C25-C33 and G49-G57 support the existence of a 9-bp helix H2 (Figs. 1A and 3D). S1 cleavages at A19-U23 and U44-U47 are consistent with loops L1 and L3 being mostly single-stranded in solution. According to the sequences, the nt content of loop L1 varies from six to seven, and that of L3 varies from seven to eight. L1 and L3 cross the deep and shallow grooves of the RNA structure that folds as a pseudoknot (13Draper D.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 145-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A conserved unpaired Cys residue is in between helices H1 and H2 that forms L2. L2 is not cut by S1, probably because it is not accessible for cleavage. The strong S1 cleavages between U58 and U63 suggest that the “uridine-rich” 3′-end of RydC is unpaired. Nucleotides C5 and G6 are cleaved by both single-stranded- and double-stranded-specific probes, suggesting that the 5′-end of RydC breathes in solution, as for other bacterial RNAs (14Felden B. Himeno H. Muto A. McCutcheon J.P. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 89-104PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the nt segment 4CCGAU8 can pair transiently with 39GUCGG43 (Fig. 3D, boxed nt), accounting for the V1 cuts at nt C5 and G6, forming an extended helix interrupted by an internal bulge at nt G9-C14. There are no detectable degradation sites within the sequence of RydC.The interaction between RydC and Hfq was also monitored by structural probes (Fig. 3, B, C, and E). In the presence of Hfq, nuclease S1 cleavages disappear at U21-U24 in loop L1 and at U44-U47 in loop L3. These regions are accessible “uridine-rich”“sequences. Because Hfq binds “uridine-rich” sequences close to structured domains in target RNAs (15Zhang A. Wassarman K.M. Ortega J. Steven"
https://openalex.org/W1992265573,"CHK2/hCds1 plays important roles in the DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoint by phosphorylating several important targets, such as Cdc25 and p53. To obtain a better understanding of the CHK2 signaling pathway, we have carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for potential CHK2-interacting proteins. Here, we report the identification of the mitotic checkpoint kinase, TTK/hMps1, as a novel CHK2-interacting protein. TTK/hMps1 directly phosphorylates CHK2 on Thr-68 in vitro. Expression of a TTK kinase-dead mutant, TTKD647A, interferes with the G2/M arrest induced by either ionizing radiation or UV light. Interestingly, induction of CHK2 Thr-68 phosphorylation and of several downstream events, such as cyclin B1 accumulation and Cdc2 Tyr-15 phosphorylation, is also affected. Furthermore, ablation of TTK expression using small interfering RNA results not only in reduced CHK2 Thr-68 phosphorylation, but also in impaired growth arrest. Our results are consistent with a model in which TTK functions upstream from CHK2 in response to DNA damage and suggest possible cross-talk between the spindle assembly checkpoint and the DNA damage checkpoint.

Our results are consistent with a model in which TTK functions upstream from CHK2 in response to DNA damage and suggest possible cross-talk between the spindle assembly checkpoint and the DNA damage checkpoint. To ensure that critical events of cell division, such as DNA replication and chromosome segregation, are faithfully and precisely executed, eukaryotic cells employ checkpoints to control the order and timing of cell cycle progression (1Bartek J. Falck J. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 2Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). DNA damage or other environmentally induced genotoxic stress triggers surveillance pathways, leading to checkpoint activation. The DNA damage checkpoints enable cells to delay cell cycle progression or, alternatively, to undergo apoptosis (3Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Defects in checkpoint genes allow cells to grow and divide out of control, which often leads to increased sensitivity to damaging agents, as well as genome instability, and predisposition to cancer (4Dasika G.K.

Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2316) Google Scholar). Accordingly, knowledge of the DNA damage response pathways and participating proteins is extremely important for understanding tumorigenesis and for the development of effective therapy for cancer. CHK2/hCds1, an evolutionary conserved protein kinase, was identified by several groups as a mammalian homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad53 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cds1 (6Blasina A. de Weyer I.V.

Zhou Z. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2401-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 12Murakami H. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 374: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Likewise, the mammalian CHK2 responds to various types of DNA damage and interference with DNA replication (1Bartek J. Falck J. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 13McGowan C.H. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because of its predominantly nuclear localization, CHK2 is thought to act as an effector protein in DNA damage checkpoint pathways. Through its functional links with other proteins, the signals resulting from DNA lesions can be transduced instantly and amplified rapidly to effect diverse cellular responses, including growth arrest, DNA repair, and programmed cell death, by a cascade of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. On exposure to genotoxic stress, CHK2 becomes fully activated through a chain of reactions, including the initial wave of phosphorylation carried out by ATM or ATR kinases at sites within the SQ/TQ cluster domain (SCD), 1The abbreviations used are: SCD, SQ/TQ cluster domain; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Gy, grays; HA, hemagglutinin; IR, ionizing radiation; KD, kinase-dead; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Plk, Polo-like kinase; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; siRNA, small interfering RNA; WCEs, whole cell extracts; WT, wild-type; ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated; ATR, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated and Rad-3 related. preferentially at Thr-68 (14Ahn J.Y.

The kinases, ATM and ATR, which are members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family, are two major upstream controllers of CHK2 (22Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 23Kastan M.B. Lim D.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 24Shiloh Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). ATM is specifically activated by ionizing radiation (IR) and other sources of DNA double strand breaks such as those generated spontaneously during DNA replication or by radiomimic drugs, whereas ATR is suggested to function in parallel with ATM in responding to stalled replication forks resulting from hydroxyurea treatment or UV light-induced DNA damage. As a result, after DNA damage, CHK2 is phosphorylated and thus activated in either an ATM-dependent or ATR-dependent manner, depending on the type of damage. When DNA damage occurs, activated CHK2 targets several cell cycle modulators, such as p53, Brca1, and two Cdk-activating phosphatases, Cdc25A and Cdc25C. These events ultimately lead to cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or programmed cell death. Activated CHK2 phosphorylates Cdc25A on Ser-123, leading to ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of Cdc25A. This results in immediate G1/S cell cycle blockade and stalled S phase progression (25Falck J. Mailand N. Syljua ̊sen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CHK2 is involved in maintaining G2/M arrest by phosphorylating the mitosis-promoting Cdc25C phosphatase on Ser-216. The phosphorylation enhances the association of Cdc25C with 14-3-3, resulting in Cdc25C inactivation (9Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J.

CHK2 also phosphorylates p53 at several sites, including Ser-20 in its transactivation domain, thus contributing to its stabilization and enhancement of its transcriptional activity toward its downstream target genes (30Chehab N.H.

Recently, CHK2 was also shown to regulate apoptosis through a p53-independent pathway by phosphorylating the promyelocytic leukemia protein (37Yang S. Kuo C. Bisi J.E. Kim M.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Moreover, CHK2 phosphorylates Brca1, which is involved in DNA double strand break repair, further implicating CHK2 in DNA repair (38Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In addition to its functions in the regulation of tumor suppressors, CHK2 itself seems to be a tumor suppressor. Mutations in CHK2 occur in Li-Fraumeni families with wild-type p53 (39Bell D.W. Varley J.M. Szydlo T.E. Kang D.H. Wahrer D.C. Shannon K.E. Lubratovich M. Verselis S.J. Isselbacher K.J. Fraumeni J.F.

Moreover, CHK2 mutation carriers have an increased risk of breast cancer (40Meijers-Heijboer H. van den Ouweland A. Klijn J. Wasielewski M. de Snoo A. Oldenburg R. Hollestelle A. Houben M.

To summarize, CHK2 is a checkpoint protein kinase that coordinates cell cycle responses and plays important roles in maintaining genomic stability. TTK/hMps1 was cloned and identified as a dual specificity protein kinase that phosphorylates tyrosine or serine/threonine residues (41Lindberg R.A. Fischer W.H. Hunter T.

Preliminary studies have shown that expression of TTK is detectable in all actively proliferating human cells and tissues, and thus it seems to be associated with cell proliferation (42Mills G.B.

In this study, using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified TTK as a novel CHK2-interacting protein and demonstrated that it binds directly to CHK2, both in vitro and in vivo. We also established a Tet-Off (Clontech) cell line that expressed kinase-dead (KD) TTK (D647A) under the control of tetracycline to investigate the roles of TTK in cell cycle checkpoints. We found that expression of TTK-KD impaired G2/M arrest and CHK2 Thr-68 phosphorylation induced by DNA damage. Similarly, disruption of TTK expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) also caused a reduction in CHK2 Thr-68 phosphorylation. Finally, we present evidence that TTK exerts its effects possibly by directly phosphorylating CHK2 Thr-68. Together, our data support a model in which TTK functions upstream from CHK2 in response to DNA damage and participates in DNA damage checkpoints through its effects on CHK2. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—For the yeast two-hybrid screen, the N-terminal domain of CHK2 (residues 1–223) was amplified by PCR and cloned into pDBTrp (Invitrogen) between the SalI and StuI sites. This was used as bait to screen a human testis cDNA library cloned in the pACT2 vector (Clontech). The yeast strains and assay conditions were those used in the ProQuest™ two-yeast system (Invitrogen). Cell Culture Conditions and Treatments—HeLa, MCF7, and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Hyclone Laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). HeLa 10-3 and HeLa 6 cells stably transfected, respectively, with the tetracycline-regulated empty pTRE vector or pTRE expressing the TTK-KD (D647A) mutant were generated using the two-step Tet-Off gene expression system. These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 300 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma), and 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma). To induce TTK (D647A) expression, cells were plated in the above medium lacking G418, puromycin, and tetracycline. LNCaP cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Hyclone Laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For IR treatment, cells were exposed to 8 Gy, or in the case of U2OS cells, 4 Gy, x-rays using the Torrex 150D inspection system (EG&G), then incubated for the indicated period. For UV irradiation, PBS-washed cells were irradiated in uncovered tissue culture dishes with 254-nm light in a UV cross-linker (Spectronics). The culture medium was then added back and the cells incubated for the indicated period. Plasmids—The pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) modified by insertion of sequences encoding a HA tag was used to generate the expression construct for full-length TTK (1–857). pcDNA3-HA-TTK (D647A) was made from the pcDNA-HA-TTK vector by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. For Tet-Off expression, a 3.0-kb TTK fragment including 500 bp of the 3′-untranslated region was cloned into the EcoRI site of the pTRE vector (Clontech). For mammalian expression of CHK2, the cDNA was cloned into the BamHI and KpnI sites of the pXJ-myc vector (a kind gift from V. Yu, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore) and expressed as a myc-tagged protein. For expression in Escherichia coli, cDNAs coding for full-length TTK and truncation mutants were cloned into pGEX4T vectors (Amersham Biosciences) for expression as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. Full-length CHK2 or its truncation mutants were expressed from pRSET vectors (Invitrogen) as His-tagged fusion proteins. Recombinant Proteins—GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain DH5α. After induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the bacteria were lysed by sonication in sonication buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 20% glycerol) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mg/ml lysozyme, then the lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and the bound proteins eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione. Recombinant His-tagged proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) LysE and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The His fusion proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 2.5 μg/ml E64, and dialyzed for 30 min against BC0 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol) containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal anti-TTK antibody was raised against recombinant His-tagged TTK-N (residues 1–386) by LTK Biolaboratories (Taiwan). When used in Western analysis, the antibody detected only one protein with size corresponding to the calculated molecular weight of TTK. It also detected the exogenously expressed HA-TTK (D647A) in HeLa 6 cells (see Fig. 3A). As a comparison, the commercial anti-TTK antibody from Santa Cruz (sc-540) gave the same results. Antibodies against CHK2 (sc-9064), p-CHK2 (Thr-68) (sc-16297-R), Cdc2 (sc-54), and cyclin B1 (sc-245) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phospho-CHK2 (Thr-68) antibody (2661), phospho-CHK2 (Ser-19) antibody (2666), and anti-Cdc2-phosphotyrosine 15 antibody (9111) were from Cell Signaling Technology. Monoclonal antibodies against CHK2 (K0087) and MAD2 (K0167) were purchased from MBL (Japan). Anti-HA antibody (16B12) was from Covance. Anti-actin antibody (A2066) was purchased from Sigma. Bound primary antibodies were detected using either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) and chemiluminescent reagents (Pierce). Mammalian Cell Lysis and Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared by resuspending cells in TEGN lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 420 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mm PMSF, a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 nm microcystin LR, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. WCEs were boiled for 5 min in protein sample buffer (0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 0.17 m Tris, pH 6.8, 0.17 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol), and a portion (20–30 μg of protein) was analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The resolved proteins were wet transferred to PROTRAN nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), then the blots were blocked for 30 min at room temperature in 1% milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibody followed by appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. After washing, the blots were treated with chemiluminescent reagents (Pierce) and exposed to BioMax films (Kodak). Protein-Protein Interaction Assays—For the GST pull-down assay, bacterial lysates containing GST fusion proteins were prepared by sonication as described above, then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. After two washes with sonication buffer and one wash with coimmunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.15% Nonidet P-40), the beads were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in coimmunoprecipitation buffer with 35S-labeled in vitro translated CHK2. After washes with coimmunoprecipitation buffer, bound CHK2 were eluted using 10 mm reduced glutathione and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, 293T cells were plated on 60-mm dishes and transiently transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in TEGN buffer containing 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitors, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 nm microcystin LR, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The WCEs were mixed with an equal volume of TEG buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol), 15 μl of 50% protein G beads (Pierce), and antibodies. The mixtures were rocked for 2–3 h at 4 °C, then washed three times with 1:1 TEG/TEGN buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. siRNA Transfection—Transfection of the siRNA was performed as described previously (55Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) and siRNA at a final concentration of 0.15–0.2 μm. Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/60-mm dish (HeLa 10-3) or 1 × 105 cells/35-mm dish (U2OS) 1 day before transfection. The sequences targeted by TK1, CHK2, and MAD2 siRNA are 5′-tgaacaaagtgagagacat-3′, 5′-aatgtgtgaatgacaactact-3′, and 5′-aatacggactcaccttgcttg-3′, respectively. Flow Cytometry—For FACS analysis, both attached and floating cells were harvested, resuspended in cold PBS, fixed by adding 10 volumes of cold (–20 °C) methanol, and stored at –20 °C for at least 1 h. Cells were rehydrated with cold PBS and stained for 30 min at 37 °C with 60 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) in PBS containing 50 μg/ml RNase A. The DNA content was analyzed using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). In Vitro Kinase Assay and Immunoprecipitation/Kinase Assay—For the in vitro kinase assay, purified recombinant full-length wild-type (WT) or KD GST-TTK fusion proteins were incubated with purified His-CHK (D347A) for 15 min at 30 °C in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors, 10 mm NaF, 5 nm microcystin LR, and 50 μm ATP. The reaction was stopped by the addition of a 0.5 volume of 3× protein sample buffer and the proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by detection with anti-CHK2-phosphothreonine 68 rabbit polyclonal antibody (2661, Cell Signaling Technology). For immunoprecipitation/kinase assays, TTK was first immunoprecipitated from LNCaP or MCF7 cell lysates with anti-TTK (sc-540), washed twice in 1:1 TEG/TEGN buffer, once in 1:1 TEG/TEGN buffer containing 0.7 m LiCl, and twice in kinase buffer. Kinase assay was then performed as described above using His-CHK2-D347A as substrate. TTK Interacts with CHK2 Both in Vitro and in Vivo—To delineate the CHK2-mediated signaling pathways, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen using the CHK2 N-terminal domain (1–243) as bait to isolate novel CHK2-interacting proteins. By screening a human testis cDNA library, we obtained several positive clones. One of the clones, d2, encoded 470 amino acid residues encompassing the C-terminal portion (amino acids 387–857) of TTK (42Mills G.B. Schmandt R. McGill M. Amendola A. Hill M. Jacobs K. May C.

Human Mps1, like its yeast counterpart, plays an essential role in the spindle assembly checkpoint (45Stucke V.M. Sillje ́ H.H.W. Arnaud L. Nigg E.A.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) To determine whether TTK interacted directly with CHK2, an in vitro GST pull-down assay was performed using 35S-labeled in vitro translated CHK2 and bacterially produced GST fusion constructs of TTK (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, the originally cloned d2 (387–857) construct and the d2C (521–857) construct, but not GST, brought down CHK2 in vitro. The KD mutant d2 (D647A) also bound to CHK2, demonstrating that the kinase activity of TTK was not essential for the interaction in vitro. The interaction, although specific, was not strong. It is possible that bacteria-expressed recombinant d2 protein lacks additional modification or was not properly folded for optimal interaction"

This translocase consists of the two phylogenetically related membrane-embedded subunits Tim17 and Tim23 to which four largely hydrophilic subunits, Tim50, Tim44, Tim16, and Tim14, are attached. Whereas in vitro reconstitution experiments have suggested a pore-forming capacity of recombinant Tim23, virtually nothing is known about the properties and function of Tim17. We employed a combined genetic and biochemical approach to address the function of Tim17 in preprotein translocation. Tim17 exposes an N-terminal hydrophilic stretch into the intermembrane space. Truncation of the first 11 amino acid residues of this stretch did not affect the stability or integrity of TIM23 subunits but strongly impaired the import of preproteins. Moreover, expression of the truncated Tim17 variant led to a dominant negative effect on the mitochondrial membrane potential. By an alanine-scanning approach we identified two conserved negative charges in the N terminus of Tim17 as critical for Tim17 function. The replacement of these positions by positively charged residues results in a strong growth defect, which can be cured by reverting two conserved positive charges into aspartate residues between transmembrane domains two and three of Tim17. On the basis of these observations we propose that charged residues in Tim17 are critical for the preprotein-induced gating of the TIM23 translocase.

Following their synthesis on cytosolic ribosomes as preproteins they are recognized and specifically imported into mitochondria (for review see Refs. 3Wiedemann N. Frazier A.E. Pfanner N. J. Biol.

These form amphiphilic helices with one positively charged and one hydrophobic face (7von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Presequences are recognized by receptors on the surface of mitochondria, which are part of a multisubunit translocation machinery, the TOM complex (translocase of the outer membrane). Sequential interactions of the presequences with binding sites on both sides of the outer membrane then guide the preproteins to and across the protein-conducting channel of the TOM complex (8Komiya T.

In the intermembrane space, preproteins with presequences are recognized by the translocase of the inner membrane, the TIM23 1The abbreviations used are: TIM, translocase of the inner membrane; DiSC3(5), 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide; DSG, disuccinimidyl glutarate; wt, wild-type; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase. complex. The TIM23 complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae consists of six subunits, all of which are essential for viability: Tim50, Tim44, Tim23, Tim17, Tim16/Pam16, and Tim14/Pam18. Tim50 contains one N-terminal transmembrane span and exposes a large C-terminal receptor domain into the intermembrane space (10Geissler A. Chacinska A. Truscott K.N. Wiedemann N. Brandner K.

This domain interacts with incoming polypeptide chains and passes them on to the membrane-embedded subunits Tim23 and Tim17. Tim17 and Tim23 are phylogenetically related and contain a conserved core segment of four transmembrane domains. Tim23, in contrast to Tim17, exposes an N-terminal hydrophilic domain of about 100 amino acid residues into the intermembrane space that appears to cooperate with Tim50 in the recognition of preproteins (10Geissler A.

Recombinant refolded Tim23 protein when reconstituted into lipid bilayers was reported to form channels that are triggered by presequence binding (14Lohret T.A. Jensen R.E. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Truscott K.N. Kovermann P. Geissler A. Merlin A. Meijer M. Driessen A.J. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Wagner R. Nat. Struct.

Based on these findings it was proposed that Tim23 forms the core subunit of the translocase representing the minimal functional unit for complete translocation of preproteins across the inner membrane into the matrix. Little is known on the function of the Tim17 subunit and it was speculated that Tim17 may form a second, Tim23-independent channel that mediates membrane integration of inner membrane proteins by a stop-transfer mechanism (16Pfanner N. Chacinska A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Translocation of the presequence across the TIM23 complex depends on the membrane potential which may exert an electrophoretic force on the positively charged presequences and thereby initiate the transport of preproteins across the inner membrane. In addition, the membrane potential may play a role in the mechanism by which the peptide-conducting channel is opened. In the matrix, the presequence is bound by the mitochondrial Hsp70 chaperone. Hsp70 is recruited to the import sites via Tim44, a matrix protein that is associated with Tim17 and Tim23. Preprotein binding by Hsp70 is controlled by the J domain proteins Tim14 and Tim16, both stable subunits of the TIM23 complex, and the soluble nucleotide exchange factor Mge1 (17Kozany C.

In an ATP-dependent reaction, Hsp70 mediates the vectorial translocation of the preprotein into the matrix and finally assists in the folding of the polypeptide into its native, three-dimensional structure (5Neupert W. Brunner M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In this study we have analyzed structure-function relationships of Tim17. We show that the N-terminal intermembrane space segment of Tim17 contains a strictly conserved motif harboring two negatively charged residues, which are crucial for the function of the TIM23 translocase. Truncation of this signature severely affected the import of preproteins into mitochondria, regardless of whether they are destined for the matrix or the inner membrane. Our data suggest that Tim17, together with Tim23, plays both a general and critical role for the translocation of preproteins across the inner membrane of mitochondria.

The complete TIM17 open reading frame was obtained by amplification of genomic yeast DNA using the primers SM28 (5′-GGGCTGCAGATGTCAGCCGATCATTCGAGAG-3′) and SM29 (5′-GGGGGATCCCTAAGCTTGCAGAGGTTGAGAG-3′). To obtain the TIM17ΔN sequences, which contain codons 12–158 of the TIM17 gene, the primers SM30 (5′-GGGCTGCAGATGATAGTAATACTAAATGATTTC-3′) and SM29 were used. Primers SM28 and SM31 (5′-GGGGGATCCCTATCTTTGAAACATTAGTCCCAC-3′) were used to amplify the sequence for TIM17ΔC, which encoded residues 1–134 of Tim17. The resulting sequences were digested with PstI and BamHI and subcloned into the URA3-containing pVT100U expression vector (22Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). For site-specific mutagenesis, the TIM17 gene was amplified by PCR using the primers SM42 (5′-GGGGTCGACCCACTGTCAGTGGCG-3′) and SM43 (5′-GGGTCTAGAGAGAGAAATGGTTGG-3′). The resulting sequence was digested with SalI and XbaI and subcloned into pRS315 (23Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific alanine replacement mutations in the TIM17 sequence were introduced via PCR primers using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For expression of the Cox5aΔTM protein, the sequences corresponding to amino acid residues 1–98 and 119–153 of Cox5a were amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame into the EcoRI and BamH1 site of pGEM4 (Promega, Madison, WI). The Cox5aΔTM-DHFR expression construct was derived from this plasmid by insertion of the mouse DHFR sequence between the BamHI and HindIII sites. Strains and Growth Conditions—S. cerevisiae strains were isogenic to the wild-type strain BY4743 (24Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). A heterozygote TIM17 deletion strain (GenBank™ accession no. Y21282, Euroscarf, Frankfurt, Germany) was used for generation of tim17 mutants. This strain was transformed with URA3-containing pVT100U vectors expressing full-length or truncated versions of Tim17. Homozygote deletions carrying the plasmids were selected following sporulation and tetrad analysis. The strain expressing the full-length Tim17 protein is referred to as Tim17FL, and the strains expressing the N- or C-terminal deletion mutants as Tim17ΔN and Tim17ΔC, respectively. For expression of Tim17ΔN in addition to the endogenous Tim17, the pVT100U Tim17ΔN vector was transformed into BY4743. For generation of alanine replacement mutants, pRS315 plasmids containing the LEU2 and tim17 genes were transformed into the Tim17ΔN mutant. The resulting strains were grown in the presence of uracil to allow for the loss of the pVT100U plasmids, and ura3 autotrophic cells were selected by growth on 5-fluoroorotic acid (25Boeke J.D. LaCroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were cultivated at 30 °C on lactate medium or on selective medium supplemented with 2% KOH-buffered lactate (26Herrmann J.M. Fo ̈lsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 538-544Google Scholar). In Vitro Protein Import and Mitochondrial Subfractionation—Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (26Herrmann J.M. Fo ̈lsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 538-544Google Scholar). Import of in vitro synthesized proteins into isolated mitochondria was performed according to published procedures (27Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Standard import reactions were carried out in the presence of 2 mm NADH, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase. Mitochondria were converted to mitoplasts by 10-fold dilution in ice-cold 20 mm Hepes pH 7.4. Protease treatment was performed by addition of 50 μg/ml proteinase K to the reaction and incubation for 30 min at 0 °C. The efficiency of swelling and proteinase K treatment was monitored by Western blotting using Dld1, OxaI, and Mge1 as marker proteins representing the intermembrane space, the inner membrane, and the matrix, respectively. Chemical Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation—For cross-linking, the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) domain in precursor proteins was stabilized by incubation of the reticulocyte lysate with 0.1 mm methotrexate and 1 mm NADPH for 10 min at 25 °C. Then the lysate was added to isolated mitochondria that were resuspended in import buffer lacking bovine serum albumin with 2 mm ATP, 2 mm NADH, 2 mm methotrexate, and 5 mm NADPH. After incubation for 5 min at 25 °C, 200 μm disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) was added to the mitochondria, and the reaction was incubated for 30 min on ice. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of 100 mm glycine, pH 8.0. Mitochondria were reisolated, washed, and lysed in 1% SDS, 300 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. After a clarifying spin for 30 min at 47,000 × g the extract was diluted 20-fold in 0.2% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.5 and used for immunoprecipitation according to published procedures (28Herrmann J.M. Westermann B. Neupert W. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 217-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extract was added to 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and 4–6 μl of rabbit antisera or 20 μl of affinity-purified antibody. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed twice in Triton buffer and once in phosphate-buffered saline. Precipitated proteins were dissolved in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiographed. To purify the TIM23 complex of the different mutants, 150 μg of mitochondria were lysed in 50 μl of 1% digitonin, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and diluted 20-fold in 0.1% digitonin, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After a clarifying spin for 30 min at 47,000 × g, the extract was added to 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose and 20 μl of purified Tim23 antibody. Gel Filtration Analysis—To determine the size of the TIM23 complex in wild-type and mutant mitochondria, mitochondria (400 μg) were lysed in 1% digitonin, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and loaded on a Superose 6 (HR10/30) column (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins in the fractions were precipitated by addition of 12% trichloroacetic acid, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting. The signals of Tim17 were quantified by densitometry. Determination of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—The membrane potential of isolated mitochondria was measured in 0.6 m sorbitol containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free), 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm potassium phosphate pH 7.2 at 25 °C as described (29Ga ̈rtner F.

Biol. 2002; 3: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) was added to a final concentration of 0.7 μm. After 0.5–1 min (time point 1) mitochondria were added to a final protein concentration of 10 μg/ml. After 2–5 min of incubation, 1 mm KCN and 10 μm valinomycin were added to dissipate the membrane potential (time point 2). The increase of the fluorescent signal corresponds to the relative membrane potential level of the mitochondria. Tim17 Sequences Contain a Conserved N-terminal Motif— Tim17 is a highly conserved protein. Alignments of plant, fungal, and animal homologues show a very high number of identical or chemically similar amino acid residues (Fig. 1A). Between the Tim17 orthologues of human, S. cerevisiae, and Arabidopsis, 44% of the residues are identical. Conserved residues are mainly positioned within the hydrophobic transmembrane spans, but are also present in the hydrophilic loops exposed to the intermembrane space and the matrix (Fig. 1B). Whereas the C-terminal intermembrane space tail of Tim17 is highly variable, the N terminus shows a number of residues that are conserved between plants, fungi, and animals. In contrast, the Tim17 paralogue Tim23 shows a lower degree of conservation and residues identical among Tim23 orthologues are restricted to the hydrophobic core domains of the protein (Fig. 1B). Truncation of the N terminus of Tim17 Strongly Affects Growth—Tim17 differs from Tim22 and Tim23 mainly in the regions flanking the hydrophobic core domain. To assess the functional relevance of these tail domains we constructed yeast mutants expressing Tim17 variants in which these tails were truncated (Fig. 2A). To obtain these mutants, one TIM17 allele was deleted in a diploid strain. This strain was transformed with URA3 plasmids expressing the full-length or truncated versions of Tim17 lacking the C-terminal 24 (Tim17ΔC) or the N-terminal 11 amino acid residues (Tim17ΔN). After sporulation of the cells, haploid mutants were selected that exclusively expressed the plasmid-encoded variants of Tim17. Deletion of the C-terminal intermembrane space domain of Tim17 did not affect growth on fermentable and only mildly on non-fermentable carbon sources. Therefore, this non-conserved region appears not to be crucial for Tim17 function (Fig. 2B). In contrast, truncation of the N terminus of Tim17 resulted in a severe growth defect both on fermentable and non-fermentable carbon sources (Fig. 2B, last row). From this we conclude that the N-terminal 11 residues of Tim17 are critical for function of the protein. The Tim17ΔN Mutant Shows a Normal Composition of the TIM23 Complex—We tested whether the truncation of the N-terminal domain of Tim17 affects the integrity of the TIM23 complex. We first assessed the levels of the subunits of the TIM23 complex by Western blotting of mitochondria isolated from wild-type and the Tim17ΔN mutant (Fig. 3A). This revealed comparable levels of the six subunits of the TIM23 translocase as well as of mitochondrial Hsp70. The levels of the truncated Tim17 protein were somewhat higher than the levels of the endogenous Tim17 because of the plasmid-based expression of the protein. Thus, the truncation of the N terminus of Tim17 does not result in the depletion of the mutant Tim17 protein or of other constituents of the TIM23 machinery. Are the subunits of the TIM23 complex properly assembled in the Tim17ΔC mutant? To assess the integrity of the TIM23 complex, mitochondria were lysed with digitonin, and proteins associated with Tim23 were isolated by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3B). In wild-type and Tim17ΔN mitochondria, Tim17 was efficiently recovered together with Tim23, as well as the other TIM23 components Tim50, Tim44, Tim16, and Tim14. Furthermore, upon size exclusion chromatography a comparable fractionation behavior of wild-type and mutant Tim17 was observed (Fig. 3C). No monomeric, unassembled Tim17ΔN protein was detected in the mutant. These results strongly suggest that the truncation of the N-terminal intermembrane space domain of Tim17 does not affect the integrity of the TIM23 complex. Truncation of the N terminus of Tim17 Severely Diminishes Mitochondrial Import of Preproteins—Does the truncation of the N terminus of Tim17 affect the import rates of preproteins destined to the different subcompartments of mitochondria? To answer this question, we first tested whether accumulated precursor forms of mitochondrial proteins can be detected in extracts of Tim17ΔN cells (Fig. 4A). In wild-type cells, Hsp60 was exclusively found in its mature form. In contrast, a large fraction of Hsp60 was present as precursor form in the Tim17ΔN mutant. A similar accumulation of Hsp60 precursor was observed in cells depleted of Tim17 (Fig. 4A, Tim17↓). This suggests that the truncation of the N terminus of Tim17 leads to an import defect of mitochondrial precursor proteins in vivo. To assess the import of mitochondrial proteins in more detail, radiolabeled preproteins were synthesized in reticulocyte lysate and incubated with mitochondria isolated from wild-type or Tim17ΔN cells. The kinetics of protein import were assessed by taking aliquots after various times of incubation (Fig. 4B). The import rates of preproteins destined for the mitochondrial matrix, like Su9-(1–69)-DHFR or F1β (Fig. 4B, Su9 and F1β) were greatly diminished in the Tim17ΔN mitochondria. Similarly, the import rates of inner membrane proteins like the subunit 5a of the cytochrome oxidase (Fig. 4B, Cox5a) were reduced. This protein contains one transmembrane span, which arrests translocation of the preprotein in the TIM23 channel and leads to integration into the inner membrane. Deletion of the transmembrane domain of Cox5a causes missorting into the matrix (31Glaser S.M. Miller B.R. Cumsky M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1873-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This matrix-targeted variant still required the N-terminal Tim17 domain for efficient import (Fig. 4B, Cox5aΔTM). Import of cytochrome b2, an intermembrane space protein that is imported in a presequence- and TIM23-dependent manner, was likewise affected in Tim17ΔN mitochondria. The mitochondrial ATP/ADP carrier (AAC), which is integrated into the inner membrane by the TIM22 translocase was used as a control; import of this TIM23-independent protein was not affected in Tim17ΔN mitochondria. In summary, the truncation of the N terminus of Tim17 causes a rather general import defect of presequence-containing precursor proteins, regardless of whether they are targeted to the matrix, the inner membrane or the intermembrane space. Expression of the Truncated Tim17 Protein Leads to a Partial Dissipation of the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—The membrane potential across the inner membrane is essential for the import of preproteins into mitochondria and reduced membrane potential levels are known to lead to diminished import rates of proteins (32Martin J. Mahlke K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18051-18057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether a diminished membrane potential might explain the strong import defects observed in Tim17ΔN mutants, we measured the membrane potential levels in wild-type and mutant mitochondria (Fig. 5A). The fluorescent dye, DiSC3 (5Neupert W. Brunner M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), was added to isolated mitochondria (Fig. 5A, time point 1); this dye is partially taken up by the organelles leading to a decrease of the fluorescent signal. Valinomycin was then added to the sample to deplete the membrane potential (Fig. 5A, time point 2). Because of the depletion of the membrane potential by valinomycin the dye is released into the medium. The ensuing increase of fluorescent signal directly corresponds to the level of membrane potential. Comparable membrane potential levels were observed in mitochondria of wild-type cells and the mutant complemented with full-length Tim17. In contrast, the Tim17ΔN mitochondria showed a strongly reduced membrane potential, which could either be the cause or the consequence of impaired import rates in the mutant. The TIM23 complex has the ability to form ion-conducting channels in the inner membrane (14Lohret T.A. Jensen R.E. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Truscott K.N. Kovermann P. Geissler A. Merlin A. Meijer M. Driessen A.J. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Wagner R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1074-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The observed reduced membrane potential could indicate an uncontrolled leakage of ions across the inner membrane due to the truncation of Tim17. In this case, expression of the truncated Tim17 protein in a wild-type background should also cause a partial dissipation of the membrane potential. Therefore, we tested whether expression of Tim17ΔN in wild-type mitochondria exhibits a dominant effect on the level of membrane potential. As shown in Fig. 5B, indeed a significantly reduced level of membrane potential was observed in mitochondria containing both wild-type and truncated Tim17. We conclude that truncation of the N terminus of Tim17 leads to a strong reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential even in the presence of wild-type Tim17 protein. The Import Defect of Tim17ΔN Mitochondria Is Not Caused by a Diminished Membrane Potential Level—To measure protein import rates in Tim17ΔN mitochondria independent of their endogenous energetic conditions, we established an artificial membrane potential across the inner membrane (33Pfanner N. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the presence of valinomycin membranes become permeable to potassium ions. The selective diffusion of potassium ions can be used to generate comparable levels of membrane potential in wild-type and Tim17ΔN mitochondria (Fig. 6A). This artificial membrane potential can efficiently drive the import reaction in wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 6B, open circles). However, the import rates of preproteins were still significantly reduced in mitochondria of the Tim17ΔN mutants (Fig. 6B, filled circles). Thus, the diminished import efficiencies observed in the mutant are not indirectly caused by the reduced membrane potential. Passage of Preproteins through the TIM23 Complex Is Strongly Impaired in Tim17ΔN Mitochondria—Which stage of the import reaction of preproteins is affected in Tim17ΔN mitochondria? The Tim17ΔN mitochondria showed significantly reduced levels of imported preproteins. As a consequence, import experiments with isolated mitochondria showed strongly diminished amounts of preproteins that were matured by the matrix protease MPP (Fig. 7A). In these experiments, no protease-resistant precursor protein was observed indicating that preproteins remained at least partially outside of the outer membrane of the mitochondria. To address the location of the accumulated import intermediates more carefully, we employed a cross-linking approach. We constructed a fusion protein consisting of the matrix-destined preprotein Cox5aΔTM and mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). We chose the Cox5aΔTM protein because of its extremely fast import kinetics at 25 °C which allows the import of enough preprotein into Tim17ΔN mitochondria to detect potential contacts of the preprotein by cross-linking. The DHFR domain of this protein was tightly folded by addition of the folate analogue methotrexate and incubated with mitochondria expressing either full-length Tim17 (Tim17FL) or Tim17ΔN. The tight folding of the DHFR domain prevents complete import and t"

This enzyme has been the subject of intense biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies. The protein complex contains three subunits with characteristic redox prosthetic groups: NarG (140 kDa), the catalytic subunit with a molybdo-bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide) cofactor and an [Fe-S] cluster (FS0); NarH (58 kDa), the electron transfer subunit with four [Fe-S] clusters (FS1, FS2, FS3, and FS4); NarI (26 kDa), the integral membrane subunit with two b-type hemes, termed bP and bD to indicate their proximal (bP) and distal (bD) positions to the catalytic site. NarG and NarH form a soluble cytoplasmically localized catalytic domain anchored to the membrane by NarI. NarGHI catalyzes electron transfer from a quinol binding site located in NarI through the redox cofactors aligned as an “electric wire” through the complex (bD → bP → FS4 → FS3 → FS2 → FS1 → FS0) to the molybdo-bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor in NarG, where nitrate is reduced to nitrite. NarGHI often forms a respiratory chain with the formate dehydrogenase FdnGHI via the lipid soluble quinol pool. Electron transfer from formate to nitrate is coupled to proton translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane generating proton motive force by a redox loop mechanism (3Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). In the redox loop mechanism proton translocation is the net result of the topographically segregated reduction of quinone and oxidation of quinol on opposite sites of the membrane. The high resolution structures of both respiratory complexes, FdnGHI and NarGHI, have been recently solved (1Bertero M.G. Rather R.A. Palak M. Hou C. Lim D. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. Strynadka N.C. Nat.

Growth of Cells—E. coli LCB79/pVA700 was grown overnight in 5 liter batches with a 1% inoculum in a B. Braun Biostat B fermenter at 30 °C in the presence of 100 μg ml–1 ampicillin and 100 μg ml–1 streptomycin. The growth medium contained 12 g liter–1 Tryptone, 24 g liter–1 yeast extract, 5 g liter–1 NaCl, and 4 ml liter –1 glycerol. NarGHI overexpression was induced at A600 = 2.0, after which the cultures were grown for 10–11 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in a buffer containing 100 mm MOPS and 5 mm EDTA, and frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent storage at –70 °C. Isolation of Membrane Fractions and Purified Preparations—Crude membrane vesicles were prepared from E. coli cells by French pressure cell lysis and differential centrifugation (12Rather R.A.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12747-12757Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All membrane preparation steps were carried out in a buffer containing 100 mm MOPS and 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.0). Excess sucrose was removed by resuspension and recentrifugation in this buffer. Purified NarGHI was prepared by anion exchange chromatography on a DEAE-FF column (Amersham Biosciences) as described by Bertero et al. (1Bertero M.G. Rather R.A. Palak M. Hou C. Lim D. Blasco F.

J. 1998; 332: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Optical data were recorded using a Hewlett Packard (Agilent) HP8453 spectrophotometer. Nitrate-dependent oxidation of PBH2 was followed by the appearance of absorption maxima at 419 nm using an extinction coefficient of 3.95 mm–1 cm–1 (15Rather R.A. Chatterjee I. Kiema G. McDermott M.T. Weiner J.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Enzyme assays were carried out in a degassed buffer containing 100 mm MOPS/KOH, 4 mm KNO3, and 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.0). A concentration range of 0.140–1.4 mm PBH2 was used to determine kinetic parameters, and reactions were initiated by the addition of protein (either enriched membranes or purified protein). The competitive inhibitor constant for PCP (Kic) was estimated from plots of Km/kcatversus PCP concentration, and the uncompetitive inhibitor constant (Kiu) was estimated from plots of 1/kcatversus PCP concentration (16Engel P.C. Enzymology Labfax. Bios Scientific Publishing, San Diego, CA1996: 100-109Google Scholar). EPR Spectroscopy—EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Elexsys E500 spectrometer equipped with an ESR-900 flowing helium cryostat. EPR conditions were as described in the legend to Fig. 4. FQ Titrations with 2-n-Heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HOQNO) and Estimation of NarGHI Content in Membrane Samples—The affinity of NarGHI for HOQNO was determined by performing FQ titrations using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B luminescence spectrometer (6Rather R.A.

Fluorescence intensities were measured using an excitation wavelength of 341 nm and an emission wavelength of 479 nm. All experiments were carried out at room temperature and pH 7.0 in 100 mm MOPS/KOH and 5 mm EDTA. HOQNO was added to the fluorescence cuvette from a 0.25 mm stock ethanolic solution. A range of protein concentrations was used as indicated in the individual figure legends. The observed fluorescence (Fobs) was fitted to an equation describing ligand binding to a single site as described by Okun et al. (18Okun J.G. Lummen P. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2625-2630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Enzyme concentration was deemed to be equivalent to the estimated concentration of HOQNO binding sites. In the case of the NarI-K86A mutant enzyme, which is not amenable to concentration determination by FQ titration, enzyme content was estimated by comparing the fluorescence intensities of an extract containing the form A derivative of the molybdo-bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor with those of a wild-type preparation of known NarGHI content (19Rather R.A.

Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination of the NarGHI-PCP Complex—Highly ordered crystals of three single point mutants of NarGHI, C26A in NarH and K86A and H66Y in NarI, were obtained in conditions similar to those reported earlier for the native enzyme (1Bertero M.G. Rather R.A. Palak M. Hou C. Lim D. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). NarGHI-C26A crystals were soaked in 50 μl of cryoprotectant solution (35% polyethylene glycol 3000, 350 mm sodium acetate, 200 mm KCl, 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 5 mm EDTA, and 0.7 mm Thesit (Fluka)) in the presence of 0.5 mm PCP. This mutant retains the activity of the native enzyme (11Guigliarelli B. Magalon A. Asso M. Bertrand P. Frixon C. Giordano G. Blasco F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4828-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and allowed us to obtain crystals yielding higher resolution data than that obtained with crystals of the native enzyme after soaking with PCP. Single datasets for each mutant were collected at 100 K at the Advanced Light Source (beamlines 8.2.1 and 8.2.2). Crystals were isomorphous with the native crystals. Data were integrated and scaled with the HKL suite of programs (22Otwinowski Z.M. Wladek M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structures were determined using difference Fourier techniques followed by rigid body refinement of the 1.9-Å resolution native model (1Bertero M.G. Rather R.A. Palak M. Hou C. Lim D. Blasco F.

Open table in a new tab PCP Is a Potent Inhibitor of NarGHI—NarGHI is able to use both menaquinol and ubiquinol (UQH2) as physiological electron donors (Figs. 1, a and b) (27Wallace B.J. Young I.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 461: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 28Brondijk T.H. Fiegen D. Richardson D.J. Cole J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Studies of quinol binding to NarGHI have been expedited by the use of the menaquinone analog HOQNO (Fig. 1d), which has been demonstrated to inhibit enzyme activity by binding to a single site in close proximity to heme bD within NarI (6Rather R.A. Blasco F. Magalon A. Asso M. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12747-12757Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Magalon A. Rather R.A. Lemesle-Meunier D. Frixon C. Weiner J.H. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10851-10856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have so far been unable to produce crystals of the NarGHI-HOQNO complex, so we pursued the characterization of other potential inhibitors of the enzyme. PCP (Fig. 1c) has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of both succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase (29Maklashina E. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have characterized the effects of this inhibitor on the activity of the native NarGHI and NarGHI bearing a specific mutation of a highly conserved residue in NarI (NarI-K86A). The NarI-K86A mutant has a lower plumbagin:nitrate oxidoreductase activity than the wild-type enzyme, 10 s–1 compared with 68 s–1, respectively. The decreased activity of the mutant enzyme suggests that the NarI Lys-86 residue is probably located in the vicinity of a functional Q-site within the NarGHI complex. Fig. 2 shows the effect of HOQNO and PCP on the plumbagin:nitrate (PBH2:NO–3) oxidoreductase activity of the native enzyme and of the NarI-K86A mutant. HOQNO inhibits NarGHI with an I50 of ∼1.5 μm but has little inhibitory effect on the NarI-K86A mutant (Fig. 2A). PCP is a significantly more potent inhibitor than HOQNO, with an I50 of ∼0.4 μm. The NarI-K86A mutant also attenuates the inhibitory effect of PCP but not to the same extent as is observed with HOQNO, with the I50 increasing to ∼2.5 μm (Fig. 2B). To gain a more detailed understanding of the inhibitory effect of PCP, we subjected the wild-type enzyme to steady-state kinetic analyses in the presence of PCP. PBH2 is oxidized by NarGHI with an estimated Km of 147 ± 17 μm. Interestingly, PCP exhibits mixed inhibition with a competitive inhibitor binding constant (Kic) of 57 ± 14 nm and an uncompetitive inhibitor binding constant of 490 ± 9 nm. The relative magnitudes of these constants suggest that the inhibition elicited by PCP is mixed, but primarily competitive in nature. To determine whether the PCP binding site is equivalent to the HOQNO binding site identified by biophysical means, we performed fluorescence (FQ) titrations which exploit the fluorescent properties of the latter inhibitor. HOQNO binds to the wild-type enzyme with an affinity of ∼250 nm, but it does not bind with high affinity to the NarI-K86A mutant (Fig. 3A). This result is in agreement with the inhibition data presented in Fig. 2A. Furthermore, competition between HOQNO and PCP occurs at an equivalent site within the NarGHI complex (Fig. 3B). The addition of 5 μm PCP to the fluorescence cuvette before performing a FQ titration with HOQNO essentially eliminates detectable HOQNO binding. A fluorescence increase is observed when the enzyme is incubated in the presence of 2.7 μm HOQNO and titrated with PCP (Fig. 3B), consistent with PCP being able to displace HOQNO from its binding site. Overall, the FQ data demonstrate the presence of a common binding site for PCP and HOQNO within the NarGHI complex. To further rationalize the PCP inhibitory effect, we recorded EPR spectra of the hemes of oxidized NarGHI and NarI-K86A mutant (Fig. 4). As previously reported (6Rather R.A. Blasco F. Magalon A. Asso M. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12747-12757Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Magalon A. Rather R.A. Lemesle-Meunier D. Frixon C. Weiner J.H. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10851-10856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), HOQNO elicits a shift in the gz of heme bD from 3.36 to 3.50 (Fig. 4, A and B). PCP produces a similar shift on bD from 3.36 to 3.45 (Fig. 4, A and C). Neither inhibitor alters the gz feature of the heme bP spectrum. The NarI-K86A mutation has no significant effect on the gz of heme bD (Fig. 4D). HOQNO and PCP elicit shifts in the heme bD gz of the NarI-K86A mutant from 3.36 to 3.39 and from 3.36 to 3.48, respectively (Fig. 4, E and F). As for the wild-type enzyme, no PCP or HOQNO effects are observed on heme bP gz. Overall, these results are consistent with the kinetic and FQ data (Figs. 2 and 3). To explain the inhibitory effects of PCP and the behavior of the NarI-K86A mutant, we have determined the crystal structure of the wild-type and mutant enzymes in the presence and absence of inhibitor. The Structural Environment of the PCP Binding Site—The NarI subunit (225 aa) consists of five tilted transmembrane helices numbered sequentially from I to V, with the N and C terminus located toward the periplasmic and the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, respectively (Fig. 5a). The four helices II to IV are arranged in a bundle which accommodates the two hemes, bP and bD. Each heme is coordinated by two conserved histidine residues, His-56 and His-205 for bP and His-66 and His-187 for bD. Helices IV and V are connected by two extra helices, IV′ and IV″, which are in a hairpin-like arrangement and located on the periplasmic side. The C terminus of NarI extends into the cytoplasmic domain of the enzyme, establishing extensive interactions with both NarG and NarH. The structure of NarI reveals two hydrophobic clefts (Fig. 5b), an elongated cavity (A) located between helices I, II, and IV′ that exposes the edges of both hemes to the membrane and a smaller pocket (B) that is delimited by helices II, III, and IV′ and leads to heme bD. Both clefts, with the exclusion of bulk solvent, represent plausible locations for Q-sites. To structurally characterize the PCP binding site, NarGHI crystals were soaked in the presence of this inhibitor, and the structure of the NarGHI-PCP complex was determined to 2.0 Å of resolution (Table I, Fig. 5). The Cα backbone of the NarI subunit from the NarGHI-PCP complex superposes with NarI of the native enzyme with a root main square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of only 0.14 Å for 217 C-α atoms (as determined with Protein Structure Comparison Service SSM at the European Bioinformatics Institute (30Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar)). The initial Fo – Fc difference electron density map, calculated before inclusion of the inhibitor molecule into the model, clearly reveals the presence of one PCP molecule intimately bound to NarI. Refinement statistics indicate the PCP is likely bound with full occupancy to NarI, and temperature factor analysis supports the strong binding of the inhibitor with average thermal parameters of the PCP very similar to that of the surrounding NarI residues (38 and 33 Å2, respectively). The PCP binding pocket (pocket B in Fig. 5b) is located between transmembrane helices II and III, in close proximity to heme bD toward the periplasmic side of the membrane (Fig. 5a). The PCP aromatic ring binds in a cavity formed by primarily nonpolar residues; three glycine residues (Gly-65, Gly-69, and Gly-94) and Met-70 from helix II, Met-89 and Ala-90 from helix III, and Met-156 and Val-160 from a short helix connecting helices IV and V (Fig. 6a). The majority of these residues (Gly-65, Gly-69, Ala-90, and Gly-94) are highly conserved in the NarI proteins from different bacterial species (31Rather R.A. Blasco F. Magalon A. Weiner J.H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 273-283PubMed Google Scholar). Although the nature of the pocket is primarily hydrophobic (Fig. 5b), a few significant hydrogen bonds between PCP and NarI are also observed. The hydroxyl group of PCP is hydrogen-bonded to one of the propionate groups of bD and to Nϵ-H66 (2.8-Å distance from both ligands, Fig. 6a). H66 simultaneously coordinates the heme bD iron atom via the side chain Nδ atom. The edge-to-edge distance between the heme bD and PCP is 2.8 Å, which is well within the physiological limits for electron transfer (32Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). In light of these observations, we propose that the observed PCP pocket mimics the physiological QD-site. We have modeled an ubiquinol molecule in this cavity with the head group overlapping with the PCP aromatic ring (Figs. 6, a and b). One hydroxyl group (position 1) of UQH2 points in the same direction as the hydroxyl group of the inhibitor, suggesting a pathway for the electron transfer to the heme cofactor. The hydroxyl group on the opposite site of the quinol molecule (position 4) is oriented as Cl4, and the long alkyl chain extends gradually toward the opening of the hydrophobic cleft stabilized by Met-89, Ala-93, Val-64, and Gly-65. The PCP binding pocket can also accommodate a menaquinol molecule (Fig. 6c), suggesting a potential multifunctional Q-site for both napthoquinol and benzoquinol substrates. Structural Characterization of the Mutant Lys-86 in NarI— The conserved residue Lys-86 in NarI is located at one end of the PCP binding pocket (Fig. 6a). The positively charged Nζ of Lys-86 has no logical hydrogen bond donor with the chlorinated PCP and lies ∼6 Å from the Cl4 atom in the inhibitor. However, our molecular modeling of the physiological substrate UQH2 based on the PCP position suggests that relatively small conformational movements of the Lys-86 side chain could allow it to play a role in substrate stabilization, providing a hydrogen bond donor for the hydroxyl oxygen at position 4 (analogous to Cl4 in PCP) (Fig. 6b). To prove our hypothesis, we have determined the crystal structure of NarGHI carrying the singlepoint mutation K86A in NarI, previously characterized by kinetic, FQ, and EPR experiments (Figs. 2, 3, 4). The structure of NarGHI-K86A (1.9-Å resolution; Table I) is highly similar to the native structure (r.m.s.d. of 0.12 Å for 217 superposed Cα atoms in NarI (30Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar)), indicating that the structural integrity of the PCP binding pocket has been largely preserved in this mutant form. In addition, after soaking the NarGHI-K86A crystals with PCP, the inhibitor can still bind to the QD site. On the other hand, our fluorescence quench titration experiments showed that NarGHI-K86A has much lower affinity for the menaquinol analog HOQNO compared with the native enzyme (Fig. 3A) (6Rather R.A. Blasco F. Magalon A. Asso M. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12747-12757Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and has a lower plumbagin:nitrate oxidoreductase activity (10 s–1) than the wild-type NarGHI (68 s–1). Overall, the experimental data strengthen our working model that Lys-86 is an essential residue in defining the Q-site and that the binding of ubiquinol as well as menaquinol electron donors can occur at our structurally defined pocket. Structural Characterization of the Mutant H66Y in NarI—In native NarGHI the Nδ side-chain atoms of the highly conserved His-66 (helix II) and His-187 (helix V) in NarI provide direct coordination to the iron atom of the heme bD. It has been shown that the single point mutation of His-66 to tyrosine (H66Y) prevents the insertion of the heme bD as well as the binding of quinol analogs and inhibitors. Consequently, no quinol-dependent heme reduction is detected (7Magalon A. Rather R.A. Lemesle-Meunier D. Frixon C. Weiner J.H. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10851-10856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Zhao Z. Rather R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14225-14233Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, in the NarGHI-PCP complex structure we present here the 13.2-Å edge-to-edge distance between the heme bP and the bound PCP could still support electron transfer even in the absence of heme bD (32Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis for the effect of the H66Y mutation on quinol-dependent activity, we have determined the crystal structure of NarGHI-H66Y to 2.5-Å resolution (Fig. 7). The structure is very similar to the native NarGHI, with a r.m.s.d. of only 0.27 Å for 211 common Cα between the NarI-H66Y subunit and the native NarI (30Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar). As expected, NarI-H66Y shows only one redox center, the heme bP. No electron density for the distal heme bD is observed at any level in our maps. It appears that in the absence of the heme bD, the structure is stabilized in a native-like conformation via a hydrogen bond between Tyr-66-OH and His-187-Nδ (∼3.0 Å). A localized but major change is also observed for the transmembrane helix II, where no electron density is observed for a stretch of residues from the mutated Tyr-66 to Leu-81 (Thr-72 to Leu-81 is also highly disordered in the native enzyme). This disordered region contains two residues, Gly-69 and Met-70, which directly form one side of the PCP binding pocket. The less rigid protein environment around the potential QD site explains the loss of PCP, HOQNO, and quinol binding in the mutant enzyme. Proton Pathway from the PCP Binding Site—Experimental evidence shows that NarI allows for the coupling of quinol oxidation and proton translocation toward the periplasm (31Rather R.A. Blasco F. Magalon A. Weiner J.H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 273-283PubMed Google Scholar). The two propionate groups of bD in NarI point toward the periplasmic face of the membrane. Between the propionates and the bulk solvent (∼9 Å distance from the surface) there exists a network of water molecules formed by Trp-580, Trp-595, Trp-676, and Trp-677 (also present in the native structure, Protein Data Bank code 1Q16). The observed water molecules (temperature factors range from 28 to 48 Å2 at full occupancy) are buried within NarI and are the only water molecules observed within the transmembrane helices. These waters form several hydrogen bonds among themselves and with both the propionate groups of heme bD, the main chain nitrogen atoms of Ser-154, Glu-155, Met-156, and the side chains of the highly conserved Ser-143, Ser-147, and Gln-87 (Fig. 6a). This water channel suggests a possible proton pathway from the QD-site to the periplasm. We have presented herein the crystal structure of nitrate reductase A (NarGHI) in complex with the specific inhibitor PCP at 2.0 Å resolution. The high quality electron density map shows that the bound PCP is well ordered in the structure corroborating the measured affinity of NarI for this compound (Kic = 57 nm). The close proximity of PCP to heme bD (edge-to-edge distance of only 2.8 Å) and the significant change in the EPR line shape of bD elicited by this compound are highly suggestive that PCP mimics the physiological quinol electron donors. Furthermore, the location of the PCP binding pocket is consistent with the involvement of both hemes in electron transfer from quinol to nitrate (1Bertero M.G. Rather R.A. Palak M. Hou C. Lim D. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 6Rather R.A. Blasco F. Magalon A. Asso M. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12747-12757Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Rather R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8296-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The PCP binding pocket is located in the narrow hydrophobic cleft B (Fig. 5b), which provides a more ideal spatial constriction for the correct quinol orientation compared with the wider cleft A. Molecular modeling shows that both physiological electron donors, ubiquinol and menaquinol, can occupy the PCP binding pocket, supporting the proposal of a multifunctional site in NarI. This hypothesis is also strengthened by the mainly competitive inhibitory effect of PCP (an UQH2 analog) on NarGHI activity in the presence of plumbagin (a menaquinol analog). In addition, mutation of the amino acid Lys-86, which lines the proposed Q-site, to a neutral residue affects HOQNO (a menaquinol analog) binding. The QP-site in E. coli fumarate reductase represents a similar example of a multifunctional site. In fact, crystallographic analysis has shown that the two inhibitors, DNP-19 and HOQNO, can both bind at QP. It has to be noted that these molecules adopt different locations within the same pocket (33Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Croal L.R. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16124-16130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that also within QD of NarI, menaquinol and ubiquinol occupy different positions, and further structural studies will be pursued with diverse analogs and inhibitors. The available information for many quinone-reactive sites in different respiratory and photosynthetic complexes shows very weak sequence and structural similarities (34Fisher N. Rich P.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1153-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, the Q-site identified in our study contains some critical residues that have been observed in other respiratory proteins. For example, His-66, which coordinates heme bD, is positioned within hydrogen-bonding distance from the hydroxyl group of PCP. Histidine residues are emerging as a common theme in quinol/quinone binding, and in particular, a heme-ligand histidine functioning as a quinone-ligand has been described in E. coli FdnGHI, the redox partner of NarGHI during nitrate respiration (4Jormakka M. Tornroth S. Byrne B. Iwata S. Science. 2002; 295: 1863-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our mutagenesis studies have shown the importance of another residue, Lys-86, for NarI functionality. Similarly, in E. coli fumarate reductase a lysine residue in close proximity to the quinone molecule at the QP-site plays a potential role in proton shuttling (33Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Croal L.R. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16124-16130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A second Q-site in NarI has been recently proposed according to the available kinetic data (9Zhao Z. Rather R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14225-14233Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The elongated hydrophobic cavity A (Fig. 5b) where both hemes are exposed is a good candidate for a secondary quinone reactive site. On the other hand, the apolar pocket A does not contain any ionizable group as found in a number of Q-sites, including QP in E. coli fumarate reductase (35Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1961-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), QD in Wolinella succinogenes fumarate reductase (36Lancaster C.R. Gorss R. Haas A. Ritter M. Mantele W. Simon J.

Science. 2002; 295: 1863-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the hypothetical secondary Q-site may be important for structural integrity of NarI with possible electron transfer but not proton translocation activities. The lack of density for any quinone molecule at this site in the native and NarGHI-PCP complex structures could be due to the presence of Thesit during the purification of the complex. In fact, tubular-shaped densities, which can be modeled as the aliphatic chains of detergent or lipid molecules, were observed in this cavity in the native NarGHI structure (1Bertero M.G. Rather R.A. Palak M. Hou C. Lim D. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Quinol oxidation by NarI leads to electron transfer through the prosthetic groups of the enzyme as well as proton release into the periplasm. The chain of water molecules located between the propionates of heme bD and the bulk solvent recalls a “proton wire,” which has been proposed in other respiratory enzymes such as E. coli FdnGHI (4Jormakka M. Tornroth S. Byrne B. Iwata S. Science. 2002; 295: 1863-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex (37Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Assuming that the PCP binding site functions as a Q-site, we suggest a potential quinol oxidation mechanism. (i) A fully reduced ubiquinol molecule binds to the site in NarI. The hydroxyl group in position 1 of UQH2 forms hydrogen bonds to one of the bD propionates and to His-66. (ii) One electron is transferred to bD, the first redox cofactor in the Nar chain, and one proton is shuttled toward the periplasm via the propionate group and the water channel illustrated in the structure. A semiquinone intermediate species is formed. (iii) The second electron is transferred with complete oxidation of quinol to quinone. A second proton has to be released, and Lys-86 could provide the pathway for the proton to the aqueous milieu. The fully oxidized ubiquinone must now dissociate to allow further enzyme turnover.

https://openalex.org/W2154535504,"General strategies to obtain inactive kinases have utilized mutation of key conserved residues in the kinase core, and the equivalent Lys72 in cAMP-dependent kinase has often been used to generate a “dead” kinase. Here, we have analyzed the consequences of this mutation on kinase structure and function. Mutation of Lys72 to histidine (K72H) generated an inactive enzyme, which was unphosphorylated. Treatment with an exogenous kinase (PDK-1) resulted in a mutant that was phosphorylated only at Thr197 and remained inactive but nevertheless capable of binding ATP. Ser338 in K72H cannot be autophosphorylated, nor can it be phosphorylated in an intermolecular process by active wild type C-subunit. The Lys72 mutant, once phosphorylated on Thr197, can bind with high affinity to the RIα subunits. Thus a dead kinase can still act as a scaffold for binding substrates and inhibitors; it is only phosphoryl transfer that is defective. Using a potent inhibitor of C-subunit activity, H-89, Escherichia coli-expressed C-subunit was also obtained in its unphosphorylated state. This protein is able to mature into its active form in the presence of PDK-1 and is able to undergo secondary autophosphorylation on Ser338. Unlike the H-89-treated wild type protein, the mutant protein (K72H) cannot undergo the subsequent cis autophosphorylation following phosphorylation at Thr197. Using these two substrates and mammalian-expressed PDK-1, we can elucidate a possible two-step process for the activation of the C-subunit: initial phosphorylation on the activation loop at Thr197 by PDK-1, or a PDK-1-like enzyme, followed by second cis autophosphorylation step at Ser338.

Fig. 1, A and B, highlight the structure of the activation segment of PKA, including the phosphate on Thr197 and the environment surrounding the Ser338 phosphate. The phosphate on Thr197 in the activation loop of the C-subunit interacts with His87 of the C helix, Arg165 adjacent to the catalytic base, Asp166, Thr195 on the activation loop, and Lys189 in β-strand 9, which positions Arg190 to interact with the A helix. These interactions act in a synergistic fashion with the phosphate, helping to bring these residues to their proper spatial orientation, but they also anchor the phosphate and consequently the activation segment in a conformation required for activity (8Toner-Webb J. van Patten S.M. Walsh D.A. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25174-25180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of Thr197 and Ser338 demonstrated their importance for full activity (9Adams J.A. McGlone M.L. Gibson R. Taylor S.S.

Many protein kinases, the structures of which have been solved in the unphosphorylated inactive form, show that the position of this loop differs from that of the phosphorylated enzyme (Fig. 1C) (8Toner-Webb J. van Patten S.M.

Additionally, studies monitoring the fluorescence of an endogenous Trp on the insulin receptor kinase activation loop showed a change in fluorescence intensity upon phosphorylation of the activation loop and reflect the dynamic properties of the loop (15Bishop S.M. Ross J.B. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3079-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).In many kinases, phosphorylation of the activation loop is a highly dynamic process triggered by a specific signal. In contrast, although PKA is also a phosphoprotein, it is not activated by phosphorylation of its activation loop in response to a signaling event. Instead, the fully phosphorylated enzyme is assembled with inhibitory regulatory subunits. Its activity in cells is thus controlled primarily by regulatory subunits (R-subunits) that bind the C-subunit with high affinity in the absence of cAMP (16Doskeland S.O. Ogreid D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2291-2301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mode of activation in which the regulatory and catalytic moieties are separate proteins is unusual in the protein kinase family. Although the C-subunit can be readily phosphorylated in vitro by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1), it also undergoes autophosphorylation when it is expressed in E. coli (17Moore M.J. Kanter J.R. Jones K.C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47878-47884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutant forms of the C-subunit that are defective in autophosphorylation are readily phosphorylated in mammalian cells, whereas mutants that are defective in recognition by PDK-1 are not phosphorylated (18Steinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, nothing is known about the conformation of the C-subunit in its unphosphorylated state, and very little is known about the process by which the inactive dephosphorylated protein is converted into a fully phosphorylated protein prior to its association with regulatory subunits.In addition to these essential phosphorylation sites, there are various key residues in the kinase core that play a significant role in the stability and the functional organization of the kinase. One such residue, Lys72 located in subdomain II in the Hanks classification (19Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar), represents one of the most conserved residues in the protein kinase core. This was the first residue to be identified in the active site of a protein kinase (Fig. 1D). The absolute conservation of this residue in every protein kinase subsequently reinforced its importance. This residue was first found to be important for kinase function of the C-subunit using an ATP affinity analog FSBA. The alkylating group on FSBA occupies the region of the protein that recognizes the phosphates of ATP (20Jacobson M.A. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1454-1460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bhatnagar D. Hartl F.T. Roskoski Jr., R. Lessor R.A. Leonard N.J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4350-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and treatment of the C-subunit with FSBA resulted in inactivation that was protected in the presence of MgATP. Peptide sequencing later identified the modified residue as Lys72 (22Zoller M.J. Nelson N.C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10837-10842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with a hydrophobic carbodiimide, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, in the absence of MgATP also irreversibly inhibited the C-subunit, due to cross-linking of Lys72 to Asp184, another conserved residue (23Buechler J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2065-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).In this work, we have addressed two questions. First, we ask what are the functional consequences of mutation of lysine 72? Second, can this “dead” kinase be used to probe the pathway whereby the C-subunit is activated by phosphorylation? To achieve this, Lys72 was replaced with His, Arg, Ala, and Met. Additionally, to provide a suitable comparison with the inactive C-subunit, the wild type C-subunit was expressed in the presence of a PKA inhibitor, H-89. This C-subunit is not phosphorylated. Using phospho-specific antibodies, we show that both H-89 and the Lys72 mutants are excellent substrates for PDK-1 at Thr197; however, only wild type C-subunit can be phosphorylated at Ser338 and thus converted into an active enzyme. These results define a two-step activation process dependent on an intramolecular autophosphorylation at Ser338. In addition, we show that phosphorylation at Thr197 is sufficient for RIα binding, thus defining a new role for the activation loop independent of its role in coordinating the active site conformation. Thus the dead enzyme is still capable of forming a holoenzyme complex once it is phosphorylated.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Reagents were obtained as follows: pRSETB expression vector (Invitrogen), [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), Escherichia coli strains BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI), H-89 (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA), Muta-Gene site directed mutagenesis kit and Affi-Gel (Bio-Rad), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences), Gammabind G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), pcDNA-3 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen), Super-Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate detection kit (Pierce), oligonucleotides (Genosis-Sigma), the PepTag PKA activity assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI), and Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies (Covance, Princeton, NJ), antibodies that specifically recognize the phosphorylated activation loop of protein kinase C (PKC), were a gift from A. Newton (University of California, San Diego, CA) (24Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Antibodies against the catalytic subunit of PKA were described previously (10Yonemoto W. McGlone M.L. Grant B. Taylor S.S. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCMV5 containing Myc-tagged PDK1 were the same as described previously (25Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), and DNA sequencing was performed with the ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer from PE Applied Biosystems. The peptide to the Thr197 sequence was synthesized at the Peptide and Oligonucleotide Facility at the University of California, San Diego on a Millagen 9050 PepSys peptide synthesizer using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) methodology activator and purified by high performance liquid chromatography.Mass Spectrometry—Electrospray/mass spectrometry was performed using a Hewlett-Packard 59887A electrospray mass spectrometer. Protein was desalted prior to analysis by narrow bore chromatography.Site-specific Antibodies—Antibodies were generated to distinguish the phosphorylation state of residues at several sites in the C-subunit. The antibody to the unphosphorylated Thr197 (α-Thr197-OH) was generated using a peptide corresponding to the sequence around Thr197: 192KGRTWTLCGTPEYLA206. This peptide was sent to Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. (Reamstown, PA) for antibody generation in rabbit. The peptide antigen and rabbit antibody to the phosphorylated Ser338 (α-Ser338-P) were generated by SynPep Corp. (Dublin, CA) using the peptide sequence IRVpS338INEKAGKE, where pS338 is phosphorylated serine. The α-Ser338-P and α-Thr197-OH antibodies were affinity-purified by conjugating wild type and K72H respectively to Bio-Rad Affi-Gel and following the manufacturer's protocol.Site-directed Mutagenesis of the PKA Catalytic Subunit—cDNA for the murine PKA Cα-subunit in the bacterial expression vector pRESTB was used as a template for Kunkel-based site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (26Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar, 27Yonemoto W.M. McGlone M.L. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). cDNA for the C-subunit transfected into COS cells was engineered in the pcDNA-3 expression vector, with a HA epitope tag added at the C terminus of the protein. All mutations were made using the Muta-Gene kit as per the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA sequencing analysis instruments confirmed the presence of the correct mutation.Expression of Murine PKA Catalytic Subunit—Histidine-tagged wild type and mutant C-subunits were expressed in the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown in YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5–0.8, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for an additional 6 h at 24 °C, collected by centrifugation, and stored frozen. To obtain unphosphorylated C-subunit, 50 μm H-89 was added to the cultures from a 1,000× stock of H-89 in Me2SO at the time of induction. Cells from 500 ml of culture were resuspended in 10-ml lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0) and lysed by one pass in a French pressure cell at 1,000 p.s.i. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm in a Beckman JA20 rotor at 4 °C for 40 min. The proteins were purified via their His tag using Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech). In brief, supernatant was batch-bound to 1.0-ml resin/500-ml culture for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was batch-washed twice with lysis buffer, a wash with 10 mm imidazole in lysis buffer followed by two 100 mm imidazole elutions and a final 500 mm elution.Catalytic Activity Assays—The PepTag assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. This qualitative assay uses the Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) peptide substrate tagged with a fluorescent dye. Upon phosphorylation, the net charge of this peptide changes from +1 to –1, which then alters the migration of the peptide when run on an agarose gel. Briefly, lysed bacterial supernatant expressing the wild type or mutant proteins was incubated with the tagged Kemptide substrate and activator buffers at 30 °C, and the reaction was run on a 1% agarose gel at 100 V. Active protein was detected by its substrate migrating toward the anode.Expression of Myc-tagged PDK-1 in 293 Cells—Human 293 cells were propagated at 2 × 106/10-cm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. pCMV5 vector containing Myc-tagged PDK-1 was transfected using Qiagen Effectene transfection kit. 48 h after transfection, the cells were trypsinized and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) as described (25Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The cells were then subjected to three rounds of freeze-thaw cycle followed by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA 100 rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. Purified recombinant PDK-1 was used when indicated and was a gift from A. Newton (University of California, San Diego).Immunoprecipitation and PDK-1 Phosphorylation Assays—For the immunoprecipitation experiments, 2 μl of mouse anti-Myc antibody were mixed with the cell extract from 1% of a 10-cm dish of 293 cells transfected with PDK-1 in 25 μl of buffer A for 2 h on ice. The immunocomplex was then transferred to 10 μl (bed volume) of protein G-Sepharose resin and mixed for 1 h on a rotating wheel at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates then were washed at room temperature five times: twice with buffer A, twice with buffer A plus 0.5 m NaCl, and once with buffer B (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For the kinase assay, 0.25 μg of (H-89)-C was mixed with 25 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2 in 25 μl of buffer B and incubated with the immobilized PDK-1 for 45 min at 30 °C with frequent gentle mixing.Autophosphorylation of Ser338—1 μm H6-K72H was used as a substrate for PDK-1 as described above. After a 90-min incubation with PDK-1, 0.2 μm active untagged wild type C-subunit was added for an additional 60 min. Aliquots with and without the addition of wild type enzyme were added to SDS-gel loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using the α-C-subunit and α-Ser338-P antibodies to determine the phosphorylation state of Ser338. To evaluate the concentration dependence of autophosphorylation, (H-89)-C subunit in varying amounts (1–10 μm) was mixed with 25 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2 in 25 μl of buffer B and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli loading buffer (4×) and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%), and the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film.Binding to Regulatory Subunit—6 μg of mutant proteins were incubated for 60 min with 5 μg of RIα regulatory subunit (in presence of 5 mm Mg+2 and 5 mm ATP), which act as pseudo substrates in vivo, and run on a non-denaturing Tris/glycine gel. The H6-K72H did not bind to RIα, and a band was observed corresponding to the free R-subunit. The PDK-1-treated H6-K72H catalytic subunit mutant formed a complex with the RIα. The bands ran slightly higher than the wild type catalytic subunit since the mutant had a polyHis tag.Phosphorylation State of Transfected C-subunit Constructs—Wild type, T197A, and S338A in the pcDNA-3 expression vector HA-tagged at the C terminus were transfected into COS cells using the Effectine transfection kit as per the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were resuspended in Buffer A and lysed by three rounds of freeze-thaw followed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 20 min 16,000 rpm. Transfected C-subunit was isolated by immunoprecipitation using a mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody. These samples were then immunoblotted with the indicated rabbit generated antibodies to determine expression and phosphorylation state.RESULTSPurification of Wild Type C-subunit and Lys72 Mutants— Lys72 is conserved throughout the protein kinase family and is critical to kinase activity. When this residue is mutated, activity is dramatically decreased. Mutation of the equivalent Lys in other kinase family members often serves as the traditional “kinase-dead” mutant. To probe the function of Lys72 and to explore its phosphorylation state, four different mutations (K72A, K72H, K72M, and K72R) were made at the Lys72 position. The mutant proteins were purified by the addition of a polyHis tag at the N terminus followed by affinity chromatography. A qualitative PepTag activity assay was used to determine whether these proteins were active. Although all proteins were purified in equivalent amounts, only the wild type subunit was active (Fig. 2B). Based on densitometry and the coupled kinase assay, the activity of these mutants was less than 1% of the wild type C-subunit.Fig. 2Characteristics of Lys72 mutant proteins. The purified Lys72 mutant proteins were assayed for their ability to act as substrates of PDK-1 and for activity. In A, wild type C-subunit and Lys72 mutant proteins were incubated with immunoprecipitated Myc-PDK-1 in the presence of MgATP and [γ-32P]ATP. 32P incorporation was visualized by autoradiography. B, the activity of these proteins was determined using the PepTag activity assay. Fluorescent tagged Kemptide substrate peptide was run on an agarose gel, where phosphorylation is determined by a shift in the direction of mobility. Experiments were carried out multiple times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mass spectroscopy of the mutant proteins indicated that their mass was consistent for each mutant protein in an unphosphorylated state (Table I). To determine whether these dead kinases could be phosphorylated by a heterologous protein kinase, the Lys72 mutant proteins were all incubated with PDK-1 and [32P]ATP. As indicated in Fig. 2A, all four mutant proteins were phosphorylated by PDK-1, in contrast to the wild type C-subunit, which is already fully phosphorylated prior to incubation with [32P]ATP. However, although these mutant proteins were good substrates for PDK-1, activity was not restored upon phosphorylation (data not shown).Table IMass spectroscopy of Lys72 mutant proteinsMutantTheoretical mass (two phosphates)Theoretical mass (unphosphorylated)Actual massH6K72A42,704.742,544.742,543.6H6K72H42,770.842,610.842,611.1H6K72M42,764.842,604.842,604.8H6K72R42,789.842,629.842,626.4 Open table in a new tab Phosphospecific Antibodies—To specifically characterize the phosphorylation state of the C-subunit, antibodies were generated that could distinguish the phosphorylation at Thr197 and Ser338. It was established previously that an antibody generated against a phosphorylated peptide corresponding to Thr500 in the activation loop of protein kinase C was also able to discriminate the phosphorylation state of Thr197 in the activation loop of the C-subunit (28Cheng X. Shaltiel S. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14005-14013Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This segment is highly conserved in PKA and PKC. This antibody will be referred to here as α-Thr197-P. Additional peptides were synthesized to generate antibodies specific to other phosphorylation sites. Peptides were synthesized corresponding to the unphosphorylated Thr197 of the activation loop as well as the phosphorylated site in the C-terminal tail at Ser338 and used as the antigen for generation of antibodies in rabbits. These antibodies are designated as α-Thr197-OH and α-Ser338-P.Autophosphorylation of Wild Type and Mutant C-subunit— The ability of the proteins to undergo autophosphorylation following phosphorylation with PDK-1 was tested using the antibodies specific to the two phosphorylation sites, Thr197 and Ser338. To compare wild type with the Lys72 mutants, we needed a wild type control protein that is not phosphorylated. To obtain dephosphorylated C-subunit, the wild type protein was expressed in the presence of an inhibitor of the C-subunit. The addition of H-89, an ATP analog, at the time of induction inhibits the C-subunit and prevents autophosphorylation (29Cauthron R.D. Carter K.B. Liauw S. Steinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1416-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Both K72H- and H-89-treated wild type were incubated with PDK-1, and samples of each, before and after PDK-1 treatment, were subjected to Western blot analysis. All three antibodies indicated that neither protein was phosphorylated before PDK-1 treatment (Fig. 3). Following incubation with PDK-1, each substrate protein was phosphorylated, but phosphorylation was not equivalent. The α-Thr197-P antibody indicated that both proteins were phosphorylated at this site. The antibody to the unphosphorylated Thr197 demonstrated, furthermore, that phosphorylation was essentially complete. Although phosphorylation of wild type (H-89) protein was complete, over 80% of K72H was phosphorylated. A significant difference between the two proteins was phosphorylation at the Ser338 site. Indeed, after PDK-1 treatment, only the wild type (H-89) protein underwent this second phosphorylation event. Only 2% of Lys72 mutant was phosphorylated, whereas over 74% of wild type (H-89) protein was phosphorylated at Ser338. A blot using an antibody to the C-subunit showed that all these proteins were of equal intensity before and after phosphorylation.Fig. 3Specificity of antibodies directed to phosphorylation sites in the C-subunit of PKA. Phosphorylated wild type (Wt), unphosphorylated wild type (H-89), and the unphosphorylated K72H mutant protein were used to demonstrate the specificity of phospho-specific antibodies by Western blot analysis. The first panel illustrates a probe using the α-Thr197-P antibody, the second panel illustrates a probe using the α-Thr197-OH antibody, and the third panel illustrates a probe using α-Ser338-P antibody. A blot using the α-C-subunit demonstrates equivalent protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Stoichiometry of Phosphorylation—The rate of phosphorylation of the Lys72 mutant proteins by PDK-1 was then compared with phosphorylation of the wild type (H-89) protein. Both proteins are rapidly phosphorylated, but more 32P was incorporated into the wild type (H-89) substrate as compared with the K72H mutant protein, despite an equivalent amount of protein (Fig. 4A). It was established previously that in vitro, the only site of phosphorylation by PDK-1 is Thr197 (30Cheng X. Ma Y. Moore M. Hemmings B.A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9849-9854Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), yet there is another phosphorylation event necessary to produce the fully phosphorylated and active C-subunit. This other phosphorylation event is likely brought about by autophosphorylation, which the mutant protein is incapable of undergoing.Fig. 4Phosphorylation and activity of C-subunit substrates by PDK-1 as a function of time.A, equivalent amounts of wild type (Wt) (H-89) and K72H (0.25 μg) were incubated with immunoprecipitated Myc-PDK-1 (5 nm) in the presence of MgATP and [γ-32P]ATP. Aliquots were removed at the indicated times and, after SDS-PAGE, 32P incorporation was visualized by autoradiography. B, PDK-1 was incubated with both wild type (H-89) and K72H (1 μm). Aliquots were removed at the indicated times, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotted with the α-Thr197-P, α-Thr197-OH, and α-Ser338-P antibodies. C, a time course was also performed using the PepTag assay on aliquots taken from reactions at the indicated times. Experiments were performed in triplicate with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"
https://openalex.org/W2770808739,"The riddle is solved of how vast crab populations can thrive in an extreme, toxic habitat. The crab Xenograpsus testudinatus lives at enormously high densities around the sulphur-rich hydrothermal vents found in shallow waters off Taiwan, even though this acidic environment is low in nutrients. Here we show that these crabs swarm out of their crevices at slack water and feed on the vast numbers of zooplankton that are killed by the vents' sulphurous plumes, and that rain down like marine ‘snow’. This opportunistic feeding behaviour explains how the crabs are able to survive in the adverse toxic environment of these shallow hydrothermal vents."
https://openalex.org/W2091830321,"Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is caused by low expression of frataxin, a small mitochondrial protein. Studies with both yeast and mammals have suggested that decreased frataxin levels lead to elevated intramitochondrial concentrations of labile (chelatable) iron, and consequently to oxidative mitochondrial damage. Here, we used the mitochondrion-selective fluorescent iron indicator/chelator rhodamine B-[(1,10-phenanthrolin-5-yl)aminocarbonyl]benzylester (RPA) to determine the mitochondrial chelatable iron of FRDA patient lymphoblast and fibroblast cell lines, in comparison with age- and sex-matched control cells. No alteration in the concentration of mitochondrial chelatable iron could be observed in patient cells, despite strongly decreased frataxin levels. Uptake studies with 55Fe-transferrin and iron loading with ferric ammonium citrate revealed no significant differences in transferrin receptor density and iron responsive protein/iron regulatory element binding activity between patients and controls. However, sensitivity to H2O2 was significantly increased in patient cells, and H2O2 toxicity could be completely inhibited by the ubiquitously distributing iron chelator 2,2′-dipyridyl, but not by the mitochondrion-selective chelator RPA. Our data strongly suggest that frataxin deficiency does not affect the mitochondrial labile iron pool or other parameters of cellular iron metabolism and suggest a decreased antioxidative defense against extramitochondrial iron-derived radicals in patient cells.

Chen L.-S. Lonnerdal B. Gellera C. Taroni F.A. Cortopassi G.A. Hum. Mol. Gen. 2001; 19: 2099-2107Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Clinically, Friedreich's ataxia is characterized by multiple symptoms including progressive gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, diabetes mellitus, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy leading to premature death (2Mateo I. Llorca J. Volpini V. Corral J. Berciano J. Combarros O. Acta Neurol. Scand. 2004; 109: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). There is currently no effective treatment for FRDA. FRDA is caused by a GAA trinucleotide expansion in the frataxin gene located on chromosome locus 9q13, resulting in a reduced expression of frataxin, a small mitochondrial protein (3Harding A.E. Brain. 1981; 104: 589-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Campuzano V. Montermini L. Molto M.D. Pianese M. Cossee M. Cavalcanti F. Monros E. Rodius F. Duclos F. Monticeli A.

Because of the mitochondrial localization of frataxin, the neuro- and cardio-degenerations observed in FRDA are thought to be the result of a mitochondrial defect (1Tan G. Chen L.-S. Lonnerdal B. Gellera C. Taroni F.A. Cortopassi G.A. Hum. Mol. Gen. 2001; 19: 2099-2107Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The importance of frataxin for viability is underscored by the recent finding that a knockout of this gene leads to early embryonic lethality in mice (6Cossée M. Puccio H. Gansmuller A. Koutnikova H. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Fischbeck K. Dolle P. Koenig M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite a large number of studies that have focused on the function of frataxin in bacteria, yeast, mice, and human cells, its role in the pathogenesis of FRDA is still largely unknown and discussed controversially (7Babcock M. de Silva D.

In accordance with the often proposed antioxidant function of frataxin, antioxidant enzyme levels have been found to be significantly different in blood from FRDA patients compared with controls (15Tozzi G. Nuccetelli M. Lo Bello M. Bernardini S. Bellincampi L. Ballerini S. Gaeta L.M. Casali C. Pastore A. Federici G. Bertini E. Piemonte F. Arch. Dis. Child. 2002; 86: 376-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), frataxin has been reported to play a critical role in repair of mitochondrial Fe/S clusters in mitochondrial aconitase (12Bulteau A.-L. O'Neill H.A. Kennedy M.C. Ikeda-Saito M. Isaya G. Szweda L.I. Science. 2004; 305: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that superoxide dismutase (SOD) genes are not induced by oxidative stress in FRDA fibroblasts, in contrast to control cells (10Voncken M. Ioannou P. Delatycki M.B. Neurogenetics. 2004; 5: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Jiralerspong S. Ge B. Hudson T.J. Pandolfo M.

Genet. 2001; 10: 2061-2067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The prevailing hypothesis underlying the pathogenesis of FRDA, however, proposes that frataxin is somehow involved in the regulation of mitochondrial iron homeostasis and that impaired intramitochondrial iron metabolism results in iron overload and oxidative stress (10Voncken M. Ioannou P. Delatycki M.B. Neurogenetics. 2004; 5: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Patel P.I. Isaya G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 241515-241524Google Scholar, 19Puccio H. Koenig M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 887-892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An accumulation of iron detected as iron deposits using Perl's staining has been consistently observed on autopsy in heart muscle of FRDA patients (20Lamarche J.B. Shapcott D. Cote M. Lemieux B. Lechtenberg R. Handbook of Cerebellar Diseases. Marcel Dekker, New York1993: 453-456Google Scholar) and magnetic resonance imaging data indicate that iron also accumulates in the dentate nucleus (21Waldvogel D. van Gelderen P. Hallett M. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). A small but significant intramitochondrial accumulation of total iron has also been reported in one patient study (22Delatycki M.B. Camakaris J. Brooks H. Evans-Whipp T. Thorburn D.R. Williamson R. Forrest S.M. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), while no significant increase in total mitochondrial iron under physiological cell culture conditions was found in others (1Tan G. Chen L.-S. Lonnerdal B. Gellera C. Taroni F.A. Cortopassi G.A. Hum. Mol. Gen. 2001; 19: 2099-2107Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19Puccio H. Koenig M. Hum. Mol.

Intramitochondrial iron accumulation has been postulated to be the primary pathogenetic event initiating the production of hydroxyl radicals by Fenton chemistry, leading to inactivation of Fe/S proteins, lipid peroxidation and damage to nucleic acids and proteins, finally resulting in cell death (10Voncken M. Ioannou P. Delatycki M.B. Neurogenetics. 2004; 5: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Bradley J.L. Blake J.C. Chamberlain S. Thomas P.K. Cooper J.M. Schapira A.H.V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 275-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in a conditional knock-out mouse model for FRDA, accumulation of intramitochondrial total iron has been reported to follow a decrease in the Fe/S cluster-containing subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (complexes I-III) and of the enzyme aconitase (25Puccio H. Simon D. Cossee M. Criqui-Filipe P. Tiziano F. Melki J. Hindelang C. Matyas R. Rustin P. Koenig M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), and thus was suggested to be a late event in the pathogenetic process. The form of iron generally regarded to be responsible for the generation of highly reactive oxygen species mediating oxidative stress is termed “labile” or “chelatable iron,” because of its accessibility to iron chelators (26Petrat F. de Groot H. Sustmann R. Rauen U. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 27Kakhlon O. Cabantchik Z.I. Free Radic. Biol.

Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 132-133Google Scholar). However, although iron is obviously involved in the pathogenesis of FRDA, the connection between frataxin deficiency and the size of the mitochondrial labile (chelatable) iron pool and its role in the pathogenesis of FRDA have not yet been characterized because of the lack of a suitable methodological approach. Therefore, using the novel mitochondrion-specific iron indicator/chelator rhodamine B-[(1,10-phenanthrolin-5-yl)aminocarbonyl]benzylester (RPA, Refs. 29Petrat F. Weisheit D. Lensen M. de Groot H.

In addition, we studied the influence of decreased frataxin levels on various other parameters of iron metabolism as well as the contribution of mitochondrial chelatable iron to cell death under H2O2-induced oxidative stress in FRDA patient cells.

Pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) was a generous gift from Prof. Dr. P. Ponka (Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Montreal, Canada). PIH (100.0 mm) was dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH, then diluted with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS: 137.0 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 0.3 mm Na2HPO4, 25.0 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and adjusted to pH 7.35 (37 °C). Falcon cell culture flasks and Falcon 6-well cell culture plates were obtained from BD Biosciences, glass coverslips were from Assistent (Sondheim/Röhn, Germany), and gas mixtures from Messer Griesheim (Krefeld, Germany). Cell Culture—Lymphoblast and skin fibroblast cell lines from Friedreich's ataxia patients and age- and sex-matched controls were established after informed consent at the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia (Table I).

Human fibroblasts (1.0 × 105 cells), cultured on glass coverslips until confluency, were loaded with RPA (0.2 μm) in HBSS for 20 min at 37 °C, followed by an additional 15 min of incubation in dye-free buffer. Human lymphoblasts were washed once with HBSS by centrifugation (250 × g for 5 min at 37 °C) and attached (5 × 106 cells/ml) to poly-l-lysine-coated (5 μg/cm2) glass coverslips 15 min before loading the cells with RPA. Adherent lymphoblasts were incubated with RPA as described for the fibroblast cell lines. For measurements, cells were incubated in HBSS (37 °C), and measurements were performed by laser scanning microscopy (λexc. = 543 nm and λem. ≥ 560 nm (29Petrat F. Weisheit D. Lensen M. de Groot H. Sustmann R. Rauen U. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)). After establishing the mitochondrial baseline fluorescence, the mitochondrial chelatable iron was removed from the indicator by the addition of a large excess of the membrane-permeable iron chelator PIH (2 mm) leading to a “dequenching” of the RPA fluorescence. The increase in fluorescence was taken as a measure of the concentration of the intramitochondrial chelatable iron, which was quantified using an ex situ calibration. In other experiments, cells were incubated simultaneously with RPA and rhodamine 123 (0.2 μm) in order to prove selective mitochondrial staining. In experiments with double-stained mitochondria, red fluorescence of RPA (λexc. = 543 nm; λem. ≥ 585 nm) and green fluorescence of rhodamine 123 (λexc. = 488 nm; λem. = 505–530 nm) were optically isolated in successive scans. At the end of the experiments, the uptake of the vital dye propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) was routinely determined in order to assess loss in cell viability. The red fluorescence of propidium iodide excited at 543 nm was collected through a 560 nm long-pass filter. Determination of 55Fe-Tf-uptake and Functional Transferrin Receptor Density—The uptake of transferrin-bound iron by FRDA patient and control cells was studied using 55Fe-loaded human apo-Tf. Human apo-Tf was loaded with 55FeCl3 according to Bates and Schlabach (32Bates G.W. Schlabach M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2177-2181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts and lymphoblasts were washed twice with their respective medium containing 50 μm DTPA to remove extracellular iron and then washed once with medium alone. For the 55Fe-Tf-uptake, the cells (5 × 106/ml) were incubated for 30 min in serum-free medium (37 °C) supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA, 20 mm HEPES, and 55Fe-Tf (100–800 nm iron). Transferrin receptor (TfR) saturation kinetics was assessed by incubating the cells with 55Fe-Tf (0–1600 nm iron) for 0–45 min under the same conditions; samples were taken every 15 min. The cellular uptake of 55Fe-Tf was terminated by separating the cells from the supernatant. Lymphoblast suspensions were centrifuged (3,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C) and the pellet was purified by further centrifugation through an oil layer consisting of 80% w/w dibutylphthalate and 20% w/w dioctylphthalate. Fibroblasts were washed with serum-free medium containing 50 μm DTPA to remove extracellular iron and then washed once with BME alone. Cells were lysed overnight in 500 μlof0.5 m KOH with 1% Triton X-100, and the lysates were neutralized with 250 μl of 1 m HCl. Intracellular radioactivity was counted in a Packard liquid scintillation counter (Vienna, Austria) subsequent to the addition of Readysafe. Kinetic analyses were calculated with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Assessment of H2O2 Cytotoxicity—FRDA fibroblasts and control cells were cultured in 12.5 cm2 cell culture flasks until confluency. Before starting the experiments, cells were washed twice with HBSS (37 °C) and then covered with Krebs-Henseleit buffer (115 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm Na2SO4, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), supplemented with 10 mm glucose as previously reported for murine L929 fibroblasts (33Lomonosova E.E. Kirsch M. de Groot H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Afterward, H2O2 was added as a bolus of 500 μm from a concentrated stock solution, and cells were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. In some experiments, the transition metal chelators 2,2′-DPD (200 μm) or 1,10-phenanthroline (100 μm) were added to the Krebs-Henseleit buffer prior to the addition of H2O2 or the cells were preincubated with deferoxamine (10 mm for 30 min in BME, followed by washing with HBSS). Other cultures were preincubated with RPA (0.2 μm, in HBSS, 20 min at 37 °C, followed by an additional 15 min of incubation in dye-free buffer, see above) prior to the start of the experiments. Solvent controls were included. After various periods of incubation, loss in cell viability was assessed by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity using a standard assay. Western Blot Analysis—The endogenous frataxin of cultured human fibroblasts of Friedreich's ataxia patients and healthy control individuals was detected on Western blots using the mouse anti-frataxin monoclonal antibody 2FRA-1G2. Whole cell protein extracts were prepared from 75 cm2 cell culture flasks of subconfluent cells. Cells were lysed in 200 μl of extraction buffer (300 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) for 20 min on ice and centrifuged (3,600 × g at 4 °C for 5 min). The supernatant was used as whole cell extract, and the protein concentration was determined using a protein assay reagent. 100 μg of protein per lane were loaded onto a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and after electrophoresis the gel was blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked with 5% nonfat milk overnight at 4 °C. Incubation with the primary monoclonal antibodies against frataxin (diluted 1:2,500 in 5% BSA) was performed for 1 h at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was used as a secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution, incubation for 1 h). An ECL Western blotting system was used for detection of the immunoreactive proteins according to the manufacturer's instructions. IRP/IRE Bandshift Assay—The activity of iron regulatory proteins (IRP)/iron responsive elements (IRE) in FRDA fibroblasts and control cells was determined according to the method described by Müllner et al. (34Mu ̈llner E.W. Neupert B. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with BME containing 50 μm DTPA to remove extracellular iron and then once with the medium alone. To study basal and iron-induced changes in IRP/IRE activity, cells were then incubated in the absence or presence of 150 μm ferric ammonium citrate for 6 h in serum-free medium (37 °C) supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA and 20 mm HEPES. Afterward, the fibroblasts were lysed in 0.2% Nonidet P-40 buffer (40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6). Radioactive labeled IRE probes were prepared by in vitro transcription of pSPT-Fer (IRE of human ferritin H-chain mRNA (34Mu ̈llner E.W. Neupert B. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar)) in the presence of [α-32P]cytidinetriphosphate. IRE/IRP binding reactions were carried out with 2 μg of protein and 640,000 cpm of 32P-labeled IRE probe by incubation for 20 min at room temperature. Thereafter, samples were treated with 20 units of RNase T1 and 5 μg/μl heparin for 10 min each. RNA-protein complexes were separated in 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and fixed onto diethylaminoethyl ion exchange paper. Signals corresponding to IRP-IRE complexes were quantified by phosphorimaging (ImageQuant Software, Amersham Biosciences). The total amount of IRP1 was assessed by in vitro reduction with 3% 2-mercaptoethanol prior to the binding reaction. Statistics—All experiments with human lymphoblasts and fibroblasts were performed in duplicate with cell lines from different patients and different age- and sex-matched controls. Cellular microfluorographs and blots shown in the figures are representative of all the corresponding experiments carried out. Other results are expressed as means ± S.D. Data obtained from two groups were compared by means of Student's t test (matched values, two-tailed, paired). A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. GAA Expansion Size and Frataxin Content of Human Fibroblasts and Lymphoblasts Derived from Friedreich's Ataxia Patients—The size of the GAA expansions as determined by polymerase chain reaction on genomic DNA was found to range from about 600–1300 repeats in the lymphoblast and fibroblast cultures of all patients (Table I), thus confirming large GAA alleles on both chromosomes. To verify that the frataxin level in the FRDA patient-derived cell lines was actually decreased, Western blot analysis was carried out. Using the 2FRA-1G2 human antibody we detected a ∼18 kDa protein, i.e. a protein with a molecular mass consistent with the one of human frataxin, in the fibroblasts of the healthy control individuals, whereas the residual frataxin levels of fibroblasts of the Friedreich's ataxia patients were barely detectable (Fig. 1). This result confirmed that the cells derived from Friedreich's ataxia patients and age- and sex-matched controls differed profoundly in their frataxin content, thus excluding the possibility of an artifact arising during the establishment and maintenance of the cell lines. Mitochondrial Chelatable Iron in Cultured Human FRDA and Control Fibroblasts and Lymphoblasts—The nature of the iron that has been reported to accumulate within the mitochondria of patients with Friedreich's ataxia is yet unknown. All of the methods previously used to study changes in the intramitochondrial iron homeostasis primarily assess the total mitochondrial iron content but are not suitable to selectively determine the small fraction of mitochondrial iron that is regarded to be responsible for the initiation of iron-mediated oxidative injury, i.e. the labile (chelatable) iron (26Petrat F. de Groot H.

The substantial disadvantages of the disruptive methods used so far to determine/characterize the intramitochondrial iron in FRDA cells, e.g. atomic absorption spectroscopy (22Delatycki M.B.

Lonnerdal B. Gellera C. Taroni F.A. Cortopassi G.A. Hum. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W1984854284,"Microglia are one of the main cell types activated by brain injury. In the present study, we have investigated how domains of the extracellular matrix molecule tenascin-R (TN-R) modulate microglia function. We found that epidermal growth factor-like repeats inhibited adhesion and migration of microglia via a protein kinase A-dependent mechanism. In contrast, fibronectin 6–8 repeats promoted adhesion and migration of the primary microglia via a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism. Both domains of TN-R induced an up-regulation in the secretion of cytokines, such as chemokine-induced cytokine 3 and tumor neurosis factor α. Interestingly, epidermal growth factor-like repeats and fibronectin 6–8 induced a dramatic up-regulation in the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor/transforming growth factor-β and nerve growth factor/transforming growth factor-β, respectively, and conditioned medium from activated microglia was able to promote neurite outgrowth of N1E-115 cells and primary cortical neurons. These results suggest that TN-R plays a role in neuroprotection through distinct domains coordinating to modulate microglia function.

These results suggest that TN-R plays a role in neuroprotection through distinct domains coordinating to modulate microglia function. Microglia are recognized as one of main players in the response to brain and spinal cord injury because these cells are rapidly activated in response to even minor pathological changes in the central nervous system (1Kreutzberg G.W. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 312-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3710) Google Scholar, 2Moore S. Thanos S. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 1996; 48: 441-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This action leads to a secondary injury in which neurons and glial cells die in the hours, days, or even weeks following the initial injury. After central nervous system injury, the first therapeutic goal is to preserve as many cells as possible because functional recovery cannot be established if the nerve cells are going to die. Thus, any approach to neural regeneration that takes into account the actions of microglia is essential, e.g. suppressing or eliminating the migration of the activated microglia to the injury site. It had been found that TN-R 1The abbreviations used are: TN-R, tenascin-R; EGFL, epidermal growth factor-like repeats; FN, fibronectin type-like repeats; FG, fibrinogen-like domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β.1The abbreviations used are: TN-R, tenascin-R; EGFL, epidermal growth factor-like repeats; FN, fibronectin type-like repeats; FG, fibrinogen-like domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β. was anti-adhesive for activated microglia in vitro and down-regulated in the lesioned nucleus after peripheral nerve axotomy (3Angelov D.N. Walther M. Streppel M. Guntinas-Lichius O. Neiss W.F. Probstmeier R. Pesheva P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6218-6229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of TN-R involved in microglia migration remains unclear.TN-R is expressed predominantly by oligodendrocytes during the onset and early phases of myelin formation and remains expressed by oligodendrocytes in the adult as well as some interneurons in the spinal cord, retina, cerebellum, and hippocampus (4Pesheva P. Spiess E. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 5Bartsch U. Pesheva P. Raff M. Schachner M.

TN-R comprise a cysteine-rich amino-terminal part that is involved in multimerization, a region consisting of epidermal growth factor-like repeats (EGFL), a region consisting of fibronectin type-like (FN) homologous repeats, and a fibrinogen-like domain (FG) at the carboxyl-terminus. Two major TN-R molecules of apparent molecular masses of 160 and 180 kDa have been isolated. Interestingly, TN-R co-localizes with other glial-derived molecules, such as myelin-associated glycoprotein and a phosphacan-related molecule, at high density in central nervous system myelinated axons (8Xiao Z.C. Hillenbrand R. Schachner M. Thermes G.R. Gomaz S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 698-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). TN-R is a multifunctional molecule that promotes neurite outgrowth when presented as a uniform substrate, inhibits growth cone advance when offered as a sharp substrate boundary, induces axonal defasciculation in vitro, resulting from interaction with its neuronal receptor, F3/contactin, and interacts with sodium channels at nodes of Ranvier, modulating the function of sodium channels (9Lochter A.

Chem. 1999; 272: 32092-32101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because TN-R is a glia-derived molecule with multiple domains in the central nervous system, it is intriguing to explore its direct effects in modulating the activated microglia, which indirectly influences neurons. In the present study, taking the advantages of the subcloned domains of TN-R (13Xiao Z.C. Taylor J. Montag D. Rougon G. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 766-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we have shown that distinct TN-R domains may work together to modulate the microglia function during neuroprotection.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPrimary Microglia Culture—Mixed cell culture was prepared following the described method (16Giulian D. Baker T.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cerebral cortex from embryonic Wista rat (embryonic day 18–19) was stripped of meninges, chopped into small chunks, and dissociated in trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) before being seeded into T75 tissue culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 supplement with 10% fetal calf serum. Subsequent medium change was carried out every 3 days. After 10–14 days in culture, floating cells and weakly attached cells on the mixed primary culture cell layer were isolated by gently shaking of the flask for 1 h. The resulting cell suspension was transferred to a Petri dish and allowed to adhere at 37 °C for 1 h. Unattached cells were discarded, and microglia was isolated as strongly adhering cells. About 95% of these attached cells were positive for Mac-1, a marker for microglia cell types.Adhesion Assays—4-well plates were coated with methanol-solubilized nitrocellulose as described previously (17Lagenaur C. Lemmon V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 753-7757Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 13Xiao Z.C. Taylor J. Montag D. Rougon G. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 766-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and air-dried under a sterile hood. For adhesion assays, 2 μl spots of different glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, each at a concentration of 50 μg/ml, were applied in duplicate to the nitrocellulose-coated surfaces of the plate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, the spots were washed three times with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution. The plates were flooded with Ca2+-and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2% heat-inactivated fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and incubated for at least 0.5 h in a 37 °C incubator to block residual nonspecific protein binding sites. Then the plates were washed three times with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution, and freshly dissociated microglia were seeded in 300 μl of medium for adhesion assay. After 1 h (short term) or 24 h (long term), the plate was washed three times with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution, and cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and stained with Coomassie blue. The numbers of cells adhering to different GST fusion protein spots were counted under phase microscopy. All experiments were performed at least three times.Assays for Testing Signaling Pathways Involved—To investigate which signaling pathways are involved in the adhesion assays, microglia were incubated with various kinase and phosphatase inhibitors and activators, respectively, for 30 min prior to plating onto EGFL or FN6–8 coated substrates. The concentration used was as follows: 100 μm erbstatin, 100 μm H7, 100 nm calphostin C, 1 nm okadaic acid, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mm dbcAMP (protein kinase A activating molecule), 0.1, 1.0, and 5.0 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.Transwell Migration Assay—Costar Transwell polycarbonate filters (5-μm pore size) were used in a migration assay to examine the ability of microglia migration (18Deryugina E.I. Bourdon M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 643-652PubMed Google Scholar). The undersurfaces of the 6.5-mm transwell membranes were coated with different TN-R domains and GST (50 μg/ml) in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The undersurfaces were blocked with 2% heat-inactivated fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and then 2.5 × 105 cells/ml were plated in serum-free culture medium into the upper chamber and allowed to migrate through the pores onto the coated undersurfaces at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. After 24 h, cells from the inner surface of the insert were gently wiped out with cotton-tipped swabs, and the inserts were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and stained with crystal violet solution (0.2%). After a final PBS washing, the cells were examined under a microscope to confirm proper morphology, and then dye was extracted with 10% acetic acid. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader. Dye levels are directly proportional to the numbers of microglia. Data are presented as mean ± S.E.Cytokine Array Assay—Purified microglia were cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 medium. Microglia were treated for 8 h in the presence or absence of GST-fusion protein (100 μg/ml GST, EGFL, FN6–8, respectively) in a 37 °C incubator, and then culture medium was changed with fresh serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 medium. After 16 h, supernatants were collected as conditioned medium for cytokine assay. Cytokine array assay was carried out with RayBio™ rat cytokine array kit (RayBiotech, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each cytokine array membrane was scanned and the intensities of signals were quantitated by densitometry (Bio-Rad).Primary Cortical Neuron Culture—Primary cortical neuron culture was prepared as described previously (19Collins L. Asuni A.A. Anderton B.H. Fabre J.W. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2003; 125: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cerebral cortexes were isolated from embryonic day 18 Wistar rat, and meninges were gently removed from cortex. All cortexes were chopped finely and cortical neurons were dissociated by repeated trituration. Dissociated cells were filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer (BD Falcon™) to remove any remaining clumps of cells. The cells were cultured at a concentration of 1 × 105/ml in 48-well plates precoated with poly-l-lysine (0.1 mg/ml) in neurobasal medium containing B27 supplement and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 1 day then used in a neurite outgrowth experiment. Under these conditions, about 95% of cells were positive for MAP2, a marker for neuron cell types.Neurite Outgrowth Assay—Microglia conditioned media (obtained from the above method) were collected for the assay of neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma cell line (N1E-115) and primary cortical neurons. NIE-115 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplement with 10% fetal calf serum. NIE-115 and cortical neurons were cultured in a 48-well plate; medium was replaced with microglia conditioned medium (300 μl). After 24 h, NIE-115 and cortical neurons were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, and NIE-115 was stained with Coomassie blue. The wells were viewed under a microscope (Carl Zeiss). Only cells that did not have contact with other cells were evaluated. Neurites were defined as those processes with a length equivalent to at least one cell body diameter. The number of cells with neurite was calculated from about 90 cells from three independent experiments.Dot Blot—After TN-R domain stimulated microglia for 8 h, microglia conditioned media were collected and dotted on the nitrocellulose membrane (2 μl/do and then membranes were incubated with growth factor antibody (pαNGF purchased from Sigma; pαFGF-2, pαBDNF, pαGDNF, pαTGF-βand pαNT-3, obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:500) for 12h at 4 °C after blocked with 5% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000) for 3 h at room temperature and developed using ECM™ chemiluminescent detection reagents for visualization.Data Analysis—All data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical evaluations were achieved by one-way analysis of variance. Differences were considered to be significant when p < 0.05.RESULTSThe Effects of Different TN-R Domains on Microglia Adhesion—Given that TN-R is an extracellular matrix molecule with multiple domains, we first investigated the effects of different TN-R fragments on activated microglia using cell adhesion assay. Expression of different TN-R domains fused to GST has been described (13Xiao Z.C. Taylor J. Montag D. Rougon G. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 766-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The position of the TN-R-derived domain in GST-fusion protein relative to the TN-R primary structure is indicated in Fig. 1A. Cell adhesion assay was performed in which different fragments were applied as spots to the cell culture plate coated with translucent nitrocellulose. After the plate was blocked with bovine serum albumin, freshly dissociated rat microglia were plated. After adhering for either 1 h (Fig. 1C, a) or 24 h (Fig. 1C, b), the number of microglia markedly increased in adherence to FN6–8 and FG domains and significantly reduced to EGFL domain, and there was no significant change to FN1–2 and FN3–5 domains compared with GST (Fig. 1B, a–f, and C). Moreover, different concentrations of EGFL and FN6–8 domains were applied to confirm their distinct roles in microglia adhesion. As shown in Fig. 1C, c, either the adhesive effect induced by the FN6–8 domain or the anti-adhesive effect induced by the EGFL domain occurred in a dose-dependent manner.The Effects of Different TN-R Domains on Microglia Migration—Given that the distinct TN-R domains have different effects on microglia, next we investigated whether they could also play distinct roles in microglia migration. Transwell assay was conducted to examine the ability of microglia migrating onto undersurfaces precoated with TN-R different domains as well as GST as control. Under same condition, the number of migrating microglia was significantly increased by both FN6–8 and FG domains and inhibited pronouncedly by the EGFL domain, and there was no changes by the FN1–2 and FN3–5 domains compared with GST (Fig. 2A, a–g, and B). Notably, the effect exerted by either the FN6–8 or the EGFL domain occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the results from adhesion assay, these observations further indicate that distinct TN-R domains play different roles in the microglia migration.Fig. 2The effect of different TN-R domains on microglia migration. The transwell membrane undersurface was coated with different TN-R domains. In A, a, PBS; b, GST; c, EGFL; d, FN1–2; e, FN3–5; f, FN6–8; g, FG. Relative numbers of cells transmigrating through membrane were determined by staining cells on the undersurface of the transwell membrane with crystal violet followed by cell lysis and measurement of absorbance value at 570 nm. Dye levels were directly proportional to numbers of microglia (B and C). Data were presented as mean ± S.E. **, p < 0.01 compared with control group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Protein Kinase A Is Involved in the EGFL Domain Induced Microglia Anti-adhesion—To explore the signaling pathway involved in the EGFL related microglia anti-adhesion, various phosphatase inhibitors and kinase inhibitors were applied in the microglia adhesion assay. As shown in Fig. 3A, the number of microglia on the coated EGFL spots was increased significantly by either erbstatin, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or H7, a protein kinase A inhibitor, but not by calphostin C, a protein kinase C inhibitor, and okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor (Fig. 3A, a), implicating that protein kinase A may be involved in the EGFL domain induced microglia anti-adhesion. This notion was further supported by the observations that the number of microglia on the EGFL coated spots was increased by H7 (Fig. 3A, b) and decreased by dbcAMP (Fig. 3A, c), a protein kinase A activator, in a dose-dependent manner.Fig. 3Signaling pathways involved in modulating microglia functions induced by TN-R domains. A, protein kinase A involved in the EGFL induced microglia anti-adhesion. Microglia adhesion assay was performed in the presence of various kinase inhibitors (100 μm erbstatin, 100 μm H7, 100 nm calphostin C) and phosphatase inhibitor (1 nm okadaic acid) on the coated EGFL domain (a). The influence of different concentrations of H7 (b) and dbcAMP (c) on EGFL induced microglia anti-adhesion is shown. B, protein kinase C involved in the FN6–8 induced microglia adhesion. Microglia adhesion assay was performed in the presence of various kinase inhibitors (100 μm erbstatin, 100 μm H7, 100 nm calphostin C) and phosphatase inhibitor (1 nm okadaic acid) on the coated FG6–8 domain (a). The influence of different concentrations of calphostin C (b) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (c) on FN6–8 induced microglia adhesion. Me2SO and GST were used as controls. All data points were expressed as cell numbers per visual field and represent the mean ± S.E. of three experiments. *, p < 0.05 compared with the GST group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Protein Kinase C Is Involved in the FN6–8 Domain Induced Microglia Adhesion—Next we investigated the signaling pathway involved in the FN6–8 induced microglia adhesion. As shown in Fig. 3B, a, the number of the microglia on the coated FN6–8 domain was significantly decreased by calphostin C but not by okadaic acid, erbstatin, and H7. Further, the FN6–8 domain induced microglia adhesion was either decreased by calphostin C (Fig. 3B, b) or enhanced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Fig. 3B, c), a protein kinase C activator in a dose-dependent manner. These observations imply that protein kinase C may involve in the FN6–8 domain induced microglia adhesion.Both EGFL and FN6–8 Domains Stimulated Microglia to Display Distinct Cytokine Expression Patterns—In light that different domains of TN-R have different functions on microglia adhesion and migration, especially EGFL and FN6–8 domain, next we examined whether EGFL and FN6–8 have a different effect on microglia in respect to cytokines secreted by microglia. Surprisingly, the cytokines secreted by microglia treated by EGFL and FN6–8 displayed a distinct expression pattern in which chemokine-induced cytokine 3 and tumor neurosis factor-α were significantly up-regulated after both EGFL and FN6–8 triggered microglia, but chemokine-induced cytokine-2 was obviously up-regulated in respect to FN6–8 stimulation compared with PBS as control (Fig. 4, A and B). These observations imply that TN-R may play one unique role in neuroprotection via microglia although its distinct domains can trigger different pathways in microglia.Fig. 4Detection of cytokine and growth factor expression from microglia conditioned medium induced by EGFL and FN6–8 domains. A, cytokine array patterns of microglia conditioned medium induced by PBS, GST, EGFL, and FN6–8. B, cytokine arrays were scanned, and the intensities of signals were quantitated by densitometry. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. **, p < 0.01 compared with the control group. C, rat cytokine array layout. D, the dot blots show the profile of growth factor expression by microglia triggered by either EGFL or FN6–8 domains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Both EGFL and FN6–8 Domains Triggered Microglia to Express Distinct Growth Factors—To determinate which growth factors released from microglia were stimulated by TN-R, we performed dot blots to detect microglia conditioned medium using antibodies against basic fibroblast growth factor, nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, TGF-β, and neurotrophin-3. As shown in Fig. 4D, TGF-β was secreted by microglia stimulated by either EGFL or FN6–8 domain. Interestingly, nerve growth factor secretion was triggered by FN6–8 domain, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor secretion was induced by EGFL domain. The function of secretion of the nerve growth factor/TGF-β and brain-derived neurotrophic factor/TGF-β pairs may be to synergize in neuroprotection. Because the effects of the EGFL domains and FN6–8 domains on growth factor secretion was similar in contrast to their effects on adhesion/migration, the results suggest that TN-R plays a unique role in neuroprotection.Both EGFL and FN6–8 Domain-activated Microglia Promote Neurite Outgrowth—To support the notion that TN-R-activated microglia play one unique role in neuroprotection, we further investigated whether microglia conditioned medium triggered by both EGFL and FN6–8 have a similar effect on neurite outgrowth. Microglia-conditioned media induced by PBS, GST, EGFL, and FN6–8 were added into the culture media of both NIE-115 cells and primary cortical neuron. Interestingly, both EGFL and FN6–8-treated microglia conditioned media significantly increased the total neurite length of either N1E-115 cells (Fig. 5, A and B, a) or primary cortical neurons (Fig. 5, A and B, c) compared with control (PBS). These two conditioned media also significantly increased the number of cells with neurites of the NIE-115 cells (Fig. 5, A and B, b) but not of primary cortical neurons (Fig. 5, A and B, d). These results further incriminate that TN-R may plays a role in neuroprotection via its distinct domains coordinately modulating the microglia function.Fig. 5Effects of the microglia activated by EGFL and FN6–8 domains on neurite outgrowth. The microglia conditioned medium induced by EGFL and FN6–8 domains affect the neurite outgrowth of N1E-115 cells and primary cortical neuron.

B, statistical assessment of the number of N1E-115 cells (B, b) and primary cortical neurons (B, d) with neurite.

Data are presented as mean ± S.E. **, p < 0.01 compared with control group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONProliferation of microglia cells is one of the hallmarks of central nervous system responses to neural injury. These responses are likely to play important roles in neuronal survival and functional recovery after the central nervous system injury. Here, we have shown that TN-R plays a role in neuroprotection via the coordination of its distinct domains in modulating the microglia (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Schematic diagram of TN-R domains modulating the microglia function. Shown is the EGFL domain inhibited microglia adhesion and migration via the protein kinase A signaling pathway. However, the FN6–8 domain promoted microglia adhesion and migration via the protein kinase C signaling pathway. Both EGFL and FN6–8 domains triggered microglia and displayed the same functions in inducing the cytokine secretion of microglia and promoting neurite outgrowth.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Role of TN-R Domains in Modulating Microglia Migration and Adhesion—Given that TN-R is a glia-derived molecule with multiple domains in the central nervous system, we have identified distinct TN-R domains that confer different effects on neuronal cell functions such as neuronal cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth, and modulation of sodium channels (13Xiao Z.C. Taylor J. Montag D. Rougon G. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 766-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Xiao Z.C. Ragsdale D. Malhotra J.D. Mattei L.N. Schachner M. Braun P. Isom L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 272: 32092-32101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, it had been found that TN-R also plays a role in neuroprotection via microglia (3Angelov D.N. Walther M. Streppel M. Guntinas-Lichius O. Neiss W.F. Probstmeier R. Pesheva P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6218-6229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown that the EGFL domain inhibits cell adhesion in a protein kinase A-dependent manner. In contrast, the FN6–8 domain stimulates cell adhesion in a protein kinase C-dependent manner. In addition EGFL inhibits whereas FN6–8 stimulates microglia migration. These observations suggest that the distinct TN-R domains may coordinate effects on adhesion/migration via interacting with different receptors on the microglia cell surface.Role of TN-R Domains in Neuroprotection—Microglia cells have been generally considered as aggressive cells, capable of inducing neuronal and oligodendroglial damage through their secretory products, such as nitrogen and oxygen radicals, inflammatory cytokines, glutamate, and other excitotoxins. However, activated microglia are bifunctional (beneficial or harmful) in response to neuropathological conditions (20Giulian D. Vaca K. Corpuz M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 29-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hamilton S.P. Leonard H.R. Glia. 1994; 11: 326-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is unclear how the ECM molecules, such as TN-R, modulate microglia in the central nervous system environment. In the present study, we have found both EGFL and the FN6–8 domain activated microglia display a similar cytokine and growth factor secretion pattern. TN-R domains EGFL and FN6–8 induced microglia to release brain-derived neurotrophic factor/TGF-β and nerve growth factor/TGF-β, respectively. Furthermore, conditioned medium derived from EGFL and FN 6–8 activated microglia promotes neurite outgrowth in both N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells and primary rat cortical neurons. Altogether, these observations support the notion that TN-R may play a unique role in neuroprotection via modulating microglia (Fig. 6) in addition to its direct effects on neuronal cells (13Xiao Z.C. Taylor J. Montag D. Rougon G. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 766-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These data may help to develop novel strategies to regulate the regenerative state and remodeling of the brain by targeting beneficial microglia responses. Microglia are recognized as one of main players in the response to brain and spinal cord injury because these cells are rapidly activated in response to even minor pathological changes in the central nervous system (1Kreutzberg G.W.

We have primarily used immunoprecipitation strategies to investigate whether connexin43 binds to selected signaling and cytoskeletal proteins and whether connexin43-protein binding is altered in cultured astrocytes exposed to chemical ischemia/hypoxia, a treatment that resembles ischemia in vivo. Chemical ischemia/hypoxia induced marked dephosphorylation of connexin43, which was accompanied by increased association of connexin43 with c-Src, ERK1/2, and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 and by decreased association between connexin43 and β-actin. Moreover, we found that endogenous c-Src in normal astrocytes exists primarily in the Triton X-100-soluble membrane fraction, distinct from the Triton-insoluble fraction, which contains gap junctions. After chemical ischemia/hypoxia, c-Src appeared in the Triton-insoluble fraction and was co-immunoprecipitated with connexin43, suggesting that chemical ischemia/hypoxia induced translocation of c-Src to the Triton-insoluble fraction and association with connexin43. Furthermore, the “dephosphorylated” form of connexin43 was immunoprecipitated by a phosphotyrosine antibody, suggesting tyrosine phosphorylation of connexin43 by c-Src. In addition, the association between connexin43 and c-Src was blocked by inhibition of connexin43 dephosphorylation, suggesting that the interaction between connexin43 and c-Src can be regulated by alterations in the phosphorylation state of connexin43. These results identify new binding partners for connexin43 and demonstrate that interactions between connexin43 and protein kinases and phosphatases are dynamically altered as a consequence of connexin43 phosphorylation.

Gap junctions in vertebrates are intercellular channels formed by proteins termed connexins and are permeable to second messenger molecules, metabolites, and ions. Connexin expression and gap junctional intercellular communication are critical for the regulation of cell locomotion, proliferation, and survival (1Li W.E.I. Waldo K. Linask K.L. Chen T. Wessels A.

Phosphorylation is the primary form of posttranslational modification of Cx43, and alterations in Cx43 phosphorylation state have been correlated with changes in the strength of gap junctional coupling (7Crow D.S.

Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1171-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Moreover, the regulation of gap junctional coupling by altering phosphorylation state of Cx43 is tissue- and kinase-specific (11Lampe P.D. Lau A.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1171-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 12Bruzzone R. White T.W. Paul D.L. Eur. J.

To date, phosphorylation sites of Cx43 for several protein kinases have been mapped, and a relationship between phosphorylation of these sites and gap junctional coupling state is being established (11Lampe P.D. Lau A.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1171-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Thus, it is important and timely to investigate the nature of protein kinases and phosphatases interacting with Cx43 under particular physiological and pathological conditions. The Src family kinases were among the first protein kinases known to interact with Cx43 and to regulate gap junctional coupling. For instance, v-Src expression in mammalian cells can induce phosphorylation at Tyr-247 and Tyr-265 of Cx43 and subsequent inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication, which has been proposed to underlie the transformation of mammalian cells transfected with Rous sarcoma virus (11Lampe P.D. Lau A.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1171-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 14Warn-Cramer B.J. Lau A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1662: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). v-Src has also been shown to bind directly to Cx43 and to induce tyrosine phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo (11Lampe P.D. Lau A.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1171-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 14Warn-Cramer B.J. Lau A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1662: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). c-Src, the cellular homolog of v-Src, is believed to interact with Cx43 in a similar manner. For example, reagents such as lysophosphatidic acid and thrombin that are known to activate c-Src signaling pathways and exogenous overexpression of wild-type c-Src have each been shown to cause tyrosine phosphorylation of Cx43 and a reduction of gap junctional coupling (15Postma F.R.

Moreover, exogenous wild-type c-Src has been shown to bind to endogenous Cx43 in cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts (16Toyofuku T. Akamatsu Y. Zhang H. Kuzuya T. Tada M. Hori M. J. Biol.

However, it has been controversial whether endogenous c-Src interacts with endogenous Cx43 and whether such interaction regulates gap junctional coupling (13Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar, 16Toyofuku T. Akamatsu Y. Zhang H. Kuzuya T. Tada M. Hori M. J. Biol.

Carcinog. 1999; 25: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In a recent study we found that c-Src association with Cx43 was markedly increased in astrocytes when intracellular pH was reduced, suggesting that the interaction between Cx43 and c-Src is a regulated process that may occur during acidosis (19Duffy H.S. Ashton A.W. O'Donnell P. Coombs W. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Spray D.C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this model the intracellular acidosis was induced by a collapse of transmembrane potassium concentration gradient in the presence of nigericin. This is an intriguing finding since we previously reported that both ischemia, which causes intercellular acidosis, and increased extracellular potassium concentration can induce dephosphorylation of Cx43 in astrocytes (20Li W.E.I. Ochalski P.A. Hertzberg E.L. Nagy J.I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2444-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Nagy J.I. Li W.E.I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 4567-4572PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, increased association between Cx43 and c-Src during intracellular acidosis may be related to an alteration in the phosphorylation state of Cx43. In this study we tested this hypothesis in cultured cortical astrocytes, which express abundant Cx43 as their primary gap junction protein. Moreover, we and others have previously shown that dephosphorylation of Cx43 can be induced in rat astrocytes in vivo after ischemia and in vitro under the conditions described below (10Li W.E.I.

Primary Culture of Mouse Cortical Astrocytes and Induction of Acidosis and Chemical Ischemia/Hypoxia (CIH)—Primary cortical astrocytes were obtained from postnatal day 2 mouse pups as described (10Li W.E.I. Nagy J.I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2644-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, pups were sacrificed using isofluorane and decapitated, and brains were removed from the skull into cold phosphate-buffered saline solution. The cerebral cortices were dissected, cleared from leptomeninges, chopped into 0.5-mm3 pieces, digested in 0.25% trypsin solution for 30 min at 37 °C, triturated using flame-polished Pasteur pipettes, and centrifuged at 1200 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was removed, the pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and cells were plated into 100-mm plastic Petri dishes (Fisher) and allowed to grow for 24 h before the culture medium was changed. All cultured cells were maintained in this medium, which was changed three times a week. In contrast to cultured rat astrocytes, mouse astrocytes prepared with this protocol were virtually free of microglia and oligodendrocytes based on the appearance and immunostaining using the glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody (more than 95% positive, not shown). Astrocytes cultured for 3–4 weeks and passaged twice were used for this study. Intracellular acidosis and CIH were induced according to protocols described previously (10Li W.E.I. Nagy J.I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2644-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19Duffy H.S. Ashton A.W. O'Donnell P. Coombs W. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Spray D.C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, intracellular acidosis of astrocytes was induced by 30 min of incubation in a 145 mm KCl solution containing 10 μm nigericin at pH 7.4, 7.1, 6.8, and 6.5. For induction of CIH, astrocytes were incubated for 30 min in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.3 mm sodium iodoacetate and 1 mm sodium cyanide at 37 °C. Scrape Loading of Lucifer Yellow—The gap junctional coupling between astrocytes was determined using scrape loading of Lucifer yellow in confluent astrocytes according to the protocol described (15Postma F.R. Hengeveld T. Alblas J. Giepmans B.N. Zondag G.C. Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1199-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19Duffy H.S. Ashton A.W. O'Donnell P. Coombs W. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Spray D.C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, a straight incision was made in astrocytes in the presence of divalent cation-free phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Lucifer yellow. After 2 min, Lucifer yellow solution was removed from the culture, which was subsequently washed in regular phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The distance of spread of Lucifer yellow from the incision to neighboring cells was measured and analyzed using the Scion Image software. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—All procedures were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise noted. Cultured astrocytes were harvested into a RIPA buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm sodium deoxycholate, protease inhibitors (P-8340, Sigma), 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (pH 7.4). The cell suspension was subsequently sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined using a Pierce BCA kit to ensure that very similar amounts of protein samples were loaded for Western blotting analysis or for immunoprecipitation (IP). Moreover, the equivalency of protein loading in Western blots using whole cell lysates was further confirmed by Western blots of GAPDH using a monoclonal antibody against GAPDH (RD1-TRK5G4–6C5, Research Diagnostics Inc., shown in Fig. 1, A2). About 10% of sample was used for direct Western blotting analysis to determine the general profile of protein expression and the phosphorylation state of Cx43. The rest was used for protein co-IP studies. For protein co-IP, astrocyte lysates were preincubated with 40 μl of recombinant protein G-agarose (15920-010, Invitrogen) for 30 min and centrifuged briefly to get rid of agarose beads. The supernatant was incubated with corresponding IP antibody overnight before a 1-h incubation with fresh agarose beads. This IP mixture was centrifuged, supernatant was removed, and the immunocomplex on agarose beads was washed six times using RIPA buffer before the addition of Laemmli sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205112) Google Scholar). Finally, samples were boiled for 5 min, loaded into pre-cast gels (Bio-Rad) for protein electrophoresis on a mini-protean III system (Bio-Rad), and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Ten percent precast gels were used except when Western blotting was conducted for c-Src from Cx43 IP samples, in which 7.5% precast gels were used to enhance the separation between Src and IgG heavy chain bands. Western blotting was conducted according to a protocol described previously (10Li W.E.I. Nagy J.I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2644-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk for an hour before the overnight incubation with a primary antibody and subsequent horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The membranes were washed and incubated for 1 min in an ECL solution (Amersham Biosciences) before x-ray film exposure and development. Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble Fractionation—Confluent cultures of astrocytes were harvested in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (Cellgro) containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors including sodium fluoride and sodium orthovanadate, sonicated, and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 15 min to obtain membrane-enriched pellet, which was subsequently resuspended by sonication in a RIPA buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. The samples were incubated for 30 min on ice and centrifuged for 30 min at 12,500 × g. The supernatant was collected and subjected to further centrifugation at 100,000 × g using a Ti-70 rotor in a Beckman ultracentrifuge for 50 min. The Triton-soluble supernatant was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube, whereas the Triton-insoluble pellet was rinsed three times using RIPA buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and resuspended in the RIPA containing Nonidet P-40 and sodium deoxycholate by sonication. Ten percent of these two fractions was directly used for normal Western blotting analysis, and the rest was subjected to c-Src IP using the protocol described above. Immunofluorescence Staining—The immunostaining protocol was as described previously (10Li W.E.I. Nagy J.I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2644-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Primary astrocytes were plated on glass coverslips (Fisher) and allowed to grow to confluence before treatment to induce CIH. After CIH, cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using 0.3% Triton X-100 and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with either Alexa488 or Alexa594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Immunofluorescence images were acquired using a Nikon fluorescence microscope equipped with a Spot CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc., Sterling Heights, MI) or an Olympus FluoView500 confocal system (Melville, NY). Statistics—Western blots were quantified by measuring the relative density of protein bands recognized by a particular antibody using Scion Image software (Frederick, MD). A comparison between the values of control (set at 1 unless otherwise specified) and CIH samples was made and analyzed using the Student's t test. p values ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant between two groups. Induction of Cx43 Dephosphorylation by Intracellular Acidification—Because it has been shown that intracellular acidosis can enhance the binding of c-Src to Cx43 (19Duffy H.S. Ashton A.W. O'Donnell P. Coombs W. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Spray D.C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we first used Western blotting to examine whether intracellular acidosis caused alterations in the phosphorylation state of Cx43. In non-stressed cells serine/threonine phosphorylation of Cx43 results in decreased mobility on SDS-PAGE and slower migrating bands usually appearing as a doublet that are commonly referred to as P1 and P2 (7Crow D.S.

The fastest migrating form is usually referred to as P0 and represents non-phosphorylated newly synthesized or dephosphorylated Cx43 (7Crow D.S. Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Kobe S.S. Lau A.F. Mol. Cell.

Only occasionally, a so-called P′ form has observed between P1 and P0 (21Nagy J.I. Li W.E.I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 4567-4572PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mikalsen S.O. Kaalhus O. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1994; 62: 2394-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In astrocytes, the majority of Cx43 protein is phosphorylated and migrates at about the 43-kDa level, whereas the non-phosphorylated or dephosphorylated form migrates at the 41-kDa level (10Li W.E.I. Nagy J.I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2644-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20Li W.E.I. Ochalski P.A. Hertzberg E.L. Nagy J.I. Eur. J.

Under certain experimental interventions, the 41-kDa band increases with a proportional loss in P2 and P1, and this has been used as indication of dephosphorylation of Cx43 at serine/threonine residues (7Crow D.S. Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Kobe S.S. Lau A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1754-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 10Li W.E.I. Nagy J.I. Eur. J.

In this study dephosphorylated Cx43 refers to the 41-kDa isoform of Cx43 that has reduced content of phosphate groups even though the exact phosphate content is not yet well defined. In cultured astrocytes this Cx43 isoform can be selectively recognized by antibody Zy13 (10Li W.E.I. Nagy J.I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2644-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, when astrocytes were subjected to 30-min treatments, causing graded reduction of intracellular pH from 7.4 to 6.5, there was a gradual reduction of the 43-kDa phosphorylated form and a concomitant increase of the 41-kDa non-phosphorylated form, suggesting that intracellular acidosis caused dephosphorylation of Cx43. Consistent with our previous finding, c-Src antibody did not pull down significant amounts of Cx43 when astrocytes were maintained at neutral pH (Fig. 1B, lane 1). However, an intense Cx43 band was detected when astrocytes were held at pH 6.5 for 30 min (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Surprisingly, this Cx43 band migrated at the 41-kDa level, corresponding to the dephosphorylated form of Cx43. Because the 41-kDa form of Cx43 is also present in neutral pH samples but is apparently not associated with c-Src, this result suggests that intracellular acidosis induced a selective binding of c-Src to dephosphorylated Cx43. In this experiment astrocytes were exposed to solutions containing 145 mm KCl and nigericin, which causes a total collapse of the transmembrane potassium concentration gradient, a condition rarely seen in living cells. Thus, we further examined the relationship between changes in Cx43 phosphorylation state and Cx43/c-Src binding in astrocytes using an in vitro ischemia model, CIH, in which cell metabolism is inhibited by the addition of iodoacetate and cyanide. We and others have previously reported that CIH causes massive dephosphorylation of Cx43 in rat astrocytes (10Li W.E.I. Nagy J.I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2644-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Cotrina M.L. Kang J. Lin J.H. Bueno E. Hansen T.W. He L. Liu Y. Nedergaard M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2520-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of Cx43 Dephosphorylation by CIH—Similar to what has been reported in rat astrocytes, 30 min CIH of mouse astrocytes caused changes in Cx43 mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). Anti-Cx43 antibody 18A revealed an evident shift of the phosphorylated forms to the dephosphorylated form (Fig. 2A, both lanes). An increase of the 41-kDa band was clearly detected using monoclonal antibody Zy13 (Fig. 2B, both lanes) that we had previously demonstrated to preferentially detect the dephosphorylated form of Cx43 (10Li W.E.I. Nagy J.I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2644-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20Li W.E.I. Ochalski P.A. Hertzberg E.L. Nagy J.I. Eur. J.

Doble B.W. Gilchrist J.S. Kardami E. Hertzberg E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This shift appeared to be an all-or-none event in that a reduction in the doublet of phosphorylated forms was accompanied by an increase only in the 41-kDa dephosphorylated form without the appearance of any new Cx43 isoforms such as P′ between the phosphorylated doublet and the non-phosphorylated form (21Nagy J.I. Li W.E.I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 4567-4572PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hossain M.Z. Murphy L.J. Hertzberg E.L. Nagy J.I. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 2394-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining of Cx43 indicated that CIH treatment induced a reduction of Cx43 recognition by the polyclonal antibody 18A (compare C2 with C1) in mouse astrocytes, which is similar to results reported previously in rat astrocytes (10Li W.E.I. Nagy J.I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2644-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that very little immunostaining was produced with antibody Zy13 in control astrocytes and that the marked increase in Cx43 immunostaining with this antibody after CIH occurred predominantly at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, C4), suggesting that the CIH-induced dephosphorylation occurred mainly at sites where Cx43 formed gap junctions between astrocytes rather than in cytoplasmic locations. This change in phosphorylation coincided with a reduction of gap junctional coupling in CIH-treated astrocytes (Fig. 2D). Association of Cx43 with c-Src—To determine whether CIH also"
https://openalex.org/W2038216476,"To avoid detection and targeting by the immune system, the plague-causing bacterium Yersinia pestis uses a type III secretion system to deliver a set of inhibitory proteins into the cytoplasm of immune cells. One of these proteins is an exceptionally active tyrosine phosphatase termed YopH, which paralyzes lymphocytes and macrophages by dephosphorylating critical tyrosine kinases and signal transduction molecules. Because Y. pestis strains lacking YopH are avirulent, we set out to develop small molecule inhibitors for YopH. We used a novel and cost-effective approach, in which leads from a chemical library screening were analyzed and computationally docked into the crystal structure of YopH. This resulted in the identification of a series of novel YopH inhibitors with nanomolar Ki values, as well as the structural basis for inhibition. Our inhibitors lack the polar phosphate-mimicking moiety of rationally designed tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors, and they readily entered live cells and rescued them from YopH-induced tyrosine dephosphorylation, signaling paralysis, and cell death. These inhibitors may become useful for treating the lethal infection by Y. pestis.

These inhibitors may become useful for treating the lethal infection by Y. pestis. To survive in humans, pathogenic bacteria have evolved numerous mechanisms to evade the immune response in the host (1Ernst J.D. Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2DeVinney I. Steele-Mortimer I. Finlay B.B. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 29-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). One of the most successful strategies was adopted by Yersinia pestis, namely a type III secretion system that injects a set of paralyzing proteins directly into the cytoplasm of macrophages and lymphocytes that the bacterium encounters in the lymph nodes of infected individuals (3Persson C. Nordfelth R. Holmstrom A. Hakansson S. Rosqvist R. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 4Cheng L.W. Schneewind O. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3183-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As a result, the targeted cells become unable to respond, and the bacteria can multiply unopposed by the normal mechanisms of host defense.The natural route of Y. pestis infection is by transmission from infected rats or other animals by blood-sucking fleas, which are weakened by the bacteria in their gut and therefore expel bacterial mass into the epidermis of their next victim when trying to feed (5Titball R.W. Leary S.E. Br. Med. Bull. 1998; 54: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6Hinnebusch B.J. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). From these flea bites, the bacteria travel to local lymph nodes (7Autenrieth I.B. Vogel U. Preger S. Heymer B. Heesemann J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2585-2595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Autenrieth I.B. Hantschmann P. Heymer B. Heesemann J. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Autenrieth I.B. Firsching R. J. Med. Microbiol. 1996; 44: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), where they multiply and cause a massive lymphadenitis within 2–6 days (5Titball R.W. Leary S.E. Br. Med. Bull. 1998; 54: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These enlarged and painful lymph nodes, or “bubos,” give the disease its common name Bubonic Plague. Unless treated with high dose streptomycin- or tetracycline-type antibiotics during the first few days, the infection develops into a toxemic sepsis, which is often fatal (5Titball R.W. Leary S.E. Br. Med. Bull. 1998; 54: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6Hinnebusch B.J. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A normally very rare, but much more rapidly lethal, form of the infection is caused by inhaled bacteria and is referred to as pneumonic plague or plague pneumonia (10Cleri D.J. Vernaleo J.R. Lombardi L.J. Rabbat M.S. Mathew A. Marton R. Reyelt M.C. Semin. Respir. Infect. 1997; 12: 12-23PubMed Google Scholar). By this route of infection, the number of bacteria entering the body can be much larger than from microscopic flea bites, and the bacteria are efficiently disseminated to the peritracheal, mediastinal, and other central lymph nodes, from which they gain access to the bloodstream much earlier. Although several vaccines exist (11Titball R.W. Williamson E.D. Vaccine. 2001; 19: 4175-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Friedlander A.M. Welkos S.L. Worsham P.L. Andrews G.P. Heath D.G. Anderson Jr., G.W. Pitt M.L. Estep J. Davis K. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1995; 21: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and Yersinia usually is sensitive to antibiotics, the pneumonic form of the disease is difficult to diagnose and still often results in death (10Cleri D.J. Vernaleo J.R. Lombardi L.J. Rabbat M.S. Mathew A. Marton R. Reyelt M.C. Semin. Respir. Infect. 1997; 12: 12-23PubMed Google Scholar).Despite efforts to eradicate the disease, natural reservoirs of Y. pestis still exist in wild rats and other rodent populations in parts of Africa, southeast Asia, and southwestern United States (13Christie A.B. Ecol. Dis. 1982; 1: 111-115PubMed Google Scholar), and sporadic human cases of plague still occur every year. Although these cases pale by comparison to the devastating pandemics that killed an estimated 200 million people, mostly in Europe, during historical times (5Titball R.W. Leary S.E. Br. Med. Bull. 1998; 54: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6Hinnebusch B.J. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the World Health Organization now recognizes plague as a reemerging public health concern. There are also increasing fears that Y. pestis may be used for biological warfare or bioterrorism (14McGovern T.W. Christopher G.W. Eitzen E.M. Arch. Dermatol. 1999; 135: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Inglesby T.V. Dennis D.T. Henderson D.A. Bartlett J.G. Ascher M.S. Eitzen E. Fine A.D. Friedlander A.M. Hauer J. Koerner J.F.

The potential threat is heightened by the existence of multidrug-resistant strains of Y. pestis (17Galimand M. Guiyoule A. Gerbaud G. Rasoamanana B. Chanteau S. Carniel E. Courvalin P. N. Engl. J.

Clearly, new approaches to combat plague are urgently needed.The molecular mechanisms employed by all virulent strains of Y. pestis and the two related species, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica, are based on an extrachromosomal virulence plasmid (19Cornelis G.R. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), which encodes a type III secretion system and several effector proteins called Yops (Yersinia outer membrane proteins) (20Cornelis G.R.

The type III secretion system is a highly conserved macromolecular machinery found in many pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria and is induced by contact with a eukaryotic cell to inject effector Yops into the cytoplasm of the target cells (21Juris S.J. Shao F. Dixon J.E. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the host cell, the Yops disrupt signaling cascades responsible for initiating key immune functions, such as phagocytosis (22Black D.S. Bliska J.B.

Because this kinase is the first upstream signal-generating molecule for the T cell antigen receptor, signaling from this receptor was completely abrogated. As a consequence, all tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins was inhibited; the T cells failed to form immune synapses with antigen-presenting cells, and they were unable to secrete any interleukin-2 into the medium (39Alonso A.

Similarly, T cells exposed to live Y. enterocolitica became unable to flux calcium and produce cytokines (40Sauvonnet N. Lambermont I. van der Bruggen P. Cornelis G.R. Mol.

We therefore set out to develop small molecule inhibitors of YopH by a combination of chemical library screening, structure-activity analysis, and in silico docking of lead compounds.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) was purchased from Sigma. BIOMOL GREEN™ reagent was from BIOMOL Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest grade available commercially. Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.

Recombinant CD45, PTP1B, and LAR were purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories.Chemical Library Screening for YopH Inhibitors—A subset of 10,000 compounds from the DIVERSet™ library of 50,000 drug-like molecules (ChemBridge, Inc.) was screened in a 96-well format in vitro assay. Each reaction contained 50 nm YopH, 1 mmpNPP, and 0.03 mg/ml compound in 0.1 m BisTris, pH 6.0, reaction buffer. The final volume amounted to 50 μl and contained 2% Me2SO. The reaction was initiated by addition of pNPP after a preincubation of the enzyme with the compounds for 10 min at room temperature. After 7 min, the reaction was quenched by addition of 100 μl of BIOMOL GREEN™ reagent, and the pNPP hydrolysis was determined by measuring the absorbance of the complexed free phosphate at 620 nm. The nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by measuring the control without addition of enzyme. To quantitate the inhibitory efficacy of the library compounds, we determined the ratio of inhibition in comparison to 200 μm orthovanadate, a PTP inhibitor. Every compound with a ratio of >1 was considered as a hit. ClogP for each compound was calculated with ChemDraw8.Ki Determination—The YopH PTP-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP in the presence of inhibitors was assayed at 30 °C in 0.1 m BisTris, pH 6.0, assay buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 5% Me2SO. The ionic strength was adjusted to 150 mm with NaCl. The enzyme was preincubated with various fixed concentrations of inhibitors for 10 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of various concentrations of pNPP (ranging from 0.2 to 10 Km) to the reaction mixtures to a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction was quenched by addition of 100 μl of 1 m NaOH. The nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by measuring the control without addition of enzyme. The amount of product p-nitrophenol was determined from the absorbance at 405 nm detected by a PowerWaveX340 microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.) using a molar extinction coefficient of 18,000 m-1 cm-1. The inhibition constant and inhibition pattern were evaluated by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equations for either competitive (Equation 1), uncompetitive (Equation 2), or mixed (Equation 3) inhibition, using nonlinear regression and the program GraphPad Prism® (version 4.0).v0=Vmax[S]/(Km(app)+[S]) with Km(app)=Km(1+[I]/Ki) (Eq. 1) v0=Vmax[S]/(Km+(1+[I]/Ki)[S]) with Km(app)=Km/(1+[I]/Ki)(Eq. 2) v0=Vmax[S]/((1+[I]/Kic)Km+(1+[I]/Kiu)[S]) with Km(app)=Km(1+[I]/Kic)/(1+[I]/Kiu)(Eq. 3) In the case of the mixed inhibition model, Kic is the inhibition constant for the competitive participation, and Kiu is the inhibition constant for the uncompetitive participation. For a comparison of the fitting results, the second-order Akaike's Information Criterion (AICc) was calculated with Equation 4, where N is the number of data points, SS the absolute sum of squares, and K the number of parameters fit by nonlinear regression plus 1.AICc=Nln(SS/N)+2K+(2K(K+1))/(N−K−1)(Eq. 4) The probability to have chosen the right model can be computed by Equation 5, where Δ is the difference between Akaike's Information Criterion (AICc) scores.probability=exp(−0.5Δ)/(1+exp(−0.5Δ))(Eq. 5) IC50 Measurements—The PTP-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP in the presence of inhibitor was assayed at 30 °C in a 100-μl reaction system in the same assay buffer described above. At various concentrations of the compound, the initial rate at fixed pNPP concentrations (equal to the corresponding Km values for each PTP) was measured by determining the free phosphate with the BIOMOL GREEN™ reagent, as described above. The IC50 value was determined by plotting the relative pNPP activity versus inhibitor concentration and fitting to Equation 6 using GraphPad Prism®.Vi/V0=IC50/(IC50+[I])(Eq. 6) In this case, Vi is the reaction velocity when the inhibitor concentration is [I]; V0 is the reaction velocity with no inhibitor, and IC50 = Ki + Ki[S]/Km.Molecular Modeling—Molecular modeling studies were conducted on several R12000 SGI Octane workstations with the software package Sybyl version 6.9 (TRIPOS). Energy-minimized molecular models of the compounds were generated by the Sybyl/MAXIMIN2 routine. Flexible ligand docking calculations were performed with FlexX as implemented in Sybyl. For each compound, 20 solutions were generated and rank-ordered via FlexX score and CSCORE. In all cases, there was a high degree of convergence for the salicylic acid-furanyl moiety and more variability in the position of the remaining molecules. The coordinates of three-dimensional structure of catalytic domain of YopH (Protein Data Bank codes 1YTS and 1QZ0) were used in the docking studies, and the binding pocket was defined as composed of the following amino acid residues: Arg-205, Arg-228, Phe-229, Ile-232, Asn-245, Ala-258, Cys-259, Gln-260, Tyr-261, Val-284, Leu-285, Ala-286, Ser-287, Glu-290, Ile-291, Phe-296, Met-298, Val-351, Trp-354, Pro-355, Asp-356, Gln-357, Thr-358, Ala-359, Val-360, Ile-401, His-402, Ser-403 (Cys-403 in wild-type YopH), Arg-404, Ala-405, Gly-406, Val-407, Gly-408, Arg-409, Thr-410, Ala-411, Gln-412, Leu-413, Ile-414, Arg-440, Asn-441, Ile-443, Met-444, Val-445, Gln-446, Lys-447, and Gln-450. Molecular surfaces were generated with MOLCAD as implemented in Sybyl. Comparisons with other PTPs were made by using the x-ray coordinates for PTP1B (Protein Data Bank code 1PA1), VHR (Protein Data Bank code 1VHR), and bovine LMPTPB (1DG9) and the computer models of the membrane-proximal domains of CD45, VHX, and HePTP. These were generated as described (50Alonso A. Sasin J. Bottini N. Friedberg I. Friedberg I. Osterman A. Godzik A. Hunter T. Dixon J.E. Mustelin T.

Monocytes/macrophages were eliminated by adherence to plastic for 1 h at 37 °C. Jurkat T leukemia cells were kept at logarithmic growth in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin G and streptomycin. For T cell receptor- and CD28-induced tyrosine phosphorylation responses, normal T lymphocytes were incubated in ice for 15 min with 10 μg/ml OKT3 and anti-CD28 mAbs, washed, and incubated with a cross-linking rabbit anti-mouse Ig for 15 min, washed, and transferred to 37 °C for 5 min. Cells were pelleted and lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. Lysate was mixed with an equal volume of twice concentrated SDS sample buffer, boiled for 1 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE.SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—These procedures were done as before (39Alonso A.

Results are given as pg/ml of secreted interleukin-2/2 × 105 cells.RESULTSIdentification of Lead Compounds by Chemical Library Screening—A 96-well format in vitro assay was used to screen the first 10,000 compounds of the DIVERSet™ library (ChemBridge, Inc.) of drug-like compounds. A total of 10 compounds inhibited YopH to a higher extent than 200 μm orthovanadate, a general PTP inhibitor. After determination of the kinetic parameters of these 10 first hits, we selected four compounds, which were showing a competitive or mixed inhibition pattern with a Ki value <10 μm, for closer inspection. Two of these, a quinone and a charged thio-imidazole, were subsequently discarded, and we focused on a 5-methylenethiazolidine-2,4-dione linked via a furanyl ring to a salicylic acid (compound 1) and a 5-methylene-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one (additionally substituted at the nitrogen atom) similarly linked via a furanyl ring to a nitrophenol (compound 2). These two inhibited YopH with competitive Ki values of 0.311 ± 0.053 and 1.87 ± 0.924 μm, respectively, and were relatively selective for YopH (Table I). The structures of compounds 1 and 2 are shown in Table II. These two represent our initial hits from the chemical library screen.Table ISelectivity of initial hit compounds 1 and 2Compound 1 IC50Compound 2 IC50Compound 1-fold IC50Compound 2-fold IC50μmμmYopH0.393.911CD458.6392210PTP 1B12393110VHX1020265.1VHR28497213HePTP>100>100>256>26LMPTP B>100>100>256>26VH1>100>100>256>26LAR>100>100>256>26 Open table in a new tab Table IIKinetic data of 2 initial hits and 21 representative analogs Open table in a new tab Structure-Activity Relationship Analysis of Compound 1 and 2—Encouraged by these findings, we investigated the structure-activity relationships for a total of 61 analogs that all contained a substituted phenyl ring linked via a furanyl moiety to a more diverse entity at the other end of the molecule, preferentially a 5-methylenethiazolidine ring. A total of 44 compounds inhibited YopH in a competitive manner with Ki values of <100 μm. The structures and kinetic data for a representative set of 21 analogs are given in Table II. Significantly, 13 of the 16 salicylic acid analogs were among the 26 best compounds (competitive inhibition with Ki values <10 μm). Elimination of the salicylic acid moiety (compound 23) led to a complete loss of YopH inhibition, whereas salicyl furyl aldehyde (compound 13) shows good competitive inhibition (Ki = 2.08 μm). However, salicylic acid alone was a poor inhibitor (Ki = 882 μm) compared with the most potent inhibitor, compound 3, which has a 6,211-fold lower inhibitory constant (Ki = 0.143 μm). The very similar compound 7, which only differs in the location of a single methyl group, shows almost 10 times less activity, suggesting some steric constraints for the putative binding site or some very specific interactions of that methyl group. A comparison of the Ki values for compounds 12 and 20, which differ by a methyl group in a very similar position, supports the latter.Another example of a unique binding mode is presented by the second best inhibitor, compound 4 (Ki = 0.208 μm). In this case, the structurally very similar compound 18 (Ki = 6.60 μm), in which the positions of the carboxylic and the hydroxyl groups have been switched, has a 32 times higher Ki value, supporting the notion of specific binding.Substitution of the hydroxyl group in the original hit compound 1 by a chlorine in compound 16 led to a 14.5 times less inhibitory activity.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the accumulation of CD19+/CD5+ B-lymphocytes primarily through a block in apoptosis. The mechanisms underlying this defect are not fully understood. We investigated whether LPA could be a survival factor in CLL cells. Herein, we demonstrate that LPA protects B-cell lines BJAB and I-83 and primary CLL cells but not normal B-cells from fludarabine- and etoposide-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, LPA prevented spontaneous apoptosis in primary CLL cells. The LPA1 expression was found to be increased in primary CLL cells compared with normal B-cells correlating with LPA prevention of apoptosis. Treatment of primary CLL cells with the LPA receptor antagonist, diacylglycerol pyrophosphate, reverses the protective effect of LPA against apoptosis, and down-regulation of the LPA1 by siRNA blocked LPA-mediated protection against spontaneous apoptosis in primary CLL cells. The protective effect of LPA was inhibited by blocking activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway. These results indicate that LPA is a survival factor in B-cell lines and primary CLL cells but not normal B-cells.

LPA also possesses a range of biological activities similar to growth factors. These include stimulation of cellular proliferation, platelet aggregation, smooth muscle cell contraction, and tumor cell invasion (3Mills G.B. Moolenaar W.H. Nat. Rev.

In addition, LPA protects ovarian cancer cells against chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis and prevents apoptosis in serum-deprived renal proximal tubular cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, T cells, and Schwann cells, indicating that like growth factors, LPA acts as a general survival factor (4Fang X.

The ability of LPA to act as a survival factor in B-cell malignancies is unknown. LPA promotes cell survival through receptor-mediated signaling pathways. LPA activates a serine threonine kinase AKT/PKB (AKT), leading to inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as BAD, or activation of transcription factors that increase the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (9Baudhuin L.M. Cristina K.L. Lu J. Xu Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 660-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Deng W. Wang D.A. Gosmanova E. Johnson L.R. Tigyi G. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G821-G829Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In ovarian cancer cell lines and HeLa cells, LPA protection against apoptosis is mediated by the AKT signaling pathway (11Frankel A. Mills G.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1307-1313PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, LPA protection against apoptosis in fibroblast cells is mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway (12Fang X. Yu S. Bast R.C. Liu S. Xu H.-J. Hu S.-X.

In addition, LPA activates transcription factors, such as NFκB, that can lead to increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and cell survival (13Palmetshofer A. Robson S.C. Nehls V. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1532-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Shahrestanifar M. Fan X. Manning D.R. J. Biol.

LPA is present in the plasma bound to albumin (2Swarthout J.T. Walling H.W. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1978-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Similar to LPA receptors, LPA levels are often increased in ascites and the plasma of ovarian cancer patients and in the plasma of patients with multiple myeloma (1Fang X. Schummer M. Mao M. Yu S. Tabassam F.H. Swaby R. Hasegawa Y. Tanyi J.L. LaPushin R. Eder A. Jaffe R. Erickson J. Mills G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 15Sasagawa T.

Ovarian cancer cells produce LPA in significant amounts compared with normal ovarian epithelial cells, which could explain the increased LPA in the ascitic fluid of ovarian cancer patients (16Xu Y. Fang X.J. Casey G. Mills G.B. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The elevated levels of LPA have been suggested to contribute to tumor invasiveness, proliferation, and resistance to apoptosis (3Mills G.B. Moolenaar W.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Four specific G protein-coupled receptors of LPA have been identified: LPA1 (Edg-2), LPA2 (Edg-4), LPA3 (Edg-7), and LPA4 (17Anliker B. Chun J. J. Biol.

In contrast, mice lacking LPA2 show no obvious phenotypic deficiencies, indicating a redundancy in LPA receptor functionality (18Fukushima N. Chun J. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2001; 64: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, LPA1 expression is increased in colon cancer cells, and LPA2 and LPA3 are elevated in ovarian cancer cells, suggesting that LPA receptors are involved in tumorigenesis (20Fang X.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of adult leukemia and is characterized by the accumulation of CD19+/CD5+ B-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid organs (22Bannerji R. Byrd J.C. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2000; 12: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Caligaris-Cappio F. Hamblin T.J. J. Clin.

Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, MD2003: 2429-2463Google Scholar). This is achieved primarily through a block in apoptosis. The increased cell survival is due in part to increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and the survival signals delivered by extracellular factors from “nurse-like,” fibroblast, stromal, or follicular dendritic cells (25Bernal A.

However, these survival responses cannot fully explain the accumulation of CLL cells, because CLL cells have varying levels of Bcl-2 family members and circulate without constant contact with survival-mediating cells. Indeed, CLL cells survive for a prolonged length of time in vitro in the presence of plasma from CLL patients, compared with CLL cells cultured in serum-free medium. Plasma albumin that binds to lipids has been shown to provide a survival signal to CLL cells by activating AKT, but the mechanism of this survival signal is not well understood (29Jones D.T. Ganeshaguru K. Anderson R.J. Jackson T.R. Bruckdorfer K.R. Low S.Y. Palmqvist L. Prentice H.G. Hoffbrand A.V. Mehta A.B. Wickremasinghe R.G. Blood. 2003; 101: 3174-3180Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Herein we have demonstrated for the first time that LPA protects primary CLL cells and BJAB (a B-cell Burkitt lymphoma) and I-83 (B-CLL-like) cell lines from spontaneous, fludarabine (Flu), chlorambucil (CLB), or etoposide (Et)-induced apoptosis. LPA1 is expressed at higher levels in primary CLL cells as compared with normal B-cells. Blocking LPA binding to its receptors with a selective antagonist (DGPP) or inhibiting LPA1 expression blocked the inhibiting effects of LPA on apoptosis. Finally, this protection against apoptosis is mediated by the PI-3K/AKT signaling pathway. These results indicate that LPA is a survival factor for primary CLL cells. Materials—LPA (18:1, 18:0, and 16:0) and DGPP were purchased from Avanti Inc. and dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumen. Unless otherwise stated 18:1 LPA was used in all experiments. Anti-phospho-AKT was purchased from Cell Signaling Inc. Anti-AKT antibodies and anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-LPA1 antibodies was purchased from Exalpha Biologicals Inc. Flu and Et were purchased from Sigma and dissolved in Me2SO. CLB was purchased from Sigma and dissolved in acidified ethanol containing 1% HCl. U0126 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and LY294002 was purchased from Sigma. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was purchased from Sigma. Patients and Lymphocyte Isolation—Peripheral blood samples were obtained from normal individuals and CLL patients following informed consent in agreement with the Research Ethics Board at the University of Manitoba. The diagnosis of CLL was made by peripheral blood morphology and immunophenotyping, and the cells were CD19+, CD5+, and CD23+. In total 25 patient samples were obtained from patients with an average age of 66 years and an average lymphocyte count of 81 × 109 cells/liter. There were 17 males and eight females. There were four patients at Rai stage 0, four patients at Rai stage I, seven patients at Rai stage II, four patients at Rai stage III, and six patients at Rai stage IV. Upon receiving the blood samples, mononuclear cells were isolated from the buffy coat using a Ficoll-Paque density gradient, as we have described previously (30Begleiter A. Verburg L. Ashique A. Lee K. Israels L.G. Mowat M.R. Johnston J.B. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 1875-1881PubMed Google Scholar). The plasma was removed and stored at -20 °C for future experiments. The cell isolates were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and a second wash with ice-cold 10 mm Tris, 140 mm NH4Cl to lyse residual erythrocytes. When the peripheral blood lymphocyte counts were <30 × 109/liter, contaminating monocytes were removed from the isolates using CD33 antibodies coupled to magnetic beads and T cells removed by sheep red cell rosetting, as described previously (30Begleiter A. Verburg L. Ashique A. Lee K. Israels L.G. Mowat M.R. Johnston J.B. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 1875-1881PubMed Google Scholar). This recovers B-cells only from either CLL patients or normal volunteers. Cell Culture and Treatment Conditions—Lymphocytes were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator at an initial density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free RPMI 1640 culture medium. BJAB and I-83 cells were also grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 units of penicillin, 100 μg streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. F-ara-A was used for these in vitro experiments, because Flu requires dephosphorylation to F-ara-A for activity, and this normally occurs rapidly in the plasma following clinical administration. For consistency, we will use the abbreviation Flu to denote F-ara-A treatment. The cells were incubated with or without Flu, CLB, or Et, in combination with varying concentrations of LPA. The cells were always incubated in serum-free conditions 24 h prior to treatment. Caspase Assay—The cells (1–2 × 106) were treated with 2.5 μm Flu, 10 μm LPA, or in combination. The cells were then lysed in caspase lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm leupectin, 10 μm pepstatin A, and 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 8000 × g for 5 min. 100 mg of protein was added to caspase reaction buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA) and 100 μm of the peptide Ac-DEVD-pNA (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). This was incubated at 37 °C in the dark for 4 h and read at 405-nm wavelength on a spectrophotometer. Reaction buffer and peptide without lysate was used as a control. Annexin V/7-AAD Staining—Cells (5 × 106) were collected in 5-ml tubes, centrifuged, and resuspended in 1× binding buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2), supplemented with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (BD PharMingen, Mississauga, ON) and 2.5 μg of 7-AAD (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After 15 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, an excess of 1× binding buffer was added to a final volume of 500 μl. The cells were then analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Acridine Orange/Ethidium Bromide Staining—The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of medium by gentle mixing and stained with a mixture of acridine orange (100 μg/ml) and ethidium bromide (100 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline. A cell suspension was then applied onto a microscope slide and covered with a coverslip, and the cells were viewed using a fluorescence microscope with a fluorescein filter set to quantitate condensed DNA in apoptotic cells. Random fields were scored, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined from cells containing normal DNA to cells with condensed DNA. At least 200 cells were counted for each condition tested. Statistical significance was determined using a t test method. Western Blot Analysis—The cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.25, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm ZnCl2,50 μm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 10% milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 solution. The blots were performed as described previously (31Gibson E.M. Henson E.S. Haney N. Villanueva J. Gibson S.B. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 488-496PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were stripped in 10% SDS buffer and reprobed for β-actin to normalize for protein loaded in each lane. Electroporation—BJAB cells were transferred to fresh medium 24 h prior to transfection. The cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in RPMI medium at 2.5 × 107 cells/ml. The cells were then put on ice for 10 min, and 5 μg of plasmid was added into the bottom of the electroporation cuvette (0.4-cm gap; Bio-Rad). BJAB cells (0.4 ml) were added to the cuvette, and the cuvette was placed on ice for 10 min. The cuvette was then placed into an electroporation device and electroporated at 310 V, 10-ms pulse length, and 1 pulse with no intervals. The cuvette was then placed on ice for 10 min. The electroporated cells were then transferred to 10 ml of RPMI (10% fetal bovine serum) medium. Transfection of Primary CLL Cells with siRNA—Primary CLL cells were suspended in 12-well plates at 8.0 × 105 cells/well. 2 μg of siRNA against LPA1 (5′-r(CCGCCGCUUCCAUUUUUCCU)d(TT)-3′ and 5′-r(AGGAAAAAUGGAAGCGGCGGG)d(TT)-3′) and scrambled siRNA (5′-r(UUCUCCGAACGUGUUCACGU)d(TT)-3′ and 5′-r(ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAA)d(TT)-3′) was diluted into 100 ml of medium. 12 μlof RNAiFect Transfection reagent (Qiagen) was added to the siRNA and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The formed complexes between the reagent and siRNA were then added dropwise to the cells. The cells were then incubated with the transfection complexes under normal tissue culture conditions overnight. The next day the medium was changed to serum-free medium, and the cells were then treated with 5 μm LPA. After 24 h, the amount of cell death was determined by annexin V staining as described above. Transfection of HEK293 Cells—The cells were grown to ∼50% confluency and transfected with 5 μg of cDNA for human LPA1 in pcDNA3 vector (kind gift from Dr. Frank Fang, Virginia Commonwealth University) containing a FLAG tag. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine as described in the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, the cells were treated with 100 μm Et for an additional 24 h. The cells were then cytospun and stained with antibodies against FLAG and Hoechst stain. The number of apoptotic cells was determined by chromatin condensation. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR for LPA1 mRNA—RT-PCR was performed using specific primers for human LPA1 (5′-CCACCTTCAGGCAGATCCTGTGT-3′ and 5′-AGGCAGAGCGGTCAGAGCCTT-3′). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers were used for equal loading of mRNA. Amplification was performed using SuperScript One-step RT-PCR (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thermal cycling was as follows: 30 min at 50 °C, 2 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 75 °C. One μg of RNA was used in the PCR. LPA Protects B-cell Lines from Chemotherapeutic Drug-induced Apoptosis—LPA has previously been shown to protect ovarian cancer cells from cisplatin- and taxol-induced apoptosis (11Frankel A. Mills G.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1307-1313PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fang X. Gaudette D. Furui T. Mao M. Estrella V. Eder A. Pustilnik T. Sasagawa T. Lapushin R. Yu S. Jaffe R.B. Wiener J.R. Erickson J.R. Mills G.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 188-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We investigated here whether LPA can protect leukemic B-cell lines from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. The Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, was treated with 2.5 μm Flu, 1.0 μm Et, or 2.5 μm CLB alone or with 10 μm LPA for 24 h. Et, Flu, and CLB induced 41, 45, and 45% apoptosis in BJAB cells, respectively (Fig. 1A). In combination with LPA, Et-induced apoptosis was reduced to 22%, Flu-induced apoptosis was reduced to 26%, and CLB-induced apoptosis was reduced to 19%. LPA alone did not affect cell survival (17% apoptotic cells; Fig. 1A). The CLL-like B-cell line, I-83, was also treated with Et, Flu, and CLB alone or in combination with LPA. Similar to BJAB cells, Et, Flu, and CLB induced 62, 47, and 34% apoptosis, respectively (Fig. 1A). In combination with LPA, Et-induced apoptosis was reduced to 48%, Flu-induced apoptosis was reduced to 34%, and CLB-induced apoptosis was reduced to 21%. In addition to B-cell lines, the Burkitt lymphoma T cell line, MOLT-4, was also protected by LPA from Flu-induced apoptosis; Flu induced 36% apoptosis, and this was reduced to 24% by LPA (Fig. 1B). These differences were statistically significant. Consistent with the survival promoting activity, LPA prevented Et-induced caspase 3-like activation in BJAB cells as detected by cleavage of the fluorescently labeled peptide in a caspase assay, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1C). Treatment of BJAB cells with 3.0 μm Et induced a 3-fold increase in caspase activity that was reduced to background by treatment with 1.0 μm LPA. To determine the amount of LPA required to protect B-cell lines from apoptosis, BJAB cells were treated with various concentrations (100 nm to 10 μm) of three forms of LPA (18:1, 18:0, and 16:0) in the presence or absence of 1.0 μm Et. The results indicate that as little as 100 nm LPA could protect BJAB cells from Et-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1D). LPA Protects Primary CLL Cells from Spontaneous and Fluinduced Apoptosis—Because LPA protects a CLL-like cell line (I-83) from apoptosis, we determined whether leukemic cells from CLL patients could also be protected from apoptosis by LPA. Primary CLL cells were treated with a range of LPA concentrations (0.1 μm to 10 μm), and the amount of spontaneous apoptosis was determined after 96 h. LPA protected CLL cells against spontaneous apoptosis at a concentration of 0.5 μm but failed to provide a protective effect at 0.1 μm (Fig. 2A). The protection at 0.5 μm was similar to the protective effect of 30% plasma isolated from CLL patients (Fig. 2A). This LPA concentration is similar to the concentration of LPA found normally in the plasma (0.4–0.6 μm) (3Mills G.B. Moolenaar W.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). LPA protection was also evident over a 96-h time course where at each time point LPA-treated cells showed reduced spontaneous apoptosis compared with cells grown in serum-free medium (Fig. 2B). In addition, primary CLL cells were incubated for 72 h in the absence or presence of LPA added once (1× LPA), added twice separated by 24 h (2× LPA), or added three times at 24-h intervals (3× LPA), and the amount of spontaneous apoptosis was determined. This revealed that the percentage of surviving cells increased from 10 to 24% upon further additions of LPA over the 72-h time course compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2C). In addition to spontaneous apoptosis, LPA provides protection against Flu-induced apoptosis in primary CLL cells. Primary CLL cells were treated with 10 μm Flu alone or in combination with 5.0 μm LPA. After 24 h, the level of apoptosis was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In cells treated with Flu alone, ∼50% of the cells underwent apoptosis. In the presence of LPA, the percentage of apoptosis was decreased to ∼30% with the level of apoptosis in untreated cells being 20% (Fig. 3A). This represents a 50% reduction in the amount of Flu-induced apoptosis. Annexin V staining of primary CLL cells also confirmed these results, where LPA decreased Flu-induced apoptosis from 9.7 to 1.5% (Fig. 3B). In 26 patients studied, we found that LPA protected primary CLL cells against Flu-induced apoptosis in 12 cases (40%). In contrast, LPA did not protect normal B-cells against Flu-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3C). Plasma containing LPA from both normal volunteers and CLL patients showed protection against spontaneous induced apoptosis (data not presented). This suggests that the LPA protection of CLL cells is primarily due to altered responsiveness of CLL cells to LPA.Fig. 3LPA protects primary CLL cells against Flu-induced apoptosis.A, primary CLL cells isolated from 10 patients were treated with 10 μm Flu in the presence or absence of 5 μm LPA for 24 h. The cells were also treated with LPA alone or untreated (control). The amount of apoptosis was determined by acridine orange staining. Each point represents the percentage of apoptotic cells for individual patients, and the bar represents the mean. B, primary CLL cells were also treated with LPA and Flu similar to A, but the amount of apoptosis was determined by annexin V staining using flow cytometry. 7-AAD-stained cells represents cells with the plasma membrane has become permeabilized to the DNA binding dye. Annexin V was visualized by fluorescein isothiocyanate staining. The cells that were 7-AAD-negative and annexin V-positive were undergoing apoptosis. The percentage of cells in each quadrant was indicated within the quadrant. C, normal B-cells were isolated from two volunteers and treated with Flu and LPA similar to A. The amount of apoptosis was determined by acridine orange staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Primary CLL Cells Express Higher Levels of LPA1 Receptor Compared with Normal B-cells—LPA binds to four receptors, LPA1–4. LPA1 is the most widely expressed receptor and is expressed in B-cells (3Mills G.B. Moolenaar W.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 17Anliker B. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20555-20558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). By Western blotting, the level of LPA1 expression was found to be increased in primary CLL cells isolated from 12 patients when compared with normal B-cells isolated from four healthy individuals (Fig. 4A). To verify that the LPA1 antibodies are recognizing the receptor, primary CLL cells untransfected (lane 1), transfected with siRNA against LPA1 (lane 2), or transfected with scrambled siRNA (lane 3) were lysed and Western blotted for LPA1. Only cells treated with siRNA against LPA1 showed a reduction in the ∼50-kDa band corresponding with LPA1 molecular mass, whereas untransfected cells and cells transfected with scrambled siRNA failed to lower this band (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, nonspecific bands at higher molecular masses failed to change following siRNA against LPA1 transfection (data not shown). In addition, CLL cells that were protected from apoptosis by LPA showed higher expression for LPA1 compared with CLL cells that failed to respond to LPA and to normal B-cells (Fig. 4C). To confirm these differences in LPA1 expression, we performed RT-PCR to detect the mRNA for LPA1 in the CLL cells. In CLL cells that responded to LPA protection, the level of mRNA for LPA1 was higher than in CLL cells that failed to respond to LPA protection (Fig. 4D).

https://openalex.org/W2125301850,"The death ligand, TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), has shown great promise for inducing apoptosis selectively in tumors. Although many tumor cells are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis alone, they can often be sensitized by co-treatment with DNA-damaging agents such as etoposide. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this therapeutically important synergy is unknown. We explored the mechanism mediating TRAIL-DNA damage apoptotic synergy in human mesothelioma cells, a tumor type particularly refractory to existing therapies. We show that Bid, a cytoplasmic Bcl-2 homology domain 3-containing protein activated by caspase 8 in response to TRAIL ligation, is essential for TRAIL-etoposide apo-ptotic synergy and, furthermore, that exposure to DNA damage primes cells to induction of apoptosis by otherwise sublethal levels of activated Bid. Finally, we show that the extensive caspase 8 cleavage seen during TRAIL-etoposide synergy is a consequence and not a cause of the apoptotic cascade activated downstream of Bid. These data indicate that TRAIL-etoposide apoptotic synergy arises because DNA damage increases the inherent sensitivity of cells to levels of TRAIL-activated Bid that would otherwise be insufficient for apoptosis. Such studies indicate how the adroit combination of differing proapoptotic and sublethal signals can provide an effective strategy for treating refractory tumors.

Such studies indicate how the adroit combination of differing proapoptotic and sublethal signals can provide an effective strategy for treating refractory tumors. Resistance to apoptosis is critical to tumor development and maintenance (1.Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21906) Google Scholar, 2.Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). In part, this is because activated oncogenes and deregulated proliferation are potent triggers of apoptosis that must be countermanded before tumors can arise (3.Evan G. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). Moreover, because most cancer therapies act by inducing apoptosis in tumor cells, suppression of apoptosis is also likely a critical feature of chemo- and radioresistance (4.Schmitt C.A. Lowe S.W. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Restoring an effective capacity to execute apoptosis therefore represents an attractive general strategy for the selective therapeutic targeting of tumor cells.Relatively little is known concerning the mechanisms by which apoptosis is suppressed in cancers. However, because all tumor cells appear to retain the capacity to undergo apoptosis when subjected to sufficiently strong insults, apoptosis suppression in cancer cells in the main seems to involve dysfunctions in apoptotic and survival signaling pathways rather than lesions in the highly redundant basal apoptotic machinery itself (5.Green D.R. Evan G.I. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 19-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). A frequent example of this is the mutational inactivation of the p53 pathway observed in most tumor cells. p53 is a transcription factor that integrates disparate stress and damage responses and couples them to the basal apoptotic machinery in great part through transcriptional modulation of effectors that impact on the mitochondrion (6.Fridman J.S. Lowe S.W. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9030-9040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Because inactivation of p53 does not compromise the apoptotic machinery but instead severs it from upstream damage signals, such cells should, in principle, remain amenable to activation of apoptosis by p53-independent pathways.Recently, the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL 1The abbreviations used are: TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; tBid, truncated Bid; BH3, Bcl-2 homology domain 3; DR, death receptor; Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma-2; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, short interfering RNA; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide.1The abbreviations used are: TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; tBid, truncated Bid; BH3, Bcl-2 homology domain 3; DR, death receptor; Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma-2; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, short interfering RNA; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide./Apo2L has excited much interest because of its potential selectivity in triggering apoptosis in tumor cells rather than in their normal counterparts (7.Shi J.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). This lack of general toxicity is reflected in the fact that TRAIL has been proven relatively safe in in vivo studies of rodents and primates compared with the other death receptor ligands, tumor necrosis factor and Fas ligand, both of which induce significant inflammation and tissue injury (9.Ashkenazi A. Pai R.C. Fong S. Leung S. Lawrence D.A. Marsters S.A. Blackie C. Chang L. McMurtrey A.E. Hebert A. DeForge L. Koumenis I.L. Lewis D. Harris L. Bussiere J. Koeppen H. Shahrokh Z. Schwall R.H. J. Clin.

The Fas-associated death domain, in turn, recruits procaspase 8 into a death-inducing signaling complex that triggers autocatalytic cleavage and activation of caspase 8 (20.Sprick M.R.

In so-called “Type I” cells, such as T lymphocytes, death-inducing signaling complex-activated caspase 8 directly activates downstream effector caspases and triggers apoptosis. However, in the majority of cells (“Type II”), TRAIL-induced activation of caspase 8 is insufficient to kill without recruiting the mitochondrial apoptotic program through cleavage and activation of the BH3 protein intermediary Bid (22.Scaffidi C.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar).In principle, DNA damage signals might interact with the TRAIL signaling pathway at any point to induce a synergistic apoptotic response. Some evidence exists that DNA damage can up-regulate expression of the TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5 (12.Nagane M. Pan G. Weddle J.J. Dixit V.M. Cavanee W.K. Huang H.-J.S.

Hao C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 4255-4266PubMed Google Scholar), either of which might augment TRAIL-induced caspase 8 cleavage. On the other hand, because TRAIL and DNA damage signals both impact on the mitochondrion, it is possible that DNA damage signals might instead act to lower the threshold for release of apoptotic effectors by Bid or vice versa. Unfortunately, dissecting how such pathways interact is confounded by the fact that, once the apoptotic program is initiated, widespread activation of effector caspases leads to promiscuous cleavage of the remaining initiator and effector procaspases as well as other caspase targets (27.Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J.

This widespread activation makes it difficult to distinguish cause from consequence.Mesothelioma is a highly aggressive tumor conspicuous for its resistance to existing anticancer therapies (29.Vogelzang N.J. Semin. Oncol. 2002; 29: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In previous work, we have shown that mesothelioma cells can be sensitized to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by various DNA-damaging signals (30.Liu W. Bodle E. Chen J.Y. Gao M. Rosen G.D. Broaddus V.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31.Vivo C. Liu W. Broaddus V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25461-25467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Such sensitization occurs despite the absence of functional p53 in these cells (31.Vivo C. Liu W.

Thorac. Cardiovasc.

Synergy also appears to be selective for malignant mesothelioma cells; despite earlier experiments in which primary mesothelial cells had variable responses suggesting synergy (30.Liu W. Bodle E. Chen J.Y. Gao M. Rosen G.D. Broaddus V.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); currently, with more careful harvesting and culturing, the primary cells consistently show a lack of synergy between TRAIL and DNA-damaging agents (see “Results”). We thus sought to understand the mechanism underlying this striking synergy between TRAIL and DNA-damaging agents in malignant mesothelioma cells.Using a combination of RNA interference and microinjection, we have perturbed the TRAIL pathway to dissect the molecular basis of the TRAIL-DNA damage synergy and show that it is mediated by the essential intermediary Bid, a BH3 protein that is a target for death receptor signaling pathways. We also show that TRAIL by itself causes low level cleavage of Bid that alone is insufficient to trigger apoptosis in mesothelioma cells. However, exposure of mesothelioma cells to sublethal DNA-damaging agents profoundly increases sensitivity to the pro-apoptotic effects of Bid. Hence, the combination of sublethal TRAIL and sublethal DNA damage efficiently triggers activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic program and death of mesothelioma cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Human recombinant TRAIL (375-TL, histidine-tagged extracellular domain) was purchased from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN), and the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide was purchased from Bedford Laboratories (Bedford, OH), dissolved in Me2SO, and used at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem.Recombinant tBid was generated from full-length human Bid cDNA with a thrombin cleavage sequence inserted at amino acids 57–62 and a His6 tag on the COOH terminus (33.von Ahsen O. Renken C. Perkins G. Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). After thrombin cleavage and purification, the tBid fragment generated is identical to that resulting from caspase 8 cleavage of wild-type full-length Bid and runs as a single band at the expected molecular mass of 18–20 kDa in SDS gels.Cell Culture—Human malignant mesothelioma cell lines M28 (from Dr. Brenda Gerwin, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), REN (from Dr. Roy Smythe, University of Texas, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX), and primary human mesothelial cells were grown in standard media (31.Vivo C. Liu W. Broaddus V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25461-25467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Both cell lines have been shown to have inactive p53 (31.Vivo C. Liu W. Broaddus V.C. J. Biol.

Primary human mesothelial cells were cultured from ascites fluid from patients without infection or malignancy according to a protocol approved by the University of California San Francisco Committee on Human Research. Cells were γ-irradiated using a cesium irradiator.Immunoblotting Analysis—Cell extracts were fractionated by SDS gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were then blocked with 1% nonfat dried milk. Anti-caspase 8 (1C12, 1:250; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-human Bid (clone 2002, 1:1000; Cell Signaling), and anti-human DR5 (AB16942, 1:500; Chemicon International) were used as primary antibodies, and horseradish peroxidase-linked rabbit anti-mouse (1:5000) or horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit (1:2500, Amersham Biosciences) antibodies were used as appropriate secondary reagents. Actin was measured to confirm equivalent loading of cell extracts.Apoptosis was quantitated using fluorescein isothiocyanate-annexin V (BD Biosciences) as described (34.Broaddus V.C. Yang L. Scavo L.M. Ernst J.D. Boylan A.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 2050-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The extent of apoptosis and the lack of necrosis (<5%) were confirmed in selected experiments by direct morphologic analysis of cells stained with acridine orange and ethidium bromide as described (34.Broaddus V.C. Yang L. Scavo L.M. Ernst J.D. Boylan A.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 2050-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).Microinjection and Fluorescence Time-lapse Microscopy—For microinjection, tBid was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline together with dextran-conjugated Oregon Green (0.5% final concentration, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as a co-injection marker. Cells were plated on sterile glass-bottomed coverslip dishes in a phenol red-free medium and, when adherent, exposed to either etoposide (10 μg/ml) or the Me2SO carrier (1:6000) for 15 h. Etoposide- or Me2SO-exposed cells were microinjected with either tBid (5 nm) or phosphate-buffered saline as described previously (35.Juin P. Hueber A.-O. Littlewood T. Evan G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1367-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). At least 100 cells in two discrete areas in each of two separate experiments were microinjected in each case. The estimated volume injected into each cell was 2–5 pl (36.Juin P. Hunt A. Littlewood T. Griffiths B. Swigart L.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Evan G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6158-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), equivalent to ∼6,000–15,000 molecules of tBid. Prior to time-lapse analysis, all cells received fresh media containing propidium iodide (2 μg/ml).Microinjected cells were placed in a thermostatic chamber on an Axiovert S 100 TV microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). The chamber was maintained at 37 °C and continuously flushed with 7.5% CO2. Cells were imaged every 25 min with an Orca C4742–95 charged couple device camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan) at 8 bit using Openlab software (Improvision, Lexington, MA), which also controlled the XY-stage, shutters, and filter wheels. Phase contrast images were illuminated with a 100-watt halogen bulb while a mercury vapor lamp and automated excitation filter wheel were used to excite the fluorescent probes. Oregon Green was excited using a 480/25 bandpass filter, and propidium iodide was excited using a 525/40 bandpass filter. The emission from these two fluorophores were detected using a polychroic beamsplitter 86007bs (Spectra Services, Rochester, NY) followed by an automated emission filter wheel using 525/40 and 620/60 bandpass filters, respectively. Images for each time point were merged to generate a color time-lapse movie. Live microinjected cells remained green and adherent; dying cells rounded up, developed a red nucleus as they became permeable to propidium iodide, and lost their green color. Microinjected cells (green) were followed for their fate (survival or death), and survival was plotted versus time.RNA Interference—Bid suppression was accomplished using two rounds of transfection with a siRNA (antisense strand: UAU UCC GGA UGA UGU CUU CdTdT) (Xeragon, Inc., Huntsville, AL). An irrelevant RNAi (antisense strand: ACG UGA CAC GUU CGG AGA AdTdT) was used as a control (non-silencing). siRNA duplexes were transfected into target cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as described (37.Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8076) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were split 2 days later (day 3 post-transfection), transfected again with the same siRNA the next day (day 4), split on day 6, and studied on day 7.Statistics—Differences among groups were determined using analysis of variance with post hoc analysis by Tukey's test (InStat 2.0, GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). p < 0.05 was considered significant. All data are shown as mean ± S.E. Synergy of apoptosis was confirmed using isobolographic analysis as described (31.Vivo C. Liu W. Broaddus V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25461-25467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 38.Tallarida R.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 865-872PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSTo validate apoptotic cooperation between TRAIL and DNA damage, M28 and REN mesothelioma cells were exposed to various doses of TRAIL, etoposide, or γ irradiation, and apoptosis was determined 18 h later. At commonly used therapeutic doses (25 ng/ml TRAIL, 10 μg/ml etoposide, 12 gray of γ irradiation), each insult individually induced negligible apoptosis (Fig. 1, A–C), even when assayed as late as 72 h after the insult. Indeed, even at far higher doses (250 ng/ml TRAIL, 100 μg/ml etoposide, 50 gray of γ irradiation), each insult alone induced negligible apoptosis (data not shown). In contrast, exposure of mesothelioma cells to the combination of sublethal TRAIL (25 ng/ml) together with either sublethal etoposide (10 μg/ml) or γ irradiation (12 gray) induced substantial apoptosis (Fig. 1, a–c). No such enhancement of apoptosis was observed when the two genotoxic insults, etoposide and γ irradiation, were combined (data not shown). Moreover, the apoptotic synergy between TRAIL and DNA damage that we observed in M28 and REN mesothelioma tumor cells was absent in normal primary human mesothelial cells (Fig. 1d).It has been reported that DNA damage can sensitize cells to the effects of TRAIL through up-regulation of TRAIL receptor expression, specifically of DR5 (24.Wu G.S. Burns T.F. McDonald E.R. Jiang W. Meng R. Krantz I.D. Kao G. Gan D.D. Zhou J.Y. Muschel R. Hamilton S.R. Spinner N.B. Markowitz S. Wu G. El-Deiry W.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). However, exposure of mesothelioma cells to etoposide had no measurable effect on DR5 expression (Fig. 2), consistent with our previous published observations indicating no induction of DR5 by doxorubicin (30.Liu W. Bodle E. Chen J.Y. Gao M. Rosen G.D. Broaddus V.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, some other mechanism must underlie the apoptotic synergy between TRAIL and etoposide that we observe.Fig. 2Etoposide has no effect on DR5 expression. M28 cells were exposed to etoposide (10 μg/ml) for 6, 12, or 18 h or to the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (100 μm) for 18 h and lysed for immunoblot analysis. The proteasome inhibitor, known to up-regulate DR5, was used as a positive control. Whereas exposure to MG132 shows an expected increase in DR5, exposure to the DNA-damaging agent etoposide has no discernible effect on levels of the TRAIL receptor DR5. Actin was used as a standard to ensure equivalent loading of cell extracts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To explore the mechanism underlying the apoptotic cooperation between TRAIL signaling and DNA damage, we first assessed the impact of TRAIL and etoposide exposure, separately and together, on cleavage of the TRAIL death effectors caspase 8 and Bid. By 15 h, the earliest time at which synergistic apoptosis becomes evident, we observed substantial caspase 8 cleavage only in cells exposed to the combination of TRAIL and etoposide (Fig. 3). Likewise, Bid cleavage (as judged by the decrease in full-length Bid) was extensive only in cells exposed to the combined insults (Fig. 3). By contrast, cells treated with TRAIL alone exhibited little evident caspase 8 cleavage, which appeared inconsistently in immunoblots. Nonetheless, as noted elsewhere (39.Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.-j. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3765) Google Scholar), such low level caspase 8 activation was sufficient to induce modest but measurable cleavage of Bid (Figs. 3 and 6). No caspase 8 or Bid cleavage was evident in cells exposed solely to etoposide (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Caspase 8 and Bid cleavage accompany TRAIL-etoposide apoptotic synergy. M28 mesothelioma cells were exposed to TRAIL, etoposide, or the combination of both for 15 h and either lysed for immunoblot analysis or assayed for annexin V binding by flow cytometry. TRAIL plus etoposide induces significant apoptosis as well as extensive caspase 8 and Bid cleavage. TRAIL treatment alone induces minimal evident caspase 8 cleavage or apoptosis but induces evident Bid cleavage as shown by a decrease of the whole Bid protein. Etoposide alone induces no apoptosis and no discernible cleavage of caspase 8 or Bid. Actin was used as a standard to ensure equivalent loading of cell extracts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6Bid knock-down prevents the extensive caspase 8 cleavage that accompanies TRAIL-etoposide synergy. M28 mesothelioma cells were transfected with random (R) or Bid siRNA and then exposed to TRAIL alone, etoposide alone, or both together. At 15 h, cells were harvested and either prepared for immunoblotting for caspase 8 or assayed for apoptosis by annexin V binding. Low level caspase 8 cleavage is evident in cells treated with TRAIL alone, whereas extensive caspase 8 cleavage is evident in cells co-exposed to TRAIL and etoposide. With Bid suppression, extensive caspase 8 cleavage is absent in cells exposed to both TRAIL and etoposide; caspase 8 cleavage is now similar to that following TRAIL alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Bid cleavage that we observe in cells exposed to TRAIL alone indicates that even though TRAIL alone is insufficient to trigger apoptosis, its cognate pathway is activated to some degree in such cells. This raises the possibility that DNA damage might cooperate with TRAIL to induce apoptosis by increasing the sensitivity of cells to low levels of tBid generated by TRAIL that would otherwise be insufficient to trigger cell death. To test this hypothesis directly, we asked whether etoposide exposure enhances sensitivity to induction of apoptosis from sublethal levels of tBid in"

The pathogenesis of C. perfringens infection has been attributed, in part, to the large number of extracellular toxins and hydrolytic enzymes (6Stevens D.L. Bryant A.E. Clin. Infect.

Among them, sialidase is one of the most extensively studied extracellular enzymes of this organism (10Cassidy J.T. Jourdian G.W. Roseman S. J. Biol.

We have reported previously that the commercial sialidase prepared from C. perfringens ATCC 10543 is contaminated with an unusual endo-β-galactosidase capable of releasing a specific disaccharide glycotope, GlcNAcα1→4Gal-, from blood group A+ porcine gastric mucin (A+-PGM) 1The abbreviations used are: A+-PGM, blood group A+ porcine gastric mucin; A-Tri, A trisaccharide (GalNAcα1→3(Fucα1→2)Gal); B-Tri, B trisaccharide (Galα1→3(Fucα1→2)Gal); nE-ABase, native E-ABase; ConA, concanavalin A; kbp, kilobase pair; rE-ABase, recombinant E-ABase; B+-HOCG, blood group B+ human ovarian cyst glycoprotein; RBC, red blood cell(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; A-Tetra, A tetrasaccharide (GalNAcα1→3(Fucα1→2)Galβ1→4Glc); A-Penta, A pentasaccharide (GalNAcα1→3(Fucα1→2)Galβ1→4(Fucα1→3)Glc); BPenta, B pentasaccharide (Galα1→3(Fucα1→2)Galβ1→4(Fucα1→3)Glc); A-Hexa, A hexasaccharide (GalNAcα1→3(Fucα1→2)Galβ1→ 3GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc); FRP, fucolectin-related protein. (19Ashida H. Anderson K. Nakayama J. Maskos K. Chou C.-W. Cole R. Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28226-28232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). From the same preparation, we have detected another unique endo-β-galactosidase capable of releasing both the blood group A trisaccharide (A-Tri; GalNAcα1→3-(Fucα1→2)Gal) and B trisaccharide (B-Tri; Galα1→3-(Fucα1→2)Gal) glycotopes from blood group A- and B-containing glycoconjugates, respectively. The unique specificity and the potential usefulness of this enzyme for glycoconjugate research prompted us to carry out the isolation of the native enzyme as well as the cloning and characterization of the recombinant enzyme. Based on the substrate specificity, we propose to name this enzyme E-ABase for blood group A- and B-cleaving endo-β-galactosidase. We found that the gene (eabC) that encodes E-ABase is identical to the CPE0329 gene of C. perfringens strain 13, whose product was labeled as a hypothetical protein (20Shimizu T. Ohtani K. Hirakawa H. Ohshima K. Yamashita A. Shiba T. Ogasawara N. Hattori M. Kuhara S. Hayashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 996-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison of E-ABase with other glycosidases belonging to any of the 97 established families of glycoside hydrolases revealed no significant sequence homology. Thus, we proposed to assign this unusual endo-β-galactosidase to a new glycosidase family, GH98. A+-PGM (type II, Sigma) that had been dialyzed exhaustively against distilled water was used as substrate for assaying E-ABase activity by TLC. A 10-μl reaction mixture containing 25 μg of A+-PGM and an appropriate amount of E-ABase in 25 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) was incubated at 37 °C for a predetermined time. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μl of glacial acetic acid, and the entire reaction mixture was spotted onto a silica gel-coated TLC plate (EMD Chemicals, Inc.). The plate was developed with 1-butanol/acetic acid/ water (2:1:1, v/v/v), and glycoconjugates were revealed by the diphenylamine/aniline/phosphoric acid reagent (21Anderson K. Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The intensity of the glycoconjugate bands was quantified by scanning the plates as described previously (19Ashida H. Anderson K. Nakayama J. Maskos K. Chou C.-W. Cole R. Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28226-28232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount that releases 1 nmol of A-Tri from A+-PGM/min at 37 °C. Unless indicated otherwise, all operations were performed at 0–5 °C, and protein solutions were concentrated by ultrafiltration using an Amicon stirred cell with a PM-10 membrane (Millipore Corp.). Centrifugations were routinely carried out at 8000×g for 20–30 min using a Sorvall RC5C refrigerated centrifuge. Step 1: Preparation of the Crude Enzyme—C. perfringens ATCC 10543 was cultured for 20 h at 37 °C in 15 liters of culture medium as described previously (22Cassidy J.T. Jourdian G.W. Roseman S. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 680-685Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The culture supernatant was brought to 85% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate and left standing overnight. The precipitate thus formed was collected, dissolved in a small amount of water, and dialyzed exhaustively against water for 48 h. The dialyzed sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was lyophilized to yield 11.2 g of crude enzyme powder. Step 2: Sephacryl S-200 Gel Filtration—The crude enzyme powder from Step 1 was dissolved in 70 ml of 0.1 m ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.8) and applied to a Sephacryl S-200 HR column (5 × 90 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was also eluted with the same buffer at 96 ml/h, and 20-ml fractions were collected. A 10-μl aliquot from every other fraction was assayed for enzyme activity using A+-PGM as substrate. Fractions containing nE-ABase activity were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) (Buffer A). Step 3: Fractogel DEAE Chromatography—The preparation from Step 2 was applied to a Fractogel DEAE-650M column (1.5 × 10.5 cm; EMD Chemicals, Inc.) equilibrated with Buffer A. After removing the unadsorbed proteins with Buffer A, nE-ABase was eluted with 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) at 1 ml/min. Fractions of 2 ml were collected. The fractions containing nE-ABase were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed overnight against 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) (Buffer B). Step 4: Fractogel SP Chromatography—The preparation from Step 3 was applied to a Fractogel SP-650M column (1.0 × 7.5 cm; EMD Chemicals, Inc.) equilibrated with Buffer B, and the column was eluted with the same buffer at 1 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected. The majority of nE-ABase activity was recovered in the unadsorbed fractions, whereas the bulk of the contaminants was eluted with Buffer B containing 0.4 m NaCl. Fractions with the highest nE-ABase activity were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) (Buffer C). Step 5: Concanavalin A (ConA)-Sepharose Chromatography—The preparation from Step 4 was concentrated to 0.3–0.5 ml and applied to a ConA-Sepharose column (1.0 × 48 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer C. nE-ABase was eluted in the early breakthrough fractions with Buffer C. Fractions containing nE-ABase activity were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against Buffer A. Step 6: Mono Q Chromatography—The enzyme preparation from Step 5 was applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (0.5 × 5.5 cm; Amer-sham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A at 0.5 ml/min using an Amersham Biosciences ▵KTA FPLC™ system. After washing with the same buffer, the column was eluted with Buffer A containing NaCl using the following gradients: 0–0.06 m NaCl for 5 column volumes, 0.06 m NaCl for 5 column volumes, 0.06–0.1 m NaCl for 20 column volumes, 0.1 m NaCl for 20 column volumes, 0.1–0.12 m NaCl for 5 column volumes, 0.12 m NaCl for 5 column volumes, and 0.12–0.3 m NaCl for 5 column volumes. Fractions of 1 ml were collected. Fractions containing nE-ABase activity were eluted as a sharp peak at 0.1 m NaCl. They were pooled, dialyzed against 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), and used in subsequent experiments. This final enzyme preparation was >98% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 1).

Mono Q0.72026289418.32630 Open table in a new tab CNBr cleavage products were generated from 200 μg of purified nE-ABase according to Charbonneau (23Charbonneau H. Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989: 29Google Scholar). Peptides were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a Trans-Blot semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 20 V for 1.25 h. The membrane was briefly stained with 0.04% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 20% methanol, and the most prominent bands were excised. The three CNBr peptides (P1–P3), as well as the N-terminal region of the native enzyme, were sequenced by the Core Facility of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (New Orleans, LA). The sequences of these peptides are shown in Fig. 2. Genomic DNA from C. perfringens ATCC 10543 was prepared as described (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 2.0.1-2.12.5Google Scholar). We initially designed a sense primer, F1, and an anti-sense primer, R2 (see Table II), based on the N-terminal sequence (LEESRDVYLSDLDWLNATHGDDXK) and the CNBr P2 peptide (MRAKTKSLXYG), respectively. A 1.5-kbp product was generated by PCR using these two primers and the C. perfringens genomic DNA as template. PCR was run with Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) for 30 cycles consisting of 45 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 45 s of annealing at 45 °C, and 2 min of extension at 72 °C. This 1.5-kbp product (Probe A) was sequenced and subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). Probe A was later used to screen the first genomic DNA library.Table IIPrimers used for the cloning and expression of the E-ABase gene (eabC)PrimerOligonucleotide sequence (5′ to 3′)LocationaThe corresponding nucleotide residues in the cloned sequence are shown in Fig. 2.F1GAYYTIGAYTGGYTNAAYGC136-155R2YTTNGTYTTNGCYCGCAT1630-1647EAB4.1FGCTACCCACGGAGATGATACAA154-175EAB4.2FAGTGGAAAGAGGTTCCAGATG773-793EAB4.2RCTGCTGCGTTACTTTCTACA1086-1105EAB4.5RATCTGACTTCCAGATAAACGACTCTC1795-1820EX1AACCATGGGATTGGAAGAAAGCAGA106-120EX6AGCCGGATCCGTGATGATGATGATGATGCTTAATTACAATATC2386-2400a The corresponding nucleotide residues in the cloned sequence are shown in Fig. 2. Open table in a new tab XL1-Blue MRF′ and SOLR cells (Stratagene) were grown in LB medium supplemented with 0.2% maltose and 10 mm MgSO4. Construction of the first genomic library in the λZAPII vector (Stratagene) and subsequent screenings were performed as described previously (25Ashida H. Maskos K. Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2388-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) using primers EAB4.2F and EAB4.2R (see Table II), complementing the sequence of Probe A. Of 10,000 plaques screened, 20 positives were identified, and one positive cloned phage was selected for in vivo excision using the ExAssist helper phage and the SOLR strain. Single colonies of SOLR cells containing the excised phagemid (DNA insert in the pBluescript SK(–) vector) were subsequently used in a third PCR screening under the previous conditions. One clone (pEAB4E) was found to contain two-thirds of the expected gene sequence from the 5′-end. To identify the 3′-end of the E-ABase gene, a second genomic library was constructed in Escherichia coli JM109. Genomic DNA (15 μg) from C. perfringens was digested with 100 units of XbaI. Purified DNA fragments between 1.8 and 6 kbp were ligated into a pBluescript SK(–)/ XbaI/calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase-treated vector and transformed into E. coli JM109. One positive clone (pEABX1), identified by PCR using primers EAB4.1F and EAB4.5R (see Table II), was found to contain the full-length open reading frame of eabC as shown in Fig. 2. An expression plasmid (pEABHNB3) with a C-terminal His6 tag was constructed in the pET-15b vector. eabC without the sequence for the N-terminal 35-amino acid signal peptide was amplified by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase with pEABX1 as template and primers EX1 and EX6 (see Table II). The 2.3-kbp PCR product was purified, digested with NcoI and BamHI, ligated into the pET-15b vector, sequenced, and given the name pEABHNB3. rE-ABase was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cultured at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. rE-ABase was purified under nondenaturing conditions as described by Hoffmann and Roeder (26Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6337-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), but excluded glycerol, dithiothreitol, and Nonidet P-40. Three 1-liter portions of LB/ampicillin medium were each inoculated with 20–30 ml of an overnight culture, and the cells were harvested 4 h after the absorbance at 600 nm had reached 1.4. The cells were lysed in 60 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm imidazole) using a French press. The cell-free extract was heated at 60 °C for 4 min and centrifuged. This heat treatment precipitated ∼30% of nonenzymatic proteins without affecting E-ABase activity. The supernatant was then applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (1.5 × 12.5 cm; QIAGEN Inc.) equilibrated with lysis buffer. After extensively washing the column with the same buffer, the bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 150 mm imidazole). Fractions containing enzyme activity were concentrated and dialyzed for 18 h against 4 liters of Buffer A. Aliquots (9–12 mg) of protein were then applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column previously equilibrated with Buffer A. rE-ABase was eluted with Buffer A containing NaCl using the following gradients: 0–0.1 m NaCl for 5 column volumes, 0.1 m NaCl for 5 column volumes, and 0.1–0.2 m NaCl for 40 column volumes. rE-ABase was eluted as a sharp peak at ∼0.13 m NaCl. A+-PGM (1 g) was dissolved in 80 ml of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) and incubated with 4000 units of rE-ABase at 37 °C for 48 h with shaking (100 rpm). The reaction mixture was then filtered through a PM-10 membrane using an Amicon stirred cell, and the filtrate (70 ml) containing A-Tri was lyophilized to obtain 0.35 g of dried residue. This residue was dissolved in 6 ml of acetonitrile/methanol/water (1:3:1, v/v/v) and applied to a Bio-Sil A column (1.5 × 95 cm; Bio-Rad) previously equilibrated with acetonitrile. A-Tri was eluted with acetonitrile/ methanol/water (1:3:1, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1.6 ml/min. Fractions containing A-Tri were collected, pooled, and evaporated to dryness. The resulting partially purified A-Tri was dissolved in 2–3 ml of water, desalted using a Sephadex G-10 column (1.5 × 93 cm), and applied to a second Bio-Sil A column (1.5 × 96 cm) equilibrated with acetonitrile to remove minor contaminants. This column was eluted with a less polar solvent, acetonitrile/water (3:1, v/v), and fractions containing pure ATri were pooled and lyophilized. The yield of A-Tri was 11.4 mg/g of A+-PGM. An identical scheme was used for the preparation of 8.6 mg of B-Tri from 260 mg of B+-HOCG. The structures of A-Tri and B-Tri were subsequently established by NMR spectroscopy. For NMR measurements, each trisaccharide (8–10 mg) was repeatedly exchanged with D2O with intermediate lyophilization and then dissolved in 0.6 ml of D2O. The one-dimensional 1H and 13C and two-dimensional 1H-1H (double quantum-filtered COSY, total correlation spectroscopy, and rotating frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy) and 13C-1H (heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation spectroscopy) spectra (Bruker pulse program library) were recorded at 25 °C using a Bruker Avance DRX 500 spectrometer at frequencies of 500.13 MHz (1H) and 125.75 MHz (13C). The spectrometer was equipped with a 5-mm Bruker inverse triple resonance probe with an xyz gradient coil and a broadband observe double resonance probe with a z axis gradient coil. The methyl resonance of an external 1% acetone in D2O measured separately under identical conditions was set at 2.225 ppm (1H) and 31.07 ppm (13C) and used as the reference. 1H-1H coupling constants (3JH-1,H-2) were measured in one-dimensional spectra and from the double quantum-filtered COSY cross-peaks using the FELIX 98 DQF macro (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). 13C-1H coupling constants (1JC-1,H-1) were extracted from the 13C-1H heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra recorded without decoupling. Analysis of antigen expression in human red blood cells (RBC) was performed by flow cytometry with a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur cytometer at a low speed flow rate. Data from 30,000 events were collected and analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). To prepare RBC for enzyme treatment, 400 μl of type A or B RBC (2–4% cell suspension; Immucor Inc., Norcross, GA) was centrifuged at 1250 × g for 4 min. The packed RBC were then washed with autoclaved phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4), centrifuged, and resuspended in PBS to give a hematocrit of 8–16%. A 50-μl aliquot of each type of RBC was then treated with 50 μl (533 units) of rE-ABase, and the mixture was rotated end-over-end on a 5.5-cm diameter wheel at 8 rpm for 18 h at 23 °C. After incubation, RBC were washed with 2.0 ml of PBS and resuspended in 20 μl of PBS. A 5-μl aliquot of packed RBC was then added to 100 μl of PBS wash buffer (PBS containing 1% fetal bovine serum). The indirect immunofluorescence method was used to label 1 × 107 RBC (from the control and enzyme-treated RBC samples) with murine anti-A or anti-B monoclonal antibody (Immucor Inc.) as the primary antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 in PBS wash buffer, followed by the addition of fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Fab-specific; Sigma) as the secondary antibody. The secondary antibody was used at a dilution of 1:200 in PBS wash buffer. All incubations were performed for 15–20 min at room temperature under rotation. The labeled RBC were washed with PBS wash buffer, resus-pended in 1 ml of PBS, and then analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Exoglycosidases were assayed using p-nitrophenyl glycosides in 20 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) as described previously (27Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 702-713Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Protease activity was determined using Azocoll as substrate (28Moore G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE was performed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Purification of nE-ABase—Table I summarizes the results of a typical purification of nE-ABase from 15 liters of C. perfringens culture supernatant. We chose Sephacryl S-200 HR gel filtration as the first step in the purification of nE-ABase because this step could process a large amount of crude enzyme as well as remove >90% of the contaminating proteins. After gel filtration, the enzyme preparation was further subjected to Fractogel DEAE and Fractogel SP chromatographies. The final two steps in the purification scheme involved ConA-Sepharose and fast protein liquid chromatographies using a Mono Q column. Although ConA-Sepharose chromatography separated a large molecular mass (96 kDa) contaminant from nE-ABase, Mono Q/fast protein liquid chromatography was effective in resolving nE-ABase from smaller contaminating proteins. By these steps, nE-ABase was purified by >2600-fold with a recovery of ∼18%. As shown in Fig. 1, the purified nE-ABase migrated as one major protein band of ∼88 kDa upon SDS-PAGE. nE-ABase was found to be free of protease activity using Azocoll as substrate. It was also free of the following exoglycosidase activities using p-nitrophenyl glycosides as substrates: α-l-fucosidase, α- and β-glucosidases, α- and β-galactosidases, α- and β-mannosidases, α-N-acetylglucosaminidase, α-arabinosidase, β-xylosidase, and β-hexosaminidase. Cloning of the E-ABase Gene (eabC)—We initiated the cloning of eabC by generating a DNA fragment (Probe A) using genomic DNA from C. perfringens ATCC 10543 as template and the degenerate primers F1 and R2 (Table II), designed from the N-terminal peptide (LEESRDVYLSDLDWLNATHGDDXK) and the CNBr P2 peptide (MRAKTKSLXYG), respectively (see Fig. 2). The deduced amino acid sequence of Probe A contains the N-terminal sequence of nE-ABase and the two CNBr peptides P1 (MLNEAQSYXNPK) and P2 (MRAKTKSLXYG), indicating that this DNA fragment is part of the gene encoding E-ABase. After screening the first genomic library (EcoRI-digested) with Probe A, we selected one positive cloned phage for in vivo excision to generate a phagemid, pEAB4E. Although this clone contains the third CNBr peptide, P3 (MSQSPAYTXGRYXNIPAV), it still lacks an estimated one-third of the E-ABase gene sequence at the 3′-end. Therefore, a second genomic library (XbaI-digested) was constructed in the pBluescript SK(–) vector. Several colonies were examined by PCR, and one positive clone (pEABX1) was found to contain the entire sequence of eabC. The open reading frame of the eabC gene and its deduced amino acid sequence are shown in Fig. 2. The eabC gene consists of 2400 bp that encode 800 amino acid residues. As shown in Fig. 2, the N-terminal 24-amino acid peptide of the native enzyme is found in residues 36–59. Residues 10–35 at the N terminus show an extended region of hydrophobicity as well as a predicted cleavage site after residue 35 as determined by the PSORT program, indicating a signal sequence for secretion into the culture medium. The mature protein consists of 765 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 87 kDa, which is very close to the value of 88 kDa estimated by SDS-PAGE for nE-ABase (Fig. 1). Relationship between the E-ABase Gene (eabC) and the CPE0329 Gene of C. perfringens Strain 13—A BLASTN search of eabC against the genome of C. perfringens strain 13 deposited in the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank revealed a 100% match with the CPE0329 gene, whose product was labeled as a hypothetical protein (20Shimizu T.

This finding validated the results of our cloning work and also established the product of the CPE0329 gene of C. perfringens strain 13 as E-ABase. Assignment of E-ABase to a New Glycoside Hydrolase Family, GH98 —To identify proteins with amino acid sequences related to E-ABase, the DNA and protein sequences of E-ABase were used as a query against the FASTA and BLAST Databases. The results of bioinformatics analysis revealed that the amino acid sequence of E-ABase does not bear any detectable similarity to any of the established glycoside hydrolase families. There are 97 public families of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy Database) to date (available at afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY).

Because cells with a disrupted B-MYB gene cannot be obtained, it is still unknown what is the critical function(s) exerted by B-MYB in mammalian cells. In this study we have observed that reducing B-MYB expression in primary human fibroblasts by using RNA interference results in a partial block of the cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and cell death. Surprisingly, suppressing B-MYB transcriptional activity with a dominant-negative molecule is without effect, suggesting that its transactivating function is not essential. Only human or murine fibroblasts exposed to high temperature are sensitized to cell death in the presence of dominant-negative B-MYB. This correlates with temperature-dependent binding of endogenous B-MYB to transcriptional regulatory elements of the stress-related gene ApoJ/clusterin. We find that regulation of ApoJ/clusterin by B-MYB is a pro-survival response to thermal stress. Thus, B-MYB is regulated by temperature to activate genes required for cell survival.

B-MYB is a transcription factor that has been implicated in regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and transformation (1Joaquin M. Watson R.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2389-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is homologous to the prototype member of the MYB family, the protooncogene c-MYB, which is prevalently expressed in hematopoietic cells where it controls their differentiation and proliferation (2Oh I.H. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3017-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). All MYB family members bind to the same consensus sequence (C/T)AACNG in in vitro assays, reflecting their high homology in the DNA-binding domain region (2Oh I.H. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3017-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). It is possible, however, that the different MYB proteins regulate different genes in vivo after post-translational modifications or interaction with specific cofactors (3Ness S.A. Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2003; 31: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 4Rushton J.J. Davis L.M. Lei W. Mo X. Leutz A. Ness S.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). B-MYB can be considered the most intriguing member of the MYB family because it seems to exert a fundamental function in mammalian development. Firstly, unlike c-MYB and A-MYB, it is expressed ubiquitously. Secondly, B-MYB inactivation in mice causes an early block of development, without formation of the inner cell mass and normal blastocyst (5Tanaka Y. Patestos N.P. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28067-28070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This absolute requirement mirrors the high levels of B-MYB, but not of c-MYB and A-MYB, mRNA observed in mouse embryonal stem cells (5Tanaka Y. Patestos N.P. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28067-28070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). B-MYB expression is detected in virtually all mammalian cancer cell lines, and its locus at 20q13 is often amplified or overexpressed in a wide variety of human neoplasias (6Tanner M.M. Grenman S.

Pathol. 2004; 203: 780-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, the B-MYB gene is not transcribed in differentiated adult mammalian tissues. Although B-MYB mRNA expression is found in highly proliferating human progenitor cells induced to differentiate along the erythroid or granulocytic/monocytic lineage in vitro (10Sala A. Watson R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), B-MYB protein expression is barely detectable in the spleen and totally absent in the liver, lungs, kidney, adrenal gland, and sympathetic ganglia of adult mice. 1G. Santilli, R. Schwab, R. Watson, C. Ebert, B. J. Aronow, and A. Sala, unpublished data. Initial characterization in cancer cell lines or in immortalized fibroblasts suggested that B-MYB may be required for cell proliferation or survival. B-MYB expression in fibroblasts is growth-regulated and peaks at the G1/S transition phase of the cell cycle (11Lam E.W.F. Robinson C. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1885-1890PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of B-MYB has been shown to increase the number of cells in the S phase (12Sala A. Casella I. Bellon T. Calabretta B. Watson R.J. Peschle C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9363-9367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). On the other hand, antisense inhibition of B-MYB results in suppression of clonogenesis (13Sala A. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10415-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Lin D. Fiscella M. O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Chen M. Luo L.L. Sala A. Travali S.

Whether or not this latter effect is due to a block of cell proliferation or enhanced cell death has not been investigated. Overexpression of B-MYB often promotes cell survival; it has been shown to counteract apoptosis of lymphoid cell lines in culture and to up-regulate the antiapoptotic BCL2 gene (16Grassilli E. Salomoni P. Perrotti D. Franceschi C. Calabretta B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2451-2456PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic B-MYB expression confers protection to doxorubicin killing in neuroblastoma cells (17Cervellera M. Raschella G. Santilli G. Tanno B. Ventura A. Mancini C. Sevignani C. Calabretta B. Sala A.

In monocytic cells, B-MYB suppresses apoptosis and sustains proliferation in the presence of the terminal differentiating cytokine interleukin 6 (18Bies J. Hoffman B. Amanullah A. Giese T. Wolff L.B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 355-363PubMed Google Scholar). In one recent study, Liu and Greene have observed that MYB proteins are induced by DNA damage to promote neuronal cell death (19Liu D.X. Greene L.A. Neuron. 2001; 32: 425-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, in our laboratory we have found no evidence of c-MYB, A-MYB, or B-MYB activation in DNA-damaged neuronal cancer cell lines suggesting that more studies are needed to fully understand the role of MYB genes in neuron demise (20Pagnan G. Sala A. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 336: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). MYB consensus sequences have been found in promoter or enhancer elements of a number of genes. B-MYB can directly or indirectly transactivate ApoJ/clusterin, MYC, B-MYB itself, HIV LTR, collagen, FGF, UCHL1, IGFBP5, BCL2, and a plethora of potential B-MYB, c-MYB, and A-MYB target genes have been identified by microarrays (4Rushton J.J.

The retinoblastoma family member p107 is found associated with B-MYB in vivo and in vitro, and these proteins behave like mutual antagonists (10Sala A. Watson R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22Sala A. De Luca A. Giordano A. Peschle C. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7923-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). More recently, B-MYB has been shown to bind to and suppress the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57kip2 (30Joaquin M. Watson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44255-44264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These studies unveil a high level of complexity of B-MYB functions and support a model in which B-MYB regulates cell homeostasis by modulating both gene transcription and the activity of other proteins. One outstanding question is whether B-MYB transcriptional activity is essential or dispensable for its positive effects in the cell cycle. Many of the putative B-MYB target genes have been shown to regulate cell growth and survival, and it is reasonable to assume that at least part of B-MYB biological function is dependent on its transcriptional activity. However, potential target genes were studied in largely nonphysiological contexts, and binding of B-MYB to putative regulatory regions was almost exclusively studied in vitro. The absence of viable mouse embryonic cells with a disrupted B-MYB gene has hampered more rigorous studies of its functions in vivo. In the study presented here we have used different approaches to investigate the role of B-MYB in normal mammalian fibroblasts. Our results highlight its unsuspected role in the stress response. Cell Cultures, Transfections, and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—WI38 and NIH3T3 cells were purchased from ATTC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer's instructions. Infections were carried out as described previously (31Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). In brief, Phoenix A/E cells were grown to 80% confluency and transfected with the MIGR1 retroviral constructs by the ProFection system following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Retrovirus-containing supernatants were collected 48 h after transfections and used to infect cells. To obtain a homogeneous population of transduced cells, GFP 2The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DTT, dithiothreitol; RT, reverse transcription; CHIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; CMV, cytomegalovirus. -positive cells were isolated by FACS sorting. FACS analysis was carried out by fixing the cells with 70% ethanol at 4 °C overnight. Cells were stained with 0.5 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Luciferase assays were carried out by transfecting 500 ng of the reporter vector-pGL2-ApoJ/clusterin promoter or its relative with mutated MYB-binding site (17Cervellera M. Raschella G. Santilli G.

For heat shock experiments, subconfluent cells in sealed flasks or plates were transferred into water baths at 42, 45, or 47 °C for 30 min and then returned to the incubator. Luciferase assays were carried out 6–8 h after heat shock following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). RNA Interference—Synthetic double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Qiagen. Bioinformatic programs available on the internet were used to determine the potentially most effective B-MYB target sequences. Targeting sequence information is available upon request. Two double-stranded oligonucleotides were assessed for their ability to down-regulate B-MYB protein in fibroblasts. A RNAi oligonucleotide conjugated to fluorescein was also purchased to determine optimal uptake in NIH3T3 and WI38 cells. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 using a ratio of 1 μg of Lipofectamine for 2 μg of siRNAs. In these conditions we achieved a 70–80% transfection efficiency. Protein Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Total cellular proteins were extracted in PBS containing 500 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 and a tablet containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete-mini, Roche Applied Science). After incubation in ice, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation, diluted with 2 volumes of PBS, and incubated at different temperatures with or without DTT. Lysates were then dissolved in a buffer containing glycerol and 0.001% SDS for electrophoresis in native gels or dissolved in Laemmli buffer containing 1mm DTT for electrophoresis in SDS-containing gels. For tryptic digestions, nuclear extracts were prepared from NIH3T3 cells transfected with a B-MYB expression vector. Extracts were incubated at 45 °C for 1 h or at room temperature with or without DTT, diluted with water, and digested with 1 μg of trypsin for 30 min. Samples were boiled prior to fractionation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in PBS. Antibodies were incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer. We have generated and used a B-MYB monoclonal antibody that recognizes the carboxyl terminus of human and murine B-MYB. Actin and ApoJ/clusterin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. In most cases the same nitrocellulose membrane was stripped and used with different antibodies. Parallel blots were also used to avoid excessive stripping and reprobing. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—For semiquantitative RT-PCR, preliminary experiments were carried out to determine the linear range of amplification. Total cellular RNA (1 μg) from MEFs or NIH3T3 cells was reverse-transcribed using a reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 25 μl. PCR was carried out using 5 μl of the reverse transcriptase mixture in 1× polymerase buffer, 0.4 μm upstream primer, 0.4 μm downstream primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 2 units of Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science) in a total volume of 50 μl. PCR conditions for ApoJ/clusterin amplification were as follows: 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 58 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 28 cycles, followed by a final extension step of 7 min at 72 °C. The primers used were: ApoJ forward, 5′-ATGAAGATTCTCCTGCTGCG-3′; ApoJ reverse, 5′-CTTCACCACCACCTCAGTG-3′. Gel Shift—An oligonucleotide containing the B-MYB-binding site of the murine ApoJ promoter was end-labeled with T4 kinase and 32P. After purification, the probe was annealed to an excess of the minus strand. Oligonucleotides used were: + strand, 5′-ATGCGGTGAGCAGTTATTTACAGAAA-3′; –strand, 5′-TTTCTGTAAATAACTGCTCACCGCAT-3′. For the binding reaction, 100 ng of glutathione S-transferase proteins, 2 μlof1 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), and 1 μg of cold competitor were mixed to 10 × 104 cpm of the probe in 1× binding buffer at RT. The samples were loaded onto a non-denaturing 5% acrylamide mini gel (Bio-Rad), run at 100 V, dried, and exposed to an x-ray film. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (CHIP) Assays—CHIP assays were carried out as described with minor modifications (32Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In brief, fibroblasts grown in 10-cm2 dishes were cross-linked with formaldehyde for 15 min at RT. After the reaction was stopped with glycine, cell pellets were resuspended in 550 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer buffer, syringed up and down, and left on ice for 20 min. Chromatin was sheared by 6 cycles of sonication, 2 min each, at 50% power, on ice. After preclearing with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose, 1 μg of antibodies (B-MYB (N-19) or an IgG-matched TRAF antibody, both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and incubated 2 h to overnight at 4 °C. After washes, beads were eluted with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. Protein-DNA complexes were de-cross-linked at 65 °C for 5 h and ethanol-precipitated overnight. Pellets were resuspended in TE, digested with proteinase K, and phenol-extracted. Digested samples were ethanol-precipitated in the presence of glycogen, and DNA was resuspended in 30 μlof water. 5 μl of each sample was amplified with ApoJ/clusterin promoter-specific primers encompassing the B-MYB-binding site. siRNA Inhibition of B-MYB Expression in Normal Human Fibroblasts Causes Cell Death and a Partial Block in the G2 Phase of the Cell Cycle—We previously showed that antisense inhibition of B-MYB expression causes suppression of the clonogenic potential of BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts (13Sala A. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10415-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In that study we did not establish whether the decrease of colony formation was due to a defect in cell proliferation or survival. RNA interference is thought to be more effective than antisense methods and has been now widely applied to knockdown gene expression. We decided to study the effect of suppressing B-MYB expression with siRNAs in human embryonal fibroblasts. WI38 cells are normal human fibroblasts with a finite lifespan. B-MYB expression in this cell line is low compared with cancer cells or with immortalized murine fibroblasts such as NIH or BALB/c 3T3 cells (data not shown). Therefore, WI38 cells are potentially useful for RNA interference experiments aiming to assess the biological consequences of inhibiting B-MYB expression. Cells were exposed to a scrambled control or two independent siRNA molecules targeting different regions of the B-MYB mRNA. Both sequences caused down-regulation of B-MYB protein, although sequence 1 (seq 1) was slightly more efficient than sequence 2 (seq 2) (Fig. 1). Ablation of B-MYB expression caused a marked increase in sub-G1 DNA, suggesting that targeted cells may undergo apoptosis (Fig. 1). Observation under the microscope confirmed that cells were rounding-up and detaching from the plate (data not shown). Notably, cell death was accomplished at the expense of G1, suggesting that a pool of cells did not re-enter the cell cycle after G2 and mitosis. In agreement with this notion, more cells were arrested in the G2/M phase in the presence of sequence 1 (Fig. 1). These phenotypic effects were proportional to the degree of B-MYB down-regulation achieved with the different siRNAs. The interferon response gene OAS1 or the growth suppressor gene p53 was not induced by siRNA treatment, suggesting that off-target effects were unlikely (data not shown). A Transcriptional Dominant-negative B-MYB Construct Is without Effect in Unstressed Fibroblasts but Promotes Cell Death in Cells Subjected to Heat Shock—The RNAi experiments have clearly established that B-MYB is required for the progression and survival of human fibroblasts during the cell cycle. We hypothesized that B-MYB could transcriptionally regulate the expression of critical target genes. If this were the case, inhibiting its transcriptional activity should result in a phenotype similar to that obtained with RNAi experiments. The B-MYB DNA-binding domain can behave as a transcriptional dominant-negative molecule to inhibit MYB-dependent gene expression (Fig. 2). We have infected human WI38 or murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts with a bicistronic retroviral vector (MIG-R1) containing GFP and the B-MYB DNA-binding domain (MIG-DN-BMYB). Surprisingly, fibroblasts infected with the MIG-DN-BMYB construct proliferated normally (Table I). We hypothesized that subjecting fibroblasts to stress could disclose the prosurvival function of B-MYB transcriptional activity. Although control or dominant-negative expressing cells were viable at physiological temperature, they were more prone to die at high temperature, with WI38 cells being especially sensitive to temperature stress (Fig. 3, A and B). The expression of the dominant-negative protein was confirmed by Western analysis (Fig. 3C). These experiments suggest that B-MYB transcriptional activity is dispensable for proliferation but required for stress survival.Table ICell cycle analysis of WI38 fibroblasts infected with control vector (MIG) or B-MYB dominant-negative vector (MIG-DBD)Sub-G1G1SG2/MMIGExp. 13.348.933.114.2Exp. 23.054.529.712.5MIG-DBDExp.16.3644.334.814.4Exp. 22.1551.632.214.3 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Dominant-negative B-MYB sensitizes fibroblasts to thermal injury. NIH3T3 (A) or WI38 (B) cells were transduced with the empty or MIG-R1 vector containing dominant-negative B-MYB (DN). After FACS sorting, GFP-positive cells were exposed to high temperature where indicated (HS), and the percentage of cell death was scored 24 h later by trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Error bars indicate the S.D. from the counts of four independent wells. These assays were repeated twice with similar results. C, NIH3T3 cells infected with the MIGR1 or the dominant-negative B-MYB vector (MIG-DN) were subjected to Western blot analysis with a B-MYB antibody. Expression of the truncated B-MYB protein was observed in MIG-DN-infected cells only.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) B-MYB Transactivating Activity Is Enhanced by Thermal Stress and Is Essential for Temperature-dependent Transcription of the B-MYB-Target Gene ApoJ/clusterin in Mammalian Fibroblasts—The B-MYB requirement in heat-shocked cells suggests that it could be activated by thermal stress. We exposed fibroblasts to heat shock and observed B-MYB protein by Western blot. B-MYB protein levels did not consistently change with temperature in WI38 or NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). We observed, however, in several independent assays that the molecular weight of B-MYB increased slightly after 30 min of heat shock in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 4). This preceded induction of the stress-activated protein ApoJ/clusterin that occurred 2 h after heat shock (Fig. 4). Expression of the related members c-MYB and A-MYB was undetectable in fibroblasts (not shown). To monitor transcriptional activity of endogenous B-MYB in different conditions, we transfected WI38 fibroblasts with the human ApoJ/clusterin promoter, linked to the luciferase gene, with or without a mutation in the B-MYB-binding site. We have previously shown that exogenous B-MYB can efficiently transactivate only the ApoJ/clusterin promoter with an intact B-MYB-binding site. In fact, mutation of the B-MYB-binding site causes a 70% reduction of promoter transactivation (17Cervellera M. Raschella G. Santilli G. Tanno B. Ventura A. Mancini C. Sevignani C. Calabretta B. Sala A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21055-21060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ApoJ/clusterin promoter is activated by high temperatures, and mutation of the B-MYB-binding site caused a significant reduction of promoter activation (Fig. 5A). To prove that B-MYB, and not another MYB family member, is involved in thermal regulation of the ApoJ/clusterin promoter, we have monitored its activity in the presence of the siRNA sequence 1. Heat-shock activation of the ApoJ/clusterin promoter is substantially abolished in the presence of B-MYB, but not control, siRNA, suggesting that thermal regulation of the ApoJ/clusterin promoter is, at least in part, dependent on the presence of endogenous B-MYB (Fig. 5B). To further confirm these results, NIH3T3 cells were infected with the dominant-negative B-MYB construct or its corresponding empty vector. Cells were FACS-sorted, and ApoJ/clusterin mRNA levels were monitored in GFP-positive cells by semiquantitative RT-PCR before or after heat shock. ApoJ/clusterin mRNA was induced by thermal stress in control cells, as expected (Fig. 6). In contrast, ApoJ/clusterin gene expression was totally suppressed in the presence of the dominant-negative B-MYB construct (Fig. 6).

The sulfate activation pathway in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is organized into a single complex that consists of three catalytic activities: an adenylyl-transferase (ATP sulfurylase), encoded by cysD, that catalyzes nucleophilic attack of sulfate at the α-phosphorous of ATP to produce adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS); 1The abbreviations used are: APS, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; mGMPPNP, 3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-2′-deoxy-β,γ-imidoguanosine 5′-triphosphate; PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; PEP, phosphoenol pyruvate; SAC, sulfate-activating complex. a GTPase, encoded by cysN (a member of the EF-Tu family) (1Leipe D.D.

The organism-dependent fusion of the early cysteine biosynthetic enzymes is particularly interesting, given that the E. coli ATP sulfurylase forms a tight, catalytically coupled complex with the last enzyme in the cysteine biosynthetic pathway, O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (3Wei J. Tang Q.X. Varlamova O. Roche C. Lee R. Leyh T.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8493-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The self-organizing tendencies in the pathway hint at a yet higher order assembly of the cysteine biosynthetic enzymes. The bifunctional ATP sulfurylase from E. coli has been studied in some detail; however, the trifunctional complexes have not yet been mechanistically characterized. This study explores the mechanism of the sulfate-activating complex (SAC) from M. tuberculosis. The World Health Organization estimates that M. tuberculosis now infects 30% of the world's population and that new infections are incurred at a rate of ∼1 individual/s (4Nunn P. Scand. J. Infect.

Mycobacteria evade destruction in the phagosome by inhibiting fusion with lysosomes, which furnish the bactericides needed to kill the organism (6Britton W.J. Roche P.W. Winter N.

Once engulfed by the macrophage, mycobacteria encounter signals that cause it to adjust its mRNA and protein levels. Among the small group of proteins up-regulated in the macrophage environment are the sulfate-activating enzymes (7Triccas J.A. Gicquel B. Immunol.

The link(s) between up-regulation of the sulfate activation pathway and the bacterium's ability to adapt to the phagosome environment is not fully understood; however, intriguing correlates have been established. Intracellular levels of mycothiol, the mycobacterial glutathione-surrogate, correlate with significant changes in the antibiotic resistance of the organism and its ability to survive an oxidative environment such as that presented by the phagosome (9Rawat M.

Purification of SAC—The recombinant mycobacterial sulfate-activating complex was expressed in BL21(DE3) and purified as described previously except for the addition of an anion exchange purification step (Q Sepharose Fast-Flow resin) after size exclusion chromatography (18Pinto R. Tang Q.X. Britton W.J. Leyh T.S. Triccas J.A. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 1681-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). SAC eluted in a linear salt gradient (0–0.7 m KCl, 50 mm Hepes, 1.0 mm EDTA, pH/K+ = 8.0, 4 °C) at 0.30 m KCl. SAC purity was judged, using Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels, to be ≥95%. Initial Rate Studies—Typically, the initial rate of reaction was determined at the 16 conditions defined by a 4 × 4 matrix of substrate concentrations in which each substrate was varied from ∼0.2 to 5.0 times its Km. Rates were measured during the first ∼7% of reaction. Triplicate rate measurements were averaged and then fit by the method of weighted least squares using the SEQUEN program (19Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). The conditions specific to the individual studies are described below. Due to the low turnover and high substrate affinities associated with the forward and reverse APS kinase reactions, it was not possible to perform experiments in which all of the APS and PAPS concentrations were in vast excess over that of the active site. Simulations at the lowest concentrations of these substrates used in the experiments predict that ∼15% of the substrate is bound to the enzyme (binary and ternary complexes) during the measurements, which leads to an ∼8% increase in Km and an ∼2% decrease in kcat. The ATP Sulfurylase Forward Reaction—The kinetic constants for ATP and SO4 were determined at a saturating concentration of GTP (1.0 mm, 83× Km). The data and experimental conditions are contained in Fig. 1A and the corresponding legend. The Km for GTP was determined in an initial rate experiment in which the concentration of GTP was varied from 0.2× to 5× Km at a near-saturating concentration of ATP and SO4. The pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase coupling system regenerates GTP from the GDP produced by the hydrolysis reaction and ATP from the ADP formed by the phosphorylation of APS. Hence, the overall reaction oxidizes two equivalents of NADH per molecule of APS and/or PPi formed, and the measured initial rates were halved in the analysis of the data. The GTPase assay conditions were as follows: SAC (1.2 μm), SO4 (4.0 mm, 10× Km), MgATP (1.0 mm, 28× Km), GTP (2.5, 3.8, 7.2, and 65 μm), Hepes/K+ (50 mm, pH 8.0), KCl (50 mm), MgCl2 ([nucleotide] + 1.0 mm), PEP (2.0 mm), NADH (0.3 mm), pyruvate kinase (10 units/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (20 units/ml), inorganic pyrophosphatase (1.0 unit/ml), and T = 25 ± 2 °C. The ATP Sulfurylase Reverse Reaction—ATP synthesis was monitored continuously, using fluorescence spectroscopy (λex = 339 nm, λem = 460 nm), by coupling its formation to the reduction of NADP+ using hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The assay conditions were as follows: SAC (2.0 μm), APS (5, 10, 29, and 90 μm), PPi (140, 240, and 700 μm), Hepes (50 mm, pH/K+ = 8.0), KCl (50 mm), MgCl2 ([nucleotide] + 1.0 mm), PEP (2.0 mm), NADP+ (0.25 mm), glucose (2.0 mm), hexokinase (36 units/ml), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (26 units/ml), and T = 25 ± 2 °C. The APS Kinase Forward Reaction—Initial rates were measured in triplicate at the 16 conditions described by a 4 × 4 matrix of APS and ATP concentrations. Given the very low Km APS (0.30 ± 0.01 μm; Table I), the subsaturating APS concentrations needed to execute the initial rate titrations were too low to produce measurable quantities of product. To circumvent this problem, APS was regenerated from PAPS by the 3′-nucleotidase, HAL2 (17Spiegelberg B.D. Xiong J.P. Smith J.J. Gu R.F. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13619-13628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). ATP was regenerated from ADP using pyruvate kinase, and the reactions were continuously monitored at 339 nm by coupling the regeneration of ATP to the oxidation of NADH using lactate dehydrogenase. The assay conditions were as follows: SAC (0.05 μm), APS (64, 94, 177, and 1600 nm), ATP (16, 24, 45, and 400 μm), pyruvate kinase (10 units/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (10 units/ml), HAL2 nucleotidase (0.5 unit/ml), Hepes (50 mm, pH/K+ = 8.0), PEP (1.0 mm), NADH (0.25 mm), MgCl2 (2.0 mm), and T = 25 ± 2 °C.Table IInitial rate kinetic constants for the SAC reactionsDomainSubstrateKiaSteady-state affinity of substrate for the unliganded form of the enzyme, E.KmbSteady-state affinity of substrate for E·S, where S is the complementary substrate.kcatμmμmmin-1ATP sulfurylaseForwardATPcDetermined at a fixed, near-staurating concentration of GTP (1.0 mm, 83× Km).84 ± 235 ± 17.8 ± 0.1SO4cDetermined at a fixed, near-staurating concentration of GTP (1.0 mm, 83× Km).940 ± 30390 ± 5GTPdDetermined at fixed, near-saturating concentration of ATP (1.0 mm, 28× Km) and SO4 (4.0 mm, 10× Km).NDeND, not determined.12 ± 1ReverseAPS51 ± 311 ± 16.0 ± 0.1PPi1500 ± 200350 ± 20APS kinaseForwardAPS0.15 ± 0.010.30 ± 0.0135 ± 1ATP39 ± 377 ± 3ReversePAPS21 ± 119 ± 11.7 ± <1ADP140 ± 4130 ± 3a Steady-state affinity of substrate for the unliganded form of the enzyme, E.b Steady-state affinity of substrate for E·S, where S is the complementary substrate.c Determined at a fixed, near-staurating concentration of GTP (1.0 mm, 83× Km).d Determined at fixed, near-saturating concentration of ATP (1.0 mm, 28× Km) and SO4 (4.0 mm, 10× Km).e ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The APS Kinase Reverse Reaction—The data and experimental conditions associated with this experiment are contained in Fig. 1B and its legend. The progress curves were initiated at a near-saturating concentration of PAPS and contained varying initial ADP concentrations. APS was calculated using the change in absorbance at 365 nm (ϵ*365 nm = 6.82 mm–1 cm–1) associated with the production of 2 mol of ATP per mole of APS formed. The PAPS concentration was calculated by subtracting the concentration of APS formed at a given point in the reaction from the initial concentration of PAPS. ADP concentration was determined by adding the concentration of APS formed (which is converted to ADP by the coupling system) to the initial ADP concentration. The initial rates were calculated from the slopes of lines (–d[S]/dt) taken over intervals that spanned 1.5–2% of the overall reaction. The center points of the slopes were used to calculate the substrate concentrations. Typically, 200 V and [S] pairs were extracted from the 10,000–15,000 data points associated with a single progress curve, and kinetic parameters were obtained by statistically fitting the pairs to a model for a sequential reaction mechanism using the SEQUEN program (19Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). The APS Kinase Forward Reaction using GTP—The initial rate measurements were performed at a fixed, saturating concentration of APS (50 μm, 330× Ki APS). GDP formation was monitored continuously at 339 nm using the enzymes pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, which couple the regeneration of GTP to the oxidation of NADH. The assay conditions were as follows: SAC (0.75 μm), APS (50 μm), GTP (25, 50, 100, 200, and 500 μm; 0.3–6× Km app), pyruvate kinase (10 units/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (20 units/ml), Hepes (50 mm, pH/K+ = 8.0), PEP (1.0 mm), NADH (0.25 mm), MgCl2 ([nucleotide] + 1.0 mm), and T = 25 ± 2 °C. The Native Molecular Mass of SAC—The molecular mass of SAC was determined by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) calibrated with molecular mass standards (ferritin, 440 kDa; catalase, 232 kDa; albumin, 67.0 kDa; ovalbumin, 43.0 kDa; and chymotrypsinogen A, 25.0 kDa). The standards yielded an excellent, linear standard curve when log molecular mass was plotted versus elution volume. The column, sample, and running buffer (50 mm Hepes/K+, 50 mm KCl, pH/K+ = 8.0) were equilibrated at 25 ± 2 °C. The apparent native molecular mass of SAC is 307 ± 7.0 kDa. The Catalytic Behavior of the M. tuberculosis SAC—To define and compare the catalytic behavior of the M. tuberculosis SAC domains, their forward and reverse reactions were characterized using initial rate measurements. With the exception of the reverse APS kinase reaction, the experimental designs are classical (see “Materials and Methods”); a representative dataset is shown in Fig. 1A. The best-fit initial rate parameters obtained from these studies are compiled in Table I. The reverse APS kinase reaction is complicated by the well-established, potent inhibition by APS (20Hommes F.A. Moss L. Touchton J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 924: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 21Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2113-2123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Satishchandran C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15012-15021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP sulfurylase from E. coli, which does not have an APS kinase domain, can be used to remove APS and mitigate inhibition; however, this requires the presence of PPi and produces a second equivalent of ATP for each APS kinase turnover. The ATP is then converted by the coupling enzymes (hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) into ADP, which is a substrate for the APS kinase reaction. Thus, the substrate concentration increases as the system turns over. If the ADP concentration is saturating at t = 0 of reaction, an increasing ADP concentration will not influence the reaction rate significantly, and linear 1/v versus 1/[PAPS] data are expected. Alternatively, if the ADP concentration is subsaturating, the velocity will increase until saturation is achieved, predicting a double-reciprocal plot that is non-linear at subsaturation and becomes linear as the enzyme nears saturation with ADP. An initial rate, double-reciprocal progress curve of the APS-forming reaction catalyzed by the SAC APS kinase domain is shown in Fig. 1B. Both products of the reaction, APS and ATP, are removed by coupling enzymes, ATP sulfurylase from E. coli K-12 (present in excess over the SAC ATP sulfurylase domain) and hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which stoichiometrically couple NADP+ reduction to the ATP-to-ADP conversion (23Storer A.C. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Initial rates are obtained from progress curve tangents calculated as slopes taken over suitably small regions of the curve (1–2%). The slope center points correspond to specific concentrations of PAPS and ADP that can be calculated from the optical density changes associated with NADP+ reduction (see “Materials and Methods”). The initial rate and concentration data extracted from the curves were fit, using the SEQUEN program of Cleland, and the best-fit constants (Table I) were used to simulate the data (Fig. 1B, solid lines). Comparison of the kinetic constants of the SAC domains reveals that the system is beautifully poised to capture the APS released by the ATP sulfurylase domain at the APS kinase active site and produce PAPS. During initial rate turnover at saturating ATP, the catalytic efficiency of PAPS synthesis is 5800× that of APS synthesis, i.e. (V/Km APS)/(V/Km SO4). The affinity of APS for the active site of APS kinase is several hundred-fold greater than that for ATP sulfurylase, and PAPS is formed 6-fold faster than ATP. Thus, notwithstanding issues of competitive binding and inhibition, APS released by the ATP sulfurylase domain will kinetically partition almost exclusively toward PAPS synthesis. The efficiencies (V/Km APS) of APS kinases that are not attached to their ATP sulfurylase counterparts, E. coli (∼108m–1 s–1) (22Satishchandran C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15012-15021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Penicillium chrysogenum (1.4 × 107m–1 s–1) (21Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2113-2123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are substantially greater than that of the M. tuberculosis APS kinase domain (1.9 × 106m–1 s–1). It may be that the efficiency demands placed on the co-localized systems, in which APS is released in the near vicinity of the APS kinase active site, are less than those placed on the systems that scavenge APS from the cellular milieu. The SAC Quaternary Structure—The apparent native molecular mass of SAC, determined by size exclusion chromatography, is 307 ± 7.0 kDa (see “Materials and Methods”). The molecular masses of the SAC subunits, calculated from the translated DNA sequences, are 34,900 Da (CysD) and 67,800 Da (CysN/C); the mass of a single CysD·CysN/C heterodimer is 103,000 Da. The simplest interpretation of this data, which is supported by visual inspection of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels, is that the native complex is a trimer of heterodimers (18Pinto R. Tang Q.X. Britton W.J. Leyh T.S. Triccas J.A. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 1681-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); however, the presence or absence of a single additional CysD subunit in the complex cannot be ruled out. It is interesting to note that the tertiary structure of the M. tuberculosis system differs from that of E. coli, which is a tetramer of heterodimers. The Absence of an E·P Intermediate—During its catalytic cycle, APS kinase from E. coli K-12 is phosphorylated at Ser109 (22Satishchandran C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15012-15021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Satishchandran C. Hickman Y.N. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11684-11688Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Satishchandran C. Markham G.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 378: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The γ-phosphoryl group of ATP is transferred to and from this active site Ser (26Lansdon E.B. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13672-13680Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) in a kinetically competent fashion. Labeling of the enzyme is stoichiometric with the active site, and E·P survives size exclusion chromatography and overnight storage without detectable loss of label or transfer function. APS kinase from P. chrysogenum shares a great deal of sequence similarity with the E. coli enzyme (46% identity, 63% similarity); yet mutagenic substitution of Ser107, the Penicillium homologue of Ser109 (E. coli), with alanine has little effect on catalysis (27MacRae I.J. Rose A.B. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28583-28589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These and other results led to the conclusion that the Penicillium enzyme does not form the E·P intermediate. Thus, the field is left with the interesting conundrum of extremely similar enzymes that utilize very different catalytic mechanisms. To further characterize the SAC complex and add to what is known about the isozyme-specific formation of the E·P intermediate, an attempt was made to phosphorylate the SAC APS kinase domain under conditions that stoichiometrically label APS kinase from E. coli. To ensure that the labeling conditions were reliable, the E. coli APS kinase was labeled (22Satishchandran C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15012-15021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a positive control experiment. The proteins were incubated with the labeling reagents and then separated from them using size exclusion chromatography. The protein concentration and E-33P profiles of the column eluants were constructed and compared (Fig. 2). The profiles associated with the E. coli labeling experiment were coincident, and the active site of the enzyme was 33P-labeled with ∼96% efficiency. In contrast, 33P was not detected in the fractions containing SAC. The maximum level of labeled SAC that could have gone undetected in this experiment is <1% of an active site equivalent. The M. tuberculosis and E. coli systems clearly behave quite differently toward E·P formation, and it appears that, like its Penicillium counterpart, the M. tuberculosis system does not form the intermediate; however, E·P formation at very low levels cannot be ruled out by this experiment. The GTP Hydrolysis/APS Synthesis Stoichiometry—GTP hydrolysis is the only reaction of the SAC complex that produces Pi and can be monitored using a continuous Pi detection system (28Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The presence of inorganic pyrophosphatase produces two equivalents of Pi from the PPi formed by the APS synthesis reaction. By comparing the initial rate of Pi formation in the presence and absence of inorganic pyrophosphatase, the stoichiometry of GTP hydrolysis and APS synthesis can be determined. This experiment was performed under the following conditions: SAC (0.44 μm), inorganic pyrophosphatase (0 or 3.2 units/ml), purine nucleoside phosphorylase (40 units/ml), ATP (1.0 mm, 29× Km), GTP (1.0 mm, 83× Km), Na2SO4 (7.6 mm, 19× Km), MgCl2 (3.0 mm), 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methyl-purine riboside (0.40 mm), Hepes (50 mm), pH/K+ = 8.0, and T = 25 ± 2 °C. The ratio of turnover in the presence of inorganic pyrophosphatase (0.77 ± 0.01 s–1) to that in its absence (0.26 ± 0.01 s–1) is 3.0; hence, the stoichiometry of GTP hydrolysis to APS synthesis is 1:1. Whereas the results suggest that the two reactions are tightly coupled, they do not rule out the possibility of coupled and uncoupled reactions whose net behavior adventitiously produces a 1:1 stoichiometry. The Chemical Potentials of GTP Hydrolysis and APS Synthesis Are Coupled—In the absence of GTP, APS synthesis is extremely unfavorable, Keq ∼10–7 to 10–8 at near-physiological conditions (29Leyh T.S. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 515-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The SAC APS kinase domain couples APS synthesis to PAPS formation, and PAPS synthesis is sufficiently favorable (Keq = 2 × 103, 50 mm Hepes, pH/K+ = 8.0, T = 25 °C) (22Satishchandran C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15012-15021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to produce detectable, albeit low, quantities of [35S]PAPS from ATP and 35SO4 in the absence of GTP; reactions initiated at 4.0 mm ATP and 0.50 mm35SO4 produce a maximum of ∼2% conversion of SO4 to PAPS, and APS levels under these conditions are too low to detect (see Fig. 3A). In the absence of GTP, the SAC concentrations needed for the PAPS synthesis reactions to reach completion within several hours are higher than the quantities of product formed. The 35SO4 assays measure the total product formed (i.e. enzyme-bound and solution-phase product); thus, it is possible that a significant fraction of the product is bound to SAC, a situation that prevents using the reaction end points to calculate solution-phase equilibrium constants. To assess whether the majority of the PAPS formed in the reaction is in solution, the progress curve was determined as a function of SAC concentration. SAC-bound PAPS will titrate with SAC concentration. If the SAC·PAPS complexes represent a significant fraction of the total PAPS formed at the reaction end point, the progress curve plateau will increase with increasing SAC c"
