Analysis of furin promoters revealed the presence of putative binding sites for hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a transcription complex that plays a pivotal role in cellular adaptation to hypoxia. In fact, we demonstrate herein that the levels of fur mRNA, encoding furin, are remarkably increased upon hypoxic challenge. Cotransfection of a HIF-1α dominant negative form in wild-type (WT) cells or transfection of a furin promoter-reporter gene in HIF-1-deficient cells indicated the requirement of HIF-1 for furin promoter activation by hypoxia. Direct HIF-1 action on the furin promoter was identified as a canonical hypoxia-responsive element site with enhancer capability. The hypoxic/HIF-1 regulation of furin correlated with an increased proteolytic activation of the substrates membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase and transforming growth factor-β1. Our findings unveil a new facet of the physiological consequences of hypoxia/HIF-1, through enhanced furin-induced proteolytic processing/activation of proproteins known to be involved in tumorigenesis.

The induction of angiogenesis and cell invasion by hypoxia is a hallmark of pathological processes such as wound healing, arthritis, and solid tumor formation. Oxygen deprivation induces gene expression of many polypeptides that participate in the establishment of new blood vessels and in the invasion phenotype (1Semenza G. Biochem.

Several of these proteins are first synthesized as inactive propeptides that require maturation through limited endoproteolytic cleavage after a sequence of two or more basic residues (Lys or Arg) to acquire activity.

In the past decade, a novel family of seven closely related mammalian subtilisin/kexin-like serine proteases with this cleavage specificity was discovered. They are grouped under the generic name of proprotein convertases (PCs) and include PC1/PC3, PC2, PC4, PC5/PC6, PC7, and PACE-4. Within this family, selected members exhibit a tissue-specific distribution, such as PC1, PC2, and PC4, whereas furin, PACE-4, PC5/PC6, and PC7 are expressed in a broad range of tissues and cell lines (for review see Refs. 15Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar and 16Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Among these convertases, furin is the first and so far the best-characterized enzyme. The biological importance of this PC arises from the large number and variety of bioactive proteins and peptides that can be generated through its activity, including key elements involved in normal and pathophysiological conditions such as cancer.Recent studies indicate that tumor growth and malignant tumor phenotypes are regulated by the action of PCs, especially furin. In fact, inoculation of immunodeficient mice with furin-inhibited cells resulted in delayed and lower incidence of tumor development as well as reduced tumor size compared with wild type (WT) cells. Interestingly, these observations were accompanied by a significant decrease in tumor vascularity (14Khatib A.M. Siegfried G. Prat A. Luis J. Chretien M. Metrakos P. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30686-30693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In normal tissues, furin is detectable at very low levels, however, elevated expression of this convertase has been reported in a variety of human cancers, including breast tumors, head and neck tumors, glyoblastomas, and lung cancer (17Bassi D.E.

Invest. 1987; 80: 1545-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furin expression has also been correlated with cancer aggressivity and was therefore proposed to have significant prognostic value (21Khatib A.M. Siegfried G. Chretien M. Metrakos P. Seidah N.G. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 1921-1935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This suggests that the potentially deleterious effects of furin on the maintenance of cellular homeostasis under physiological conditions are avoided by very low cellular levels of expression.The mechanisms by which the fur gene, encoding furin, is differentially expressed and regulated in tumoral conditions are still poorly understood. It is known that at least three distinct promoters, namely P1, P1A, and P1B, direct its transcription (22Ayoubi T.A. Creemers J.W. Roebroek A.J. Van de Ven W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9298-9303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fur transcripts generated differ in their 5′-end but are all translated from the same AUG, giving rise to identical furin proteins. The P1A and P1B promoters resemble housekeeping genes with multiple Sp-1 binding sites. On the other hand, the P1 promoter bears inducible gene features with the presence of TATA and CAAT elements in the proximal region and has been shown to be transactivated by C/EBP-β, GATA-1, and Smads (22Ayoubi T.A.

Pathol. 2001; 158: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Interestingly, computer-assisted analysis of the furin promoters uncovered the presence of putative hypoxia responsive elements (HREs) also found in many genes regulated by oxygen deprivation such as vascular endothelial growth factor, erythropoietin, and glucose transporter-1 (25Chen C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29083-29089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Transactivation of such cis-acting elements is mediated by the specific binding of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). This transcription factor comprises HIF-1α and HIF-1β/ARNT subunits, which are members of the basic-loop-helixperiod, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, single-minded protein family (29Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4974) Google Scholar). Both subunits are constitutively expressed, but HIF-1α is maintained at low cellular levels in normoxic conditions through proteasomal degradation via the action of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1α escapes degradation and translocates to the nucleus where it heterodimerizes with HIF-1β (30Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J.

Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3828) Google Scholar). The consensus HIF-1 binding sequence (HBS) was determined to be 5′-XCGTG-3′ (X = A/G) (36Jiang B.H. Rue E. Wang G.L. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17771-17778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), although recent reports have indicated that, for optimal hypoxic induction, several HIF-1-inducable genes require a HRE composed of a HBS and a HAS (HIF-1 ancillary sequence) (5′-CAC(G/A)(G/T/C)-3′), which forms an imperfect inverted repeat (37Kimura H. Weisz A. Ogura T. Hitomi Y. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K. D'Acquisto F. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2292-2298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).Based on the presence of cis-acting HRE elements within their promoter/enhancer regions, HIF-1 transcriptionally activates a variety of genes that can convey survival and proliferation of tumor cells by mediating angiogenesis, glucose uptake, invasion, and metastasis, thereby promoting tumorigenesis. In accordance with this, nuclear accumulation of HIF-1 protein has been reported recently in human common cancer and cell lines, including, head and neck, glioblastomas, breast, colon, pancreatic, and prostate (38Zhong H. De Marzo A.M. Laughner E. Lim M. Hilton D.A. Zagzag D. Buechler P. Isaacs W.B. Semenza G.L. Simons J.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5830-5835PubMed Google Scholar, 39Talks K.L. Turley H. Gatter K.C.

Cox G.J. Gatter K. Millard P. Fuggle S. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2493-2497PubMed Google Scholar), which are pathological conditions where furin was also found to be overexpressed. This finding, coupled with the observation that fur promoters contain putative HRE motifs, prompted us to investigate the regulation of the fur gene by HIF-1. In this report, we demonstrate that the expression of furin mRNA is rapidly increased in oxygen-deprived cells through HIF-1, which binds to a functional consensus HRE sequence in the fur P1 promoter. Increased furin expression in hypoxic cells impacted the maturation of furin substrates MT1-MMP and TGFβ. These findings provide a mechanism by which furin could be increased in solid tumors, and thereby impact the bioavailability of tumorigenic factors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—The hepatoma cell lines HepG2 (human) and Hepa-1 c1c7 (mouse) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The Hepa-1 c4 cells, derived from Hepa-1 c1c7 cells, were a generous gift from Dr. Oliver Hankinson (University of California at Los Angeles). These cell lines were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 40 μg/ml garamycin (Schering Canada Inc., Pointe-Claire, Québec, Canada) in a humidified 95% air/5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C (normoxic condition). For hypoxic experiments, cells were serum-starved and placed in a sealed humidified chamber maintained at 1% O2, 5% CO2 and balance in N2 for different time-periods as indicated in figure legends.Northern Blot Analysis—HepG2 cells were serum-starved and cultured in normoxia or hypoxia for time periods ranging from 4 to 24 h. Total cellular RNA was extracted from cells according to the previously described TRI-Reagent protocol (41Chomczynski P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15 (536 –537): 532-534PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously using furin, PACE-4, and PC-7 rat riboprobes (42Blanchette F. Day R. Dong W. Laprise M.H. Dubois C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1974-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). An 18 S probe was used as an internal control.Western Blot Analysis—HepG2 cells were cultured in serum-free MEM in normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 16 h. 800,000 Hepa-1 c1c7 and c4 cells/10 cm plates were infected as described previously (23Laprise M.H. Grondin F. Cayer P. McDonald P.P. Dubois C.M. Blood. 2002; 100: 3578-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with adenovirus encoding human pro-TGFβ1, α1-antitrypsin PDX (α1-PDX), or green fluorescent protein only (control virus) and cultured in normoxia or hypoxia for 16 h. Total cell lysates and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (43Blanchette F. Rivard N. Rudd P. Grondin F. Attisano L. Dubois C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33986-33994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The membranes were probed overnight with antibodies directed against human MT1-MMP hinge region (Research Diagnostics Inc.) or human latency-activated peptide (TGF-β1) (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Secondary antibodies were peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (1:2500) IgG or anti-goat IgG (1:8000), respectively (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were developed using ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences).Plasmids for Transient Transfection—The human fur promoter-luciferase constructs pGL2-Basic, pGL2-P1, pGL2-P1-SacI, pGL2-P1-NheI, pGL2-P1-KpnI, pGL2-P1A, and pGL2-P1B were generously provided by Dr. Torik A. Y. Ayoubi (University of Leuven and Flanders Interuniversity, Belgium). The pCDNA3-HIF-1α, pCDNA3-HIF-1β, and pCDNA3-HIF-1α DN have been described previously (44Richard D.E. Berra E. Pouyssegur J. J.

Zanger K. Monden T. Safer J.D. Hollenberg A.N. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24927-24933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, twenty-four hours prior to transfection, cells were plated at a density of 125,000 cells/well in 6-well plates. Cells were transfected with 2–4 μg of plasmids/well, as indicated in the figure legends. Twenty hours following transfection, cells were serum-starved 3–4 h prior to overnight exposure to the hypoxic or normoxic environment. Cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity as described previously (47Blanchette F. Rudd P. Grondin F. Attisano L. Dubois C.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The control pGL2-Basic vector was routinely used as an internal control of transfection. Values were normalized for transfection efficiency as described previously (23Laprise M.H. Grondin F. Cayer P. McDonald P.P. Dubois C.M. Blood. 2002; 100: 3578-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 47Blanchette F. Rudd P. Grondin F. Attisano L. Dubois C.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Site-directed Mutagenesis—The H4-HRE and H5-HRE sequences located at position –1011 and –863, respectively, within the P1-NheI promoter were mutated by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Distinct mutations were generated by replacing the H4 motif 5′-TAGTGAC-3′ by 5′-TAGCAAC-3′ and/or the H5 motif 5′-GGCGTGGTGGCTCACGCC-3′ by 5′-GGCAACGTGGCTCGCTTC-3′. Each mutation was verified by direct sequencing.Plasmid Construction—The oligonucleotides encoding four tandem repeats containing the wt H5-HRE sequence 5′-GACCGGGCGTGGTG-GCTCACGCCTAATA-3′ or the H5-HRE sequence mutated (same mutations as in site-directed mutagenesis) of the fur-P1 promoter were synthesized (Invitrogen), annealed, and cloned into the KpnI-NheI sites of pGL3-TK-basic vector (generously provided by Dr. Negishi, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, NC).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously with the addition of 1 mm Na3VO4 and 50 nm MG-132 in extraction buffer (48Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9142) Google Scholar, 49McDonald P.P. Fadok V.A. Bratton D. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6164-6172PubMed Google Scholar) followed by a 2-h dialysis step against modified Z-100 buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 nm MG-132) (50Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar). Gel mobility retardation assays (EMSA) were performed as described previously with few modifications (48Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9142) Google Scholar, 49McDonald P.P. Fadok V.A. Bratton D. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6164-6172PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of nuclear extracts was incubated with 4 × 105 cpm of 32P-labeled double-stranded probes in modified Z-100 buffer containing 7.5 mm dithiothreitol and 0.1 μg of calf thymus DNA/20 μl (Sigma). The sequences of the sense strands of the oligonucleotides used for EMSA were as follow: 5′-CGGGCACGGTGGCTCACGCCTGTA-3′ (H1), 5′-GTGTCTGCTC-CCCAAGTGCATAAG-3′ (H2), 5′-GCTAATGTTTAGTGACTAGGGAT-GCGAC-3′ (H4), 5′-GGACCGGGCGTGGTGGCTCACGCCTAATA-3′ (wt H5), 5′-GGACCGGGAAAGGTGGCTCAACCCTAATA-3′ (mut H5), and 5′-GGACCGGGCGTGGTGGCT-3′ (H5-HBS). Mouse anti-HIF-1α (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) and isotype-matched (Sigma) antibodies were used in supershift assays.Measure of Bioactive TGFβ1—Supernatants of Hepa-1 c1c7 and c4 cells infected with adenovirus were assayed for TGFβ1 using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for bioactive TGFβ1 (R&D Systems). Supernatants were activated 10 min at 80 °C before TGFβ1 detection.RESULTSKinetics of Furin, PACE-4, and PC7 Expression following Hypoxia Exposure—Hypoxia is a common tumorigenesis enhancer, mostly owing to its impact on gene expression of many angiogenic and invasion-related mediators, some of which are natural substrates for the convertase furin. Because of the emerging role of proprotein convertases (furin) in tumorigenesis, we postulated that furin could be regulated by hypoxia to achieve adequate proteolytic maturation of angiogenic and/or tumorigenic substrates. To test this hypothesis, HepG2 cells were cultured in normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions for time periods ranging from 4 to 24 h. Results expressed in Fig. 1 indicate that hypoxia is a strong inducer of furin mRNA accumulation in HepG2 cells with a maximum increase of 18-fold observed at 24 h, whereas PACE-4 and PC7 mRNA levels were mostly unaffected. Extended cell culture in hypoxic conditions (48 h) resulted in no additional increase in furin mRNA levels (data not shown). These results indicated that furin, but not the other convertases PACE-4 or PC7, is a hypoxia-inducible gene.A similar increase in furin mRNA by hypoxia was also observed in other cell lines, including RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages, primary rat synoviocytes, as well as mouse Hepa-1 c1c7 hepatoma cell line (data not shown). This indicates that the regulation of the furin gene by hypoxia is extended to various cell types and species.HIF-1 Is Required For the Hypoxic Response of the fur P1 Promoter—Computer-assisted analysis of fur promoter sequences revealed the presence, within all three fur promoters, of putative HIF-1 binding sites (HBS), including several closely spaced HIF-1 ancillary sequences (HAS) characteristic of HIF-1-regulated genes (Fig. 2A) (37Kimura H. Weisz A. Ogura T. Hitomi Y. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K. D'Acquisto F. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2292-2298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This suggested that HIF-1 may regulate fur promoter activity under hypoxic conditions. To address this possibility, HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with either P1, P1A, or P1B promoter-Luc constructs, or with the promoter-less vector pGL2-Luc. Cells were incubated overnight under normoxic or hypoxic conditions, and luciferase activity was measured. As illustrated in Fig. 2B, luciferase activity of the P1 promoter was increased 3.1-fold under low oxygen tension, whereas such a treatment had a milder influence on the P1A or P1B promoters, with 1.8- and 1.4-fold induction, respectively. Further studies were therefore performed with the most hypoxia-sensitive P1 promoter.Fig. 2Effect of hypoxia onfurP1, P1A and P1B promoter activity.A, schematic representation of localization and sequence of the HRE motifs present in the 5′ noncoding exons 1, 1A, and 1B of the human fur gene.

As demonstrated in Fig. 3B, deletion constructs up to position –1221 demonstrated comparable increases in luciferase activity following oxygen deprivation. However, further deletion of the promoter to position –413 strongly reduced the hypoxic response, indicating the presence of hypoxia sensitive site(s) within the –1221 to –413 region.Fig. 3Functional analysis offurP1 5′-deletion constructs.A, schematic representation of putative HIF-1 recognition sequences present in fur P1 promoter fragments shortened in 5′ accordingly to endogenous SacI, NheI, or KpnI restriction sites. Base positions are numbered relative to the TATA box. B, HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg/well fur P1, P1-SacI, P1-NheI, or P1-KpnI constructs. Cells were cultured 16 h in normoxia or hypoxia before luciferase activity measurement. The induction ratio of the luciferase activity by hypoxia is indicated for each luciferase promoter construct. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E., n = 9. C, HepG2 cells were transiently cotransfected with 2 μg/well fur P1, P1-SacI, P1-NheI, or P1-KpnI constructs and either 1 μg/well of each vector encoding HIF-1α and HIF-1β or 2 μg/well empty pCDNA3 vector.

Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E., n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In parallel experiments, the reporter constructs were cotransfected with vectors encoding HIF-1α and HIF-1β. Results presented in Fig. 3C indicate that HIF-1 stimulates at similar levels P1 promoter activity up to deletion –1221, however, the following deletion fragment abrogated the response to HIF-1. Thus, the response of P1 promoter fragments to HIF-1 overexpression correlates with their response to hypoxia, suggesting that one or more hypoxia response elements within P1 promoter are HIF-1 binding elements.To determine whether HIF-1 is indeed required for transcriptional activation of the fur-P1 promoter by hypoxia, we either cotransfected a dominant negative isoform of HIF-1α in HepG2 cells or the P1-promoter-luc construct was transfected into the Hepa-1 c4 hepatoma cell line, which lacks HIF-1β/ARNT protein and thereby cannot form the HIF-1 transcription complex (51Wood S.M.

Results in Fig. 4 (A and B) indicated that forced expression of the dominant negative HIF-1α isoform in HepG2 cells greatly reduced both P1 and P1-NheI transactivation in response to hypoxic challenge.

JNK1 and JNK2 are functionally redundant for the expression of TNF-α, IL-6, and nitric oxide, whereas JNK2 but not JNK1 is essential for IL-12 production. The ERK signaling pathway is not involved in TNF-α and nitric oxide production, but, interestingly, negatively regulates the expression of IL-6 and IL-12. Furthermore, p38 is critical for the production of IL-6 and IL-12 but is only marginally required for the production of TNF-α and nitric oxide.

The data have important implications for the development of therapeutics for malaria treatment. The process of malaria pathogenesis is very complex and, despite malaria being one of the most extensively studied infectious diseases during the past decades, the precise molecular basis for disease progression remains poorly understood.

These include the rapid destruction of infected and uninfected erythrocytes, dyserythropoiesis, metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, and adherence of infected erythrocytes to the microvascular capillary, vascular obstruction, and production of high levels of proinflammatory mediators in response to parasitic factors (1Miller L.H.

Med. 1989; 320: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). In the case of Plasmodium falciparum infection, adherence of the parasite-infected erythrocytes to the microvascular capillaries of various organs and in the dermal tissues potentially promotes pathogenesis because of the high parasite burden and severe proinflammatory responses in localized areas, leading to endothelial damage and organ dysfunction (15Hommel M. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1993; 87: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, up-regulation of endothelial cell adhesion molecules in response to TNF-α potentially augments the adherence, spiraling the destruction of the endothelia and causing organ-related pathological conditions (20Schofield L. Novakovic S. Gerold P. Schwarz R.T. McConville M.J. Tachado S.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1886-1896PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the underlying mechanism that controls the expression of the proinflammatory responses to P. falciparum components is likely to provide therapeutic avenues for the prevention of malaria pathogenesis. Although it is known that excessive production of proinflammatory mediators is a key process that contributes to the falciparum malaria pathogenesis, very little is known about the nature of various potential ligands of the parasite and cell-signaling mechanisms involved. However, about a decade ago, it was shown that the glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) of P. falciparum could induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide in macrophages (21Schofield L. Hackett F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). GPIs administered to animals have been shown to cause transient pyrexia and hypoglycemia, cachexia, and death in galactosamine-sensitized animals, the events that are reminiscent of acute malaria (21Schofield L. Hackett F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Thus, GPIs have been proposed as the dominant parasite factors responsible for malaria pathogenesis. Later studies have shown that the GPIs of P. falciparum can induce the expression of iNOS, up-regulate the expression of intracellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and E-selectin in endothelial cells, implicating these processes in malaria pathogenesis (20Schofield L. Novakovic S. Gerold P. Schwarz R.T. McConville M.J. Tachado S.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1886-1896PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, it was proposed that parasite GPI-induced proinflammatory responses involve the activation of protein kinase C and protein-tyrosine kinase-signaling pathways that collabo-ratively activate NF-κB/c-Rel, which translocates to the nucleus, initiating the expression of proinflammatory molecules (22Tachado S.D. Gerold P. McConville M.J. Baldwin T. Quilici D. Schwarz R.T. Schofield L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1897-1907PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been postulated that the two signaling pathways are activated by the distinct structural elements of GPIs, namely the conserved glycan and diacylglycerol moieties, respectively (23Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Several hypotheses, including the insertion of GPIs into cell membrane microdomains rich in GPI-anchored proteins and membrane perturbation, hydrolysis of GPIs, and internalization of the diacylglycerol moiety or GPI translocation across the cell membrane initiating the activation of protein kinase C-dependent second messengers, have been proposed for cell signaling by GPIs (23Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, in recent years it has become clear that the proinflammatory responses by the innate immune system are mediated through the recognition of specific molecular patterns of microorganisms by the TLR family of proteins (24Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4708) Google Scholar, 25Akira S. Curr. Opin.

Recently, cell signaling by GPIs of Trypanosoma cruzi to produce proinflammatory mediators has been shown to be through the exclusive recognition of TLR2 (27Campos M.A. Almeida I.C. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Valente E.P. Procopio D.O. Travassos L.R. Smith J.A. Golenbock D.T. Gazzinelli R.T. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). In the preceding paper (28Krishnegowda G. Hajjar A.M. Zhu J.Z. Douglass E.J. Uematsu S. Akira S. Wood A.S. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8606-8616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) we have demonstrated that P. falciparum GPI-induced proinflammatory responses in macrophages proceed through the recognition of mainly TLR2 and to a lesser extent through TLR4, and the cell signaling involves the activation of MAPK-, ERK-, p38-, JNK-, and NF-κB-signaling pathways. A number of studies have shown that ERK-, p38-, JNK-, and NF-κB-signaling pathways are activated by TLR/MyD88-mediated cell signaling in response to various ligands of pathogenic organisms (29Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Science. 2003; 300: 1524-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). However, the requirement of various signaling molecules of these pathways for the expression of cytokines appears to be dependent on the nature of ligands and the host cell types. In many cases the reported results are controversial (30Dong C. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). With regard to GPIs, a recent study reported the requirement of ERK, p38, and NF-κB pathways with GPIs of T. cruzi; however, the information is very limited (31Ropert C. Almeida I.C. Closel M. Travassos L.R. Ferguson M.A. Cohen P. Gazzinelli R.T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3423-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the requirement of the MAPK- and NF-κB-signaling pathways for the P. falciparum GPI-induced expression of proinflammatory mediators using macrophages from mice deficient in the activation of ERK1/ERK2, JNK1, and JNK2 and by using specific inhibitors. Our data show that the ERK1/ERK2-, p38-, and JNK1/JNK2-signaling molecules and NF-κB family proteins are differentially involved in the GPI-induced production of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12, and nitric oxide by macrophages.

Mice—NF-κB1/p105 knock-out mice and the corresponding wild type control mice (B6.129PF2/J) and MAPK8 (JNK1) and MAPK9 (JNK2) knock-out mice and the corresponding wild type control mice (C57BL6/J) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories. The animals were maintained in a germ-free environment, and the animal care was in accordance with the Institutional Guidelines of the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. Preparation of L929 Cell Supernatant—L929 cells were cultured in DMEM, 5% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% l-glutamine in roller flasks at 37 °C for 4-5 days. The supernatant were collected, centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 20 min, and used as a source of macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Preparation of Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages—Bone marrow-derived macrophages were obtained as described (32Norbury C.C. Hewlett L.J. Prescott A.R. Shastri N. Watts C. Immunity. 1995; 3: 783-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Briefly, the murine bone marrow was flushed from the femurs of mice with DMEM, 10% FBS, and penicillin/streptomycin. The tissue debris in each case was removed by centrifugation at 300 rpm, and cells were spun down at 1200 rpm. The cell pellets were washed twice with DMEM, 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin and dispersed in DMEM, 20% FBS, 30% L929 cell supernatant, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and cultured at 37 °C for 2 days. The non-adherent cells were removed, and the adherent cells were cultured by changing the medium every 2 days. Seven days later the macrophages were harvested using phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, containing 10 mm EDTA and 20% FBS and used for stimulation with the parasite GPIs. Stimulation of Macrophages with P. falciparum GPIs—Freshly harvested macrophages were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates (2.5 × 104 cells/well) and cultured overnight in DMEM, 10% FBS, and penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were treated with varying amounts of GPIs coated onto gold particles as described in the preceding paper (28Krishnegowda G. Hajjar A.M. Zhu J.Z. Douglass E.J. Uematsu S. Akira S. Wood A.S. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8606-8616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Cells treated with uncoated gold particles were used as controls. For inhibition studies the inhibitors were added to the culture medium 1 h before the addition of GPIs. In some experiments cells were primed with IFNγ (100 units/ml) before stimulation with GPIs. The culture supernatant were collected at the indicated time points and stored at -70 °C until used for cytokine and nitric oxide measurements. For the analysis of signaling proteins, macrophages in 24-well microtiter plates (0.5 × 106 cells/well) were cultured overnight in DMEM, 0.5% FBS and then stimulated with 200 nm GPIs. For inhibition studies cells were treated for 1 h with appropriate inhibitors before stimulation with 200 nm GPIs. At various time points, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, containing 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100). The lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for Western blotting. For RT-PCR analysis of gene transcription, macrophages in 24-well plates (1 × 106 cell/well) were cultured overnight in DMEM, 0.5% FBS, then stimulated with 200 nm GPIs in DMEM, 10% FBS; at various time points culture supernatants were removed, and cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. Cells were dissolved in Trizol, and total RNA was isolated and used for cDNA preparation. Cytokine and Nitrite Measurement—The TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12 (p40) in the culture supernatants of macrophages stimulated with GPIs were determined by sandwich ELISA with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and 3,3′,5,5′,-tetramethylbenzidine color reagent using the Duoset ELISA development kit (R&D Systems). After stopping the color development with 1 m sulfuric acid, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured with SpectraMax Plus384 plate reader (Molecular Devices). The cytokine concentrations were calculated with reference to the standard curves. The nitrite in the macrophage culture supernatants was assayed by microcolorimetric assay using the Griess reagent (33Drapier J.C. Wietzerbin J. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The absorbance at 540 nm was determined, and the nitrite concentrations were estimated with reference to a graph generated using a standard solution of sodium nitrite. Cell Viability Assay—The viability of cells treated with various inhibitors was assessed by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) method as described previously (34Miller R.A. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulis D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunolgy. 1. Greene Publishing Associations, Inc., and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, NY1994Google Scholar). With all inhibitors, cells treated for 4 h were 100% viable. During 48 h of incubation, SB203580, SB202190, SP600125, and SN50 did not show noticeable cytotoxicity, whereas PDTC, PD98059, and UO126 showed 5-10% cell toxicity. Western Blotting—The macrophage lysates obtained as outlined above were made to 1× with respect to the SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The protein bands in the gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated with either anti-peptide or phospho-specific antibodies in the above buffer. After washing the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, treated with chemiluminescent substrate system (LumiGLO from KPL), and exposed to x-ray films. RT-PCR and Real-time PCR—Total RNA samples from wild type and gene knock-out mice were reverse-transcribed using the oligo-dT14 primers. Aliquots of cDNA samples were analyzed for Tpl2 or Egr-1 by PCR. cDNA samples were also analyzed for TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12 (p40), and iNOS genes by real-time PCR. The primers used were: Tpl2, forward 5′-CAT GCA GAC AGG CAC CCC AC-3′, reverse 5′-CGA ACA ATA TTG AAG TAG CCA GC-3′; Egr-1, forward 5′-CCA CCT TAC CAC CCA CAT CCG-3′, reverse 5′-GTG CTG AAG GAG CTG CTG ACG-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward 5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′, reverse 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′. The conditions used for PCR were 40 cycles of 94 °C denaturation for 30 s, 50 °C annealing for 30 s, and 72 °C extension for 60 s. Primers for real-time PCR analysis of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12 (p40), iNOS, and β-actin transcripts were designed with Primer Express® Software version 2.0 from Applied Biosystems and custom-synthesized by Invitrogen: TNF-α, forward 5′-TGT CTA CTC CCA GGT TCT CTT CAA G-3′, reverse 5′-TGA CTT TCT CCT GGT ATG AGA TAG CA-3′; IL-6, forward 5′-AAG TCG GAG GCT TAA TTA CAC ATG T-3′, reverse 5′-AAG TGC ATC ATC GTT GTT CAT ACA-3′; IL-12 (p40), forward 5′-ACA AGA CTT TCC TGA AGT GTG AAG C-3′, reverse 5′-GCT CTT GAT GTT GAA CTT CAA GTC C-3′; iNOS, forward 5′-AAA GTG ACC TGA AAG AGG AAA AGG A-3′, reverse 5′-TTG GTG ACT CTT AGG GTC ATC TTG TA-3′; β-action, forward 5′-ACC CTA AGG CCA ACC GTG AA-3′, reverse 5′-CCG CTC GTT GCC AAT AGT GA-3′. The real-time PCR was performed in an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using QuantiTect™ SYBR® Green PCR kit from Qiagen. Amplification was performed in a total volume of 25 μl containing 2× QuantiTech SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, 0.6 μm each primer, 100 ng of cDNA. The PCR conditions used were 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The increase in cytokine mRNA in GPI-stimulated macrophages compared with unstimulated cells was calculated from threshold cycle number (Ct) according ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system Version 1.6 software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Previous studies have reported that 0.1-1 μmP. falciparum GPIs are required for the efficient production of TNF-α in macrophage cell lines, and an appreciable level of nitric oxide was evident only at >1 μm GPIs (22Tachado S.D.

A genome-wide approach using cDNA microarray technology was used to profile the changes in the expression of all genes in yeast that respond to the exogenous presence of inositol and choline. We report that the global response to inositol is completely distinct from the effect of choline. Whereas the effect of inositol on gene expression was primarily repressing, the effect of choline on gene expression was activating. Moreover, the combination of inositol and choline increased the number of repressed genes compared with inositol alone and enhanced the repression levels of a subset of genes that responded to inositol. In all, 110 genes were repressed in the presence of inositol and choline. Two distinct sets of genes exhibited differential expression in response to inositol or the combination of inositol and choline in wild-type cells. One set of genes contained the UASINO sequence and were bound by Ino2p and Ino4p. Many of these genes were also negatively regulated by OPI1, suggesting a common regulatory mechanism for Ino2p, Ino4p, and Opi1p. Another nonoverlapping set of genes was coregulated by the unfolded protein response pathway, an ER-localized stress response pathway, but was not dependent on OPI1 and did not show further repression when choline was present together with inositol. These results suggest that inositol is the major effector of target gene expression, whereas choline plays a minor role.

Phospholipids are the key structural elements of membrane-bounded organelles and play important roles in signaling and membrane trafficking pathways. Each membrane compartment is composed of a unique set of phospholipids whose biophysical properties contribute to the function of each organelle. Phospholipid metabolism is highly regulated by the cell, ensuring the biogenesis and growth of membranes by coordinating the relative rates of synthesis of individual phospholipids with numerous factors, such as the availability of exogenous supplies of phospholipid precursors, growth stage, and membrane trafficking (1Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In many organisms, the regulation of lipid biosynthetic pathways is achieved through control of transcriptional regulatory networks. For example, lipid homeostasis in animal cells is controlled through the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) pathway (3Rawson R.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a major control mechanism for the coordinated synthesis of inositoland choline-containing phospholipids is the precise transcriptional control of genes for many of the enzymes required for phospholipid synthesis (2Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 4Henry S.A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

The synchronized expression of these genes requires the participation of Ino2p and Ino4p, basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that bind as a heterodimer to a cis-acting element in the promoters of these genes called UASINO, as well as Opi1p, a negative regulator of transcription (6Hoshizaki D.K.

Biol. 1998; 61: 133-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent collaborative study involving our laboratory has begun to reveal how this regulation is controlled by ongoing lipid metabolism (26Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). When inositol is added to the medium of growing cells, a dramatic change to the pattern of phospholipid synthesis is induced. Phosphatidic acid (PA), 1The abbreviations used are: PA, phosphatidic acid; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; UPR, unfolded protein response; YPD, yeast extract/peptone/dextrose; ORF, open reading frame; CDP-DAG, CDP-diacylglycerol; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propane sulfonic acid; PI, phosphatidylinositol; DAG, diacylglycerol; PC, phosphatidylcholine. a precursor for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol, is rapidly consumed. This drop in PA levels is directly sensed by Opi1p, a component of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized lipid sensing complex (27Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), causing it to dissociate from the ER and translocate to the nucleus, where it participates in the repression of target genes. Although Opi1p does not directly interact with the UASINO sequence (28Graves J.A. Henry S.A. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1485-1495PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wagner C. Blank M. Strohmann B. Schuller H.J. Yeast. 1999; 15: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it is thought to interact with Sin3p (15Wagner C. Dietz M. Wittmann J. Albrecht A. Schuller H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a histone deacetylase that functions as a global transcriptional repressor, and Ino2p, which potentially targets it to the promoters of UASINO-containing genes. Thus, the transcriptional regulation of UASINO-containing genes responds not to inositol directly but instead to a metabolic signal induced when inositol participates in lipid metabolism. Cells grown in the absence of inositol also induce the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway (30Cox J.S. Chapman R.E. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The UPR pathway is an ER-localized signal transduction pathway that responds to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER as well as to secretory stress by up-regulating the expression of target genes (31Cox J.S. Shamu C.E. Walter P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 32Mori K. Ma W. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.

Although the mechanism for UPR induction under inositol-limiting conditions is unknown, Cox et al. (30Cox J.S. Chapman R.E. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) have suggested that the activation of the UPR might be directly involved in the mechanism by which INO1 transcription is activated. However, recent work from our laboratory has suggested that under certain conditions, UPR activation is not coupled to activation of UASINO-containing genes (35Chang H.J. Jones E.W. Henry S.A. Genetics. 2002; 162: 29-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Chang H.J. Jesch S.A. Gaspar M.L. Henry S.A. Genetics. 2004; 168: 1899-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although much study of the regulatory effects of inositol and choline has focused upon the transcription of UASINO-containing genes, their effects on the expression of other genes have been largely unexplored. A recent report (37Santiago T.C. Mamoun C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38723-38730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) examined the combined effects of inositol and choline on genome-wide expression in yeast, but the individual contributions of inositol and choline on gene expression were not explored. Because inositol and choline have distinct effects on different branches of phospholipid biosynthetic pathways (4Henry S.A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 133-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), an important unanswered question is whether the presence of these phospholipid precursors individually affects the expression of the same set(s) of genes. To identify all of the genes whose expression is regulated by inositol and choline, we carried out a genome-wide study using cDNA microarrays to find genes whose expression is regulated, both independently and jointly, by inositol and choline. We report that inositol and choline affect the expression of different sets of genes. Furthermore, we show that OPI1 primarily regulates genes that were previously shown by Lee et al. (38Lee T.I. Rinaldi N.J. Robert F. Odom D.T. Bar-Joseph Z. Gerber G.K. Hannett N.M. Harbison C.T. Thompson C.M. Simon I. Zeitlinger J. Jennings E.G. Murray H.L. Gordon D.B. Ren B. Wyrick J.J. Tagne J.B. Volkert T.L. Fraenkel E. Gifford D.K. Young R.A. Science. 2002; 298: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2393) Google Scholar) to contain a bound Ino2p and Ino4p, and these genes are distinct from those genes regulated by the UPR pathway. Our results indicate that inositol, not choline, is the major effector of Ino2p-Ino4p- and UPR-targeted gene expression. Together, these results suggest that distinct pathways contribute to regulate the expression of genes in response to changes in phospholipid metabolism induced by phospholipid precursors. Strains and Media—The wild-type strain BY4742 (MATα, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0) derived from S288C (39Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D.

Strains were maintained on yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD) plates (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% glucose, and 2% agar). All experiments were performed using chemically defined synthetic complete media (16Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3320-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 40Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. J. Biol.

Where indicated, media were supplemented with 75 μmmyo-inositol and/or 1 mm choline. Cell Growth—All cultures were grown in synthetic complete growth medium lacking inositol and choline or containing combinations of inositol and choline as indicated at 30 °C with shaking for at least 12 generations before harvesting at mid-log phase as described below. After overnight growth in indicated media at 30 °C, strains were diluted 1:50 in the indicated media and grown for 5–6 h at 30 °C. 250 ml of media were inoculated at an A600 of 0.01 and allowed to grow at 30 °C until the cultures reached mid-log phase growth (A600 = 0.5). Triplicates were prepared for each growth condition. Cells were harvested by filtration, immediately frozen on a dry ice/ethanol bath, and stored at -80 °C. Filtration was chosen as the method for harvesting cells because the recovery of the INO1 transcript was the most reproducible using this procedure. RNA Isolation and Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was extracted by the high temperature acid phenol method (41Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. J. Wiley, New York2001Google Scholar, 42Kohrer K. Domdey H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). For some experiments, total RNA was further purified using the RNeasy RNA purification kit (Qiagen, Inc.), or poly(A) RNA was isolated using oligo dT cellulose as described previously (41Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. J. Wiley, New York2001Google Scholar, 42Kohrer K. Domdey H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). mRNA was reverse-transcribed from 20 μg of purified total RNA using 2 μg of oligo dT (18-mer) primers (New England Biolabs) or 2.5 μg of mRNA using 3 μg of random (9-mer) primers (Invitrogen) by incubating with 400 units of SuperScript II (Invitrogen) plus 500 μm concentrations of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 200 μm amino-allyl dUTP (Sigma), and 300 μm dTTP in a final volume of 40 μl at 42 °C for 2 h. After cDNA synthesis, the remaining RNA was hydrolyzed by adding 10 μl of both 1 m NaOH and 0.5 m EDTA and incubating at 65 °C for 15 min followed by neutralization with 10 μl of 1 m HCl. The resulting cDNAs were purified using the QIAQuick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Inc.), substituting kit buffers with KPO4 buffers. Purified cDNAs were labeled with monofunctional reactive Cy3 or Cy5 dye esters (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of Na2CO3 pH 9.0, for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently quenched with 1 m NH2OH. After an additional QIAQuick purification, 20 pmol of Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNA probes were combined and hybridized to Corning CMT Yeast-S288c Gene Arrays (version 1.32) in 5× SSC, 25% formamide, 2.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C for 14–16 h. After washing, hybridized microarray slides were simultaneously scanned with lasers at 532- and 635-nm bandwidths using a GenePix 4000B array scanner (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Statistical Analysis—Three replicates were analyzed for each experimental condition. Image analysis for each array was processed using the GenePix Pro 4.0 (Axon Instruments, Inc.) software package, which produces (R, G) fluorescence intensity pairs for each gene. After image acquisition, individual data spots on each microarray were visually inspected for size, signal-to-noise ratio, background level, and uniformity. Using these quality control criteria, about 30% of the spots for each triplicate set of experiments were discarded because of poor spot quality, a conventional practice for microarray data analysis (43Wang X. Hessner M.J. Wu Y. Pati N. Ghosh S. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Normalization was conducted as follows: let M = log2(R/G), A = 0.5* log2(R*G). The log ratio M is known to be dependent on overall spot intensity A (44Yang Y.H. Dudoit S. Luu P. Lin D.M. Peng V. Ngai J. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (2834) Google Scholar). To remove this systematic variation, intensity-dependent normalization was conducted for each array replicate. The intensity-dependent trend was fitted using the LOWESS fit function (45Dudoit S. Yang Y.H. Callow M.J. Speed T.P. Statistica Sinica. 2002; 12: 111-139Google Scholar) in S-PLUS, after which the log ratio values (M) were normalized by subtracting the trend values. The student t test was performed on normalized M, for each gene for which three high quality replicates were available using the null hypothesis of no change in expression (i.e. normalization to M = 0). A conservative significance level of p value equal to 0.025 corresponding to a false detection rate of q = 0.075 was chosen. Hence the percentage of false positives among the significant tests is controlled to be at most 7.5%, a conservative approach that is expected to reduce false positive identifications to near zero.

U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9440-9445Crossref PubMed Scopus (7169) Google Scholar) for details on relating adjusted p values to false detection rate and the expected number of false positive tests. The t statistic was computed for each gene, and genes were then ranked according to their p values. Genes were considered to have differential expression in the red channel versus the green channel (or vice versa) if they exhibited a 2-fold change and also had a p value below 0.025. Northern Slot Blot Analysis—Approximately 250 ng of unfractionated mRNA was heated at 65 °C for 15 min in 3 volumes of denaturing buffer (66% formamide, 7% formaldehyde, 26 mm MOPS, 66 mm sodium acetate, and 1.3 mm EDTA), placed on ice after addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 20× SSC, and spotted on BrightStar-Plus (Ambion, Inc.) nylon membranes using a manifold slot blot apparatus as described previously (41Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. J. Wiley, New York2001Google Scholar). Strand-specific 32P-labeled riboprobes were synthesized from plasmids pJH310-INO1 (16Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. Mol. Cell.

Garfinkel), pSJ29-KAR2, pSJ30-PDI1, pSJ31-VTC3 and pSJ32-HO by in vitro transcription according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega). pSJ29-KAR2 was constructed by PCR-amplifying the KAR2 ORF and inserting the 878-bp HindIII-XbaI fragment into pGEM1 (Promega). pSJ30-PDI1 was constructed by PCR-amplifying the PDI1 ORF and inserting the 861-bp HindIII-SalI fragment into pGEM1. pSJ31-VTC3 was constructed by PCR-amplifying the VTC3 ORF and inserting the 703-bp PstI-XbaI fragment into pGEM1. pSJ32-HO was constructed by PCR-amplifying the HO ORF and inserting the 365-bp PstI-BamHI fragment into pGEM1. Membranes were hybridized with either INO1, KAR2, PDI1, VTC3, HO, ACT1, Ty1, or Ty2 probes in formamide hybridization buffer and washed to a final stringency of 0.2× SSC/0.1% SDS at 60 °C as described previously (16Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3320-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 41Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. J. Wiley, New York2001Google Scholar). Quantitation was performed by analysis on a STORM 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with ImageQuant software. The data were normalized by dividing the total counts per minute for the INO1, KAR2, PDI1, VTC3, HO, Ty1, or Ty2 probe by the total counts per minute for the ACT1 probe and expressed as the fraction of the amount of mRNA from cells grown in the absence of inositol and choline. Construction of Gene Disruption Alleles—Complete disruptions of VTC1, VTC3, and VTC4 genes were constructed by PCR-mediated gene replacement as described previously (48Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar) in the wild-type strain BY4742. The plasmid pFA6a-His3MX6 (kind gift of M. Longtine) was used as a template to generate PCR fragments for the gene disruptions. The entire open reading frame of each gene was replaced with the HIS3 marker gene. Histidine prototrophs were screened by colony PCR to verify integration at the correct genetic locus. Assays for Ino-and Opi-Phenotypes—To test for Ino- phenotypes, strains were grown to mid-log phase in synthetic complete media containing 75 μm inositol, washed once with water and 10-fold serial dilutions spotted on plates containing synthetic complete medium lacking inositol. Strains were incubated for 3 days at 18 °C, 24 °C, 30 °C, and 37 °C. To test for Opi- phenotypes (49Greenberg M.L. Reiner B. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1982; 100: 19-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Swede M.J. Hudak K.A. Lopes J.M. Henry S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), strains were grown as described above and spotted on plates containing synthetic complete medium lacking inositol and incubated at 30 °C and 37 °C for 2 days. The plates were then sprayed with a suspension of a diploid tester strain (AID) homozygous for ino1 and ade2 and incubated for an additional 2 days. Global Analysis of Inositol and Choline on Gene Expression in Yeast—Previous studies have shown that the presence of phospholipid precursors in the medium of logarithmically growing cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae regulates the transcriptional response of a number of genes. These genes include those encoding the structural enzymes for phospholipid biosynthesis (4Henry S.A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 133-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as genes encoding protein folding chaperones induced by the UPR pathway (51Chapman R. Sidrauski C. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 459-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to identify, in a comprehensive manner, the complete set of genes whose expression levels change in response to the presence or absence of the phospholipid precursors inositol and choline using cDNA microarray technology. The cDNA microarray experiments performed in this study are shown in Table I and are summarized below. First, to determine the individual effects of inositol and choline on genome-wide expression, the relative mRNA abundance from cells grown in the presence of either inositol or choline was measured by comparing with transcript levels from cells grown in the absence of both inositol and choline (Table I, experiments 1 and 2). Next, to characterize the combined effects of inositol and choline on genome-wide expression, the relative mRNA abundance from cells grown in the presence of both inositol and choline was compared with transcript levels from cells grown in the absence of inositol with or without choline (Table I, experiments 3 and 4). For every experiment, fluorescently labeled cDNA probes were synthesized from RNA extracted from cells grown to mid-logarithmic phase in chemically defined synthetic media and competitively hybridized to commercial spotted cDNA microarrays containing 6135 unique Saccharomyces cerevisiae open reading frames (ORFs). Each experiment was performed in triplicate. To assess which ORFs showed differential regulation from each experiment, rigorous statistical criteria were used as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In brief, after normalization, the ratio for each spot from the array that showed a p value ≤0.025 over three replicates was considered to be differentially expressed. After statistical analysis, data collected from these experiments were compared and analyzed as described below. The complete data set is available at our laboratory website (www.mbg.cornell.edu/Henry_Lab.cfm).Table IList of experiments performed in this studyNo.Experiment nameExperimental sampleReference sample1Inositol-dependentWild-type I+C-Wild-type I-C-2Choline-dependentWild-type I-C+Wild-type I-C-3Inositol + choline dependent (i)Wild-type I+C+Wild-type I-C-4Inositol + choline dependent (ii)Wild-type I+C+Wild-type I-C+5OPI1 dependent (+ Inositol)opi1Δ I+C-Wild-type I+C-6OPI1 independent (- Inositol)opi1Δ I-C-Wild-type I-C-7opi1Δ controlopi1Δ I+C-opi1Δ I-C- Open table in a new tab In the first experiment (Table I, experiment 1), which measured the independent effects of inositol on genome-wide expression, a total of 32 genes showed a 2-fold or greater change in expression that met our statistical criteria (Fig. 2A). Among these genes, 29 were down-regulated in the presence of inositol compared with cells grown in its absence. These genes are listed in Table II. As expected, the transcript levels of numerous genes previously shown to be affected by inositol levels were down-regulated when inositol was present, including INO1 (16Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. Mol.

INO1 showed the greatest difference in expression, consistent with previous reports that this gene is the most highly regulated of the UASINO-containing genes (2Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). A large number of genes involved in protein folding and secretion, including genes not previously shown to be regulated by inositol, were also down-regulated when inositol was present.

A class of proteins termed SNAREs (including SNAP-23, syntaxins, and VAMPs) are known regulators of secretory granule/plasma membrane fusion events. We have investigated the molecular mechanisms of regulated exocytosis in mast cells and find that SNAP-23 is phosphorylated when rat basophilic leukemia mast cells are triggered to degranulate. The kinetics of SNAP-23 phosphorylation mirror the kinetics of exocytosis. We have identified amino acid residues Ser95 and Ser120 as the major phosphorylation sites in SNAP-23 in rodent mast cells. Quantitative analysis revealed that ∼10% of SNAP-23 was phosphorylated when mast cell degranulation was induced. These same residues were phosphorylated when mouse platelet degranulation was induced with thrombin, demonstrating that phosphorylation of SNAP-23 Ser95 and Ser120 is not restricted to mast cells. Although triggering exocytosis did not alter the absolute amount of SNAP-23 bound to SNAREs, after stimulation essentially all of the SNAP-23 bound to the plasma membrane SNARE syntaxin 4 and the vesicle SNARE VAMP-2 was phosphorylated. Regulated exocytosis studies revealed that overexpression of SNAP-23 phosphorylation mutants inhibited exocytosis from rat basophilic leukemia mast cells, demonstrating that phosphorylation of SNAP-23 on Ser120 and Ser95 modulates regulated exocytosis by mast cells.

Regulated exocytosis is the process by which stimulation of plasma membrane receptors on secretory cells results in the release of proteins and/or peptides from intracellular stores into the extracellular space (1Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 581-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). One common characteristic of regulated exocytosis, whether it be from neurons, cytotoxic lymphocytes, adipocytes, or mast cells, is that the cells response to this stimulus results in pre-formed intracellular granules moving toward and fusing with the plasma membrane. Secretory granule/plasma membrane fusion is the essence of regulated exocytosis, and there is an intense effort underway to identify the molecular mechanisms regulating this process in the hopes of identifying ways to modulate exocytosis.

Isersky C. Petrino M.G. Siraganian R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the high affinity IgE receptor, FcϵRI, on these cells by cross-linking initiates a signal transduction cascade that culminates in secretory granule fusion with the plasma membrane, thereby liberating a variety of inflammatory mediators (3Metcalfe D.D. Baram D. Mekori Y.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1033-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar, 4Kinet J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 931-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Numerous proteins necessary for the tethering, docking, and fusion steps between various membrane compartments in eukaryotic cells have been described. Among those, SNAREs (soluble NSF-attachment protein receptors) are a large family of membrane-associated proteins essential for membrane-membrane fusion (5Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 6Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 19-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). These proteins include members of the vesicle-associated synaptobrevin/VAMP family as well as members of the syntaxin and SNAP-23 families of “target” membrane SNAREs. The current model proposes that while vesicles are docked on the target membrane, SNAREs from the donor or vesicle membrane (v-SNAREs) form trans-SNARE complexes with their cognate SNARE partners on the opposing target membrane. Structurally, the exocytic SNARE complex is a trimolecular protein complex containing one member of the VAMP, syntaxin, and SNAP-23 family, each contributing to the formation of a four-helix coiled-coil bundle (7Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar, 8Poirier M.A. Xiao W. Macosko J.C. Chan C. Shin Y.K. Bennett M.K. Nat. Struct.

Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). Given that SNAREs play a central role in the membrane fusion process, it is likely that their function is modulated in vivo. In particular, protein kinases, which have been extensively associated with the regulation of exocytosis (10Rivera J. Beaven M.A. Parker P.J. Protein Kinase C. R. G. Landes Publishing Co., Austin, TX1997: 133-166Google Scholar), could participate in SNARE function by phosphorylating residues essential in SNARE complex assembly or the binding of SNARE regulatory proteins (6Lin R.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25286-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) found that thrombin stimulation resulted in phosphorylation of this same SNARE protein. In neither of these studies were the syntaxin 4 phosphorylation sites identified or the physiological importance of syntaxin 4 phosphorylation in regulated exocytosis directly examined. In addition to identifying syntaxin 4 as a substrate for protein kinases, it has recently been reported that the plasma membrane SNARE SNAP-23 is phosphorylated during human platelet activation (17Polgar J.

Using mass spectroscopy these authors identified Ser23/Thr24 and Ser161 as targets of SNAP-23 phosphorylation but were unable to ascribe a functional consequence to this. In the current study we have investigated in detail the extent and kinetics of SNARE phosphorylation in mast cells. We find that SNAP-23 undergoes rapid, stimulus-induced phosphorylation and the kinetics of phosphorylation mirror that of degranulation. In contrast to the results of Polgar et al. (17Polgar J. Lane W.S. Chung S.H. Houng A.K. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44369-44376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that the induced phosphorylation sites in rodent SNAP-23 are Ser95 and Ser120. By using phosphopeptide mapping studies, site-directed mutagenesis, and phosphorylation site-specific antibodies we show that these sites are phosphorylated in vivo in RBL mast cells, bone marrow-derived mast cells, and activated mouse platelets. Overexpression of SNAP-23 phosphorylation mutants inhibits the extent of regulated exocytosis from RBL mast cells. We also find that phosphorylated SNAP-23 preferentially associated with syntaxin 4 and VAMP-2 after exocytosis was triggered. These data suggest that SNAP-23 phosphorylation is an important post-translational modification of a critical SNARE that regulates mast cell exocytosis. Antibodies and Cell Culture—Rabbit antisera recognizing the SNAP-23 carboxyl terminus have been described (25Low S.H. Roche P.A. Anderson H.A. van Ijzendoorn S.C.D. Zhang M. Mostov K.E. Weimbs T. J.

Locco L. Hubbard A.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) was the generous gift of Dr. Ann Hubbard (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). A polyclonal rabbit antisera recognizing rat syntaxin 4 was generated by immunizing rabbits with a GST fusion protein of rat syntaxin 4 (amino acids 1–274). This antiserum showed no detectable cross-reactivity with rat syntaxin 2 or rat syntaxin 3 and was used in all immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting studies. Antisera recognizing phospho-SNAP-23-Ser120 was generated by immunizing rabbits with the synthetic peptide Val-Ser-Lys-Gln-Pro-phospho-Ser-Arg-Ile-Thr-Ans-Gly-Gln (corresponding to amino acids 115–126 of rat SNAP-23). Antisera recognizing phospho-SNAP-23-Ser95 was generated by immunizing rabbits with the synthetic peptide Thr-Lys-Asn-Phe-Glu-phospho-Ser-Gly-Lys-Asn-Tyr-Lys-Ala-Thr (corresponding to amino acids 90–102 of rat SNAP-23). The VAMP-2 monoclonal antibody cl 69.1 was obtained from Synaptic Systems (Goettingen, Germany). Unless indicated, anti-DNP-IgE (clone SPE-7) was from Sigma. For the experiments shown in Figs. 8, 9, 10, anti-DNP-IgE (clone TIB-142) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Biotinylated anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M5 was from Sigma and anti-GFP monoclonal antibody clone A.v. was from Clontech.Fig. 9Overexpression of SNAP-23 phosphorylation mutants inhibits exocytosis from RBL mast cells.A, RBL cells expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type SNAP-23, SNAP-23 S95A/S120A, or SNAP-23 S95D/S120D were co-transfected with a trace amount of human growth hormone secretion reporter plasmid as described in the text. The cells were sensitized with DNP-specific IgE and mock-stimulated or stimulated with DNP-BSA. Cell supernatants were harvested after 15 min and the extent of degranulation was determined by measuring the amount of human growth hormone released from the cells. The amount of secretion from cells in each experimental condition was expressed as a percentage of the total amount of human growth hormone present in the cells before stimulation. Data are from three independent experiments, and asterisks indicate statistically significant differences in the percentage of human growth hormone released from each mutant as compared to FLAG-tagged wild-type SNAP-23 (*, p < 0.05 and **, p < 0.0005).

The cells were lysed in Triton X-100 and equal portions of each lysate were analyzed by immunoprecipitation using a control (preimmune) antiserum, an antiserum that recognizes total SNAP-23, or an antiserum that recognizes phospho-SNAP-23-Ser120. Aliquots of each immunoprecipitate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies that recognize rat syntaxin 4 (upper panels) or VAMP-2 (lower panels). B, the percent of all SNAP-23·syntaxin 4 complexes containing phospho-SNAP-23-Ser120 was calculated by expressing the amount of syntaxin 4 in a phospho-SNAP-23-Ser120 immunoprecipitate relative to the total amount of syntaxin 4 bound to all SNAP-23 in the sample. Each data point represents a mean ± S.D. of four independent experiments. The percent of all SNAP-23·VAMP-2 complexes containing phospho-SNAP-23-Ser120 was calculated by expressing the amount of VAMP-2 in a phospho-SNAP-23-Ser120 immunoprecipitate relative to the total amount of VAMP-2 bound to all SNAP-23 in the sample. Each data point represents a mean ± S.D. of two independent experiments. Analysis of the supernatant after each immunoprecipitation confirmed that the SNAP-23 antibody and phospho-SNAP-23-Ser120 antibody removed essentially all SNAP-23 and phospho-SNAP-23-Ser120 from the sample, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RBL-2H3 mast cells were obtained from Dr. Juan Rivera (National Institutes of Health) and were grown in equal parts minimal essential medium and Iscove's medium containing 20% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories), 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Cells were maintained as subconfluent monolayers at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and passaged with trypsin. Cells were sensitized with 1 μg/ml anti-DNP-IgE for 24 h prior to stimulation with 100 ng/ml DNP-BSA in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium. Sensitized cells were mock-stimulated using 100 ng/ml BSA in the same medium. HeLa cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 20 mm Hepes, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. The cells were maintained as subconfluent monolayers at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and passaged with trypsin. In some experiments transfected HeLa cells were stimulated using 10 nm phorbol myristate acetate and 1 μm ionomycin. Plasmids and Recombinant Proteins—Rat SNAP-23 was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using EcoRI and XhoI sites introduced by PCR using a previously described full-length rat SNAP-23 cDNA (27St-Denis J.F. Cabaniols J.P. Cushman S.W. Roche P.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). GST-rat SNAP-23 was generated by subcloning rat SNAP-23 from pcDNA3 into pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences). Ala mutants of all Ser and Thr residues present in rat SNAP-23 were generated with the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pGEX-4T1-rat SNAP-23 as the template according to the manufacturer's instructions. The double mutant of S95A/S120A was generated using rat SNAP-23 S120A DNA as a template. The double mutant replacing both Ser95 and Ser120 with Asp residues (S95D/S120D) was generated using the QuikChange Multi-Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as directed by the manufacturer. The inserts of wild-type SNAP-23 and the mutants of interest were subcloned into the pCMV-Tag 2B vector (Stratagene) to generate amino-terminal FLAG-tagged proteins. The integrity of all PCR-amplified products and all mutants were confirmed by automated sequence analysis using an ABI sequencer. Transfections—Exponentially growing RBL cells were re-suspended in serum-free and antibiotic-free DMEM and 10 × 106 cells were transfected by electroporation (310 mV, 960 microfarads, Bio-Rad GenePulser) using 10–20 μg of empty vector, FLAG-tagged wild-type SNAP-23, or FLAG-tagged mutant rat-SNAP-23 as described previously (20Vaidyanathan V.V. Puri N. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25101-25106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were immediately diluted in antibiotic-free medium and allowed to adhere to plastic culture dishes for 5–6 h before adding anti-DNP IgE to the medium overnight. The next day, cells were triggered for exocytosis as described above. HeLa cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Metabolic Labeling of Cells—RBL cells were plated at 1.5 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish. IgE-sensitized cells were starved the next day for 15 min in phosphate-free DMEM containing 3% dialyzed calf serum (Hy-Clone Laboratories), 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), and gentamicin. Cells were labeled with 0.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 5 h in 1 ml of phosphate-free DMEM. Cells were then stimulated for secretion with DNP-BSA as described above. Cells were washed with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution and tissue culture plate-bound cells were frozen until further use. In Vitro Phosphorylation Reactions—GST and GST-SNAP-23 proteins were purified from isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced BL21 Escherichia coli using standard protocols. Briefly, GST and GST-SNAP-23 were isolated from 200-μl bacteria lysates with 10 μl (1:1) of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). GST proteins were eluted with 30 μl of 10 mm reduced glutathione and phosphorylated for 30 min at 30 °C with 25 ng of purified PKC (Promega) in a reaction buffer of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1.67 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP, and 2 μCi of [32P]ATP. After 30 min the entire reaction mixture was boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation and Electrophoresis—Immunoprecipitation of proteins from cell lysates was carried out as described previously (28Anderson H.A. Roche P.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4850-4858PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed for 1 h in ice-cold lysis buffer, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl containing 1% Triton X-100 as well as protease inhibitors (5 mm iodoacetamide, 50 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mmNα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone) and phosphatase inhibitors (5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, and 1 mm Na3VO4). Specific immunoprecipitations were performed for 2 h at 4 °C by incubating pre-cleared lysates with specific antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Proteins from the immunoprecipitates were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels. Radiolabeled molecules were visualized by autoradiography and/or PhosphorImager analysis. The extent of phosphorylation was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. For phosphopeptide mapping studies, proteins were transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and the location of phosphoproteins on the membrane was determined after autoradiography. For immunoblot analysis proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) and proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using Western Lightning (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Band intensity was determined by automatic integrating densitometry using a Amersham Biosciences densitometer. For quantitative experiments, statistical analyses were carried out by using a Student's t test. Results were considered significant when a p value of less then 0.05 was obtained. Tryptic Phosphopeptide Mapping—Nitrocellulose membranes containing excised SNAP-23 were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 (Sigma), washed twice with 0.4% NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0), and incubated overnight with 0.5 mg/ml trypsin at 37 °C in the same buffer. The released peptides were dried in a Speed-vac, washed with H2O several times, and resuspended in 5 μl of H2O. Peptides were spotted at the bottom of a 20 × 20-cm thin layer chromatography plate (#5577, E. M. Science), dried, and subjected to electrophoresis for 75 min at 1000 V in a buffer of 2.5% formic acid, 7.5% acetic acid. After electrophoresis, the plates were dried for at least 1 h and subjected to analysis in a second dimension of thin layer chromatography using a solvent containing 62.5% isobutyric acid, 4.8% pyridine, 1.9% butanol-1, 2.9% acetic acid until the solvent front migrated to within 1 cm of the top of the TLC plate (generally overnight). The plates were dried and analyzed with a PhosphorImager. Subcellular Fractionation—RBL cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were re-suspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) and were disrupted by repeated passage of cells through a 25-gauge syringe. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g and the post-nuclear supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C to isolate membranes (pellet) and cytosol (supernatant). In some experiments RBL cells were transfected with pEGFP (Clontech) to allow expression of the cytosolic marker protein GFP. The membrane pellet and cytosolic supernatant were brought to the same volume in hypotonic buffer and each was adjusted to a final concentration of 1% Triton X-100. Equal portions of each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Mast Cell Exocytosis Assay—The degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells was monitored by measuring the β-hexosaminidase activity released from cells grown in 6- or 12-well plates. IgE-sensitized cells were washed twice with RPMI and mock-stimulated or stimulated by the addition of DNP-BSA. The cell supernatant was collected and the cells were lysed in phenol red-free RPMI containing 0.2% Triton X-100 to determine the total enzyme content. A colorimetric assay with p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide (Sigma) as the substrate was used to measure the amount of β-hexosaminidase released into the medium and remaining in the cells as described previously (20Vaidyanathan V.V. Puri N. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25101-25106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The β-hexosaminidase activity released was expressed as a percentage of the activity released into the medium relative to the total activity (released plus cell-associated). In some experiments, RBL cells were transfected by electroporation with an expression vector of human growth hormone (2 μg) together with empty pCMV vector or pCMV-FLAG-SNAP-23 (20 μg). After overnight culture, the cells were sensitized with IgE and mock-stimulated or stimulated with DNP-BSA as described above. The amount of human growth hormone released into the medium or remaining cell associated was determined using a human growth hormone enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) as described previously (29Puri N. Kruhlak M.J. Whiteheart S.W. Roche P.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 5345-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For quantitative experiments, statistical analyses were carried out by using a Student's t test. Results were considered significant when a p value of less than 0.05 was obtained. Platelet Preparation and Measurement of Thrombin-induced Secretion—Mouse platelets were isolated as described previously (30Schraw T.D. Rutledge T.W. Crawford G.L. Bernstein A.M. Kalen A.L. Pessin J.E. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 2003; 102: 1716-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, blood was obtained from the right ventricle of the heart of sacrificed C57BL/6 mice. The blood was mixed with 1.8% sodium citrate (pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 0.18%. Platelet-rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 100 × g for 10 min. Care was taken to harvest only the platelet-containing upper layer to avoid the buffy coat layer of nucleated cells above the red blood cells. Platelets were assayed for dense core release of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine, lysosomal release of β-hexosaminidase, and α-granule release of platelet factor IV, as described previously (31Rutledge T.W. Whiteheart S.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 272: 109-120PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets were activated by the addition of thrombin (0.5 units/ml; Chronolog) in a Hepes/Tyrode's release buffer containing 0.7 mm CaCl2 at 25 °C for the indicated times. The data were tabulated as the percent release compared with the total present in each reaction. The background release of each marker in unstimulated platelets was subtracted from that obtained after thrombin stimulation to yield net granule marker release. A parallel set of reactions was solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for analysis by immunoblotting. SNAP-23 Is Phosphorylated in Stimulated RBL Cells—RBL cell exocytosis can be triggered by cross-linking of surface FcϵRI receptors for IgE by the appropriate antigen (3Metcalfe D.D. Baram D. Mekori Y.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1033-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar, 4Kinet J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 931-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). To determine whether SNAREs were phosphorylated during physiological stimulation in mast cells, RBL-2H3 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate prior to cross-linking surface Fc receptors for DNP-specific IgE using DNP-BSA. The cells were then mock-stimulated (using unconjugated BSA) or stimulated for 20 min with DNP-BSA and the phosphorylation status of the SNARE proteins was analyzed by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and PhosphorImager analysis (Fig. 1A). In agreement with published results (15Pombo I. Martin-Verdeaux S. Iannascoli B. Le Mao J. Deriano L. Rivera J. Blank U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42893-42900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), syntaxin 4 was phosphorylated in mock-treate"

Here, we report biochemical studies addressing proteolytic processing of γ-protocadherins. These type-I transmembrane proteins are cleaved by a metalloproteinase in vivo, generating a soluble extracellular fragment and a carboxyl-terminal fragment associated with the cellular membrane. In addition, we show that the carboxyl-terminal fragment is a substrate for further cleavage mediated by presenilin. Consequently, accumulation of the fragment is found when γ-secretase is inactivated either by the specific presenilin-inhibitor L685,458 or in double mutant murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking both presenilin genes. The γ-secretase-generated carboxyl-terminal fragment is largely unstable but accumulates when proteasomal degradation is inhibited. Interestingly, the proteolytic fragment generated by γ-secretase can localize to the nucleus. This is the first report providing experimental evidence for a cell surface receptor signaling function of protocadherins regulated by proteolytic events.

Interestingly, the proteolytic fragment generated by γ-secretase can localize to the nucleus. This is the first report providing experimental evidence for a cell surface receptor signaling function of protocadherins regulated by proteolytic events. The cadherin superfamily comprises a large number of cell adhesion molecules with ectodomains composed of multiple Ca2+-binding cadherin domains (1Angst B.D. Marcozzi C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 625-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Classical cadherins like E- or N-cadherin possess five such domains, which typically engage in homophilic binding. The highly conserved cytoplasmic domain binds to catenins, which establish a link to the actin cytoskeleton and thus promote cadherin-mediated cell adhesion (2Aberle H. Schwartz H. Kemler R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The juxtamembrane region of classical cadherins interacts with another cytoplasmic Armadillo repeat protein, p120, which is involved in the control of cadherin levels at the cell surface (3Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 4Peifer M. Yap A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 437-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the same domain can bind to presenilin, the catalytically active component of the γ-secretase complex (5Baki L. Marambaud P. Efthimiopoulos S. Georgakopoulos A. Wen P. Cui W. Shioi J. Koo E. Ozawa M. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Robakis N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2381-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 6Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Recent reports further showed that indeed both E-cadherin (7Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K.

Cell. 2003; 114: 635-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) undergo proteolytic processing events involving γ-secretase activity. For both proteins, a first cleavage is executed by a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CTF, carboxyl-terminal fragment; NTF, amino-terminal fragment; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast(s); WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CTF, carboxyl-terminal fragment; NTF, amino-terminal fragment; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast(s); WT, wild type. activity, shedding a soluble cadherin amino-terminal fragment off the membrane. The remaining, membrane-associated, carboxyl-terminal part undergoes a presenilin-dependent intramembrane cleavage, which releases the cytoplasmic portion into the cytosol. The processing of E-cadherin is proposed to modulate its adhesive properties (5Baki L. Marambaud P. Efthimiopoulos S. Georgakopoulos A. Wen P. Cui W. Shioi J. Koo E. Ozawa M. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Robakis N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2381-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 7Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1948-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The N-cadherin carboxyl-terminal fragment seems to affect gene expression via binding to and inducing the degradation of CREB-binding protein, an essential co-factor for CREB-mediated transcription (8Marambaud P. Wen P.H. Dutt A. Shioi J. Takashima A. Siman R. Robakis N.K. Cell. 2003; 114: 635-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar).Protocadherins are cadherin-related adhesion molecules with six or seven extracellular cadherin motifs. Their cytoplasmic domains diverge from each other and from those of the classical cadherins, indicating different binding properties and intracellular functions (9Frank M. Kemler R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The recently described protocadherin α, β, and γ (Pcdhα, -β, and -γ) gene clusters together encode more than 50 protocadherin proteins. These clusters have attracted attention because of the unusual organization of arrayed genes, reminiscent of that of the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor loci (10Wu Q. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3124-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11Wu Q. Zhang T. Cheng J.F. Kim Y. Grimwood J. Schmutz J. Dickson M. Noonan J.P. Zhang M.Q. Myers R.M. Maniatis T. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 389-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Large “variable” exons each comprise the coding information for a complete transmembrane protein, including ectodomain, transmembrane segment, and a short cytoplasmic tail. In the mouse, each of the 14 possible Pcdhα and 22 possible Pcdhγ transcripts is generated by alternative splicing of one of the variable exons to the three small exons, which together encode the constant portion, at the 3′- end of each of the clusters (12Tasic B. Nabholz C.E. Baldwin K.K. Kim Y. Rueckert E.H. Ribich S.A. Cramer P. Wu Q. Axel R. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 13Wang X. Weiner J.A. Levi S. Craig A.M. Bradley A. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 2002; 36: 843-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Thus, all Pcdhs α and Pcdhs γ share a family-specific constant domain that could transduce different extracellular information into a common intracellular signaling pathway or other executive functions. In contrast, Pcdhs of the β cluster lack a constant domain and thus represent single-exon genes (14Vanhalst K. Kools P. Vanden Eynde E. van Roy F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The protocadherins derived from these gene clusters are predominantly expressed in the nervous system and have been found localized to synaptic junctions (15Kohmura N. Senzaki K. Hamada S. Kai N. Yasuda R. Watanabe M. Ishii H. Yasuda M. Mishina M. Yagi T. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1137-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Functionally connected neurons are often characterized by the expression of a distinct set of cadherins, which may thus provide an adhesive code regulating neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis (for reviews, see Refs. 16Shapiro L. Colman D.R. Neuron. 1999; 23: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 17Redies C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 611-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 18Heyers D. Kovjanic D. Redies C. J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 460: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The large number of distinct protocadherins could contribute to the complexity of neuronal connections by significantly increasing the number of adhesive combinations (16Shapiro L. Colman D.R. Neuron. 1999; 23: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 19Serafini T. Cell. 1999; 98: 133-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the genetic loss of the entire Pcdh γ cluster has no obvious effect on synapse formation but is associated with severe neurological defects, including neuronal degeneration (13Wang X. Weiner J.A. Levi S. Craig A.M. Bradley A. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 2002; 36: 843-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This indicates that Pcdh γ function also involves unknown signaling processes.Here we show that Pcdhs γ undergo endoproteolytic processing including metalloproteinase- and presenilin-dependent cleavages. In a final step, a short lived carboxyl-terminal fragment is generated by γ-secretase that can translocate to the nucleus, suggesting that Pcdhγ functions in the regulation of gene transcription.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Drug Treatments, and Transfections—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts, human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and COS-7 monkey fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (Calbiochem) was used at 5 μm final concentration from a 5 mm stock solution prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The presenilin inhibitor L685,458 (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO (at 2 mm) and used at a final concentration of 2–10 μm. The metalloprotease inhibitor GM6001 (Biomol) was used at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml from a 1 mg/ml stock in Me2SO. Inhibitor treatments were performed for 12–16 h if not indicated otherwise.For transient transfections, cells were plated on 6-well plates (Costar) or on 35-mm cell culture dishes with a glass coverslip attached at the bottom and transfected with DNA (5 μg/well) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method for 293 cells or Polyfect reagent for COS-7 cells, according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Qiagen, Germany). After 48–72 h, expression was analyzed by Western blotting or fluorescence microscopy. Stable transfectants were obtained by culturing transfected cells in the presence of G418 (700 μg/ml; Invitrogen) or zeocyin (500 μg/ml; Invitrogen). Clonal cell lines were established using fluorescence-activated cell sorting technology and selection on 96-well plates (Greiner).cDNA Constructs and Antibodies—cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription (Superscript II; Invitrogen) using oligo(dT) or Pcdhγ constant region-specific priming of mouse brain total RNA. Full-length PcdhγA3 and PcdhγC3 constructs were generated from PCR amplifications with Pcdh-specific primers on cDNA (constant region) and on BAC-DNA spanning the Pcdhγ cluster (11Wu Q. Zhang T. Cheng J.F. Kim Y. Grimwood J. Schmutz J. Dickson M. Noonan J.P. Zhang M.Q. Myers R.M. Maniatis T. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 389-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These PCR products were cloned into the reading frame of the pEGFPN1 expression vector (Clontech) to give COOH-terminal fusions of the Pcdhs with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). For expression of untagged Pcdhs γ, constructs were cloned into the pcDNA3.1.zeo expression vector (Invitrogen, Germany). For the NH2-terminal fusion with GFP, the signal sequence of PcdhγC3 in pcDNA3.1.zeo was replaced in frame by the signal sequence of Igα followed by a FLAG tag and eGFP taken from a construct kindly provided by Dr. Stefan Kuppig (Max-Planck Institute of Immunobiology, Freiburg, Germany). This same sequence (without GFP) was used for cloning of the extracellularly truncated version of Pcdhs to produce FLAG-γA3 and FLAG-γC3 COOH-terminal GFP fusions. Table I lists all of the proteins analyzed in this study.Table IProtocadherin γ-molecules analyzed in this study Open table in a new tab Anti-PcdhγC3 antibodies were raised against an extracellular epitope (γC3a, amino acids 71–86) and an intracellular epitope (γC3b, amino acids 792–809) of PcdhγC3 by boosting rabbits with these peptides coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin at 30-day intervals (Pineda Antibody Service, Berlin, Germany). The antisera were tested on 293 cells transiently transfected with PcdhγC3-eGFP. The rabbit antibodies to the Pcdhγ constant domain have been described previously (20Phillips G.R. Tanaka H. Frank M. Elste A. Fidler L. Benson D.L. Colman D.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5096-5104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitations—Cells were cultured in 6-well plates and starved for 1–2 h at 37 °C in 1 ml/well of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine and cysteine, supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, prior to biosynthetic labeling with 80 μCi of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Promix™; Amersham Biosciences). Cell culture supernatants and washed cells were collected after overnight incubation. For pulse-chase experiments, cells were labeled for 30 min or 1 h, and the chase was initiated by washing the cells and replacing the labeling medium with complete medium. After the times indicated, washed cells were scraped from the plates and solubilized in 300 μl of NET buffer (21Kessler S.W. J. Immunol. 1975; 115: 1617-1624PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed using 1–2 μg of antibody and 25 μl of postnuclear supernatant/sample, essentially as described (22Kaloff C.R. Haas I.G.

Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and incubated in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) before fluorography (Eastman Kodak Co.) or used for protein transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Reactive bands were detected using the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-GFP (1:500; Clontech), rabbit anti-FLAG (1:400; Sigma), rabbit anti-C3a (1:2,000), rabbit anti-C3b (1: 20,000), and rabbit antibodies to the Pcdhγ constant domain (1:2,000). After incubation with peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson/Dianova, Heidelberg, Germany), the blots were developed with chemiluminiscent reagents (Pierce).Fluorescence Microscopy and Imaging—Analysis of eGFP fluorescence in living cells grown on glass bottom dishes was done by confocal laser scanning microscopy on a Leica DMIre2 inverted microscope setup using appropriate filter settings for eGFP detection. In addition, eGFP fluorescence was analyzed in cells grown on coverslips in 6-well plates. After fixation with paraformaldehyde, the coverslips were mounted on slides with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL). Films of fluorographs, gels, and Western blots were scanned with a flatbed scanner, and digital images were imported and processed in Photoshop software (Adobe).RESULTSMatrix Metalloproteinase-mediated Cleavage of Pcdhγ into an Amino-terminal Fragment Shed from the Membrane and a Membrane-bound Carboxyl-terminal Fragment—According to sequence homologies, γ-protocadherins fall into three subclasses, Pcdhγ A, B, and C. We used 293 cells expressing two different Pcdhγ proteins fused carboxyl-terminal to GFP (i.e. PcdhγC3-GFP and PcdhγA3-GFP). Cellular extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using an antiserum directed against the constant domain of Pcdhγ proteins (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–3) as well as anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 1A, lanes 4–6). Both antibodies detected bands corresponding to the full-length Pcdhγ-GFP fusion proteins, which migrated at the expected position of ∼150 kDa. In addition, smaller proteins were detected, with apparent molecular masses of ∼50 kDa in the case of PcdhγC3-GFP and ∼65 kDa in the case of PcdhγA3-GFP (Fig. 1A). Analysis of a second member of the PcdhγA subclass, PcdhγA1-GFP, also showed a fragment of 65 kDa (data not shown).Fig. 1γ-Protocadherins are cleaved by MMP into a COOH-terminal fragment associated with the cell membrane and an NH2-terminal fragment shed from the cell surface.A, lysates of transfected 293 cells stably expressing PcdhγC3-GFP (lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10) or PcdhγA3-GFP (lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11) or of untransfected 293 cells (lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12) were probed with antibodies to the Pcdhγ constant domain (anti-γconst., lanes 1–3), GFP (lanes 4–6), PcdhγC3a (lanes 7–9), or PcdhγC3b (lanes 10–12). Anti-C3a and -C3b recognize epitopes situated at the NH2 and COOH terminus of the PcdhγC3 variable domain, respectively. Note that the GFP moiety is at the COOH terminus of the fusion proteins. B, 293 cells stably expressing PcdhγA3- or PcdhγC3-GFP fusion proteins were biosynthetically labeled for 30 min. Postnuclear supernatants were prepared at the chase times indicated and used for immunoprecipitation of GFP fusion proteins. CTF is generated from full-length protein as evidenced by the time-dependent appearance of the labeled fragments (arrowheads). C, 293 cells stably expressing GFP-PcdhγC3 fusion protein or untransfected controls were biosynthetically labeled for 12 h in the absence or presence of GM6001 (4 μg/ml), as indicated. Cell culture supernatants or cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation of GFP-containing proteins. Note that here the GFP moiety is at the NH2 terminus of PcdhγC3. The NH2-terminal fragment (arrowhead) immunoprecipitated from the cell culture supernatant (sup) is smaller than the full-length protein present in the cellular lysate (lys).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further characterize these fragments, antibodies reacting with two different epitopes of PcdhγC3 were used. Anti-C3a antibodies recognize a peptide epitope present in the first extracellular domain and detected full-length PcdhγC3-GFP but not the lower molecular weight fragment (Fig. 1A, lane 7). In contrast, anti-C3b antibodies, raised against a peptide at the very end of the PcdhγC3 variable domain, recognized both the full-length PcdhγC3-GFP protein and the fragment (Fig. 1A, lane 10), whereas no protein from untransfected or PcdhγA3-GFP-expressing cells was labeled. From these results, we conclude that the Pcdhγ fragments are composed of the GFP moiety, the Pcdhγ constant domain, and a carboxyl-terminal portion of the variable domain.To investigate whether this carboxyl-terminal fragment (CTF) is derived from a processing event, we performed pulse-chase experiments with stably transfected 293 cells that express PcdhγA3-GFP or PcdhγC3-GFP and immunoprecipitated the proteins carrying the GFP moiety. Directly after the pulse, only full-length PcdhγA3- or PcdhγC3-GFP fusion proteins were detected (Fig. 1B). Increasing amounts of CTF appeared in a time-dependent fashion in both cell lines, thus demonstrating that the fragments result from endoproteolytic processing of full-length PcdhγA3-GFP and PcdhγC3-GFP, respectively. In all experiments, PcdhγA3 appeared to be more rapidly processed into CTF than PcdhγC3.Carbonate extraction of membrane fractions obtained by differential centrifugation of mechanically broken cells indicated that CTF is an integral membrane protein (data not shown). These findings suggest that the site of endoproteolytic cleavage is located in the Pcdhγ extracellular domain, possibly mediated by an MMP. If so, the generation of CTF should be accompanied by the shedding off of the membrane of a corresponding soluble NH2-terminal fragment (NTF). The release of such a fragment should be inhibited by GM6001, a synthetic broad range metalloproteinase inhibitor (23Galardy R.E. Cassabonne M.E. Giese C. Gilbert J.H. Lapierre F. Lopez H. Schaefer M.E. Stack R. Sullivan M. Summers B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).γ-Protocadherins have an apparent molecular mass of ∼120 kDa (20Phillips G.R. Tanaka H. Frank M. Elste A. Fidler L. Benson D.L. Colman D.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5096-5104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calculating a molecular mass of 20–25 kDa for the CTF of unmodified PcdhγC3 (see Fig. 3B), the NH2-terminal fragment should have a mass of ∼100 kDa. To detect NTF, we analyzed transfected 293 cells producing a PcdhγC3 protein with a GFP tag at the NH2 terminus, as pictured in Table I. Biosynthetic labeling was performed in the absence or presence of GM6001, and cell lysates as well as cell culture supernatants were analyzed for GFP-tagged proteins by immunoprecipitation. In the lysate of transfected cells, only full-length GFP-PcdhγC3 protein with a molecular mass of ∼150 kDa was detected (Fig. 1C). A GFP-containing NTF of the expected size (100 kDa + GFP = 130 kDa) was detected exclusively in the cell culture supernatant of transfected cells (Fig. 1C, arrowhead). When the labeling was performed in the presence of GM6001, only marginal amounts of NTF were detected, supporting our hypothesis that the cleavage is MMP-dependent. Processing of γ-protocadherins seems to be a general phenomenon, also detected with endogenous Pcdhγ protein in several cell lines. For example, we found low steady state levels of PcdhγC3 and CTF in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF; see results below), but not when the MEF were cultured in the presence of GM6001. PcdhγC3-CTF was also detected in P19 embryonic carcinoma cells, which have been widely used as a model for neuronal differentiation (24Finley M.F. Kulkarni N. Huettner J.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1056-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kotani M. Osanai T. Tajima Y. Kato H. Imada M. Kaneda H. Kubo H. Sakuraba H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 67: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the low levels of endogenous PcdhγC3 expressed by P19 cells increased upon differentiation induced by retinoic acid. Accordingly, PcdhγC3-CTF was readily detected, providing suggestive evidence for efficient proteolytic processing in those cells (data not shown).Fig. 3Inhibition of presenilin function leads to accumulation of Pcdhγ-CTF.A, pulse-chase experiment with 293 cells stably expressing PcdhγA3 fusion protein. Cells were biosynthetically labeled for 1 h and chased for 5 h, all in the absence or presence of the specific presenilin inhibitor L685,458. Anti-GFP antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation of PcdhγA3-GFP and CTF. The inhibitor leads to strong accumulation of CTF (arrowhead). B, presenilin-dependent processing of both recombinant untagged and endogenous PcdhγC3. 293-PcdhγC3 cells (left panel) or WT or mutant (PS1–/–, PS2–/–) MEF (right panel) were cultured in the absence or presence of L685,458, as indicated. Western blots were probed with anti-C3b antibodies. Note that CTF produced from both untagged and endogenous PcdhγC3 has an apparent molecular mass of ∼25 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Taken together, our results provide strong evidence for an extracellular cleavage of Pcdhγ mediated by a matrix metalloproteinase to produce soluble Pcdhγ-NTF and membrane-bound Pcdhγ-CTF.MMP Cleavage in Pcdhγ Ectodomains Occurs Close to the Membrane—To narrow down the MMP cleavage sites, we designed truncated PcdhγA3 and PcdhγC3 molecules, lacking almost the complete extracellular domain (see Table I). A signal sequence followed by a FLAG tag was introduced 18 amino acids NH2-terminal to the respective transmembrane segment of PcdhγA3 and PcdhγC3 (Fig. 2A). 293 cells were transiently transfected with the FLAG-tagged constructs, and Western blots were performed using the anti-FLAG antibodies. Remarkably, the two proteins migrated with a considerably different mobility (Fig. 2B), although they have a similar molecular mass (Fig. 2A). This difference in mobility resembled that of the respective CTFs in Fig. 1A and could be due to the different charge properties of the respective proteins. When anti-GFP antibodies were used, faint bands below the FLAG-tagged proteins became detectable, indicating that both FLAG-γA3-GFP and FLAG-γC3-GFP were still slowly processed into CTF. However, the cleavage efficiency is apparently higher with the nontruncated proteins (compare Figs. 2B and 1A).Fig. 2MMP cleavage in both PcdhγA3 and -C3 proteins occurs in close vicinity to the membrane.A, schematic representation of the FLAG-tagged PcdhγA3-GFP (FLAG-γA3-GFP) and the FLAG-tagged PcdhγC3-GFP (FLAG-γC3-GFP). The signal sequence preceding the FLAG tag is not indicated. The various domains of the proteins are indicated by boxes: FLAG tag (striped); transmembrane (TM) segment (black); carboxyl-terminal end of the variable domain (white); constant domain of Pcdhγ (γ-const., light gray); and GFP moiety (dark gray). The outlined Pcdhγ-specific sequences of 18 amino acids separate the FLAG tag from the respective Pcdhγ-transmembrane segment. B, cell surface expression of FLAG-γ-C3-GFP. 293 cells were stably transfected to express FLAG-γ-C3-GFP, and fixed cells were examined by confocal microscopy. C, 293 cells were transfected to express the proteins shown in A. Lysates were analyzed by Western blotting (WB) using anti-FLAG or anti-GFP antibodies, as indicated. Note that CTF (arrowheads) is detected only by anti-GFP antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)From these results, we conclude that the MMP cleavage in both PcdhγA3 and -C3 proteins occurs in close vicinity to the membrane, giving rise to CTF proteins of similar molecular weight.Inhibition of Presenilin Action Leads to the Accumulation of Pcdhγ-CTF—The MMP-dependent processing of γ-protocadherins into CTF and NTF is reminiscent of the cleavage preceding the presenilin-mediated processing of classical cadherins (7Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K.

Cell. 2003; 114: 635-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). To investigate a possible involvement of presenilin, we cultured PcdhγA3-GFP-expressing 293 cells in the presence of the aspartyl protease transition state mimic L685,458, a highly specific presenilin-1 inhibitor (26Shearman M.S. Beher D. Clarke E.E. Lewis H.D. Harrison T. Hunt P. Nadin A. Smith A.L. Stevenson G. Castro J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8698-8704Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). We found that inhibition of presenilin-1 by L685,458 resulted in a time-dependent accumulation of CTF (data not shown), which would be expected when presenilin-dependent downstream processing of CTF is blocked. Consistent with this scenario, the presence of L685,458 led to the accumulation of PcdhγA3-GFP-CTF in a pulse chase (Fig. 3A). Treatment with the inhibitor also led to strong enrichment of a protein of the molecular mass expected for unmodified CTF (∼25 kDa) when 293 cells expressed recombinant PcdhγC3 without the GFP tag (Fig. 3B, left panel). In addition, a slightly larger band of unknown origin was detected, possibly reflecting a second MMP cleavage site in PcdhγC3. If presenilins are indeed involved in the downstream processing of Pcdhγ-CTF, one would expect an accumulation of Pcdhγ-CTF in cells lacking γ-secretase activity. To address this possibility, we used MEF established from wild type (WT) or double mutant embryos (PS1–/–; PS2–/–) lacking both presenilin genes (27Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Remarkably, these fibroblasts express PcdhγC3 endogenously, and full-length PcdhγC3 (∼120 kDa) was detected in both wild type and mutant MEF with anti-C3b antibodies (Fig. 3B, right panel). An additional fragment corresponding to PcdhγC3-CTF was detected in the mutant but not in WT MEF. Importantly, treatment of WT MEF with the presenilin i"

It is essential in many biological processes, and unbalanced collagenolysis is associated with diseases such as arthritis, cancer, atherosclerosis, aneurysm, and fibrosis. These metalloproteinases are secreted from the cell as inactive precursors, procollagenases (proMMPs). To gain insights into the structural basis of their activation mechanisms and collagen binding, we have crystallized recombinant human proMMP-1 and determined its structure to 2.2 Å resolution. The catalytic metalloproteinase domain and the C-terminal hemopexin (Hpx) domain show the classical MMP-fold, but the structure has revealed new features in surface loops and domain interaction. The prodomain is formed by a three-helix bundle and gives insight into the stepwise activation mechanism of proMMP-1. The prodomain interacts with the Hpx domain, which affects the position of the Hpx domain relative to the catalytic domain. This interaction results in a “closed” configuration of proMMP-1 in contrast to the “open” configuration observed previously for the structure of active MMP-1. This is the first evidence of mobility of the Hpx domain in relation to the catalytic domain, providing an important clue toward the understanding of the collagenase-collagen interaction and subsequent collagenolysis.

All collagenolytic MMPs cleave type I–III collagens at specific peptide bonds located ∼3/4 away from the N terminus and generate the characteristic 3/4 and 1/4 fragments, which are then denatured at body temperature and further degraded by gelatinases and other nonspecific proteinases. A typical human collagenase, MMP-1, is synthesized as pre-procollagenase and co-translationally processed to procollagenase, which consists of a propeptide of 80 amino acids, a catalytic domain of 162 amino acids, a 16-residue linker region, and a hemopexin (Hpx) domain of 189 amino acids (9Goldberg G.I.

Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Refinement— proMMP-1 was crystallized using the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique. A 1-μl portion of the protein solution (containing 30 mg/ml proMMP-1 (E200A) in 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2,) was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.5 m Li2SO4) and concentrated against the reservoir at 4 °C. After several months, plate-like crystals (300 × 200 × 50 μm3) formed belonging to the space group I422. With two monomers of 51.8 kDa per asymmetric unit, this corresponds to a solvent content of 64% (v/v) (19Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7911) Google Scholar). After adding 30% glycerol to the mother liquor, crystals were flash frozen in a 100 K nitrogen stream. Multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction data sets to 2.0 Å resolution were collected at beamline BW6 at the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron in Hamburg, Germany, employing a Mar Research charge-coupled device detector at wavelengths λ = 1.2820, 1.2838, and 1.050 Å (Table I).

MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The root mean square deviations of all protein bond lengths and angles from target values are 0.012 Å and 1.5°, respectively.

There are two molecules (A and B) in the asymmetric unit, and slight differences are observed in their structures as discussed later. The structure shows four segments, a prodomain, a catalytic domain, a linker region, and an Hpx domain (Fig. 1, ribbon structure). The ellipsoid-shaped prodomain docks to the active site in the metalloproteinase domain. In addition, it interacts with the Hpx domain, contributing to a compact structural arrangement of proMMP-1. The overall fold of the catalytic and Hpx domain is similar to other MMPs. In the crystal, proMMP-1 was found to be present as a dimer with contacts via the Hpx domains. This site resembles the dimerization site observed for the MMP-9 Hpx domain (26Cha H. Kopetzki E. Huber R. Lanzendorfer M. Brandstetter H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1065-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The contact site might indicate a general tendency of the Hpx domain to interact in this way. However, proMMP-1 behaves like a monomer in solution (data not shown). Thus, the observed dimer might be the result of high enzyme concentrations in the crystallization solution and is not physiologically relevant. The Metalloproteinase Domain—The structure of the metalloproteinase domain of MMP is similar to those of other MMPs in showing an active site cleft notched into the front surface and separating the smaller “lower subdomain” from the larger “upper subdomain.” This cleft extends horizontally across the molecule and would bind a peptide substrate from left to right in the orientation shown in Fig. 1. The upper subdomain encompasses a characteristic five-stranded, highly twisted β-sheet flanked by three surface loops on its convex side and by two long regular α-helices on its concave side. Four of the five β-strands are aligned in a parallel fashion, only the cleft sided “edge strand” sIV runs in the opposite direction. The chain passes β-strand sI, α-helix hA, β-strand sII, sIII, before entering the so-called “S-loop,” which is fixed via the “structural zinc” ion and one of three calcium ions bound to the underlying β-sheet (Fig. 1). The structural zinc ion is liganded in a tetrahedral coordination sphere made up by His149Nδ1, Asp151-Oδ1, His164-Nϵ2, and His177-Nϵ2 (using the proenzyme nomenclature of MMP-1). The S-loop extends into the cleft sided “bulge,” which continues into the antiparallel edge strand sIV, a segment of prime importance for binding of peptidic substrates or inhibitors by forming main chain hydrogen bonds. The sII–sIII loop together with the sIV–sV loop sandwiches another calcium ion. After the sV strand, the chain passes through the large open sV-hB loop, a segment of high variability and a source of substrate specificity within the MMP family (27Maskos K. Bode W. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 25: 241-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is then followed by the long horizontally extending “active site helix” hB. This helix includes the first and the second His of the zinc binding motif His199 and His203, and Glu200, the residue essential for catalysis, which in this proenzyme has been mutated to Ala. The chain then bends down, exhibits the third zinc ligand (His209), followed by the 1.4-tight “Met turn” (28Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Stöcker W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), and then forms the lower primed site surface with the Pro219-Ser220-Tyr221 wall-forming segment of the S1′ specificity pocket. The domain is completed by the following “specificity loop” and the C-terminal helix hC. The Prodomain Structure; Implications for the Activation Mechanism—The primary sequence of the MMP-1 prodomain with cleavage positions of activating proteases and secondary structure elements are shown in Fig. 2A. In the structure described here, the first 12 residues of the prodomain (Phe1-Val12) are not visible in the electron density and are probably flexible. The first residue that is defined in electron density is Asp13. The main body of the prodomain is formed by a three-helix bundle with a left-handed twist and the helices more or less perpendicular to each other stabilized via a hydrophobic core (Fig. 2B). The orientation of Helix 1 (Leu14-Tyr23) is almost parallel with sIV (edge strand) in the proteinase domain forming an angle of about 20 degrees albeit at a distance of the two main chains of about 12 Å (Fig. 2C). It does not interact with residues in the catalytic domain apart from Lys21 coming close to Asn161, and Tyr22, which hydrogen bonds with Asn161 in molecule A. Helix 1 is followed by loop 1 (Leu25-Gly39), which points away from the catalytic domain. Twelve residues (Asn27-Ser38) of loop 1 are not visible in the electron density, suggesting that this region is flexible in solution. The flexible part of loop 1 contains the EKRRN sequence of the “bait” region. This EKRRN peptide would be positioned distal to the catalytic domain and is expected to be fully exposed to the solvent, which would provide maximum accessibility for activating proteases such as plasmin, plasma kallikrein, and trypsin (29Suzuki K. Enghild J.J. Morodomi T. Salvesen G. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10261-10270Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the peptide backbone in this loop is considered to destabilize the prodomain arrangement allowing for further cleavage(s) by several MMPs, which finally leads to fully activated enzyme (30Nagase H. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 151-160PubMed Google Scholar). Helix 2 (Pro40-Phe52) is directed toward the catalytic domain in an almost perpendicular orientation to the active site helix and sIV (Fig. 2C). Helix 2 interacts mainly with other residues in the prodomain provided by helices 1 and 3 and loop2. At the end of helix 2, residues Phe51 and Phe52 interact with residues His209-Ser210-Thr211 and Tyr218-Pro219 of the proteinase domain (data not shown). Loop 2 (Gly53-Asp61) turns up along helix 2 and then kinks at Gly58 toward helix 3. Within the prodomain loop 2 mainly interacts with helices 2 and 3. It is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding; the side chain interaction of residue Asp61 with Gln49 from helix 2 especially contributes to this stabilization. Residues in this loop, in addition, interact with the Hpx domain as discussed below. Helix 3 (Ala62-Met68) points toward the active site cleft of the catalytic domain at an angle of about 45°. It mainly interacts with the other helices in the prodomain and loop 2. Glu63 and Lys66 of helix 3 form a salt bridge in molecule A. Molecule B shows unclear density for the side chains at the end of helix 3 and the following residues. In molecule A, Gln70 hydrogen bonds with Ser220 of the catalytic domain. The cysteine switch sequence PRCGVPD enters the active site cleft on the right-hand side in the standard orientation; in Fig. 2C it enters on the bottom left side. It is positioned in the opposite orientation to that of a productively bound peptide substrate (31Grams F. Reinemer P. Powers J.C. Kleine T. Pieper M. Tschesche H. Huber R. Bode W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 830-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The cysteine switch region makes β-sheet backbone contacts with sIV of the catalytic domain in a parallel orientation (residues Gly160 CO, Leu162, and Ala163 CO) and with residues Pro219 CO and Tyr221 N in an antiparallel orientation. Pro71 is positioned in a hydrophobic pocket formed by catalytic domain residues Leu162, Tyr191, and Tyr221. Arg72, which is strictly conserved in MMPs, is oriented toward the interior of the prodomain and plays a role in stabilizing the cysteine switch loop region against the bulk of the prodomain with the help of Asp77, with which it forms a salt bridge (Fig. 2C). In addition, Tyr18 and Tyr23 of helix 1 contribute by hydrogen bonding to Arg72 and Asp77, respectively, with Tyr22 of helix 1 forming a “lid” on top of Arg72 (Fig. 2C). Asp77 also interacts with His209, which is positioned closer to the catalytic zinc in the proMMP-1 than in the active enzyme. Because of the orientation of Cys73, which coordinates with its Sγ to the active site Zn2+, toward the catalytic zinc and Arg72 toward the prodomain, the S1′ and S2′ substrate specificity pockets are empty in contrast to when the proteinase domain interacts with a substrate. It is this interaction between Cys73 and the active site zinc that keeps the enzyme in its zymogen state. Apart from the S1′ pocket, water molecules are excluded from the catalytic site cleft by the cysteine switch region. The region beyond the cysteine switch, residues Gln80 to Asn87, is not present in the electron density, suggesting that this region may have some degree of flexibility in proMMP-1. This segment contains Phe81, which becomes the N-terminal residue of fully activated MMP-1. Even though there are differences in this loop among the proMMPs that have been solved, the protein backbone in all of them follow a similar overall arrangement within 3.4–3.8 Å r.m.s.d. for proMMPs 2, 3, and 9 (Fig. 3). It can be expected that this will also be the case for proMMP-1. In the structure of the active form of pig MMP-1 the N-terminal phenylalanine (Phe81) makes a salt bridge with Asp232 of hC of the catalytic domain in a similar manner as MMP-8 (32Reinemer P. Grams F. Huber R. Kleine T. Schnierer S. Piper M. Tschesche H. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For this to occur, a considerable change in conformation is needed for residues Phe81-Pro88. This has also been observed for the proMMP-3Δhemopexin (devoid of the Hpx domain) versus the catalytic domain of MMP-3 where the N-terminal phenylalanine has to move about 17 Å (11Becker J.W. Marcy A.I. Rokosz L.L. Axel M.G. Burbaum J.J. Fitzgerald P.M. Cameron P.M. Esser C.K. Hagmann W.K. Hermes J.D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The Hpx-like Domain—The C-terminal Hpx domain is connected to the catalytic metalloproteinase domain through a 16-residue linker. The Hpx shows ∼4-fold symmetry with a structure like a four-bladed propeller (18Li J. Brick P. O'Hare M.C. Skarzynski T. Lloyd L.F. Curry V.A. Clark I.M. Bigg H.F. Hazleman B.L. Cawston T.E.

Biol. 1996; 264: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Each blade is formed by four antiparallel β-strands and short peptide loops with short helices connecting these blades. The first strands of each β-sheet contribute to the formation of a central solvent accessible channel. This arrangement is stabilized by a disulfide bridge formed between Cys259 in the beginning of blade I and Cys447 at the end of blade IV. Additional density within the central channel was interpreted as one calcium ion at its entrance and one chloride ion and one sodium ion within the channel. At the entrance of the central channel (defined by the direction of the β-strands) three aspartates and one glutamate form an acidic patch similar to Hpx of MMP-2 (33Gohlke U. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Crabbe T. Murphy G. Docherty A.J. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although these chains form hydrogen bonds with neighboring main chain amines at the ends of strands 2 within each blade, their carbonyl groups that face the tunnel center are supposed to bind a calcium ion with the typical calcium-oxygen distances of 2.32–2.51 Å together with two water molecules (distances 2.8 and 2.5 Å) in an octahedral conformation. In the center of this tunnel, a chloride ion is most likely tetragonally surrounded by four main chain amide groups of Ile268, Ala312, Ala361, and Val410 (distances 3.42–3.61 Å), whereas the same amino acids probably also coordinate a sodium ion with their carbonyl oxygens at distances of 2.19–2.39 Å. Interaction of the Prodomain with the Hpx Domain and the Effect on the Catalytic-Hpx Orientation—This is the first crystal structure to show an interaction between the Hpx domain and the prodomain of an MMP. This contact is mainly hydrophobic involving Phe289-Tyr290-Pro291 of the loop between β-sheets 3 and 4 on blade I of the Hpx domain and Gly53-Leu54-Lys55 in loop 2 and Asp61-Glu63 of helix 2 in the prodomain (Fig. 4). In addition, the side chain of Glu63 forms a hydrogen bond to the side chain of Tyr290 and a weak hydrogen bond to Asn287. Furthermore, a main chain hydrogen bond is formed between Lys55 N and Phe289 CO. This area of interaction between the pro and Hpx domain is about 265 Å2. Additional residues contribute to this interaction through a network of water molecules. The interaction of the Phe289-Tyr290-Pro291 region with the prodomain has a considerable effect on the local structure of this loop in the Hpx domain. When superimposing the Hpx domains of proMMP-1 and active porcine MMP-1 (average r.m.s.d. over 189 Cα ∼ 1.4 Å) the local change in conformation is evident (Fig. 5A). The biggest movement, up to 9 Å, is seen in the residues that interact with the prodomain, but the change in conformation extends well beyond these, including Arg285 to Glu294 (r.m.s.d. 4.4 Å on average, see Fig. 5B). When comparing the relative orientation of the catalytic and Hpx domain between the two molecules (molecules A and B) in the asymmetric unit, it is clear that they are slightly different (r.m.s.d. 2.76 Å, Fig. 6A), whereas the superimposed Hpx domains vary by only 0.37 Å within 189 Cα. In sum, in molecule B the Hpx domain “pulled closer” to the prodomain than in molecule A. The observation of a hydrogen bond between Phe223 CO and the Ser299 side chain OH and a weak hydrophobic interaction between Pro303 at the end of blade I with Phe188 of the catalytic domain indicates that the catalytic domain-Hpx conformation is quite different from the one observed in active porcine MMP-1. Indeed, superimposing proMMP-1 and MMP-1 on the basis of the catalytic domains confirms this (Fig. 6B). In porcine MMP-1 the Hpx domain is displaced about 5.4 Å compared with molecule A and 7.2 Å compared with molecule B (r.m.s.d. differences). This can be best described by an angle of about 11° formed by corresponding β-strands, which form the center of the central channel. In sum, the edges of the blade I and II are translated by about 5.2–7.5 Å in the direction of the proteinase domain. This rotation translation seems to occur around a pivot point formed by the guanidinium group of Arg281 in the Hpx domain which anchors in a hydrophilic pocket whose entrance is lined by"
https://openalex.org/W2081443978,"The novel angiogenic inducer CCN3 (NOV, nephroblastoma overexpressed) is a matricellular protein of the CCN family, which also includes CCN1 (CYR61), CCN2 (CTGF), CCN4 (WISP-1), CCN5 (WISP-2), and CCN6 (WISP-3). CCN3 is broadly expressed in derivatives of all three germ layers during mammalian development, and its deranged expression is associated with vascular injury and a broad range of tumors. We have shown that CCN3 promotes proangiogenic activities in vascular endothelial cells through integrin receptors and induces neovascularization in vivo (Lin, C. G., Leu, S. J., Chen, N., Tebeau, C. M., Lin, S. X., Yeung, C. Y., and Lau, L. F. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 24200-24208). In this study, we show that CCN3 is highly expressed in granulation tissue of cutaneous wounds 5-7 days after injury and is capable of inducing responses in primary fibroblasts consistent with wound healing. Purified CCN3 supports primary skin fibroblast adhesion through integrins alpha(5)beta(1) and alpha(6)beta(1) and induces fibroblast chemotaxis through integrin alpha(v)beta(5). We show that CCN3 is a novel ligand of alpha(v)beta(5) in a solid phase binding assay. Although not mitogenic on its own, CCN3 also enhances basic fibroblast growth factor-induced DNA synthesis. Furthermore, CCN3 up-regulates MMP-1 and PAI-1 expression but interacts with TGF-beta1 in an antagonistic or synergistic manner to regulate the expression of specific genes. These findings, together with its angiogenic activity, support a role for CCN3 in cutaneous wound healing in skin fibroblasts and establish its matricellular mode of action through integrin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1978206537,"The pediocin-like bacteriocins contain two domains: a cationic N-terminal β-sheet domain that mediates binding of the bacteriocin to the target cell surface and a more hydrophobic C-terminal hairpin-like domain that penetrates into the hydrophobic part of the target cell membrane. The two domains are joined by a hinge, which enables movement of the domains relative to each other. In this study, 12 different hybrid bacteriocins were constructed by exchanging domains between 5 different bacteriocins. The hybrid bacteriocins were by and large highly potent (i.e. similar potencies as the parental bacteriocins) when constructed such that the recombination point was in the hinge region, indicating that the two domains function independently. The use of optimal recombination points was, however, crucial. Shifting the recombination point just one residue from the hinge could reduce the activity of the hybrid by 3–4 orders of magnitude. Most interestingly, the active hybrids displayed target cell specificities similar to those of the parental bacteriocin from which their membrane-penetrating C-terminal hairpin domain was derived. The results also indicate that the negatively charged aspartate reside in the hinge of most pediocin-like bacteriocins interacts with the C-terminal hairpin domain, perhaps by interacting with the positively charged residue that is present at one of the last three positions in the C-terminal end of most pediocin-like bacteriocins. Bacteria that produce pediocin-like bacteriocins also produce a cognate immunity protein that protects the producer from being killed by its own bacteriocin. Four different active hybrid immunity proteins constructed by exchanging regions between three different immunity proteins were tested for their ability to confer immunity to the hybrid bacteriocins. The results showed that the C-terminal half of the immunity proteins contains a region that directly or indirectly specifically recognizes the membrane-penetrating C-terminal hairpin domain of pediocin-like bacteriocins. The implications these results have on how pediocin-like bacteriocins and their immunity proteins interact with cellular specificity determinants (for instance a putative bacteriocin receptor) are discussed.

The implications these results have on how pediocin-like bacteriocins and their immunity proteins interact with cellular specificity determinants (for instance a putative bacteriocin receptor) are discussed. Many Gram-positive bacteria produce ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, often termed bacteriocins. One important and well studied class of bacteriocins is the pediocin-like bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (1Ennahar S. Sashihara T. Sonomoto K. Ishizaki A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 85-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Nissen-Meyer J. Nes I.F. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). At least 20 different pediocin-like bacteriocins have been characterized (1Ennahar S. Sashihara T. Sonomoto K. Ishizaki A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 85-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Nissen-Meyer J. Nes I.F. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 3Fimland G. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9508-9515Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These bacteriocins are all cationic, display anti-Listeria activity, and kill target cells by permeabilizing the cell membrane (4Chikindas M.L. García-Garcerá M.J. Driessen A.J. Ledeboer A.M.

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1999; 76: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). They contain between 37 and 48 residues and have very similar primary structures. Despite their extensive sequence similarity, they differ markedly in their target cell specificity (6Nes I.F. Holo H. Fimland G. Hauge H.H. Nissen-Meyer J. Dutton J.D. Haxell M.A. McArthur H.A.I.

Nes I.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3275-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This difference in target cell specificity combined with their extensive sequence similarity makes the group of pediocin-like bacteriocins a well suited model system for analyzing the relationship between the structure and the target cell specificity of membrane-permeabilizing cationic antimicrobial peptides.Based on their primary structures, the peptide chains of pediocin-like bacteriocins may be divided roughly into two regions: a hydrophilic, cationic and highly conserved N-terminal region, and a less conserved hydrophobic/amphiphilic C-terminal region (8Fimland G. Blingsmo O.R. Sletten K. Jung G. Nes I.F. Nissen-Meyer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3313-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NMR studies indicate that the N-terminal region forms a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet supported by a conserved disulfide bridge (9Uteng M. Hauge H.H. Markwick P.R. Fimland G. Mantzilas D.

This N-terminal β-sheet region is followed by a central amphiphilic α-helix and this in turn by a rather extended C-terminal tail that folds back onto the central α-helix, thereby creating a hairpin-like structure in the C-terminal half (9Uteng M.

There is a flexible hinge between the β-sheet N-terminal region and the hairpin-like C-terminal region, and one thus obtains two domains that may move relative to each other (9Uteng M. Hauge H.H. Markwick P.R. Fimland G. Mantzilas D. Nissen-Meyer J. Muhle-Goll C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11417-11426Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The cationic N-terminal β-sheet domain appears to mediate binding of the pediocin-like bacteriocins to the target cell surface through electrostatic interactions (12Chen Y. Ludescher R.D.

The hinge apparently provides the structural flexibility that enables the C-terminal hairpin domain to dip into the hydrophobic part of the membrane (Ref. 9Uteng M. Hauge H.H. Markwick P.R.

Microbiol. 1995; 17: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The primary structures of at least 17 immunity proteins of pediocin-like bacteriocins have been deduced from DNA sequences (21Fimland G. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3661-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These immunity proteins consist of 88–115 amino acid residues, and they display 5–85% sequence similarities (7Eijsink V.G. Skeie M. Middelhoven P.H. Brurberg M.B. Nes I.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3275-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins show a high degree of specificity with respect to the bacteriocin they recognize, although there may in some cases be some cross-immunity (i.e. some immunity proteins render cells immune to a few pediocin-like bacteriocins in addition to their cognate bacteriocin) (21Fimland G. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3661-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of the immunity proteins apparently contains a region that is involved in specific recognition of the bacteriocin to which they confer immunity (22Johnsen L. Fimland G. Mantzilas D. Nissen-Meyer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The mode of action of the immunity proteins is not known, but it has been suggested that they may act by disturbing the interaction between the bacteriocin and a (putative) membrane-located bacteriocin receptor (18Quadri L.E. Sailer M. Terebiznik M.R. Roy K.L. Vederas J.C. Stiles M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1144-1151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nissen-Meyer J. Håvarstein L.S. Holo H. Sletten K. Nes I.F. J. Gen.

Microbiol. 1994; 14: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The immunity proteins for the two pediocin-like bacteriocins mesentericin Y105 and carnobacteriocin B2 have been shown to be located intracellularly, a small proportion (about 1%) possibly being associated with the cell membrane (16Dayem M.A. Fleury Y. Devilliers G. Chaboisseau E. Girard R. Nicolas P. Delfour A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 138: 251-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Quadri L.E. Sailer M. Terebiznik M.R. Roy K.L. Vederas J.C. Stiles M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1144-1151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recently reported NMR solution structure of the immunity protein for carnobacteriocin B2 has revealed that the protein consists of an antiparallel four-helix bundle (helix 1–4) with the C-terminal region (containing a fifth helix and an extended strand) being packed approximately in a perpendicular manner across helix 3 and 4 (25Sprules T. Kawulka K.E. Vederas J.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11740-11749Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).It has been proposed that the C-terminal region of pediocin-like bacteriocins is important in determining their target cell specificity because pediocin-like variants that are altered in the C-terminal region by site-directed in vitro mutagenesis often differ from the wild-type in their target cell specificity (3Fimland G. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9508-9515Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 26Fimland G. Johnsen L. Axelsson L. Brurberg M.B. Nes I.F. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2643-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The fact that 15-mer fragments starting from the central hinge region and going toward the C-terminal part of pediocin PA-1, but not fragments from the N-terminal half, inhibit pediocin PA-1 to a greater extent than other closely related pediocin-like bacteriocins also suggests that the C-terminal hairpin domain contains important specificity determinants (27Fimland G. Jack R. Jung G. Nes I.F. Nissen-Meyer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 5057-5060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the fact that hybrid bacteriocins containing N- and C-terminal regions from different pediocin-like bacteriocins have relative target cell specificities similar to that of the bacteriocins from which the C-terminal region is derived indicates that the C-terminal domain contains important specificity determinants (8Fimland G. Blingsmo O.R. Sletten K. Jung G. Nes I.F. Nissen-Meyer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3313-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, with one exception, all of the hybrid bacteriocins in this latter study (8Fimland G. Blingsmo O.R. Sletten K. Jung G. Nes I.F. Nissen-Meyer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3313-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were 100–1,000 times less potent than the parental bacteriocins. Thus only relative specificities were determined, and this introduced some uncertainty into the interpretation of the results using hybrid bacteriocins (8Fimland G. Blingsmo O.R. Sletten K. Jung G. Nes I.F. Nissen-Meyer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3313-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of pediocin-like bacteriocins suggests that more optimal hybrid bacteriocins may be constructed if one uses the hinge as the recombination point and thereby exchange complete domains between bacteriocins. In this study, we have constructed potent hybrid bacteriocins using this approach and used these to show that the C-terminal membrane-penetrating hairpin domain is in fact the major specificity determinant. Moreover, using hybrid immunity proteins, we show that the C-terminal half of cognate immunity proteins specifically recognizes the C-terminal hairpin domain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Media—The hybrid bacteriocins Sak/Ped-17/18, Ent/Sak-17/18, Sak/Ent-17/18, Sak/Leu-17/18, Leu/Sak-16/17, Leu/Sak-17/18, Cur/Sak-17/18, Cur/Sak-18/19, Sak/Cur-16/17, Sak/Cur-17/18, and Sak/Cur-18/19 (for a description of these hybrid bacteriocins, see “Results”) were produced by Lactobacillus sake LB790 transformed with a plasmid containing the hybrid bacteriocin gene. The wild-type bacteriocin producer strains used in this study were Lactobacillus curvatus LTH1174 producing curvacin A (28Tichaczek P.S. Vogel R.F. Hammes W.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), Enterococcus faecium CTC492 producing enterocin A (29Aymerich T. Holo H. Håvarstein L.S. Hugas M. Garriga M. Nes I.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 1676-1682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Leuconostoc mesenteroides 6 producing leucocin A (30Vaughan A. Eijsink V.G. O'Sullivan T.F. O'Hanlon K. van Sinderen D. J. Appl. Microbiol. 2001; 91: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and Pediococcus acidilactici LMG 2351 producing pediocin PA-1 (31Nieto Lozano J.C. Meyer J.N. Sletten K. Peláz C. Nes I.F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 1985-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Sakacin P was produced by the two-plasmid L. sake LB790(pSAK20/pSSP2) heterologous expression system described earlier (32Axelsson L. Katla T. Bjørnslett M. Eijsink V.G. Holck A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 168: 137-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The indicator strains used for (hybrid) bacteriocin activity measurements were L. sake NCDO 2714, Carnobacterium piscicola LMG 2332, Pediococcus pentosaceus LMG 2722, and Lactobacillus sp. strain LMG 2003. L. sake NCDO 2714 and Enterococcus faecalis NCDO 581 containing a plasmid with or without an inserted (hybrid) immunity gene were used as indicator strains for assaying (hybrid) bacteriocin activity against (hybrid) immunity proteins. All LAB strains were grown in MRS broth (Oxoid) at 30 °C. Agar plates for all LAB transformants were made by adding 1.5% agar to MRS broth. Selective antibiotic concentrations used for L. sake (containing plasmid) were 2 μg/ml erythromycin for initial selection and 5 μg/ml for normal growth, and they were 5 and 10 μg/ml, respectively, for E. faecalis. The LAB-Escherichia coli shuttle vector pMG36e (33van de Guchte M. van der Vossen J.M. Kok J. Venema G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 224-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the strong constitutive P32 promoter was used to express the (hybrid) immunity genes. The expression plasmid pLJ100 was used to express the hybrid bacteriocins.Plasmid Isolation and Transformation—All plasmid isolations from both E. coli and LAB were done using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). Lysis of LAB strains was performed by adding lysozyme to resuspension buffer (Qiagen) to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml. The Bio-Rad gene pulser was used for all electroporations. L. sake was made electrocompetent and transformed as described by Aukrust et al. (34Aukrust T.W. Brurberg M.B. Nes I.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 47: 201-208PubMed Google Scholar). After growth from A610 0.1 to 0.6 in the presence of 2% (w/v) glycine, the cells were washed in 1 mm MgCl2 followed by a wash in 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1500 (molecular mass 1,300–1,600 Da) before electroporation. Electrocompetent E. faecalis was produced by growing it overnight in M17 containing 7% (w/v) glycine and 0.5 m sucrose at 37 °C. The cells were thereafter washed twice in 0.5 m sucrose containing 10% (v/v) glycerol (35Shepard B.D. Gilmore M.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 47: 217-226PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of expression plasmid in transformed LAB strains was determined by spectrophotometric quantification using a Bio Photometer instrument (Eppendorf). The plasmid copy number was estimated to be between 30 and 80 copies/cell. E. coli DH5α cells were made competent using the CaCl2 method (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Habor, NY1989: 1.82-1.84Google Scholar) and transformed by heat shock (42 °C, 2 min).PCR and DNA Sequencing—Eurogentec (Belgium) produced all oligonucleotides used in this study. The hybrid immunity genes and the hybrid bacteriocin genes were amplified by PCR using a standard amplification protocol on a PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research).The DNA sequences of the cloned hybrid bacteriocin genes and the hybrid immunity genes were verified by automated DNA sequence determination, using a MegaBase DNA analysis system and the DYEnamic ET Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences).Construction of Hybrid Bacteriocin Expression Plasmids and Plasmids Containing Hybrid Immunity Genes—To express the hybrid bacteriocins, a BglII restriction site was introduced by PCR between the genes pedB and pedC in the pMC117 (37Chikindas M.L. Venema K. Ledeboer A.M. Venema G. Kok J. Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 1995; 21: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) plasmid, which resulted in the plasmid pLJ100. PCR fragments containing the pediocin leader sequence, the hybrid bacteriocin sequence, and the immunity sequence belonging to the latter part of the hybrid bacteriocin were cloned in pLJ100 using the SacI and BamHI/BglII sites of fragments and vector. The resulting plasmids contained an operon consisting of the genes hybXY (pediocin leader and hybrid bacteriocin XY), imY (immunity sequence belonging to the latter part of the hybrid bacteriocin), pedC (which specifies a 174-amino acid membrane protein required for pediocin secretion), and pedD (codes for a protein that belongs to the ATP-dependent translocators family and which cleaves off the pediocin leader) (20Venema K.

Microbiol. 1992; 58: 2360-2367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).PCR fragments containing the hybrid immunity genes, ent/orf-im, orf/ent-im, ent/leu-im, leu/ent-im, orf/leu-im, and leu/orf-im, with flanking SacI and XbaI sites, were constructed using the PCR megaprimer method and cloned into the SacI and XbaI sites of pMG36e. The plasmids used as templates in the PCRs, pEAIM, pLIM, and pORFY, are described by Dayem et al. (16Dayem M.A. Fleury Y. Devilliers G. Chaboisseau E. Girard R. Nicolas P. Delfour A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 138: 251-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Production, Synthesis, and Purification of (Hybrid) Bacteriocins— Enterocin A, leucocin A, pediocin PA-1, curvacin A, and sakacin P and 11 hybrid bacteriocins were purified to homogeneity from 0.5- or 1.0-liter cultures of their producer strains by cation exchange and reverse phase chromatography, as described previously (39Uteng M. Hauge H.H. Brondz I. Nissen-Meyer J. Fimland G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The purity of the bacteriocins was analyzed by analytical chromatography on a μRPC SC 2.1/10 C2C18 column (Amersham Biosciences) using the SMART chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) and water/2-propanol containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, as the mobile phase. Ped/Sak-21/22 was synthesized using an Applied Biosystems model 430A peptide synthesizer and the standard tert-butoxycarbonyl synthesis protocol of the manufacturer and purified as described previously (8Fimland G. Blingsmo O.R. Sletten K. Jung G. Nes I.F. Nissen-Meyer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3313-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary structure of all the hybrid bacteriocins was confirmed by mass spectrometry on a Voyager-DE RP matrix assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems); 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was used as matrix. Correct disulfide bridge formation for peptides that contained four cysteine residues was confirmed by cleavage of the peptides with endoproteinase Asp-N (Roche Applied Science) followed by analysis of the resulting fragments with mass spectrometry.Bacteriocin Assay—Bacteriocin activity was measured using a microtiter plate assay system, essentially as described previously (40Nissen-Meyer J. Holo H. Håvarstein L.S. Sletten K. Nes I.F. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5686-5692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each well of a microtiter plate contained 200 μl of culture medium with bacteriocin fraction at 2-fold dilutions and an indicator strain at an A610 of about 0.01 (inoculated from a 16–20-h overnight culture at 30 °C). The microtiter plate cultures were incubated overnight (14–16 h) at 30 °C, after which growth of the indicator strain was measured spectrophotometrically at 610 nm with a microtiter plate reader. The MIC 1The abbreviation used is: MIC, minimal inhibition concentration. was defined as the concentration of bacteriocin that inhibited growth of the indicator strain by 50%. The MIC values that are presented are the result of at least five independent measurements and had standard deviations of less than 50% of the value. Transformed indicator strains were grown in the presence of 5 μg of erythromycin/ml to ensure that the plasmid containing the immunity gene was maintained in the cells. The protection pattern of each of the (hybrid) immunity proteins was judged by comparing MIC values for a strain expressing a hybrid immunity gene with MIC values for the same strain containing the unmodified pMG36e plasmid.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONConstruction of Hybrid Bacteriocins by Combining the N- and C-terminal Domains of Various Pediocin-like Bacteriocins—Twelve different hybrid bacteriocins (Sak/Ped-17/18, Ped/Sak-21/22, Ent/Sak-17/18, Sak/Ent-17/18, Sak/Leu-17/18, Leu/Sak-16/17, Leu/Sak-17/18, Cur/Sak-17/18, Cur/Sak-18/19, Sak/Cur-16/17, Sak/Cur-17/18, and Sak/Cur-18/19) derived from five different wild-type bacteriocins (enterocin A, sakacin P, pediocin PA-1, leucocin A, and curvacin A) were constructed (Fig. 2). The numbers associated with each hybrid bacteriocin indicate the two residues that adjoin the recombination point (Fig. 2). With a few exceptions, the recombination point was chosen to be between residues 16 and 17 and/or between 17 and 18 when constructing the hybrid bacteriocins (Fig. 2) because structural studies (9Uteng M. Hauge H.H. Markwick P.R. Fimland G. Mantzilas D. Nissen-Meyer J. Muhle-Goll C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11417-11426Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) indicate that the hinge is at residue 17. Ped/Sak-21/22 was one exception because its recombination point was between residues 21 and 22 (Fig. 2). In a previous study this hybrid was shown to have the same potency as the parental bacteriocins (pediocin PA-1 and sakacin P) (8Fimland G. Blingsmo O.R. Sletten K. Jung G. Nes I.F. Nissen-Meyer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3313-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it was consequently retained for this study. It was obtained through peptide synthesis, in contrast to the other hybrid bacteriocins that were produced by L. sake LB790 transformed with a plasmid containing the hybrid bacteriocin gene.Fig. 2Amino acid sequences of sakacin P, pediocin PA-1, enterocin A, leucocin A, curvacin A, and the 12 hybrid bacteriocins. For the hybrid bacteriocins, the bold type indicates amino acids derived from the N-terminal part of the parental bacteriocin, and the normal type indicates the amino acids derived from the C-terminal part of the parental bacteriocin. The amino acids are numbered 1 from K in the KYYNG motif (amino acid 6 for enterocin A and amino acid 2 for curvacin A). An unintended conservative mutation (Val to Ile), which did not appear to affect the activity, was introduced into Cur/Sak-17/18 in position 16.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Pediocin PA-1 and enterocin A contain two cysteine residues in their C-terminal domain in addition to the two cysteine residues present in the N-terminal domain of all pediocin-like bacteriocins (Fig. 2). Consequently, two of the hybrid bacteriocins, Sak/Ent-17/18 and Sak/Ped-17/18, contained four cysteine residues (Fig. 2). To ensure correct formation of disulfide bridges in these two hybrid bacteriocins, all hybrid bacteriocins (except Ped/Sak-21/22, which was synthesized) were constructed with a pediocin-leader and using a production plasmid that contained the genes pedC and pedD encoding the pediocin PA-1 secretion machinery (20Venema K.

https://openalex.org/W1990133999,"Previous studies from our laboratory indicated that expression of the MLH1 DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene was necessary to restore cytotoxicity and an efficient G2 arrest in HCT116 human colon cancer cells, as well as Mlh1–/– murine embryonic fibroblasts, after treatment with 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (FdUrd). Here, we show that an identical phenomenon occurred when expression of MSH2, the other major MMR gene, was restored in HEC59 human endometrial carcinoma cells or was present in adenovirus E1A-immortalized Msh2+/+ (compared with isogenic Msh2–/–) murine embryonic stem cells. Because MMR status had little effect on cellular responses (i.e. G2 arrest and lethality) to the thymidylate synthase inhibitor, Tomudex, and a greater level of [3H]FdUrd incorporation into DNA was found in MMR-deficient cells, we concluded that the differential FdUrd cytotoxicity between MMR-competent and MMR-deficient cells was mediated at the level of DNA incorporation. Analyses of ATPase activation suggested that the hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimer only recognized FdUrd moieties (as the base 5-fluorouracil (FU) in DNA) when mispaired with guanine, but not paired with adenine. Furthermore, analyses of incorporated FdUrd using methyl-CpG-binding domain 4 glycosylase indicated that there was more misincorporated FU:Gua in the DNA of MMR-deficient HCT116 cells. Our data provide the first demonstration that MMR specifically detects FU:Gua (in the first round of DNA replication), signaling a sustained G2 arrest and lethality.

Importantly, this enables cancer cells to uncouple persistent DNA damage from cell death, resulting in increased drug resistance (14Goldmacher V.S. Cuzick Jr., R.A. Thilly W.G. J. Biol.

The two major gene products that comprise MMR are MSH2 (which heterodimerizes with MSH3 or MSH6 to recognize mispairs and loops in DNA) and MLH1 (which heterodimerizes with PMS2 or MLH3 to act as a molecular matchmaker between the MSH2 complex and other DNA repair/replication and perhaps cell cycle factors) (17Marti T.M.

Defects in these two genes account for most cases of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, a familial condition with a predisposition to cancers of the colon, endometrium, stomach, ovary, and biliary tracts (19Lynch H.T.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5193-5201PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that cells deficient in MLH1 are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of FU and FdUrd. Because FPs are the agents of choice in the treatment of colorectal cancer, understanding potential resistance mechanisms is important. FPs exert cytotoxic effects through incorporation into RNA and/or DNA, as well as inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TS). The inhibition of TS, which is the central enzyme of de novo pyrimidine synthesis, leads to decreases in intracellular dTTP pools; this depletion results in immediate cytostatic effects (via inhibition of DNA synthesis) and alters dNTP pool sizes (thus increasing the error rate of DNA polymerase) (25Meyers M. Hwang A. Wagner M.W. Bruening A.J. Veigl M.L. Sedwick W.D. Boothman D.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7376-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A hallmark of MMR deficiency is instability in the length of repetitive sequences in DNA, referred to as microsatellite instability (MSI). This reflects the inability of MMR-deficient cells to correct insertions and deletions in their DNA that result from polymerase slippage at these sequences (26Strand M. Prolla T.A. Liskay R.M. Petes T.D. Nature. 1993; 365: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). It is also an easily measured clinical marker. Due to the resistance of MMR-deficient (i.e. MSI+) cancer cells to FU and FdUrd, one would expect that FP treatment of these cells would be detrimental. Indeed, three recent clinical reports have found that standard, FU-based chemotherapy given to colon cancer patients with high levels of MSI did not result in a significant survival advantage (27Goel A.

These studies concluded that FU therapy for MSI+ cancers was not indicated. However, the mechanisms of MMR-dependent death after FP exposure remain unclear. In this report, we used two different genetically matched systems to show that a deficiency in MSH2, as previously noted for MLH1, resulted in resistance to FdUrd, with an accompanying defect in G2 arrest. We show that these responses occurred within one replication cycle in the presence of FdUrd, suggesting that MMR directly detects FdUrd lesions in DNA rather than some secondary signal. Determination of overall [3H]FdUrd incorporation into DNA indicated that higher levels of FdUrd were present in the DNA of MMR-deficient cells, suggesting direct detection and repair of FdUrd lesions in DNA by MMR. Consistent with these data, we show that the hMSH2-hMSH6 complex recognized FdUrd in DNA when paired with Gua (i.e. as an FU:Gua base pair); however, it did not recognize FU:Ade lesions. We believe that MMR directly detects FU:Gua in DNA and that the MMR-mediated response to this lesion appears to be lethal. The exact mechanism of this lethality is not yet known. Reagents and Chemicals—FdUrd and 6-TG were purchased from Sigma. Tomudex (i.e. ICI D1694, ZD1694, or Raltitrexed) was generously provided by AstraZeneca (Cheshire, UK). Radiolabeled FdUrd ([6-3H]FdUrd, 13.9 Ci/mmol) and dGua ([8-3H]dGua, 5.1 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Oligonucleotides with various mispairings were prepared as described previously (30Berardini M. Mazurek A. Fishel R. J. Biol.

Richard Boland (University of California, San Diego), in which a normal human chromosome 3 (which contains the MLH1 gene) was introduced by microcell fusion into HCT116 (an MLH1-deficient human colon cancer cell line) to generate HCT116 3-6 cells (10Koi M.

Msh2–/– and Msh2+/+ murine embryonic stem (ES) cells were generously provided by Dr. Niels de Wind (Leiden University, The Netherlands), in which the Msh2–/– knock-out ES dMsh2-9 and isogenic Msh2+/+ wt-2 cell lines were each infected with a retroviral vector containing the adenovirus E1A gene (31de Wind N.

Hwang H.-S. Kinsella T.J. Boothman D.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5193-5201PubMed Google Scholar) and were consistently free of Mycoplasma contamination. Clonogenic Survival Assays—Survival was assessed by colony-forming ability as described (9Meyers M. Wagner M.W. Hwang H.-S. Kinsella T.J. Boothman D.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5193-5201PubMed Google Scholar). However, treatment of HEC59 and HEC59 2-4 cells with Tomudex was performed in medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, UT) plus 10% dialyzed FBS to lower serum dThd levels and thus sensitize these cells to Tomudex treatment. All drugs were present continuously throughout the assay, with fresh medium and drug added every 3 days. Colonies were defined as 50 normal appearing cells originating from a single plated cell. Cell Cycle Analyses—Cell cycle distribution was determined by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry as described (9Meyers M. Wagner M.W. Hwang H.-S. Kinsella T.J. Boothman D.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5193-5201PubMed Google Scholar). For the synchronization experiments outlined in Figs. 2, 3, 4, HCT116 and HCT116 3-6 cells were synchronized by arrest in G0-G1 via confluence and low serum treatments, followed by sub-confluent release into medium containing 10% FBS as described (9Meyers M.

Kalman T.I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 2319-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). ATPase Assays—MMR activity assays, reflected by ATPase activity assessments, were performed as described previously (30Berardini M. Mazurek A. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27851-27857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The DNA duplex was formed by annealing the upper strand, 5′-GCT TAG GAT CAT CGA GGA TCU AGC TCG GTG CAA TTC AGC GG-3′, to its complement, where U represents Ura, FU, or Thy, opposite Ade or Gua, or it represents an unpaired Cyt-Ade loop. Overexpression and purification of hMSH2-hMSH6 and hMSH2-hMSH3 complexes were performed as described (33Mazurek A. Berardini M. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8260-8266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in reaction buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.1, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol, and 240 nm of the respective DNA substrate. Unlabeled ATP was added into each reaction at final concentrations of 20–240 μm for hMSH2-hMSH6 and 0.5–32 μm for hMSH2-hMSH3 complexes. The final concentration of [γ-32P]ATP for each reaction was fixed at 17 nm. Assays were performed for 30 min at 37 °C, stopped with 0.4 ml of 10% (w/v) charcoal in 1 mm EDTA, and placed on ice for 30 min. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were collected and counted in a RackBeta 1209 liquid scintillation counter (Amersham Biosciences). Data were then fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to generate values for Km and Vmax(kcat). [3H]FdUrd Incorporation into DNA—Incorporation of radioactive FdUrd into DNA was performed using a modification of a previous procedure (34Briggle T.V. Boothman D.A. Pfaffenberger C.D. Greer S. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 381: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Cells were treated for 3 days with various concentrations of FdUrd spiked with 20–50 μCi of [3H]FdUrd. DNA of exposed or non-exposed control cells was purified using DNeasy tissue methodology (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated DNA was treated with 500 μg/ml DNase-free RNase A (Sigma) to remove RNA. Radioactivity was counted using an LS 3801 liquid scintillation counter (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). The amount of incorporated [3H]FdUrd (as femtomoles/μg of DNA) was calculated from the specific activity of [3H]FdUrd (after correction for amount of labeled FdUrd relative to non-labeled FdUrd), and the amount of genomic DNA was assayed (i.e. micrograms of DNA as measured by ultraviolet absorbance at 260 nm). Glycosylase Assays—Various radiolabeled oligonucleotides were treated with uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) from Escherichia coli or human methyl-CpG-binding domain 4 glycosylase (MBD4; purified to apparent homogeneity by fast-protein liquid chromatography after overexpressing the MBD4 open reading frame containing an N-terminal His6 tag from a human testis cDNA library in E. coli) and subjected to a cleavage assay as described (35Bellacosa A. Cicchillitti L. Schepis F. Riccio A. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Golemis E.A. Genuardi M. Neri G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These enzymes detect and remove Ura from DNA; UDG removes Ura regardless of its base-pairing partner (38Krokan H.E. Nilsen H. Skorpen F. Otterlei M. Slupphaug G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), whereas MBD4 requires Ura to be paired with Gua to remove it (36Hendrich B. Hardeland U. Ng H.-H. Jiricny J. Bird A. Nature. 1999; 401: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 37Petronzelli F. Riccio A. Markham G.D. Seeholzer S.H. Stoerker J. Genuardi M. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Bellacosa A. J. Biol.

Tseng B.Y. Goulian M. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 998-1001PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, purified UDG or MBD4 was incubated with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide duplexes (labeled only on the strand containing Ura or FU) having a centrally located Ura:Ade or Ura:Gua (for UDG) or FU:Ade or FU:Gua (for MBD4) base pair. Upon detection of Ura or FU, these glycosylases cleave the N-glycosyl bond linking the Ura or FU base to the sugar, thus generating an abasic site. Strong alkali treatment then cleaves the sugar-phosphate backbone of any DNA strand containing an abasic site. Therefore, electrophoretic separation of glycosylase- and alkali-treated samples on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by visualization upon exposure to x-ray film allows the identification of any reaction product (and hence evidence of the appropriate lesion in the substrate) by the appearance of a smaller band. Double-stranded oligonucleotide substrates of the sequence 5′-GCT TAG GAT CAT CGA GGA TCU GAC TCG GTG CAA TTC AGC GG-3′ and its complement, where U represents Ura or FU opposite Ade or Gua, and Gua (in the UpG context) is preceded by an unmethylated Cyt (i.e. CpG) or methylated Cyt (i.e. meCpG), were prepared by end-labeling with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, and then annealed. Labeled duplex (20 nm) was incubated with 100 ng of purified UDG or MBD4 in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction product was then heated to 95 °C for 5 min in the presence of 0.1 m NaOH to cleave the DNA at abasic sites. Gel loading dye (80% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol, and 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue) was added to each sample. Sizes of cleaved compared with full-length oligonucleotides were analyzed following electrophoresis on 20% DNA sequencing gels. This assay demonstrated the specificity of MBD4 for FU:Gua. FU-binding Partner Analyses in Genomic DNA from MMR-deficient Cells—HCT116 or HCT116 3-6 cells (2 × 106) were incubated continuously with 2.5 μm (278 μCi) [3H]FdUrd for 3 or 10 days, and genomic DNA was extracted as above. Parallel exposures for 3 or 10 days were done using 12 μCi of [3H]dGua in the presence of unlabeled FdUrd (2.5 μm) to account for any differences in DNA replication between HCT116 and HCT116 3-6 cells; concomitant FdUrd exposure decreased [3H]dGua uptake into DNA by 20 ± 5% in HCT116 cells after 3 days and increased [3H]dGua in DNA by 27 ± 7% in HCT116 3-6 cells after 3 days. Purified nucleic acid from [3H]FdUrd-exposed cells was treated twice with 500 μg/ml DNase-free RNase A, and residual nucleotides were removed using Sephadex G-25 QuickSpin columns (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA (0.10–0.25 μg) was treated with 100 μg of MBD4 in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.55, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 16 h. MBD4 releases Ura or FU only if hydrogen-bonded to Gua (37Petronzelli F. Riccio A. Markham G.D. Seeholzer S.H. Stoerker J. Genuardi M. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Bellacosa A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32422-32429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Reaction products (Ura and/or [3H]FU) were isolated using Sephadex G-25 QuickSpin columns as above. The reaction products (trapped in the column resin) and bulk genomic DNA (in the column eluate) were counted using a Beckman LS 3801 liquid scintillation counter. Values were corrected for background radioactivity and non-enzyme-mediated [3H]FU release. The percentage of [3H]FU released due to MBD4 treatment was calculated as the amount of product divided by the total radioactivity (i.e. the amount of substrate and product), then multiplied by 100%. This percentage was then normalized for the amount of DNA replication using relative [3H]dGua incorporation to yield the percentage of FU incorporated as FU:Gua in DNA, normalized for DNA replication. Western Blot Analyses—Whole cell extracts were prepared from log-phase cells and Western blots were prepared as described (40Meyers M. Theodosiou M. Acharya S. Odegaard E. Wilson T. Lewis J.E. Davis T.W. Wilson-Van Patten C. Fishel R. Boothman D.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 206-208PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibodies (MBD4, 1:200; and α-tubulin, 1:2000) were obtained from Calbiochem/EMD Biosciences, Inc. (La Jolla, CA), and blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.03% Tween 20 (Sigma). Detection was performed using the appropriate anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate system (Pierce) on Fuji RX medical x-ray film (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). MBD4 levels were quantified using Image 1.63 (National Institutes of Health) and corrected for loading variations using α-tubulin levels. MSH2-deficient Cells Were Resistant to FdUrd, but Not Tomudex—Clonogenic survival assays were performed to determine the effect of loss of MMR on response to 6-TG, FdUrd, or Tomudex treatments (Fig. 1). A human colon cell line deficient in MLH1, as well as both human and mouse cell lines deficient in MSH2, were simultaneously examined. As previously shown (9Meyers M. Wagner M.W. Hwang H.-S. Kinsella T.J. Boothman D.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5193-5201PubMed Google Scholar, 41Davis T.W. Wilson-Van Patten C. Meyers M. Kunugi K.A. Cuthill S. Reznikoff C. Garces C. Boland C.R. Kinsella T.J. Fishel R. Boothman D.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 767-778PubMed Google Scholar), MLH1-deficient HCT116 cells were more resistant to 6-TG and FdUrd than their corrected, MMR-proficient HCT116 3-6 counterparts (Fig. 1, A and B). We then examined survival responses after treatment of these cells with the TS inhibitor, Tomudex. Whereas FdUrd has two major DNA-directed mechanisms of cell killing (i.e. DNA incorporation and inhibition of TS), Tomudex specifically inhibits TS; thus, treatment with Tomudex allows one to discriminate the relative contributions of DNA incorporation versus TS inhibition in MMR-dependent, FdUrd-mediated cell killing. We noted very little difference in the survival of MMR-proficient versus MMR-deficient cells following Tomudex treatment, regardless of MLH1 status (Fig. 1C). TS activity in HCT116 cells was 0.208 ± 0.003 pmol/106 cells/min, compared with 0.304 ± 0.005 for HCT116 3-6 cells. Thus, differential TS activity appeared to explain the minor differences in cytotoxicity we found between these cells; increased resistance to TS inhibition has been correlated with increased TS levels (42Drake J.C. Allegra C.J. Moran R.G. Johnston P.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1349-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 43Wang W. Marsh S. Cassidy J. McLeod H.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5505-5510PubMed Google Scholar). If corrected for differential TS activities, near identical dose-response survival curves for HCT116 versus HCT116 3-6 cells were noted in response to Tomudex, suggesting that incorporation of FdUrd into DNA accounted for the difference in survival between these cells. Survival was then assessed in HEC59 human endometrial carcinoma cells, which are deficient in MSH2, compared with their corrected HEC59 2-4 counterparts (Fig. 1, D–F). MMR-deficient HEC59 cells were more resistant to 6-TG and FdUrd. As with MMR-proficient HCT116 3-6 cells, MMR+ HEC59 2-4 cells survived better than isogenic MMR– HEC59 cells following Tomudex treatments. The same trend after treatment with these three agents was also found when comparing Msh2–/– to Msh2+/+ murine ES cells (Fig. 1, G–I). In all three cell systems, the MMR-deficient cells consistently displayed a substantial resistance to FdUrd (Fig. 1, B, E, and H) and a much smaller sensitivity to Tomudex (Fig. 1, C, F, and I). Thus, sensitivity to FdUrd was not merely specific to the expression of MLH1 and appeared not to simply reflect differences in"

Our crystallographic analysis reveals that PLSCR1 NLS binds to armadillo repeats 1–4 of importin α, but its interaction partially overlaps the classical NLS binding site. Two PLSCR1 lysines occupy the canonical positions indicated as P2 and P5. Moreover, we present in vivo evidence that the critical lysine at position P2, which is essential in other known NLS sequences, is dispensable in PLSCR1 NLS. Taken together, these data provide insight into a novel nuclear localization signal that presents a distinct motif for binding to importin α."
https://openalex.org/W2093823051,"The p53 tumour suppressor functions as a transcriptional activator, and several p53-inducible genes that play a critical proapoptotic role have been described. Moreover, p53 regulates the expression of various proteins participating in autoregulatory feedback loops, including proteins that negatively control p53 stability (Mdm2 and Pirh2) or modulate stress-induced phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-46 (p53DINP1 or Wip1), a key event for p53-induced apoptosis. Here, we describe a new systematic analysis of p53 targets using oligonucleotide chips, and report the identification of dapk1 as a novel p53 target. We demonstrate that dapk1 mRNA levels increase in a p53-dependent manner in various cellular settings. Both human and mouse dapk1 genomic loci contain DNA sequences that bind p53 in vitro and in vivo. Since dapk1 encodes a serine/threonine kinase previously shown to suppress oncogene-induced transformation by activating a p19ARF/p53-dependent apoptotic checkpoint, our results suggest that Dapk1 participates in a new positive feedback loop controlling p53 activation and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2022668082,"The assembly of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters involves several pathways and in prokaryotes the mobilization of the sulfur (SUF) system is paramount for Fe-S biogenesis and repair during oxidative stress. The prokaryotic SUF system consists of six proteins: SufC is an ABC/ATPase that forms a complex with SufB and SufD, SufA acts as a scaffold protein, and SufE and SufS are involved in sulfur mobilization from cysteine. Despite the importance of Fe-S proteins in higher plant plastids, little is known regarding plastidic Fe-S cluster assembly. We have recently shown that Arabidopsis harbors an evolutionary conserved plastidic SufC protein (AtNAP7) capable of hydrolyzing ATP and interacting with the SufD homolog AtNAP6. Based on this and the prokaryotic SUF system we speculated that a SufB-like protein may exist in plastids. Here we demonstrate that the Arabidopsis plastid-localized SufB homolog AtNAP1 can complement SufB deficiency in Escherichia coli during oxidative stress. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AtNAP1 can interact with AtNAP7 inside living chloroplasts suggesting the presence of a plastidic AtNAP1·AtNAP6·AtNAP7 complex and remarkable evolutionary conservation of the SUF system. However, in contrast to prokaryotic SufB proteins with no associated ATPase activity we show that AtNAP1 is an iron-stimulated ATPase and that AtNAP1 is capable of forming homodimers.

Biol. 1999; 3: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although Fe-S clusters are derived from two of the most abundant elements on earth they are not formed spontaneously but arise by controlled biosynthesis requiring an intricate interplay of numerous proteins (3Lill R.

Biol. 2003; 7: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Most research on Fe-S cluster assembly has come from studies on bacteria, and it is clear that three bacterial systems exist termed NIF (nitrogen fixation), ISC (iron-sulfur cluster), and SUF (mobilization of sulfur) (5Takahashi Y.

The NIF system is specifically involved in the assembly and maturation of Fe-S clusters in nitrogenase proteins found in nitrogen-fixing bacteria and ϵ-proteobacteria (7Jacobsen M.R. Cash V.L.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16213-16219Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas the ISC system is more generally involved in the biosynthesis of numerous Fe-S proteins in both bacteria and higher eukaryotes (9Zheng L.

SufB, SufC, and SufD seem to be evolutionary conserved and in bacteria SufC, which is an ATP binding cassette (ABC)/ATPase, forms a complex with SufB and SufD (6Loiseau L. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S.

Although it is thought that this SufC·SufB·SufD complex acts as an ATP-driven energizer during Fe-S cluster assembly the role of SufB and SufD remains unknown. SufE interacts with SufS involved in cysteine desulfuration to mobilize sulfur and although SufE is capable of forming homodimers, the binding of SufE to SufS stimulates the cysteine desulfurase activity of SufS ∼50-fold (6Loiseau L. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Nachin L. Fontecave M. Barras F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38352-38359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). SufA acts as a scaffold protein involved in the assembly of Fe-S clusters and subsequent Fe-S cluster transfer to target apoproteins (14Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Lascoux D. Loiseau L. Barras F. Forest E. Fontecave M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that SufC is probably the most essential Suf protein in that SufC deficiency in E. coli results in a number of phenotypes related to oxidative stress and iron homeostasis, similar to mutants lacking the entire suf operon (13Nachin L.

Moreover, the recent observation that Arabidopsis harbors chloroplast-localized Nif proteins AtCpNIFS/AtNFS2, AtCnfU-V, and AtCnfU-IVb (17Pilon-Smits E.A. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S. Kato S.

Plant J. 2004; 37: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) demonstrates that plant Fe-S cluster biogenesis occurs in both mitochondria and plastids. In chloroplasts Fe-S clusters are required for cytochrome b6/f complex, ferredoxin and photosystem I ensuring electron flow in the thylakoids (21Raven J.A. Evans M.C.W. Korb R.E. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 111-150Crossref Google Scholar, 22Kapazoglou A. Mould R.M. Gray J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 352-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar); however, to date Fe-S cluster biogenesis in plastid is poorly understood. As a step toward understanding SUF-mediated Fe-S cluster assembly in plastids we have recently provided evidence that Arabidopsis plastids most probably contain a complete SUF system (23Xu X.M. M øller S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9143-9148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We have shown that the non-intrinsic ABC protein AtNAP7 is a functional ATPase and that it is a plastidic SufC-like protein (23Xu X.M. M øller S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9143-9148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As in bacteria, AtNAP7 appears to be involved in the maintenance and repair of oxidatively damaged Fe-S clusters in that AtNAP7 can complement growth defects observed in SufC-deficient E. coli, because of damaged oxygen-labile Fe-S clusters, caused by oxidative stress. AtNAP7 clearly plays an essential role in plants as AtNAP7-deficiency in Arabidopsis leads to embryo lethality (23Xu X.M. M øller S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9143-9148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), suggesting that Fe-S proteins play vital roles during early stages of embryogenesis. Evidence for a SufC·SufD complex in plastids has come from protein interaction studies where we have shown that AtNAP7 can interact with the SufD homolog AtNAP6 (23Xu X.M. M øller S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9143-9148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Because of the evolutionary conservation of the AtNAP7 mode of action and the fact that an AtNAP6·AtNAP7 complex exists we speculated that a SufB function may also be present in plastids.We previously reported that the plastid localized LAF6 (AtABC1) protein showed good homology to annotated non-intrinsic ABC proteins from cyanobacteria and alga (24M øller S.G. Kunkel T. Chua N.H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 90-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). As an extension of this analysis we show here that AtABC1 also exhibits high similarity to prokaryotic SufB proteins. Because of this and keeping in line with recent nomenclature of non-intrinsic ABC proteins (25Sanchez-Fernandez R. Davies T.G. Coleman J.O. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30231-30244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) we have redesignated AtABC1 as AtNAP1. We demonstrate that AtNAP1 interacts with AtNAP7 inside chloroplasts, suggesting the presence of an AtNAP1·AtNAP7·AtNAP6 (SufB·SufC·SufD) complex in Arabidopsis plastids. We further show that AtNAP1 is able to complement the susceptibility of an E. coli SufB mutant to oxidative stress, suggesting that AtNAP1 is indeed an evolutionary conserved plastidic SufB protein. Despite this remarkable functional conservation, detailed biochemical characterization showed that in contrast to prokaryotic SufB proteins (12Rangachari K. Davis C.T. Eccleston J.F. Hirst E.M. Saldanha J.W. Strath M. Wilson R.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) AtNAP1 is an iron-stimulated ATPase. Furthermore, AtNAP1 is capable of forming homodimers, again in contrast to its bacterial counterparts. We suggest that depending on the interaction state of AtNAP1, diverse biological processes can be affected explaining the varied phenotypes observed in mutants deficient for either AtNAP1 (23Xu X.M. M øller S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9143-9148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) or AtNAP7 (24M øller S.G. Kunkel T. Chua N.H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 90-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). From our findings we propose that AtNAP1 represents an atypical plastidic SufB protein in Arabidopsis involved in Fe-S cluster assembly and regulation of iron homeostasis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction for Protein Expression—All oligonucleotide primers used in this study are listed in Table I. A 1674-bp full-length AtNAP1 (At4g04770) cDNA was amplified by PCR using Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and primers NAP1/1 and NAP1/2 and ligated into pRSETA (Invitrogen) to generate pRSETA-AtNAP1. To generate a non-functional AtNAP1 protein pRSETA-AtNAP1 was digested with EcoRV removing a 393-bp DNA fragment (nucleotide position 297 to 689 of AtNAP1 removing amino acids 99–229) resulting in pRSETA-AtNAP1Trun (Truncated AtNAP1). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.Table ISequence of oligonucleotides used for strains and plasmid constructionsOligonucleotide5′-3′ SequenceNAP1/1AAGGATCCATGGCGTCT CTTCTCGCAAABamHI underlinedNAP1/2AACTCGAGTTAACCCACTGATCCTTCAAGCXhoI underlinedNAP1/4AAGAATTCATGGCGTCTCTTCTCGCAAAEcoRI underlinedNAP1/5AAGGATCCTTAACCCACTGATCCTTCAAGCBamHI underlined5NAP1GFPTACTCGAGATGGCGTCTCTTCTCGCAAACGGXhoI underlined3NAP1GFPATGGTACCACCCACTGATCCTTCAAGCKpn1 underlinedAtNAP1-FGCGATAACTTGGAAGTACCCAtNAP1-RGCTCTCTCGTGATCGATTCCNAP1-UC-LATTCTAGAGGCGTCTCTTCTCGCAAACGXbaI underlinedNAP1-UC-RATGGTACCTTAACCCACTGATCCTTCAAGCKpnI underlinedAtNAP7/1AAGAATTCATGGCCGGCGTTAACCTACEcoRI underlinedAtNAP7/2CTAACCGGATATCGCTTTGTAtSufC-LAATCTCGAGATGGCCGGCGTTAACCTACXhoI underlinedAtSufC-RAAGGTACCACCGGATATCGCTTTGAGCCKpnI underlinedYnhELTCTCGTAATACTGAAGCAACTGACGATGTCAAAACCTGGAGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTCYnhERCGCTGTGTTCAAGACTGATGGCGAGGAGTTTTTGTGCTTCCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG Open table in a new tab Protein Expression and Purification—pRSETA-AtNAP1 and pRSETA-AtNAP1Trun were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and 100-ml cultures were grown at 37 °C to a density of A600 = 0.6. Protein expression was induced using 1.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 3 h at 37 °C. To assess protein solubility 5 ml of each culture was harvested, resuspended in sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) followed by sonication. The pellet and supernatant were separated by centrifugation, denatured in SDS loading buffer by heating to 95 °C, and used for SDS-PAGE analysis. Both AtNAP1 and AtNAP1Trun were insoluble and therefore dissolved with 1% Sarkosyl in sodium phosphate buffer and purified using Talon metal affinity resin (BD Biosciences) under denaturing conditions following the user manual for Talon metal affinity resins. Proteins were eluted by sodium phosphate buffer (45 mm sodium phosphate, 270 mm NaCl, and pH 7.0) containing 150 mm imidazole and the purity was verified by SDS-PAGE. Purified proteins were refolded by extended dialysis in dialysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, pH 7.2).ATPase Assays—Each reaction mixture (40 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm KCl, and 10–80 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 10 Ci/mmol) unless otherwise stated. 0.4 μm Protein was used in each reaction and all reactions were terminated using 1 μl of 1 m formic acid. For the time course experiments, 40-μl reactions were incubated at 37 °C for the specified time, aliquots were removed and spotted onto PEI-cellulose (POLYGRAM CEL 300 PEI, MACHEREY-NAGEL) TLC plates. Air-dried plates were developed using 0.5 m lithium chloride and 1 m formic acid. Radioactive nucleotides were visualized by autoradiography using x-ray film and for quantification purposes plates were scanned using a phosphorimager.To assess the effect of different cations on the AtNAP1 ATPase activity, 20-μl reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 mm KCl was replaced with either 10 mm CaCl2, MnSO4, MnCl2, MgCl2 or 100 μm FeSO4. A no enzyme control was included to assess the background. To test the pH dependence of the ATPase activity, 20-μl reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min using 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 6.0–9.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm KCl, and 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP. For iron concentration experiments, 10 mm KCl was replaced by different concentrations of FeSO4, together with 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP in 20-μl reaction volumes. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C.Generation of an E. coli SufB Mutant and Complementation by AtNAP1—This method was adapted from Ref. 26Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10974) Google Scholar. The SufB gene in E. coli strain MG1655 was replaced by the insertion of a chloramphenicol resistance cassette (1.0-kb fragment containing the chloramphenicol resistant gene was PCR amplified with primers ynhEL and ynhER using pKD3 as template), followed by resistance cassette removal using pCP20 to give rise to MG1665ΔsufB. A full-length AtNAP1 cDNA was PCR amplified with primers NAP1-UC-L and NAP1-UC-R, digested with XbaI and KpnI, and ligated into pUC19. The following construct was transformed into MG1665ΔsufB to generate strain MG1665ΔsufBAtNAP1. Complementation analysis in the presence of phenazine methosulfate (PMS) was conducted as described previously (23Xu X.M. M øller S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9143-9148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—A full-length AtNAP1 cDNA was PCR amplified using Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche) and primers NAP1/4 and NAP1/5 and ligated into pGBKT7 (DNA binding domain; BD) and pGADT7 (DNA activation domain; AD) separately (Clontech, Matchmaker 3) to generate pGBK-AtNAP1 and pGAD-AtNAP1. A 1017-bp full-length AtNAP7 cDNA was PCR amplified as above using primers AtNAP7/1 and AtNAP7/2 and ligated into the EcoRI and SmaI of pGBKT7 and pGADT7 separately to generate pGBK-AtNAP7 and pGAD-AtNAP7. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.The above four vectors including empty vector controls (pGBKT7 and pGADT7) were transformed into yeast strain HF7c. The different transformation combinations are shown in Fig. 4A. Single transformants were grown on minimal synthetic dropout media (SD medium) either lacking tryptophan (Trp) (pGBKT7 vectors) or lacking leucine (Leu) (pGADT7 vectors). Double transformants were selected for SD medium lacking both Trp and Leu. To test for protein-protein interactions, fresh colonies were streaked onto SD medium plates containing 10 mm 3-aminotrizole but lacking Trp, Leu, and His and allowed to grow for 4–6 days at 30 °C. Yeast growth was classified into 4 categories based on restoration of His auxotrophy from three independent experiments: +++, growth after 2 days; ++, growth after 3 days; +, growth after 5–6 days; –, normal background growth.In Planta Interaction Studies/Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation—A full-length AtNAP1 cDNA was PCR amplified using Pwo polymerase (Roche) with primers 5NAP1GFP and 3NAP1GFP and inserted into pWEN-C-YFP (containing amino acids 155–238 of YFP) and pWEN-N-YFP (containing amino acids 1–154 of YFP). A full-length AtNAP7 cDNA was PCR amplified with primers AtSufC-L and AtSufC-R and inserted in pWEN-C-YFP. Two combinations of these plasmids, pWEN-AtNAP1-N-YFP/pWEN-AtNAP1-C-YFP or pWEN-AtNAP1-N-YFP/pWEN-AtNAP7-C-YFP, were co-bombarded and transiently expressed in tobacco leaves (27Kost B. Spielhofer P. Chua N.H. Plant J. 1998; 16: 393-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The leaves were placed in darkness for 2 days followed by YFP fluorescence visualization using a Nikon TE-2000U inverted microscope (Nikon, Japan) and image analysis was performed using Openlab software (Improvision).Expression Analysis of AtNAP1 in Iron-starved Seedlings—Wild-type (Ler) Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on Murashige and Skoog plates for 3 weeks followed by transfer to either fresh Murashige and Skoog plates or to Murashige and Skoog plates lacking FeSO4/EDTA but containing 50 μm ferrozine. Seedlings were harvested 3 days after transfer and total RNA was extracted using the Sigma RNA extraction kit (Sigma). The RNA was DNase I (Sigma) treated and 2 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μl of first-strand cDNA was used for PCR amplification (25 cycles) with primers AtNAP1-F and AtNAP1-R and products analyzed on a 2% agarose gel.RESULTSSequence Analysis of AtNAP1—We previously reported the cloning and initial characterization of AtABC1, a plastid-localized 557-amino acid protein showing high similarity to annotated ABC-like proteins from cyanobacteria and alga (24M øller S.G. Kunkel T. Chua N.H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 90-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In agreement with our initial classification, subsequent in silico studies by Rea and colleagues (25Sanchez-Fernandez R. Davies T.G. Coleman J.O. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30231-30244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) suggested that AtABC1 represents a soluble non-intrinsic ABC protein (NAP) belonging to a heterogeneous group of 15 single nucleotide binding fold proteins. In accordance with this new classification we now refer to AtABC1 as AtNAP1. Interestingly, more recent reports have suggested that AtNAP1 may represent a SufB homolog possibly involved in Fe-S cluster formation and/or repair (12Rangachari K. Davis C.T. Eccleston J.F. Hirst E.M. Saldanha J.W. Strath M. Wilson R.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Ellis K.E. Clough B. Saldanha J.W. Wilson R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In agreement with this we find that AtNAP1 shows ∼60% similarity to SufB from both E. coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi (Fig. 1) indicating that AtNAP1 may indeed be a plastid-localized SufB protein. In bacteria, SufB physically interacts with SufC, an ABC/ATPase, and together with SufD this protein complex acts as an ATP-driven energizer for Fe-S cluster biogenesis and repair (9Zheng L.

(Tokyo). 1999; 126: 917-926Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Although no ATPase activity has to date been demonstrated for prokaryotic SufB proteins, AtNAP1 contains degenerate Walker A and Walker B motifs (Fig. 1). Interestingly, both putative Walker domains are found in regions of limited homology between AtNAP1 and prokaryotic SufB proteins (Fig. 1) possibly indicating some functional divergence. Although AtNAP1 has been classified as a non-intrinsic ABC protein (25Sanchez-Fernandez R. Davies T.G. Coleman J.O. Rea P.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 2004; 343: 249-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) the absence of the conserved ABC signature motif suggests that AtNAP1 does not represent a classical ABC/ATPase but rather an ATPase with similarity to NAPs.Fig. 1Amino acid sequence alignment between AtNAP1 and SufB proteins from E. chrysanthemi (SufB Erw.

Although the predicted amino acid sequence of At5g44316 shows 85% similarity to AtNAP1 we were unable to identify an At5g44316 transcript from extensive RT-PCR experiments and no EST has to date been deposited in any data base. This suggests that Arabidopsis contains only one SufB protein.AtNAP1 Is an Fe2+-stimulated ATPase—Although AtNAP1 has been classified as a NAP with presumed ATPase activity we wanted to examine whether AtNAP1 could indeed bind and hydrolyze ATP. To this end we expressed a hexahistidine-tagged full-length AtNAP1 (WT) fusion protein in E. coli. Fractionation analysis showed that AtNAP1 was insoluble and the protein was therefore purified under denaturing conditions using Ni2+ affinity chromatography followed by refolding by dialysis. The purity of the refolded protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE revealing a single protein band of the expected size (61 kDa) with no detectable contamination (Fig. 2A). Purified AtNAP1 protein (0.4 μm) was then incubated with radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP at pH 7.4 and analyzed by thin layer chromatography for the release of radiolabeled inorganic phosphate (Pi). Analysis using two different protein batches showed clear AtNAP1-mediated ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Purified AtNAP1 and ATPase assays.A, SDS-PAGE of purified full-length wild-type AtNAP1 (WT) and truncated AtNAP1 (Trun) stained with Coomassie Blue.

To ensure that the ATPase activity was attributable to AtNAP1 and not because of a contaminating E. coli protein, we expressed a truncated hexahistidine-tagged AtNAP1 fusion protein (AtNAP1Trun) lacking 131 amino acids (see “Experimental Procedures”) predicted to be non-functional in terms of ATPase activity. Similar to the full-length wild-type AtNAP1, the purified and refolded AtNAP1Trun protein (Trun) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE revealing a single protein band of the predicted size (47 kDa) with no detectable contamination (Fig. 2A). As expected no ATPase activity was detected when 0.4 μm AtNAP1Trun (Trun) was incubated with radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 2B) demonstrating that AtNAP1Trun is non-functional in terms of ATPase activity but more importantly that the measured ATPase activity is attributable to AtNAP1.To more fully characterize the catalytic activity of AtNAP1 we determined key kinetic parameters of AtNAP1-mediated ATP hydrolysis. Using input [γ-32P]ATP concentrations in the range of 10 to 80 μm we quantified the release of radiolabeled Pi as a function of time in separate time course experiments (Supplementary Materials Fig. 1). From the measured initial reaction rates we generated a double-reciprocal plot and calculated a Km of 36 μm ATP and a Vmax of 0.3 pmol s–1 (Fig. 2C). Further kinetic analysis also showed that ATP hydrolysis was optimal at pH 7.5 (Fig. 3A) although hydrolysis under acidic conditions (pH 6–7) was significantly higher than in a more alkaline environment (pH 8–9).Fig. 3Kinetic and expression analysis of AtNAP1.A, effect of pH on ATP hydrolysis by AtNAP1.

https://openalex.org/W2010464906,"A complex mixture of fatty acid-derived aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols is released upon wounding of the moss Physcomitrella patens. To investigate the formation of these oxylipins at the molecular level we isolated a lipoxygenase from P. patens, which was identified in an EST library by sequence homology to lipoxygenases from plants. Sequence analysis of the cDNA showed that it exhibits a domain structure similar to that of type2 lipoxygenases from plants, harboring an N-terminal import signal for chloroplasts. The recombinant protein was identified as arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase and linoleate 13-lipoxygenase with a preference for arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid. In contrast to any other lipoxygenase cloned so far, this enzyme exhibited in addition an unusual high hydroperoxidase and also a fatty acid chain-cleaving lyase activity. Because of these unique features the pronounced formation of (2Z)-octen-1-ol, 1-octen-3-ol, the dienal (5Z,8Z,10E)-12-oxo-dodecatrienoic acid and 12-keto eicosatetraenoic acid was observed when arachidonic acid was administered as substrate. 12-Hydroperoxy eicosatetraenoic acid was found to be only a minor product. Moreover, the P. patens LOX has a relaxed substrate tolerance accepting C18-C22 fatty acids giving rise to even more LOX-derived products. In contrast to other lipoxygenases a highly diverse product spectrum is formed by a single enzyme accounting for most of the observed oxylipins produced by the moss. This single enzyme might, in a fast and effective way, be involved in the formation of signal and/or defense molecules thus contributing to the broad resistance of mosses against pathogens.

Metabolites originating from these pathways are collectively named oxylipins. In general LOX constitute a large gene family of non-heme iron-containing dioxygenases, which are ubiquitous in higher plants and animals (3Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23679-23682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). This group of enzymes catalyzes the regio- and stereospecific insertion of dioxygen into polyunsaturated fatty acids that harbor a (1Z,4Z)-pentadiene system resulting in a (2E,4Z)-hydroperoxy diene structural element (1Feussner I. Wasternack C. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 275-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). These hydroperoxides may be subsequently cleaved to shorter chain length oxygenated products by LOX themselves or by hydroperoxide lyases (HPL) (4Gardner H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 221-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 5Noordermeer M.A. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F. ChemBio-Chem. 2001; 2: 494-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cleavage products include volatile unsaturated aldehydes and alcohols and the corresponding unsaturated oxo fatty acids (1Feussner I. Wasternack C. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 275-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar, 5Noordermeer M.A. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F. ChemBio-Chem. 2001; 2: 494-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of their central importance in signal and defense processes, the biosynthesis of oxylipins is well investigated in higher plants and animals as well as in algae. Interestingly, different principles of transformations have been found in these genera. While higher plants use exclusively polyunsaturated C18 fatty acids for the production of oxylipins, animals and algae rely predominantly on the transformation of polyunsaturated C20 fatty acids (3Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23679-23682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar, 6Gerwick W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta-Lipids Lipid Metab. 1994; 1211: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which are not ubiquitously found in the plant kingdom (7Drexler H. Spiekermann P. Meyer A. Domergue F. Zank T. Sperling P. Abbadi A. Heinz E. J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 160: 779-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, the formation of volatile short chain aldehydes relies on the combined action of LOX and HPL species in higher plants, whereas animals and algae seem to be more flexible, because they may use either the LOX/HPL system or specific LOX forms alone (6Gerwick W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta-Lipids Lipid Metab. 1994; 1211: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8Glasgow W.C. Harris T.M. Brash A.R. J. Biol.

Numerous cDNAs corresponding to LOX have been isolated and characterized from higher plants and animals, but molecular data and mechanistic insight into LOX from other organisms are still scarce (10Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Shieh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20949-20957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Koljak R. Boutaud O. Shieh B.H. Samel N. Brash A.R.

A. 2004; 101: 2135-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It is known that mosses release volatile C8 and C9 alcohols and aldehydes with hitherto unknown biosynthesis and function (13Dembitsky V.M. Prog. Lipid. Res. 1993; 32: 281-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mosses are of special interest with respect to their LOX-derived chemistry because they diverged more than 400 million years ago from flowering plants, and it is discussed to which extent their metabolism has evolved independently (14Kenrick P. Crane P.R. Nature. 1997; 389: 33-39Crossref Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Recently, we described an investigation of LOX-derived products in the moss Physcomitrella patens, which is a widely used model organism in this context (15Nishiyama T. Fujita T. Shin T. Seki I.-M. Nishide H. Uchiyama I. Kamiya A. Carninci P. Hayashizaki Y. Shinozaki K. Kohara Y. Hasebe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8007-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We found that this moss releases the volatile oxylipins 1-octen-3-ol, 2-octen-1-ol, and (2E)-nonen-2-al upon tissue disruption (16Wichard T. Go ̈bel C. Feussner I. Pohnert G. Angew. Chem. 2005; 44: 158-161Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 1-Octen-3-ol is a well known aroma compound from mushrooms and the C-9 aldehyde accounts with cucumber-like odor to the volatile blend of certain plants. It is generally assumed that these metabolites derive from the LOX/HPL-mediated transformation of C18-polyunsaturated fatty acids. In mushrooms, linoleic acid serves as precursor for the biosynthesis of 1-octen-3-ol while α-linolenic acid provides for the higher unsaturated alcohols (2, 5)-octadien-1-ol and (1, 5)-octadien-3-ol (17Wurzenberger M. Grosch W. Lipids. 1986; 21: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In these cases the 10-hydroperoxy fatty acids are intermediates and 10-oxo-decenoic acid results as second fragment (18Wurzenberger M. Grosch W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 794: 18-24Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Wurzenberger M. Grosch W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 795: 163-165Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Matsui K. Sasahara S. Akakabe Y. Kajiwara T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2003; 67: 2280-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Higher plants exploit a 9-LOX/HPL mechanism for the formation of 3Z-nonenal, which is subsequently transformed to the 2E-isomer (5Noordermeer M.A. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F. ChemBio-Chem. 2001; 2: 494-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it should be stressed that the efficiency of HPL is low and represents the rate-limiting step in this process (5Noordermeer M.A. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F. ChemBio-Chem. 2001; 2: 494-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data on the involvement of conjugated unsaturated aldehydes in plant defense are scarce and they are still discussed controversially. Some protein preparations containing LOX activity from mammals and plants have been described that not only introduce dioxygen into the fatty acid, but moreover exhibit hydroperoxide cleaving activity releasing unsaturated aldehydes. An HPL-like activity has been attributed to a LOX purified from mammalian leukocytes, which results in the formation of (5Z,8Z,10E)-12-oxo-dodeca-5,8,10-trienoic acid, but this activity has not been assigned to a single enzyme as yet at the molecular level (8Glasgow W.C. Harris T.M. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 200-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that the moss does not follow any of the known pathways for the generation of the volatile oxylipins, but rather exploits C20-polyunsaturated fatty acids as precursors for C8- and C9-alkenals and alkenols. As second fragments (5Z,8Z,10E)-12-oxo-dodeca-5,8,10-trienoic acid and (5Z,8Z)-11-oxo-undeca-5,8-dienoic acid are generated (16Wichard T. Go ̈bel C. Feussner I. Pohnert G. Angew. Chem. 2005; 44: 158-161Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, the moss produces mixtures of typical plant, animal, and mushroom metabolites by hitherto unknown pathways from arachidonic acid, but meets metabolic themes from algae as well. The unusual biosynthesis of P. patens oxylipins prompted us to question the metabolic pathways behind the generation of the metabolites. Judging form the product spectrum, LOX/HPL pathways as well as the action of a LOX alone, had to be taken into account. In this study we report the identification, cloning, heterologous expression, and functional characterization of the first LOX from mosses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that it groups with plant LOX whereas the enzymatic activity and substrate preference resembles more that of animal LOX. Most interestingly, this LOX from P. patens exhibits an unusual high hydroperoxidase and lyase activity accounting for several of the moss oxylipins and might thus be regarded as the first of a series of related key enzymes involved in the production of reactive aldehydes and alcohols in mosses. Materials—The chemicals used were from the following sources: fatty acids and standards of chiral and racemic hydroxy fatty acids as well as keto fatty acids were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI), eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid were from Sigma, 2-octen-1-ol was obtained from Lancaster (Lancashire, England), methanol, hexane, 2-propyl alcohol (all HPLC grade) were from Baker; and restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Isolation of PpLOX1—An EST library from P. patens was provided by BASF Plant Science (21Zank T.K. Zahringer U. Beckmann C. Pohnert G. Boland W. Holtorf H. Reski R. Lerchl J. Heinz E. Plant J. 2002; 31: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and a partial EST clone with a putative LOX sequence was identified based on sequence homology to higher plant LOX. To obtain the 5′-terminus of the cDNA, a 5′-end RACE was performed using the gene-specific 3′ primer A (GAG CCC CTG TCT TCT CGG TAT TG) and the vector-specific 5′ primer T3. The PCR reaction was carried out with the Tfl polymerase (Biozym, Hessisch Oldendorf, Germany) under standard conditions. The obtained RACE fragment was sequenced. To clone the complete open reading frame, the RACE fragment was amplified from the cDNA-library using the gene-specific 5′ primer B (GGT ACC ATG ATG CTC AAC CGG TTG AC, KpnI site underlined) containing the Start-ATG and the gene-specific 3′ primer C (AAA TTC CGG AGC AAA CTC GT). The 3′-terminus of the cDNA was amplified from the EST clone using the vector-specific 3′ primer M13 reverse and 5′ primer D (CCC AAG CTT CTA TAT GGT GAT GCT GTT GGG CAC, HindIII site underlined). The obtained fragments were each cloned into pGEM-T (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). For expression in Escherichia coli, the complete open reading frame was assembled in pQE30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) from both fragments using a common SalI site. The 3′-terminus was cloned first into pQE30 as a SalI/HindIII fragment and joined with the 5′-terminus by cloning the latter as a KpnI/SalI fragment into this construct to yield pQE-PpLOX1 (the nucleotide sequence has been submitted to the Gen-Bank™ with accession number AJ583499), and the plasmid was transformed in E. coli strain SG13009. Control experiments were performed with the same strain transformed with pQE30 alone. Sequence Analysis—Phylogenetic tree analysis was performed on amino acid sequences of selected LOX and PpLOX1 using phylip 3.5 according to Ref. 1Feussner I. Wasternack C. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 275-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar. Prediction of the cleavage site of the chloroplastidic transit peptide was performed with ChloroP. Protein Expression and LOX Activity Assay—Expression of pQE-PpLOX1 was performed as described for plant LOX (22Feussner I. Bachmann A. Hohne M. Kindl H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For product analysis 0.8 ml cell lysate was incubated with the respective fatty acid in 1.2 ml of 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.1, for 30 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by adding 9 mm SnCl2 or 10% DMS in methanol (by volume) and incubation for 10 min to reduce hydroperoxy fatty acids to the corresponding hydroxides. The samples were acidified to pH 3, and the lipids were extracted according to Ref. 23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar. The obtained lipids were dissolved in 0.1 ml of methanol, and aliquots were submitted to HPLC analysis. Analysis of Hydroperoxy Fatty Acids—HPLC analysis was carried out after reduction with SnCl2 on an Agilent (Waldbronn, Germany) 1100 HPLC system equipped with a diode array detector. Oxygenated fatty acids were separated from unconverted fatty acids by RP-HPLC using a Nucleosil C18 column (250 × 4 mm, 5-μm particle size; Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) with a solvent system of methanol/water/acetic acid (85:15:0.1, by volume) at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1. Absorption at 234 nm (conjugated diene system of the hydroxy fatty acids) and 210 nm (polyenoic fatty acids) were recorded simultaneously. Straight phase HPLC was used to separate the hydroxy fatty acid isomers and carried out on a Zorbax RX-SIL column (150 × 2.1 mm, 5-μm particle size; Agilent) with a solvent system of n-hexane/2-propyl alcohol/acetic acid (100:1:0.1, by volume) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min–1. The enantiomeric composition of the hydroxy fatty acids was analyzed by chiral phase HPLC on a Chiralcel OD-H column (150 × 2.1 mm, 5-μm particle size; Daicel Chemical Industries, Illkirch, France) with a solvent system of n-hexane/2-propyl alcohol/acetic acid (100:2:0.1, by volume) at a flow rate of 0.1 ml min–1. Hydroxy fatty acids, for which standards are not commercially available, were verified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Accordingly, the hydroxy fatty acids were methylated in methanol with carbodiimide solution (24Leverentz M.K. Wagstaff C. Rogers H.J. Stead A.D. Chanasut U. Silkowski H. Thomas B. Weichert H. Feussner I. Griffiths G. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After extraction of the hydroxy fatty acid methyl esters with hexane, the samples were evaporated to dryness, dissolved in 3 μl of acetonitrile, and trimethylsilylated with 1 μl of N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). The analysis was carried out using an Agilent 5973 Network mass selective detector connected to an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a capillary DB-23 column (30 m × 0.25 mm; 0.25-μm coating thickness; J&W Scientific, Agilent). Helium was used as a carrier gas (1 ml min–1). The temperature was ramped from 60 to 110 °C at 25 °C min–1 (held for 1 min), then 110–270 °C at 10 °C min–1 (held for 10 min). Analysis of Lyase Products and Keto Acids—Product analysis of oxo and keto acids was performed by reversed-phase HPLC/MS (Hewlett-Packard Series II 1100 system equipped with a diode array UV detector coupled to a Thermo Finnigan LCQ (San Jose, CA) electrospray ionization (ESI) ion trap mass spectrometer). A nucleosil C18 column (ODS-3, 125 mm × 2 mm GromSil) was used for HPLC separation of the LOX/HPL-products with a binary gradient system of water/acetic acid (100:0.5, by volume) and acetonitrile/acetic acid (100:0.5, by volume) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min–1. Absorption at 237 nm (conjugated diene system of the hydroperoxy fatty acids) and at 279 nm (conjugated ketodienoic acids and α,β,γ,δ-unsaturated ω-oxo acids) were recorded simultaneously. Volatile products for GC/MS analysis were extracted either from 1 ml of lysate prepared as described above by solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) or with 0.5 ml of CHCl3. For SPME a polydimethylsiloxane-coated fiber (Supelco, Bellefonte, CA) was used as described (25Pohnert G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2000; 39: 4352-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Solvent extracts were dried over Na2SO4, concentrated, treated with 10 μl MSTFA, and incubated at 50 °C for 30 min. Analysis was performed on a Thermo Finnigan Trace GC/MS equipped with an Alltech (Deerfield, IL) EC5-MS column (15 m × 0.25 mm; 0.25-μm coating thickness). The temperature was ramped from 60 °C (2 min) to 100 °C at 5 °C min–1 and then to 300 °C at 25 °C min–1 (held for 2 min). For high resolution GC/MS, a three sector double focusing spectrometer MassSpec2 and a GC-TOF (Micromass, Manchester, England) were used. Time Course—The enzyme assay was performed in 5-ml glass vials and started by addition of 0.5 mm arachidonic acid (10 mg ml–1 in EtOH) to 2 ml lysate (pH 8.1). After defined time spans, the reaction was stopped by addition of 200-μl aliquots to equal volumes of methanol and freezing in liquid nitrogen. After thawing and centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by RP-HPLC-ESI/MS. For quantification, the area (UV) of the detected substances was determined and normalized with the extinction coefficients (12-ODTE, ϵ = 38,700 liters mol–1 cm–1 (α,β,γ,δ-unsaturated aldehyde); 12-KETE, ϵ = 30,000 liters mol–1 cm–1; 12-HPETE, ϵ = 27,000 liters mol–1 cm–1). The analysis of remaining arachidonic acid was performed by GC/MS after addition of [2H27]myristic acid (20 μg ml–1 in EtOH) as internal standard and esterification with acetyl chloride/MeOH (26Lepage G. Roy C.C. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1391-1396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 30 s, 2, 8, and 30 min after the start of the experiments, additional samples were taken to determine the enantiomeric composition of 12-HPETE as described above. Cloning and Expression of a LOX from P. patens—To gain insight into the nature of enzymes involved in unsaturated aldehyde and alcohol production in mosses, a sequenced EST library from P. patens (21Zank T.K. Zahringer U. Beckmann C. Pohnert G. Boland W. Holtorf H. Reski R. Lerchl J. Heinz E. Plant J. 2002; 31: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was analyzed. Data base searches and alignments of the EST clones revealed a cDNA of 1336 bp with significant similarity to plant LOX. The corresponding amino acid sequence of this cDNA exhibited highest identity to LOX1 from Pisum sativum (GenBank™ accession no. X07807, 44%). To isolate the full-length cDNA clone, RACE with specific primers was used for amplification of the missing 5′-end. The RACE fragment was fused to the 3′-terminus of the cDNA. The obtained complete open reading frame was named PpLOX1 (GenBank™ accession no. AJ583499) and had a length of 2814 bp encoding a protein of 937 amino acids with a molecular size of 105 kDa. The entire sequence showed highest identities to AtLOX3 from Arabidopsis thaliana (GenBank™ accession no. CAB56692, 43%) and POTLX-2 from Solanum tuberosum (Gen-Bank™ accession no. AAB67860, 43%). The protein sequence alignment with these two plant LOX is presented in Fig. 1. A low sequence similarity was found within the first 90 amino acids that are enriched in serine and threonine in the case of PpLOX1 and AtLOX3 representing the putative transit peptide region for chloroplast import, which is typical for type2-LOX (1Feussner I. Wasternack C. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 275-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Additional sequence analysis shows that the central histidine-rich region around His-597 and His-602 and the distal histidine (His-789), described for all plant LOX cDNAs sequenced so far, are conserved in the PpLOX1 amino acid sequence as well. As described for other enzymes from higher plants, an asparagine (Asn-793), an isoleucine (Ile-937) as well as the three histidine residues are involved in iron-ligand binding (27Prigge S. Boyington J. Faig M. Doctor K. Gaffney B. Lm A. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 79: 629-636Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Further, sequence-based analysis of the secondary structure revealed the typical organization of LOX with the catalytic domain at the C terminus and an N-terminal C2 domain (Fig. 2A). The C2 domain of PpLOX1 as well as of plant LOX is longer than the corresponding C2 domain of mammalian LOX.Fig. 2Analysis of the PpLOX1 sequence.

The next closely related enzymes are type1-9-LOX from plants whereas mammalian LOX that exhibit the same substrate- and regiospecificity as PpLOX1 (see below) are clearly separated (Fig. 2B). Lipoxygenase Activity—For further characterization PpLOX1 was expressed in E. coli. Functional analysis revealed that the enzyme had a broad substrate tolerance and metabolized administered free fatty acids with chain lengths ranging from 18 to 22 carbons. In control experiments with E. coli containing only the vector pQE30, no significant LOX activity was observed. The pH optimum of the PpLOX1 determined by summing up the integrals of all isomeric hydroperoxy fatty acids formed out of linoleic acid was between 8.0 and 8.2. This was also the pH range in which the highest regiospecificity was observed (83% 13-HPODE at pH 8.2; 65% 13-HPODE at pH 5.6). 13-HPODE, 13-α-HPOTE, 10-γ-HPOTE, 12-HPETE, 12-HPEPE, and 14-HPDHE were the preferred products after addition of linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid, γ-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and (to challenge substrate tolerance) docosahexaenoic acid, respectively (Table I). The S-enantiomers dominated in all of these major products. The C20 fatty acids arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid were the preferred substrates for PpLOX1. Compared with these C20 fatty acids C22-homologues were transformed with 68% efficiency, and the efficiency for C18 fatty acids was between 48% for γ-linolenic acid and 29% for α-linolenic acid, respectively. Transformation of eicosapentaenoic acid and arachidonic acid resulted in hydroperoxy fatty acid formation with highest regio- and stereoselectivity (Table I). Taken together these properties specify PpLOX1 as arachidonate 12S-LOX. In the case of γ-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid dioxygen was introduced preferably in position ω-9. Linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid, where this position is not able to be attacked by a LOX, were preferentially oxidized in position ω-6. PpLOX1 thus exhibits linoleate 13S-LOX activity as well. Generally, dioxygen introduction was favored at the [+2] position from a doubly allylic methylene with respect to the hydrogen abstraction site. Fatty acid methyl esters or fatty acids in glycerolipids were not substrates of PpLOX1.Table IHydroperoxides formed from the reaction of PpLOX1 with different fatty acids at pH 8.2SubstrateProductsArachidonic acid15-HETE12-HETE11-HETE8-HETE5-HETETotal hydroperoxides (%)4 ± 1.490 ± 24.31 ± 03 ± 1.41 ± 0S-Enantiomer (%)52 ± 497 ± 349 ± 243 ± 751 ± 28Eicosapentaenoic acid12-HEPE8-HEPETotal hydroperoxides (%)97 ± 16.63 ± 1.4S-Enantiomer (%)99 ± 048 ± 28Docosahexaenoic acid14-HDHE10-HDHETotal hydroperoxides (%)96 ± 34 ± 3S-Enantiomer (%)99 ± 1γ-Linolenic acid13-γHOTE10-γHOTE9-γHOTE6-γHOTETotal hydroperoxides (%)15 ± 1.476 ± 8.13 ± 07 ± 5.4% S-Enantiomer (%)78 ± 498 ± 139 ± 236 ± 7α-Linolenic acid16-HOTE13-HOTE12-HOTE9-HOTETotal hydroperoxides (%)6 ± 3.771 ± 9.86 ± 2.517 ± 3.7S-Enantiomer (%)91 ± 761 ± 25Linoleic acid13-HODE9-HODETotal hydroperoxides (%)83 ± 13.417 ± 12.2S-Enantiomer (%)94 ± 246 ± 4 Open table in a new tab Hydroperoxidase and Lyase Activity—In the presence of elevated substrate concentrations (≥0.4 mm), PpLOX1 exhibited pronounced hydroperoxidase and lyase activity. Shortly after the addition of arachidonic acid, 12-HPETE (Fig. 3, peak 1) dominates, but a rapid onset of the production of additional metabolites with UV maxima at 279 nm was observed (Fig. 3). The pseudo-molecular ions (ESI) of these products (Fig. 3, peaks 2 and 3) were m/z 317 (M-H+) and m/z 207 (M-H+), respectively. None of these metabolites were observed when arachidonic acid or (12S)-HPETE were administered to lysate from E. coli transformed with the empty vector pQE30 not containing the LOX cDNA. In order to confirm arachidonic acid as a precursor of these newly formed metabolites, labeled [2H8]arachidonic acid was administered, resulting in mass shifts of Δ+8 (Fig. 3, peak 1), Δ+8 (Fig. 3, peak 2), and Δ+6 (Fig. 3, peak 3) (Table II). Treatment with NaBH4 shifts the λmax of (Fig. 3, peak 2) and (Fig. 3, peak 3) from 279 to 237 nm.

https://openalex.org/W2051948074,"In Escherichia coli, the activity of ATP-bound DnaA protein in initiating chromosomal replication is negatively controlled in a replication-coordinated manner. The RIDA (regulatory inactivation of DnaA) system promotes DnaA-ATP hydrolysis to produce the inactivated form DnaA-ADP in a manner depending on the Hda protein and the DNA-loaded form of the β-sliding clamp, a subunit of the replicase holoenzyme. A highly functional form of Hda was purified and shown to form a homodimer in solution, and two Hda dimers were found to associate with a single clamp molecule. Purified mutant Hda proteins were used in a staged in vitro RIDA system followed by a pull-down assay to show that Hda-clamp binding is a prerequisite for DnaA-ATP hydrolysis and that binding is mediated by an Hda N-terminal motif. Arg168 in the AAA+ Box VII motif of Hda plays a role in stable homodimer formation and in DnaA-ATP hydrolysis, but not in clamp binding. Furthermore, the DnaA N-terminal domain is required for the functional interaction of DnaA with the Hda-clamp complex. Single cells contain ∼50 Hda dimers, consistent with the results of in vitro experiments. These findings and the features of AAA+ proteins, including DnaA, suggest the following model. DnaA-ATP is hydrolyzed at a binding interface between the AAA+ domains of DnaA and Hda; the DnaA N-terminal domain supports this interaction; and the interaction of DnaA-ATP with the Hda-clamp complex occurs in a catalytic mode.

The initiation of chromosomal replication is highly regulated so as to take place once and only once during the cell cycle. In Escherichia coli, this control is ensured by at least three pathways that target the replication origin oriC or the protein DnaA, which binds directly to oriC to initiate replication (1Boye E. L øbner-Olesen A. Skarstad K. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 2Katayama T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 3Messer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 355-374PubMed Google Scholar). First, newly replicated oriC is temporarily inactivated by the binding of the SeqA protein (4Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 5von Freiesleben U. Rasmussen K.V. Schaechter M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The palindromic sequence GATC, which is repeated 11 times within the minimal oriC region, is specifically modified by the Dam methyltransferase (6Zyskind J.W. Smith D.W. Cell. 1986; 46: 489-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Replication of the fully methylated form of oriC produces the hemimethylated form to which SeqA preferentially binds (7Slater S. Wold S. Lu M. Boye E. Skarstad K. Kleckner N.

Second, the number of DnaA molecules accessible to oriC is restricted by the datA locus, which binds this protein, and a single copy of the locus is speculated to absorb up to ∼300 DnaA molecules (9Kitagawa R. Mitsuki H. Okazaki T. Ogawa T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10Kitagawa R. Ozaki T. Moriya S. Ogawa T.

Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1367-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As the datA locus is located only 470 kb from oriC, its DnaA-titrating function is enhanced because it is replicated several minutes after initiation at oriC. The third mechanism, regulatory inactivation of DnaA (RIDA), 1The abbreviations used are: RIDA, regulatory inactivation of DnaA; pol, DNA polymerase; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; DAD III–IV, DnaA domains III and IV. converts the ATP-bound form of DnaA, which is active for initiation, to the inactive ADP-bound form (12Katayama T.

In this system, hydrolysis of DnaA-ATP is promoted when DnaA-ATP interacts with the Hda protein in the presence of the DNA-loaded β-sliding clamp, a subunit of the chromosomal replicase. The requirement for the DNA-loaded form of the clamp subunit ensures the timely inactivation of DnaA during the replication cycle. The DnaA-ATP level peaks around the time of replication initiation in vivo and decreases in a RIDA-dependent manner (13Kurokawa K. Nishida S. Emoto A. Sekimizu K. Katayama T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6642-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The DnaA R334A mutant, which binds ATP but is inactive for ATP hydrolysis, causes over-initiation of chromosomal replication, a phenotype also conferred by inactivation of the hda gene (16Kato J. Katayama T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4253-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 17Nishida S. Fujimitsu K. Sekimizu K. Ohmura T. Ueda T. Katayama T. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3244-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The minimal oriC region contains five 9-mer DnaA-binding sites, or DnaA boxes. DnaA-ATP molecules complexed with oriC open an AT-rich 13-mer region within this locus (3Messer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 355-374PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 521-533Google Scholar). DnaB helicase is then loaded onto the unwound DNA, and the single-stranded region is expanded, which allows the single-strand binding protein and DnaG primase (for primer synthesis) to be loaded. The clamp subunit of the DNA polymerase (pol) III holoenzyme, which consists of a β-subunit homodimer that forms a ring, is then loaded onto the primed sites and encircles the duplex strand with the assistance of the clamp-loader γ-complex, another pol III holoenzyme subassembly (20O'Donnell M. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R935-R946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Davey M.J. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. O'Donnell M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 826-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The DNA-loaded clamp ensures highly processive replication as it slides along duplex DNA and binds to the pol III core, a subassembly with nucleotide-polymerizing activity. After completion of Okazaki fragment synthesis, the pol III core is released from the clamp and binds to a newly loaded clamp at a primed site (22Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). pol III core-free clamps remain on replicated DNA and can interact with other proteins such as ligase, MutS, and pol I (23López de Saro F.J. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8376-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 24López de Saro F.J. Georgescu R.E. Goodman M.F. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that Hda forms a stable complex with the clamp (25Su'etsugu M. Takata M. Kubota T. Matsuda Y. Katayama T. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Hda is a 29-kDa protein consisting of a short N-terminal region and an AAA+ domain, which contains conserved motifs seen in other members of the AAA+ protein family (see Fig. 1) (16Kato J. Katayama T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4253-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 26Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AAA proteins are ATPases associated with various cellular activities, and AAA+ proteins compose an expanded group that includes these proteins (21Davey M.J. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. O'Donnell M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 826-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 26Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Iyer L.M. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). AAA+ family proteins contain unique motifs related to nucleotide binding and hydrolysis in addition to the Walker-type nucleotide-binding motifs. We found that at least 40 bp of DNA flanking the clamp is required for RIDA and proposed that the association of DnaA with this DNA supports a functional interaction between DnaA and the Hda-clamp complex (25Su'etsugu M. Takata M. Kubota T. Matsuda Y. Katayama T. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyze the structural and functional relationships between Hda and DnaA to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying protein-protein interactions relevant to RIDA. First, we purified a highly active form of Hda. We previously studied an Hda derivative conjugated with three tags (Hda*, bearing an N-terminal maltose-binding protein and C-terminal Myc and hexahistidine peptides) because of the difficulty of overexpressing and purifying the native form of Hda (16Kato J. Katayama T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4253-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The specific activity of Hda* was proposed to be significantly reduced compared with that of native Hda (16Kato J. Katayama T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4253-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We recently improved the preparation protocol and obtained Hda tagged only with N-terminal hexahistidine (His-Hda). His-Hda is more functional in vitro than Hda*, and we speculate that its activity is comparable with that of native Hda. Second, using reconstituted in vitro RIDA systems and mutant His-Hda derivatives, we reveal that the N-terminal region of Hda is required both for DnaA-ATP hydrolysis during RIDA and for directing clamp binding. Third, we show that Hda Arg168 is required for DnaA-ATP hydrolysis. This residue is located in the AAA+ Box VII motif, which is a putative arginine finger proposed to be directly involved in ATP hydrolysis (26Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Fourth, we demonstrate that Hda forms a homodimer in solution and that two Hda dimers form a stable complex with a single clamp. Fifth, by immunoblot analysis, we determined the cellular Hda content. Also finally, we found that the DnaA N-terminal domain is required for RIDA. DnaA is subdivided into four domains (Fig. 1): N-terminal domains I and II (amino acids 1–134) specify DnaA-DnaA and DnaA-DnaB interactions; domain III (amino acids 135–373) contains the AAA+ motifs; and C-terminal domain IV (amino acids 374–467) contains a helix-turn-helix module with DNA-binding activity (3Messer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 355-374PubMed Google Scholar, 30Messer W. Blaesing F. Majka J. Nardmann J. Schaper S. Schmidt A. Seitz H. Speck C. Tungler D. Wegrzyn G. Weigel C. Welzeck M.

Based on these findings, we propose a model that describes a functional mechanism for the hydrolysis of DnaA-ATP that is promoted by its interaction with the DNA-loaded Hda-clamp complex. Overexpression and Purification of the His-Hda Protein—The hda fragment was prepared by PCR using a pACYC184 derivative bearing wild-type hda (a gift from Dr. Jun-ichi Kato) (16Kato J. Katayama T.

Incubation was continued for 1 h, and cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in chilled buffer A (50 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 10 mm imidazole, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Purification of His-Hda was as described previously (25Su'etsugu M. Takata M. Kubota T. Matsuda Y. Katayama T. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen cells were thawed at 4–6 °C, incubated on ice for 30 min in the presence of 0.3 mg/ml lysozyme, and frozen again in liquid nitrogen. The following procedures were all performed at 4–6 °C. The frozen cell pastes were thawed; supernatant fractions were collected by centrifugation; and proteins in the fractions were loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose column (QIAGEN Inc.) pre-equilibrated with buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole and 5 column volumes of buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole. His-Hda was then eluted with buffer A containing 300 mm imidazole. The purity of the His-Hda thus obtained was >90% as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Construction and Purification of His-HdaΔN and Mutant Hda Proteins—His-HdaΔN contains amino acids 27–248 of Hda (248 residues). A His-HdaΔN-overproducing plasmid (pBAD/His-HdaΔN) was constructed by XhoI digestion and self-ligation of a PCR fragment amplified using pBAD/His-Hda as a template and primers 5′-CCACTCTCGAGCTCGGATCC-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGTATCTTCCTGACGACGAAACCTTTGC-3′. Base substitutions were introduced into the hda gene using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and pBAD/His-Hda. The mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Mutant Hda proteins were overexpressed and purified by the same methods as described for His-Hda. The purity of all proteins was >90% as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Purification of Native Hda Protein as a Molecular Size Marker—The hda fragment was prepared by PCR using a pACYC184 derivative bearing wild-type hda as a template and primers 5′-CCAAGCTTCCGCATCCGACAATAAACACC-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGAGTGGTAAACTTCTCGCG-3′ and ligated to XhoI-HindIII-digested pBAD18 (32Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3960) Google Scholar). To enhance Hda expression, the XbaI-EcoNI region containing the original Shine-Dalgarno sequence was replaced with a chemically synthesized fragment, 5′-CTAGAAGGAGATATACATATGGTAAACTTCTCGCGATTTTGTGAAATCCTGG-3′, which contains the T7 phage gp10 Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The resulting plasmid was termed pBAD/Hda. Protein overexpression and cell lysate preparation were performed following the same methods as described for His-Hda. Precipitates were obtained by centrifugation of the cell lysates and resuspended in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing 2% Triton X-100. This procedure was repeated three times. The resulting protein pellets were dissolved in buffer B containing 8 m urea and 50 mm NaCl and applied to a HiTrap Q column (bed volume of 1 ml; Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 10 ml of the same buffer. Native Hda protein was then eluted with a linear gradient of 50–300 mm NaCl in buffer B containing 8 m urea, and the peak fractions were collected. The purity of native Hda obtained was >90% as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad) using, as a standard, bovine serum albumin dissolved in buffer B containing 8 m urea and 50 mm NaCl. Reconstitution of a RIDA System Coupled with Clamp Loading—The RIDA reaction was performed essentially as described previously (12Katayama T. Kubota T. Kurokawa K. Crooke E. Sekimizu K.

Briefly, [α-32P]ATP-bound DnaA (1 pmol) was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in buffer (25 μl) containing 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6 at 1 m), 2 mm ATP, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 7% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol (Mr 30,000–70,000), 40 mm phosphocreatine, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase, 100 ng of β-clamp, 65 ng of pol III*, 200 ng of M13E10 replicative form I (an oriC plasmid), and the indicated amounts of His-Hda or IdaB fraction V. pol III* is a subassembly of the pol III holoenzyme that contains the clamp-loader γ-complex and the core complex. The nucleotide-bound forms of DnaA were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin-layer chromatography as described (12Katayama T. Kubota T. Kurokawa K. Crooke E. Sekimizu K. Cell. 1998; 94: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Reconstituted Staged RIDA Reaction System—Typically, in the first stage, the clamp (50 pmol as dimer) and ϕX174 replicative form II (0.5 pmol as circle) were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in 25 μl of buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 58, 8 mm magnesium acetate, and 20 mm potassium glutamate) containing 1 mm ATP and 132 fmol of the γ-complex, and the resulting DNA-loaded clamps were isolated in the void fraction using a Sephacryl S-400 HR spin column (0.63 ml; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer C (25Su'etsugu M. Takata M. Kubota T. Matsuda Y. Katayama T. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the second stage, the isolated DNA-loaded clamps (the indicated amounts or 50 fmol of β-subunit dimers loaded onto 0.47 fmol of ϕX174 circular DNA) were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in buffer C (25 μl) containing 120 mm potassium glutamate, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 pmol of [α-32P]ATP-bound DnaA, and His-Hda (the indicated amounts or 0.62 pmol as dimer) (25Su'etsugu M. Takata M. Kubota T. Matsuda Y. Katayama T. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Nucleotides bound to DnaA protein were recovered on a nitrocellulose filter and analyzed by polyethyleneimine thin-layer chromatography using a Fuji Bioimage BAS2500 analyzer as described previously (12Katayama T.

Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration Analysis—Gel filtration analyses were performed at 4 or 16 °C using a SMART column (bed volume of 2.4 ml) of Superose 12 or Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The indicated proteins were loaded and eluted at a flow rate of 40 μl/min for Superose 12 or 5 μl/min for Superdex 200. Proteins in collected fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15 or 12%) and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. For analyses of the Hda-β-clamp complex, His-Hda (154 pmol as dimer) and the β-clamp (38 fmol as dimer) were incubated at 16 °C for 20 min in buffer A (10.5 μl) before gel filtration. The marker proteins used were apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), γ-globulin (160 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). Chemical Cross-linking Analysis—His-Hda protein (0.5 μg) was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h in buffer D (25 μl) containing 2 mm dimethyl suberimidate (Pierce) and analyzed by SDS-15% PAGE and silver staining or immunoblotting. Quantitative Immunoblot Analysis of the Intracellular Hda Content—C600 or MG1655 cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium and harvested at A600 = 0.5. Cells were immediately suspended in chilled 10% trichloroacetic acid and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described previously (33Katayama T. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

An anti-Hda antibody was purified from rabbit anti-Hda* antiserum by affinity column chromatography using His-Hda-coupled CNBr-Sepharose 4 (Amersham Biosciences) prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ni-NTA Pull-down Assay—His-Hda (5 pmol as dimer) was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in 25 μl of buffer E (5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 0.01% Brij 58, 8 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 8 mm magnesium acetate) containing the indicated amounts of the clamp. Reactions were further incubated on ice for 1 h and inverted at 3-min intervals in the presence of Ni-NTA magnetic agarose beads (25 μl of a 2% suspension; QIAGEN Inc.) equilibrated with buffer E containing 20 mm imidazole. The beads and bound materials were collected by magnetic force and resuspended in buffer E (50 μl) containing 50 mm imidazole. This procedure was repeated three times. Proteins were eluted from the beads in buffer E containing 150 mm imidazole and analyzed by SDS-12% PAGE and silver staining. Construction and Purification of a Protein Consisting of DnaA Domains III and IV (DAD III–IV)—DAD III–IV consists of amino acids 130–467 of DnaA. A DAD III–IV-coding fragment was prepared by PCR using pKA234 (35Kubota T. Katayama T. Ito Y. Mizushima T. Sekimizu K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) as a template and primers 5′-CCGGCTAGCTCTAACGTAAACGTCAAACAC-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCTTACGATGACAATGTTCTGATT-3′ and ligated to NheI-EcoRI-digested pBAD/His-B. The protein was overexpressed and purified by the same method for DnaA protein as described previously (17Nishida S. Fujimitsu K. Sekimizu K. Ohmura T. Ueda T. Katayama T. J. Biol.

The purity of DAD-III–IV was >90% as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The nucleotide binding assay and DNA-dependent intrinsic ATPase assay were performed as described previously (17Nishida S. Fujimitsu K. Sekimizu K. Ohmura T. Ueda T. Katayama T. J. Biol.

Purification of Hda and Homodimer Formation—To analyze Hda protein function quantitatively, we constructed an N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged Hda protein (His-Hda). As even slight overexpression of Hda is toxic to wild-type cells, the protein was overexpressed in a host strain bearing dnaA ΔoriC mutations and a vector bearing the arabinose-inducible promoter, which we used for over-initiating DnaA mutants (17Nishida S. Fujimitsu K. Sekimizu K. Ohmura T. Ueda T. Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14986-14995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Affinity purification on a Ni-NTA column yielded highly purified His-Hda (Fig. 2A). In a reconstituted RIDA system (12Katayama T. Kubota T. Kurokawa K. Crooke E. Sekimizu K. Cell. 1998; 94: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 15Su'etsugu M. Kawakami H. Kurokawa K. Kubota T. Takata M. Katayama T. Mol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 14986-14995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), purified His-Hda efficiently promoted DnaA-ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 2B). We assessed His-Hda activity by comparing it with that of native Hda in a partially purified fraction prepared from a wild-type hda strain. This fraction, previously designated as IdaB fraction V, complements Hda activity in a RIDA reaction using DNA-loaded clamps (12Katayama T. Kubota T. Kurokawa K. Crooke E. Sekimizu K. Cell. 1998; 94: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 16Kato J. Katayama T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4253-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The Hda present in this fraction was quantified by immunoblotting, and its specific activity for DnaA-ATP hydrolysis was assessed. The results indicate that the activity of purified His-Hda was comparable with or even higher than that of native Hda in IdaB fraction V (Fig. 2, B and C). When IdaB fraction V was added to a reaction containing His-Hda, no significant inhibition was seen (data not shown). During the course of these experiments, we noticed that Hda activity was considerably reduced by the freeze-thawing procedure in the absence of Triton X-100. The buffer for His-Hda, but not for IdaB fraction V, contained this detergent. The specific activity of His-Hda was ∼15-fold higher than that of Hda* in a reconstituted RIDA system as described above, which is consistent with a previous speculation (16Kato J. Katayama T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4253-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Intrinsic ATPase activity was not detected for His-Hda. We next asked whether His-Hda forms an oligomeric structure, as some AAA+ proteins are known to form homomultimers (21Davey M.J. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. O'Donnell M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 826-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 26Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Gel filtration analysis showed that His-Hda eluted at a position consistent with a size range of ∼50–70 kDa (Fig. 2D), suggesting that it forms a homodimer in its native state since the mass of the His-Hda monomer is calculated to be 32 kDa. A similar elution pattern was seen when His-Hda was incubated and subjected to gel filtration in the presence of 2 mm MgATP. Further analysis using a cross-linking agent showed the formation of a 65-kDa product, confirming that Hda forms a homodimer (Fig. 2E). Cellular Concentration of the Hda Dimer—We determined cellular Hda levels in exponentially growing C600 or MG1655 cells by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3 and Table I).

https://openalex.org/W2154870995,"Four ErbB receptors and multiple growth factors sharing an epidermal growth factor (EGF) motif underlie transmembrane signaling by the ErbB family in development and cancer. Unlike other ErbB proteins, ErbB-2 binds no known EGF-like ligand. To address the existence of a direct ligand for ErbB-2, we applied algorithms based on genomic and cDNA structures to search sequence data bases. These searches reidentified all known EGF-like growth factors including Epigen (EPG), the least characterized ligand, but failed to identify novel factors. The precursor of EPG is a widely expressed transmembrane glycoprotein that undergoes cleavage at two sites to release a soluble EGF-like domain. A recombinant EPG cannot stimulate cells singly expressing ErbB-2, but it acts as a mitogen for cells expressing ErbB-1 and co-expressing ErbB-2 in combination with the other ErbBs. Interestingly, soluble EPG is more mitogenic than EGF, although its binding affinity is 100-fold lower. Our results attribute the anomalous mitogenic power of EPG to evasion of receptor-mediated depletion of ligand molecules, as well as to inefficient receptor ubiquitylation and down-regulation. In conclusion, EPG might represent the last EGF-like growth factor and define a category of low affinity ligands, whose bioactivity differs from the more extensively studied high affinity ligands.

In conclusion, EPG might represent the last EGF-like growth factor and define a category of low affinity ligands, whose bioactivity differs from the more extensively studied high affinity ligands. Growth factors play important roles in developmental cell lineage determination and in tissue remodeling throughout adulthood. One of the most extensively studied families of growth factors comprises polypeptides sharing an epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; EPG, Epigen; EPR, Epiregulin; IL-3, interleukin-3; NRG, Neuregulin; TGFα, transforming growth factor α; HB, heparin-binding; HA, hemagglutinin; EndoH, endoglycosidase H; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; PNGaseF, peptide N-glycosidase F; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. motif (reviewed in Ref. 1Stein R.A. Staros J.V. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This highly conserved motif, which includes six canonical cysteines, binds to a family of four cell surface receptors, called ErbB (or HER) proteins. The extracellular domain of each ErbB protein displays binding specificity to several EGF-like ligands, which activate the intracellular tyrosine kinase. Notably, ErbB-3 binds several types of neuregulins, but its tyrosine kinase domain is catalytically inactive (2Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway III, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Conversely, ErbB-2 binds with no known ligand directly but is transactivated through heterodimerization with other ErbBs (3Klapper L.N. Glathe S. Vaisman N. Hynes N.E. Andrews G.C. Sela M. Yarden Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4995-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ErbB-2 is widely expressed in a dynamic and heterogeneous manner. An example is provided by human tumors of mammary and ovarian origins; because of gene amplification, ErbB-2 is overexpressed in a subset of relatively aggressive tumors (4Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G. Keith D.E. Levin W.J. Stuart S.G. Udove J. Ullrich A. Press M.F. Science. 1989; 244: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). The apparent absence of a bone fide ligand for ErbB-2 is also relevant to another route of ErbB-mediated oncogenesis, namely increased production of a growth factor where autocrine ligand secretion drives proliferation of various cancers (reviewed in Ref. 5Salomon D.S. Brandt R. Ciardiello F. Normanno N. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 19: 183-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar). Because ErbB-2 is a widely expressed oncoprotein and antibodies directed at this surface antigen can prolong survival of breast cancer patients (6Baselga J. Tripathy D. Mendelsohn J. Baughman S. Benz C.C. Dantis L. Sklarin N.T. Seidman A.D. Hudis C.A. Moore J. Rosen P.P. Twaddell T. Henderson I.C. Norton L. J. Clin. Oncol. 1996; 14: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar), it is crucial to examine the contention that ErbB-2 functions as a ligand-less co-receptor, which enhances and prolongs signaling by autocrine or stroma-derived EGF-like ligands (reviewed in Ref. 7Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5633) Google Scholar). The ErbB family presents another open question that relates to the multiplicity of EGF-like ligands sharing specificity to the same receptor (reviewed by Ref. 8Riese II, D.J. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Thus, along with EGF and the transforming growth factor α (TGFα), ErbB-1 binds the heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), Betacellulin, Amphiregulin (AR), Epiregulin, and Epigen (9Strachan L. Murison J.G. Prestidge R.L. Sleeman M.A. Watson J.D. Kumble K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18265-18271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Likewise, several ligands that bind ErbB-4 also bind ErbB-1, with the exception of NRG-3 and NRG-4, which bind ErbB-4 exclusively. Genetic manipulation of EGF-like ligands in mammals assigned partially overlapping but distinct functions to individual growth factors, in processes as diverse as mammary, cardiac and intestinal development, and wound healing (see for example Ref. 10Troyer K.L. Luetteke N.C. Saxon M.L. Qiu T.H. Xian C.J. Lee D.C. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 68-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These and other lines of evidence imply that ligand multiplicity reflects functional features unique to each EGF-like growth factor. The present study addressed the multiplicity of EGF-like molecules and the possibility that mammalian genomes encode a yet uncharacterized ligand for ErbB-2. By designing a genome-wide screen that can identify ErbB ligands on the basis of their intron-exon organization, we reidentified all known ligands of ErbB proteins but found no novel molecule that can potentially qualify as an ErbB-2 ligand. Concentrating on the least characterized member of the EGF family, namely Epigen (EPG), we highlight several biochemical and physiological attributes that distinguish low affinity ligands from the extensively characterized high affinity family members. Bioinformatics and Phylogenetics—The approximate exon-intron boundary for each EGF-like gene was determined (using tblastn) by comparison of the protein sequence for each gene with the corresponding genomic locus. For the purpose of the data base searches performed herein, the EGF domain was defined as that encoding the six invariant cysteine residues of the domain and the additional five flanking amino acids both N- and C-terminally to cysteine 1 and cysteine 6, respectively. Two separate multiple alignments were generated for sequences encoding Exon-1 and Exon-2, which were then compiled into two independent profiles (Profilemake; GCG10). The profiles were used as criteria for a stepwise Smith-Waterman-based search of human genomic data (Biocellerator device, Compugen, Israel; HTGS and NR data bases). The first 2000 hits from the Exon-1 profile search were saved and recompiled into a new, miniature data base using PERL script. These 2000 sequences were then scanned, this time using the Exon-2 profile, to identify EGF-like ligands. The human Epigen-Epiregulin genomic locus was extracted from a data base provided by Celera Genomics. Their localization to chromosome 4q21.21 was assigned with the aid of NCBI MapView (version 34). Phylogenetic data were generated with the aid of ClustalX (version 1.81; default settings) and visualized with a modification of an output generated from TREEVIEW (11Page R.D.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of Pro-Epigen in Mammalian Cells—The coding sequence of pro-EPG was amplified using PCR from an IMAGE clone (Gen-Bank™; BU540655) and cloned into pIRES-puro vector (12Hobbs S. Jitrapakdee S. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), with or without a C-terminal HA tag. The plasmid was transfected into CHO cells, and stable clones were selected with 10 μg/ml puromycin. Immunoprecipitates of anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) and anti-EPG antibodies were equilibrated with 50 mm citrate (pH 5.5) or saline for deglycosylation using endoglycosidase H (EndoH) or peptide N-glycosidase F, respectively. Deglycosylation was performed at 37 °C for 2 h. The proteins were separated on a 16.5% Tricine gel and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). To biotinylate cell surface proteins, the cell monolayers were washed with saline and incubated with biotin-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (Pierce) for 1 h on ice. Excess biotin was quenched using 100 mm glycine in saline, and the cells were washed extensively and incubated at 37 °C. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Growth Factors—The EGF-like domain, including five residues N-terminal to cysteine 1 and five and eight residues C-terminal to cysteine 6 of human NRG-β1 and human EPG, respectively, was cloned into the pET32b vector and expressed as C-terminal thioredoxin fusion proteins with the Factor Xa cleavage site adjacent to the N-terminal residue of the EGF-like domain. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21) using standard procedures. Expressed proteins were first purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, cleaved using Factor-Xa (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and then purified on a Superdex-30 (Amersham Biosciences) column. Generation and Affinity Purification of an Anti-EPG Antibody—New Zealand rabbits were immunized with a purified EGF-like domain of EPG (0.1 mg). For affinity purification, a recombinant EPG fusion protein was immobilized on cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The serum was diluted 10-fold using column buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl) and passed through the column. The column was then washed extensively, and bound proteins were eluted using 100 mm glycine-HCl (pH 2.5). Cell Proliferation and Stimulation Assays—A previously described method (13Mosman T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46504) Google Scholar) has been used with the following modifications: 5 × 104 32D cells were plated in triplicate in a 96-well plate and treated with different concentrations of ligand or with a fixed ligand concentration (100 ng/ml) for different time intervals. In experiments with extended periods of treatment, the cells were plated at a density of 1000 cells/well of a 96-well plate. The cells were harvested at each time point and incubated with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (0.1 mg/ml) for 2 h. Thereafter, the cells were extracted with acidified 2-propanol, and the optical density was measured at 570 nm with a reference 650 nm filter. For receptor stimulation, 32D cells were washed extensively in medium devoid of interleukin-3 (IL-3) and divided equally. The cells were then stimulated with various ligands for different periods of time, collected by centrifugation, and lysed in lysis buffer, and equal amounts of lysate were separated using gel electrophoresis. Separated proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with specific antibodies. Ligand Binding Assays—Ligands were radiolabeled using Iodogen (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells grown in 48-well plates were washed with ice-cold binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.1% albumin) and incubated on ice for 3 h with different ligand concentrations in duplicates. Thereafter, media were aspirated, cells were washed and extracted in 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate and 0.1 n NaOH, and cell-associated radioactivity was determined. Ligand Degradation Assay—Cos-7 cells were equally plated in a 48-well plate, and the experiment was performed in duplicates. Non-specific binding was determined with 100-fold excess unlabeled EGF. The cells were washed, equilibrated with binding buffer at 37 °C, and incubated with radiolabeled ligands at 37 °C. After incubation, the medium was collected, and intact ligand in the medium was precipitated using trichloroacetic acid. The cells were washed once with warm binding buffer, and this was added to the medium fraction. The cells were then transferred to ice and incubated with cold acid wash buffer (50 mm glycine-HCl, pH 3.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone). The wash buffer was collected, and radioactivity associated with this sample was considered as the surface-bound ligand. Lysates of the cells were also prepared. The sum of radioactivity obtained in the acid-precipitable and acid wash fractions was considered as intact extracellular ligand. Sensitivity of Ligand Binding to pH—A431 cells were plated equally in 48-well plates, and the experiment was performed in duplicates. After 24 h, the cells were moved to ice and equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffers at different pH levels (7.5-6.0) containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.1% albumin. The equilibrated cells were then incubated for 2 h on ice with ligand-containing solutions buffered at various pH levels. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed twice with buffers at the respective pH level. The cells were lysed, and associated radioactivity was measured using a γ-counter. Receptor Ubiquitylation Assay—Cos-7 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours later, the cells were stimulated with EGF or EPG for 10 min. ErbB-1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, or the lysate was directly resolved by electrophoresis. Separated proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with antibodies to HA (Roche Applied Science), ErbB-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or c-Cbl (Santa Cruz). Receptor Down-regulation Assay—Cos-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding ErbB-1, along with a c-Cbl plasmid as indicated. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were divided into 6-well plates, and after another 24 h the cells were stimulated with various ligands at 37 °C. At the end of each time interval, the plates were placed on ice, surface-bound ligand was stripped using acid wash buffer (150 mm acetic acid and 150 mm NaCl), and the cells were incubated for 2 h with 125I-EGF (5 ng/ml) in binding buffer. Following incubation, the cells were washed using binding buffer, and cell-associated radioactivity was determined. Immunohistochemistry Using Anti-EPG Antibodies—Murine tissues were isolated, frozen in powdered dry ice, and embedded in paraffin. Staining was performed on 10-μm thick paraffin sections after an antigen retrieval procedure using 10 mm citric acid (pH 6.0). Tissue sections were first blocked using normal serum and then incubated with the anti-EPG antibody (0.5 μg/ml) or anti-TGFα (BioTope). Visualization was achieved using the Vectastain ABC system (Vectorlabs, Burlingham, CA) or donkey anti-rabbit and anti-rat fluorescent antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Human tissue sections were stained with the anti-EPG antibody using a similar protocol. PCR Analysis of EPG Expression—Prostate cancer xenografts were grown in castrated (androgen-independent) and noncastrated (androgen-dependent) nude mice, as described (14Pinthus J.H. Waks T. Schindler D.G. Harmelin A. Said J.W. Belldegrun A. Ramon J. Eshhar Z. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6563-6567PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from 0.1 mg of each tissue using TRIzol (Sigma). Primers for PCR were selected within the coding region of EPG using the web interface of the Primer 3 software (MIT.EDU). The reverse transcriptase reaction with a sample of total RNA was performed using Superscript (Invitrogen), and PCRs were performed using BioTaq (Bioline, London, UK) for 30 cycles. A second round of PCR was performed to increase the amount of product, and the samples were divided into two. One part was left untreated, and the other was digested with NdeI. Cell Differentiation and Aortic Ring Assays—Differentiation of mammary cells has been described before (15Bacus S.S. Gudkov A.V. Zelnick C.R. Chin D. Stern R. Stancovski I. Peles E. Ben Baruch N.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were plated in 24-well, collagen-coated plates and treated with the indicated ligands (100 ng/ml) for 7 days. Normal human prostate epithelial cells, RWPE-1, were plated on growth factor-depleted Matrigel at a density of 1000 cells/well in a 96-well plate. The cells were incubated with KSFM medium (Invitrogen) (17Bello D. Webber M.M. Kleinman H.K. Wartinger D.D. Rhim J.S. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) containing growth factors at 100 ng/ml for 5 days, and the medium was replenished after 3 days. Aortas from 6-10-week-old mice were isolated, cleaned of surrounding tissue, and washed with saline. Each aorta was cut into 1-mm-thick rings and embedded in collagen (isolated from rat tail). The rings were then incubated in medium, either with or without growth factors (at 100 ng/ml). The medium was changed every 3 days, and the rings were monitored for up to 14 days. To visualize microvessels, the rings were fixed overnight using 4% formaldehyde in saline, stained for 4 h with a solution containing 0.02% crystal violet in 50% ethanol, and subsequently destained. A Genome-wide Screen Reidentified All Known EGF-like Molecules, Including the Most Recent Addition, Epigen—Previously we have reported the discovery of NRG-4 using a bioinformatics approach (18Harari D. Tzahar E. Romano J. Shelly M. Pierce J.H. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2681-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), where the search criteria were based on the six conserved cysteine residues of the EGF-like domain. Repeated searches of the expanded expressed sequence tag data base detected no novel ligands, which led us to examine alternative strategies. Analyses of the genomic structure of the known ErbB ligands revealed that the EGF-like domain of all the mammalian ligands are encoded by two exons (defined here as Exon-1 and Exon-2), where Exon-1 encodes four of the N-terminal cysteine residues, and Exon-2 encodes cysteines 5 and 6 (Fig. 1A). NRG1 and NRG2 genes harbor a supplementary Exon-2, and through alternative splicing, Exon-1 is fused to either the first or the second Exon-2, thereby generating the α or β isoforms. Interestingly, the EGF-like domain of Lin-3, the single EGF-like growth factor in Caenorhabditis elegans, is encoded by three exons, but the five corresponding genes of Drosophila display three different genomic patterns in the EGF-like domains, including one (vein) that resembles the mammalian pattern (Fig. 1A). The conserved genomic organization of the different mammalian ErbB ligands provided a means in which a stepwise Smith-Waterman-based search could be employed to screen for new EGF-like ligands from genomic data. Unlike gapped BLAST searches, Smith-Waterman-based searches are unable to accommodate large gaps (e.g. intron sequences) when performing sequence alignments. Hence, the search procedure was performed as follows. First, two separate multiple sequence alignments were generated corresponding to the segments of the EGF-like domains encoded by Exon-1 and Exon-2 for all known ligands. These alignments were then converted into two sequence profiles. The profile of protein sequences encoded by Exon-1 was then used as a bait to perform a Smith-Waterman-based profile search against genomic sequence data (detailed under “Materials and Methods”). The first 2000 hits from this search were recompiled into a miniature data base. This data base was then searched once again using the sequence profile generated from Exon-2. All hits harboring both Exon-1- and Exon-2-encoding sequences were thus identified. Using this methodology, we detected all of the ErbB ligands for which genomic sequences are available (all ligands but Betacellulin), including the most recent addition, namely Epigen (9Strachan L. Murison J.G. Prestidge R.L. Sleeman M.A. Watson J.D. Kumble K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18265-18271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To test the power of the genomic search, we created a series of sequence profiles, each lacking a single ErbB ligand and used them to rescreen the genomic and expressed sequence tag data bases. In each case, the missing ligand was reidentified from the genomic data, demonstrating that the search strategy is robust. Hence, we concluded that the combined expressed sequence tag and genomic search strategies are exhaustive, with no novel ligands being identified. Alignment of the EGF-like motifs of all human ErbB ligands indicated that EPG is most similar to EPG. A phylogeny analysis clustered five ligands of ErbB-1 and revealed an Epigen-Epiregulin relationship (Fig. 1B). Because of the small length of the EGF domain and the high disparity of sequence identity between different members of the family, the significance of the Epigen-Epiregulin clustering is not particularly high (a boot-strap value of 398 of 1000 trials). Nevertheless, in support of relatedness, EPG and EPR co-localize to the same genomic locus, at chromosomal position 4q21, and their open reading frames are separated by a mere 25 kilobase pairs (Fig. 1C). Similarly, this genomic linkage is evident in mice (data not shown), demonstrating that the Epiregulin-Epigen microchromosomal duplication took place in mammals before the evolutionary diversion of primates and rodents. Pro-Epigen Is a Transmembrane Glycoprotein Processed at Two Proteolytic Sites—Analysis of the primary sequence of pro-EPG predicts a type-1 transmembrane protein (9Strachan L. Murison J.G. Prestidge R.L. Sleeman M.A. Watson J.D. Kumble K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18265-18271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), but no data are available on glycosylation, proteolytic processing, or association with the plasma membrane. To address these issues, we stably expressed in CHO cells full-length pro-EPG, with and without a HA peptide tag at the C terminus. In addition, we immunized rabbits with recombinant EPG expressed in bacteria (rEPG, see below) and affinity-purified the antiserum. The immune serum and the purified antibody specifically recognized three proteins (p40, p30, and p13) in pro-EPG-expressing cells (Fig. 2A). Labeling of the surface of pro-EPG-expressing CHO cells with biotin detected p40 and p13 (Fig. 2B), indicating that p30 is an intracellular protein and confirming delivery of pro-EPG to the plasma membrane. To further prove that p40 is expressed at the cell surface, we tested the acquisition of resistance to EndoH, which parallels translocation of EndoH-sensitive high mannose precursors from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Separately, immunoprecipitates of EPG were treated with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF), an enzyme that cleaves all N-linked glycans but core fucosylated chains. Biotin labeled pro-EPG (p40) was susceptible to PNGaseF but resistant to EndoH (Fig. 2B), indicating that modifications of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of pro-EPG is completed in the Golgi, prior to delivery to the cell surface. Unlike p40, p13 displayed resistance to both EndoH and PNGaseF, and p30 was resistant to EndoH but sensitive to PNGaseF (Fig. 2, B and C). In addition to p13, p30, and p40, anti-HA antibodies detected a fourth protein, p7, which displayed resistance to both enzymes. On the basis of these results, and the presence of two predicted asparagine-based glycosylation sites, we inferred that pro-EPG carries an N-terminal N-glycosylation domain and two putative cleavage sites (Fig. 2D). To test this model, we surface-labeled pro-EPG-expressing cells with biotin, quenched reactive biotin, and chased cells in fresh medium. The most prominently labeled species was p13, suggesting that cleavage at the N-terminal site of pro-EPG precedes proteolysis at the membrane-flanking site (probably an Ala103-Val motif, similar to other EGF-like ligands; Fig. 2E). In summary, following insertion in the plasma membrane, the precursor of EPG undergoes two proteolytic cleavage events; a relatively rapid event releases the glycosylated domain, and a subsequent event clips within the short segment connecting the EGF-like domain with the transmembrane helix. Epigen Cannot Stimulate ErbB-2 in Isolation—EPG is the least characterized EGF-like ligand (9Strachan L. Murison J.G. Prestidge R.L. Sleeman M.A. Watson J.D. Kumble K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18265-18271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and its interaction with ErbB-2 has not been investigated. Therefore, we expressed EPG, as well as NRG-1β for control, as thioredoxin fusion proteins in bacteria, cleaved the products to remove thioredoxin, and purified the recombinant growth factors to homogeneity. Radiolabeling of rEPG confirmed absence of trace impurities (Fig. 3A), and mass spectrometry yielded a molecular mass consistent with oxidation of all cysteines. Next, we tested whether EPG could activate ErbB-2 in the absence of other members of the ErbB family. The D2 derivative of the IL-3-dependent 32D myeloid cell line, stably expressing human ErbB-2 on an ErbB-null background, was used (19Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Although IL-3 supported robust cell proliferation, treatment of D2 cells with rEPG in the absence of IL-3 resulted in growth arrest and partial cell death (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that EPG, like its closest homologue, EPR (20Shelly M. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Guarino B.C. Waterman H. Wang L.M. Lyass L. Alimandi M. Kuo A. Bacus S.S. Pierce J.H. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10496-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and in fact all other members of the EGF family, is unable to stimulate ErbB-2 in the absence of other ErbBs. Epigen Is a Potent Activator of ErbB-1 Despite Low Binding Affinity—Next we analyzed the activity of EPG toward the other ErbB receptors. We used derivatives of the 32D cell line expressing ErbB-1 (D1), ErbB-3 (D3), or ErbB-4 (D4), either singly or in combination with ErbB-2 (D12, D23, and D24). When D1 cells were treated with EGF, TGFα, and EPG over 4 days, EPG was found to be the most potent mitogen in comparison with the other ligands (Fig. 3C). Under similar experimental conditions neither D3 nor D4 cells displayed significant responses to EPG (data not shown). In line with the notion that ErbB-2 enhances signaling by the other ErbB receptors, the induction of proliferation observed in EPG-treated D12 cells was higher than in D1 cells (Fig. 3, C and D), and both D23 and D24 cells showed increases in cell proliferation, as reflected in both kinetics and dose curves (Fig. 3, E and F). Stimulation of the 32D cell lines with EGF or NRG-1β induced robust receptor phosphorylation, whereas the activity of EPG was relatively weak (Fig. 4, A and B, and data not shown). However, in the case of D1 and D12 cells, where EPG induces relatively potent mitogenic responses, the weak EPG-induced receptor phosphorylation was sustained up to 45 min, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase signals were almost comparable with those induced by EGF (Fig. 4, A and B). To understand what bearing the binding affinity of EPG has on its relatively high mitogenicity, ligand displacement analyses were performed. Unexpectedly, displacement of a radiolabeled EGF by EPG indicated an ∼100-fold difference in binding affinity, in favor of EGF (Fig. 4C, left panel). The reciprocal assay, which used a radiolabeled EPG and an unlabeled EGF, corroborated this finding (Fig. 4C, right panel). Further, the bi-sigmoidal curve observed"

HIV-1 viral infectivity factor (Vif) protein was shown to protect the virus from APOBEC3G-mediated viral cDNA hypermutation. The mechanism proposed for protection of the virus by HIV-1 Vif is mediated by APOBEC3G degradation through ubiquitination and the proteasomal pathway. Here we show that in Escherichia coli the APOBEC3G-induced cytidine deamination is inhibited by expression of Vif without depletion of deaminase. Moreover, inhibition of deaminase-mediated bacterial hypermutation is dependent on a single amino acid substitution D128K that renders APOBEC3G resistant to Vif inhibition. This single amino acid was elegantly proven by other authors to determine species-specific sensitivity. Our results show that in bacteria this single amino acid substitution controls Vif-dependent blocking of APOBEC3G that is dependent on a strong protein interaction. The C-terminal region of Vif is responsible for this strong protein-protein interaction. In conclusion, our experiments suggest a complement to the model of Vif-induced degradation of APOBEC3G by bringing to relevance that deaminase inhibition can also result from a direct interaction with Vif protein.

With analogy to APOBEC1 and AID, substitution mutations in the catalytic domain of APOBEC3G result in an increase of viral infectivity and decrease in dC-to-dT mutations.

Cell. 2003; 114: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar) described previously that Vif binds to the anti-viral host-cell factor APOBEC3G, although it was uncertain if the binding was transient or stable, or capable of altering APOBEC3G function. Our studies focused on this key question and investigated if Vif binding to APOBEC3G may affect deaminase function independently of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. To examine this hypothesis, we have expressed both APOBEC3G and Vif in E. coli and regulated the expression of its target gene to quantify cytidine deaminase activity. In addition, we aimed to evaluate in bacteria if the mechanism involved in a putative APOBEC3G-Vif interaction could be mediated by the single-amino acid substitution in APOBEC3G involved in species-specific restriction of Vif function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Constructs—Plasmid ptacKanL94P, a generous gift from Dr. Michel C. Nussenzweig, has a mutation at codon 94 that produces a kanamycin-sensitive (Kans) phenotype. Mutating CCA to TCA or CTA restores resistance. Transcription of kanL94P is controlled by the IPTG-inducible tac promoter; this promoter is repressed in the absence of inducer by the expression of laclq (29Ramiro A.R. Stavropoulos P. Jankovic M. Nussenzweig M.C. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The plasmid pASK-AIDE.coli expresses mouse AID, modified according to the E. coli codon preference to produce AIDE.coli. The plasmid pASK-APOBEC3G was constructed by subcloning human APOBEC3G gene amplified by PCR from pTrc99A-APOBEC3G, a kind gift of Dr. M. S. Neuberger (30Harris R.S. Sheehy A.M. Craig H.M. Malim M.H. Neuberger M.S. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The hemagglutinin (HA) tag was introduced at the C terminus of apobec3g gene and cloned in pASK-IBA7 (IBA, Germany) using KpnI and XhoI restriction sites. pASK-IBA7 constructs are under the control of tet promoter, which is repressed in the absence of AHT by tet repressor. The pDHC29-Vif was obtained by PCR amplification of vif gene derived from HIV-1NL43, subcloning in pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), digested with NotI and XhoI and cloned by compatible ends in pDHC29, a kind gift from Dr. Gregory J. Phillips (31Phillips G.J. Park S.K. Huber D. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The HA tag was introduced at the C terminus of vif gene. Constructs APOBEC3G-E67Q, APOBEC3G-D128K, and Vif-C114F were generated by site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). The APOBEC3G-E67Q mutant was obtained using the oligonucleotides 5′-AACTTAAGTACCACCCACAGATGAGATTCTTCCACTG-3′, 5′-CAGTGGAAGAATCTCATCTGTGGGTGGTACTTAAGTT-3′ (the substitution mutation is underlined). The APOBEC3G-D128K mutant was obtained using the oligonucleotides 5′-GCCTCTACTACTTCTGGAAGCCAGATTACCAGGAGGC-3′, 5′-GCCTCCTGGTAATCTGGCTTCCAGAAGTAGTAGAGGC-3′ (the substitution mutation is underlined). The Vif-C114F mutant was obtained using the oligonucleotides 5′-CCAACTAATTCATCTGCACTATTTTGATGCATTTTCAGAATCTGCTATAAGAAATACCA-3′, 5′-TGGTATTTCTTATAGCGAATTCTGAAAATGCATCAAAATAGTGCAGATGAATTAGTTGG-3′ (the substitution mutation is underlined). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing using the external primer 5′-AAATCGAAGGGCGCCGAG-3′. The plasmid replication origins of ptacKanL94D, pASK-IBA-7, and pDHC29 were pSC101, pUC and pST19, respectively, for compatibility in E. coli.The phagemid vector pComb3X-APOBEC3G was used for interaction assays in phage-ELISA. Briefly, a fragment encoding APOBEC3G was generated by PCR using the following primers: APO3G-Sfi-5 5′-GAGGAGGAGGCGGGGCCCAGGCGGCCATGAAGCCTCACTTCAGAACACAGTG-3′ and APO3G-Sfi-3 5′-GAGGAGGAGGAGGAGGAGCCTGGCCGGCCTGGCCGTTTTCCTGATTCTGGAGAATGGC-3′. The resulting PCR fragment was gel-purified, digested with the restriction endonuclease SfiI, and cloned into the phagemid vector pComb3X, which is derived from pComb3H (32Barbas III, C.F.

(29Ramiro A.R. Stavropoulos P. Jankovic M. Nussenzweig M.C. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Briefly, BH156 UDG-deficient strain (dcm-6, thr1, hisG4, leuB6, rpsL, ara14, supE44, lacY1, tonA31, tsx78, galK2, xyl5, thi1, mtl!, unh-1), a kind gift from Dr. Michel C. Nussenzweig, was transformed with ptacKanL94D followed by independent transformations with the following plasmid combinations: pASK-APOBEC3G plus pDHC29, pASK-AIDE.coli plus pDHC29, pASK-APOBEC3G plus pDHC29-Vif, pASK-APOBEC3G plus pDHC29-Vif-C114F, pASK-APOBEC3G-E67Q plus pDHC29, pASKAPOBEC3G-E67Q plus pDHC29-Vif, pASK-APOBEC3G-D128K plus pDHC29, and pASK-APOBEC3G-D128K plus pDHC29-Vif. For selection of ptacKanL94P, cell cultures were grown in selective medium containing 100 μg/ml spectinomycin (Spc), reflecting the presence of aad9 gene. For selection of pDHC29-derived constructs described above, cell cultures were grown in selective medium containing 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol (Clo). For selection of pASK-derived constructs described above, cell cultures were grown in selective medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Amp), reflecting the presence of bla gene. For the RifR assay, 10–12 independent colonies were grown in selective SOB medium (20 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 0.5 g NaCl, 250 mm KCl, per liter, pH 7) supplemented with 20 mm MgCl2 to an optical density of 0.6 at 660 nm and induced with 0.2 μg/ml AHT (Sigma) plus 1 mm IPTG for 3 h at 37 °C. Cell cultures were centrifuged, washed, and spread in LB plates containing 100 μg/ml Amp, 100 μg/ml Spc, and 34 μg/ml Clo (cell viability plates) or 100 μg/ml Amp, 100 μg/ml Spc, 34 μg/ml Clo, and 100 μg/ml rifampicin (Rif) (RifR plates). The mutation frequencies were calculated as the ratio of RifR colonies to the total number of viable cells, identified for each individual colony. For the KanR assay, we proceeded in a similar manner. Cultures were spread in LB plates containing 100 μg/ml Amp, 100 μg/ml Spc, and 34 μg/ml Clo (cell viability plates) or 100 μg/ml Amp, 100 μg/ml Spc, 34 μg/ml Clo, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin (KanR plates). The mutation frequencies were calculated as the ratio of KanR colonies to the total number of viable cells, identified for each individual colony. Three independent assays were performed for each RifR- and KanR-induced mutation assay. For protein expression of APOBEC3G, AIDE.coli, and Vif constructs, 10 ml of cell cultures was disrupted by sonication in PBS, plus complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The APOBEC3G and Vif lysates were subject to Western blot with HRP-conjugated anti-HA monoclonal antibody 3F10 (Roche Applied Science). Similar lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science) and anti-Vif polyclonal serum plus protein A. AIDE.coli was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG beads. Samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions, transferred to a Hybond-C Extra membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and blotted with HRP-conjugated anti-HA monoclonal antibody 3F10 (Roche Applied Science) and HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody.Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—To evaluate protein-protein interactions in vivo, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays. BH156 cells were transformed with seven different plasmid combinations: pDHC29 and pASK-APOBEC3G, pDHC29-Vif and pASK-APOBEC3G, pDHC29 and pASK-APOBEC3G-E67Q, pDHC29-Vif and pASK-APOBEC3G-E67Q, pDHC29 and pASK-APOBEC3G-D128K, pDHC29-Vif and pASK-APOBEC3G-D128K, and pDHC29-Vif-C114F and pASK-APOBEC3G. Cells were grown in SOB medium supplemented with 20 mm MgCl2 and respective antibiotics for plasmid selection. Protein expression was induced at OD660 nm ∼ 0.6 with 1 mm IPTG and 0.2 μg/ml AHT during 3 h. Cells were disrupted by sonication in PBS and supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). A mixture of protein A-Sepharose™ beads (Amersham Biosciences) with the BH156 lysate was prepared and incubated on a rotator during 4 h at 4 °C. In parallel, a mixture for each cell lysate was prepared with anti-Vif polyclonal serum, kindly provided by Dr. Dana Gabuzda, and incubated on ice during 3 h (protein expression mix). Following incubation, the mix of protein A-Sepharose™ beads was added to the protein expression mix and incubated overnight on a rotator at 4 °C. When applicable, samples were washed four times with low ionic buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1× with 0.15 m NaCl, 0,05 m Tris, pH 7.5) or high ionic buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, and 1× with 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris, pH 7.5). Beads were boiled in Laemmli buffer, and proteins were resolved by standard SDS-PAGE techniques, transferred to a Hybond-C Extra membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and blotted with HRP-conjugated anti-HA monoclonal antibody 3F10 (Roche Applied Science).Phage Display of APOBEC3G—To display APOBEC3G protein on M13 phage, phagemid pComb3X expressing apobec3g gene in fusion with gene III of M13 was transformed into E. coli strain ER2537. A fresh colony of APOBEC3G-HA was grown overnight at 37 °C in SOB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. 1 ml of cell culture was inoculated in 100 ml of SOB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were grown at 37 °C until OD660 nm = 0.6 and infected with 2 ml of M13 helper phage (1012 plaque-forming units/ml) during 1.5 h at 37 °C. Kanamycin was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, and growth continued overnight. Following centrifugation at 3000 × g, phages were precipitated from cell supernatant with 4% polyethylene glycol 8000 and 3% NaCl during 30 min on ice, centrifuged at 15,000 × g during 30 min, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. The titer of phages displaying APOBEC3G-HA was determined. Bacteria transformed with pComb3X/APOBEC3G was used to asses the expression of the deaminase. Briefly, transformed ER2537 cells were induced with 0.5 mm IPTG for 12 h at 37 °C after cells reached OD660 nm = 0.6. Bacterial lysates were resolved by standard SDS-PAGE techniques, transferred to a Hybond-C Extra membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and blotted with anti-HA monoclonal antibody 3F10 (Roche Applied Science).Phage-ELISA Measurements—Phage-ELISA was used to determine the relative affinity and specificity of APOBEC3G phage for HIV-1 Vif protein.To analyze relative binding affinities of phage-displayed APOBEC3G, ELISA plates (Nunc) were coated with 1 μg of HIV-1 Vif protein (33Yang X. Goncalves J. Gabuzda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10121-10129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or soy milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Wells were blocked for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.5% soy milk in PBS. Phages were diluted 1:100 and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. After washing, HRP-conjugated anti-M13 monoclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. The results were measured by optical density at 405 nm.To identify Vif protein domains involved in APOBEC3G-Vif interaction, a competitive-phage ELISA assay using 100 μm HIV-1 consensus B Vif (15-mer) peptides was used. HIV-1 consensus B Vif (15-mer) peptides were provided by the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagents Program. ELISA plates (Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 300 ng of purified recombinant HIV-1 Vif protein (33Yang X. Goncalves J. Gabuzda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10121-10129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Wells were blocked for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.5% soy milk in PBS. APOBEC3G phages were incubated 30 min at 30 °C following by 2 h at 4 °C with 100 μm of each Vif peptide in low ionic buffer or high ionic buffer as described for co-immunoprecipitation and added to coated wells. Phages were washed with PBS/0.05% Tween 20, and HRP-conjugated anti-M13 monoclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. The results were measured by optical density at 405 nm.RESULTSAPOBEC3G Induces Cytidine Deamination in E. coli—To examine whether APOBEC3G induces rapid mutation in E. coli, an initial study was performed to analyze its induced mutation activity using rpoB gene as a selectable marker. For efficient measurement we used mouse AIDE.coli as a positive control of cytidine deaminase (kindly provided by Dr. Nussenzweig) (29Ramiro A.R. Stavropoulos P. Jankovic M. Nussenzweig M.C. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Both mouse AIDE.coli and human APOBEC3G were cloned in pASK under the control of the tetracycline (tet) promoter, inducible with anhydrotetracycline (AHT). Mutator activity of the expressed proteins was monitored by assessing the frequency of rifampicin-resistant (Rif R) colonies, which resulted from deamination of 1 of the 11 dC residues in the rpoB gene encoding the β-subunit of RNA polymerase (12Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 29Ramiro A.R. Stavropoulos P. Jankovic M. Nussenzweig M.C. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). To control the mutator efficiency of the human APOBEC3G deaminase, a putative active site mutant APOBEC3G-E67Q was constructed. This mutation was identified by ClustalW multiple alignment between AID, APOBEC1, APOBEC3G, and the described previously active site mutant of AIDE.coli (Fig. 1) (29Ramiro A.R. Stavropoulos P. Jankovic M. Nussenzweig M.C. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in BH156 UDG-deficient (ung-1) E. coli. The absence of UDG activity in the cells facilitates subsequent analysis, once it prevents the removal of uracil in U-G mismatch resulting from cytidine deamination, allowing the increase of mutation frequency caused by the activity of deaminase expression. In this assay a population of 10–12 individual colonies of bacteria alone, and expressing AID, APOBEC3G, and APOBEC3G-E67Q were assayed in the presence of tet inducer during 3 h after the cells reached OD660 nm of 0.6. This density corresponds to three to four divisions, allowing a reproducible evaluation during the logarithmic bacterial growth curve. Mutation frequencies were calculated as the ratio of Rif R colonies to the total number of viable cells for each individual colony. In Fig. 2A, we observed the following mean frequencies for the number of Rif R colonies when AIDE.coli and APOBEC3G were expressed: 398.9 × 10–9 and 538.9 × 10–9, respectively. These results showed that both deaminases had similar mutation efficiency in this target. The mutation capability of both AIDE.coli and APOBEC3G was 10 to 15 times higher than that of bacterial cells alone (mean frequency, 34.65 × 10–9) and the putative active site mutant, APOBEC3G-E67Q (mean frequency, 54.4 × 10–9). The results obtained with APOBEC3G-E67Q mutant were consistent with other reports where a residual deaminase activity may result from the usage of an alternative proton donor other than the AID E58 homologue (12Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 29Ramiro A.R. Stavropoulos P. Jankovic M. Nussenzweig M.C. Nat.

Expression of AIDE.coli and APOBEC3G induce mutator phenotype. The mouse aid gene, modified according to the E. coli codon preference to produce AIDE.coli. The mutator phenotype of APOBEC3G is dependent on the putative catalytic site Glu-67. The BH156 UDG-deficient strain was sequentially transformed with ptacKanL94P, plus AIDE.coli or APOBEC3G or APOBEC3G-E67Q as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Several (10Sheehy A.M.

For further understanding of the role of Synoviolin in vivo, we generated in this study synoviolin-deficient (syno–/–) mice by genetargeted disruption. Strikingly, all fetuses lacking syno died in utero around embryonic day 13.5, although Hrd1p, a yeast orthologue of Synoviolin, is non-essential for survival. Histologically, hypocellularity and aberrant apoptosis were noted in the syno–/– fetal liver. Moreover, definitive erythropoiesis was affected in non-cell autonomous manner in syno–/– embryos, causing death in utero. Cultured embryonic fibroblasts derived from syno–/– mice were more susceptible to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis than those from syno+/+ mice, but the susceptibility was rescued by overexpression of synoviolin.

Cell. 2001; 107: 893-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, newly synthesized proteins are transported into the ER where they are correctly folded. However, various local environmental conditions, such as the influx of a large amount of proteins into the ER, could trigger a cellular response termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) to overcome this problem (3Welihinda A.A. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Gene. Expr. 1999; 7: 293-300PubMed Google Scholar). During the UPR response, the synthesis of new proteins is globally inhibited by inactivation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α to reduce additional accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, and genes encoding the ER chaperone proteins, including Bip/Grp78 and Grp94, are also up-regulated to re-fold the misfolded proteins correctly (4Ron D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). When the amount of misfolded proteins exceeds the protein folding capacity, despite UPR, misfolded proteins are eliminated by ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent degradation processes, known as the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) system (1Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 5Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2660-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Misfolded proteins in the ER are translocated into the cytosol, where they are targeted for the 26 S proteasome by the ubiquitin ligase enzymes. Various ubiquitin ligases are reported in the ERAD system of mammalian cells, including C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (6Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.Y.

Recent studies have shown that functional disorders of the UPR and/or ERAD system can augment caspase-dependent apoptosis of cells treated with some ER stress-inducible chemical agents (13Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J.

Sci. 2001; 26: 504-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). These results can explain the molecular pathogenesis of certain human diseases that arise from the ERAD system dysfunction. For instance, production of expanded polyglutamine causes certain inherited neurodegenerative disorders (15Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R.

Furthermore, mutation of the parkin gene, the product of which is a well known ubiquitin ligase protein in the ERAD system, is thought to result in neuronal death of the substantia nigra in patients with autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (18Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). These findings emphasize the importance of the ERAD system in cell survival in both physiological and pathological conditions and that dysfunction of the ERAD system causes various disorders.Recently, we used immunoscreening with anti-synovial cell antibodies and cloned Synoviolin, a human homologue of the yeast ubiquitin ligase (E3) Hrd1p/Del3 (19Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), which is an ER-resident membrane protein with an RING-H2 motif. This molecule is overexpressed in the rheumatoid synovium, and 10 out of 33 littermates of synoviolin-overexpressing mice developed spontaneous arthropathy. Moreover, in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model, only 7% of synoviolin+/– mice developed arthritis compared with 65% of wild-type littermates. In addition, the proportion of cells positive for terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated d-UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis was significantly increased in synovial tissues of synoviolin+/– mice with CIA (20Amano T. Yamasaki S. Yagishita N. Tsuchimochi K. Shin H. Kawahara K. Aratani S. Fujita H. Zhang L. Ikeda R. Fujii R. Komiya S. Nishioka K. Maruyama I. Fukamizu A. Nakajima T.

These findings demonstrated that rheumatoid arthritis is oppositely caused by hyperactivation of the ERAD system through the anti-apoptotic effect of Synoviolin. The present study was designed to determine the function of Synoviolin in vivo. Strikingly, dysfunction of Synoviolin was associated with embryonic lethality, though Hrd1p, a yeast orthologue of Synoviolin, was non-essential for survival (24Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Our results clearly indicate that Synoviolin plays an indispensable role in maintenance of life.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of synoviolin-deficient Mice—Generation of synoviolin-deficient mice was described previously (20Amano T. Yamasaki S. Yagishita N. Tsuchimochi K. Shin H. Kawahara K. Aratani S. Fujita H. Zhang L. Ikeda R. Fujii R. Komiya S. Nishioka K. Maruyama I. Fukamizu A. Nakajima T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2436-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The following primers were used for genotyping of embryos; 5′-ACACAGTCACCTCCGGTTCTGTATTCACTG-3′ (P1) and 5′-CTCAGTAACAGCGTACCAGGACCGTTCCAG-3′ (P2). PCR analysis using these primers in 1 cycle at 9 °C for 1 min followed by 35 cycles at 98 °C for 20 s, 68 °C for 10 min, with an extension step of 10 min at 72 °C at the end of last cycle, produced 6.9- and 2.6-kb fragments from the mutant and wild alleles, respectively.Isolation and Histological Analysis of the Embryo—Mouse embryos were removed from the uterus, and the yolk sac was harvested for genotyping. The embryos were then fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and embedded in paraffin. Next, 4-μm sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, whereas some sections were used for the TUNEL analysis and immunohistochemistry (wild-type (syno+/+): n = 15, homozygous mutants (syno–/–): n = 10). Peripheral blood was collected in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50% fetal calf serum and in 10 mm EDTA for cytospin preparation (syno+/+: n = 15; syno–/–: n = 10). Fetal livers from E12.5 embryos were disrupted with a 25-gauge needle in 1 ml of same medium, and ∼7 μl was diluted into 200 μl of medium, and cytocentrifuged (syno+/+: n = 7; syno–/–: n = 5). Slides of peripheral blood and fetal liver were stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa. In three different areas, 1000 erythroblasts were counted, and the percentage of abnormal erythroblasts was calculated. Furthermore, 100 macrophages were counted, and the rate of erythrophagocytosis was calculated.Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (25Kawahara K. Watanabe S. Ohshima T. Soejima Y. Oishi T. Aratani S. Nakata M. Shibata M. Inoue K. Amano T. Fujii R. Yanai K. Hagiwara M. Fukamizu A. Maruyama I. Nakajima T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Sections were incubated overnight with anti-ϵy-globin antibody, anti-β-major-globin antibody, or anti-GATA-1 antibody (26Ito E.

The specific reaction was visualized using a diaminobenzidine substrate chromogen system as explained in the manual supplied by the manufacturer (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). In three different areas, 1000 cells were counted, and the proportion of positive cells was calculated.Colony Forming Assays—Cells were prepared from livers of each genotype of E12.5 embryos in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and then counted (syno+/+: n = 5; heterozygous mutants (syno+/–): n = 4; syno–/–: n = 4). Cell suspensions and recombinant cytokines specific for each assay were mixed with MethoCult M3234 (StemCell Technologies, Tokyo) as described previously (29Neubauer H. Cumano A. Muller M. Wu H. Huffstadt U. Pfeffer K. Cell. 1998; 93: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 35-mm dishes and cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For colony forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) assay, 2 × 104 cells were cultured in 1 unit/ml recombinant murine erythropoietin (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN), and benzidine-positive CFU-E colonies were scored at day 3. For the burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) assay, 1 × 105 cells were cultured in 2 units/ml erythropoietin and 100 ng/ml stem cell factor (R&D Systems), and benzidine-positive BFU-E colonies were scored at day 7. For colony forming unit-macrophage (CFU-M) and colony forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) assay, 5 × 103 cells were cultured in 10 ng/ml macrophage-colony stimulating factor or granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (R&D Systems), and CFU-M or CFU-GM colonies were scored at day 7.Transplantation of Fetal Liver Cells—Single cell suspensions prepared from E12.5 fetal liver of the wild-type or syno–/– embryos were pooled (n = 10). 3-month-old female DBA1 mice (Japan SLC, Inc.) were lethally irradiated (900 cGy) and intravenously injected with 1 × 106 fetal liver cells. The mice were maintained on aqueous antibiotics (1000 units/ml polymixin B sulfate and 1.1 mg/ml neomycin sulfate). At 1, 2, and 3 weeks after transplantation, 0.4-μl samples of the peripheral blood were lysed and analyzed by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel (30Alter B. Campbell A.S. Hemoglobin. 1982; 6: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.TUNEL Analysis—Tissues were prepared as described above. Conditioned culture cells were fixed in 10% formalin for 15 min and attached to aminopropyl triethoxysilane-coated slide glasses. These specimens were subjected to TUNEL analysis. The latter was performed according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (MEBSTAIN Apoptosis kit II, Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan). In three different areas, the number of TUNEL-positive cells among 1000 cells was determined, and the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was calculated.Isolation of MEFs—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from E12.5 embryos of the syno–/– and wild-type mice by trypsin digestion after removal of the head and internal organs. The isolated cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal calf serum.X-irradiation—X-irradiation was performed by using the MBR-1505R2 x-ray generator (Hitachi Medical, Co., Japan) at 150 kV and 15 mA with a 1.00-mm Al filter at a dose rate of 1.04 Gy/min.Adenovirus Infection—Adenovirus vectors containing genes for FLAG-tagged Synoviolin or LacZ were prepared by using the Adeno-X™ Expression System according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). The viral preparations were titrated with the end-point dilution assay on HEK293 cells. The number of virus particles (measured in plaque-forming units) per cell was expressed in multiplicity of infection values. The infected MEFs were allowed to express targeted genes for 48 h and were then treated with the indicated reagents.Western Blotting—MEFs were collected and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.25% SDS, 0.05% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% glycerol. Aliquots of clear cell lysates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-Synoviolin monoclonal antibody (20Amano T. Yamasaki S. Yagishita N. Tsuchimochi K. Shin H. Kawahara K. Aratani S. Fujita H. Zhang L. Ikeda R. Fujii R. Komiya S. Nishioka K. Maruyama I. Fukamizu A. Nakajima T.

The bound antibodies were detected by the peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins and ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences).Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were examined for statistical significance using the Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 denoted the presence of a statistically significant difference.Ethical Considerations—All experimental protocols described in this study were approved by the Ethics Review Committee of St. Marianna University School of Medicine.RESULTSTargeted Disruption of the synoviolin Gene Results in Embryonic Lethality—To disrupt the mouse synoviolin gene, we constructed the targeting vector (20Amano T. Yamasaki S. Yagishita N. Tsuchimochi K. Shin H. Kawahara K. Aratani S. Fujita H. Zhang L. Ikeda R. Fujii R. Komiya S. Nishioka K. Maruyama I. Fukamizu A. Nakajima T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2436-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Two independently targeted TT2 embryonic clones were injected into ICR 8-cell embryo and gave germ line transmission (20Amano T. Yamasaki S. Yagishita N. Tsuchimochi K. Shin H. Kawahara K. Aratani S.

F1 mice heterozygous (syno+/–) for the mutation were viable, fertile, and showed no apparent phenotypic abnormalities (data not shown). These heterozygous mice were interbred to generate homozygous mutants (syno–/–), and newborn offspring were genotyped, but no syno–/– mice were identified, indicating that loss of Synoviolin is incompatible with normal embryogenesis (Table I). syno–/–Embryos Die in Utero around E13.5—To identify the stage of embryonic development at which the synoviolin mutation is lethal, we analyzed E10.5–E18.5 embryos. At E11.5, the majority (88.9%) of synoviolin-deficient embryos were viable; however, at E13.5, only a few (28.6%, Table I) syno–/– embryos were found alive. Morphological analysis showed that E13.5 syno–/– embryos were not different from the wild-type littermates (see Fig. 2A). However, histological examination of syno–/– embryos showed that the cellular density was decreased especially in the liver, although there was no difference with other organs (Fig. 1B–D). Indeed, the livers of syno–/– embryos were smaller in size than those of wild-type embryos (data not shown), and the number of hepatocytes was significantly less than the wild-type littermates (syno–/–: 1.82 ± 0.81 × 105 cells/liver; syno+/+: 10.36 ± 0.72 × 105 cells/liver, p < 0.01).Table IGenotypes of offsprings from syno+/- intercrossesStageTotal (litters)syno+/++/--/-(Alive)(Dead)%Postnatal10 (2)2 (20)8 (80)0 (0)E18.53 (1)3 (100)0 (0)0 (0)E17.54 (1)0 (0)4 (100)0 (0)E15.55 (1)1 (20)4 (80)0 (0)E14.550 (8)22 (44)22 (44)0 (0)6 (12)E13.581 (13)27 (33)47 (58)2 (3)5 (6)E12.5104 (17)26 (25)67 (64)10 (10)1 (6)E11.535 (5)8 (23)18 (51)8 (23)1 (3)E10.526 (4)8 (31)12 (46)6 (23)0 (0)Total318 (52)9718239 Open table in a new tab Fig. 1Phenotypes of E13.5 syno–/– embryos.

Next, we examined whether such hypocellularity influenced the hematological status, because the liver becomes the main hematopoietic organ by E12.5 (26Ito E. Toki T. Ishihara H. Ohtani H. Gu L. Yokoyama M. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1993; 362: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 27Ohneda K. Yamamoto M.

First, to investigate the status of hematopoiesis in syno–/– embryos, cytocentrifuge preparations of peripheral blood from E12.5, and the livers of E12.5 embryos were examined. Staining of peripheral blood obtained from E12.5 showed reduced number of erythroblasts in syno–/– embryos (11.58 ± 0.85 × 105 cells/embryo) compared with that of wild-type (25.10 ± 0.66 × 105 cells/embryo). Erythroblasts in syno–/– embryos, the proportion of abnormal erythroblasts showing Howell-Jolly bodies and/or nuclear fragmentation (10.7 ± 0.2%) was markedly higher than that of wild-type littermates (1.8 ± 0.34%, see Fig. 3A, arrowhead). In addition, although there was almost no difference in the number of macrophages, the percentage of macrophages exhibiting erythrophagocytosis was significantly higher in the livers of syno–/– embryos (22.0 ± 0.86%) compared with the wild-type (1.7 ± 0.35%, Fig. 2B, arrowhead). At that stage, there was no difference in other lineages (data not shown). These results indicate reduced erythroblast formation and abnormal differentiation in syno–/– embryos.Fig. 3Apoptosis in syno–/– embryos. A, TUNEL analyses of the livers of syno+/+ and syno–/– embryos. The number of TUNEL-positive cells was higher in syno–/– embryos (25%) than in syno+/+ embryos (1%) (×200). This difference was also observed throughout the entire body of syno–/– embryos (data not shown). B, hematoxylin and eosin staining of syno+/+ and syno–/– embryos (×200). C, MEFs derived from syno+/+ and syno–/– mice were treated with various apoptotic stimuli, including anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml for 48 h), X-irradiation (6 Gy for 72 h), thapsigargin (1 μm for 48 h), and tunicamycin (10 ng/ml for 48 h), or untreated (–), in 1% fetal calf serum medium. Apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL analysis. D, syno+/+ and syno–/– MEFs were treated with the indicated doses of stimuli. Apoptosis was measured by quantitation of DNA fragmentation using the cell death detection ELISA method (Roche Applied Science). *, p < 0.01. The number of apoptotic syno–/– MEFs was higher in cultures treated with thapsigargin and tunicamycin compared with the respective syno+/+ MEFs. E, syno+/+ and syno–/– MEFs were infected with adenovirus vector (100 multiplicity of infection) carrying LacZ(–) or synoviolin gene (+), then treated with the same aforementioned agents. In syno–/– MEFs, the ER-stress-induced apoptosis was rescued by infection with synoviolin. F, syno+/+ and syno–/– MEFs were treated with or without tunicamycin (10 μg/ml), thapsigargin (10 μm), and brefeldin A (10 μg/ml) for 24 h. The ER stress-inducible protein was expressed in syno–/– MEFs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm the presence of defective hematopoiesis in syno–/– embryos in vivo, the expression levels of globin and GATA-1 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, because these are marker and master genes in erythropoiesis (26Ito E.

The level of ϵy-globin, which is expressed predominantly during embryonic (primitive) erythropoiesis, was similar in syno–/– and wild-type embryos (syno+/+: 6.25 ± 0.62%; syno–/–: 7.20 ± 0.23%, Fig. 2C). On the other hand, the level of β-major-globin, which first occurs in fetal livers during definitive erythropoiesis, was markedly reduced in syno–/– embryos (syno+/+: 4.60 ± 0.92%; syno–/–: 0.90 ± 0.22%, Fig. 2D, arrowhead). Moreover, in wild-type embryos, the expression of GATA-1, which plays a key role in the gene regulation during erythropoiesis (26Ito E. Toki T. Ishihara H. Ohtani H. Gu L. Yokoyama M. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1993; 362: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 27Ohneda K. Yamamoto M. Acta Haematol. 2002; 108: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 28Shimizu R. Takahashi S. Ohneda K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5250-526001Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), was similar in both erythrocytes and megakaryocytes, whereas in syno–/– embryos, GATA-1 was mostly expressed in megakaryocytes (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that the absence of synoviolin results in blockade of definitive erythropoiesis.Next, we examined erythropoiesis in syno–/–in vitro. Specifically, we examined the ability of cells derived from E12.5 fetal livers to form CFU-M, CFU-GM, CFU-E, and BFU-E. The colony-forming abilities of CFU-M and CFU-GM were not different in wild-type and syno–/– fetal livers (data not shown). Unexpectedly, the proportions of BFU-E and CFU-E were similar in wild-type and syno–/– fetal liver cells (Fig. 2F). These results demonstrate that there was no difference between syno–/– and wild-type with regard to the number of macrophages, granulocytes, and erythroid progenitors. Moreover, erythrocyte progenitors of syno–/– could differentiate in vitro to produce hemoglobin, which was identified by staining for benzidine (data not shown). These findings contradict the results of in vivo studies such as reduced number of erythroblasts in peripheral blood of syno–/–, and the decreased number of β-globin-positive cells in the fetal liver of syno–/–. These results suggest abnormality of environment of hematopoiesis in syno–/–. To determine if the defect in erythropoiesis was cell autonomous, we transplanted fetal liver cells from F8 embryos into wild-type DBA1 mice that had been lethally irradiated (33Kawane K. Fukuyama H. Kondoh G. Takeda J. Ohsawa Y. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Science. 2001; 292: 1546-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The control-irradiated mice did not survive beyond 3 weeks, whereas mice that received the wild-type or syno–/– fetal liver cells survived for at least 4 weeks. The recipient DBA1 strain is homozygous for the Hbbd haplotype, whereas the liver cells from F8 embryos are homozygous for the Hbbs haplotype (34Russell E.S. McFarland E.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 241: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As shown Fig. 3G, 30–50% of β-globin in mice transplanted with either wild-type or syno–/– fetal liver cells had the Hbbs haplotype at 3 weeks after transplantation. Considered together, these findings indicate that the syno–/– erythroid cells can develop into mature cells, and that the failure of definitive erythropoiesis in the syno–/– mice is due to a non-cell-autonomous effect. Therefore, it is expected that abnormal morphology in syno–/– erythroid is secondary to change in the local environment; i.e. liver.Apoptotic Cell Death in syno–/–Embryos—The abnormalities of definitive"
https://openalex.org/W1968874127,"Yeast flavohemoglobin, YHb, encoded by the nuclear gene YHB1, has been implicated in both the oxidative and nitrosative stress responses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previous studies have shown that the expression of YHB1 is optimal under normoxic or hyperoxic conditions, yet respiring yeast cells have low levels of reduced YHb pigment as detected by carbon monoxide (CO) photolysis difference spectroscopy of glucose-reduced cells. Here, we have addressed this apparent discrepancy by determining the intracellular location of the YHb protein and analyzing the relationships between respiration, YHb level, and intracellular location. We have found that although intact respiration-proficient cells lack a YHb CO spectral signature, cell extracts from these cells have both a YHb CO spectral signature and nitric oxide (NO) consuming activity. This suggests either that YHb cannot be reduced in vivo or that YHb heme is maintained in an oxidized state in respiring cells. By using an anti-YHb antibody and CO difference spectroscopy and by measuring NO consumption, we have found that YHb localizes to two distinct intracellular compartments in respiring cells, the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol. Moreover, we have found that the distribution of YHb between these two compartments is affected by the presence or absence of oxygen and by the mitochondrial genome. The findings suggest that YHb functions in oxidative stress indirectly by consuming NO, which inhibits mitochondrial respiration and leads to enhanced production of reactive oxygen species, and that cells can regulate intracellular distribution of YHb in accordance with this function.

Hemoglobins are found in all major groups of organisms including plants, vertebrates, invertebrates, protozoa, bacteria, and fungi (1Hardison R. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1099-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They make up a diverse superfamily of proteins that are grouped together because they all bind oxygen reversibly and possess a conserved heme binding domain, the “myoglobin fold” (2Riggs A. Am. Zool. 1991; 31: 535-545Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Aside from these common features, hemoglobins are otherwise divergent in structure and complexity. Indeed, whereas most vertebrate hemoglobins consist of two types of polypeptide subunits that have single heme domains and form tetrameric oligomers, microbial, invertebrate, and protozoan hemoglobins are far more varied. Bacterial, fungal, and protozoan hemoglobins fall into two general types: (i) dimeric hemoproteins composed of two single heme domain polypeptides; and (ii) monomeric flavohemoproteins containing a single heme binding domain at the amino terminus and a carboxyl-terminal FAD-binding domain that is related to those found in proteins in the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase family (3Poole R.K. Hughes M.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). From DNA sequence analysis, these flavohemoglobins appear to form a distinct subgroup within the hemoglobin family (1Hardison R. J. Exp.

Recently, it has been discovered that the hemoglobins of both eucaryotes and prokaryotes have additional functions relating to nitric oxide (NO). 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; CO, carbon monoxide; YHb, yeast flavohemoglobin.1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; CO, carbon monoxide; YHb, yeast flavohemoglobin. For example, in mammals hemoglobin functions to transport NO to effectors that regulate blood flow and, therefore, the rate of delivery of oxygen to tissue cells (5Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar, 6Stamler J.S. Jia L. Eu J.P. McMahon T.J. Demchenko I.T. Bonaventura J. Gernett K.

In contrast, the function of the Escherichia coli hemoglobin HMP is to protect cells against nitrosative stress brought about by NO or NO-donating S-nitrosothiols (9Membrillo-Hernandez J.

S. A. 1998; 95: 14100-14105Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This hemoglobin functions in both aerobic and anaerobic cells. In the presence of air it functions as an NO oxygenase that generates mainly nitrate, and in the absence of air it functions as an NO reductase that generates nitrous oxide. HMP may also play a role in oxidative stress (9Membrillo-Hernandez J. Coopamah M.D. Anjun M.F. Stevanin T.M. Kelly A. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 748-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The flavohemoglobin of Ralsonia eutropha is involved in denitrification with the production of N2O (12Cramm R. Siddiqui R.A. Friedrich B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7349-7353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The genes that encode the flavohemoglobins of R. eutropha, and Bacillus subtilis are up-regulated under oxygen-limiting conditions (13La Celle M. Kumano M. Kurita K. Yamane K. Zuber P. Nakano M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3803-3808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Frey A.D. Bailey J.E. Kallio P.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest a multiplicity of roles for hemoglobins. The physiological role(s) of the flavohemoglobin found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells is (are) still somewhat unclear. The expression of its gene, YHB1, is induced by oxygen, which is the opposite of the effect oxygen has on the expression of most bacterial hemoglobin genes. This observation has been taken to indicate that the hemoglobins of yeast and bacteria may have different functions (15Buisson N. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9527-9533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Several observations suggest physiological connections between the expression/function of this protein, mitochondrial respiration, and oxidative and nitrosative stress. First, respiring S. cerevisiae cells have low levels of reduced YHb pigment as detected by carbon monoxide (CO) photolysis difference spectroscopy (16Waterland R.A. Basu A. Chance B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4180-4186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular levels of a reduced YHb CO photoproduct pigment are increased in cells in which the mitochondrial respiratory chain has been compromised by either mutation (16Waterland R.A. Basu A. Chance B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4180-4186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or respiration inhibitors (17Zhu H. Riggs A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5015-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 18Ycas M. Exp. Cell Res. 1956; 11: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Its level also increases in cells expressing the hypoxic isoform Vb of cytochrome c oxidase subunit V under aerobic conditions (16Waterland R.A. Basu A. Chance B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4180-4186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, yeast cells carrying a deletion in YHB1, the structural gene for YHb, become sensitive to some conditions that promote oxidative (19Zhao X.-J. Raitt D. Burke P.V. Clewell A.S. Kwast K.E. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25131-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and other forms of stress (15Buisson N. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9527-9533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that some conditions promoting oxidative stress increase the expression of YHB1 (19Zhao X.-J. Raitt D. Burke P.V. Clewell A.S. Kwast K.E. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25131-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), but YHB1 expression under some of these conditions has been questioned (15Buisson N. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9527-9533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been reported recently that YHb metabolizes NO and functions as an NO oxygenase under aerobic conditions and an NO reductase under anaerobic conditions (4Liu L. Zeng M. Hausladen A. Heitman J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4672-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To better understand the physiological function of YHb, we have examined here the relationship between respiration and the level of assembled YHb, established the intracellular location of YHb, and looked at the effects of oxygen, respiration, oxidative stress, and the mitochondrial genome on intracellular YHb localization. Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—The following strains of S. cerevisiae were used: JM43 (MATα his4-580 trp1-289 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 [rho+]) (20McEwen J.E. Ko C. Kloeckner-Gruissem B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); JM43ρ0, an isochromosomal respiration-deficient derivative of JM43 that lacks a functional mitochondrial genome (16Waterland R.A. Basu A. Chance B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4180-4186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); JM43GD5ab (JM43 with cox5b::LEU2 cox5aD::URA3), an isogenic derivative of JM43 carrying gene disruptions in the COX5a and COX5b genes (21Trueblood C.E. Poyton R.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3520-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); and DR11 (JM43 with yhb1::URA1), an isogenic derivative of JM43 carrying a YHB1 gene disruption (19Zhao X.-J. Raitt D. Burke P.V. Clewell A.S. Kwast K.E. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25131-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For aerobic growth, cells were grown on a shaker (200 rpm) at 28–30 °C in YPGal (1% Difco yeast extract, 2% Difco Bacto-peptone, and 2% galactose). For anaerobic growth, cells were grown in a fermenter sparged with 2.5% CO2 in O2-free N2 as described (22Poyton R.O. Dirmeier R. O'Brien K. David P. Dodd A. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 381: 644-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Yeast strains used for examining the effects of mutations in copper-zinc or manganese superoxide dismutase on YHb were as follows: EG103 (MATα, leu2-3, his3Δ1, trp1-289, ura3-52); EG110 (EG103 with sod2Δ::TRP1); EG118 (EG103 with sod1ΔA::URA3); and EG133 (EG103 with sod1ΔA::URA3, sod2Δ::TRP1) (23Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). These strains were kindly provided by Edith Gralla. For these experiments, cells were grown to mid-exponential phase in YPD media (1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% dextrose) in a shaker at 200 rpm and 28 °C. Preparation of Whole Cell Lysates—Whole cell extracts were prepared from cells grown to mid-exponential phase in YPGal or YPD. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 × g for 10 min), washed twice with ice-cold distilled water, and resuspended at 0.5 g (wet weight)/ml in 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.2 m NaCl, 0.125 m NaPO4, pH 7, 0.0125% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.125% SDS, and 0.03 m sodium deoxycholate) in a conical microfuge tube containing 1 g of glass beads (0.25–0.5-mm diameter). Cells were broken by vortexing in two 1-min intervals separated by 1 min on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 5000 × gmax in a Beckman Microfuge 18. The supernatant was saved and frozen at –80 °C until ready for use. Isolation of Mitochondrial and Cytosol Fractions—For the preparation of mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions, cells were grown to midexponential phase, harvested, and spheroplasted as described (24Allen L.A. Zhao X.J. Caughey W. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 110-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation (5 min at 3,000 × g), washed gently in post-spheroplast buffer (1.5 m sorbitol, 1 mm Na2EDTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7), and sedimented at 3,000 × g for 5 min. Washed spheroplasts were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.6 m mannitol, 2 mm Na2EDTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4), lysed in a Sorvall Omnimixer (Newton, CT) at low speed for 3 s and full speed for 45 s, and then centrifuged for 5 min at 1,900 × g to pellet unbroken cells, nuclei, and debris. The resulting supernatant was decanted and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,100 × g to pellet mitochondria. The mitochondrial pellet was washed by resuspension in mitochondrial lysis buffer minus bovine serum albumin (pH 7), homogenized with a glass/Teflon homogenizer, and centrifuged at 1,651 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was decanted and centrifuged at 23,500 × g for 10 min to pellet the mitochondria. The post-mitochondrial supernatant, collected after the 23,500 × g centrifugation, was used as the cytosolic fraction. Protein in the mitochondrial fractions from aerobically grown JM43 cells, anaerobically grown JM43 cells, aerobically grown JM43ρ0 cells, and aerobically grown JM43GD5ab cells accounts for 9.8, 9, 8.5, and 9.8%, respectively, of the combined protein in mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions. Subfractionation of Mitochondria—Mitochondrial subfractions were prepared by a modification of the digitonin fractionation procedure described (25Velours J. Guerin B. Duvert M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 182: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this procedure, freshly isolated mitochondria are converted to mitoplasts, during which the outer membrane and intermembrane space fractions are removed. The mitoplasts are then disrupted, and the inner membrane and matrix fractions are separated. To prepare mitoplasts, mitochondria were suspended at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml mitoplast suspension buffer (0.6 m mannitol and 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7), and a 1-ml portion of the suspension was treated for 1 min on ice with 0.35 mg of digitonin per milligram of mitochondrial protein. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The suspension was diluted immediately with 5 volumes of mitoplast suspension buffer and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × gmax. The pellet was the mitoplast fraction. The supernatant was carefully separated from the pellet and centrifuged for 60 min at 144,000 × gmax. The resulting pellet and the supernatant were used as the outer mitochondrial membrane and the intermembrane space fractions, respectively. The inner membrane and matrix fractions were prepared from the mitoplasts collected above as follows. Mitoplasts were resuspended at 10 mg of protein per milliliter in 100 mm NaPO4, pH 7, and sonicated for 20 s at 50 watts with a Branson Sonifier (Model W 185) equipped with a microtip. Sonicated mitoplasts were centrifuged for 20 min at 95,000 × gmax. The pellet was the inner membrane fraction, and the supernatant was the matrix fraction. The pellet was washed by resuspension in 100 mm NaPO4, pH 7, and recovered by centrifugation at 95,000 × gmax for 20 min. Partial Purification of Cytosolic YHb—A freshly isolated cytosolic fraction was subjected a series of ammonium sulfate fractionations, as modified from the work of Mok et al. (26Mok T.C. Rickard P.A. Moss F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 172: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, ammonium sulfate was added to 30% saturation, and the sample was incubated at 4 °C for 15 min with stirring and then centrifuged at 27,000 × gmax for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in 100 mm NaPO4, pH 7, and saved. The supernatant was adjusted to 45% ammonium sulfate, and the suspension was incubated at 4 °C for 15 min with stirring and then centrifuged at 27,000 × gmax for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in 100 mm NaPO4, pH 7, and saved. The supernatant was adjusted to 65% ammonium sulfate, and the suspension was incubated at 4 °C for 15 min with stirring and then centrifuged at 27,000 × gmax for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in 100 mm NaPO4, pH 7, and saved. The supernatant was adjusted to 95% saturation, incubated at 4 °C for 15 min with stirring, and then centrifuged at 27,000 × gmax for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in 100 mm NaPO4, pH 7, and saved. The remaining supernatant was saved. All pellets were resuspended to a volume of 3 ml per 100 ml of starting volume. All fractions were stored at 4 °C until spectra were recorded and then frozen at –70 °C for immunoblot analysis. Difference Spectroscopy—Whole cell suspensions were prepared for CO photolysis spectra as follows. A concentrated cell suspension (0.45 g (wet weight)/ml) was adjusted to 1% (w/v) glucose in a sealed small test tube and incubated without agitation for 5 min at room temperature to achieve anaerobiosis. The suspension of reduced cells was then adjusted to 30% ethylene glycol and bubbled with CO for 10 min prior to transfer to a cuvette. The cuvette was frozen in liquid nitrogen, and CO photolysis difference spectra on the frozen samples were recorded as described (16Waterland R.A. Basu A. Chance B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4180-4186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced CO-ligated difference spectra of cell fractions were recorded at room temperature as follows. Each cell fraction was reduced with sodium dithionite and a spectrum was recorded. Each fraction was then bubbled slowly with CO gas (99.5%) for 5 min. The visible/Soret spectra of the same sample were recorded before and after exposure to CO. The baseline spectrum, obtained from the difference between the two spectra of the same reduced sample, was subtracted from the reduced minus CO-ligated difference spectra. All spectra were recorded using an SLM AMINCO DW2000 dual wavelength scanning, UV light-visible spectrophotometer (SLM Instruments, Inc.) with the following settings: dual beam, wavelength acquisition, filter slow, 0.8-nm slit width, recording monochrometer (monochrometer 2) from 39 to 700 nm, and the reference monochromator (monochrometer 1) set to a wavelength of 577 nm. Preparation of Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies to YHb, PET100p, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV were prepared. For YHb, an antibody was obtained against a peptide synthesized to correspond to amino acid residues 379–397 (17Zhu H. Riggs A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5015-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); for PET100p, an antibody was obtained against a peptide synthesized to correspond to residues 95–111 (27Forsha D. Church C. Wazny P. Poyton R.O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 436-441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The peptides were synthesized with an amino-terminal cysteine and coupled through this cysteine to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemacyanin (KLH). The peptide-KLH conjugate was mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant, and 1 mg of conjugate was injected subcutaneously into New Zealand White rabbits. Booster injections (0.5 mg) were given with Freund's incomplete adjuvant at 2 and 8 weeks. Antiserum was collected at 2-week intervals, with the terminal collection at 12 days after the final boost. Antibodies to HPLC purified cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV were prepared as described (28Poyton R.O. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 762-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies to yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (and porin) were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Measurement of NO Consumption—NO consumption was measured using a Clark-type NO electrode (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). All measurements were done in triplicate in a water-jacketed chamber with stirring at 30 °C. The electrode was calibrated with a 50 μm solution of KNO2 to generate a series of known concentrations of NO (100, 200, and 400 nm) in 10 ml of a 0.1 m potassium iodide and 0.1 m H2SO4 solution. NO consumption of whole cell extracts or mitochondrial or cytosolic fractions was then measured in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (80 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mm NaH2PO4, and 100 mm NaCl), 250 μm NADH, and 0.1 mm EDTA after the addition of 2 μm NO from an NO-saturated solution of distilled water. Preparation of the NO-saturated solution was as described by the manufacturer of the NO electrode. Using a buffer control, it was possible to determine the amount of NO injected into the chamber as well as its stability in the absence of cell extract. Northern Blotting—For Northern analysis, RNA samples (30 μg) were separated on 1.5% agarose gels containing 0.22 m formaldehyde (29Tsang S.S. Yin X. Guzzo-Arkuran C. Jones V.S. Davison A.J. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 380-381PubMed Google Scholar), transferred to Schleicher & Schuell Nytran membranes, and hybridized according to the manufacturer's suggestions. DNA probes were prepared by random primer labeling of double-stranded DNA fragments using [α-32P]dCTP. Probes were a 600-bp SspI fragment for YHB1 and a 500-bp StyI fragment for ACT1. Blots were quantitated with an Ambis radio-analytic imaging system. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—SDS-PAGE was performed either on 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 10% glycerol and 3.6 m urea (24Allen L.A. Zhao X.J. Caughey W. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 110-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (30O'Brien K.M. Dirmeier R. Engle M. Poyton R.O. J. Biol.

Following electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose, and immunoblots were quantitated from multiple exposures using Kodak 1D image analysis software.Fig. 3YHb is present in both mitochondria and the cytosol. Panel A, immunoblot analysis of cell fractions from JM43. Cell fractions were isolated from strain JM43, solubilized in SDS, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (16% gels) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After SDS-PAGE, the gels were blotted to nitrocellulose and detected with anti-YHbC (top), an antibody to the inner mitochondrial membrane protein PET100p (middle), and an antibody to the cytosolic protein 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) (bottom).

Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the BCA assay (Pierce Biotechnology) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Expression of YHb in Rho+and Rho0 Cells—Previously, we have reported that the level of the reduced YHb CO photoproduct is low in respiration-proficient cells and increased in respiration-deficient mutants (16Waterland R.A. Basu A. Chance B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4180-4186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This can be seen in Fig. 1, which compares the CO photolysis difference spectra (CO-reduced minus reduced) of whole suspensions of JM43, a respiration-proficient rho+ strain, and its isochromosomal derivative, JM43ρ0, a respiratory-deficient rho0 strain. The major CO-liganded pigment in JM43 is cytochrome c oxidase. It absorption maxima are at 447 and 610 nm, and absorption minima are at 434 and 590 nm. In contrast, the main CO-liganded pigment in JM43ρ0 is YHb. Its absorption maxima are at 441, 557, and 590 nm, with the absorption minima at 423, 538, and 574 nm.

https://openalex.org/W1968555901,"The scaffolding protein receptor for activated C kinase (RACK1) has been proposed to mediate the integration of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) and adhesion signaling. Here we investigated the mechanism of this integration of signaling, by using an IGF-IR mutant (Y1250F/Y1251F) that is deficient in anti-apoptotic and transforming function. RACK1 was found to associate with the IGF-IR only in adherent cells and did not associate with the IGF-IR in nonadherent cells, lymphocytic cells, or cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant. In R– cells transiently expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant RACK1 became constitutively associated with β1 integrin and did not associate with Shc, Src, or Shp2. This was accompanied by the loss of formation of a complex containing the IGF-IR, RACK1, and β1 integrin; loss of migratory capacity; enhanced Src and FAK activity; enhanced Akt phosphorylation; and decreased p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. Shc was not phosphorylated in response to IGF-I in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant and remained associated with protein phosphatase 2A. Similar alterations in signaling were observed in cells that were stimulated with IGF-I in nonadherent cultures. Our data suggest that disruption of RACK1 scaffolding function in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant results in the loss of adhesion signals that are necessary to regulate Akt activity and to promote turnover of focal adhesions and cell migration. The scaffolding protein receptor for activated C kinase (RACK1) has been proposed to mediate the integration of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) and adhesion signaling. Here we investigated the mechanism of this integration of signaling, by using an IGF-IR mutant (Y1250F/Y1251F) that is deficient in anti-apoptotic and transforming function. RACK1 was found to associate with the IGF-IR only in adherent cells and did not associate with the IGF-IR in nonadherent cells, lymphocytic cells, or cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant. In R– cells transiently expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant RACK1 became constitutively associated with β1 integrin and did not associate with Shc, Src, or Shp2. This was accompanied by the loss of formation of a complex containing the IGF-IR, RACK1, and β1 integrin; loss of migratory capacity; enhanced Src and FAK activity; enhanced Akt phosphorylation; and decreased p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. Shc was not phosphorylated in response to IGF-I in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant and remained associated with protein phosphatase 2A. Similar alterations in signaling were observed in cells that were stimulated with IGF-I in nonadherent cultures. Our data suggest that disruption of RACK1 scaffolding function in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant results in the loss of adhesion signals that are necessary to regulate Akt activity and to promote turnover of focal adhesions and cell migration.

In addition, there is considerable evidence to indicate that the IGF-IR is an important contributor to the growth, survival, and migratory/invasive capacity of transformed cells and thereby to the spread of cancer (1Baserga R.

In smooth muscle cells, integrin ligation controls the availability of phosphatases that can negatively regulate IGF-I-mediated proliferation and cell movement. Integrin ligation causes the Shps-1 protein to recruit the tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2 to the cell membrane, where it dephosphorylates an active IGF-IR and attenuates signaling (18Maile L.A.

However, although there is abundant evidence for physical and functional links between IGF-IR and adhesion signaling, the mechanisms of interaction and integration of IGF-IR and adhesion signals are not well understood. One way in which these signals could be integrated is through the actions of the WD repeat scaffolding protein RACK1 (Ref. 20Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc.

Overexpression of RACK1 in MCF-7 cells promotes proliferation and MAPK activation, whereas it suppresses protection from apoptosis and Akt phosphorylation (22Kiely P.A. Sant A. O'Connor R. J. Biol.

An IGF-IR mutant that has tyrosines 1250 and 1251 mutated to phenylalanine (Y1250F/Y1251F) has been shown to be deficient in cytoskeletal organization (24Blakesley V.A. Koval A.P. Stannard B.S.

Zhang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33608-33615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that when this mutant is expressed in FL5.12 lymphocytic cells, IGF-I-mediated phosphorylation of Shc, Ras activation, and MAPK activation are all decreased (26Leahy M. Lyons A. Krause D. O'Connor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18306-18313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that IGF-I-mediated activation of the Shc, Ras, and MAPK pathways have a particular role in the transforming and migratory functions of the IGF-IR. Although Shc phosphorylation is implicated in integrin signaling leading to activation of MAPK (27Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 28Barberis L. Wary K.K. Fiucci G. Liu F. Hirsch E. Brancaccio M. Altruda F. Tarone G. Giancotti F.G. J.

The potential for RACK1 scaffolding function in regulating Shc signaling from integrins has also not been investigated. All of this prompted us to investigate RACK1 scaffolding function and Shc activity in IGF-I-mediated signaling in adherent cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant IGF-IR. We found that RACK1 does not associate with the IGF-IR in fibroblasts or MCF-7 cells when the cells were not attached to a substratum. RACK1 did not associate with the IGF-IR in FL5.12 cells or with the Y1250F/Y1251F IGF-IR mutant when expressed in adherent cells. Complexes of the IGF-IR and β1 integrins with RACK1 were not detected with this mutant, and the cells were completely deficient in migration toward IGF-I compared with R– cells expressing WT IGF-IR. IGF-I did not induce phosphorylation of Shc or its dissociation from PP2A in cells expressing the mutant IGF-IR. Src and Shp2 were associated with RACK1 in R– cells expressing WT IGF-IR, but not in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant. Lack of Src sequestration was accompanied by a dramatic increase in Src kinase activity. FAK and Akt were both hyperphosphorylated in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant, but phosphorylation of p38 was decreased. Similar IGF-I-mediated signaling responses were observed in cells that were stimulated in nonadherent cultures. Altogether the data demonstrate that the lack of RACK1-mediated integration of adhesion and IGF-IR signaling that is necessary for cell migration is deficient in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant.

Cell Culture, Transfection, and IGF-I Stimulation—The MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line, the R– cell line (mouse embryo fibroblast cell line derived from the IGF-IR knock-out mouse) (29Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), and R+ cells (R– cells that were retransfected with the IGF-Ir cDNA) (29Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), were all maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Biowhittaker, Verviers, Belgium), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-Glu, and penicillin/streptomycin. R– cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 IGF-IR WT, IGF-IR Y1250F/Y1251F, or empty pcDNA3 vectors (8 μg of DNA) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as described previously (22Kiely P.A. Sant A. O'Connor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22581-22589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). After 18 h in culture the transfected cells were split into 6-well plates or 10-cm plates and cultured for an additional 18 h. FL5.12 cells that overexpress the wild type (FL5.12/WT) IGF-IR have been described previously (25O'Connor R. Kauffmann-Zeh A. Liu Y. Lehar S. Evan G.I. Baserga R. Ble ̀attler W.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in Iscove's modified defined medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (all from Biowhittaker, Verviers, Belgium) and 10% (v/v) conditioned medium from the interleukin 3-producing cell line WEHI-3B. For analysis of signaling responses in adherent cells, the cells were washed extensively with PBS and starved from serum for 4 h before stimulating with IGF-I for the indicated times. For analysis of signaling responses in detached cells, confluent MCF-7 or R+ cells or HeLa cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen), which was then removed by washing the cells with PBS. The cells were resuspended in serum-free media and kept in suspension for 4 h until stimulated with IGF-I for the indicated times. Preparation of Cellular Protein Extracts and Immunoprecipitation— Cellular protein extracts were prepared by washing cells with PBS and then scraping into lysis buffer consisting of Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 plus the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor Na3VO4 (1 mm), and the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), pepstatin (1 μm), and aprotinin (1.5 μg/ml). After incubation at 4 °C for 20 min, nuclear and cellular debris were removed by microcentrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous or transfected IGF-IR, β1 integrins, Shc Src, or IRS-2, protein extracts from stimulated or unstimulated cells were initially precleared by incubation with bovine serum albumin-coated protein G-agarose beads (15 μl of beads/500 μgof total protein in 700 μl of lysis buffer) at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rocking. The lysates were recovered from the beads by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 3 min and transferred to fresh tubes for incubation with primary antibody (3 μg of each antibody) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Immune complexes were obtained by adding 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads and incubating for a further 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and then the immune complexes were removed from the beads for electrophoresis and Western blot analysis by boiling for 5 min in 20 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For RACK1 immunoprecipitation, 700 μg of protein was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-RACK1 IgM antibodies, 5 μg of goat anti-mouse IgM Fab fragment, 30 μg of protein G-agarose, 500 μl of IP buffer (1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, plus the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor Na3VO4 (1 mm)), and the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), pepstatin (1 μm), and aprotinin (1.5 μg/ml). Immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and the protein was recovered from the beads by boiling for 5 min in 20 μlof2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Western Blot Analysis—All of the protein samples for Western blot analysis were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gradient gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% milk (w/v). All of the primary antibody incubations were overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibody incubations were carried out at room temperature for 1 h. Secondary antibodies were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and were used for detection with enhanced chemiluminescence (Super Signal from Pierce or ECL+ from Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Where indicated, the membranes were stripped by incubation in 62.5 mm Tris-Cl, 1% SDS, and 0.7% β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C followed by extensive washing in 0.2 and 0.05% TBS-T. Migration Assays in Boyden Chambers—Transwell assays (modified Boyden chambers) were performed using 6.5-mm transwell filter inserts with 5.0 μm inserts (CoStar, Cambridge, MA). Cells (at or near confluence) were trypsinized and cultured in fresh media 18 h prior to each assay. The cells were serum-starved for 4 h, harvested, washed twice, and then resuspended in serum-free DMEM. The final cell density was determined using a hemocytometer. The lower wells of the Boyden chamber apparatus were loaded with serum-free DMEM supplemented with 10 ng/ml IGF-I (final concentration), 50 ng/ml EGF or serum-free DMEM alone as a control. A 50-μl volume of cell suspension containing 50,000 cells was added to each upper well. The loaded chamber was placed in a 37 °C incubator enriched with 5% CO2. After 4 h, the chamber was removed from the incubator and disassembled. The cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed by scraping so that only cells that had migrated through the membrane remained. The membrane was then fixed with methanol, stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and air-dried. Cell counts were obtained by counting all cells, and the data are presented as the averages of counts from five fields each of triplicate wells for each test condition. Assay to Measure Adhesion to Fibronectin—R– cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 IGF-IR WT, IGF-IR Y1250F/Y1251F, or empty pcDNA3 vectors as described above. The cells were washed and serum-starved for 4 h before removal from plates with trypsin. The wells of a 96-well plate were coated with 100 μl of fibronectin (5 μg/ml) for 2 h, and control wells were coated with bovine serum albumin (2.5% in H2O). The plates were washed extensively with PBS and blocked with 100 μl of 2.5% bovine serum albumin/well for 1 h before further washing with PBS. Cells (100 μl containing 2 × 104 cells) were added to each coated well in triplicate and allowed to attach for the indicated times. The medium was removed, the wells were washed with serum-free medium, and attached cells were fixed with Methanol. Crystal Violet was then added, and the cells were destained by extensive washing in H2O and allowed to air dry overnight. Cellular protein was extracted by the addition of Triton X-100 (0.5%) overnight at room temperature, and absorbance for each well was read at 595 nm. The data are presented as the means and standard deviation of absorbance in triplicate wells. In Vitro Kinase Assays to Determine Src Activity—R– cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3 IGF-IR WT, IGF-IR Y1250F/Y1251F, or empty pcDNA3 vectors were lysed as described above. c-Src was immunoprecipitated using anti-Src antibodies and protein G-agarose beads as described. The immune complexes were resuspended in 15 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm McCl2) with 1 μl [32P]ATP (10 μCi/μl), 0.3 μl of 100 μm cold ATP, with or without 5 μg of acid-denatured enolase (Sigma), and the reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 3 min. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold kinase buffer, and the protein was then removed from the beads by boiling for 5 min in 20 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer for electrophoresis. Dried gels were then assessed for incorporated radioactivity by using a phosphorus imager. Association of RACK1 with the IGF-IR Is Dependent on Cell Adhesion—The regulatory adapter protein RACK1 has previously been shown to associate with the IGF-IR in a ligand-independent manner in fibroblasts and MCF-7 cells (22Kiely P.A. Sant A. O'Connor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22581-22589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). When R+ cells were stimulated with IGF-I for up to 60 min, the amount of RACK1 that co-precipitated with the IGF-IR remained constant regardless of the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-IR (Fig. 1A). Hermanto et al. (23Hermanto U. Zong C.S. Li W. Wang L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2345-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) demonstrated that RACK1 associates with β1 integrin in response to IGF-I stimulation. We therefore asked whether adhesion regulates association of RACK1 with the IGF-IR. The IGF-IR was immunoprecipitated from either R+ cells or MCF-7 cells that were maintained in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum either while attached to tissue culture plates, or alternatively, after removal from plates and culture in suspension for 4 h. The immunoprecipitates were assessed for associated RACK1. As can be seen in Fig. 1B RACK1 was associated with the IGF-IR in R+ cells and MCF-7 cells only under adherent conditions but did not associate when the cells were maintained in suspension (Fig. 1B). This indicates that adhesion is required for association of RACK1 with the IGF-IR. To further investigate the requirement for adhesion signals for the association of RACK1 with the IGF-IR, we tested interleukin 3-dependent murine B-lymphocytic FL5.12 cells, which grow in suspension and thus are not dependent on adhesion for viability or growth. Although FL5.12 cells express high levels of RACK1, no co-immunoprecipitation with the IGF-IR was observed (Fig. 1C). In addition, treatment of FL5.12 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to activate protein C kinases did not promote association of RACK1 with the IGF-IR. Together with the data from R+ and MCF-7 cells, this suggests that association of RACK1 with the IGF-IR requires adhesion signals, and this does not occur in lymphoid cells. The data also suggest that RACK1 associates with the IGF-IR as a consequence of adhesion. Hermanto et al. (23Hermanto U. Zong C.S. Li W. Wang L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2345-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) showed that both RACK1 and the IGF-IR became associated with β1 integrin in response to stimulation of cells with either IGF-I or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Here we investigated the necessity for adhesion for association of RACK1 with β1 integrin in MCF-7 cells. In adherent MCF-7 cells RACK1 was not associated with β1 integrin in the absence of IGF-I, but IGF-I induced recruitment of RACK1 to β1 integrin. In contrast, when MCF-7 cells were detached, RACK1 was constitutively associated with β1 integrin in the absence of IGF-I. The amount of IGF-IR-associated RACK1 in detached cells was similar to that detected in cells that were stimulated with IGF-I for 10 min (Fig. 1D). Recruitment of RACK1 to β1 integrin appeared to occur in a biphasic pattern with higher levels of RACK1 detected at 20 min of IGF-I stimulation than at 10 min in both adherent and suspension cultures of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1D). The data indicate that adhesion regulates association of RACK1 with the IGF-IR and its dissociation from β1 integrin and support the idea that RACK1 mediates adhesion-dependent regulation of IGF-IR signaling. RACK1 Does Not Associate with the Y1250F/Y1251F Mutant IGF-IR—We previously demonstrated that overexpression of RACK1 in the MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line suppressed IGF-I-mediated survival and phosphorylation of Akt, while enhancing proliferation and Erk phosphorylation. We were therefore interested to determine whether RACK1 function was altered in cells expressing a mutant of the IGF-IR (Y1250F/Y1251F) that has previously been found to be deficient in promoting cellular transformation, survival, metastatic tumor growth, and cytoskeletal organization (5Hongo A.

We first investigated whether RACK1 associated with the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant IGF-IR by immunoprecipitating WT or Y1250F/Y1251F mutant IGF-IR that was transiently transfected into R– cells. As can be seen in Fig. 2A, there was no RACK1 associated with the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant either in the absence or the presence of IGF-I. We also measured the ability of RACK1 to interact with β1 integrin in cells expressing the WT or Y1250F/Y1251F mutant (Fig. 2B). This demonstrated that although RACK1 was recruited to β1 integrin in response to IGF-I in a biphasic pattern, it was constitutively associated with RACK1 in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant but still exhibited increased recruitment at 20 min. This pattern is very similar to that observed with nonadherent cells in Fig. 1D and suggests that cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant respond to IGF-I as if they lack an adhesion signal. We next investigated whether a complex between the IGF-IR, RACK1, and β1 integrin may be altered in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant. In cells expressing WT IGF-IR, the IGF-IR was detected in β1 integrin immunoprecipitates from IGF-I-stimulated cells (Fig. 2C). However, in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant, there was no detectable IGF-IR in the β1 integrin complex, although RACK1 was still associated with β1 integrin (Fig. 2C). Thus, an IGF-I-mediated complex containing the IGF-IR, RACK1, and β1 integrin that forms in cells expressing WT IGF-IR cannot be detected in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant. This may explain why cells expressing this mutant lack adhesion signaling. Cells Expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F Mutant Are Deficient in Migration toward IGF-I and Adhere More Rapidly than Cells Expressing WT IGF-IR—Although the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant is well characterized in terms of its lack of function in suppressing apoptosis when stably expressed in R– cells, FL5.12 cells, and tumor cell lines, its function upon transient expression in R– cells has not been analyzed. We therefore investigated the migratory capacity of cells expressing either the WT or Y1250F/Y1251F mutant in modified Boyden chamber assays compared with mock transfected vector cells. This demonstrated that although the vector-transfected cells exhibited no migration toward IGF-I, cells expressing the WT IGF-IR had greatly increased migration. However, cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F receptor exhibited no migration (Fig. 3A). This indicates that in R– cells the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant cannot promote IGF-I-mediated chemotaxis. We also investigated the ability of these cells to attach to fibronectin (Fig. 3B). R– cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1"
https://openalex.org/W1992296477,"Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) plays an important role in regulating cellular transformation and apoptosis. The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I protein, Tax, which is critical for viral transformation, modulates the transcription of several cellular genes through activation of NF-κB. We have demonstrated previously that Tax inhibits p53 activity through the p65/RelA subunit of NF-κB. We now present evidence that suggests that the upstream kinase IKKβ plays an important role in Tax-induced p53 inhibition through phosphorylation of p65/RelA at Ser-536. First, mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) IKKβ–/–cells did not support Tax-mediated p53 inhibition, whereas MEFs lacking IKKα allowed Tax inhibition of p53. Second, transfection of IKKβ wild type (WT), but not a kinase-dead mutant, into IKKβ–/–cells rescued p53 inhibition by Tax. Third, the IKKβ-specific inhibitor SC-514 decreased the ability of Tax to inhibit p53. Fourth, we show that phosphorylation of p65/RelA at Ser-536 is important for Tax inhibition of p53 using MEF p65/RelA–/–cells transfected with p65/RelA WT or mutant plasmids. Moreover, Tax induced p65/RelA Ser-536 phosphorylation in WT or IKKα–/– cells but failed to induce the phosphorylation of p65/RelA Ser-536 in IKKβ–/–cells, suggesting a link between IKKβ and p65/RelA phosphorylation. Consistent with this observation, blocking IKKβ kinase activity by SC-514 decreases the phosphorylation of p65/RelA at Ser-536 in the presence of Tax in human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I-transformed cells. Finally, the ability of Tax to inhibit p53 is distinguished from the NF-κB transcription activation pathway. Our work, therefore, describes a novel Tax-NF-κB p65/RelA pathway that functions to inhibit p53 but does not require NF-κB transcription activity.

Ophthalmol. 1989; 73: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). HTLV-I encodes a 40-kDa protein, Tax, which plays a key role in viral replication, transformation, and gene regulation. Tax not only activates expression of viral genes via the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) but has also been reported to regulate the expression of a number of cellular genes that encode proteins involved in cell growth and apoptosis (5Ijichi S. Matsuda T. Maruyama I. Izumihara T. Kojima K. Niimura T. Maruyama Y. Sonoda S. Yoshida A. Osame M. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1990; 49: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8Hollsberg P.

Methods. 1998; 16: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Several of these genes are regulated by the transcription factor NF-κB (nuclear factor κB). Indeed, the ability of Tax to activate the NF-κB pathway is critical for T-cell immortalization and factor-independent growth (11Robek M.D. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4856-4865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Iwanaga Y. Tsukahara T. Ohashi T. Tanaka Y. Arai M. Nakamura M. Ohtani K. Koya Y. Kannagi M. Yamamoto N. Fujii M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1271-1277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB is a member of the Rel family of proteins, which includes p50, p65/RelA, c-Rel, p52, and RelB. In most cells, NF-κB is present in the cytoplasm in an inactive form through association with IκB family members (13Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 14Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Activators mediate a rapid phosphorylation of IκB by IκB kinase (IKK), which results in subsequent ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation. NF-κB is then transported to the nucleus, where it activates transcription of target genes through binding to NF-κB target sequences within the promoter. HTLV-I Tax can induce constitutive NF-κB activation through phosphorylation of both IκBα and IκBβ (15McKinsey T.A. Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. Al Murrani S.W. Green P.L. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been further demonstrated that IKKγ plays an essential role for Tax mediation of NF-κB activation (16Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol.

Interaction of Tax with IKKγ facilitates its recruitment to the IKKα/IKKβ complex, inducing kinase activation (19Sun S.C. Harhaj E.W. Xiao G. Good L. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 1591-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Several reports have suggested that phosphorylation of p65/RelA is required for efficient transcriptional activation (20Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The sites of phosphorylation and its effect on transcription are, however, complex. For example, Ser-276, situated in the Rel homology domain, can be phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A as well as by mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 in response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or lipopolysaccharide (21Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar, 22Vermeulen L. De Wilde G. Van Damme P. Vanden Berghe W. Haegeman G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ser-529 or Ser-536, located in the transactivation domain, can be phosphorylated by casein kinase II in response to TNF or interleukin-1 (23Wang D. Westerheide S.D. Hanson J.L.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that Tax inhibits p53 transcriptional activity through the NF-κB signaling pathway, specifically the p65/RelA subunit (27Pise-Masison C.A. Mahieux R. Jiang H. Ashcroft M. Radonovich M. Duvall J. Guillerm C. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3377-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Jeong S.J. Radonovich M. Brady J.N. Pise-Masison C.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 190-1497Crossref Google Scholar). Tax induces the p65/RelA subunit of NF-κB to interact with p53, which is stably associated with the transcriptional complex in vivo (28Jeong S.J. Radonovich M. Brady J.N. Pise-Masison C.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 190-1497Crossref Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that the inhibition of p53 activity is dependent upon phosphorylation of p65/RelA at Ser-536 by the upstream kinase IKKβ. Of interest, inhibition of p53 activity does not require NF-κB transcriptional activity. Our work, therefore, describes a novel Tax-NF-κB p65/RelA pathway that inhibits p53 but does not require NF-κB transcriptional activity. Cell Lines and Transfections—HTLV-I-transformed C81 cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. MEF WT, p65/RelA–/–, IKKα–/–, and IKKβ–/–cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. MEF WT and p65/RelA–/–cells were described previously. MEF IKKα–/– and IKKβ–/–cells were kindly provided by Dr. Warner Greene (University of California, San Francisco). 293T cells and MEFs were transfected using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) and Lipofectamine Plus transfection reagent (Invitrogen), respectively, as described by the manufacturer. Plasmids and Luciferase Assays—The reporter constructs MDM2-Luc, 4× NF-κB-Luc, HTLV-I LTR-Luc, and the Tax expression plasmid (pcTax) have been described previously (see Ref. 27Pise-Masison C.A. Mahieux R. Jiang H. Ashcroft M. Radonovich M. Duvall J. Guillerm C. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3377-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Flag-p65/RelA WT and mutants S529A and S536A were provided by Dr. Albert Baldwin, Jr. (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). IKKβ WT and the kinase-dead (KD) mutant were provided by Dr. Michael Karin (University of California, San Diego). For luciferase assays, cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection following the Promega dual luciferase and Tropix GalactoLight assay kit instructions. Cells were treated with the IKKβ-specific inhibitor SC-514 (Calbiochem) for 1 h before transfection. All transfections included the control plasmid RSV β-galactosidase to control for transfection efficiency. Western Blot Analysis—Cell extracts were prepared by using lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 120 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet-P40, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.2 mm sodium vanadate). The extracts were incubated on ice for 15 min, centrifuged (10,000 × g) at 4 °C for 10 min, and supernatants were collected. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and 50–100 μg was separated by electrophoresis on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Novex). The proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon) and analyzed with the desired antibodies. Anti-p65/RelA and p53 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology and Oncogene Research Products, respectively. Anti-phospho-p65/RelA (Ser-536) and phospho-IKKα/β (Ser-180/Ser-181) were purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti-IKKα (M-280), IKKα/β (H-470) and actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-IκBα was purchased from Active Motif. To detect the expression of Tax protein, anti-Tab172 monoclonal antibody was used. In Vitro IKK Kinase Assay—For immunoprecipitation kinase assay, IKK complexes from the cytoplasm were precipitated with anti-IKKβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by treatment with 10 ml of Dynal beads-protein G (Dynal Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm ATP, 20 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 20 mm disodium p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). IKKβ, but Not IKKα, Is Important for Tax-mediated p53 Inhibition—We demonstrated previously that Tax inhibition of p53 activity is dependent upon the phosphorylation of IκBα by overexpression of a phosphorylation mutant of IκBα, which inhibits NF-κB activation in a dominant-negative manner (27Pise-Masison C.A. Mahieux R. Jiang H. Ashcroft M. Radonovich M. Duvall J. Guillerm C. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3377-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Jeong S.J. Radonovich M. Brady J.N. Pise-Masison C.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 190-1497Crossref Google Scholar). Because Tax activates NF-κB through the IKK complex and IKKs phosphorylate IκBα and p65/RelA to activate NF-κB (19Sun S.C. Harhaj E.W. Xiao G. Good L. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 1591-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Li X.H. Murphy K.M. Palka K.T. Surabhi R.M. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 18137-18145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we investigated the role of IKKα and IKK-β in Tax-mediated NF-κB p53 inhibition. WT, IKKα–/–, or IKKβ–/–MEFs were transiently transfected with the p53-responsive MDM2-Luc or the NF-κB-responsive-4× NF-κB-Luc reporter constructs in the absence or presence of Tax (Fig. 1). The results of these studies demonstrated that Tax inhibited p53 activity in WT and IKKα–/– cells but failed to inhibit p53 transcriptional activity in the IKKβ–/–cells (Fig. 1A). In both WT and IKKα–/– cells, Tax inhibited p53 activity by 75–80%. In parallel assays, we measured the importance of IKKα and IKKβ in Tax-mediated NF-κB activation. NF-κB transcriptional activity was significantly increased by Tax transfection in WT cells (Fig. 1B, compare lane 1 and 2). In WT MEFs, Tax increased NF-κB promoter activity 4–5-fold. In contrast, Tax failed to activate NF-κB activity in either IKKα–/– or IKKβ–/–cells. The fact that p53 inhibition but not NF-κB activity is observed in the IKKα–/– cells suggests that NF-κB transcription activity is not required for p53 inhibition. To further test this hypothesis, the NF-κB-responsive human immunodeficiency virus LTR-β-galactosidase reporter was transfected into IKKα–/– cells in the absence or presence of a Tax expression plasmid. Consistent with the results obtained with the 4× NF-κB reporter, Tax was not able to activate NF-κB transcription activity in the IKKα–/– cells (data not shown). Western blot analysis demonstrated that the levels of IKKα, IKKβ, and Tax expression were equivalent in the transfected cells (Fig. 1C). Western blot analysis further confirmed the lack of expression of IKKα in IKKα–/– cells and IKKβ in IKKβ–/– cells, respectively. To verify the importance of IKKβ in p53 inhibition, IKKβ WT or KD expression vectors were transfected into IKKβ–/– MEF in the absence or presence of Tax (Fig. 2). 24 h post-transfection, cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activities were measured. Transfection of IKKβ WT but not KD rescued the p53 inhibition by Tax (Fig. 2A). As expected, 4× NF-κB-Luc activity was strongly activated by Tax with IKKβ WT but not with the KD mutant (Fig. 2B, lane 4, compare with lane 6). In contrast, transfection of IKKβ WT or KD had little effect on Tax transactivation of the cAMP-response element-binding protein-responsive HTLV-I LTR-Luc (Fig. 2C). Western blot analysis of Tax, IKKβ, and p53 demonstrated that the proteins were expressed at roughly equivalent levels (Fig. 2D). Together, these data suggest that IKKβ kinase activity is important for p53 inhibition by Tax. From studies recently published by O'Mahony et al. (30O'Mahony A.M. Montano M. Van Beneden K. Chen L.F. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18137-18145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and Gregory et al. (31Gregory D. Hargett D. Holmes D. Money E. Bachenheimer S.L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13582-13590Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), in IKKα –/– cells like WT MEFs, p65 is predominantly cytoplasmic. Upon NF-κB stimulation, IκBα is phosphorylated and degraded with a concomitant increase in nuclear p65. p65 nuclear levels are, however, reduced in IKKα–/– compared with wild type cells. These results suggest that although somewhat impaired, the normal upstream signaling and release of p65 is intact in IKKα–/– cells. The defect in NF-κB-responsive promoter activity appears to be at the level of p65 transcriptional activation, perhaps through p65 modification or modification of histones (32Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 33Anest V. Hanson J.L. Cogswell P.C. Steinbrecher K.A. Strahl B.D. Baldwin A.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). IKKβ-specific Inhibitor SC-514 Blocks p53 Inhibition Pathway—To further test this hypothesis, we utilized the IKKβ-specific inhibitor SC-514, which does not inhibit IKKα or other serine-threonine and tyrosine kinases (34Kishore N. Sommers C. Mathialagan S. Guzova J. Yao M. Hauser S. Huynh K. Bonar S. Mielke C. Albee L. Weier R. Graneto M. Hanau C. Perry T. Tripp C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32861-32871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). p65/RelA–/– cells were treated with SC-514 1 h prior to transfection. p65/RelA and Tax plasmid DNAs were transfected with either MDM2-Luc, 4× NF-κB-Luc, or HTLV-I LTR-Luc; cells were maintained for 24 h, and luciferase activities were determined. In the presence of Tax and p65/RelA, p53 activity was inhibited (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–4). SC-514 treatment increased p53 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of Tax (Fig. 3A, lanes 4, 6, 8, and 10). In the absence of p65/RelA, p53 activity was not changed by SC-514 with or without Tax (data not shown). As further controls for this experiment, we checked the effect of SC-514 on NF-κB activity. As expected, 4× NF-κB-Luc activity was decreased by SC-514 (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, SC-514 appeared to inhibit NF-κB activity more efficiently in the presence of Tax (Fig. 3B). Reporter gene activity from the HTLV-I LTR-Luc construct, which is regulated through cAMP-response element-binding protein, was not significantly influenced by SC-514 in the absence or presence of Tax (Fig. 3C). Western blot analysis showed that the levels of IKKα/β, Tax, p65/RelA, and p53 were not changed in response to SC-514 treatment (Fig. 3D). The level of phospho-IKKα/β was decreased by SC-514 in a concentration-dependent manner. This decrease must be due to inhibition of IKKβ autophosphorylation and/or phosphorylation of IKKα by IKKβ (35Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results indicate that IKKβ kinase activity is a key factor for Tax-mediated p53 inhibition. IKKβ Induces Phosphorylation of p65/RelA in the Presence of Tax in Vitro—Because p65/RelA was found to be critical for p53 inhibition and IKK has been reported as an upstream kinase, which phosphorylates NF-κB p65/RelA (36Yang F. Tang E. Guan K. Wang C.Y. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5630-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 37Haller D. Russo M.P. Sartor R.B. Jobin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38168-38178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), we tested whether IKKβ activity is linked to phosphorylation of p65/RelA in HTLV-I-transformed cells. In vitro kinase assays were performed with immunoprecipitates from C81 cells following treatment with or without SC-514. Cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with the anti-IKKβ antibody. Kinase activity was assayed using His6-p65/RelA or glutathione S-transferase-IκBα, which served as a control substrate in those assays. SC-514 treatment reduced phosphorylation of both p65/RelA and IκBα (Fig. 4A). GelCode staining of the gels demonstrated that comparable amounts of p65/RelA or IκBα were present in the reactions (Fig. 4B). Western blot analysis showed that the level of IKKβ was not significantly changed by SC-514 treatment (Fig. 4C, top panel). Consistent with the results of the in vitro kinase assay, we observed that the level of phospho-IKKβ was reduced in C81 cells treated with SC-514 (Fig. 4C, bottom panel). It is important to note that in the C81 cells, we refer only to IKKβ. We have done Western blots on HTLV-I-transformed C81 cell extracts with antibody specific for IKKα and IKKβ. Consistent with the results reported from Yamaoka's laboratory (38Hironaka N. Mochida K. Mori N. Maeda M. Yamamoto N. Yamaoka S. Neoplasia. 2004; 6: 266-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IKKβ but not IKKα was detected in these cells. Thus, although we saw both IKKα and IKKβ in the MEF cells, in the C81 cells primarily IKKβ was detected. Together, these results suggest that IKKβ can phosphorylate p65/RelA as well as IκBα in HTLV-I-transformed cells. Tax Induces Phosphorylation of p65/RelA at Ser-536 in HTLV-I-transformed Cells—Next, we tested whether IKKβ phosphorylates p65/RelA at Ser-536 (25Bird T.A. Schooley K. Dower S.K. Hagen H. Virca G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32606-32612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 39Sakurai H. Suzuki S. Kawasaki N. Nakano H. Okazaki T. Chino A. Doi T. Saiki I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36916-36923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). C81 cells were treated with SC-514 to block IKKβ activity. Subsequently, the level of phospho-p65/RelA Ser-536 was analyzed by Western blot. The results of these studies demonstrate that the level of phospho-p65/RelA was decreased by SC-514 treatment (Fig. 5A, top panel). The decrease in p65/RelA phosphorylation was not due to p65/RelA degradation because the level of p65/RelA remained constant (Fig. 5A, second panel). These results suggest that IKKβ mediates the phosphorylation of p65/RelA at Ser-536 in HTLV-I-transformed cells. As a control, we showed the inhibition of phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα by SC-514 treatment. At 3 and 9 h post-treatment with SC-514, there was a significant decrease in p-IκBα and an overall increase in the level of IκBα. Unexpectedly, at 18 h post-treatment the levels of IκBα phosphorylation had returned to their original levels. The difference in the kinetics indicates that the turnover of phosphorylated p65 is slower than that of IκBα. Because IKKβ kinase activity is inhibited at 18 h post-treatment (Fig. 4A), the reappearance of phosphorylated IκBα suggests that other kinases substitute for IKKβ and phosphorylate IκBα. A more compelling argument for IKKβ phosphorylation of p65/RelA in the presence of Tax came from studies in which WT, IKKα–/–, or IKKβ–/– cells were transfected with increasing amounts of Tax for 48 h and cell lysates were prepared. Western blot analysis was performed with antibodies specific for phospho-p65/RelA Ser-536, p65/RelA, Tax, and IKKα/β (Fig. 5B). In WT or IKKα–/– MEFs, Tax expression increased the level of phospho-p65/RelA. In contrast, Tax failed to induce phosphorylation of p65/RelA at Ser-536 in IKKβ–/– MEF cells. These results indicate that IKKβ is essential for Tax-induced p65/RelA Ser-536 phosphorylation. The anti-IKKα/β antibody used in this experiment predominantly reacts with IKKβ and is partially cross-reactive with IKKα. Thus, we could detect IKK in WT and IKKα–/– but not in the IKKβ–/– cells. Tax-mediated p53 Inhibition Requires p65/RelA Phosphorylation at Ser-536 —Given the importance of IKKβ and its ability to phosphorylate p65/RelA, it was interesting to determine whether phosphorylation of p65/RelA plays a role in Tax-mediated p53 inhibition. MEF p65/RelA–/– cells were transfected with p65/RelA WT or the serine to alanine mutants S529A or S536A in the absence or presence of Tax and MDM2-Luc or 4× NF-κB-Luc reporter constructs (Fig. 6). Cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection, and luciferase activities were measured. Tax induced p53 inhibition in the presence of p65/RelA WT or S529A (Fig. 6A, lanes 4 and 6). In contrast, Tax failed to inhibit p53 in the presence of p65/RelA S536A (Fig. 6A, lane 8), suggesting that p65/RelA phosphorylation at Ser-536 is required for Tax-mediated p53 inhibition. The activity of the p65/RelA mutants was also measured using the NF-κB-responsive reporter. The ability of S536A to activate transcription was impaired in the absence or presence of Tax. In contrast, mutant S529A activity was similar to the WT p65/RelA protein (Fig. 6B). Western blot analysis was performed to detect the expression of Tax and p65/RelA (Fig. 6C). p65/RelA WT, S529A, and S536A were expressed at approximately equal levels. Tax expression was roughly equivalent in each of the transfections. To explore whether Tax regulates p65/RelA phosphorylation at Ser-536, cells were transfected with increasing amounts of Tax. 48 h post-transfection, cell lysates were prepared, and Western blot membranes were analyzed for anti-phospho p65/RelA Ser-536. The results demonstrated that Tax increases the phosphorylation of p65/RelA at Ser-536 (Fig. 6D). The increase in IκBα phosphorylation (Fig. 6D) is consistent with published studies (40Yin M.J.

Petropoulos L. Pepin N. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 564-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and demonstrates Tax activation of the NF-κB pathway. NF-κB is a key cellular transcription factor, which is activated by a variety of stimuli including TNF, lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1, and γ-irradiation. In the classical activation cascade, the IKK complex, which is composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ (also known as NEMO), is phosphorylated by upstream kinases NF-κB-inducible kinase (42Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar, 43Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This allows NF-κB heterodimers, primarily p50/p65, to translocate to the nucleus where they stimulate expression of target genes (48Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 49Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). In an alternative pathway, IKKα is activated and phosphorylates p100, stimulating processing of the p52 precursor (50Xiao G. Cvijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.C.

We and others have reported previously that NF-κB is critical for Tax-mediated p53 inhibition (27Pise-Masison C.A. Mahieux R. Jiang H. Ashcroft M. Radonovich M. Duvall J. Guillerm C. Brady J.N. Mol.

Virol. 2001; 75: 2185-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that the p65/RelA subunit of NF-κB specifically functions in the inhibition of p53 by Tax (28Jeong S.J. Radonovich M. Brady J.N. Pise-Masison C.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 190-1497Crossref Google Scholar). In this study, we tested whether the IKK complex, which has been shown to regulate p65/RelA (26Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 36Yang F. Tang E. Guan K. Wang C.Y. J.

Immunol. 2004; 172: 6336-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), plays a role in this pathway. Transient transfections were performed with WT, IKKα–/–, or IKKβ–/– MEFs. We found that Tax failed to inhibit p53 transcriptional activity in IKKβ–/– cells. Overexpression of IKKβ WT, but not KD, rescued Tax-induced p53 inhibition in the IKKβ–/– cells. Further, we showed that treatment with the IKKβ-specific inhibitor SC-514 prevented the inhibition of p53 by Tax. Finally, we investigated whether the phosphorylation of p65/RelA is involved in the regulation of the Tax-induced p53 inhibition pathway. Unlike WT, transfection of the p65/RelA mutant S536A into p65/RelA–/– cells failed to reconstitute Tax inhibition of p53. It was important to verify whether IKKβ and phosphorylation of p65/RelA at Ser-536 are linked in the pathway to regulate Tax inhibition of p53. Using in vitro kinase assays, we found that C81 cells showed strong IKK kinase activity for both p65/RelA and IκBα. The kinase activity was blocked by SC-514, an IKKβ-specific inhibitor, suggesting that the phosphorylation of p65/RelA as well as that of IκBα depends on IKKβ. Accordingly, SC-514 significantly decreased the level of phospho-p65/RelA Ser-536 in C81 cells. Furthermore, Tax transfection into IKKβ–/– cells failed to induce the phosphorylation of p65/RelA at Ser-536 in vivo. Together, these results strongly suggest that IKKβ phosphorylates p65/RelA in vitro and in vivo and that IKKβ, but not IKKα, plays a role in the inhibition of p53 by Tax. O'Mahony et al. (30O'Mahony A.M. Montano M. Van Beneden K. Chen L.F. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18137-18145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) reported recently that in Tax transactivation, IKKβ plays a dominant role in signaling for IκBα degradation, whereas IKKα appears to play an important role in enhancing the transcriptional activity of NF-κB by promoting p65/RelA phosphorylation at Ser-536. In these studies, the authors concluded that Tax failed to activate NF-κB reporter constructs in IKKα–/– but not IKKβ–/– MEFs. In our studies, we found that NF-κB luciferase values were 10–20-fold lower in Tax-transfected IKK knock-out cells compared with Tax-transfected WT cells. With this point in mind, however, we did observe a modest increase in NF-κB activity in IKKβ–/– but not IKKα–/– cells. Consistent with our results, others have reported that IKKα–/– and IKKβ–/– cells are deficient in interleukin-1- and TNF-stimulated phosphorylation of the transactivation domain of the p65/RelA subunit and thus, NF-κB transcriptional activity (55Sizemore N. Lerner N. Dombrowski N. Sakurai H. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3863-3869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that a critical step in p53 inhibition is p65/RelA phosphorylation mediated by IKKβ. It is interesting to note that IKK-mediated p65/RelA phosphorylation at Ser-536 has been reported in cancer cell lines including the human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa and the colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line HT29 (26Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 39Sakurai H. Suzuki S. Kawasaki N. Nakano H. Okazaki T. Chino A. Doi T. Saiki I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36916-36923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 56Jiang X. Takahashi N. Ando K. Otsuka T. Tetsuka T. Okamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The p65/RelA subunit was rapidly phosphorylated by IKKβ in response to TNF-α, and the target residue was Ser-536 in HeLa cells. Ser-536 of p65/RelA was phosphorylated following the stimulation of the lymphotoxin β receptor, and the KD mutant of IKKα inhibited phosphorylation of p65/RelA. These results suggest that IKK phosphorylation of p65/RelA may be involved in cellular transformation and proliferation of cytokine-stimulated cancer cells. It is interesting that p53 inhibition requires IKKβ but not IKKα because IKKα and IKKβ share 52% overall sequence homology and are capable of phosphorylating members of the IκB family as well as p65/RelA. In vitro studies indicate that the IKKα/IKKβ heterodimer has higher catalytic activity than either homodimer (57Huynh Q.K. Boddupalli H. Rouw S.A. Koboldt C.M. Hall T. Sommers C. Hauser S.D. Pierce J.L. Combs R.G. Reitz B.A. Diaz-Collier J.A. Weinberg R.A. Hood B.L. Kilpatrick B.F. Tripp C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25883-25891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, available data indicate that IKKα and IKKβ preferentially form heterodimers in vivo. Nonetheless, knock-out cells show that both IKKα and IKKβ are capable of homodimerization. Of interest to our studies, an IKKβ only complex was shown to exist in HeLa cells by affinity purification, anion exchange chromatography, and immunodepletion analysis, although the complex appeared to be only weakly activated by TNF-α (58Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H. Mann M. Manning A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1526-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that we did not see a requirement for IKKα argues that IKKβ, either as a homodimer or in complex with IKKγ (NEMO), is required for p53 inhibition through p65/RelA. We have identified a novel Tax-mediated pathway of p53 inhibition, which involves IKKβ and p65/RelA. IKKβ appears to be directly involved in p65/RelA phosphorylation. These results are surprising in as much as phosphorylation at Ser-536 has been reported to activate the transcriptional potential of p65/RelA by facilitating functional interaction with coactivators such as CBP/p300 (20Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). It is of interest, therefore, that p65/RelA phosphorylation at Ser-536 contributes to the inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity. Our previous studies have demonstrated that Tax induces the p65/RelA subunit of NF-κB to associate with p53 and stably integrate into the transcriptional complex in vivo (28Jeong S.J. Radonovich M. Brady J.N. Pise-Masison C.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 190-1497Crossref Google Scholar). This novel inhibition function of p65/RelA may involve inappropriate interaction with coactivators or other chromatin-modifying proteins in the transcriptional complex. For example, several studies have indicated that NF-κB-dependent transcription is regulated through interaction of the p65/RelA subunit with histone deacetylase (HDAC) corepressor proteins (59Ashburner B.P. Westerheide S.D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7065-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 60Chen L.F. Greene W.C. J. Mol.

Expression of HDAC1 and HDAC2 repressed TNF-induced NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity and gene expression (59Ashburner B.P. Westerheide S.D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7065-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). It is possible, therefore, that phosphorylated p65/RelA incorporates HDACs into the p53 complex, inhibiting transcriptional activity. Alternatively, the association of p53/p65/RelA at the p53-responsive promoter may inhibit transcription in a manner similar to the p65/RelA inhibition of Vitamin D receptor-mediated transcription. There must be differences in the pathway, however, because Vitamin D receptor inhibition requires the N-terminal Rel homology domain and the mid-molecular phosphoamino acid region that includes Ser-276 (63Lu X. Farmer P. Rubin J. Nanes M.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). p53 inhibition by Tax requires the C-terminal domain and Ser-536 phosphorylation. Our studies have uncovered a novel role for p65 Ser-536 phosphorylation in mediating p53 transcriptional activity in HTLV-I-infected cells. It will be important to develop strategies to alter this pathway and reactivate p53 and its apoptotic function in transformed cells."

Recently it was demonstrated that the GAT domain of both Tom1 and Tom1L1 binds ubiquitin, suggesting that these proteins might participate in the sorting of ubiquitinated proteins into multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Here we report a novel interaction between Tom1L1 and members of the MVB sorting machinery. Specifically, we found that the VHS domain of Tom1L1 interacts with Hrs (Hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate), whereas a PTAP motif, located between the VHS and GAT domain of Tom1L1, is responsible for binding to TSG101 (tumor susceptibility gene 101). Myc epitope-tagged Tom1L1 showed a cytosolic distribution but was recruited to endosomes following Hrs expression. In addition, Tom1L1 possesses several tyrosine motifs at the C-terminal region that mediate interactions with members of the Src family kinases and other signaling proteins such as Grb2 and p85. We showed that a fraction of Fyn kinase localizes at endosomes and that this distribution becomes more evident after epidermal growth factor internalization. Moreover, expression of a constitutive active form of Fyn also promoted the recruitment of Tom1L1 to enlarged endosomes. Taken together, we propose that Tom1L1 could act as an intermediary between signaling and degradative pathways.

Regulated degradation of cell surface proteins, particularly receptors involved in signaling pathways, is essential for the control of many biological processes, including cell proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation (1Futter C.E. Pearse A. Hewlett L.J. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1011-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 2Seto E.S. Bellen H.J. Lloyd T.E.

Internalized membrane-protein cargo can be delivered either to recycling vesicles for transport back to the cell surface or to late endosomes for transfer to lysosomes and degradation.

Rusten T.E. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Thus, proteins to be degraded are included into small vesicles that invaginate into the lumen of the endosome. Subsequent fusion of MVBs with lysosomes releases these vesicles into the lysosome lumen, where they are degraded by lysosomal hydrolases. In contrast, proteins that remain in the limiting membrane of MVBs are recycled to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or plasma membrane. In the last few years, a number of genetic and biochemical studies have allowed the characterization of the molecular machinery implicated in the formation of MVBs. Hrs appears to be the first protein to be recruited to endosomes (4Bilodeau P.S. Urbanowski J.L. Winistorfer S.C. Piper R.C. Nat.

Finally, the AAA-type ATPase Vps4 binds ESCRT-III and, following MVB vesicle formation, promotes the dissociation of the ESCRT protein complexes from endosomes for additional rounds of protein sorting (12Babst M. Wendland B. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2982-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have shown that mono-ubiquitination of cargo can serve as a signal for recognition by the vacuolar sorting machinery (13Hicke L.

Several components of the MVB sorting machinery have specific domains that allow them to interact with ubiquitinated cargo; this is the case with the ubiquitin-interacting motif of Hrs (16Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J. Schnell J.D. Sutanto M. Emr S.D. Hicke L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and the UEV domain of TSG101 (17Pornillos O. Alam S.L. Rich R.L.

Recently, the GAT domain present in the GGA (Golgi-localizing, γ-adaptin ear domain homology, ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf)-binding protein) and Tom families of proteins has been shown to bind ubiquitin (18Puertollano R.

GGA proteins are monomeric adaptors that are recruited to the TGN by the Arf-1 GTPase (22Dell'Angelica E.C. Puertollano R. Mullins C. Aguilar R.C. Vargas J.D. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. J.

They consist of four distinct segments as follows: a VHS domain that binds an acidic di-leucine sorting signal found in the mannose 6-phosphate receptor and other proteins known to cycle between TGN and endosomes (26Puertollano R.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) that GGAs are present not only at the TGN but also at endosomes. Knockdown of GGA3 by RNA interference had a very clear effect on the MVB pathway and resulted in the accumulation of enlarged endosomes and a block in transport of EGF receptor molecules to lysosomes. Moreover, the GAT domain of GGAs has the ability to interact with both ubiquitin and the ESCRT-I component TSG101 (18Puertollano R. Bonifacino J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 32Mattera R. Puertollano R. Smith W.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31409-31418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), thus indicating a potential role in endosomal sorting. In humans, the Tom family comprises three members termed Tom1, Tom1L1, and Tom1L2. Initially, Tom1 was identified as a protein whose expression is induced by v-Myb (33Burk O. Worpenberg S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1371-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and more recently was suggested to act as a negative regulator of the signaling pathways induced by IL-1β and TNF-α (34Yamakami M. Yokosawa H. Biol. & Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 564-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All Toms have a structure similar to GGAs including a VHS domain at the N-terminal region followed by a GAT domain. However, despite the sequence homology, the VHS domain of Tom1 and Tom1L1 does not contain the specific pocket implicated in the binding to acidic di-leucine sorting signal sequences (35Misra S. Beach B.M. Hurley J.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11282-11290Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 36Misra S. Puertollano R. Kato Y. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nature. 2002; 415: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), whereas the GAT domain does not conserve a helical extension necessary for the association with Arf (37Collins B.M. Watson P.J. Owen D.J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 321-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 38Suer S. Misra S. Saidi L.F. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6392-6399Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, the recent finding that the GAT domain of GGAs and Toms can interact with ubiquitin is of special interest, as it represents the first functional characteristic common to both families. To determine whether Toms also participate in the regulation of MVB formation, we decided to address whether these proteins can interact with components of the MVB sorting machinery. In the present work, we characterize the interaction of Tom1L1 with TSG101 and Hrs, as well as the recruitment of Tom1L1 to endosomes after Hrs or active Fyn overexpression. We feel the presence of motifs in the Tom1L1 C-terminal region that mediates interactions with signaling proteins, such as the tyrosine kinase Fyn and Grb-2, and the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, p85 (40Seykora J.T. Mei L. Dotto G.P. Stein P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2812-2822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), makes this protein an excellent candidate to connect signaling and degradative pathways. Plasmids—The complete open reading frame of human Tom1L1 (GenBank™ accession number AJ010071) was PCR-amplified from a human pancreas cDNA library using specific primers and was cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His Topo vector (Invitrogen). To generate Tom1L1-myc, the 3′ primer included an additional sequence to place a Myc epitope at the C terminus of the protein. Constructs encoding Tom1L1-VHS (residues 1–154), Tom1L1-GAT (residues 200–284), Tom1L1-VH-SGAT (residues 1–284), and Tom1L1 (residues 285–476) were obtained by PCR amplification and were cloned into the EcoRI-SalI sites of pGAD424 (Clontech). Mutation of 179PTAP motif to alanines was introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Fyn tyrosine kinase was amplified from a human heart cDNA library and cloned into pEGF-N3 via SalI-SacII. To generate constitutive active Fyn, tyrosine 531 was substituted by phenylalanine by introducing a punctual mutation into the 3′ primer. Plasmids encoding the following proteins were gifts of the investigators as indicated in parentheses: TSG101 (S. Cohen; Stanford University), GFP-hVps4-EQ (P. Woodman; University of Manchester, UK), and GFP-Hrs (Sylvie Urbe; University of Liverpool, UK). Antibodies and Reagents—Mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10) was obtained from Covance (Princeton, NJ). A polyclonal antibody to Hrs was the kind gift of Sylvie Urbe (University of Liverpool,) (41Hammond D.E. Carter S. McCullough J. Urbe S. Vande Woude G. Clague M.J. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 13: 1313-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Epidermal growth factor complexed to Alexa 555 was supplied by Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Transfection and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Transfection of HeLa cells was performed by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). For immunofluorescence, transfected HeLa cells were grown on coverslips, fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1 v/v) for 10 min at –20 °C, and subsequently air-dried. Incubation with primary antibodies diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.1% (w/v) saponin, 0.1% bovine serum albumin was carried out for 1 h at room temperature. Unbound antibodies were removed by rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, and cells were subsequently incubated with a secondary antibody (Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Ig) diluted in PBS, 0.1% (w/v) saponin, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, for 30–60 min at room temperature. After a final rinse with PBS, coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). Fluorescence images were acquired on an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). For EGF internalization assays, cells were starved for 6 h in serum-free medium and then stimulated with EGF complexed to Alexa 555 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 200 ng/ml for various times. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain HF7c was transformed by the lithium acetate procedure as described in the instructions for the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid kit (Clontech). For colony growth assays, two colonies of each HF7c transformant were resuspended in water to 0.1 A600/ml, and 5 μl was then applied to plates lacking leucine and tryptophan or leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and allowed to grow at 30 °C for 3–4 days. Tom1L1 Interacts with TSG101—To access the ability of Tom1L1 to bind ubiquitinated proteins and to determine whether this may indicate a role for this protein in the MVB pathway, we analyzed whether Tom1L1 can interact with components of the MVB sorting machinery. Yeast two-hybrid experiments revealed that an N-terminal fragment of Tom1L1 that includes both the VHS and GAT domains interacts with the full-length version of TSG101, a component of the ESCRT-I complex (Fig. 1, A and B). Next, we examined which domain of TSG101 was responsible for the binding to Tom1L1. As shown in Fig. 1C, the ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV) domain of TSG101, which comprises the first 150 amino acids of the protein, bound the VHS-GAT region of Tom1L1 with the same efficiency as full-length TSG101. In contrast, a fragment of TSG101 that included the C-terminal portion of the protein (from amino acid 150 to 390) failed to interact with Tom1L1. The UEV domain of TSG101 is related to the E2 enzymes that ligate ubiquitin to substrate proteins but is enzymatically inactive because it lacks the catalytically important cysteine residue (43Koonin E.V. Abagyan R.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 330-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 44Ponting C.P. Cai Y.D. Bork P. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 467-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Previously it was described that the UEV domain of TSG101 binds both ubiquitin and the PTAP/PSAP tetrapeptide motif located within the late domain of some viral proteins and Hrs (5Bache K.G. Brech A. Mehlum A. Stenmark H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 45Martin-Serrano J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 46Garrus J.E. von Schwedler U.K. Pornillos O.W. Morham S.G. Zavitz K.H. Wang H.E. Wettstein D.A. Stray K.M. Cote M. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Sundquist W.I. Cell. 2001; 107: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the analysis of the Tom1L1 sequence revealed the presence of a PTAP motif located between the VHS and GAT domain. Moreover, the mutation of the 179PTAP motif to alanines abolished the interaction with both TSG101 full-length and TSG101-UEV domain (Fig. 1, D and E). Thus, we characterized a novel interaction between the UEV domain of TSG101 and a PTAP motif located between the VHS and GAT domain of Tom1L1. Interaction between the VHS Domain of Tom1L1 and Hrs— To determine whether Tom1L1 binds other components of the MVB sorting machinery, we performed additional two-hybrid experiments. Specifically, we analyzed whether Tom1L1 can interact with Hrs, a key protein in the regulation of protein degradation (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B reveals an interaction between the VHS domain of Tom1L1 and full-length Hrs. In agreement with these data, a construct containing both the Tom1L1 VHS and GAT domains also bound Hrs, whereas the Tom1L1 GAT domains alone and the C-terminal portion of the protein (Tom1L1-(285–476)) demonstrated no apparent binding (Fig. 2B). The region of Hrs responsible for the binding to Tom1L1 comprises the residues located between position 450 and 775 (Fig. 2C). This region includes a coiled-coil domain that has been implicated previously in the binding to STAM (47Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T. Tanaka N. Endo K. Kasai H. Takeshita T. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32785-32791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and TSG101 (48Pornillos O. Higginson D.S. Stray K.M. Fisher R.D. Garrus J.E. Payne M. He G.P. Wang H.E. Morham S.G. Sundquist W.I. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, the ability of Tom1L1 VHS domain to interact with Hrs could be extended to other VHS domains. For example, the VHS domains of Tom1 and GGA family members (GGA1, GGA2, and GGA3) all bound Hrs with varying efficiency (Fig. 2D). Hrs Recruits Tom1L1 to Endosomes—To examine the physiological relevance of the observed interaction between Tom1L1 and members of the MVB sorting machinery, we examined whether Tom1L1 localized to endosomes. Transient expression of a Myc epitope-tagged Tom1L1 in HeLa cells revealed a cytosolic distribution for Tom1L1 (Fig. 3A). However, this is not unusual for members of the Tom family. Previous studies (49Katoh Y. Shiba Y. Mitsuhashi H. Yanagida Y. Takatsu H. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24435-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) have reported that Tom1 localizes to the cytosol, but it can be recruited to endosomes following the overexpression of the endosomal protein Toll-interacting protein (Tollip). Analogously, we found that the overexpression of GFP-Hrs, which localizes to endosomes (50Urbe S. Sachse M. Row P.E. Preisinger C. Barr F.A. Strous G. Klumperman J. Clague M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4169-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), was able to redistribute Tom1L1 from the cytosol to endosomes. Fig. 3 (B–D) shows that all the GFP-Hrs-positive structures also contain Tom1L1-myc. In addition, expression of a dominant-negative ATPase-deficient mutant of human Vps4 (hVps4-EQ), which stabilizes association of TSG101 and other components of the ubiquitin sorting machinery with aberrantly enlarged MVB precursor endosomes (51Bishop N. Woodman P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), resulted in the accumulation of Tom1L1-myc on those endosomes (Fig. 3, E, F, and G). In contrast with the complete colocalization observed between GFP-Hrs and Tom1L1-myc, it is interesting to note that the colocalization between GFP-hVps4-EQ and Tom1L1-myc is only partial (Fig. 3J, inset). Although both proteins are distributed on the enlarged endosomes, this could reflect that there is not a close contact between them. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that the interactions involving Tom1L1 and components of the endosomal sorting machinery observed by two-hybrid experiments are also occurring in cells. Localization of Fyn on Endosomes after EGF Internalization—It has been described previously that Srcasm (Srcactivating and signaling molecule), the mouse homolog of Tom1L1, is capable of interacting with Fyn, Grb2, and the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, p85, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner through several SH2 and SH3 domains located in the C-terminal portion of Srcasm (40Seykora J.T. Mei L. Dotto G.P. Stein P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2812-2822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The motifs responsible for these interactions are conserved between mouse and human, indicating that Tom1L1 is probably also able to bind the same proteins. In fact, analogous to what happens with Srcasm, we have observed that the expression of a constitutive active Fyn promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of Tom1L1 (data not shown). The ability of Tom1L1 to interact with both components of the MVB sorting machinery and proteins implicated in signal transduction prompted us to consider that Tom1L1 might be acting to connect degradative and signaling pathways. If that is the case, we should be able to detect at least a small proportion of these signaling proteins at endosomes. To address this question, we analyzed the distribution of Fyn tyrosine kinase fused to green fluorescent protein (Fyn-GFP). As shown in Fig. 4A, the transient expression of Fyn-GFP in HeLa cells showed that although most of the protein localized at the plasma membrane, some intracellular vesicles containing Fyn-GFP were also observed. To identify the nature of these vesicles, EGF internalization was assessed over time. Most interestingly, endocytosed EGF reached Fyn-GFP-positive structures after 5 min of internalization from the plasma membrane (Fig. 4, C–E). The colocalization between both proteins became more evident after 10 (Fig. 4, F–H) or 20 min of internalization (Fig. 4, I–K). Moreover, the amount of Fyn-GFP localized at endosomes also increased as EGF endocytosis proceeded. These results are in agreement with previous reports (52Baass P.C. Di Guglielmo G.M. Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 53Carpenter G. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 54Jiang X. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1522-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) that have proposed a participation of the Src family kinases (SFKs), which includes Fyn, in signaling at endosomes. A Constitutive Active Fyn Kinase Promotes the Recruitment of Tom1L1 to Enlarged Endosomes—We also examined the intracellular distribution of a constitutive active version of Fyn (Fyn-Y531F-GFP). Most interestingly, the vesicular localization of Fyn-Y531F-GFP was much more apparent than that observed for Fyn wild type (compare Fig. 4, A and B). The observed vesicles likely correspond to endosomes, as they colocalize with the endosomal protein Hrs (Fig. 5, A–C). Furthermore, the overexpression of Fyn-Y531F-GFP induced an enlargement of endosomal structures similar to the one observed after accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins or defects on the MVB sorting machinery (Fig. 5, A–C). This effect could be due to the hyper-phosphorylation of Hrs (55Bache K.G. Raiborg C. Mehlum A. Madshus I.H. Stenmark H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3881-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or other endosomal proteins. In addition, the overexpression of Fyn-Y531F-GFP also resulted in recruitment of Tom1L1 to enlarged endosomes (Fig. 5, D–F, arrows). Taken together, the results suggest that Fyn, Hrs, and Tom1L1 can colocalize to the same endosomal structures. Three different studies (18Puertollano R. Bonifacino J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 19Scott P.M. Bilodeau P.S. Zhdankina O. Winistorfer S.C. Hauglund M.J. Allaman M.M. Kearney W.R. Robertson A.D. Boman A.L. Piper R.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 20Shiba Y. Katoh Y. Shiba T. Yoshino K. Takatsu H. Kobayashi H. Shin H.W. Wakatsuki S. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7105-7111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have recently suggested that the GGAs might play a role in the sorting of ubiquitinated cargo at endosomes. The high degree of structural similarity between the GGAs and Tom1L1, all which contain VHS and GAT domains, together with the fact that the GAT domain of Tom1L1 interacts with ubiquitin, prompted us to analyze whether Tom1L1 also participates in the delivery of ubiquitinated cargo into MVBs. Here we report that Tom1L1 interacts with Hrs and TSG101, two components of the MVB sorting machinery, and that the overexpression of GFP-Hrs or GFP-hVps4-EQ promotes the recruitment of Tom1L1 from the cytosol to the endosomal membranes. The interaction of Tom1L1 and TSG101 was not completely surprising. It has been described recently that the C-terminal portion of the GGAs GAT domain is a three helix bundle that mediates interactions with different effectors, including Rabaptin-5, ubiquitin, and TSG101 (18Puertollano R. Bonifacino J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 30Mattera R. Arighi C.N. Lodge R. Zerial M. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 32Mattera R. Puertollano R. Smith W.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31409-31418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The fact that the GAT domain of Tom1 and Tom1L1 is able to interact with ubiquitin led us to hypothesize that it might also bind TSG101. As predicted, we found an interaction between Tom1L1 and TSG101. However, in contrast to the GGAs, this interaction is not mediated by the GAT domain but by a PTAP motif located in a 56-amino acid segment between the Tom1L1 VHS and GAT domain. In support of this finding, a residue found to be critical for the binding of GGAs to TGS101 (GGA1-Leu-277) is not conserved in the Tom1L1 GAT region. In addition, the segment that contains the PTAP domain is predicted to adopt a coiled-coil conformation when analyzed using the COILS secondary structure prediction program (56Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar) (www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html). This is consistent with its presumed participation in protein-protein interactions. Our finding here that the VHS domain of Tom1L1 interacts with Hrs is also of particular significance. Most importantly, the observed VHS-Hrs interaction extends beyond just Tom1L1, as we also demonstrate Hrs binding to the VHS domains of Tom1 and the GGAs. Based on the results presented here, we propose that there are not only structural similarities but also functional similarities between GGAs and Toms. Furthermore, these features might reflect a common role in endosomal sorting. Similarities include interactions with Hrs and ubiquitin through their VHS and GAT domains, respectively, and interaction with TSG101. In addition, GGAs and Toms undergo mono-ubiquitination (20Shiba Y. Katoh Y. Shiba T. Yoshino K. Takatsu H. Kobayashi H. Shin H.W. Wakatsuki S. Nakayama K. J. Biol.

In contrast to the GGAs and other members of the Tom family, Tom1L1s possess some very specific characteristics that suggest this protein might participate in signaling. Srcasm, the Tom1L1 murine ortholog, contains motifs predicted to interact with the SH2 and SH3 domains of SFKs, as well as the SH2 domains of Grb2 and p85 phosphoinositide 3-kinase. In addition, Srcasm can serve as a Fyn substrate and activate Fyn kinase activity. Recent lines of evidence have suggested that signaling can also occur at endosomes (52Baass P.C. Di Guglielmo G.M.

BioEssays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and that regulation of receptor trafficking might modulate the specificity and the duration of the signal transduction process. Furthermore, EGF receptor complexes remain active (57Sorkin A. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23453-23460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and associated with effectors, such as Grb2 and Ras, on endosomal membranes (54Jiang X. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). p85/p110 phosphoinositide 3-kinase is another molecule that is recruited to endosomes after growth factor stimulation (59Kapeller R.

Waterfield M.D. Backer J.M. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). In line with this these results, we have found that a subpopulation of Fyn-GFP localizes with internalized EGF on endosomes, and this colocalization is more evident after 20 min of internalization. Consistently, Src, another member of the SFKs, also localizes partially to endosomes (55Bache K.G. Raiborg C. Mehlum A. Madshus I.H. Stenmark H. Eur. J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Therefore, the three proteins that have been described to interact with the C-terminal region of Tom1L1, namely Fyn, Grb2, and p85, are known to be translocated to endosomes after EGF receptor internalization. In addition, active Fyn-GFP promoted the recruitment of Tom1L1 itself from cytosol to endosomal membranes, indicating that the capacity of Tom1L1 to bind signaling molecules may be related to its proposed role in sorting into MVBs and protein degradation. These results raise the interesting question of how Tom1L1 might connect signaling and protein degradation at endosomes. One possibility is that Tom1L1 could act as a bridge helping to bring in contact activated signaling complexes with the protein degradation machinery. Alternatively, Tom1L1 could facilitate the SFKs-dependent phosphorylation of some of the components of the MVB sorting machinery (55Bache K.G. Raiborg C. Mehlum A. Madshus I.H. Stenmark H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3881-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) regulating their association with endosomal membranes. Recently, it has been described that Tom1, another member of the Tom family, can act as a common suppressor in both IL-1β- and TNF-α-dependent pathways. Most importantly, the VHS domain of Tom1 is indispensable for this function (34Yamakami M. Yokosawa H. Biol. & Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 564-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here we described an interaction between the VHS domain of Tom1 and Hrs, suggesting that the inhibitory effect on IL-1β and TNF-α signaling could be related to protein degradation. Further studies will determine whether Toms have a general role in the sorting of ubiquitinated protein or in regulating trafficking and/or activity of specific receptors. We thank A.

https://openalex.org/W2075686186,"Cell transformation by simian virus 40 (SV40) results mostly from the highly oncogenic activities of the large T antigen (LT), which corrupts the cellular checkpoint mechanisms that guard cell division and the transcription, replication, and repair of DNA. The most prominent LT targets are the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and p53. Here we report that LT binds directly to Fbw7, the substrate recognition component of the SCFFbw7 ubiquitin ligase and a human tumor suppressor. LT binding mislocalizes the nucleolar Fbw7γ isoform to the nucleoplasm. Interestingly, the binding of LT to Fbw7 occurs via a decoy phospho-epitope within the C terminus of LT that closely mimics the consensus Cdc4 phospho-degron found within Fbw7 substrates. We demonstrate that, using this mode of interaction, LT can interfere with Fbw7-driven cyclin E turnover in vivo and causes increased cyclin E-associated kinase activity. Our data suggest that LT competes with cellular proteins for Fbw7 binding in a substrate-like fashion.

To utilize the host cell DNA replication machinery, small DNA tumor viruses have evolved mechanisms to override normal replication controls, such as the pRb 1The abbreviations used are: pRb, retinoblastoma protein; LT, large T antigen; CPD, Cdc4 phospho-degron; HA, hemagglutinin; NLS, nuclear localization signal. pathway (1Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar). pRb and its pocket protein family members p107 and p130 sequester E2F proteins and recruit histone deacetylases to E2F promoters to silence genes required for DNA synthesis, metabolism, and cell cycle progression (2Brehm A.

In normal cell cycles pocket proteins are inactivated by the oscillating activities of cyclin-dependent kinases through phosphorylation. SV40, as well as certain adeno- and papillomavirus serotypes, produces viral oncoproteins such as the SV40 LT antigen that inactivate pRb. LT binds directly to pRb and its family members via an N-terminal LxCxE motif. This domain is normally used by D-type cyclins, histone deacetylases (HDAC1 and HDAC2), and other chromatin remodeling factors (BRG1 and BRM) for the interactions with pocket proteins and is copied by LT and other viral oncoproteins (Ad-E1A, HPV-E7). Deletion of the LxCxE domain prevents LT from binding to pocket proteins and renders LT incompetent for cell transformation (4DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Figge J. Shew J.Y. Huang C.M. Lee W.H.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, LxCxE-dependent interactions are not essential for pRb-mediated growth arrest and binding of LT via the LxCxE motif is required but not sufficient for the inactivation of pocket proteins. pRb mutants that eliminate LT binding (and that of other LxCxE-containing proteins) are still capable of repressing E2F and cause cell cycle arrest (6Chan H.M. Smith L. La Thangue N.B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6152-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Dick F.A. Sailhamer E. Dyson N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3715-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A second N-terminal domain was shown to cooperate with the LxCxE motif in the full inactivation of pRb family members. This region, termed the DnaJ domain, specifically binds to the Hsc70 ATPase and is required for the release of E2F from pocket proteins (8Campbell K.S. Mullane K.P. Aksoy I.A. Stubdal H. Zalvide J.

The interaction of LT with p53 blocks p53-dependent growth arrest and apoptosis (11Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). LT contacts the DNA binding domain of p53 through a bipartite domain in its center and prevents p53 from activating transcription. Interestingly, the two p53 relatives, p63 and p73, are not targeted by LT (12Kojima T. Ikawa Y. Katoh I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1170-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Marin M.C. Jost C.A. Irwin M.S. DeCaprio J.A. Caput D. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Cell.

Besides pocket proteins and p53, a number of additional LT binding partners have been identified that are involved in the regulation of transcription (p300/CBP and p400), the spindle checkpoint (Bub1 and Bub3) (15Ali S.H. DeCaprio J.A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and DNA repair (Nbs1) (16Cotsiki M. Lock R.L. Cheng Y. Williams G.L. Zhao J. Perera D. Freire R.

More recently, LT has been shown to bind to Cul7, a member of the cullin family functioning as part of E3 ubiquitin ligases in various protein turnover pathways (18Ali S.H. Kasper J.S. Arai T. DeCaprio J.A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2749-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We describe here the interaction of LT with another component of the ubiquitination machinery: the F-box protein Fbw7. Fbw7 is the substrate recognition component of the SCFFbw7 ubiquitin ligase that targets cyclin E (19Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J.

These interactions bridge the actual ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to the substrate and lead to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the substrate by the proteasome. The Fbw7 gene is located in a chromosomal region (4q32) that is deleted in up to 30% of human tumors (32Spruck C.H. Strohmaier H. Sangfelt O. Muller H.M. Hubalek M. Muller-Holzner E. Marth C.

In this study, we identified Fbw7 as a target of LT and characterized a consensus CPD in the C terminus of LT that is regulated by phosphorylation of Thr701. However, unlike bona fide Fbw7 substrates, Fbw7 does not degrade LT. Instead, our data suggest that LT may function as a competitive inhibitor of Fbw7 function for physiologic substrates such as cyclin E. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Plasmids—U2OS (human osteosarcoma), VA-13 (SV40 transformed WI-38 human lung embryonic fibroblasts, available at the ATCC), and HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cell lines were cultured under standard conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For transient transfection experiments, cells were seeded into 6-cm dishes and transfected the next day by calcium precipitation overnight at 30–40% confluence. 24 h after washing and replacing the media cells were harvested either for protein extracts or immunostaining (36Clurman B.E. Sheaff R.J. Thress K. Groudine M. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1979-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Typically, we express (1/10) of the plasmid amount of pFlag-Fbw7α (0.3 μg) compared with Fbw7β and Fbw7γ (3 μg each). The in vivo Fbw7-driven cyclin E turnover assay was performed as described (37Welcker M. Singer J. Loeb K.R. Grim J. Bloecher A. Gurien-West M. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The LT cDNA was obtained from VA-13 cells. RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA and the LT sequence amplified by PCR. The purified product was subcloned into an HA-tagged version of the pCS2+ vector and sequenced. VA-13 cells contain a LT sequence corresponding to the SV40 Baylor 2 strain. All point mutants and deletions were introduced by the QuikChange method (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. Immunostaining, Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Kinase Assays—For immunostaining, cells were seeded and transfected on glass coverslips. Slips were fixed with ice-cold methanol/acetone (1:1) for 5 min, air-dried, and immunostained with primary antibody. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, slips were incubated with secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled anti-mouse antibody, washed, dried, and mounted. All protein extracts were made with Tween 20 lysis buffer (38Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Protein expression was determined by standard procedures (SDS-PAGE, Western blot, immunoblot). Protein complexes were analyzed by immunoprecipitation as described (36Clurman B.E. Sheaff R.J. Thress K. Groudine M. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1979-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Cyclin E kinase activity was measured by immunoprecipitation kinase assays using GST-pRb as described previously (38Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used in this study: anti-FLAG (Sigma, M2), anti-HA (12CA-5), anti-LT (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Pab 108), anti cyclin E (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, HE-111 and HE-12), and anti-Myc-tagged cyclin E (9E-10). The Fbw7 ubiquitin ligase is produced as three alternatively spliced isoforms that localize to different subcellular compartments (32Spruck C.H. Strohmaier H. Sangfelt O. Muller H.M. Hubalek M. Muller-Holzner E. Marth C. Widschwendter M. Reed S.I. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4535-4539PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kimura T. Gotoh M. Nakamura Y. Arakawa H. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We previously reported a nucleolar isoform of Fbw7, Fbw7γ, that regulates c-Myc turnover in the nucleolus (24Welcker M. Orian A. Grim J.A. Eisenman R.N. Clurman B.E. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1852-1857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). While nucleolar localization of Fbw7γ was observed in various cell types, we noticed that in VA-13 cells, this isoform excludes nucleoli and exhibits nucleoplasmic staining that is similar to that observed with the Fbw7α isoform (Fig. 1A). VA-13 cells are derived from the human diploid embryonic lung fibroblast WI-38 cell strain by SV40-mediated transformation. We thus speculated that viral transformation with SV40 caused mislocalization of Fbw7γ, perhaps by direct interaction of a viral protein with Fbw7. We tested this hypothesis by cloning the LT cDNA from VA-13 cells and expressing it in U2OS cells, in which Fbw7γ normally localizes to the nucleolus (24Welcker M. Orian A. Grim J.A. Eisenman R.N. Clurman B.E. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1852-1857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Remarkably, co-expression of LT completely eliminated Fbw7γ nucleolar localization and led to accumulation of this Fbw7 isoform in the nucleoplasm (Fig. 1B). Thus, the mislocalization of Fbw7γ in VA-13 cells is likely due to LT expression in these cells. LT contains a potent nuclear localization signal (NLS), and deletion of the NLS renders LT cytoplasmic (Fig. 1C, center panel). The LT/ΔNLS mutant failed to mislocalize Fbw7γ (Fig. 1B, right panel), and instead, a fraction of this mutant was detected in the nucleolus upon expression of Fbw7γ (Fig. 1C, right panel). This suggested that LT/ΔNLS is transported into the nucleolus via a direct interaction of LT with Fbw7γ. Fbw7 binds to its substrates via a conserved phosphorylation epitope, the Cdc4 phospho-degron or CPD (31Nash P. Tang X. Orlicky S. Chen Q. Gertler F.B. Mendenhall M.D. Sicheri F. Pawson T. Tyers M. Nature. 2001; 414: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The CPDs identified so far contain a central phospho-threonine followed by proline in the +1 position and preceded by hydrophobic residues in –1 and –2. Although LT could potentially interact with Fbw7 in a CPD unrelated fashion, examination of the LT primary sequence revealed a candidate CPD at the extreme C terminus with threonine 701 in its center (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, Thr701 has previously been identified as a phosphorylation site of unknown function (40Grasser F.A. Scheidtmann K.H. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Walter G. Virology. 1988; 165: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 41Scheidtmann K.H. Buck M. Schneider J. Kalderon D. Fanning E. Smith A.E. J.

In addition, this candidate CPD contains a glutamic acid residue in the +4 position (Glu705) relative to Thr701 that potentially mimics the phosphorylation of Ser384 required for cyclin E degradation by Fbw7 (see Fig. 2A and Refs. 37Welcker M. Singer J. Loeb K.R. Grim J. Bloecher A. Gurien-West M. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar and 43Ye X. Nalepa G.

Cyclin E/S384 phosphorylation is in the +4 position relative to the central Thr380 phosphorylation and can be replaced by glutamic acid in Fbw7-mediated in vivo turnover assays (37Welcker M. Singer J. Loeb K.R. Grim J. Bloecher A. Gurien-West M. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The negative charge in the +4 position, provided either by phosphorylation or by an acidic amino acid, is in fact present in every identified CPD, including the Thr62 degron of cyclin E, the Thr58 degron of c-Myc, and the Thr165 degron of Gcn4 (data not shown). We tested whether LT and Fbw7γ directly interact via this candidate CPD by generating a nonphosphorylatable LT mutant in which Thr701 is changed to alanine (LT/T701A). We first tested whether this mutant could eliminate Fbw7γ nucleolar localization. Fig. 2B demonstrates that wild-type LT renders Fbw7γ nucleoplasmic while the LT/T701A mutant failed to mislocalize Fbw7γ. We then determined whether this was due to a direct interaction of LT with Fbw7γ in immunoprecipitation assays. We found that LT and Fbw7γ efficiently coprecipitated in a Thr701 phosphorylation-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Moreover, we observed that binding to LT strongly increased the abundance of the Fbw7γ protein, most likely through stabilization of Fbw7γ (Fig. 2C). Stabilization of Fbw7γ was not detected with the LT/T701A mutant, probably due to their failure to interact. These results establish that LT binds directly to Fbw7γ via a CPD-like motif in its C terminus. Binding to a CPD is normally achieved through the WD40 domains within the Fbw7 C terminus (31Nash P. Tang X. Orlicky S. Chen Q. Gertler F.B. Mendenhall M.D. Sicheri F. Pawson T. Tyers M. Nature. 2001; 414: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 44Orlicky S. Tang X. Willems A. Tyers M. Sicheri F. Cell. 2003; 112: 243-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Structure analysis has demonstrated that the eight WD40 repeats form a phosphate-binding pocket, and we previously showed that a polypeptide encoding only the WD40 repeats of Fbw7 is sufficient for CPD binding (25Welcker M. Orian A. Jin J. Grim J.A. Harper J.W. Eisenman R.N. Clurman B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9085-9090Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). We thus determined whether the WD40 repeats were sufficient for LT binding. Fig. 2D demonstrates that LT contacts the WD40 domain of Fbw7 by coimmunoprecipitation. Moreover, the WD40 repeats coprecipitated only with wild-type LT but not the LT/T701A mutant. We conclude that the interaction of LT with Fbw7 occurs in a substrate-like fashion via the WD40 repeats of Fbw7 and a classical Cdc4 phospho-degron in the C terminus of LT that is dependent on Thr701 phosphorylation. Since the WD40 repeats are common to each of the three Fbw7 isoforms, we tested whether LT is capable of interacting with all of them. As shown in Fig. 3A each of the Fbw7 isoforms coprecipitates with LT in a T701 phosphorylation-dependent manner. The interaction with Fbw7β, however, is greatly reduced, likely due to the cytoplasmic location of this isoform (Fig. 1A and Ref. 39Kimura T. Gotoh M. Nakamura Y. Arakawa H. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cyclin E degradation by Fbw7 requires Ser384 phosphorylation (37Welcker M. Singer J. Loeb K.R. Grim J. Bloecher A. Gurien-West M. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and an S384A mutant is at least partly deficient in Fbw7 binding (43Ye X. Nalepa G. Welcker M. Kessler B. Spooner E. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Clurman B.E. Harper J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50110-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, in analogy to cyclin E/Ser384, the interaction of LT with Fbw7 may require Glu705, which provides a negative charge in the +4 position of Thr701 (see Fig. 2A). We tested this idea with a LT/E705A mutant in coimmunoprecipitation assays for each of the Fbw7 isoforms. We also generated a LT mutant in which Glu705 has been replaced with aspartic acid, another negatively charged amino acid (E705D). Binding of LT to any of the Fbw7 isoforms indeed required the negative charge provided by Glu705 and could be replaced by Asp705 (Fig. 3B). The interaction of LT with the WD40 repeats is also dependent on Glu705 (data not shown). Although we have not formally excluded that E705A mutation may interfere with Thr701 phosphorylation we think this possibility is rather unlikely given the comparison with all other Fbw7 targets. Therefore, these data establish the role of a negative charge in the +4 position and further define the sequence requirements of consensus CPDs. The data above demonstrate that LT interacts specifically with Fbw7 via a CPD in its C terminus. Because CPDs bind directly to the substrate recognition domains of Fbw7, the WD40 repeats, this interaction could potentially interfere with the turnover of Fbw7 substrates. We tested this possibility with in vivo turnover assays for Fbw7-mediated degradation of cyclin E. Cyclin E normally becomes eliminated upon coexpression of Fbw7 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (37Welcker M. Singer J. Loeb K.R. Grim J. Bloecher A. Gurien-West M. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). We included LT in these transfection experiments and observed that LT did not interfere with Fbw7-driven cyclin E turnover when large amounts of Fbw7 were expressed. However, when we reduced the expression of Fbw7 by titration, LT impaired cyclin E degradation in a LT/Thr701 phosphorylation-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). These latter conditions are more likely to mimic the stoichiometric relationships between LT and Fbw7 in cells infected with SV40, which contain high levels of LT. Moreover, we observed increased cyclin E abundance caused by LT, but not the LT/T701A mutant, even in the absence of Fbw7 cotransfection, suggesting interference with the endogenous Fbw7 pathway (compare lanes 2 and 3 in Fig. 4, A and B). To test this directly we compared wild-type cyclin E with an Fbw7-insensitive cyclin E/T380A mutant that has a threonine 380 to alanine substitution. This mutant displays increased stability and could not be further stabilized by LT (Fig. 4C). Therefore, the phosphorylation-specific LT-mediated increase of cyclin E is Fbw7-dependent. Because Fbw7 specifically targets the catalytically active fraction of cyclin E, we determined whether LT expression altered endogenous cyclin E kinase activity. We found that LT expression consistently increased endogenous cyclin E kinase activity greater than that seen with LT/T701A (2.8-fold versus 1.8-fold, Fig. 4D), and this supports the idea that whereas both LT proteins increase endogenous cyclin E transcription (via E2F), only wild-type LT reduces cyclin E turnover. These data underestimate the total effect of LT expression on endogenous cyclin E activity by at least 2-fold, because the transient transfection efficiency of U2OS cells in these experiments is less than 50% (data not shown). The SV40 LT protein binds to a number of host cell proteins and disrupts their normal functions. LT has thus proven to be a useful tool for the identification of important cancer-associated proteins, including pRb family members and p53. Our finding that LT binds directly to Fbw7 fits well with the general function of LT to specifically inactivate tumor suppressor genes. In fact, Fbw7 seems an ideal prey for LT, since almost every Fbw7 substrate is a potent oncogene (cyclin E, c-Myc, c-Jun, Notch), and Fbw7 inactivation would stabilize these substrates. Interestingly, in addition to being Fbw7 substrates, both cyclin E (via E2F) and Notch (45Bocchetta M. Miele L. Pass H.I. Carbone M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) are transcriptionally activated by LT, suggesting that LT deregulates these proteins through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. In fact, because Fbw7 targets catalytically active cyclin E, disruption of the Fbw7 pathway is required for overexpressed cyclin E to be maximally active (46Minella A.C. Swanger J. Bryant E. Welcker M. Hwang H. Clurman B.E. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1817-1827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). LT expression may thus increase cyclin E activity because it targets both its synthesis and destruction pathways. We have shown that the Fbw7γ isoform fails to localize to the nucleolus in SV40 transformed VA-13 cells (Fig. 1). Our finding that LT is responsible for this mislocalization also explains the nucleoplasmic localization of Fbw7γ in 293T cells, which also express LT (43Ye X. Nalepa G. Welcker M. Kessler B. Spooner E. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Clurman B.E. Harper J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50110-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The mislocalization of Fbw7γ by LT may lead to the deregulated activity of Fbw7γ targets within the nucleolus, including c-Myc (24Welcker M. Orian A. Grim J.A. Eisenman R.N. Clurman B.E. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1852-1857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, thus far we have not observed that LT activates the growth-promoting activity of c-Myc (a nucleolar c-Myc function) or causes c-Myc nucleolar accumulation. This may reflect the pleiotropic activities of LT expression, or perhaps, because LT has many “Myc-like” activities, these pathways may already be maximally active in LT expressing cells. Previous work has shown that the N terminus of LT is sufficient to transform mouse cells (47Bennoun M. Grimber G. Couton D. Seye A. Molina T. Briand P. Joulin V. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We thus considered it unlikely that binding to Fbw7 was required for LT-mediated cell transformation, and instead speculated that it may enhance the oncogenic potency of LT under certain conditions. However, we have not observed any Thr701-dependent effects in cotransformation assays using LT and Ras expression in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (data not shown). We also note that the LT CPD is contained within the variable domain in the LT C terminus (48Vilchez R.A. Kozinetz C.A. Arrington A.S. Madden C.R. Butel J.S. Am. J. Med. 2003; 114: 675-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which is characterized by its high degree of primary sequence flexibility. In fact, a small number of SV40 isolates from SV40-induced tumors do not contain the Thr701 phosphorylation site. While it is possible that these strains mutated LT subsequent to the establishment of tumors, this is also consistent with the idea that binding to Fbw7 is not essential for LT function. Moreover, we did not detect candidate CPDs in the HPV-E6/E7 and Ad-E1A/E1B oncoproteins, indicating that Fbw7 binding is not essential for oncogenesis by other small DNA tumor viruses. Surprisingly, we found that LT binds to Fbw7 in a substrate-like fashion via a decoy CPD. The exquisite conformation of the LT binding site to consensus bona fide Fbw7 substrates suggests that this mode of binding is physiologically important. One possibility is that this binding mode allows Fbw7 to remain active as a ubiquitin ligase, since other SCF components can still be recruited to the Fbw7 F-box. Analogous to the HPV-E6 oncoprotein that bridges the E6AP HECT domain ubiquitin ligase to p53, this would potentially allow LT to make use of the SCFFbw7 ubiquitin ligase to degrade a protein(s) that normally is not a substrate of Fbw7. Alternatively, this binding mode might allow LT to specifically inhibit Fbw7 function, since other SCF complexes would presumably be unaffected by LT. Additional studies are needed to further define the role of Fbw7 in regulating LT function in cellular transformation and SV40 replication.

Treatment with I3C causes a significant shift in the size distribution of the CDK2 protein complex from an enzymatically active 90 kDa complex to a larger 200 kDa complex with significantly reduced kinase activity. Co-immunoprecipitations revealed an increased association of both a 50 kDa cyclin E and a 75 kDa cyclin E immunoreactive protein with the CDK2 protein complex under I3C-treated conditions, whereas the 90 kDa CDK2 protein complexes detected in proliferating control cells contain the lower molecular mass forms of cyclin E. I3C treatment caused no change in the level of CDK2 inhibitors (p21, p27) or in the inhibitory phosphorylation states of CDK2. The effects of I3C are specific for this indole and not a consequence of the cell cycle arrest because treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with either the I3C dimerization product DIM or the anti-estrogen tamoxifen induced a G1 cell cycle arrest with no changes in the associated cyclin E or subcellular localization of the CDK2 protein complex.

Considerable epidemiological evidence show that diets high in vegetable and fiber lead to low cancer risks and confer protection from various forms of cancers, including breast cancer (1Birt D.F.

In particular, consumption of vegetables belonging to the Brassica genus, which includes broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower, have been reported to correlate with a decrease in mammary tumor incidence (3Bresnick E.

These epidemiological studies suggest the existence of naturally occurring compounds in dietary sources that represent a largely untapped source of potential chemotherapeutic molecules. One such phytochemical is indole-3-carbinol (I3C), 1The abbreviations used are: I3C, indole-3-carbinol; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma; DIM, 3–3′-diindolylmethane; CDC, cell division cycle; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CAK, CDK-activating kinase; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide.1The abbreviations used are: I3C, indole-3-carbinol; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma; DIM, 3–3′-diindolylmethane; CDC, cell division cycle; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CAK, CDK-activating kinase; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide. an autolysis product of gluccosinolates present in Brassica vegetables. Dietary exposure to I3C reduced tumor occurrence and decreased the multiplicity of spontaneous as well as carcinogen-induced mammary tumor formation in rodent model systems (4Loub W.D.

Furthermore, diets high in cabbage, a good source of I3C, reduced pulmonary metastasis of mammary tumor implants in mice (9Scholar E.M. Wolterman K. Birt D.F. Bresnick E. Nutr.

Consistent with these studies, I3C tested positive as a chemopreventative agent in several short term bioassays relevant to carcinogen-induced DNA damage, tumor initiation and promotion, and oxidative stress (10Sharma S. Stutzman J.D. Kelloff G.J. Steele V.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5848-5855PubMed Google Scholar). When ingested, the low pH environment of the stomach converts a large fraction of I3C into a variety of natural indole oligomers (11Bradfield C.A. Bjeldanes L.F. Food Chem.

In contrast to this dietary pathway, emerging evidence has revealed that I3C also exhibits direct anti-proliferative activity on certain cancer cells.

BMC Cancer. 2003; 3: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have shown that I3C has both anti-proliferative and/or apoptotic effects on cultured human reproductive cancer cells depending on the dose used in the assay. Regulated changes in the expression and/or activity of G1 cell cycle components control the growth of normal mammary epithelial cells, whereas the loss of normal cell cycle control in the G1 phase has been implicated in mammary tumor development and proliferation. Key targets of these pathways are specific sets of cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) protein complexes that function at specific stages of the cell cycle (34Sherr C.J. Harvey Lect. 2000; 96: 73-92PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4954) Google Scholar). For example, many breast tumors show an aberrant expression and/or amplification of cyclin D1 or cyclin E, (36Hamel P.A. Hanley-Hyde J. Cancer Investig. 1997; 15: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 37Musgrove E.A. Lee C.S. Buckley M.F. Sutherland R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8022-8026Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), which both interact with G1 phase CDKs. In fact, cyclin E expression has been shown to be the best diagnostic marker for breast cancer to date (38Sutherland R.L. Musgrove E.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 1546-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). CDK protein kinase activity is tightly regulated during passage through the cell cycle by the timely appearance and degradation of cyclin-CDK protein complexes, CDK subunit phosphorylation, and interaction with a variety of CDK inhibitors (39Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar). In early G1, activation of CDK4-cyclin D and CDK6-cyclin D protein complexes initiate the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb), partially releasing the E2F family of transcription factors to permit the synthesis of cyclin E in mid to late G1. CDK2 kinase activity increases as a result of its interaction with its regulatory partner, cyclin E, which directly hyperphosphorylates Rb, thereby further releasing the E2F transcription factors that in turn initiate the transcription of S phase genes. Although CDK2 and cyclin E have been shown to be dispensable for murine development (40Geng Y. Yu Q. Sicinska E. Das M. Schneider J.E. Bhattacharya S. Rideout W.M. Bronson R.T. Gardner H. Sicinski P.

For example, cyclin E-deficient cells have been shown to be resistant to oncogenic transformations (40Geng Y. Yu Q. Sicinska E. Das M. Schneider J.E. Bhattacharya S. Rideout W.M. Bronson R.T.

Thus, cyclin E-CDK2 protein complexes represents a critical potential target for anti-proliferative molecules, such as the natural indoles. We have demonstrated that I3C directly induces a G1 cell cycle arrest of human breast cancer cell lines through a pathway that is independent of estrogen receptor signaling and which targets specific G1-acting cell cycle components (21Cover C.M.

Our previous studies have shown that I3C down-regulates CDK6 transcription by disrupting the functional interactions of the Sp1 transcription factor with an Sp1-Ets composite DNA element in the CDK6 promoter (19Cram E.J. Liu B.D. Bjeldanes L.F. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22332-22340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). I3C also causes a pronounced decrease in CDK2 specific enzymatic activity and inhibited phosphorylation of endogenous Rb proteins (20Cover C.M. Hsieh S.J. Cram E.J. Hong C. Riby J.E. Bjeldanes L.F. Firestone G.L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1244-1251PubMed Google Scholar), although the precise mechanism underlying this process has not been characterized. The activity, accessibility and cellular utilization of CDK2/cyclin E can be regulated at multiple levels, any one of which could be potentially targeted by I3C treatment. For example, in addition to cyclin association, the activation of CDK2 also requires the dephosphorylation of Thr14 and Tyr15 by Cdc25A (47Sebastian B. Kakizuka A. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3521-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and an activating phosphorylation event at Thr160 by CDK-activating kinase (CAK) (48Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Another mode of regulating CDK2 kinase activity is through the association with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKI) such as p21, p27, and p57. Recent studies have also shown that the subcellular compartmentalization of either cyclin E or CDK2 greatly alters its enzymatic activity and accessibility to nuclear residing CAK, Cdc25A, and known substrates of CDK2 (49Malumbres M. Carnero A. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2003; 5: 5-18PubMed Google Scholar, 50Keenan S.M. Bellone C. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol.

In this study we demonstrate for the first time that I3C selectively controls the size distribution of the CDK2-cyclin E protein complex with concomitant alterations in cyclin E interactions and subcellular localization that results in an inhibition of CDK2 enzymatic activity in human breast cancer cells. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, calcium and magnesium-free PBS, l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and trypsin-EDTA were supplied by Cambrex/Biowhittaker (Walkersville, MD). I3C and DIM were purchased from LKT Laboratory Inc. (St. Paul, MN). [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Science Products. Insulin (bovine), tamoxifen, and tryptophol were purchased from Sigma. Flow Cytometry Analysis of DNA Content—MCF-7 cells were plated at 30% confluency on 100-mm tissue culture plates and treated for the indicated time points with 100 μm I3C in complete media. An aliquot of harvested cells were hypotonically lysed in 0.5–1 ml of DNA staining solution (0.5 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.05% Triton X-100). Cell debris was filtered and DNA content was analyzed as described previously (21Cover C.M. Hsieh S.J. Tran S.H. Hallden G. Kim G.S. Bjeldanes L.F. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3838-3847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Tissue Culture and Cell Lines—MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 μg/ml insulin, 1.25 ml of 20,000 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were maintained at subconfluency at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. I3C, DIM, tamoxifen, and tryptophol were dissolved in Me2SO (99.9% high performance liquid chromatography grade; Aldrich) at concentrations 1000-fold higher than the final concentrations used. Western Blot Analysis—After the indicated treatments, cells were lysed in either CDK2 lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3) or RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% sodium fluoride (NaF), 10 μg/ml β-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Proteins were electronically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Micron Separations, Inc., Westboro, MA) and blocked as described previously (21Cover C.M. Hsieh S.J. Tran S.H. Hallden G. Kim G.S. Bjeldanes L.F. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3838-3847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Blots were subsequently incubated at room temperature for an hour with anti-CDK2 (sc 748), CDK4 (sc260), and cyclin E1 (sc 198) antibodies. Blots probed with anti-p-Tyr (sc 7020), anti-p21(sc 398) or anti-p27 (sc 528) antibodies were either incubated at room temperature for 2–3 h or incubated overnight. All antibodies were used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in TBST with the exception of anti-pTyr antibody, which was made in 1% nonfat dry milk/TBST. All antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoprecipitation and CDK2 Kinase Assays—After the indicated treatments, cells were lysed for 15 min at 4 °C in CDK2 lysis buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (50 μg/ml PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml β-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Samples (500–800 μg of protein) were precleared as described previously (21Cover C.M. Hsieh S.J. Tran S.H. Hallden G. Kim G.S. Bjeldanes L.F. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3838-3847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) followed by incubation with 0.5 μg of anti-CDK2 or anti-cyclin E1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h. Thirty microliters of a 1:1 bead slurry was added to each sample and left on a rocking platform for 30 min. The beads were washed with CDK2 lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 5 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Half of the immunoprecipitation was checked by Western blot analysis to confirm the efficiency of the immunoprecipitation. The remaining half of the immunoprecipitation was used to assess for kinase activity as described above. I3C Directly Added to CDK2 IP/Kinase Assay—Immunoprecipitation of CDK2 was carried out as described above followed by a preincubation of the CDK2-immunoprecipitated protein complex with the indicated concentrations of I3C for 15 min at 30 °C. Half of the CDK2 immunoprecipitate was resolved on SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyzed for CDK2 while the remaining half was used to assess CDK2 kinase activity as described above. In a separate set of CDK2 immunoprecipitation, I3C was added concurrently with the [γ-32P]ATP and histone H1 followed by a 15-min incubation at 30 °C and assayed for activity. CDC25A Activity Assay—The constructs for GST-Cdc25A were a kind gift from Dr. Gregory Pierce's laboratory (Cancer Research Institute). Purified GST-Cdc25A was bacterially synthesized, sonicated in extraction buffer (1× PBS, 5 mm DTT, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8), and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation. GST-Cdc25A fusion proteins were then absorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose beads, washed three times and eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione. Cells were treated with either I3C or Me2SO for 48 h followed by a CDK2 immunoprecipitation as described above. Half of the CDK2 immunoprecipitation was used for Western blot analysis while the remaining half was used for the Cdc25A kinase assay; CDK2 immune complexes were either incubated with 2 μg of purified GST-Cdc25A or GST-alone for 15 min at 30 °C in phosphate buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 2.5 mm EDTA). Half of the CDK2 immunoprecipitate was analyzed for CDK2 protein levels, and the remaining half was used to assess CDK2 kinase activity as described above. Gel Filtration Column Chromatography—Gel filtration chromatography was carried out using a 50-cm length, 1.0-cm wide Kontes column (Fisher) packed with Superose 12 prep grade beads (Amersham Biosciences). Superose 12 beads were washed four times in column running buffer (250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3) followed by degassing for 1 h via vacuum suction. The bead slurry was packed onto the Kontes column for 8 min at 2.3 ml/min and 55 min at 0.5 ml/min. Uniform packing was monitored using blue dextran (2000 kDa) followed by calibration of the column using the following molecular mass standards purchased from Amersham Biosciences: catalase (250 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), and ovalbumin (45 kDa). Cells were either treated with 100 μm I3C, 30 μm DIM, 1 μm tamoxifen, 100 μm tryptophol, or Me2SO (control) for 48 h. Each sample was lysed in CDK2 lysis buffer with phosphatase and protease inhibitors and cleared of cellular debris with by centrifugation at 15,000 × g. Cell lysates (800 μg) were then applied immediately onto a Kontes size exclusion column packed with Superose 12 beads and a total of 80 fractions were collected. Forty microliters of column lysate was taken for immunoblot analysis of CDK2 and 400 μl were precipitated (15 μlof 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 ml of acetone, 400 μl of column lysate, mixed, and incubated at –70 for 3 h or overnight, followed by a 10 min spin at 15,000 × g at 4 °C), resuspended in 20 μl of 2× protein loading buffer used for immunoblotting for cyclin E and p21. For the column lysate immunoprecipitation/kinase assays, 2 consecutive gel filtration fractionations were conducted for each of the treatment groups. Column lysates were pooled, followed by the CDK2 immunoprecipitation/kinase assay described above. Indirect Immunofluorescence—MCF-7 cells were plated on 8-well Lab-Tek Permanox slides (Nage Nunc International, Naperville, IL) at 20% confluency and treated for 48–72 h with either Me2SO, I3C, DIM, tamoxifen or tryptophol (1 μl/ml of 1000× stock). Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.01% glutaraldehyde for 15 min, and permeabilized with cold 50/50 acetone for 1 min. Cells were blocked for 5 min with PBS containing 4% goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) followed by incubation with rabbit anti-CDK2 or mouse anti-cyclin E antibodies at a 1:150 dilution for 1.5 h (CDK2) at 25 °C or overnight for cyclin E at 4 °C. After five washes with cold PBS, cells were blocked and incubated with anti-rabbit rhodamine-texas red-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.; diluted 1:300 in PBS) or anti-mouse FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1:300) for 30 min. Cells were washed, mounted with clear nail polish and visualized on a Nikon Optiphot fluorescence microscope. Images were captured using Adobe Photoshop and a Sony DKC-5000 digital camera. Nonspecific fluorescence, as determined by incubation with secondary antibody alone was negligible. Subcellular Fractionations—Cell pellets were resuspended at 5× volume in buffer A (0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01 m KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF), incubated on ice for 30 min follow by a 5-min spin at 4 °C (1000 rpm). Cell pellets were resuspended at 2× volume in buffer A and dounced 100 strokes with type B pestle. Cells were checked with trypan blue to ensure at least 80% of cells were lysed, followed by a 20-min spin at 550 rpm. Supernatants were transferred to a new tube followed by 100,000 rpm centrifugation for 30 min in a ultracentrifuge to clear cytosolic extract of cellular debris. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 1.5× cell volume with buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA. 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF) and dounced 20 strokes with type B pestle. Extracts were nutated at 4 °C for 30 min followed by a 17,500 rpm centrifugation. The supernatants were dialyzed against 1000× volume of cold buffer C (0.02 m HEPES, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF), followed by a 17,500 rpm centrifugation. Extracts were normalized and analyzed by Western blot. Quantification of Autoradiography—Autoradiographic exposures were scanned with a UMAX UC630 scanner, and band intensities were quantified using the NIH Image program. Autoradiographs from a minimum of three independent experiments were scanned per time point. Time Course of I3C Inhibition of CDK2 Kinase Activity and G1 Cell Cycle Arrest—To determine the kinetics of the inhibition of CDK2 kinase activity by I3C, estrogen responsive human MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with or without 100 μm I3C over a 96-hour time course. This concentration of I3C was previously shown to be the optimal dose for the inhibition of cell growth without affecting cell viability (21Cover C.M. Hsieh S.J. Tran S.H. Hallden G. Kim G.S. Bjeldanes L.F. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3838-3847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). CDK2 protein complexes were immunoprecipitated from total cell lysates by using a CDK2-specific antibody, and half of each sample was assayed in vitro for kinase activity and the other half analyzed for CDK2 protein by Western blot analysis. CDK2 protein kinase activity was monitored by the ability of the immunoprecipitated CDK2-cyclin protein complexes to phosphorylate the C-terminal domain of Rb fused to GST. As shown in Fig. 1A, electrophoretic analysis of the phosphorylated GST-Rb showed that the I3C suppression of CDK2 kinase activity can be observed in cells treated as early as 24-h post-treatment, with near maximal inhibition observed by 72 h in I3C. A nonspecific IgG was used in one set of immunoprecipitations (no IP lane) as a negative control to demonstrate the specificity of the CDK2 kinase assay. A similar inhibition of CDK2 kinase activity was observed in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells (data not shown). During the sample time course, the level of G1 phase MCF-7 cells was examined by flow cytometry of propidium iodide-stained nuclei. As shown in Fig. 1B, I3C treatment induces a significant increase in the number of G1 phase-arrested cells compared with untreated cells, which correlates closely to the kinetics of I3C inhibition of CDK2 enzymatic activity. Given the chemical nature of I3C, it is conceivable that this indole could act as a direct enzymatic inhibitor of CDK2, and thereby prevents the CAK phosphorylation of CDK2. To examine this possibility, a range of I3C concentrations was added to individual CDK2 immunoprecipitates either prior to or simultaneous with the addition of the histone H1 substrate and [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig. 1C, I3C has no significant effect on the in vitro CDK2 kinase activity. These results demonstrate that I3C does not inhibit CDK2 kinase activity through direct interactions with the CDK2 protein immunocomplex. Western blot analyses of CDK2 immunoprecipitates show that I3C treatment did not alter the total level of CDK2 protein (Fig. 1A), indicating that I3C inhibits total cellular CDK2 specific enzymatic activity. CDK2 protein migrates as a doublet, and the faster migrating CDK2 band represents the CAK-phosphorylated Thr160 form of CDK2, which is necessary for enzymatic activity (48Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The Western blots also revealed that in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, the CAK phosphorylated form of CDK2 is modestly reduced in samples immunoprecipitated from t"

It is well documented that arrestins contribute to desensitization of both Gs- and Gq-mediated signaling and mediate PTH1R internalization. However, whether PTH1R trafficking directly contributes to signaling remains unclear. To address this question, we investigated the role of PTH1R trafficking in cAMP signaling and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1/2 in HEK-293 cells. Dominant negative forms of dynamin (K44A-dynamin) and β-arrestin1 (β-arrestin1-(319–418)) abrogated PTH1R internalization but had no effect on cAMP signaling; neither acute cAMP production by PTH nor desensitization and resensitization of cAMP signaling were affected. Therefore, PTH1R trafficking is not necessary for regulation of cAMP signaling. PTH-(1–34) induced rapid and robust activation of ERK1/2. A PTHrP-based analog ([p-benzoylphenylalanine1, Ile5,Arg11,13,Tyr36]PTHrP-(1–36)NH2), which selectively activates the Gs/cAMP pathway without inducing PTH1R endocytosis, failed to stimulate ERK1/2 activity. Inhibition of PTH1R endocytosis by K44A-dynamin dampened ERK1/2 activation in response to PTH-(1–34) by 69%. Incubation with the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor AG1478 reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation further. In addition, ERK1/2 phosphorylation occurred following internalization of a PTH1R mutant induced by PTH-(7–34) in the absence of G protein signaling. Collectively, these data indicate that PTH1R trafficking and Gq (but not Gs) signaling independently contribute to ERK1/2 activation, predominantly via transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor.

Agonist-receptor complex internalization then occurs via clathrin-coated pits in a β-arrestin-dependent manner (12Ferrari S.L. Behar V. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Bisello A. J. Biol.

We have demonstrated that regulation of cAMP production by the PTH1R is predominantly under the control of β-arrestins (12Ferrari S.L. Behar V. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Bisello A. J. Biol.

Although arrestin-mediated PTH1R desensitization is probably independent of receptor internalization, this has not been firmly demonstrated. In fact, whether PTH1R trafficking contributes at all to the ability of the receptor to generate cAMP is at present unknown. Many cellular effects of PTH and PTHrP are also partly dependent on the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2). Activation of ERK1/2 has been described in various target cells, including osteoblasts, bone marrow stromal cells, and distal/proximal convoluted tubule kidney cells. In these cells, ERK1/2 activation is associated with differentiation, proliferation, survival, and calcium transport (18Chaudhary L.R. Avioli L.V. Mol. Cell.

Goltzman (21Miao D. Tong X.-K. Chan G.K. Panda D. McPherson P.S. Goltzman D. J. Biol.

In contrast, cAMP-mediated attenuation of ERK1/2 activation observed in osteoblasts, stromal cells, and osteogenic cells results in anti-proliferative actions (18Chaudhary L.R. Avioli L.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 178: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Verheijen M.H. Defize L.H. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and apoptosis (23Fujita T.

Nissenson R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, transactivation of the ubiquitously expressed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been shown to contribute to PTH1R-mediated ERK1/2 activation (24Ahmed I. Gesty-Palmer D. Drezner M.K. Luttrell L.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1607-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Clearly, a balance exists between Gs- and Gq-mediated signaling pathways and EGFR transactivation in ERK1/2 activation. However, it still remains unclear whether activation of ERK1/2 occurs via trafficking-dependent or -independent mechanisms. Furthermore, the mechanisms that couple G protein-mediated signaling and receptor trafficking to the underlying activation of MAPKs are yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we determine that PTH1R endocytosis occurs exclusively via both a β-arrestinand a dynamin-dependent mechanism in HEK-293 cells. Although PTH1R trafficking is not required for the regulation of cAMP signaling, we demonstrate that arrestin- and dynamin-dependent PTH1R internalization and Gq signaling independently contribute to ERK1/2 activation, predominantly by transactivation of the EGFR. Materials—Anti-p44/p42 MAPK (ERK1/2) and phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (pERK1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) rabbit polyclonal antibodies and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA).

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from Cambrex BioScience (Walkersville, MD). Both fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin were from Invitrogen. Human epidermal growth factor (EGF) and all other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air incubator at 37 °C. Cells were plated at 1.0 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plastic dishes (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) for adenylyl cyclase, radioligand binding, and radioligand internalization assays and transfected as described previously (15Ferrari S.L.

The pure products were characterized by analytical high pressure liquid chromatography, electron spray mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis. Radioiodination and high pressure liquid chromatography purification of PTH-(1–34) were carried out as described previously (12Ferrari S.L. Behar V. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Bisello A. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were pretreated with either vehicle (0.1% BSA in PBS) or PTH-(1–34) for 30 min followed by a 2-h washout at 37 °C in cell culture medium containing [3H]adenine (2 μCi/ml). Subsequently, the acute response and resensitization of cAMP signaling was determined in the presence of IBMX (1 mm) by PTH-(1–34) stimulation for 30 min of unstimulated cells and PTH-(1–34)-pretreated cells, respectively. Residual cAMP accumulation was measured for 30 min in the presence of IBMX (1 mm) in PTH-(1–34)-pretreated cells. In all cases, reactions were stopped with 1.2 m trichloroacetic acid, and cAMP was isolated by the two-column chromatographic method. To prevent de novo synthesis of PTH1R, in some experiments cells were preincubated for 2 h with cycloheximide (25 μg/ml) at 37 °C and maintained in the presence of cycloheximide for the duration of the experiment. ERK1/2 Phosphorylation Assays—Cells were incubated for 18–24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% BSA. Peptide treatments were carried out for the times indicated (2–30 min), after which cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS and solubilized in 300 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture set I and the phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm glycerophosphate). Cell lysates were incubated for 20 min and subsequently centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Cellular debris was then removed, cell lysates were resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer, and resolved by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose at 250 mA for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature using Tris-buffered saline blocking solution containing 5% (w/v) milk powder, 0.1% v/v Tween 20. Membranes were immunoblotted with 1:1000 phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) rabbit polyclonal antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed extensively, and incubated in secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG; 1:2000). After the detection of phosphorylated ERK1/2 bands by chemiluminescence and autoradiography, the membranes were stripped with 1 m glycine, pH 2.3–2.6 for 30 min at room temperature, rinsed with wash buffer, and immunoblotted as above with 1:1000 anti-p44/p42 MAPK rabbit polyclonal antibody. Autoradiographs were digitized, and subsequent analyses were performed with Image J software (National Institutes of Health). Fluorescence Microscopy—For fluorescence microscopy studies with Rho-PTH-(1–34) and Rho-PTH-(7–34), HEK-293 cells were plated on 25-mm glass coverslips (1.5 × 105 cells/coverslip), transfected with the indicated GFP-tagged PTH1Rs as described above, and cultured for 24 h. Coverslips were then rinsed twice in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated with the fluorescent peptides (100 nm each) for 15 min at 37 °C. The unbound ligands were removed by washing three times with cold PBS, and coverslips were fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min on ice. For immunofluorescence studies of ERK1/2 activation, HEK-293 cells transiently expressing the GFP-tagged PTH1R (PTH1R-GFP) were grown on glass coverslips as described above. Cells were then treated as detailed in the figure legends (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8) with 100 nm PTH-(1–34), transferred to ice, rinsed in PBS, and fixed and permeabilized using a 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% Triton X-100 solution for 30 min. Blocking was performed by incubating the cells for 10 min at room temperature in 4% fetal bovine serum. Primary antibody (anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) rabbit polyclonal antibody) diluted 1:250 in PBS plus 1% BSA was applied to the specimens for 1 h at room temperature followed by three washes with the same buffer. Alexa Fluor 546-tgged secondary antibody was diluted 1:200 and applied under the same conditions as the primary antibody. Coverslips were then rinsed in PBS and mounted for immunofluorescence microscopy. Coverslips were analyzed with a Zeiss LSM5 Pascal confocal microscope with a 63× oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY).Fig. 2Effect of K44A-dynamin on agonist-stimulated PTH1R internalization and cAMP accumulation.

PTH1R was cotransfected with either β-arrestin1-(319–418) or K44A-dynamin in HEK-293 cells. Radioligand internalization assays were performed (Figs. 1A and 2A). In control cells (cotransfected with empty vector pcDNA3), PTH1R was rapidly internalized (82 ± 8% after 45 min). In the presence of β-arrestin1-(319–418), receptor endocytosis was significantly inhibited compared with endocytosis under control conditions, such that 45 min after agonist stimulation only 34 ± 1% was internalized (p < 0.005). Similarly, in the presence of K44A-dynamin, receptor endocytosis was significantly inhibited compared with endocytosis under control conditions, such that 45 min after agonist stimulation only 30 ± 1% was internalized (p < 0.005). Furthermore, membrane expression and the affinity of [125I-Nle8,18,Tyr34]PTH(1–34)-NH2 to the PTH1R under control conditions or in the presence of either wild-type or K44A-dynamin were equivalent irrespective of the plasmid combination used (Kd was 13 ± 1, 18 ± 2, and 22 ± 4 nm, respectively).

https://openalex.org/W1991356240,"Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K) γ is a lipid kinase that is regulated by G-protein-coupled receptors. It plays a crucial role in inflammatory and allergic processes. Activation of PI3Kγ is primarily mediated by Gβγ subunits. The regulatory p101 subunit of PI3Kγ binds to Gβγ and, thereby, recruits the catalytic p110γ subunit to the plasma membrane. Despite its crucial role in the activation of PI3Kγ, the structural organization of p101 is still largely elusive. Employing fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements, coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization studies with p101 deletion mutants, we show here that distinct regions within the p101 primary structure are responsible for interaction with p110γ and Gβγ. The p110γ binding site is confined to the N terminus, whereas binding to Gβγ is mediated by a C-terminal domain of p101. These domains appear to be highly conserved among various species ranging from Xenopus to men. In addition to establishing a domain structure for p101, our results point to the existence of a previously unknown, p101-related regulatory subunit for PI3Kγ.

At the plasma membrane, they phosphorylate PtdIns-4,5-P2 to PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, which is recognized by a subclass of PH domains (3Hurley J.H. Misra S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 49-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Proteins featuring such PH domains include Akt/protein kinase B and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1, which initiate the major signaling pathways downstream of class I PI3K, accounting for most known cellular effects of class I PI3K activation. Class II and III PI3K are involved in membrane homeostasis and trafficking events within the endomembrane system, presumably in a constitutive manner (4Simonsen A. Wurmser A.E. Emr S.D. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar).

The p110α, -β, and -δ isoforms bind to regulatory subunits of the p85/p55 family and are referred to as class IA PI3K. The p85/p55 regulatory subunits consist of modular interaction domains (such as SH2 and SH3) and mediate the activation of these PI3K downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases by membrane translocation and desinhibition of the bound catalytic subunit (7Yu J.

Both subunits of PI3Kγ have been shown to bind Gβγ in vitro, albeit p101 does so with at least 5-fold higher affinity (9Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). On the other hand, lipid kinase activity of p110γ can be stimulated by Gβγ in the absence of p101 (18Leopoldt D. Hanck T. Exner T. Maier U. Wetzker R. Nürnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7024-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of the p101 subunit in the activation by Gβγ was controversial. However, we could recently show that, in heterologous expression systems, the p101 subunit is essential for Gβγ-mediated activation of PI3Kγ in living cells. p101 binds to Gβγ released from heterotrimeric G proteins and, thereby, recruits the bound p110γ catalytic subunit to the plasma membrane, which is a prerequisite for GPCR-induced PI3Kγ activity in living cells (19Brock C. Schaefer M. Reusch H.P. Czupalla C. Michalke M. Spicher K. Schultz G. Nürnberg B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).In contrast to the well established domain structure of the p85/p55 class IA regulatory subunits and despite its important role in the activation of PI3Kγ, the structural organization of p101 still remains largely elusive. Therefore, we asked whether a domain structure analogous to the p85/p55 subunits can be established for p101. We generated p101 deletion mutants and assayed their ability to bind to p110γ and Gβγ in living cells by recruitment assays as well as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) studies. We show here that distinct regions within the p101 primary structure are responsible for interaction with p110γ and Gβγ.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Expression Plasmids—cDNAs coding for deletion mutants of p101 were generated by PCR (PCR system Expand HF; Roche Applied Science) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5/HIS/TOPO (Invitrogen). Porcine p101 cDNA was used as template. Primers used for the generation of p101 deletion mutants are listed in Table 1 of the supplemental material. These primers introduce optimized ribosomal binding sites, appropriate stop codons, and, in some cases, restriction sites to allow for the fusion of deletion mutants to CFP. All PCR fragments were verified by sequencing (DYEnamic ET kit, Amersham Biosciences; ABI-377, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). N- or C-terminal fusion to CFP was achieved by subcloning into the custom-made vectors pcDNA3-NCFP or pcDNA3-CFP (20Schaefer M. Albrecht N. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1634-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), respectively. pcDNA3-NCFP was generated by subcloning the open reading frame of CFP into the HindIII site of pcDNA3 via BsmBI and HindIII.p110γ-FLAG was generated by subcloning of human p110γ cDNA via HindIII and XbaI into a custom-made pcDNA3 vector encoding the amino acid sequence DYKDDQDK downstream of the XbaI site. YFP-GRP1-PH was constructed by subcloning from the plasmid encoding GFP-GRP1-PH (21Gray A. Van Der Kaay J. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) via NheI and BsrG I into pEYFP-C1 (BD Biosciences). Construction of expression plasmids coding for p101, CFP-p101, p101-CFP, p110γ, YFP-p110γ, p110γ-YFP, Gβ1, Gγ2, and the human fMLP receptor has been described elsewhere (19Brock C. Schaefer M. Reusch H.P. Czupalla C. Michalke M. Spicher K. Schultz G. Nürnberg B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or minimal essential medium with Earle's salts, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Transfection of HEK293 cells was performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The amount of transfected plasmid cDNA was 2 μg per 35-mm dish (4 μg per 60-mm dish for co-IP experiments) and kept constant by addition of empty expression vector (pcDNA3) where necessary. For fluorescence microscopy experiments, cells were seeded on glass coverslips.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot—48 h after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Igepal Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3.2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were centrifuged to pellet cellular debris. p110γ-FLAG was immunoprecipitated from the cleared lysates by adding 4 μg of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and 6 mg of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) and incubating overnight on a rotating wheel at 4 °C. After centrifugation, protein A-Sepharose pellets were washed three times with high salt lysis buffer (lysis buffer supplemented with 900 mm NaCl) and once with lysis buffer and finally resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond ECL membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by electroblotting. Immunodetection was performed using anti-FLAG M2 (1:1000) or anti-GFP antibodies (1:1000; BD Biosciences), followed by probing with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse (1:5000) or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1:2000; both Sigma), respectively. Chemiluminescence was detected with an ECL detection kit (Applichem).Fluorescence Imaging and Confocal Microscopy—An inverted microscope (Axiovert 100; Zeiss) with a Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 objective (Zeiss) was used for the determination of FRET efficiencies. Monochromatic light derived from a xenon lamp (Polychrome IV; TILL Photonics) was passed through a dual reflectivity dichroic mirror (<460 nm and 500–520 nm; Chroma) for excitation. Fluorescence signals were passed through 475–505-nm (CFP) or 535–565-nm (YFP) band pass filters exchanged by a motorized filter wheel (Lambda 10/2; Sutter Instruments) and detected by a cooled CCD camera (Imago; TILL Photonics). FRET efficiencies were determined using the acceptor photobleaching method. CFP and YFP fluorescence was excited at 410 and 515 nm, respectively. After 15 cycles of image acquisition for CFP and YFP signals with 40 and 8 ms illumination, respectively, at an interval of 2 s, YFP was bleached through an additional 1.8-s illumination at 512 nm for 60 cycles of 2 s each, typically yielding about 95% YFP photobleach. FRET efficiencies E were calculated using the equation E = 1 - (FDA/FD), with FDA representing the CFP fluorescence measured before bleaching YFP and FD representing the CFP fluorescence in absence of YFP acceptor. FD was obtained by linear regression of the increase in CFP fluorescence with the decrease in YFP fluorescence and extrapolation to zero YFP fluorescence, i.e. complete YFP photobleach (22Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar).For measurements of intracellular calcium, cells were loaded with 1 μm fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) for 20 min at 37 °C. A 505-nm dichroic mirror combined with a 510-nm long pass filter and a 40×/1.3 F-Fluar objective was used for calcium imaging. In each image acquisition cycle, cells were sequentially excited at 340, 380, 430, and 450 nm. Fluorescence signals of CFP and calcium-free and calcium-bound Fura-2 were separated by multivariate linear regression analysis, and calcium concentrations were determined as described previously (23Lenz J.C. Reusch H.P. Albrecht N. Schultz G. Schaefer M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).For confocal microscopy, an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 Meta; Carl Zeiss) and a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 objective were used. CFP was excited with the 458-nm line of an argon laser and detected through a 475-nm long pass filter. For simultaneous imaging of CFP and YFP, CFP was excited at 458 nm and detected through a CFP-selective band pass filter (470–500 nm; Chroma). YFP was excited at 488 nm and detected through a 505-nm long pass filter. Pinholes were adjusted to yield optical sections of 0.8–1.4 μm. All experiments were performed 24–48 h after transfection at room temperature in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 128 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin.RESULTSCharacterization of p101 Deletion Mutants—To establish a basic functional map of p101, a series of deletion mutants was generated and fused to CFP (Fig. 1C). Expression of these constructs in HEK293 cells yielded diverse localization patterns (Fig. 1A, upper panels). If expressed without p110γ, full-length p101 located mainly to the cell nucleus. A similar distribution was observed for CFP-p1011–613 and p101249–877-CFP. A construct comprising amino acids (aa) 249–613 was localized exclusively within the nucleus, whereas expression of CFP-p1011–333 or of p101517–877-CFP resulted in a predominant cytosolic fluorescence without nuclear accumulation (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the p101 primary structure using PSORT II (24Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1823) Google Scholar) revealed three nuclear localization signals located at positions 400–403, 499–502, and 558–565. Of these, only that at 499–502 is conserved among various species (see supplemental Fig. 1).Upon coexpression with p110γ, which localizes to the cytosol in HEK293 cells, CFP-p101 is mostly excluded from the nucleus and localizes to the cytosol, indicating an interaction between both proteins (19Brock C. Schaefer M. Reusch H.P. Czupalla C. Michalke M. Spicher K. Schultz G. Nürnberg B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). A similar p110γ-mediated redistribution was also observed for the C-terminally truncated construct CFP-p1011–613, whereas the nuclear accumulation of p101249–877-CFP and CFP-p101249–613 remained unchanged in the presence of p110γ (Fig. 1A, upper and middle panels). These data indicate that the N terminus of p101 is crucial for interaction of p101 with p110γ, whereas the C terminus and middle parts of p101 appear to be not sufficient to bind to p110γ.To further validate these findings and to assess the immediate proximity between p101 deletion mutants and p110γ more directly, FRET experiments were performed (Fig. 1B). As shown previously, FRET efficiencies of about 9% are measured between coexpressed CFP- and YFP-tagged p101 and p110γ, provided that the fluorescent tags are fused to the same termini in both proteins (19Brock C. Schaefer M. Reusch H.P. Czupalla C. Michalke M. Spicher K. Schultz G. Nürnberg B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Comparable FRET efficiencies were determined between YFP-p110γ and CFP-p1011–613 as well as YFP-p110γ and CFP-p1011–333. Deletion of the p101 N terminus (p101249–877-CFP), however, led to a complete loss of binding to p110γ-YFP, indicated by FRET efficiencies comparable with those determined between free CFP and p110γ-YFP. Likewise, p101517–877-CFP and CFP-p101249–613 did not exhibit FRET if coexpressed with p110γ-YFP or YFP-p110γ. Thus, the N terminus of p101 is both necessary and sufficient to bind p110γ, whereas C-terminal elements appear to be neither sufficient nor necessary for this interaction.Coexpression of CFP-p101 and Gβ1γ2 led to a redistribution of CFP-p101 from the nucleus to the cytosol and plasma membrane (Fig. 1A, upper and lower panels), indicative of an interaction between mainly membrane-localized Gβγ complexes and CFP-p101 (19Brock C. Schaefer M. Reusch H.P. Czupalla C. Michalke M. Spicher K. Schultz G. Nürnberg B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This redistribution was also observed for deletion mutants containing the C terminus of p101, i.e. p101249–877-CFP and p101517–877-CFP. All constructs with C-terminal deletions lacked noticeable differences in their subcellular distribution upon coexpression with Gβ1γ2. These data point to a crucial role of the p101 C terminus in the interaction with Gβγ.Accordingly, both N and C termini of p101 were necessary for activation of PI3Kγ signaling in an heterologous system (Fig. 2). In HEK293 cells expressing the fMLP receptor, p110γ, full-length p101 and the YFP-fused PtdIns-3,4,5-P3-binding PH domain of GRP1 (21Gray A. Van Der Kaay J. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), a pronounced translocation of YFP-GRP1-PH was observed upon stimulation with 1 μm fMLP (Fig. 2, upper panels). This translocation was completely abrogated if p101249–877 was expressed instead of full-length p101 (Fig. 2, middle panels), presumably because p110γ was unable to bind to the truncated p101 lacking the N terminus of full-length p101 (see Fig. 1, A and B) and was therefore not co-translocated to the plasma membrane. Likewise, translocation of YFP-GRP1-PH upon fMLP stimulation was abolished if p1011–613 was expressed instead of full-length p101 (Fig. 2, lower panels), presumably because the truncated p101 lacking the C terminus complexed with p110γ but failed to bind to Gβγ (see Fig. 1A), which is a prerequisite to membrane translocation of the PI3Kγ complex.Fig. 2Both the N and C termini of p101 are necessary for GPCR-mediated PI3Kγ activation in vivo. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the fMLP receptor, p110γ, YFP-GRP1-PH, and the indicated full-length or N- or C-terminally truncated p101 constructs and analyzed by confocal microscopy. The pleckstrin homology domain of GRP1 fused to YFP (YFP-GRP1-PH) was used as a translocating biosensor for the production of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3. Shown are representative images of its subcellular localization before and 2 min after addition of fMLP (1 μm). Bars: 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The p110γ Binding Site of p101—Constructs spanning different areas of the p101 N terminus were generated to define the borders of the p110γ interaction site in steps of about 25 aa (Fig. 3C). Upon fusion to CFP and coexpression with YFP-p110γ, these constructs were used for a FRET-based monitoring of the protein-protein interaction. Since the protein fragments were tagged and sequentially shortened at opposite termini, we expect similar FRET efficiencies until the binding interface is affected. With the exception of CFP-p1011–200, which showed only a minor but statistically significant reduction of FRET efficiencies, C-terminal deletions up to aa 175 did not result in significant reduction of FRET efficiencies between YFP-p110γ and CFP-fused p101 deletion mutants as compared with CFP-p101 (Fig. 3A). A significant decrease in FRET efficiencies was observed for CFP-p1011–150 and CFP-p1011–131, and the value obtained for YFP-p110γ and CFP-p1011–100 was close to that of free CFP and YFP-p110γ, indicating a loss of interaction. A construct lacking the 25 N-terminal aa (p10125–333-CFP) still yielded FRET with YFP-p110γ, whereas CFP-p10150–333 and CFP-p10175–333 did not exhibit FRET upon coexpression with YFP-p110γ.Fig. 3Mapping of the p110γ interaction site on p101. A, FRET analysis of the interaction between CFP-tagged p101 constructs and YFP-p110γ. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding CFP-tagged p101 deletion mutants and YFP-p110γ. Depicted are means and S.E. of four independent measurements with at least six cells each. Stars indicate FRET efficiencies which differ significantly from that of CFP-p101 and YFP-p110γ (p < 0.05; unpaired Wilcoxon test). B, coimmunoprecipitation of p110γ-FLAG and p101 deletion mutants. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids coding for p110γ-FLAG and the indicated p101 deletion mutants or a CFP-YFP fusion protein. Cell lysates were analyzed with an anti-GFP antibody for expression of deletion mutants (load). p110γ-FLAG was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies, and co-purified p101 constructs were detected with an anti-GFP antibody. Note that CFP-p1011–223 is presumably coimmunoprecipitated as well but overlaps in size with an unspecific band present in all lanes. C, schematic representation of the N-terminal p101 constructs used. Bars are shaded according to the ability of the constructs to bind to p110γ (light gray) with the common minimal binding region in dark gray. D, competition of FRET between p110γ-YFP and p101-CFP by coexpression of non-fluorescent wild-type p101. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding p101-CFP and p110γ-YFP (left panel) or CFP-p1011–333 and YFP-p110γ (right panel). For each condition, the ratios between CFP-tagged protein and untagged p101 are indicated. Depicted are means and S.E. of four independent measurements with at least six cells each.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To corroborate these results based on a novel application of FRET to map protein interaction domains in the context of living cells, co-IP experiments were performed. In agreement with the FRET-based approach, CFP-p101 and CFP-tagged p101 deletion mutants with C-terminal deletions up to aa 131 coimmunoprecipitated with p110γ-FLAG from lysates of transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 3B). CFP-p1011–100 and deletion mutants lacking more than 25 N-terminal aa could not be detected in the respective immunoprecipitates. Likewise, no binding was detected for the N-terminally truncated p101249–877-CFP (see above) as well as for a CFP-YFP-fusion protein used as a control for unspecific binding of CFP. Thus, the minimum binding site on p101 for p110γ consists of aa 25–131. However, a FRET efficiency comparable with that of full-length p101 requires at least a common portion comprising aa 25–175 of p101.To control for a possible generation of an artificial binding site due to truncation of p101 or fusion with the fluorescent protein, FRET-based competition assays were performed. p101-CFP was displaced from binding to p110γ-YFP when co-expressed with the same amount or a 4-fold excess of non-fluorescent wild-type p101, resulting in a reduction of the FRET efficiency (Fig. 3D, left panel). A displacement by non-fluorescent wild-type p101 was also observed for FRET between CFP-p1011–333 and YFP-p110γ (Fig. 3D, right panel). The reduction in FRET efficiency brought about by coexpression of untagged p101 is comparable for p101-CFP and CFP-p1011–333, indicating that both proteins can be similarly displaced by wild-type p101 from a common binding site on p110γ.The Gβγ Binding Site of p101—Based on the finding that a C-terminal fragment of p101 comprising aa 517–877 was sufficient to bind to Gβγ (see Fig. 1C), further constructs were generated to map the Gβγ binding site of p101 within these boundaries (Fig. 4A). Upon coexpression with Gβγ, p101630–877-CFP was recruited to the plasma membrane, whereas CFP-p101517–771 was not (Fig. 4B). If p101630–877 was further shortened in steps of ∼25 aa, membrane recruitment upon coexpression with Gβγ was retained in p101650–877-CFP and CFP-p101630–850 but was lost in p101675–877-CFP, p101700–877-CFP, CFP-p101630–825, and CFP-p101630–800 (Fig. 4C and data not shown for CFP-p101700–877 and CFP-p101630–800). Taken together, binding to Gβγ was retained in deletion mutants containing a common portion comprising aa 650–850 of p101 (Fig. 4D), whereas further deletions completely abolished binding to Gβγ. Indeed, the CFP-fused predicted binding domain (CFP-p101650–850) was expressed as a soluble protein in the cytosol but recruited to the plasma membrane upon coexpression with Gβγ. Thus, the Gβγ binding domain of p101 is confined to aa 650–850. Since CFP-p101650–850 displaced a coexpressed full-length p101 from binding to Gβγ (Fig. 4E), CFP-p101650–850 and full-length p101 utilize the same binding site on Gβγ. Interestingly, the efficient competition and the more pronounced membrane localization of CFP-p101650–850 point to an even higher Gβγ-binding affinity of the isolated domain compared with full-length p101. We conclude that the Gβγ-binding C-terminal fragment of p101 functions and folds independently of other parts of p101, thereby rendering it an independent protein domain.Fig. 4Mapping of the Gβγ interaction site on p101. A, schematic representation of constructs comprising C-terminal areas of p101. Bars are shaded according to the ability of the constructs to bind to Gβγ. B–E, HEK293 cells transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated p101 constructs as well as Gβ1 and Gγ2 or pcDNA3 were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Representative images are shown (bars:10 μm). E, CFP-p101650–850 competes with p101-YFP for binding to Gβγ complexes. p101-YFP was expressed either without (left) or together with CFP-p101650–850 (middle and right). Note the nuclear accumulation of p101-YFP in the presence of CFP"
https://openalex.org/W2088033029,"Homologous recombination is repressed by the binding of p53 to Rad51. We identified by fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy that peptides corresponding to residues 179–190 of Rad51 bind to the core domain of p53 in a site that overlaps with its specific DNA binding site. The p53 site is quite promiscuous, since it also binds peptides derived from 53BP1, 53BP2, Hif-1α, and BCL-XL in overlapping regions. Binding is mediated mainly by a strong, nonspecific, electrostatic component and is fine tuned by specific interactions. Competition of the different proteins with each other and with specific DNA for a single site in p53 could be a factor in regulation of its activity.

It consists of a β-sandwich that serves as a scaffold for a DNA-binding interface (7Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P.

In response to DNA damage, Rad51 mediates the first step of homologous recombination by forming large homo-oligomers along a single-stranded DNA chain at the point of the double-stranded breaks (see Refs. 3Bertrand P.

The binding sites between Rad51 and p53CD were mapped, using deletion mutants of p53, showing that amino acids 94–160 and 264–315 in p53CD bind residues 125–220 in Rad51 (19Buchhop S. Gibson M.K.

Binding of p53 to Rad51 inhibits Rad51 oligomerization and, as a consequence, inhibits homologous recombination (20Linke S.P. Sengupta S. Khabie N. Jeffries B.A. Buchhop S. Miska S. Henning W.

Here, we have used peptide mapping in combination with biophysical techniques to characterize the interactions of p53CD with its partner proteins Rad51, CTF2, and Pirh2, interactions for which no structural information is available. We used NMR to identify the site on p53CD that binds the Rad51 peptides, which overlaps with the specific binding site for DNA, 53BP1, and 53BP2. We identified a strong electrostatic component in the binding of peptides derived from various p53CD-binding proteins by this site in p53CD. Our findings indicate that the DNA-binding interface of p53CD is a promiscuous site for protein binding, which functions via a large electrostatic component that is fine tuned by specific interactions. We discuss the implications for the regulation of the p53 response and for drug design. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized on a Pioneer peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. The peptides were labeled with fluorescein at the N terminus on the Pioneer peptide synthesizer using a 4-fold excess of fluorescein-OSu (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and a 4-fold excess of hydroxybenzotriazole. All other amino acids were purchased from NOVAbiochem. The peptides were purified on a Waters high pressure liquid chromatograph using a reverse-phase C8 semi-preparative column (Vydac) as described (22Friedler A. Hansson L.O. Veprintsev D.B. Freund S.M. Rippin T.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Rudiger S. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—Human p53 core domain wild type and mutants (residues 94–312) were cloned, expressed, and purified as described (23Bullock A.N. Henckel J. DeDecker B.S. Johnson C.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14338-14342Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). 15N-labeled human p53 core domain was produced as described (24Wong K.B. DeDecker B.S. Freund S.M. Proctor M.R. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8438-8442Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—The equilibrium sedimentation experiments were performed on a Beckman XL-I ultracentrifuge using a Ti-60 rotor and six-sector cells at a speed of 30,000 and 40,000 rpm. All experiments were done at 10 °C. The sample volume was 50 μl. Samples were considered to be at equilibrium as was judged by comparing several scans at each speed. Buffer conditions were 50 mm HEPES, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.2. The ionic strength of the buffer was adjusted to the desired total ionic strength with a stock solution of 3 m NaCl in the same buffer. Data were processed and analyzed using UltraSpin software (available on the World Wide Web at www.mrc-cpe.cam.ac.uk). Fluorescence Anisotropy—Fluorescence anisotropy titrations were performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-55 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a Hamilton Microlab 500 titrator and controlled by laboratory software, according to the procedure described (22Friedler A. Hansson L.O. Veprintsev D.B. Freund S.M. Rippin T.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Rudiger S. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The fluorescein-labeled peptides were dissolved in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, 5 mm dithiothreitol at the desired ionic strength to a final concentration of 0.05–0.1 μm. 1 ml of the peptide solution were placed in a cuvette, and p53 core domain (240 μl, ∼100 μm) was titrated into the peptide in 40 steps of 6 μl. The fluorescence anisotropy was measured after each addition. The excitation wavelength was 480 nm (bandwidth 12 nm), and the emission wavelength was 525 nm (bandwidth 12 nm). Data were fit to a simple 1:1 equilibrium model: R = R0 + (ΔR*[P]/([P] + Kd), where R represents the measured fluorescence anisotropy value, ΔR is amplitude of the fluorescence change from the initial value (peptide only) to the final value (peptide in complex), [P] is the added protein concentration, R0 is the starting fluorescence value, corresponding to the free peptide, and Kd is the dissociation constant for the complex. In some cases, a linear drift term was added to the above equation to account for nonspecific interactions. For investigating the effects of the ionic strength, we used a starting buffer of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, which has an ionic strength of 4.1 mm. The ionic strength was adjusted using NaCl. For highly charged peptides, such as poly(Glu), nonspecific binding was observed in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, due to very strong electrostatic interactions. Thus, the buffer used was 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, which has a higher ionic strength of 20.5 mm. NMR Spectroscopy—All 1H,15N HSQC spectra were acquired at various temperatures on a Bruker DRX 600-MHz spectrometer as described (24Wong K.B. DeDecker B.S. Freund S.M. Proctor M.R. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8438-8442Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Samples for NMR experiments contained 15N-labeled wild-type or mutant p53 core domain at a concentration of 180 μm and the corresponding peptides at a concentration of 1–2 mm. The low solubility of some of the Rad51, CTF2, and Pirh2 peptides limited their concentrations to 100–500 μm. The buffer was 150 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2% D2O in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2 (I = 207 mm). Chemical shift analysis was performed as described (22Friedler A. Hansson L.O. Veprintsev D.B. Freund S.M. Rippin T.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Rudiger S. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Domains from Rad51, Pirh2, and CTF2 are known to bind to the p53 core domain: Rad51 125–220 binds the p53 core domain at residues 94–160 and 264–315 (19Buchhop S. Gibson M.K. Wang X.W. Wagner P. Sturzbecher H.W. Harris C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3868-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar); Pirh2 residues 120–137 bind the core domain in an unknown site (18Leng R.P. Lin Y.

Cell. 2003; 112: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar); and CTF2 residues 239–285 bind the core domain at residues 161–223 (17Uramoto H. Izumi H. Nagatani G. Ohmori H. Nagasue N. Ise T. Yoshida T. Yasumoto K. Kohno K. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We first analyzed which peptide fragments of Rad51, Pirh2, and CTF2 bound to p53CD. We synthesized fluorescein-labeled peptides of overlapping sequences corresponding to the putative p53-binding regions of these proteins (Table I) and studied their binding to p53CD using fluorescence anisotropy and analytical ultracentrifugation at low ionic strength (I = 20.5 mm, no added salt). As a positive control, we used the peptide FL-CDB3, which is derived from the p53-binding loop of 53BP2 (residues 490–498) and binds at the DNA-binding interface of p53CD (22Friedler A. Hansson L.O. Veprintsev D.B. Freund S.M. Rippin T.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Rudiger S. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). As a negative control, we have used the peptide FL-ctrl (Table II), which does not bind p53CD (25Issaeva N. Friedler A. Bozko P. Wiman K.G. Fersht A.R. Selivanova G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13303-13307Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). At I = 20.5 mm, peptides derived from Rad51 bound the p53 core domain with a reasonable affinity in the low micromolar range (Fig. 1, A–C; see below). The Pirh2 peptides bound much more weakly, with affinities between 200 and 600 μm (Fig. 1C). The CTF2 peptides bound p53CD with affinities between 75 and 150 μm (Fig. 1C).Table IPeptide mapping of Rad51, Pirh2, and CTF2PeptidePeptide sequenceDerived from residuesRad51-derived peptidesFL-CDB50FL-MFGEFRTGKTQICHTL125-140FL-CDB51FL-QICHTLAVTCQLPIDR135-150FL-CDB52FL-QLPIDRGGGEGKAMYI145-160FL-CDB53FL-GKAMYIDTEGTFRPER155-170FL-CDB54FL-TFRPERLLAVAERYGL165-180FL-CDB55FL-AERYGLSGSDVLDNVA175-190FL-CDB56FL-VLDNVAYARAFNTDHQ185-200FL-CDB57FL-FNTDHQTQLLYQASAM195-210FL-CDB58FL-YQASAMMVESRYALLI205-220FL-CDB80FL-AERYGLSGS175-183FL-CDB81FL-GLSGSDVLD179-187FL-CDB82FL-GSDVLDNVA182-190Pirh2-derived peptidesFL-CDB62FL-LKCNLCLTTNL120-130aDerived from the mouse Pirh2 sequenceFL-CDB63FL-LKCNLCLAMNL120-130bDerived from the human Pirh2 sequenceFL-CDB64FL-LTTNLRGKHKCI126-137aDerived from the mouse Pirh2 sequenceFL-CDB65FL-LAMNLQGRHKCI126-137bDerived from the human Pirh2 sequenceCTF2-derived peptidesFL-CDB70FL-RKMELFASWSDE KLWQL239-255FL-CDB71FL-KLWQLVAMAK IERFS250-265FL-CDB72FL-IERFSYGQLI SKDFG260-275FL-CDB73FL-SKDFGESPFI MFISK270-285a Derived from the mouse Pirh2 sequenceb Derived from the human Pirh2 sequence Open table in a new tab Table IIFL-CDB3 derived peptides studied for p53 core domain binding and the ionic strength dependence of binding for selected peptidesPeptideChargeSequenceKdαcThe plots in Fig. 4B were fit to the linear equation, (logKd=A−αlogf±*), where (f±*) is the mean activity coefficient of the ions, as described (29)I = 20.5aKd values at I = 20.5 mm were determined using fluorescence anisotropy mmI = 150bThese values were extrapolated from the linear fits of the curves in Fig. 4B mmμmμmμmFL-CDB3-5FL-REDEDEIEW0.6340-48Biotin-CDB3-5Biotin-REDEDEIEW121500-38Single mutantsR490A-6FL-AEDEDEIEW0.2420-51E491A-4FL-RADEDEIEW3.45400-60D492A-4FL-REAEDEIEW2.4E493A-4FL-REDADEIEW2.2D494A-4FL-REDEAEIEW2.9E495A-4FL-REDEDAIEW1.8I496A-5FL-REDEDEAEW0.6E497A-4FL-REDEDEIAW2.0W498A-5FL-REDEDEIEA1.2Double mutantsE491/3A-3FL-RADADEIEW8.79400-53E491/7A-3FL-RADEDEIAW8.6E493/5A-3FL-REDADAIEW7.5E495/7A-3FL-REDEDAIAW6.1490/6A-6FL-AEDEDEAEW0.2496/8A-5FL-REDEDEAEA1.6Triple mutants490/6/8A-6FL-AEDEDEAEA0.3491/2/3A-2FL-RAAADEIEW33493/4/5A-2FL-REDAAAIEW28494/5/7A-2FL-REDEAAIAW16Other mutantsE491/3/5/7A-1FL-RADADAIAW13611,000-38FL-poly (Glu)-9FL-EEEEEEEEE0.0125800-101FL-ctrl+5FL-RKSKKKITWNDa Kd values at I = 20.5 mm were determined using fluorescence anisotropyb These values were extrapolated from the linear fits of the curves in Fig. 4Bc The plots in Fig. 4B were fit to the linear equation, (logKd=A−αlogf±*), where (f±*) is the mean activity coefficient of the ions, as described (29Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab Residues 179–190 of Rad51 Mediate Its Binding to p53CD— The initial peptide mapping revealed that residues 175–190 of Rad51 bound to p53 core domain; the peptide FL-CDB55 (Rad51 175–190) (Table I) bound the p53 core domain with Kd in the low micromolar range. There was good agreement between the various techniques; fluorescence anisotropy studies gave Kd = 18 μm (Fig. 1A), whereas the AUC experiments gave Kd = 25 μm (Fig. 1C). Other Rad51 peptides bound p53CD much more weakly, with Kd in the range of 100–200 μm (Fig. 1, A and C). To identify the precise region in Rad51 that binds the p53 core domain, we mapped FL-CDB55 (Rad51 175–190) by synthesizing three overlapping fluorescein-labeled 9-residue peptides derived from its sequence. The peptides, FL-CDB80, FL-CDB81, and FL-CDB82, were derived from Rad51 residues 175–183, 179–187, and 182–190, respectively (Table I). Binding of the peptides to p53 core domain was tested using fluorescence anisotropy (Fig. 1B). FL-CDB81 (Rad51 179–187) bound p53CD with Kd = 10 μm, whereas FL-CDB82 (Rad51 182–190) bound p53CD with Kd = 8 μm. FL-CDB80 (Rad51 175–183) had much weaker binding to p53CD, with Kd = 51 μm. We conclude that residues 179–190 are the major p53-binding residues of Rad51. These residues are from helix α10 and strand β3 (Fig. 2A), which are exposed on the Rad51 surface and are known to be involved in protein-protein interactions (26Shin D.S. Pellegrini L. Daniels D.S.

The DNA-binding Interface of p53CD Binds the Rad51 Peptides—We used HSQC NMR to determine the Rad51-binding site in p53CD by examining the changes in the chemical shifts of the backbone amides of 15N-labeled p53CD upon the addition of the Rad51-derived peptides. The NMR experiments were done at higher ionic strength (I = 207 mm), and their results were consistent with the fluorescence anisotropy and AUC results. Significant chemical shift changes were observed only for FL-CDB55 (Rad51 175–190), FL-CDB56 (Rad51 185–200), FL-CDB80 (Rad51 175–183), FL-CDB81 (Rad51 179–187), and FL-CDB82 (Rad51 182–190), which all contain parts of the p53CD-binding site described above. The NMR experiments did not detect binding of the other Rad51-derived peptides to p53CD. The residues in p53CD that changed their chemical shifts upon binding Rad51 peptides were mainly in the DNA-binding interface and were almost identical for the different Rad51-derived peptides. Fig. 2B shows the chemical shift changes in p53CD induced by binding of FL-CDB81 (Rad51 179–187). The corrected 15N and 1H chemical shift changes upon peptide binding (Fig. 2) were calculated as described (28Hajduk P.J. Dinges J. Miknis G.F. Merlock M. Middleton T. Kempf D.J. Egan D.A. Walter K.A. Robins T.S. Shuker S.B. Holzman T.F. Fesik S.W. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3144-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and shifts of 0.04 ppm and above were considered significant. The p53CD residues that had changes in their chemical shifts upon binding were Thr102, Tyr103, and Gly105 (from the N terminus), Leu114, His115, and Val122 (from loop L1), Tyr126 (from strand S2), Thr140 and Val143 (from strand S3), His179 (from helix H1), Glu198 and Gly199 (from strand S5), Leu206 and Asp207 (from strand S6), Ser215 (from strand S7), Asn239, Met243, and Gly244 (from loop L3), Ile254 (from strand S9), Leu265, Arg267, and Val272 (from strand S10), and Cys277, Gly279, Arg280, Arg282, Arg283, and Glu286 (from helix H2). These residues can be divided approximately into surface-exposed residues and buried residues. The surface-exposed residues create a well defined binding site for Rad51 on the surface of p53 (Fig. 2D). This site partly overlaps the binding sites for the DNA and for proteins such as 53BP2, HIF-1α, and BCL-XL but stretches toward the loop L1 side of the protein surface. The buried residues that change their chemical shift upon binding of Rad51 peptides probably do so because of secondary conformational effects and not from direct binding. The low solubility of the CTF2-derived peptides prevented their use at the high concentrations needed for NMR experiments. Our results for Rad51, taken together with known binding data for other proteins, suggest that the DNA-binding interface of p53CD serves as a general protein-binding site. This site contains numerous arginine residues that are also involved in DNA binding. We have calculated the electrostatic potential of p53CD (Fig. 3) and shown that the DNA-binding interface is indeed positively charged. This leads to the question of whether the DNA-binding interface of p53CD functions by a general electrostatic interaction or by specific binding to each and every target protein. We used the interaction of p53CD with the 53BP2-derived peptide FL-CDB3 (22Friedler A. Hansson L.O. Veprintsev D.B. Freund S.M. Rippin T.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Rudiger S. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), which is highly negatively charged, as a model to investigate the electrostatic component of peptide binding by this site in p53CD. We mutated each of the residues in FL-CDB3 to alanine to determine the contribution of every side chain to binding to p53CD. The binding affinity of the resulting peptides to p53CD was measured at I = 20.5 mm using fluorescence anisotropy (Table II). In general, substitution of the negatively charged Glu and Asp residues by Ala resulted in 4–7 times lower binding affinity to p53CD, with larger effects of mutation at the N terminus of the peptide. Mutation of the positively charged Arg490 increased the binding affinity to 0.2 μm, whereas mutation of the hydrophobic Ile496 did not affect binding. Mutation of Trp498 reduced the affinity 2-fold (Table II). The effects of changes of charge were cumulative. Mutation of two negatively charged residues weakened the binding 10–15-fold to Kd = 6–9 μm, whereas mutation of three negatively charged residues weakened Kd 30–70-fold, to the range of 16–33 μm. Mutation of 4 Glu residues to Ala resulted in Kd of over 100 μm. In all cases, the effect of mutation at the N terminus of the peptide was more pronounced than at the C terminus. Mutating groups of non-negatively charged residues did not reduce the binding affinity and in some cases even improved it (Table II). Negatively charged residues also contribute to the binding of Rad51 to p53CD. Peptides containing Asp184 and Asp187 bound p53CD much more tightly than did the other peptides (compare FL-CDB80 with FL-CDB81 and FL-CDB82 in Fig. 1B). This indicates that the Rad51-p53CD interaction is also mediated by large electrostatic effects. Effects of Ionic Strength—The contributions of electrostatic interactions can be detected by the effects of ionic strength, I, on the binding affinity. We determined the dependence on I of the binding of the variously charged FL-CDB3 mutants and also of FL-poly(Glu), which was synthesized as a model for a peptide that binds p53CD on a purely electrostatic basis. To a first approximation, the logarithm of the dissociation constants increased linearly with log[I], with FL-poly(Glu) having the highest sensitivity and the mutant with only one net charge the least (Fig. 4A). The classical Debye-Hueckel treatment of electrostatic effects that was developed for very dilute solutions of electrolytes surprisingly applies to protein-protein interactions at high ionic strength where the electrostatic component of the interaction fits the equation, logKd = A - αlogf±*, where f±* is the mean activity coefficient (29Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). At sufficiently high ionic strength, the electrostatic component should be masked, but there should be a linear dependence at low ionic strengths for binding dominated by electrostatic contributions. logKd for binding here had a linear dependence on logf±* for most of the mutant peptides (Fig. 4B). The slope of the curve, α, was much higher for FL-poly(Glu) than for the FL-CDB3 derivatives (Fig. 4B and Table II). Binding of the p53CD mutant R273H to FL-CDB3 had a similar dependence on logf±* to the binding of wild-type p53CD (Table II and Fig. 4C). FL-poly(Glu) bound p53CD extremely tightly at the lowest ionic strength, with Kd = 12 nm, 50 times lower than for FL-CDB3 (Table II). However, it had the highest ionic strength dependence (α), consistent with mainly nonspecific ionic binding. The affinities of the different peptides to the p53 core at physiological ionic strength (I = 0.15 m) were extrapolated from the dependence on logf±* (Fig. 3, C and D), since the fluorescence anisotropy measurements were not feasible for values of Kd above about 100 μm. Of the peptides tested, FL-CDB3 had the highest affinity to p53 core at I = 0.15 m with Kd around 340 μm (Table II). We measured the binding of FL-CDB3 directly by AUC at I = 0.15 m to be 210 μm, in good agreement with the extrapolation. We used AUC to test for the binding of p53CD to the peptides derived from Rad51, CTF2, and Pirh2 (for sequences see Table I) directly at physiological ionic strength (I = 150 mm). Kd values for the binding of the Rad51 and Pirh2 peptides to p53CD under these conditions were greater than 1 mm, which is >100–200 times weaker than at I = 21 mm. Because of the sensitivity limits of the AUC method, we could not precisely measure such Kd values, which are in the millimolar range. At I = 150 mm, the CTF2-derived peptides bound p53CD with similar affinity to the Rad51-derived peptides. FL-CDB70 (CTF2 239–255) bound p53CD with Kd = 670 μm, FL-CDB72 (CTF2 260–275) bound p53CD with Kd > 1 mm, and Kd for FL-CDB73 (CTF2 270–285) binding to p53CD was 600 μm. Binding of the Rad51 peptides to p53CD at I = 150 mm was still highly specific, as could be seen from the HSQC NMR binding experiments (Fig. 2), which were all done at I = 207 mm. We conclude that, in general, peptide binding by the DNA-binding interface of p53CD is highly dependent on the ionic strength and is strongly electrostatic. Effects of Mutations in p53CD on Binding FL-CDB3—We measured the binding of FL-CDB3 to a series of p53CD mutants. These included structural hot spot mutants (G245S, R249S, and R282W), DNA contact mutants (R248A and R273H), and β-sandwich mutants (e.g. V157F, I195T, I232T, and I255F). The results could be divided into two categories. At I = 20.5 mm, FL-CDB3 bound most mutants with Kd values in the range of 0.5–1 μm, similar to that for wild type (Fig. 4D). However, binding was weaker for all of the arginine mutants, reaching more than 3 μm (5–6-fold weaker binding than for wild type) for the surface-exposed mutants R248A, R249S, and R273H. This is probably due to the mutation weakening the electrostatic component of the interaction. A Multipurpose Promiscuous Binding Site—Many protein-protein interfaces contain regions of residues that are crucial for the affinity to other proteins and are promiscuous. 2In Ref. 30Arkin M.R.

U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6, are integral to pre-mRNA splicing (1Yu Y.T. Scharl E.C. Smith C.M. Steitz J.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. 2nd Ed.

During spliceosome assembly, an intricate network of RNA-RNA interactions among the snRNAs and the pre-mRNA facilitates two specific trans-esterification reactions that remove the intron. The well characterized interactions include base pairing between the 5′-sequence of U1 and the 5′-splice site of the pre-mRNA (3Zhuang Y. Weiner A.M.

Nature. 1993; 361: 660-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Collins C.A. Guthrie C. RNA. 2001; 7: 1845-1854PubMed Google Scholar), have also been well documented. A notable feature shared by all five spliceosomal snRNAs is their extensive internal modifications, including pseudouridylation and 2′-O-methylation (20Reddy R. Busch H. Birnsteil M.L. Structure and Function of Major and Minor Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Particles. Springer-Verlag Press, Heidelberg, Germany1988: 1-37Crossref Google Scholar, 21Massenet S. Mougin A. Branlant C. Grosjean H. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1998: 201-228Google Scholar). Significantly, these modifications appear to be mostly clustered in regions of demonstrated functional importance. For instance, both the 2′-O-methylated nucleotides and pseudouridines are concentrated in the sequences involved in the spliceosomal RNA-RNA interactions described above, suggesting a possible functional role in pre-mRNA splicing (21Massenet S. Mougin A. Branlant C. Grosjean H. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1998: 201-228Google Scholar). Among the five snRNAs, U2 contains the most modifications (20Reddy R. Busch H. Birnsteil M.L. Structure and Function of Major and Minor Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Particles. Springer-Verlag Press, Heidelberg, Germany1988: 1-37Crossref Google Scholar, 21Massenet S. Mougin A. Branlant C. Grosjean H. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1998: 201-228Google Scholar). There are 10 2′-O-methylated residues and 13 pseudouridines in the vertebrate U2 snRNA, representing more than 10% of the total nucleotides. In particular, all 6 uridines in the single-stranded branch site recognition region (4Parker R. Siliciano P.G. Guthrie C. Cell. 1987; 49: 229-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 22Zhuang Y.A. Goldstein A.M. Weiner A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2752-2756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are converted to pseudouridines after transcription (Fig. 1). Three of these pseudouridines are conserved in yeast U2 snRNA (21Massenet S. Mougin A. Branlant C. Grosjean H. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1998: 201-228Google Scholar) at equivalent positions within the branch site recognition sequence (Fig. 1, ψ35) and the adjacent downstream sequence (Fig. 1, ψ42 and ψ44). Modifications in higher eukaryotic spliceosomal snRNAs are believed to be catalyzed by an RNA-guided mechanism, directed by Box H/ACA sno/scaRNPs for pseudouridylation and Box C/D sno/scaRNPs for 2′-O-methylation (23Kiss T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3617-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 24Kiss T. Cell. 2002; 109: 145-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 25Yu Y.T. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. Grosjean H. Topics in Current Genetics. Springer-Verlag Press, Heidelberg, Germany2005Google Scholar). In some instances, this mechanism has been experimentally verified (26Jady B.E. Kiss T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 27Tycowski K.T. You Z.H. Graham P.J. Steitz J.A. Mol.

However, the formation of at least two pseudouridines in S. cerevisiae U2 (ψ35 and ψ44) is catalyzed by an RNA-independent mechanism. Specifically, ψ35 formation is catalyzed by Pus7p (29Ma X. Zhao X. Yu Y.T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1889-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and ψ44 is introduced by Pus1p (30Massenet S. Motorin Y. Lafontaine D.L. Hurt E.C. Grosjean H. Branlant C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2142-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the other modification sites in the yeast spliceosomal snRNAs are introduced by protein-only or RNA-guided mechanisms remains to be determined. The functional importance of vertebrate U2 modifications has recently been established (31Yu Y.T. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5783-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 32Zhao X. Yu Y.T. RNA. 2004; 10: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Donmez G. Hartmuth K. Luhrmann R. RNA. 2004; 10: 1925-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Using a Xenopus oocyte reconstitution system, we have shown that the 6 pseudouridines in the branch site recognition region as well as the 9 modified nucleotides within the 5′-most 27 nucleotides of Xenopus U2, including 3 pseudouridines and 6 2′-O-methylated residues, are all required for snRNP assembly and pre-mRNA splicing (31Yu Y.T. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5783-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 32Zhao X. Yu Y.T. RNA. 2004; 10: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Using NMR, the Greenbaum group (34Newby M.I. Greenbaum N.L. RNA. 2001; 7: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 35Newby M.I. Greenbaum N.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) has recently shown that the base-pairing interaction between ψ34 (ψ35 in yeast U2) in the branch site recognition region and the nucleotide next to the pre-mRNA branch point adenosine results in the branch point nucleotide being bulged out, a configuration known to be important for the first step of the splicing reaction. Consistent with this result, Valadkhan and Manley (36Valadkhan S. Manley J.L. RNA. 2003; 9: 892-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the change of uridine to pseudouridine at the same position (ψ35) greatly activates splicing-related catalysis via protein-free snRNAs (37Valadkhan S. Manley J.L. Nature. 2001; 413: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In light of these data, it remains puzzling, however, that the pus7 deletion (pus7Δ) yeast strain, in which U2 pseudouridylation at position 35 is completely blocked, does not show an obvious growth phenotype in rich media. We previously observed only a mild growth defect phenotype when the mutant strain was grown in competition with the wild-type strain or grown under high salt conditions (29Ma X. Zhao X. Yu Y.T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1889-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). 2X. Ma and Y.-T. Yu, unpublished data. To understand, in more detail, the functional role of ψ35 in yeast U2 in vivo, we performed a synthetic lethal screen using combinations of the pus7Δ mutant and unconditionally viable U2 point mutations located adjacent to the branch site recognition region (38McPheeters D.S. Abelson J. Cell. 1992; 71: 819-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Yan D. Ares Jr., M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 818-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 3D. S. McPheeters, unpublished data. We found that position 40 (U40) in U2, which is immediately downstream of the branch site recognition sequence, is crucial when ψ35 formation is blocked. Specifically, the inhibition of ψ35 formation coupled with mutation/deletion of position 40 in U2 gives rise to temperature-sensitive strains in which pre-mRNA splicing is blocked under nonpermissive conditions. Our results indicate that a single pseudouridine, ψ35, in the yeast U2 snRNA is critical for pre-mRNA splicing and cell growth under certain conditions. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—Two haploid strains, DM2484 (Mat α ura3Δ his3 lys2 ade2–101 pus7::KanMX snr20::LYS2 pU2URA-2[pRS316(URA3 CEN SNR20)]) and DM2486 (Mat a ura3Δ his3 leu2Δ lys2 ade2–101 pus7::KanMX snr20::LYS2 pU2URA-2[pRS316(URA3 CEN SNR20)]), were derived from the cross of the two parental strains, pus7Δ (Mat α pus7::KanMX his3Δ leu2Δ met15Δ ura3Δ) (ATCC) and DM1001 (Mat a trp1 ura3–52 his3 lys2 ade2–101 snr20::LYS2 pU2URA-2[PRS316(URA3 CEN) SNR20]). DM1001 is identical to YHM111 (9Madhani H.D. Guthrie C. Cell. 1992; 71: 803-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), except that it contains a plasmid encoding the full-length U2 snRNA. The wild-type PUS7 haploid strain (BY4741) (MATa his3Δleu2Δmet15Δura3Δ) was purchased from ATCC. Plasmid pCAU2 (CEN ARS HIS3 SNR20) contains a full-length wild-type U2 gene (40Chang J.S. McPheeters D.S. RNA. 2000; 6: 1120-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and contains a single base insertion at the 5′-end of the U2 gene to create a unique EcoRI site. All U2 mutant plasmids were derived from pCAU2 by replacing the EcoRI-EcoNI fragment containing the wild-type U2 gene with a PCR fragment containing a mutant U2 gene derived from in vitro T7 expression plasmids (38McPheeters D.S. Abelson J. Cell. 1992; 71: 819-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All U2 mutant plasmids were then sequenced to verify the presence of the mutation. Plasmid pPUS7 (CEN LEU2 PUS7) was constructed by inserting the wild-type PUS7 gene between the BamHI and PstI sites of Ycplac111 vector (41Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2523) Google Scholar). Plasmid pPUS7-Gal (CEN URA3 PGAL10-PUS7) was constructed by inserting the PUS7 gene between the BamHI and PstI sites of pAVA0040 (42Alexandrov A. Martzen M.R. Phizicky E.M. RNA. 2002; 8: 1253-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). All U2 mutant plasmids were used for transformation and selection with 5-fluoroorotic acid (5FOA; see below). pCAU2 and pPUS7 were used to rescue the growth phenotype of strains with the pus7 deletion coupled with U2 mutation/deletion at position 40 (Fig. 2C, pus7Δ+U2-U40G and pus7Δ+U2-U40Δ, and see “Transformation and 5FOA Selection” below). pPUS7-Gal was used for the promoter shutoff assay (Fig. 4, and see below).Fig. 4Promoter shutoff experiments showing thatpus7Δ coupled withU2-U40Δ/U40Gmutations leads to the accumulation of some pre-mRNAs.A, growth curves for four different yeast strains are shown. The open circles represent the wild-type yeast strain. The open triangles represent the pus7Δ strain that had been transformed with a plasmid containing the PUS7 gene under the control of the PGal promoter. The closed squares represent the pus7Δ+U2-U40Δ strain transformed with the plasmid containing the PUS7 gene under the control of the PGal promoter. The closed diamonds represent the pus7Δ+U2-U40G strain that had been transformed with the plasmid containing the PUS7 gene under the control of the PGal promoter. The arrow indicates the time point at which the medium was switched from galactose to dextrose. B, U2 pseudouridylation was analyzed using three different strains, including the wild-type (lanes 1 and 2), pus7Δ+U2-U40G transformed with the PGal-PUS7-containing plasmid (lanes 3–5), and pus7Δ+U2-U40Δ transformed with the PGal-PUS7-containing plasmid (lanes 10–12). Total RNA was isolated from each of these strains before (lanes 3, 4, 10, and 11) and 18 h after (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 12) the medium was switched. The RNA was assayed for pseudouridylation by CMC modification followed by primer extension using a radiolabeled antisense U2 oligodeoxynucleotide (lanes 2, 4, 5, 11, and 12). Lanes 1, 3, and 10 are controls where CMC modification was omitted. The U2 RNA from pus7Δ+U2-U40G cells (lanes 6–9) or from pus7Δ+U2-U40Δ cells (lanes 13–16) was also sequenced and subjected to electrophoresis in parallel. The three pseudouridine stops/pauses are indicated by asterisks and arrows. Changes at position 40 in the sequencing lanes are boxed. C, pre-mRNA levels were measured by RT-PCR. Template total RNA used in the study was isolated from various yeast strains, including wild-type (WT) (lane 1), pus7Δ (lane 2), U2-U40Δ (lane 3), U2-U40G (lane 6), pus7Δ+U2-U40G transformed with the PGal-PUS7-containing plasmid (pPUS7-Gal; lanes 4 and 5), and pus7Δ+U2-U40Δ transformed with pPUS7-Gal (lanes 7 and 8). For the latter two strains, cells were first grown in galactose medium to the mid-log phase and then switched to YPD (dextrose medium). Total RNA was isolated before (lanes 4 and 7) and 18 h after (lanes 5 and 8) the medium was switched. Reverse transcription was primed with random hexamers, and PCR was performed using a pair of oligodeoxynucleotides (only the forward primer was radiolabeled) designed according to the sequences of the three different pre-mRNAs we analyzed, including RPL37A pre-mRNA (top panel), RPL13A pre-mRNA (middle panel), and RPL37B pre-mRNA (bottom panel). The intronless gene, HHF1, served as a control that was included in each analysis. The positions of RT-PCR products derived from respective pre-mRNAs/mRNA are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transformation and 5FOA Selection—Log phase DM2484 or DM2486 cells were collected and adjusted to 50 A600/ml in transformation buffer (40% (w/v) polyethylene glycol-3350, 0.1 m lithium acetate). The cells (20 μl) were mixed with 1 μl of carrier DNA (salmon sperm or calf thymus, 2 mg/ml). The resultant cell mixture then received ∼1 μg of one of the U2 mutant plasmids or pCAU2 as a control and was subsequently incubated at 45 °C for 30 min. The cell mixture was then immediately mixed with 150 μl of YPD and incubated at 30 °C for another hour before plating on solid medium lacking histidine. A single colony from the above plates was transferred to liquid SD–His synthetic medium (0.71% SD–His, 2% dextrose) and grown overnight at 30 °C. A fixed amount of cells (2 μl with 0.006 units of A600) were streaked on 5-FOA plates (SD–His, 1 mg/ml 5-FOA) and grown for 4 days at 18, 30, or 37 °C. The growth phenotypes were then analyzed (Fig. 2A). Temperature-sensitive strains (pus7Δ+U2-U40G and pus7Δ+U2-U40Δ) were selected, and a single colony of each mutant strain on the 18 °C plates was picked for growth in liquid YPD at 18 °C overnight. These cells, along with control cells, were either directly plated on solid YPD medium at various temperatures or first transformed with a plasmid containing wild-type U2 or PUS7 genes and then plated on solid YPD medium. We then assessed the ability of wild-type U2 or Pus7p to rescue the growth phenotype of the temperature-sensitive strains (Fig. 2B, pus7Δ+U2-U40G and pus7Δ+U2-U40Δ). Temperature-shift Assay—To analyze pre-mRNA splicing at higher temperatures, temperature-sensitive strains (pus7Δ+U2-U40G and pus7Δ+U2-U40Δ) as well as control strains were first grown in selective synthetic medium at 18 °C overnight. The cells were then switched to YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% dextrose, and 2% peptone) and grown at 18 °C until the A600 reached 1.0. At that point, the incubation temperature was changed to 37 °C. Cells were collected at various time points both before and after the temperature shift. Total RNA was extracted, and pre-mRNA splicing was analyzed by primer extension (see below). Conditional Depletion (Promoter Shutoff) Assay—Conditional depletion of Pus7p via promoter shutoff was also used to assess the effect of pus7Δ+U2-U40G and pus7Δ+U2-U40Δ on pre-mRNA splicing. Strains pus7Δ+U2-U40G and pus7Δ+U2-U40Δ, transformed with pPUS7-Gal (CEN URA3 PGAL10-PUS7), were grown in selective synthetic medium (0.71% SD–Ura, 2% galactose) at 30 °C overnight. The yeast cells were then switched to YPGAL (1% yeast extract, 2% galactose, 2% peptone) and grown at 30 °C until A600 reached 2.0–3.0. At this point, the yeast cells were pelleted and resuspended in YPD. At different time points after switching the medium, cell growth was monitored by A600, and a fraction of the cells was collected. Total RNA was extracted from these cells and analyzed for U2 pseudouridylation and pre-mRNA splicing. RNA Isolation—About 40 A600 units (∼20 ml of 2 OD/ml cells) of yeast cells were collected and resuspended in 0.4 ml of 1× RIB buffer (0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.01 m EDTA, 1% SDS). PCI-RIB (0.4 ml; phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (50:49:1) saturated with 1× RIB) and 0.4 cc of sterile acid-washed glass beads were added. The glass beads/cell mixture was vigorously agitated at high speed for 90 s three times, each of which was followed by a 30-s incubation on ice. The cell extracts were pelleted in a microfuge for 2 min, and the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and extracted again with 0.4 ml of PCI-RIB. Total RNA was precipitated with ethanol and subsequently treated with RNase-free DNase I (∼30 units). After PCI-RIB extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA-free total RNA was suitable for U2 pseudouridylation analysis and pre-mRNA measurements (via primer extension or RT-PCR). Pseudouridylation Assay—The U2 pseudouridylation assay was performed exactly as described previously (29Ma X. Zhao X. Yu Y.T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1889-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 43Bakin A. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9754-9762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, total RNA was modified with CMC (N-cyclohexyl-N′-(2-morpholinoethyl)-carbodiimide metho-p-toluolsufonate) at 37 °C for 20 min in a 30-μl reaction containing 10 μg of total RNA, 0.17 m CMC, 50 mm Bicine, pH 8.3, 4 mm EDTA, and 7 m urea. The modified RNA was then treated with sodium bicarbonate buffer (50 mm, pH 10.4) at 37 °C for 2 h. RNA was recovered by PCA extraction and ethanol precipitation and was subsequently subjected to primer-extension analysis using a 5′ 32P-radiolabeled oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to nucleotides 104–126 of S. cerevisiae U2. CMC modification-specific stops/pauses were visualized by autoradiography of 6% polyacrylamide/8 M urea gels. Primer Extension—Primer extension analysis was performed essentially as described (9Madhani H.D. Guthrie C.

A 10-μl mixture containing ∼10 μg of total yeast RNA, ∼0.1–0.5 pmol (∼0.5 × 106 cpm) 5′ 32P-radiolabeled antisense U5 primer (5′-AAGTTCCAAAAAATATGGCAAGC-3′), ∼0.1–0.5 pmol (∼0.5 × 106 cpm) of a 5′ 32P-radiolabeled pre-U3-specific primer (5′-TATAGAAATGATCCTACT-3′), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), and 250 mm KCl, was sequentially incubated at 95 °C for 2 min, 65 °C for 10 min, and room temperature for another 10 min. After incubation, a 10-μl extension mixture containing 48 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 0.8 mm dNTPs, 32 mm MgCl2, 16 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) was added, and primer extension was performed at 42 °C for 1 h. The extension products (180 nucleotides for U5, 188 for pre-U3A, and 160 for pre-U3B) were recovered by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation, resolved on 7% polyacrylamide-8 M urea gels, and visualized by autoradiography. RT-PCR—DNA-free total yeast RNA was used as a template for reverse transcription (RT). The reaction was performed for 1 h at 37°C in 20 μl containing 5 μg of DNA-free total RNA, 1× RT buffer (Promega), 0.5 mm dNTPs, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 μm random DNA hexamer, and 10 units of reverse transcriptase M-MLV (Promega). The cDNA was then amplified by PCR in two steps. In the first step, the reaction was performed in 15 μl containing 5% of the RT products, 1× PCR buffer (Invitrogen), 0.25 mm dNTPs, 10 pmol 5′- and 3′-primers (including 10,000 cpm of the 5′ 32P-radiolabeled 5′-primer) specific for the gene to be analyzed (see the primers below), and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). A total of 5 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min) was used, with the final cycle being followed by 72 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, a 5-μl mixture of 1× PCR buffer (Invitrogen), 0.25 mm dNTP, 10 pmol of 5′- and 3′-primers (including 10,000 cpm of the 5′ 32P-radiolabeled 5′-primer) for HHF1 (a control intronless gene) was added to the first step PCR reaction, and the second step PCR was performed totaling 20 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min). PCR products were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide/8 M urea gels and visualized by autoradiography. Under these conditions, the quantities of RT-PCR products were determined to be within the linear range. To detect RPL37B pre-mRNA, the 5′-primer, 5′-ATATAAGTAAAGA-TGGGTAG-3′, and the 3′-primer, 5′-TCATCAATGGCTCTGGCAA-3′, were used. RPL37A pre-mRNA was detected with the 5′-primer, 5′-AT-ATAGACAAAAATGGGTAG-3′, and the 3′-primer, 5′-TGATCCTTTCGA-GTTCCCT-3′. RPL13A pre-mRNA was detected using the 5′-primer, 5′-AGCAGGAATCGTACACAATG-3′, and the 3′-primer, 5′-GAAGACTCT-AACAATGAGTT-3′. An additional 5′-primer, 5′-CGGTAGAGGTAAAG-GTGGTAAAGG-3′, and 3′-primer, 5′-CTTTCTCTTGGCGTGTTCGGTG-TAGG-3′, were used to detect the control intronless HHF1 mRNA. pus7 Deletion (pus7Δ) Coupled with Point Mutations in U2 snRNA at Position 40 Yields Temperature-sensitive Yeast Strains—As we have previously demonstrated (29Ma X. Zhao X. Yu Y.T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1889-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), when incubated in a rich medium (YPD), the yeast pus7Δ strain, in which U2 pseudouridylation is completely blocked at position 35, shows no obvious growth defect phenotype (Fig. 2B, compare rows 1 and 2). To investigate the functional role of ψ35, we took advantage of a large collection of yeast U2 snRNAs, each containing a single point mutation near the branch site recognition region. Each of these U2-bearing plasmids was able to substitute for the yeast chromosomal U2 gene without compromising the healthy growth phenotype in rich media. These U2 mutants were combined with pus7Δ and selected for a synthetic growth defect phenotype. Briefly, we first created a yeast strain in which both the pus7 and U2 (SNR20) genes were deleted, and U2 was supplied by a plasmid containing a wild-type U2 gene and a URA3 selection marker (see “Experimental Procedures”). We then introduced each of the mutant U2 plasmids into the strain and streaked the cells on 5-FOA plates to select against the wild-type U2 plasmid via the URA3 marker. The yeast cells growing on 5-FOA should solely depend on the function of mutant U2 combined with pus7Δ. We screened a total of 35 different U2 mutations (Table I) and identified two temperature-sensitive strains. As shown in Fig. 2A, yeast cells with either pus7Δ alone or mutation/deletion at position 40 (U40Δ or U40G) in U2 alone grew normally and showed no obvious growth defect at all temperatures tested. In contrast, yeast cells carrying both pus7Δ and U2-U40Δ or U2-U40G mutation (pus7Δ+U2-U40G or pus7Δ+U2-U40Δ) grew well at 18 °C or 23 °C, poorly at 30 °C, and not at all at 37 °C.Table IU2 mutant plasmids used to screen synthetic growth defectsPlasmid sequential numberPosition in yeast U2Mutants assayed123U23A223U23C323U23G424U24A524U24C624U24G724U24D828U28A928U28C1028U28G1133U33A1233U33C1333U33G1433U33DaExhibits temperature-sensitive growth (fails to grow at 37 °C).1540U40A1640U40G1740U40D1842U42A1942U42C2042U42G2142U42D2245U45AbExhibits cold-sensitive growth (fails to grow at 16 °C).2345U45C2445U45GbExhibits cold-sensitive growth (fails to grow at 16 °C).2545U45D2647U47A2747U47C2847U47G2947U47D3048U48A3148U48C3248U48G3349U49A3449U49C3549U49Ga Exhibits temperature-sensitive growth (fails to grow at 37 °C).b Exhibits cold-sensitive growth (fails to grow at 16 °C). Open table in a new tab To confirm that the growth defect phenotypes were specifically associated with pus7Δ and the U2 point mutations, we introduced a plasmid containing PUS7 or a plasmid containing a wild-type U2 gene into the temperature-sensitive yeast strains and found that either plasmid rescued the temperature-sensitive growth phenotypes (Fig. 2B, compare rows 7 and 8 with row 6 and rows 11 and 12 with row 10). Taken together, these results suggest that pus7Δ coupled with a mutation/deletion at U40 in U2 yields temperature-sensitive synthetic lethality. Yeast Cells with pus7Δ and U2-U40Δ Are Defective in U3 Pre-RNA Splicing at 37 °C—Because U40 is located immediately downstream of the U2 branch site recognition sequence (Fig. 1), it is possible that mutation at this position, when combined with a blockade of pseudouridylation at position 35 (due to pus7Δ), results in a splicing defect, and thus the observed growth defect, at higher temperatures.

Ligand-independent activation is poorly understood, and dimerization alone is not sufficient for activation. ErbB receptors also form higher order oligomers, but the mechanism of oligomer formation and their contribution to signaling are not known. The kinase-deficient ErbB3 as well as its extracellular domains are particularly prone to ligand-independent oligomerization, and oligomers are destabilized by binding of the ligand heregulin. In contrast, ligand binding facilitates heterodimerization with ErbB2 and is expected to stabilize an extended conformation of the ErbB3 extracellular domain (ECD) in which the dimerization interface is exposed. In the absence of ligand, ErbB3 can adopt a closed conformation that is held together by an intramolecular tether.

Cross-linking and activation studies on membrane-embedded ErbB3/ErbB2 chimeras confirm this dual effect of heregulin.

Overexpression, especially of EGFR or ErbB2, has been observed in a variety of tumors (1Dougall W.C. Qian X. Greene M.I. J. Cell.

Controlled activation of these receptors requires binding of a ligand of the EGF or heregulin family of growth and differentiation factors, resulting in cross-phosphorylation of the dimerized receptors at specific tyrosines in the cytoplasmic portion. However, under conditions of overexpression, tyrosine phosphorylation occurs constitutively, and cells expressing elevated levels of ErbB2 show a more aggressive growth behavior (5Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G. Keith D.E. Levin W.J. Stuart S.G. Udove J. Ullrich A. Press M. Science. 1989; 244: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (6289) Google Scholar). Of the different pairs of receptor dimers that can form, the combination of ErbB2 and ErbB3 shows the strongest potency in terms of stimulating cell proliferation (6Rubin I. Yarden Y. Ann. Oncol. 2001; 12: 3-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Many tumors that show overexpression of ErbB2, especially those that are more prone to become resistant to conventional treatment, also show elevated levels of ErbB3 (7Chen X. Yeung T.K. Wang Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The ErbB2/ErbB3 dimer is unique in that ErbB2 has a potent cytoplasmic kinase domain, but its extracellular domains (ECD) fail to bind any known ligand directly (8Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A. Vandlen R.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14661-14665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Horan T.

On the other hand, the ECD of ErbB3 binds a variety of isoforms of heregulin, but its cytoplasmic kinase domain is catalytically deficient (10Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Another distinct feature of ErbB3 is its enhanced propensity to self-associate. Ligand-independent oligomerization, which is the formation of complexes of more than two receptors, can be observed for full-length ErbB3 as well as for the ErbB3-ECD. Oligomerization is not driven by ligand binding. Instead, oligomers are destabilized by the binding of heregulin, thereby favoring the formation of heterodimers with ErbB2 in the context of signaling (11Landgraf R. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8503-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The activation of ErbB receptors has traditionally been attributed to ligand-induced dimerization of the extracellular portions of the receptors.

These structures demonstrated that dimerization involves loops on domains two and four of each receptor ECD that interacts with their respective counterparts on a second receptor molecule. We refer to this interface below as the crystallographically defined dimer interface. The receptor interaction is modulated but not physically mediated by the ligand, which binds in a binding pocket on the outer faces of the symmetric dimer between domain one and three of each receptor (reviewed in Ref. 15Klein P. Mattoon D. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A crystallographically observed closed conformation of ErbB3-ECD, in which domains two and four interact instead within a single receptor monomer, was initially thought to represent a locked conformation, critical for preventing dimerization in the absence of ligand. The fact that ErbB2 failed to show such a locked conformation reconciled well with the observed enhanced autophosphorylation of overexpressed ErbB2 (16Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 158-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, although the closed ECD conformation is indeed incompatible with the receptor dimers observed for the open form, its prevalence and significance in suppressing basal activation have since been questioned (17Mattoon D. Klein P. Lemmon M.A. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Constitutively open mutants of EGFR show more high affinity binding sites for EGF but no significant increase in basal activation (17Mattoon D. Klein P. Lemmon M.A. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Walker F. Orchard S.G. Jorissen R.N. Hall N.E. Zhang H.-H. Hoyne P.A. Adams T.E. Johns T.G. Ward C. Garrett T.P.J.

Although ligand-bound dimers are at the core of ErbB activation, several lines of data suggest a more complex mechanism in which receptors can be associated prior to ligand binding with parts of the cytoplasmic portion and the transmembrane segment contributing to the interaction. Specifically, the presence of two GXXXG consensus motifs in the transmembrane span of ErbB receptors has been shown to provide intrinsic dimerization potential. ErbB3 is unique in its absence of a good GXXXG consensus, and its transmembrane span consequently shows the weakest tendency to self-associate (19Mendrola J.M. Berger M.B. King M.C. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ErbB2 transmembrane span dimerizes strongly, and ErbB2 shows enhanced constitutive activation if most of the extracellular domain is absent (20Di Fiore P.P. Pierce J.H. Kraus M.H. Segatto O. King C.R. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1987; 237: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 21Bargmann C.I. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5394-5398Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ECD, in the absence of ligand, acts to suppress the activity of intrinsically associated receptors. In addition, ErbB2 receptors can form large clusters of receptors on the cell surface. ErbB2 has been shown to form such clusters independent of its ligand-dependent association with ErbB3 or EGFR, especially in cells that overexpress ErbB2 (22Nagy P. Jenei A. Kirsch A.K. Szollosi J. Damjanovich S. Jovin T.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1733-1741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to ErbB3, the contributions of specific portions of the ECD of ErbB2 to these ligand-independent interactions are too weak to be biochemically studied in solution, and the role of such clusters in signaling is not clear. ErbB3 provides a good model system for the evaluation of higher order oligomers of ErbB receptors. In contrast to ErbB2 or EGFR, the oligomerization of ECDs can be studied in solution. The putative oligomerization interfaces in ErbB3 are likely to differ from those found in other ErbBs in the affinity of their respective interactions but are likely to be qualitatively conserved within this family of structurally highly homologous receptors. However, several aspects of ErbB3 self-association have not been conclusively answered, most importantly, the role of ligand binding in ErbB3 self-association. By using different approaches, ErbB3 has been reported to self-associate upon ligand binding (23Berezov A. Chen J. Liu Q. Zhang H.T. Greene M.I. Murali R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28330-28339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), not to homodimerize upon binding of ligand (24Berger M.B. Mendrola J.M. Lemmon M.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and we have previously demonstrated that oligomers or ErbB3 are disrupted by the binding of ligand (11Landgraf R. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8503-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because the crystal structure of the ECD of ErbB3 shows a closed conformation in which the high affinity ligand-binding pocket between domains one and three is disrupted (Fig. 1), the binding of ligand is expected to stabilize the extended form of the receptor over the closed conformation. For ErbB3, the presence of a closed and extended conformation and different association states means that the receptor exists in at least three different forms: oligomers, dimers, and monomers in either the closed or extended conformation. Based on the current models for the dimerization of ErbB receptors, the unlocking of the tether is expected to enhance dimerization. In the case of EGFR, unlocking of the tether provides a larger population of receptors that can transition to a high affinity form (18Walker F. Orchard S.G. Jorissen R.N. Hall N.E. Zhang H.-H. Hoyne P.A. Adams T.E. Johns T.G. Ward C. Garrett T.P.J. Zhu H.-J. Nerrie M. Scott A.M. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22387-22398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but for ErbB3 no significant stabilization has been observed upon binding of heregulin to homodimers of ErbB3/EGFR chimera carrying an ErbB3 ECD (24Berger M.B. Mendrola J.M. Lemmon M.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, the formation of symmetrical dimers does not readily explain the formation of larger order oligomers, which would require at least one additional interface. If the extended and ligand-binding form of the receptor takes part in both dimerization and oligomerization, an increase in oligomerization could be expected following ligand binding. However, this appears to be in contrast to our previous observation that the binding of ligand reduces oligomerization. The work presented here addresses the question of the conformation of ErbB3 and the nature of interfaces in the oligomeric state. Specifically, we evaluate the impact of a constitutively open conformation of the ECD on oligomerization. Our current findings indicate that oligomers are assembled from the extended form of the receptor ECD, and oligomerization involves two different types of interfaces. The extended form of ErbB3-ECDs can dimerize constitutively, and this dimerization interface is neither disrupted nor stabilized by ligand binding. A second interface is responsible for the subsequent oligomerization of ECD dimers. This second interface is subject to destabilization by heregulin. We confirmed this dual impact of heregulin on interactions of the ErbB3-ECD in a cellular context. Chimera of the ErbB3-ECD and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic portions of ErbB2 provide tyrosine phosphorylation as a readout for the formation of dimers in an activated conformation. Although the addition of heregulin greatly reduces cross-linking of this chimera, which is consistent with the destabilization of receptor clusters by heregulin, the remaining complexes in the presence of heregulin show greatly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation, confirming that heregulin does not stabilize ErbB3-ECD-mediated dimers but is fully consistent with the constitutively formed dimers assuming an activated conformation. Plasmids and Protein Purification—ErbB3-ECD cDNA was cloned into the pMT/BiP/V5-His expression vector (Invitrogen) as described previously (11Landgraf R. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8503-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The H565F point mutation and the C-terminal (S tag) epitope were generated by using a two-step PCR and were subsequently confirmed by sequencing. Drosophila S2 cells were cotransfected with the desired construct and the pCoHYGRO vector (Invitrogen) using Effectene reagent (Invitrogen). Stable cell lines were obtained after 3 weeks of selection with 300 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in serum-free media (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and induced with 500 μm CuSO4. The ECDs were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column chromatography as described previously (11Landgraf R. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8503-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 81 mm Na2HPO4, 14.7 mm KH2PO4), and judged >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. Glutathione S-transferase with a C-terminal S tag and a hexa-histidine tag (GST-S tag) was generated in the pGEX-3x expression vector (Invitrogen) by PCR, expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and purified as described above. Human heregulin-β1 was generated as a fusion protein to the C terminus of thioredoxin (trx-hrg) in the pET-32a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and expressed and purified from E. coli BL21 (DE3) as described above (25Landgraf R. Pegram M.D. Slamon D.J. Eisenberg D.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3220-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The trx-hrg fusion protein has binding properties to the ECD that are equivalent to the EGF-like domain of hrg and carries both an S tag and a hexa-histidine tag, facilitating purification and detection. For experiments that utilized S-tagged ECDs, recombinant EGF-like domains of hrg-β1 (R & D Systems) were used in binding studies instead of trx-hrg. Full-length recombinant heregulin-β1 was obtained from R & D Systems. Chimera of ErbB3 and ErbB2 were generated by PCR amplification of the extracellular region of ErbB3 and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic region of ErbB2, using the previously described full-length constructs (11Landgraf R. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8503-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as templates. The chimera and full-length ErbB2 were initially cloned into the pIND expression vector (Invitrogen), and the upstream ecdysone control region in this vector was subsequently exchanged for a tetyracycline control region (pTRE2, BD Biosciences) to obtain higher expression levels. The corresponding constructs are referred to below as pIND-TRE based vectors. ErbB3-ECD Pull Down—S-protein-agarose (Novagen) was blocked with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml, New England Biolabs) for 15 min and washed with PBS. S tag ECDs were preincubated in PBS for 15 min at room temperature at a final concentration of 0.50 μm. The total of 1 × 10-10 mol was subsequently immobilized on the bovine serum albumin-blocked S-protein-agarose resin (equivalent of 50 μl of initial S-protein resin suspension) by incubation for 30 min at room temperature. GST-S tag served as a negative control and was immobilized at 0.50 μm (1 × 10-10 mol total) as described above. The samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 1000 × g, and unbound S tag ECDs or GST-S tag were removed by two washes with S tag wash buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5). ErbB3-ECD constructs with the V5 epitope were subsequently added to the resin at 250 nm (6 × 10-11 mol total) and incubated for 1 h with agitation at room temperature. The resin suspension was transferred to a 15-ml conical tube, diluted to 10 ml with ice-cold S tag wash buffer, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min, and 9.9 ml of the wash buffer was removed and replaced with fresh S tag wash buffer. This process was repeated three times. The remaining resin from the final wash was heated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl, 10% w/v glycerol, 3% w/v SDS, 2.4 mm bromphenol blue, 52 mm dithiothreitol) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The samples were run on 4–15% gradient gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to PVDF membranes (Pierce), and probed with anti-V5 antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Invitrogen). For the detection of the immobilized S tag ECD, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with S-protein conjugated with HRP (Novagen). ErbB3 Pull Down with Pretreated Immobilized ECDs—Pull-down experiments were carried out as described above. For the pretreatment with urea, the immobilization step was carried out overnight in the presence of 2 m urea in order to ensure an even distribution of bound (monomeric) ECDs. For pretreatment with heregulin, the ErbB3-ECD constructs containing the S tag epitope were coincubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 5-fold molar excess of recombinant human heregulin-β1 peptide (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). The urea and free heregulin were subsequently removed together with the nonimmobilized ECDs by centrifugation and three PBS washes, respectively. Heregulin Elution—S-protein-agarose was prepared as above and incubated with ErbB3-ECD constructs containing the S tag epitope at 250 nm for 1 h at room temperature. Any unbound ECDs were removed by washing with S tag wash buffer. After the immobilization of the ECDs, we saturated free S tag-binding sites on the resin with excess GST-S tag, and we washed the resin twice with PBS to remove excess GST and ECDs that were potentially displaced by the free GST-S tag. Following washes, the immobilized ECDs were incubated for 15 min with PBS, EGF (1 mm, R&D Systems), heregulin-β1 peptide (1 mm, R&D systems), or SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After removal of the heregulin-eluted ECDs, the resin was treated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer to elute all remaining ECDs. The samples were run on 4–15% gradient gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to PVDF membranes (Pierce), and probed with S-protein conjugated with HRP (Novagen). Chemical Cross-linking—ErbB3-ECD and ErbB2-ECD constructs with the V5 epitope were diluted with PBS or PBS containing a 5-fold molar excess of trx-hrg at a final ECD concentration of 100 and 10 nm, respectively. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, a 100-fold molar excess of bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3, Pierce) was added to each construct, and samples were incubated for an additional 2 h at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was quenched with Tris base (1 m) and spermidine (100 mm). Samples were run on 4–15% gradient gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to PVDF membranes (Pierce), and probed with anti-V5-HRP (Invitrogen) or anti-penta-his-HRP (Qiagen). Cross-linking and Activation of ErbB3/ErbB2 Chimera—CHO/dhfr- cells (ATCC) were stably transfected with a Tet-Off control plasmid that also contains tetracycline-controlled puromycin resistance (26Era T. Wong S. Witte O.N. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 185: 83-95PubMed Google Scholar). Stable CHO/Tet-Off cells were transiently transfected with pIND-TRE-based constructs harboring either V5 epitope-tagged ErbB2, ErbB3/ErbB2 chimera, or ErbB3(H565F)/ErbB2 chimera. Transfections were carried out using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). For tyrosine phosphorylation assays, cells were incubated in serum-free α-modification of Eagle's medium for 16–24 h post-transfection Cells were stimulated with 10 nm heregulin-β1 EGF domain (R&D Systems) in serum-free α-minimum Eagle's medium for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Total protein concentrations of the lysates were measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Equivalent amounts of lysates were separated on 4–15% gradient gels, transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed as indicated in Fig. 7 with either anti-V5-HRP (Invitrogen), anti-Neu (C-18) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-phospho-ErbB2 (Tyr-1248) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), followed by goat anti-rabbit HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For cellular cross-linking studies, the transiently transfected and serum-starved cells were stimulated with 10 nm heregulin-β1 in serum-free α-modification of Eagle's medium for 15 min at room temperature. After washing away excess heregulin with PBS-Mg (PBS, 10 mm MgCl2), the cells were incubated with 100 μm of the membrane-impermeable cross-linker BS3 in PBS-Mg for 2 h at 4 °C. The cross-linker was washed away and quenched with 150 mm Tris base. Cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blot as described above. Gas-phase Electrophoretic Mobility Molecular Analysis (GEMMA)— The details of the GEMMA instrumentation and the method for measuring protein size have been described elsewhere (27Bacher G.

Biochem. 1998; 259: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, the GEMMA instrument (TSI Inc., St. Paul, MN) consists of an electrospray ionization (ESI) unit with a neutralizing chamber, a differential mobility analyzer, and a condensation particle counter. The differential mobility analyzer voltage was scanned, and data were recorded by Aerosol Instrument Manager software (TSI Inc). Stock solutions of wild-type ErbB3-ECD (1.8 μm), ErbB-H565F-ECD (1.1 μm), ErbB2-ECD (0.55 μm), and trx-hrg (10.0 μm) were dialyzed in 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.4. After adjustments for volume changes during dialysis, samples were subjected to analysis by GEMMA. Protein solutions were introduced via the ESI source at a flow rate of ∼70 nl/min. Each sample concentration was run at least three times. The Extended Conformation of the ECD Forms Oligomers— In order to evaluate the contribution of the extended form of ErbB3-ECD to oligomerization, we generated a constitutively extended form of the ECD by mutating a key residue in its intramolecular tether. The crystal structure of the closed form of the ErbB3-ECD identifies several key residues that are critical for the stabilization of the intramolecular tether between domains two and four. Mutation of any of these key residues will break critical hydrogen bonds that stabilize the tether, and mutations in the analogous positions in EGFR have been used to generate a constitutively open conformation (17Mattoon D.

Histidine 565 is located in domain four and engages in a hydrogen bond with glutamine 252 of domain two as part of the intramolecular tether (Fig. 1). Phenylalanine is the residue corresponding to His-565 in ErbB2. ErbB2-ECD is structurally highly homologous to ErbB3-ECD but does not form the intramolecular tether (30Cho H.S. Mason K. Ramyar K.X. Stanley A.M. Gabelli S.B. Denney D.W. Leahy D.J. Nature. 2003; 412: 756-760Crossref Scopus (1239) Google Scholar), based on the crystal structure of the ErbB2-ECD. An equivalent mutation that unlocks the intramolecular tether in EGFR has been evaluated recently and shown not to disturb receptor stability and surface presentation (17Mattoon D. Klein P.

ErbB3-ECD (H565F) expresses well in S2 insect cells at levels comparable with the wild-type ECD, and we will now refer to this extended mutant form of the receptor ECD as H565F. Next, we addressed whether the destabilization of the intramolecular tether results in enhanced self-association of purified ECDs. Compared with the ligand-stabilized dimers of full-length and membrane-embedded receptors, the in vitro interactions of the ECDs in solution are significantly less stable, and oligomers tend to easily dissociate during analysis. In order to reproducibly and specifically detect the transient inte"

In this study we have employed the inability of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gpd1Δ gpd2Δ mutant both to produce glycerol and to adapt to high osmolarity to study solute transport through aquaglyceroporins and the control of osmostress-induced signaling. High levels of different polyols, including glycerol, inhibited growth of the gpd1Δ gpd2Δ mutant. This growth inhibition was suppressed by expression of the hyperactive allele Fps1-Δ1 of the osmogated yeast aquaglyceroporin, Fps1. The degree of suppression correlated with the relative rate of transport of the different polyols tested. Transport studies in secretory vesicles confirmed that Fps1-Δ1 transports polyols at increased rates compared with wild type Fps1. Importantly, wild type Fps1 and Fps1-Δ1 showed similarly low permeability for water. The growth defect on polyols in the gpd1Δ gpd2Δ mutant was also suppressed by expression of a heterologous aquaglyceroporin, rat AQP9. We surmised that this suppression was due to polyol influx, causing the cells to passively adapt to the stress. Indeed, when aquaglyceroporin-expressing gpd1Δ gpd2Δ mutants were treated with glycerol, xylitol, or sorbitol, the osmosensing HOG pathway was activated, and the period of activation correlated with the apparent rate of polyol uptake. This observation supports the notion that deactivation of the HOG pathway is closely coupled to osmotic adaptation. Taken together, our “conditional” osmotic stress system facilitates studies on aquaglyceroporin function and reveals features of the osmosensing and signaling system.

This observation supports the notion that deactivation of the HOG pathway is closely coupled to osmotic adaptation. Taken together, our “conditional” osmotic stress system facilitates studies on aquaglyceroporin function and reveals features of the osmosensing and signaling system. Osmoregulation is a fundamental biological process that controls cellular water content and turgor pressure. The accumulation of compatible solutes is a well conserved strategy in osmoregulation, although the solute accumulated differs between organisms (1Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3031) Google Scholar). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae employs glycerol, whose production and transmembrane flux are tightly controlled by osmotic changes (2Hohmann S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 300-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). In this work we have developed a “conditional osmotic stress” system in which a yeast mutant unable to produce glycerol is stressed by the addition of polyols and allowed to adapt by expression of aquaglyceroporins mediating polyol influx into the cell. We use this experimental set-up to illustrate that (i) different polyols can serve as osmostress agents as well as compatible solutes, (ii) to study polyol transport through aquaglyceroporins, and (iii) to probe the feedback mechanisms of the osmosensing/osmosignaling system. Glycerol is produced in yeast from the glycolytic intermediate dihydroxyacetonephosphate in two steps that are catalyzed by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpd) and glycerol-3-phosphatase (Gpp), respectively. Both enzymes exist in two isoforms, Gpd1 and Gpd2 as well as Gpp1 and Gpp2. Deletion of GPD1 and GPD2 or GPP1 and GPP2 abolishes glycerol production and causes strong osmosensitivity (3Larsson K.

Silva-Graca M. Lucas C. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2577-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) but does not normally contribute to osmoadaptation in S. cerevisiae (10Holst B. Lunde C. Lages F. Oliveira R. Lucas C. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 108-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Rather, intracellular glycerol levels are controlled by passive glycerol export, which is mediated by Fps1 (2Hohmann S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 300-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar, 11Luyten K. Albertyn J. Skibbe W.F. Prior B.A. Ramos J. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S.

Acta. 2003; 1613: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Upon a hyperosmotic shock the transport capacity of Fps1 is rapidly diminished to ensure that glycerol is maintained inside the cell (2Hohmann S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 300-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar, 11Luyten K. Albertyn J. Skibbe W.F. Prior B.A. Ramos J. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1360-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). A specific domain within the N-terminal extension of Fps1 is needed to restrict glycerol transport, and deletion of this domain renders Fps1 hyperactive (12Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C.W. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol.

Yeast cells that express this hyperactive Fps1, Fps1-Δ1, fail to retain glycerol and hence are sensitive to high external osmolarity. Upon a hypo-osmotic shock Fps1 rapidly releases glycerol to prevent excessive cell swelling. Therefore, mutants lacking Fps1 are sensitive to hypo-osmotic shock (12Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C.W. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol.

Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 425-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 16Hohmann S. Nielsen S. Agre P. Aquaporins. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2001Google Scholar) and hence can mediate passive glycerol flux in both directions. MIP channels, now referred to as aquaporins, occur in all groups of organisms ranging from archea to humans and play important roles in mediating and controlling water and solute fluxes across cells and tissues (16Hohmann S. Nielsen S. Agre P. Aquaporins. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2001Google Scholar). Aquaglyceroporins have been shown to transport a range of compounds including polyols, urea, and even metalloids (17Sanders O.I. Rensing C. Kuroda M. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3365-3367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M.

In yeast, hyperosmotic stress is sensed and signaled by the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) 1The abbreviations used are: HOG, high osmolarity glycerol; HA, hemagglutinin; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; CF, carboxyfluorescein. pathway, an elaborate mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction system (2Hohmann S.

The activity of the pathway can be monitored by immunological determination of the level of phosphorylated Hog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase or by the mRNA level of target genes such as GRE2. Using such markers of HOG pathway activity, it has been demonstrated that a hyperosmotic shock leads to transient activation of the pathway. Negative regulation of the HOG pathway is exerted by protein phosphatases (2Hohmann S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 300-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar, 20de Nadal E.

Studies on mutants unable either to produce or retain glycerol or to accumulate glycerol faster than wild type have indicated that deactivation of the HOG pathway correlates with glycerol accumulation and hence successful adaptation (7Siderius M.

The HOG pathway controls glycerol production at at least two levels. First, Hog1 activates the enzyme phosphofructo-2-kinase, leading to stimulation of glycolytic flux and enhanced glycerol production (24Dihazi H. Kessler R. Eschrich K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23961-23968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, Hog1 mediates enhanced expression of the genes GPD1 and GPP2 (4Albertyn J. Hohmann S.

In this work we make use of the osmosensitive gpd1Δ gpd2Δ mutant as well as the hyperactive Fps1-Δ1. Expression of Fps1-Δ1, or rat AQP9, a mammalian aquaglyceroporin, suppresses the growth defect of the gpd1Δ gpd2Δ mutant in the presence of high concentrations of polyols that can be transported by Fps1-Δ1 or AQP9. This has allowed us to establish an experimental “conditional osmotic stress” system to study polyol transport and osmosignaling.

Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing a URA3-marked vector (pCu426) (28Labbe S. Thiele D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 306: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) to drive the copper-inducible, high level expression of hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged FPS1 or FPS1-Δ1. YEpmyc-FPS1 is a 2μ LEU2 plasmid expressing a c-myc epitope-tagged Fps1, and YEp-mycFPS1-Δ1 mediates expression of a truncated, hyperactive Fps1-Δ1, which lacks amino acids 12–231 (12Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C.W. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The rat AQP9 gene (kindly provided by S. Nielsen) was amplified by PCR and inserted between the EcoRI and SmaI sites of the pYX242 vector (multi-copy 2μ vector, constitutive TPI1 promoter, HA tag). The construct was confirmed by sequencing. Growth Conditions—Yeast cells were grown in 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose (YPD). Selection and growth of transformants was performed in synthetic medium (YNB, 2% glucose) (29Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983Google Scholar). For growth assays cells were pregrown for 2 days on YNB plates and resuspended in YNB to A600 nm = 0.4, and 5 μl of a 10-fold dilution series were spotted onto agar plates supplemented with osmotica as indicated. Growth was monitored for 2–7 days in 30 °C. For growth curves the cells were pregrown in YNB for 24 h. The cells were adjusted to A600 nm = 0.15 in 350 μl of YNB supplemented with compounds as indicated and transferred to Bioscreen plates (30Warringer J. Blomberg A. Yeast. 2003; 20: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The cells were grown at 30 °C with agitation for 60 s every second minute. The A600 nm values were automatically recorded at 20-min intervals. Polyol Transport in Whole Yeast Cells—The cells were harvested by centrifugation in mid-exponential phase, washed, and suspended in ice-cold MES buffer (10 mm MES, pH 6.0) to 60 mg/ml. 30 μl of unlabeled polyol solution was mixed with 0.5 μCi of [14C]glycerol, [3H]xylitol, or [3H]sorbitol respectively in MES buffer and added to 20 μl of cell suspension to give a final polyol concentration of 100 mm. The reactions were stopped at 15, 30, and 60 s by transferring the cells to ice-cold water and collecting them on filters. Radioactivity was monitored in a scintillation counter. The samples for dry weight were collected on filters and dried at 80 °C. The initial uptake rates were determined by the slope. For each value the average value obtained with transformants carrying the corresponding empty plasmid was subtracted. Presented is the average of at least four individual experiments. Membrane Preparation and Western Blot Analysis of rAQP9 —Transformed cells were harvested in mid-exponential phase, washed (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m sucrose, 2.5 mm EDTA), and resuspended in homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The cells were disrupted in a Fast-prep (BIO101) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, protease inhibitor mixture), 50 μg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted (Hybond-ECL; Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline Tween 20, 5% milk and probed for 1.5 h with 1:2,000 diluted anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science), washed, and incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Promega), diluted 1:2,500) in phosphate-buffered saline Tween 20, 5% milk. The membranes were incubated with Lumi-Light for detection. Western Blot Analysis of Hog1—The cells were prepared as described previously (31Tamás M.J. Rep M. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For AQP9, cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase and were subsequently stressed with polyols. The samples were rapidly cooled in a dry ice/ethanol bath. The cells were resuspended in loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20 mm mercaptoethanol, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, Protease inhibitor (Complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor mixture tablets; Roche Applied Science)) and thereafter boiled at 100 °C for 10 min. The filters were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20. The antibody recognizing the dually phosphorylated Hog1 (phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Thr180/Tyr182); Cell Signaling) was diluted 1:1000 in 5% bovine serum albumin dissolved in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20, and the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C. An antibody against total Hog1 was used as a loading control (yC-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and was diluted 1:200 in 5% milk, Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20. The membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, Cell signaling; and donkey horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used in 1:2000 and 1:1500 dilutions, respectively. The Lumi-Light Western blotting Substrate (Roche Applied Science) as well as the FUJIFILM LAS-1000 camera was used for visualization. Northern Blot Analysis—RNA extraction and electrophoresis were performed as described previously (32De Winde J.H. Crauwels M. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Winderickx J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). PCR fragments of the GRE2 open reading frame and the 18 S RNA were prepared from genomic DNA template using primers with the following sequences (listed 5′ to 3′): GRE2, TTCAGGTGCTAACGGGTTCA and AATTTGGGAGGCAGTGTCGT; and 18 S RNA, CTATCAACTTTCGATGGTAGG and TATGGTTAAGACTACGACGGT. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Megaprime kit (Amersham Biosciences) purified on Nick columns (Amersham Biosciences) and employed with an activity of 1,000,000 cpm/ml. To detect and quantify signals the Molecular Imager FX, the Exposure cassette K (Bio-Rad) and the Quantity One software v 4.2.3 (Bio-Rad) were used. 18 S RNA was used to normalize transcript levels. Water and Solute Transport Measurements—Yeast cells defective for the fusion of terminal secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane (sec6) at a nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C were first grown at 26 °C to a final A600 nm of ∼1.0 in synthetic complete medium lacking uracil (see above) to maintain the wild type or mutant FPS1 expression vector. Copper sulfate was added to a final concentration of 100 μm, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C with shaking for another 2 h. The cells were harvested, washed, and converted to spheroplasts as described (33Brodsky J.L. Hamamoto S. Feldheim D. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Carboxyfluorescein (CF)-loaded secretory vesicles were prepared as published (34Coury L.A. Zeidel M.L. Brodsky J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 306: 169-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 35Coury L.A. Mathai J.C. Prasad G.V. Brodsky J.L. Agre P. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F34-F42PubMed Google Scholar) and washed three times by centrifugation at 144,000 × g to remove unincorporated CF. Water transport was measured by stopped flow fluorescence as described previously (35Coury L.A. Mathai J.C. Prasad G.V. Brodsky J.L. Agre P. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F34-F42PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the vesicles were subjected to an abrupt doubling of external osmotic pressure, and the time course of vesicle shrinkage was monitored as a decrease in fluorescence intensity. The time course of volume change was fitted to a single exponential, and the osmotic water permeability was calculated as described (36Zeidel M.L. Ambudkar S.V. Smith B.L. Agre P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7436-7440Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The transport of other polyols was measured after loading vesicles with the indicated polyol in a 1 m solution for 30 min, and the efflux of each polyol was monitored as a decrease in CF-mediated fluorescence over time after the vesicles were rapidly mixed into an iso-osmolar solution lacking the polyol. The permeability coefficients of various sugars were computed from a single exponential fit, as described (37Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) using equations formulated for each osmotic gradient (dVrel/dt = (Psolute)(SAV)(0.000763)(1611/Vrel-2117)). The vesicle size (to calculate the surface area of the vesicle (SAV)) was measured by laser light scattering using a DynaPro particle sizer. Expression of Hyperactive Fps1 Suppresses the Growth Defect of the gpd1Δ gpd2Δ Mutant on Polyols—A gpd1Δ gpd2Δ double mutant is unable to produce glycerol and hence does not grow in the presence of 0.8 m NaCl (6Ansell R. Granath K. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Adler L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2179-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Growth was also inhibited in the presence of 2 m glycerol or 1 m erythritol, ribitol, xylitol, mannitol, or sorbitol (Fig. 1, A and B). When transformed with a plasmid mediating expression of hyperactive Fps1-Δ1, the wild type strain grew poorly on 0.8 m NaCl (Fig. 1A) because it was unable to retain glycerol inside the cell (12Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C.W. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The Fps1-Δ1-expressing gpd1Δ gpd2Δ double mutant grew almost like wild type in the presence of 2 m glycerol and 1 m erythritol, ribitol, and xylitol (Fig. 1A). In other words, Fps1-Δ1 suppressed the growth defect of the gpd1Δ gpd2Δ double mutant on medium with high concentrations of polyols of five or fewer carbon atoms. Growth curves in liquid culture (Fig. 2) both confirmed and added further insight to the observed pattern. Wild type and gpd1Δ gpd2Δ mutant grew equally well in synthetic growth medium (YNB). As expected, the gpd1Δ gpd2Δ mutant did not grow in medium containing 0.8 m NaCl, irrespective of the plasmid it contained. Growth of the wild type was reduced when transformed with hyperactive Fps1-Δ1, as explained above. Interestingly, the effects conferred by polyols were less severe in liquid medium than on plates. Growth on 2 m glycerol resulted in a lag phase for the gpd1Δ gpd2Δ mutant, which was suppressed by hyperactive Fps1-Δ1 (not shown). In a similar manner, xylitol caused a lag phase and slower growth for the gpd1Δ gpd2Δ mutant, but when expressing hyperactive Fps1-Δ1 the growth profile was similar to that of wild type (Fig. 2). Hyperactive Fps1-Δ1 allowed some growth even in the presence of mannitol (not shown) or sorbitol, although to a much lesser extent than in xylitol-containing medium (Fig. 2). However, hyperactive Fps1-Δ1 caused a growth inhibition in wild type cells grown in the presence of sorbitol, probably because sorbitol uptake could not fully compensate for the simultaneous glycerol loss (see below for a description of relative uptake rates). Because the Fps1-Δ1-expressing gpd1Δ gpd2Δ mutant grew in the presence of 1 m sorbitol or mannitol in liquid medium but not on plates, we tested plate growth with lower polyol concentrations. Indeed, at 0.75 m sorbitol or mannitol, Fps1-Δ1 suppressed the growth defect of the gpd1Δ gpd2Δ mutant. At 0.5 m, the vector control grew slowly, and this growth was clearly improved by expression of Fps1-Δ1. Hence, Fps1-Δ1 weakly suppressed the growth defect of the gpd1Δ gpd2Δ mutant in the presence of sorbitol and mannitol. Fps1-mediated Polyol Transport—We surmised that suppression of the growth defect of the gpd1Δ gpd2Δ mutant by expression of Fps1-Δ1 was due to influx of polyols, resulting in equilibration across the plasma membrane and relief from osmostress. Influx of polyols may be more effective in liquid medium than on plates because cells are fully surrounded by medium. Indeed, the extent to which Fps1-Δ1 suppressed the growth defect of the gpd1Δ gpd2Δ mutant seemed to correlate well with the reported relative transport rates for these substrates through aquaglyceroporins (18Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). To directly measure transport rate, the uptake of three commercially available radiolabeled polyols, glycerol, xylitol, and sorbitol, was monitored (Fig. 3). Fps1-Δ1 transported glycerol with a relatively high rate, whereas wild type Fps1 mediated only moderate glycerol transport, as observed previously (12Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C.W. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6337-6345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Fps1-Δ1 also mediated xylitol uptake, although at a clearly lower rate than glycerol uptake, whereas transport of sorbitol was barely detectable. Wild type Fps1 did not mediate detectable uptake of xylitol or sorbitol in this assay. Hence, Fps1-Δ1 mediates uptake of glycerol, xylitol, and sorbitol with progressively decreasing rates. Purified and reconstituted Fps1 is so far not available. To study transport through Fps1 and Fps1-Δ1 in a more defined system, we purified secretory vesicles from a sec6 mutant (expressing Fps1 or Fps1-Δ1) following a shift to restrictive temperature, which induces vesicle accumulation. Such vesicles indeed contained the proteins (Fig. 4A), and secretory vesicles for further functional studies were isolated at the time point at which expression was maximal. Transport assays were performed by monitoring the kinetics of osmotic shrinkage of polyol and CF loaded vesicles upon dilution into an iso-osmolar buffer lacking the polyol. Polyol efflux causes fluorescence quenching of CF. Using this system, we found that wild type Fps1 mediated glycerol transport as well as transport of xylitol and ribitol, although the two pentiols were transported at a rate ∼1 order of magnitude lower than glycerol (Fig. 4B). Moreover, Fps1-Δ1 mediated an ∼2–3-fold higher transport rate than wild type Fps1 for all substrates tested. Hence, these data confirmed and were fully consistent with the data obtained using whole yeast cells. For Fps1 to function properly as an osmogated glycerol channel in osmoregulation it would be important not to transport significant amounts of water simultaneously. The yeast vesicle system allowed testing of whether Fps1 facilitates water transport. For this, osmotic shrinkage of vesicles containing Fps1 or Fps1-Δ1 was compared with that of secretory vesicles containing AQP1, which is specific for water transport (15Borgnia M. Nielsen S. Engel A. Agre P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 425-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). We first found that AQP1 mediated significant water transport (Fig. 4C), as described previously (35Coury L.A. Mathai J.C. Prasad G.V. Brodsky J.L. Agre P. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F34-F42PubMed Google Scholar), whereas neither Fps1 nor Fps1-Δ1 mediated significant water uptake. Hence, it appears that Fps1 mediates no or"

Liu P.Z. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 90-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Rh and RhAG are expressed on red cells only, where they define the core of the Rh membrane complex, which also includes the unrelated accessory chains CD47, LW/ICAM-4, and GPB (2Cartron J.P. Bailliere's Best Pract. Res. Clin. Haematol. 1999; 12: 655-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 3Avent N.D. Reid M.E. Blood. 2000; 95: 375-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, RhBG and RhCG are not expressed in erythroid tissues but are both expressed in kidney and differentially in other organs as follows: testis, brain, pancreas, and prostate for RhCG and liver, skin, and ovary for RhBG (4Liu Z.

Primary structure homology (30–35%) with the methylammonium-ammonium permease/ammonia transporters (Mep/Amt) from the lower organisms and plants has raised the possibility that Rh, RhAG, RhBG, and RhCG should represent the mammalian members of an Amt/Mep/Rh superfamily of ammonium transporters (1Huang C.H.

Accordingly, ammonium ((NH4+) and/or NH3) transport capacity of RhAG, RhBG, and RhCG has been demonstrated in different heterologous expression systems (8Marini A.M. Matassi G. Raynal V. Andre B.

Moreover, recent ammonium transport analysis performed in red blood cells from human and mouse genetic variants with Rh and/or RhAG deficiencies indicated that RhAG facilitates NH3 movement across the red blood cell membrane and thus represents a potential example of gas transporter in mammalian cells (12Ripoche P.

Supporting this finding, three-dimensional structure elucidation and transport experiments in an acellular model demonstrated that bacterial AmtB is a channel that conducts uncharged NH3 (13Khademi S. O'Connell III, J. Remis J. Robles-Colmenares Y. Miercke L.J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2004; 305: 1587-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Rh proteins also represent, at least in red blood cells, important structural components of the cell membrane, as first evidenced by the morphological abnormalities (stomato-spherocytosis) of Rhnull red cells that lack Rh and/or RhAG (2Cartron J.P. Bailliere's Best Pract. Res. Clin. Haematol. 1999; 12: 655-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated recently that the Rh complex constitutes, as the previously described AE1-protein 4.2-ankyrin and GPC-protein 4.1-p55 complexes (14Bhattacharyya R. Das A.K. Moitra P.K.

The Rh complex interacts with the erythrocyte skeleton through direct binding of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tails of Rh and RhAG with the second repeat subdomain (D2) of the membrane binding domain of ankyrin-R (18Nicolas V.

Based on these results and on the observation that expression of Rh proteins and AE1 (type 1 anion exchanger) is collectively decreased in ankyrin-R-deficient erythrocytes, we proposed a model of the Rh-AE1 macrocomplex described by Bruce et al. (19Bruce L.J. Beckmann R. Ribeiro M.L. Peters L.L. Chasis J.A. Delaunay J. Mohandas N. Anstee D.J. Tanner M.J.

Ankyrins constitute a family of membrane adaptor proteins that link diverse membrane-associated proteins (ions channels and cell adhesion molecules) to the spectrin-based membrane skeleton. In vertebrates, three different genes Ank1, Ank2, and Ank3 encode ankyrin-R, ankyrin-B, and ankyrin-G, respectively. Ankyrin-R expression is restricted to erythrocytes, neurons, and striated muscle; ankyrin-B is broadly expressed and represents the major form in the nervous system, and ankyrin-G is the most widely distributed species and is predominant in epithelial cells (20Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). These last two forms are not found in red cells. In nonerythroid cells, the structural role of RhBG and RhCG has not been evaluated yet. However, their interactions with other membrane proteins and especially with cytoskeletal proteins are expected to be important for their correct location in functional membrane microdomains. We and others have shown that the epithelial expression of RhBG and RhCG in the kidney is restricted to the cells involved in ammonium secretion (connecting tubule and collecting duct) and that both proteins are expressed in the same cell types but with opposite polarity; RhBG is localized at the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane and RhCG at the apical domain (21Eladari D.

However, considering the erythroid Rh-ankyrin R complex discussed above and previous observations (24Peters L.L. John K.M. Lu F.M. Eicher E.M. Higgins A. Yialamas M. Turtzo L.C. Otsuka A.J. Lux S.E.

In this study, we analyzed the sorting and tethering of RhBG to the basolateral membrane of renal epithelial cells. We identify both cis determinants required for the targeting of RhBG and the trans factor(s) necessary for its anchorage into the membrane. Materials—Primers used in PCR and mutagenesis experiments were from MWG Biotec (Ebersberg, Germany). The QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit was provided by Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The pcDNA3 vector was purchased from Invitrogen. The pGBKT7 and pGADT7 vectors were from the Matchmaker Gal4 Two-hybrid System 3 (Clontech). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of human RhBG (RhBG-Cter) and affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal domain of human ankyrin-B were described previously (22Quentin F.

Construction of RhBG Mammalian Expression Vectors and Mutagenesis—Full-length cDNA encoding RhBG was amplified by PCR from human kidney Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech) by using published information (5Liu Z. Peng J. Mo R. Hui C. Huang C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1424-1433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), sequenced on both strands using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystem, Warrington, UK), and subcloned in a pcDNA3 expression vector. The mutated RhBG cDNAs Y429A/E430A/D431A/Q432A, Y429A, E430A, D431A, Q432A, F419A/L420A/D421A, and Y429A+F419A/L420A/D421A were constructed by in vitro mutagenesis from pcDNA3-RhBG double strand recombinant DNA according to the supplier's instructions (Stratagene). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Flow Cytometric Analysis—Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Glutamax I (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Stable MDCK transfectants expressing wild-type and mutated RhBG proteins were obtained after transfection with the relevant expression vectors using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) and selection in culture medium supplemented with 0.6 mg/ml neomycin (Geneticin, Invitrogen). RhBG-positive cells were detected by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), after permeabilization/fixation by 50% ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and staining with rabbit polyclonal anti-RhBG-Cter (1:500), as primary antibody, and donkey anti-rabbit phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragments (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) as secondary antibody. Stable clones expressing RhBG were obtained after limiting dilutions, and at least two clones of each transfectant were grown and subsequently analyzed. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy on RhBG-expressing MDCK Cells—Subconfluent or confluent monolayers of MDCK transfectants were cultured on 12-mm diameter poly-l-lysine coverslips (BD Biosciences) for 3 days or 12-mm diameter Transwell polycarbonate membranes (pore size, 0.4 μm) (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) for 7 days, respectively, prior to immunostaining. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and washed in PBS. Free aldehyde groups were blocked by 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min, and cells were then washed in PBS and permeabilized in 1% SDS for 15 min. After two washings in PBS, cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-RhBG-Cter antibody (1:500) and, for some experiments, with murine anti-ankyrin-G (2.5 μg/ml) or anti-ZO-1 (4 μg/ml) mAbs diluted in background reducing buffer (Dako Corp., Copenhagen, Denmark) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and, for ankyrin-G or ZO-1 staining, Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) diluted 1:200 in PBS/bovine serum albumin. Samples were examined by wide field (poly-l-lysine coverslips) or confocal (Transwell membranes) microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope equipped with a 60× oil immersion objective NA 1.4 and a D-Eclipse C1 confocal system. Immunohistochemistry on Kidney Tissue—Rat kidneys were fixed in vivo by perfusion of 4% paraformaldehyde in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium (Invitrogen). Coronal kidney sections containing all kidney zones were then post-fixed for 4–6 h at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde and then embedded in paraffin. Subsequently, 4-μm sections of the paraffin block were deparaffinized in toluene and rehydrated through 99% ethanol. Rehydration was completed in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6 (TBS). Slides were then placed in a plastic tank filled with 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and heated for 40 min at 96–98 °C in a water bath. This step unmasked antigen and allowed immunostaining on paraformaldehyde-fixed paraffin sections, as determined in preliminary experiments (not shown). To reduce nonspecific binding, sections were rinsed in TBS for 10 min and preincubated for 20 min with background reducing buffer (Dako Corp.). Rat kidney sections were double-labeled with either the rabbit polyclonal anti-human RhBG-Cter antibody, which also recognizes the rat isoform (22Quentin F. Eladari D. Cheval L. Lopez C. Goossens D. Colin Y. Cartron J.P. Paillard M. Chambrey R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and the mouse mAb against human ankyrin-G, or with the rabbit polyclonal antibody against human ankyrin-B and the mouse mAb against rat AE1. The double labeling procedure was as follows: anti-RhBG or anti-ankyrin-B antibodies, diluted in background reducing buffer (1:200 or 1:1000, respectively), were applied for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes, sections were incubated with a 1:400 dilution (in background reducing buffer) of goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Cy2 (Amersham Biosciences) in TBS, 30 min at room temperature, followed by three TBS washes. The second round of labeling was then performed. Sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with either the mouse anti-ankyrin-G mAb or the mouse anti-AE1 mAb at a dilution of 1:200 or 1:20, respectively (in background reducing buffer), followed by goat biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:400) and Cy5-conjugated streptavidin (diluted 1:1000) (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min each. Sections were mounted and then examined by confocal microscopy. Cy2 was excited at 488 nm and detected at 498–550 nm, and then, on exactly the same field, Cy5 was excited at 647 nm and detected at 663–758 nm. Yeast Two-hybrid Studies—The D1, D2, D3, and D4 repeat subdomains of the membrane binding domain of ankyrin-G and ankyrin-B were amplified by PCR using plasmids bearing relevant cDNA sequences of Ank3 (gift from Dr. E. Kordeli, Institut Jacques Monod, Paris, France) and Ank2 genes, respectively, as templates. They were then inserted between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGADT7 vector in-frame with the GAL4 activation domain. A cDNA fragment encoding the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of RhBG (RhBG-Cter) was amplified by PCR and inserted between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGBKT7 vector to generate a fusion gene with the DNA binding domain of GAL4. Mutant forms of RhBG-Cter were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (see “Results”). The pGBKT7 and pGADT7 constructs were cotransformed into the AH109 yeast strain using the lithium acetate method (29Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). After 4 days of growth at 30 °C, colonies were streaked onto plates lacking adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. Protein interactions were analyzed 3 days following plating and confirmed by β-galactosidase assays as recommended by the manufacturer (Matchmaker Gal4 Two-hybrid System 3, Clontech). Basolateral Expression of Recombinant RhBG in MDCK Cells—We showed previously by immunocytochemistry that recombinant RhBG was readily expressed at the plasma membrane of transfected HEK293 cells (22Quentin F. Eladari D. Cheval L. Lopez C. Goossens D. Colin Y. Cartron J.P. Paillard M. Chambrey R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In order to assess the polarized expression of RhBG in a heterologous system, the canine kidney epithelial MDCK cell line was stably transfected with the RhBG-pcDNA3 expression vector. Cell clones strongly expressed recombinant RhBG at the plasma membrane, as demonstrated by flow cytometry (mean fluorescence intensity∼500) and wide field microscopy, using the polyclonal anti-Cter antibody (not shown). Confluent monolayers of clones expressing RhBG were filter-grown, allowed to polarize, and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1B, WT panel). XY horizontal sections clearly showed a basolateral labeling of RhBG protein. XZ vertical sections confirmed that RhBG was exclusively localized at the basolateral membrane (Fig. 1B, green) below the tight junctions marked by ZO-1 staining (red), in accordance with the in vivo basolateral expression of the protein at the plasma membrane of renal epithelial cells (22Quentin F. Eladari D. Cheval L. Lopez C. Goossens D. Colin Y. Cartron J.P. Paillard M. Chambrey R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23Verlander J.W. Miller R.T. Frank A.E. Royaux I.E. Kim Y.H. Weiner I.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F323-F337Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, MDCK cells represent an appropriate ex vivo model for further analyzing the basolateral sorting of RhBG. Mapping of the Basolateral Sorting Signal in the Cytoplasmic C Terminus of RhBG—Most of the basolateral targeting cis determinants rely either on tyrosine- or on dileucine-dependent motifs and are located in the cytoplasmic tails of basolaterally expressed proteins (30Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). RhBG protein is predicted to contain both cytoplasmic N (13 amino acids) and C termini (43 amino acids) (1Huang C.H. Liu P.Z. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 90-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 5Liu Z. Peng J. Mo R. Hui C. Huang C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1424-1433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The short N terminus does not exhibit either motif, whereas the C terminus shows a potential tyrosine-based basolateral determinant, YEDQ, at positions 429–432 of the protein sequence (Fig. 1A). However, this motif, with a neutral polar amino acid (Gln) at position Y+3, deviates from the standard sequence YXXØ, where Ø is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid. To test the functionality of this potential determinant, we constructed a mutant in which the four residues were substituted into alanine (Fig. 1A, Y429A/E430A/D431A/Q432A). Confocal microscopy (Fig. 1B) revealed that the mutant RhBG protein was expressed in a nonpolarized manner on both apical and basolateral surfaces (green labeling surrounding and below ZO-1 red staining, respectively, in the XZ section) and also accumulated partly on cytoplasmic membranes (as seen by intracellular granulations in both horizontal and vertical sections). Thus, basolateral expression of RhBG indeed depends on the tyrosine-based motif localized in the cytoplasmic C terminus of the protein. In order to evaluate the relative importance of each amino acid, we then generated mutants containing only one alanine substitution for either residue of the targeting determinant (Fig. 1A, Y429A, E430A, D431A, and Q432A). The Y429A, E430A, and D431A mutants all exhibited nonpolarized expression patterns and a much weaker intracellular retention than the complete Y429A/E430A/D431A/Q432A mutant (Fig. 1B), indicating that the three residues are necessary and have additive effects on the targeting machinery. In contrast, the Q432A mutant displayed a polarized expression similar to the basolateral wild-type RhBG (Fig. 1B). Interaction of RhBG with Ankyrin-G and Ankyrin-B in Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Rh and RhAG have been shown to interact with ankyrin-R through their cytoplasmic tails (18Nicolas V. Le Van Kim C. Gane P. Birkenmeier C. Cartron J.P. Colin Y. Mouro-Chanteloup I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25526-25533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In order to investigate whether the nonerythroid homologue(s) of ankyrin-R could be partner(s) of RhBG, the C terminus of RhBG was fused in-frame to the GAL4 DNA binding domain of the yeast two-hybrid pGBKT7 vector, and the four repeat domains of ankyrin-G and ankyrin-B (D1, D2, D3, and D4) were individually fused in-frame with the GAL4 activation domain of the pGADT7 vector. The recombinant vectors were cotransformed in the AH109 yeast strain, and their ability to grow in high stringency selective medium lacking adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan was analyzed (Fig. 2, A and B). These experiments, confirmed by β-galactosidase activity assays (not shown), indicated that the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of RhBG (RhBG-Cter) specifically interacted with the D3 and D4 repeat domains of ankyrin-G and only the D3 repeat domain of ankyrin-B. No association between RhBG-Cter and the remaining D1 and D2 repeat domains of ankyrin-G or the D1, D2, and D4 repeat domains of ankyrin-B could be detected. RhBG Colocalizes with Ankyrin-G, but Not Ankyrin-B, in Rat Kidney Epithelial Cells—To test in vivo the relevance of the interactions detected in yeast two-hybrid assays between RhBG and ankyrin-G or ankyrin-B, we next investigated whether ankyrin-G or ankyrin-B exhibited the same tubular and plasma membrane location as RhBG by indirect immunofluorescence of paraformaldehyde-fixed paraffin rat kidney sections. Fig. 3 (A–I) shows the localization of ankyrin-G (red) with respect to RhBG protein (green). As we reported previously (22Quentin F. Eladari D. Cheval L. Lopez C. Goossens D. Colin Y. Cartron J.P. Paillard M. Chambrey R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), RhBG was exclusively expressed in the basolateral membrane of the connecting tubule (Fig. 3, B and C) and cortical collecting duct epithelial cells (not shown) and in the basolateral membrane of intercalated cells of medullary collecting ducts (Fig. 3, E, F, H, and I). When the rat kidney sections were stained with anti-ankyrin-G antibody, we found the same broad pattern of expression as described previously by others (24Peters L.L. John K.M. Lu F.M. Eicher E.M. Higgins A. Yialamas M. Turtzo L.C. Otsuka A.J. Lux S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 25Piepenhagen P.A. Peters L.L. Lux S.E. Nelson W.J. Am. J.

Briefly, proximal convoluted tubules (Fig. 3, A and B), thick ascending limbs of Henle's loop (Fig. 3, D and E), and distal convoluted tubules (not shown) exhibited a strong and diffuse labeling of the basolateral domain of tubular epithelial cells, whereas more discrete basolateral labeling was observed in the connecting tubules (Fig. 3, A and B) and the collecting ducts (Fig. 3, D, E, G, and H). Finally, no ankyrin-G staining was detected in the glomeruli and the thin limbs (not shown). As illustrated in Fig. 3, B, E and H, simultaneous examination of ankyrin-G and RhBG stainings demonstrated that all RhBG-positive cells also expressed ankyrin-G. More importantly, within the outer medullary collecting duct and the inner medullary collecting duct, where we have previously shown that RhBG expression is restricted to intercalated cells (22Quentin F. Eladari D. Cheval L. Lopez C. Goossens D. Colin Y. Cartron J.P. Paillard M. Chambrey R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we observed a perfect overlap of RhBG and ankyrin-G staining (Fig. 3, E and H), and ankyrin-G was absent or only weakly expressed in RhBG-negative principal (Fig. 3E) or inner medullary collecting duct (Fig. 3H) cells. We next determined whether ankyrin-B is also present in R"

Abrogation of the CDP-choline (CDP-Cho) pathway for phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis allows for life in the absence of the otherwise essential Sec14p. Nte1p, the product of open reading frame YML059c, is an integral membrane phospholipase against CDP-Cho-derived PC producing intracellular glycerophosphocholine (GPCho) and free fatty acids. We monitored Nte1p activity through in vivo PC turnover measurements and observed that intracellular GPCho accumulation is decreased in a sec14ts strain shifted to 37 °C in 10 mm choline (Cho)-containing medium compared with a Sec14p-proficient strain. Overexpression of two Sec14p homologs Sfh2p and Sfh4p in sec14ts cells restored secretion and growth at the restrictive temperature but did not restore GPCho accumulation. Instead, newly synthesized PC was degraded by phospholipase D (Spo14p). Similar analysis performed in a sec14Δ background confirmed these observations. These results imply that the ability of Sfh2p and Sfh4p to restore secretion and growth is not through a shared function with Sec14p in the regulation of PC turnover via Nte1p. Furthermore, our analyses revealed a profound alteration of PC metabolism triggered by the absence of Sec14p: Nte1p unresponsiveness, Spo14p activation, and deregulation of Pct1p. Sfh2p- and Sfh4p-overexpressing cells coped with the absence of Sec14p by controlling the rate of phosphocholine formation, limiting the amount of Cho available for this reaction, and actively excreting Cho from the cell. Increased Sfh4p also significantly reduced the uptake of exogenous Cho. Beyond the new PC metabolic control features we ascribe to Sfh2p and Sfh4p we also describe a second role for Sec14p in mediating PC homeostasis.

Lipid homeostasis is fulfilled through the coordinated synthesis, degradation, and trafficking of the lipid constituents of biological membranes. Many biological processes such as vesicle formation, protein trafficking, and lipid signaling are dependent on proper lipid content at particular membrane locations, and many cellular pathophysiological situations are associated with perturbations in lipid homeostasis (1McMaster C.R.

Phospholipase D breaks a phosphoester bond producing phosphatidic acid and choline (Cho). The sole PC phospholipase D in yeast is Spo14p, a soluble protein primarily found in the cytoplasm but with the capacity to translocate to cellular membranes for substrate degradation (16Sciorra V.A.

Interestingly, inactivation of Sec14p function promotes Spo14p activity, and the ability of all the genes whose inactivation can bypass the essential function of Sec14p is fully dependent on functional Spo14p (20Patton-Vogt J.L.

Phospholipase B deacylates PC-producing glycerophosphocholine (GPCho) and free fatty acids. Three different genes coding for phospholipase B activities (PLB1-3) have been identified in S. cerevisiae whose protein products are located at the plasma membrane and within the periplasmic space (23Fyrst H.

Plb1p supplies the main activity responsible for PC deacylation at the plasma membrane with its production of GPCho released into the extracellular medium. Dowd et al. (25Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3756-3763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) reported a PC deacylating activity responsible for the production of intracellular GPCho. This activity was induced by the presence of Cho in the culture medium or when the growth temperature was raised to 37 °C. It was shown that the stimulating effects of the addition of Cho and of the elevation of temperature on the deacylating activity were dependent on an active CDP-Cho pathway for PC biosynthesis. The yeast open reading frame (ORF) YML059c was recently found to encode for this activity, and the predicted protein sequence has high similarity to the human neuropathy target esterase protein (26Zaccheo O. Dinsdale D. Meacock P.A. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24024-24033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Both the human and yeast proteins are PC-deacylating serine hydrolases, located in the endoplasmic reticulum, and exhibit similar sensitivities against organophosphorus esters. After a decade of intense investigation a precise molecular depiction of the role played by Sec14p in protein secretion and cell viability remains elusive, but cumulative evidence supports a view whereby Sec14p keeps the lipid composition of internal cellular compartments competent for cargo trafficking. We present metabolic and genetic evidence showing that YML059c (herein named NTE1 as it is the yeast homolog of human neuropathy target esterase) interacts functionally with Sec14p and also determine disparate roles for Sec14p and its homologs Sfh2p and Sfh4p in the regulation of both PC synthesis and turnover. Materials—Choline oxidase (from Arthrobacter globiformis) and horseradish peroxidase were from Sigma. Radiolabeled [methyl-14C]Cho was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. Silica gel thin layer chromatography plates were purchased from Whatman. Yeast Strains, Culture Conditions, and Plasmid Construction—Standard molecular biology methods, yeast genetic techniques, and transformation methods were used (27Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Cells were routinely grown aerobically at 25 °C in synthetic minimal medium containing 2% glucose supplemented as required for plasmid maintenance. The SEC14 ORF region was generated by PCR from W303 chromosomal DNA using the primers indicated in Table II. The generated DNA fragment was cloned into the pCR2.1 Topo vector (Invitrogen) and its DNA sequence confirmed. A 2.2-kb fragment containing the SEC14 ORF was released by cutting at the NotI and SpeI sites flanking the cloning site of the pCR2.1 Topo vector and subcloned into the NotI/SpeI sites of the centromeric plasmid pRS413. The subcloned SEC14 fragment contains chromosomal DNA 500 bp upstream from the SEC14 start codon and 500 bp downstream from the SEC14 stop codon. The SEC14K66,239A allele cloned into YCplac33 vector, the SFH2 gene under the promoter of SEC14 gene cloned into the YEp(URA3) vector pSEY18, and the SFH4 gene under the control of the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1) promoter cloned into a YEp(URA3) plasmid were generously provided by Dr. Vytas Bankaitis (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) (13Li X.

The URA3 marker of the YCplac33 plasmid containing the SEC14K66,239A allele was swapped to HIS3 by insertion in its StuI site a blunt end fragment containing the HIS3 gene and its regulatory flanking sequences. The NTE1 ORF (YML059c) was isolated by generating two contiguous fragments by PCR using BY4741 genomic DNA as template. Primers 5′-NotI-NTE1 and 3′-HindIII-NTE1 were used to amplify a fragment containing 480 bp of its promoter region and the first 3461 bp of the coding region including its endogenous HindIII site. Primers 5′-HindIII-NTE1 and 3′-XhoI-NTE1 were used to amplify a fragment containing the 3′-end of the ORF (1,579 bp) and 302 bp 3′ downstream of the stop codon. Both fragments were cloned separately into pCR2.1 Topo vector and assembled by sequential subcloning into the pRS426 vector.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceBY4741MATa,his3Δ1,leu2Δ0,met15Δ,ura3Δ0EUROSCARFBY4742MATα,his3Δ1,leu2Δ0,lys2Δ0,ura3Δ0EUROSCARFBY4741 nte1ΔMATa,his3Δ1,leu2Δ0,met15Δ0,ura3Δ0,nte1Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFBY4742 nte1ΔMATα,his3Δ1,leu2Δ0,lys2Δ0,ura3Δ0,nte1Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFBY4743 SEC14/sec14ΔMATa/α,his3Δ1/his3Δ1,leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0,MET15/met15Δ0,LYS2/lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0 SEC14/sec14Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFCTY1-1AMATα Δhis3-200 lys2-801 ura3-52 sec14-1tsV.

Yeasts were centrifuged, washed in fresh medium, and recultured in identical medium containing 10 mm nonradiolabeled Cho prewarmed at 25 or 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at various time points, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant (medium fraction) and the cells were submitted to radiolabeled metabolite analysis and lipid phosphorous determination as described. Total uptake was considered the radioactivity incorporated into the cells at the zero time point of the chase. Choline Transport Assays—Cells were grown to mid log phase in minimal glucose medium containing the nutritional requirements for cell growth at 25 °C, and choline transporter activity was determined essentially as described with the following minor modifications. Cells were harvested, washed with fresh medium, and resuspended in identical medium containing 10 μm (10,000 dpm/nmol) [14C]Cho. Uptake was allowed to proceed for 2 and 4 min at 25 °C (8McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28010-28016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A sample was removed for cell number estimation while the uptake was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 10 mm NaN3, 10 mm KF, and 2 mm Cho. Samples were immediately filtered under vacuum through Whatman GF/C glass microfiber filters and rinsed twice with 25 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Cho. The filters were allowed to dry, and the associated radiolabel was determined by liquid scintillation counting. PC Biosynthesis—Mid log phase yeast grown at 25 °C were centrifuged at 2,200 × g for 5 min, washed in fresh medium, and recultured in identical medium containing 10 μm (4,000 dpm/nmol) [14C]Cho at 25 °C (6Howe A.G.

Aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated time points for radiolabeled metabolite analysis and lipid phosphorus determination. Analysis of Radiolabeled Cho-containing Metabolites—Yeast cells were centrifuged at 2,200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold water, resuspended in 1 ml of CHCl3 and CH3OH (1/1, v/v), and disrupted for 1 min at 4 °C using a BioSpec Multi-bead Beater containing 0.5 g of 0.5-mm acid-washed glass beads. The beads were washed with 1 ml of CHCl3 and CH3OH (2/1, v/v), and 1.5 ml of water and 1 ml of CHCl3 and CH3OH (5/1, v/v) were added to the combined supernatant to facilitate phase separation. Phospholipids in the organic phase were analyzed by thin layer chromatography on Whatman Silica Gel 60A plates using the solvent system CHCl3, CH3OH, H2O, CH3COOH (70/30/2/2, v/v/v/v). Cho-containing metabolites in the aqueous phase were separated in a solvent system consisting of CH3OH, 0.6% NaCl, NH4OH (50/50/5, v/v/v) (6Howe A.G. Zaremberg V. McMaster C.R. J. Biol.

Plates were scanned with a BioScan radiolabel imaging scanner, and the corresponding bands were scraped into vials for liquid scintillation counting. Metabolite identity was based on the mobility of known standards dissolved in unlabeled aqueous intracellular fraction or unlabeled cultured medium. Cho Content Measurement—Yeast cells growing logarithmically in 200 ml of minimal supplemented glucose medium at 25 °C were cooled rapidly in ice water, harvested, and washed with a volume of ice-cold 5 mm NaN3, 5 mm KF, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The metabolic poisons were removed by three additional ice-cold water washes. Aliquots of cells (100 mg) were transferred into a 1.5-ml tube containing 0.8 g of acid-washed glass beads. One ml of CHCl3 and CH3OH (1/1, v/v) cooled at -20 °C and 50 μl of 40,000 dpm [14C]Cho (55 mCi/mmol) were added. Cells were immediately broken by vigorous agitation using a bead beater (four bursts of 90 s with cooling on an ice-salt mix between bursts). After storage overnight at -20 °C the extract was transferred to a new tube, and the beads were washed twice with 0.5 ml of CHCl3 and CH3OH (2/1, v/v). To facilitate phase separation 1 ml of CHCl3 and CH3OH (5/1, v/v) and 1.5 ml of water were added. The tubes were agitated for 10 min at 250 rpm and centrifuged at 2,200 × g for 10 min. Two ml of the aqueous phase was removed and concentrated to 0.5 ml. A white interface containing cellular debris was aspirated, and an aliquot of organic phase was saved for lipid phosphorus determination. The entire aqueous phase was chromatographed through a column (2.7 × 18 mm) of Dowex AG 1-X8 (OH form) developed with water (8McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28010-28016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cho eluting in the flow-through was washed from the column, concentrated to 0.55 ml, and clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 10 min. The mass of Cho contained in 0.5 ml of supernatant was estimated using the choline oxidase-peroxidase coupled enzyme assay (28Warnick G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 101-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Recovery of Cho from each cellular extract was estimated based on the yield of [14C]Cho contained in the supernatant. Standard Methods—Protein mass was determined using the Lowry method (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lipid phosphorus as described by Ames and Dubin (30Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular GPCho Accumulation Rate Is Responsive to Sec14p—The product of the yeast YML059c ORF is homologous to mammalian neuropathy target esterase and is responsible for deacylating PC synthesized through the CDP-Cho pathway producing intracellular GPCho and free fatty acids (25Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3756-3763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Zaccheo O. Dinsdale D. Meacock P.A. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24024-24033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Because the identification of the gene coding for this activity was based on its similarity with the human neuropathy target esterase gene we have proposed NTE1 and Nte1p as the name for the YML059c ORF and its protein product, respectively. This activity was shown to increase concurrently with augmentation of the synthesis of PC induced by either the addition of exogenous Cho or elevation of temperature (25Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3756-3763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Zaccheo O. Dinsdale D. Meacock P.A. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24024-24033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Using a nte1Δ::kanMx null strain and its corresponding wild type we performed pulse-chase analysis of PC turnover. Yeast were labeled with [14C]Cho for 30 min at 25 °C, and the label was chased after the addition of 10 mm nonradioactive Cho at 25 or 37 °C (Fig. 1). The time course analysis of label distribution among Cho-containing metabolites from aqueous and organic intracellular fractions as well as extracellular medium during the chase in both strains revealed that the nte1Δ mutant strain did not produce intracellular GPCho after the addition of 10 mm Cho at either 25 or 37 °C. The wild type strain exhibited a basal amount of intracellular GPCho production at the end of the pulse period which increased slightly during the chase period at 25 °C and dramatically during the chase at 37 °C. This observation is consistent with previous reports indicating that Nte1p is the main activity, if it is not only, responsible for deacylating PC synthesized through the CDP-Cho pathway that leads to an accumulation of intracellular GPCho (25Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3756-3763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Zaccheo O. Dinsdale D. Meacock P.A. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24024-24033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The amount of radiolabeled Cho excreted from the nte1 null strain was ∼3-fold higher than the amount in the medium of the wild type strain when the chase was performed at 37 °C. With respect to total PC turnover, this increased amount of excreted Cho did not compensate for the absence of intracellular GPCho production in the nte1 null strain because 60% of the label was associated with PC after 90 min of chase in the nte1 null strain compared with only 20% of the label remaining with PC in the wild type strain at the same time point. Total Cho uptake during the pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 1) as well as direct Cho transporter measurements (9McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14776-14783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) performed under linear time conditions (data not shown) indicated that the nte1Δ strain took up Cho at the same rate as the wild type strain during the pulse phase at 25 °C. Based on the compelling evidence for a role for Sec14p in regulating the CDP-Cho pathway for PC biosynthesis to maintain secretory proficiency from Golgi membranes (4Cleves A.E. McGee T.P.

As a devoted phospholipase against CDP-Cho-derived PC that is located in the endoplasmic reticulum, Nte1p seemed to meet relevant features to control the abundance of PC made through the CDP-Cho pathway at that location. To investigate whether a possible functional interaction between Nte1p and Sec14p existed we performed [14C]Cho pulse-chase experiments to measure the rate of PC turnover in the CTY1-1A (sec14ts) strain transformed with a low copy plasmid bearing the SEC14 wild type allele, a low copy vector bearing the SEC14K66,239A allele (33Phillips S.E.

This study focuses on the isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (Icmt) enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ste14p, the founding member of a homologous family of endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins present in all eukaryotes. Ste14p, like all Icmts, has multiple membrane spanning domains, presenting a significant challenge to its purification in an active form.

Among the extensive panel of detergents that was screened, optimal solubilization and retention of Ste14p activity occurred with n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. The activity of Ste14p could be further optimized upon reconstitution into liposomes. Our expression and purification schemes generate milligram quantities of pure and active Ste14p, which is highly stable under many conditions.

In addition to catalyzing methylation of AFC, we also show that purified Ste14p methylates a known in vivo substrate, Ras2p.

Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has recently been determined that prenylated and proteolyzed but unmethylated Ras is not able to promote cellular transformation (13Bergo M.O. Gavino B.J. Hong C. Beigneux A.P.

These findings have led to the hypothesis that Icmt enzymatic activity represents an excellent target for cancer chemotherapeutic intervention. Targeted inhibition of Icmt in cancer cells could be an effective chemotherapeutic strategy for Ras-based cancers. Ste14p, the Icmt from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, identified through genetic and biochemical means, is the founding member of the Icmt family (7Hrycyna C.A. Sapperstein S.K. Clarke S. Michaelis S.

This 26-kDa polytopic integral membrane protein is localized to the membrane of the ER with the bulk of the protein cytosolically disposed (Fig. 1A) (8Romano J.D. Schmidt W.K. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2231-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Romano J.D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1957-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This enzyme is comprised of multiple membrane spanning segments and must accommodate chemically diverse methyl donor and acceptor molecules: the hydrophilic S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and a lipophilic isoprenylated protein, respectively. Strikingly, Icmt shares none of the conserved consensus sequences described for known soluble (protein or nucleic acid) methyltransferases (17Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), suggesting that Icmt may have a distinct type of SAM binding site, as well as a potentially novel catalytic mechanism. The yeast and human Icmts share 41% identity and 63% similarity overall, suggesting that their three-dimensional structures and mechanisms of action are similar. In fact, human Icmt expressed in yeast complements a ste14Δ deletion (6Dai Q. Choy E. Chiu V. Romano J. Slivka S.R. Steitz S.A. Michaelis S. Philips M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15030-15034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), suggesting that yeast Ste14p studies are directly relevant to our understanding of the function and mechanism of human Icmt. Studies presented here show that high level protein expression in yeast combined with surveying a varied panel of detergents offers an excellent approach to identifying conditions appropriate for the solubilization of functional Ste14p, which may be generally applicable to numerous membrane proteins from yeast or heterologous sources. His-tagged Ste14p expressed from a strong constitutive promoter is overexpressed to levels 20-fold higher than described previously, suggesting that our vectors will be useful for the expression of other yeast and heterologous membrane proteins. His-Ste14p was solubilized from crude membrane preparations using 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM). The detergent-solubilized extract retained biochemical activity in vitro comparable with the original untreated membrane fraction. Following detergent solubilization, His-Ste14p was purified to homogeneity using immobilized metal affinity column chromatography. The purified enzyme retains substantial activity using the model substrate N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine (AFC) and activity is stimulated at least 3-fold when detergent-solubilized Ste14p is reconstituted into liposomes of varying composition. Purified and reconstituted Ste14p does not prefer farnesylated versus geranylgeranylated substrates in vitro and appears to be a metalloenzyme. Additionally, purified His-Ste14p is able to catalyze the methylation of partially purified isoprenylated and C-terminally proteolyzed Ras2p in vitro, which is significant as it will allow for the identification of possible protein-mediated specificity determinants.

To construct pCHm3 and pCHm6, one or two copies of a 117-bp BamHI fragment from pSM937, which contains a triply iterated myc sequence tag, was cloned into the BamHI site of pSM703. The oligonucleotide 5′-CGTAGAATTCATGCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATGGCCCGGGGAATCTC-3′ and its complement were annealed to one another, resulting in a 52-bp EcoRI-SmaI fragment containing a 10× repeated histidine tag. This fragment was cloned into the EcoRI and SmaI sites of pCHm3 and pCHm6 to yield pCHH10m3N and pCHH10m6N, respectively. The oligonucleotides 5′-pGGCCGCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATTGACCGC-3′ and 5′-pGGTCAATGATGATGATGATGATGATGATGATGATGATGC-3′ were annealed together, resulting in a 36-bp EagI-SacII fragment containing a 10× repeated histidine tag. This fragment was cloned into the EagI and SacII sites of pCHm3 and pCHm6 to yield pCHm3H10C and pCHm6H10C, respectively. The plasmids pCHH10m3N and pCHm3H10C were digested with BamHI to remove the myc tag and then religated to create pCHH10N and pCHH10C, respectively. A 727-bp BamHI-SacII fragment containing the STE14 gene was amplified from pSM187 and cloned into the BamHI and SacII sites of pCHH10N to yield pCHH10N-STE14. This plasmid encodes Ste14p with a 10× histidine tag at the N terminus under the control of the constitutive 3′-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter. A 734-bp EagI-SacII fragment containing the STE14 gene was amplified from pSM187 and cloned into the EagI and SacII sites of pCHH10m3N and pCHH10m6N to produce pCHH10m3N-STE14 and pCHH10m6N-STE14, respectively. These plasmids encode Ste14p with a 10× histidine tag followed bya3or6 myc epitope repeat at the N terminus. Both are under the control of the constitutive PGK promoter. A 725-bp XmaI-BamHI fragment containing STE14 was amplified from pSM187 and cloned into the XmaI and BamHI sites of pCHH10C to yield pCHH10C-STE14. This plasmid encodes Ste14p with a 10× histidine tag at the C terminus, which is under the constitutive control of the PGK promoter. A 724-bp XmaI fragment containing STE14 was amplified from pSM187 and cloned into the XmaI site of pCHm3H10C and pCHm6H10C to produce pCHm3H10C-STE14 and pCHm6H10C-STE14, respectively. These plasmids encode Ste14p with either a 3 or 6 myc epitope repeat followed by a 10× histidine tag at the C terminus. Both are under the control of the constitutive PGK promoter. A 727-bp BamHI-SacII fragment containing STE14 was amplified from pSM187 and cloned into the BamHI and SacII sites of pSM703 to yield pSM703-STE14. This plasmid encodes untagged Ste14p that will be expressed under the PGK promoter. A 975-bp EagI-SacII fragment containing the RAS2 gene was amplified from pSM1326 and cloned into the EagI and SacII sites of pCHH10m3N to produce pCHH10m3N-RAS2. This plasmid encodes Ras2p with a 10× histidine tag followed by a 3 myc epitope repeat at the N terminus expressed under the control of the PGK promoter. Transformation of this plasmid into the STE14 deletion strain SM1188 yields strain CH2765, expressing farnesylated, proteolyzed but unmethylated His-Ras2p. All plasmids were sequenced bidirectionally to confirm the DNA sequence. Isolation of Membrane Fraction from Yeast Cells—Mid-log phase yeast cells (2.0 A600/ml), grown in SC-URA medium, were harvested by centrifugation at 3500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with 10 mm NaN3, and resuspended in lysis buffer (0.3 m sorbitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 10 μg/ml bestatin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm AEBSF) to a final concentration of 400 A600/ml. After a 15-min incubation on ice, the cells were frozen and thawed twice in liquid N2. The cells were then lysed by passing the mixture twice through a French press at 18,000 p.s.i. The resultant mixture was centrifuged at 500 × g to remove whole cells and other particulate. Subsequently, the supernatant was treated with 50 units/ml micrococcal nuclease followed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C, to pellet the membrane fraction. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 10% glycerol, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C. Membrane protein concentration was determined using Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce). Detergent Solubilization of Crude Membranes—His-Ste14-containing membranes were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% detergent to a final protein concentration of 5 mg/ml and incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. The solution was subsequently centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, to remove the non-solubilized membrane fraction. The concentration of the protein present in the supernatant was determined by the Amido Black protein assay. Purification of His-Ste14p from Crude Membranes—His-Ste14p-containing membranes were solubilized as described above in 1% DDM, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and lysis buffer containing 10% glycerol at a final protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. The 300,000 × g supernatant containing solubilized Ste14p (post-spin) was rocked for 1 h with Talon metal affinity resin beads (Clontech, Inc., Palo Alto, CA), and the beads were then washed twice with Buffer A (lysis buffer plus 10% glycerol, 1% DDM, and 40 mm imidazole), once with Buffer B (Buffer A plus 0.5 m KCl), and once with Buffer C (lysis buffer plus 10% glycerol, 0.1% DDM, 40 mm imidazole, and 0.5 m KCl). The beads were eluted sequentially using lysis buffer containing 10% glycerol, 0.1% DDM, and either 100 mm, 500 mm, or 1 m imidazole. Subsequent to these sequential elutions, the column was stripped with 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0. To ensure that all of the His-Ste14p from the postspin fraction was extracted, the flow-through from the first bead column was incubated with fresh beads and the entire process was repeated. All elutions were combined and concentrated in Microcon 30 concentrators (Millipore Co., Billerica, MA). Protein concentration was determined by the Amido Black protein assay (19Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar). Purification of His-Ras2p from Lysate—Cells expressing CH2765 (His-Ras2p) were resuspended in lysis buffer, frozen, and thawed twice in liquid nitrogen and lysed by passing mixture twice through a French press at 18,000 p.s.i. After spinning at 500 × g to remove cellular debris, glycerol was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 10%. This supernatant was then transferred to Talon metal affinity resin beads. The purification procedure continued as described above for His-Ste14p with two modifications. First, the His-Ras2p purification does not contain any detergent. Second, instead of sequential imidazole elutions, His-Ras2p was eluted from the column with EDTA elution buffer (200 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.18 m sorbitol, 6 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.6% aprotinin, 6 μg/ml leupeptin, 6 μg/ml pepstatin A, 6 μg/ml chymostatin, 6 μg/ml bestatin, and 1.2 mm AEBSF). It is known that EDTA does not inhibit Ste14p activity. Protein concentration was determined by Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce). Preparation of Liposomes—Lipid mixtures were dissolved in chloroform and dried as a thin film in round bottom flasks under a gentle nitrogen stream. To ensure removal of all chloroform, the lipid films were additionally dried under vacuum for at least 1 h. The lipid films were rehydrated with water or 600 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. Liposomes were extruded to a diameter of 100 nm with a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.). Reconstitution of Purified His-Ste14p—The purifed protein was reconstituted by rapid dilution (20Ambudkar S.V. Lelong I.H. Zhang J. Cardarelli C. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 492-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A 100–1000-fold weight:weight excess of the liposomal mixtures was added directly to the purified His-Ste14p fraction after elution from the metal affinity column in the presence of AFC and incubated on ice for 5 min. Subsequently, the solution was subjected to a 20-fold rapid dilution in detergent-free buffer. Immunoblot Analysis—Protein samples containing 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer were heated to 65 °C for 15 min and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a pure nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 μm; Schleicher & Schuell) at 400 mA for 1 h. The filter was blocked with 20% milk in phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20 (PBST: 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4). The filter was then incubated with the primary antibody (1:1000 α-Ste14, 1:2000 α-His or 1:10,000 α-myc) dissolved in 5% milk in PBST. Following several washes with PBST, the filter was incubated with the secondary antibody (1:4000 goat α-mouse HRP or 1:10,000 goat α-rabbit HRP) dissolved in 5% milk in PBST. After washing with PBST, the protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). In Vitro Vapor Diffusion Methyltransferase Assay—The assay was performed as described previously (14Hrycyna C.A. Clarke S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5071-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) except that the reaction generally contained 5 μg of total membrane protein, 200 μm AFC or AGGC as the methyl acceptor, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 20 μm SAM (50–60 mCi/mmol). Assays containing purified and reconstituted His-Ste14p typically used less than 1 μg of protein and used 100 mm MES, pH 7.0. Reactions were assembled on ice and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Where indicated, samples were processed through a spin column gel filtration step as described below prior to assaying for activity. Inhibition of purifed His-Ste14p activity was performed by incubating the reconstituted protein with inhibitor for 10 min at 30 °C prior to addition of SAM. Determination of His-Ste14p Substrate Specificity—Escherichia coli bulk polar lipid plus 0.05% Texas Red 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, triethylammonium salt (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were dissolved in chloroform and dried in a round bottom flask under gentle nitrogen stream. After 1 h under vacuum, the lipid film was hydrated with water to a final lipid concentration of 12.5 mg/ml. These liposomes were extruded to 100 nm diameter. Liposomes were incubated for 5 min with varying amounts of either AFC or AGGC. Water was then added to make the final concentration of lipid 4 mg/ml. This lipid mixture was allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 15 min. The mixture was then spun through a 600 μl of Sephacryl S-100 high resolution (Amersham Biosciences) column in a 1-ml syringe using glass wool as a frit for 2 min at 1100 × g to remove isoprenylated substrate not incorporated into the liposomes. Actual elution of the vesicles takes place on the order of ∼10 s during the spin. Monitoring of the Texas Red concentration at 585 nm verified nearly complete recovery of liposomes at a relatively constant concentration in the column flow-through. These liposomes were immediately subjected to the in vitro vapor diffusion methyltransferase assay as described above using 25 μl of the liposome mixture and 0.089 μg of purified His-Ste14p. Each individual concentration of isoprenylated substrate in the liposomes was repeated three times, and each replicate was assayed twice in the methyltransferase assay. The concentration of isoprenylated substrate in the liposomes was determined by ultraviolet absorbance at 207 nm using the zero point as the blank. These values were compared with AFC and AGGC standard curves that contained the same amount of lipid to determine the actual isoprenylated substrate concentration of each point. Points from several determinations were plotted on one graph and the data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad Prism 4.0. The AFC curves and fit were obtained from 312 data points, representing 26 different concentrations and the AGGC curves and fit were obtained from 288 data points, representing 24 different concentrations. In Vivoa-Factor Halo Assay—The assay was preformed as described previously (16Romano J.D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol.

A clear zone, or halo, indicates the secretion of mature a-factor by the MATa cells which in turn inhibits the growth of the lawn, which is supersensitive to mature a-factor. Versatile Vectors for High Level Expression of Ste14p in S. cerevisiae—To facilitate this project, a basic set of expression tools were established, which allow us to generate large amounts of protein for biochemical and biophysical analyses. We have constructed a series of six S. cerevisiae Ste14p expression plasmids that are engineered to contain polyhistidine and multiple myc epitope tags at either the N or C terminus of Ste14p (Fig. 1B). These constructs, as well as the untagged Ste14p protein, are expressed using the strong constitutive PGK promoter. These vectors have been engineered such that any protein of interest can be inserted in frame in the multiple cloning site. Epitope-tagged Ste14p Proteins Are Expressed at High Levels and Are Biochemically Active in Vitro—We have successfully utilized these new vectors to generate strains expressing tagged and untagged versions of Ste14p. The polyhistidine tag is used to facilitate purification and the myc tag is used for immunoblot detection. These proteins are expressed, as demonstrated by immunoblotting with an anti-Ste14 polyclonal antibody and commercially available anti-myc"

The HIV Tat protein can be endocytosed by surrounding uninfected cells; interacts with transcriptional coactivators/acetyltransferases, p300/CREB-binding protein, and p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor (PCAF); and induces neuronal apoptosis. Since nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptor signaling through CREB requires p300 and PCAF histone acetyltransferases, we sought to determine whether HIV-1 Tat coactivator interactions interfere with neurotrophin receptor signaling in neuronal cells. Here, we demonstrate that Tat-coactivator interactions inhibit NGF- and brain-derived neurotrophic factor-responsive CRE trans-activation and neurotrophin protection against apoptosis in PC12 and IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells. Purified recombinant Tat or Tat-derived synthetic peptides, spanning p300- and PCAF-binding sequences, inhibit histone H3/H4 acetylation in vitro. A Tat mutant, TatK28A/K50A, defective for binding p300 and PCAF, neither repressed NGF-responsive CRE transactivation nor inhibited histone acetylation. HIV-1 Tat interacts in PCAF complexes in post-mortem CNS tissues from donor neuro-AIDS patients, as determined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer immunoconfocal microscopy. Importantly, these findings suggest that HIV-1 Tat-coactivator interactions may contribute to neurotrophin signaling impairments and neuronal apoptosis associated with HIV-1 infections of the CNS.

In adults, between 40 and 70% of HIV-1-infected symptomatic AIDS patients develop neurological disorders (1Simpson D.M. Berger J.R. Med. Clin. N.

The brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system are all frequently involved by HIV. Involvement of the nervous system may be due to the direct or indirect effects of HIV infection or as a result of secondary infections or malignancies (4Skiest D.J. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2002; 34: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). One of the most prevalent and clinically important primary neurological disorders is the AIDS dementia complex, a subcortical dementia, which manifests clinically as cognitive, behavioral, and motor impairment. Estimates of the prevalence of AIDS dementia range from 7 to 90% depending on the definition, but it is probably ∼20–30%. Recent studies suggest that the incidence of AIDS dementia complex has not decreased to the same extent as other AIDS-related complications in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era (5Sacktor N.

Whereas modern combination therapies, such as HAART, have been successful toward reducing the plasma burden of HIV, the majority of HAART regimen compounds do not penetrate the blood-brain or blood-nerve barriers, and HIV-1 continues to replicate in the CNS, which may serve as a reservoir for the production of HAART-resistant virus particles.

In the present study, we demonstrate that HIV-1 Tat-coactivator interactions markedly inhibit neurotrophin-responsive CRE-trans-activation, histone acetylation, and NGF protection against cellular apoptosis. These findings suggest that Tat-coactivator interactions may contribute to neurotrophin signaling/transcriptional impairments and neuronal cell death associated with HIV infections of the CNS. Cell Culture and Transfections—Rodent PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (ATCC number CRL-1721) were cultured in 6-well plates or 60-mm2 tissue culture dishes (Nalge) coated with mouse type IV collagen (20 μg/ml in PBS; Roche Applied Science) in ATCC Ham's F-12K medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 15% horse serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). Human IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells (ATCC number CCL-127) were cultured in collagen-treated tissue culture dishes or 6-well plates as described in ATCC 2003, Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. All cultures were grown under 10% CO2 at 37 °C. Mouse NGF (2.5S, grade II; Roche Applied Science) was added in certain experiments to a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. Transfections were performed by seeding collagen-treated, 6-well tissue culture plates with ∼2 × 105 cells/well and using either a calcium phosphate-based transfection system or Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended in the manufacturer's protocol.

Cells were harvested by scraping, washed twice with 500 μl of PBS, resuspended in 80 μl of SDS lysis buffer (Promega), and lysed by rapid freeze-thawing. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford microassay and spectrophotometric analyses at 595 nm. Luciferase assays were performed on 50 μg of total cellular proteins for each sample using a Berthold Lumat LB 9507 luminometer. Results shown are representative of duplicate or triplicate experiments. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Immuno-laser Confocal Microscopy—Formalin-fixed post-mortem CNS tissue (cingulum; thalamus) thin sections from uninfected or HIV-1-infected donor neuro-AIDS patients clinically diagnosed with primary encephalopathies were analyzed by FRET immuno-laser confocal microscopy to detect HIV-1 Tat-PCAF interactions. Briefly, the slides were fixed in 0.2% gluteraldehyde, 1% formaldehyde in PBS and washed three times with PBS, and nonspecific antigens were blocked by incubation with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. An anti-PCAF goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an anti-HIV-1 Tat rabbit polyclonal antibody (Advanced Bioscience Laboratories) were diluted (1:1000) in BLOTTO buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl, 0.2% (v/v) IGEPAL CA-630, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk), and slides were incubated in primary antibodies with agitation for 2 h at room temperature. A weakly emitting FITC-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody (donor) was used to detect PCAF, and a Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (FRET acceptor) was used to detect HIV-1 Tat in infected CNS tissue sections. FRET immuno-laser confocal microscopy was performed using a Nikon C1 confocal system mounted on a Nikon TE2000-U inverted fluorescence microscope. Annexin-V-FITC Staining and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting— For apoptosis analyses, RSV-HIV-1 Tat (or Tat mutant)-transfected PC12 cells were prestimulated with NGF (10 ng/ml) for 8 h prior to serum deprivation for 48 h. Cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 200 μl of 1× annexin buffer and stained with 5 μl of annexin-V-FITC (BD Biosciences) for 10 min. Five hundred microliters of 1× annexin-buffer were added to each sample, and fluorescence flow cytometric analyses were performed using a BD Biosciences FACSCaliber instrument. Protein Purification—GST-HIV-1 Tat and GST-TatK28A/K50A fusion proteins were induced in Escherichia coli BL21 bacteria containing appropriate pGEX expression constructs using 100 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Invitrogen) in Luria-Bertani broth overnight with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 5 ml of PBS containing the protease inhibitors, anti-pain dihydrochloride, bestatin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (50 ng/ml each; Roche Applied Science). Bacteria were lysed by repeated sonication over an ice bath, using a Bronson sonic dismembrator equipped with a microtip and operated at 70% duty cycle. Lysates were precleared by centrifugation and were incubated for2hat 4 °C with 500 μl of a 50% mixture of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in PBS (plus protease inhibitors). Following incubation, matrices were pelleted by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and washed twice with PBS (plus protease inhibitors). Bound GST fusion proteins were eluted in 10 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) in PBS (plus protease inhibitors), dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol; fractions were stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Radioactive in Vitro HAT Assays—Radioactive acetylation assays were performed in vitro by preincubating 5 units of recombinant HAT-active p3001195–1707 or PCAF351–832 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) with GST-HIV-1 Tat or GST-HIV-1 TatK28A/K50A proteins (25, 50, or 100 ng) in acetylation buffer containing 50 mm Tr"

The importance of Jaks in signaling by these receptors has been firmly established by analysis of mutant cell lines, the generation of Jak knock-out mice, and the identification of patients with Jak3 mutations. While a number of other ligands that do not bind Type I and II cytokine receptors have also been reported to activate Jaks, the requirement for Jaks in signaling by these receptors is less clear. Chemokines for example, which bind seven transmembrane receptors, have been reported to activate Jaks, and principally through the use of pharmacological inhibitors, it has been argued that Jaks are essential for chemokine signaling. In the present study, we focused on CXCR4, which binds the chemokine CXCL12 or stromal cell-derived factor-1, a chemokine that has been reported to activate Jak2 and Jak3. We found that the lack of Jak3 had no effect on CXCL12 signaling or chemotaxis nor did overexpression of wild-type versions of the kinase. Similarly, overexpression of wild-type or catalytically inactive Jak2 or “knocking-down” Jak2 expression using siRNA also had no effect. We also found that in primary lymphocytes, CXCL12 did not induce appreciable phosphorylation of any of the Jaks compared with cytokines for which these kinases are required. Additionally, little or no Stat (signal transducer and activator of transcription) phosphorylation was detected. Thus, we conclude that in contrast to previous reports, Jaks, especially Jak3, are unlikely to play an essential role in chemokine signaling.

Type I and II cytokine receptors bind Janus kinases, a small family of protein tyrosine kinases consisting of four members, Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2 (2Ihle J.N.

The Jaks bind via their amino-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domains and upon cytokine binding become activated by transphosphorylation (5Zhou Y.J. Chen M. Cusack N.A. Kimmel L.H.

The Jaks then phosphorylate cytokine receptors on cytosolic tyrosine residues, forming docking sites for proteins with phosphotyrosine binding or Src homology 2 domains. Stats are one key family of proteins with Src homology 2 domains, which are recruited in this manner and are themselves phosphorylated by Jaks. This allows the Stats to dimerize, resulting in their nuclear accumulation (7Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). The essential function of Jaks and Stats in signaling via Type I and II cytokine receptors has been clearly established by studies of mutant cell lines, knock-out mice, and humans with severe combined immunodeficiency due to Jak3 mutations (1Darnell Jr., J.E.

In addition though, a number of studies have reported that Jaks and Stats are activated by ligands that do not bind Type I and II cytokine receptors. Importantly, some of these studies have also concluded that Jaks are essential for signaling by such ligands. Chemokines have a broad range of critical functions in the immune response ranging from recruitment and trafficking of inflammatory cells to lymphopoiesis, angiogenesis, and lymphoid organ development. As their name implies, a major action is to induce a chemotactic response in cells; as such, they play important roles in various inflammatory and infectious diseases (9Locati M. Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Med. 1999; 50: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 10Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol.

Immunol. 2001; 2: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Chemokine receptors belong to the well known seven-transmembrane domain receptor family known to signal via trimeric G-proteins. Chemokines in particular signal via the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi subfamily, inducing phosphorylation of multiple substrates including Pyk2, AKT, and ERK1/2 (13Rickert P. Weiner O.D. Wang F. Bourne H.R. Servant G. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 466-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 14Curnock A.P. Logan M.K. Ward S.G. Immunology. 2002; 105: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Chemokines also activate phospholipase Cβ2 and β3, which hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate to form diacyglycerol and inositol trisphosphate thereby activating protein kinase C and inducing mobilization of intracellular calcium stores, respectively. In addition to the intermediates mentioned, a number of reports have implicated Jaks and Stats in chemokine signaling (15Vila-Coro A.J. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Martin De Ana A. Moreno-Ortiz M.C.

In some cases, it has been argued not only that Jaks are activated but also that they are an early and requisite step in chemokine signaling (15Vila-Coro A.J. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Martin De Ana A.

In this model, signaling is initiated by receptor dimerization and recruitment of Jaks, with subsequent activation of G-proteins. Phosphorylation of the receptor by Jaks presumably provides docking sites for Stats. However, if Jaks are essential for signaling via chemokine receptors, a number of critical questions arise that have wide implications. Are Jaks important for just a subset of chemokine receptors or are they of general importance for all chemokine receptors? In fact, could Jaks have broad functions for GPCRs in general? If Jaks are important for signaling by GPCRs or chemokine receptors, what is the structural basis of receptor/Jak interaction? Chemokine receptors do not share homology with the membrane-proximal domains of cytokine receptors, so does the Jak FERM domain have the capacity to bind both receptors? Or would the chemokine receptor/Jak interaction occur via a different mechanism? Given that seven transmembrane receptors are the most abundant class of receptor, this is an important issue to resolve (24Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Zody M.C. Baldwin J. Devon K.

Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10387) Google Scholar). Thus, we thought it important to revisit the role of Jaks in chemokine signaling. In this study, we focused on the ligand-receptor pair CXCL12 and CXCR4. CXCR4 is widely expressed, but unlike many other chemokine receptors that share multiple ligands, CXCL12 is its only ligand, allowing one to know with certainty what receptor was being analyzed (26Nagasawa T. Hirota S. Tachibana K. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Kitamura Y. Yoshida N. Kikutani H. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1996; 382: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar). In addition, a previous study reported that Jak2 and Jak3 were transiently phosphorylated in response to CXCL12 (15Vila-Coro A.J. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Martin De Ana A. Moreno-Ortiz M.C. Martinez A.C. Mellado M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1699-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), although another reported that Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 but not Jak3 were activated (18Zhang X.F. Wang J.F. Matczak E. Proper J.A. Groopman J.E. Blood. 2001; 97: 3342-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Similarly, CXCL12 has been variably reported to activate Stats 1, 2, 3, and 5 (15Vila-Coro A.J. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Martin De Ana A. Moreno-Ortiz M.C. Martinez A.C. Mellado M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1699-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Importantly, it has also been concluded that Jaks are an essential aspect of chemokine signaling. Jak2 and Jak3 were reported to associate with and phosphorylate CXCR4, and putatively selective Jak inhibitors block CXCL12 signaling, as measured by inhibition of substrate phosphorylation, calcium mobilization, and cell migration (18Zhang X.F. Wang J.F. Matczak E. Proper J.A. Groopman J.E. Blood. 2001; 97: 3342-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 27Soldevila G. Licona I. Salgado A. Ramirez M. Chavez R. Garcia-Zepeda E. Immunology. 2004; 112: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, these inhibitors are not selective for Jaks (28Changelian P.S. Flanagan M.E. Ball D.J. Kent C.R.

The constructs encoding wild-type Jak2 and catalytically inactive Jak2 were kindly provided by Dr. James N. Ihle (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) and Christin Carter-Su (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). The CXCR4 cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3 as described previously (34Feng Y.

Cell Culture, Stimulation, and Transfection—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from healthy donors by apheresis and sedimented over Ficoll-Paque™ PLUS (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml PHA for 3 days in RPMI 1640 medium (BIOSOURCE International) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BIOSOURCE International), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10 mm HEPES (BIOSOURCE International), and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, BIOSOURCE International). This was followed by an additional 48 h of stimulation with IL-2 (100 units/ml) to maximize IL-2R and Jak3 expression (2Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, 12Luther S.A. Cyster J.G. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with acidified medium to remove bound IL-2, incubated in serum-free medium, and re-stimulated with the cytokines as indicated. EBV-transformed human B cell lines from healthy donor and a Jak3-deficient patient (36Macchi P. Villa A. Giliani S. Sacco M.G. Frattini A. Porta F. Ugazio A.G. Johnston J.A. Candotti F. O'Shea J.J. Vezzoni P. Notarangelo L.D. Nature. 1995; 377: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) were cultured with complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK293, was cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and was transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For siRNA experiments, Jurkat cells were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 and were split daily to ensure log phase growth at the time of transfection. At the time of transfection, 1 × 107 cells in RPMI 1640 in a volume of 0.4 ml were mixed with 200 pmol of Jak2 SmartPool siRNA or 200 pmol of a scrambled, nonspecific siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) and transferred to a 0.4-cm gap cuvette (Bio-Rad). The cells were electroporated at 262 V, 1040 microfarads, 720 Ohms using a BTX ECM 630 (Genetronics Inc., San Diego, CA). The transfected cells were transferred to 6-well plates and cultured in RPMI. After 24-h incubation, RNA was isolated using a Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and reverse transcribed using a TaqMan reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Jak2 mRNA expression in transfected cells was determined by real-time PCR using the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The primer/probe sequences for Jak2 were as follows: primers, 5′-TGGAGCTTTGGAGTGGTTCTG-3 and 5′TGCC AATCATACGCATAAATTCC-3′; probe, 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein-AACTTTTCACATACATTGAGAAGAGAAAAGTCCAC-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine-3′. Analysis of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels was performed using a commercially available primer/probe set (Applied Biosystems). Jak2 mRNA levels were normalized against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels and compared with the levels in mock-transfected control cells for an individual experiment, which were arbitrarily designated a value of 1.0. Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blot Analysis—Cytokine- or CXCL12-stimulated PBMC (50 × 106) were lysed in buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.25 μg/ml p-nitrophenyl-p-guanidinobenzoate, and clarified lysates were immunoprecipitated as described previously (2Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates and lysates were separated in SDS-PAGE (8%-12.5%) and transferred to Immobilon™-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and immunoblotted with the indicated antibody. Blots were stripped in with 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and then reblotted to document equivalent protein loading. Calcium Flux—Cells (2 × 106) were incubated in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.5 μm Fura-2/AM at 37 °C for 30 min, washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen), and suspended in 2 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cells were stimulated with CXCL12 in a continuously stirred cuvette at 37 °C, and changes in intracellular calcium levels were detected fluorimetrically using a ratio fluorescence spectrometer (model MS-III; Photon Technology Inc., South Brunswick, NJ) (37Tiffany H.L.

Data were recorded every 20 ms as the ratio of fluorescence emitted at 510 nm following sequential excitation at 340 and 380 nm. Alternatively, Jurkat cells were incubated with 16 μm Fura-red and 16 μm Fluo-4AM (Molecular Probes) for 45 min at 37 °C, washed twice in cold RPMI, and resuspended in cold Tyrode's buffer (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES). The cells were stimulated with CXCL12 at 37 °C, and changes in dye fluorescence over time were determined by flow cytometry. Calcium mobilization was expressed as the ratio of Fluo-4AM to Fura-red fluorescence intensity over time. Chemotaxis Assay—Cells (1.5 × 105) in 25 μl of medium were applied to the upper wells of a 96-well chemotaxis plate (5-μm pore size membrane, Neuro Probe, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) with or without CXCL12 (1–100 nm final concentration) in RPMI in the lower wells and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells adhered to the filter were dislodged by incubating with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% EDTA for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuging (500 × g) for 10 min. The number of cells migrating to the lower well was enumerated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide staining. CXCR4 Signaling Is Not Affected by Jak2 and Jak3 in HEK293 Cells—Using an inhibitor that blocks both Jaks as well as other kinases, previous studies have concluded that Jaks are essential for chemokine signaling (18Zhang X.F.

https://openalex.org/W1989935221,"Binding of agonists to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors generates a sequence of conformational changes resulting in channel opening. Previously, we have shown that the aspartate residue Asp-266 at the M2-M3 linker of the α7 nicotinic receptor is involved in connecting binding and gating. High resolution structural data suggest that this region could interact with the so-called loops 2 and 7 of the extracellular N-terminal region. In this case, certain charged amino acids present in these loops could integrate together with Asp-266 and other amino acids, a mechanism involved in channel activation. To test this hypothesis, all charged residues in these loops, Asp-42, Asp-44, Glu-45, Lys-46, Asp-128, Arg-130, and Asp-135, were substituted with other amino acids, and expression levels and electrophysiological responses of mutant receptors were determined. Mutants at positions Glu-45, Lys-46, and Asp-135 exhibited poor or null functional responses to different nicotinic agonists regardless of significant membrane expression, whereas D128A showed a gain of function effect. Because the double reverse charge mutant K46D/D266K did not restore receptor function, a gating mechanism controlled by the pairwise electrostatic interaction between these residues is not likely. Rather, a network of interactions formed by residues Lys-46, Asp-128, Asp-135, Asp-266, and possibly others appears to link agonist binding to channel gating.

The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) 1The abbreviations used are: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; GlyR, glycine receptor; GABAA R, γ-aminobutyric acid receptor; α-Bgt, α-bungarotoxin; ACh, acetylcholine. is a member of the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels that mediates fast synaptic transmission in nerve and muscle cells (1Lindstrom J.M.

Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) have demonstrated the relevance for channel gating of a direct electrostatic interaction between the positively charged Lys-279 residue in the M2-M3 linker of the GABAAR and negatively charged residues of loops 2 and 7. Electrostatic interactions also appear to be relevant for gating of GlyRs (13Schofield C.M. Jenkins A. Harrison N.L. J. Biol.

We have shown previously that the negatively charged Asp-266 residue in the M2-M3 linker of α7 nAChRs (8Campos-Caro A. Sala S. Ballesta J.J. Vicente-Agulló F. Criado M. Sala F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Identification of such residues would be of relevance because it can provide insights into the gating mechanism of nAChRs and allow comparisons with data obtained from other ligand-gated ion channels (12Kash T.L.

We report here that mutations of amino acids Glu-45 and Lys-46 (loop 2) and Asp-135 (loop 7) of the α7 subunit caused dramatic reductions in the currents evoked by different agonists, whereas some mutants at Asp-128 showed the opposite effect suggesting that these residues play an important role in the transduction of agonist binding into channel activation. Generation of Mutants of the Bovine α7 Subunit—The bovine α7 cDNA (16García-Guzmán M. Sala F. Sala S. Campos-Caro A. Stu ̈hmer W. Guti-érrez L.M. Criado M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was cloned in a derivative of the pSP64T vector (17Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar) containing part of the pBluescript polylinker. The appropriate DNA cassettes were generated by PCR (25 cycles at 94 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s) and used to substitute original segments of the α7 subunit through restriction enzyme digestions. For this purpose we used restriction enzyme sites present in the original cDNA sequence such as a PstI site, corresponding to amino acids Leu-38 and Gln-39 just at the N-terminal region of loop 2, a HincII site at its C terminus at positions Leu-50 and Thr-51, a SacI site corresponding to amino acids Ser-123 and Ser-124 at the N-terminal region of loop 7, and an StyI site corresponding to amino acids Ser-152 and Leu-153. In addition, silent mutations were introduced to generate two restriction enzyme sites useful for mutants construction, an AatII site corresponding to amino acids Gly-144 and Ser-145. To generate the mutants we annealed single-stranded oligonucleotides with the desired sequences and proper single-strand ends that could be easily ligated to the ends generated by the restriction enzymes mentioned above. Oocyte Expression—Capped mRNA was synthesized in vitro using SP6 RNA polymerase, the mMESSAGEmMACHINE kit (Ambion) and the pSP64T derivative mentioned above. Defoliculated Xenopus leavis oocytes were injected with 5 ng of total cRNA in 50 nl of sterile water. All experiments were performed within 3–4 days after cRNA injection. Wild-type α7 mRNA was injected into oocytes from the same frog every time a mutant was tested. Consequently, mutant expression was expressed as a percentage of wild-type α7 expression observed in the same experiment. 125I-α-Bungarotoxin (α-Bgt) Binding Assays—Specific surface expression of 125I-α-Bgt binding sites was tested with 5 nm125I-α-Bgt as described (18García-Guzmán M. Sala F. Sala S. Campos-Caro A. Criado M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15198-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were incubated with 5 nm125I-α-Bgt for 2 h at 18 °C. At the end of the incubation, unbound 125I-α-Bgt was removed, oocytes were washed, and bound radioactivity was counted. Nonspecific binding was determined using noninoculated oocytes. Electrophysiological Recordings—Electrophysiological recordings were done as described previously (18García-Guzmán M. Sala F. Sala S. Campos-Caro A. Criado M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15198-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The velocity of application of agonists was 18–22 ml min–1. At the hemispheric surface of the oocyte facing the application tube the solution exchange rate followed an exponential time course with τ = 90 ms (19Sala F. Mulet J. Valor L.M. Criado M. Sala S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Functional expression of each construct was estimated as the peak ionic current evoked by 1-s application of 1 or 3 mm ACh at –80 mV, and no correction for desensitization was made. All experiments were done at room temperature (22 °C). Typical standard deviations for the current amplitudes for a series of oocytes from a single donor expressing wild-type receptors were around 21% of the mean values (range 13–52%). Dose-response curves were fitted using a nonlinear least squares algorithm to the Hill equation, I/Imax = 1/(1+(EC50/C)h), where EC50 is the agonist concentration that elicits the half-maximal response, h is the Hill coefficient, and C is the agonist concentration. A Charged to Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis Study of Loops 2 and 7—As an initial approach to determine which of the charged residues present in loops 2 and 7 of the nAChR α7 subunit play a role in the mechanism of channel activation (see Fig. 1), an Ala-scanning mutagenesis study was carried out. Expression of nAChRs was monitored by measuring α-Bgt binding sites at the external surface of oocytes, whereas the functional state of these receptors was tested by recording the ionic currents evoked by 1 or 3 mm ACh. It is important to emphasize the relevance of measuring not only the functional responses of mutant receptors but also their amount at the oocyte membrane so that a correlation (or lack of it) can be found for both magnitudes. Given the inherent variability of the oocyte expression system we used nAChR expression produced by the wild α7 subunit as a parallel control in all experiments. Thus, the results are expressed as a percentage of the α7 response (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Effect of alanine mutations in the charged residues of loop 2 and 7 of bovine α7 nAChRs. Expression of the indicated single mutants was tested by α-Bgt binding (black bars) and by the extent of the ionic currents evoked by application of 1 or 3 mm ACh (open bars). All data were normalized to those obtained with the wild-type α7 subunit, and means ± S.E. of at least two experiments from different donors (about 30 oocytes/experiment) are shown. Typical values obtained with the bovine α7 subunit were ∼10 fmol of bound α-Bgt/oocyte and ∼7 μA/oocyte at –80 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Receptor expression strongly decreased when residue Asp-42 was mutated to Ala. Currents evoked by ACh in this mutant also decreased in a parallel way. Therefore, it seems that this negatively charged residue is important for nAChR expression but not for gating. Mutant D44A barely produced nAChRs at the oocyte membrane, and no current was detected; therefore no conclusion about its involvement on channel activation could be drawn. Mutants E45A, K46A, and D135A showed reduced or no functional responses that did not match the amount of nAChRs present at the oocyte membrane. By contrast, mutant D128A showed a relatively high functional response not correlated with the strong decrease observed in nAChR expression. Finally, mutant R130A showed a moderate decrease in receptor expression with similar decrease in functional responses. Therefore, it can be concluded that residues Glu-45, Lys-46, Asp-128, and Asp-135 might be involved in the mechanism of channel activation and deserve further study. No Amino Acid Can Substitute Glu-45 and Asp-135 without Impairing Channel Function—Replacement of Glu-45 by a positively charged lysine strongly reduced receptor expression (Fig. 3). By contrast, the more conservative mutants E45Q and E45D expressed a significant amount of nAChRs at the oocyte membrane (Fig. 3). However, as it was observed with mutant E45A, ACh did not evoke detectable currents. Although the lack of functional responses impaired more detailed studies of the mentioned mutants, these results suggest that the presence of a glutamate at position 45 is necessary for an adequate functional response. Something similar took place at position 135. Thus, expression was strongly reduced to about 11% of the control in mutant D135A (Fig. 2), and the same happened with the more conservative mutations D135N and D135E (data not shown). The amount of mutant nAChRs present at the oocyte membrane was small, about 1.5 fmol of bound α-Bgt per oocyte, but it should have been enough to provide detectable currents if their functional properties were not greatly affected, as we have observed with other receptors. However, this was not the case, suggesting that an aspartate is required at position 135 for normal expression and function. A Positively Charged Residue Is Needed at Position 46 for Efficient Channel Gating—Mutant K46A reached expression levels similar to the wild-type receptor; however currents evoked by ACh were significantly lower, suggesting that gating was impaired (see below for a discussion on desensitization). This effect was even stronger with mutant K46E (Fig. 4), which was unable to show functional responses despite expressing a significant amount of receptors at the oocyte membrane (about half of the control). The same happened with mutant K46C (Fig. 4), although in this case expression levels decreased strongly. By contrast, substitution of lysine by the other positively charged amino acid, arginine (Fig. 4), barely affected expression and current levels, suggesting the requirement of a positive charge at position 46 for correct gating. As mutant K46A showed reduced but still well defined ionic currents, dose-response relationships could be obtained for five different agonists (Fig. 5 and Table I). In wild-type receptors, dimethylphenylpiperazinium, nicotine, cytisine, and choline evoked maximal responses ranging 80–100% of the control (ACh). However, in mutant K46A all responses to these four agonists were also reduced with respect to ACh (down to 60%), suggesting again a modification in the gating mechanism. Moreover, upon continuous stimulation of agonist, peak currents decayed at the same rate in all receptors and with several agonists (data not shown), arguing against effects on gross desensitization. In all cases changes in EC50 were not large, between 3- and 7-fold higher in mutant receptors, therefore, less than one order of magnitude. Thus, the observed changes could be mostly caused by alterations of the gating characteristics rather than to large modifications of agonist binding or desensitization properties.Table IPharmacological properties of wild-type (wt) and K46A and D128A mutant nAChRsAgonistα7 wtα7 K46Aα7 D128AImaxEC50(nH)ImaxEC50(nH)ImaxEC50(nH)%μm%μm%μmACh10050.3 ± 4.61.56100251 ± 181.5010049.3 ± 2.12.27DMPP92.3 ± 3.99.85 ± 0.741.6859.0 ± 1.970.3 ± 3.31.3169.5 ± 1.926.4 ± 2.61.51Nicotine85.0 ± 1.5107 ± 71.8160.0 ± 1.2290 ± 372.0171.6 ± 1.6107 ± 71.72Cytisine80.8 ± 6.529.1 ± 2.61.7559.3 ± 1.7157 ± 261.5473.3 ± 3.783.6 ± 10.81.56Choline98.5 ± 1.7268 ± 291.8859.5 ± 2.91467 ± 801.8296.1 ± 5.4476 ± 621.45 Open table in a new tab Is There a Salt Bridge between Lys-46 and Asp-266? —As previously indicated, Kash et al. (12Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) have demonstrated the relevance for channel gating of a direct electrostatic interaction between a positively charged residue in the M2-M3 linker of the GABAAR and some negatively charged residues of loops 2 and 7. One example of evidence for that was that the double reverse charge mutation restores receptor function that was previously lost with the single mutants. For this reason we also tested the double mutant K46D/D266K and the corresponding single mutants K46D and D266K in the α7 subunit (Fig. 6). Both single mutants yielded a significant amount of receptors at the oocyte membrane, 25% of the observed with wild-type α7 subunits, but these receptors were not activated by ACh (Fig. 6A). In the case of the double mutant K46D/D266K, no nAChRs were detected at the oocyte membrane suggesting that the double mutation is deleterious for receptor expression (Fig. 6A). An alternative strategy was then carried out, consisting of co-injecting wild-type and double mutant subunit RNAs in a proportion of 1 to 4, expecting to get expression of receptors in which mutant subunits would have been incorporated. These receptors could be compared then with the ones produced by only wild-type α7 RNA and also by co-injection of single mutants K46D and D266K with wild-type α7 in the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 6B, a significant amount of receptors was present at the oocyte membrane in all cases. Co-injection of α7 with either the single mutant K46D or the double mutant K46D/D266K produced ∼30% of the receptors observed with wild-type α7, whereas expression was lower with D266K. When the single mutant K46D was present, these receptors were not functional, whereas the ones with D266K and specially the double mutant showed significant currents, although to a lower degree (36 and 44% of wild-type α7 nAChRs alone) than expected from the extent of expressed receptors. The possibility that these receptors are only made by α7 subunits because the double mutant subunits were unable to assemble nAChRs appears unlikely, as in this case the currents evoked by ACh should be similar to the ones with α7 subunits alone; therefore, the currents would be larger if we consider the level of receptor expression. Moreover, the receptors obtained with the co-injection of the double mutant showed dose-response relationships different from the ones obtained with wild-type subunits (Fig. 6C), with larger EC50 for ACh and choline. In fact, these data confirm that although the double reverse charge mutation allows the expression of functional receptors when co-injected with wild-type α7 subunits, it cannot restore the normal function observed when α7 subunits are alone. Mutants at Position 128 Show Heterogeneous Behavior— Mutant D128A reached low expression levels, ∼15% of the observed with wild-type receptors. However, currents evoked by ACh were only reduced to about a half (Fig. 2) of the control, suggesting a certain “gain of function” effect. The possibility that this mutant had reduced affinity for α-Bgt (therefore showing reduced expression) was discarded because a higher concentration of α-Bgt labeled the same amount of nAChRs. The conservative mutant D128E showed a similar behavior (Fig. 7), with current levels close to the α7 controls despite that expression decreased to less than half of the controls. Other mutants like D128K and D128N did not yield any receptor expression (Fig. 7). Mutant D128A was studied in more detail by obtaining dose-response relationships for five different agonists (Table I). With the exception of choline, the relative increase in maximal responses is smaller for all other agonists when compared with ACh, suggesting again that the gating mechanism has been altered. Once again changes in desensitization rates were not apparent (not shown). With this gain of function effect increases in agonist potency should be expected, but the EC50 values for nicotine and ACh were the same as the ones obtained for α7 wild-type receptors, whereas changes in the EC50 values for the other agonists were small, between 1.7- and 2.8-fold higher in mutant receptors. Though a neat distinction between gating and binding could not be done when measuring macroscopic currents, the data suggest that the effect of the mutation is mainly on gating properties and is very small, if there is any effect at all, on binding properties. The model of activation of the nAChR proposed by Unwin and co-workers (10Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 20Unwin N. Miyazawa A. Li J. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) highlights the participation of the M2-M3 linker on the gating process as “receiver” (21Lester H.A. Dibas M.I. Dahan D.S. Leite J.F. Dougherty D.A. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 329-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) for conformational changes initiated at the agonist binding site. Because these two regions do not seem to be in direct contact, an intermediate “actuator” (21Lester H.A. Dibas M.I. Dahan D.S. Leite J.F. Dougherty D.A. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 329-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) appears to be required. According to crystallographical data from the ACh binding protein (11Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar), loops 2 and 7 are the best candidates for this role given their proximity to both the M2-M3 linker and the binding site. An excellent study combined mutagenesis of charged residues at the mentioned regions of the GABAAR with electrophysiological and cysteine cross-linking experiments to show that a direct electrostatic interaction between a positively charged residue at the M2-M3 linker and negatively charged residues of loops 2 and 7 was required for channel gating (12Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Such a direct interaction could not be demonstrated for the GlyR (13Schofield C.M. Jenkins A. Harrison N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34079-34083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14Absalom N.L. Lewis T.M. Kaplan W. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50151-50157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), although several charged residues in loops 2 and 7 were implicated in channel gating. In the present study we tested two hypotheses: first, that gating of α7 nAChRs requires, like GABAAR receptors, a direct electrostatic interaction between Asp-266 at the M2-M3 linker (8Campos-Caro A. Sala S. Ballesta J.J. Vicente-Agulló F. Criado M. Sala F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6118-6132Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and a positively charged residue at loop 2, Lys-46; second, that a broader network of charged residues present in these loops participates in the activation mechanism as it happens with the GlyR. For this reason, in addition to the positively charged residues mentioned above, negatively charged residues like Asp-42, Asp-44, Glu-45, Asp-128, and Asp-135 were also tested (see Fig. 1). As reviewed by Colquhoun (22Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), when comparing two receptors, the information obtained from maximum responses is limited by the existence of a correlation with the number of functional receptors and by errors that result from desensitization. In the present study the first concern is addressed by the use of α-Bgt binding to determine the amount of receptors present at the oocyte membrane and correlate the currents produced by them. Sucrose gradient sedimentation experiments of relevant mutant receptors (data not shown) indicate that they are in the typical pentameric form, and we assume that the detected binding sites correspond to well folded receptors, although there is no guarantee that all receptors so measured are functional. In this sense, a general conclusion is that all mutants, except K46A and K46R, showed a substantial decrease in receptor expression, suggesting that tight structural requirements for folding, assembly, and/or traffic exist in loops 2 and 7. Despite strong reductions in receptor expression, the amount of receptors present at the oocyte membrane was sufficient to detect measurable currents; consider, for instance, a typical amount of 1.5 fmol of bound α-Bgt/oocyte and an Imax of 1 μA(1 mm ACh and holding potential –80 mV) for a mutant expressing only 15% of the control α7 wild-type receptors. The other important question is whether the peak responses are affected differently by factors such as desensitization or channel block at the high agonist concentrations used. Concerning this point several data argue against a selective effect of the mutations on these processes: (a) all currents evoked upon continuous stimulation with high agonist concentrations decreased with the same time course in wild-type and mutant receptors (data not shown), and (b) mutations at the same positions in loops 2 and 7 have been shown not to affect desensitization in muscle nicotinic receptors (25Chakrapani S. Bailey T.D. Auerbach A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although we cannot absolutely rule out an effect of the mutations on very fast desensitization, which was out of reach of our experimental setup, in the present study we have considered maximal responses as an efficient indicator of gating mechanisms (see Ref. 22Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar for an ample discussion on the binding-gating problem). Mutants of the positively charged residue Lys-46 but not Arg-130 (for instance, mutants K46A and K46E) appeared to have altered gating mechanisms unless a positive charge was present (K46R). Therefore, a pairwise electrostatic interaction between Asp-266 and Lys-46 appeared plausible, and in this case the double charge reversal mutant K46D/D266K should have its function restored. However, it was not possible to test its activity because no mutant receptors were expressed. The cysteine cross-linking approach also was not possible with mutant K46C/D266C because of the same problem. Then we tried an alternative approach to this issue with co-injection experiments despite the impossibility of knowing exactly how many wild and mutant subunits conform a receptor pentamer. From the proportions of the RNAs used for co-injections (1:4, wild to mutant subunits) one should expect that mutant subunits are components of these mixed receptors, and some data favor this assumption; if pentamers were only made of wild-type subunits because mutant subunits are excluded of the assembly process, then the decrease in expression observed when mutant subunits are co-injected should not occur. However, it could be argued that mutant subunits are not excluded from this process but act as dominant negative mutants, inducing receptor degradation and consequently the mentioned reduction in receptor expression. In any case, the resultant receptors would be made of only wild-type subunits. However, this does not seem to be the case because these receptors showed different EC50 values for two different agonists (Fig. 6C) and smaller currents than expected from their expression levels (Fig. 6B). In fact, these properties, different from the ones observed with wild-type receptors, must be the outcome of the incorporation of mutant subunits into the pentamers. If this is true, and whatever their stoichiometry in them, the double charge reversal mutants cannot mimic the behavior of wild-type α7 subunits given the differences mentioned above. In contrast with GABAAR, a gating mechanism based solely on the electrostatic interaction between Lys-46 and Asp-266 does not seem to be operative in α7 nAChRs. A wide network of interactions would then be possible as polar and charged residues not only have pairwise interactions in proteins but also form structurally and functionally relevant networks able to link distant domains in proteins (23Herrga ̊rd S. Gibas C.J. Subramaniam S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2921-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Lee D.L. Ivaninskii S. Burkhard P. Hodges R.S. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1395-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Different residues, including Glu-45, Lys-46, Asp-128, and Asp-135, would participate in this network although with diverse requirements and roles. Thus, Glu-45 and Asp-135 do not even admit conservative mutations because mutants showed reduced or no functional responses in all cases. Glu-45 is present in all nAChR and GlyR subunits as well as in the β subunits of the GABAAR. In addition, the homologous residue Glu-53 in GlyRs (Fig. 8) was also shown to affect channel gating (14Absalom N.L. Lewis T.M. Kaplan W. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50151-50157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is an attractive candidate to form part of a global gating mechanism of this superfamily. Regarding Asp-135, it must play a pivotal role because this amino acid is present at homologous locations in all subunits of this gene superfamily. Moreover, homologous residues Asp-148 in GlyRs and Asp-149 in GABAARs (Fig. 8) have been found to be implicated in channel gating (12Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 13Schofield C.M. Jenkins A. Harrison N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34079-34083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14Absalom N.L. Lewis T.M. Kaplan W. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50151-50157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Schofield C.M. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10058-10063Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) suggesting that independently of which charged amino acid is present at the M2-M3 linker the presence of an aspartate residue at this location of loop 7 is essential. Recently, the gating parameters of many mutants of residues at loops 2 and 7 of the α1 nAChR have been reported (25Chakrapani S. Bailey T.D. Auerbach A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Whereas Glu-45 was not studied, the only analogous mutant of Asp-135 able to produce currents (D138E) did not show large differences in gating when compared with wild-type nAChRs, precluding a clear conclusion about the involvement of this amino acid on the gating mechanism of muscle type nAChRs. Notice, however, that in these type of mutant receptors, three subunits (γ, δ, and ϵ) would still have an aspartate at the mentioned position and therefore could contribute to the hypothetical network. Another class of residues is formed by Lys-46 and Asp-128, which tolerate exchange by other amino acids with the same charge. Lys-46 is also present in α2, α4, β1, and ϵ nAChR subunits and substituted by Arg in β2, β4, and γ subunits. It is absent only in the α1, α3, and δ subunits, although they must assemble with other subunits that have this positively charged residue. Regarding other ligand-gated ion channels, Lys-46 is also present in 5-HT3 receptors but absent in all glycine and GABAAR receptor subunits. Therefore, this amino acid could be a good candidate to integrate the gating mechanism in cationic but not anionic receptors. Miyazawa et al. (10Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) suggested that the hydrophobic residue α1V46, which is positionally equivalent to α7K46, could participate in the interaction with the M2-M3 linker that drives channel gating. Several mutants of α1V46 have been shown to have their gating properties modified (25Chakrapani S. Bailey T.D. Auerbach A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) suggesting that this position is important for the gating mechanism and confirming that this mechanism does not rely entirely on electrostatic interactions. Finally, mutants of Asp-128 (D128A and D128E) had larger functional responses (3- and 2-fold larger, respectively) than expected from their expression levels. Normally, a gain of function effect should produce an increase in agonist potency. Interestingly, D128A showed pharmacological properties similar to wild-type receptor, suggesting a complex behavior that we could not explain through simple kinetic schemes. Unfortunately, Chakrapani et al. (25Chakrapani S. Bailey T.D. Auerbach A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) did not include in their exhaustive study the homologous residue α1I130. Auerbach and co-workers (27Grosman C. Zhou M. Auerbach A. Nature. 2000; 403: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 28Cymes G.D. Grosman C. Auerbach A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5548-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) proposed a gradual series of transitions or “conformational wave” for the gating event. They also demonstrated that a negatively charged residue, Asp-97 of the nAChR α1 subunit, is an early link in the AChR gating reaction (29Chakrapani S. Bailey T.D. Auerbach A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 521-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which is probably followed by movements of the loop2/loop 7 domain (25Chakrapani S. Bailey T.D. Auerbach A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The amino acid residues that we have shown to affect the gating process are located in these loops and should integrate a mechanism able to transmit this conformational wave from the agonist binding site to the M2-M3 linker. The conformational wave would be the result of different interactions generated not only by ionic bonds but also by charge-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonds, and other types of interactions (30Nakamura H. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1996; 29: 1-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this way, a particular ligand-gated channel might show specific and perhaps subtle differences within a general gating mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1986685843,"In non-excitable cells, one major route for Ca2+ influx is through store-operated Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane. These channels are activated by the emptying of intracellular Ca2+ stores, and in some cell types store-operated influx occurs through Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels. Here, we report that intracellular Ca2+ modulates CRAC channel activity through both positive and negative feedback steps in RBL-1 cells. Under conditions in which cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration can fluctuate freely, we find that store-operated Ca2+ entry is impaired either following overexpression of a dominant negative calmodulin mutant or following whole-cell dialysis with a calmodulin inhibitory peptide. The peptide had no inhibitory effect when intracellular Ca2+ was buffered strongly at low levels. Hence, Ca2+-calmodulin is not required for the activation of CRAC channels per se but is an important regulator under physiological conditions. We also find that the plasma membrane Ca2+ATPase is the dominant Ca2+ efflux pathway in these cells. Although the activity of the Ca2+ pump is regulated by calmodulin, the store-operated Ca2+ entry is more sensitive to inhibition by the calmodulin mutant than by Ca2+ extrusion. Hence, these two plasmalemmal Ca2+ transport systems may differ in their sensitivities to endogenous calmodulin. Following the activation of Ca2+ entry, the rise in intracellular Ca2+ subsequently feeds back to further inhibit Ca2+ influx. This slow inactivation can be activated by a relatively brief Ca2+ influx (30-60 s); it reverses slowly and is not altered by overexpression of the calmodulin mutant. Hence, the same messenger, intracellular Ca2+, can both facilitate and inactivate Ca2+ entry through store-operated CRAC channels and through different mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W2116337796,"The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene product, pVHL, targets the α subunit of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF-α) for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This tumor suppressor function is mediated by the α- and β-domains responsible for assembling the pVHL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and for recognizing the prolyl-hydroxylated HIF-α, respectively. The molecular basis for a large number of tumor-derived mutations can be attributed to alterations that directly compromise the ability of pVHL to assemble the E3 or to contact the substrate. Here we describe a new mechanism of oncogenic inactivation by VHL missense mutations that lie in the L1 and L7 linker regions distal to the HIF-α-binding pocket. Employing molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the tumorigenic L1 loop mutation of Ser65 to Leu, deficient in promoting the degradation of HIF-α, disrupts the coordination of internal motions of the pVHL·HIF-1α complex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in addition to S65L, five other tumor-derived VHL mutations located within the L1 loop are each defective in mediating proteolysis of HIF-2α. Moreover, dynamic organization of pVHL·HIF-1α recognition is focally centered on Gln145 within the L7 loop, and its tumorigenic mutant Q145H abolishes almost all of the correlated dynamic motions. Intriguingly, Q145H, whereas defective in targeting cellular HIF-α for degradation, had an attenuated hydroxylation dependence in binding to HIF-1α in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest that specific association between pVHL and the hydroxylated HIF-α requires both the L1 and L7 loops to coordinate dynamic coupling among distant pVHL regions, whose mutational disruption inactivates VHL and is hence responsible for tumorigenesis. The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene product, pVHL, targets the α subunit of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF-α) for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This tumor suppressor function is mediated by the α- and β-domains responsible for assembling the pVHL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and for recognizing the prolyl-hydroxylated HIF-α, respectively. The molecular basis for a large number of tumor-derived mutations can be attributed to alterations that directly compromise the ability of pVHL to assemble the E3 or to contact the substrate. Here we describe a new mechanism of oncogenic inactivation by VHL missense mutations that lie in the L1 and L7 linker regions distal to the HIF-α-binding pocket. Employing molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the tumorigenic L1 loop mutation of Ser65 to Leu, deficient in promoting the degradation of HIF-α, disrupts the coordination of internal motions of the pVHL·HIF-1α complex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in addition to S65L, five other tumor-derived VHL mutations located within the L1 loop are each defective in mediating proteolysis of HIF-2α. Moreover, dynamic organization of pVHL·HIF-1α recognition is focally centered on Gln145 within the L7 loop, and its tumorigenic mutant Q145H abolishes almost all of the correlated dynamic motions. Intriguingly, Q145H, whereas defective in targeting cellular HIF-α for degradation, had an attenuated hydroxylation dependence in binding to HIF-1α in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest that specific association between pVHL and the hydroxylated HIF-α requires both the L1 and L7 loops to coordinate dynamic coupling among distant pVHL regions, whose mutational disruption inactivates VHL and is hence responsible for tumorigenesis.

Conversely, under hypoxia HIF-α subunits remain unhydroxylated and escape degradation mediated by the VEC. Stabilized HIF-α subunits bind to constitutively stable HIF-β/ARNT subunits forming an active HIF transcription complex that binds to the hypoxia-responsive elements in the promoters of hypoxia-inducible genes, thus activating the cellular responses to hypoxia (12Ivan M.

HIF target genes are involved in a variety of physiological processes such as angiogenesis, iron homeostasis, anaerobic metabolism, and cell growth and survival, including vascular endothelial growth factor, erythropoietin (EPO-1), glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT 1), insulin-like growth factor 2, and cyclin D1 (19Semenza G.L.

Cancer. 2004; 90: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). pVHL is comprised of two domains: the α-domain, which is required for binding ElonginC to assemble the VEC complex, and the β-domain, which recognizes and targets hydroxylated HIF-α subunits for ubiquitination. In the α-domain, the H1 helix plays a major role in establishing the interface with ElonginC and residues in the H2 and H3 helices contribute to the interaction as well (21Stebbins C.E. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). In the β-domain, the HIF-1α hydroxylated Pro564 (HyP564)-binding pocket is formed through a coordinated network of hydrogen bonds between residues located in S2, S3, S4, and S5 β-strands, as well as in the S4–S5 linker. The specificity of the binding pocket for only HyP564 is mediated through pVHL Ser111 and His115, which form one hydrogen bond each with the HyP564 4-hydroxyl group (22Hon W.C. Wilson M.I. Harlos K.

Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 2002; 296: 1886-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). In addition to its direct role in targeting HIF-α for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, pVHL was found to co-fractionate with fibronectin and required for proper assembly of the extracellular fibronectin matrix (24Ohh M. Yauch R.L. Lonergan K.M. Whaley J.M. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Louis D.N. Gavin B.J. Kley N. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Iliopoulos O. Mol.

Moreover, pVHL was identified as a microtubule-associated protein that can protect microtubules from depolymerization, and therefore was speculated to play a role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics (25Hergovich A. Lisztwan J. Barry R. Ballschmieter P. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). VHL mutations associated with tumor development have been identified throughout the open reading frame and map to residues on both α- and β-domains. Previous studies have documented that while frequent tumorigenic mutations in the α-domain, such as C162F and R167Q, lead to disassembly of the VEC complex, β-domain mutations that map to the HIF-α binding pocket of pVHL, such as Y98H, disrupt interaction with HIF-α (11Cockman M.E.

In this study, we employed both biochemical and computational studies to characterize oncogenic VHL mutations that occur in the L1 and L7 linker regions, both of which are distant to the HIF-α binding pocket. Our results provide evidence suggesting a significant role for the L1 and L7 loop residues in coordinating dynamic motions that are required for specific interaction between pVHL and prolyl-hydroxylated HIF-α. Dysregulation of such dynamic coordination by VHL mutations in these loops results in stabilization of HIF-α and may hence be responsible for human cancers. Cells—Human embryonic kidney cells (293T) and renal clear cell carcinoma cells 786-O (ATCC) were maintained in a humidified tissue culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Plasmids—pcDNA3.1-HIF-1α, pcDNA3.1-Flag-pVHL, and pMAL-PHD1 were kindly provided by L. E. Huang (National Cancer Institute), J. Frydman (Stanford University), and P. Ratcliffe (Oxford University), respectively. pGEX-4T-3-GST-VHL-ElonginB, pBB75-ElonginC, and HA-CUL2 were gifts from N. Pavletich (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center). VHL point mutations in both the FLAG-VHL and GST-VHL vectors were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene QuikChange) and verified by DNA sequencing. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal antibodies were purchased from the following sources: anti-HA (12CA5), Roche Diagnostics; anti-FLAG and anti-β-actin, Sigma; anti-VHL, BD Biosciences; and anti-ElonginC, Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit polyclonal anti-HIF-2α was obtained from Novus Biologicals. Purification of GST-VHL-ElonginC-ElonginB and MBP-PHD1 Expressed in Bacteria—The expression and isolation of GST-VHL-ElonginC-ElonginB subcomplex was carried out as described previously (21Stebbins C.E. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Briefly, a bicistronic plasmid encoding for GST-VHL or GST-VHL variants as indicated and ElonginB as well as a plasmid expressing ElonginC were co-transformed in BL21 cells, extracts were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. MBP-PHD1 was expressed in 1 liter of bacteria culture and extracts were made as described previously (15Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M.

The resin was washed several times with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin and antipain) and the bound protein was eluted with 10 mm maltose in buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin and antipain). Eluates were dialyzed against buffer B and concentrated (Amicon) to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. Aliquots were kept at -80 °C. Assembly of the VEC E3 Complex in 293T Cells—Cells (293T) were co-transfected with pcDNA3-HA-CUL2 (5 μg) and pcDNA3.1-Flag-VHL (5 μg) that encodes either the wild type or mutant pVHL, using FuGENE 6 transfectant reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics). Transfected cells were harvested 48 h later and washed with phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml/plate with buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin and antipain) and Dounce homogenized on ice. Salt (NaCl) was added slowly while stirring to a final concentration of 0.2 m, and the lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was ultracentrifuged in a Beckman Ti45 rotor at 37,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C, and the extracts were stored in aliquots at -80 °C. To immunopurify the VEC complex, extracts (1 mg of protein) were mixed with M2 beads (20 μl) for 16 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with buffer D (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) and phosphate-buffered saline. Bound proteins were released by boiling the beads in SDS loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted with antibodies as indicated. Degradation of HIF-2α—Cells (786-O) were transfected with pcDNA3-Flag-VHL (5 μg) that encodes either the wild type or mutant pVHL using FuGENE 6 Transfectant reagent. Proteasomal inhibition was performed by treatment with MG132 (5 μm) for 4–6 h before harvesting. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection in phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer E containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin and antipain, and sonicated. Following centrifugation, soluble extracts (50 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was probed with antibodies as indicated. In Vitro Hydroxylation-dependent HIF-1α Binding—HIF-1α was hydroxylated based on a protocol by Bruick and McKnight (18Bruick R.K. McKnight S.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar). Briefly, the in vitro translated 35S-HIF-1α from the rabbit reticulolysates (35S-IVT-HIF-1α, 10 μl) was incubated with MBP-PHD1 (0.25 μg) in a reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm ketoxoglutarate, 2 mm ascorbic acid, and 250 μm FeSO4. The incubation was for 30 min at 30 °C. To measure the interaction between the VEC E3 and hydroxylated HIF-1α, the hydroxylation mixture was mixed with the E3 complex immobilized on M2 beads (20 μl), prepared as described above, and maintained in buffer F (200 μl) that contains 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Following incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the resulting beads were washed 3 times with buffer D and once with phosphate-buffered saline. Bound proteins were released by boiling the beads in SDS loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. In Vitro Ubiquitination of HIF-1α—The in vitro ubiquitination of HIF-1α was carried out using conditions similar to those for the IκBα reaction (28Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z.

The reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli loading buffer and boiled for 3 min prior to 6% SDS-PAGE analysis followed by autoradiography. Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Analysis of Coupling between HIF-1α and Distant pVHL Sites—To examine the effects of tumor-derived mutations in pVHL that are distant to the HIF-1α binding site, and that do not disrupt the folding and assembly of the pVHL-ElonginC-ElonginB complex, we calculated the canonical ensembles of the pVHL·HIF-1α complex expected under physiological conditions. Crystallographic structure of the HIF-1α peptide bound to pVHL-ElonginC-ElonginB (23Min J.H. Yang H. Ivan M. Gertler F. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 2002; 296: 1886-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) was used as the starting configuration. ElonginB, ElonginC, as well as crystallographically disordered residues 54–60 of pVHL and 556–560 of HIF-1α were omitted. The resulting structure was solvated under periodic boundary conditions using a 80 × 80 × 80 Å3 cubic box of equilibrated TIP3 water (30Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W.

Biopolymers. 1999; 49: 167-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The resulting system was heated using molecular dynamics with a linear gradient of 20 K/ps to 310 K, and equilibrated for 1.1 ns in the isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble at 310 K and 1 atmosphere, using a 2-fs integration time step, SHAKE to constrain hydrogen atoms, and particle mesh Ewald (PME) summation to calculate electrostatic interactions, as implemented in NAMD2 (33Kale L. Skeel R. Bhandarkar M. Brunner R. Gursoy A. Krawetz N. Phillips J. Shinozaki A. Varadarajan K. Schulten K. J. Comp. Phys. 1999; 151: 283-312Crossref Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). The calculated molecular dynamics trajectory was sampled every 0.1 ps, while omitting the first 100 ps during which thermalization was still occurring as judged from analysis of energy fluctuations. To understand the dynamic and thermodynamic coupling between the HIF-1α binding site and pVHL regions distant to it, we calculated the covariance of backbone Cα atom positions in the pVHL·HIF-1α complex, according to: cov(xi,xj) = ([xi - (xi)][xj - (xj)]) with the resultant normalized covariance matrix containing elements between -1 and +1, indicating positions that are coupled negatively (hinge-like motion) and positively (breathing-type motion), respectively. Positions that are not dynamically or thermodynamically coupled yield correlation coefficients of near zero. Such an analysis is expected to reveal the effects of mutation on the fs-ps atomic motion of the bound pVHL·HIF-1α complex. Thus, whereas it captures the entropic contributions to the bound state, it does not take into account effects on either the unbound or transition states, both of which may contribute to the recognition and binding of HIF-1α in vivo. In this sense, the dynamical basis of the mechanism of S65L and Q145H mutants presented below should be considered as a component of a likely more complex phenomenon. It should be pointed out that because of the short simulation length (1 ns), we observed only dynamical perturbations but not structural rearrangements. This is consistent with the absence of structural rearrangements in the course of the simulations of the wild type pVHL (root mean structural deviation of backbone Cα <1.7 Å), and of significant differences between the wild type and pVHL S65L mutant (root mean structural deviation of backbone Cα <1.8 Å). In addition, as shown in Figs. 3, A and B,6A, and 8B, the VHL mutations examined in this study are all capable of interacting with ElonginC to form the VHL E3 complex. These observations are in accord with the notion that there are no major structural alterations with VHL S65L or Q145H mutants that may influence the overall stability of the protein.Fig. 6Oncogenic pVHL N-terminal loop mutants are defective in HIF-α binding and degradation. A, tumorigenic pVHL N-terminal loop mutants are functional in VEC assembly. Cells (293T) were co-transfected with FLAG-VHL or mutants as indicated and hemagglutinin-CUL2, and extracts were immunopurified on M2 beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot as described in the legend to Fig. 3B.

In this assay, 35S-HIF-1α was hydroxylated by PHD1 and subsequently bound to E3, which was immunopurified on M2 beads. Following the addition of Ub, E1, and E2, Ub was covalently ligated to the E3-bound substrate, generating high molecular weight HIF-1α-Ub conjugates, which were measured by autoradiographic analysis. As shown by the titration experiment, Ubc5c efficiently ubiquitinated HIF-1α in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–5). To assess the kinetics of Ubc5c in this reaction, we examined the efficiency of HIF-1α ubiquitination as a function of time. Very high molecular weight substrate-Ub conjugates formed after 9 min, and the level of polyubiquitinated substrate increased over time with a concomitant decrease of the unmodified substrate (Fig. 1A, lanes 6–10). We next tested Cdc34, an E2 of the SCF complexes, for its ability to support VEC-catalyzed ubiquitination of HIF-1α in the reconstituted in vitro system. In comparison to Ubc5c, Cdc34 was able to ubiquitinate HIF-1α but required a 4-fold increase in enzyme concentration (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–4). Graphically, the kinetics of HIF-1α ubiquitination by Cdc34 and Ubc5c show a similar rate (Fig. 1, A and B). Both E2s formed highly conjugated polyubiquitinated chains on the substrate, although Cdc34 showed more heterogeneity in the chains compared with those of Ubc5c (compare Fig. 1, A, lanes 9 and 10, to B, la"
https://openalex.org/W2023259843,"An earlier developed purified cell-free system was used to explore the potential of two RNA-directed RNA polymerases (RdRps), Qβ phage replicase and the poliovirus 3Dpol protein, to promote RNA recombination through a primer extension mechanism. The substrates of recombination were fragments of complementary strands of a Qβ phage-derived RNA, such that if aligned at complementary 3′-termini and extended using one another as a template, they would produce replicable molecules detectable as RNA colonies grown in a Qβ replicase-containing agarose. The results show that while 3Dpol efficiently extends the aligned fragments to produce the expected homologous recombinant sequences, only nonhomologous recombinants are generated by Qβ replicase at a much lower yield and through a mechanism not involving the extension of RNA primers. It follows that the mechanisms of RNA recombination by poliovirus and Qβ RdRps are quite different. The data favor an RNA transesterification reaction catalyzed by a conformation acquired by Qβ replicase during RNA synthesis and provide a likely explanation for the very low frequency of homologous recombination in Qβ phage.

Recombinations (sequence exchange and rearrangements) between and within RNA molecules are rare but biologically important events contributing to the evolution and diversity of RNA viruses (1King A.M.Q.

Chemical Rubber Company Press, Boca Raton, FL1988: 167-185Google Scholar). In contrast to splicing and other types of regular RNA rearrangements, recombinations occur without apparent sequence or structure specificity (1King A.M.Q. Domingo E. Holland J.J. Ahlquist P. RNA Genetics. II. Chemical Rubber Company Press, Boca Raton, FL1988: 149-165Google Scholar, 2Lai M.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 61-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are indications that recombination may occur between cellular RNAs (4Chetverin A.B. Semin. Virol. 1997; 8: 121-129Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 5Gmyl A.P. Belousov E.V. Maslova S.V.

Spontaneous Mg2+-catalyzed rearrangements in RNA sequences (7Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Chetverin A.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) might have been a mechanism for evolution in the prebiotic RNA world and might have evolved into contemporary sequence-specific ribozyme-catalyzed reactions (8Spirin A.S.

RNA recombination was discovered more than 40 years ago as an exchange of genetic markers between polioviruses (10Hirst G.K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1962; 27: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 11Ledinko N. Virology. 1963; 20: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and since then similar approaches were used to demonstrate that genomes of RNA viruses of animals, plants, and bacteria are all capable of recombination (2Lai M.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 61-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Chetverin A.B. Semin. Virol. 1997; 8: 121-129Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 12Bujarski J. Semin.

However, such in vivo experiments utilizing living cells, as well as in vitro studies that used crude cell lysates could not uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms or even definitely answer the question if recombining entities were RNA molecules themselves or their cDNA copies, because every living cell contained enzymes capable of reverse transcription and appropriate dNTP substrates. It became evident that further progress in this field depended on the availability of adequate in vitro systems whose composition and other parameters can be strictly controlled by the experimenter (2Lai M.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 61-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Agol V.I. Semin. Virol. 1997; 8: 77-84Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The first example of such a sort has been the cell-free system employing purified Qβ replicase, RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp) 1The abbreviations used are: RdRp, RNA-directed RNA polymerase; rNTPs, ribonucleoside triphosphates; PAAE mechanism, primer alignment and extension mechanism; 3Dpol, poliovirus RdRp; RQ RNA, replicable by Qβ replicase, a non-genomic RNA capable of exponential amplification by Qβ replicase; 3′C fragment, the complementary copy of the 3′ fragment; nt, nucleotide(s).1The abbreviations used are: RdRp, RNA-directed RNA polymerase; rNTPs, ribonucleoside triphosphates; PAAE mechanism, primer alignment and extension mechanism; 3Dpol, poliovirus RdRp; RQ RNA, replicable by Qβ replicase, a non-genomic RNA capable of exponential amplification by Qβ replicase; 3′C fragment, the complementary copy of the 3′ fragment; nt, nucleotide(s). of bacteriophage Qβ (15Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Cell. 1997; 88: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The system also includes two RNA molecules, “5′ fragment” and “3′ fragment,” whose sequences supplement each other to the entire sequence of RQ135 RNA, an efficient Qβ replicase template (16Munishkin A.V. Voronin L.A. Ugarov V.I. Bondareva L.A. Chetverina H.V. Chetverin A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and are derived from the 5′ and 3′ segments of that RNA, respectively. None of the fragments alone can be amplified by Qβ replicase; however, fusion of their sequences in a manner as they are arranged in the original RQ RNA results in the appearance of replicable molecules (15Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Cell. 1997; 88: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), which are detected and counted by using the Qβ replicase version of the molecular colony technique (17Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Munishkin A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Chetverina H.V. Chetverin A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2349-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To this end, a mixture of the fragments is seeded on a Qβ replicase-containing agarose layer, which is then covered with a nylon membrane impregnated with replicase substrate ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs) to initiate replication. As the reaction takes place in agarose, copies of replicable RNAs concentrate around the progenitor templates in the form of RNA colonies. The colonies are detected by hybridizing the membrane with a labeled probe, and their number reflects the recombination frequency. Experiments in this system proved that recombination can occur between RNA molecules directly, without involving DNA intermediates (15Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Cell. 1997; 88: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, many features of the cell-free RNA recombination appeared to be different from those usually observed in the in vivo studies. Studies on recombination in RNA viruses mainly revealed homologous recombination (1King A.M.Q. Domingo E. Holland J.J. Ahlquist P. RNA Genetics. II. Chemical Rubber Company Press, Boca Raton, FL1988: 149-165Google Scholar, 2Lai M.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 61-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which sequences surrounding the crossover site in the recombination substrates (recombining RNAs or segments of an RNA molecule) and in the product molecule are entirely or essentially identical to each other. To explain homologous recombination, a template switch (copy choice) mechanism was proposed (19Cooper P.D. Steiner-Pryor S. Scotti P.D. Delong D. J. Gen. Virol. 1974; 23: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), according to which the recombinant molecule is generated as a by-product of RNA synthesis by viral RdRp, which after copying a portion of the first (“donor”) template, occasionally switches to another (“acceptor”) template containing a sequence complementary to the growing end of the nascent strand. If that mechanism operated in the cell-free Qβ system, the 3′ and 5′ fragments would serve as donor and acceptor templates, respectively (Fig. 1A). However, no homologous recombinants were generated in this system, even though the fragments were provided with homologous foreign sequences to facilitate template switching. Most recombinant molecules contained the entire sequence of the 5′ fragment fused with sequence of the 3′ fragment, either intact or 5′-truncated to a various extent (Fig. 1B; Ref. 15Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Cell. 1997; 88: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Most importantly, recombination was totally prevented when the 3′ hydroxyl at the 5′ fragment terminus was either removed by periodate oxidation or blocked by a phosphate group. The key role of the 3′ hydroxyl of the acceptor template could not be accounted for by the template switch mechanism, but well conformed to a hypothesis that RNA recombination occurs as a transesterification reaction in which the 3′ hydroxyl of the 5′ fragment attacks phosphate groups within the 3′ fragment. In the absence of any indication of the ability of RNA polymerases to promote such reactions, it was suggested that recombinants arose because of a site-nonspecific self-splicing activity of RNA molecules (15Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Cell. 1997; 88: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Such an RNA activity was indeed detected with the use of a modified experimental scheme, in which, before applying to the Qβ replicase-containing agarose, a reaction mixture was oxidized with periodate to suppress further recombination by eliminating any free 3′ hydroxyls at the recombining RNA molecules (7Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Chetverin A.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the spontaneous recombinations between RNA molecules appeared to be several orders of magnitude less frequent than in the presence of Qβ replicase. Moreover, they did not require free 3′ hydroxyl groups, indicating that a quite different reaction chemistry was employed, most probably, a Mg2+-catalyzed RNA cleavage generating fragments with 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate and 5′ hydroxyl termini, which are then cross-ligated. These observations suggested that the 3′ hydroxyl-dependent RNA recombinations are somehow promoted by Qβ replicase (7Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Chetverin A.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Chetverin A.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The results obtained in the cell-free Qβ system stimulated attempts to detect similar phenomena in vivo, by transfecting susceptible cells with two supplementing fragments of the genome of an RNA virus, or with inactivated genome and a complementing fragment. Experiments with derivatives of poliovirus (5Gmyl A.P. Belousov E.V. Maslova S.V. Khitrina E.V. Chetverin A.B. Agol V.I. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8958-8965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gmyl A.P. Korshenko S.A. Belousov E.V. Khitrina E.V. Agol V.I. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1221-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (6Gallei A. Pankraz A. Thiel H-J. Becher P. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6271-6281Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) RNAs demonstrated that viable viruses could be rescued even if none of the recombination substrates could be translated or if translation could not result in the active viral RdRp. Similarly to the spontaneous rearrangements observed in the Qβ system, this nonreplicative recombination was not affected by elimination of the 3′ hydroxyls. Moreover, its frequency increased when the 5′ and 3′ fragments bore 3′ phosphoryl and 5′ hydroxyl groups, respectively, suggesting an involvement of the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate intermediate (5Gmyl A.P. Belousov E.V. Maslova S.V. Khitrina E.V. Chetverin A.B. Agol V.I. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8958-8965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gmyl A.P. Korshenko S.A. Belousov E.V. Khitrina E.V. Agol V.I. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1221-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Crossing poliovirus RNA fragments overlapping within a nonessential segment of the 5′-untranslated region resulted in the rescue of only nonhomologous recombinants (5Gmyl A.P. Belousov E.V. Maslova S.V. Khitrina E.V. Chetverin A.B. Agol V.I. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8958-8965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the same time, only homologous and aberrant homologous recombinants that retained the translation reading frame were rescued when RNA fragments overlapped within the sequence coding for protein 3Dpol (poliovirus RdRp) (21Gmyl A.P. Korshenko S.A. Belousov E.V. Khitrina E.V. Agol V.I. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1221-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), indicating that natural selection can considerably distort the results of in vivo experiments. Quite different results were obtained in another type of in vivo experiments, in which an expressible cDNA clone of poliovirus capable of producing active RdRp, but incapable of replication because of two point mutations in the 5′-untranslated region, was rescued by recombination with a mutation-free 5′-untranslated region fragment (22Pierangeli A. Bucci M. Forzan M. Pagnotti P. Equestre M. Pérez Bercoff R. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1889-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In these experiments, no viruses were rescued if the 5′ fragment had been modified at the 3′ terminus with cordycepin (3′-deoxyadenosine). Thus, as with Qβ replicase, RNA recombination in the presence of poliovirus RdRp appeared to be entirely dependent on the availability of the free 3′ hydroxyl of the 5′ fragment. However, in contrast to the Qβ replicase-promoted reaction (15Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Cell. 1997; 88: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and RdRp-independent poliovirus RNA recombination in vivo (5Gmyl A.P. Belousov E.V. Maslova S.V. Khitrina E.V. Chetverin A.B. Agol V.I. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8958-8965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), only homologous recombinants were produced, even though coding sequences were not involved. To explain their observations, the authors proposed a “primer alignment and extension” (PAAE) mechanism, in which no templates are switched. Instead, a pre-existing fragment of poliovirus RNA (in nature, this can be a fragment generated by abortive synthesis or by an enzymatic degradation exposing the 3′-OH termini) is extended by RdRp using the strand of opposite polarity as a template, to which it hybridizes by a complementary 3′ terminal segment. The striking similarity of the responses of Qβ and poliovirus systems to the elimination of the 3′ hydroxyl of the 5′ fragment, together with the fact that Qβ replicase is involved in the 3′ hydroxyl-dependent recombination, raised the possibility that similar mechanisms operate in both systems. However, the absence of homologous recombination in the Qβ system remained unexplained. Whether the latter fact reflects a fundamental mechanistic difference between Qβ replicase and poliovirus RdRp, or the mere limitations of the respective in vitro and in vivo systems and/or sequence or structure dissimilarities of the recombination substrates remains to be answered. To resolve these alternatives, we compared effects of the two RdRps under similar conditions and with the same RNA substrates, using the cell-free Qβ system to monitor RNA recombination. The results of these studies demonstrate that although ongoing RNA synthesis is required for the generation of recombinant RNAs by both Qβ replicase and 3Dpol, the mechanisms employed by the two enzymes are entirely different. In particular, whereas the PAAE mechanism is efficiently used by 3Dpol to generate recombinant molecules from RNA fragments of opposite polarities, it is totally rejected by Qβ replicase. Enzymes—Qβ replicase was isolated from Escherichia coli HB101 cells transformed with plasmid pRep (23Shaklee P.N. Miglietta J.J. Palmenberg A.C. Kaesberg P. Virology. 1988; 163: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) as described (24Blumenthal T.

Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) as a template and primers that introduced an upstream NcoI site and a downstream His6-coding sequence followed by the BamHI site, cloned in pET15b between sites NcoI and BamHI and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (27Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). A highly purified 3Dpol protein containing the hexahistidine tag peptide at the C terminus was isolated by chromatography on Zn2+-iminodiacetate-Sepharose CL-4B (28Lindner P. Guth B. Wülfing C. Krebber C. Steipe B. Müller F. Plükthun A. Methods. 1992; 4: 41-56Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar) from a cell lysate prepared in a buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (29Neufeld K.L. Richards O.C. Ehrenfeld E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24212-24219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), dialyzed against the same buffer containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, and after addition of glycerol to 50%, was stored at –20 °C. The resulting preparation was active in the poly(A)-directed synthesis of poly(U) (30Flanegan J.B. van Dyke T.A. J. Virol. 1979; 32: 155-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and contained no detectable activities of E. coli RNA polymerase, polynucleotide phosphorylase, or ribonucleases. RNA Fragments—The 5′ and 3′ fragments were synthesized by run-off transcription with T7 polymerase using corresponding plasmids digested with appropriate restriction endonucleases, and gel-purified as described (15Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Cell. 1997; 88: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Plasmid for the synthesis of the 3′C fragment was prepared by a PCR templated with a pUC18-derived plasmid, in which a T7 promoter/RQ135–1(+) cDNA construct was inserted between sites HindIII and SmaI (31I Morozov Yu.

The PCR product was digested at the HindIII site, blunt-ended by filling in the recessed 3′ terminus with Klenow enzyme, digested at the PstI site, and ligated into plasmid pUC18 that had been digested at PstI and SmaI and dephosphorylated. The primary structure of the resulting plasmid was checked by sequencing. RNA Recombination—To separate the recombination and replication steps (as in experiments of Figs. 2 and 5A), the earlier devised procedure (7Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Chetverin A.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was employed. Unless indicated otherwise, the recombining fragments (3 × 1011 molecules each) were annealed in a 2 times incubation buffer (see figure legends), not including Mg2+ and rNTPs, by incubating during 2 min in a boiling bath followed by cooling to ≈30 °C during 1 h. After incubation under specified conditions followed by the addition of EDTA to chelate all Mg2+, the reaction mixture was extracted with phenol/chloroform (32Sambrook J. Russell D.W.

In the experiments of Figs. 3 and 5A, RNA colonies were grown in round (14 mm diameter, 0.4 mm thick) polyacrylamide gels that were earlier used for growing DNA colonies (34Chetverina H.V. Samatov T.R. Ugarov V.I. Chetverin A.B. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Pre-cast and dried gels were reconstituted by soaking in 70 μl of a solution containing the RNA sample and all the replication reaction components but rNTPs that were introduced with a nylon membrane covering the gel. As compared with agarose gels, the use of polyacrylamide gels resulted in a 5–10 times higher recovery of recombinant RNAs. In either case, the final concentrations of reaction components were: 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 35 μg/ml Qβ replicase, and 1 mm each of rNTPs. After incubation during 1 h at 22 °C, the membranes were fixed (18Chetverina H.V. Chetverin A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2349-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and hybridized with a 32P-labeled 5′(BamHI) fragment to reveal the colonies by autoradiography (15Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Cell. 1997; 88: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Then RNAs were extracted from gels, cloned, and sequenced (15Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Cell. 1997; 88: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). RNA Synthesis Is Required for the Generation of Recombinant RNAs by Qβ Replicase—To investigate requirements of the 3′ hydroxyl-dependent recombination, we used the experimental approach earlier established for exploring the ability of RNA molecules to self-recombine (7Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Chetverin A.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The same polarity 5′ and 3′ fragments of RQ135 RNA were incubated under chosen conditions with or without the addition of the components of the cell-free replication system (Qβ replicase, rNTPs, and Mg2+), and before assaying for the presence of RNAs capable of replicating in a Qβ replicase-containing gel, the incubation mixture was treated with sodium periodate and melted. This separated the recombination and replication events, and RNA colonies only grew if recombination had occurred before the oxidation step. Control samples, in which a pre-oxidized 5′ fragment substituted for the normal one, were run in parallel to ascertain if the observed recombination was 3′ hydroxyl-dependent. We observed no recombination between the RNA fragments above the level of spontaneous reaction (7Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Chetverin A.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) unless the incubation mixture contained all the reagents needed for RNA synthesis, including each of the four rNTPs (not shown). Fig. 2A shows that recombination requires the same concentration of the initiating nucleotide GTP as does copying of the 3′ fragment (monitored by the generation of a double-stranded product) that has inherited the initiation site of RQ135 RNA. Requirements of the 5′ fragment copying are saturated at a lower GTP concentration, as reported earlier (35Ugarov V.I. Demidenko A.A. Chetverin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44139-44146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, recombination between the 5′ and 3′ RQ135 RNA fragments is observed under conditions that provide for their copying by Qβ replicase. Whereas recombination was always accompanied by copying of the 3′ fragment (the donor template in terms of the template switch mechanism), it was not firmly linked with copying of the 5′ fragment (the acceptor template). For example, elimination of the 3′ hydroxyl group of the 5′ fragment by periodate oxidation prevents recombination (Fig. 2A and Ref. 15Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Cell. 1997; 88: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), but only slightly affects synthesis of the complementary copy (35Ugarov V.I. Demidenko A.A. Chetverin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44139-44146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A reverse example is provided by the PstI and ΔEcoRI variants of the 5′ fragment, which are hardly copied by Qβ replicase (Fig. 1 in Ref. 35Ugarov V.I. Demidenko A.A. Chetverin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44139-44146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but are excellent recombination substrates (not shown). Fig. 2B shows that chain terminator 3′-deoxy-ATP (cordycepin 5′-triphosphate) inhibits recombination (as well as the synthesis of full-sized complementary copies of the recombining fragments, not shown) if added to the reaction mixture at a 20:1 ratio to ATP, at which it is expected to be used by Qβ replicase instead of ATP at about a 20% probability (36Kramer F.R. Mills D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5334-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It follows that RNA synthesis is required for recombination, rather than merely accompanying it.

https://openalex.org/W2026404289,"The microtubule (MT)-associated DCX protein plays an essential role in the development of the mammalian cerebral cortex. We report on the identification of a protein kinase, doublecortin kinase-2 (DCK2), with a domain (DC) highly homologous to DCX. DCK2 has MT binding activity associated with its DC domain and protein kinase activity mediated by a kinase domain, organized in a structure in which the two domains are functionally independent. Overexpression of DCK2 stabilizes the MT cytoskeleton against cold-induced depolymerization. Autophosphorylation of DCK2 strongly reduces its affinity for MTs. DCK2 and DCX mRNAs are nervous system-specific and are expressed during the period of cerebrocortical lamination. DCX is down-regulated postnatally, whereas DCK2 persists in abundance into adulthood, suggesting that the DC sequence has previously unrecognized functions in the mature nervous system. In sympathetic neurons, DCK2 is localized to the cell body and to the terminal segments of axons and dendrites. DCK2 may represent a phosphorylation-dependent switch for the reversible control of MT dynamics in the vicinity of neuronal growth cones.

In these disorders the defective DCX protein fails to perform its normal embryonic function of mediating the migration of neuroblasts from the proliferative ventricular zone toward the pial surface.

Although its kinase domain is related to those of calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinases, its catalytic activity is not regulated by CaM (19Shang L. Kwon Y.-G. Nandy S. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2185-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here, as in Shang et al. (19Shang L. Kwon Y.-G. Nandy S. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2185-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), it is referred to as doublecortin kinase-1 (DCK1), 2DCK1 has also been referred to as CaMKLK, cpg 16, DCaMKL1, DCLK, and KIAA0369. by virtue of its having a DC domain as a distinctive feature. Isoforms of DCK1 are generated by two mechanisms. Alternate promoter usage leads to protein products with identical kinase domains but either full-length (340 residues, α) or N-terminally truncated (31 residues, β) DC/SP domains. Consequently, DCK1-α binds MTs, whereas in DCK1-β, loss of the DC domain, leaving only a residual SP domain, results in an inability to bind MTs. Additional isoforms of DCK1 are produced by alternate splicing (13Omori Y. Suzuki M. Ozaki K. Harada Y. Nakamura Y. Takahashi E. Fujiwara T. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 43: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Vreugdenhil E. Engels B. Middelburg R. van Koningsbruggen S. Knol J. Veldhuisen B. Ron de Kloet E. Mol.

DCK1 is encoded by a single gene mapped to human chromosome 13q13, and therefore is distinct from DCX on human chromosome Xq22.3-23. Although DCK1 is the only DCK gene described to date in vertebrates, predicted DC domain-kinase fusions are encoded by the genomes of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans. The latter (ZYG-8) has been characterized and shown to be important for mitotic spindle positioning during C. elegans embryogenesis (22Gonczy P. Bellanger J.-M. Kirkham M. Pozniakowski A. Baumer K. Phillips J.B. Hyman A.A. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 363-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We report here the identification and characterization of a novel mammalian DCK gene, DCK2, and its transcript and protein products. The patterns of expression, functional activities, regulation, and localization of DCK2 suggest that it functions in parallel to, or in concert with, other members of the DC gene family (DC domain-encoding genes) in events important for neural development and, potentially, in those characteristic of mature nervous systems. cDNA Cloning and Sequence Analysis of DCK2—RNA used for RT-PCR and 5′-RACE was prepared from the brains of adult Sprague-Dawley rats by CsCl density gradient centrifugation (23Kingston R.E. Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Curr. Protocols Mol. Biol. 1996; 36: 4.2.1-4.2.7Google Scholar). To obtain a probe for cDNA library screening, RT-PCR was performed using PCR primers based on the sequence of an EST (GenBank™ accession number W30246) encoding a putatively novel DCK (DCK is a protein kinase with a DC domain). Note that the term does not necessarily imply an ability to phosphorylate doublecortin). A 321-bp fragment was amplified, sequenced to confirm its identity, and biotinylated by random oligonucleotide-primed labeling using biotin-N6-dATP as per the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A cDNA library prepared from whole brain of Sprague-Dawley rats (10-12 weeks) in λgt10 (Clontech) was screened using the biotinylated fragment described above as probe. Positive plaques were detected by streptavidin-HRP binding and ECL as per the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), rescreened (plaque-purified) twice, and the inserts sequenced. The library clones yielded 2.5 kb of overlapping sequence representing about two-thirds of the protein coding region, the stop codon, and all of the 3′-untranslated region including a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) and poly(A) tail. An additional 5′ sequence was obtained as follows. 5′-RACE was performed by reverse transcription of rat brain RNA using a primer based on a 5′ sequence obtained from the library clones. First strand cDNA was dC-tailed and amplified with anchor and nested primers, re-amplified with an additional nested primer, and cloned in Escherichia coli. Sequencing of multiple independent clones extended the sequence another 168 bp toward the 5′-end. RT-PCR was then carried out using a reverse PCR primer based upon the 5′ sequence of RACE clones and a forward primer based on a rat EST sequence (GenBank™ accession number AA818566) overlapping with the RACE-generated sequence. The obtained sequence included the translational start codon and 80 bp of 5′-untranslated region. Finally, RT-PCR of rat brain RNA was used to confirm the complete protein coding sequence. The sequence of DCK2 (Fig. 1A) has been deposited in GenBank™. The evidence for alternate exons and single nucleotide variations (apparent polymorphisms) is documented in their respective NCBI sequence records.Fig. 1Primary structure analysis of DCK2. A, nucleotide and amino acid sequences of DCK2 (GenBank™ accession numbers AY673997, AY673998, AY673999, and AY673000). Nucleotides are numbered excluding the poly(A) tail. Exons are labeled above their starting nucleotides. Alternate exons (E5a and E17a) are included in the sequence. Variable inclusion of E17a leads to alternate C termini as shown.

Missense mutations reported in patients with X-Lissencepaly/doublecortex syndrome are shown as asterisks above the affected residues.

DCK2K438A (KIN-) was created by DpnI-based mutagenesis using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). DCK2-(318-767) (ΔDC) was created by PCR amplification of residues encoding amino acids 318-767, with the addition of an N-terminal initiator Met for the untagged construct. Correct sequences and reading frames of plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pEGFP-N2 expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein was from Clontech. Antibodies—A synthetic peptide representing the unique C terminus of DCK2 (amino acid residues 749-767, Fig. 1A) was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used as immunogen in rabbit. The resultant antiserum was affinity-purified on a column of immunizing peptide as described previously (24Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.-H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M.

The following antibodies were obtained: mouse anti-MAP2 (Sternberger Immunocytochemicals); rat anti-α-tubulin (gift of Dr. Bob Hard); mouse anti-α-tubulin (Cedar Lane Laboratories); mouse M2 anti-FLAG (Sigma); goat anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) (Amersham Biosciences); horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse, -rabbit, or -goat IgG, Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories); rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Roche Applied Science); and Texas Red-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Molecular Probes). Bacterial Expression and Purification of DCK2—GST-DCK2 was expressed in E. coli by induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 21 h at 15 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme in PBS containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mg/liter leupeptin, 20 mg/liter aprotinin, 2 mm EDTA), 0.5 mm DTT, and 1% Triton X-100 and lysed with a French pressure cell. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation, chromatographed batchwise on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The eluate was concentrated and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol (dialysis buffer). It was then chromatographed on MT-Sepharose (prepared as described below) in 0.5× dialysis buffer without EGTA. The column was washed with this buffer until A280 was at base line and eluted with dialysis buffer containing 600 mm NaCl. Low (50 mm) NaCl wash fractions and high (600 mm) NaCl-eluted fractions were separately pooled based on DCK2 immunoreactivity, and the latter was dialyzed against dialysis buffer without EGTA. Mammalian Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7L African Green Monkey Kidney cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids. Cells were grown in culture dishes for biochemical assays or on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (500 μg/ml) for immunocytochemistry. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cellular lysates were prepared as described (19Shang L. Kwon Y.-G. Nandy S. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2185-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and protein phosphatase inhibitors (5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm orthovanadate, and 100 μm okadaic acid). Primary cultures of sympathetic neurons were established as described previously (25Higgins D. Lein P. Osterhout D. Johnson M.I. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991: 177-205Google Scholar). Briefly, superior cervical ganglia were isolated from E20-21 rats and treated with 2.5 mg/ml trypsin and 1 mg/ml collagenase for 40 min at 37 °C. The tissue was dissociated by trituration, and the neurons were plated onto coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (100 μg/ml). Cells were maintained in serum-free medium containing β-nerve growth factor (100 ng/ml). Non-neuronal cells were eliminated by the addition of 1 μm cytosine-β-d-arabinofuranoside for 48 h. Sympathetic neurons were co-transfected on the 5th or 6th day with pEGFP-N2 and pCDNA3.1-DCK2 using Lipofectamine 2000. After incubation for 6 h, cells were washed and allowed to recover for 24 h, following which they were grown in the absence or presence of 50 ng/ml bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-7 (Curis) as indicated. Microtubule Methods—For co-assembly assays and for construction of MT-Sepharose affinity resin, MTs were purified by taxol-aided polymerization (26Vallee R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, rat brain was homogenized in PEM buffer (0.1 m PIPES, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.6) and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 2 °C. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 90 min at 3 °C. The supernatant (S1) was recovered; GTP was added to a concentration of 1 mm, and it was incubated in this buffer (GPEM) for 30 min at 37 °C with the addition of taxol (from NCI, National Institutes of Health) (20 μm) to promote polymerization. It was then underlaid with a cushion of prewarmed 10% sucrose in GPEM/taxol and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 30 °C. The supernatant (S2) was retained, and the pellet was rinsed in GPEM/taxol, resuspended in this buffer, and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 30 °C. The supernatant (S3) was retained, and the pellet (MT) was rinsed and then resuspended in GPEM. Purified, taxol-stabilized MTs were covalently conjugated to activated CH-Sepharose 4B as per manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). For assay of MT binding of COS cell-expressed DCK2, MTs were polymerized in vitro by incubation of 1 mg/ml tubulin (purified by phosphocellulose (PC) chromatography to remove endogenous MAPs) (Cytoskeleton) with either 30 μm taxol or vehicle (0.6% Me2SO) in GPEM for 30 min at 30 °C. The MTs were mixed with lysates (3 μg) from COS-7L cells expressing FLAG-DCK2 (WT or mutants) or a vector alone control in GPEM containing 150 mm NaCl and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The incubation mixtures were then centrifuged at 38,000 × g for 30 min at 30 °C. The supernatants and MT pellets (resuspended in GPEM to the same volume) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To test whether phosphorylation promotes DCK2 dissociation from MTs, the procedure was modified to promote more complete MT polymerization by increasing the tubulin, taxol, pH values, and temperature to 2 mg/ml, 50 μm, 6.9 and 32 °C, respectively. The MTs were centrifuged as above at 32 °C, and in the binding reaction, the NaCl concentration was reduced to 100 mm. Phosphorylation Analysis and Peptide Kinase Assay—DCK2 autophosphorylation or high molecular weight microtubule-associated protein (HMW-MAP) phosphorylation reactions were at 30 °C for the periods of time and with ATP as indicated. Phosphorylation reaction buffer was 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and 1-2 mm EGTA. DCK2 dephosphorylation reactions were by incubation for 45 min at 30 °C with 50 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (AP) (New England Biolabs) in a buffer consisting of 40 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 80 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.7 mm DTT, and 8% glycerol. Dephosphorylation reactions were terminated with either SDS sample buffer for blotting applications or 10 mm NaPPi for MT-binding experiments. Peptide kinase activity of FLAG-DCK2 (WT and mutants) was assayed after immunoprecipitation from lysates of transfected COS-7L cells by an immune complex assay as described previously, using the synthetic peptide LRRRLSLANF as substrate (19Shang L. Kwon Y.-G. Nandy S. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2185-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry and Immunoblotting—DCK2-transfected COS-7L cells grown on coverslips were rinsed in 0.1 m PIPES, pH 6.9, and fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C (localization experiments) or 4 °C (MT-stabilization experiments). All subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. Coverslips were rinsed three times with PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS three times for 5 min each time. The coverslips were washed three times for 5 min each time in PBS and treated three times for 10 min each time with 2.5 mg/ml sodium borohydride in 50% ethanol to reduce autofluorescence, and the borohydride was removed by washing three times for 5 min each time in PBS. Alternatively (as in Fig. 3B), the fixation/permeabilization procedure was modified as described by Rieder and Hard (27Rieder C.L. Hard R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 122: 153-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 10% BSA in PBS for 3 h, followed by incubation with primary antibody in 3% BSA in PBS overnight. Cells were washed three times for 10 min each time with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS and incubated in secondary antibody in 3% BSA in PBS for 30 min. Coverslips were rinsed successively with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS and water and mounted using Slow Fade reagent (Molecular Probes). For immunocytochemistry of primary sympathetic neurons, coverslip-attached cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15-20 min at room temperature, washed three times for 5 min each time with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min. After washing three times for 5 min each time with PBS, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 2 h to overnight at 4 °C. Primary, and then secondary, antibody incubations were performed in this buffer overnight at 4 °C following which coverslips were rinsed in PBS and water and mounted in elvanol. In multiple labeling experiments, primary and secondary antibody incubations were performed sequentially. Images were digitally acquired using a Bio-Rad MRC1024 laser scanning confocal head mounted on a Nikon Optiphot microscope equipped with objectives of 60×/1.4NA (Figs. 3 and 4), 40×/1.3NA (Fig. 8A), or 20×/0.75NA (Fig. 8, B and C) and collected on separate fluorescence channels. Images were processed using Confocal Assistant (Bio-Rad) and Photoshop (Adobe). Immunoblotting using anti-DCK2 or anti-α-tubulin primary antibodies and HRP-linked secondary antibodies with ECL detection was performed as described previously (19Shang L. Kwon Y.-G. Nandy S. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2185-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Fig. 8DCK2 localization in sympathetic neurons. Sympathetic neurons grown on coverslips were co-transfected with DCK2 and EGFP in either the absence (A) or presence (B and C) of BMP-7 to induce the formation of dendrites (51Lein P. Johnson M. Guo X. Rueger D. Higgins D. Neuron. 1995; 15: 597-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Antibodies used for immunostaining were anti-DCK2/anti-rabbit IgG-rhodamine (A-C), anti-α-tubulin/anti-mouse IgG-Cy5 (A), and anti-MAP2/anti-mouse IgG-Cy5 (C).

PCR products were purified by Wizard PCR Preps (Promega), and the respective sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The GAPDH probe was obtained from Seegene. Probes were 32P-labeled using random oligonucleotide priming and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Northern blots with immobilized total RNA from staged mouse embryos and poly(A)+ RNA from selected mouse tissues were obtained from Seegene and Ambion, respectively. For the former, only lanes containing RNA from embryonic tissue without contribution from extra-embryonic RNA were analyzed. Blots were prehybridized in Ultrahyb (Ambion), to which 50 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA was added, for 60 min at 42 °C. 32P-Labeled probe was briefly denatured, added to a concentration of ≥1.0 × 106 cpm/ml, and hybridized overnight at 42 °C. Washing to reduce nonspecific background was optimized for each blot/probe combination. Typically, it was two times for 15 min each time in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C, two times for 15 min each time in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C, and one time for 15 min in the latter solution at 60 °C. Specifically bound probe was detected by autoradiography. Blots were stripped for reprobing by boiling in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Cloning and Sequence Analysis of DCK2—A BLAST search of GenBank™ identified an EST (accession number W30246) with 70% amino acid similarity to rat DCK1 suggesting that it might encode a novel DCK. The distribution of residues between this putative DCK family member and DCK1 was consistent with encoding of their respective cDNAs by distinct genes. The cloning strategy entailed cDNA library screening with a probe based on the W30246 EST sequence followed by 5′-RACE and RT-PCR. RT-PCR of adult rat brain RNA and the sequencing of independent clones was used to confirm the complete protein coding sequence and to obtain a cDNA clone for expression in functional studies. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence is given in Fig. 1A. The sequence is annotated with the positions of individual exons obtained by alignment of the cDNA sequence against rat genomic DNA using the BLAT (UCSC) and BLAST (NCBI) algorithms. The cDNA sequence is composed of 18 predicted exons spanning 129.8 kb of genomic DNA. As it is likely the sequence does not represent the entire transcription unit, the size of the gene and numbering of exons will presumably require subsequent readjustment. The rat gene maps to cytogenetic locus 2q34. Its human orthologue maps to 4q31.23 and therefore represents a novel gene, distinct from that of DCK1 at 13q13 (13Omori Y. Suzuki M. Ozaki K. Harada Y.

A three-residue tract ((G/S)XS) present within all three subunits has been identified as a key structure forming a putative selectivity filter.

The blocking effect of external Cd2+ was examined by comparing amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents measured by two-electrode voltage clamp in the absence and presence of Cd2+ in the bath solution. The currents in mutant channels containing a single Cys substitution at the first or third position within the (G/S)XS tract (αG587C, αS589C, βG529C, βS531C, γS546C, and γS548C) were blocked by Cd2+ with varying inhibitory constants (0.06-13 mm), whereas the currents in control channels were largely insensitive to Cd2+ at concentrations up to 10 mm. The Cd2+ blocking effects were fast, with time constants in the range of seconds, and were only partially reversible. The blocked currents were restored by 10 mm dithiothreitol. Mutant channels containing alanine or serine substitutions at these sites within the α subunit were only poorly and reversibly blocked by 10 mm Cd2+. These results indicate that the introduced sulfhydryl groups face the conduction pore and suggest that serine hydroxyl groups within the selectivity filter in wild-type ENaCs face the conduction pore and may contribute to cation selectivity by participating in coordination of permeating cations.

Epithelial Na+ channels (ENaCs) 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; mENaC, mouse ENaC; DTT, dithiothreitol.1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; mENaC, mouse ENaC; DTT, dithiothreitol. mediate Na+ transport across apical membranes of high resistance epithelia and participate in body fluid homeostasis, control of blood pressure, and airway fluid balance (1Rossier B.C. Pradervand S. Schild L. Hummler E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 877-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Four subunits have been cloned from mammalian tissues and are termed αENaC, βENaC, γENaC, and δENaC. Na+-transporting epithelial cells typically express α, β, and γ subunits. ENaC subunits belong to the ENaC/DEG superfamily with degenerins (DEG and MEC) from Caenorhabditis elegans mechanosensory neurons, acid-sensing ion channels, and peptide-gated Na+ channels (2Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 631-644Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). ENaC/DEG members have limited sequence homology and share a membrane topology similar to that of other two-transmembrane domain channels such as inward rectifier K+ channels and P2X receptors (3Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar).

A three-residue tract ((G/S)XS) within a region (pre-M2 or pore region) preceding the second transmembrane domain (referred to as M2) of α, β, and γ subunits is considered to be the key element forming a putative selectivity filter based on complete or partial loss of selectivity among Na+, Li+, and K+ in mutant channels containing point mutations at the first or third position within this tract (11Kellenberger S.

The contributions of the three subunits to ion selectivity are not equal, suggesting that the selectivity filter has an asymmetric structure that is distinct from the nearly perfect symmetry of K+ channel selectivity filters (15Li J.

In addition to the three-residue tract, mutations of nearby residues or of selected residues in M2 or post-M2 regions also alter cation selectivity (13Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D.

Based on results from previous studies, the general consensus is that the ENaC pore is formed by the pre-M2 and M2 domains of all three subunits; however, the orientation of these two segments (pre-M2 and M2) within the three-dimensional ENaC structure is unknown, and different models have been proposed (11Kellenberger S.

Crystal structures of bacterial K+ channels have provided insight regarding mechanisms by which K+ channels achieve a K+-selective phenotype (19Doyle D.A. Morais-Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5631) Google Scholar, 20Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar). Four K+-binding sites within the 12-Å-long selectivity filter are formed by 16 carbonyl oxygen atoms from the signature sequence TVGY and four hydroxyl oxygen atoms from the threonine residues (20Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ion-binding sites within the selectivity filter of voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels are thought to come from side chains of key residues (DEKA for the Na+ channels and EEEE for the Ca2+ channels) (21Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001: 561-564Google Scholar). It is not clear whether backbone oxygens, side chain oxygens, or both coordinate permeating Na+ and Li+ ions in ENaCs. Kellenberger et al. (22Kellenberger S. Auberson M. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Schild L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) recently proposed that the four carbonyl oxygen atoms from four serine residues at the third position within the (G/S)XS tracts (two from αENaC and one from βENaC and γENaC each) provide a Na+-binding site and that the side chains point to the intersubunit spaces and do not interact with cations passing through the selectivity filter. The proposed side chain orientation of the Ser residues at the third position was largely based on a positive correlation between increases in K+ permeability and the volumes of several substituted residues at αSer589. Our previous study suggested that the hydroxyl group of αSer589 might contribute to Na+ binding and cation selectivity since only a Thr substitution at αSer589 retained the ability to discriminate between Na+ and K+ (13Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As the Van der Waals volume of the Thr residue (93 Å3) is 27% greater than that of the Ser residue (73 Å3) (23Creighton T. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1993: 4Google Scholar), our results did not support the model proposed by Kellenberger et al. (22Kellenberger S. Auberson M. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Schild L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and raised the possibility that the hydroxyl side chain at position 589 of the α subunit might interact with ions traversing the selectivity filter. To probe the side chain orientation of filter-lining residues, we examined the accessibility of engineered sulfhydryl groups at the first and third positions in mouse αENaC, βENaC, and γENaC to external Cd2+. Our results indicate that sulfhydryl groups from Cys residues introduced at the first and third positions of the selectivity filter tract ((G/S)XS) interact with external Cd2+ and suggest that the side chains of Ser residues within the selectivity filter, including αSer589, may point to the pore lumen and interact with cations within the filter. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on cDNAs for mouse αENaC, βENaC, and γENaC cloned into pBluescript SK- (Stratagene) as reported previously (13Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Target mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing. The first and third residues within the three-residue tract ((G/S)XS) of αENaC, βENaC, and γENaC were individually substituted with Cys. To enhance functional expression in oocytes, we generated β and γ subunits with an introduced Liddle's mutation (βR564X or γR583X, denoted βT or γT, respectively) that truncates their intracellular C termini. Channel Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—The cRNAs for wild-type and mutant ENaC subunits were synthesized with T3 RNA polymerase (Ambion Inc.). Oocytes harvested from Xenopus laevis were treated with collagenase to remove follicle layers. Stage V and VI oocytes were injected with cRNAs for wild-type or mutant mouse αENaC, βENaC, and γENaC at 1-4 ng/subunit/oocyte. Injected oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate, pH 7.4). Two-electrode Voltage Clamp—All experiments were performed 20-96 h after cRNA injections at room temperature (20-24 °C). Oocytes were placed in an oocyte recording chamber from Warner Instrument Corp. (Hamden, CT) and perfused with a bath solution containing 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Whole cell Na+ currents were measured by two-electrode voltage clamp as described previously (13Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To obtain a current-voltage relationship, oocytes were clamped from -140 to 60 mV in 20-mV increments for 0.5 s. For time course experiments, oocytes were continuously clamped at -100 mV. Amiloride-sensitive currents are defined as the difference between total currents and the currents with 100 μm amiloride in the bath solution. Cd2+Accessibility—The effects of Cd2+ on mutant ENaCs were examined by comparing currents before and after external application of CdCl2. Increasing concentrations of CdCl2 (from 10-7 to 10-2m) were used to determine dose-response relationships. As some mutations within the selectivity filter tract decrease amiloride sensitivity (15Li J. Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), whole cell currents (rather than amiloride-sensitive currents) were used to obtain dose-response curves. Amiloride at 100 μm was typically added to the bath solution at the end of an experiment to measure the amiloride-insensitive current. Recordings from oocytes that had high amiloride-insensitive currents (>0.5 μA at -100 mV) were not included in analysis to minimize current contamination from endogenous channels, with the exception of recordings from oocytes expressing αβG525Cγ and αβγG542C, as these mutants show little block by 100 μm amiloride due to an ∼1000-fold increase in the amiloride Ki (24Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Inhibitory constants for Cd2+ were estimated from the best fit of dose-response data by nonlinear least-square curve fitting with the Hill equation: I=Kin/(Kin+Cn), where I is the relative current obtained by normalizing the current in the presence of Cd2+ to the value in the absence of Cd2+, Ki is the inhibitory constant, n is the Hill coefficient, and the C refers to [Cd2+]. Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Nonlinear least-square curve fittings were performed with OriginPro 7 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). We previously observed low levels of functional ENaC expression in Xenopus oocytes expressing αβγmENaCs with a Cys substitution at the first or third residue within the (G/S)XS tract of the putative selectivity filter, with whole cell Na+ currents at -100 mV typically below 500 nA (13Sheng S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 13867-13874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the enhanced surface expression of channels with Liddle's mutations, we investigated accessibility of external Cd2+ to engineered sulfhydryl groups within the (G/S)XS tract. A sequence alignment of residues near the (G/S)XS tracts in the ENaC/DEG family is shown in Fig. 1A. Our rationale was that Cys-substituted channels would be blocked by external Cd2+ if introduced sulfhydryl groups point to the filter lumen as illustrated in Fig. 1B. Conversely, channels would not be blocked by Cd2+ if the introduced sulfhydryl groups face away from the pore lumen as shown in Fig. 1C. External Cd2+Blocks ENaCs with a Single Cysteine Substitution within the Putative Selectivity Filter—Whole cell currents in oocytes expressing αβγmENaCs with a single Cys substitution and a Liddle's mutation were in the range of 1∼5 μA at -100 mV (Table I). Amiloride at 100 μm blocked the currents of the mutants containing a Cys substitution at the third Ser in the α, β, or γ subunit to <200 nA, a level typically observed in non-injected oocytes. However, amiloride failed to block the currents of channels containing a Cys mutation at the first position of the selectivity filter tract of the α or β subunit to the same level. This is consistent with previous reports that mutations at αGly587 and βGly529 decrease the amiloride sensitivity of the mutant channels (14Kellenberger S. Hoffmann-Pochon N. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Schild L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 13-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 15Li J. Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13867-13874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The effects of external Cd2+ on ENaC currents were examined by analyzing the current changes in the presence of increasing concentrations of CdCl (from 10-7 to 10-2m) in the bath solution. Representative recordings are shown in Fig. 2. All six mutant channels were blocked by external Cd2+ in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). The estimated inhibitory constants (Ki) and Hill coefficients are listed in Table I. In contrast, control channels containing a Liddle's mutation but with no Cys substitution were not blocked by Cd2+. These results indicate that the introduced sulfhydryl groups at the selectivity filter-lining sites in all three subunits were accessible to external Cd2+. It was apparent that mutant channels with a Cys substitution at the first position within the filter tract (αG587C, βG529C, and γS546C) showed higher sensitivity to Cd2+ than channels containing a Cys mutation at the third position (αS589C, βS531C, and γS548C) of the same subunit (p < 0.05). With Cys substitutions at the first or third position of the (G/S)XS tract, α mutants were more sensitive to Cd2+ than β and γ mutants (p < 0.05), whereas β and γ mutants showed similar Cd2+ sensitivity (p > 0.05).Table IInhibitory and time constants for Cd2+ blockmENaCNo. of oocytesINaKiHill coefficientμAmmαG587CβTγ103.5 ± 0.60.06 ± 0.011.01 ± 0.04αS589CβTγ92.8 ± 0.41.31 ± 0.061.02 ± 0.04αβG529CγT82.9 ± 0.81.38 ± 0.390.69 ± 0.07αβS531CγT96.5 ± 1.313.5 ± 1.41 ± 0aFixed at 1 in curve fittings (otherwise unable to fit).αβTγS546C910.4 ± 1.20.94 ± 0.061.68 ± 0.04αβTγS548C55.1 ± 1.38.44 ± 1.980.57 ± 0.08αS583Cβγ94.3 ± 1.40.05 ± 0.011.04 ± 0.05αβG525Cγ103.9 ± 1.40.35 ± 0.071.15 ± 0.11αβγG542C102.1 ± 0.30.28 ± 0.011.02 ± 0.06αβTγ920.4 ± 2.8NDNDαβγT826.3 ± 4.2NDNDαβγ1213.5 ± 2.1NDNDa Fixed at 1 in curve fittings (otherwise unable to fit).

Oocytes expressing mutant αβγmENaCs were clamped following the current-voltage protocol described under “Experimental Procedures.” Currents were recorded before and after application of increasing concentrations of CdCl2 to the bath solution. The currents measured at -100 mV were normalized to currents prior to Cd2+ addition (relative currents). The Cys-substituted α and γ mutants contained the Liddle's mutation βT (βR564X), whereas Cys-substituted β mutants had the Liddle's mutation γT (γR583X).

Environ. Health Perspect. 1984; 54: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To confirm that the Cd2+-induced block of the Cys mutant ENaCs was due to Cd2+ binding to the introduced sulfhydryl group, we examined the reversibility of the block. As shown in Fig. 4 (A-F), currents only partially recovered following Cd2+ washout from the bath solution. We also tested the reversibility of the Cd2+ block with a single voltage (-100 mV) clamp protocol (Fig. 4, G and H). Consistent with the above results, Na+ currents in oocytes expressing αG587CβTγ or αS589CβγT were only partially restored following washout of Cd2+ from the bath solution. The addition of the reducing reagent DTT (10 mm) restored currents to near control levels. Currents restored by DTT were blocked by 0.1 mm amiloride, eliminating the possibility that DTT-induced currents were mediated by endogenous channels. Moreover, application and washout of 10 mm DTT did not produce noticeable effects on currents in oocytes expressing the same mutant channels without prior application of Cd2+. These results suggest that the observed Cd2+ block of the mutant ENaCs containing Cys substitutions within the putative selectivity filter was due to Cd2+ interaction with thiol groups rather than with oxygens. Effects of External Cd2+on Non-Cys Mutants—To eliminate the possibility that the Cd2+ block of the Cys mutants was due to Cd2+ binding to endogenous Cys in the ENaC pore, we examined the effects of Cd2+ on channels containing an Ala substitution at αGly587 or αSer589 or a Ser substitution at αGly587. External application of Cd2+ at concentrations up to 1 mm did not block the currents in oocytes expressing αG587A, αG587S, or αS589A (Fig. 5), where either the β or γ subunit had a Liddle's mutation. 10 mm Cd2+ blocked <40% of the currents in these mutants, and the block was completely reversed by Cd2+ washout from the bath solution, in contrast to the poor reversibility of the Cd2+ inhibition of αG587CβTγ and αS589CβTγ (Fig. 4). The partial and low affinity block by 10 mm Cd2+ likely reflects binding of divalent Cd2+ to non-thiol ligands within the selectivity filter of the mutant channels and suggests that the observed Cd2+ block of the Cys mutant channels at submillimolar concentrations resulted from Cd2+ binding to the introduced sulfhydryl groups. Cd2+ Block and the Endogenous Cys Residue—The γ subunit has a natural Cys within the (G/S)XS tract (Cys547). This residue is not conserved among ENaC/DEG family members (Fig. 1) and is not required for cation selectivity, as point mutations of this Cys do not alter Li+/Na+ or K+/Na+ selectivity (12Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Bucher D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28484-28490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To investigate whether γCys547 was involved in the Cd2+ block of the Cys-substituted mutant channels, we expressed channels with Cys introduced into the (G/S)XS tract in the setting of γC547S. Unfortunately, the additional mutation (i.e. γC547S) in the presence of a Liddle's mutation decreased functional channel expression to levels that were too low to allow us to perform a typical Cd2+ dose-response experiment. As an alternative, we examined the blocking effects of 0.1 and 1 mm Cd2+ on αG587CβTγC547S and αS589CβTγC547S. We observed that 0.1 mm Cd2+ blocked about half of the current in oocytes expressing αG587CβTγC547S and that 1 mm Cd2+ blocked approximately half of the current in oocytes expressing αS589CβTγC547S. These results indicate that the γC547S mutation did not affect the Cd2+ block of the Cys mutants, suggesting that the observed Cd2+ block was due to its interaction with the engineered sulfhydryl groups. Rates of Cd2+Block—Rates of Cd2+ block are often used to compare the relative Cd2+ accessibility to engineered Cys residues. We measured the rate of 1 or 10 mm Cd2+ block of Na+ currents in oocytes expressing channels with a single Cys mutant in the (G/S)XS tract using a voltage clamp protocol as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 6 shows representative recordings from these experiments. Time constants (τ) for Cd2+-dependent inhibition of mutant channels and the calculated rates of Cd2+ block are listed in Table II. In agreement with the relative affinities of the Cd2+ block, Cd2+ inhibitory rates for mutant channels with a Cys substitution at the first position of the (G/S)XS tract were greater than those observed for channels with a Cys substitution at the third position (αG587C versus αS589C, p < 0.001; βG529C versus βS531C, p < 0.01; and γS546C versus γS548C, p < 0.001). Interestingly, the rate of Cd2+ block of the αG587C mutant was similar to that of βG529C channels (p > 0.05) and greater than that of the γS546C mutant (p < 0.001), despite the order of Cd2+ affinity (αG587C > βG529C ≈ γS546C). For the mutants with Cys introduced at the third position of the (G/S)XS tract, the rate of Cd2+ block of αS589C was greater than those of βS531C and γS548C (p < 0.001) and is in agreement with the order of Cd2+ affinity (αS589C > βS531C ≈ γS548C). The Cd2+ block rate of γS548C was moderately higher than that of βS531C (p < 0.01).Table IIRates of Cd2+ blockmENaCNo. of oocytes[Cd2+]τRatemmsm−1s−1αG587CβγT1410.79 ± 0.051340 ± 80αS589CβγT1212.60 ± 0.23414 ± 32αβG529CγT811.12 ± 0.311350 ± 270αβS531CγT10103.17 ± 0.2633 ± 2αβTγS546C613.23 ± 0.30326 ± 37αβTCγS548C15102.33 ± 0.1345 ± 3αS583Cβγ1410.36 ± 0.033100 ± 270αβG525Cγ1710.45 ± 0.032490 ± 220αβγG542C1910.54 ± 0.042020 ± 150 Open table in a new tab External Cd2+Block of Channels Containing Cys Mutations at the Putative Amiloride-binding Sites—αSer583, βGly525, and γGly542 have been proposed to form an amiloride-binding site (24Schild L.

These residues likely line the ENaC conduction pore, as mutations at these sites significantly alter both amiloride sensitivity and single channel conductance, and Cys introductions render the channel sensitive to sulfhydryl-reactive Zn2+ and methanethiosulfonate reagents (5Kosari F.

https://openalex.org/W2022066102,"A variety of cellular proteins has the ability to recognize DNA lesions induced by the anti-cancer drug cisplatin, with diverse consequences on their repair and on the therapeutic effectiveness of this drug. We report a novel gene involved in the cell response to cisplatin in vertebrates. The RDM1 gene (for RAD52 Motif 1) was identified while searching databases for sequences showing similarities to RAD52, a protein involved in homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Ablation of RDM1 in the chicken B cell line DT40 led to a more than 3-fold increase in sensitivity to cisplatin.

The cytotoxic activity of cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II)) is thought to be due to its interaction with purine bases of our chromosomes and the various DNA adducts that ensue, including monoadducts and interstrand cross-links (ICLs), 1The abbreviations used are: ICL, interstrand cross-links; NER, nucleotide excision repair; CS, Cockayne syndrome; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; DSB, double-stranded break; GGR, global genome repair; HMG, high mobility group; HR, homologous recombination; MMR, mismatch repair; MMS, methylmethane sulfonate; ORF, open reading frame; RRM, RNA recognition motif; SSA, single-strand annealing; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; TCR, transcription-coupled repair; XP, xeroderma pigmentosum; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; aa, amino acid. as well as the predominant (1,3- and 1,2-) intrastrand cross-links (1Wozniak K.

Sci. 1995; 20: 435-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Cisplatin-DNA adducts perturb replication and transcription and trigger sophisticated repair machineries. Cisplatin-DNA adducts are removed primarily by nucleotide excision repair (NER), which also operates in the repair of UV-induced lesions, DNA cross-links of various origins, and bulky DNA adducts (3Friedberg E.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 22-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 4Wood R.D. Araujo S.J. Ariza R.R. Batty D.P. Biggerstaff M. Evans E. Gaillard P.H. Gunz D. Koberle B. Kuraoka I. Moggs J.G. Sandall J.K. Shivji M.K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). NER has been elucidated thanks in part to the use of cell lines derived from patients with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne syndrome (CS), in which NER was found to be deficient (5Bootsma D. Kraemer K.H. Cleaver J.E. Hoeijmakers J.H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. The Genetic Basis of Human Cancer. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1998: 245-274Google Scholar). NER has been subdivided in two subpathways that operate either on the transcribed strand of transcriptionally active genes (transcription-coupled repair (TCR)) or on the nontranscribed strand of active genes and in transcriptionally silent regions of the genome (global genome repair (GGR)) (6Hanawalt P.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8949-8956Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The main difference between these pathways resides in the mechanisms by which they achieve specific recognition of a DNA lesion. In GGR, damage recognition involves the XPC-hHR23B complex, XPA, and RPA (7Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 8Thoma B.S. Vasquez K.M. Mol. Carcinog. 2003; 38: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), as well as the UV-damaged DNA binding complex (DDB) (9Fitch M.E. Nakajima S. Yasui A. Ford J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46906-46910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In TCR, DNA damage is sensed by the RNA polymerase II, and repair is engaged by the transcription-coupled repair-specific factors CSA and CSB. Recognition of the lesion is followed by the sequential recruitment of proteins that mediate stages of repair common to GGR and TCR as follows: formation of an open, “pre-incision” complex, excision of a DNA fragment containing the lesion, and repair DNA synthesis (10de Laat W.L. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 768-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Although NER is the main pathway for the removal of intrastrand DNA cross-links, the molecular mechanisms that ensure repair of ICLs are still unclear. Current models suggest that such repair is initiated by DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) that are generated by the collapse of replication forks at the sites of lesion. These breaks are then acted upon by components of the NER and homologous recombination (HR) pathways, leading to the removal of the lesion (11Dronkert M.L. Kanaar R. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence of DNA replication-mediated DSBs at sites of cross-links has been reported recently (12Bessho T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5250-5254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Removal of cisplatin-DNA cross-links contributes to resistance of tumors to the drug, a phenomenon frequently manifested during chemotherapy (2Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 435-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Thus, increased expression of NER components and/or higher levels of cross-link excision activities have been detected in cancers that fail to respond to the drug (Ref. 13Selvakumaran M. Pisarcik D.A. Bao R. Yeung A.T. Hamilton T.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1311-1316PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). The efficiency of cisplatin-DNA lesion removal by NER has been shown to vary among different intrastrand cross-links, and biochemical studies have demonstrated that the major determinant in the efficiency of recognition and repair was the extent of structural distortion of the DNA caused by a given cross-link (14Moggs J.G. Szymkowski D.E. Yamada M. Karran P. Wood R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 480-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that poor substrates for removal by NER, such as 1,2-intrastrand cross-links, tend to undergo replicative bypass, leading to the possible insertion of mispaired bases opposite the cross-links and the intervention of the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. Consistent with this view, in vitro studies have shown that certain types of mismatched cisplatin-DNA adducts can be specifically recognized by the mismatch recognition complex hMutSα (15Mu D. Tursun M. Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 16Yamada M. O'Regan E. Brown R. Karran P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These observations may provide an explanation why MMR activity is compromised in certain cell lines selected for their resistance to cisplatin. It should be noted, however, that abrogation of MMR does not seem to occur frequently as a mechanism by which human cells acquire resistance to cisplatin (17Massey A. Offman J. Macpherson P. Karran P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 73-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition to the specific factors mentioned above, several other proteins, such as members of the high mobility group of proteins involved in chromatin compaction and gene expression, are capable of recognizing distortions of the double helix caused by cisplatin-DNA adducts (1Wozniak K. Blasiak J. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2002; 49: 583-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 2Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 435-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In binding to such lesions, these proteins have the potential to mask the damaged DNA and prevent its repair or to recruit repair machineries, thereby facilitating the removal of the lesions. Hijacking effects, whereby binding of a factor to a cisplatin-DNA lesion is detrimental to other processes normally mediated by this factor, have also been suggested to concur to the cytotoxicity of cisplatin (18Zhai X. Beckmann H. Jantzen H.M. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16307-16315Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The recognition of cisplatin-DNA lesions therefore appears to contribute greatly to the mechanisms by which cells express resistance to this drug. Here we report a novel gene involved in the cell response to cisplatin in vertebrates. The RDM1 gene (for RAD52 Motif 1) was identified while searching databases for sequences showing similarities to the DNA recombination and repair gene RAD52 (Ref. 19van den Bosch M. Lohman P.H. Pastink A. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 873-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar and Ref. 20West S.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar and references therein), by virtue of a small region of aa similarity, hereafter called the RD motif, that the RDM1 protein shares with a functionally important N-terminal region of RAD52. RDM1–/– cells, generated by ablation of RDM1 in the chicken B cell line DT40, exhibited increased sensitivity to cisplatin. However, these cells were not hypersensitive to DNA damages caused by ionizing radiation, UV irradiation, or the alkylating agent methylmethane sulfonate (MMS). The RDM1 protein displays a nucleic-acid binding domain of the RNA recognition motif (RRM) type. By using gel-shift assays and electron microscopy, we show that purified, recombinant chicken RDM1 protein interacts with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as well as double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), on which it assembles filament-like structures. Most importantly, RDM1 was found to recognize distortions of the double helix induced by cisplatin-DNA adducts. Finally, high expression of human RDM1 transcripts was detected in the testis, suggesting that RDM1 might play a role during spermatogenesis. DNA and Protein Sequence Analyses—Sequence similarity searches were carried out using the BLAST family of programs (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar). The RRM motif of RDM1 was identified by using HHMER (22Eddy S.R. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (4067) Google Scholar) to query the PFAM library of Hidden Markov models of protein families (23Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R.

The crystal structure of human RAD52 was examined using Swiss PDB Viewer (24Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9590) Google Scholar). All programs were used with default parameters. Sequence data have been submitted to the DDBJ/GenBank™/EBI Data Bank under accession numbers AB080727 (chicken RDM1) and AB080728 (human RDM1). Cloning of the Chicken RDM1 Gene and Its Targeted Disruption in the Chicken B Cell Line DT40 —The chicken RDM1 cDNA as well as its 5′ and 3′ regions were cloned using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). The genomic DNA fragments used to construct the RDM1 knock-out vectors were amplified using long range PCR, from DNA extracted from chicken DT40 cells. Gene disruption vectors (pRdm1Puro and pRdm1Bsr) were constructed as described previously (25Arakawa H. Hauschild J. Buerstedde J.M.

DT40 Colony Survival Assay—The survival of DT40 cells in cisplatin- and MMS-containing medium was measured by plating serially diluted cells in chicken medium (25Arakawa H. Hauschild J. Buerstedde J.M. Science. 2002; 295: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) containing 1% methylcellulose. Sensitivity to γ-radiation was measured by exposing plated cells to a 137Cs γ-ray source. UV irradiation (254 nm) was performed on cells suspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Survival is expressed as a percentage, using untreated cells as the 100% value. DNA Substrates and Proteins—Single- and double-stranded circular ϕX174 DNA was purchased from New England Biolabs. Linear ϕX174 DNA with a unique 3′-tail (603 nucleotides in length) was constructed by PstI digestion of gapped circular ϕX174 DNA containing a 603-bp region of ssDNA, which was produced as follows: the 4783-bp PstI-ApaLI restriction fragment of ϕX174 DNA was isolated by centrifugation on a neutral 5–20% sucrose gradient as described previously (27Muller B. West S.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 30: 413-423PubMed Google Scholar). This fragment was heat-denatured, and the complementary strand was annealed to circular (+) ssDNA of ϕX174, followed by purification of the gapped DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis and electroelution. The gapped DNA was precipitated, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mm EDTA (TE), and dialyzed against TE for 24 h at 4 °C. The 52-mer oligonucleotide EV044 used in this study is complementary to nucleotides 130–181 of the single-stranded (+) form of ϕX174 DNA. Gel-purified oligonucleotides were purchased from Proligo. DNA substrates were 5′-32P-end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Single-stranded ϕX174 DNA was 32P-labeled as described (28Van Dyck E. Hajibagheri N.M. Stasiak A. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All DNA concentrations are expressed in moles of nucleotides. Cisplatination of XhoI-cut ϕX174 dsDNA was carried out in a 100-μl reaction containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm NaCl, with 5 μg of DNA and appropriate cisplatin:DNA molar ratios by incubating at 37 °C for 16 h in the dark. Unreacted cisplatin was removed by dialysis against TE at 4 °C. Expression and Purification of Recombinant RDM1—Plasmid pEVD008 was constructed by subcloning the chicken RDM1 gene into the Escherichia coli expression vector pET15b (Novagen). Recombinant chicken RDM1 protein was purified from 3.2 liters of E. coli BL21(DE3)trxB– (29Proba K. Ge L. Pluckthun A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 159: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (a kind gift from A. Pluckthum and P. Lindner) carrying plasmid pEVD008. Cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria broth containing 60 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin to an A600 of 0.5 and induced by the addition of 1 mm IPTG, followed by a further 2-h incubation at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 40 ml of T buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% (v/v) Triton X-100) containing 5 mm imidazole, frozen rapidly in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Bacteria were thawed and lysed by sonication in the presence of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), and leupeptin (2 μg/ml). Cell debris and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 45 min in a Beckman 50.2 Ti rotor. The supernatant was passed through a 0.45-μm filter and loaded onto a 40-ml Talon (Clontech) column equilibrated with T buffer containing 5 mm imidazole. The column was washed successively with 240 and 120 ml of T buffer containing 5 and 25 mm imidazole, respectively, and RDM1 was eluted with a 400-ml linear gradient of 0.025–1 m imidazole in the same buffer. To prevent possible contaminations from E. coli exonuclease I (30Prasher D.C. Conarro L. Kushner S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6340-6343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), fractions containing RDM1 (identified by SDS-PAGE) were pooled, dialyzed against R buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) containing 50 mm KCl, and loaded onto a 14-ml heparin-Sepharose 6 (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 400 ml of R buffer containing 50 mm KCl before a 400-ml linear gradient of 0.05–1 m KCl in R buffer was applied. Fractions containing RDM1 were dialyzed against R buffer containing 100 mm KCl (R100) and loaded onto a 20-ml Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 100 ml of the same buffer, and the protein was eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient of 0.1–1 m KCl in R buffer. RDM1 was dialyzed against R100 and loaded onto a 1-ml MonoQ (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with R100, and a linear gradient of 0.1–1 m KCl in R buffer was applied. The RDM1 protein, which eluted at ∼350 mm KCl, was dialyzed against R100 and stored at –70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit and bovine serum albumin as standard. The final yield of RDM1 was about 3 mg. Protein dilutions were made in R100 buffer. DNA Binding Assays—Reactions (20 μl) contained the 32P-labeled DNA substrates in a standard binding buffer (20 mm MES, pH 6.4, or 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol). After 5 min at 37 °C, 1 μl of RDM1 protein (or R100 buffer) was added, and incubation was continued for a further 10 min. Complexes were fixed by addition of glutaraldehyde (final concentration of 0.2% (v/v)) followed by 15 min of incubation at 37 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through 0.8% agarose gels run in TAE buffer (or, in the case of oligonucleotide substrates, 10% polyacrylamide gels in TBE buffer), dried onto filter paper, and visualized by autoradiography. In preliminary experiments, no protein-DNA complexes were detected when unfixed reactions with the 52-mer oligonucleotide were analyzed by gel-shift assays, as these were found to dissociate even under conditions of low ionic strength electrophoresis (data not shown). Therefore, glutaraldehyde was added to all the binding reactions analyzed in this study. It should be noted, however, that unfixed complexes assembled on larger substrates (ss and ds ϕX174 DNA) were more stable and resulted in binding patterns identical to those observed with fixed complexes (data not shown). Electron Microscopy—Binding reactions were fixed by addition of glutaraldehyde to 0.2%, followed by 15 min of incubation at 37 °C. Samples were then diluted and washed in 5 mm Mg(OAc)2 before uranyl acetate staining as described previously (31Sogo J. Stasiak A. DeBernardin W. Losa R. Koller T. Sommerville J. Scheer U. Electron Microscopy in Molecular Biology. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 61-79Google Scholar). Complexes were observed using a Philips CM100 electron microscope. Northern Blot Analysis—A multiple tissue Northern blot with each lane containing ∼2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from specific tissues was purchased from Clontech. The membrane was hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe corresponding to the human RDM1 open reading frame according to the manufacturer's instructions. A human β-actin cDNA probe (Clontech) was used as a loading control. Identification and Cloning of the Chicken and Human RDM1 Genes—A database of chicken bursal ESTs has been established as a resource for the analysis of vertebrate gene function (32Abdrakhmanov I. Lodygin D. Geroth P. Arakawa H. Law A. Plachy J. Korn B. Buerstedde J.M. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 2062-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). While searching this database for candidate genes involved in DNA repair and/or recombination, we identified an EST whose deduced aa sequence displayed partial similarity to an N-terminal region of the RAD52 protein (see below). Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to isolate the full-length cDNA of this gene, revealing a single open reading frame (ORF) of 277 aa (Fig. 1A). Further analysis indicated that the sequence similarity between this protein and RAD52 was restricted to a short stretch of aa, hereafter called the RD motif (see below). Because this motif was located in an important region of RAD52, and to reflect its presence in the newly identified gene, we named this gene RDM1 (for RAD52 Motif 1). Exons of the human RDM1 gene were first identified in genomic DNA databases using TBlastN and the chicken gene as query. The complete human RDM1 gene, encoding a 284-aa polypeptide, was subsequently isolated by PCR, both from a testis and a brain cDNA library. Identical ORFs were amplified in both cases (data not shown). The human RDM1 gene is located in region q11.2 of chromosome 17. Finally, a search of SwissProt/TREMBL databases using BLAST identified a mouse protein (Q9CQK3, RIKEN cDNA clone 2410008M22) sharing significant sequence similarity with chicken and human RDM1 (see below). Sequence Analysis of the RDM1 Proteins—A multiple sequence alignment of human (284 aa), mouse (281 aa), and chicken (277 aa) RDM1 proteins is shown in Fig. 1A. Human RDM1 was found to display 71.1 and 51.2% identity and 78.9 and 62.6% similarity, respectively, with its murine and chicken homologs. When used to query the PFAM library of protein domains, the RDM1 sequences revealed the presence, in their N-terminal part, of a nucleic acid-binding motif of the RRM type (Fig. 1B). RRM signatures are found predominantly in various RNA- and ssDNA-binding proteins (34Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 35Ding J. Hayashi M.K. Zhang Y. Manche L. Krainer A.R. Xu R.M.

Struct. 1998; 27: 407-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), but their interaction with duplex DNA has also been reported (37DeAngelo D.J. DeFalco J. Rybacki L. Childs G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1254-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that in human RDM1, the RRM motif corresponds exactly to exon 2 (data not shown). We next investigated the sequence similarity between the RDM1 and RAD52 proteins. Human and yeast RAD52 proteins form multimeric ring structures that interact with ssDNA to mediate single-strand annealing (SSA) as well as RAD51-dependent and -independent strand invasion mechanisms (Refs. 20West S.C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 42729-42732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the ssDNA bound by RAD52 is exposed around the outside of the ring (41Parsons C.A. Baumann P. Van Dyck E. West S.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4175-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 42Van Dyck E. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. West S.C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of RAD52 variants proficient in SSA was solved (43Kagawa W. Kurumizaka H. Ishitani R. Fukai S. Nureki O. Shibata T. Yokoyama S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 359-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 44Singleton M.R. Wentzell L.M. Liu Y. West S.C. Wigley D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13492-13497Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), providing further insights into the mechanisms by which RAD52 rings interact with DNA. In a preliminary analysis, the sequence similarity shared by the RDM1 and RAD52 proteins was found to be restricted to an N-terminal region of RAD52 containing its ssDNA binding and ring formation domains. We next analyzed representative sequences of both families using MEME, a program that detects over-represented sequence motifs in unaligned sequences (45Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar, 46Bailey T.L. Gribskov M. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). A statistically significant (E value 3.5 × 10–75) 29-residue-long sequence motif shared by all sequences was identified (Fig. 1C). This motif, which we have named RD motif, spans residues 101–130 in chicken RDM1 and residues 104–133 in human and mouse RDM1. The precise location of ssDNA at the surface of a RAD52 ring is still unknown for lack of a co-crystal. However, the ssDNA is most probably bound within a deep groove that runs continuously around the outside of the ring (44Singleton M.R. Wentzell L.M. Liu Y. West S.C. Wigley D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13492-13497Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We noted that the N-terminal strand of the identified motif (aa 61–65) was part of a hairpin structure that comprises part of the proposed DNA-binding groove (Fig. 1D). Other residues of the RD motif take part in the interaction between the RAD52 monomers. For example, Phe-79 whose aromatic character is conserved in both RAD52 and RDM1 proteins forms a hydrophobic cluster with aa Leu-115, Tyr-81, Phe-158, and Tyr-31 of the adjacent monomer. Likewise, residues of helix 69–78 are in contact with residues of the adjacent monomer. Finally, we noted the presence of Cys-127 in the RD motif of human RDM1, although a Trp was present at this position in the other proteins of Fig. 1C. However, databases of single nucleotide polymorphisms report a Cys/Trp polymorphism at this position in human RDM1, with an allele frequency of ∼0.8 T (Cys) and ∼ 0.2 G (Trp) (NCBI SNP cluster ID, rs2251660; JSNP ID, IMS-JST047036). Disruption of RDM1 in Chicken DT40 Cells Confers Increased Sensitivity to Cisplatin—To investigate the role of RDM1 in DNA repair and recombination, we decided to disrupt it in the chicken B cell line DT40, whose genome can easily be modified by targeted recombination. To this end, we used a DT40 clone (DT40Cre1) containing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (MerCreMer) gene that can excise loxP-flanked (floxed) cassettes. Two RDM1 knock-out constructs (pRdm1Bsr and pRdm1Puro, harboring a blasticidin and a puromycin resistance marker, respectively) were made by cloning genomic fragments of the chicken RDM1 locus upstream and downstream of floxed drug resistance markers (Fig. 2A). Targeted integration of these constructs was expected to delete nearly half of the RDM1 coding region (from codon 66 to 181). Following transfection of pRdm1Bsr into DT40Cre1, a heterozygous RDM1 clone was identified (DT40 RDM1+/–), which was subsequently transfected by pRdm1Puro to produce a homozygous RDM1 knock-out clone (DT40 RDM1–/–) (Fig. 2A), indicating that RDM1 is not an essential gene. Both the blasticidin and the puromycin resistance markers were then removed from DT40 RDM1–/– by induction of the Cre recombinase, yielding the clone DT40 RDM1–/–E (where E indicates excised). The disruption of RDM1 and the excision of the drug resistance marker were confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 2B). The overall growth of RDM1–/–E cells was found to be comparable with that of wild-type cells. To examine the importance of RDM1 for DNA repair, we examined the viability of cells challenged with a variety of DNA-damaging agents using colony survival assays. For comparison purposes, we also used a DT40 cell line deficient in RAD54, a gene involved in HR and DSB repair (11Dronkert M.L. Kanaar R. Mutat.

https://openalex.org/W2167251968,"The peptide hormone gastrin is secreted from G cells of the gastric antrum and is the main inducer of gastric acid secretion via activation of its receptor the cholecystokinin 2 (CCK2) receptor. Both gastrin and CCK2 receptors are also transiently detected in the fetal pancreas and believed to exert growth/differentiation effects during endocrine pancreatic development. We demonstrated previously that whereas gastrin expression is extinguished in adult pancreas, CCK2 receptors are present in human glucagon-producing cells where their activation stimulates glucagon secretion. Based on these findings, we investigate in the present study whether gastrin regulates glucagon gene expression. To this aim, the CCK2 receptor was stably expressed into a glucagon-producing pancreatic islet cell line, and a glucagon-reporter fusion gene was transiently transfected in this new cellular model. We report that gastrin stimulates glucagon gene expression in glucagon-producing pancreatic cells. By using progressively 5′-increased sequences of the glucagon gene, gastrin responsiveness was located within the minimal promoter. Moreover, we clearly identified early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1) as an essential transcription factor interacting with the islet cell-specific G4 element. Egr-1 was shown to be essential for basal and gastrin-dependent glucagon gene transactivation. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway couples the CCK2 receptor to nuclearization and DNA binding of Egr-1.

Moreover they open new working hypothesis with reference to a potential role of gastrin in glucagon-producing pancreatic cells. Gastrin, an important gastrointestinal regulatory peptide, was recognized initially as the main inducer of gastric acid secretion. Gastrin is secreted from endocrine G cells of the gastric antrum during postnatal and adult life in response to a meal (1Dockray G.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 518: 315-324Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The cholecystokinin 2 (CCK2) 1The abbreviations used are: CCK2, cholecystokinin 2; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; Egr-1, early growth response protein 1; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2; Luc, luciferase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus. receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, specifically mediates the actions of gastrin on target cells via activation of multiple signaling enzymes including phospholipase C with subsequent phosphoinositide breakdown, intracellular calcium mobilization, and protein kinase C stimulation (2Silvente-Poirot S. Dufresne M. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 513-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), but also intracellular mediators classically described in the regulation of mitogenesis and cellular adhesion by growth factors. The mitogen-activated protein kinases, ERK1/2, Jun kinase, and p38 MAPK, as well as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, are known targets of gastrin. Several groups, including ours, have documented the contribution of upstream Src and Fak family tyrosine kinases in the activation of these pathways (3Kowalski-Chauvel A. Pradayrol L. Vaysse N.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7656-7670Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Besides a role in the stomach, several lines of evidence, including our data, raise the possibility that the endocrine pancreas is also a potential physiological target of gastrin. Indeed, because of the presence of responsive elements that account for islet expression on its gene promoter, the major site of expression of amidated gastrin is the pancreas of mammals during fetal life (7Bardram L. Hilsted L. Rehfeld J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 8Wang T.C. Dockray G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G6-G11PubMed Google Scholar). After birth, gastrin ceases to be expressed in the pancreas, supporting a specific role played in this organ during the fetal period (9Brand S.J. Andersen B.N. Rehfeld J.F. Nature. 1984; 309: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We confirmed the presence of amidated gastrin in human fetal pancreas together with localization of CCK2 receptors partly in undifferentiated cells and in glucagon-producing cells (10Saillan-Barreau C. Dufresne M. Clerc P. Sanchez D. Corominola H. Moriscot C. Guy-Crotte O. Escrieut C. Vaysse N. Gomis R. Tarasova N. Fourmy D. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2015-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Additionally, and further supporting a role in the endocrine pancreas, we demonstrated previously that gastrin may contribute to glucose homeostasis in adult via stimulation of glucagon secretion. Indeed, expression of CCK2 receptors on adult pancreatic glucagon cells was linked to a physiological secretion of glucagon from isolated human islets in response to gastrin (10Saillan-Barreau C. Dufresne M. Clerc P. Sanchez D. Corominola H. Moriscot C. Guy-Crotte O. Escrieut C. Vaysse N. Gomis R. Tarasova N. Fourmy D. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2015-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Of importance, the essential role of gastrin in the normal islet glucagon counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia has been confirmed recently in mice in which its gene has been knocked out (11Boushey R.P. Abadir A. Flamez D. Baggio L.L. Li Y. Berger V. Marshall B.A. Finegood D. Wang T.C. Schuit F. Drucker D.J. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1164-1174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although glucagon is the second major hormone in the control of glucose homeostasis, acting as a counterregulator to insulin, the regulation of its secretion, biosynthesis, and gene expression by nutrients and other factors has not been investigated as intensively as in the case of insulin. However, the metabolic consequences of abnormal α-cell function are well defined. Indeed, chronic hyperglucagonemia is a common feature of type II diabetic patients and is partially responsible for hyperglycemia (12Jiang G. Zhang B.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E671-E678Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Conversely, loss of the glucagon response impairs recovery from hypoglycemia in nondiabetic patients but is also a major factor in the susceptibility of patients with type I diabetes to prolonged and severe hypoglycemia (13Taborsky Jr., G.J. Ahren B. Havel P.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 995-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). There is evidence that increased glucagon gene expression accompanies hyperglucagonemia but also that regulation of glucagon gene expression may differ from that of glucagon secretion (14Dumonteil E. Magnan C. Ritz-Laser B. Meda P. Dussoix P. Gilbert M. Ktorza A. Philippe J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4540-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Effects of gastrin on the expression of glucagon are therefore important to consider. In the present study, we investigated whether gastrin regulates glucagon gene expression. To this aim and to characterize the molecular mechanisms involved in this effect, we engineered a new cellular model derived from the glucagonoma cell line InR1G9 (15Takaki R. Ono J. Nakamura M. Yokogawa Y. Kumae S. Hiraoka T. Yamaguchi K. Hamaguchi K. Uchida S. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1986; 22: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) stably expressing the human CCK2 receptor. We now report that gastrin stimulates glucagon gene expression and identify early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1) as an essential transcription factor for basal and gastrin-stimulated glucagon gene expression. Cell Culture—The glucagon-producing hamster InR1G9 cell line was stably transfected with a vector (PRFEneo) expressing the human CCK2 receptor using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (6Bierkamp C. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Dehez S. Fourmy D. Pradayrol L. Seva C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7656-7670Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere, in RPMI 1640 with Glutamax-I (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (BioWhittaker, Inc.), 50 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 200 μg/ml geneticin (Sigma). Receptor Binding Assay—Approximately 24 h after their transfer to 24-well plates (20,000 cells/well), cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 6.95, and 0.1% BSA and then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of RPMI, 0.1% BSA with 60 pm sulfated 125I-CCK9 in the presence of competing CCK9. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, pH 6.95, containing 2% BSA, and cell-associated radioligand was collected with 0.1 n NaOH added to each well. The radioactivity was counted in a γ-counter (Auto-Gamma, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). CCK2 Receptor Fluorescent Probe—The [Thr28,Ahx31]CCK-(25–33) peptide (CCK9) was derivatized with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma). The peptide was dissolved in 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 9, and reacted overnight with an equimolar quantity of fluorescent label. The fluorescent probe was purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. CCK2 Receptor Localization—Cells were cultured on glass slides overnight at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.2% BSA and incubated with 50 nm fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled CCK9 for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, and slides were mounted. Glucagon Secretion and Radioimmunoassay—Cells were cultured for 1 h in serum-free medium, containing 0.1% BSA, in 24-well plates (50,000 cells/well). Cells were incubated in 1 ml of RPMI, 0.1% BSA, containing CCK or gastrin at 37 °C for 1 h. Media were then collected and stored at -20 °C until use. Secretion of glucagon was quantified on 50 μl of medium by radioimmunoassay using 16 pm125I-glucagon, and an antibody was raised against the carboxyl terminus of glucagon (Gan8, 1:75,000, generously provided by Dr. D. Bataille, Inserm U376, Montpellier, France). Free glucagon was separated from antibody-bound glucagon adding 4 mg/ml activated charcoal and 5 mg/ml dextran T70 for 15 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 20 min, supernatants, containing glucagon-antibody complexes, were collected, and radioactivity was counted in a γ-counter. Northern Blot Analysis—Cells (1.5 × 106) were cultured in 60-mm culture dishes overnight in serum-free medium, containing 0.1% BSA, for 24 h at 37 °C before stimulation with 1 μm gastrin. Total cellular RNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA samples (10 μg/lane) were separated on formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gel and blotted onto nylon membrane. The blot was hybridized with glucagon cDNA probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random primer extension. Specific hybridization was visualized after exposure to a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To ensure RNA integrity and to confirm equal loading of lanes, the membrane was rehybridized with a probe for 18 S rRNA. Glucagon mRNA Stability—Glucagon mRNA half-life was determined from an actinomycin D decay curve. Actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) (Sigma) was added to the medium of both control and gastrin-stimulated cells. Total cellular RNA was extracted 4, 8, and 12 h after addition of gastrin. Levels of glucagon mRNA were then analyzed by Northern blot. DNA Transfection—Cells (4 × 106) were plated on 100-mm culture dishes 24 h before cotransfection. They were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method, with 3 μg of reporter gene plasmid (pOCAT) and 1 μg of pRSV-Luc, a transfection control plasmid. Reporter gene plasmid consisted of either rat wild-type glucagon gene -2.5-kb fragment (nucleotides -2.5 kb to +58) or 292-bp fragment (nucleotides -292 to +58), 169-bp fragment (nucleotides -169 to +58) or 138-bp fragment (nucleotides -138 to +58) of the 5′-flanking sequence of the rat glucagon gene, linked to the reporter gene CAT (-2.5 kb CAT, -292 CAT, -169 CAT, and -138 CAT, respectively). When indicated, -138 CAT was mutated at nucleotides -135/-130, -120/-115, -107/-102, -89/-88, -72/-71, or -56/-55 (called E47/β2 mut, 120 mut, β-TF1 mut, Pax-6 mut, Cdx-2/3 mut, and Isl-1 mut, respectively). Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase (CAT) Assay—24 h after transfection, cells were transferred into 60-mm culture dishes and cultured in serum-free medium with 0.1% BSA overnight at 37 °C. Cells were then stimulated or not with gastrin for 24 h in RPMI 1640, 0.1% BSA. When indicated, inhibition of MEK1 was achieved incubating serum-starved cells with the specific inhibitor 50 μm PD98059 for 1 h at 37 °C before stimulation with gastrin. Cell extracts were prepared and analyzed for CAT activity as described previously (16Philippe J. Drucker D.J. Knepel W. Jepeal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4877-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Quantification of acetylated and nonacetylated forms of chloramphenicol was done by PhosphorImager analysis. For each experiment, three independent transfections were performed, each of them carried out in duplicate. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Nucleotide substitution mutations of binding domains for transcription factors were performed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) using -138 CAT clone as template. The presence of desired mutations was confirmed by automated sequencing of both strands (Applied Biosystems). Nuclear Extracts—Cells (4 × 106) were plated on 100-mm culture dishes. Before stimulation with 1 μm gastrin for the indicated time periods, cells were cultured overnight in serum-free medium with 0.1% BSA. When indicated, inhibition of MEK1 was achieved by incubating serum-starved cells with 50 μm PD98059, the specific inhibitor of MEK1, for 1 h at 37 °C before stimulation with gastrin. Cells were washed with cold PBS, treated with trypsin, and centrifuged for 5 min at 100 × g at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, resuspended carefully in 400 μl of a 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, containing 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and incubated for 15 min on ice. 30 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added, and the mixture was vortexed and centrifuged for 1 min at 4 °C at 10,000 × g. Pellets were incubated and shaken at 4 °C for 15 min with 60 μl of a 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, containing 25% glycerol, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C, and supernatants were stored at -80 °C until use. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Double-stranded oligonucleotide probe 120 corresponding to the nucleotides -129/-108 (5′-AGCAGAGTGGGCGAGTGAAAT-3′) of the glucagon gene was 5′- end labeled with [32P]dATP using T4 kinase (Invitrogen). Binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 20 min in a final volume of 20 μl of binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 50 μg/ml BSA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ZnSO4, 1 μg of polydeoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid, 10 fmol of oligonucleotide probe, and 10 μg of nuclear proteins. For supershift experiments, 1 μg of a rabbit anti-Egr-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was incubated with nuclear proteins for 20 min at room temperature followed by an incubation period of 10 min on ice before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. For competition experiments, a 50-, 100-, or 200-fold excess of nonradioactive probe 120 mutated (5′-AGCAGAGTTCGATAGTGAAAT-3′) or not, or nonradioactive Egr-1 consensus site probe (5′-GGATCCAGCGGGGGCGAGCGGGGGCGA-3′), was incubated with nuclear proteins for 10 min at room temperature before the addition of the radiolabeled probe 120. DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1 m Tris, 90 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA at 150 V for 6 h at 4 °C, dried, and analyzed with PhosphorImager scanning. Cloning of Glucagon Gene Promoter from InR1G9-CCK2 Cells— InR1G9-CCK2 genomic DNA was purified according the manufacturer's procedures (QIAamp DNA mini kit, Qiagen). A primer pair for PCR amplification (5′-ATCAAGGGATAAGACCCTCAAATGA-3′ as the forward and 5′-GGGAACTTTGAGTGTGTTCTGCG-3′ as the reverse) was developed from conserved structures in the DNA sequences of rat, mouse, and human glucagon gene promoters in databases. PCR was carried out in a total volume of 100 μl according to the manufacturer's procedures (Invitrogen). The amplification reaction involved denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles as follows: 95 °C for 1 min, primer annealing at 50 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min. After cycling, a terminal elongation of 10 min at 72 °C was performed, and PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Plasmids DNA were transferred into Escherichia coli and isolated by mini-prep (Macherey-Nagel). Both strands of PCR products were sequenced using M13 reverse and M13 forward primers (Applied Biosystems). The partial hamster glucagon gene promoter sequence is available under the GenBank accession no. AY842856. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Cells (20 × 106) were plated on 150-mm culture dishes. Before stimulation with 1 μm gastrin for 1 h, cells were cultured overnight in serum-free medium with 0.1% BSA. Chromatin cross-linking was performed by adding 1% formaldehyde to the InR1G9-CCK2 cells at room temperature for 8 min. The reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, collected in 5 ml of PBS, and harvested by brief centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm benzamidine), incubated on ice for 5 min, and briefly centrifuged. Cells were then resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% sarcosyl, 0.5 m NaCl, protease inhibitors). Sonication of the cells was performed 30 times for 30 s in TEN buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl) with a Branson 250 sonifier. Chromatins were immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-Egr-1. A normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was used as the nonspecific antibody control. After incubation with 12 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1.5 h at room temperature, the beads were washed seven times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m LiCl, 0.7% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40) and once in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and extracted twice with 100 μl of elution buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS). Eluates were pooled, treated with 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 42 °C, heated at 65 °C overnight to reverse formaldehyde crosslinking, and purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by real time PCR using a Light-Cycler (Roche Diagnostics). Primers used for the analysis of the hamster glucagon promoter were 5′-CAAAGCGAGTGGGTGAGTG-3′ and 5-GCCACGCAGATATTACGCTG-3′, yielding an amplification product of 133 bp. The amount of PCR product was calculated from standard curves obtained from PCR with the same primers and serially diluted total DNA. Data were expressed as -fold differences relative to control conditions, in which normal rabbit serum was used instead of specific anti-Egr-1 antibody. Western Blot Analysis—For study of nuclear Egr-1 accumulation, 20 μg of nuclear protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Western blot analysis was performed using a rabbit anti-Egr-1 antibody (1:10,000). To demonstrate equivalent protein loading, membranes were reprobed with a mouse anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (1:500, Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA). For study of ERK1/2 activation, 50 μg of cytoplasmic protein extracted as described previously (5Dehez S. Bierkamp C. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Daulhac L. Escrieut C. Susini C. Pradayrol L. Fourmy D. Seva C. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 375-385PubMed Google Scholar) was separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted on membranes. Western blot analysis was performed using a goat anti-ERK1/2 MAPKs (1:10,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and a mouse antibody that specifically recognized the phosphorylated forms of ERK (1:10,000, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA). Membranes were incubated with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (1:10,000, Pierce) and proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Phosphorylation—Cells (4 × 106) were plated on 100-mm culture dishes overnight at 37 °C in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium without phosphate (ICN), containing 0.1% BSA. 200 μCi of 32Pi (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to medium 2 h before stimulation with 1 μm gastrin. After 1 h of stimulation with gastrin, whole nuclear extracts were prepared and were subjected to immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C, as described previously (3Kowalski-Chauvel A. Pradayrol L. Vaysse N. Seva C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26356-26361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using a rabbit anti-Egr-1 antibody preadsorbed on protein A-Sepharose. Whole immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), which was then exposed to a PhosphorImager. To confirm the identity of the immunoprecipitated radiolabeled proteins, the membrane was blotted with a rabbit anti-Egr-1 antibody (1:10,000) and revealed using the ECL system. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were cultured on glass slides. Before stimulation with 1 μm gastrin for 1 h, cells were cultured in serum-free medium with 0.1% BSA overnight at 37 °C and preincubated with the MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, when indicated. After stimulation, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. After blocking nonspecific background staining (Protein Block, DAKO S.A., Trappes, France) for 10 min at room temperature, cells were incubated with anti-Egr-1 antibody (1:5,000) in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Egr-1 was localized using a Cy2-coupled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:100, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). For visualizing nuclei, cells were incubated with 0.4 μg/ml DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Sigma) in PBS for 2 min at room temperature before mounting the slides. Data Analysis—Data are presented as the means ± S.E., and statistical significance was determined using the Student's t test. The threshold for statistical significance was a p value of less than 0.05. Characteristics of InR1G9-CCK2 Cells—Studies that determined the factors important for the regulation of glucagon gene expression mostly used the InR1G9 cells. Indeed, this cell line has characteristics similar to native islet α-cells, producing a stable and high level of glucagon and possessing the cellular machinery controlling glucagon gene expression. Therefore, to assess whether the CCK2 receptor regulates glucagon gene in pancreatic α-cells, we stably transfected the InR1G9 cells with a plasmid encoding the human CCK2 receptor cDNA. Selection of InR1G9 cell clones was based on their capacity to secrete glucagon in response to the CCK2 receptor agonists, CCK and gastrin, but also on the biphasic dose-response pattern of secretion as observed previously on isolated human islets of Langerhans (10Saillan-Barreau C. Dufresne M. Clerc P. Sanchez D. Corominola H. Moriscot C. Guy-Crotte O. Escrieut C. Vaysse N. Gomis R. Tarasova N. Fourmy D. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2015-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). One clone was selected, InR1G9-CCK2, which responded dose-dependently to gastrin and CCK, with glucagon secretion being detectable at 10 pm agonists and reaching a maximum at 1 nm (18.1 ± 4.4 and 18.9 ± 4.7 pmol/106 cells/h for CCK and gastrin, respectively) (Fig. 1A). Concentrations of CCK and gastrin eliciting half-maximal levels of glucagon secretion were nearly identical (0.09 ± 0.01 nm and 0.14 ± 0.01 nm for CCK and gastrin, respectively). At supramaximal concentrations of agonists, glucagon secretion decreased to nearly 50% of maximal secretion for both agonists. Non-transfected InR1G9 cells did not respond to gastrin or CCK (data not shown) in accordance with the absence of CCK2 receptor expression (Fig. 1B). In agreement with expression of a CCK2 receptor with typical binding characteristics in InR1G9-CCK2 cells, the binding affinity of sulfated CCK was in the nanomolar range (Kd = 3.1 ± 0.9 nm). The maximum number of CCK2 receptor binding sites seen by CCK was 2.1 ± 0.4 pmol/106 cells. Taken together, these results show that the selected InR1G9-CCK2 cells provide a new suitable experimental model for the study of the regulation of the glucagon gene by gastrin in pancreatic α-cells. Gastrin Stimulates Glucagon Gene Expression—We first determined whether the level of glucagon mRNA varied in response to CCK2 receptor activation by performing Northern blot analysis. Glucagon mRNA and 18 S rRNA were quantified from InR1G9-CCK2 cells stimulated with gastrin for up to 24 h. Gastrin increased glucagon mRNA abundance in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Indeed, stimulation was detectable with 1 nm gastrin from 6 h after induction (data not shown). Maximum stimulation (2.9-fold compared with nonstimulated cells) was observed at 24 h after stimulation with 1 μm gastrin (Fig. 2A). To eliminate the possibility that the increased level of glucagon mRNA resulted from a gastrin-dependent glucagon mRNA stabilization, we compared glucagon mRNA half-life in both control and gastrin-stimulated cells. For this purpose, actinomycin D, which completely blocks RNA synthesis, was added to InR1G9-CCK2 cells before incubation in the presence or absence of gastrin for 4, 8, and 12 h. In these conditions, the half-life of glucagon mRNA was nearly identical in both control and gastrin-treated cells (18.1 ± 1.2 h and 17.6 ± 1.1 h, respectively) (Fig. 2B), showing that gastrin does not modify the stability of glucagon mRNA in InR1G9-CCK2 cells and thus likely stimulates glucagon gene expression at the level of transcription. The Proximal Promoter of the Glucagon Gene Confers the Response to Gastrin—The proximal 350 bp of the rat glucagon 5′-flanking sequence has been well characterized and shown to contain the α-cell-specific G1 and the islet-specific G4 elements as well as the G5, G2, and G3 enhancer elements and a cAMP response element (Fig. 3A). To examine how gastrin stimulates glucagon gene expression, various plasmids progressively 5′-increased for the different elements of the rat promoter/enhancer region and fused to the CAT gene were transiently transfected into InR1G9-CCK2 cells. Gastrin stimulation of cells transfected with a plasmid containing the G1 and G4 promoter elements (-138 CAT) induced a significant 1.6-fold increase of the transcriptional activity (Fig. 3B). The addition of G5 element (-169 CAT) did not significantly modify the response t"
https://openalex.org/W2069424178,"20 S RNA virus is a positive strand RNA virus found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The viral genome (2.5 kb) only encodes its RNA polymerase (p91) and forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with p91 in vivo. A lysate prepared from 20 S RNA-induced cells showed an RNA polymerase activity that synthesized the positive strands of viral genome. When in vitro products, after phenol extraction, were analyzed in a time course, radioactive nucleotides were first incorporated into double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates and then chased out to the final single-stranded RNA products. The positive and negative strands in these dsRNA intermediates were non-covalently associated, and the release of the positive strand products from the intermediates required a net RNA synthesis. We found, however, that these dsRNA intermediates were an artifact caused by phenol extraction. Native replication intermediates had a single-stranded RNA backbone as judged by RNase sensitivity experiments, and they migrated distinctly from a dsRNA form in non-denaturing gels. Upon completion of RNA synthesis, positive strand RNA products as well as negative strand templates were released from replication intermediates. These results indicate that the native replication intermediates consist of a positive strand of less than unit length and a negative strand template loosely associated, probably through the RNA polymerase p91. Therefore, W, a dsRNA form of 20 S RNA that accumulates in yeast cells grown at 37 °C, is not an intermediate in the 20 S RNA replication cycle, but a by-product. 20 S RNA virus is a positive strand RNA virus found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Positive strand RNA viruses encode their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) 1The abbreviations used are: RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; ssRNA; single-stranded RNA; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; nt, nucleotide(s); Cs, cytidines; RI, replicative intermediate. 1The abbreviations used are: RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; ssRNA; single-stranded RNA; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; nt, nucleotide(s); Cs, cytidines; RI, replicative intermediate. and utilize them to replicate their RNA genomes in conjunction with other viral or host proteins. A well known example is the RNA coliphage Qβ replicase, consisting of a viral-encoded RdRp and host proteins, which can synthesize the positive and negative viral RNAs in vitro (1Blumenthal T. Carmichael B.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 525-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Unlike the holoenzyme of coliphage, most of the replicases of eukaryotic viruses are associated with intracellular membranous structures (2Buck K.W. Adv. Virus Res. 1996; 47: 159-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Schwartz M. Chen J. Janda M. Sullivan M. den Boon J. Ahlquist P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This makes their identification and characterization difficult. Although biochemical and genetic approaches have been attempted, replication mechanisms of eukaryotic viruses remain to be elucidated. If a membrane-free replication system is available, it may provide direct information on the replication mechanism and also on the components involved in this process. Most laboratory strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae harbor 20 S RNA virus. The virus belongs to the genus Narnavirus of the family Narnaviridae (4Wickner R.B. Esteban R. Hillman B.I. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Fauquet C. Bishop D.H.L. Carsten E. Estes M. Lemon S.M. Maniloff J. Mayo M. McGeoon D. Pringle C. Wickner R.B. Virus Taxonomy. Seventh Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Academic Press, New York2000: 651-656Google Scholar). It is a persistent virus and has no extracellular transmission pathway. Typical of fungal viruses, 20 S RNA virus does not kill the host nor render phenotypic changes to the host. This virus was originally described as an RNA species induced under nitrogen starvation conditions (5Kadowaki K. Halvorson H.O. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 826-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wejksnora P.J. Haber J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 246-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The copy number of 20 S RNA genome in some strains becomes almost equivalent to those of rRNAs under the induction conditions. The complimentary (negative) strands count less than 1–2% compared with the amount of positive strands, a ratio similar to those found among positive strand RNA viruses (7Novak J.E. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3384-3387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The viral genome is small (2514 nt) and has no 3′-poly(A) tail and perhaps no 5′-cap structure (8Rodríguez-Cousin ̃o N. Solórzano A. Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20363-20371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It encodes only a single protein of 91 kDa (p91) (9Matsumoto Y. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12779-12783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rodríguez-Cousin ̃o N. Esteban L.M. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12772-12778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). p91 contains four amino acid motifs well conserved among RdRps. Fewer strains of yeast harbor another narnavirus called 23 S RNA virus. Its genome is slightly larger than 20 S RNA genome (2891 nt) and encodes a single protein of 104 kDa (p104) (8Rodríguez-Cousin ̃o N. Solórzano A. Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20363-20371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 11Esteban L.M. Rodríguez-Cousin ̃o N. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10874-10881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RdRp motifs of p91 and p104 are most closely related to those of the RdRps of RNA coliphages (12Esteban R. Rodríguez-Cousin ̃o N. Esteban L.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 155-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These viruses are compatible in the same host and do not exclude each other. When yeast cells harboring these viruses are grown at high temperature (37 °C) the cells accumulate double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) called T and W (13Wesolowski M. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). T and W are the dsRNA forms of 23 S RNA and 20 S RNA, respectively (8Rodríguez-Cousin ̃o N. Solórzano A. Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20363-20371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because the viral genomes do not encode coat proteins, the RNA genomes are not encapsidated into viral particles (14Widner W.R. Matsumoto Y. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2905-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. García-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29771-29777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16García-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. Rodríguez-Cousin ̃o N. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20084-20089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Instead, they form ribonucleoprotein complexes with their cognate RNA polymerases in a 1:1 stoichiometry and reside in the host cytoplasm (17Solórzano A. Rodríguez-Cousin ̃o N. Esteban R. Fujimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26428-26435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Previously we detected a 20 S RNA positive strand-synthesizing activity in lysates prepared from 20 S RNA-induced cells (18García-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. Fujimura T. RNA. 1997; 3: 27-36PubMed Google Scholar). The activity was not associated with host cell membranes and migrated in sucrose gradients almost the same as 20 S RNA/p91 complexes. In this study, we analyzed replication intermediates of 20 S RNA synthesis in vitro and found that the native replication intermediates have a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) backbone, consisting of a positive strand less than unit length and a template negative strand loosely associated, perhaps held by p91. Deproteination with phenol converted the RNA in the intermediate to a double-stranded form. This indicates that W, the dsRNA form of 20 S RNA, is not a replication intermediate but a by-product of 20 S RNA replication. The completion of RNA synthesis in vitro resulted in the release of the synthesized positive strand as well as the negative strand template from the replication complex. Our results suggest that the positive and negative strand ssRNAs released from replication complexes are associated with protein. Preparation of Cell Lysates—Throughout this work, the yeast strain 37-4C (a kar1–1 leu1 20 S RNA, 23 S RNA, L-A-o, L-BC-o) (13Wesolowski M. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was used to prepare cell lysates. Yeast cells were grown in YPAD broth (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.04% adenine sulfate, and 2% glucose) for 2 days at 28 °C and then transferred to 1% potassium acetate (pH 7.0) at 28 °C for 16 h to induce 20 S RNA. The cells were harvested and washed once with water. The cells were suspended in lysis buffer (0.1 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and broken with glass beads by vortex mixing 10 times at the maximum speed for 15 s. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge at the maximum speed at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged again at 80,000 rpm (228,000 × g) in a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor at 4 °C for 1 h. The precipitate was suspended in the lysis buffer supplemented with 10% glycerol and kept at -70 °C before use. The strain also harbors 23 S RNA virus, but the lysates prepared as described above usually show a low 23 S RNA-synthesizing activity (<10% compared with the 20 S RNA-synthesizing activity in the same preparation) (18García-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. Fujimura T. RNA. 1997; 3: 27-36PubMed Google Scholar), perhaps due to the instability of 23 S RNA/p104 complexes in the buffer used (17Solórzano A. Rodríguez-Cousin ̃o N. Esteban R. Fujimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26428-26435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). RNA Polymerase Assay—RNA-synthesizing activity was assayed by incubating ∼1–2 μl of the lysate in the standard reaction mixture (12.5 μl) that contained 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.75, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2% bentonite, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm each of ATP, GTP, and CTP, and 20 μm UTP. 2–10 μCi of [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) were also included in the reactions. After incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.3% SDS and 5 mm EDTA. In pulse-chase experiments, an excess amount of non-labeled UTP (final concentration, 2 mm) was added at 5 min, and the incubation was continued until the time indicated in each experiment. RNA was extracted with phenol, phenol:chloroform, and chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and washed once with 80% ethanol. The precipitate was suspended in 1× loading buffer (0.04% bromphenol blue, 0.04% xylene cyanol, 1 mm EDTA), or 1× loading buffer containing 7 m urea and heated at 95 °C for 1 min. Then RNA was separated in a 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and the synthesis of RNA was detected by autoradiography. Gel-filtration Columns—Elimination of unincorporated NTPs from an RNA polymerase reaction mixture was done by passing the mixture through a Sephadex G-50 mini-spin column (Worthington). Briefly, an RNA polymerase reaction was carried out at 30 °C in the standard reaction mixture supplemented with [32P]UTP and 0.15 unit/μl RNasin (Promega). The reaction was stopped at 5 min by the addition of 15 mm EDTA, and the mixture was passed through the column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.75, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 4 mm dithiothreitol. After centrifugation, the filtrate was divided into aliquots. The aliquots were incubated again at 30 °C for 60 min with or without 15 mm MgCl2. Some aliquots were further supplemented with one of non-labeled NTPs (0.5 mm) or all of them together. After incubation, RNA was extracted and analyzed in an agarose gel without heat denaturation. Northern Hybridization—Northern hybridization with 32P-labeled RNA polymerase reaction products as probe has been described (18García-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. Fujimura T. RNA. 1997; 3: 27-36PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, non-labeled RNAs containing 20 S RNA or 23 S RNA sequences made in vitro by T7 or T3 RNA polymerase were separated in an agarose gel. 20 S RNA positive and negative strands (2514 nt) were made by T7 RNA polymerase using SmaI-digested pALI-17 (8Rodríguez-Cousin ̃o N. Solórzano A. Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20363-20371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and by T3 RNA polymerase using SmaI-digested pALI-18, respectively. Similarly, 23 S RNA positive and negative strands (2891 nt) were made by T7 transcription from SmaI-digested pALI-37 and by T3 transcription from SmaI-digested pALI-38 (17Solórzano A. Rodríguez-Cousin ̃o N. Esteban R. Fujimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26428-26435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), respectively. pALI-1 and pPAZ-11 contain DNA fragments of 20 S RNA from nt 10 to 178 and from nt 2288 to 2504, respectively, inserted between the T7 and T3 promoters of SK+ vector (Stratagene). Therefore, T7 or T3 run-off transcription from these plasmids pre-digested with appropriate restriction enzymes will produce transcripts containing 169 or 217 nt of 20 S RNA positive or negative strand terminal sequences as shown in the diagram of Fig. 2B. After electrophoresis the RNA was denatured in the gel and blotted onto a nylon membrane as described previously (19Fujimura T. Esteban R. Esteban L.M. Wickner R.B. Cell. 1990; 62: 819-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The membrane was hybridized with heat-denatured 32P-labeled RNA products, made in vitro by cell lysates in the standard RNA polymerase reaction mixture at 30 °C for 1 h. After hybridization, the membrane was washed, and the hybrids were detected by autoradiography (19Fujimura T. Esteban R. Esteban L.M. Wickner R.B. Cell. 1990; 62: 819-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the experiments shown in Fig. 2B, the membrane was treated, before the final stringent wash, with 5 μg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 15 min in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, and washed twice 15 min each at room temperature with the same buffer containing 0.5% SDS but without RNase A. Then, the final wash was done with a buffer containing 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.7, 0.18 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min. Non-denaturing Agarose Gels—For the analysis of replication intermediates, the replication reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 mm EDTA and 0.5× loading buffer without urea at the times indicated and the samples were directly loaded onto a 1.5% agarose gel. Agarose gels were made in TAE containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and run in the same buffer at 4 °C and at 6.5 V/cm for 2–3 h. After electrophoresis, the complexes were electroblotted onto a positively charged nylon membrane or a nitrocellulose membrane in TAE at 270 mA for 1 h at 4 °C using an electro-transfer unit from the Mini Protean II series (Bio-Rad). The blotted membrane was either directly exposed to an x-ray film for autoradiography (Fig. 5) or hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe specific to the negative strand of 20 S RNA (Fig. 6). The probe was made by T7 RNA polymerase from SmaI-digested pALI-22 (8Rodríguez-Cousin ̃o N. Solórzano A. Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20363-20371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), thus complementary to the negative strand sequence from nt 1 to 227 numbered from the 5′-end.Fig. 6Release of negative strand templates from replication complexes in vitro. A cell lysate was incubated at 30 °C in the standard RNA polymerase reaction mixture from which [32P]UTP was omitted. After 5-min incubation, non-labeled UTP (2 mm) was added, and the incubation was continued. Samples were withdrawn at the times indicated and directly loaded onto an agarose gel. After electrophoresis, RNA in the gel was electroblotted onto either a positively charged nylon membrane (A) or a nitrocellulose membrane (B). Negative strands of 20 S RNA on the membranes were detected by hybridization using a 32P-labeled specific probe followed by autoradiography. The broad band corresponding to the negative strand templates present in replication complexes (shown by brackets), and the single strand form of 20 S RNA negative strands are indicated. Phenol-extracted samples collected at 10 min were also run as controls (the far right lanes).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) dsRNA Replication Intermediates—20 S RNA virus-harboring cells, when grown under nitrogen-starvation conditions, accumulate a large amount of positive strands of 20 S RNA. Lysates prepared from these cells, enriched in 20 S RNA, have an RNA polymerase activity in vitro. The RNA products, extracted with phenol and heat-denatured in the presence of 7 m urea, migrated in an agarose gel mostly as a single-stranded form of 20 S RNA (Fig. 1A). We showed previously that most of in vitro products were full-length positive strands of 20 S RNA and that the incorporation of radioactive nucleotides required RNA synthesis and was not the result of a simple end-addition reaction to preexisting 20 S RNA molecules (18García-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. Fujimura T. RNA. 1997; 3: 27-36PubMed Google Scholar). When the in vitro products were hybridized with positive or negative strands of 20 S RNA or 23 S RNA transcribed from cDNAs, the labeled products mostly hybridized with 20 S RNA negative strands as observed previously (Fig. 2A). This demonstrates that the in vitro products were mostly positive strands of 20 S RNA. Scanning of the autoradiogram shown in Fig. 2A indicates that synthesis of 20 S RNA negative strands counts ∼2% of that of positive strands, roughly the same as the ratio of negative to positive strands present in the lysate. When parts of the sample shown in Fig. 1A were analyzed without heat denaturation, we found another, slower moving band whose mobility corresponded to W, a dsRNA form of 20 S RNA (Fig. 1B). During incubation, radioactive nucleotides were first incorporated into the dsRNA form with a peak at 20 min, and then the label in the dsRNA form decreased gradually (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, the appearance of the labeled ssRNA form was slightly delayed compared with that of the dsRNA form, but its amount increased steadily during the incubation (Fig. 1B). These results suggest a precursor-product relationship between them. This was confirmed by the pulse-chase experiments shown in Fig. 1D. During the first 5-min labeling period, most of labeled nucleotides were incorporated into the dsRNA form. After the addition of an excess amount of non-radioactive nucleotide, the label in the dsRNA form was converted into the final ssRNA products. When the same samples were heat-denatured in the presence of 7 m urea, the label in the dsRNA intermediates disappeared and was converted to ssRNA forms (Fig. 1C). This indicates that the labeled positive strands were non-covalently associated with negative strands. In the early labeling period we observed heterogeneous molecules moving faster than full-length 20 S RNA in the gel (Fig. 1C). During the chasing period these molecules became full-length. Therefore, they are 20 S RNA positive strand molecules shorter than full-length. In the absence of heat denaturation, however, these molecules were not detected at the same position in the gel (Fig. 1D). Instead, we observed a broad smear band between the dsRNA and ssRNA forms. During the following chasing period, this broad band moved upwards until reaching the position of the dsRNA. Furthermore, there was no incorporation into materials larger than the dsRNA form (Fig. 1D). These observations thus suggest that (i) the dsRNA form consists of a full-length template negative strand and a single molecule of full-length or almost full-length positive strand and (ii) that the smear broad band between the dsRNA and ssRNA forms has the same RNA composition as the dsRNA form but with a positive strand much shorter than full length and heterogeneous in size. Conversion of dsRNA Intermediates to ssRNA Products Requires RNA Synthesis—The conversion of the dsRNA form to the ssRNA products in vitro can be stopped by incubating the reaction mixture on ice or just by adding an excess amount of EDTA over Mg2+. This suggests that the conversion requires either hydrolysis of ATP or a net RNA synthesis. To examine these possibilities we did the following experiments. A cell lysate was incubated in the standard RNA polymerase reaction mixture containing [32P]UTP. After 5-min incubation, RNA synthesis was stopped by the addition of EDTA. A part of the sample was extracted with phenol and separated in an agarose gel (Fig. 3, lane 1). Most of radioactive nucleotides were incorporated into dsRNA intermediates, and incubating the mixture for another 60 min in the presence of EDTA did not convert the dsRNA intermediates into ssRNA products (lane 2). The rest of the sample was filtrated through a Sephadex G-50 spin column pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 10 mm EDTA to eliminate unincorporated radioactive nucleotides. The filtrate was then divided into five parts. One part was incubated 60 min without supplement (lane 3). The rest was incubated in the presence of 15 mm MgCl2 alone (lane 4) or MgCl2 along with 0.5 mm non-labeled CTP (lane 5), ATP (lane 6), or all four NTPs (lane 7). The dsRNA intermediates were converted into ssRNA products only when all 4 NTPs were present (lane 7). 0.5 mm GTP, or UTP alone, or 2 mm ATP did not support the conversion reaction (not shown). Therefore, these results indicate that the conversion of dsRNA intermediates into ssRNA products requires a net RNA synthesis. This indicates that the positive strands in the dsRNA intermediates are almost but not full-length and that the release of ssRNA products from dsRNA intermediates requires the completion of positive strand synthesis. In Vitro Synthesis Is Done by Chain Elongation at the 3′-Ends of Positive Strands—In a time course, the incorporation of radioactive nucleotides into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble materials was not uniform during the incubation time. We observed a vigorous RNA synthesis in the first 10 min of incubation, followed by a much slower incorporation (Fig. 1E). This suggests that there are no multiple rounds of RNA synthesis in vitro. We confirmed this by the hybridization experiment shown in Fig. 2B. A set of four small RNA fragments containing either the 5′- or 3′-end sequence of the 20 S RNA positive or negative strand was made by T7 or T3 transcription using non-labeled NTPs and separated in an agarose gel (Fig. 2B, left panel). After electrophoresis, these RNA fragments were blotted onto a nylon membrane. We made 32P-labeled RNA products by incubating a cell lysate in the standard RNA polymerase mixture for 60 min. The labeled products were heat-denatured and then hybridized with the four RNA fragments on the membrane. After hybridization the membrane was treated with RNase A under high salt conditions to digest the single-strand portions of the hybridized products. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 2B, RNA fragment 3 but not 2 hybridized with the labeled RNA products. This indicates that the RNA synthesis in vitro took place mostly close to the 3′-ends of 20 S RNA positive strands but not at the 5′-ends of the same molecules. Therefore, the RNA polymerization detected in the lysates was accomplished mostly by chain elongation of positive strands pre-initiated in vivo, and there was little (if any) de novo initiation in vitro. The RNA in Native Replication Complexes Is Mostly Single-stranded—As shown in Fig. 4, lane 1, phenol-extracted in vitro products resolved into two bands corresponding to the dsRNA intermediates and the final ssRNA products in an agarose gel. RNase A treatment under high salt conditions completely digested the ssRNA products, whereas the dsRNA intermediates remained undigested (lanes 4 and 5). When the same sample but without phenol extraction was treated with the enzyme under high salt conditions, both RNA bands disappeared (lanes 2 and 3). This indicates that RNA in native replication complexes is mostly single-stranded and that deproteination with phenol converted the negative strand template and the positive strand product in the complex into the dsRNA intermediates. Hereafter we call these native intermediates “replication complexes” to distinguish them from phenol-extracted dsRNA intermediates. This implies that they also contain proteins, at least its RdRp p91. Visualization of Replication Complexes in Non-denaturing Gels—Because the native complexes are directly involved in the 20 S RNA positive strand synthesis, we tried to detect and characterize them in their native state. For this purpose, we pulse-labeled RNA molecules by incubating lysates in the standard RNA polymerase reaction mixture and loaded the samples directly onto non-denaturing agarose gels (Fig. 5). After electrophoresis the labeled RNA products were electroblotted to a positively charged nylon membrane (Fig. 5A) or to a nitrocellulose membrane (Fig. 5C). This blotting procedure eliminated high background caused by unincorporated radioactive nucleotides. As control, parts of the samples were phenol-extracted, separated on the same gel, and electroblotted to the positively charged nylon membrane (Fig. 5B). In the control, radioactivity was incorporated mostly into the double-stranded forms during the first 5-min labeling period (Fig. 5B). After addition of an excess amount of non-labeled UTP, the label in the dsRNA form was rapidly converted to the ssRNA products, a pattern similar to the one observed in Fig. 1D. When the same, but native samples were analyzed, we obtained quite different results (Fig. 5A). During the 5-min labeling, radioactivity was incorporated into a broad band that moved slightly slower than the phenol-extracted ssRNA products, but much faster than the dsRNA forms. The radioactivity in the band was rapidly transferred to the ssRNA products during the following chasing period. There was no incorporation into the dsRNA form in the native samples (Fig. 5A). This is not an artifact related to the blotting procedure, because we obtained the same results when the gel was dried and exposed directly to an x-ray film (not shown). Although native replication complexes moved as a broad band, the lower edge of the band never ran faster than the ssRNA products, thus suggesting that the RNA content in the replication complex is more than a single molecule of 20 S RNA. After the addition of non-labeled UTP, the lower edge of the broad band shifted upwards, converging to the upper edge of the band in the first 10-min incubation (Fig. 5A). During the following incubation, all of the label in the broad band was converted to the ssRNA products. There is a good correlation between the mobility of four phenol-extracted ssRNAs (18 S rRNA, 20 S RNA, 23 S RNA, and 25 S rRNA) in the gel (Fig. 5D) and their nucleotide sizes (Fig. 5E). By extrapolation, the upper edge of the broad band in panel A was estimated to correspond to the mobility of an ssRNA ∼5 kb in size (Fig. 5E). Because 20 S RNA is 2514-nt long, this is equivalent to two molecules of 20 S RNA. This suggests that these intermediates at the upper edge contain a full-length negative strand and an almost full-length positive strand per complex. When the same native samples shown in Fig. 5A were electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane, we again observed a broad band corresponding to the replication intermediates (Fig. 5C). The upward movement of the lower edge of the band during incubation became more evident. Because nitrocellulose membranes are slightly negatively charged, phenol-extracted ssRNA"

DNA replication components are highly conserved across bacterial genera and are essential to survival but are largely distinct from the human DNA replication components. To date, published work relating to DNA replication in PA has focused on either characterization of the origin of replication (40Yee T.W. Smith D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here we describe the reconstitution of the DNA replication elongation apparatus from PA. This system will enable us to screen for inhibitors of PA DNA replication that may possess novel antibacterial properties. Construction of Overexpression Vectors—The sequences of each gene were amplified by PCR from PA (PAO1) genomic DNA and inserted in expression vectors. The PCR primers are shown in Table I. With the exception of the SSB expression vector, all of the expression vectors utilized the semi-synthetic highly inducible and repressible pA1 promoter (44Kim D.R. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20681-20689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When necessary, E. coli low usage codons in the N terminus of PA genes were altered to high usage codons, and non-AUG start codons were changed to AUG, to facilitate efficient translation in E. coli. A plasmid containing a pBR322 origin of replication, a gene expressing the lacIq repressor protein, and the semi-synthetic promoter, pA1, which is repressed by lacI, was used. The polylinker region was modified to introduce appropriate restriction sites to facilitate insertion of the desired PA genes. Details of each construct are included with the purification descriptions below. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated.Table IPrimers used in construction of expression vectorsGene amplifiedPrimer directionSequence (5′ → 3′)Restriction site(s)DnaNSenseAGTCTTAATTAACATGCATTTCACCATTCAACGCGAAPaclDnaNAntisenseAGTCACTAGTTTATTAGAGGCGCATCGGCATGACGASpeIDnaESenseAGTCTTAATTAAGCTTATGACCGTATCCTTCGTTCAPacI, HindIIIDnaEAntisenseAGTCACTAGTTATTAACGATAATTGAGGAAGASpeIDnaQSenseAGTCCATATGCGTAGCGTCGTACTGGATANdeIDnaQAntisenseAGTCGCTAGCAAGCTTATTCCTCCTCTACTATTCGCCGACCGGCGCCTCCANheI, HindIIIDnaXSenseAGTCTTAATTAAGCTTATGAGCTATCAAGTTCTTGCGCGTAAATPacIDnaXAntisenseAGTCACTAGTCTATCAGGCCTTGGCTTCCAAASpeIHolASenseAGTCTTAATTAAGCTAGCATGAAACTGACCCCGGCGCAACTCGCCAAGCACCTPacIHolAAntisenseAGTCACTAGTATTAAGCTTTATCCTCCTCTATCAGGCTGCCGGCAGGCCGASpeIHolBSenseAGTCCCATGGCTGATATCTATCCCTNcolHolBAntisenseAGTCACTAGTTATGCTAGCTTTCCTCCTCTACTAGCCCGGCCCGGGCAGGCTTSpeISsbSenseGATCCTGCAGGACGCGGTGCTGGTCCAPstlSsbAntisenseGTCAACTAGTCGCCTGAAAACGAAGASpeI Open table in a new tab Cell Growth and Lysis—Expression vectors were transfected into fermentation strains, AP1.L1 (F–, ompT hsdSB(rB–) (srl-recA)306::Tn10, T1 phage-resistant isolate) or MGC-1030 (mcrA mcrB λ– IN(rrn-D-rrnE)1 lexA3Δ(uvrD)::T rcΔ(ompT)::K rm). The time course of expression of recombinant proteins at 37 °C following IPTG induction was compared for the strains (data not shown). The strain giving optimal protein expression was chosen for large scale growth. No deleterious effects on cell growth were observed with any of the clones following induction. Cells expressing PA recombinant proteins were grown in a 180-liter fermentor at 37 °C (or 30 °C for αϵ expression) in F broth (yeast extract, 14 g/liter; Tryptone, 8 g/liter; K2HPO4, 12 g/liter; KH2PO4, 1.2 g/liter; glucose 1%) plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an A600 of ∼0.75. The pH was maintained at 7.2 by the addition of ammonium hydroxide. Additional ampicillin was added (200 μg/ml), and expression was induced (except SSB) by addition of IPTG to 1 mm. Cells were harvested at 3 h post induction with simultaneous chilling to 14 °C in the harvest line. Cells were suspended in an equal volume of Tris-sucrose (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose) and frozen by liquid nitrogen. Cells constitutively expressing PA SSB were grown in the same conditions as described above, but without the IPTG induction step, and were harvested at stationary phase. Lysis was accomplished via creation of spheroplasts by treatment of cells with lysozyme in the presence of 10% sucrose (45Cull M. McHenry C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 12: 147-154Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The presence of 18 mm spermidine kept the nucleoid condensed within partially disrupted cells and displaced DNA-binding proteins. Centrifugation (16,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C) resulted in a DNA-free supernatant (Fraction I). Activity Assays—Units are defined as picomoles of total nucleotide incorporated per minute at 30 °C. DNA synthesis activity was monitored during purification of αϵ, β, and τ3δδ′ using a reconstituted E. coli DNA pol III holoenzyme assay (33Olson M.W. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29570-29577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). M13Gori single-stranded phage DNA was used as template DNA and was purified as described previously (46Johanson K.O. Haynes T.E. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11460-11465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As purified PA subunits became available, these were substituted for their E. coli counterparts as indicated. Enzymes were diluted in EDB (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20% glycerol, 0.02% Nonidet P40, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Primase mix containing single-stranded DNA template, nucleotides, DnaG, and SSB was prepared first by incubating the following components for 20 min at 30 °C: 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20% glycerol, 0.02% Nonidet P40, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 13 mm Mg(OAc)2, 5 mm DTT, 0.27 mm each of rGTP, rUTP, rATP, and rCTP, 64 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, 24 μm dTTP, ∼60 cpm/pmol [3H]dTTP, 2.4 nm M13Gori single-stranded DNA circles, 42 μg/ml E. coli SSB, and 1.0 μg/ml E. coli DnaG primase. Primase mix was then aliquoted and frozen for use in subsequent assays. Holoenzyme reactions were reconstituted by incubating 20 μl of primase mix with E. coli pol III (αϵθ), τ3δδ′χψ, and β in a 25-μl reaction volume for 5 min at 30 °C. Buffer conditions were comparable to the priming reaction except that each of the components was 25% more dilute. Incorporation of [3H]dTTP was measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation on GF-C filters (18McHenry C.S. Crow W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1748-1753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the component being assayed, the corresponding E. coli subunit was omitted, and other components were used at saturating concentrations. Enzyme titrations were performed to determine the linear range of the assay, and specific activities were calculated using points in the linear range. In some cases where it was not necessary to determine absolute incorporation rates, formation of double-stranded DNA was measured by fluorescent detection of double-stranded DNA using PicoGreen (Molecular Probes) (47Seville M. West A.B. Cull M.G. McHenry C.S. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For these assays 100 RFU approximately equals 15 pmol of nucleotide incorporated. In this case, 25-μl reactions were performed in opaque 96-well plates and stopped with 25 μl of 100 mm EDTA. PicoGreen was diluted 1:150 in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); 150 μl was added to each well. Fluorescence emission at 538 nm was measured in a GeminiEM platereader (Molecular Dynamics) with excitation at 485 nm. DNA synthesis was measured as relative fluorescent units (RFUs). Primer extension assays were performed on single-stranded DNA templates that had been primed with a synthetic DNA oligonucleotide, 5′-AGGCTGGCTGACCTTCATCAAGAGTAATCT-3′. The oligonucleotide primer was annealed to M13Gori single-stranded DNA circles by mixing a 1:1 molar ratio of primer to template in the presence of 0.1 m KCl and 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), heating to 95 °C for 4 min and slowly cooling to room temperature. Primer extension reactions were performed in a 25-μl reaction volume for 10 min in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20% glycerol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm rATP, 48 μm each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 24 μm dTTP, ∼60 cpm/pmol [3H]dTTP, 2 nm primed template DNA, and enzyme components as indicated. Acid-precipitable 3H label was measured to determine the picomoles of DNA incorporated. Reaction temperatures are indicated in the figure legends. Estimates of PA Protein Complex Concentrations—We assumed that the stoichiometry of PA protein assemblies was the same as their E. coli counterparts: αϵ, β2, τ3δδ′, and SSB4. Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay (Pierce) and a bovine serum albumin standard. Gel Electrophoresis and Protein Analysis—SDS-PAGE analysis of αϵ, τ3δδ′, and β samples was performed using 4–12% acrylamide gradient pre-cast gels (Novex NuPAGE; Invitrogen) using MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen). Benchmark unstained protein molecular weight markers were used (Invitrogen). SDS-PAGE analysis of SSB samples was performed on 10–20% acrylamide Novex Tris-glycine pre-case gels (Invitrogen) using Tris-glycine running buffer (Invitrogen). Gels were stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain (Invitrogen) or with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Comparable results were obtained with either staining method. Densitometry was performed using a Kodak Image Station 440CF. Peptide mass fingerprinting for protein identification was performed by Amprox, Inc. (Carlsbad, CA). N-terminal sequencing was performed at the Molecular Resource Center (National Jewish Medical Center) using Edman degradation. Buffers Used in Purifications—Subscripts indicate millimolar concentration of NaCl in each buffer (i.e. A40 is A0 and 40 mm NaCl). BW is 20% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 m KOAc (pH 8.0), 0.19 g/ml ammonium sulfate (i.e. 34% ammonium sulfate saturation). A0 is 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mm DTT. B0 is 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. C is 50 mm imidazole (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm DTT. D is 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT. E0 is 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT. F is 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA. G100 is 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 100 mm NaCl. Expression and Purification of αϵ—The vector pA1-CB-NdeI and the dnaQ PCR fragment were cut with NdeI and NheI, and the dnaQ PCR fragment was inserted, resulting in the plasmid pA1-PA-dnaQ. The vector pA1-CB-NcoI and the dnaE PCR fragment were cut with SpeI and PacI, and the dnaE PCR fragment was inserted, resulting in the plasmid pA1-PA-dnaE. An operon expressing dnaQ and dnaE was constructed by digesting pA1-PA-dnaE1 with HindIII and SpeI. The fragment containing the dnaE gene (∼3.5 kb) was inserted into pA1-PA-dnaQ that had been digested with the same two restriction enzymes, resulting in the plasmid pA1-PA-core1, containing the dnaQ gene upstream of the dnaE gene. Cells (2045 g) were grown, harvested, and lysed as described above. Ammonium sulfate (0.21 g to each initial milliliter of Fraction I; 37% saturation) was added slowly to Fraction I. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended using a Dounce homogenizer in 0.125 × Fraction I volume of BW buffer. The remaining precipitate was collected by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in buffer A0 and diluted to match the conductivity of buffer A40, forming Fraction II. Fraction II was applied to a 5-cm × 7-cm MacroPrep High S (Bio-Rad) column connected in series with a 5- × 35-cm DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in A20. The columns were washed with 300 ml of buffer A20. Then the S column was disconnected, and the DEAE-column was washed with 3200 ml of buffer A40 followed by a 6.4-liter linear gradient from 40 to 400 mm NaCl. The PA αϵ complex eluted at ∼150 mm NaCl, and fractions with the highest specific activity were pooled to form Fraction III. Fraction III was precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate. Fraction III pellet was resuspended in buffer A0 and was diluted to match the conductivity of buffer A30 and applied to a 2.5- × 41-cm heparin-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in buffer A30. The column was washed with ∼17 column volumes of buffer A30, followed by a 2-liter linear gradient from 30 to 500 mm NaCl. αϵ eluted at ∼100 mm NaCl, and fractions with the highest specific activity were pooled to form Fraction IV. Expression and Purification of β—The vector pA1-CB-NdeI and the dnaN PCR fragment were cut with SpeI and PacI, and the dnaN PCR fragment was inserted, resulting in the plasmid pA1-PA-dnaN. Cells (40 g) were grown, harvested, and lysed as described above. Ammonium sulfate (0.197 g to each initial milliliter of Fraction I; 35% saturation) was added slowly to Fraction I, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C). Ammonium sulfate was added to the resulting supernatant (0.153 g to each milliliter of 35% supernatant; 60% saturation), and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C). The pellet containing the 35–60% ammonium sulfate fraction was resuspended in buffer B0 diluted to match the conductivity of buffer B50, forming Fraction II. Fraction II was applied a 2.5- × 40-cm DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer B50. The column was washed with 400 ml of buffer B50, followed by a 2-liter linear gradient from 50 to 600 mm NaCl gradient. The β subunit eluted at ∼75 mm NaCl, and fractions with the highest specific activity were pooled to form Fraction III. Fraction III was applied to a 5- × 20-cm hydroxyapatite column (Hypatite C, Clarkson Chemical Co.) equilibrated in buffer C. The column was washed with 800 ml of buffer C, followed by a 4-liter linear gradient from 0–200 mm potassium phosphate. The β subunit eluted at ∼100 mm phosphate, and fractions with the highest specific activity were pooled to form Fraction IV. Fraction IV was dialyzed into buffer D for storage. Expression and Purification of τ3δδ′—The vector pA1-CB-NcoI and the holB PCR fragment were cut with SpeI and NcoI, and the holB PCR fragment was inserted, resulting in the plasmid pA1-PA-holB. The vector pA1-CB-NcoI and the holA PCR fragment were cut with SpeI and PacI, and the holA PCR fragment was inserted, resulting in the plasmid pA1-PA-holA. The vector pA1-CB-NcoI and the dnaX PCR fragment were cut with SpeI and PacI, and the dnaX PCR fragment was inserted, resulting in the plasmid pA1-PA-dnaX. An operon expressing holB, and holA was constructed by digesting both pA1-PA-holA and pA1-PA-holB with NheI and SpeI. The fragment from pA1-PA-holA containing holA (∼1 kb) was then inserted into the digested pA1-PA-holB, resulting in the plasmid pA1-PA-holBA. A three-gene operon was then constructed by digesting both pA1-PA-dnaX and pA1-PA-holBA with HindIII and SpeI. The fragment of pA1-PA-dnaX containing the dnaX gene (∼2 kb) was then inserted into the digested pA1-PA-holBA plasmid, resulting in the plasmid pA1-PA-BAX, with the holB gene upstream, followed by holA and dnaX, respectively. Cells (400 g) were grown, harvested, and lysed as described above. Ammonium sulfate (0.197 g to each initial ml of Fraction I; 35% saturation) was added slowly to Fraction I, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in buffer E0 and diluted to match the conductivity of buffer E20, forming Fraction II. Fraction II was divided into three parts, and one-third was applied to 20-ml MacroPrep High S (Bio-Rad; 4- × 5-ml S Econo-Pac cartridges) connected in series to a 5- × 10.2-cm heparin-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer E20. The columns were washed with 600 ml of buffer E20. The High S cartridges were removed, and the heparin column was washed with another 200 ml of buffer E20, followed by a 2-liter linear gradient from 20 to 1000 mm NaCl. τ3δδ′ eluted at ∼150 mm NaCl, and fractions with the highest specific activity were pooled to form Fraction IIIA. The columns were then regenerated as per the manufacturer's recommendations, and additional Fraction II was purified, creating Fractions IIIB and IIIC. Ammonium sulfate (0.366 g/ml Fraction III; 60% saturation) was added slowly to each batch of Fraction III, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). Fraction III pellets were resuspended in buffer F0 and diluted to match the conductivity of buffer F20, and Fractions IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC were pooled and applied to a 2.5- × 20-cm DEAE-Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer F20.

https://openalex.org/W1977630961,"Development of drug resistance in cancer is one of the main challenges in chemotherapy, and many mechanisms are still unknown. In this study, we show that tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) increases postdrug survival from 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (FdUrd) in two human colon tumor cell lines. This resulted in the development of drug-resistant cells in a TNFα-dependent manner. Interestingly, although the drug-resistant cells were selected using FdUrd, they are also resistant to a number of other antimetabolites in the DNA synthesis pathway in a TNFα-dependent manner. Only in the drug-resistant cells (p35-colo201) TNFα treatment resulted in G0-G1 arrest but not in the parental colo201 and other cell types. Blocking TNFα-induced cell cycle arrest sensitized drug-resistant cells to FdUrd. TNFα-induced cell cycle arrest required IKK. IKK inhibition by a small molecule inhibitor or by the knockdown of IKKα, IKKβ, or RelA/p65 using siRNA, but not the inhibition of JNK, MEK, p38, or caspase-8 pathways, blocked TNFα-induced G0-G1 arrest and restored sensitivity to FdUrd of drug-resistant cells. TNFα reduced the transcripts and protein levels of phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (Rb), Rb, E2F1, and Cdk4 only in drug-resistant p35-colo201 cells. This effect of TNFα was reversed by IKK inhibitor, suggesting that TNFα-induced cell cycle arrest is probably due to the reduction of Rb, E2F1, and Cdk4. Taken together, this study shows that, in vitro, TNFα-induced cell cycle arrest through IKK can provide a mechanism for the development of drug resistance to anti-cancer drugs, purine and pyrimidine analogues.

Intrinsic or acquired resistance to anti-cancer drugs is the major cause of failure in cancer chemotherapy. Intrinsic resistance is present at the time of treatment and often can be diagnosed. Acquired resistance develops during and after chemotherapy (1Pinedo H.M. Giaccone G. Lancet. 1997; 349: 7-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pinedo H.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 65: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Known intrinsic mechanisms of drug resistance in cancer include changes in drug influx and efflux, intracellular activation and catabolism, or drug target modifications (2Pinedo H.M. Int. J.

For example, increased expression of thymidylate synthase in some colon tumors is associated with intrinsic fluoroprymidine resistance (5Mader R.M. Muller M. Steger G.G. Gen. Pharmacol. 1998; 31: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, there still are a large number of drug-resistant cancers with unknown mechanisms (6Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). Unraveling these mechanisms is essential for rational design of combination chemotherapy. Antimetabolites of purine and pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism such as 5-fluorouracil, 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (FdUrd), 1The abbreviations used are: FdUrd, 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TGF, transforming growth factor; IL, interleukin; Rb, retinoblastoma protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; CKI, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. methotrexate, 3-deazauridine, ribavirin, hydroxyurea, and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C; an inhibitor of DNA polymerases α and β) inhibit enzymes at different steps of biosynthetic pathways of DNA and RNA (7Hatse S. De Clercq E. Balzarini J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 539-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and are widely used in cancer chemotherapy. These agents inhibit the proliferation of dividing cells and very importantly exhibit relatively lower toxic side effects than other drugs such as DNA-damaging agents (8Chu E. Johnston P.G. Grem J.L. Takimoto C.H. Van Groeningen C. Chabner B.A. Allegra C.J. Cancer Chemother. Biol. Response Modifiers. 1994; 15: 1-31PubMed Google Scholar). However, a relatively high number of cancers have either intrinsic or acquired resistance to these agents (9Spears C.P. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 1995; 9: 397-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To overcome the drug resistance and increase efficacy, these antimetabolites are combined together or with cytotoxic agents (10Skeel R.T. Handbook of Cancer Chemotherapy. 6th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2003Google Scholar). However, the high degree of systemic toxicity and harmful side effects of cytotoxic drugs limit their usage. Purine and pyrimidine antimetabolites affect both DNA and RNA metabolism. The effects on RNA and proteins are transient, and thus the main pathway of cytotoxicity is through the arrest of DNA synthesis in the S-phase of the cell cycle (9Spears C.P. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 1995; 9: 397-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fully differentiated or “quasy” quiescent cells, which are arrested in the G0-G1-phase of the cell cycle are resistant to the anti-proliferative activity of antimetabolites (7Hatse S. De Clercq E. Balzarini J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 539-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Furthermore, slowly growing tumors show poor sensitivity to chemotherapy. Conditions or extracellular signals that cause a slow growth or a G0-G1 cell cycle arrest in cancer cells could provide conditions for survival against antimetabolites. Cytokines produced by tumors or by cells of the immune system and by cells in a tumor microenvironment could generate such signals. Many cytokines regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and death. Cytokines such as TNFα, TGFβ, and IL-1β, for instance, have cell-stimulatory or growth-inhibitory effects in different cell types. TNFα is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by macrophages and other immune cells in local responses to infection, tissue injury, and repair. TNFα has a wide range of functions including stimulation of the immune system, tissue differentiation, induction of programmed cell death, and tissue repair (11Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar, 12MacEwan D.J. British J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 855-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In some cells, TNFα induces cell cycle arrest at G0-G1 phase (13Nalca A. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30517-30523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14Jeoung D.I. Tang B. Sonenberg M. J. Biol.

TNFα was also shown to induce resistance to doxyrubicin in a lung cancer cell line by shifting S phase to G0-G1 phase (17Prewitt T.W. Matthews W. Chaudhri G. Pogrebniak H.W. Pass H.I. J. Thoracic Cardiovasc. Surg. 1994; 107: 43-49Abstract Full Text PubMed Google Scholar). TNFα is produced by many tumors (18Ardizzoia A. Lissoni P. Brivio F. Tisi E. Perego M.S. Grassi M.G. Pittalis S. Crispino S. Barni S. Tancini G. J. Biol. Regulators Homeostatic Agents. 1992; 6: 103-107PubMed Google Scholar, 19Takeyama H. Wakamiya N. O'Hara C. Arthur K. Niloff J. Kufe D. Sakarai K. Spriggs D. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4476-4480PubMed Google Scholar), and its level is elevated in the sera of cachectic patients with advanced tumors (20Miwa M. Kojima T. Naruse T. Cancer Biother. Radiopharm. 2001; 16: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). TNFα at high levels (10–7m) kills certain tumors, but it also causes systemic toxicity leading to septic shock (21Borrelli E. Roux-Lombard P. Grau G.E. Girardin E. Ricou B. Dayer J. Suter P.M. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 24: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). TNFα at levels comparable with its concentration in local inflammatory areas (10–9m) causes G0-G1 arrest in the A375-C6 melanoma cell line (22Morinaga Y. Suzuki H. Takatsuki F. Akiyama Y. Taniyama T. Matsushima K. Onozaki K. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3538-3542PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of TNFα-induced cell cycle arrest includes the induction of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (Rb) in A375-C6 cells (23Muthukkumar S. Sells S.F. Crist S.A. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5733-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Unphosphorylated or hypophosphorylated Rb is present at early to middle G1 phase, which associates with E2F1 and suppresses its activity. Phosphorylation of Rb by Cdk4 and Cdk6 at late G1 phase results in activation of E2F1 and S phase entry of cells (24Tetsu O. McCormick F. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). TNFα exerts its biological functions by activating signaling pathways that regulate NF-κB, AP-1, p38, ERK, and death pathways. Activation of IKK/NF-κB by TNFα protects cells from apoptosis and is required for production of cell cycle and immune regulatory proteins (11Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar). NF-κBs are homo- and heterodimeric transcription factors that are kept in an inactive state by inhibitory IκB proteins. Activated IKK phosphorylates regulatory serines on IκB inhibitors, marking them for polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Free NF-κB binds to target gene promoters and activates the rate of transcription of a large number of genes including cyclin D and antiapoptotic proteins (25Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar). Hence, IKK/NF-κB activation in most cell types results in increased proliferation and prevention of cell death. Activation of NF-κB by a number of anti-cancer drugs has also been shown to protect cells from death, thus reducing the cytotoxic effect of drugs (26Greten F.R. Karin M. Cancer Lett. 2004; 206: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). IKK complex is a multisubunit kinase. It is composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory factor, IKKγ. IKKβ and IKKγ are required for activation of NF-κB by most of the proinflammatory cytokines such TNFα and IL-1 (27Karin M. Yamamoto Y. Wang Q.M. Nat. Rev. Drug Discovery. 2004; 3: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). This paper reports that TNFα, in an IKK-dependent manner, increases postdrug recovery and survival of a human colon tumor cell line from FdUrd, resulting in the development of drug-resistant cells. Only in drug-resistant cells, through IKK, does TNFα prevent S phase entry by reducing phospho-Rb, Rb, E2F1, and Cdk4 levels. Cell Culture and Small Molecule Inhibitors—Human colon cancer cell lines, colo201 and colo320, were generously provided by Dr. Heinz Lenz. The cells are maintained in RPMI1640 (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. The supplement reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Cells were trypsinized and split 1:10 every 3–4 days. On the day before each experiment, the cells were seeded at the indicated densities to maintain exponential growth throughout the duration of experiment. Small molecule inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem. PS1145 was a generous gift from Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cells were seeded at 2500 cells/well in a 96-well plate in triplicate and treated with or without drugs the next day, and cell proliferation was followed each day using the Promega CellTiter 96AQuous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The concentration of TNFα was 10–20 ng/ml, and the concentration of FdUrd (Sigma) was 10 μm unless otherwise stated. The percentage of cell survival was calculated as the percentage of cell proliferation in the presence of drug(s) divided by cell proliferation in the absence of drug(s). Cell Death Assay—colo201 cells were seeded at 500,000 cells/well in 6-well plates in triplicate and grown for 24 h. Cells were left untreated or treated with FdUrd (10 μm) or FdUrd + TNFα (20 ng/ml) for 24, 48, 72, or 98 h. At the indicated times, cells were harvested by scraping and counted, and apoptosis was determined using the ApoAlert Annexin V staining kit (BD Biosciences) using the manufacturer's specifications. The results shown are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Survival Plate Assay—Cells were seeded at 250,000 cells/well in a 6-well plate in triplicates. FdUrd at 10 μm or other drugs as indicated in the figures were added individually or in combination with TNFα at 20 ng/ml for 5 days. Cells were then washed free of the drugs, fresh media were replenished every 3–4 days thereafter, and each plate was followed for 9–21 days postrelease. The plates were stained and documented using a scanner, and colonies were counted manually. Drug combination usually consisted of 1–6 h of TNFα pretreatment, followed by FdUrd or other drugs unless otherwise stated. Cell Cycle Analysis by a Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter (FACS)— For each assay ∼5 × 105 cells were used. At the time of harvest, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and removed from dishes by trypsin. Cells were fixed by 70% ethanol and stained in the dark with 1 mg/ml propidium iodide in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mg/ml RNase A. Cell cycle profiles were analyzed by FACS. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay—Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 1000 cells/well. After 24 h, drugs and/or TNFα were added as indicated in the figures. One μCi of [3H]thymidine (0.5 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) was added 24 h later, and cells were harvested on a glass fiber filter using a Skatron cell harvester (Skatron Instruments, Lier, Norway) and analyzed in the Tri-Carb Liquid Scintillation Analyzer (model 2100TR; Packard Instrument Co.). Results are mean cpm of triplicate wells. Cell Lysate Preparation—Whole cell lysates were prepared as described (28Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in an all purpose buffer (consisting of 20 mm Tris, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2.5 mm metabisulfite, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, pH 7.6) supplemented with 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and freshly added protease/phosphatase inhibitors (2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 8.5 μg/ml bestatin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmp-nitrophenol phosphate). Lysed cells were centrifuged in Biofuge pico at maximum speed for 30 min at 4 °C, and whole cell lystates were separated and stored at –80 °C after protein concentrations were determined (Bio-Rad). In Vitro Kinase Assay—Whole cell lysate proteins (100 μg) were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of rabbit anti-IKKα antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) overnight in the presence of Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Kinase activities were determined as described (29Miller B.S. Zandi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36320-36326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, kinase activity was assessed after 30 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) mixture containing 20 μm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5–10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of glutathione S-transferase-IκBα 1–54 protein as substrate, followed by 10% SDS-PAGE. The unbound [γ-32P]ATP at the dye front was removed before the remaining SDS-polyacrylamide gel was subjected to protein transfer onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) at 300 mA for 2 h. The membrane was exposed to a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) overnight and analyzed via ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences) software. Each membrane was blocked in 5% milk and then probed with mouse anti-IKKα antibodies (Pharmingen) to judge immunoprecipitation efficiency. After stripping (50 mm glycine, 200 mm NaCl, pH 3.0, 2 h at 50 °C), each membrane was blocked and probed with mouse anti-IKKβ antibodies (Imgenex, CA) again to evaluate IKKβ levels immunoprecipitated. Immunoblot Assay and Antibodies—For immunoblots, 20–40 μg of whole cell lysates was used. The following antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling: anti-phospho-Rb (catalog no. 9308; phosphoserines 807 and 811), anti-phospho-c-Jun (catalog no. 9261; phosphoserine 63), anti-phospho-ATF2 (catalog no. 9221; phosphothreonine 71), anti-Rb (catalog no. 9309), anti-phospho-IκBα (catalog no. 9241), anti-IκBα (catalog no. 9242), anti-Cdk4 (catalog no. 2906), and anti-Cdk6 (catalog no. 3136). The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: anti-E2F1 (catalog no. 193) and anti-phospho-ERK (catalog no. 7383). Anti-p65/RelA (catalog no. 20681415) was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Cell Transfection and siRNAs—Cell transfection for siRNAs was done using OligofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) as described by vendor protocol. In preliminary experiments, various concentrations (1–100 nm) of duplex oligonucleotides were used to determine the optimal concentration of siRNA for knockdown of each protein described in the figures. The sequences of oligonucleotides used were as follows: IKKα siRNA, sense strand (5′-AGGAAGGACCUGUUGACCUUTT) and antisense (5′-AAGGUCAACAGGUCCUCCUTT); IKKβ siRNA, sense strand (5′-UGGUGAGCUUAAUGAAUGATT) and antisense (5′-UCAUUCAUUAAGCUCACCATT); inverted IKKα control siRNA, sense (5′-UUCCAGUUGUCCAGGAGGATT) and antisense (5′-UCCUCCUGGACAACUGGAATT); p65/RelA siRNA, sense (5′-AGAGGACAUUGAGGUGUAUTT) and antisense (5′-AUACACCUCAAUGUCCUCUTT). Ribonuclease Protection and RT-PCR Assay—RNA isolation and the ribonuclease protection assay were performed as described by the BD RiboQuant (BD Biosciences) instruction manual. The multiprobe template set hCC2 (catalog no. 556160) containing cell cycle regulator templates p130, Rb, p107, p53, p57, p27, p21, p19, p18, p16, p14/15, L32, and GAPDH was used. For RT-PCR, a total of 10 μg of RNA was first reverse transcribed using ProtoScript First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs) in 16-μl reactions. For PCR, 1–3 μl of first strand cDNA was used. The following primer sets were used to amplify GAPDH, E2F1, and Cdk4: Cdk4, sense (5′-GAGAGTCCCCAATG) and antisense (5′-GTGGGGGTGCCTTG); E2F1, sense (5′-CTGACCACCAAGCG) and antisense (5′-GTCCGCCGACGCCC); GAPDH (provided by the ProtoScript First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit from New England Biolabs), sense (5′-TGC(A/C)TCCTGCACCACCAACT) and antisense (5′-(C/T)GCCTGCTTCACCACCTTC) cDNA. TNFα Increases Postdrug Survival of a Small Number of FdUrd-treated colo201 and colo320 Cells—To investigate whether proinflammatory cytokine TNFα modifies cancer cell response to antimetabolites of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, we examined its effect on the short term cytotoxicity and postdrug survival of FdUrd in two human colon tumor cell lines, colo201 and colo320. We first examined the effect of TNFα by itself and in combination with 10 μm FdUrd on the cell proliferation of colo201. The 10 μm FdUrd concentration is 100-fold above the 50% growth-inhibitory (GI50) concentration of FdUrd in colo201 cells in culture for up to 4 days of treatment. We determined the GI50 of FdUrd for these cells to be about 0.1 μm (data not shown). TNFα at 5, 10, or 20 ng/ml reduced cell proliferation only 10–15% (Fig. 1A). Treatment of cells with 10 μm FdUrd alone reduced cell proliferation up to 95% after 4 days of treatment (Fig. 1A). Pretreatment of the cells with TNFα did not significantly reduce or increase the cytotoxicity of FdUrd (Fig. 1A). Since cell proliferation assay is not an indicator of cell death, we also examined the combined effect of TNFα and FdUrd on the cell death by annexin V assay (see “Materials and Methods”). TNFα by itself did not increase cell death in colo201 cells above the basal level in culture (Fig. 1B). TNFα also did not change cell death induced by FdUrd (Fig. 1B). Thus, TNFα does not seem to alter the cytotoxicity of FdUrd in an overwhelming majority of colo201 cells. However, with or without TNFα, consistently a small fraction (about 5%) of colo201 cells survived 4–5-day FdUrd treatment (Fig. 1A). Using a colony survival assay, we next examined whether TNFα alters the postdrug recovery and survival of the small percentage of cells that survived. We pretreated or not colo201 and colo320 cells with 20 ng/ml TNFα for 1 h prior to treatment with 10 μm FdUrd. Cells were treated for 5 days, after which the floating cells were washed off of the plate, and FdUrd- and TNF-free culture medium was added. The cells that remained adhered to the plate were grown for 3 weeks, after which the cells were fixed and the colonies were counted. In both cell lines, significantly more colonies grew on TNFα-pretreated plates than the FdUrd-only treated plates (Fig. 1C). Thus, TNFα increased the recovery of a small fraction of colo201 and colo320 cells treated with 10 μm FdUrd. Pretreatment of cells with TNFα prior to FdUrd was essential for the TNFα-induced postdrug recovery, since TNFα added to cells 6 h or longer after FdUrd did not have the effect (Fig. 1D). Increased Postdrug Recovery Induced by TNFα Results in Selection of Drug-resistant Cells—The data above indicate that TNFα increases postdrug survival of colo201 and colo320 cells. To test whether surviving colonies are resistant to FdUrd in a TNF-dependent manner, several single colo201 colonies from the TNFα + FdUrd plate were separately grown for 2 weeks and subjected to colony survival assays as described above. TNF-dependent colony survival was on average only 2–3-fold higher for cells that originated from the colonies of the first round of the survival assay relative to those of parental colo201 cells (data not shown). This indicated that only a small number of cells originating from these colonies used the TNFα signal for postdrug survival. Thus, the TNF-dependent postdrug recovery does not seem to be based on a permanent genetic change. Nevertheless, since there was a 2–3-fold increase in TNF-dependent colony survival, we examined whether this trend would continue and whether a population of TNF-dependent drug-resistant cells would emerge. For this, colonies from TNFα + FdUrd-treated plates were pooled, grown for 1–2 weeks, and subjected to another round of colony survival assay. This procedure was repeated for 35 rounds. Indeed, after each round of TNFα + FdUrd treatment and postdrug recovery selection, the number of TNF-dependent colonies increased slowly at first, but it grew exponentially after round 15 (Fig. 2A). To allow a more quantitative colony count, after rounds 10 and 17, the colonies were evaluated after 12 and 9 days postrelease, respectively, as opposed to 3 weeks. After 30 rounds of treatment/recovery, the entire plate was covered with confluent colonies. Representative colony survival plates comparing the TNF-dependent colony survival of the parental (P1) colo201 cells with the cells after 35 rounds (called hereafter p35-colo201) of FdUrd + TNFα treatment and recovery illustrate a large difference (Fig. 2B). It is important to note that even after 35 rounds of treatment/recovery, not the entire population, but more than 30% of p35-colo201 are resistant to FdUrd in a TNF-dependent manner. The data clearly demonstrate that TNFα treatment has selected a conditional drug-resistant cell population. Furthermore, TNF-independent drug-resistant colonies began to emerge as well but with a much slower rate than TNF-dependent colonies (Fig. 2A). Incorporation of FdUrd Is Not Affected by TNFα Treatment— One of the common causes of drug resistance is reduced drug uptake and/or increased drug efflux. To determine whether these mechanisms are at play in TNF-induced resistance to FdUrd, we determined the total incorporation of FdUrd into the p35-colo201 cells in the presence or absence of TNFα at various times as a means for drug uptake and efflux. Cells were incubated with 10 μm [14C]FdUrd in the presence and absence of TNFα. Cells were harvested at various times from 5 min to 24 h (Fig. 3). TNFα treatment did not significantly change the amount of [14C]FdUrd incorporation into cells, indicating that drug uptake and efflux are not altered by TNFα. TNFα Prevents S-phase Entry Specifically in p35-colo201 Cells—The cytotoxicity of purine and pyrimidine nucleotide antimetabolites is associated with the arrest of proliferating cells at S-phase (8Chu E. Johnston P.G. Grem J.L. Takimoto C.H. Van Groeningen C. Chabner B.A. Allegra C.J. Cancer Chemother. Biol. Response Modifiers. 1994; 15: 1-31PubMed Google Scholar). TNFα has been reported to be cytostatic in certain cell lines (13Nalca A. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30517-30523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14Jeoung D.I. Tang B. Sonenberg M. J. Biol.

Benassi M.S. Gamberi G. Ragazzini P. Sollazzo M.R. Molendini L. Magagnoli G. Ferrari C. Maltarello M.C. Picci P. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 14: 1117-1121PubMed Google Scholar). We examined by FACS and [3H]thymidine incorporation whether TNFα alters cell cycle (e.g. prevents S-phase entry) in p35-colo201 cells. TNFα did not cause a detectable change of cell cycle profile in colo201 parental cells after 1, 2, 3, or 4 days of treatment (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, in p35-colo201 cells after 2, 3, and 4 days of treatment, TNFα increased cell cycle arrest at G0-G1 by about 20, 25, and 22%, respectively (Fig. 4A). Concomitant with increased cell populations in G0-G1, the fraction of cells in S-phase decreased in TNF-treated cells (Fig. 4A, p35-colo201 panel). To examine whether the G0-G1 arrest in p35-colo201 is due to cell confluence in culture after 4 days, we cultured the cells with or without TNFα for 4 days, after which TNFα was removed and fresh medium was added. Cell cycle profiles were analyzed at day 4 of TNFα treatment and 1 or 2 days after TNFα was removed (Fig. 4B). The cell cycle profiles show that 4 days of TNFα treatment increased the G0-G1 arrest as before (Fig. 4B). 1 or 2 days after TNF was removed, the G0-G1 fraction of cells decreased concomitant with an increase of S phase cells (Fig. 4B). The untreated cells did not show any cell cycle arrest after 4 days or after 1 or 2 days upon replenishing the culture medium (Fig. 4B). Thus, under the culture conditions we used here, the cell cycle arrest observed in p35-colo201 is mediated by TNFα. To test whether TNFα indeed arrests p35-colo201 before the S-phase, we measured [3H]thymidine incorporation in the presence or absence of TNFα. Untreated cells incorporated increasing amounts of [3H]thymidine into their DNA after 1, 2, 3, and 4 days (Fig. 4C). TNFα treatment strongly reduced [3H]thymidine incorporation to almost basal levels (Fig. 4C). Thus, TNFα prevents a significant number of p35colo201 cells from entering S-phase. To further examine whether TNFα induces G0-G1 arrest in other commonly used cell lines, we compared the effect of TNFα on p35-colo201 with HeLa, COS-7, and HEK293 cells. Again, TNFα caused G0-G1 arrest of p35-colo201 cells, whereas it did not alter cell cycle profile of the other cells (Fig. 4D). TNF-dependent sensitivity of HeLa, COS-7, and HEK293 cells to FdUrd in a survival assay is comparable with parental colo201 cells (data n"
https://openalex.org/W2030494301,"DNA replication origins of eukaryotes lack linear replicator elements but contain short (dT)n (dA)n sequences that could build mutually equivalent unorthodox structures. Here we report that the lamin B2 origin of DNA replication adopts an alternative form characterized by unpaired regions CTTTTTTTTTTCC/GGAAAAAAAAAAG (3900–3912) and CCTTTTTTTTC/GAAAAAAAAGG (4141–4151). Both unpaired regions are resistant to DNase and except in central parts of their homopyrimidine strands are sensitive to single strand-specific chemicals. Interactions that protect central pyrimidines probably stabilize the bubble-like areas. Because DNA fragments containing either one or both bubbles migrate in TBM (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm MgCl2) PAGE even faster than expected from their linear size, interacting regions are expected to belong to the same molecule. In an origin fragment containing a single bubble, free homopyrimidine strand can only interact with Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding surfaces from a complementary double stranded sequence. Indeed, this origin fragment reacts with triplex preferring antibody. In competition binding experiments control double stranded DNA or single stranded (dT)40 do not affect origin-antibody interaction, whereas TAT and GGC triplexes exert competitive effect. Because the chosen fragment does not contain potential GGC forming sequences, these experiments confirm that the lamin B2 origin adopts a structure partly composed of intramolecular TAT triads. DNA replication origins of eukaryotes lack linear replicator elements but contain short (dT)n (dA)n sequences that could build mutually equivalent unorthodox structures. Here we report that the lamin B2 origin of DNA replication adopts an alternative form characterized by unpaired regions CTTTTTTTTTTCC/GGAAAAAAAAAAG (3900–3912) and CCTTTTTTTTC/GAAAAAAAAGG (4141–4151). Both unpaired regions are resistant to DNase and except in central parts of their homopyrimidine strands are sensitive to single strand-specific chemicals. Interactions that protect central pyrimidines probably stabilize the bubble-like areas. Because DNA fragments containing either one or both bubbles migrate in TBM (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm MgCl2) PAGE even faster than expected from their linear size, interacting regions are expected to belong to the same molecule. In an origin fragment containing a single bubble, free homopyrimidine strand can only interact with Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding surfaces from a complementary double stranded sequence. Indeed, this origin fragment reacts with triplex preferring antibody. In competition binding experiments control double stranded DNA or single stranded (dT)40 do not affect origin-antibody interaction, whereas TAT and GGC triplexes exert competitive effect. Because the chosen fragment does not contain potential GGC forming sequences, these experiments confirm that the lamin B2 origin adopts a structure partly composed of intramolecular TAT triads. Eukaryotic origins of DNA replication are sequences derived from fixed chromosomal regions that accommodate one or more DNA replication start sites and direct binding of origin recognition complexes (ORCs). 1The abbreviations used are: ORC, origin recognition complex; DEPC, diethylpyrocarbonate. These regions are typically intergenic, adjacent to transcriptionally active genes, and vary in size from several hundred to several thousand base pairs, which is a consequence of natural divergence and/or of different mapping procedures (1Gilbert D.M.

In some cases, origins colocalize with matrix attachment sites (4Anglana M. Apiou F. Bensimon A. Debatisse M. Cell. 2003; 114: 385-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) or require two functional elements, only one of which serves for initiation, whereas both bind ORC (5Takahashi T.

In addition, DNA replication origins do not share a common consensus sequence but still act as replicators when transferred to another chromosomal location (2Biamonti G. Paixao S. Montecucco A. Peverali F.A. Riva S. Falaschi A. Chromosome Res. 2003; 11: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8Aladjem M.I. Rodewald L.W. Kolman J.L. Wahl G.M.

This important ability demonstrates that elements contained in naked DNA build structural basis for initiation of DNA synthesis. Apart from AT richness, which seems to be the general feature of eukaryotic origins of DNA replication, elements that account for common function are very poorly defined (3Spradling A.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2619-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Seguardo M. Luis A. Antequera F. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 11Eckdahl T.T.

They could include (dT)n (dA)n sequences predominantly distributed in a mirror repeat manner, and as reported, involved in initiator protein binding (5Takahashi T. Ohara E. Nishitani H. Masukata H.

The structural impact of these sequences was not investigated, but numerous other studies confirm that A and T tracts (depending on their distribution and size) could profoundly affect geometry of grooves, bending, and the ability to bend or formation of loops and multistranded structures (19Sinden R.R. DNA Structure and Function. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994Google Scholar). Having this in mind, we have probed the structure and shape of partly overlapping fragments lbo I-(3813–4052) and lbo II-(3871–4187) isolated from the human lamin B2 origin of DNA replication. This origin is very well characterized, accommodates the defined start site of DNA synthesis, binds ORC in living cells and in vitro, and supports the initiation of DNA synthesis at ectopic chromosomal locations (2Biamonti G.

Origin regions implicated in the initiation of DNA synthesis and in protein binding are AT rich and have many T tracts distributed in the upper strand of DNA. To probe the structure and shape of these regions, we have used the agents that interact with different A or T rich elements in alternative forms of DNA. Our combined results show that at neutral pH, low ionic strength, and in the presence of Mg2+ ions, linear fragments of the lamin B2 contain nonhydrogen bonded (dT)n (dA)n tracts that most likely make part of the short triple stranded structures. Chemical Reactions Specific for Single Stranded DNA—For chemical reactions DNA fragments lbo I and -II were amplified from human genomic DNA using CAAAAACGGAGCTGGGCTGCAGCTG, GACATCCGCTTCATTAGGGCAGAGGCC, and TTTTTAAGAAGATGCATGCCTAGCGTGTTC, AGAGTCAGCTTGTGCAACAGCGTCG, respective primer pairs. In each reaction only one primer was 5′-end labeled. The lower or upper labeled strand containing fragments were electrophoretically purified and precipitated. The purity and integrity of isolated DNA fragments were checked by denaturing PAGE, and their sequence was checked by Maxam-Gilbert sequencing. Preparations containing ragged ends were discarded, and the good ones were subjected to further analysis. Chemical reactions were performed essentially as described (24Johnston B.H. Rich A. Cell. 1985; 42: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 25Klysik J. Rippe K. Jovin T.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 7145-7154Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); 100–125 fmol of each labeled fragment were dissolved in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 30 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ZnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), supplied with 10 μg of poly(dIdC)·poly(dIdC), and treated with either OsO4 or diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC). For lower strand modification, treatment was performed 15 min at room temperature in a total volume of 110 μl with 10 μl of DEPC added to the reactions. For upper strand modifications, binding mixtures (24 μl) were supplied with pyridine (2 μl per reaction) and treated with 30 μl of 2% solution of OsO4 for 25 min on ice. After incubation reactions were precipitated and dry pellets were resuspended in pyperidine (150 μl) and incubated for 30 min at 90 °C. DNA fragments were extracted with n-butanol and reprecipitated. Reaction products were analyzed by 6% denaturing gels. Electrophoretic Mobility Assays—DNA fragments prepared as described above were dissolved in buffer A without EDTA, supplied with 50 μm spermine or not, or were dissolved in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 2 mm MgCl2, supplied with either 10% glycerol or 10% ethylene glycol, and were incubated overnight at 25 °C. Reaction mixtures were analyzed by 8% PAGE in 30-cm-long gels prepared and run in either TBE (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA) or TBM (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm MgCl2) buffers. Formation of Intermolecular Triplexes—Short intermolecular triplexes were formed from either (dA)n and (dT)n (n = 34 or n = 40) or (dC)34 and (dG)34 single stranded constituents. To determine the amount of complementary strand necessary for triplex formation, single stranded oligomers were incubated in buffer A without EDTA by mixing 5′-end labeled A or C with increasing amounts of unlabeled complementary strand. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and the products were analyzed by 10% TBM PAGE as essentially described in Ref. 26Kiyama R. Camerini-Otero D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10450-10454Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar. For competition binding experiments triplexes were prepared in the same manner but from unlabeled constituents. Typically, 1 pmol of either single stranded A or C oligomer was incubated with corresponding complementary strand in a total volume of 3 μl. To prepare TAT triplex it was necessary to use either 50- or 100-fold molar excess of single stranded T oligomer. To prepare GGC triplex it was enough to use 10-fold molar excess of single stranded G oligomer. Under these conditions, TAT triplex was contaminated with small amount of double stranded oligomer, whereas GGC seemed fully converted into a triplex. Competition Binding Experiments—To determine the amount of antibody necessary for quantitative interaction with origin DNA, 1–5 fmol of 5′-end labeled lbo I dissolved in buffer A without EDTA was incubated with 1–5 μl of 20-fold diluted mouse polyclonal serum (the preparation and detailed affinity of the serum will be described elsewhere) in a total volume of 8–10 μl. Competition binding experiments were typically performed in buffer A without EDTA using 5 fmol of 5′-end labeled lbo I, 1 μl of serum, and different cold competitors. Respective molar excesses of each competitor over labeled probe were as follows: 100–400-fold of double or triple stranded DNA and 10,000–20,000-fold of single stranded dT oligomer. After the addition of labeled probe reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a total volume of 8 μl. Reaction products were analyzed by electromobility shift assay using 4% TBE PAGE. For competition binding experiments cold lbo I was prepared as described. Nonorigin control was amplified from human genomic DNA using a CCTCAGAACCCAGCTGTGGA and GCCAGCTGGGTGGTGATAGA primer pair and purified by PAGE. Cold double stranded DNA was either preincubated with the antibody for 30 min at room temperature or added together with the labeled probe. Both procedures gave similar results. For competition binding experiments TAT and GGC triplexes were prepared as described. Where indicated, parallel reactions containing corresponding amounts of single and double stranded constituents of TAT triplex were processed in the same manner. For comparison of competitive efficiencies of TAT and GGC triplexes the amount of single stranded DNA in each reaction was made approximately equal by adding 10 pmol of single stranded G oligomer to the TAT mixture and 50 or 100 pmol of single stranded T oligomer to the GGC mixture. In all competition binding experiments with triplex DNA the antibody was first challenged with competitors and then incubated with labeled probe. To check whether the lamin B2 origin adopts a structure that in some respect deviates from canonical form, we have first performed experiments with chemicals that poorly react with B-DNA but recognize unpaired regions usually present in junctions between canonical and noncanonical intramolecular elements or in some multistranded structures. We have chosen two assays, one with OsO4–pyridine and the other with DEPC. DEPC reacts with unpaired purines in single stranded DNA or with purines in syn conformation, as in Z-DNA, and for that reason we have used it for the lower, purine rich strand of the origin. OsO4–pyridine, predominantly reacting with unpaired thymines and partly with unpaired cytosines, was chosen for the upper strand of the origin. Experiments were performed with origin fragment lbo I-(3813–4052), previously shown to encompass the initiation site and regions interacting with ORC in vivo and in vitro. In addition to chemical assays, origin fragment was also subjected to limited hydrolysis using DNase I (Fig. 1); DNase was expected to strongly react with double stranded DNA and to be significantly less reactive with single or multistranded regions if present in the origin (27Blume S.W. Lebowitz J. Zacharias W. Guarcello V. Mayfild C.A. Ebbinghaus S.W. Bates P. Jones Jr., T.J. Vigneswaran N. Miller D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Blume S.W. Gee J.E. Shrestha K. Miller D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1777-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The chemical reaction with OsO4–pyridine was specific for a small fraction of pyrimidines present in the upper strand of lbo I (Fig. 1A); the most reactive was the stretch CTTTTTTTTTTCC, spanning nucleotide positions 3900–3912. The sequence TGCATGCCTAGCGTG (3883–3897) adjacent to the affected pyrimidine tract was also reactive. Weak cleavages of pyrimidines not belonging to T tracts were also detected at positions 3925, 3927, 3937, 3938, 3954, 3956, 3959, and 3961–3964, but none of them matched the intensity of the sequence CTTTTTTTTTTCC, and none of the shorter T tracts was significantly affected (Fig. 1A, lanes 6 and 7). In the lower strand, the region 3900–3912 was also the most reactive one, although adenines complementary to poorly reactive T tracts and purines in the 3883–3897 sequence exhibited some reactivity, too (Fig. 1B). In addition, all T tracts were resistant to DNase, whereas the region 3883–3897 exhibited significant sensitivity. According to the results from Fig. 1, two clearly noncanonical regions at positions 3900–3912 and 3883–3897 were present in lbo I; the latter, composed of alternating purines and pyrimidines, highly sensitive to DNase and only moderately to single strand specific agents, was consistent with noncanonical double stranded structure such as left-handed, Z-DNA (29Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1095-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ho P.S. Ellison M.J. Quigley G.J. Rich A.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9549-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and Z-Hunt algorithm therein). The former region, composed of pyrimidines in the upper and purines in the lower strand and containing the stretch of 10 consecutive T residues, was sensitive to OsO4–pyridine and DEPC but resistant to DNase I, which demonstrated its nonhydrogen bonded, bubble-like nature. In the lamin B2 origin region there was another similar motif, CCTTTTTTTTC, spanning nucleotide positions 4141–4151 (Fig. 2A). Because the motifs CTTTTTTTTTTCC and CCTTTTTTTTC contained two longest T tracts present in the lamin B2 origin region, they were both analyzed with OsO4–pyridine using DNA fragment lbo II-(3871–4187). The analysis confirmed sensitivity of both pyrimidine motifs to single strand specific agent (Fig. 2B); despite frequent occurrence of shorter T tracts in lbo II DNA, only these motifs were significantly affected. The next step was to check whether the occurrence of partly single stranded regions affected migration of lbo I and -II in nondenaturing PAGE. For that purpose DNA was incubated in different buffers, and its purity and integrity after incubation were checked and confirmed by denaturing gels and by chemical sequencing. As expected, lbo I migrated as a single band of 240 bp (Fig. 3). The same fragment was then analyzed by either TBE or TBM nondenaturing PAGE. Both types of gels gave essentially the same results; lbo I migrated faster than expected from its linear size. The effect was more prominent in TBM PAGE, where lbo I, composed of 240 bp, migrated as linear DNA of 200 bp. Similar to that, lbo II, composed of 317 bp, migrated as a linear DNA slightly shorter than 240 bp (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Anomalous electrophoretic migration of lbo II. A, denaturing PAGE; lbo II (lane 1), a 10-bp ladder (lane 2). B, nondenaturing TBM PAGE; lbo II (lanes 1–4) in different buffers and the same as for lbo I in nondenaturing PAGE and a 20-bp ladder (lane 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Faster migration of both DNA fragments could be a consequence of the increased flexibility of their unpaired regions. However, central pyrimidines of the lbo I bubble were partly protected from single strand-specific chemical, whereas their complementary purines were not (Fig. 1B, right panel). This suggested an intramolecular interaction involving single stranded T and probably compensating for the loss of stacking and hydrogen bonding in the bubble. The results of chemical assays identified a single nonhydrogen bonded region within lbo I, which pointed to a complementary double stranded sequence as other interacting element and to a sort of triple stranded DNA as an outcome of this interaction. Because Mg2+ stabilizes triple stranded TAT elements (26Kiyama R. Camerini-Otero D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10450-10454Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), its effect was also consistent with this idea. lbo I elements that could interact with the bubble are other (dT)n (dA)n sequences. Indeed, intramolecular triplexes were previously shown to form between nonadjacent sequences contained in the same linear plasmid and relating to each other as either mirror or glide reflection images (33Hampel K.J. Burkholder G.D. Lee J.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1072-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 34Hampel K.J. Ashley C. Lee J.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5674-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Similar to that, the lbo I bubble could donate its pyrimidine strand for interaction with the purine strand of one of the shorter symmetrical sequences. Because the origin contains more than one potential acceptor, alternative structures containing short double stranded loops could be possible (Fig. 5). To further test the structure of origin DNA we have used mouse polyclonal antibody reacting with triple stranded elements, and this antibody recognized lbo I (Fig. 6A). Origin-antibody reaction was also performed in the presence of control double stranded DNA derived from chromosomal region not involved in initiation of DNA synthesis (35Kumar S. Giacca M. Norio P. Biamonti G. Riva S. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3289-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As presented in Fig. 6B, binding of the antibody to lbo I was not affected by a 100–400-fold molar excess of control DNA, thus confirming the presence of origin element nonexistent in the double stranded control. The antibody was then challenged with triple stranded 40-mer TAT prepared as described under “Materials and Methods” and in Fig. 7A, and incubated with lbo I. As demonstrated in Fig. 7B, preincubation with triple stranded 40-mer significantly impaired the antibody-origin interaction, whereas preincubation with its double or single stranded constituents exhibited less significant effect (Fig. 7B). In addition to TAT triplexes, GGC triplexes were efficient competitors (Fig. 7, C and D), and the antibody could not discriminate between these two structures.Fig. 7Competitive effect of TAT and GGC triplexes. A, formation of TAT triplex using labeled (dA)40 (lanes 1–6) and increasing amounts of unlabeled (dT)40 (lanes 2–6). B, labeled lbo I (lanes 1–5) incubated with the antibody (lanes 2–5) in the presence of TAT triplex (lane 4) or corresponding amounts of its double (lane 3) and single stranded (lane 5) constituents.TAT triplex was prepared as in A (lane 6) but with unlabeled (dA)40 using a 50-fold molar excess of single stranded T over single stranded A and 200-fold molar excess of single stranded A over lbo I. C, formation of GGC triplex using labeled (dC)34 (lanes 1–3) and increasing amounts of unlabeled (dG)34 (lanes 2 and 3). D, lbo I (lanes 1–4) incubated with the antibody (lanes 2–4) in the presence of TAT (lane 3) and GGC (lane 4) triplexes. The GGC triplex was prepared as in C (lane 3) but from unlabeled constituents using a 10-fold molar excess of single stranded G over single stranded C and a 200-fold molar excess of single stranded C over labeled lbo I. The TAT triplex was essentially prepared as in B (lane 4) but using single stranded 34-mers and a 100-fold excess of single stranded T. The amount of unincorporated single stranded oligomer present in each reaction is made equal by adding single stranded G to the TAT reaction or single stranded T to the GGC reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In conclusion, we want to emphasize that in lbo I we detected a single OsO4–pyridine sensitive and DNase resistant stretch of T residues and within that stretch a partly protected portion. Protecting interaction is unlikely to be intermolecular because native PAGE does not reveal significant multimerization, and therefore cannot involve Watson-Crick bonding, because out of the bubble lbo I contains no free Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding surfaces. The antibody reacts well with lbo I but not with its double stranded portion as revealed by competitive inefficiency of double stranded nonorigin DNA and would not react with single stranded T even if fully available, as revealed by competitive inefficiency of excessive amounts of single stranded (dT)40. Consequently, our combined results point to intramolecular triplex as the most likely unorthodox element of origin DNA. Because lbo I contains no potential GGC forming sequences, the triplex ought to be of the TAT type. In this study we have probed the structure of the human lamin B2 origin, focusing on sequence elements common for eukaryotic DNA replication origins in general and using chemical and electrophoretic assays that we considered suitable for analysis of noncircular molecules that are several hundred base pairs long. Importantly, all assays were performed at neutral pH, low or moderate ionic strength, and in the presence of Mg2+ ions, which indicated that observed noncanonical elements could form under physiological conditions. In the lamin B2 origin of DNA replication, noncanonical elements included the bubbles within homopyrimidine/homopurine tracts CTTTTTTTTTTCC/GGAAAAAAAAAAG and CCTTTTTTTTC/GAAAAAAAAGG and one sequence composed of alternating purines and pyrimidines, consistent with Z-DNA. To understand the form that keeps the bubbles open despite the loss of stacking and hydrogen bonding in corresponding DNA fragments, we have performed more detailed analysis using lbo I. As judged by the intensity of cleavage reactions, the bubble element existed in majority of tested molecules, whereas other affected spots indicated a sort of structural polymorphism. Because in TBE and TBM PAGE lbo I generally migrated as single band, polymorphism occurred within one dominant form of the molecule, or less likely, in minor alternative forms undetectable by PAGE. As judged by partial protection of the bubble pyrimidines and by the apparent size of lbo I in TBM PAGE, the dominant form was created by intramolecular interaction of free T residues with nonadjacent (dT)n (dA)n sequences. By studying the results of chemical assays, it was not possible to identify which of 11 short (dT)n (dA)n sequences present in lbo I actually interacted with the bubble. Because of their narrow minor groove, double stranded T tracts were poorly sensitive to DNase I (36Brukner I. Jurukovski V. Savic A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 18: 891-894Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and because of their double stranded nature, poorly sensitive to OsO4-pyridine, as they would be in triplex or duplex structures alike. However, the experiments with triplex preferring antibody strongly suggested that triple stranded TAT regions did form within lbo I. Formation of noncanonical elements within origin DNA is not exceptional. Potential triplex forming sequences were previously detected in viral and cellular DNA replication origins (37Mirkin S.M. Lyamichev V.I. Drushlyak K.N. Dobrynin V.N. Filippov S.A. Frank-Kamentskii M.D. Nature. 1987; 330: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 38Caddle M.S. Lussier R.H. Heintz N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dihydrofolate reductase origin was shown to contain both triplex and Z-DNA (39Bianchi A. Wells R.D. Heintz N.H. Caddle M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21789-21796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Described structures did not include T tracts and were formed in circular molecules at acidic pH. Triplexes independent of super-spiralization were shown previously to form between distant pyrimidine tracts, contained in the same linear plasmid and relating to each other as either mirror or glide reflection images (33Hampel K.J. Burkholder G.D. Lee J.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1072-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 34Hampel K.J. Ashley C. Lee J.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5674-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this structure, the purine strand of accepting tract provided both Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding surfaces, whereas the bubble provided the complementary third strand. To initiate triplex formation, one end of the linear molecule had to pass through a bubble within a donor pyrimidine tract, and its acceptor duplex had to wind around free third strand. The resulting structure was a hydrogen bonded (braided) knot, which did not fall apart even in the absence of Hoogsteen bonding because the reforming duplex prevented the separation of interwound strands (34Hampel K.J. Ashley C. Lee J.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5674-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Triplexes of the same type were also formed between two or more molecules (34Hampel K.J. Ashley C. Lee J.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5674-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which we believe occasionally occurred even with lbo I (a very slowly migrating species is indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 3). However, under conditions of our experiments, the predominant mode of interaction was intramolecular. Because in general, pyrpurpyr triplexes have antiparallel pyrimidine strands, the resulting structure was expected to involve Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding between third and central strand (Figs. 5 and 8). Having such a structure in mind we were surprised by the competitive efficiency of GGC. The same as with TAT, this effect was dependent on a triple helical form and neither alternating nor monotonous GC duplexes exhibited significant competition (data not shown). Because lbo I contains no potential GGC forming sequences, the possibility that it adopted a form of this particular triplex was excluded. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that origin TAT elements have parallel pyrimidine strands (Fig. 8) and pairing schemes that include reverse Hoogsteen bonding (40Dayn A. Samadashwily G.M. Mirkin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11400-11410Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 41Hsieh P. Camerini-Otero C.S. Camerini-Otero R.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1951-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In parallel stranded TAT triplexes third strand phosphates would be placed in a major groove (and not out of it as in triplexes with antiparallel pyrimidine strands), and this would make them more similar to GGC structures. The detailed structure of the origin-based TAT triplex could be biologically relevant, especially if it builds binding sites for the origin recognition complex. In lbo I, the whole region encompassing the bubble participates in interaction with ORC (18Stefanovic D. Stanojcic S. Vindigni A. Ochem A. Falaschi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42737-42743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and it would be interesting to check whether this protein could recognize any specific structural element.

We analyzed a loss-of-function mutation in the Caenorhabditis elegans intracellular receptor DAF-12, a conservative substitution of an arginine to a lysine at position 197 (R197K). Arg197 resides in region similar to a nuclear localization signal, just downstream of the receptor minimal zinc finger DNA binding domain (DBD) core. We found that the R197K, but not mutations of neighboring arginine or lysine residues, dramatically reduced DAF-12 transcriptional regulatory activity in a yeast reporter assay. This reduction in regulatory activity correlated with greatly decreased DNA binding affinity in vitro, suggesting a role for the DAF-12 DBD C-terminal region (dbdC), and specifically for Arg197, in DNA binding. Remarkably, three basic residues immediately contiguous with Arg197 played little role in DNA binding and rather affected nuclear localization; in contrast, Arg197 itself was dispensable for nuclear localization. Thus, DAF-12 dbdC harbors overlapping but separable determinants of DNA binding and nuclear localization in a single small region."
