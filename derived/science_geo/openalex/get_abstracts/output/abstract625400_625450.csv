https://openalex.org/W2902644322,"Computerized electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation plays a critical role in the clinical ECG workflow1. Widely available digital ECG data and the algorithmic paradigm of deep learning2 present an opportunity to substantially improve the accuracy and scalability of automated ECG analysis. However, a comprehensive evaluation of an end-to-end deep learning approach for ECG analysis across a wide variety of diagnostic classes has not been previously reported. Here, we develop a deep neural network (DNN) to classify 12 rhythm classes using 91,232 single-lead ECGs from 53,549 patients who used a single-lead ambulatory ECG monitoring device. When validated against an independent test dataset annotated by a consensus committee of board-certified practicing cardiologists, the DNN achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.97. The average F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of the positive predictive value and sensitivity, for the DNN (0.837) exceeded that of average cardiologists (0.780). With specificity fixed at the average specificity achieved by cardiologists, the sensitivity of the DNN exceeded the average cardiologist sensitivity for all rhythm classes. These findings demonstrate that an end-to-end deep learning approach can classify a broad range of distinct arrhythmias from single-lead ECGs with high diagnostic performance similar to that of cardiologists. If confirmed in clinical settings, this approach could reduce the rate of misdiagnosed computerized ECG interpretations and improve the efficiency of expert human ECG interpretation by accurately triaging or prioritizing the most urgent conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2905067650,"Defective brain hormonal signaling has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), a disorder characterized by synapse and memory failure. Irisin is an exercise-induced myokine released on cleavage of the membrane-bound precursor protein fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), also expressed in the hippocampus. Here we show that FNDC5/irisin levels are reduced in AD hippocampi and cerebrospinal fluid, and in experimental AD models. Knockdown of brain FNDC5/irisin impairs long-term potentiation and novel object recognition memory in mice. Conversely, boosting brain levels of FNDC5/irisin rescues synaptic plasticity and memory in AD mouse models. Peripheral overexpression of FNDC5/irisin rescues memory impairment, whereas blockade of either peripheral or brain FNDC5/irisin attenuates the neuroprotective actions of physical exercise on synaptic plasticity and memory in AD mice. By showing that FNDC5/irisin is an important mediator of the beneficial effects of exercise in AD models, our findings place FNDC5/irisin as a novel agent capable of opposing synapse failure and memory impairment in AD."

https://openalex.org/W3211563941,"Coding variants in the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) are associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We demonstrate that amyloid plaque seeding is increased in the absence of functional Trem2. Increased seeding is accompanied by decreased microglial clustering around newly seeded plaques and reduced plaque-associated apolipoprotein E (ApoE). Reduced ApoE deposition in plaques is also observed in brains of AD patients carrying TREM2 coding variants. Proteomic analyses and microglia depletion experiments revealed microglia as one origin of plaque-associated ApoE. Longitudinal amyloid small animal positron emission tomography demonstrates accelerated amyloidogenesis in Trem2 loss-of-function mutants at early stages, which progressed at a lower rate with aging. These findings suggest that in the absence of functional Trem2, early amyloidogenesis is accelerated due to reduced phagocytic clearance of amyloid seeds despite reduced plaque-associated ApoE. Loss of Trem2 function increases early amyloidogenesis by preventing microglial activation and clustering around amyloid seeds. As a consequence of reduced microglial ApoE production in the absence of Trem2 function, amyloid plaques contain less ApoE."

https://openalex.org/W2906812748,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is thought to emerge during early cortical development. However, the exact developmental stages and associated molecular networks that prime disease propensity are elusive. To profile early neurodevelopmental alterations in ASD with macrocephaly, we monitored subject-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) throughout the recapitulation of cortical development. Our analysis revealed ASD-associated changes in the maturational sequence of early neuron development, involving temporal dysregulation of specific gene networks and morphological growth acceleration. The observed changes tracked back to a pathologically primed stage in neural stem cells (NSCs), reflected by altered chromatin accessibility. Concerted over-representation of network factors in control NSCs was sufficient to trigger ASD-like features, and circumventing the NSC stage by direct conversion of ASD iPSCs into induced neurons abolished ASD-associated phenotypes. Our findings identify heterochronic dynamics of a gene network that, while established earlier in development, contributes to subsequent neurodevelopmental aberrations in ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2906567604,"R-loops are DNA–RNA hybrids enriched at CpG islands (CGIs) that can regulate chromatin states1–8. How R-loops are recognized and interpreted by specific epigenetic readers is unknown. Here we show that GADD45A (growth arrest and DNA damage protein 45A) binds directly to R-loops and mediates local DNA demethylation by recruiting TET1 (ten-eleven translocation 1). Studying the tumor suppressor TCF21 (ref. 9), we find that antisense long noncoding (lncRNA) TARID (TCF21 antisense RNA inducing promoter demethylation) forms an R-loop at the TCF21 promoter. Binding of GADD45A to the R-loop triggers local DNA demethylation and TCF21 expression. TARID transcription, R-loop formation, DNA demethylation, and TCF21 expression proceed sequentially during the cell cycle. Oxidized DNA demethylation intermediates are enriched at genomic R-loops and their levels increase upon RNase H1 depletion. Genomic profiling in embryonic stem cells identifies thousands of R-loop-dependent TET1 binding sites at CGIs. We propose that GADD45A is an epigenetic R-loop reader that recruits the demethylation machinery to promoter CGIs. GADD45A directly binds to R-loops and mediates local DNA demethylation by recruiting TET1. lncRNA-mediated formation of R-loops at the promoter of the tumor suppressor TCF21 triggers GADD45A binding, demethylation and expression."

https://openalex.org/W2906115270,"Bacteria contain an immense untapped trove of novel secondary metabolites in the form of 'silent' biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). These can be identified bioinformatically but are not expressed under normal laboratory growth conditions. Methods to access their products would dramatically expand the pool of bioactive compounds. We report a universal high-throughput method for activating silent BGCs in diverse microorganisms. Our approach relies on elicitor screening to induce the secondary metabolome of a given strain and imaging mass spectrometry to visualize the resulting metabolomes in response to ~500 conditions. Because it does not require challenging genetic, cloning, or culturing procedures, this method can be used with both sequenced and unsequenced bacteria. We demonstrate the power of the approach by applying it to diverse bacteria and report the discovery of nine cryptic metabolites with potentially therapeutic bioactivities, including a new glycopeptide chemotype with potent inhibitory activity against a pathogenic virus."
https://openalex.org/W2907779538,"Massive stars inject mechanical and radiative energy into the surrounding environment, which stirs it up, heats the gas, produces cloud and intercloud phases in the interstellar medium, and disrupts molecular clouds (the birth sites of new stars1,2). Stellar winds, supernova explosions and ionization by ultraviolet photons control the lifetimes of molecular clouds3-7. Theoretical studies predict that momentum injection by radiation should dominate that by stellar winds8, but this has been difficult to assess observationally. Velocity-resolved large-scale images in the fine-structure line of ionized carbon ([C II]) provide an observational diagnostic for the radiative energy input and the dynamics of the interstellar medium around massive stars. Here we report observations of a one-square-degree region (about 7 parsecs in diameter) of Orion molecular core 1-the region nearest to Earth that exhibits massive-star formation-at a resolution of 16 arcseconds (0.03 parsecs) in the [C II] line at 1.9 terahertz (158 micrometres). The results reveal that the stellar wind originating from the massive star θ1 Orionis C has swept up the surrounding material to create a 'bubble' roughly four parsecs in diameter with a 2,600-solar-mass shell, which is expanding at 13 kilometres per second. This finding demonstrates that the mechanical energy from the stellar wind is converted very efficiently into kinetic energy of the shell and causes more disruption of the Orion molecular core 1 than do photo-ionization and evaporation or future supernova explosions."
https://openalex.org/W2907156774,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) metastasis. Here, we found that lncRNA chromatin-associated RNA 10 (CAR10) was upregulated in the tumor tissue of patients with LUAD and enhanced tumor metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, CAR10 induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by directly binding with miR-30 and miR-203 and then regulating the expression of SNAI1 and SNAI2. CAR10 overexpression was positively correlated with a poor prognosis in LUAD patients, whereas overexpression of both CAR10 and SNAI was correlated with even worse clinical outcomes. In conclusion, the CAR10/miR-30/203/SNAI axis is a novel and potential therapeutic target for LUAD."
https://openalex.org/W2907993948,"Background Despite the pervasive use of smartphones among university students, there is still a dearth of research examining the association between smartphone use and psychological well-being among this population. The current study addresses this research gap by investigating the relationship between smartphone use and psychological well-being among university students in Thailand. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted from January to March 2018 among university students aged 18–24 years from the largest university in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The primary outcome was psychological well-being, and was assessed using the Flourishing Scale. Smartphone use, the primary independent variable, was measured by five items which had been adapted from the eight-item Young Diagnostic Questionnaire for Internet Addiction. All scores above the median value were defined as being indicative of excessive smartphone use. Results Out of the 800 respondents, 405 (50.6%) were women. In all, 366 (45.8%) students were categorized as being excessive users of smartphones. Students with excessive use of smartphones had lower scores the psychological well-being than those who did not use smartphone excessively (B = -1.60; P < 0.001). Female students had scores for psychological well-being that were, on average, 1.24 points higher than the scores of male students (P < 0.001). Conclusion This study provides some of the first insights into the negative association between excessive smartphone use and the psychological well-being of university students. Strategies designed to promote healthy smartphone use could positively impact the psychological well-being of students."
https://openalex.org/W2909220016,"The percentage of protesters in contingent valuation surveys is substantial–about 20% across many studies. This paper seeks to clarify the motivations behind protest responses. In addition, the question whether the estimation of willingness to pay (WTP) is more biased by the exclusion or inclusion of protest bids is yet undecided. Methodological improvements are difficult for three reasons: motivations behind protest responses are largely unclear, definitions of protest differ between studies and often only participants who state a zero WTP are asked for their reasons. Our survey on farm animal welfare (n = 1335) provides detailed motivations, two definitions and includes debriefing of all participants for their WTP. We find that protest bids are not a refusal to answer, they are neither irrational nor driven by lack of understanding. Quite the contrary, a large part of participants is directly motivated by moral reasons. Furthermore, protest responses are not coupled to a zero WTP. In our sample, only 8% out of 32% protesting participants had a zero WTP. Only a small fraction of zero bids (0.4%) are true WTP-statements, i.e. respondents were satisfied with the status quo. This finding has important implications for existing WTP-estimates which might be biased. Finally, we provide detailed estimates of the WTP for animal welfare issues by including and excluding different types of protesters and outliers."
https://openalex.org/W2908638809,"Many Canadians experience unequal access to primary care services, despite living in a country with a universal health care system. Health inequalities affect all Canadians but have a much stronger impact on the health of vulnerable populations. Health inequalities are preventable differences in the health status or distribution of health resources as experienced by vulnerable populations. A geospatial approach was applied to examine how closely the distribution of primary care providers (PCPs) in London, Ontario meet the needs of vulnerable populations, including people with low income status, seniors, lone parents, and linguistic minorities. Using enhanced two step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method, an index of geographic access scores for all PCPs and PCPs speaking French, Arabic, and Spanish were separately developed at the dissemination area (DA) level. To analyze how PCPs are distributed, comparative analyses were performed in association with specific vulnerable groups. Geographical accessibility to all PCPs, and PCPs who speak specific minority languages vary considerably across the city of London. Access scores for French- and Arabic-speaking PCPs are found comparatively high (mean = 2.85 and 1.01 respectively) as compared to Spanish-speaking PCPs (mean = 0.47). Additionally, many areas with high proportions of vulnerable populations experience low accessibility. Despite its exploratory nature, this study offers insight into intra-urban distributions of geographical accessibility to primary care resources for vulnerable groups. These findings can facilitate health researchers and policymakers in the development of recommendations to increase levels of accessibility of specific population groups in underserved areas."
https://openalex.org/W2909460930,"Background The reasons for the persistence of risky sexual behaviours among adolescents and young adults in sub-Saharan Africa despite the increasing knowledge about the associated risks continue to attract scholarly debates. Drawing from a cross-sectional study conducted among male and female Nigerian university students, we examined the relationship between family structure, family support and transactional sex. Methods A pre-validated questionnaire was administered to 800 male and female students selected using stratified sampling; however, we performed the analysis on 630 participants who had ever engaged in sex. Transactional sex was operationalised as self-reporting of giving or receiving money, gifts or favour in exchange for sex. We fitted a list-wise logistic regression model to examine the relationship between family structure, family support and transactional sex while controlling for essential covariates. Results Of the 630 participants included in the analysis, 17.9% had given and 23.8% had received money, gift or favour in exchange for sex. Our bivariate analysis shows that individuals from polygamous families had higher odds of reporting that they have ever given (AOR: 1.89; CI: 1.05–3.39) or received (AOR: 1.85; CI: 1.85–3.19) money, gift or favour in exchange for sex; however, the relationship was not statistically significant after controlling for relevant covariates. After controlling for essential covariates, the odds of giving or receiving money, gift or favour in exchange for sex was 56% lower in individuals who received adequate family support compared to those who received no or insufficient family support. Conclusion In conclusion, this paper lends support to the assertion that family structure and family support are protective factors against transactional sex among adolescents and young adults. Future surveys need to include a larger sample in order to explore the effect of single-parent and polygamous family on transactional sex in Nigeria where family formation is changing rapidly."
https://openalex.org/W2909195790,"Objective 
The aim was threefold: 1) expound the independent physiological parameters that drive FFR, 2) elucidate contradictory conclusions between fractional flow reserve (FFR) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), and 3) highlight the need of both FFR and CFR in clinical decision making. Simple explicit theoretical models were supported by coronary data analyzed retrospectively.


Methodology 
FFR was expressed as a function of pressure loss coefficient, aortic pressure and hyperemic coronary microvascular resistance. The FFR-CFR relationship was also demonstrated mathematically and was shown to be exclusively dependent upon the coronary microvascular resistances. The equations were validated in a first series of 199 lesions whose pressures and distal velocities were monitored. A second dataset of 75 lesions with pre- and post-PCI measures of FFR and CFR was also analyzed to investigate the clinical impact of our hemodynamic reasoning.


Results 
Hyperemic coronary microvascular resistance and pressure loss coefficient had comparable impacts (45% and 49%) on FFR. There was a good concordance (y = 0.96 x − 0.02, r2 = 0.97) between measured CFR and CFR predicted by FFR and coronary resistances. In patients with CFR 2 (p < 0.001), whereas it was not (p = 0.94) in patients with CFR < 2 and CFR/FFR < 2.


Conclusion 
The FFR behavior and FFR-CFR relationship are predictable from basic hemodynamics. Conflicting conclusions between FFR and CFR are explained from coronary vascular resistances. As confirmed by our results, FFR and CFR are complementary; they could jointly contribute to better PCI guidance through the CFR-to-FFR ratio in patients with coronary artery disease."
https://openalex.org/W2909531636,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of HIV-1 RNA regulates viral replication and protein expression. The m6A modification is regulated by two groups of cellular proteins named writers and erasers that add or remove m6A, respectively. HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T-cells increases m6A levels of cellular mRNA, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that HIV-1 infection of CD4+ primary T-cells or Jurkat cells significantly increases m6A levels of cellular RNA independently of viral replication. Compared with HIV-1–infected CD4+ T-cells, similar m6A up-regulation was detected in total RNA from HIV-1–infected cells treated with a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor or with heat-inactivated HIV-1. Compared with mock controls, significantly increased m6A levels were detected in total RNA from Jurkat cells infected by single-cycle HIV-1 pseudotyped with an HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein, but not with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G (VSV-G). Overexpression of HIV-1 Env in HEK293T cells did not affect m6A levels of cellular RNA, suggesting that de novo synthesis of Env is not required for m6A up-regulation. Interestingly, treatment of Jurkat cells with recombinant gp120 of HIV-1 Env significantly increased m6A levels of cellular RNA, which was reduced by a gp120-neutralizing antibody. Preincubation of Jurkat cells with a CD4 receptor–neutralizing antibody blocked HIV-1–induced up-regulation of m6A levels in cellular RNA. Moreover, HIV-1 infection or gp120 treatment did not alter the protein expression of m6A writers and erasers in cells.

https://openalex.org/W2907866560,"The probability that a nucleus will absorb a neutron-the neutron capture cross-section-is important to many areas of nuclear science, including stellar nucleosynthesis, reactor performance, nuclear medicine and defence applications. Although neutron capture cross-sections have been measured for most stable nuclei, fewer results exist for radioactive isotopes, and statistical-model predictions typically have large uncertainties1. There are almost no nuclear data for neutron-induced reactions of the radioactive nucleus 88Zr, despite its importance as a diagnostic for nuclear security. Here, by exposing 88Zr to the intense neutron flux of a nuclear reactor, we determine that 88Zr has a thermal neutron capture cross-section of 861,000 ± 69,000 barns (1σ uncertainty), which is five orders of magnitude larger than the theoretically predicted value of 10 barns2. This is the second-largest thermal neutron capture cross-section ever measured and no other cross-section of comparable size has been discovered in the past 70 years. The only other nuclei known to have values greater than 105 barns3-6 are 135Xe (2.6 × 106 barns), a fission product that was first discovered as a poison in early reactors7,8, and 157Gd (2.5 × 105 barns), which is used as a detector material9,10, a burnable reactor poison11 and a potential medical neutron capture therapy agent12. In the case of 88Zr neutron capture, both the target and the product (89Zr) nuclei are radioactive and emit intense γ-rays upon decay, allowing sensitive detection of miniscule quantities of these radionuclides. This result suggests that as additional measurements with radioactive isotopes become feasible with the operation of new nuclear-science facilities, further surprises may be uncovered, with far-reaching implications for our understanding of neutron capture reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2910837626,"Trastuzumab is a successful, rationally designed therapy that provides significant clinical benefit for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer patients. However, about half of individuals with HER2-positive breast cancer do not respond to trastuzumab treatment because of various resistance mechanisms, including but not limited to: 1) shedding of the HER2 extracellular domain, 2) steric hindrance ( e.g., MUC4 and MUC1), 3) parallel pathway activation (this is the general mechanism cited in the quote above), 4) perturbation of downstream signaling events ( e.g., PTEN loss or PIK3CA mutation), and 5) immunologic mechanisms (such as FcR polymorphisms). EPHA5, a receptor tyrosine kinase, has been demonstrated to act as an anticancer agent in several cancer cell types. In this study, deletion of EPHA5 can significantly increase the resistance of HER2-positive breast cancer patients to trastuzumab. To investigate how EPHA5 deficiency induces trastuzumab resistance, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat technology was used to create EPHA5-deficient variants of breast cancer cells. EPHA5 deficiency effectively increases breast cancer stem cell (BCSC)-like properties, including NANOG, CD133+, E-cadherin expression, and the CD44+/CD24-/low phenotype, concomitantly enhancing mammosphere-forming ability. EPHA5 deficiency also caused significant aggrandized tumor malignancy in trastuzumab-sensitive xenografts, coinciding with the up-regulation of BCSC-related markers and intracellular Notch1 and PTEN/AKT signaling pathway activation. These findings highlight that EPHA5 is a potential prognostic marker for the activity of Notch1 and better sensitivity to trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer. Moreover, patients with HER2-positive breast cancers expressing high Notch1 activation and low EPHA5 expression could be the best candidates for anti-Notch1 therapy.-Li, Y., Chu, J., Feng, W., Yang, M., Zhang, Y., Zhang, Y., Qin, Y., Xu, J., Li, J., Vasilatos, S.

https://openalex.org/W2908556939,"Most clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) have inactivation of the von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), resulting in the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor α-subunits (HIF-α) and their downstream targets. HIF-2α expression is particularly high in ccRCC and is associated with increased ccRCC growth and aggressiveness. In the canonical HIF signaling pathway, HIF-prolyl hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) suppresses HIF-2α protein by post-translational hydroxylation under sufficient oxygen availability. Here, using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining, qRT-PCR, and siRNA-mediated gene silencing, we show that unlike in the canonical pathway, PHD3 silencing in ccRCC cells leads to down-regulation of HIF-2α protein and mRNA. Depletion of other PHD family members had no effect on HIF-2α expression, and PHD3 knockdown in non-RCC cells resulted in the expected increase in HIF-2α protein expression. Accordingly, PHD3 knockdown decreased HIF-2α target gene expression in ccRCC cells and expression was restored upon forced HIF-2α expression. The effect of PHD3 depletion was pinpointed to HIF2A mRNA stability. In line with these in vitro results, a strong positive correlation of PHD3 and HIF2A mRNA expression in ccRCC tumors was detected.

https://openalex.org/W2909360425,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that inhibit gene function by suppressing translation of target genes. However, in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), the biological significance of miRNAs is largely unknown, although some miRNAs are known to be prognosis markers. Here, we analyzed 847 miRNAs expressed in 27 PCNSL specimens using microarray profiling and surveyed miRNA signature for prognostic prediction. Of these, 16 miRNAs were expressed in 27 PCNSL specimens at a frequency of 48%. Their variable importance measured by Random forest model revealed miR-192, miR-486, miR-28, miR-52, miR-181b, miR-194, miR-197, miR-93, miR-708, and let-7g as having positive effects; miR-29b-2*, miR-126, and miR-182 as having negative effects; and miR-18a*, miR-425, and miR-30d as neutral. After principal component analysis, the prediction formula for prognosis, consisting of the expression values of the above-mentioned miRNAs, clearly divided Kaplan-Meier survival curves by the calculated Z-score (HR = 6.4566, P = 0.0067). The 16 miRNAs were enriched by gene ontology terms including angiogenesis, cell migration and proliferation, and apoptosis, in addition to signaling pathways including TGF-β/SMAD, Notch, TNF, and MAPKinase. Their target genes included BCL2-related genes, HMGA2 oncogene, and LIN28B cancer stem cell marker. Furthermore, three miRNAs including miR-181b, miR-30d, and miR-93, selected from the 16 miRNAs, also showed comparable results for survival (HR = 8.9342, P = 0.0007), suggestive of a miRNA signature for prognostic prediction in PCNSL. These results indicate that this miRNA signature is useful for prognostic prediction in PCNSL and would help us understand target pathways for therapies in PCNSL."

The present work aimed at evaluating the pro/anti-inflammatory status in the same 2 crewmembers (A, B). Blood circulating (c-)microRNAs (miRs), c-proteasome, c-mitochondrial DNA, and cytokines were assessed by real-time quantitative PCR or ELISA tests. Time series analysis was performed (i.e., before flight and after landing) at 1 and 15 d of recovery (R+1 and R+15, respectively). C-biomarkers were compared with an age-matched control population and with 2-dimensional proteomic analysis of the 2 crewmembers' muscle biopsies. Striking differences were observed between the 2 crewmembers at R+1, in terms of inflamma-miRs (c-miRs-21-5p, -126-3p, and -146a-5p), muscle specific (myo)-miR-206, c-proteasome, and IL-6/leptin, thus making the 2 astronauts dissimilar to each other. Final recovery levels of c-proteasome, c-inflamma-miRs, and c-myo-miR-206 were not reverted to the baseline values in crewmember A. In both crewmembers, myo-miR-206 changed significantly after recovery. Muscle biopsy of astronaut A showed an impressive 80% increase of α-1-antitrypsin, a target of miR-126-3p.

https://openalex.org/W2910663185,"Demonstrative reference is central to human communication. But what influences our choice of demonstrative forms such as “this” and “that” in discourse? Previous literature has mapped the use of such “proximal” and “distal” demonstratives onto spatial properties of referents, such as their distance from the speaker. We investigated whether object semantics, and specifically functional properties of referents, also influence speakers’ choices of either demonstrative form. Over two experiments, we presented English, Danish and Italian speakers with words denoting animate and inanimate objects, differing in size and harmfulness, and asked them to match them with a proximal or a distal demonstrative. Objects that offer more affordances for manipulation (smaller and harmless) elicited significantly more proximal demonstratives. These effects were stronger for inanimate referents, in line with the predictions of sensory-functional views on object semantics. These results suggest that demonstrative use may be partly grounded on manual affordances, and hints at the possibility of using demonstratives as a proxy to investigate the organization of semantic knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W2907185173,The surface current speeds within the Pemba channel were examined using 24 years of drifter data received from the Global Drifter Program. This study aimed to uncover varying surface current in the Pemba Channel in different seasons. The results revealed the Pemba Channel experiences relatively higher median surface current speeds during the southeast (SE) monsoon season compared to the northeast (NE) and inter-monsoon (IN) periods. The strongest current speeds were confined in waters deeper than 200 meters between ~39.4°E and 39.7°E. These results prove that surface currents from the drifters can be used to uncover the patterns of surface circulation even in areas where in-situ measurements are scarce.

https://openalex.org/W2910433060,"Severe dengue cases have been increasingly reported in Thailand, and the under-reporting of acute kidney injury (AKI) in cases of dengue viral infection has become an obstacle in obtaining an accurate description of the true nature and epidemiology of AKI. Because AKI may lead to patient morbidity and mortality, an early diagnosis is important in preventing its onset in dengue patients. This study aimed to determine the prevalence, clinical and laboratory characteristics, and associated factors of AKI among adult dengue patients. This retrospective study reviewed admission data from the medical records of adult dengue patients admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases between January 2012 and November 2017 and stratified these patients into AKI and non-AKI groups using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria (KDIGO). A total of 1,484 patients were included in the study, with 71 categorized into the AKI group. The prevalence of AKI was 4.8%. In the AKI group, the predominant age range was 18-40 years (71.8%), with a female to male ratio of 1:2.7. These patients showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher proportions of altered consciousness, dyspnea, low mean arterial blood pressure, high-grade fever, major bleeding, severe thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, severe transaminitis, coagulopathy, metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, proteinuria, hematuria, and pyuria. Our study established that older age, male sex, diabetes mellitus, obesity, severe dengue, and coexisting bacterial infection were significant associated factors for AKI in dengue by multivariate analysis. A total of 10 (14.1%) patients with AKI received dialysis, among which 9 (12.7%) patients from the AKI group died. Our findings suggest that an awareness of AKI, its early diagnosis, and evaluation of clinical and laboratory characteristics of dengue patients will help clinicians to initiate appropriate therapy for dengue-associated AKI."

Inactive SNARE bundles are reactivated by hexameric N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, vesicle-fusing ATPase (Sec18/NSF)-driven disassembly that enables a new round of membrane fusion. We previously found that phosphatidic acid (PA) binds Sec18 and thereby sequesters it from SNAREs and that PA dephosphorylation dissociates Sec18 from the membrane, allowing it to engage SNARE complexes. We now report that PA also induces conformational changes in Sec18 protomers and that hexameric Sec18 cannot bind PA membranes. Molecular dynamics (MD) analyses revealed that the D1 and D2 domains of Sec18 contain PA-binding sites and that the residues needed for PA binding are masked in hexameric Sec18. Importantly, these simulations also disclosed that a major conformational change occurs in the linker region between the D1 and D2 domains, which is distinct from the conformational changes that occur in hexameric Sec18 during SNARE priming. Together, these findings indicate that PA regulates Sec18 function by altering its architecture and stabilizing membrane-bound Sec18 protomers.

https://openalex.org/W2909260018,"Human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G), a nonclassic HLA class Ib molecule involved in the maintenance of maternal tolerance to semiallogeneic fetal tissues during pregnancy, has emerged as a potential therapeutic target to control allograft rejection. We demonstrate here that the level of soluble HLA-G dimer was higher in a group of 90 patients with a functioning renal allograft compared with 40 patients who rejected (RJ) their transplants. The HLA-G dimer level was not affected by demographic status. One of the potential mechanisms in tissue-organ allograft rejection involves the induction of granzymes and perforin, which are the main effector molecules expressed by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and function to destroy allogeneic transplants. Using genomics and molecular and cellular analyses of cells from T-cell–mediated RJ and nonrejected kidney transplant patients, cells from leukocyte Ig-like receptor B1 (LILRB1) transgenic mice, humanized mice, and genetically engineered HLA-G dimer, we demonstrated a novel mechanism by which HLA-G dimer inhibits activation and cytotoxic capabilities of human CD8+ T cells. This mechanism implicated the down-regulation of Granzyme B expression and the essential involvement of LILRB1. Thus, HLA-G dimer has the potential to be a specific and effective therapy for prevention of allograft rejection and prolongation of graft survival.—Ajith, A., Portik-Dobos, V., Nguyen-Lefebvre, A.

https://openalex.org/W2908806792,"Chlamydia pecorum is responsible for causing ocular infection and disease which can lead to blindness in koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus). Antibiotics are the current treatment for chlamydial infection and disease in koalas, however, they can be detrimental for the koala’s gastrointestinal tract microbiota and in severe cases, can lead to dysbiosis and death. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects provided by a recombinant chlamydial major outer membrane protein (MOMP) vaccine on ocular disease in koalas. Koalas with ocular disease (unilateral or bilateral) were vaccinated and assessed for six weeks, evaluating any changes to the conjunctival tissue and discharge. Samples were collected pre- and post-vaccination to evaluate both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. We further assessed the infecting C. pecorum genotype, host MHC class II alleles and presence of koala retrovirus type (KoRV-B). Our results clearly showed an improvement in the clinical ocular disease state of all seven koalas, post-vaccination. We observed increases in ocular mucosal IgA antibodies to whole C. pecorum elementary bodies, post-vaccination. We found that systemic cell-mediated immune responses to interferon-γ, interleukin-6 and interleukin-17A were not significantly predictive of ocular disease in koalas. Interestingly, one koala did not have as positive a clinical response (in one eye primarily) and this koala was infected with a C. pecorum genotype (E’) that was not used as part of the vaccine formula (MOMP genotypes A, F and G). The predominant MHC class II alleles identified were DAb*19, DAb*21 and DBb*05, with no two koalas identified with the same genetic sequence. Additionally, KoRV-B, which is associated with chlamydial disease outcome, was identified in two (29%) ocular diseased koalas, which still produced vaccine-induced immune responses and clinical ocular improvements post-vaccination. Our findings show promise for the use of a recombinant chlamydial MOMP vaccine for the therapeutic treatment of ocular disease in koalas."
https://openalex.org/W2908892487,"Studies have demonstrated the adverse effects of smoking on the risk of microvascular complications; however, few have also examined the potential mediating effects of glycemic control. Using data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT 1983–1993), we describe the acute and long-term risks of smoking on glycemic control and microvascular complications in a well-characterized cohort of participants with type 1 diabetes. The DCCT recorded self-reported smoking behaviors, glycemic exposure based on HbA1c, and complications status. Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess whether time-dependent measurements of smoking predict HbA1c levels. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess time-dependent smoking exposures as predictors of retinopathy and nephropathy. During a mean of 6.5 years of follow-up, current smokers had consistently higher HbA1c values and were at a higher risk of retinopathy and nephropathy compared with former and never smokers. These risk differences were attenuated after adjusting for HbA1c suggesting that the negative association of smoking on glycemic control is partially responsible for the adverse association of smoking on the risk of complications in type 1 diabetes. These findings support the potential for a beneficial effect of smoking cessation on complications in type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2910664424,"Brain coding strategies are enabled by the balance of synaptic inputs that individual neurons receive as determined by the networks in which they reside. Inhibitory cell types contribute to brain function in distinct ways but recording from specific, inhibitory cell types during behaviour to determine their contributions is highly challenging. In particular, the in vivo activities of vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing interneuron specific 3 (IS3) cells in the hippocampus that only target other inhibitory cells are unknown at present. We perform a massive, computational exploration of possible synaptic inputs to IS3 cells using multi-compartment models and optimized synaptic parameters. We find that asynchronous, in vivo-like states that are sensitive to additional theta-timed inputs (8 Hz) exist when excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances are approximately equally balanced and with low numbers of activated synapses receiving correlated inputs. Specifically, under these balanced conditions, the input resistance is larger with higher mean spike firing rates relative to other activated synaptic conditions investigated. Incoming theta-timed inputs result in strongly increased spectral power relative to baseline. Thus, using a generally applicable computational approach we predict the existence and features of background, balanced states in hippocampal circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2910701981,"Water buffalo mastitis represents a major issue in terms of animal health, cost of therapy, premature culling and decreased milk yeld. The emergence of antibiotic resistance has led to investigate strategies to avoid or reduce antibiotics’ based therapies, in particular during subclinical mastitis. The use of Generally Regarded As Safe bacteria (GRAS) such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus to restore the unbalance in mammary gland microbiota could provide potential corrective measures. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in milk microbiota after the intramammary treatment with inactivated cultures of Lactobacillus rhamnosus of mammary gland quarters naturally affected by subclinical mastitis as compared to antibiotic therapy.A number of 43 quarters affected by subclinical mastitis with no signs of clinical inflammation and aerobic culture positive for pathogens were included in the study. The experimental design was as follows: 11 quarters were treated with antibiotics, 15 with inactivated cultures of Lactobacillus rhmnosus and 17 with PBS as negative control, by means of intrammary injection. Samples were collected at eight time points, pre- (T-29, T-21, T-15, T-7, T0 days) and post- treatment (T1, T2, and T6 days). Microbiological culture and Somatic Cell Count (SCC) were perfomed on all the samples, and microbiota was determined on milk samples collected at T0 and T6 by amplifying the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene by PCR and sequencing using next generation sequencing technique. Treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus elicited a strong chemotactic response, as determined by a significant increase of leukocytes in milk, but did not change the microbiological culture results of the treated quarters. For what concerns the analysis of the microbiota, the treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus induced the modification in relative abundance of some genera such as Pseudomonas and 5-7N15. As expected, antibiotic treatment caused major changes in microbiota structure with an increase of Methylobacterium relative abundance. No changes were detected after PBS treatment. In conclusion, the present findings demonstrated that the in vivo intrammmary treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus has a transient pro-inflammatory activity by increasing SCC and is capable to modify the microbiota of milk after six days from inoculation, albeit slightly, even when the bacterial cultures were heat inactivated. Further studies are necessary to assess the potential use of this GRAS as supportive therapy against mastitis."

DGAT2 is an integral membrane protein that is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and interacts with lipid droplets. Using BioId, a method to detect proximal and interacting proteins, we identified calnexin as a DGAT2-interacting protein. Co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays confirmed this finding. We found that calnexin-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts had reduced intracellular triacylglycerol levels and fewer large lipid droplets (>1.0 μm2 area). Despite the alterations in triacylglycerol metabolism, in vitro DGAT2 activity, localization and protein stability were not affected by the absence of calnexin."

Methods A total of 124 patients who received a TVT-O sling at two centers in 2004 and 2007 were invited for follow-up. The position of the sling on perineal ultrasound was described relative to the bladder neck and the lower margin of the pubic symphysis at rest and on Valsalva. Objective cure was defined as a negative cough stress test at 300 ml. Subjective cure was evaluated with the Kings´ Health Questionnaire (KHQ), Incontinence Outcome Questionnaire (IOQ), Female Sexual Function Index Questionnaire (FSFI) and the Patient Global Impression of Improvement score (PGII). Results 78 of 124 patients (57%) were available for follow-up 10 years after surgery. I Eleven (14%) had undergone reoperation and were excluded. Tapes were visualized in the remaining 67 (54%) women. The subjective and objective cure rates in this sub-cohort were 67% (45/67) and 77% (52/67), respectively. In these 67 women the mean distances from the bladder neck to the proximal edge of the tape (BNTD) during Valsalva maneuver were significantly higher in cured women compared to the not-cured women (11.2 vs. 9.4mm). The distance between tape and urethra (TUD) was significantly lower in cured vs. not cured patients (2.6 vs. 4.1mm). All women with a TUD of >5mm (n = 5) were incontinent. Tape position was not associated with overactive bladder symptoms. Conclusions Tape position near the bladder neck and large distance to the urethra is associated with incontinence 10 years after TVT-O."
https://openalex.org/W2908854572,"This paper presents a method for the identification of the “technology fronts”—core technological solutions—underlying a certain broad technology, and the characterization of their change dynamics. We propose an approach based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model combined with patent data analysis and text mining techniques for the identification and dynamic characterization of the main fronts where actual technological solutions are put into practice. 3D printing technology has been selected to put our method into practice for its market emergence and multidisciplinarity. The results show two highly relevant and specialized fronts strongly related with mechanical design that evolve gradually, in our opinion acting as enabling technologies. On the other side, we detected three fronts undergoing significant changes, namely layer-by-layer multimaterial manufacturing, data processing and stereolithograpy techniques. Laser and electron-beam based technologies take shape in the latter years and show signs of becoming enabling technologies in the future. The technology fronts and data revealed by our method have been convincing to experts and coincident with many technology trends already pointed out in technical reports and scientific literature."
https://openalex.org/W2910683150,"The mammalian lipin 1 phosphatidate phosphatase is a key regulatory enzyme in lipid metabolism. By catalyzing phosphatidate dephosphorylation, which produces diacylglycerol, the enzyme plays a major role in the synthesis of triacylglycerol and membrane phospholipids. The importance of lipin 1 to lipid metabolism is exemplified by cellular defects and lipid-based diseases associated with its loss or overexpression. Phosphorylation of lipin 1 governs whether it is associated with the cytoplasm apart from its substrate or with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane where its enzyme reaction occurs. Lipin 1β is phosphorylated on multiple sites, but less than 10% of them are ascribed to a specific protein kinase. Here, we demonstrate that lipin 1β is a bona fide substrate for casein kinase II (CKII), a protein kinase that is essential to viability and cell cycle progression. Phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphopeptide mapping revealed that lipin 1β is phosphorylated by CKII on multiple serine and threonine residues, with the former being major sites. Mutational analysis of lipin 1β and its peptides indicated that Ser-285 and Ser-287 are both phosphorylated by CKII. Substitutions of Ser-285 and Ser-287 with nonphosphorylatable alanine attenuated the interaction of lipin 1β with 14-3-3β protein, a regulatory hub that facilitates the cytoplasmic localization of phosphorylated lipin 1. These findings advance our understanding of how phosphorylation of lipin 1β phosphatidate phosphatase regulates its interaction with 14-3-3β protein and intracellular localization and uncover a mechanism by which CKII regulates cellular physiology.

https://openalex.org/W2908818336,"Streptococcus pneumoniae displays increased resistance to antibiotic therapy following biofilm formation. A genome-wide search revealed that SP 0320 and SP 0675 (respectively annotated as 5-keto-D-gluconate-5-reductase and glucose dehydrogenase) contain the highest degree of homology to CsgA of Myxococcus xanthus, a signaling factor that promotes cell aggregation and biofilm formation. Single and double SP 0320 and SP 0675 knockout mutants were created in strain BS72; however, no differences were observed in the biofilm-forming phenotypes of mutants compared to the wild type strain. Using the chinchilla model of otitis media and invasive disease, all three mutants exhibited greatly increased virulence compared to the wild type strain (increased pus formation, tympanic membrane rupture, mortality rates). The SP 0320 gene is located in an operon with SP 0317, SP 0318 and SP 0319, which we bioinformatically annotated as being part of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Deletion of SP 0317 also resulted in increased mortality in chinchillas; however, mutations in SP 0318 and SP 0319 did not alter the virulence of bacteria compared to the wild type strain. Complementing the SP 0317, SP 0320 and SP 0675 mutant strains reversed the virulence phenotype. We prepared recombinant SP 0317, SP 0318, SP 0320 and SP 0675 proteins and confirmed their functions. These data reveal that disruption of genes involved in the degradation of ketogluconate, the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, and glucose dehydrogenase significantly increase the virulence of bacteria in vivo; two hypothetical models involving virulence triggered by reduced in carbon-flux through the glycolytic pathways are presented."
https://openalex.org/W2907544225,"The traditional image mosaic result based on SIFT feature points extraction, to some extent, has distortion errors: the larger the input image set, the greater the spliced panoramic distortion. To achieve the goal of creating a high-quality panorama, a new and improved algorithm based on the A-KAZE feature is proposed in this paper. This includes changing the way reference image are selected and putting forward a method for selecting a reference image based on the binary tree model, which takes the input image set as the leaf node set of a binary tree and uses the bottom-up approach to construct a complete binary tree. The root node image of the binary tree is the ultimate panorama obtained by stitching. Compared with the traditional way, the novel method improves the accuracy of feature points detection and enhances the stitching quality of the panorama. Additionally, the improved method proposes an automatic image straightening model to rectify the panorama, which further improves the panoramic distortion. The experimental results show that the proposed method cannot only enhance the efficiency of image stitching processing, but also reduce the panoramic distortion errors and obtain a better quality panoramic result."

However, in this paper we present evidence that shows that even in the United States—where the secret ballot has been in place for generations—doubts about the secrecy of the voting process are surprisingly prevalent. Many say that their cast ballot can be matched to their name or that others could observe their vote choices while they were voting. We find that people who have not previously voted are particularly likely to harbor doubts about the secrecy of voters’ ballots. Those who vote by mail in the privacy of their own homes also feel that others are able to discover their vote choices. Taken together, these findings suggest an important divergence between public perceptions about and the institutional status of the secret ballot in the United States, a divergence that may affect patterns of voting behavior and political participation."
https://openalex.org/W2909149135,"Mitochondrial single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)–binding proteins (mtSSBs) are required for mitochondrial DNA replication and stability and are generally assumed to form homotetramers, and this species is proposed to be the one active for ssDNA binding. However, we recently reported that the mtSSB from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScRim1) forms homotetramers at high protein concentrations, whereas at low protein concentrations, it dissociates into dimers that bind ssDNA with high affinity. In this work, using a combination of analytical ultracentrifugation techniques and DNA binding experiments with fluorescently labeled DNA oligonucleotides, we tested whether the ability of ScRim1 to form dimers is unique among mtSSBs. Although human mtSSBs and those from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Xenopus laevis, and Xenopus tropicalis formed stable homotetramers, the mtSSBs from Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis formed stable homodimers. Moreover, the mtSSBs from Candida nivariensis and Candida castellii formed tetramers at high protein concentrations, whereas at low protein concentrations, they formed dimers, as did ScRim1. Mutational studies revealed that the ability to form either stable tetramers or dimers depended on a complex interplay of more than one amino acid at the dimer–dimer interface and the C-terminal unstructured tail. In conclusion, our findings indicate that mtSSBs can adopt different oligomeric states, ranging from stable tetramers to stable dimers, and suggest that a dimer of mtSSB may be a physiologically relevant species that binds to ssDNA in some yeast species.

https://openalex.org/W2910785742,"Objective The study aimed to explore the characteristics of auditory mismatch response (MMR) in hearing-impaired children on the day when the cochlear implant (CI) was started (power-up) and the speech processor was programmed, and to investigate the effects of wearing hearing aids (HAs) before cochlear implantation on the early stage of postoperative auditory cortex plasticity, providing some demonstrative data for the objective evaluation of postoperative early auditory ability in children who underwent cochlear implantation. Methods The participants were 34 children with profound sensorineural hearing loss, who underwent cochlear implantation. The classical passive Oddball paradigm was adopted, using a pair of vowels which only have different lexical tones. The standard stimulus was /a2/ and the devious stimulus was /a4/. Results 1) On the day of CI activation, the auditory MMR has been elicited in 30 children; the MMR incidence was 88%. 2) We observed both positive and negative auditory MMR waveforms. And logistic regression analysis showed that it was influenced by the age at cochlear implantation. 3) The duration with HA before surgery significantly influenced the MMR latency. The children with longer duration of HA use have much earlier latency of MMR. 4) There was a significant positive correlation between the age at HA use initiation and MMR amplitude. Earlier initial HA use was associated with smaller amplitude. Conclusions MMR in response to Mandarin lexical tone can be recorded in most pediatric patients who had experience with HA on the day of CI power up. MMR is closely associated with the age at cochlear implantation, duration of HA use, and the age at HA use initiation. Hearing-impaired children should wear HA as early as possible and ensure consistent usage."
https://openalex.org/W2951551931,"The Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) is a statistical method for the analysis of samples from random processes. First developed for the analysis of econometric data, the method is here formulated to extract hidden kinetic parameters from measurements of single molecule dwell times. Our method is based on the analysis of cumulants of the measured dwell times. We develop a general form of an objective function whose minimization can return estimates of decay parameters for any number of intermediates directly from the data. We test the performance of our technique using both simulated and experimental data. We also compare the performance of our method to nonlinear least-squares minimization (NL-LSQM), a commonly-used technique for analysis of single molecule dwell times. Our findings indicate that the GMM performs comparably to NL-LSQM over most of the parameter range we explore. It offers some benefits compared with NL-LSQM in that it does not require binning, exhibits slightly lower bias and variance with small sample sizes (N<20), and is somewhat superior in identifying fast decay times with these same low count data sets. Additionally, a comparison with the Classical Method of Moments (CMM) shows that the CMM can fail in many cases, whereas the GMM always returns estimates. Our results show that the GMM can be a useful tool and complements standard approaches to analysis of single molecule dwell times."
https://openalex.org/W2908902660,"Some recent studies suggested that reflux esophagitis is positively correlated with asthma. However, there are debates on this issue. The aim of this study is to clarify the true association between reflux esophagitis and asthma in a large population.Medical records of subjects who received health surveillance checkup between January 2005 and December 2011 were reviewed. Their endoscopic findings, medical history, body mass index, and smoking history were analyzed. Erosive esophagitis was defined as endoscopically detected mucosal break at the Z-line, irrespective of reflux symptom. Information about asthma history was obtained from their questionnaires and medical records.Out of the total 15,999 patients, 986 had erosive esophagitis and 376 had asthma. In this population, erosive esophagitis was inversely related with asthma in univariable analysis (OR, 0.586; 95% CI, 0.342-1.003, p = 0.049). In multivariable analysis, asthma was demonstrated as an independent negative risk factor for erosive esophagitis (OR, 0.472; 95% CI, 0.257-0.869, p = 0.016), under adjustment with age (OR, 1.000; 95% CI, 0.994-1.006, p = 0.977), male sex (OR, 2.092; 95% CI, 1.683-2.601, p < 0.001), body mass index (OR, 1.115; 95% CI, 1.090-1.141, p < 0.001), smoking (OR, 1.584; 95% CI, 1.318-1.902, p < 0.001), and urban residence (OR, 1.363; 95% CI, 1.149-1.616, p < 0.001). Likewise, erosive esophagitis was shown to be an independent negative risk factor for asthma (OR, 0.558; 95% CI, 0.324-0.960, p = 0.035) under adjustment with age (OR, 1.025; 95% CI, 1.015-1.034, p <0.001), male sex (OR, 0.861; 95% CI, 0.691-1.074, p = 0.185), and body mass index (OR, 1.067; 95% CI, 1.030-1.106, p < 0.001) in multivariable analysis.Contrary to previous studies, this large scale data showed inverse association between erosive esophagitis and asthma. Further studies investigating the clear mechanism of this phenomenon are warranted."
