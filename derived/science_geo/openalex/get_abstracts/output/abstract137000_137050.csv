https://openalex.org/W2100359187,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE), a member of the TNF family expressed on activated T-cells, bone marrow stromal cells, and osteoblasts, regulates the function of dendritic cells (DC) and osteoclasts. The TRANCE receptor (TRANCE-R), recently identified as receptor activator of NF-κβ (RANK), activates NF-κB, a transcription factor critical in the differentiation and activation of those cells. In this report we identify the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family of signal transducers as important components of TRANCE-R-mediated NF-κB activation. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments suggested potential interactions between the cytoplasmic tail of TRANCE-R with TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, and TRAF6. Dominant negative forms of TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 and an endogenous inhibitor of TRAF2, TRAF-interacting protein (TRIP), substantially inhibited TRANCE-R-mediated NF-κB activation, suggesting a role of TRAFs in regulating DC and osteoclast function. Overexpression of combinations of TRAF dominant negative proteins revealed competition between TRAF proteins for the TRANCE-R and the possibility of a TRAF-independent NF-κB pathway. Analysis of TRANCE-R deletion mutants suggested that the TRAF2 and TRAF5 interaction sites were restricted to the C-terminal 93 amino acids (C-region). TRAF6 also complexed to the C-region in addition to several regions N-terminal to the TRAF2 and TRAF5 association sites. Furthermore, transfection experiments with TRANCE-R deletion mutants revealed that multiple regions of the TRANCE-R can mediate NF-κB activation.

TRANCE is highly expressed on antigen receptor-activated T-cells and enhances the survival of dendritic cells (DC) probably, in part, by up-regulating Bcl-xL expression, implicating TRANCE in T-cell-DC communication (4Wong B.R.

Furthermore, TRANCE is expressed on osteoblasts/stromal cells stimulated with vitamin D3, prostaglandin E2, IL-11, or glucocorticoids and can induce osteoclast (OCL) differentiation and activation, suggesting that TRANCE is the sought after link between various known regulatory molecules and bone resorption (2Yasuda H.

Members of the TNFR family and the IL-1 receptor associate either directly or indirectly with TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), adaptor proteins that recruit and activate downstream signaling transducers (6Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Generally, TRAFs are characterized by an effector N-terminal RING finger/zinc finger domain and a conserved C-terminal TRAF domain. The TRAF domain is required for hetero- or homotypic interactions with other TRAF proteins, interactions with receptors, and interactions with downstream signal transducers. TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 activate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) by signaling via NF-κB-inducing kinase and IκB kinase-α and -β (7Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D.

Activated NF-κB enters the nucleus and induces the expression of numerous genes including cytokines, adhesion molecules, and anti-apoptotic regulators (12May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Currently, two receptors for TRANCE have been identified. RANK (receptor activator of NF-κB) or TRANCE-R is a TNF receptor family member most closely related to CD40 (1Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. DuBose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar), an important immunomodulatory molecule (13Caux C. Massacrier C. Vanbervliet B.

Although TRANCE-R mRNA is ubiquitously expressed, the expression of TRANCE-R protein appears to be limited to splenic, lymph node, and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (4Wong B.R. Josien R.

The relatively large cytoplasmic tail of TRANCE-R (aa 235–625) does not contain any canonical signaling motifs implying that the signaling machinery may involve adaptor proteins. Indeed, TRANCE-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) can be inhibited in murine thymocytes overexpressing a dominant negative TRAF2 adaptor protein (4Wong B.R. Josien R. Lee S.Y. Sauter B. Li H.L. Steinman R.M. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Osteoprotegerin (OPG/OCIF), a secreted decoy receptor for TRANCE, inhibits TRANCE-mediated osteoclast differentiation (2Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Yamaguchi K. Kinosaki M. Mochizuki S.

Commun. 1998; 247: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). OPG is also a decoy receptor for TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligands (TRAIL) and can neutralize its apoptosis-inducing effects (19Emery J.G. McDonnell P. Burke M.B. Deen K.C. Lyn S. Silverman C. Dul E. Appelbaum E.R. Eichman C. DiPrinzio R. Dodds R.A. James I.E. Rosenberg M. Lee J.C. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14363-14367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar), suggesting that TRANCE is part of a complex cytokine network that coordinates an array of biological processes. The NF-κB family of transcription factors plays an important role in DC and osteoclast function. Dendritic cell development is inhibited in RelB-deficient mice (20Weih F. Carrasco D. Durham S.K. Barton D.S. Rizzo C.A. Ryseck R.P. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Cell. 1995; 80: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) and in bone marrow cultures infected with adenovirus harboring the IκB repressor (21Oyama T. Ran S. Ishida T. Nadaf S. Kerr L. Carbone D.P. Gabrilovich D.I. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1224-1232PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB1 (p50) and NF-κB2 (p52) double knockout mice develop osteopetrosis because of a defect in osteoclast differentiation (22Iotsova V. Caamano J. Loy J. Yang Y. Lewin A. Bravo R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1285-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). In addition, IL-1 enhances OCL survival by activating NF-κB (23Jimi E. Nakamura I. Ikebe T. Akiyama S. Takahashi N. Suda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8799-8805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, discovering the mechanisms leading to NF-κB activation from the TRANCE-R will aid in our understanding of the molecular events involved in DC and osteoclast function. Our results demonstrate that TRANCE-R associates with TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 at distinct regions of the cytoplasmic tail to initiate NF-κB activation. Therefore, TRANCE may direct DC and OCL differentiation and activation through the TRANCE-R by stimulating NF-κB via TRAFs. TRAF5.DN (aa 236–559) and TRAF6.DN (289–522) open reading frames (ORFs) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing a 3′-hemagglutinin (HA) tag. A PCR product encoding TRAF2.DN (241–501) was cloned into pcDNA3.1 containing a 3′-1D4 tag. The HA-TRAF1, TRAF2, HA-TRIP, and HA-hTRADD expression vectors were previously described (24Lee S.Y. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). pBABE/HA-TRAF3 (25Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z.S. Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D. Science. 1995; 267: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Genhong Cheng (UCLA, Los Angeles, CA). FLAG-TRAF5, FLAG-TRAF6, and FLAG-hKi-67 (hKi) expression vectors were constructed by cloning the ORF derived by PCR into the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector (pFLAG-2; Kodak, Rochester, NY). The various TRANCE-R cytoplasmic tails (aa 235–625, 235–603, 235–559, 235–358, 532–625, and 354–536) were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR of murine thymus RNA. The cytoplasmic tails were fused to the 3′ end of GST in pEBG (GST-TRcyt and GST-TRcyt mutants) or the 3′ end of the TRANCE-R extracellular/transmembrane domain (TR-E) in pFLAG-CMV-1 (pFLAG-1; Kodak). The c-Jun (pFA-Jun) and Elk-1 (pFA-Elk1) pathway-specific transactivators, the GAL4 UAS-containing luciferase reporter (pFR-Luc) plasmid, and the MEKK (pFC-MEKK) and MEK1 (pFC-MEK1) expression vectors were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The NF-κB reporter vector (κB)3-interferon-luciferase and pCMV-β-gal plasmids (Invitrogen) were described previously (26Lee S.Y. Kandala G. Liou M.L. Liou H.C. Choi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9699-9703Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). All constructs were made from mouse ORFs unless indicated. ORFs obtained by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. 293T cells were grown under standard conditions (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 37 °C, 5% CO2). One day prior to transfection cells were split into 6-well dishes (4 × 105/well) coated with 0.1% gelatin for luciferase assays or in 10-cm dishes (2 × 106/well) for interaction assays. The various reporter and expression vectors were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (26Lee S.Y. Kandala G. Liou M.L. Liou H.C. Choi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9699-9703Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The amount of transfected DNA was kept constant with pcDNA3.1 plasmid. 24–36 h after transfection, the cells were harvested and subjected to luciferase and β-galactosidase assays as described previously (26Lee S.Y. Kandala G. Liou M.L. Liou H.C. Choi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9699-9703Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Measurements of luciferase were normalized to β-galactosidase activity and expressed as a ratio to values obtained from cells treated with vector alone. 293T cells transfected with GST-TRcyt, GST-TRcyt mutants, or potential interacting proteins were harvested 24–36 h after transfection, treated with lysis buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 300 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), cleared by centrifugation, and mixed together as indicated in the figure legends. After incubation (4 °C, 2 h) the complexes were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose, washed 3–4 times with lysis buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to membranes. Western blot analyses were performed with either α-TRAF2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), α-HA (12CA5), or α-FLAG Ab (M2, Kodak). For coexpression-interaction assays, cells were cotransfected with GST-TRcyt with the various TRAFs. The transfectants were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting using the conditions described above. c-Jun and NF-κB activation by the murine TRANCE-R was examined in 293T cells to determine whether an overexpression system in tumor cell lines could accurately model TRANCE-R signaling. Activation of the ETS domain-containing transcription factor Elk-1 was also examined because it is a substrate for the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK): JNK, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which are often activated by TNFR family members. In addition, Elk-1 regulates the expression of c-Fos, a transcription factor important for osteoclast differentiation (27Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z.Q. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Felix R. Fleisch H.A. Wagner E.F. Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). An epitope-tagged murine TRANCE-R expression vector was cotransfected with luciferase reporter constructs that monitor either c-Jun, Elk-1, or NF-κB transcriptional activity. Fig. 1demonstrates that overexpression of TRANCE-R induced c-Jun (∼3-fold; Fig. 1 A), Elk-1 (∼5-fold; Fig. 1 B), and NF-κB (∼100-fold; Fig. 1 C) when compared with cells transfected with vector alone. As expected a mutant TRANCE-R lacking the cytoplasmic tail (TR-E) failed to activate c-Jun, Elk-1, or NF-κB. MEKK, MEK1, and TRAF2 expression provided positive controls for c-Jun, Elk-1, and NF-κB activation, respectively. A dose-response curve showed that 50 ng of TRANCE-R expression vector was sufficient for achieving maximal NF-κB activation (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to test the association of TRANCE-R with all the known TRAF proteins except for TRAF4, which was shown to be a nuclear protein (28Regnier C.H. Tomasetto C. Moog-Lutz C. Chenard M.P. Wendling C. Basset P. Rio M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25715-25721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The association of TRAF1, TRAF3, TRAF5, and TRAF6 with the cytoplasmic tail of TRANCE-R fused to GST (GST-TRcyt) was observed when coexpressed in 293T cells (data not shown). However, TRAF2 could not be analyzed by coexpression because it prevented high levels of expression of GST-TRcyt for unknown reasons (data not shown). Therefore, lysates from 293T cells overexpressing GST or GST-TRcyt were mixed with lysates from 293T cells overexpressing either TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, TRAF6, human TRADD (hTRADD), or hKi-67 (hKi). GST-TRcyt-interacting protein complexes were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose beads and visualized by Western analysis. Ten percent of the lysates used for each immunoprecipitation were analyzed to confirm the expression of potential TRANCE-R-interacting proteins. TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, and TRAF6 but not hTRADD or hKi associated with GST-TRcyt but did not interact with GST alone (Fig. 2). TRAF1 recruits cellular inhibitors of apoptosis to the receptor complex (29Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar), and overexpression of TRAF1 inhibits T-cell receptor-mediated cell death of CD8+ T-cells (30Speiser D.E. Lee S.Y. Wong B. Arron J. Santana A. Kong Y.Y. Ohashi P.S. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, TRAF1 may partially mediate TRANCE-induced DC survival. TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6, in addition to NF-κB activation, are responsible for JNK induction leading to Jun/Fos activator protein-1 (AP-1) transactivational activity. TRAF6 also stimulates ERK (31Kashiwada M. Shirakata Y. Inoue J.I. Nakano H. Okazaki K. Okumura K. Yamamoto T. Nagaoka H. Takemori T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which phosphorylates and activates a distinct set of transcription factors including c-Myc, Elk-1, C/EBP, Tal-1, and ATF-2. MAPK-induced transcriptional activity may integrate with the NF-κB pathway to mediate the various effects of TRANCE on DC and osteoclasts. The direct evidence implicating NF-κB in DC and OCL development and function prompted a focused examination of its mechanism of activation by TRANCE-R. The requirement of TRAFs for TRANCE-R-mediated NF-κB activation was tested using vectors that encode for the TRAF dominant negative (TRAF.DN) mutants: TRAF2.DN (aa 241–501), TRAF5.DN (aa 236–559) and TRAF6.DN (aa 289–522). These mutants lack the RING and/or zinc finger effector domains and suppress signaling by interacting with the receptor and preventing the activation of specific endogenous TRAF molecules (32Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Coexpression of TRANCE-R with increasing amounts of either TRAF2.DN, TRAF5.DN, or TRAF6.DN resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of NF-κB activation (Fig. 3). However, NF-κB induction was incompletely blocked despite a 20-fold excess of any of the vectors encoding TRAF.DN proteins. TRIP, a TRAF2-interacting protein that inhibits TRAF2-dependent NF-κB activation (24Lee S.Y. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), also decreased NF-κB activation by the TRANCE-R in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, overexpression of an irrelevant protein, human autoimmune antigen Ki-67 (hKi), failed to inhibit TRANCE-R-mediated NF-κB activation, thus indicating the specificity of TRAF.DN and TRIP proteins. Therefore, NF-κB activation induced by the TRANCE-R signaling is, in part, mediated by TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 and can be negatively regulated by TRIP. Deletion mutants of the TRANCE-R cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 4 A) were fused with GST (GST-TR) or with the FLAG-tagged extracellular transmembrane domain of TRANCE-R (TR-E). The design of TRANCE-R cytoplasmic tail deletions was based on PXQE(T/S) or VXX(T/S)XEE TRAF-binding sites determined in other TNFR family members (26Lee S.Y. Kandala G. Liou M.L. Liou H.C. Choi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9699-9703Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 33Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Duckett C.S. Van Dongen J.L. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12852-12858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail was arbitrarily divided into a membrane-proximal N-terminal region (N-region; aa 235–358), a middle region (M-region; aa 359–531), and a C-terminal region (C-region; aa 532–625). Associations between GST-TR mutants and TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 were examined. Lysates from 293T cells overexpressing TRAF proteins were mixed with lysates containing the different GST-TR fusion proteins, and GST-TR/TRAF complexes were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose and analyzed by Western blot. These membranes were also stained with Coomassie brilliant blue to confirm the presence of the GST-TR proteins. TRAF2 associated most strongly with GST-TR-235–625, -235–603, -235–559, and -532–625, weakly with -354–536, but not with -235–358 (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that amino acid residues 532–559 contain the major TRAF2-interacting site. Similar reasoning suggested that residues 559–603 of the C-region were required for TRAF5 binding (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, both TRAF2 and TRAF5 associate with the TRANCE-R at distinct but juxtaposed sites within the C-region. TRAF6 associated with the N-region and M-region containing mutants but less efficiently to the C-region (Fig. 4 B). Thus TRAF6 can associate with multiple sites N-terminal to the C-region. The various transmembrane-anchored cytoplasmic tails were tested for their ability to activate NF-κB. Western blot analysis using the α-FLAG antibody demonstrated comparable levels of expression produced by the various TR-E-cytoplasmic tail constructs (Fig.4C). Fig. 4 D shows that mutants TR-E+235–603 and TR-E+235–559, which lack the C-terminal 22 and 66 aa, respectively, stimulated similar levels of NF-κB activity compared with the wild-type TRANCE-R (TR-E+235–625). In addition, TR-E+235–358, the mutant encompassing the N-terminal region (N-region), and TR-E+354–536, the mutant delimiting the middle region (M-region), also induced relatively high levels of NF-κB activity. Unexpectedly, the C-region mutant, TR-E+532–625, consistently elicited relatively low, yet substantial, NF-κB activity (10–20-fold), whereas the N-region and M-region, which primarily interacted with TRAF6, generated significantly higher levels of NF-κB activity. These results suggest that TRAF6, in addition to TRAF2 and TRAF5, is an important NF-κB-inducing element in the TRANCE-R signaling complex. Combinations of TRAF.DN proteins were coexpressed with TRANCE-R in an attempt to enhance the NF-κB inhibition caused by individual dominant negatives. Expression of TRAF2.DN or TRAF6.DN in combination with TRAF5.DN did not cause a further decrease in TRANCE-R-mediated NF-κB activation compared with any TRAF.DN alone (Fig. 5). However, TRAF2.DN in combination with TRAF6.DN reduced NF-κB activity by an additional ∼50% of the activity observed with TRAF2.DN or TRAF6.DN alone. Addition of TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 dominant negative proteins together did not inhibit NF-κB further than that observed with TRAF2.DN plus TRAF6.DN. Conceivably, TRAF2 may compete with TRAF5 by concealing residues important for its association with the TRANCE-R. TRAF6 may also hinder the association of TRAF5 with the TRANCE-R in a similar manner, although the proximity between the TRAF5 and TRAF6 association sites was not resolved. Residual NF-kB activity (∼10–20-fold induction) could not be inhibited despite coexpression of TRAF2.DN, TRAF5.DN, and TRAF6.DN together. Thus similarly to CD30 (34Horie R. Aizawa S. Nagai M. Ito K. Higashihara M. Ishida T. Inoue J. Watanabe T. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Duckett C.S. Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TRANCE-R may initiate TRAF-independent pathways or interact with unknown TRAFs to activate NF-κB. In this report we demonstrate that TRAF adaptor proteins can associate with the cytoplasmic tail of TRANCE-R and mediate NF-κB activation. During the review of this article a study was published showing associations between the human TRANCE-R and TRAFs (36Darnay B.G. Haridas V. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20551-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). However, in that study, the C-terminal 86 residues (aa 530–616) were shown to be essential for NF-κB activation and TRAF interaction whereas our data define other regions capable of those functions. It is possible that the human receptor has distinct properties compared with the mouse receptor used in this study. More likely, however, the discrepancies reflect the sensitivities of the different methods employed to study protein interactions or NF-kB activation. TRAFs may be responsible for some of the effects of TRANCE on DC and osteoclasts. Perhaps TRAFs via NF-κB and/or MAPKs are linked to the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such asbcl-xL or genes involved in differentiation and activation. The importance of TRAFs in TRANCE-R signaling in DC or OCL will be further explored with TRAF-deficient mutant mice or by overexpressing TRAF.DN proteins in those cells.

A 50% decrease in manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity was observed in mitochondria isolated from Sod2 −/+ mice compared withSod2 +/+ mice, with no change in the activities of either glutathione peroxidase or copper/zinc superoxide dismutase. However, the level of total glutathione was 30% less in liver mitochondria of the Sod2 −/+ mice. The reduction in MnSOD activity in Sod2 −/+ mice was correlated to an increase in oxidative damage to mitochondria: decreased activities of the Fe-S proteins (aconitase and NADH oxidoreductase), increased carbonyl groups in proteins, and increased levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine in mitochondrial DNA. In contrast, there were no significant changes in oxidative damage in the cytosolic proteins or nuclear DNA. The increase in oxidative damage in mitochondria was correlated to altered mitochondrial function. A significant decrease in the respiratory control ratio was observed in mitochondria isolated from Sod2 −/+ mice compared with Sod2 +/+ mice for substrates metabolized by complexes I, II, and III. In addition, mitochondria isolated from Sod2 −/+ mice showed an increased rate of induction of the permeability transition. Therefore, this study provides direct evidence correlating reduced MnSOD activity in vivo to increased oxidative damage in mitochondria and alterations in mitochondrial function.

Under normal physiological conditions, metabolism of oxygen by aerobic organisms generates a wide variety of potentially deleterious reactive oxygen species. These reactive oxygen species initiate a large number of oxidative reactions in cellular systems that lead to the oxidation of macromolecules, e.g. DNA, proteins and lipids (1Pacifici R.E. Davies K.J. Gerontology. 1991; 37: 166-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Over the past decade, numerous investigators have argued that oxidative damage may contribute to a variety of chronic diseases (including emphysema, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) as well as aging (2Gaulton G.M. Markmann J.F. Immunol. Res. 1988; 7: 113-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although it is attractive to speculate that the accumulation of oxidative damage may be involved in the decline of physiological function and increased disease pathogenesis, there is no direct evidence for this concept. Mitochondria are extremely susceptible to oxidative damage because 2–4% of the oxygen consumed by mitochondria is converted to superoxide anions by the electron transport chain (3Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4851) Google Scholar) and because mitochondria have limited protection from oxidative stress (4Wallace D.C. Science. 1992; 256: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Therefore, mitochondria would be predicted to be one of the cellular components especially vulnerable to oxidative damage. Over the past 20 years, investigators have studied the effect of oxidative damage on mitochondrial function by subjecting isolated mitochondria to oxidative stress in vitro. Many functional properties of mitochondria are substantially impaired after exposure in vitro to a variety of reactive oxygen species. These include the inhibition of the complexes in the respiratory chain, especially complex I and ATP synthetase (5Hardy L. Clark J.B. Darley-Usmar V.M. Smith D.R. Stone D. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), decreased adenine nucleotide content, inhibition of the adenine nucleotide translocase (6Duan J. Karmazyn M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 210: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), increased lipid peroxidation (7Zhang Y. Marcillat O. Giulivi C. Ernster L. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16330-16336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mitochondrial swelling (8Takeyama N. Matsuo N. Tanaka T. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear that in vitro studies with isolated mitochondria are an accurate indication of what occurs in vivo. In other words, does the accumulation of oxidative damage under normal physiological conditionsin vivo lead to mitochondrial dysfunction? Transgenic or mutant animals with alterations in the antioxidant defense system provide investigators with a model system that can be used to test the effect of oxidative damage on cellular functionin vivo. For example, two MnSOD1 knockout mouse models have been produced by the disruption of different sections of theSod2 gene (9Li Y. Huang T.-T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Wallace D.C. Epstein C.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar, 10Hillier L. Becker M. Chiapelli B. Chissoe S. Dietrich N.

In both knockout models, the homozygous (Sod2 −/−) mutants exhibited no detectable MnSOD activity in any of the tissues studied. TheSod2 −/− phenotype was lethal in both knockout models. The Sod2 −/− mutants (Sod2<tm1>Cje) produced by Li et al. (9Li Y. Huang T.-T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Wallace D.C. Epstein C.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar) were smaller and paler and exhibited a hypotonic and hypothermic state compared with wild type mice and the heterozygous mice (Sod2 −/+). In addition to their overall gross appearance, the homozygous null mutants appeared to fatigue more rapidly after any type of exertion; however, their behavior was otherwise normal. After 4–5 days, 37% of theSod2 −/− mice died, with nearly all the animals dead by day 10. At death, the Sod2 −/− mice had enlarged hearts with a dilated left ventricular cavity and reduced left ventricular wall thickness, which suggested cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, the liver was increased in size and showed marked steatosis, and lipid deposits were observed in the skeletal muscle. Although these Sod2 −/− mice exhibited extreme damage to the myocardium, these mutants did not show any motor disturbances, central nervous system injury, ultrastructural evidence of mitochondrial injury, or any gross mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) rearrangements. The Sod2 −/− mutants (Sod2<tm1>BCM) produced by Lebovitz et al. (11Lebovitz R.M. Zhang H. Vogel H. Cartwright J. Dionne L. Lu N. Huang S. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9782-9787Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) could not be distinguished from their littermate controls at birth. However, their diminished growth rate became apparent between day 2 and day 7 and continued until death, which usually occurred by 18 days after birth. Although no skeletal abnormalities were observed, they did exhibit reductions in both adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Histological analysis revealed hypocellular bone marrow with marked anemia and atypical patterns of glycogen deposition in hepatocytes. Furthermore, analysis of the brain and spinal cord by electron microscopy revealed that these Sod2 −/− mice demonstrated degenerative injury to large central nervous system neurons, particularly in the basal ganglia and brainstem, characterized by extensive mitochondrial damage, loss of polysomes and clearing of the cytoplasm. In addition, progressive motor disturbances were characterized by weakness, rapid fatigue, and circling behavior. Only 10% of these Sod2 −/− mice died of cardiomyopathy. Electron micrographs of the myocardium revealed swollen and damaged mitochondria, which were not apparent in the mouse model developed by Li et al. (9Li Y. Huang T.-T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Wallace D.C. Epstein C.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). The phenotypic differences between the two types of Sod2 −/− mice have been shown to be attributable to differences in the strain background on which the mutant genes are expressed. For example, Huang et al.(12Huang T.-T. Carlson E.J. Gillespie A.M. Epstein C.J. Age. 1998; 21: 39-40Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) 2T. T. Huang and C. J. Epstein, unpublished data. showed that the phenotypes of the two mutations can be made to resemble one another by changing the genetic backgrounds of the mice. Although the Sod2 −/− mice have been characterized, there is relatively little information on theSod2 −/+ animals. TheSod2 −/+ mice produced by both Li et al. (9Li Y. Huang T.-T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Wallace D.C. Epstein C.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar) and Lebovitz et al. (11Lebovitz R.M. Zhang H. Vogel H. Cartwright J. Dionne L. Lu N. Huang S. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9782-9787Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) appear relatively normal, even though MnSOD activity is reduced in all tissues studied. However, the former animals have been found to develop larger cerebral infarcts when subjected to middle cerebral artery ischemia and reperfusion (13Chan P.H. Epstein C.J. Li Y. Huang T.-T. Carlson E. Murakami K. Mikawa S. Chen S.F. Reola L. Krieglstein J. Pharmacology of Cerebral Ischemia. Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, Germany1996: 573-579Google Scholar). In our present study, we show that theSod2 −/+ mice, which have reduced MnSOD activity, exhibit increased oxidative damage to mitochondrial protein and DNA but no detectable changes in oxidative damage in the cytoplasmic/nuclear compartments of the cell. The increased oxidative damage in the mitochondria is correlated with altered mitochondrial function, including a reduction in mitochondrial respiration and an increase in the rate of induction of the permeability transition. The Sod2 −/+ mice, designatedSod2<tm1>Cje, were originally produced in the CD1 strain of mice (9Li Y. Huang T.-T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Wallace D.C. Epstein C.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar); however, the mice described in this study have been backcrossed to C57Bl/6 mice for 13 generations (B6-Sod2<tm1>Cje). The genotype of theSod2 −/+ mice was determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis of DNA obtained from a 1-cm portion of tail (9Li Y. Huang T.-T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Wallace D.C. Epstein C.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). Female mice were fed ad libitum and maintained under barrier conditions on a 12-h dark/light cycle. At 2–4 months of age, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the livers were immediately excised and placed on ice. All procedures followed the guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX. Mitochondria were isolated according to the method of Johnson and Lardy (14Johnson D. Lardy H. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 94-96Crossref Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 250 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 500 μm EGTA, and 3 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and this suspension was used to measure mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, and the permeability transition. For enzyme assays and Western blots, the mitochondria were resuspended in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. For mitochondrial preparations that were used to measure aconitase activity, 1 mm sodium citrate was added to the buffer to stabilize the [Fe-S] clusters in the enzyme (15Hausladen A. Fridovich I. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 37-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford assay kit. Superoxide dismutase activity was measured using polyacrylamide gels as described by Beauchamp and Fridovich (16Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (10014) Google Scholar). After staining, the gel was photographed, and the photograph was scanned and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Sunnyvale, CA). Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity was measured by the coupled reduction of cumene hydroperoxide and the oxidation of NADPH by glutathione reductase as described by Tappel (17Tappel A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 52: 506-513Crossref Scopus (460) Google Scholar). One unit of activity is defined as 1 μmol of NADPH oxidized/min. The activity of aconitase in the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions was measured by the conversion of citrate to α-ketoglutarate coupled to the reduction of NADP as described by Kennedy et al. (18Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Hausladen and Fridovich (15Hausladen A. Fridovich I. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 37-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aconitase was reactivated by the addition of 0.5 mdithiothreitol and 40 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate to the extract as described by Hausladen and Fridovich (15Hausladen A. Fridovich I. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 37-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One milliunit of aconitase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme necessary to catalyze the formation of 1 nmol of isocitrate/min at 37 °C. Fumarase activity was measured by the conversion of fumarase to l-malate as described by Hill and Bradshaw (19Hill R.L. Bradshaw R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 91-99Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Changes in fumarate concentration were monitored at 250 nm for 5 min at 37 °C. One unit of activity is defined as the production of 1 μmol of fumarate/min. NADH:CoQ reductase activity was determined by measuring the reduction of coenzyme Q1, an ubiquinone analog, by NADH as described by Estornell et al. (20Estornell E. Fato R. Pallotti F. Lenaz G. FEBS J. 1993; 332: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). One unit of activity is defined as the oxidation of 1 μmol of NADH/min. NADH:ferricyanide reductase activity was determined by measuring the reduction of ferricyanide by NADH as described by Ragan (21Ragan C.I. Biochem J. 1976; 154: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One unit of activity is defined as the oxidation of 0.5 μmol of NADH/min. Glutamine synthetase activity in the cytosol of the liver was measured by the conversion ofl-glutamine to γ-glutamyl hydroxylamate as described by Muriana and Relimpio (22Muriana F.J.G. Relimpio A.M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 738-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). One unit of activity is defined as the formation of 1 μmol of γ-glutamyl hydroxylamate/min. The concentration of total glutathione in isolated mitochondria was determined by the rate of formation of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid as described by Anderson (23Anderson M.E. Greenwald R.A. Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 317-323Google Scholar). The mitochondria were incubated with 25 mm succinate to maintain respiratory function for 10 min at 37 °C before the addition of perchloric acid to deproteinize the samples. Oxygen consumption was measured using a Gilson oxygraph equipped with a Clark electrode as described by Estabrook (24Estabrook R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 10: 41-47Crossref Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). Reactions were conducted at 30 °C in a 2-ml chamber containing 1 mg of mitochondrial protein in a respiration buffer (250 mmsucrose, 10 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing the following three substrates: glutamate (1.7 mm) and malate (1.7 mm), succinate (2.5 mm) and rotenone (5 μg/ml), and duroquinol (500 μm). State 3 respiration rates were determined by the addition ADP (200 nm final concentration), and state 4 respiration was measured in the presence of adequate substrate but without added ADP. The respiratory control ratio (RCR) was calculated as the ratio of state 3 to state 4 respiration rates. There were no discernible differences in mitochondrial yield betweenSod2 +/+ and Sod2 −/+mice: 6.2 ± 0.8 mg of mitochondrial protein/liver for theSod2 +/+ mice compared with 6.3 ± 0.8 mg of mitochondrial protein/liver for the Sod2 −/+mice (data expressed as mean ± S.E. for six animals). The antioxidant defense system in isolated liver mitochondria fromSod2 +/+ and Sod2 −/+ mice was characterized by measuring the activities of the two major antioxidant enzymes, MnSOD and GPX, which are localized in the mitochondrial matrix. Fig. 1 shows that MnSOD activity was reduced approximately 50% in liver mitochondria isolated from Sod2 −/+ compared withSod2 +/+ mice. In contrast, the activity of GPX remained unchanged (Fig. 1) and, therefore, did not compensate for the reduced activity of MnSOD in the liver mitochondria of theSod2 −/+ mice. We also measured the CuZnSOD and catalase activities in these mitochondrial preparations. CuZnSOD has been reported to be localized not only in the cytosol, but also in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria (25Peeters-Joris C. Vandevoorde A.M. Baudhuin P. Biochem. J. 1975; 150: 31Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The activity of CuZnSOD was the same for the Sod2 −/+ and Sod2 +/+ mice (Fig. 1). These data are in agreement with the previous report by Li et al. (9Li Y. Huang T.-T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Wallace D.C. Epstein C.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar), in which no difference in CuZnSOD activity was observed in whole liver homogenates in these mice. There was no detectable catalase activity in the mitochondrial extracts from either theSod2 +/+ or Sod2 −/+ mice. This was not unexpected because catalase has been reported to be localized in the cytosol, specifically the perixosomes (26Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Clarendon Press, Oxford1995: 86-187Google Scholar). We also measured total glutathione levels in isolated mitochondria because glutathione can act directly as an antioxidant or as a substrate for GPX. Only 10–15% of the total cellular glutathione is found inside the mitochondrial matrix (27Fernandez-Checa J.C. Kaplowitz N. Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Miranda M. Mari M. Ardite E. Morales A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G7-G17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, it was only possible to measure total glutathione levels in the mitochondrial extracts. The data in Fig. 1 show that total glutathione levels were decreased approximately 30% in mitochondria from theSod2 −/+ mice compared with mitochondria fromSod2 +/+ mice. This decrease could be of significance because the mitochondrial glutathione pool appears to be extremely important physiologically in protecting cells from oxidative stress. For example, Garcia-Ruiz et al. (28Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Morales A. Kaplowitz N. Fernandez-Checa J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 825-834PubMed Google Scholar) recently showed that a decrease in the mitochondrial pool of glutathione (with the cytosolic glutathione pool intact) rendered cells more vulnerable to the endogenous oxidative stress induced by antimycin A compared with the situation when only the cytosolic glutathione pool was decreased. Because MnSOD is a key component of the antioxidant defense system, we determined if the reduction in MnSOD activity in the mitochondria of the Sod2 −/+mice was correlated to a change in oxidative damage. We measured the activity of aconitase because it has been reported to be a sensitive measure of tissue/cellular levels of superoxide anions (29Gardner P.R. Nguyen D.H. White C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12248-12252Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Aconitase is an iron-sulfur protein that is inactivated by superoxide anions (29Gardner P.R. Nguyen D.H. White C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12248-12252Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), which oxidizes the [4Fe-4S] cluster and leads to a loss of an iron ion (30Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Aconitase inactivated by superoxide anions can be reactivated by the addition of a reducing agent and iron (15Hausladen A. Fridovich I. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 37-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that the mitochondrial aconitase activity is reduced 30% in mitochondrial extracts from the livers of Sod2 −/+ mice compared withSod2 +/+ mice. However, the Western blot in Fig. 2 shows that levels of aconitase protein in the mitochondrial extracts from the Sod2 −/+ and Sod2 +/+ were similar; therefore, the decrease in aconitase activity was not due to reduced levels of the protein. The data in Fig. 2 also show that reactivation of aconitase by the addition of iron and dithiothreitol resulted in an increase in the mitochondrial aconitase activity in the Sod2 −/+ mice to a level equal to that measured in the Sod2 +/+mice. Therefore, the decrease in aconitase activity in the liver mitochondria of the Sod2 −/+ mice appears to be the result of inactivation by superoxide anions. In other words, superoxide anion levels in the mitochondria of theSod2 −/+ mice appear to be higher than the levels in the mitochondria of the Sod2 +/+ mice. Previously, Li et al. (9Li Y. Huang T.-T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Wallace D.C. Epstein C.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar) reported no difference in the total aconitase activity in the liver homogenates fromSod2 −/+ and Sod2 +/+mice; however, it is possible that they failed to detect changes in aconitase activity because they measured total rather than mitochondrial aconitase activity. There are approximately equal activities of the mitochondrial and cytosolic aconitase in liver (31Koen A. Goodman M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 191: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We also measured the activity of NADH oxidoreductase (complex I) in mitochondrial extracts because the [Fe-S] clusters in the complexes are sensitive to oxidative inactivation (21Ragan C.I. Biochem J. 1976; 154: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32Moreadith R.W. Batshaw M.L. Ohnishi T. Kerr D. Knox B. Jackson D. Hruban R. Olson J. Reyafarje B. Lehninger A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 685-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). NADH oxidoreductase activity was measured by two assays that employ different terminal electron acceptors: ferricyanide and coenzyme Q (Table I). Coenzyme Q, a ubiquinone analog, accepts electrons from the [Fe-S] clusters of complex I; these clusters are sensitive to oxidative inactivation. The activity of NADH oxidoreductase using coenzyme Q as the substrate was significantly lower (30%) in the mitochondria isolated from the livers of theSod2 −/+ mice compared withSod2 +/+ mice (Table I). To determine if the loss in activity was due to inactivation of the [Fe-S] clusters, we also measured the NADH oxidoreductase activity using ferricyanide as the substrate. Ferricyanide is an artificial electron acceptor that accepts electrons directly from the reduced flavin mononucleotide and by-passes the [Fe-S] clusters of complex I (33Singer, T. P. (1974) Methods Biochem. Anal.123–175Google Scholar). Using ferricyanide as the terminal electron acceptor, no difference in the activities of NADH oxidoreductase was observed for mitochondria isolated from the livers of Sod2 −/+ and Sod2 +/+mice (Table I). Therefore, the decrease in NADH oxidoreductase activity appears to be due to oxidation of the [Fe-S] clusters.Table IThe activities of mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes in the liver of Sod2+/+ and Sod2−/+ miceSod2+/+Sod2−/+Mitochondrial enzymes NADH oxidoreductase1-aMilliunits/mg of mitochondrial protein.NADH:coenzyme Q309.6 ± 25.7216.1 ± 9.8*NADH:ferricyanide626.9 ± 118.7626.9 ± 121.7 Fumarase1-aMilliunits/mg of mitochondrial protein.161.5 ± 13.8184.2 ± 20.2Cytosolic enzymes Aconitase1-aMilliunits/mg of mitochondrial protein.38.3 ± 2.338.8 ± 2.0 Glutamine synthetase1-bUnits/mg of mitochondrial protein.52.5 ± 5.454.2 ± 7.1All values represent the mean ± S.E. of six to nine animals. *,p < 0.01 by paired Student's t test.1-a Milliunits/mg of mitochondrial protein.1-b Units/mg of mitochondrial protein. Open table in a new tab All values represent the mean ± S.E. of six to nine animals. *,p < 0.01 by paired Student's t test. We also measured the activities of fumarase in the mitochondrial extracts as a control because fumarase is not iron-dependent (34Woods S.A. Schwartzbach S.D. Guest J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and it is insensitive to oxidative inactivation (35Patel M. Day B.J. Crapo J.D. Fridovich I. McNamara J.O. Neuron. 1996; 16: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The data in Table I show that fumarase activity was the same in the mitochondrial preparations from theSod2 −/+ and Sod2 +/+ mice even though aconitase and NADH oxidoreductase activities were significantly reduced in the Sod2 −/+ mice. We also measured the activities of aconitase and glutamine synthetase in the cytosolic extracts isolated from the livers of theSod2 −/+ and Sod2 +/+mice. The mitochondrial and cytosolic aconitase are encoded by two different genes; however, the [4Fe-4S] structure is conserved, and cytosolic aconitase is sensitive to oxidative inactivation by superoxide anions (36Liochev S.I. Free Radical Res. 1996; 25: 369-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Glutamine synthetase is a cytosolic enzyme that has been shown to be sensitive to oxidative inactivation (37Kates J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1970; 35: 743-752Crossref Google Scholar, 38Hill B.T. Whelan R.D.H. Gerontology. 1978; 24: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) because a single histidine residue has been oxidized producing a carbonyl group (39Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11828-11833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data in Table I show no difference in the activity of either enzyme in the cytosol of theSod2 +/+ or Sod2 −/+mice. To further characterize the level of protein oxidation in the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions of the liver fromSod2 +/+ and Sod2 −/+mice, we measured the levels of carbonyl groups in specific proteins by Western blot analysis using an antibody that detects 2,4-dinitrophyenyl adducts (40Keller R.J. Halmes N.C. Hinson J.A. Pumford N.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 430-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Carbonyl groups (aldehydes and ketones) are formed in the amino side chains of proteins by metal catalyzed oxidation and are standard markers of protein oxidation (41Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). The Western blot in Fig. 3 shows that more carbonyl groups were present in mitochondrial extracts from theSod2 −/+ mice compared with extracts from theSod2 +/+ mice. This difference was not due to differences in protein levels as shown in the Coomassie Blue stain in Fig. 3 B. In contrast to mitochondrial proteins, cytosolic protein extracts contain similar levels of carbonyl groups in theSod2 −/+ and Sod2 +/+mice. To ensure that the antibody specifically detected carbonyl groups, a derivatization control was included in which no 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine was added to the extracts. This resulted in a loss of binding of the antibody in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial extracts. We also compared levels of oxidative damage in the livers of theSod2 −/+ and Sod2 +/+ mice by measuring the levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in mtDNA and nuclear DNA. The data in Fig. 4 show that the level of 8-OHdG in mtDNA from the livers of theSod2 −/+ mice was significantly higher (30%) than that found in mtDNA from the Sod2 +/+ mice. In contrast, the levels of 8-OHdG in nuclear DNA were similar in theSod2 −/+ and Sod2 +/+mice. Because mitochondria from theSod2 −/+ mice showed higher levels of oxidative damage, we compared the function of mitochondria isolated from the livers of Sod2 −/+ and Sod2 +/+ mice. The rates of state 3 and state 4 respiration and the RCR were measured because they are measurements of the efficiency of the movement of electrons along the electron transport chain and the coupling of this movement to the production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation (24Estabrook R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 10: 41-47Crossref Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption of isolated mitochondria was measured using substrates that are metabolized through different complexes in the electron transport chain, and Table II shows the rates of state 3 and state 4 respiration with the three substrates. The RCR was significantly lower for mitochondria isolated from Sod2 −/+ mice for all three substrates. The decrease in RCR was greatest (29 and 33%) for the substrates glutamate/malate and duroquinol, which are metabolized through complexes I and III, respectively. This is not surprising because these two complexes have been reported to be more sensitive to oxidative damage for the following reasons: (a) they contain [Fe-S] clusters that are sensitive to oxidative stress (42Beyer R.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 390-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), (b) they are the major sites for the production of reactive oxygen species (43Cadenas E. Boveris A. Ragan C.I. Stoppani A.O.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), and (c) cardiolipin, which is an essential for the biological activities of these complexes, is sensitive to peroxidation by reactive oxygen species (44Veitch K. Hombroeckx A. Caucheteux D. Pouleur H. Hue L. Biochem J. 1992; 281: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The respiration data with glutamate/malate are also consistent with our data in Table II, which showed that the activity of NADH oxidoreductase with coenzyme Q as a substrate was reduced approximately 30%.Table IIOxygen utilization in mitochondria isolated from the livers of Sod2+/+ and Sod2−/+ miceSubstrateState 32-anmol O2/min/mg protein.State 42-anmol O2/min/mg protein.RCRGlutamate/malate Sod2 +/+30.7 ± 3.06.5 ± 0.85.1 ± 0.5 Sod2 −/+22.7 ± 3.96.8 ± 0.93.4 ± 0.5**Succinate Sod2 +/+39.2 ± 5.714.8 ± 2.02.6 ± 0.1 Sod2 −/+29.9 ± 3.914.2 ± 1.92.2 ± 0.1**Duroquinol Sod2 +/+57.0 ± 10.218.7 ± 3.03.1 ± 0.3 Sod2 −/+32.2 ± 8.3*16.5 ± 5.52.2 ± 0.2*Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of six different experiments, in which mitochondria were pooled from two animals per experiment. *, P < 0.05 by paired Student'st test. **, P < 0.01 by paired Student'st test.2-a nmol O2/min/mg protein.

The decrease in the RCR appears to be due to a decrease in state 3 respiration. The data in Table II show a significant decrease (44%) in state 3 respiration with duroquinol as a substrate in theSod2 −/+ mice compared with theSod2 +/+ mice. The substrates succinate and glutamate/malate did not show a statistical significant decrease in state 3 respiration in the Sod2 +/+ mice; however, the decrease in state 3 respiration with glutamate/malate as a substrate approached statistical significance with a P value of 0.06. The rates of state 4 respiration are essentially identical in the mitochondria isolated from Sod2 −/+ and Sod2 +/+ mice, which suggests there was no disruption in membrane integrity in the inner mitochondrial membrane of the Sod2 −/+ mice (45Hansford R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 726: 41-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This observation was further substantiated when we measured the membrane potential of mitochondria isolated from Sod2 −/+ and Sod2 +/+ mice using safranine O as described by Akerman and Wikstrom (46Akerman K.E.O. Wikstrom M.K.F. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The membrane potentials for mitochondria isolated from the livers of Sod2 −/+ and Sod2 +/+ mice were −173.74 ± 15.61 mV and −167.30 ± 23.93 mV, respectively (data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. from six experiments pooling mitochondria from two livers for each experiment). Mitochondria isolated from the Sod2 −/+ mice also showed altered function with respect to the induction of the permeability transition. The permeability transition occurs through a proteinaceous pore, whose opening is induced by calcium and oxidative stress, such as t-butylhydroperoxide (47Zoratti M. Szabo J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). The induction of the mitochondria permeability transition pore is characterized by a sudden increase in the permeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane to small ions and molecules (calcium and glutathione) that can lead to a complete collapse of the membrane potential and swelling of the matrix. Fig. 5 A shows that mitochondria isolated from the livers of Sod2 −/+ mice undergo more rapid swelling in the presence of calcium and t-butylhydroperoxide based upon the decrease in relative absorbance. To ensure that the increased rate of mitochondrial swelling was due to the induction of the permeability transition, cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the permeability transition pore (42Beyer R.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 390-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), was added to the reactions. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the addition of cyclosporin A inhibited the decrease in absorbance, indicating that the changes in absorbance were due to the induction of the permeability transition pore. Fig. 5 shows that the rate of induction (calculated as t 1/2 in seconds) of the permeability transition by calcium was higher for mitochondria isolated from the livers of Sod2 −/+ mice. However, this increase was not statistically significant. Addition of botht-butylhydroperoxide and calcium increased the rate of induction of the permeability transition for mitochondria isolated from both the Sod2 +/+ and Sod2 −/+ mice. The data in Fig. 5 show that the rate of induction of the permeability transition was significantly higher (38%) for mitochondria isolated from theSod2 −/+ mice compared withSod2 +/+ mice in the presence of calcium and t-butylhydroperoxide. The more rapid induction of the mitochondrial transition pore in the Sod2 −/+mice potentially could be serious physiologically because it could lead to the loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity. Once mitochondria can no longer maintain a proton-motive force, they are unable to generate ATP. In summary, our data provides more direct and detailed evidence that the decrease in MnSOD activity in liver mitochondria of Sod2 −/+ mice is physiologically important. We found that superoxide anion levels were increased in the mitochondria from Sod2 −/+ mice as measured by a loss of aconitase activity. The increased levels of superoxide anions would be predicted to lead to increased oxidative damage, and we have presented several lines of evidence showing that mitochondria fromSod2 −/+ mice experience greater oxidative stress/damage. Glutathione levels are reduced, NADH oxidoreductase activity is reduced, carbonyl groups in mitochondrial proteins are increased, 8-OHdG levels in mtDNA are increased, and the induction of the permeability transition is increased. Interestingly, we were unable to detect any evidence for changes in oxidative stress/damage in the cytosol and nuclei of liver from the Sod2 −/+mice. Oxidation of cytosolic proteins (glutamine synthetase activity and carbonyl groups) and nuclear DNA (8-OHdG) are similar in theSod2 −/+ and Sod2 +/+mice. Thus, it appears that the physiological impact of the mutation in the Sod2 −/+ mice is limited to the mitochondria, which is further evidence for MnSOD playing a critical role in the first line of defense against superoxide anions that are produced during normal aerobic respiration in mitochondria. One of the major observations from our study was that the function of mitochondria from the Sod2 −/+ mice was compromised. Mitochondria isolated from the livers of Sod2 −/+ mice showed reduced respiratory control ratios with substrates that are metabolized by complexes I, II, and III. In other words, it appears that the coupling of oxygen consumption to ATP production is less efficient for liver mitochondria fromSod2 −/+ mice. Thus, we have strong in vivo evidence that increased oxidative damage leads to reduced mitochondrial function. Our data in vivo are consistent with the data that has been obtained in vitro over the past 20 years showing that mitochondrial function is substantially impaired when mitochondria are exposed to oxidative stress (5Hardy L. Clark J.B. Darley-Usmar V.M. Smith D.R. Stone D. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We express our gratitude to Drs.

https://openalex.org/W1998232305,"The mechanisms through which heregulin (HRG) regulates the activities of breast cancer cells are currently unknown. We demonstrate that HRG stimulation of noninvasive breast cancer cells enhanced the conversion of globular to filamentous actin and the formation of membrane ruffles, stress fibers, filopodia, and lamellipodia and accompanied by increased cell migration. In addition, HRG triggered a rapid stimulation of p21-activated kinase1 (PAK1) activity and its redistribution into the leading edges of motile cells. The HRG-induced stimulation of PAK1 kinase activity followed phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3 kinase) activation. Inhibition of PI-3 kinase activity blocked the activation of PAK1 kinase and also blocked cell migration in response to HRG. Furthermore, direct inhibition of PAK1 functions by the dominant-negative mutant suppressed the capacity of HRG to reorganize actin cytoskeleon structures. We also demonstrated that HRG stimulation promoted physical interactions between PAK1, actin, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptors, and these interactions were dependent on the activation of PI-3 kinase. The blockade of HER2 receptor by an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody resulted in the inhibition of HRG-mediated stimulation of PI-3 kinase/PAK pathway and also the formation of motile actin cytoskeleton structures but not extracellular signal-regulated kinases. These findings suggest a role of PI-3 kinase/PAK1-dependent reorganization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton in HRG-mediated increased cell migration, and these changes may have significant consequences leading to enhanced invasion by breast cancer cells.

Proto-oncogenes are a group of normal genes that play important roles in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and viability. Abnormalities in the expression, structure, or activity of proto-oncogene products contribute to the development and maintenance of the malignant phenotype. For example, HER21 (also known as c-erbB2 or c-neu) encodes a 185-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (1Stern D.F. Heffernan P.A. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1729-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) that has been shown to be overexpressed, amplified, or both, in a number of human malignancies, including breast cancer (2Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A. McGuire W.L. Science. 1987; 235: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (9910) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the HER2 receptor is associated with increased progression and metastasis, an aggressive clinical course, and decreased disease-free survival in human breast cancer (3Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G. Keith D.E. Levin W.J. Stuart S.G. Udove J. Ullrich A. Science. 1989; 244: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (6247) Google Scholar, 4Muss H.B. Thor A.D.

Recently, two additional members, HER3 and HER4, have been added to the human EGF receptor (HER) family. All of these receptors share sequence homology with the tyrosine kinase domain of HER1 (5Plowman G.D. Culouscou J.M. Whitney G.S. Green J.M. Carlton G.W. Foy L. Neubauer M.G. Shoyab M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1746-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Overexpression of some growth factor receptors has been shown to induce transformed properties in recipient cells (6Heidaran M.A. Fleming T.P. Bottaro D.P. Bell G.I. DiFiore P.P. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1265-1270PubMed Google Scholar), possibly because of excessive activation of signal transduction pathways. The regulation of HER family members is complex, as they can be transactivated by heterodimeric interaction between two HER members and thus can utilize multiple pathways to execute their biological functions (7Alroy L. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 8Hynes N.C. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). For example, HER3 and HER4 receptors bind to more than a dozen isoforms of the heregulins (HRGs) or neu differentiation factors (9Peles E. Bacus S.S. Koski R.A. Lu H.S. Wen D. Ogden S.G. Levy R.B. Yarden Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 205-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 10Wen D. Peles E. Cupples R. Suggs S.V. Bacus S.S. Luo Y. Trail G. Hu S. Silbiger S.M. Levy R.B. Cell. 1992; 69: 559-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), and they can activate the HER2 receptor as a result of HER2/HER3 or HER2/HER4 heterodimeric interactions (7Alroy L. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 8Hynes N.C. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). A ligand that interacts with HER2 in the absence of other HER family members has yet to be identified. Although the significance of HER2 in breast cancer is well established, the mechanism involved remains poorly understood. It has been proposed that this may involve constitutive activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity due to either mutations in the HER2 gene, overexpression, and/or transactivation via receptor-dimerization with other HER members. HER3 is unique among HER family members, as it has an impaired tyrosine kinase domain due to substitution of three amino acids in the kinase domain (11Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway III, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Despite the kinase dead nature of HER3, HRG binding to HER3 leads to increased HER3 tyrosine phosphorylation, probably due to formation of a high-affinity co-receptor complex through heterodimeric interaction with HER2 (12Horan T. Wen J. Arakawa T. Liu N. Brankow D. Hu S. Ratzkin B. Philo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24604-24608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is believed that among the HER family, the HER2/HER3 dimer complex elicits the most potent mitogenic signal (7Alroy L. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). This may be related to the fact that the COOH-terminal phosphorylation domain of HER3 contains several consensus sites for the binding of signal-transducing proteins implicated in mitogenic signaling, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). HRG stimulation of breast cancer cells enhances activation of PI 3-kinase and MAP-kinases (13Marte B.M. Meyers T. Stabel S. Standke G.J. Jaken S. Fabbro D. Hynes N.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 239-247PubMed Google Scholar, 14Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1997; 15: 2452-2467Crossref Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Despite the widely acknowledged role of the HER2/heregulin pathway in breast cancer progression, the signaling pathway(s) involved remains elusive. The exposure of cells to growth factors has been shown to cause cytoskeleton reorganization, formation of lamellipodia, membrane ruffling, and altered cell morphology, and accordingly, it has been implicated in stimulating cell migration and invasion (15Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar, 16Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). Most eukaryotic cells possess the capacity to move over or through a substrate, and cell migration plays a key role in both normal physiology and diseases, including invasion and metastasis (17Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3274) Google Scholar). In many tissues, the motility function of cells is normally repressed but can be activated by appropriate stimuli and/or oncogenic transformation. In fact, one of the earliest response of cells to many extracellular growth factors is rapid reorganization of their cytoskeleton and cell shape. The leading edge of a motile cell is composed of thin protrusions of membrane that continuously extend and retract, mediating the initial stage of cell movement and determining the direction of advance. The underlying cytoskeleton of a leading edge is composed of actin-filament bundles (in filopodia) or meshworks (in lamellipodia) oriented toward the membrane (16Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar, 17Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3274) Google Scholar). In addition, the cell motility also involves the formation of long bundles of actin stress fibers that end in focal adhesions, points of attachment of the plasma membranes to the substratum. The small GTPases, including Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA, have been implicated in the regulation of morphology; the formation of filopodia/lamellopodia, membrane ruffles, and stress fibers; and motility of mammalian cells (15Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar). The small GTPase shuttles between the active GTP-bound form and the inactive GDP-bound form and act as molecular switches in intracellular signaling. There is also evidence to suggest that the small GTPases are effectors of PI-3 kinase in the signal transduction pathway leading to growth factor-induced actin reorganization, membrane ruffling, and chemotaxis (18Kotani K.

Cell Res. 1997; 234: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although the small GTPase family members have been shown to be necessary for morphological changes in response to growth factors, the mechanisms by which they initiate and regulate the formation of cytoskeletal structures are not completely understood. Recently, a family of serine/threonine kinases known as p21-activated kinases (PAKs) have been identified as a direct target of activated GTPases (21Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 22Dharmawardhane S. Sanders L.C. Martin S.S. Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Activation of PAK1 has been shown to result in phenotypic changes reminiscent of those produced by GTPases. The activation of PAK1 either by overexpression of dominant active PAK1 mutants or by stimulation of cells with growth factors causes the accumulation of F-actin and the formation of membrane ruffles, lamellipodia, and filopodia. Furthermore, activated PAK1 has been also shown to be co-localized with F-actin at the leading edge of cells (21Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr.

HRG has been shown to be involved in morphogenesis and ductal migration in mammary epithelium (23Yang Y. Spitzer E. Meyer D. Sach M. Niemann C. Hartmann G. Weidner K.M. Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. J.

In addition to HER2 overexpression, accumulating evidence suggests that the HRG pathway may be involved in the progression of breast cancer cells to a more invasive phenotype. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism(s) by which HRG-β1 signaling may participate in the acquisition of invasive phenotype in breast cancer. Our results demonstrate that HRG stimulation of a noninvasive human breast cancer cell leads to the activation of PAK1 kinase via PI-3 kinase; an increased physical association between the activated PAK1, actin, and HER2 receptor; and a redistribution of PAK1 at the leading edges. These interactions were dependent on the activation of PI-3 kinase by HRG. In addition, these molecular changes were accompanied by the development of lamellipodia/filopodia and stress fibers, and they also increased the migration of breast cancer cells through a porous membrane.

PI-3 kinase assays were performed according to Royal and Park (31Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates (1 mg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PY20 (Neomarkers) and subjected to in vitro kinase reaction in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol (Sigma) and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 20 mm MgCl2. The reaction products were separated on thin layer chromatography plates using chloroform:methanol:ammonium hydroxide:water (86:76:10:14). For PAK kinase assays, 200 μg of lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti PAK-1, and kinase assays were performed in kinase buffer using myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma) as substrate. For transfection, we used hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged dominant-negative PI-3 kinase (the p85 subunit that lacks the binding site for P110) (32Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Kotani K. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Dhand R. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). For F-actin staining, cells that had been cultured on glass coverslips or in chamber slides (Falcon) were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde followed by a short incubation with acetone at –20 °C as indicated by the manufacturer. In some cases, coverslips were coated with a thin layer of Matrigel before plating the cells. Rhodamine phalloidin has been added for 30 min at ambient temperature to stain the filamentous actin. Slides were mounted using the Slow Fade Antifade kit (Molecular Probes). We have performed the cell migration assays as described, with some modifications (33Adam L. Crepin M. Lelong J.C. Spanakis E. Israel L. Int. J Cancer. 1994; 59: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Subconfluent cells were trypsinized. Results are expressed as the percentage of migrating cells compared with the total number of cells (cells present in all Z-sections) and represent the means ± S.E. of quadruplicate wells from three or more experiments. Immunofluorescence and laser scanning confocal microscopy was essentially performed as described (30Bandyopadhyay D. Mandal M. Adam L. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1568-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). During an investigation into the mechanism of HRG action, we noticed that HRG rapidly enhances the expression of actin mRNA (Fig. 1 a) and also the synthesis of35S-labeled actin (data not shown). Because modulation of cytoskeleton proteins has been linked with cell growth and invasion (17Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3274) Google Scholar), we proceeded to investigate the role of cytoskeletal proteins in the action of HRG. The results shown in Fig. 1 b demonstrate that HRG-induced actin exists predominantly as filamentous form (F-actin). The HRG-mediated enhanced expression of F-actin was accompanied by the formation of filopodias and membrane ruffles and also stress fibers (Fig. 1 b, top right and bottom panels). Filamentous actin in serum-starved cells forms is mainly seen in the more peripheral regions, corresponding to the cortical actin. Stress fibers, as well as filopodia-like structures, which provide attachment and movement of cytoplasmic components that are responsible for cell migration, were seen only in HRG-treated cells. To investigate the biological significance of the formation of F-actin structures in HRG-treated cells, we explored whether HRG could influence the migration of breast cancer cells. MCF-7 cells were plated in the upper part of Boyden chambers containing an 8-μm porous membrane coated with Matrigel on the lower face and were cultured with or without HRG for 16 h. Cell migration was quantitated by determining the number of cells trans-migrating to the lower side of the membrane (facing the lower chamber) and expressed as percentage of the total cells. The results shown in Fig. 1 c demonstrate that HRG is a very potent cell migratory growth factor. Because overexpression of HER2 has been shown to be frequently associated with an aggressive clinical course in human breast cancer (4Muss H.B. Thor A.D. Berry D.A. Kute T. Liu E.T. Koerner F. Cirrincione C.T. Budman D.R. Wood W.C. Barcos M. New Eng. J. Med. 1994; 330: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar), we also examined the effect of HER2 overexpression on the cell migration and reorganization of actin-containing structures, using well characterized HER2-overexpressing (MCF-7/HER2) cells (25Benz C.C. Scott G.K. Sarup J.C. Johnson R.M. Tripathy D. Coronado E. Shepard H.M. Osborne CK. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1993; 24: 85-95Crossref Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 26Kumar R. Mandal M. Ratzkin B.J. Liu N. Lipton A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 62: 102-112Crossref Google Scholar). Results demonstrated that HER2-overexpressing MCF-7 cells were more motile and have more constitutively polymerized actin at the free edges as compared with MCF-7 cells but responded to HRG by further enhanced actin polymerization and cell migration (data not shown). Because activation of PAK1, the downstream target of GTPases, has been shown to result in the phenotypic changes, including a formation of lamellipodia and filopodia (21Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 22Dharmawardhane S. Sanders L.C. Martin S.S. Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), we explored the potential involvement of PAK1 in the action of HRG. To evaluate this possibility, we first investigated whether PAK1 is activated by HRG in MCF-7 cells. Cell lysates from control and HRG-treated (30 min) MCF-7 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-PAK1 Ab, and precipitated PAK1 was assayed for its kinase activity using exogenous MBP as substrate. The results shown in Fig. 2 a demonstrated that HRG rapidly increases PAK1 kinase activity, and there was autophosphorylation of PAK1. In addition to activating PAK1 kinase, the activation of PI-3 kinase has been also shown to induce actin reorganization and membrane ruffling (18Kotani K. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Ueda H. Kitamura Y. Sakaue H. Ando A. Chavanieu A. Calas B. Grigorescu F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), possibly through guanine exchange factors. Because HRG is known to activate PI-3 kinase in breast cancer cells, we investigated the potential role of PI-3 kinase in HRG-mediated alterations in cytoskeletal structures. To this end, we first examined the kinetic relationship between the stimulation of HER2 and PI-3 kinase and PAK1 activities. As shown in Fig. 2,b–d, activation of HER2 receptors by binding of HRG to its receptors resulted in rapid increase in the activities of all three kinases. The PI-3 kinase activity was induced to a maximum 13.3-fold compared with control cells within 5 min of HRG treatment and persisted up to 5 h posttreatment. It was noteworthy that HRG-induced activation of PAK1 followed the kinetics of PI-3 kinase activation with a maximum 7-fold activation by 30 min of treatment, and PAK-1 kinase remained activated over the period of 5 h compared to the levels in control untreated cells. Because HRG-induced activation of PAK1 followed the kinetics of PI-3 kinase, we investigated whether PAK1 activation is a downstream event of HRG-induced activation of PI-3 kinase. The results shown in Fig. 2,e–g, demonstrate that inhibition of PI-3 kinase by a specific inhibitor, wortmannin, was accompanied by concurrent inhibition of HRG-induced activation of PAK1 in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2,e and f). Interestingly, treatment of MCF-7 cells with wortmannin was also accompanied by suppression of HRG-mediated stimulation of cell migration through a porous membrane (Fig. 2 g). The results shown in Fig. 2 e also demonstrate that although wortmannin partially inhibited the production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, it completely blocked both PAK1 activity and cell migration in HRG-treated cells. It is possible that a phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation that was used to measure PI-3 kinase activity also contains other PI kinases that are not sensitive to wortmannin. The results in Fig. 3 show the redistribution of PAK1 at the motile free edges in the polarized, migrating HRG-treated cells. In HRG-activated cells, PAK-1 was clearly colocalized to characteristic peripheral complexes situated internal from the cell border but in the proximity of the area that resembles the leading edge of a cell that becomes polarized due to cell movement. A cytoplasmic punctate distribution could also be seen around the cell nucleus. Control cells consistently displayed different distribution of PAK-1, where it colocalized mainly with cytokeratin 19. Different subcellular localizations, such as focal adhesion complexes or pinocytic vesicles of exogenously introduced PAK-1, and not its endogenous activation as we describe here, have been stated before (22Dharmawardhane S. Sanders L.C. Martin S.S. Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Indeed, PAK-1 subcellular localization have been shown to depend on its expression level and on its interplay with GTPases (21Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 22Dharmawardhane S. Sanders L.C. Martin S.S. Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Actin reorganization is the central molecular event essential for the development of motile cytoskeletal structures in response to an appropriate stimulus. In order to establish that inhibition of cell migration by wortmannin was mediated by suppression of PI-3 kinase, we also inhibited PI-3 kinase function by the direct expression of a HA-tagged dominant-negative human mutant p85α (ΔNp85), which lacks a binding site for p110 (32Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Kotani K. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Dhand R. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), and determined the effect on HRG-mediated reorganization of actin in MCF-7 cells. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, a–c, inhibition of PI-3 kinase in transfected HA-positive cells (green color, arrow) resulted in suppression of HRG-mediated actin polymerization. In contrast, active actin polymerization (stress fibers) was observed in cells that did not expressed the mutant PI-3 kinase (negative cells, arrowhead). The inhibitory effect of ΔNp85 on actin structures was observed in more than 50% of the transfected cells. The observed suppression of actin polymerization by ΔNp85 was HRG-dependent, as there was no effect of overexpression of ΔNp85 alone (data not shown). In order to demonstrate that PAK-1 is downstream of PI-3 kinase in HRG signaling and is involved in mediating the effects of HRG on cytoskeletal system, we examined the effect of direct expression of a Myc-tagged PAK-1 mutant on HRG-induced alterations in the reorganization of actin in MCF-7 cells. A mutated PAK1 molecule (ΔH83L/H86L) chosen for these studies contains mutations within the p21 (Rac/Cdc42) binding site, rendering it unable to associate with Rac and Cdc42 (21Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Although active as a protein kinase, this form of Pak1 may sequester downstream signaling elements, thus potentially interfering with Rac and/or Cdc42 signals. The results shown in Fig. 4,d–f, demonstrate that inhibition of PAK1 function in cells transfected with the Myc-tagged PAK1 mutant (green color, arrow) resulted in complete blockade of HRG-mediated actin polymerization. In transfected cells, F-actin was weakly seen at cell-cell contact sites, but it was not highly polymerized. In contrast, actin was highly polymerized in the untransfected cells (arrowhead). The inhibitory effect of dominant-negative PAK1 on actin structures was observed in more than 60% of the transfected cells. There was no inhibitory effect of the transfection of Myc-tagged control vector on HRG-induced reorganization of actin polymerization or cell attachment (Fig. 4, g–i). In brief, these results suggested that the HRG-initiated signals leading to actin reorganization could be blocked by inhibiting PI-3 kinase and/or PAK1 kinase. Because HRG triggered relocalization of PAK1 into the leading edge of cells, we explored the potential interactions between the activated HER2 receptor"

Immunofluorescence showed that tomato lectin-mediated clustering of band 3 in ghost membranes caused a similar clustering of CAII, indicating an in situ association. CAII cosolubilized and coimmunoprecipitated with band 3, suggesting that the two proteins form a complex. Band 3 (K 1/2 = 70 nm) or the membrane domain of band 3 (K 1/2 = 100 nm) bound saturably to immobilized CAII in a solid phase binding assay. The interaction with CAII was specifically blocked by an antibody to the Ct of band 3. Affinity blotting showed that a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion protein (GST-Ct) containing the last 33 residues of human band 3 bound to CAII. The solid phase binding assay showed that binding of GST-Ct to immobilized CAII was saturable (K 1/2 = 20 nm). The binding rate was slow (t 1/2 = 12 h) at physiological ionic strength and pH but was enhanced at low ionic strength or acidic pH. Intact band 3 (K i = 15 nm), the membrane domain of band 3 (K i = 100 nm), or antibodies to the Ct of band 3 were able to block GST-Ct binding to CAII, confirming the specificity of the interaction. Affinity chromatography showed that CAII bound to immobilized GST-Ct with a 1:1 stoichiometry. This work indicates that CAII, the bicarbonate supplier, is directly coupled to band 3, the chloride/bicarbonate exchanger in red blood cells.

Along with band 3, carbonic anhydrase (CA) contributes to pulmonary gas exchange by catalyzing the hydration of CO2 to produce bicarbonate (22Swenson E.R. Gronlund J. Ohlsson J. Hlastala M.P. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 74: 838-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Two major isoforms of CA are found in human red cells; over 85% of erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase is CAI, whereas the remainder is predominantly the higher activity form, CAII (23Sly W.S. Hu P.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 375-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Interestingly, as the abundance of CAII in red cells is approximately 1 million (24Tashian R.E. Carter N.D. Hirschhurd H.H.A.K. Advances in Human Genetics. 7. Plenum Press, New York1976: 1-55Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar), its ratio to band 3 is close to 1:1. Although CAI deficiency is not associated with any known medical disorder in humans (25Kendall A.G. Science. 1977; 197: 471-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), CAII deficiency leads to osteopetrosis with renal tubular acidosis and cerebral calcification (26Sly W.S. Whyte M.P. Sundaram V. Tashian R.E. Hewett-Emmett D. Guibaud P. Vainsel M. Baluarte H.J. Grushkin A. Al-Mosawi M. Sakati N. Ohlsson A. New Engl. J. Med. 1985; 313: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Both isoforms of CA have increased activity in the presence of erythrocyte membranes. Bovine CA, the homologue of human CAII, binds to erythrocyte membranes in vitro (27Parkes J.L. Coleman P.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Binding of a stilbene-disulfonate inhibitor to band 3 perturbs the fluorescence of labeled bovine CA, suggesting there is a physical link between the two enzymes (28Kifor G. Toon M.R. Janoshazi A. Solomon A.K. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 134: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that band 3 contains a binding site for CAII. We demonstrate a direct interaction between CAII and band 3 and localize the binding site for CAII to the Ct 33 residues of band 3. By binding CAII, the bicarbonate supplier is colocalized with the red cell chloride/bicarbonate exchanger. This may be an example of metabolic channeling in which sequential enzymatic steps are compartmentalized (29Ovadi J. J. Theor.

Acta. 1980; 623: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have been described. For immunofluorescence experiments, anti-human CAII serum was affinity purified by incubating a 1:100 dilution of the serum with a nitrocellulose membrane on which purified CAII had been immobilized. Adsorbed anti-human CAII was eluted from the membrane using Immunopure Ab elution buffer (Pierce) and then dialyzed against distilled water and concentrated using a centrifugal concentrator (Amicon). The anti-Ct of band 3 serum used for immunofluorescence was generated from a peptide comprising the last 16 residues of band 3. The BSA conjugate of this peptide was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (0.5 ml) (Pharmacia). After adsorbing the anti-Ct serum to the resin, it was eluted and concentrated as above. The pBluescript II SK(+) vector (Stratagene) containing the human band 3 sequence was the generous gift of Drs. A. M. Garcia and H. Lodish (Whitehead Institute). The vector was linearized with SmaI and used in a polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide primers 5′-GACGGATCCGGAACGTGGAGCTTCAG-3′ and 3′-CCATGATTACGCCAAGCTCG-5′ designed to amplify residues 879–911 of the Ct region of band 3 (RNVELQCLDADDAKATFDEEEGRDEYDEVAMPV) plus 95 base pairs of 3′-untranslated sequence and to insert BamHI sites onto both ends of the DNA. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with BamHI, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and ligated into pGEX-5x-1 plasmid that had been linearized withBamHI and treated with calf-intestinal phosphatase. Competent E. coli DH5α were transformed with the ligation reaction products. Clones containing the insert were identified by restriction enzyme digestion with BamHI, and the correct orientation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. GST or GST-Ct was expressed in E. coli DH5α cells and purified according to the supplier (Pharmacia) using glutathione-Sepharose. The peak fractions were pooled and further purified on DEAE-Sepharose 4B. DEAE-bound fusion protein was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture and eluted with a linear salt gradient (0–400 mm NaCl). Purity was assessed by size-exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. High pressure liquid chromatography size-exclusion chromatography revealed that the fusion protein, like native GST, was dimeric. Aliquots (100 μl) were frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath and stored at −20 °C. Samples were stable for at least 6 months. There was no difference in the reactivity of GST-Ct to the goat anti-GST serum compared with GST control. Band 3 and the membrane domain were purified from KI-stripped inside-out vesicles (34Bennett V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), solubilized in C12E8, and chromatographed by published protocols (35Casey J.R. Lieberman D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 494-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Erythrocyte ghost membranes were prepared from normal and CAI-deficient human red cells. In both cases, packed membranes (50 μl) were diluted to 500 μl in 5 mmsodium phosphate, pH 8 (5P8) and incubated with or without the addition of 0.2 mg/ml tomato lectin for 15 min on ice. The membranes were pelleted by centrifugation and then washed with 500 μl of 5P8. Smears were made on glass microscope slides, air dried at −20 °C for 45 min, and then fixed for 5 min in 100% methanol at −20 °C. Dried smears were rehydrated by slow addition of cold distilled water. For detection of band 3, the smears were incubated with 50 μl of 26 μg/ml affinity-purified rabbit anti-band 3 in 3% BSA (150 μl) 150 mm NaCl, 5P8 (PBS) for 30 min at 22 °C followed by washing with PBS and incubation in 1:20 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in 150 μl of 3% BSA in PBS at 22 °C for 30 min. For detection of CAII, the smears were incubated with 50 μl of affinity-purified rabbit anti-CAII in 3% BSA (150 μl) in PBS for 30 min at 22 °C. This was followed by washing in PBS and then incubation with 1:20 dilution of biotinylated anti-sheep IgG in PBS. Smears were washed and incubated in a 1:20 dilution of rhodamine-avidin (ICN) in 3% BSA (150 μl) in PBS, and then washed again in PBS and mounted in Fluorosave (Calbiochem) with glass coverslips. Samples were observed using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal microscope equipped with a Krypton-Argon laser. All steps were performed at 0–4 °C unless otherwise noted. Ghost membranes were prepared by lysis and repeated washing of red cells in 5P8. Ghost membranes were incubated in PBS on ice to remove band 6. PBS-washed ghosts were washed in 5P8 and then solubilized by adding 1 volume of 1% C12E8 in 5P8. The solubilized ghosts were separated by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 40 min). The supernatant, containing band 3, was carefully decanted and used for immunoprecipitation. The supernatant (250 μl) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1–10 μl of a rabbit polyclonal anti-band 3 serum that recognizes the amino-terminal cytosolic domain or a rabbit polyclonal anti-Ct of band 3 serum or rabbit IgG as a control. Protein G-Sepharose was added, and the samples were incubated for a further 4 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed (0.1% C12E8 in 5P8), and bound protein was eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS gel electrophoresis (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) and then transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with an anti-CAII serum. Some cross-reactivity to CAI was noted with this anti-serum. Purified CAII or CAI (0.2–1 μg/well) was covalently immobilized onto 96-well microtiter plates by incubating the protein in the plates with 1.25 mg ml−1 of 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate in 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6, for 30 min at room temperature (37Edelman G.M. Rutishauser U. Millette C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2153-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 38Guy D. Latner A.L. Turner G.A. Exp. Cell Biol. 1979; 47: 312-319PubMed Google Scholar). The plates were washed extensively with PBS (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5) and then blocked for 2 h at room temperature in PBS supplemented with 2% BSA. The bound CAII was shown to be active by an esterase assay (39Thorslund A. Lindskog S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 3: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Plates were washed with Ab buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% C12E8, 5 mm EDTA, 0.25% gelatin) and incubated with purified band 3 or the band 3 membrane domain. Bound protein was detected by incubating the plates first with a biotinylated tomato lectin that binds to the band 3 oligosaccharide and then with peroxidase-labeled biotin/avidin. This was followed by incubation with the peroxidase substrateo-phenyldiamine and detection of enzymatic activity at 450 nm in a ThermoMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices) connected to a Macintosh workstation. For purified GST-Ct or GST, bound protein was detected by incubating the plates sequentially in goat anti-GST serum, biotinylated affinity-purified rabbit anti-goat IgG, peroxidase-labeled biotin/avidin, and finally o-phenylenediamine. The buffer used for incubations of GST-Ct or GST with immobilized CAII was Ab buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100 or as described in the figure legends. Subsequent washes and antibody incubations were done in Ab buffer in all cases. Band 3 or the membrane domain in 0.1% C12E8 was mixed with rabbit polyclonal anti-Ct of band 3 serum or rabbit pre-immune serum and then incubated with immobilized CAII. Competition of GST-Ct with antibodies was done in the same way. For competition of GST-Ct with band 3 or the membrane domain, various concentrations of GST-Ct were mixed with either band 3 or the membrane domain and then incubated with immobilized CAII. Bound protein was detected as described above. Protein fractions were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels using the Laemmli gel system (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) and then transferred to nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose transfers were blocked (0.25% gelatin, 10% ethanolamine, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0) and then washed in Ab buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100. Transfers were incubated with 0.2–2.0 μg ml−1 GST-Ct or GST for 18 h at room temperature. Transfers were washed in Ab buffer and then incubated with goat anti-GST serum (1:5000 dilution in Ab buffer) for 2 h followed by an incubation with biotinylated affinity-purified rabbit anti-goat IgG (1:10,000). Further amplification was achieved by a subsequent incubation with biotinylated peroxidase/avidin (1:10,000). Reactive bands were visualized by ECL as described by the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). Purified GST-Ct or GST was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (25–100 μg of protein/ml of resin) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 50 mm NaCl. To 10-μl aliquots of Sepharose were added various concentrations of purified CAII to a total volume of 100 μl. The mixtures were incubated for 15–18 h at 4 °C and pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was then removed. The resin was then washed with 1 ml of buffer. Bound protein was eluted with 90 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and electrophoresed. Densitometry of the Coomassie Blue-stained gel was used to determine the ratio of CAII bound to either GST-Ct or GST control. GST, GST-Ct, and CAII bound similar amounts of Coomassie Blue dye. Binding curves were plotted using Microcal Origin 4.0. Absorbance values were converted to percent maximum binding by determining the maximum signal obtained in the assay and calculating the other values relative to it. Since band 3 and CAII catalyze interconnected processes, we set out to determine whether the two proteins form a complex in the erythrocyte. To test this hypothesis, we examined the distribution of band 3 and CAII in the membrane following treatment of intact ghost membranes with tomato lectin. Tomato lectin specifically binds to the repeating polylactosaminoglycan structure on band 3 in erythrocyte membranes (40Casey J.R. Pirraglia C.A. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11940-11948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and causes their clustering within the plane of the membrane. If CAII is attached to band 3 on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, it should also redistribute in a similar fashion as a consequence of lectin treatment. Band 3 is the predominant tomato lectin-binding protein in the erythrocyte membrane, although the glucose transporter (GLUT1) and the water channel (AQP1) also possess polylactosaminoglycan. Red cell ghosts were prepared and incubated with or without tomato lectin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The background immunofluorescence of membranes not incubated with primary antibodies was barely detectable (Fig. 1, top panels). Immunofluorescence of non-lectin-treated samples showed that both band 3 and CAII were present diffusely in ghost membranes (Fig. 1,middle panels). In samples treated with tomato lectin, band 3 was distributed in clusters (Fig. 1, bottom panels). The confocal view of these agglutinated red cells showed patches of immunofluorescence (see inset), due to band 3 aggregation in the plane of the membrane. The effect on CAII was nearly identical, with the redistribution of this enzyme also occurring after addition of lectin. This suggests that band 3 is physically tethered to CAII in intact red cell membranes. Similar results were obtained using red cell ghost smears obtained from an individual with CAI deficiency. Because it seemed that band 3 and CAII were interacting in situ, we used Western immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-CAII serum to determine whether CAII copurified with band 3. After lysing erythrocytes with 20–40 volumes of 5P8, a significant fraction (5–10%) of the total red cell CAII (M r = 29,000) remained tightly associated with the ghost membranes and was only partially removed by subsequent incubation with PBS (pH 8) (Fig. 2 A). Red cells from a CAI-deficient individual showed that this bound fraction was the low abundance isoform CAII. After detergent solubilization of band 3, most of the membrane-bound CAII was found in the supernatant with band 3, rather than associated with the pelleted cytoskeleton. When the supernatant was incubated with antiserum recognizing the amino terminus of band 3, CAII was coimmunoprecipitated with band 3 (Fig. 2 B). However, when band 3 was incubated with an antiserum to the Ct or with pre-immune rabbit IgG (data not shown), CAII did not coimmunoprecipitate. The inability of anti-Ct serum to coimmunoprecipitate CAII suggests that CAII may be associated with the Ct of band 3. Band 3-CAII complexes would not be accessible to the anti-Ct serum since a free Ct is required for antibody binding to this sequence (16Lieberman D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10022-10028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Drickamer L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5115-5123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A solid phase binding assay was developed to examine the interaction between band 3 and CAII in greater detail. CAII immobilized on microtiter plates possessed enzymatic activity indicating it had retained a native conformation (data not shown). The binding of both intact band 3 and the membrane domain of band 3 to immobilized CAII was examined. The membrane domain of band 3 lacks the 360-amino acid amino-terminal domain but retains the ability to transport anions. Fig. 3shows that both band 3 (K 1/2 = 70 nm) and the membrane domain (K 1/2 = 100 nm) bound saturably to immobilized CAII. Under identical conditions (24-h incubation, 22 °C), no binding to immobilized CAI was observed (data not shown), suggesting a specificity of band 3 for the high activity isoform, CAII. The ability of both band 3 and the membrane domain of band 3 to bind CAII with similarK 1/2 indicated that the binding site for CAII did not require the amino terminus of band 3. The binding curve for the membrane domain differed from band 3 following a sigmoidal relationship and suggesting a cooperative interaction (Fig. 3). The location of the interaction between band 3 or the membrane domain with immobilized CAII was shown by competition with a Ct antibody (Fig. 4). When the anti-Ct serum was incubated with band 3 or the membrane domain, binding to immobilized CAII was decreased in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the Ct was the main site of interaction. Pre-immune serum did not affect the interaction of band 3 and CAII. A GST-Ct fusion protein (see below) was also able to compete with band 3 for binding to CAII (data not shown). To directly demonstrate the role of the Ct in CAII binding, we constructed a GST-fusion protein encoding the Ct region of band 3 (residues 879–911) to use as a probe in an affinity blotting assay. Binding of the GST-fusion protein (GST-Ct) or GST control to proteins immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes was detected using an anti-GST serum. When erythrocyte hemolysate was tested, GST-Ct bound to a protein identified by its electrophoretic mobility as carbonic anhydrase, consisting of isoforms I and II (Fig. 5 A). When equivalent amounts of GST control were used to probe nitrocellulose membranes, much lower levels of binding were observed (Fig. 5 A). When hemolysate from a CAI-deficient patient was tested, a similar result was obtained (data not shown). Because band 3 and the membrane domain seemed only to bind CAII, purified CAI and CAII were tested using the same assay. GST-Ct bound to CAII, and only a low level of binding of the GST control to CAII was detected (Fig. 5 B). Both GST-Ct and GST bound similarly at low levels to CAI (data not shown). This indicated that GST-Ct specifically recognized the high activity isoform, CAII. To characterize the interaction between GST-Ct and CAII under native conditions, the solid phase binding assay was used. The binding of GST-Ct to immobilized CAII saturated with half-maximal binding occurring at 20 nm (Fig. 6). Under these conditions, GST did not bind, thereby demonstrating a requirement for the Ct in CAII binding. This K 1/2 value, 20 nm, is comparable with those obtained for band 3 (70 nm) and the membrane domain (100 nm). This suggests that the Ct is sufficient for binding to CAII. The binding of GST-Ct to immobilized CAII was slow, with at 1/2 of 12 h under conditions of physiological ionic strength and pH (Fig. 7 A). A similar time course was found for band 3 or the membrane domain binding to immobilized CAII. As the Ct of band 3 is enriched in acidic residues, the effects of ionic strength and pH on binding CAII were examined. GST-Ct or GST was incubated for 18 h with CAII in the presence of various concentrations of KCl or NaCl. The binding was inhibited by high concentrations of KCl or NaCl with a half-maximal decrease in the signal seen at approximately 100 mm (Fig. 7 B). The effect of NaHCO3, a band 3 substrate, was also examined. A concentration of 25 mm sodium bicarbonate was sufficient to reduce binding to half-maximal (data not shown). The greater inhibitory effect of bicarbonate over chloride may reflect a regulatory role of bicarbonate on the interaction. The effect of pH on the binding of CAII to GST-Ct was dramatic, with the rate of binding being greater at acidic pH (Fig. 7 C). A sharp pH dependence was observed with half-maximal binding observed at pH 7.0. This pH dependence of the interaction may partly explain why only a fraction of the erythrocyte CAII remained associated with membranes after lysis of red blood cells in 5P8. The enhanced binding seen with acidic pH and low ionic strength are on the time course of the interaction; both factors decrease the time required to reach saturation (data not shown). The effects of low ionic strength and acidic pH occur at the initial binding step since subsequent washes and antibody incubations are performed in Ab buffer (100 mmNaCl, pH 7.5). This may indicate that the interaction between GST-Ct and CAII is promoted by low ionic strength and acidic pH and that, once “locked on,” the interaction is very strong. Inclusion of acetazolamide (100 μm), an inhibitor of CAII that binds to the enzyme's active site, did not affect binding of GST-Ct to immobilized CAII. Furthermore, GST-Ct had no effect on the esterase activity of soluble CAII (data not shown). Therefore, the Ct sequence of band 3 does not seem to perturb the enzymatic function of CAII. Prelabeling band 3 or the membrane domain with H2DIDS, a potent inhibitor of anion transport, did not prevent binding of the modified protein to CAII (data not shown). Antibodies recognizing the Ct of band 3 blocked GST-Ct binding to CAII (Fig. 8). Both a monoclonal and a polyclonal antibody to the Ct were able to decrease binding"
https://openalex.org/W2329929261,"BRCA1 mRNA is reduced in sporadic breast cancer cells despite the lack of mutations. Because a CpG island is found at the 5′ end of the BRCA1 gene, we hypothesized that the decreased BRCA1 mRNA in sporadic breast cancer was associated with aberrant cytosine methylation of the CpG island. We examined BRCA1 mRNA expression in normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and six sporadic breast cancer cell lines using RT–PCR. The normal breast cells expressed high levels of BRCA1 mRNA. The sporadic breast cancer cell lines and PBLs expressed lower levels of BRCA1 mRNA ranging from a 3–16-fold decrease compared to the normal breast cells. We identified a 600 bp region of the BRCA1 CpG island that possessed strong promoter activity (∼40-fold above control), and determined the cytosine methylation patterns of the 30 CpG sites within this region by sodium bisulfite genomic sequencing. The HMECs, PBLs and five of the sporadic breast cancer cell lines were largely unmethylated. However, one sporadic breast cancer cell line, UACC3199, was ⩾60% methylated at all 30 CpG sites (18 sites were 100% methylated) and was associated with an eightfold decrease in BRCA1 mRNA compared to normal breast cells. These findings suggest that aberrant cytosine methylation of the BRCA1 CpG island promoter may be one mechanism of BRCA1 repression in sporadic breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2026469331,"PAKs are serine/threonine protein kinases that are activated by binding to Rac or Cdc42hs. Different forms of activated PAK1 have been reported to either promote membrane ruffling and focal adhesion assembly or cause focal adhesion disassembly and stress fiber dissolution. To understand the basis for these distinct morphological effects, we have examined the mechanism of mutational activation of PAK1, and characterized the effects of different active PAK1 proteins on cytoskeletal structure in vivo. We find that PAK1 contains an autoinhibitory domain that overlaps with its small G protein binding domain and that two separate activating mutations within this regulatory region each decrease autoinhibitory activity. Because only one of these mutations affects Cdc42hs binding activity, this indicates that activation of PAK1 by these mutations results from interference with the function of the autoinhibitory domain and not with small G protein binding activity. When we examined the morphological effects of these different forms of PAK1 in vivo, we found that PAK1 kinase activity was associated with disassembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers and that this may require interaction with potential SH3 domain-containing proteins. Lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling caused by active PAK1 expression, however, was independent of PAK1 catalytic activity and likely requires interaction among multiple proteins binding to the PAK1 regulatory domain.

Rho family small G proteins are key regulators of cytoskeletal organization and gene expression, but the mechanisms by which they control these processes are unclear.

The mechanisms by which PAKs control these events are for the most part undefined.To date, three PAK isoforms have been cloned (PAKs 1, 2, and 3). Each contains a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain that binds Rac and Cdc42hs. The catalytic domains share greater than 90% identity. The regulatory domains are less well conserved with an overall identity of 55%. Within this regulatory, noncatalytic region of approximately 250 amino acids, however, is a stretch of 66 residues that is over 90% identical among PAK isoforms (amino acids 67–132 in PAK1). PAK1 also contains five potential SH3-binding sites, as defined by the amino acid sequence PXXP (18Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). The most N-terminal of these, starting at proline 13, binds the SH2-SH3-containing adaptor protein Nck constitutively (7Galisteo M.L. Chernoff J. Su Y.-C. Skolnik E. Schlessinger J. J. Biol.

PAK1 has also been shown to bind the Rho family exchange factor PIX within a polyproline sequence between amino acids 182 and 203 (9Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.-S. Chen Q. Tan L. Tan I.

Ligands for the other potential SH3-binding sites have not been identified.A role for PAK1 in cytoskeletal regulation has been demonstrated. By transient transfection of an activated PAK1 mutant unable to bind small G proteins (PAK1 H83/86L), one group has shown in Swiss 3T3 cells that prolonged expression of PAK1 H83/86L promotes the formation of polarized actin ruffles that contain vinculin-associated focal adhesions (16Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). In contrast, another group has shown in HeLa cells that PAK1 itself associates with focal adhesions and that expression of three distinct forms of active PAK1 promotes stress fiber disassembly (6Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhao Z.-S. Manser E. Chen Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These apparently conflicting results could be due to differences in the activating mutations used, as well as the distinct cell types examined. To define more precisely the effects of PAK1 activation on cell morphology, we have characterized three commonly used activating mutations in terms of their mechanism of activation and ability to interact with Cdc42hs. In short term microinjection assays we have also examined the effects of these PAK1 molecules on cytoskeletal structure. The results highlight key features involved in the regulation of PAK1 activity and the effects of PAK1 on cytoskeletal organization.DISCUSSIONAs a first step in describing the mechanism by which PAK1 modulates cytoskeletal structure, we have characterized several commonly used active PAK1 mutants, and we identified an autoinhibitory domain that regulates PAK1 activation. We demonstrated that residues 75–132 function as a minimal autoinhibitory domain in vitroand that the H83/86L and L107F mutations reduce the ability of the autoinhibitory domain to function. Because these mutants occur in or near the small G protein binding domain, it had been inferred that altered small G protein binding caused the increase in activity. We show here that these mutations activate PAK1 because they have reduced autoinhibitory activity. The degree to which these mutations block autoinhibition correlates with the degree of activation of PAK1 kinase activity. Thus, the double mutation H83/86L only partially blocks the autoinhibitory domain and results in only a slight activation of PAK1 kinase activity (5–10-fold). On the other hand, the L107F mutation completely prevents autoinhibition and results in a maximally active kinase (250-fold activated). Deletion of the autoinhibitory domain altogether (as in PAK1-(165)) also results in a maximally active kinase. We also show that while the H83/86L mutations block Rac or Cdc42hs binding in vitro, the L107F mutation leaves this interaction intact. These findings have important implications for the function of these PAK1 mutants in cells. For example, once activated, PAK1 may remain bound to its activating small G protein (Rac or Cdc42hs) (2Manser E. Chong C. Zhao Z.-S. Leung T. Michael G. Hall C. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25070-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 3Teo M. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26690-26697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This binding may target PAK1 to particular intracellular locations, as well as promote interaction with other effectors that also bind to these small G proteins. Thus, only PAK1 L107F retains the potential to interact with the same molecules as wild type PAK1.Our characterization of these mutants allows us to ascertain PAK1 effects in vivo. We find that PAK1 kinase activity is essential for promotion of focal adhesion disassembly, since only PAK1-(165) and PAK1 L107F but not PAK1 H83/86L or kinase-inactive mutants are active in this regard. Thus, PAK1 probably phosphorylates proteins that either regulate cytoskeletal assembly or the cytoskeletal elements themselves. Interestingly, kinase-inactive, full-length versions of PAK1 do promote other morphological changes. Specifically, they cause extensive lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling (Fig. 6). This second type of morphological change is almost certainly due to interactions with other proteins through the PAK1 N terminus. One of these is likely to be PIX. When expressed in cells, PIX promotes focal adhesion assembly and membrane ruffling (9Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.-S. Chen Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Since kinase-inactive PAK1-(165) can still bind to PIX but does not promote lamellipodia formation or membrane ruffling, it is possible that endogenous PIX bound to PAK must interact with other proteins associated with the PAK1 N terminus to have these effects. Thus, the PAK1 regulatory domain may act as a nucleating factor that brings together proteins involved in cytoskeletal regulation. It is important to note that the effects of PAK1 H83/86L expression on cell morphology may largely be due to this sort of scaffolding role. This idea is supported by the observation that overnight expression of either active PAK1 H83/86L or its kinase-inactive form both promote lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling. The reduced efficiency of kinase-active PAK1 H83/86L in this regard (compare Figs. 4 and 6) probably reflects a certain degree of focal adhesion disassembly resulting from its modestly activated kinase activity.The disassembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers caused by PAK1 kinase activity may also require sustained interaction with other proteins. This notion is supported by the finding that mutation of prolines 209 and 220 to alanine, which disrupts two potential SH3-binding sites, reduces the efficiency of cytoskeletal disassembly mediated by PAK1. These interactions are likely to be specific for PAK1, since the two potential SH3-binding sites containing prolines 209 and 220 are not conserved among PAK isoforms. The identity of the interacting protein (or proteins) is presently unknown.The ability of PAK1 to cause remodeling of cytoskeletal structures points to a role in regulating processes such as cell motility. A migrating cell must be able to form filopodia and lamellipodia at its leading edge, as well as disassemble cell-substrate contacts at the retracting edge. This requires both localized assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions. The ability of PAK1 itself to promote focal adhesion disassembly as well as PAK1-associated proteins (such as PIX) to promote lamellipodia formation is likely to be crucial to these processes. As an effector of Rac and Cdc42hs, PAK activity probably counteracts the actions of RhoA effectors such as ROCK (22Leung, T., Chen, Q., Manser, E., and Lim, L. (1996) Mol. Cell. Biol. 5313–5327Google Scholar, 23Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 24Ishizaki T.

Interestingly, coexpression of constitutively active ROCK, which itself promotes focal adhesion assembly and stress fiber formation, can partially inhibit cell collapse caused by overexpression of active PAK1 (data not shown). Future studies will be needed to determine the precise nature of interplay between Rac, Cdc42hs, and RhoA effectors in these processes. Rho family small G proteins are key regulators of cytoskeletal organization and gene expression, but the mechanisms by which they control these processes are unclear. In their GTP-bound state, these small G proteins bind to a number of enzymes that are believed to act as downstream effectors. Among these are a family of serine/threonine kinases known as p21-activated kinases, or PAKs (1Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L.

Small G protein binding is accompanied by autophosphorylation on mutiple residues both in vivo and in vitro, and this is thought to be crucial for activation (6Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen Q.

The disassembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers caused by PAK1 kinase activity may also require sustained interaction with other proteins. This notion is supported by the finding that mutation of prolines 209 and 220 to alanine, which disrupts two potential SH3-binding sites, reduces the efficiency of cytoskeletal disassembly mediated by PAK1. These interactions are likely to be specific for PAK1, since the two potential SH3-binding sites containing prolines 209 and 220 are not conserved among PAK isoforms. The identity of the interacting protein (or proteins) is presently unknown. The ability of PAK1 to cause remodeling of cytoskeletal structures points to a role in regulating processes such as cell motility. A migrating cell must be able to form filopodia and lamellipodia at its leading edge, as well as disassemble cell-substrate contacts at the retracting edge. This requires both localized assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions. The ability of PAK1 itself to promote focal adhesion disassembly as well as PAK1-associated proteins (such as PIX) to promote lamellipodia formation is likely to be crucial to these processes. As an effector of Rac and Cdc42hs, PAK activity probably counteracts the actions of RhoA effectors such as ROCK (22Leung, T., Chen, Q., Manser, E., and Lim, L. (1996) Mol. Cell.

We show that Cis associates with the second tyrosine residue of the intracellular domain of the erythropoietin receptor (Tyr401). Two forms of Cis with molecular masses of 32 and 37 kDa were detected, and we demonstrate that the 37-kDa protein resulted from post-translational modifications of the 32-kDa form. Anti-ubiquitin antibodies recognized the 37-kDa form of Cis and the proteasome inhibitorsN-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal and lactacystin inhibited its degradation, showing that the 37-kDa form of Cis is a ubiquitinated protein, which seems to be rapidly degraded by the proteasome. In erythropoietin-stimulated UT-7 cells, the activation of the erythropoietin receptor and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) was transient and returned to basal levels after 30–60 min of erythropoietin stimulation. In contrast, these proteins remained strongly phosphorylated, and STAT5 remained activated for at least 120 min in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. These experiments demonstrate that the proteasomes are involved in the down-regulation of the erythropoietin receptor activation signals. Because the proteasome inhibitors induced the accumulation of both the ubiquitinated form of Cis and the Cis-erythropoietin receptor complexes, our results suggest that the ubiquitinated form of Cis could be involved in the proteasome-mediated inactivation of the erythropoietin receptor.

Survival, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic cells are controlled by multiple cytokines that exert their effects through specific membrane receptors. Except for SCF,1macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and FLT3 ligand receptors, which are class III tyrosine kinase receptors, most receptors for hemopoietic cytokines belong to the class I cytokine receptor family. Although these receptors are devoid of tyrosine kinase activity, they are associated with intracellular tyrosine kinases that belong to several families. Among these tyrosine kinases, the Jak kinases appear to play a key role in the initiation of the intracellular signaling mechanisms (for review, see Refs. 1Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar, 2Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The Epo receptor belongs to this cytokine receptor superfamily, which also includes receptors for many interleukins and colony-stimulating factors. Epo is essential for the survival and proliferation of the late erythroid progenitors and for their differentiation into erythrocytes. The Epo receptor is preassociated with the tyrosine kinase Jak2, and Epo binding to its receptor induces the dimerisation of the Epo receptor. This dimerisation activates the Jak2 kinases most likely by allowing their transphosphorylation (3Witthuhn B. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Yi T. Tang B. Muira O. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1993; 74: 227-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). The activated kinases then phosphorylate several proteins, including the Epo receptor itself (4Miura O. D'Andrea A.

Hematol. 1996; 24: 1455-1459PubMed Google Scholar for a recent review concerning the mechanisms of intracellular Epo signaling). Besides these positive regulatory pathways, the activation of the Epo receptor also turns on negative regulatory pathways, which are involved in the termination of the signal transduction. One of these negative regulatory pathways is the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, which binds both to the phosphorylated third tyrosine residue of the intracellular domain of the Epo receptor (21Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.C. Lodish H.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) and to the Jak2 kinase (22Jiao H. Berrada K. Yang W. Tabrizi M. Platanias L.C. Yi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6985-6992Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). SHP-1 then dephosphorylates and inactivates Jak2 and probably the Epo receptor. Another negative regulatory pathway of Epo receptor signaling involves the protein Cis. Cis (cytokine-inducible Src homology 2-containing protein) gene expression is rapidly induced in hematopoietic cells by IL-2, IL-3, GM-CSF, and Epo (23Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kigushi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). All of these cytokines activate STAT5, and it has been shown that Cis is a target gene of STAT5 (24Matsumoto A. Masuhara M. Mitsui K. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyajima A. Yoshimura A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Forced expression of Cis suppresses IL-3- and Epo-induced cell proliferation. Cis contains an Src homology 2 domain in the central part of the molecule, and it was previously shown to associate to the cytoplasmic domain of the tyrosine-phosphorylated Epo receptor and the tyrosine-phosphorylated β chain of the IL-3 receptor. No catalytic domain was detected in the Cis protein, and Cis does not seem to be tyrosine phosphorylated or to contain another known protein association module. Thus, Cis appears to share neither the characteristics of an effector protein nor those of an adapter protein. Cis has a calculated molecular mass of 29 kDa but migrates as multiple bands in polyacrylamide gels. The Cis protein has a rapid turnover, because it is quickly expressed in cytokine-stimulated cells and disappears rapidly after cytokine starvation (23Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kigushi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of Cis is currently unknown, although it has been shown that Cis overexpression reduced STAT5 activation (24Matsumoto A. Masuhara M. Mitsui K. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyajima A. Yoshimura A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently a family of proteins that are structurally related to Cis has been cloned (25Endo T.A. Masuhara M.

SOCS1 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 1), also named JAB (for Jak-binding protein) and SSI-1 (for STAT-induced STAT inhibitor 1) inhibits the differentiation of M1 cells into macrophages in response to IL-6. Its expression is regulated by STATs, and it can reduce Jak tyrosine kinase activity by direct interaction with Jak family members, suggesting that SOCS1 could act in a classic negative feedback loop in the regulation of cytokine signal transduction. Two relatives of SOCS1 named SOCS2 and SOCS3 have also been cloned. Their roles have not been determined. In this report, we show that Cis associates to the phosphorylated second tyrosine residue (Tyr401) of the Epo receptor, which is one of the two major STAT5 activation sites. We also observed that Cis is a ubiquitinated protein and that proteasome inhibitors induced the accumulation of the ubiquitinated form of Cis and the accumulation of the Cis-Epo receptor complexes. Highly purified recombinant human Epo (specific activity, 120 000 units/mg) used throughout this study was a generous gift from Dr. M. Brandt (Boehringer Mannheim). Recombinant SCF was kindly provided by Dr. A. Shimosaka (Kirin Brewery Co., Tokyo, Japan). The proteasome inhibitors LLnL and lactacystin were purchased from Sigma and Calbiochem, respectively. Anti-Cis antibodies were produced as described previously (23Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kigushi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). During the achievement of this work, commercial anti-Cis antibodies (SC1569; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were made available and were used for some Western blot experiments. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10) were a generous gift from Dr B. Druker (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Anti-Epo receptor antibodies were produced by immunizing rabbits with a recombinant protein composed of the full intracellular domain of the human Epo receptor fused to GST or to MalE. Anti-GST and anti-MalE antibodies were also prepared in our laboratory using the same protocol. Whole anti-GST, anti-MalE, and anti-Epo receptor sera were used. We produced anti-STAT5A and anti-STAT5B antibodies by immunizing rabbits with peptides corresponding to the last 12 amino acids (AGLFTSARSSLS) of STAT5A or the last 8 amino acids of STAT5B (QWIPHAQS) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. These peptidic sequences are specific for STAT5A and STAT5B, respectively. A mixture of both antibodies was used in the experiments reported in this paper. Anti-ubiquitin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (catalogue number SC6085) and from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA; catalogue number 13-1600).

These cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium containing 5% fetal calf serum complemented with 2 units/ml Epo, 2.5 ng/ml GM-CSF, or 50 ng/ml SCF. A clone of these cells overexpressing the Cis protein was established by transfecting the Cis cDNA in pME vector (pME-Cis) (23Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kigushi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G.

Transfected cells were selected for neomycin resistance in the presence of SCF and tested for Cis expression by Western blot analysis. Before each experiment, the cells were serum and growth factor deprived by incubation overnight in Iscove's Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.; catalogue number 31980-022) containing 0.4% deionized bovine serum albumin. The same pMe-Cis plasmid was also used to transiently transfect COS7 cells (ECACC number 87021302) using DEAE-dextran (29Kriegler M. Kriegler M. Gene Transfer and Expression: A Laboratory Manual.

WEHI-conditioned medium is the supernatant of end-logarithmic phase cultures of WEHI-3B cells (ATCC number TIB-68). BaF3 cells expressing dexamethasone-inducible Cis were described previously (BF-Cis) (23Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kigushi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). These cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding wild-type or mutated Epo receptors and selected for their ability to grow in Epo as described previously (35Gobert S. Porteu F. Pallu S.

Before each experiment, BF-Cis cells were cultured 15 h in RPMI 1640 medium complemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 0.3% WEHI, and 100 nm dexamethasone to induce Cis expression. Several mutants of the Epo receptor were used throughout this study (see Fig. 1). These mutants have been previously described (17Gobert S. Chrétien S. Gouilleux F. Muller O. Pallard C.

All of these constructs were inserted in a modified pCDNA 3 vector in which the cytomegalovirus promoter was exchanged for a Rous sarcoma virus promoter. Exponentially growing hematopoietic cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized by boiling in electrophoresis sample buffer at a cell density of 5 × 106 cells/ml. Samples corresponding to 5 × 105 cells were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blot.

To determine which tyrosine of the Epo receptor binds to Cis, BF-Cis cells were transfected with the wild-type Epo receptor or with several mutants of the Epo receptor (Fig. 1). Because available anti-Epo receptor antibodies are poorly efficient in Western blot experiments, and because the tyrosine phosphorylation of some of the Epo receptor mutants is difficult to detect, we first used an indirect method to test the association of Cis with the Epo receptor (12Mayeux P. Dusanter-Fourt I. Muller O. Mauduit P. Sabbah M. Drucker B. Vainchencker W. Fischer S. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The cells were stimulated for 10 min with 2 units/ml 125I-Epo and solubilized. Cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Epo receptor antibodies, with anti-GST control antibodies, or with anti-Cis antibodies, and immunoprecipitated radioactivity was measured by γ counting. Immunoprecipitations using anti-Epo receptor antibodies showed that all transfected cells bound high amounts of125I-Epo. In contrast, these antibodies immunoprecipitated a very low amount of 125I-Epo in nontransfected cells. Because the same amount of 125I-Epo was also precipitated by anti-GST control antibodies, this low binding in nontransfected cells corresponded to nonspecific binding. As shown in Fig. 2, anti-Cis antibodies immunoprecipitated125I-Epo bound to the wild-type Epo receptor, but they did not precipitate Epo bound to an Epo receptor devoid of tyrosine residues in its intracellular domain (F1ΔY2–8). Moreover, these experiments showed an absolute requirement for the second tyrosine residue of the Epo receptor for Cis association. Indeed, Cis also associated with the F1Y2ΔY3–8 mutant receptor, but it did not associate with mutant Epo receptors, which did not possess this tyrosine residue. Interestingly, the single mutation of the second tyrosine residue of the intracellular domain of the Epo receptor (Tyr401) fully inhibited Cis binding to the Epo receptor (see mutant Y1F2Y3–8). To confirm this result, Epo receptor-transfected BF-Cis cells were stimulated with 10 units/ml unlabeled Epo and solubilized. Cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Cis antibodies and analyzed by Western blot using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3, Cis bound to the wild-type Epo receptor but not to the Y1F2Y3–8 Epo receptor mutant. Control immunoprecipitations made using anti-Epo receptor antibodies revealed that the wild-type Epo receptor and the Y1F2Y3–8 Epo receptor mutant were equally tyrosine phosphorylated after Epo stimulation.Figure 3The second tyrosine residue of the intracellular domain of the Epo receptor is required for association with Cis. BF-Cis cells expressing either the wild-type Epo receptor (WT (Y1–8)) or an Epo receptor with a Tyr401 → Phe mutation (Y1F2Y3–8) were incubated for 15 h with 100 nm dexamethasone to induce Cis expression. The cells were then stimulated for 10 min with 10 units/ml Epo and lysed using 1% Brij 96. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation (27,000 × g, 15 min), and cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Epo receptor antibodies (ER), with anti-Cis antibodies (Cis) or with anti-GST control antibodies (G). Immunoprecipitates from 5 × 106 cells (anti-Epo receptor antibodies) or from 20 × 106 cells (anti-Cis and anti-GST antibodies) were analyzed by Western blot using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Then, we investigated the association of Cis with the Epo receptor in the human UT-7 cells, which naturally express the Epo receptor. However, because Cis gene expression is regulated by STAT5, unstimulated cells do not contain any Cis protein. To induce Cis gene expression, UT-7 cells were prestimulated for 1.5 h with a low level (2.5 ng/ml) of GM-CSF. Cells were then stimulated for 10 min with 10 units/ml Epo, and the cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Cis antibodies. Western blot using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 4 A) showed that the Epo receptor was also immunoprecipitated with Cis in UT-7 cells. To overcome the requirement of STAT5 activation by a cytokine receptor to induce the expression of the endogenous Cis gene, we produced a UT-7 cell line expressing Cis under the control of a constitutive SRα promoter. These cells were selected and grown in the presence of SCF, which does not activate STAT5 in UT-7 cells (38Pallard C. Gouilleux F. Bénit L. Cocault L. Souyri M. Levy D. Groner B. Gisselbrecht S. Dusanter-Fourt I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2847-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). UT-7 cells expressing Cis (Cl8 cells) as well as UT-7 cells that did not express Cis (Cl20 cells) were stimulated for 10 min with 10 units/ml Epo and solubilized. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the Epo receptor was also immunoprecipitated by anti-Cis antibodies in cellular extracts of UT-7 Cl8 cells. Anti-Cis antibodies recognized several proteins in both transfected cells and in cells naturally expressing the Cis protein. Indeed, although the theoretical molecular mass of Cis is 29 kDa, Western blots revealed the expression of two main Cis proteins with apparent molecular masses of 32 and 37 kDa and a minor species of 45–47 kDa molecular mass (23Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kigushi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). To study the relationship between these proteins, we performed a transcription-translation experiment, and we compared the size of the in vitro Cis translated protein with that of the Cis proteins expressed in COS cells. The in vitro translated protein corresponded to the 32-kDa Cis protein (Fig. 5 A), thereby indicating that the 37-kDa Cis protein resulted from post-translation modifications. Considering these molecular masses and the quick degradation of Cis, an attractive hypothesis would be that Cis was a ubiquitinated protein. To test this hypothesis, Cis proteins were immunoprecipitated from Cis-transfected COS cells using anti-Cis antibodies and analyzed by Western blot using anti-ubiquitin antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5 B, anti-ubiquitin antibodies recognized the 37-kDa form of Cis. Reprobing the blot with anti-Cis antibodies evidenced both the 37- and 32-kDa forms of Cis. Similar results were obtained using another anti-ubiquitin antibody fromZymed (data not shown). Because ubiquitinated proteins are often degraded through the proteasome pathway, we tested the effects of the proteasome inhibitors LLnL and lactacystin (39Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 807-847Crossref Scopus (2232) Google Scholar) on the expression of the Cis protein. As shown in Fig. 5, C and D, the proteasome inhibitors induced the accumulation of the 37-kDa Cis protein in UT-7 Cl8 cells and in BF-Cis cells. To confirm that the accumulation of the 37-kDa form of Cis was attributable to the inhibition of Cis degradation and not to an increase of its synthesis induced by the proteasome inhibitors, we blocked the protein synthesis in UT-7 Cl8 cells using 0.5 mm cycloheximide (40Mayeux P. Casadevall N. Muller O. Lacombe C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 E, the 37-kDa form of Cis was undetectable in cells incubated for 30 min with cycloheximide, and the amount of the 32-kDa form of Cis was strongly decreased. These results confirm that the half-life of Cis was very short. In contrast, when the cells were incubated with both proteasome inhibitors and cycloheximide, the amount of Cis protein remained unchanged during the 30 min of incubation, demonstrating that proteasome inhibitors inhibited the degradation of Cis. Because Cis is a ubiquitinated protein that is protected from degradation by proteasome inhibitors, we tested the effects of LLnL on the activation of the target of Cis, the Epo receptor. As reported in Fig. 6 A, LLnL did not modify the activation of the Epo receptor. Indeed, LLnL neither induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of the Epo receptor in the absence of Epo nor modified the level of activation of the Epo receptor during the first 10 min of Epo stimulation. In contrast, LLnL strongly inhibited the dephosphorylation of the Epo receptor after a long-term incubation. As shown in Fig. 6 A, Epo receptor phosphorylation was not decreased after 90 min of Epo stimulation in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor, whereas it returned to basal level at this time in untreated cells. Similar effects were observed concerning the kinetics of STAT5 activation (Fig. 6 B). Lactacystin, another proteasome inhibitor, also protected the Epo receptor and STAT5 from inactivation with identical efficiency as LLnL (data not shown). Thus, the proteasome is involved in the inactivation of both the Epo receptor and STAT5. The association kinetics of Cis with the tyrosine-phosphorylated Epo receptor was studied using UT-7 Cl8 cells (Fig. 7 A). In the absence of proteasome inhibitors, the association between Cis and the Epo receptor was maximal after 10 min of Epo stimulation and started to decrease thereafter to become nearly undetectable after 2 h of Epo stimulation. In the presence of proteasome inhibitors, the association between Cis and the Epo receptor remained constant throughout the two hours of Epo stimulation. Fig. 7 A also shows that the level of Epo receptor associated with Cis was strongly increased by proteasome inhibitors. To confirm this result, UT-7 Cl8 cells were stimulated for 10 min with Epo, and the Cis-Epo receptor complexes were immunoprecipitated using a saturating concentration of anti-Cis antibodies. Cis-depleted extracts were then immunoprecipitated using anti-Epo receptor antibodies. Fig. 7 B shows that ∼10% of the tyrosine-phosphorylated Epo receptors were found associated with Cis in the absence of proteasome inhibitors, whereas 50% of the Epo receptors were associated with Cis in the presence of LLnL. Similar results were obtained using lactacystin (data not shown). Thus, proteasome inhibitors induced the accumulation of Cis-Epo receptor complexes. Cis belongs to a family of proteins that to date comprises four members in addition to Cis (SOCS1, also called JAB or SS1, SOCS2, also called Cis2, SOCS3 also called Cis3, and Cis4). Cis, SOCS1, SOCS2, and SOCS3 are composed of 210–260 amino acids, and they exhibit a similar structure with an Src homology 2 domain located in the middle of the protein and a conserved motif of ∼40 amino acids (the SOCS box) located at the C-terminal part of the molecules. Cis4 possesses a longer N-terminal region of ∼380 amino acids (41Masuhara M. Sakamoto H. Matsumoto A. Suzuki R. Yasukawa H. Mitsui K. Wakioka T. Tanimura S. Sasaki A. Misawa H. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Yoshimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). At least two of these proteins, Cis and SOCS1, appear to be involved in a negative feedback regulation process that controls the activation of several cytokine receptors. Indeed, the syntheses of Cis and SOCS1 are controlled by STAT5 and STAT3 transcription factors, respectively, and overexpression of these proteins leads to a decreased activation of these transcription factors in cytokine-stimulated cells. Moreover, Cis overexpression decreases the cell proliferation induced by Epo or IL-3, and SOCS1 overexpression inhibits the macrophage differentiation of M1 cells induced by IL-6. However, Cis and SOCS1 appear to have different targets. Indeed, it has been shown that SOCS1 associates with the tyrosine-phosphorylated Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2 tyrosine kinases (25Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K. Matsumoto A. Tanimura S. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyazaki T. Leonor N. Taniguchi T. Fujita T. Kanakura Y. Komiya S. Yoshimura A.

Kishimoto T. Nature. 1997; 387: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). This association involves the kinase domain (JH1) of the Jak kinases and induces a decrease of the kinase activity. In contrast, Cis associates with the Epo and the IL-3 receptors (23Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kigushi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) and not with Jaks (25Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K. Matsumoto A. Tanimura S. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyazaki T. Leonor N. Taniguchi T. Fujita T. Kanakura Y. Komiya S. Yoshimura A. Nature. 1997; 387: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Moreover, SOCS1 rapidly reduced IL-6-induced gp130 tyrosine phosphorylation (26Naka T. Narazaki M. Hirata M. Matsumoto S. Minamoto S. Aono A. Nishimoto N. Kajita T. Taga T. Yoshizaki K. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1997; 387: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar), whereas we did not observe a decrease of Epo receptor phosphorylation in UT-7 Cl8 cells at the early times of Epo stimulation (data not shown). Our results show that the 37-kDa form of Cis is a ubiquitinated protein, which seems to be quickly degraded by the proteasome pathway (Fig. 5). Indeed, the 37-kDa form was directly recognized by anti-ubiquitin antibodies, and two different proteasome inhibitors induced the intracellular accumulation of the 37-kDa form of Cis. Although protein degradation by the proteasome usually requires the polyubiquitination of the target protein, previous reports have shown that monoubiquitinated α-globin was also degraded by the proteasome (42Shaeffer J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22205-22210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Shaeffer J.R. Kania M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4015-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, the 37-kDa form of Cis could be another example of a monoubiquitinated protein degraded through the proteasome pathway. A 45-kDa form of Cis was also previously described (23Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kigushi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Although we did not detect this protein in most experiments, we sometimes observed a faint band at 45 kDa in anti-Cis antibody Western blots using proteins from transfected COS cells. Interestingly, this band was also faintly stained with anti-ubiquitin antibodies, suggesting that this minor form was also ubiquitinated and that polyubiquitinated forms of Cis could also occur. A plausible explanation would be that these polyubiquitinated forms could be the target of the proteasomes but are trimmed down by ubiquitin isopeptidases when the proteolytic activity of the proteasome was blocked. The ubiquitination of Cis and its degradation by the proteasome could account for the previously reported short half-life of the protein. In contrast to Cis synthesis, which requires the activation of STAT5, Cis degradation does not seem to be regulated by the activation of the cytokine receptors, because it was evident both in nonstimulated cells (Fig. 5) and in Epo-stimulated cells (Fig. 7). We show that Cis associates with the second tyrosine residue (Tyr401) of the intracellular domain of the Epo receptor (Figs. 2 and 3). This tyrosine residue is one of the major activation sites for STAT5 (17Gobert S. Chrétien S. Gouilleux F. Muller O. Pallard C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Groner B. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2434-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 18Klingmuller U. Bergelson S. Hsiao J.G. Lodish H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that Cis decreased the transcription of STAT5 target genes (24Matsumoto A. Masuhara M. Mitsui K. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyajima A. Yoshimura A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A possible explanation would be that STAT5 and Cis compete for binding to the same tyrosine residue of the Epo receptor. However, this explanation seems unlikely, because in the absence of Tyr401, complete STAT5 activation could also be achieved through Tyr343 of the Epo receptor (10Damen J.E. Wakao H. Miyajima A. Krosl J. Humphries K.R. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5557-5568Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar,17Gobert S. Chrétien S. Gouilleux F. Muller O. Pallard C. Dusanter-Fourt I.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4174-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and this tyrosine residue does not associate with Cis. Moreover, in the absence of proteasome inhibitors, the fraction of tyrosine-phosphorylated Epo receptors associated with Cis is rather low (Fig. 7 B), suggesting that most Tyr401 residues are probably available for STAT5 activation. Alternatively, Cis could decrease the activation of STAT5 by inducing the inactivation of the Epo receptor through the proteasome pathway. Indeed, the proteasome inhibitors LLnL and lactacystin inhibited the inactivation of the Epo receptor and STAT5 that naturally occurred after a long-term Epo stimulation. The fraction of the Epo receptor associated with Cis was strongly increased in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, and these complexes accumulated in the cells treated with proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 7). An attractive hypothesis would be that Cis targets the Epo receptor for degradation. It has been previously reported that the degradation of the IL-3 receptor β chain required its ligand-induced phosphorylation (45Mui A.L.F. Kay R.J. Humphries K. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10812-10816Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This mechanism is consistent with the hypothesis that Cis, which binds to the tyrosine-phosphorylated Epo and IL-3 receptors, could be responsible for the degradation of these receptors and for the termination of the activation process. In a recent paper, Yu and Burakoff (46Yu C.L. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14017-14020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have shown that the proteasome pathway regulates the IL-2-stimulated Jak-STAT pathways, although neither STAT nor Jak appears to be ubiquitinated. Because IL-2 was also shown to induce Cis gene expression (23Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kigushi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), it would be interesting to determine whether Cis also binds to the activated IL-2 receptor and whether it could be responsible for the reported effects. Part of the dephosphorylation of the Epo receptor has been previously attributed to the activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and to its binding to both the Epo receptor and the Jak2 tyrosine kinase (21Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.C. Lodish H.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar,22Jiao H. Berrada K. Yang W. Tabrizi M. Platanias L.C. Yi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6985-6992Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Our experiments show that another Epo receptor inactivation process involves the proteasomes. Thus, at least two mechanisms could account for the termination of the Epo receptor signaling; the dephosphorylation of Jak2 by the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and the inactivation of the receptor by the proteasomes. The relationship between each inactivation process has now to be studied in the aim of understanding the relative importance of each mechanisms. We thank Boehringer Mannheim and Kirin Brewery for the generous provision of recombinant Epo and recombinant SCF, respectively."

We reported previously that paclitaxel can induce interleukin (IL)-8 promoter activation in subgroups of ovarian cancer through the activation of both AP-1 and nuclear factor κB. Further analysis of paclitaxel analogs indicates that the degree of IL-8 induction by analysis correlates with the extent of cell death; however, IL-8 itself is not the cause of cell death. This suggests that pathways that lead to IL-8 and cell death may overlap, although IL-8 per se does not kill tumor cells.To decipher the upstream signals for paclitaxel-induced transcriptional activation and cell death, we studied the involvement of protein kinases that lead to the activation of AP-1, specifically the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK1), p38, and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1). The role of IκB in paclitaxel-induced cell death was also analyzed. Paclitaxel activated JNK, and to a lesser degree p38, but not ERK1. Paclitaxel-induced IL-8 promoter activation was inhibited by dominant-inhibitory mutants of JNK, p38, and the super-repressor form of IκBα, but not by dominant-inhibitory forms of ERK1. Dominant-inhibitory mutants of JNK1 also greatly reduced paclitaxel-induced cell death, and the kinetics of JNK induction was closely followed by DNA fragmentation. These results indicate (i) that paclitaxel activates the JNK signaling pathway and (ii) that JNK activation is a common point of paclitaxel-induced gene induction and cell death.

Furthermore, paclitaxel significantly inhibited the angiogenic response induced by tumor cell supernatant in mice (7Belotti D. Rieppi M. Nicoletti M.I. Casazza A.M. Fojo T. Taraboletti G. Giavazzi R.

The primary mechanism of action of paclitaxel is attributed to its ability to bind microtubules and to prevent their disassembly. However, the effect of paclitaxel exceeds that of conventional microtubule-disrupting agents, and there is increasing evidence that paclitaxel has multiple cellular effects in addition to the blockage of mitosis (9Bogdan C.

One of the effects of paclitaxel is to alter gene expression. In murine macrophages, paclitaxel can induce the expression of a series of lipopolysaccharide-inducible cytokines, such as IL1-1α, IL-1β, TNF-α, and interferon-inducible protein 10 (9Bogdan C.

Med. 1993; 122: 374-381PubMed Google Scholar). In human monocytes, paclitaxel also induces cytokine synthesis (17White C.M. Martin B.K. Lee L.-F. Haskill S.J. Ting J.P.-Y. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1998; 46: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Most pertinent to this report, paclitaxel can induce IL-8 gene expression at the transcriptional levels in subsets of human ovarian cancer lines (14Lee L.-F. Lofquist A.K. Schurer-Maly C.-C. Day C. Ting J.P.-Y. White C.M. Martin B.K. Haskill J.S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1303-1308PubMed Google Scholar). This induction is mediated by the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors, which bind to cognate sites in the IL-8 promoter. Gel shift assays show that paclitaxel caused a marked increase in protein binding to AP-1 and NF-κB cognate sequences in paclitaxel-responsive cells but not in nonresponsive cells (15Lee L.-F. Haskill J.S. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Ting J.P.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5097-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the upstream signaling events that lead to the activation of these transcription factors in response to paclitaxel. The present study identifies upstream signals that are activated by paclitaxel and mediate its effects. Identification of upstream signals involved in IL-8 gene induction may have broad ramifications because a tight correlation between the ability of paclitaxel analogs to induce IL-8 and cell death among ovarian tumors has been observed previously (18Watson J.M. Kingston D.G.I. Chordia M.D. Rinehart C.A. Haskill S.J. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 41: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is important to determine if the same signals that induce IL-8 gene induction also induce cell killing. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are serine/threonine kinases that mediate numerous types of extracellular stimuli (19Winston B.W. Remigio L.K. Riches D.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). The ERK member of MAPK is activated by growth factor via a Ras-dependent signal transduction pathway (21Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). ERK can phosphorylate and activate various transcription factors, including c-Myc and TCF/Elk1 (22Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R.

The activation of the JNK cascade is also observed in cells stimulated by various mitogenic factors such as growth factors, oncogenic Ras, phorbol ester, and T-cell activation signaling (32Karin M.

Like MAPK, JNK activation requires phosphorylation at two conserved residues, threonine and tyrosine, by the MAP kinase kinase SEK1/MKK4/JNK kinase (34Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). The latter is in turn phosphorylated by upstream kinase MAPK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) (32Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 35Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The JNK kinase cascade was shown to be a common pathway involved in cell proliferation and stress-response signaling. There are at least three major transcription factors that can be phosphorylated by JNK: c-Jun (36Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar), ATF-2 (37Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J.

Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that JNK is strongly activated by paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent. The activation of JNK occurs in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The inhibition of JNK activity greatly reduced paclitaxel-induced IL-8 gene expression and cell death, whereas the inhibition of p38 produced a smaller but noticeable effect. These results show the involvement of JNK and p38 in paclitaxel-induced IL-8 transcription activation and in mediating cell death, both of which have anti-tumor affects. The human ovarian cancer cell line OVCA 420 (a gift from Dr. Robert Bast, Jr., M. D.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5097-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 100-mm plates (Falcon Inc., Plymouth, U. K.) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% endotoxin-free fetal bovine serum until the cells were 60–75% confluent. Immediately before treatment the medium was removed, then cells were washed once with sterile endotoxin-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and treated with paclitaxel or the diluent, Me2SO stock. Paclitaxel was maintained at −70 °C at a concentration of 30 mm. The final concentration of Me2SO never exceeded 0.1%. Cells from the human ovarian cancer OVCA 420 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) (45Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). The transfection mixture was removed 6 h after treatment. The cells were incubated in complete medium for 6 h and then treated with Me2SO or paclitaxel for 24 h. Cell extract was prepared, and CAT enzymatic activity was assayed as described elsewhere (46Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-448Google Scholar, 47Oliveira I.C. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5300-5308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To address variations in transfection efficiency, each construct was tested using at least two separate plasmid preparations in three independent experiments. These multiple experiments were intended to eliminate experiment-to-experiment variations in transfection efficiency. Nuclear extracts from OVCA 420 cells were prepared as described previously (48Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (49Itoh-Lindstrom Y. Peterlin B.M. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20978-20986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). 4–6 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 50,000–100,000 cpm of 32P end-labeled DNA probe in a 20-μl reaction volume. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, the complex was subjected to electrophoresis in a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 1× Tris-glycine. Antibody supershift experiments were performed by preincubating 1 μg of antibody for 2 h on ice with each binding reaction before the addition of the DNA probe. The cell extract from OVCA 420 cells that were transfected with mutant kinase-expressing vector was prepared in 1 ml of RIPA lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 100 units/ml aprotinin). The cell lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min. Cellular debris was pelleted at 3,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG (5 μg/ml) antibody and then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-JNK1 (1.2 μg/ml), anti-p38 (1.2 μg/ml), and control antibodies using standard techniques (51Chin K.C. Li G. Ting J.P.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2501-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 105 cells were plated onto 24-well plates the day before stimulation. Cells were incubated with paclitaxel for different time intervals. The cells were harvested and treated with lysis buffer. The lysate was separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by centrifugation. 20 μl of the supernatant, which contained the cytoplasmic fraction, was used to measure DNA fragmentation and histone release from the nucleus. The measurement was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol for the Cell Death Detection ELISAplus kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Briefly, the supernatants were placed in streptavidin-coated microtiter plates followed by the addition of biotin-labeled anti-histone and peroxidase-conjugated anti-DNA antibodies. The anti-histone antibody, bound to the plate via biotin-streptavidin, also bound histones from released nucleosomes. The anti-DNA antibodies recognized DNA in the nucleosomes and gave a colorimetric reaction upon the addition of a photometric substrate, 2,2′-azino-di[3-ethylbenzthiazolin-sulfonate] (52Bonfoco E.

Physiol. 1995; 164: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). OVCA 420 cells were plated 24 h before transfection at a density of 2 × 103 cells/well in a 12-well plate. Cells were cotransfected with the pCMV-βgal (0.1 μg) plasmid, which expresses galactosidase and the plasmids containing the super-repressor IκBα, dominant-inhibitory mutant kinase (1 μg), or a control vector using the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Transfections were performed in duplicate. 6 h after transfection, the cell medium was replaced with fresh complete medium for 12 h, and then the cells were treated with 30 μm paclitaxel or Me2SO. After 24 h of treatment, cells were harvested, washed, and fixed in 0.5% glutaldehyde in PBS. These cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in staining solution containing PBS (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmK4Fe(CN)6, 10 mmK3Fe(CN)6, and 1 mm X-gal (added just before use) for 1–3 h, and washed twice with PBS. The β-galactosidase-positive cells in each well were counted. Cell survival was determined as the number of blue cells in paclitaxel-treated group/number of blue cells in Me2SO-treated group × 100%. After paclitaxel or Me2SO treatment, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 900 μl of low salt buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysate was mixed in 4 °C for 15 min and centrifuged at 12,500 rpm for 12 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a clean tube, and 50 μg of protein was incubated with 10 μg of GST-c-Jun (1–79) beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed twice with the lysis buffer and twice with the kinase assay buffer (1× kinase assay buffer: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerolphosphate containing 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol). Kinase reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 μl of 7 × kinase buffer, 0.133 μl of cold 10 mm ATP, 1 μl of [γ-32 P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol), and H2O to a final volume of 35 μl, incubated for 20 min at 30 °C, and terminated with 7 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, centrifuged at 12,500 rpm for 5 min, and then the supernatant was resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and then dried. The phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun was visualized by autography. Immunocomplex kinase assays were carried out as described (54Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar) with some modifications. MAPKs were precipitated by incubation with protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) and specific antibodies (e.g.anti-JNK1, anti-p38, or anti-ERK1 antibody) in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 mNaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, 100 units/ml aprotinin) for 4 h at 4 °C on a rocket platform. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Brij 35, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.15m NaCl) and then mixed with 5 μg of the indicated substrates and 10 μl of ATP mix (930 μl of kinase buffer, 6 μl of 50 μm ATP, pH 7.0, 20 μl of 2.0 mMgCl2, and 44 μl of [γ-32 P]ATP at 10 mCi/ml before an incubation for 20 min at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated with SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The supernatants were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The p38 assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction for the p38 MAPK assay (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). Briefly, after immunoprecipitation of p38 MAPK with anti-p38 antibody (1:50 to 1:100 dilution), the immunocomplex was incubated with ATF-2 and 200 μm cold ATP in kinase buffer. Kinase reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min and terminated with SDS sample buffer. The products were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Samples were analyzed by a Western blot using a phospho-specific ATF-2 antibody (1:1,000 dilution). Protein bands on immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemical luminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In a previous report, we showed that paclitaxel activates DNA binding through the AP-1 factor in human OVCA 420 cells (15Lee L.-F. Haskill J.S. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Ting J.P.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5097-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The results are confirmed as shown in Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2. Paclitaxel-induced binding was specifically competed by an excess of wild-type unlabeled AP-1 target site but not by an oligonucleotide containing point mutations, which resulted in the loss of AP-1 binding (lanes 3 and 4). Anti-c-Jun and anti-c-Fos antibodies were used in supershift assays. The results show that an anti-c-Jun antibody specifically diminished this DNA-protein complex, but a control normal rabbit serum had no effect (lanes 5 and 6). Antibody directed against c-Fos protein had a small effect and decreased binding to the level of the Me2SO control reproducibly. Results from the cold competition and supershift assays indicate that the DNA-protein complex formed in response to paclitaxel contained c-Jun and probably c-Fos (Fig. 1). Because paclitaxel activates c-Jun but JNK1 activates and phosphorylates c-Jun, the effect of paclitaxel on JNK activation is worthy of investigation. A kinetics analysis of kinase activation by paclitaxel was first performed. The activities of JNK, ERK, and p38 in the cell lysates were determined by an immunocomplex kinase assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 2 A, the activation of JNK1 activity was observed at the earliest measured time point of 30 min at a concentration of 30 μm paclitaxel. Importantly, this time course is coincidental with the transcriptional activation of the IL-8 gene by paclitaxel (14Lee L.-F. Lofquist A.K. Schurer-Maly C.-C. Day C. Ting J.P.-Y. White C.M. Martin B.K. Haskill J.S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1303-1308PubMed Google Scholar). p38-MAPK and ERK1 activity increased slightly (<1.5 fold) (Fig. 2 A). Others have encountered difficulties in observing p38 activation. 2S. E. Earp, personal communications. To exclude the possibility that the absence of a significant p38 activation by paclitaxel was caused by nonfunctional antibody or substrate, an activity assay was performed. A specific antibody to p38 MAPK was used to immunoprecipitate p38 from cell lysates selectively. The resulting immunoprecipitate was incubated with a preparation of ATF-2 fusion protein in the presence of cold ATP and kinase buffer. The phosphorylation of ATF-1 at Thr-71 was measured by Western blotting using a phospho-specific ATF-2 (Thr) antibody. Paclitaxel treatment did not increase ATF phosphorylation relative to the Me2SO control as detected by this assay. The positive control consists of KCl-activated cells (Fig. 2 B, far right lane). This indicates that the small increase in p38 observed in Fig. 2 A is not caused by the assay conditions, but likely reflects the small magnitude of response. Experiments were performed to determine if paclitaxel activates JNK in a dose-dependent manner. The results show that the activation of JNK1 activity to varying magnitude (4.0–6.0-fold) was observed with as little as 0.1 μmpaclitaxel (Fig. 3 A). This level of paclitaxel which induced JNK is easily obtainable during chemotherapy. To extend the dose-response analysis, lower concentrations of paclitaxel were used (Fig. 3 B), but these did not activate JNK. In contrast, ERK1 was not strongly activated by paclitaxel. A slight induction of p38 was reproducibly seen at a concentration of 3 μm paclitaxel in three experiments (Fig. 3 A). The concentration of paclitaxel required to activate JNK is lower than that required to induce IL-8 gene expression (previously observed at 5–30 μm paclitaxel). This suggests that paclitaxel can induce JNK activation efficiently and that the induction of other factors necessary for IL-8 transcription may require a higher concentration of paclitaxel. To assess directly the involvement of JNK or p38 in IL-8 promoter activation by paclitaxel, dominant-inhibitory mutants were used. OVCA 420 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged dominant-inhibitory mutants of JNK and p38 (pcDNA3-FLAG-JNK1(APF) and pCMV-Flag-p38(AGF)) (25Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J.

To elucidate the functional role of calsequestrin in vivo, transgenic mice were generated that overexpressed mouse cardiac calsequestrin in the heart. Overexpression (20-fold) of calsequestrin was associated with cardiac hypertrophy and induction of a fetal gene expression program. Isolated transgenic cardiomyocytes exhibited diminished shortening fraction (46%), shortening rate (60%), and relengthening rate (60%). The Ca2+ transient amplitude was also depressed (45%), although the SR Ca2+storage capacity was augmented, as suggested by caffeine application studies. These alterations were associated with a decrease in L-type Ca2+ current density and prolongation of this channel's inactivation kinetics without changes in Na+-Ca2+ exchanger current density. Furthermore, there were increases in protein levels of SR Ca2+-ATPase, phospholamban, and calreticulin and decreases in FKBP12, without alterations in ryanodine receptor, junctin, and triadin levels in transgenic hearts. Left ventricular function analysis in Langendorff perfused hearts and closed-chest anesthetized mice also indicated depressed rates of contraction and relaxation of transgenic hearts. These findings suggest that calsequestrin overexpression is associated with increases in SR Ca2+ capacity, but decreases in Ca2+-induced SR Ca2+ release, leading to depressed contractility in the mammalian heart.

In cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)1 plays an essential role in the regulation of the cytosolic free Ca2+concentration. There are three major functions of the SR: (a) Ca2+ uptake from the cytosol into the SR lumen, resulting in muscle relaxation; (b) Ca2+storage in the SR lumen; and (c) Ca2+ release from the SR into the cytosol, resulting in muscle contraction. The main SR proteins responsible for these functions are the Ca2+transport ATPase, the Ca2+ storage protein calsequestrin (1Yano K. Zarain-Herzberg A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and the Ca2+ release channel or ryanodine receptor, respectively. Phospholamban is another SR protein that plays a crucial role in the modulation of myocardial contractility and relaxation (2Koss K.L. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar).Recent studies with isolated human myocardial preparations suggested that the impaired Ca2+ handling of the SR may be an important subcellular mechanism contributing to the depressed contractility in heart failure (3Hasenfuss G. Reinecke H. Studer R. Pieske B. Meyer M. Drexler H. Just H. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1996; 91 Suppl. 2: 17-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wankerl M. Schwartz K. J. Mol.

However, it is still controversial whether the expression levels of SR Ca2+-handling proteins are altered in failing human hearts. Some groups have reported alterations in mRNA levels and/or protein expression levels of SR Ca2+-ATPase, phospholamban, and the SR Ca2+ release channel in human heart failure (3Hasenfuss G. Reinecke H. Studer R. Pieske B. Meyer M. Drexler H. Just H. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1996; 91 Suppl. 2: 17-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hasenfuss G. Meyer M. Schillinger W. Preuss M. Pieske B.

Res. 1993; 72: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). However, other groups observed no significant changes in the expression levels of these proteins in hearts with end-stage heart failure (8Movsesian M.A. Karimi M. Green K. Jones L.R. Circulation. 1994; 90: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 9Schwinger R.H.G. Böhm M. Schmidt U. Karczewski P. Bavendiek U. Flesch M. Krause E.G. Erdmann E. Circulation. 1995; 92: 3220-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in all studies, the calsequestrin expression levels appeared to be unaltered. These findings suggest that calsequestrin expression is under specific and rigid regulation in cardiac muscle. However, the physiological significance of the apparent tight control of calsequestrin expression is not known.There are currently two different calsequestrin genes, encoding for the cardiac and fast-skeletal muscle products. The cardiac isoform of calsequestrin is highly conserved among species (1Yano K. Zarain-Herzberg A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and it is the only isoform expressed during cardiac development (10Mahony L. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15257-15265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Arai M. Otsu K. MacLennan D.H. Periasamy M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C614-C620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several laboratories (for review, see Ref. 12Sitsapesan R. Williams A.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have implicated calsequestrin, which binds Ca2+ with high capacity and low affinity, as a key player in the regulation of SR Ca2+ release. Actually, calsequestrin appears to be physically connected to the ryanodine receptor (13Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), and formation of a stable complex among calsequestrin, the ryanodine receptor, junctin, and triadin at the junctional SR has been proposed to be important for the operation of Ca2+release during cardiac muscle excitation-contraction coupling (14Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). However, it is not currently clear how calsequestrin buffers luminal Ca2+ in vivo, what is the buffering capacity of this protein in intact cells, and what are the direct or indirect effects of altered calsequestrin levels on SR Ca2+ load, ryanodine receptor gating, and myocardial contractility. Furthermore, the role of calsequestrin in the decreased amplitude of the intracellular Ca2+ transient in failing hearts, which may reflect a reduction in the amount of releasable Ca2+ from the SR (5Beuckelmann D.J. Nabauer M. Erdmann E. Circulation. 1992; 85: 1046-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 15Vahl C.F. Bonz A. Timek T. Hagl S. Circ.

Thus, this study was designed to elucidate the functional role of calsequestrin in cardiac physiology and/or pathophysiology by altering the expression levels of this protein in vivo using transgenesis. Cardiac-specific overexpression of calsequestrin resulted in increased SR Ca2+ storage capacity, but this SR Ca2+ was not available for release during excitation-contraction coupling, leading to a depressed amplitude of the Ca2+ transient in cardiomyocytes and depressed contractile parameters assessed in isolated myocytes, perfused hearts, and intact animals. This cardiac phenotype was accompanied by alterations in the expression levels of several key proteins and induction of a fetal gene program leading to cardiac hypertrophy.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe handling and maintenance of the animals in this study were approved by the ethics committee of the University of Cincinnati. 8–13-week-old mice of either sex were used for the following studies.Isolation of cDNA Encoding Mouse Cardiac CalsequestrinThe mouse cardiac 5′-stretch plus cDNA library (ML5002a; CLONTECH) was screened using a32P-labeled polymerase chain reaction product by a pUC/M13 forward primer (24-mer; Promega), a reverse primer corresponding to 60 nucleotides in the rabbit cardiac calsequestrin cDNA sequence (17Arai M.

The cDNA was excised from the bacteriophage DNA with NotI and subcloned into the pBluescript SK(−) vector (Stratagene), and DNA sequence analysis was performed by an automated DNA sequencer (Model 373A, Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems).Generation of Transgenic MiceA 2180-bp fragment encompassing 60 bp of 5′-untranslated region, the entire calsequestrin coding region, and 863 bp of 3′-untranslated region was generated using polymerase chain reaction methodology (flanked with SalI and EcoRV sites). This fragment was linked to the 3′-end of the mouse α-myosin heavy chain promoter and to the blunted 5′-end of the human growth hormone polyadenylation signal sequence (19Gulick J. Hewett T.E. Klevitsky R. Buck S.H. Moss R.L. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in pBluescript SK(+). The entire 8.3-kilobase NotI fragment was excised from the plasmid sequence and used for microinjection of fertilized mouse eggs (FVB/N). To identify transgenic mice, polymerase chain reaction analysis of tail genomic DNA was carried out using a forward primer corresponding to the 5′-end of the mouse α-myosin heavy chain gene sequence (5′-CACATAGAAGCCTAGCCCACAC-3′) and a reverse primer corresponding to the 5′-end of the mouse cardiac calsequestrin cDNA sequence (5′-TTCTTCTCAGAAAGGCTGACC-3′).Morphological StudiesHistological evaluation of the hearts was performed as described previously (18Chu G.

After equilibration in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) containing 1% bovine serum albumin, specimens were incubated with anti-cardiac calsequestrin antibody followed by fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). In control experiments, sections were stained with only fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Sections were mounted with 100% glycerol containing 0.0025% p-phenylenediamine, 0.25% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane, and 5% n-propyl gallate and examined using a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope.Dot-blot AnalysisDot-blot analysis of total RNA from cardiac ventricles was performed as described previously (21D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn G.W., II Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar).Quantitative ImmunoblottingMouse hearts were homogenized at 4 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium metabisulfite, 0.3 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mmEDTA, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor type II-S (Sigma), and 7 μg/ml pepstatin A. After solubilization of the homogenates, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (18Chu G. Luo W. Slack J.P. Tilgman C. Sweet W.E. Spindle M. Saupe K.W. Boivin G.P. Moravec C.S. Matlib M.A. Grupp I.L. Ingwall J.S. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1064-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For the quantitation of phospholamban, the solubilized samples were boiled for 5 min to fully dissociate the pentameric form of phospholamban into monomers. Binding of the primary antibody was detected by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard.Isolated CardiomyocytesLeft ventricular tissue was enzymatically digested to isolate individual myocytes, and measurements of myocyte mechanics and Ca2+ transients were performed at a pacing rate of 0.25 Hz as described previously (22Chu G. Dorn G.W., II Luo W. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Viability of myocytes from wild-type and transgenic mice after the isolation was ∼80 and 40%, respectively. Rod-shaped viable cells were selected for the experiments. To monitor intracellular free Ca2+transients, the cells were loaded with 7 μm Fura-2/AM, and fluorescent signals were measured (22Chu G. Dorn G.W., II Luo W. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the cells were perfused for 1 min with 0 Na+/0 Ca2+buffer containing 132 mm LiCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm EGTA (pH 7.3). Then, Ca2+ transients induced by caffeine (10 mm) were obtained in the absence of Na+ and Ca2+ to determine the SR Ca2+ capacity in myocytes (23Balaguru D. Haddock P.S. Puglisi J.L. Bers D.M.

Cell membrane capacitance was measured using voltage ramps of 0.8 V/s from a holding potential of −50 mV (24Masaki H. Sato Y. Luo W. Kranias E.G. Yatani A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H606-H612PubMed Google Scholar). Na+-Ca2+ exchanger currents were recorded by the method of Kimura et al. (25Kimura J. Miyamae S. Noma A. J. Physiol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4734-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).In Vivo Left Ventricular FunctionLeft ventricular contractile parameters were assessed in closed-chest anesthetized mice using a 1.4-French scale Millar catheter (27Hoit B.D. Ball N. Walsh R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2528-H2533PubMed Google Scholar). The hearts were paced at 300 beats/min, using a 1-French scale bipolar pacing wire advanced into the right atrium through the jugular vein.MaterialsGenerous gifts of materials included rabbit cardiac calsequestrin cDNA from Dr. M. Periasamy (University of Cincinnati), mouse α-myosin heavy chain promoter from Dr. J. Robbins (Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH), and rabbit polyclonal anti-junctin affinity-purified antibody (28Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) from Dr. L. R. Jones (Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN). Rabbit polyclonal anti-calsequestrin antibody was from SWant (Bellinzona, Switzerland). Monoclonal anti-triadin antibody (MA3-927), polyclonal anti-FKBP12 antibody (PA1-026), and the other primary antibodies were from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO).StatisticsData are presented as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were evaluated using Student's ttest, with significance imparted at the p < 0.05 level.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrated that overexpression of calsequestrin in the heart resulted in increases in SR Ca2+ storage capacity, but this pool of Ca2+ was not accessible for release, leading to attenuation of the Ca2+ transient and contractile parameters. This is the first evidence indicating that alterations in calsequestrin expression levels are associated with alterations in basal cardiac contractile parameters assessed at the cellular, organ, and intact animal levels.Cardiac-specific overexpression of calsequestrin was achieved using the α-myosin heavy chain promoter (38Subramaniam A. Jones W.K. Gulick J. Wert S. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24613-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cDNA encoding mouse cardiac calsequestrin to assure complete homology between the overexpressed and endogenous proteins. Calsequestrin overexpression (20-fold) resulted in mild left ventricular hypertrophy without substantial morphological abnormalities. Immunofluorescence labeling of calsequestrin in transgenic ventricular tissue was generally observed as transverse striations, indicating that the overexpressed protein was predominantly localized to terminal cisternae at the Z-lines, similar to endogenous calsequestrin. Thus, the SR lumen, unlike the SR membrane (39He H. Giordano F.J. Hilal-Dandan R. Choi D.J. Rockman H.A. McDonough P.M. Bluhm W.F. Meyer M. Sayen M.R. Swanson E. Dillmann W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 40Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), appears capable of accommodating relatively high levels of calsequestrin expression without significant architectural alterations in cell morphology. However, these findings differ from recent observations in a transgenic mouse model overexpressing lower levels (10-fold) of dog cardiac calsequestrin in the heart (41Jones L.R. Suzuki Y.J. Wang W. Kobayashi Y.M. Ramesh V. Franzini-Armstrong C. Cleeman L. Morad M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Introduction of the heterologous protein also resulted in cardiac hypertrophy, but there was elimination of clear striations in ventricular myocytes, suggesting disruption of normal ultrastructure.The hypertrophic response of our cardiac-specific calsequestrin-overexpressing mice was associated with induction of re-expression of a fetal gene program in the heart, particularly increases in atrial natriuretic factor, α-skeletal actin, and β-MHC transcripts. The increases in the expression of the slow MHC isoform (β-MHC) may be a contributing factor to the attenuation of contraction and relaxation rates in transgenic hearts. This depression in cardiac mechanics reflected a decrease in the amplitude of the Ca2+ transient, although the SR Ca2+ load was significantly increased as revealed by caffeine application. The apparent impairment of SR Ca2+ release in transgenic hearts may be due to (a) increased SR Ca2+-buffering capacity leading to lower intraluminal free Ca2+concentrations, which is associated with lower amounts of Ca2+ released (12Sitsapesan R. Williams A.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); (b) reduced Ca2+influx through L-type Ca2+ channels, due to their lower density, leading to a smaller activation of the Ca2+-induced SR Ca2+ release (the reduced SR Ca2+ release was also evidenced by the slow inactivation kinetics of L-type Ca2+ currents, which are regulated by the transient increase in the Ca2+ concentration of the microdomain between the L-type Ca2+ channel and the ryanodine receptor (24Masaki H. Sato Y. Luo W. Kranias E.G. Yatani A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H606-H612PubMed Google Scholar, 42Sham J.S. Cleemann L. Morad M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar)); (c) increased expression of calreticulin, which may also contribute to increased SR Ca2+ buffering and thus attenuation of the SR Ca2+ release mechanism; and (d) a defect in the coupling between L-type Ca2+ channels and ryanodine receptors in the hypertrophic transgenic cardiomyocytes, leading to a reduction in the ability of the L-type Ca2+ current to trigger SR Ca2+ release. Recently, defective excitation-contraction coupling without any changes in the densities of the L-type Ca2+ current and ryanodine receptors was observed in a rat model of cardiac hypertrophy, and this was proposed to contribute to decreases in Ca2+ transient amplitude (43Gómez A.M. Valdivia H.H. Cheng H. Lederer M.R. Santana L.F. Cannell M.B. McCune S.A. Altschuld R.A. Lederer W.J. Science. 1997; 276: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In the calsequestrin-overexpressing hearts, there were no significant alterations in the protein levels of ryanodine receptors, but the density of the L-type Ca2+ current was decreased, similar to previous observations in models of severe pressure-overload hypertrophy or cardiac infarction (44Nuss H.B. Houser S.R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1991; 23: 717-726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 45Santos P.E. Barcellos L.C. Mill J.G. Masuda M.O. J. Cardiovasc.

Furthermore, examination of the levels of junctin and an ∼95-kDa triadin isoform, which have been proposed to act as calsequestrin-“anchoring proteins” and to form a functional complex with the ryanodine receptor (14Zhang L.

Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), revealed no alterations. However, the levels of FKBP12 were significantly reduced in transgenic hearts, suggesting an important compensatory mechanism in an attempt to enhance the opening probability of the ryanodine receptors and to facilitate SR Ca2+ release, which may increase the amplitude of the cytosolic Ca2+ signal and contractility (39He H. Giordano F.J. Hilal-Dandan R. Choi D.J. Rockman H.A. McDonough P.M. Bluhm W.F. Meyer M. Sayen M.R. Swanson E. Dillmann W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The increased open probability of ryanodine receptors may be associated with activation of calcineurin and dephosphorylation of the transcription factor NF-AT3, leading to reprogramming of gene expression and hypertrophy (47Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar). Furthermore, down-regulation of FKBP12, which has been postulated to interact with and to inhibit the activity of transforming growth factor-β signaling (48Wang T. Li B.-Y. Danielson P.D. Shah P.C. Rockwell S. Lechleider R.J. Martin J. Manganaro T. Donahoe P.K. Cell. 1996; 86: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), may also contribute to development of cardiac hypertrophy through the transforming growth factor-β pathway. Treatment of the calsequestrin-overexpressing mice with cyclosporin (47Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar) may allow us to distinguish between these pathways for the hypertrophic response in this model.Assessment of the protein levels of the SR Ca2+-ATPase and its regulator phospholamban indicated that calsequestrin overexpression was associated with increases compared with wild-type littermates. It is interesting to note that the increases in the levels of these proteins were similar, suggesting that the maximal velocity of the SR Ca2+-ATPase activity was increased, without any changes in the affinity of this enzyme for Ca2+ (49Harrer J.M. Haghighi K. Kim H.W. Ferguson D.G. Kranias E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H57-H66PubMed Google Scholar). The increased maximal velocity of the SR Ca2+ pump probably constitutes an important compensatory response in an attempt to increase the amplitude of the Ca2+ transient in transgenic cardiomyocytes. Decreases in contractile parameters were also observed in intact hearts and in closed-chest animals. Reduction of left ventricular isovolumic parameters indicated that calsequestrin overexpression was uncompensated in vivo. Thus, the development of hypertrophy may provide an adaptive response to normalize contractile dysfunction in this animal model. However, induction of the fetal gene program and other compensatory responses, accompanying calsequestrin overexpression, make it rather difficult to assess the direct effects of altered calsequestrin levels on cardiac contractile parameters.In summary, our findings indicate that calsequestrin is a regulator of the cardiac SR Ca2+ storage capacity and the amount of Ca2+ available for release during excitation-contraction coupling. Thus, alterations in the expression levels of this protein would reflect alterations in the levels of cytosolic Ca2+and contractile parameters. The availability of transgenic models with altered expression of calsequestrin will facilitate further studies on elucidating the mechanism(s) by which calsequestrin buffers SR luminal Ca2+, the effect(s) of free luminal Ca2+ on SR Ca2+ release and ryanodine receptor gating properties, and the dynamic relationship between changes in SR luminal Ca2+and cytosolic Ca2+ levels during the contractile cycle. Such studies will greatly improve our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved in SR Ca2+ cycling and contractility in the mammalian myocardium. In cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)1 plays an essential role in the regulation of the cytosolic free Ca2+concentration. There are three major functions of the SR: (a) Ca2+ uptake from the cytosol into the SR lumen, resulting in muscle relaxation; (b) Ca2+storage in the SR lumen; and (c) Ca2+ release from the SR into the cytosol, resulting in muscle contraction. The main SR proteins responsible for these functions are the Ca2+transport ATPase, the Ca2+ storage protein calsequestrin (1Yano K. Zarain-Herzberg A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and the Ca2+ release channel or ryanodine receptor, respectively. Phospholamban is another SR protein that plays a crucial role in the modulation of myocardial contractility and relaxation (2Koss K.L. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Recent studies with isolated human myocardial preparations suggested that the impaired Ca2+ handling of the SR may be an important subcellular mechanism contributing to the depressed contractility in heart failure (3Hasenfuss G. Reinecke H. Studer R. Pieske B. Meyer M. Drexler H. Just H. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1996; 91 Suppl. 2: 17-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wankerl M. Schwartz K. J. Mol.

However, it is still controversial whether the expression levels of SR Ca2+-handling proteins are altered in failing human hearts. Some groups have reported alterations in mRNA levels and/or protein expression levels of SR Ca2+-ATPase, phospholamban, and the SR Ca2+ release channel in human heart failure (3Hasenfuss G. Reinecke H. Studer R. Pieske B. Meyer M. Drexler H. Just H. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1996; 91 Suppl. 2: 17-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hasenfuss G. Meyer M. Schillinger W. Preuss M. Pieske B.

However, other groups observed no significant changes in the expression levels of these proteins in hearts with end-stage heart failure (8Movsesian M.A. Karimi M. Green K. Jo"

Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) than about the functions of proteoglycans (PGs) during neural development and regeneration. PGs constitute a heterogeneous class of molecules, which comprise a protein core and at least one covalently linked sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain (9Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Each GAG chain consists of repeating disaccharide units, and the composition of these dimers and their sulfation patterns determine distinct GAG types. The resulting structural diversity is reflected in the different functions, which have been attributed to PGs during development and regeneration (for review see Refs. 1Letourneau P.C. Condic M.L. Snow D.M. Curr. Opin. Gen. & Dev. 1992; 2: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Grumet M. Friedlander D.R. Sakurai T. Perspect. Dev.

Chondroitin sulfate PGs like neurocan and phosphacan (12Rauch U. Gao P. Janetzko A. Flaccus A. Hilgenberg L. Tekotte H. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1991; 56: 706-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and the integral DSD-1-PG have been shown to promote neurite outgrowth (18Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and the latter to be expressed in areas of axonal growth (19Deller T. Haas C.A. Naumann T. Joester A. Faissner A. Frotscher M. Neuroscience. 1997; 81: 829-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Several lines of investigations suggest, however, that not only the core proteins but also the GAGs are involved in neural development. Thus, it has been reported that digestion of chondroitin sulfate by injection of chondroitinase ABC in vivo modifies the patterning and differentiation of retinal ganglion cells and their axonal projections during chick retina development (20Brittis P. Canning D. Silver J. Science. 1992; 255: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Along those lines, other studies suggest an influence of soluble GAGs on the establishment of neuronal polarity (21Lafont F. Rousselet A. Valenza C. Petitou M. Pascal M. Rouget M. Prochiantz A. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 453-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Lafont F. Rouget M. Triller A. Prochiantz A. Rousselet A. Development. 1992; 114: 17-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the promotion of neuronal survival (23Kappler J. Junghans U. Koops A. Stichel C.C. Hausser H.-J. Kresse H. Müller H.W. Eur. J.

In contrast to those findings, other studies have described either no or a stimulatory influence of chondroitin sulfate on neurite outgrowth (18Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 22Lafont F. Rouget M. Triller A. Prochiantz A. Rousselet A.

Masayama K. Faissner A. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3296-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These results are in agreement with the findings that chondroitin sulfates are up-regulated after lesion during the period of sciatic nerve regeneration (39Shum D.K.Y. Chau C.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 40Braunewell K.-H. Martini R. LeBaron R. Kresse H. Faissner A. Schmitz B. Schachner M. Eur. J.

Neurol. 1995; 134: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The divergence of results might have been caused by differences of the presentation of chondroitin sulfate and/or chondroitin sulfate PGs and by the use of distinct neuronal cell types. Additionally, chondroitin sulfates bear a considerable structural variability, which is presently not well understood. The basic disaccharide, which consists of glucuronic acid and N-acetylgalactosamine, can be modified by ester sulfation reactions at various positions. The chemical heterogeneity and the formation of defined structured motifs on singular chondroitin sulfate chains have been documented by several detailed studies (38Nadanaka S. Clement A. Masayama K. Faissner A. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3296-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 42Sugahara K. Nadanaka S. Takeda K. Kojima T. Eur. J.

In addition, studies with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against specific epitopes on chondroitin sulfate chains revealed restricted spatio-temporal patterns of expression in various tissues (44Sorrell J.M. Mahmoodian F. Schafer I.A. Davis B. Caterson B. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 45Mark M.P. Baker J.R. Kimata K. Ruch J.-V. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1990; 34: 191-204PubMed Google Scholar, 46Fernaud-Espinosa I. Nieto-Sampedro M. Bovolenta P. J. Neurobiol. 1996; 30: 410-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The regulation of chondroitin sulfate isoforms, which vary both in the degree and the positions of sulfation, is compatible with the mediation of distinct functions during development (46Fernaud-Espinosa I. Nieto-Sampedro M. Bovolenta P. J. Neurobiol. 1996; 30: 410-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One of these structures is the DSD-1 epitope, a chondroitin sulfate modification, which has been identified on the glial-derived DSD-1-PG using the specific mAb 473HD. The corresponding epitope could be detected in chondroitin sulfate C (CS-C) and CS-D preparations from shark cartilage but not in those of the other members of the chondroitin sulfate family (18Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 38Nadanaka S. Clement A. Masayama K. Faissner A. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3296-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Substrate-bound DSD-1-PG promotes neurite outgrowth of several neuronal types including hippocampal neurons. Perturbation studies using mAb 473HD or chondroitinase ABC indicated that this functional activity requires the presence of the DSD-1 epitope, suggesting that this epitope represents a functional GAG structure (18Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). To explore this concept, the structure-function relationship of the DSD-1 epitope, which is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, was investigated. We show here that chondroitin sulfate fractions containing the DSD-1 epitope promote neurite outgrowth of embryonic day 18 (E18) hippocampal neurons. This effect is directly correlated with the amount of substrate bound DSD-1 epitope-containing GAGs. Furthermore, recognition of the the DSD-1 epitope by mAb 473HD and the neurite outgrowth promotion by CS-D are dependent on the sulfation of the GAGs. This opens the possibility that sulfation patterns regulate the functional potential of chondroitin sulfates. For preparation of rat embryonic day 18 (E18) hippocampal neurons or mixed postnatal mouse cerebellar cultures, SD rats or NMRI mice were used, respectively. The animals were kept at the local facility (animal house of the University of Heidelberg, Zentralbereich Theoretikum, Heidelberg, Germany). Chondroitin sulfates preparations from the folowing biological sources were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan) or from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany): CS-A, bovine trachea; CS-B, bovine mucosa; CS-C and CS-D, shark cartilage; CS-E, squid cartilage. Proteinase-free preparations of chondroitinase ABC were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). Other chemicals, including cell culture media, were purchased from Sigma, Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), Life Technologies, Inc. (Eggenstein, Germany), or Boehringer Ingelheim Bioproducts (Heidelberg, Germany) unless specified otherwise. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 473HD, a rat IgM antibody directed against the DSD-1 epitope, and polyclonal rabbit IgG pDSD-1-PG antibodies (polyclonal antibody) were prepared as described previously (18Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar); mAb anti-tubulin (clone DM 1A) was purchased from Sigma; the secondary antibodies derivatized with fluorescein or horseradish peroxidase against rat IgM or rabbit IgG were obtained from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Protein A-Sepharose was purchased from Pharmacia (Freiburg, Germany). Rat hippocampal neuron cultures were established from E18 animals as described by Goslin and Banker (47Goslin K. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991: 251-281Google Scholar), with some modifications (48Kempf M. Clement A. Faissner A. Lee G. Brandt R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5583-5592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated on glass coverslips at low density (8,000–10,000 cells/cm2) and cultivated in minimal Eagle's medium (MEM) supplemented with the N2 mixture, namely 5 mg/ml insulin, 20 nm progesterone, 100 μm putrescine, and 30 nm selenite (49Bottenstein J.E. Sato G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar), and 0.1 mm pyruvate, 0.1% (w/v) ovalbumin, and 0.01% (w/v) apo-transferrin. The cultures were kept in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 36 °C. Glass coverslips were precoated with 15 μg/ml poly-dl-ornithine in 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 8.1, for 1 h, washed three times with double distilled H2O, and coated with 50 μl of 16 μg/ml chondroitin sulfates (total weight or 5 μg/ml as glucuronic acid equivalents (GlcUA)) in PBS overnight at 37 °C. Thereafter, the coverslips were washed three times with PBS and flooded with N2 medium. For antibody blocking experiments, mAb 473HD was added to the medium at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml for 1.5 h before plating the cells. The cultures were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with a tubulin monoclonal antibody as described (38Nadanaka S. Clement A. Masayama K. Faissner A. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3296-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Mixed cerebellar cultures were prepared as described elsewhere (50Schnitzer J. Schachner M. J. Neuroimmunol. 1981; 1: 471-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These and cultures of the oligodendroglial-derived cell line Oli-neu (51Jung M. Krämer E. Grzenkowski M. Tang K. Blakemore W. Aguzzi A. Khazie K. von Blankenfeld G. Kettenmann H. Trotter J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1245-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT, blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for at least 30 min at RT, and stained with mAb 473HD and pDSD-1-PG for 30 min at RT. The bound antibodies were detected with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rat IgM and goat anti-rabbit IgG, respectively (both 1:70 to 1:100 in blocking buffer). The stained hippocampal neurons were analyzed with a morphometric station (Leica, Bensheim, Germany; invert microscope, camera, Quantimed 500 MC). The length of the longest neurite was determined by drawing this process in the interactive mode of the program. Only cells with neurites longer than one neuronal cell body diameter were counted as neurite-bearing cells. The fractions of process forming neurons and the distribution of the longest neurites obtained under different experimental conditions were compared using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test in the SigmaStat program (SPSS Inc., Chicago). Purified DSD-1-PG was absorbed overnight on polyvinylpyrrolidone (Falcon) at 0.5 μg/ml as GlcUA in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.1, 100 μl/well. The wells were washed three times with PBS and blocked with 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS including 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h at RT. Subsequently, the polyvinylpyrrolidone plates were incubated with mAb 473HD (1–5 μg/ml final concentration) in blocking reagent for 1 h at RT. For competition studies, mAb 473HD was preincubated with different GAGs for 2 h at 37 °C at various concentrations (see “Results”) and added to the DSD-1-PG in the presence of soluble competitors. The plates were washed three times with PBST and incubated for 1 h at RT with specific anti-rat IgM secondary antibodies derivatized with horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:5,000 in blocking buffer. After three washes, the plates were developed with ABTS (52Faissner A. Kruse J. Neuron. 1990; 5: 627-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The colored reaction product was quantified with an ELISA reader (Titertek multiscan; Flow Laboratories, Meckenheim, Germany) at OD405 nm. Experiments were performed in triplicate. The percent inhibition was calculated as follows: % inhibition = ((ODtest − ODcontrol)/Odcontrol) × 100. For biosynthetic labeling of proteins or carbohydrates with [35S]methionine/cysteine (250 μCi/ml) or Na235SO4 (300 μCi/ml) (Amersham Buchler GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany), postnatal cerebellar cultures or Oli-neu cells were cultured in Na2SO4-free and methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 45 min. Thereafter, 7 mm sodium chlorate was added to the medium, and after a further 15 min either [35S]methionine/cysteine (250 μCi/ml) together with unlabeled Na2SO4 (10 μg/ml) or Na235SO4 (300 μCi/ml) together with unlabeled methionine and cysteine (each 30 μg/ml) was added to the cultures for 4 h. Subsequently, the supernatants were collected, and a mixture of proteinase inhibitors was added (benzamidine and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 1 mm; aprotinin, iodoacetamide, and pepstatin at 1 μg/ml). The cells were lysed for 20 min on ice in 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% BSA (w/v), pH 7.4, with added proteinase inhibitors. Supernatants and detergent extracts were cleared by consecutive rounds of centrifugation at 800 × g, 4 °C for 10 min and at 100,000 × g, 4 °C for 45 min. The immunoprecipitation was carried out as described (53Faissner A. Teplow D. Kübler D. Keilhauer G. Kinzel V. Schachner M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3105-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 ml of the cleared lysates or cell culture supernatants were mixed with 20 μg/ml mAb 473HD or 200 μg/ml pDSD-1-PG for at least 1 h or overnight at 4 °C. With the polyclonal antibody the aliquots were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 150 μl of preswollen protein A-Sepharose conjugate, whereas with the mAb 473HD aliquots were incubated with 150 μl of protein A-Sepharose preincubated with goat anti-rat IgM antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C (20 μg/ml final concentration). After several washes the Sepharose beads were resuspended in 100 μl of chondroitinase ABC digestion buffer (40 mm sodium acetate, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, pH 8.0, with protease inhibitors). Half of the material was supplemented with the same volume of 2-fold concentrated SDS sample buffer and separated on a 4–10% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The radioactive signals were monitored on an x-ray sensitive film (Amersham Buchler GmbH, Braunschweig) and developed with a Kodak x-ray developing machine (Kodak M35 X-Omat processor) or detected on a phosphorimager plate (Fuji, MacBas 100; RayTest, Straubenhardt, Germany). Different tissues of adult NMRI mice were homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, 60 mm octyl glucoside, pH 8.0, supplemented with a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (soybean trypsin inhibitor, antipain, aprotinin at 10 μm; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 5 μm; pepstatin and leupeptin at 2 μm). The homogenate was extracted for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle stirring and cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g, 4 °C for 1 h. The protein content of the extract was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay using BSA as a standard (Bio-Rad, München, Germany). For Western blot analysis 100 μg of protein were loaded per lane. SDS-PAGE was performed on 4–10% gradient gels (54Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred according to standard protocols (55Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 75: 4350-4354Crossref Scopus (44924) Google Scholar) on a nylon membrane (polyvinylidene difluoride; Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). Membranes were blocked with 4% (w/v) milk powder in PBST for 30 min at RT. MAb 473HD (1–3 μg/ml final concentration) diluted in blocking buffer was incubated for 1 h at RT. To detect the bound antibodies the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgM diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at RT. After washing (five times for 7 min with PBST), bound antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Kit, Amersham-Buchler). Glucuronic acid (GlcUA) concentrations were determined with a colorimetric assay usingm-hydroxydiphenyl (56Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (5968) Google Scholar) or carbazole (57Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5205) Google Scholar). CS-C or GlcUA were used as standards. CS-D was desulfated as described (58Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Kamata T. Carbohydr. Res. 1977; 58: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) by treating the pyridinium salt of the polysaccharide with 90% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide for 1, 2.5, and 5 h at 80 °C. The fractions were analyzed by HPLC. The efficiency of the reaction is shown in Table II.Table IIAnalysis of desulfated CS-D fractionsInhibition in competition ELISANeurite-bearing cells%%CS-D84 ± 0.761 ± 7.9 (−)DS 123 ± 352 ± 11.4 (NS)DS 26 ± 2.833 ± 8.92-a0.001 < p < 0.01.DS 312 ± 1.636 ± 11.22-b0.01 < p < 0.05.The pyridinium salt of CS-D was progressively desulfated by chemical procedures.

All values were done in triplicate. In addition, the desulfated CS-D preparations were tested as substrates for hippocampal neurons as described in Fig. 4, and the percentage of neurite-bearing cells was determined. The most desulfated preparation of CS-D could not promote neurite outgrowth as effectively as the less desulfated ones or unmodified CS-D, indicating that sulfation is necessary for mediating the neurite outgrowth promoting effect.

The radiolabeling of chondroitin sulfate chains was conducted by 3H-acetylation of N-deacetylated galactosamine residues by treating CS-D polysaccharides successively with hydrazine and then [3H]acetic anhydride (59Hook M.

In addition to a kinase-directed function of calmodulin to activate the kinase, a second calmodulin is required for the autophosphorylation of each Thr286 (Hanson, P. I., Meyer, T., Stryer, L., and Schulman, H. (1994) Neuron 12, 943–956). We have engineered heteromeric holoenzymes comprising distinct “kinase” and “substrate” subunits to test for kinase- and substrate-directed functions of calmodulin. The obligate kinase subunits have aspartate residues substituted for threonine at positions 286, 305, and 306 (the autophosphorylation and calmodulin-binding sites), making it constitutively active but unable to bind calmodulin. Obligate substrate subunits are catalytically inactive (K42M mutation) but are able to bind calmodulin. Phosphorylation of substrate subunits occurs specifically at Thr286 and is completely dependent upon the presence of calmodulin. Blocking the ability of the substrate subunit to bind calmodulin, either with inhibitor KN-93 or by mutagenesis of the calmodulin-binding domain of the substrate subunit, prevents its phosphorylation, consistent with a substrate-directed function of calmodulin that requires its direct binding to the subunit being phosphorylated. Autophosphorylation of Thr286in Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II occurs within each holoenzyme by an intersubunit reaction and is essential for kinase function in vivo. In addition to a kinase-directed function of calmodulin to activate the kinase, a second calmodulin is required for the autophosphorylation of each Thr286 (Hanson, P. I., Meyer, T., Stryer, L., and Schulman, H. (1994) Neuron 12, 943–956). We have engineered heteromeric holoenzymes comprising distinct “kinase” and “substrate” subunits to test for kinase- and substrate-directed functions of calmodulin. The obligate kinase subunits have aspartate residues substituted for threonine at positions 286, 305, and 306 (the autophosphorylation and calmodulin-binding sites), making it constitutively active but unable to bind calmodulin.

Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II bovine serum albumin 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II)1 regulates a wide variety of neuronal processes, including neurotransmitter synthesis and secretion, carbohydrate metabolism, receptor and ion channel function, and gene expression by phosphorylation of critical enzymes and proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). It does so in response to increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels initiated by diverse signal transduction pathways. Accordingly, the kinase is both highly abundant in brain and distributed in diverse subcellular compartments (reviewed in Ref. 2Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Four genes (α, β, γ, and δ) give rise to many related CaM kinase II isoforms, with the α and β isoforms predominating in brain (1Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Each isoform has an amino-terminal catalytic domain, a central regulatory domain containing autoinhibitory and calmodulin binding segments, and an association domain at its carboxyl terminus. Interactions between association domains of individual subunits allow 6–12 subunits to form a multimeric holoenzyme. Electron microscopy suggests that the catalytic and regulatory domains radiate out from a central core of assembled association domains in a flower-petal-like arrangement (3Kanaseki T. Ikeuchi Y. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). CaM kinase II can undergo distinct steps of autophosphorylation at Thr286 within the autoinhibitory domain and at Thr305 and Thr306 in the calmodulin-binding site. Activation of CaM kinase II in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin results in rapid autophosphorylation at Thr286 (4Miller S.G. Patton B.L. Kennedy M.B.

Subsequent dissociation of calmodulin exposes Thr305 and Thr306 for autophosphorylation, which prevents rebinding of Ca2+/calmodulin (7Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11213-11219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hanson P.I. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17216-17224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hashimoto Y.

Chem. 1990; 265: 11204-11212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of Thr286 has significant consequences for some neuronal functions in vivo, as demonstrated with mice in which Thr286 of the endogenous kinase is mutated to Ala, preventing autophosphorylation at this position without disturbing kinase expression or its catalytic site (11Cho Y.H. Giese K.P. Tanila H. Silva A.J. Eichenbaum H. Science. 1998; 279: 867-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 12Giese K.P. Fedorov N.B. Filipkowski R.K. Silva A.J. Science. 1998; 279: 870-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). The mutant mice are impaired in spatial learning tests requiring the hippocampus and long term potentiation in hippocampal slices cannot be induced (12Giese K.P. Fedorov N.B. Filipkowski R.K. Silva A.J. Science. 1998; 279: 870-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Conversion of CaM kinase II to its autonomous form is mimicked in mutant T286D-CaM kinase II (13Fong Y.L. Taylor W.L. Means A.R. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16759-16763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Waldmann R. Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1679-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Consequently, long term potentiation and spatial learning are altered in transgenic mice expressing T286D mutant kinase (15Bach M.E. Hawkins R.D. Osman M. Kandel E.R. Mayford M. Cell. 1995; 81: 905-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 16Mayford M. Wang J. Kandel E.R. O'Dell T.J.

Cell. 1996; 87: 1351-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). There are several possible biochemical consequences of Thr286 phosphorylation. Phospho-Thr286-bearing subunits have a markedly reduced calmodulin off-rate and thereby “trap” calmodulin, perhaps providing a mechanism for CaM kinase II to sequester calmodulin from other enzymes and proteins while prolonging its activated state (19Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Even after calmodulin dissociates, the presence of phospho-Thr286 disables the autoinhibitory domain, leaving the kinase 50–70% Ca2+-independent or autonomous (20Lai Y. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4253-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 21Lou L.L. Lloyd S.J. Schulman H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8581-8584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, autophosphorylation makes activation of the kinase sensitive to the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations (24De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). During brief Ca2+ transients and with submaximal calmodulin levels, significant occupancy of calmodulin-binding sites and high activation only occur as the frequency of stimulation exceeds a threshold that achieves autophosphorylation (24De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Calmodulin trapping, autonomous activity, and frequency-dependent activation all require the autophosphorylation of Thr286. Given both its mechanistic and functional consequences, it is crucial to understand the mechanism underlying this phenomenon. Autophosphorylation of Thr286 is associated with the multimeric structure of CaM kinase II, yet activation by bound calmodulin is an inherent property of individual subunits, with each subunit binding one molecule of calmodulin (19Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 25Katoh T. Fujisawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1091: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of its critical autonomy site is an intraholoenzyme reaction (20Lai Y. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4253-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 26Kuret J. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6427-6433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which occurs via an intersubunit mechanism (27Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 28Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13744-13747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calmodulin exhibits cooperativity in calmodulin trapping and autophosphorylation (24De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 27Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 29Le Vine H.d. Sahyoun N.E. Cuatrecasas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2253-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), suggesting that calmodulin serves a second function in addition to activation. This is consistent with the finding that Thr286 is not constitutively autophosphorylated in holoenzymes in which some or all of the subunits are mutated to be constitutively active (27Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 30Brickey D.A. Bann J.G. Fong Y.L. Perrino L. Brennan R.G. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29047-29054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The simplest mechanism to explain these findings is for one molecule of calmodulin to bind for activation of a “kinase” subunit (a kinase-directed action) coincident with a second molecule of calmodulin that must be bound to the “substrate” subunit (a substrate-directed function; Ref. 31Hawley S.A. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Edelman A.M. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27186-27191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), e.g. to expose Thr286 for autophosphorylation (27Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). However, evidence supporting such a requirement for direct binding of calmodulin to the substrate subunit during autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II holoenzymes has not been demonstrated. In this report, we present such evidence using CaM kinase II heteromultimers in which subunits are mutated to assume obligatory roles, either as a kinase or a substrate subunit. Occupation by calmodulin on each of the two subunits participating in CaM kinase II autophosphorylation explains the cooperative effect of calmodulin (25Katoh T. Fujisawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1091: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,27Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and may underlie the high sensitivity of CaM kinase II to changes in Ca2+/calmodulin concentrations and frequencies of Ca2+ oscillations (24De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Porcine brain calmodulin was purchased from Ocean Biologics (Edmonds, WA). Both KN-93 and immobilized calmodulin were obtained from Calbiochem. CaM kinase II substrate peptide autocamtide-3 and anti-α-CaM kinase II monoclonal CB-α2 antibody were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction enzymes and other DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased through New England Biolabs or Life Technologies, Inc. The supplier for [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was NEN Life Science Products. The plasmid used for expression of wild type and mutant α-CaM kinase II constructs was the pCD derivative SRα (32Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding wild type, K42M mutant, K42M/T286A double mutant, and tag-CaM kinase II (in which an 18-amino acid sequence from the influenza hemagglutinin HA1 protein was inserted by site-directed mutagenesis into CaM kinase II between Thr3 and Ile4 to generate a “tagged” form of the enzyme) were those as described previously (27Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Three additional constructs in SRα, used as parent plasmids for subcloning to create mutant CaM kinase II constructs described herein, were T(286/305/306)D-αB-CaM kinase II, T(305/306)D-αB-CaM kinase II, and K42M/C289P-αB-CaM kinase II, which were engineered by and obtained from M. Srinivasan and H. Schulman. 2M. Srinivasan and H. Schulman, manuscript in preparation. These αB isoforms have an 11-amino acid insert between Lys328 and Glu329 containing a nuclear targeting signal (33Srinivasan M. Edman C.F. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This insert was removed from each construct by subcloning the 985-base pair fragment between the two AccIII sites into SRα-α-CaM kinase II, thus creating plasmids containing T(286/305/306)D triple mutant or T(305/306)D or K42M/C289P double mutant kinases. To form tag-T(286/305/306)D mutant, thePstI/EagI fragment from SRα-tag-CaM kinase II was subcloned into SRα-T(286/305/306)D-CaM kinase II. The calcium phosphate precipitation method of Chen and Okayama (34Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) was used to transiently transfect or cotransfect COS-7 cells with 15–20 μg of total DNA/10-cm plate as described previously (35Hanson P.I. Kapiloff M.S. Lou L.L. Rosenfeld M.G. Schulman H. Neuron. 1989; 3: 59-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) using the modifications for harvesting cell lysates described by Brocke et al. (36Brocke L. Srinivasan M. Schulman H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of wild type and mutant kinase was performed using a two-column procedure (phosphocellulose followed by calmodulin-agarose) as described (27Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) based on an original three column purification procedure (8Hanson P.I. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17216-17224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All phosphorylation reactions were conducted on ice using 50-μl reaction volumes. A primary reason for performing reactions at this temperature is that it effectively limits autophosphorylation to Thr286in CaM kinase II when used in conjunction with the other reaction conditions as described (37Lou L.L. Schulman H. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 2020-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ikeda A. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11582-11588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase activity was assayed for 1 min and contained at final concentrations 50 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 20 μm autocamtide-3, 25 μm[γ-32P]ATP (1 Ci/mmol), with either 0.5 mmCaCl2 plus 10 μg/ml calmodulin (for Ca2+-stimulated activity) or else 0.5 mm EGTA (for Ca2+-independent activity). Reactions were initiated by addition of enzymes, stopped by adding 10 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid, and 32P incorporation into peptide was quantified as described (14Waldmann R. Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1679-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) using Cerenkov radiation at an efficiency of 52%. Autophosphorylation reactions were performed for 15 s and, unless otherwise indicated, contained 50 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 200 μm[γ-32P]ATP (1–4 Ci/mmol), with either 0.5 mm CaCl2 plus 10 μg/ml calmodulin (for Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation) or else 0.5 mm EGTA (for Ca2+-independent autophosphorylation). Reactions were started by addition of enzymes and terminated with the addition of 25 μl of SDS electrophoresis sample buffer. Due to variability between wild type and mutant CaM kinase II expression in COS cells, equivalent total kinase activity in COS lysates was achieved by diluting lysates expressing higher levels of kinase activity with mock-transfected COS lysate. Routinely, 5 μl of COS lysate was used in reactions. Dilution buffer for purified kinases consisted of 2 mm PIPES (pH 7.0) with 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and these dilutions were adjusted to ensure comparable total activity between wild type and mutant CaM kinase II in phosphorylation reactions. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll). CaM kinase II subunits on membranes were visualized by using calmodulin overlay assay, autoradiography (for 32P-labeled samples), or immunodetection. The calmodulin overlay assay was performed with biotinylated calmodulin and enhanced chemiluminescence as described (39Nghiem P. Saati S.M. Martens C.L. Gardner P. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5471-5479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunodetection specific for α-CaM kinase II was conducted with anti-CaM kinase II monoclonal CB-α2 antibody as described (40Scholz W.K. Baitinger C. Schulman H. Kelly P.T. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 1039-1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For purified kinases, autophosphorylated as described above except that nonradioactive ATP was used in place of [γ-32P]ATP, immunodetection was also performed with anti-phospho-Thr286CaM kinase II rabbit polyclonal antisera generously supplied from D. D. Ginty. This antisera selectively recognizes CaM kinase II phosphorylated at Thr286. Immunoblots were prepared by blocking membranes in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) plus 5% (w/v) BSA for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubating in primary antibody diluted 1:500 in buffer A plus 1% BSA for 2.5 h. Bound antibodies were detected by incubation for 1 h with donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:2500 in buffer A plus 1% BSA and visualized using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence detection kit and film from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech following the manufacturer's directions. We engineered heteromultimers of CaM kinase II composed of subunits that can function as either kinase or substrate subunits in order to test for obligatory binding of calmodulin to the substrate subunit during autophosphorylation. The requisite feature of the kinase subunit is that it be unable to bind calmodulin while being active,i.e. that it be constitutively active. These features are those of wild type CaM kinase II that is autophosphorylated at Thr286 (which makes it autonomous of Ca2+/calmodulin) and at Thr305 and Thr306 (which disables calmodulin binding; Refs. 8Hanson P.I. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17216-17224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 27Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), which can be mimicked by engineering aspartate in place of the three threonine residues. To distinguish these subunits immunologically and on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, we epitope-tagged the kinase subunits near the amino terminus (see “Experimental Procedures”) to increase their size by 2 kDa without affecting its activity, as previously reported (see Fig. 1 in Ref. 27Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). This kinase subunit is termed tag-T(286/305/306)D. Obligate substrate subunits should retain Thr286 and the ability to bind calmodulin, but should not be able to autophosphorylate. This was previously generated by inactivating the catalytic function of the kinase through replacement of Lys42, a conserved residue near the ATP-binding sites of all kinases, with Met (27Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant CaM kinase II subunits were expressed in COS-7 cells by transfection with corresponding DNAs, and expression levels examined by immunoblot with α-CaM kinase II specific monoclonal antibody CB-α2 and for the ability to bind calmodulin by calmodulin overlay (Fig. 1). Homomultimers composed of either kinase (tag-T(286/305/306)D, apparent molecular mass of 56 kDa) or substrate (K42M, apparent molecular mass of 54 kDa) subunits or heteromultimers composed of both subunits achieved by cotransfecting a mixture of corresponding DNAs were well expressed and distinguishable by mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1 A). Calmodulin overlay assay of identical lysates reveal bands corresponding to K42M mutant (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1, 3, and 4) and to wild type kinase (Fig. 1 B, lane 5) but not to the tag-T(286/305/306)D mutant (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2, 3, and 4). Thus, replacement of Thr305 and Thr306 with aspartate has the intended effect of mimicking autophosphorylation of these sites by similarly blocking binding of calmodulin (7Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11213-11219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hanson P.I. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17216-17224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hashimoto Y. Schworer C.M. Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8051-8055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Patton B.L. Miller S.G. Kennedy M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11204-11212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activities of expressed kinases were found to be appropriate for the substrate and kinase subunits needed for our studies (Fig. 2 C). Lysates with expressed homomultimers of K42M mutant (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1 and 2) exhibited little or no Ca2+/calmodulin-stimulated activity, similar to that found in mock-transfected cells (data not shown). By contrast, lysates of cells expressing homomultimers of tag-T(286/305/306)D exhibited high activity in either the presence or absence of added Ca2+/calmodulin (Fig. 2 C, lanes 7 and 8). Comparison of expressed kinase subunit migrating at 56 kDa and substrate subunit at 54 kDa (Fig. 2 B) with activities of comparable samples (Fig. 2 C) indicates that kinase activities in lysates expressing both types of subunits are largely due to the presence of tag-T(286/305/306)D, the kinase subunit. The tag-T(286/305/306)D mutant is therefore an appropriate obligate kinase subunit for our studies, with high Ca2+-independent activity and no calmodulin binding (Fig. 1). Previous studies showed that Thr286 autophosphorylation in CaM kinase II occurs via an intraholoenzyme reaction (20Lai Y. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4253-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 26Kuret J. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6427-6433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and involves an intersubunit mechanism (27Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 28Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13744-13747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that the phosphorylation of K42M by tag-T(286/305/306)D should be a likely indicator of whether the two subunits were coassembled into heteromultimers. Indeed, Fig. 2 A illustrates that phosphorylation of the K42M subunit only occurred in COS lysates in which the tag-T(286/305/306)D mutant was coexpressed (and in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin; see lane 6). No subunit 32P incorporation was seen in cell lysates expressing homomultimers of either subunit (lanes 1 and 2 for K42M, and lanes 7 and 8 for tag-T(286/305/306)D), nor when these lysates were mixed together (lanes 3 and 4). Phosphorylation of K42M does not occur even though the amount of kinase protein and activity in the two preparations (mixed versus coexpressed) is similar. These data suggest that the tag-T(286/305/306)D and K42M subunits coassemble to form heteromeric holoenzymes. This conclusion is also supported by the observation that tag-T(286/305/306)D is copurified with K42M using a procedure (see “Experimental Procedures”) involving immobilized calmodulin chromatography (lanes 1–4 in Fig. 3 B). In addition to mutant K42M, all other substrate subunits used in the experiments below formed heteromeric holoenzymes when coexpressed with tagged kinase subunits, as judged by co-immunoprecipitation using an antibody specific to the hemagglutinin epitope tag (data not shown). We purified heteromeric CaM kinase II composed of obligate kinase (tag-T(286/305/306)D) and substrate (K42M) subunits in order to test the possible requirement for calmodulin binding to the substrate subunit with Thr286. Heteromeric (lanes 1–4) or wild type (lanes 5–8) CaM kinase II was incubated under autophosphorylation conditions in either the absence (−) or presence (+) of Ca2+/calmodulin (Fig. 3). In this experiment, phosphorylation of Thr286 was detected by immunoblot with polyclonal antibody that selectively detects phospho-Thr286 CaM kinase II kindly provided by D. Ginty. Although the heteromeric kinase expressed both kinase and substrate subunits (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1and 2) and was constitutively active when presented with an exogenous substrate with no difference in activity in the absence or presence of Ca2+/calmodulin (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1 and 2), it was unable to phosphorylate itself, i.e. its substrate subunit, unless Ca2+/calmodulin was present (Fig. 3 A, comparelanes 1 and 2). Thus, autophosphorylation, but not phosphorylation of exogenous substrates, by the constitutively active heteromultimer is conditional on the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin. By contrast, Ca2+/calmodulin was required for both substrate phosphorylation and autophosphorylation by wild type CaM kinase II (Fig. 3 C, lanes 5 and 6; Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). We took advantage of KN-93, an inhibitor that blocks binding of calmodulin to the kinase without interfering with the Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activity of the autophosphorylated enzyme (41Sumi M. Kiuchi K. Ishikawa T. Ishii A. Hagiwara M. Nagatsu T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) to further test the requirement for calmodulin binding. KN-93 has the same differential effect on kinase made Ca2+/calmodulin-independent by the Thr286to aspartate mutation; it did not block the constitutive activity of the heteromultimer (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1–4) but did block activation of wild type kinase (Fig. 3 C, lanes 5–8). However, despite its inability to block phosphorylation of exogenous substrates by the heteromultimer, KN-93 completely inhibited autophosphorylation of the K42M subunit in the multimer (Fig. 3 A, comparelanes 2 and 4), suggesting that the calmodulin-binding site of the substrate subunit must be occupied in order for it to be phosphorylated by the kinase subunit. We further examined the requirement for calmodulin binding by disabling the calmodulin-binding site of the substrate subunit using the double T305D/T306D point mutation shown previously to block Ca2+/calmodulin binding (Fig. 1 B). Indeed, substrate subunits consisting of mutant T(305/306)D, which are unable to bind calmodulin (data not shown), cannot be phosphorylated when coexpressed and coassembled with either tag-T(286/305/306)D (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2) or tag-wild type CaM kinase II (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). Wild type CaM kinase II subunits in the heteromultimer can phosphorylate themselves (Fig. 4 A) or an exogenous substrate (Fig. 4 C) in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin but cannot phosphorylate coassembled substrate T(305/306)D subunits, which are incapable of binding calmodulin (Fig. 4 A). Similar results were achieved when triple mutant K42M/T305D/T306D CaM kinase II subunits were substituted for T(305/306)D subunits in heteromultimers (data not shown). Since CaM kinase II can be autophosphorylated at multiple sites, it was important to determine whether all of the substrate-directed incorporation of 32P was occurring at Thr286, the only site whose phosphorylation generates autonomous activity (13Fong Y.L. Taylor W.L. Means A.R. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16759-16763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35Hanson P.I. Kapiloff M.S. Lou L.L. Rosenfeld M.G. Schulman H. Neuron. 1989; 3: 59-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We used tag-T(286/305/306)D as the obligate kinase subunit and compared its phosphorylation of coexpressed mutants K42M or K42M/T286A as substrate (Fig. 5). In fact, no32P incorporation was detected when the substrate subunit contained the T286A mutation (Fig. 5 A, comparelanes 2 and 4). These data, along with the demonstration that Thr286 is phosphorylated, using phosphoselective antisera (Fig. 2), strongly indicate that the substrate-directed effect of calmodulin is to enable phosphorylation of Thr286. Results presented above are consistent with the idea that Thr286 is shielded from autophosphorylation in the native conformation of CaM kinase II when Ca2+/calmodulin is not bound to the enzyme (28Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13744-13747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Brickey D.A. Bann J.G. Fong Y.L. Perrino L. Brennan R.G. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29047-29054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Soderling and colleagues (30Brickey D.A. Bann J.G. Fong Y.L. Perrino L. Brennan R.G. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29047-29054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Mukherji S. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20733-20738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that mutation of Cys289 to proline disrupts the autoinhibitory domain to expose Thr286 and makes the enzyme Ca2+-independent. Therefore, we examined whether this mutation in substrate subunit would obviate the need for Ca2+/calmodulin binding to this subunit during autophosphorylation. We analyzed the autophosphorylation of mutant K42M/C289P, as the obligate substrate subunit with a potentially altered conformation near Thr286, in heteromultimers with either tag-T(286/305/306)D as obligate kinase or tag-wild type as both Ca2+-dependent kinase and substrate (Fig. 5,lanes 5–8). Autophosphorylation of K42M/C289P occurred in a Ca2+/calmodulin-independent fashion (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5 and 6) in contrast to the requirement for Ca2+/calmodulin seen when substrate does not have a proline residue to disturb the secondary structure near Thr286 (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1 and 2). When K42M/C289P is coassembled with wild type CaM kinase II subunits, its phosphorylation does require Ca2+/calmodulin, but in this case calmodulin is providing a kinase-directed function to activate the kinase subunits whose activation and autophosphorylation require Ca2+/calmodulin (Fig. 5, A and C, lanes 7and 8). These data support a substrate-directed function for calmodulin in CaM kinase II Thr286 autophosphorylation, a function that is not necessary when Thr286 of the substrate subunit is already exposed, e.g. by a nearby mutation. It has been suggested that Ca2+/calmodulin has two independent functions during CaM kinase II autophosphorylation (27Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Ca2+/calmodulin serves a conventional kinase-directed function in which it relieves the inhibitory interaction between the autoinhibitory domain and the catalytic domain, thereby activating the kinase (43Colbran R.J. Smith M.K. Schworer C.M. Fong Y.L. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4800-4804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that phosphorylation of inactive truncated CaM kinase II mutants by previously activated CaM kinase II monomers still required calmodulin suggested a requirement for a second calmodulin (27Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). We have now delineated a second function for calmodulin in intact holoenzymes of the kinase by demonstration that the calmodulin must bind directly to a substrate subunit in order for Thr286 autophosphorylation to proceed, a substrate-directed function. As shown in Fig. 3, phosphorylation of Thr286remains Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent in heteromultimers composed of a constitutively active kinase that is unable to bind calmodulin coassembled with an obligate substrate subunit. Autophosphorylation within mutant heteromultimers appears to be similar to that in wild type CaM kinase II holoenzymes, i.e. it occurs through an intraholoenzyme and intersubunit mechanism (Fig. 2). Although CaM kinase II is able to autophosphorylate at a number of distinct sites, we employed reaction conditions that limit autophosphorylation to Thr286 (see “Experimental Procedures”). This is illustrated by the lack of 32P incorporation into substrate subunits containing a T286A mutation (Fig. 5). Even when the substrate subunit contains Thr286, this residue is not phosphorylated if the calmodulin-binding site is disabled by substitution of aspartate for threonines 305 and 306 (Fig. 4). Thus, calmodulin binding is likely an inherent requirement for both the substrate and kinase subunits involved in each autophosphorylation reaction. Our results agree with the previous suggestion by Soderling and colleagues (30Brickey D.A. Bann J.G. Fong Y.L. Perrino L. Brennan R.G. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29047-29054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Mukherji S. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20733-20738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that Thr286 is shielded from phosphorylation in the absence of bound calmodulin. This conclusion stemmed from their observation that mutant C289P CaM kinase II homomultimers displayed some activity and autophosphorylated at Thr286 in the absence of Ca2+/calmodulin (42Mukherji S. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20733-20738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for requiring concurrent calmodulin binding to at least two proximate subunits of CaM kinase holoenzymes for initial autophosphorylation to occur. The requirement explains the Hill coefficients of ∼1.6 for generating autonomous CaM kinase II activity in response to increasing levels of calmodulin (24De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar,29Le Vine H.d. Sahyoun N.E. Cuatrecasas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2253-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) whereas kinase activation toward exogenous substrates is not cooperative (24De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). It is likely that features of the kinase that take advantage of its multimeric structure, such as its dual requirements for Ca2+/calmodulin in autophosphorylation, which in turn alters calmodulin binding kinetics, termed calmodulin trapping (19Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), and produce an autonomous activity, contribute to its ability to act as a frequency detector of Ca2+ oscillations with high sensitivity to frequency and calmodulin levels (24De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Our findings also refine the molecular basis for a second feature of frequency-dependent activation, i.e. a molecular switch in sensitivity to Ca2+ oscillations such that conversion of some subunits to an autonomous species facilitate subsequent increments in autonomous activity or sensitize the enzyme to lower frequencies of stimulation (24De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). As suggested (24De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of Thr286 in one subunit relieves it of a requirement for calmodulin and thereby facilitates Thr286phosphorylation in a second subunit, creating a functional cooperativity. Moreover, our results confirm that a constitutive kinase subunit does not require interaction with calmodulin to phosphorylate Thr286 on a neighboring subunit. For example, removal of the calmodulin-binding requirement in the substrate subunit K42M/C289P, which may expose Thr286 without binding calmodulin, enables constitutive autophosphorylation of this subunit (Fig. 5). The need for calmodulin binding onto two distinct subunits for CaM kinase II autophosphorylation is somewhat reminiscent of systems where multiple effects of Ca2+/calmodulin are exerted on both an upstream (e.g. CaM kinase I kinase) and a downstream kinase (in this instance, CaM kinase I), thus bringing acute sensitivity to the system in the presence of the ligand (31Hawley S.A. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Edelman A.M. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27186-27191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). As these authors point out, however, the effects of CaM kinase I phosphorylation and CaM kinase II autophosphorylation are different. To demonstrate that the mechanism of Thr286 phosphorylation requires both subunits to have bound calmodulin, we created heteromultimers with distinct kinase and substrate subunits. In vivo, of course, any subunit of wild type CaM kinase II should be able to assume either role. It would be interesting to determine whether the mechanism of subunit activation and subunit presentation, the kinase- and substrate-directed steps of autophosphorylation, involve distinct conformations or interactions with calmodulin. It has recently been shown using theDrosophila homologue of CaM kinase II that autophosphorylation of Thr287 (equivalent to Thr286 in rat α CaM kinase II) requires bound calmodulin acting in a substrate-directed mechanism (Wang, Z., Palmer, G., and Griffith, L. C. (1998) J. Neurochem. 71, 378–387)."

We previously demonstrated that a fragment of the dystrophin rod domain also binds F-actin. However, the nature and extent of rod domain association with F-actin is presently unclear. To begin addressing these questions, we characterized two recombinant proteins representing adjacent regions of the dystrophin rod. DYS1416 (amino acids 1416–1880) bound F-actin with a K d of 14.2 ± 5.2 μm and a stoichiometry of 1 mol:mol of actin. However, DYS1030 (amino acids 1030–1494) failed to bind F-actin, suggesting that not all rod domain repeats are capable of binding F-actin. Interestingly, DYS1416 corresponds to a unique region of the dystrophin rod rich in basic amino acids, whereas DYS1030 is composed mainly of acidic repeats. This observation suggested that DYS1416 may interact with acidic actin filaments through an electrostatic interaction. Supporting this hypothesis, actin binding by DYS1416 was dramatically inhibited by increasing ionic strength. We suggest that electrostatic interactions between basic spectrin-like repeats and actin filaments may contribute to the actin binding activity of other members of the actin cross-linking protein family.

The skeletal muscle dystrophin-glycoprotein complex is believed to serve as a mechanical link between the actin-based cortical cytoskeleton and merosin in the extracellular matrix (1Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). Disruption of this linear assembly of proteins due to genetic mutation of dystrophin or its associated glycoproteins results in a variety of muscular dystrophies (2Campbell K.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 675-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 3Worton R. Science. 1995; 270: 755-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The actin binding activity of dystrophin had previously been ascribed to a pair of tandem calponin homology domains in the dystrophin amino terminus, which is separated from the membrane-associated cysteine-rich and carboxyl-terminal domains by 24 spectrin-like repeats making up the rod-shaped domain (4Koenig M. Monaco A.P. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). Tandem calponin homology domains form a functional actin binding unit in a number of related proteins, including α-actinin, β-spectrin, and fimbrin (5Castresana J. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although actin binding by the isolated dystrophin amino terminus had been observed (6Hemmings L. Kuhlman P.A. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 7Way M. Pope B. Cross R.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Weeds A.G.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 63-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was difficult to reconcile the low affinity of the isolated domain (7Way M. Pope B. Cross R.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 9Winder S.J. Hemmings L. Maciver S.K. Bolton S.J. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Critchley D.R. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 63-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a potential physiological role for dystrophin-actin binding. We identified a second actin binding site near the middle of the dystrophin rod and demonstrated that the intact dystrophin-glycoprotein complex binds actin with significantly higher affinity than does the isolated amino terminus, presumably through the combined effect of two or more distinct sites (10Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These findings suggested an extended, lateral association between dystrophin and the actin filament. Consistent with this model, intact dystrophin, but not its individual actin binding fragments, was found to protect actin filaments from depolymerization (11Rybakova I.N. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28771-28778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It remains important to determine exactly how much of the very large (314 kDa) dystrophin rod domain is directly involved in binding F-actin. The crystal structure of a stereotypical spectrin α-helical repeat domain yields a length dimension of 5 nm (12Yan Y. Winograd E. Viel A. Cronin T. Harrison S.C. Branton D. Science. 1993; 262: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), whereas the length contributed by each actin monomer in a filament is 5.5 nm (13Bremer A. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, each of the 24 spectrin-like repeats of the rod domain could contribute to actin binding by weakly interacting with individual monomers in a single strand of an actin filament. Alternatively, discrete subdomains of the dystrophin rod may specifically bind F-actin, with the remaining repeats acting as spacer regions or as sites for additional cytoskeletal interactions. To begin to address this issue, we have examined the structure and actin binding properties of recombinant proteins encoding fragments of the rod domain lying either amino-terminal (DYS1030) or carboxyl-terminal (DYS1416) to the epitope (amino acids 1416–1494) recognized by dystrophin monoclonal antibody XIXC2 (14Durbeej M. Jung D. Hjalt T. Campbell K.P. Ekblom P. Dev. Biol. 1997; 181: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). DYS1416 was characterized because it best represented the actin binding proteolytic fragment of dystrophin recognized by XIXC2 (10Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), whereas DYS1030 represented an adjacent region of the rod domain of comparable length. We have found that actin binding activity is exhibited by a limited portion of the dystrophin rod. Interestingly, the actin binding region of the rod domain overlaps with a cluster of basic repeats in the generally acidic dystrophin rod domain. This, combined with our observation that the actin binding activity of the rod domain is highly sensitive to ionic strength, suggests that a cluster of basic repeats in the dystrophin rod domain binds actin through predominantly electrostatic interactions. Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle using the method of Pardee and Spudich (15Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar) and further purified by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column as described previously (10Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The construction of pDYS246, encoding dystrophin amino acids 1–246, and pDYS1416, encoding dystrophin amino acids 1416–1880, was previously described (10Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment encoding amino acids 1030–1494 of dystrophin was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from the full-length human dystrophin cDNA (pRSVDY) using the following pair of oligonucleotide primers (Life Technologies, Inc.): 5′-ATCGGATCCTTCCACACTCTTTGTTTCCAA-3′ and 5′-ATCCATATGAAGAAGCTCTCCTCCCAG-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the TA site of PCRII using the Original TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen). The insert was then cut out withNdeI and BamHI and ligated into pET16b previously digested with NdeI and BamHI, producing the plasmid pDYS1030. Escherichia coli JM109 (DE3) transformed with the dystrophin-encoding plasmids were grown at 37 °C untilA 600 reached 0.8. Cells were then grown an additional 3 h in the presence of 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, washed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, and frozen. Recombinant proteins were purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography (Novagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Eluted proteins were then dialyzed extensively against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 100 mm (DYS1030 and DYS1416) or 500 mm (DYS246) NaCl or against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 μm dithiothreitol, 100 mm (DYS1030 and DYS1416) or 500 mm (DYS246) NaCl. Recombinant proteins were concentrated in a Centriplus 10 (Amicon). Concentrated proteins were quantitated byA 280 using native molar extinction coefficients calculated from predicted denatured extinction coefficients and an empirically derived εnat/εden ratio (16Pace C.N. Schmid F.X. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Washington, D. C.1989: 253-259Google Scholar). After the further addition of dithiothreitol to a concentration of 1 mm and NaN3 to 0.02%, all recombinant proteins were stored at 4 °C and used within 2 weeks. F-actin cosedimentation was performed as described previously (10Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) with the exception that recombinant proteins were subjected to a 20 min, 100,000 ×g centrifugation step prior to use, in order to remove any protein aggregates. Binding data were analyzed by fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the curve fit function of SigmaPlot. Purified recombinant proteins in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, and varying NaCl concentrations (100–800 mm) were analyzed by circular dichroism at 25 °C in an Aviv 62A DS circular dichroism spectrometer with a path length of 1 mm. Samples from at least two different preparations were analyzed at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 30 μm, and the molar residue ellipticity spectra were calculated. Percentage of α-helical content was estimated by assuming that a molar residue ellipticity of −36,000 degrees cm2dmol−1 at 222 nm corresponded to 100% α-helical content (17Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequences of proteins were analyzed using the computer programs Isoelectric and Peptidesort of the Genetics Computer Group. Domain and repeat boundaries were adopted from Winder et al. (18Winder S.J. Gibson T.J. Kendrick-Jones J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In order to begin addressing the question of what portion of the large dystrophin rod domain is directly involved in binding actin filaments, we produced recombinant proteins encoding dystrophin amino acids 1030–1494, containing repeats 7–10 (DYS1030), and amino acids 1416–1880, containing repeats 11–14 (DYS1416). A third recombinant protein (DYS246), encoding residues 1–246 of the well characterized dystrophin amino-terminal domain, served as an actin binding control (Fig. 1). In order to verify that the recombinant proteins had assumed appropriately folded structures, we analyzed each by circular dichroism. Each of the three proteins exhibited the characteristic double-minimum spectrum indicative of high α-helical content (Fig. 2). The α-helical content of each protein (Table I) was calculated from the average (n ≥ 2) molar residue ellipticity at 222 nm (17Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar). The value of 39% α-helix for DYS246 is consistent with a value of 42% reported for the amino-terminal domain of utrophin (19Winder S.J. Knight A.E. Kendrick-Jones J. Brown S.C. Lucy J.A. Dystrophin: Gene, Protein and Cell Biology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1997: 27-55Google Scholar). The α-helical contents for both DYS1030 (54%) and DYS1416 (70%) are consistent with independent biophysical studies of the dystrophin rod domain (20Kahana E. Marsh P.J. Henry A.J. Way M. Gratzer W.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1271-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Calvert R. Kahana E. Gratzer W.B. Biophys.

Cytoskeleton. 1997; 36: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although DYS1030 exhibited a lower α-helical content than did DYS1416, a recombinant protein (RFM) spanning nearly 90% of the combined sequence encoded by DYS1030 and DYS1416 previously exhibited an α-helical content of 62% (Table I). Because this value is midway between the values that we measured for DYS1030 and DYS1416, we conclude that the lower value for DYS1030 was not due to improper folding of the protein but rather to an intrinsically lower helical content for the portion of the rod domain represented by DYS1030. We recorded circular dichroism spectra for each protein over a range of NaCl concentrations from 100 to 800 mm and found no significant qualitative or quantitative salt-dependent changes in the spectra (not shown). We therefore conclude that each recombinant dystrophin fragment assumed a stable, highly α-helical structure.Figure 2Circular dichroism analysis of recombinant dystrophin fragments. Purified recombinant dystrophin fragments were analyzed by circular dichroism at 25 °C in an Aviv 62A DS circular dichroism spectrometer with a path length of 1 mm.

Consistent with our previous observations, DYS246 and DYS1416 specifically cosedimented with F-actin (Fig. 1). Saturable binding was reproducibly achieved by the cosedimentation of increasing concentrations of DYS1416 with a fixed amount of F-actin. Fitting the binding data from three independent experiments to the Michaelis-Menten equation showed that DYS1416 bound F-actin with a K d of 14.2 ± 5.2 μm, a B max of 1.17 ± 0.5, and a Hill coefficient of 1.64 ± 0.4 (Fig. 3). Scatchard analysis yielded very similar values of K d = 22 μm and B max = 1.25. These values are similar to those measured for recombinant proteins corresponding to the amino-terminal domain of dystrophin, including DYS246 (7Way M. Pope B. Cross R.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 9Winder S.J. Hemmings L. Maciver S.K. Bolton S.J. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Critchley D.R. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 63-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Renley, B. A., Rybakova, I. N., Amann, K. J., and Ervasti, J. M. (1998) Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton, in pressGoogle Scholar). We also tested the ability of DYS246 and DYS1416 to competitively inhibit intact dystrophin binding to F-actin. Although the binding of 0.2 μm dystrophin-glycoprotein complex to 5 μmF-actin was reduced by 76 or 55% in the presence of 30 μm DYS246 or DYS1416, respectively, neither recombinant protein competed with the other for binding to F-actin at concentrations as high as 85 μm (not shown). These results indicated that although DYS246 and DYS1416 bind F-actin with similar affinities and stoichiometries, they likely interact with distinct sites on the actin filament. In contrast to our observations of DYS246 and DYS1416, DYS1030 reproducibly failed to bind F-actin (Fig. 1). This result is consistent with our previous finding that a proteolytic dystrophin fragment approximately corresponding to DYS1030 did not cosediment with F-actin (10Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These observations indicated that actin binding activity is limited to a subset of the spectrin-like repeats making up the dystrophin rod domain. Based on our finding that not all dystrophin rod domain repeats are capable of binding F-actin, it remained necessary to identify the unique structural features that confer actin binding activity. Interestingly, the program Peptidesort indicated that the predicted pI of the actin binding recombinant protein DYS1416 was 8.0, whereas the pI of nonbinding DYS1030 was 5.1 (Fig. 4 A). The calculated pI value for each recombinant protein was verified (not shown) by isoelectric focusing (DYS246 and DYS1030) or by nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis (DYS1416). Because of the notable difference between the pI of DYS1030 and DYS1416, we subdivided the amino acid sequence of the dystrophin rod domain into its 24 constitutive spectrin-like repeats (18Winder S.J. Gibson T.J. Kendrick-Jones J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), calculated the predicted pI of each individual repeat, and plotted the results as a function of repeat number (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, we found that DYS1416 overlaps with a cluster of basic repeats (repeats 11–17) in the otherwise acidic dystrophin rod. In fact, three of the four repeats making up DYS1416 are basic, whereas DYS1030 contains only one basic repeat. These analyses revealed that DYS1030 and DYS1416 are distinguished by a significant difference in net charge and suggested that the excess of positive charges on DYS1416 may play a role in its specific interaction with the negatively charged actin filament. In support of the significance of these findings, the organization of acidic and basic repeats is conserved between human and mouse dystrophins (not shown). Electrostatic protein-protein interactions are distinguished by a dramatic sensitivity to ionic strength (24Kuhlman P.A. Hemmings L. Critchley D.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to test whether the binding of DYS1416 to actin is due predominantly to electrostatic interactions, we measured the NaCl sensitivity of actin binding by DYS246 and DYS1416. We subjected DYS246 and DYS1416 to high-speed F-actin cosedimentation in actin binding buffer containing a range of NaCl concentrations from 100 to 800 mm (Fig. 5). Actin binding by DYS1416 was found to be highly sensitive to increasing ionic strength, exhibiting an IC50 of approximately 200 mm NaCl, with binding essentially abolished at 400 mm. In contrast, actin binding by DYS246, which is generally thought to occur primarily through hydrophobic interactions (6Hemmings L. Kuhlman P.A. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), was largely retained at high NaCl concentration (85 and 75% of control at 200 and 400 mm, respectively). Because no detectable changes in the circular dichroism spectrum of DYS1416 or the fraction of F-actin pelleted were observed over the range of NaCl concentrations tested, we conclude that a neutralization of attractive electrostatic forces between basic repeats and the actin filament is responsible for the observed inhibition, rather than a large-scale conformational change in either protein. The strong ionic strength sensitivity of DYS1416 binding to F-actin and the relatively insensitive binding of DYS246 are also consistent with the intermediate ionic strength sensitivity of F-actin binding by the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (10Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Collectively, the data presented here indicate that two distinct actin binding sites on dystrophin contribute to the binding properties of the native molecule and, furthermore, that electrostatic interactions between actin filaments and a cluster of basic repeats in the dystrophin rod are responsible for the rod domain actin binding activity. The function of the large (314 kDa) rod domain of dystrophin has long been unresolved. The 24 spectrin-like repeats that make up the rod were hypothesized (4Koenig M. Monaco A.P. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 25Koenig M. Kunkel L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4560-4566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ahn A.H. Kunkel L.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) to play a role in dystrophin dimerization, based on analogy to its sequence relatives, α-actinin and β-spectrin. However, the predictive capabilities of such comparisons are limited, as attested to by our (11Rybakova I.N. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28771-28778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and others' (22Kahana E. Flood G. Gratzer W.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 36: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,27Chan Y.M. Kunkel L.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) observations that dystrophin exists in a monomeric state. The relatively low sequence conservation between dystrophin repeats also argued against rod domain dimerization and led to an alternative hypothesis for the function of the dystrophin rod domain (18Winder S.J. Gibson T.J. Kendrick-Jones J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 28Cross R.A. Stewart M. Kendrick-Jones J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition to serving as an extended, flexible spacer between the actin binding amino terminus and the membrane-associated carboxyl terminus, it was suggested that the rod domain may also contain sites for additional cytoskeletal interactions. Our discovery (10Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) of a novel actin binding activity located within residues 1416–1880 of dystrophin provided the first direct evidence for the latter possibility. We showed that both the amino terminus and the central rod domain interact with actin filaments and, furthermore, that the two spatially separated binding sites on a single dystrophin molecule induce a lateral association with the actin filament, providing in vitrostabilization against actin depolymerization (11Rybakova I.N. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28771-28778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recombinant protein corresponding to the second, acidic spectrin-like repeat of dystrophin was observed to interact specifically with artificial membranes containing phosphatidylserine (29DeWolf C. McCauley P. Sikorski A.F. Winlove C.P. Bailey A.I. Kahana E. Pinder J.C. Gratzer W.B. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2599-2604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This observation may provide a partial basis for the targeting of dystrophin to the sarcolemma and reinforces the idea that the rod domain likely plays a much more significant and complex role in dystrophin function than was formerly appreciated. Although the identification of a novel actin binding site in the dystrophin rod domain resulted in a significant revision of the role of dystrophin in anchoring the cortical cytoskeleton to the sarcolemma, it remained important to determine the nature and extent of the interaction between actin and the dystrophin rod. One outstanding question was whether actin binding is a general feature of individual spectrin-like repeats making up the rod domain or whether actin binding activity is restricted to a subset of the repeats. Our current observations indicate that only a limited portion of the dystrophin rod domain exhibits actin binding activity. Furthermore, this activity is likely to be due to electrostatic interactions between the acidic actin filament and a cluster of basic repeats in the dystrophin rod. That rod domain actin binding activity is restricted to a region rich in basic residues is consistent with results obtained for a variety of actin-binding proteins (30de Arruda M.V. Bazari H. Wallek M. Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13079-13085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Li X. Matsuoka Y. Bennett V. J. Biol.

Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). For example, Tang et al.(33Tang J.X. Szymanski P.T. Janmey P.A. Tao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 432-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) observed that the effects of the highly basic protein calponin on actin polymerization and bundling were due primarily to its ability to reduce the electrostatic repulsion between polyanionic actin filaments. In contrast, intact dystrophin has no effect on actin polymerization (11Rybakova I.N. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28771-28778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and does not cross-link/bundle F-actin (10Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas the cluster of basic repeats appears to function as a polycationic ligand for F-actin, the extensive acidic repeat regions flanking the cluster of basic repeats (Fig. 4) may provide sufficient interfilament repulsion to prevent filament bundling (10Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the basic myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate-related domain of adducin is critical to its actin binding activity (31Li X. Matsuoka Y. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19329-19338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the cluster of basic residues in MARCKS has been implicated in its binding to both actin (32Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) and anionic phospholipids (34Murray D. Ben-Tal N. Honig B. McLaughlin S. Structure. 1997; 5: 985-989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), which raises the possibility that the basic repeats of the dystrophin rod domain may dually serve to bind actin and retain dystrophin near the sarcolemmal membrane. Our observation that basic spectrin-like repeats contribute to the actin binding activity of a tandem calponin homology domain-containing protein raises the question of whether this may be a property common to sequence relatives of dystrophin. Whereas the amino-terminal domain of β-spectrin was observed to bind F-actin with 26 μmaffinity (35Li X. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15695-15702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the addition of its first repeat increased the affinity for F-actin by 4-fold and decreased the stoichiometry by a factor of 3. The sequential addition of up to nine more repeats had no effect on the affinity for actin, although the second repeat appeared to play a role in binding additional cytoskeletal elements. Interestingly, the first β-spectrin repeat has a calculated pI of 10.1, but repeats 2–10 are all acidic, with pI values ranging from 4.2 to 6.7. Thus, it appears that the presence of even a single basic repeat immediately adjacent to tandem calponin homology domains can have a significant effect on actin binding affinity. It is also possible that the more modest differences between the actin binding affinities of native α-actinin and its recombinant amino terminus (Ref. 36Xu J.Y. Wirtz D. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9570-9576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar and references therein) can be explained by the presence of a single basic repeat (pI = 8.1) immediately adjacent to its amino-terminal domain. Supporting this possibility, F-actin binding by the isolated amino-terminal domain of α-actinin was relatively insensitive to increasing ionic strength (24Kuhlman P.A. Hemmings L. Critchley D.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), as compared with the marked inhibition of the native molecule (37Rosenberg S. Stracher A. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12986-12991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, as is the case for dystrophin, electrostatic interactions may contribute to the actin binding activity of other proteins in the spectrin superfamily. A number of recent studies (38Blake D.J. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Brain Pathol. 1996; 6: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 39Tinsley J.M. Potter A.C. Phelps S.R. Fisher R. Trickett J.I. Davies K.E.

Cell. 1997; 90: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) have suggested that dystrophin may be functionally interchangeable with its autosomal homolog, utrophin. Indeed, the isolated amino terminus of utrophin bound F-actin with characteristics similar to the dystrophin amino terminus (9Winder S.J. Hemmings L. Maciver S.K. Bolton S.J. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Critchley D.R. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 63-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the overexpression of a utrophin minigene resulted in substantial but incomplete correction of the dystrophic phenotype of mdxmice (39Tinsley J.M. Potter A.C. Phelps S.R. Fisher R. Trickett J.I. Davies K.E. Nature. 1996; 384: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 41Deconinck N. Tinsley J. De Backer F. Fisher R. Kahn D. Phelps S.

Genet. 1998; 19: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Based on our preliminary findings for the dystrophin rod domain and assuming that utrophin is functionally homologous with dystrophin, we expected to identify a similar cluster of basic repeats in the utrophin rod domain that would enable it to also bind F-actin. Surprisingly, a plot of the calculated pI of individual human utrophin rod domain repeats revealed that only repeats 4 and 21 of utrophin are basic (pI = 7.5 and 8.4, respectively), with the remaining 20 repeats exhibiting calculated pI values ranging from 3.8 to 6.3. As is the case for dystrophin, this pattern of acidic and basic repeats is preserved in mouse utrophin. Because a single isolated basic repeat appears to be incapable of binding F-actin (DYS1030), we hypothesize that utrophin may lack the rod domain actin binding activity that we have identified in dystrophin. The present data do not rule out the possible existence of a single, more discreet actin contact site within dystrophin amino acids 1416 and 1880. On the other hand, our plot of pI versusrepeat number (Fig. 4 B) suggests that repeats 11–17 could form a more extensive electrostatic association with actin. Therefore, in addition to examining the potential roles of spectrin-like repeats in the actin binding activities of α-actinin and utrophin, it will be necessary to more rigorously map the actin binding sites in the dystrophin rod domain.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), although its physiological significance remains obscure. We show here that a novel SH3 domain-containing protein, Hof1p, directly binds to the FH1 domain of Bnr1p through the SH3 domain in a GTP-Rho4p-dependent manner. The hof1 mutant shows a deficiency in cytokinesis. Both Hof1p and Bnr1p are localized at the bud neck, and both the hof1 and bnr1mutations show synthetic lethal interactions with the bni1mutation. Our results suggest that Bnr1p interacts with both Hof1p and profilin at its FH1 domain to regulate reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Wild type yeast strains OHNY1 (MATa ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 ade2) and OHNY3 (MATa/MATα ura3/ura3 leu2/leu2 trp1/trp1 his3/his3 ade2/ade2) (15Ozaki K. Tanaka K. Imamura H. Hihara T. Kameyama T. Nonaka H. Hirano H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) were used for cytological and genetic studies. TAT7 (MATa trp1 leu2 his3 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 ura3::lexA-lacZ) was used for the two-hybrid studies. Yeast strains were usually grown in rich medium (yeast extract peptone dextrose adenine uracil, YPDAU), and yeast transformants were selected in dextrose-containing (synthetic dextrose) or galactose-containing (synthetic galactose) selection media (12Fujiwara T. Tanaka K. Mino A. Kikyo M. Takahashi K. Shimizu K. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were performed by the lithium acetate methods (16Gietz D. Jean A.S. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Standard yeast genetic manipulations were performed as described (17Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). An Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for construction and propagation of plasmids and purification of recombinant proteins. Standard molecular biological techniques were used for construction of plasmids, DNA sequencing, and polymerase chain reaction (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Two-hybrid plasmids were constructed by inserting various truncated fragments of BNR1 or BNI1 and HOF1, generated by polymerase chain reaction or digestion with restriction enzymes, into pBTM116-HA (8Imamura H. Tanaka K. Hihara T. Umikawa M. Kamei T. Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2745-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), encoding DBDLexA, and pACTII-HK (15Ozaki K. Tanaka K.

Tanaka K. Hihara T. Umikawa M. Kamei T. Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2745-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), respectively, downstream of the TDH3 promoter of pKT10 expression vector (19Tanaka K. Nakafuku M. Tamanoi F. Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K. Toh-e A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4303-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). pMAL-c2-HOF1(551–669) was made by inserting the 0.4-kbp EcoRI-SalI fragment of HOF1, corresponding to amino acid positions from 551 to 669 of Hof1p, into the EcoRI-SalI site of pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA). pGEX-4T-2-BNR1(757–1326) was made by inserting the 1.7-kbp BamHI-BamHI fragment of BNR1 into the BamHI site of pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pUC19-HOF1 was made by inserting the 2.0-kbp BamHI-SmaI fragment of HOF1, containing the HOF1 open reading frame, from pACTII-HK-HOF1 into the BamHI-SmaI site of pUC19. The disruption plasmid for HOF1, pUC19-hof1::LEU2, was made by inserting the 2.2-kbp LEU2 fragment into the XhoI site of pUC19-HOF1, corresponding to amino acid position 86 of Hof1p. pKO11 is a pRS316-based (20Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) expression vector that contains theGAL1 promoter, the two HA epitopes-encoding region just downstream of the initiation codon, a multicloning site, and theTDH3 terminator. pKO11-BNR1 was made by inserting the 4.1-kbp SmaI-SmaI fragment from pACTII-HK-BNR1(1–1374) (8Imamura H. Tanaka K. Hihara T. Umikawa M. Kamei T. Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2745-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) into the SmaI site of pKO11. pKO11-HOF1 was made by inserting the 2.0-kbpBamHI-SmaI fragment from pACTII-HK-HOF1 into theBamHI-SmaI site of pKO11. A plasmid containing a gene fused to DBDLexA was transformed into TAT7, and the resultant transformant was retransformed by a plasmid containing a gene fused to ADGAL4. Cells of each transformant were cultured in synthetic dextrose medium lacking tryptophan and leucine, and β-galactosidase activity was measured quantitatively according to theO-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside assay method (21Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). The values (Miller units) are the averages of β-galactosidase activity for three transformants, and each measured value was within 50% of the average. For qualitative assay for β-galactosidase activity, cells of each transformant were placed on the nitrocellulose filter and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (22Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). pUC19-hof1::LEU2 was cut withBamHI and SmaI, and the digested DNA was introduced into OHNY3. The genomic DNA was isolated from each transformant, and the proper disruption of HOF1 was verified by polymerase chain reaction (data not shown). A transformant in which one HOF1 allele was disrupted was subjected to tetrad analysis. All dissected asci (11 asci) showed a 2 Leu−:2 Leu+ segregation pattern, and all of the Leu+clones showed the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype. One Leu+ strain, TKUK1, was used as a hof1 mutant in this study. Cdc11p and HA-tagged proteins were stained with the anti-Cdc11p antibody (kindly provided by J. Pringle) and the anti-HA monoclonal antibody, 12CA5, respectively (23Yamochi W. Tanaka K. Nonaka H. Maeda A. Musha T. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1077-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Actin and DNA were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Sigma), respectively (23Yamochi W. Tanaka K. Nonaka H. Maeda A. Musha T. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1077-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Chitin was stained with Calcofluor White M2R New (Sigma) (24Pringle J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Stained cells were observed with a Zeiss Axiophoto microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and photographed with a peltier cooling 3CCD color camera (C5810–01; Hamamatsu Photonics KK, Hamamatsu, Japan). Recombinant MBP-Hof1p(551–669) was purified from DH5α carrying pMAL-c2-HOF1(551–669) using an amylose resin column (New England Biolabs, Inc.) (25Guan C.L.P. Riggs P.D Inouye H. Gene. 1988; 67: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-Bnr1p(757–1326) was purified from DH5α carrying pGEX-4T-2-BNR1(757–1326) using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (26Kikuchi A. Kuroda S. Sasaki T. Kotani K. Hirata K. Katayama M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14611-14615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified MBP-Hof1p(551–669) or MBP (4 nmol each) in 600 μl of Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mmEDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column that was prebound to GST-Bnr1p(757–1326) (400 pmol) or GST (4 nmol). Each column was washed with 20 column volumes of Buffer A. GST-Bnr1p(757–1326) or GST was eluted with 300 μl of Buffer A containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. An aliquot (30 μl) of each eluate was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by protein staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and determination of protein concentrations were performed as described (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar, 28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). We examined by the two-hybrid method whether Bnr1p(757–1374) and Bni1p(1239–1953), containing the FH1 and FH2 domains, interacted with an SH3 domain-containing protein. Among four proteins containing an SH3 domain tested, including Abp1p, Sla1p, Rvs167p, and Ymr032wp, only Ymr032wp bound to both Bnr1p and Bni1p (data not shown). Deletion analysis of Bnr1p indicated that Bnr1p bound to Ymr032wp at its FH1 domain, although full-length Bnr1p did not bind to Ymr032wp (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, Bni1p(1239–1953), containing the FH1, FH2, and its C-terminal domains, weakly bound to Hof1p, but neither the FH1 domain itself nor full-length Bni1p did (Fig. 1 B). Western blot analysis indicated that the levels of expression of Bni1ps were similar to those of Bnr1ps (data not shown). Deletion analysis of Ymr032wp indicated that Ymr032wp bound to Bnr1p at its SH3 domain (Fig. 1 C). Ymr032wp is homologous to cdc15p, which is involved in cytokinesis in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (29Fankhauser C. Reymond A. Cerutti L. Utzig S. Hofmann K. Simanis V. Cell. 1995; 82: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Both of the proteins have a region at the N terminus with potential to form coiled-coils, a C-terminal SH3 domain, and a PEST region, which is implicated in turnover of proteins (30Rechsteiner M. Semin. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 433-440PubMed Google Scholar). We named Ymr032wp Hof1p (homolog of cdc 15). To examine whether Hof1p directly interacts with Bnr1p, Hof1p(551–669), containing the SH3 domain, and Bnr1p(757–1326), containing the FH1 domain, were fused to MBP and GST, respectively, and these fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified. MBP-Hof1p(551–669) bound to GST-Bnr1p(757–1326) at a molar ratio of about 1:1, but it did not bind to GST (Fig. 2). MBP did not bind to GST-Bnr1p(757–1326). This result indicates that Hof1p directly interacts with Bnr1p. We examined by the two-hybrid method whether full-length Bnr1p interacted with Hof1p in a Rho4p-dependent manner. Wild type or mutant Rho4p carrying an amino acid substitution that keeps Rho4p in the GTP-bound form (Rho4p(Q70L)) (31Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar) or the GDP-bound or nucleotide-free form (Rho4p(T25N)) (32Farnsworth C.L. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4822-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) was overexpressed in the two-hybrid reporter strain, TAT7, expressing full-length Bnr1p and full-length Hof1p. These Rho4ps did not possess the C-terminal lipid modification site to prevent association of Rho4ps with the membranes (8Imamura H. Tanaka K. Hihara T. Umikawa M. Kamei T. Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2745-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Hof1p interacted with full-length Bnr1p when Rho4p(Q70L), but not wild type Rho4p or Rho4p(T25N), was overexpressed (Fig. 3 A). We next examined whether full-length Bni1p interacted with Hof1p in a Rho family-dependent manner. However, Hof1p did not interact with full-length Bni1p even when Rho3p(Q74L) or Rho4p(Q70L) was overexpressed (Fig. 3 B). Western blot analysis indicated that wild type and mutant Rho4ps and wild type and mutant Rho3ps were expressed at a similar level (data not shown). We could not examine the effect of Rho1p-(Q68L) or Cdc42p(G12V) on the Bni1p-Hof1p interaction because overexpression of these proteins severely inhibited cell growth even with the C-terminal mutations. 2T. Kamei, K. Tanaka, T. Hihara, M. Umikawa, H. Imamura, M. Kikyo, K. Ozaki, and Y. Takai, unpublished results. These results indicate that full-length Bnr1p interacts with Hof1p in a GTP-Rho4p-dependent manner but that full-length Bni1p does not interact with Hof1p, irrespective of the presence or the absence of the GTP-Rho family. The HOF1 gene was disrupted with LEU2. The hof1 mutant showed the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype (data not shown). The growth-arrested cells of the hof1 mutant were observed under a microscope and 70% of the hof1 mutant cells had a large and elongated bud (Fig. 4). Staining of DNA and chitin revealed that these hof1 mutant cells showed multinucleate and the deposition of chitin throughout the cells (Fig. 4 A). Staining of actin revealed that the hof1mutant cells possessed cortical actin patches at the bud tip but not at the mother-bud neck (Fig. 4 B). These phenotypes are similar to those of the septin mutants (33Adams A.E. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 934-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The septin family members, including CDC3, CDC10, CDC11, and CDC12, are involved in cytokinesis (for reviews, see Refs.34Sanders S.L. Field C.M. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 907-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar and 35Longtine M.S. DeMarini D.J. Valencik M.L. Al-Awar O.S. Fares H. De Virgilio C. Pringle J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 106-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the hof1 mutant is deficient in cytokinesis. The physiological significance of the interaction of Bnr1p with Hof1p was examined genetically. We have shown that the bnr1mutation is synthetically lethal with the bni1 mutation (8Imamura H. Tanaka K. Hihara T. Umikawa M. Kamei T. Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2745-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The hof1 mutant was crossed with the bni1 mutant, and the hof1 mutation was also synthetically lethal with thebni1 mutation (data not shown). In contrast, thehof1 mutation was not synthetically lethal with thebnr1 mutation (data not shown). These results suggest thatHOF1 and BNR1 function in a similar signaling pathway. The localization of Hof1p was examined by the immunofluorescence microscopic analysis. TheHA-HOF1 gene was expressed under the control of theHOF1 promoter. However, a positive staining was not observed (data not shown). HA-HOF1 was therefore expressed under the control of the GAL1 promoter on a single copy plasmid. The expression of HA-Hof1p suppressed the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of the hof1 mutant (data not shown), indicating that the addition of the HA tag does not impair the functions of HOF1. HA-Hof1p was localized at the bud neck in both small- and large-budded cells, as was Cdc11p (Fig. 5). Localization of HA-Bnr1p was similarly examined, and HA-Bnr1p was also localized at the bud neck (Fig. 5). We have tested here the possible interactions of Bnr1p with four SH3 domain-containing proteins, Hof1p, Abp1p, Sla1p, and Rvs167p, and shown that Bnr1p interacts with only Hof1p. Abp1p, Sla1p, and Rvs167p are co-localized with cortical actin patches or actin cables (for a review, see Ref. 4Cid V.J. Duran A. del-Rey F. Snyder M.P. Nombela C. Sanchez M. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 345-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Bnr1p and Hof1p are co-localized at the bud neck through the cell cycle, suggesting that Bnr1p specifically interacts with Hof1p among many SH3 domain-containing proteins. We have shown that this interaction of Bnr1p with Hof1p is direct and GTP-Rho4p-dependent. GTP-Cdc42 stimulates an actin-depolymerizing activity of its target, neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (36Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). This finding, together with the present results that although the FH1 domain of Bnr1p interacts with Hof1p even in the absence of GTP-Rho4p, full-length Bnr1p interacts with it only in a GTP-Rho4p-dependent manner, indicates that the binding of Rho family to each target molecule makes its conformation active as described for the Ras family-Raf interaction system (for a review, see Ref. 37Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). We have shown that Hof1p also interacts with Bni1p, but this interaction is very weak. The FH1 domain of Bni1p was not sufficient for the interaction with Hof1p, and full-length Bni1p did not interact with Hof1p in a GTP-Rho family-dependent manner. Moreover, Bni1p is mainly localized at the bud tip (12Fujiwara T. Tanaka K. Mino A. Kikyo M. Takahashi K. Shimizu K. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore, the physiological significance of the Bni1p-Hof1p interaction remains obscure. The FH1 domain of Bnr1p(765–806) contains four proline-rich sequences, PQLPPPPPPPPPPPLP, PAPPPLP, PPPPPPPPLP, and PPAPPLP. The SH3 domain of Hof1p interacted with a region of Bnr1p containing the former two (Bnr1p(765–806)) but not that containing the latter two (Bnr1p(818–850)) in the two-hybrid method, although the interaction was relatively weak (data not shown). The FH1 domain of Bnr1p(765–806) also interacted with profilin in the two-hybrid method (data not shown). These results indicate that the FH1 domain of Bnr1p binds to both Hof1p and profilin and are consistent with an earlier finding that both the SH3 domain and profilin possess a similar ligand-binding surface, which consists of an elongated patch of aromatic residues (for a review, see Ref. 38Mayer B.J. Eck M.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In contrast, the FH1 domain of Bni1p contains four proline-rich sequences, PPPPPPPPPPVP, PAPPPPPPPPPPP, PPPPPLP, and PPAPP, but the former two proline-rich sequences do not possess a leucine residue at the −1 position from the C terminus. The failure of the FH1 domain of Bni1p to interact with Hof1p may be due to this structural difference. In S. pombe, cdc15p (29Fankhauser C. Reymond A. Cerutti L. Utzig S. Hofmann K. Simanis V. Cell. 1995; 82: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), cdc3p (profilin) (39Balasubramanian M.K. Hirani B.R. Burke J.D. Gould K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1289-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and cdc12p (an FH protein) (40Chang F. Drubin D. Nurse P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) are involved in cytokinesis. It has not yet been shown that cdc15p interacts with cdc12p, but cdc3p interacts with cdc12p (40Chang F. Drubin D. Nurse P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Interactions of an FH protein with both profilin and an SH3 domain-containing protein may be a general feature in the modes of action of FH proteins. We have lastly shown that the disruption mutant of HOF1 is deficient in cytokinesis. This result is consistent with the facts thatcdc15 is also involved in cytokinesis in S. pombe(29Fankhauser C. Reymond A. Cerutti L. Utzig S. Hofmann K. Simanis V. Cell. 1995; 82: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and that Hof1p is localized at the bud neck, as is a septin, Cdc11p. Hof1p shares homologous regions, other than the SH3 domain, with cdc15p and uncharacterized proteins in tapeworm and mouse (29Fankhauser C. Reymond A. Cerutti L. Utzig S. Hofmann K. Simanis V. Cell. 1995; 82: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). These proteins may be generally involved in cytokinesis. A protein related to mammalian IQGAP, Iqg1p/Cyk1p, has recently been implicated in cytokinesis in S. cerevisiae (41Epp J.A. Chant J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 42Lippincott J. Li R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Iqg1p/Cyk1p is localized at the bud neck and associates with actin filaments. It would be interesting to examine whether Hof1p physically or functionally interacts with Iqg1p/Cyk1p. We thank John Pringle (University of North Carolina) for the anti-Cdc11p antibody."

We found that GAP-43 was enriched in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) isolated by Triton X-100 extraction from PC12 pheochromocytoma cells and could be detected in detergent-insoluble plasma membrane remnants after extraction of cells in situ. GAP-43 is palmitoylated at Cys-3 and Cys-4. Mutation of either Cys residue prevented association with DRMs. A hybrid protein containing the first 20 amino acid residues of GAP-43 fused to β-galactosidase was targeted to DRMs even more efficiently than GAP-43 itself. We conclude that tandem palmitoylated Cys residues can target GAP-43 to DRMs, defining a new signal for DRM targeting. We propose that tandem or closely spaced saturated fatty acyl chains partition into domains or “rafts” in the liquid-ordered phase, or a phase with similar properties, in cell membranes. These rafts are isolated as DRMs after detergent extraction. The brain-specific heterotrimeric G protein Go, which may be regulated by GAP-43 in vitro, was also enriched in DRMs from PC12 cells. Targeting of GAP-43 to rafts may function to facilitate signaling through Go. In addition, raft association may aid in sorting of GAP-43 into axonally directed vesicles in the trans-Golgi network.

Trans. 1993; 21: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), although the physiological relevance of this interaction remains controversial. Other evidence suggests a role in regulating neurite extension. Although neurite extension still occurs in mice lacking GAP-43, neuronal pathfinding is abnormal (9Strittmatter S.M. Frankhauser C. Huang P.L. Mashimo H. Fishman M.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 445-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Although GAP-43 is delivered to nerve terminals by fast axonal transport in association with vesicles, it does not contain a membrane-spanning domain (10Skene J.H.P. Willard M. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 11Benowitz L.I. Lewis E.R. J. Neurosci. 1983; 3: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, GAP-43 binds membranes via palmitoylated Cys residues at positions 3 and 4 (12Zuber M.X. Strittmater S.M. Fishman M.C. Nature. 1989; 341: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 13Skene J.H.P. Virág I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 14Liu Y. Fisher D.A. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 72: 10714-10719Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). GAP-43 has been detected in the Golgi region in neurons (15Goslin K. Schreyer D.J. Skene J.H. Banker G. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 588-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transfected fibroblasts (16Liu Y. Fisher D.A. Storm D.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5807-5817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This pool of the protein is probably in thetrans-Golgi network (TGN),1 as its localization in transfected fibroblasts is not altered by brefeldin A (16Liu Y. Fisher D.A. Storm D.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5807-5817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Targeting of GAP-43 to the TGN probably allows the protein to “hitchhike” to nerve terminals on the cytosolic surface of transport vesicles (16Liu Y. Fisher D.A. Storm D.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5807-5817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane proteins destined for axons and dendrites of neurons are probably sorted into different vesicles in the TGN, in the same way that apical and basolateral proteins are sorted in certain polarized epithelial cells (17de Hoop M.J. Dotti C.G. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 17: 85-92Crossref Google Scholar). GAP-43 is expressed specifically in axonal growth cones in developing neurons (18Goslin K. Schreyer D.J. Skene J.H.P. Banker G. Nature. 1988; 336: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may be sorted into axonally directed vesicles in the TGN. As has been suggested (19Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), dual palmitoylation may be a sorting signal for incorporation of GAP-43 into these vesicles. Detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) that are rich in sphingolipids and cholesterol can be isolated from lysates of most mammalian cells (20Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar,21Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). Model membrane studies confirmed that lipids with high acyl chain melting temperatures (T m) and a correspondingly high degree of acyl chain order are enriched in DRMs (22Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 23Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In fact, DRM lipids appear to be present in the liquid-ordered phase rather than the more familiar liquid-disordered phase that is common in biological membranes. These findings raise the possibility that phase separation may occur in biological membranes and that liquid-ordered phase “rafts” rich in sphingolipids and cholesterol may float in a phospholipid-rich liquid-disordered phase “sea” (21Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar, 25Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 26Brown D.A. London E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). A specific set of membrane proteins is enriched in DRMs (27Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 28Melkonian K.A. Chu T. Tortorella L.B. Brown D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16161-16170Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These are likely to be proteins with an affinity for an ordered lipid environment, and they may associate preferentially with rafts in intact membranes. Targeting of these proteins to rafts has been proposed to function in intracellular sorting (25Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar) and cell-surface signal transduction (21Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). Two signals for targeting of proteins to DRMs have been identified: glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors (29Rodgers W. Crise B. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5384-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 30Arreaza G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23641-23647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and an N-terminal Met-Gly-Cys motif in which Gly is myristoylated and Cys is palmitoylated (31Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 32Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Sargiacomo M.

Sci. 1995; 20: 181-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The finding that DRMs are in the liquid-ordered phase provides a rational explanation for how these targeting signals work; both contain two closely spaced saturated acyl chains that are expected to partition favorably into the ordered environment present in liquid-ordered phase DRMs (26Brown D.A. London E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Because GAP-43 also contains tandem saturated acyl chains, it might associate with DRMs. In this study, we show that GAP-43 is enriched in DRMs in a manner that requires both palmitate chains. A hybrid protein containing the dually palmitoylated amino-terminal 20 amino acids of GAP-43 linked to β-galactosidase associated with DRMs much more efficiently than GAP-43 itself. This result extends previous findings on GPI-anchored proteins (34Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) by showing that DRM association of proteins containing lipid-based targeting signals can be strongly modulated by the protein sequence. These results define a new signal for DRM targeting. EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mixture (>1000 Ci/mmol; referred to as [35S]methionine) was from NEN Life Science Products.

COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% iron-supplemented calf serum. Plasmids encoding wild-type GAP-43, NMf-β-gal, NM2G-β-gal, NM20-β-gal, L3, and L4 in the pCDM8 expression vector constructed by Liu et al. (14Liu Y. Fisher D.A. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 72: 10714-10719Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Liu Y. Fisher D.A. Storm D.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5807-5817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were the gifts of D. Storm (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) and were grown in Escherichia coli MC1061 cells. A cDNA encoding VSVG (Indiana serotype) has been described (37Rose J.K. Bergmann J.E. Cell. 1982; 30: 753-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). pBC12-PLAP-HA, expressing the PLAP-HA hybrid protein, has been described (30Arreaza G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23641-23647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method (38Adams G.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1985; 41: 1007-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Except where indicated, 0.4 × 106 COS-1 cells seeded in one 60-mm dish were transfected with 5–15 μg of plasmid. PC12 cells in one confluent 100-mm dish or transfected COS-1 cells expressing GAP-43 or mutant or hybrid GAP-43 proteins (in one 60-mm dish) were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4), scraped from the dish in the same buffer, and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were washed once with ice-cold homogenization buffer (10 mmHepes, pH 6.8, and 5 mm EDTA), resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture (PIC; 0.5 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 mg/ml pepstatin, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and passed 30 times through a 22-gauge needle. Homogenates were subjected to centrifugation at 200 ×g at room temperature for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of fresh homogenization buffer and subjected to centrifugation under the same conditions. Supernatants were pooled and subjected to centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in a Sorvall RC M120 ultracentrifuge. The supernatant (cytosol) was removed and reserved. Pellets (light membranes) were resuspended by 10 passes through a 22-gauge needle in 2 ml of TNE/PIC (25 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA; ice-cold except where indicated), with or without detergent as appropriate; incubated for 20 min (on ice except where indicated); and subjected to ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 200,000 ×g at 4 °C. Except where indicated, pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of detergent solution (6.25 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.4% deoxycholate, and 1% Triton X-100)/PIC. 200 μl of 10× detergent solution was added to supernatants and reserved cytosolic fractions. Trichloroacetic acid was added to each sample to 10% to precipitate proteins, which were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blotting and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence as described (24Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Equal fractions of the cytosol, final pellet, and membrane wash or detergent-soluble supernatant fractions (usually 10–15% of the total) were loaded on the gels. COS-1 cells expressing transmembrane proteins (VSVG or PLAP-HA) were lysed directly in 2 ml of ice-cold TNE/PIC/Triton X-100. (Preliminary experiments showed that these proteins were completely membrane-associated, as expected.) Lysates were subjected to ultracentrifugation; supernatant and pellet fractions were processed; and proteins were analyzed as described above for the GAP-43 proteins. Where indicated, proteins were labeled to steady state with [35S]methionine as described (20Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). DRMs were isolated from cell lysates after lysis in TNE/PIC containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 11, by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation as described (39Arreaza G. Melkonian K.A. LaFevre-Bernt M. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19123-19127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After harvesting DRMs from sucrose gradients and collecting by centrifugation (39Arreaza G. Melkonian K.A. LaFevre-Bernt M. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19123-19127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), DRMs were solubilized by resuspension in TNE/PIC/Triton X-100 and warming to 37 °C (28Melkonian K.A. Chu T. Tortorella L.B. Brown D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16161-16170Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation or were collected by precipitation in trichloroacetic acid and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (28Melkonian K.A. Chu T. Tortorella L.B. Brown D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16161-16170Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) or Western blotting (24Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, solubilized DRMs were precleared with Pansorbin for 1 h at 4 °C before incubating overnight at 4 °C with anti-GAP-43 or anti-caveolin (control) antibodies. Pansorbin, previously coated with rabbit anti-mouse Ig(G+M), was added, and immune complexes were recovered and washed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge and eluted with Laemmli gel sample buffer. Where indicated, protein concentration was determined using a Detergent Compatible assay kit (Bio-Rad). Scanning densitometry was performed within the linear range of preflashed x-ray film with a Bio-Rad GS-670 imaging densitometer. PC12 cells seeded at low density on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were grown for 6 days with or without NGF. Where indicated, cells were then extracted for 30 min at 4 °C with PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1% Triton X-100. All cells were then fixed for 2 h with 3% paraformaldehyde; rinsed; permeabilized with PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.5% Triton X-100; and blocked overnight with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm glycine, and 5% nonfat dry milk. Cells were then incubated with 5 μg/ml anti-GAP-43 or anti-β-galactosidase (control) antibodies and then with dichlorotriazinylaminofluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. (In preliminary experiments, similar background fluorescence was observed with several irrelevant mouse and rabbit antibodies. Anti-β-galactosidase was judged least likely to cross-react with an endogenous antigen.) PBS in all incubations and washes except the final washes contained 5% nonfat dry milk. Cells were visualized using a Zeiss Axioskop epifluorescence microscope. As a prelude to examining the association of GAP-43 with DRMs, we determined whether DRMs can be isolated from PC12 cells, which express GAP-43 endogenously. Cells were incubated with [35S]methionine to label proteins to steady state and then extracted with ice-cold buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1m sodium carbonate at pH 11. We have found that detergent extraction in the presence of alkaline carbonate can increase the yield of DRMs, probably by reducing binding to high density Triton X-100-insoluble material that pellets during sucrose gradient centrifugation (28Melkonian K.A. Chu T. Tortorella L.B. Brown D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16161-16170Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A floating DRM band observed in the sucrose gradient was harvested, solubilized, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography to reveal a simple protein profile (Fig. 1, lane 1). DRMs with a similar protein profile could also be isolated from PC12 cells after differentiation with NGF (data not shown). GAP-43 is enriched in DRMs isolated from rat brain (40Maekawa S. Kumanogoh H. Funatsu N. Takei N. Inoue K. Endo Y. Hamada K. Sokawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1323: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To determine whether GAP-43 is present in PC12 cell DRMs, solubilized DRMs were incubated with anti-GAP-43 (Fig. 1, lane 2) or control anti-caveolin (lane 3) antibodies and processed for immunoprecipitation. GAP-43 could be specifically immunoprecipitated from DRMs (Fig. 1, arrow). (The apparently anomalous migration of the protein was also often observed by Western blotting.) We next wanted to determine how much GAP-43 is in DRMs. However, GAP-43 exists in both membrane-associated and cytosolic pools in brain (41Meiri K.F. Gordon-Weeks P.R. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 256-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,42Houbre D. Duportail G. Deloulme J.-C. Baudier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7121-7131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and transfected fibroblasts (14Liu Y. Fisher D.A. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 72: 10714-10719Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, we determined the fraction of membrane-associated GAP-43 that is in DRMs. In later experiments, this parameter will allow a more meaningful comparison between DRM association of GAP-43 and of mutants that bind membranes weakly. We found that 88 ± 3% (n = 3) of PC12 cell GAP-43 could be pelleted from cell homogenates by ultracentrifugation, showing that it was membrane-associated (Fig. 2 A). (In this and later experiments, we compared the amount of protein in the cytosol and membranes isolated from a post-nuclear supernatant. Some of the plasma membrane was probably lost during low speed centrifugation to remove nuclei. Thus, the degree of membrane association reported is likely to be an underestimate.) To ensure that membrane association was stable to ultracentrifugation, the membrane pellet was resuspended in fresh buffer and repelleted. Western blotting of the supernatant and pellet fractions showed that very little of the membrane-associated GAP-43 was released (Fig. 2 A, lane W). This shows that any GAP-43 found in the supernatant fraction after detergent extraction in later experiments was released from membranes by detergent solubilization. We then subjected membrane-bound GAP-43 to detergent extraction to measure DRM association. Membranes were isolated from a post-nuclear supernatant of PC12 cell homogenates as described for Fig. 2, extracted with Triton X-100 on ice, and subjected to ultracentrifugation. GAP-43 in the detergent-soluble supernatant and detergent-insoluble pellet fractions was detected by Western blotting and densitometry. About 10% of GAP-43 associated with DRMs after extraction of membranes with 1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 3, closed circles). More GAP-43 associated with DRMs when the membranes were extracted with a lower concentration of detergent. Although only a modest fraction of the protein was present in DRMs, GAP-43 was enriched in DRMs compared with whole membranes, as shown by comparing the amount of GAP-43 in DRMs, whole light membranes, and whole cell lysate that each contained 10 μg of protein (Fig. 3, inset). We assumed in these experiments that all the pelletable GAP-43 was present in DRMs. Alternatively, however, Triton X-100 insolubility might result from association of GAP-43 with the cytoskeleton or other insoluble protein complexes. A diagnostic property of DRM association is that after brief extraction with Triton X-100 at 37 °C or with ice-cold octyl glucoside, DRM proteins are solubilized to the extent that they can no longer be pelleted by ultracentrifugation under conditions sufficient to pellet membranes (28Melkonian K.A. Chu T. Tortorella L.B. Brown D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16161-16170Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 43Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6324-6331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). GAP-43 remained in the supernatant under both of these conditions (Fig. 4 A). It is unlikely that aggregation or cytoskeletal binding would be disrupted by both of these mild treatments. Thus, detergent insolubility of GAP-43 probably results from association with DRMs. In the next series of experiments, we expressed GAP-43 and several mutant forms of the protein in COS-1 cells to examine the sequence requirements for association of GAP-43 with DRMs. In two point mutants of GAP-43 (L3 and L4), Cys-3 and Cys-4, respectively, were changed to Leu (14Liu Y. Fisher D.A. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 72: 10714-10719Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Liu Y. Fisher D.A. Storm D.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5807-5817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NMf-β-gal and NM20-β-gal are hybrid proteins containing GAP-43 and the N-terminal 20 amino acids of GAP-43, respectively, linked to β-galactosidase (Table I) (16Liu Y. Fisher D.A. Storm D.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5807-5817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further characterization of NM20-β-gal showed that residues 11–20 of GAP-43 are duplicated. 2L. Baker and D. R. Storm, personal communication.NM2G-β-gal is the same as NMf-β-gal, except that both Cys-3 and Cys-4 are replaced with Gly. All of these proteins except NM2G-β-gal are at least partially membrane-associated, as reported earlier (14Liu Y. Fisher D.A. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 72: 10714-10719Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Liu Y. Fisher D.A. Storm D.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5807-5817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and confirmed in our hands (Fig. 2 (B–D) and Table I). As the L3 and L4 mutants each contain only one palmitate chain, we verified that membrane association of these proteins and of wild-type GAP-43 was stable to ultracentrifugation by showing that only a small amount of each protein was released by a wash (Fig. 2, B–D, lanes W).Table IMembrane association of mutant and hybrid GAP-43 proteinsProteinDescriptionMembrane-associated1-aMembrane association was determined by Liu et al.

Transfected COS-1 cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 on ice. A small fraction of the lysate was reserved as an expression control, and DRMs were prepared from the remainder. Proteins in the lysate and DRMs were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, probing for GAP-43 or β-galactosidase as shown in Fig. 5.

The biological importance of homologous recombination is underscored by the conservation of the RAD52 pathway from fungi to humans. The critical roles of the RAD52 group proteins in the early steps of recombination, the search for DNA homology and strand exchange, are now becoming apparent. Here, we report the purification of the human Rad54 protein. We showed that human Rad54 has ATPase activity that is absolutely dependent on double-stranded DNA. Unexpectedly, the ATPase activity appeared not absolutely required for the DNA repair function of human Rad54 in vivo. Despite the presence of amino acid sequence motifs that are conserved in a large family of DNA helicases, no helicase activity of human Rad54 was observed on a variety of different DNA substrates. Possible functions of human Rad54 in homologous recombination that couple the energy gained from ATP hydrolysis to translocation along DNA, rather than disruption of base pairing, are discussed.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs),1 generated by ionizing radiation and endogenously produced radicals, are extremely genotoxic lesions because as few as one or two unrepaired DSBs can lead to cell death (1Resnick M.A. Martin P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1976; 143: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that multiple pathways have evolved for the repair of DSBs (2Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A.

Of the two main pathways, DNA end-joining uses no or extremely limited sequence homology to rejoin ends directly in a manner that need not be error-free, whereas homologous recombination requires extensive regions of DNA homology to repair DSBs accurately using information on the undamaged sister chromatid or homologous chromosome. The biological importance of DSB repair through homologous recombination is underscored by the conservation of its salient features from fungi to humans (4Ivanov E.L. Haber J.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 492-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Petrini J.H. Bressan D.A. Yao M.S. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Genetic experiments have established a role for at least nine genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in homologous recombination (6Petes T.D. Malone R.E. Symington L.S. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R.

These so-called RAD52 epistasis group genes include RAD50, RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55, RAD57, RAD59, MRE11, and XRS2 (7Haber J.E.

To date, proteins with amino acid sequence similarity to Rad50, Rad51, Rad52, Rad54, and Mre11 have been identified in mammals (3Kanaar R. Hoeijmakers J.H.J.

It is clear that the RAD52 homologous recombination pathway is functionally conserved from fungi to mammals. Biochemical experiments have demonstrated that the yeast and human Rad51 and Rad52 proteins perform key steps in homologous recombination, the search for DNA homology, and strand exchange, through similar mechanisms (9Baumann P.

Here, we report the purification of the human Rad54 protein (hRad54) from baculovirus-infected insect cells. Rad54 contains seven amino acid sequence motifs that are conserved in a large superfamily of proteins (28Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar), including DNA helicases involved in replication, recombination, and repair, such as the Escherichia coli DnaB, RuvB, and UvrD proteins. In particular, Rad54 belongs to the SWI2/SNF2 subfamily of ATPases (29Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). We show that hRad54 has ATPase activity that is absolutely dependent on double-stranded (ds) DNA. Unexpectedly, the ATPase activity of hRad54 is not absolutely required for its DNA repair function in vivo. A cDNA construct encoding hRad54 containing a polyhistidine amino-terminal tag (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH) and a carboxyl-terminal hemagglutin tag (VTYPYDVPDYAS) was generated. The sequence of all DNA fragments produced by polymerase chain reaction was confirmed by sequence analysis. For expression in mouse ES cells, the cDNA was placed under control of the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. A construct expressing a tagged version of hRad54 containing a single amino acid substitution at position 189 was also generated. The invariant lysine residue at this position, which is in the putative GKT Walker-type nucleotide binding motif, was changed to an arginine residue (21Kanaar R. Troelstra C. Swagemakers S.M.A. Essers J. Smit B. Franssen J.-H. Pastink A. Bezzubova O.Y. Buerstedde J.-M. Clever B. Heyer W.-D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Curr.

E14 ES cells were cultured and electroporated with DNA constructs as described (30Weeda G. Donker I. de Wit J. Morreau H. Janssens R. Vissers C.J. Nigg A. van Steeg H. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J.

The hRad54 expressing constructs described above were electroporated intomRAD54 knockout ES line mRAD54 307neo/pur(22Essers J. Hendriks R.W. Swagemakers S.M.A. Troelstra C. de Wit J. Bootsma D.

The disrupted mRAD54 alleles in this line contain the neomycin- and puromycin-selectable markers, respectively. The constructs were co-electroporated with a plasmid carrying the hygromycin-selectable marker. Clones were selected as described (22Essers J. Hendriks R.W. Swagemakers S.M.A. Troelstra C. de Wit J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Kanaar R. Cell. 1997; 89: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and screened for hRad54 expression by immunoblot analysis. The sensitivity of ES cells to increasing doses of ionizing radiation and mitomycin C was determined by measuring their colony-forming ability. After trypsinization and counting, various dilutions of the different ES cell lines were placed into gelatinized 60-mm dishes, and after 12–24 h, cells were incubated for 1 h in mitomycin C-containing medium. Ionizing radiation sensitivity was determined by comparing the colony-forming ability of the ES cell lines after irradiation with a 137Cs source as described (22Essers J. Hendriks R.W. Swagemakers S.M.A. Troelstra C. de Wit J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Kanaar R. Cell. 1997; 89: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Cloning efficiencies varied from 10 to 30%. Cells were grown for 7 days, fixed, stained, and counted. All measurements were performed in triplicate. The cDNAs encoding the tagged hRad54 and hRad54K189R proteins were subcloned into pFastBac1 (BAC-TO-BAC Baculovirus Expression System, Life Technologies, Inc.). The resulting plasmids were transformed into DH10Bac E. coli cells to allow site-specific transposition into bacmid bMON14272. High molecular weight recombinant bacmids were isolated and transfected into Sf21 cells to produce virus stocks that were amplified as described by the manufacturer. For protein production, 4.5 × 108 Sf21 cells were infected with the recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Two days postinfection, cells were collected by low speed centrifugation and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. For fractionation, the cells were lysed in eight packed cell volumes of ice-cold Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml chymostatin) for 30 min on ice. After clarification of the lysate by centrifugation, the supernatant was neutralized with four equivalents of packed cell volumes of ice-cold Buffer B (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml chymostatin). This crude extract (fraction I) was diluted with 0.5 volume of Buffer C (20 mmHepes-KOH (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol), loaded onto a phosphocellulose column (Whatman P11), and equilibrated with Buffer C containing 0.2 m KCl, and after washing, bound proteins were eluted with Buffer C containing 1.0 m KCl (fraction II). Imidazole-HCl (pH 7.9) was added to a final concentration of 2 mm to fraction II, which was subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate agarose (Qiagen). The resin was washed with Buffer D (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 500 mm KCl, and 20 mmimidazole-HCl (pH 7.9)). The hRad54 proteins were eluted with Buffer E (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 200 mmimidazole-HCl (pH 7.9)) to yield fraction III. Fraction III was diluted with three volumes of Buffer F (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) and loaded onto a Mono S column (HR5/5) equilibrated with Buffer F containing 0.2 m KCl. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of equilibration buffer, and the hRad54 proteins were eluted with a 20-column volume linear gradient from 0.2 to 1.0 m KCl in Buffer F. The proteins (fraction IV) eluted around 0.4 m KCl. Aliquots were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. The yield from 4.5 × 108 infected Sf21 cells varied between 60 and 120 μg of hRad54 protein. Standard reaction mixtures contained 20 mm KPO4 (pH 7.0), 4 mmMgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 μmATP, 0.25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (>5000 Ci/mmol), 45 μm DNA (concentration in nucleotides) and 0–100 ng of hRad54 or hRadK189R protein in a 10-μl volume. Incubations were for 60 min at 30 °C. Reactions were initiated by the addition of DNA and MgCl2 to a mixture containing the other components and terminated by the addition of EDTA to 167 mm. Released phosphate was separated from ATP by thin-layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine cellulose using 0.75 mKH2PO4 as running buffer. Hydrolysis was quantitated with the use of a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Background hydrolysis observed in the absence of protein (∼2%) was subtracted. Fig. 2 displays the results of three or four independent experiments. To determine the optimal pH of the reaction, the following buffers were used: Bis-Tris (pH 6.0), KPO4 (pH 7.0), and Tris (pH 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5) (see Table I).Table IATPase activity of the hRad54 proteinVariableRelative ATPase activity%Divalent cation None<1 Mg2+100 Mn2+109pH 6.021 7.0100 7.583 8.044 8.514Temperature 25 °C124 30 °C100 37 °C34Nucleic acid cofactor None<1 Supercoiled DNA100 Linear dsDNA90 M13 viral DNA48 Poly(dT)<1 Poly(dA)<1 RNA<1The ATPase activity of 20 ng of hRad54 was determined under standard conditions described under “Experimental Procedures,” with the exception of the indicated variable.

An ATPase activity of 100% corresponds to hydrolysis of 65% of input ATP. Partially dsDNA substrates were generated by annealing oligonucleotides to M13mp18 viral DNA. The sequence of the three oligonucleotides used was as follows: oligonucleotide a, 5′-CCAAGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGA; oligonucleotide b, 5′-TTTGCTGCCGGTCACCCAAGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGA; and oligonucleotide c, 5′-CCAAGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGAAGGGGCCCATGGCTC. Annealing of oligonucleotide a resulted in a 35-bp duplex, whereas annealing of oligonucleotides b and c resulted in 15-nucleotide overhangs, either 5′ or 3′, in addition to the 35-bp duplex region. The gel-purified oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and annealed to M13mp18 viral DNA. Labeled substrates were separated from labeled oligonucleotides by gel filtration through a Sepharose CL-4B column. A blunt-ended 79-bp dsDNA substrate was prepared by isolating theXmaI-BglII restriction fragment from thehRAD54 cDNA (21Kanaar R. Troelstra C. Swagemakers S.M.A. Essers J. Smit B. Franssen J.-H.

Branched dsDNA substrates were made by annealing three partially complementary oligonucleotides. The sequences of the oligonucleotides (designated oligonucleotides 1–3) were the same as those used to investigate the DNA helicase activities of the E. coli RecG and T4 UvsW proteins (31Whitby M.C. Vincent S.D. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 32Carles-Kinch K. George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The arms of the branched structure were between 24 and 26 bp. The purification and annealing procedures were as described (33Parsons C.A. Kemper B. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9285-9289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiment shown, oligonucleotide 2 was 5′-end-labeled with the use of T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. All DNA substrates were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C. Protein concentrations were varied from 0 to 0.1 μm, and ATP concentrations were varied from 0.2 to 2 mm. Reactions that were carried out in the presence of an ATP regeneration system contained 40 mm phosphocreatine and 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS and EDTA to 0.2% and 20 mm, respectively. DNA species were separated by electrophoresis through nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels that were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. For the purpose of purification, identification, and protein-protein interactions studies, we constructed a cDNA expressing hRad54 containing an amino-terminal polyhistidine tag and a carboxyl-terminal hemagglutin tag. The addition of the tags did not interfere with the biological function of hRad54. However, the presentation and discussion of those results is deferred until Fig. 3. In addition to the cDNA expressing wild-type tagged hRad54 protein, we generated a cDNA expression construct encoding a tagged version of hRad54 containing a single amino acid substitution at position 189. This invariant lysine residue is in the putative Walker A nucleotide binding motif and was changed to an arginine residue using site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting protein is referred to as hRad54K189R. For a number of ATPases, including E. coli UvrD and S. cerevisiae Rad3, conversion of the equivalent lysine residue into an arginine residue severely impairs nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis (34Sung P. Higgins D. Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 35George J.W. Brosh R.M. Matson S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, for UvrD and Rad3, nucleotide binding is unaffected by the mutation, implying that the overall structure of the protein remains intact. For protein production, we placed both cDNAs under transcriptional control of the polyhedrin promoter in recombinant baculoviruses. These viruses were used to infect Sf21 cells. A Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing crude extract of the cells infected with the hRad54 encoding baculovirus is shown in Fig. 1, lane 2. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that the prominent band between the 107- and 68-kDa molecular mass markers is the hRad54 protein (data not shown). The extract was subsequently fractionated over phosphocellulose, Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate agarose, and Mono S columns as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples of the hRad54-containing fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis through an SDS-polyacrylamide gel that was stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1). We estimate that the final hRad54 preparation had a purity of approximately 90%. A sample of the final purification step of the hRad54K189R protein, which was produced and purified in exactly the same manner as the wild-type protein, is shown in Fig. 1,lane 6. We tested whether the purified hRad54 protein could hydrolyze ATP, because it contains Walker A and B amino acid sequence motifs that are involved in ATP hydrolysis in a large number of proteins (36Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of hRad54 protein were incubated with ATP for 60 min at 30 °C. Released radiolabeled phosphate was separated from nonhydrolyzed ATP by thin layer chromatography, and the extent of hydrolysis was quantitated (Fig. 2). In the absence of DNA, no significant hydrolysis of input ATP was observed. The amount of input ATP hydrolyzed varied between 0.2 and 1.0% and did not increase with increasing protein concentration. Because the ATPase activity of the SWI2/SNF2 protein is stimulated by DNA (37Laurent B.C. Treich I. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), we included dsDNA in the reaction mixture. Fig. 2 A shows that inclusion of dsDNA is absolutely required for the activation of the ATPase activity of hRad54. Recently, it was shown that, like hRad54, the S. cerevisiae Rad54 protein also possesses DNA-dependent ATPase activity (26Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P.

The observed ATPase activity of hRad54 was not due to a contaminating ATPase, because the identical preparation of hRad54K189R protein displayed no ATPase activity in the presence of dsDNA. The lack of ATPase activity of hRad54K189R is not due to a defect in DNA binding, because analysis of the DNA binding properties showed that the wild-type and mutant proteins had similar affinities for both ds and single-stranded (ss) DNA (data not shown). We next analyzed the effect of ssDNA on hRad54-mediated ATP hydrolysis. M13 viral DNA also stimulated the hRad54 ATPase activity but to a lesser extent than dsDNA (Fig. 2 A). Because M13 viral DNA has a significant amount of secondary structure and given the fact that dsDNA is such an effective stimulator of the hRad54 ATPase activity, we tested whether ssDNA that does not form secondary structure can stimulate the ATPase activity. Therefore, we incubated increasing amounts of hRad54 with poly(dA) or poly(dT). Both homopolymers were unable to activate the ATPase activity of hRad54 (Fig. 2 B). The measured ATPase activity in the presence of poly(dA) and poly(dT) was 0.1–0.5% and 0.3–0.9%, respectively. However, when the two polymers were allowed to form base pairs before addition to the reaction mixture, they did efficiently activate the hRad54 ATPase activity (Fig. 2 B). We conclude that hRad54 is a dsDNA-dependent ATPase and that the substitution of amino acid 189 from lysine to arginine results in loss of the ATPase activity. The rate of ATP hydrolysis by hRad54 was determined in the presence of dsDNA (Fig. 2 C). The turnover rate was found to be ∼800 mol of ATP min−1 mol−1 hRad54. Thus, hRad54 is a more active ATPase than other DNA-dependent ATPases involved in recombination, such as human Rad51, a DNA strand exchange protein that exhibits ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity with a turnover rate of 0.16 min−1 (14Baumann P. Benson F.E. West S.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The hRad54 ATPase exhibits a turnover rate within the range of DNA helicases involved in recombination and repair, such as RuvB (4.2 min−1) and UvrD (10,000 min−1) (35George J.W. Brosh R.M. Matson S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 38Mézard C. Davies A.A. Stasiak A. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 704-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We varied a number of reaction conditions to determine some requirements for hRad54-mediated ATP hydrolysis. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table I. In addition to dsDNA, divalent cations were found to be essential for ATP hydrolysis. The topology of the dsDNA cofactor is not critical, because duplex linear and supercoiled DNA stimulated the ATPase activity of hRAD54 to similar levels. Like ssDNA, RNA did not activate the hRad54 ATPase activity. Optimal catalytic activity was obtained at pH 7.0 and at a temperature of 25–30 °C. Before analyzing other activities of the hRad54 protein, we determined whether the tags on the protein would interfere with its function. mRAD54 knockout cells were electroporated with the cDNA constructs expressing tagged hRad54 and hRad54K189R proteins. For each construct, 24 clones were analyzed for protein expression by immunoblot analysis using anti-hRad54 antibodies. A number of independent cell lines were identified that expressed either tagged wild-type or mutant protein. Expression levels, which did not vary much between the different clones, ranged from one-half to twice the level found in wild-type ES cells. An example of an immunoblot containing protein extracts frommRAD54 knockout ES cell lines expressing tagged versions of the wild-type and mutant hRad54 proteins is shown in Fig. 3 A. We have shown previously that mRAD54 knockout ES cells are sensitive to ionizing radiation and the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C. In addition, the mRad54 protein could rescue the mitomycin C sensitivity (22Essers J. Hendriks R.W. Swagemakers S.M.A. Troelstra C. de Wit J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Kanaar R. Cell. 1997; 89: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the mRAD54knockout cell lines that expressed the tagged wild-type and mutant hRad54 proteins could rescue the γ-ray and mitomycin C sensitivity. Fig. 3 B shows that the wild-type tagged hRad54 completely corrects the γ-ray sensitivity caused by the mutations in mRAD54. The efficiency of the rescue did not depend on the expression level of hRad54 because a cell line expressing one-half the level of Rad54 found in wild-type cells gave similar results (data not shown). Interestingly, expression of the tagged hRad54K189R protein resulted in a partial rescue of the γ-ray sensitivity (Fig. 3 B). As above, the expression level of hRad54K189R was not critical to the observed effect because an independently obtained cell line, expressing twice the level of Rad54 compared with wild-type cells, gave similar results (data not shown). Tagged hRad54 also rescued the mitomycin C sensitivity of mRAD54 knockout cells (Fig. 3 C). Again, expression of tagged hRad54K189R led to a partial rescue. Similar results were obtained with independent clones expressing different levels of tagged hRad54 and hRad54K189R, respectively (data not shown). We conclude that the amino-terminal polyhistidine tag and the carboxyl-terminal hemagglutin tag do not interfere with the function of the hRad54 protein. Rad54, together with SWI2/SNF2 and Mot1, belongs to the SNF2/SWI2 family of DNA-stimulated ATPases (29Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of the SNF2/SWI2 and Mot1 proteins is essential for their functions in vivo (37Laurent B.C. Treich I. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 39Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G.F. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that the hRad54K189R protein, which is completely deficient in ATPase activity (Fig. 2 A), is partially functional in vivo (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, ATP hydrolysis can, at least in part, be uncoupled from other biological activities of hRad54, implying that other properties of the protein are also important for its function. One of those functions could be in contributing to the formation of multiprotein complexes. The absence of one of the components of such complexes might be more detrimental than the presence of a crippled component. For example, the absence of one of the components of the ERCC1/XPF structure-specific endonuclease causes instability of the other component (40van Vuuren A.J. Appeldoorn E. Odijk H. Yasui A.

Because genetic and physical interactions have been detected among many of theRAD52 group genes and proteins (25Sung P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4106-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), it is likely that these proteins function in the context of complex protein machines. Similar to the observation presented here for hRad54, an ATPase-deficient mutant of the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair protein CSB, which is part of a multiprotein complex, is partially active in vivo as well (49Citterio E. Rademakers S. van der Horst G.T.J. van Gool A.J. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Vermeulen W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11844-11851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because the hRad54 protein contains seven amino acid sequence motifs that are found in many DNA helicases and because it has DNA-dependent ATPase activity, we tested whether hRad54 could use the energy gained from ATP hydrolysis to disrupt base pairing in duplex DNA. We tested five distinct DNA substrates in helicase assays, because DNA helicases differ in their substrate specificity. The first set of three substrates consisted of M13 viral DNA to which oligonucleotides were annealed. One substrate contained a 35-bp duplex region, whereas the others were forked substrates that contained 15-nucleotide noncomplementary regions either 5′ or 3′ of the 35-bp duplex region. The hRad54 protein appeared unable to displace the oligonucleotide from the M13 DNA (Fig. 4 A). The hRad54 protein concentration was varied over the same range as was used for the ATPase assays shown in Fig. 2 (data not shown). The lack of helicase activity cannot be explained by a rapid depletion of ATP, because the inclusion of an ATP regeneration system in the reaction mixture did not result in detectable helicase activity (data not shown). In contrast, the UvrD protein efficiently displaced the oligonucleotide from all three substrates (Fig. 4 A). Our results with hRad54 are consistent with those obtained with the S. cerevisiae Rad54 protein, which also displays no helicase activity on substrates containing noncomplementary ssDNA tails (26Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the RecBCD DNA helicase plays a pivotal role in processing DSBs during recombination (50Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Its substrate is a dsDNA end. Given the involvement of Rad54 in recombinational DSB repair, it was important to test whether the protein exhibited DNA helicase activity on a blunt-ended dsDNA substrate (Fig. 4 B). We were unable to detect any helicase activity of hRad54 on this substrate, even in the presence of an ATP regeneration system and over a wide range of hRad54 concentration. In contrast, UvrD efficiently separated the strands this DNA substrate (Fig. 4 B). Some DNA helicases, such as the E. coli RecG protein, which is involved in recombination and repair, are inactive on forked duplexes and blunt-ended duplex DNA substrates, such as those tested in Fig. 4, A and B. Instead, the RecG protein unwinds substrates containing a three-way duplex branch (31Whitby M.C. Vincent S.D. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, even with this DNA substrate, no helicase activity of hRad54 was detected (Fig. 4 C). On the basis of its amino acid sequence, Rad54 belongs to a superfamily of DNA-dependent ATPases (28Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Many superfamily members have DNA helicase activity. Although the experiments presented above do not rule out the possibility that hRad54 has DNA helicase activity, they make it less likely. Possibly, the seven conserved amino acid sequence motifs that define the superfamily provide a general activity, of which helicase activity could be a subset (51Henicoff S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 291-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This more general activity could be the ability to translocate along DNA at the expense of ATP hydrolysis (52West S.C. Cell. 1996; 86: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). By using the energy gained from ATP hydrolysis translocation of Rad54 along DNA might be useful in at least three stages of homologous recombination. First, in light of the interaction between the Rad54 and Rad51 proteins (26Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 45Jiang H. Xie Y.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4106-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), translocation of Rad54 might provide processivity to Rad51-mediated DNA strand exchange. Compared with the E. coli RecA protein, hRad51 makes short heteroduplex joints (9Baumann P. West S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). A role for Rad54 in extending these joints is consistent with the recent demonstration that S. cerevisiaeRad54 stabilizes D-loops (26Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Providing processivity to joint formation might be especially important in the context of chromatin. Second, translocation of hRad54 could be to promote branch migration of Holliday junctions to extend heteroduplex DNA, in a manner that is analogous to the molecular motor function of the RuvB protein. Third, an alternative function of Rad54 could be in removing the Rad51 protein from joint molecules, formed between the two recombining partners after the initiation of recombination, in order to prevent reversal of the reaction. In this respect, the action of Rad54 would be analogous to that of the Mot1 protein, which disrupts protein DNA-complexes involved in transcription (35George J.W. Brosh R.M. Matson S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The availability of purified hRad54 protein facilitates testing of the possible functions of the protein described above. We are grateful to Claude Backendorf and Geri Moolenaar for the generous gift of purified UvrD protein.

https://openalex.org/W2323797330,"The signaling pathway through which ionizing radiation induces NF-kappaB activation is not fully understood. IkappaB-alpha, an inhibitory protein of NF-kappaB mediates the activation of NF-kappaB in response to various stimuli, including cytokines, mitogens, oxidants and other stresses. We have now identified an ionizing radiation-induced signaling pathway that is independent of TNF-alpha. IkappaB-alpha degradation is rapid in response to TNF-alpha induction, but it is absent in response to ionizing radiation exposure in cells from individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT). Overexpression of wild-type ATM, the product of the gene defective in AT patients, restores radiation-induced degradation of IkappaB-alpha. Furthermore, phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha by immunoprecipitated ATM kinase is increased in control fibroblasts and transfected AT cells following ionizing radiation exposure. These data provide support for a novel ionizing radiation-induced signaling pathway for activation of NF-kappaB and a molecular basis for the sensitivity of AT patients to oxidative stresses."

Increases in the levels of αB-crystallin that had been phosphorylated at Ser-45 and Ser-19, but not at Ser-59, were detected biochemically by isoelectric focusing or SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a subsequent Western blot analysis of extracts of cells collected at the mitotic phase.

The α-crystallin of the bovine lens is composed predominantly of two types of polypeptide, the A (αA1 and αA2) and B (αB1 and αB2) subunits (1Wistow G.J. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). αA1 and αB1 are the phosphorylated forms of the primary gene products, αA2 and αB2 (2Voorter C.E. Mulders J.W. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 3Chiesa R. Gawinowicz-Kolks M.A. Spector A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1438-1441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mass of each subunit is about 20 kDa, and the similarity between the primary structures of the two subunits is greater than 50% (4Van Der Ouderaa F.J. de Jong W.W. Hilderink A. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 49: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The α-crystallins also share sequence similarity with the small heat shock proteins (hsps)1 of numerous species (5de Jong W.W. Leunissen J.A. Voorter C.E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 103-126PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the striking similarities among the primary structures of the carboxyl-terminal half of each molecule (the α-crystallin domain), αA-crystallin, αB-crystallin, hsp27, and p20 (6Kato K. Goto S. Inaguma Y. Hasegawa K. Morishita R. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15302-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are considered to be members of the α-crystallin small hsp family in vertebrates (7Caspers G.-J.

Molecular Chaperones in the Life Cycle of Proteins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 533-575Google Scholar). A common feature of small hsps is their formation of large oligomeric complexes such as αA-crystallin and αB-crystallin in the lens. In the skeletal muscle, αB-crystallin, hsp27, and p20 seem to form a large heteropolymer, because the three proteins were copurified from the extract and coimmunoprecipitated with antibodies against each of the three proteins (6Kato K.

The α-crystallin domain of each small hsp was suggested to be important for this complex formation and the chaperone activity (8Ehrnsperger M. Gaestel M. Buchner J. Fink A.L. Goto Y.

However, we demonstrated recently that αB-crystallin in U373 MG human glioma cells is phosphorylated at three serine residues (Ser-19, -45, and -59) in response to various types of stress (24Ito H.

We raised antibodies in rabbits that recognized αB-crystallin that had been phosphorylated at each of the three serine residues individually (24Ito H. Okamoto K. Hakayama H. Isobe T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29934-29941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In the present study, by using these antibodies, we found that the phosphorylation at each site in αB-crystallin is regulated differently during mitosis, and we obtained evidence suggesting that p44/42 MAP kinase and MAPKAP kinase-2 are responsible for phosphorylation of Ser-45 and Ser-59, respectively, in αB-crystallinin vivo.

U373 MG human glioma cells (obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, OH) at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The cells were seeded on 90-mm dishes, and the medium was changed every 2 or 3 days. HeLa S3, Swiss 3T3, 3Y-1 B1–6 (25Kimura G. Itagaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Mitotic cells were collected by double-block procedures that involved incubations with thymidine and nocodazole (26Zieve G.W. Turnbull D. Mullins J.M. Mcintosh R. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 126: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and also by mechanical release from standard cell cultures. U373 MG cells at confluent cultures were also exposed to various chemicals for 1 h in the CO2 incubator. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, containing 8 g of NaCl, 0.2 g of KCl, 1.15 g of Na2HPO4 and 0.2 g of KH2PO4 in 1000 ml of H2O) and frozen at −80 °C for a few days prior to use. For the Western blot analysis and the assay of phosphorylation activities with the crude extracts of cells, cells were sonicated in 80 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.0, that contained 0.1 m NaF, 0.3 mg/ml Pefablock SC, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.2 μmokadaic acid, and 0.2 μm calyculin A. For the purification of protein kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of αB-crystallin, the frozen cells on each dish were collected and suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, that contained 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.03% Brij 35 (buffer A) supplemented with 0.3 mg/ml of Pefablock SC, 10 μg/ml of trypsin inhibitor, 0.2 μm okadaic acid, and 0.2 μm calyculin A. Each suspension was sonicated and centrifuged at 125,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain the soluble extracts of cells. Indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (27Kato K. Ito H. Inaguma Y. Okamoto K. Saga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26989-26994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All immunostained specimens were examined under a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 410; Karl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Sections of mouse embryonic tissues were prepared, and the immunohistochemical staining of these sections was performed as described previously (28Kozaki K. Miyaishi O. Koiwai O. Yasui Y. Kashiwai A.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed as described by Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar) in 10 or 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. Tricine/SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Schägger and von Jagow (30Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar) in 16.6% polyacrylamide gels that contained 13.3% glycerol. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed as described previously (24Ito H. Okamoto K. Hakayama H. Isobe T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29934-29941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) by the method of O'Farrell (31O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the Protean II system from Bio-Rad (Tokyo). For the Western blot analysis, proteins on a gel were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was incubated successively for 2 h with primary antibodies and then for 1 h with peroxidase-labeled second antibodies. Antigens on the membrane were visualized on x-ray film using a chemiluminescence reagent (Renaissance; NEN Life Science Products). Affinity-purified rabbit antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal decapeptide of αB-crystallin were prepared as described previously (11Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Inaguma Y. Shimizu K. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Rabbit antiserum against the amino-terminal dodecapeptide of αB-crystallin was raised in rabbits by injecting the peptide (MDIAIHHPWIRR-Cys) conjugated with hemocyanin (Sigma) usingN-(4-carboxycyclohexylmethyl)maleimide (32Yoshitake S. Yamada Y. Ishikawa E. Masseyeff R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 101: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and the antibodies were purified by use of a column of bovine αB2-crystallin-coupled Sepharose as described previously (11Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Inaguma Y. Shimizu K. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Antibodies that recognize each of the three phosphorylated serine residues in human αB-crystallin (Ser-19, -45, and -59) were prepared as described previously (24Ito H. Okamoto K. Hakayama H. Isobe T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29934-29941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Because the internal sequence of the peptide (APSWFDTGLSE, residues 57–67, p59S) of human αB-crystallin included a residue different from that in bovine and rat αB-crystallin (the Phe-61 in the human sequence is Ile-61 in bovine or rat), antibodies raised with p59S of the human sequence did not react with bovine and rat αB1-crystallin. Therefore, the peptide of the bovine (and rat) sequence (APSWIDTGLSE-Cys; bovine p59S) was synthesized, and the antiserum was raised in rabbits as described previously (24Ito H. Okamoto K. Hakayama H. Isobe T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29934-29941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The antibodies that recognized the phosphorylated Ser-59S of bovine and rat αB-crystallin were purified with bovine p59S peptide-coupled Sepharose. The binding of anti-p19S, anti-p45S, and anti-bovine p59S to bovine αB1-crystallin was eliminated by preincubation of the various antibodies with bovine αB1-crystallin or with the respective phosphopeptides (Fig. 1), an indication that each antibody recognized the phosphorylation of a specific serine residue in αB-crystallin. Bovine and rat α-crystallins were purified from lenses as described previously (11Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Inaguma Y. Shimizu K. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Bovine αB1- and αB2-crystallins were isolated from the α-crystallin fraction by chromatography on a chromatofocusing column (33Bloemendal H. Groenewoud G. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal 72 (N-72K) peptide of αB2-crystallin was prepared by incubating αB2-crystallin with 0.5% (w/w) lysyl endopeptidase in 10 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for 24–48 h. When an aliquot of the digest was subjected to reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a column of TSK-ODS-80TS (0.46 × 15 cm; Tosoh, Tokyo), the N-72K peptide was eluted as a major peak. The identity of N-72K was confirmed by the analysis of its amino acid sequence with a peptide sequencer (model PPSQ-10; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) after the removal of acetyl methionine at the amino terminus with CNBr, as described previously (6Kato K. Goto S. Inaguma Y. Hasegawa K. Morishita R. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15302-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lysyl endopeptidase-digested rat hsp27 was prepared with the same procedures. The extract of cells, containing 100 μg of protein, was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min with 5 μl of lysylendopeptidase-treated αB2-crystallin (3 mg/ml), 1 mmATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 nm okadaic acid, 100 nm calyculin A, 0.05 m NaF, 0.3 mg/ml Pefablock SC, and 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor in a reaction mixture that was brought to a final volume of 100 μl with 50 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of the sample buffer for Tricine/SDS-PAGE. Aliquots of 2–15 μl of the mixture were subjected to Tricine/SDS-PAGE and a Western blot analysis with antibodies that recognized each of the phosphorylated serine residues or with antibodies against the amino-terminal peptide of αB-crystallin, as described above. For the assays of phosphorylation with [32P]ATP, we used 0.5 mm[γ-32P]ATP (2 μC/tube; ICN Biomedicals Ins., Costa Mesa, CA) and 5 mm MgCl2 in reaction mixtures with a final volume of 50 μl as described above. After 20 min at 30 °C, each reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of the sample buffer, and 30-μl aliquots were subjected to Tricine/SDS-PAGE. After drying, the gels were exposed to x-ray film. The concentrations of soluble protein in extracts were estimated with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Among the three antibodies that recognized the phosphorylated serine residues in αB-crystallin, anti-p45S had relatively high affinity and specificity when crude extracts of U373 MG cells that had been exposed to various types of stress were subjected to IEF and a subsequent Western blot analysis (24Ito H. Okamoto K. Hakayama H. Isobe T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29934-29941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Therefore, we attempted the localization of αB-crystallin phosphorylated at Ser-45 by indirect immunofluorescence staining with antibodies raised against p45S. As shown in Fig. 2 A, various lines of cultured cells, including U373 MG human glioma cells, HeLa S3 cells, human skin fibroblasts, Swiss 3T3 and NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, and 3Y-1 B1–6 rat fibroblasts, were immunostained with antibodies against p45S. Prominent staining of phosphorylated Ser-45 in αB-crystallin was apparent in mitotic cells of all cell lines examined. In most cases, staining was evident as fine granular deposits, with staining throughout the cytoplasm of mitotic cells and clearly separate from the chromosomes. In some interphase cells, there was faint granular staining in the cytoplasm. The specific staining of mitotic cells was confirmed by the treatment of cells with an antimitotic agent, taxol. This treatment increased the number of cells that were immunostained with antibodies against p45S (Fig. 2 B). The incubation of antibodies with p45S abolished the staining, confirming the specificity of staining (Fig. 2 B, d and h). An enhanced phosphorylation of Ser-45 in αB-crystallin seemed to occur during mitosis. Phosphorylation began to appear during prophase and continued until telophase or cytokinesis (Fig. 2 C). The phosphorylation of Ser-45 in mitotic cells was observed in vivo as well as in cultured cells, when the mouse embryonic tissues were subjected to immunohistochemical staining with the same antibody (data not shown). Samples of some human malignant tumors were also positive for immunostaining with antibodies against p45S, and only mitotic cells were immunostained in such cases (data not shown). To test the results obtained in our immunocytochemical studies, we collected U373 MG cells at the mitotic phase after successive treatments of cells with thymidine and nocodazole. We subjected extracts of untreated control cells and of mitotic cells to IEF and a subsequent Western blot analysis with antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal peptide of αB-crystallin (Fig. 3 A, αB-C) or with antibodies against p45S (Fig. 3 A, p45S). The extracts were also subjected to SDS-PAGE and a subsequent Western blot analysis with antibodies against p19S, p45S, p59S, and the carboxyl-terminal peptide of αB-crystallin (Fig. 3 B). After IEF, the two bands of the acidic form of αB-crystallin, corresponding to those of αB1-crystallin purified from bovine lens, were clearly detected in the case of mitotic cells after immunostaining with antibodies both against the carboxyl-terminal peptide of αB-crystallin and against p45S. The results of the SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis revealed that the increases in phosphorylated serine residues in αB-crystallin in mitotic cells corresponded to phosphorylation at Ser-19 and -45, while the levels of phosphorylated Ser-59 tended to be reduced in mitotic cells. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of these three serine residues in αB-crystallin is catalyzed by multiple protein kinases. The increases in the levels of αB-crystallin that had been phosphorylated at Ser-45 in mitotic 3Y-1 B1–6 cells and in mitotic BRL 3A rat liver cells were confirmed by IEF and Western blot analysis, as shown in Fig. 3 C. Phosphorylated αB-crystallin in U373 MG cells was detected after 6 h of exposure to nocodazole, and two bands of phosphorylated αB-crystallin were detected in cells that had been exposed to nocodazole for 12–18 h. However, when cells that had been exposed to nocodazole for 12 h were returned to the standard medium, the phosphorylated αB-crystallin disappeared completely within 6 h (data not shown). These results confirmed our immunohistochemical finding that the level of αB-crystallin phosphorylated at Ser-45 was elevated in mitotic cells. In addition, the SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses revealed that the level of αB-crystallin phosphorylated at Ser-19 was also elevated, while that of αB-crystallin phosphorylated at Ser-59 was depressed in mitotic cells. When bovine αB2-crystallin was incubated with extracts of U373 MG cells in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and Mg2+, the 32P label was barely incorporated into αB2-crystallin, even when we used extracts of cells that had been exposed to PMA and okadaic acid (Fig. 4 A). However, when αB2-crystallin that had been treated with lysyl endopeptidase was used as a substrate, the N-72K peptide was phosphorylated significantly even with extracts of control cells, and the phosphorylation was markedly enhanced with extracts of cells that had been exposed to PMA and okadaic acid (Fig. 4 A). These results suggest that the aggregation properties of the purified αB-crystallin might be different from the native form in cells and that protein kinases might be unable to gain access to sites of potential phosphorylation. The treatment of αB2-crystallin with lysyl endopeptidase resulted in the destruction of the α-crystallin domain and the formation of N-72K peptide, which contained each of the three phosphorylation sites in αB-crystallin accessible to protein kinases. To clarify whether the changes in the levels of αB-crystallin phosphorylated at the various serine residues were the result of changes in the activities of protein kinases that are specific for the respective residues, we assayed the phosphorylation activities in extracts of control and mitotic U373 MG cells using the N-72K peptide of αB2-crystallin as the substrate. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min in the presence of ATP and Mg2+, aliquots of each reaction mixture were subjected to Tricine/SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography (Fig. 4 C) or a Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 B) with the antibodies that recognized each of the three phosphorylated serine residues. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the levels of N-72K phosphorylated at Ser-19 and Ser-45 that had been produced during incubations with extracts of mitotic cells were much higher than the levels after incubations with extracts of control cells, while the levels of N-72K phosphorylated at Ser-59 after incubations with extracts of mitotic cells were lower than those after incubations with extracts of control cells. Thus, the extent of incorporation of 32P into N-72K was similar for the extracts of control and mitotic cells, as shown in the autorad"

https://openalex.org/W2058067037,"Stimulation of platelet aggregation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of receptors and signaling molecules including platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). In this report, we demonstrate that both protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 physically associate with different kinetics of assembly with tyrosine-phosphorylated human PECAM-1 during integrin alphaIIbbeta3-mediated platelet aggregation. Peptido-precipitation analysis revealed that tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides encompassing residues 658-668 and 681-691 of PECAM-1 bound specifically to both protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. We further show that the association of SHP-1 with PECAM-1 occurs through the direct interaction of the src homology region 2 domains of SHP-1 with two highly conserved phosphotyrosine binding motifs within PECAM-1 having the sequences NSDVQpY663TEVQV and DTETVpY686SEVRK (where pY represents phosphotyrosine). In vitro dephosphorylation experiments using phosphotyrosyl PECAM-1 peptides encompassing either Tyr-663 or Tyr-686 revealed induction of SHP-1 catalytic activity, suggesting that PECAM-1 serves as a SHP-1 substrate. Surface plasmon resonance studies reveal that recombinant SHP-2 binds PECAM-1 phosphopeptides with 5-fold higher affinity than recombinant SHP-1. These data suggest that in hematopoietic cells such as platelets, PECAM-1 cellular signaling is regulated by the selective recruitment and activation of two distinct protein-tyrosine phosphatases, SHP-1 and SHP-2, via a common immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory-like motif."
https://openalex.org/W2040807564,"CDC6 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae regulates the DNA replication initiation through the origin recognition complex (ORC). Identification of a human homolog of the CDC6 gene (HsCdc6) suggests a universal role of the gene product in DNA replication. Expression of HsCdc6 is growth-regulated. We investigated the molecular basis of growth-regulated expression of mammalian Cdc6. The promoter activity of isolated HsCdc6 upstream region was activated at late G1 and G1/S boundary in the cell cycle of rat embryonic fibroblast REF52 cells by the addition of serum. The isolated promoter was activated by exogenous expression of E2F without serum stimulation. However a mutant promoter lacking the E2F recognition sites failed to respond to serum stimulation and exogenous expression of E2F. Expression of endogenous Cdc6 was induced by exogenous expression of E2F. Therefore, we concluded that the growth-regulated expression of mammalian Cdc6 was mediated by E2F. Moreover, we demonstrated that exogenous overexpression of either HsCdc6 or HsOrc1 failed to induce DNA synthesis unlike overexpression of E2F1, even though E2F1 induced both Cdc6 and Orc1, suggesting that E2F may regulate the expression of another gene(s), besides Cdc6 and Orc1, required for induction of cellular DNA synthesis in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2050004983,"Abstract The βγ subunits of the heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) that couple heptahelical, plasma membrane-bound receptors to intracellular effector enzymes or ion channels directly regulate several types of effectors, including phospholipase Cβ and adenylyl cyclase. The β subunit is made up of two structurally different regions: an N-terminal α helix followed by a toroidal structure made up of 7 blades, each of which is a twisted β sheet composed of four anti-parallel β strands (Wall, M. A., Coleman, D. E., Lee, E., Iniguez-Lluhi, J. A., Posner, B. A., Gilman, A. G., and Sprang, S. R. (1995)Cell 83, 1047–1058; Lambright, D. G., Sondek, J., Bohm, A., Skiba, N. P., Hamm, H. E., and Sigler, P. B. (1996) Nature 379, 311–319). We have previously shown that sites for activation of PLCβ2, PLCβ3, and adenylyl cyclase II overlap on the “top” surface of the propeller, where Gα also binds (Li, Y., Sternweis, P. M., Charnecki, S., Smith, T. F., Gilman, A. G., Neer, E. J., and Kozasa, T. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 16265–16272). The present study was undertaken to identify the regions on the side of the torus that might be important for effector interactions. We made mutations in each of the outer β strands of the G protein β1 propeller, as well as mutations in the loops that connect the outer strands to the adjacent β strands. Our results suggest that activation of PLCβ2 involves residues in the outer strands of blades 2, 6, and 7 of the propeller. We tested three of the mutations that most severely affected PLCβ2 activity against two forms of adenylyl cyclase (ACI and ACII). Both inhibition of ACI and activation of ACII were unaffected by these mutations, suggesting that if ACI and ACII contact the outer strands, the sites of contact are different from those for PLCβ2. We propose that distinct sets of contacts along the sides of the propeller will define the specificity of the interaction of βγ with effectors."

SREBPs are bound to membranes in a hairpin orientation with their transcriptionally active NH2-terminal segments facing the cytosol.

Next, site 2 protease (S2P) releases the NH2-terminal fragment of SREBP. The S2P gene was recently isolated by complementation cloning using Chinese hamster ovary cells that require cholesterol for growth, due to a mutation in the S2P gene.

To circumvent this problem, in the current studies we transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with the S2P cDNA, assuring multiple copies. We mutagenized the cells, selected for cholesterol auxotrophy, and identified two mutant cell lines (SRD-12A and -12B) that fail to cleave SREBPs at site 1.

The COOH-terminal segment of ∼580 amino acids performs a regulatory role. The SREBPs are inserted into the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope in a hairpin fashion with the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal segments projecting into the cytosol (2Hua X.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).In sterol-depleted cells, a two-step proteolytic process releases the NH2-terminal segments (designated nSREBPs) from the membranes, allowing them to enter the nucleus, where they stimulate transcription of multiple genes encoding enzymes of cholesterol synthesis, including HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, squalene synthase, and others (1Brown M.S.

Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When sterols build up in cells, the proteolytic release of nSREBPs is blocked, and transcription of target genes declines (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar). This system assures cells an adequate supply of cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids while avoiding overaccumulation.A molecular dissection of the two-step cleavage process is currently under way. The first cleavage occurs at site 1, between the Leu and Ser of the sequence RSVLS, which is located in the middle of the hydrophilic luminal loop (11Duncan E.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12778-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Site 1 cleavage occurs in sterol-depleted cells, and it is abolished by sterol excess. This cleavage requires SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), a polytopic membrane protein with a long cytosolically exposed COOH-terminal segment that contains 5 “WD” repeats, which generally mediate protein-protein interactions (12Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 13Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5785-5793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal segment of SCAP forms a tight complex with the COOH-terminal domain of SREBPs, an interaction that is required for site 1 cleavage (13Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5785-5793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition to activating cleavage, current evidence indicates that SCAP serves as the sterol sensor in this system. Five of the eight membrane-spanning segments of SCAP resemble sequences in the membrane-attachment domain of HMG-CoA reductase (12Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In HMG-CoA reductase, this domain mediates rapid degradation when cellular sterols rise (12Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 14Kumagai H. Chun K.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19107-19113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), indicating that it serves as a sterol sensor. In SCAP, the membrane attachment domain also mediates sterol regulation. Indeed, missense mutations within this domain abolish the ability of sterols to suppress the cleavage of SREBPs at site 1 (12Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 15Nohturfft A. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13709-13714Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Sequences resembling the sterol-sensing domain are found in two other proteins that are postulated to interact with sterols, the Niemann-Pick C1 protein, which is required for intracellular transport of cholesterol (16Loftus S.K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Gu J.Z. Cummings C. Brown A. Ellison J. Ohno K. Rosenfeld M.A. Tagle D.A. Pentchev P.G. Pavan W.J. Science. 1997; 277: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), and Patched, which is the receptor for the signaling morphogen, Hedgehog, the only protein known to have a covalently attached cholesterol (17Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1996; 274: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar).Cleavage at site 1 separates SREBPs into two halves, each of which remains membrane-bound, due to the retention of a membrane-spanning segment (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar). Release of the nSREBP requires a second protease that cleaves at site 2, which is a Leu-Cys bond that is located within the NH2-terminal membrane-spanning segment (18Duncan E.A. Dave U.P. Sakai J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17801-17809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This cleavage requires the sequence DRSR, which defines the border between the cytosolic sequence and the membrane-spanning sequence (2Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 18Duncan E.A. Dave U.P. Sakai J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17801-17809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The cleaved Leu-Cys bond is located three residues to the COOH-terminal side of the DRSR (18Duncan E.A. Dave U.P. Sakai J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17801-17809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Following cleavage at this site, the nSREBP leaves the membrane with three hydrophobic residues attached. The site 2 protease is not regulated directly by sterols, but it can act only after site 1 cleavage has separated the SREBPs into two halves.Our laboratory recently employed complementation cloning techniques to isolate a cDNA encoding the site 2 protease (19Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The key was the availability of a mutant line of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells designated M19, which require cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids for growth (20Hasan M.T. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These cells cannot produce their own cholesterol because they are unable to release nSREBPs from membranes (21Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies showed that these cells cleave SREBPs at site 1, but they are unable to cleave at site 2. Under conditions of sterol deprivation, the M19 cells accumulate a membrane-bound intermediate form of nSREBP that is the product of site 1 cleavage (21Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The defect in the M19 cells was corrected by transfection of human genomic DNA (20Hasan M.T. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and this eventually permitted the isolation of the human gene encoding a protein that we call S2P (19Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar).The S2P gene encodes an extremely hydrophobic protein of 519 amino acids that contains the sequence HEIGH, which conforms to the consensus HEXXH that is characteristic of zinc metalloproteases (22Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Substitution of either of the two histidines or the glutamic acid abolished the ability of S2P to restore cleavage at site 2, supporting the argument that S2P is a protease (19Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). S2P differs from all other metalloproteases of higher eukaryotes in its diffuse hydrophobicity. Although some metalloproteases are bound to membranes, they achieve this through a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment. The proteases themselves remain hydrophilic. In contrast, S2P appears to be a polytopic membrane protein with the HEIGH embedded in an otherwise hydrophobic segment. This is appropriate for a protease whose target lies within a membrane-spanning segment.The next challenge in this field is the isolation of the site 1 protease (S1P). In order to use genetic complementation techniques like those used for S2P, a mutant cell line that lacks S1P activity is needed. Up to now, this has been impossible to achieve despite the fact that we and others have selected numerous mutant cell lines that fail to synthesize cholesterol. The selection depends on the polyene antibiotic amphotericin, which kills cells by binding to cholesterol in the plasma membrane (23Chang T.-Y. Chang C.C.Y. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5316-5323Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). If a mutant cell line has lost the ability to synthesize cholesterol, it becomes sterol-depleted after a brief incubation in the absence of cholesterol. As a result, it survives a brief exposure to amphotericin. Wild-type cells, on the other hand, produce their own cholesterol and are therefore killed by amphotericin. After the amphotericin selection, the mutant cells are rescued by the addition of exogenous cholesterol, mevalonate, and unsaturated fatty acids, under which conditions they grow with nearly normal kinetics.To date, all mutant cell lines isolated by the amphotericin method have turned out to have defects in S2P; none has been defective in site 1 cleavage. 2J. Ye, R. B. Rawson, J. L. Goldstein, and M. S. Brown, unpublished observations.2J. Ye, R. B. Rawson, J. L. Goldstein, and M. S. Brown, unpublished observations. We hypothesize that this relates to the observation that CHO cells have only a single copy of the S2P gene, which is located on the X chromosome (19Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Genomic Southern blots showed that the M19 cells have a complete deletion of the S2P locus. The copy of the S2P gene that is on the inactive X-chromosome must have been lost from the parental CHO cells at some time in the past. Thus, a single mutagenic event can destroy the single copy of the S2P gene. On the other hand, the S1P gene is presumed to be present in two copies. The probability of a double inactivation of the two S1P genes is several orders of magnitude lower than the probability of a single mutation in the S2P gene.To circumvent the problem of preferential isolation of S2P mutants rather than S1P mutants, in the current studies we introduced additional copies of the S2P gene into CHO cells by transfection, thereby mitigating against the possibility that a single mutational event could destroy all copies of the gene. We mutagenized the S2P-overexpressing CHO cells and used two different protocols to select the rare cells that have lost two functional copies of the S1P gene. We succeeded in isolating two cell lines, designated SRD-12A and -12B, that have lost the activity of S1P. In this paper, we describe the isolation and characterization of these cells, which should prove useful for expression cloning of the S1P cDNA.RESULTSAs the wild-type parental strain for these studies, we chose CHO-7 cells, which are a clone of CHO-K1 cells that have a high rate of cholesterol synthesis as a result of adaptation to growth in lipoprotein-deficient serum (29Metherall J.E. Goldstein J.L. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15634-15641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the first step, we transfected these cells with a cDNA encoding S2P under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter in a vector encoding resistance to the antibiotic G418. We selected a clone of G418-resistant cells that produces high levels of S2P as determined by immunoblotting (data not shown). We interpreted this finding to indicate that these cells had integrated multiple functional copies of the S2P cDNA and that they therefore would require several mutations in order to lose S2P activity. This clone was designated as CHO/pS2P, and it was used as the parental line for the mutagenesis studies.The CHO/pS2P cells were mutagenized with γ-irradiation, and two different protocols were used to isolate mutants with a defect in S1P. In the first approach, designed to enrich for temperature-sensitive mutants, the cells were grown at 34 °C and shifted to 39 °C for 3–5 h in medium containing newborn calf serum supplemented with additional LDL (10 μg of protein/ml). Under these conditions, the cells will become cholesterol-deficient only if they have a simultaneous block in cholesterol biosynthesis and in LDL receptor activity. The cells were then treated with amphotericin B, and the survivors were returned to 34 °C in medium B, which is supplemented with cholesterol, mevalonate, and oleate (see Table I). The temperature shift/amphotericin selection protocol was repeated four times on subsequent days. Of 6 × 107 cells subjected to this selection, only one clone survived. This clone was designated SRD-12A (sterolregulatory defective-12A). Subsequent studies showed that the phenotype was not temperature-sensitive, and the cells were therefore grown permanently at 37 °C in medium B.Because of the low efficiency of the above procedure, we devised a stepwise selection method that was designed to enrich initially for cells lacking one copy of the S1P gene and subsequently for cells lacking both copies. In this protocol, the mutagenized CHO/pS2P cells were incubated with LDL that was reconstituted with a fluorescent derivative of cholesterol esterified with oleate (PMCA oleate) (26Krieger M. Smith L.C. Anderson R.G.W. Goldstein J.L. Kao Y.J. Pownall H.J. Gotto Jr., A.M. Brown M.S. J. Supramol. Struct. 1979; l0: 467-478Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). When cells are incubated with this lipoprotein at low concentrations, their lysosomes become fluorescent, but only when they express functional LDL receptors. After this incubation, the cells were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and we selected the population whose fluorescence was in the lower 10% of all sorted cells. This population should include those rare cells that had a partial deficiency of LDL receptors, due to a 50% deficiency of S1P activity. The sorted cells were grown in large numbers in medium B and then subjected to a second round of mutagenesis and several rounds of amphotericin B selection in order to select cells that had a block in cholesterol synthesis in addition to LDL receptor deficiency. This procedure yielded more amphotericin-resistant colonies than did the temperature shift protocol. The first mutagenesis was performed with 2 × 107 cells, and we ended up with more than 10 amphotericin-resistant clones. The most vigorous clone was maintained in medium B and is designated SRD-12B.Fig. 1 shows a series of stained Petri dishes in an experiment designed to compare the growth requirements of the SRD-12A and -12B cells, the parental CHO/pS2P cells, and M19 cells, which lack S2P. The parental CHO/pS2P cells grew in medium containing lipoprotein-deficient serum as well as in medium B, which is supplemented with cholesterol, mevalonate, and oleate. In contrast, all three mutant cell lines grew only in the presence of the supplements.To compare the abilities of the CHO/pS2P cells and SRD-12 cells to synthesize cholesterol, we first incubated both cell lines in medium B for 24 h in order to equalize their exposure to cholesterol, oleate, and mevalonate. It was then necessary to deplete the cells of cholesterol in order to activate the processing of SREBPs. For this purpose, the cells were switched into medium containing only lipoprotein-deficient serum. After 24 h, all of the cells appeared healthy. We then pulsed the cells with [14C]acetate and measured its incorporation into [14C]cholesterol and [14C]fatty acids (Table II). The rate of cholesterol synthesis in the SRD-12A and -12B cells was less than 1% of the rate in the parental CHO/pS2P cells. The synthesis of fatty acids averaged about 30% of the rate in the CHO/pS2P cells. These results resemble those reported previously in M19 cells, which lack S2P (35Pai J.-t. Guryev O. Brown M.S.

On day 1, the cells were washed with PBS and switched to medium A supplemented with 5% fetal calf lipoprotein-deficient serum. On day 2, the cells were washed twice with PBS and refed medium A containing 5% fetal calf lipoprotein-deficient serum and 0.5 mM [14C]acetate (25 dpm/pmol). After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the cells were harvested for measurement of the cellular content of [14C]cholesterol and 14C-fatty acids. A blank value representing the amount of [14C]acetate incorporated into [14C]cholesterol (13–45 pmol/h per mg) and14C-fatty acids (7–25 pmol/h per mg) in each cell line that was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C was subtracted from each value. Each value is the mean of triplicate incubations. Open table in a new tab To measure LDL receptor activity, we incubated the SRD-12 cells and the CHO/pS2P cells in medium B for 24 h and then switched them to inducing medium, which contains lipoprotein-deficient serum, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor compactin, and a low level of mevalonate (250 μm), which supplies substrate for nonsterol products (36Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4499) Google Scholar). After 24 h, we added 125I-LDL and measured the rate of high affinity degradation, which is dependent on uptake by LDL receptors (Table III). The SRD-12A and -12B cells degraded 125I-LDL at less than 1% of the rate seen in CHO/pS2P cells.Table IIIReceptor-mediated degradation of 125I-LDL in parental CHO/pS2P cells and mutant cells auxotrophic for cholesterolCell lineHigh affinity degradation of125I-LDLng/5 h per mg proteinCHO/pS2P477SRD-12A5SRD-12B0Cells were set up as described in the legend to Table II.

On day 2, the cells were switched to 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (without glutamine) containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 15 μg of protein/ml of 125I-LDL (155 cpm/ng protein) in the absence or presence of 600 μg of protein/ml of unlabeled LDL. After incubation for 5 h at 37 °C, high affinity degradation of125I-LDL was determined by subtracting the values for nonspecific degradation (with unlabeled LDL) from those for total degradation (without unlabeled LDL). Each value is the mean of triplicate incubations. Open table in a new tab The combined failure to synthesize cholesterol and to take up LDL strongly suggests that the SRD-12A and -12B cells have a deficiency of nSREBPs. To test this hypothesis directly, we incubated the cells in inducing medium with or without sterols and then performed SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on membrane fractions and nuclear extracts (Fig. 2). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and blotted with antibodies against the NH2-terminal segments of SREBP-1 (Fig. 2 A) or SREBP-2 (Fig. 2 B). When the parental CHO/pS2P cells were incubated in the absence of sterols, the precursor forms of SREBP-1 and -2 were found in the membrane fraction, and the NH2-terminal segments were found in the nuclear extracts (lane 1). When sterols were added, the nSREBPs disappeared, and there was a corresponding increase in the precursors (lane 2). In the sterol-deprived M19 cells, there was no detectable nSREBP in the nuclear extracts (lane 3). Instead, there was an intermediate form of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 in the membrane fraction that reflects the product of site 1 cleavage. This intermediate form disappeared in the sterol-treated cells, reflecting the inhibition of site 1 cleavage (lane 4). In the sterol-deprived SRD-12A and -12B cells, we found normal amounts of the SREBP precursors in the membrane fractions, but there was no detectable cleavage product either in the membrane fraction or in the nuclear extract fraction (lanes 5 and 7). Despite the failure to detect SREBP cleavage products in the SRD-12A and -12B cells, we did detect an increase in the amounts of the precursor forms when sterols were added (lanes 6 and 8). The potential significance of this finding is discussed below.Figure 2Sterol-regulated processing of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 in parental CHO cells and mutants auxotrophic for cholesterol. On day 0, the cells were set up at 1.5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish in medium B as described under “Experimental Procedures.” On day 2, the cells were washed twice with prewarmed medium A and then switched to inducing medium C (−sterols) or suppressing medium D (+ sterols). After incubation for 16 h at 37 °C, the dishes received N-acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal to achieve a final concentration of 25 μg/ml. After incubation for 2.5 h, the cells were harvested and fractionated as described previously (21Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the membrane and nuclear extract fractions (150 μg protein/lane) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblot analysis was carried out with 5 μg/ml monoclonal IgG-2A4 for SREBP-1 (A) or 5 μg/ml monoclonal IgG-7D4 for SREBP-2 (B). The filters were exposed to film for 2 and 5 min in A and B, respectively.

The cells were incubated in the presence of fetal calf serum to suppress cleavage and transfected with a cDNA encoding the D443N mutant form of SCAP, which overcomes sterol suppression of the S1P.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)1 is a complex retrovirus that replicates through a DNA intermediate (1Coffin J.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 1767-1847Google Scholar) (reverse transcription is reviewed in Fig. 1). Virions contain two copies of the viral RNA genome, which can be identical yielding homodimeric virions or which can contain variations yielding heterodimeric virions. Reverse transcription entails two primer strand transfers that might be either intramolecular, transferring to the same template, or intermolecular, transferring to the other template. Two possible reasons for the diploid nature of HIV-1, as well as some other retroviruses, are that the obligatory DNA primer strand transfers are intermolecular, necessitating the encapsidation of a second RNA genome, and/or that recombination is a potent force in viral evolution, requiring the second genome to serve as a recombination template (2Temin H.M. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 71-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). DNA primer strand transfers have been investigated for the avian oncoretrovirus, spleen necrosis virus (SNV) (3Panganiban A.T. Fiore D. Science. 1988; 241: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 4Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Science. 1990; 250: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 5Jones J.S. Allan R.W. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that the plus-strand DNA primer transfer is exclusively intramolecular, and the most recent study indicates that the minus-strand DNA primer transfer is primarily intramolecular except for recombinant proviruses, which can undergo either intra- or intermolecular primer strand transfers (3Panganiban A.T. Fiore D. Science. 1988; 241: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 4Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Science. 1990; 250: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 5Jones J.S. Allan R.W. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the emergence of complex retroviruses in recent years, it was not known whether the previous studies investigating primer transfer events using the simpler avian oncoretrovirus, SNV, apply to complex retroviruses such as HIV-1. Recombination has been identified as an important means to incorporate genetic changes into retrovirus genomes. The rate of recombination for SNV was found to be 4 × 10−5 per bp per replication cycle (4Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Science. 1990; 250: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 5Jones J.S. Allan R.W. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the rate of HIV-1 recombination was not examined, previous phylogenetic analyses indicate that 5–10% of sequenced HIV-1 strains are recombinant containing genetic material from different subtypes (6Robertson D.L. Sharp P.M. McCutchan F.E. Hahn B.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Further information regarding the rate and mechanisms of HIV-1 recombination are needed for a more thorough understanding of HIV-1 recombination and its role in HIV-1 variation. In this report, we present a study examining both recombination and the obligatory HIV-1 primer stand transfers. The study was carried out using two vectors based on different strains of HIV-1. The vectors were constructed with minimal deletions such that the size of the vectors was similar to wild-type HIV-1 genomic RNA. After a single cycle of vector virus replication, the nature of primer strand transfers between viral sequences was evaluated. The results indicate that HIV-1 minus-strand DNA primer transfers can be either intra- or intermolecular and that plus-strand primer transfers are intramolecular. A high frequency of homologous recombination was also observed during minus-strand U3 synthesis, which if extrapolated to the entire genome suggests that, on average, approximately three crossovers occur during each round of HIV-1 replication. Possible recombination events during plus-strand primer synthesis were also observed at a lower frequency. These results suggest that both RNAs are typically used during HIV-1 reverse transcription and that intermolecular strand transfers and homologous recombination can contribute significantly to HIV-1 genetic variation. pHIV-gptHXB2 and pSG3.1 were obtained from the AIDS Repository (7Page K.A. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5270-5276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ghosh S.K. Fultz P.N. Keddie E. Saag M.S. Sharp P.M. Hahn B.H. Shaw G.M. Virology. 1993; 194: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In HIV-gptHXB2, part of env was replaced with SV-gpt (Escherichia coli xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (gpt) gene under control of the SV40 promoter). To construct the SG3puroBCSG3 vector, a 1.1-kb deletion was made first in pSG3.1 in the provirus envelope gene from the Bst1107 I site at HIV-1 BCSG3 nucleotide 5965 to theBsrG I site at nucleotide 7086. The deletion was replaced with a 1.4-kbp EcoRI to BsmI fragment from pHY18puro, which contains the SNV U3 promoter and puromycin resistance gene (puro) coding sequence (map available upon request). A human embryonal kidney cell line, 293, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 69TIRevEnv cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.2 mg of G418 per ml, 0.1 mg of hygromycin per ml, and 2 μg of tetracycline per ml (9Yu H. Rabson A.B. Kaul M. Ron Y. Dougherty J.P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4530-4537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HeLaT4 cell line was a gift from Michael Emerman and was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1 mg of hygromycin per ml. Transfections were performed using the modified calcium phosphate precipitation method (10Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar). For infections, 2 × 105 target cells in 60-mm-diameter dishes were first treated with 2 μg of polybrene per ml for 30 min. Treated cells were subsequently inoculated with virus in 0.3 ml of medium. Vector virus titers were determined by infection of HeLaT4 cells with 10-fold serial dilutions of the virus stocks. At 24 h after infection, the cells were selected for resistance either to GPT (250 μg/ml xanthine, 15 μg/ml hypoxanthine, and 7 μg/ml mycophenolic acid), to determine HIV-gptHXB2 vector virus titers, or to puromycin (1 μg/ml), to determine SG3puroBCSG3 vector virus titers. Proviral DNA was amplified from genomic DNA of infected cell clones by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). The primer pair used to amplify the 5′ LTR was 5′-CTACCACACACAAGGCTACT-3′, located close to the 5′ end of U3, and 5′-CTCGCACCCATCTCTCTCCTT-3′, located in the 5′ end of the gag gene. The primer pair used to amplify the 3′ LTR was 5′-CAAGAGGAGGAGGAGGTGGGT-3′, located in thenef gene outside of the 3′ LTR, and 5′-CTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGACT-3′, at the 3′ end of U5. Amplified proviral DNA was purified using QIAquick purification columns (QIAGEN Inc.), digested with AvaII or DdeI, and separated through a 3.5% NuSieve agarose gel (FMC, Rockland, ME). To sequence the PCR products, amplified products were separated from the primers through a 1% agarose gel and were subsequently purified using QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN). The purified DNA was cloned into the pGEM-T vector using pGEM-T Easy vector system according to the manufacturer's direction (Promega). The cloned DNA was sequenced by automated DNA sequencing using either a T7- or SP6-specific primer. Because intermolecular primer strand transfers cannot be recognized from homodimeric virions, the number of proviruses assayed must be corrected to exclude proviruses from homodimeric virions. The anticipated fraction of the progeny proviruses arising from heterozygous virions was determined using the Hardy-Weinberg equation (11Strickberger M.W. Genetics. Macmillan Publishing Co. Inc., New York1976Google Scholar),G 2 + 2GP + P 2= 1, where G = GPT titer/(GPT titer + PURO titer) and P = PURO titer/[GPT titer +PURO titer]. G 2 represents the fraction of homozygous HIV-gptHXB2 virions, 2GP the fraction of heterozygous virions, and P 2 the fraction of homozygous SG3puroBCSG3 virions. The average titer was 4.5 × 104 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml for HIV-gptHXB2, and 5.6 × 102 cfu/ml for SG3puroBCSG3. Therefore, G = 0.99 and P = 0.01. The percentage of heterozygous virions among all virions containing SG3puroBCSG3 RNA was 99% (GP/(P2 + GP) = 99%). Thus, of the 86 puror progeny cell clones examined, proviruses from 85 clones should have resulted from heterozygous virions. Fisher's exact test was used to calculate whether there was a significant difference in minus-strand primer transfer pattern between the two progeny groups that had minus-strand primer initiated from either HIV-gptHXB2 or SG3puroBCSG3.p > 0.05 was considered insignificant. Primer strand transfer events were studied by examining the proviral progeny from heterozygous virions after a single cycle of virus replication (3Panganiban A.T. Fiore D. Science. 1988; 241: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 4Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Science. 1990; 250: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Two different HIV-1 vectors were used to generate heterozygous vector virions. HIV-gptHXB2 and SG3puroBCSG3 areenv-defective HIV-1 vectors derived from different HIV-1 strains, HXB2 and BCSG3, respectively (Fig. 2 A) (7Page K.A. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5270-5276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of the two strains differ by approximately 5%, providing appropriate heterogeneity in the viral LTRs for examining the nature of primer strand transfers. The majority of the vector sequences are viral (86∼89%), with only a deletion of part of env, leaving the rest of the viral genome intact. Therefore, the vector RNAs produced are similar in size to the authentic HIV-1 genome (9.2 ∼ 9.6 kb). The protocol employed to study the primer strand transfer is outlined in Fig. 2 B. To introduce single copies of HIV-gptHXB2 and SG3puroBCSG3 proviruses into the HIV-1 packaging cell line 69TIRevEnv (9Yu H. Rabson A.B. Kaul M. Ron Y. Dougherty J.P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4530-4537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), each vector was first produced as a pseudotyped virus by cotransfection with an amphotropic murine leukemia virus env expression vector pEnvAm (12Markowitz D. Goff S. Bank A. Virology. 1988; 167: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) into 293 cells. Pseudotyped HIV-gptHXB2 vector virus was then used to inoculate 69TIRevEnv cells at a low multiplicity of infection followed by selection for gpt. Individual gptrcell clones were isolated and expanded, and Southern blotting was used to confirm that each cell clone harbored a single copy of the HIV-gptHXB2 provirus (data not shown). These cell clones were subsequently inoculated with pseudotyped SG3puroBCSG3vector virus at low multiplicity of infection, followed by selection with puromycin. After puromycin selection, individual cell clones were isolated, and Southern blotting was again employed to confirm that each cell clone contained a single copy of the SG3puroBCSG3vector provirus (data not shown). Eight independent producer cell clones containing single copies of both HIV-gptHXB2 and SG3puroBCSG3 proviruses were established. These clones were genetically stable and did not produce infectious vector virus when maintained in the presence of tetracycline (9Yu H. Rabson A.B. Kaul M. Ron Y. Dougherty J.P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4530-4537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To initiate a single cycle of replication, tetracycline was removed, and vector virus released from the producer cells was used to inoculate CD4-positive HeLaT4 cells. Infected HeLaT4 cells were selected with puromycin, and 86 individual puromycin-resistant (puror) clones were expanded for proviral DNA analysis. In this system, the vector virus is restricted to a single cycle of replication because the producer cells are CD4-negative and cannot be reinfected by vector virus, whereas the HeLaT4 target cells lack HIV-1 Env and thus fail to produce new infectious particles. Cells harboring two vector proviruses will produce homozygous virions containing two identical viral RNAs as well as heterozygous virions containing two different viral RNAs. Only progeny derived from heterozygous virions are informative for the analysis of primer strand transfers. Among the eight producer cell clones studied, the average vector virus titer for SG3puroBCSG3 was about 100 times lower than that for HIV-gptHXB2. Thus, according to the Hardy-Weinberg equation (11Strickberger M.W. Genetics. Macmillan Publishing Co. Inc., New York1976Google Scholar), the large majority of proviruses (∼99%) in transduced HeLaT4 cell clones selected for puromycin resistance should result from infection by heterozygous virions (see “Experimental Procedures”). This prediction was experimentally borne out (see below). Proviruses in puror target cell clones were analyzed for primer strand transfers using PCR in combination with restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing. As described previously (3Panganiban A.T. Fiore D. Science. 1988; 241: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), one can determine whether intra- or intermolecular primer strand transfers occur during reverse transcription by analyzing the LTRs of progeny proviruses derived from heterozygous virions. When both U3 and U5 sequences originate from the same vector, the minus-strand primer transfer is intramolecular. When U3 and U5 sequences originate from different vectors, the minus-strand primer transfer is intermolecular. The sequence differences between HIV-gptHXB2 and SG3puroBCSG3 in U3 and U5 can be identified by restriction mapping (Fig. 3). Digestion with AvaII reveals U3 sequence differences, whereas digestion with DdeI indicates U5 sequence differences between the two vectors (Fig. 3). By determining the origin of the U3 and U5 sequences, the nature of the minus-strand primer transfer event can be deduced. To analyze the minus-strand primer transfers, the 3′ LTRs were amplified from 86 independent puror target cell clones using primers from the nef region outside the LTR and the 3′ end of U5 (Fig. 3). The resulting PCR products were separately digested with AvaII and DdeI. Representative digestions for five clones are depicted in Fig. 3. In the DdeI digestion, a 488-bp fragment indicates that the 5′ upstream region of the 3′ LTR is of BCSG3 origin, whereas a 444-bp fragment indicates that this region is of HXB2 origin. In addition, a 155-bp fragment indicates that U5 is of BCSG3 origin, whereas a 121-bp fragment indicates that U5 is of HXB2 origin. For the AvaII digestion, three fragments (345, 237, and 158 bp) indicate that U3 is of BCSG3 origin, whereas an uncut 741-bp fragment indicates that U3 is of HXB2 origin. The DdeI digestion of the 3′ LTR of clone 1 produced a 444-bp fragment and a 121-bp fragment. Therefore, for clone 1, both the 5′ upstream region and the U5 are of HXB2 origin. The AvaII digestion of clone 1 produced an uncut 741-bp fragment, indicating that the U3 is of HXB2 origin. Thus, clone 1 had undergone an intramolecular minus-strand transfer with both U3 and U5 originating from HIV-gptHXB2. A similar analysis is shown for four additional clones, producing the pattern depicted under each gel lane. Clone 3 had an intramolecular minus-strand transfer with both U3 and U5 originating from SG3puroBCSG3. Clones 2 and 4 had intermolecular minus-strand transfers with U5 sequences originating from HIV-gptHXB2 and U3 sequences originating from SG3puroBCSG3. Clone 5 had an intermolecular strand transfer with U5 originating from SG3puroBCSG3 and U3 originating from HIV-gptHXB2. Of the 86 progeny target cell clones analyzed, 35 clones showed intramolecular and 40 clones showed intermolecular minus-strand primer transfer patterns. Sequencing results from 10 randomly picked clones were consistent with the restriction enzyme mapping (data not shown), indicating the digestion patterns reflected true primer strand transfer events rather than PCR errors or mutation at the restriction enzyme sites. The distribution of intra- versus intermolecular strand transfers among progeny derived from different producer cell clones was similar (Table I). 11 of the 86 clones yielded restriction patterns that were not consistent with simple intra- or intermolecular strand transfer events. These clones were further analyzed by DNA sequencing and are described in more detail in a later section.Table IPrimer strand transfersProducer cell cloneNo. of target clones analyzedMinus strand1-aStrand transfers during minus- and plus-strand DNA synthesis were determined by restriction enzyme digestion.Plus strand1-aStrand transfers during minus- and plus-strand DNA synthesis were determined by restriction enzyme digestion.InterIntraInterIntraA261214026B18108018C1358013D42204E63306F853061-bThe 5′ LTRs of two clones failed to give PCR products.G32103H84408Total864343084Percentage50%50%0%100%1-a Strand transfers during minus- and plus-strand DNA synthesis were determined by restriction enzyme digestion.1-b The 5′ LTRs of two clones failed to give PCR products. Open table in a new tab Consistent with the prediction of Hardy-Weinberg equation (see “Experimental Procedures”), it was found that all 86 proviruses were derived from heterozygous virions. Based on analysis of the LTRs, 73 of the 86 clones were clearly products of heterozygous virions; 22 had HIV-gptHXB2 LTRs but were puror, 40 had undergone intermolecular minus-strand DNA primer transfer, and 11 had undergone interstrain recombination during U3 synthesis (see below). The remaining 13 clones had SG3puroBCSG3 LTRs, but all of these clones have undergone homologous recombination with HIV-gptHXB2 sequences elsewhere in the genome. 2H. Yu, A. E. Jetzt, Y. Ron, B. D. Preston, and J. P. Dougherty, unpublished observations. Thus, the primer strand transfer analysis was not affected by progeny from homozygous virions. The nature of the plus-strand primer transfer event can be determined by comparing the restriction enzyme digestion patterns of the 5′ and 3′ LTRs (Fig. 4). Two identical LTRs would indicate that the plus-strand primer transfer was intramolecular. Two different LTRs would suggest that plus-strand primer transfer was intermolecular or that recombination and/or mutation had occurred. The sequence origin of U3 and U5 in the 5′ LTR was determined in a fashion similar to that described above. The 5′ LTRs of the 86 progeny cell clones were subjected to PCR using a primer close to the 5′ end of U3 sequence and a primer at the 5′ end of the gag gene. Similar to the 3′ LTR analysis, the PCR products were separately digested with DdeI and AvaII. Representative digestions for five clones are depicted in Fig. 4. In the DdeI digestion, a 323-bp fragment indicates that the U5 is of BCSG3 origin, whereas two fragments (201 and 121 bp) indicate that U5 is of HXB2 origin. For theAvaII digestion, three fragments (342, 255, and 150 bp) indicate that U3 and the region immediately 3′ to the LTR are of BCSG3 origin, whereas an uncut 747-bp fragment indicates that the U3 and 3′ downstream regions are of HXB2 origin. For the AvaII digestion, two other patterns are possible. Two fragments, 405 and 342 bp, indicate that U3 is of BCSG3 origin and the 3′ downstream region is of HXB2 origin. Two fragments, 597 and 150 bp, indicate that U3 is of HXB2 origin and the 3′ downstream region is of BCSG3 origin. TheDdeI digestion of the 5′ LTR of clone 1 produced a 201-bp fragment and a 121-bp fragment. Therefore, for clone 1, U5 is of HXB2 origin. The AvaII digestion of the 5′ LTR of clone 1 produced an uncut 747-bp fragment. Therefore, for clone 1, U3 and the 3′ downstream region are of HXB2 origin. A similar analysis for four additional clones is shown, producing the pattern depicted at the bottom of Fig. 4. Thus, the U3 and U5 sequences for clone 1 originated from HIV-gptHXB2 and for clone 3 originated from SG3puroBCSG3. Clones 2 and 4 had U5 sequences from HIV-gptHXB2 and U3 sequences from SG3puroBCSG3. Clone 5 had U5 sequences originating from SG3puroBCSG3 and U3 sequences from HIV-gptHXB2. As compared with the 3′ LTR sequences analyzed in Fig. 3, the U3 and U5 origin patterns were identical for both LTRs among the five clones, indicating intramolecular primer strand transfers during plus-strand synthesis. Of 86 progeny target cell clones, 5′ LTR sequences were successfully amplified from 84 proviruses. Sequence changes might have occurred that affected PCR amplification in 2 of 86 clones. 81 clones displayed intramolecular primer strand transfer during plus-strand DNA synthesis (Table I). 13 of 81 clones were selected randomly and subjected to DNA sequencing. The results were consistent with the restriction enzyme mapping (data not shown). The PCR product of one of the 84 clones was consistently smaller in size than the rest of the clones in three separate experiments, effectively ruling out a PCR artifact. Sequencing analysis indicated a 400-bp deletion, encompassing the majority of the U3 and part of the R sequences in the 5′ LTR. The U5 region was intact and was from SG3puroBCSG3. The U3 remnant was compatible with the SG3puroBCSG3 U3 sequence. Despite the deletion, the U3 and U5 origins matched the 3′ LTR, suggesting this clone had also undergone intramolecular plus-strand primer transfer. Two clones yielded differences between the 5′ LTR and 3′ LTR. In clone 158, U5 sequences were from HIV-gptHXB2 in both 5′ and 3′ LTRs, whereas U3 was from HIV-gptHXB2 in the 5′ LTR and from SG3puroBCSG3 in the 3′ LTR. In clone D3, U3 sequences originated from HIV-gptHXB2 in both 5′ and 3′ LTRs, but U5 was from SG3puroBCSG3 in the 5′ LTR and from HIV-gptHXB2 in the 3′ LTR. These would not be the expected patterns from intermolecular primer strand transfers during plus-strand synthesis. Instead, it is more likely that they resulted from recombination during plus-strand primer synthesis. The growing point of plus-strand primer synthesis might have crossed over to the other minus-strand DNA template. Alternatively, recombination might have occurred between the two plus-strand primer DNAs. As noted above, 11 of 86 clones yielded unexpected digestion patterns within the 3′ LTR, inconsistent with either a simple intra- or intermolecular minus-strand DNA primer transfer. The 11 clones were further examined by DNA sequencing of both 5′ and 3′ LTRs. Sequence analysis indicated that 7 of those clones (clones 106, 113, 151, 153, D1, D17, and D23) had undergone an intramolecular minus-strand primer transfer and one homologous recombination event (a single crossover) (Fig. 5). Four of the clones (clones 141, 143, 155, and D30) had undergone an intermolecular transfer during minus-strand primer synthesis plus homologous recombination, in which three had undergone a single crossover and one a double crossover (Fig. 5). The 5′ LTRs of the 11 clones showed recombination patterns consistent with those observed in the 3′ LTRs, suggesting that the recombination events occurred during minus-strand DNA synthesis. Given the target size of the U3 region (452 bp), the recombination rate during minus-strand DNA synthesis was 3 × 10−4 per bp per replication cycle. As indicated in Fig. 5 A, homologous recombination events can occur throughout U3. However, four independent proviruses generated from two different producer cell clones underwent a homologous recombination in the same segment (nucleotides 192 ∼ 217, clones 141, 151, 153, and D1, Fig. 5 A), suggesting a potential hot spot for recombination. One mutation, a G to A mutation in clone D30 (nucleotide 159, Fig. 5 A), was observed in the crossover regions among the 11 recombinant clones. We have examined the nature of HIV-1 primer strand transfers and have also gained insight into the rate and the strandedness of recombination. Both intra- and intermolecular primer strand transfers were observed during minus-strand DNA synthesis, whereas only intramolecular strand transfers occurred during plus-strand DNA synthesis. Sequence analysis of the LTRs also revealed a high rate of homologous recombination, which if extrapolated to the entire genome, indicates crossovers occur at a rate of almost three per genome per replication cycle during minus-strand DNA synthesis. Both intra- and intermolecular strand transfers were observed during minus-strand DNA synthesis, and they occurred with similar frequencies (Table I). The pattern of minus-strand primer transfer in HIV-1 seems to contrast with that reported for SNV (5Jones J.S. Allan R.W. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was observed that minus-strand primer transfers were mainly intramolecular for SNV (5Jones J.S. Allan R.W. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this aspect of HIV-1 replication differs from SNV. This might be related to the significantly higher rate of homologous recombination observed for HIV-1 (3 × 10−4/bp/cycle) compared with SNV (4 × 10−5/bp/cycle) (4Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Science. 1990; 250: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 5Jones J.S. Allan R.W. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the nonrecombinant SNV proviruses, minus-strand DNA primer transfers were primarily intramolecular (95 out of 96 nonrecombinant proviruses) (5Jones J.S. Allan R.W. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, among the smaller population of recombinant SNV proviruses (10%), similar numbers of intra- and intermolecular minus-strand primer transfers were observed (4Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Science. 1990; 250: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 5Jones J.S. Allan R.W. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the apparently higher rate of HIV-1 recombination, the majority of the HIV-1 proviruses are presumably recombinant, maintaining the correlation between disordered minus-strand primer transfer and recombination. Thus, the underlying significant difference between HIV-1 and SNV may lie with differences in their rates of recombination. Differences in the experimental approach may also contribute to the contrasting results obtained for HIV-1 and SNV (5Jones J.S. Allan R.W. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, two vectors similar in size to wild-type HIV-1 were used, the majority of sequences in the vectors were viral, and natural viral heterogeneity between the two HIV-1 strains was employed to analyze primer strand transfers. These features differed from previous studies (5Jones J.S. Allan R.W. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1556-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). However, it is most likely that the contrasting results are due to inherent differences between the two viruses. Three potential differences between the viruses are described below. First, the biochemical properties of the RTs might differ such that HIV-1 RT promotes more frequent strand transfers. Second, the HIV-1 accessory proteins, which have been shown to effect reverse transcription (14Aiken C. Trono D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5048-5056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mansky L.M. Virology. 1996; 222: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Schwartz O. Marechal V. Danos O. Heard J.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4053-4059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), might also influence the rate and nature of strand transfers. Third, the structure of the HIV-1 core particle, which is clearly different from that of oncoretroviruses such as SNV (17Vogt V.M. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1997: 27-69Google Scholar), might place less constraints upon HIV-1 strand transfers. At this juncture, it is unclear which, if any, of these factors accounts for the differences. However, all three possible explanations provide direction for future studies of the underlying mechanism of retroviral strand transfers. Also noteworthy is that there was about a 100-fold difference in titer between the two vectors used in this study. Moreover, minus-strand primer synthesis initiated more efficiently from HIV-gptHXB2 than from SG3puroBCSG3 genomic RNA. The ratio was about 3:1 (66 proviruses initiated from HIV-gptHXB2 and 20 from SG3puroBCSG3, data not shown). As demonstrated in previous reports, different HIV-1 viral isolates may exhibit different replication characteristics (18Fenyo E.M. Albert J. Asjo B. AIDS. 1989; 3 Suppl 1: S5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19Tersmette M. de Goede R.E. Al B.J. Winkel I.N. Gruters R.A. Cuypers H.T. Huisman H.G. Miedema F. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2026-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aside from the differences observed in this study, both HIV-gptHXB2 and SG3puroBCSG3 genomes successfully served as templates for strand transfers. Concerns may arise that the strand transfers examined were intrinsically linked to recombination due to the experimental procedure and that proviruses which had undergone recombination between the marker gene (puro) and the 3′ LTR may not accurately reflect the quality of the primer strand transfer. Actually, the proviruses with U3s of SG3puroBCSG3 origin did not have to undergo recombination to be scored. Within this subpopulation, there are two groups: those proviruses with U3 of SG3puroBCSG3 (S) origin and U5 of HIV-gptHXB2 (H) origin, and those proviruses with both U3 and U5 of S origin. The proviruses with the U3/U5 pattern SH were products of intermolecular minus-strand transfer, whereas those with the pattern SS were products of intramolecular minus-strand transfer. Among the 86 proviruses analyzed, it has been ascertained that 28 SH clones and 10 SS clones did not undergo recombination between the marker and the 3′ LTR representing a population not intrinsically linked to recombination. 3A. E. Jetzt, H. Yu, and J. P. Dougherty, unpublished data. Since reverse transcription initiated three times more efficiently from HIV-gptHXB2, producing three times more clones with U5 of H origin, the relative ratio of intermolecular (SH, 28 clones) to intramolecular (SS, 10 clones) can be normalized by multiplying the SS group by three. Thus, within the population for which selection was not linked to recombination, the relative number of inter- to intramolecular strand transfers was equivalent indicating that the experimental approach employed accurately reflects the nature of the primer strand transfers. 11 clones underwent recombination during minus-strand U3 synthesis, suggesting a recombination rate of approximately 3 × 10−4 per bp per replication cycle during minus-strand DNA synthesis, or about three crossovers per genome per replication cycle. The high rate of recombination in the relatively small U3 region (452 bp) is consistent with the observation that the U3 of a high proportion of puror proviruses has originated from HIV-gptHXB2 (35 of 86), so they would have undergone at least one recombination in the 1.9-kb region between the 3′ LTR and puro to retain puro marker gene. This homologous recombination rate of HIV-1 is 5–15-fold higher than that reported for SNV (4Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Science. 1990; 250: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 5Jones J.S. Allan R.W. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that different retroviruses have different recombination rates. Three models have been proposed to explain retroviral recombination (20Vogt P.K. Possible Episomes in Eukaryotes.in: Sylvestri L. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1973Google Scholar, 21Hunter E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1978; 79: 295-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Coffin J.M. J. Gen.

Both the “forced copy choice” model and the “minus-strand exchange” model favor recombination during minus-strand DNA synthesis. The “forced copy choice” model hypothesizes that reverse transcriptase switches template when it encounters RNA breaks, whereas the “minus-strand exchange” model suggests that low processivity of RT results in crossovers during minus-strand synthesis without the need of a damaged template (1Coffin J.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 1767-1847Google Scholar, 20Vogt P.K. Possible Episomes in Eukaryotes.in: Sylvestri L. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1973Google Scholar,22Coffin J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1979; 42: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The “strand displacement assimilation” model proposes that DNA fragments are displaced during plus-strand DNA synthesis from one template and subsequently assimilated by the plus-strand DNA synthesized from the other template, causing recombination during plus-strand synthesis (21Hunter E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1978; 79: 295-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Skalka A.M. Boone L. Junghans R. Luk D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 19: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This study suggests that homologous recombination occurs most frequently during minus-strand DNA synthesis because the majority of the crossovers were found in both LTRs (Figs. 1and 5 B). Although these experiments do not distinguish between the “forced copy choice” and “minus-strand exchange” models, given the high rate of recombination and the reported low processivity of HIV-1 RT (24Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Isel C. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we would favor the “minus-strand exchange” model. The limited number of clones that apparently underwent recombination during plus-strand synthesis suggests that “strand displacement assimilation” also occurs but at a lower frequency. However, because of the relatively small number of plus-strand recombinants observed, further analysis is required to more rigorously evaluate the relative contributions of minus-strand and plus-strand crossovers to HIV-1 recombination. 12 crossover segments were identified by DNA sequencing. 8 were spread relatively randomly throughout U3, whereas 4 of 12 were found within a 24-bp segment, suggesting that this represents a relative hot spot for recombination (Fig. 5 A). It is possible that the primary sequence and/or RNA secondary structure in this segment induces RT to pause, providing a greater opportunity for RT to switch strands. This is supported by in vitro experiments demonstrating that pause sites enhance strand transfers by HIV-1 RT (26Wu W. Blumberg B.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 325-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, one characteristic of HIV-1 RT-mediated strand transfers observed in vitro does not seem to occur during replication, namely the correlation between the very high frequency of mutation and strand transfers. It was previously reported using in vitro assays that HIV-1 RT incorporated additional bases about 50% of the time beyond the 5′ end of both RNA and DNA template ends (27Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Science. 1992; 258: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 28Patel P.H. Preston B.D. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and it was shown that mutations occurred 30% of the time at one frequently utilized strand transfer point (26Wu W. Blumberg B.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 325-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It was suggested that if this occurs in vivo, it would contribute significantly to HIV-1 genetic variation (27Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Science. 1992; 258: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 28Patel P.H. Preston B.D. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the 12 crossover segments identified, only one mutation was observed, yielding a G to A mutation (Fig. 5 A). Whether this mutation occurred during recombination or is a random error of RT is not known. Also, from the 10 clones subjected to sequencing analysis in the 3′ LTR, no mutation was observed at the U3 and R border, where such mutation would be expected upon formation of the blunt end before transfer. Thus, the DNA strand transfers in vivo did not seem to increase the rate of mutagenesis to the level predicted by the in vitroexperiments. Similarly, in an in vivo assay, Zhang and Temin (29Zhang J. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2409-2414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that recombination is not an error-prone process for Moloney murine leukemia virus. The difference between in vivo and in vitro studies suggests that viral factors and/or cellular components or conditions can affect the mechanism of HIV-1 recombination. We observed that intermolecular minus-strand primer transfers occur about half the time and that there is a high rate of homologous recombination. These data suggest that both virion RNAs are typically used during HIV-1 replication to form a single provirus. This seems to contrast somewhat with a previous study using SNV, where it was concluded that one RNA is sufficient for retrovirus replication (5Jones J.S. Allan R.W. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although we do not exclude the possibility that one RNA molecule is sufficient for HIV-1 replication, these results indicate that it is the exception rather than the rule. The higher recombination rate intrinsic to HIV-1 would seem to be responsible for this difference. Is genetic exchange between viral genomes of heterodimeric virions an important influence upon HIV-1 variation? This mechanism of genetic variation requires coinfection of the same cell by heterogeneous virions. Although the frequency of coinfection in vivo is unknown, recent studies on various HIV-1 isolates suggest that coinfection in vivo may not be a rare phenomenon (6Robertson D.L. Sharp P.M.

Given the large virus number (1010 virions produced per day), rapid turnover rate of HIV-1 (t 1/2 = 0.24 days) in vivo (35Ho D.D. Neumann A.U. Perelson A.S. Chen W. Leonard J.M. Markowitz M.

Science. 1996; 271: 1582-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (2846) Google Scholar), and potentially higher local viral concentration in lymphoid organs, the percentage of mosaic virus generated through intermolecular strand transfers and recombination might be fairly high. From an evolutionary point of view, utilization of both viral genomic RNAs is in the best interest of retroviral replication. It provides the virus with maximum genetic flexibility and reduces the chance of leading to a replicative “dead end” (2Temin H.M. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 71-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The results presented in this study reveal the nature of HIV-1 primer strand transfer events and the recombination rate of HIV-1 during minus-strand DNA synthesis. These results should not only help to further the understanding of the HIV-1 replication process but also have an impact on drug and vaccine development and assessment. We thank Martin E.

Its regulation of apoptosis in the context of oncogene overexpression suggests that apoptosis constitutes an important component of p53's tumor suppressor activity. In transgenic mice inactivation of p53, either by germ-line mutation or by expression of the p53-binding domain of SV40 large T antigen leads to attenuation of apoptosis and rapid tumor progression (4Symonds H. Krall L. Remington L. Saenz-Robles M. Lowe S. Jacks T. Van Dyke T. Cell. 1994; 78: 703-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). p53-mediated apoptosis has also been implicated as an important mechanism by which many antitumor treatments kill cancer cells (5Fisher D.E.

Thus, studies of p53-mediated apoptosis may have important implications for cancer treatment. The mechanism by which p53 modulates apoptosis is incompletely understood. Cell-based studies have provided evidence that p53 can induce apoptosis through either transcription-dependent or transcription-independent mechanisms (1Gottlieb T. Oren M. Biochim. Biophys.

In the transcription-dependent pathway(s), the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3, the death receptor KILLER/DR5, the zinc finger protein PAG608, and proteins involved in generation or response to oxidative stress are potentially important transcriptional targets of p53 (7Oltvai Z.N.

Little is currently known about the mechanistic basis for p53-mediated apoptosis that is independent of transcription, which may be part of the transcription-independent activities of p53 involved in tumor suppression (13Unger T.

A cell-free p53-regulated apoptosis system would be useful for biochemically dissecting this medically important pathway. The possibility that a cell-free system may be able to recapitulate p53-dependent apoptosis is suggested by evidence that p53 can induce apoptosis independent of its transcription function (16Caelles C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 370: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 17Wagner A.J. Kokontis J.M. Hay N.

In these studies, p53-dependent apoptosis was not blocked by inhibition of transcription or translation, and p53 mutations have been defined whose behavior uncouples transcriptional activity from apoptotic activity within cells. In different cellular contexts, apoptosis and transcriptional activities of p53 appeared to be more tightly coupled (20Sabbatini P. Lin J. Levine A.J. White E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2184-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 21Attardi L.D. Lowe S.W. Brugarolas J. Jacks T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3693-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The measurement of cell-free apoptosis requires a biochemical surrogate for active apoptotic death, which has been facilitated by the discovery that apoptosis is executed by the activation of caspases. Caspases mediate apoptosis by cleaving a number of intracellular proteins (“death substrates”) (22Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar, 23Fraser A. Evan G. Cell. 1996; 85: 781-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). One of the first identified caspase substrates is poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP),1 a target of caspase-3 (CPP32, apopain, YAMA) (24Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G.

Because activation of this caspase is a common step in apoptosis, PARP cleavage by caspase-3 is now widely used as a biochemical marker for apoptosis, including in studies of cell-free systems (26Martin S.J.

Here we report that cell-free extracts from γ-irradiated, transformed p53 wild-type mouse or rat embryo fibroblasts induce caspase activation after a latent phase. This caspase activation requires functional p53: immunodepletion or inactivation of p53 either by recombinant SV40 large T antigen or anti-p53 IgG blocks caspase activation early, but not late, in cell-free incubations. Caspase activation is not blocked by immunodepletion of Bax, a transcriptional target of p53 (8Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), or cytochrome c, a co-activator of caspase-3 (27Liu X.S. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.D. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar). Moreover an ATP analog, AMP-PNP, blocks p53-dependent caspase activation via cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated repression, an effect which was corroborated in vivo by evidence that cAMP rescues cells from diverse triggers of p53-dependent apoptosis. These results demonstrate that p53 can transduce apoptotic signals through a Bax/cytochrome c-independent pathway. E1A/Ras-transformed mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% newborn calf serum. Primary rat embryo fibroblasts (REFs) and Myc/Ras-transformed REFs were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% newborn calf serum. Exponentially growing cells at 60–80% confluence were either untreated or treated with 10 Gy of ionizing radiation using a Gammacell 40 equipped with a 137Cs source. At various times after irradiation, the cells were harvested, collected by centrifugation, and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. For DNA fragmentation analysis, cells were harvested at 16 h after irradiation, and apoptotic DNA was isolated and analyzed as described (29Herrmann M. Lorenz H.-M. Voll R. Grunke M. Woith W. Kalden J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5506-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). To make cell-free extracts, the cell pellet was resuspended at 108 cells per 0.25 ml of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 3 mmdithiothreitol, 4 mm Pefabloc, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After incubating on ice for 15 min, the cells were disrupted by douncing 15 times in a Wheaton douncer with a tight pestle. The lysates were directly centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a Sorvall RC M120 ultracentrifuge. The resulting supernatants (protein concentration ∼8 mg/ml) were collected and stored at −80 °C. For in vitro induction of PARP-cleaving activity, 8–10 μl of extracts were incubated at 32 °C for various times, after which 80 ng of recombinant PARP (a truncated form comprising the first 338 N-terminal amino acids and including the CPP32 cleavage site) was added for 5 min at 37 °C. For assays of in vivo activated PARP-cleaving caspases, 10 μl of extract was incubated with 80 ng of recombinant PARP for 15 min at 37 °C. At the end of the reaction, 4× SDS sample buffer was added. The samples were boiled for 4 min, subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then probed with a monoclonal antibody (C2.10) against PARP (G. Poirier, Université Laval, Canada) and visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant SV40 large T antigen, either as lysates (200–400 ng of total proteins) from recombinant T antigen baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (generously provided by J. DeCaprio, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute) or as purified, bacterially produced T antigen (0.5–1 μg, Chimerx), was added to extracts at various time points during the 32 °C incubation period. Lysates from wild-type baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells or bovine serum albumin were used as controls. 200–400 ng of purified, polyclonal IgG against full-length p53 or the control IgG against the tyrosine kinase Fyn (both from Santa Cruz) was used in the indicated PARP cleavage assays. For cytochrome c experiments, 200 ng of cytochromec (Sigma) was added to extracts at the beginning of the 32 °C incubation period. Nucleotides ATP, ATPγS, AMP-PNP, and cAMP were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, and 1 mm final concentration was used in the indicated experiments. Catalytic subunits of PKA and a specific peptide inhibitor of PKA (PKI 6–22) were purchased from New England Biolabs and Calbiochem, respectively. 1 unit of PKA or 200 nm PKI 6–22 was used in the indicated experiments. 5 μg of monoclonal antibodies against mouse p53 (equal mixture of Ab-1, -3, -4, and -5; Oncogene Science), Bax (Trevigen), cytochrome c (Pharmingen), or microphthalmia (as a control) were incubated with 200 μl of extracts for 2 h on ice. The immune complexes were then cleared by two sequential rounds of incubation with a precoated and washed protein A/G-agarose bead pellet (from 30 μl of 50% suspension, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 h in a rotator at 4 °C. The beads were subsequently pelleted by centrifugation for 2 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were collected and used for in vitroPARP cleavage assays. Myc/Ras-transformed REFs were plated at 4 × 105 per 60-mm plate. 8 h after plating, 10 μm forskolin in Me2SO or the same volume of Me2SO was added, and the cells were either untreated or immediately treated with 5 Gy of ionizing radiation. In serum starvation experiments, E1A/Ras-transformed p53 wild-type MEFs were plated at 4 × 105 per 60-mm plate. 8 h after plating, the cells were washed with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing either 20% or 2% serum (equal parts fetal bovine and newborn calf sera) with or without forskolin (10 μm). At 72 h after irradiation or 48 h after serum deprivation, adherent and floating cells were pooled, collected by centrifugation, and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-annexin V or propidium iodide were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Trevigen). γ-Irradiation triggers apoptosis in oncogene-transformed MEFs and REFs, as indicated by the characteristic fragmentation of genomic DNA (Fig. 1 a, lanes 3–6) (30Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2947) Google Scholar). Although E1A/Ras-transformed p53 wild-type fibroblasts undergo radiation-induced apoptosis, genetically related E1A/Ras-transformed p53−/− MEFs do not (lanes 1 and 2) (17Wagner A.J. Kokontis J.M. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2817-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 30Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2947) Google Scholar). Irradiated primary fibroblasts also fail to undergo apoptosis (lanes 7 and 8), instead undergoing cell cycle arrest (data not shown) (30Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2947) Google Scholar). Consistent with the role of caspases in apoptosis, by 4 h after irradiation, extracts from transformed p53+/+ MEFs, but not from transformed p53−/−MEFs, contain active caspases that readily cleave the death substrate PARP in vitro (exogenous truncated PARP, Fig. 1 b). In an effort to recapitulate the p53-dependent activation of caspases in a cell-free system, extracts were made from E1A/Ras-transformed p53+/+ MEFs within 1 h after irradiation. The extracts were then incubated at 32 °C for various times, after which recombinant PARP was added for 5 min, and PARP cleavage was determined by immunoblot. At 10 h, the extracts exhibited robust caspase activity (Fig. 2 a). No PARP-cleaving activity was induced in extracts either from transformed p53−/−MEFs, whether or not they had been irradiated, or from unirradiated transformed p53+/+ MEFs as long as 24 h after incubating at 32 °C (Fig. 2 b), suggesting that the caspase activity was specific for in vivo irradiation rather than in vitro incubation per se. Caspase induction with similar kinetics was also observed in extracts from irradiated Myc/Ras-transformed REFs (Fig. 2 c). Consistent with the notion that irradiation leads to p53-driven cell cycle arrest (rather than apoptosis) in primary cells, extracts from untransformed REFs showed no caspase activity even after 24 h of incubation (Fig. 2 d). This was not due to the absence of caspase precursors in the extracts because PARP-cleaving activity could be stimulated by addition of cytochrome c (Fig. 2 d, lane 7), a co-activator of caspase-3 (27Liu X.S. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.D. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar). The PARP-cleaving activity correlated with the appearance of the p20 subunit of activated caspase-3/CPP32 (Fig. 2 e). To determine whether activation of caspases in the cell-free extracts remains p53 dependent, we first performed immunodepletion experiments using monoclonal antibodies against p53. As shown in Fig. 3 a, immunodepletion of p53 from extracts before the 32 °C incubation period completely abrogated the caspase activation (lane 3). Identical p53 immunodepletions at later time points (following 4 or 8 h at 32 °C) failed to block the caspase activation (lanes 4 and 5). No effect on the caspase activation was observed with control immunodepletions (lane 2). These results suggest that p53 function is required at an early stage upstream of caspase activation in the cell-free extracts. Addition of recombinant p53 derived from p53-baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells to extracts depleted of endogenous p53 has so far failed to activate caspases in this system (data not shown), which could reflect lack of proper post-translational modifications or other critical associations. To further examine the p53 dependence of this caspase activation, we employed SV40 large T antigen, which has been demonstrated to block p53-mediated apoptosis in vivo (4Symonds H. Krall L. Remington L. Saenz-Robles M. Lowe S. Jacks T. Van Dyke T. Cell. 1994; 78: 703-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 b, baculovirus lysates containing T antigen completely inhibited the induction of caspase activity in extracts from both irradiated transformed MEFs and REFs, but only when added at the beginning of the 32 °C incubation period (Fig. 3 b, lanes 1, 2, and 7). Control lysates from wild-type baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells failed to do so (Fig. 3 b, lanes 3 and 6). Purified bacterial recombinant T antigen also blocked the caspase activation in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3 b, lanes 8–10). Similarly, purified polyclonal IgG against full-length p53, but not nonspecific purified polyclonal IgG, prevented the induction of PARP-cleaving activity in both MEF and REF extracts only when added before the 32 °C incubation period (Fig. 3 c). Failure of the extracts to induce PARP cleavage upon immunodepletion or inactivation of p53 might in principle have been caused by direct disruption or depletion of PARP-cleaving caspases by these manipulations, although this is unlikely because p53 depletion or T antigen addition at later time points did not inhibit caspase activity (Fig. 3, a and b). Further evidence of the specificity of the p53 inactivations came from the observation that exogenous cytochrome c restores caspase activation when added to extracts depleted of p53 (Fig. 4 a, lanes 4 and 5) or in the presence of T antigen (lanes 1–3). Thus, these treatments are unlikely to directly inactivate caspases but are more likely to block an upstream activity, consistent with an early requirement for p53. The potential roles of Bax and cytochrome c in the cell-free system were next examined. Bax is a transcriptional target of p53, and its overexpression promotes cell death (7Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar, 8Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Cytochrome chas been shown to induce caspase activation through its interaction with the human homolog of Caenorhabditis elegans CED-4, Apaf-1, and caspase-9 (31Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar, 32Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6154) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ability of cytochromec to induce PARP-cleaving activity in extracts depleted of p53 or in the presence of T antigen suggested that cytochromec may function either downstream of p53 or in a distinct pathway to activate caspases. As shown in Fig. 4 b, in contrast to immunodepletion of p53 which blocked caspase activation, extracts depleted of either Bax or cytochrome c remained fully active for PARP cleavage after the 32 °C incubation period. The failure of Bax depletion to prevent caspase activation in the cell-free system is consistent with the report that p53-dependent apoptosis remains functional in Bax−/− mouse thymocytes (33Knudson C.M. Tung K.S. Tourtellotte W.G. Brown G.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 1995; 270: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar), although it could play a role in setting cellular apoptosis thresholds because measurable effects have been detected in Bax-deficient fibroblasts (34McCurrach M.E. Connor T.M.F. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Lowe S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2345-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The finding that cytochrome c depletion did not block the ability of the extracts to activate caspases suggests that cytochromec is not linearly downstream of p53 in this apoptosis pathway. In fact, subcellular fractionation in the presence of sucrose shows that cytochrome c is not cytosolic 1 h after irradiation, but only emerges during extract preparation (data not shown), probably as a result of disrupting mitochondrial integrity by hypotonic lysis. Therefore, extracts prepared from both p53−/− and p53+/+ cells with or without irradiation contained similar levels of released cytochromec (data not shown), which was not capable of inducing caspases, although high levels of exogenous cytochrome c can activate caspases in these extracts. The activation of caspases in this cell-free system is unlikely to require hydrolysis of ATP, whose addition even partially inhibited induction of PARP-cleaving activity (Fig. 5 a, lane 2). The nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ATPγS, had minimal effect on caspase activation (Fig. 5 a, lane 3). However, another nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, completely abrogated the activation of caspases (Fig. 5 a, lane 4). This inhibitory effect was observed when AMP-PNP was added at the beginning but not later in the 32 °C incubation period (Fig. 5 a, lanes 5–7), suggesting that AMP-PNP inhibited an activity upstream of caspases. Interestingly, both ATP and AMP-PNP, but not ATPγS, can be converted to cAMP (35Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1986Google Scholar), which in turn can activate PKA. Three lines of evidence suggested essential roles for cAMP and PKA in the AMP-PNP-mediated inhibition of caspase activation. First, a purified specific peptide inhibitor of PKA (PKI 6–22) strongly relieved the inhibitory effect of AMP-PNP (Fig. 5 b, lanes 1–3). Second, when added to the cell-free extracts at the beginning of the 32 °C incubation period, cAMP inhibited the caspase activation as potently as AMP-PNP (Fig. 5 b, lane 4-6). Finally, purified PKA catalytic subunit completely abolished the induction of caspase activity in the presence of ATP, but not its nonhydrolyzable analog ATPγS (Fig. 5 b, lanes 7–10), and this inhibition was reversed by the specific PKA peptide inhibitor. Thus cAMP/PKA appear to inhibit the p53-dependent apoptosis reflected in these extracts. Finally, the relevance of these in vitro cAMP effects was examined in cell-based apoptosis studies. The cAMP-inducing agent forskolin was examined for its effects on p53-dependent apoptosis in vivo. As shown in Fig. 5 c, forskolin significantly protected radiation-induced apoptosis in transformed fibroblasts. In addition, the apoptotic response to serum starvation was significantly blunted by forskolin (Fig. 5 c). Of note, the activation of PKA by forskolin is short-lived (because of homeostatic down-regulation, see Ref. 36Armstrong R. Wen W. Meinkoth J. Taylor S. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1826-1832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may therefore underestimate the magnitude of the protection because of this experimental system. Nonetheless, these results demonstrate that the cell-free apoptosis assay described here predicts effects that are in agreement with in vivo behavior, and that the cAMP/PKA pathway can negatively regulate p53-dependent apoptosis. This report demonstrates p53-mediated apoptosis in a cell-free system. Significantly, the p53-dependent activation of caspases in this system does not require the presence of Bax or cytochrome c. These findings suggest that a distinct set of factors relay the p53-dependent apoptotic signals to caspases. A recent study has shown that Bax may act upstream of cytochrome c; overexpression of Bax induces the release of cytochrome c, which in turn activates caspase-3 and results in cell death (37Rosse T. Olivier R. Monney L. Rager M. Conus S. Fellay I. Jansen B. Borner C. Nature. 1998; 391: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c may well be an essential component in Bax-dependent apoptosis. According to the death cycle model (38Hengartner M.O. Nature. 1998; 391: 441-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 39Vaux D.L. Cell. 1997; 90: 389-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), it is also possible that within cells cytochrome c could play a role in caspase activation through a Bax-independent pathway in which p53-mediated activation of caspases promotes the release of cytochrome c, which in turn amplifies the apoptotic cascade. This hypothesis is also consistent with the report that there is synergy between transcription-dependent and -independent functions of p53 in apoptosis (40Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). One reproducible feature of the system described here is the relatively long delay (8–12 h) before in vitro induction of caspase activity. There are several important potential reasons for these kinetics. First, caspase activation requires approximately 4 h even within intact cells, thereby representing a relatively slow cascade (or multistep process) in vivo. Second, this assay specifically employs 32 °C incubation periods which, although kinetically suboptimal, diminishes nonspecific degradation of exogenous PARP. Third, components within the extracts are significantly diluted relative to intracellular conditions. Finally, the in vitrolatent period before caspase activation was found to shorten with increasing in vivo incubation after irradiation, eventually passing the p53-dependent stage (data not shown). The same is true for other stimuli of apoptosis such as growth factor deprivation, which in the extreme gives “spontaneous” caspase activation upon extract preparation. Thus for this system the viability of starting cell populations is crucial for the ability to discriminate the slower in vitro p53-dependent activity. The tumor cells used here have been transformed by two oncogenes, Ras plus either E1A or Myc. Therefore, the precise contribution of each oncogene to the apoptotic pathway is uncertain at this time. Stable overexpression of Myc alone in REFs has been shown to produce immortalization without transformation (as measured by solid tumor formation) (41Land H. Parada L.F. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1983; 304: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar), but the apoptotic propensity of these cells has not been reported. In contrast, p53+/+ cells transiently and forcibly overexpressing E1A readily undergo apoptosis, even to a degree that limits generation of stable lines (42Lowe S.W. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Ruley H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2026-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). It would be of interest to examine any such immortalized cells for the apoptotic activity reported here as they could provide clues to the mechanistic connection between oncogene activity and p53-dependent apoptosis. In this tumor cell system, PKA blocks p53-dependent caspase activation in cell-free extracts and protects transformed embryo fibroblasts from apoptosis triggered by γ-irradiation or by serum deprivation. Activation of PKA has been reported to either inhibit or promote apoptosis depending on experimental systems (43McConkey D.J. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Immunol. Rev. 1994; 142: 343-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The ability of PKA to inhibit the caspase activation in vitro suggests that it functions by phosphorylation of a protein(s) present in the extracts, which is consistent with a report that cAMP prevents apoptosis by translation- and transcription-independent mechanisms (44Rukenstein A. Rydel R. Greene L. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p53 itself has been shown to serve as a PKA substrate in vitro (45Adler V. Pincus M.R. Minamoto T. Fuchs S.Y. Bluth M.J. Brandt-Rauf P.W. Friedman F.K. Robinson R.C. Chen J.M. Wang X.W. Harris C. Ronai Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1686-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but it is unclear whether this correlates with its apoptotic activity. Identification of the PKA target(s) may reveal important components of this pathway. Finally, recognition that elevated cAMP may repress p53-dependent apoptosis carries clinical implications for patients with p53 wild-type malignancies undergoing curative antineoplastic therapy, because numerous common agents (for example, caffeine) regulate cAMP metabolism.

Here, we investigated the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in propagation of insulin signaling events leading to DNA synthesis and expression of the immediate early genes c-fosand c-jun in L6 muscle cells. Insulin reorganized the cellular actin network and increased the rate of DNA synthesis and the levels of c-fos mRNA, but not those of c-jun mRNA, in undifferentiated L6 myoblasts. Similarly, insulin markedly elevated the levels of c-fos mRNA but not of c-jun mRNA in differentiated L6 myotubes. Disassembly of the actin filaments by cytochalasin D, latrunculin B, or botulinum C2 toxin significantly inhibited insulin-mediated DNA synthesis in myoblasts and abolished stimulation of c-fos expression by the hormone in myoblasts and myotubes. Actin disassembly abolished insulin-induced phosphorylation and activation of extracellulor signal-regulated kinases, activation of a 65-kda member of the p21-activated kinases, and phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases but did not prevent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p70S6k. Under these conditions, insulin-induced Ras activation was also abolished, and Grb2 association with the Src and collogen homologous (Shc) molecule was inhibited without inhibition of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. We conclude that the actin filament network plays an essential role in insulin regulation of Shc-dependent signaling events governing gene expression by facilitating the interaction of Shc with Grb2.

The signaling pathways initiated by insulin are complex and involve a cascade of adaptor molecules, as well as protein- and lipid-regulated kinases and phosphatases that mediate the nuclear effects of the hormone (1White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Yenush L. White M.F. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, little is currently known regarding the nature of the organization of the signaling cascades regulated by insulin or of the physical interactions of these pathways with intracellular structures, which may facilitate communication between molecules. Although the actin filament network is a particularly attractive candidate to participate in the spatial organization of signal transduction, its role in the regulation of the insulin signaling cascade remains to be elucidated. Binding of insulin to its receptor leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of two classes of adaptor molecules, the insulin receptor substrates (IRS)1 and the Src and collagen homologous proteins (Shc) (1White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Yenush L. White M.F. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated tyrosine residues on these molecules act as docking sites where proteins containing Src homology-2 domains bind and thereby become activated. Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS molecules bind and activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), leading in turn to activation of downstream molecules such as the ribosomal p70 S6 kinase (p70S6k) (1White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Yenush L. White M.F. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc by the insulin receptor initiates a major branch of the insulin signaling cascade; phosphorylated Shc binds Grb2, a small Src homology-2-containing adaptor molecule, leading to GDP/GTP exchange and activation of Ras through the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos (4Skolnik E.Y. Batzer A. Li N. Lee C.H. Lowenstein E. Mohammadi M. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Science. 1993; 260: 1953-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Activated Ras is then able to recruit the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 to the plasma membrane, leading in turn to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase and the MAPKs Erk 1 and Erk 2 (1White M.F.

In addition, recent evidence suggests that Ras is also located upstream of Rac, a small GTPase of the Rho subfamily, which also regulates protein kinases, including the p21-activated kinases (PAKs) and two other members of the MAPK family, Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 MAPK (7Qiu R.G.

Recently, we reported that insulin can activate not only Erks but also PAK65 and p38 MAPK in muscle cells (12Tsakiridis T. Taha C. Grinstein S. Klip A. J. Biol.

Erks, Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38, all of which are members of the MAPK family, have been shown to participate in nuclear events, such as regulation of cell cycle and cell proliferation (13Pages G.

The purpose of the present study was to examine the participation of the actin cytoskeleton in the transmission of the nuclear effects of insulin, including regulation of DNA synthesis and immediate early gene expression. We observed that the actin network is required for the insulin-induced DNA synthesis and c-fos expression in muscle cells. Intact actin microfilaments were found to be necessary for the propagation of Shc/Ras-dependent signaling. The first step requiring the cytoskeleton appears to be the interaction of Grb2 with Shc. We propose that an interaction of Shc with the actin network is important for downstream signal transduction in response to insulin. α-Minimum essential medium, fetal bovine serum, antibiotic/antimycotic solution, and the Trizol reagent for RNA extraction were from Life Technologies, Inc.

Cells were grown in α-minimum essential medium containing 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% (v/v) antibiotic-antimycotic solution (final concentrations: 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The cells were grown in 12-well plates (diameter of well, 2.5 cm) for lysate preparations or in 10-cm-diameter dishes for immunoprecipitation and subcellular fractionation experiments. Cells were serum-depleted for at least 5 h prior to experimental manipulations. To induce actin disassembly, cells were incubated with or without cytochalasin D (1 μm), latrunculin B (1 μm), or botulinum C2 toxin (C2 toxin) (200 ng/ml) for 1 h prior to incubation with insulin (100 nm) for the indicated times. The actin-disrupting agents remained with the cells during the insulin treatment period. At the end of all treatments, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were either lysed for whole cell lysate preparations or protein immunoprecipitation or subjected to a subcellular fractionation procedure as described below. L6 muscle cells grown on glass coverslips were differentiated into myotubes and then serum-deprived and incubated with or without actin-disassembling agents or insulin. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, incubated with 100 mm glycine in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, and washed an additional three times with PBS. Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (5 units/ml), washed three times with PBS, mounted on slides, and examined using a Zeiss confocal microscope. Freshly seeded myoblasts were first incubated for 24 h with normal growth medium (2% fetal bovine serum containing α-minimum essential medium) and then serum-deprived for 24 h. Cells were then treated for 1 h with or without 1 μm cytochalasin D followed by incubation with or without 100 nm insulin for an additional 8 h. At the end of this period, 1 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine was added for an additional 8 h. Following these treatments, cells were washed and lysed, and the radioactivity that was incorporated into DNA and precipitated by trichloroacetic acid was counted by scintillation counting. All treatment conditions began with equal numbers of myoblasts, and the total amount of radioactivity incorporated into DNA in each treatment was used in all calculations. Following the indicated treatments, myotubes or myoblasts were washed with PBS, and total RNA was extracted with the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. An additional cycle of RNA extraction with chloroform/methanol was introduced following the initial Trizol/chloroform extraction in order to improve the purity of extracted RNA. Fifteen μg of total RNA from each condition were separated on denaturing 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and cross-linked with a UV cross-linker (Stratagene UV Stratalinker 2400). c-fos, c-jun, and GAPDH mRNAs were detected by hybridization of membranes with specific32P-labeled cDNA probes (kindly provided by T. Curran and Dr. J. P. Pujol). cDNA probes for c-fos, c-jun, and GAPDH were amplified in E. coli, purified, and labeled with [32P]dCTP. Membranes were first hybridized with the 32P-labeled c-foscDNA probe and subjected to autoradiography. Subsequently, the blots were stripped and reprobed with cDNA probes for c-jun and GAPDH. Following the indicated treatments, cells were lysed with 4× Laemmli sample buffer. Fifty μg of cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Erk specific antibodies as described previously (19Tsakiridis T. Vranic M. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29934-29942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ras activation was estimated by evaluation of GTP-bound Ras levels purified by precipitation from treated and control myotubes. A glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of the Ras binding domain of c-Raf (RBD-Raf) was amplified in E. coli and used for GTP-Ras precipitation according to the method of Taylor and Shalloway (20Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Following treatment, cells were washed and lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of HEPES-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and freshly added phosphatase and protease inhibitors as described earlier (21Tsakiridis T. McDowell H.E. Walker T. Downes C.P. Hundal H.S. Vranic M. Klip A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4315-4322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were subject to centrifugation at 3500 × g, and the supernatant was incubated with either anti-IRS-1, anti-p85 PI 3-kinase, anti-p70S6k, anti-phosphotyrosine, or anti-Shc antibodies overnight, rotating at 4 °C. Agarose-conjugated protein A plus protein G was used for 4 h at 4 °C to precipitate the immunocomplexes. The latter were subject to analysis by either SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting or by PI 3-kinase and p70S6k activity assays as described below. PI 3-kinase activity was estimated as described earlier (21Tsakiridis T. McDowell H.E. Walker T. Downes C.P. Hundal H.S. Vranic M. Klip A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4315-4322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, immunocomplexes of anti-IRS-1 and anti-p85 immunoprecipitates were washed and incubated for 10 min with [γ-32P]ATP, cold ATP, and MgCl2 and phosphatidylinositol as substrate. The products of the reaction were extracted with chloroform/methanol, separated by thin layer chromatography, and quantitated by phosphorimaging. The p70S6k activity was assayed in anti-p70 immunoprecipitates essentially as described earlier (22Roskoski R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 23Krause U. Rider M.H. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16668-16673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, myotubes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1 ml of Buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors. The supernatants of a 15,000 × g (15 min) spin were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a specific polyclonal anti- p70S6k antibody and protein A plus protein G. Immunocomplexes were washed three times with Buffer A and twice with Buffer B (20 mm 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). The assay was performed in a final volume of 50 μl of Buffer B containing 1 μm protein kinase A and protein kinase C inhibitory peptides, 0.2 mm S6 peptide, and 0.25 mm [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 10 min. Aliquots (30 μl) were spotted onto Whatman papers and washed with phosphoric acid. 32P incorporated onto the S6 peptide was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Renaturable kinase activities were examined as described earlier (12Tsakiridis T. Taha C. Grinstein S. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19664-19667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24Kameshita O. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Myelin basic protein or histone VI-S was incorporated into the polyacrylamide gel solution (at 0.5 mg/ml) before polymerization. Fifty μg of protein from cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and following denaturation and renaturation, kinase activities were estimated by incubation of the gels with buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP (25 μCi/gel), cold ATP, MgCl2, and dithiothreitol for 1 h. Following completion of the assay, gels were washed, dried, and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Isolation of cytoskeletal and noncytoskeletal fractions was performed according to the method of Torti et al. (25Torti M. Ramaschi G. Siningaglia F. Lapentina E.G. Balduini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7553-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Serum-deprived myotubes were lysed in a Triton X-100-containing buffer and subjected to differential centrifugation, which allowed isolation of cytosol, Triton X-100-soluble membranes, and Triton X-100-insoluble membrane skeleton and cytoskeleton, the latter two of which are rich in actin (see Fig. 9). The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the actin cytoskeleton in insulin-induced stimulation of DNA synthesis and gene expression. Accordingly, we initiated these studies by investigating the effects of insulin on the organization of the actin network of L6 myoblasts and myotubes (Fig. 1). As we (19Tsakiridis T. Vranic M. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29934-29942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and others (26Goshima K. Masuda A. Qwaribe K. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Kotani K. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Ueda H. Kitamura Y. Sakaue H. Ando A. Chavanieu A. Calas B. Grigorescu F. Nishiyama M. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) have observed previously, treatment of cells with insulin induced a rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, including formation of aggregates of F-actin at the plasma membrane. The actin reorganization and membrane ruffling was evident in both undifferentiated myoblasts and differentiated myotubes (Fig. 1). These events developed as early as 20 s after addition of the hormone and were maintained for at least 1 h in the continued presence of the hormone (not shown). Analysis by serial sectioning with confocal and phase contrast microscopy demonstrated that these aggregates colocalized with membrane ruffles (results not shown). Pretreatment of cells with the actin filament-disrupting agent cytochalasin D induced a dramatic disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton and abrogated insulin-induced membrane ruffling and actin reorganization in both myoblasts and myotubes. Additionally, preincubation of myotubes with either of two structurally dissimilar actin-disrupting agents, latrunculin B and botulinum C2 toxin (C2 toxin), induced a comparable or greater degree of actin disassembly and completely prevented insulin-induced actin reorganization as determined by fluorescence confocal microscopy (Fig. 1). These results confirm the responsiveness of the actin cytoskeleton of both myoblasts and myotubes to insulin and its susceptibility to three structurally dissimilar actin-disrupting agents that can be used to investigate the role of the actin cytoskeleton in insulin signaling. Actin disassembly did not affect cell viability because even prolonged treatment (up to 16 h) of L6 cells with actin-disrupting agents did not alter the ability of cells to exclude trypan blue, nor did it alter their cellular ATP levels (results not shown). Day 3 semiconfluent monolayers of L6 myoblasts were used for these studies because after 5–6 days in culture, L6 cells spontaneously differentiate into myotubes, which are nonproliferating cells. In these studies, serum-deprived cells were treated with or without insulin in the presence or absence of cytochalasin D and incubated with [3H]thymidine to examine the effects of these agents on DNA synthesis. Following a 24-h period of serum deprivation, untreated myoblasts exhibited a small but detectable amount of DNA synthesis, indicating that serum deprivation does not completely abrogate the proliferative capacity of these cells (see Fig. 2). However, addition of insulin increased this rate of synthesis 2.7-fold above basal levels. Pretreatment of the cells with cytochalasin D (Fig. 2) or latrunculin B (results not shown) abolished the ability of the hormone to mediate its mitogenic effects. Furthermore, treatment of myoblasts with cytochalasin D diminished the basal thymidine incorporation, suggesting that intact actin filaments are involved in both constitituve and insulin-induced proliferative events. It is well established that c-fos and c-junexpression are required for DNA synthesis and gene expression (28Musgrove E.A. Sutherland R.L. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 381-389PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bohmer R.-M. Scharf E. Assoian R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the actin cytoskeleton in gene expression, we next examined the effects of actin disassembly on the insulin-induced expression of the two immediate early genes, c-fos and c-jun. Serum-deprived cells were pretreated with cytochalasin D, latrunculin B, or buffer, followed by exposure to insulin or buffer. Total RNA was then extracted and subjected to Northern analysis using c-fos- and c-jun-specific cDNA probes. As has been observed earlier in 32D cells (16Harada S. Smith R.M. Smith J.A. White M.F. Jarett L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30222-30226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), insulin treatment induced a rapid induction of c-fos transcription in myotubes that was maximal between 30 and 60 min (Fig. 3 A). Therefore, in subsequent experiments, the effect of actin disassembly on c-fos expression was examined 60 min after insulin exposure. In four independent experiments, insulin induced a 14.6-fold increase in the level of c-fos mRNA above basal levels. It should be noted that a similar amount of RNA was isolated from cells under the different treatment conditions, and equal amounts of total RNA were loaded in each lane of the agarose gels. This was confirmed by demonstration of equal amounts in each lane of GAPDH mRNA, the transcript of a “housekeeping” gene (Fig. 3 B). A representative autoradiogram illustrating the effects of insulin, cytochalasin D, and latrunculin B on the levels of c-fosmRNA is shown in Fig. 3 B. Fig. 3 C illustrates the quantitation of the effects of insulin and cytochalasin D in four independent experiments. Actin disassembly by cytochalasin D and latrunculin B treatment did not appear to alter significantly the basal levels of c-fos transcription but completely abolished the stimulatory effect of insulin. Unlike c-fos, no further stimulation of c-jun expression in response to insulin was observed in myotubes, nor were any changes observed following actin disassembly (Fig. 3 B). In order to verify whether the stimulatory effects of insulin and their dependence on the actin cytoskeleton were also present in the proliferative stage of L6 cells, similar experiments were also performed in myoblasts. Fig. 3 D illustrates the effects of insulin, cytochalasin D, and latrunculin B treatments on c-fos and c-junexpression in myoblasts. As in myotubes, insulin significantly increased the myoblast c-fos RNA levels, but not the levels of c-jun mRNA, and this effect was abolished by actin filament disassembly. Erk 1 and Erk 2, the major isozymes of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erks), are known to regulate c-fos transcription in response to a variety of mitogenic extracellular stimuli via phosphorylation of Elk-1 (30Gille H. Sharrocks A. Shaw P. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Elk-1 is one of the ternary complex factors that, in conjunction with a dimer of the serum response factor, binds to the SRE element of the c-fos promoter (for a review, see Ref. 31Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). For their full activation, Erks require dual phosphorylation on residues Thr183 and Tyr185, mediated by their upstream regulator MAPK kinase (32Ahn N.G. Seger R. Bratlien R.L. Diltz C.D. Tonks N.K. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4220-4227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ahn N.G. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 992-999Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next investigated the effects of cytoskeletal disruption on both phosphorylation and activation of Erk 1 and Erk 2. To examine the former, we used a polyclonal phosphospecific anti-Erk antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated Thr183 and Tyr185. To assay the latter, in gel kinase assays were employed. Fig. 4 A illustrates that in serum-deprived myotubes, Erk phosphorylation was almost undetectable, and insulin induced a marked increase in their phosphorylation. Pretreatment of cells with cytochalasin D significantly attenuated the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Erk. Furthermore, pretreatment with either latrunculin B or C2 toxin also resulted in inhibition of insulin-induced Erk phosphorylation to an extent comparable to that achieved by cytochalasin D (Fig. 4 A). In order to verify that the levels of Erk phosphorylation reflected the activity of the enzyme, in gel kinase assays were conducted to examine the ability of the enzyme to phosphorylate myelin basic protein in vitro (Fig. 4 B). In accordance with their phosphorylation status, insulin treatment induced a marked increase in Erk activity that was almost completely abolished by pretreatment with cytochalasin D. Based on recent reports (34Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 35Hazzalin C.A. Cano E. Cueda A. Baratt M.S.

Fig. 4 C shows a representative experiment demonstrating the effect of actin disassembly on the insulin-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. As observed earlier (12Tsakiridis T. Taha C. Grinstein S. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19664-19667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), insulin induced a marked tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in myotubes. As with Erk, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was almost completely abolished by cytochalasin-induced actin disassembly. We next investigated the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in insulin-induced activation of PAK65. For these experiments, PAK65 activity was measured employing in gel assays with histone VI-S as the kinase substrate, which we have earlier observed to be a preferred substrate of PAK (12Tsakiridis T.

An antibody against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) effectively inhibited Ox-LDL-induced macrophage growth by >80%. Ox-LDL as well as phospholipase A2-treated acetylated LDL enhanced mRNA levels and protein release of GM-CSF from macrophages, while neither acetylated LDL nor lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) showed such effects. The maximal induction of GM-CSF by Ox-LDL was noted at 4 h, followed by a time-dependent decrease to a basal level within 24 h. Ox-LDL-induced macrophage growth was inhibited by 75% by replacement of the culture medium at 24 h by a fresh medium containing the same concentration of Ox-LDL, when GM-CSF had already returned to the basal level. Thus, a cytokine(s) other than GM-CSF is also expected to participate in Ox-LDL-induced macrophage growth in a later phase. The Ox-LDL-induced GM-CSF release was inhibited by calphostin C, a protein kinase C inhibitor, and was significantly reduced in macrophages from the knockout mice lacking class A, type I and type II macrophage scavenger receptors (MSR-AI/AII). These results taken together indicate that effective endocytosis of lyso-PC of Ox-LDL by macrophages through MSR-AI/AII and subsequent protein kinase C activation have led to GM-CSF release into the medium which may play a priming role in conjunction with other cytokines in Ox-LDL-induced macrophage growth.

Macrophage-derived foam cells, a characteristic feature of the early stages of atherosclerosis, play a crucial role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions (1Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9944) Google Scholar). Macrophages are known to take up chemically modified low density lipoproteins (modified LDLs)1 such as acetylated LDL (acetyl-LDL) and oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL) through the scavenger receptor pathway (2Brown M.S.

It is generally accepted that LDL is oxidatively modified by cells of arterial walls such as smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages, and is converted to a ligand for the macrophage scavenger receptors (MSR) (3Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among chemically modified LDLs, Ox-LDL is thought to be the most likely candidate as an atherogenic lipoprotein in vivo because of its presence in human and rabbit atherosclerotic plaques (4Palinski W.

Since previous morphological reports demonstrated that macrophage-derived foam cells proliferated in situ in atherosclerotic lesions (15Gordon D. Reidy M.A. Benditt E.P. Schwartz S.M. Proc. Natl.

Therefore, it is important to characterize the molecular cascade(s) involved in the induction of macrophage growth by Ox-LDL. Our previous studies demonstrated that the specific uptake of lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) of Ox-LDL by class A, type I and type II MSR (MSR-AI/AII) was essential for Ox-LDL-induced macrophage growth (12Sakai M.

However, the molecular cascade(s) leading to Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation is still not fully understood. There are two possible mechanisms for macrophage proliferation induced by Ox-LDL. One is that Ox-LDL-induced mitogenic stimulus directly leads to macrophage proliferation. The other is that Ox-LDL stimulates the induction of certain growth factor(s) which leads to macrophage growth. Three types of cytokines are known to exhibit growth stimulating activity for macrophages. These include the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (21Stanley E.R. Cifone M. Heard P.M.

The results indicated that Ox-LDL-induced GM-CSF release from macrophages may play a priming role in macrophage growth. All reagents for cell culture were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. [methyl-3H]Thymidine (80 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]dCTP (370 MBq/ml), and Hybond-N+nylon membrane were purchased from Amersham. Recombinant murine IL-3 and recombinant murine IL-5 were purchased from Research and Diagnostics Systems. Recombinant murine M-CSF was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Recombinant murine GM-CSF was purchased from Genzyme. Goat polyclonal neutralizing antibodies against cytokines such as murine IL-3, murine IL-5, murine M-CSF, and murine GM-CSF were purchased from Research and Diagnostics Systems. ELISA kit for determination of GM-CSF level was purchased from Amersham. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) from Crotalus atrox venom, calphostin C, and palmitoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine were purchased from Sigma. Calphostin C was stored at −20 °C as stock solutions of 500 μm in dimethyl sulfoxide and used within 1 week of dissolving. The final concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide were less than 0.1% in the culture medium, which did not affect cell viability and macrophage growth. Calphostin C at <500 nm did not show any cytotoxic effect when assessed by lactate dehydrogease release. Other chemicals were the best grade available from commercial sources. Human LDL (d = 1.019 to 1.063 g/ml) was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation from the plasma of normolipidemic subjects after overnight fasting (26Murakami M. Horiuchi S. Takata K. Morino Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). LDL was dialyzed against 0.15 mNaCl and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). Acetyl-LDL was prepared by chemical modification of LDL with acetic anhydride (26Murakami M. Horiuchi S. Takata K. Morino Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Acetyl-LDL was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and treated with PLA2 as described by Quinn et al. (6Quinn M.T.

Seventy-five percent of phosphatidylcholine in PLA2-treated acetyl-LDL was converted to lyso-PC. Ox-LDL was prepared by incubation of 0.1 mg/ml LDL with 5 μmCuSO4 in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 h at 37 °C followed by the addition of 1 mm EDTA, cooling on ice, and dialysis against 0.15 m NaCl and 1 mmEDTA (pH 7.4) (12Sakai M.

The levels of endotoxin associated with these lipoproteins were <1 pg/μg of protein; these were measured by a commercially available kit (Toxicolor system, Seikagaku Corp.). Moreover, macrophage growth was not induced by endotoxin at a concentration <1 ng/ml in our experimental system. Unless otherwise specified, cell culture experiments were performed at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Peritoneal macrophages were collected from four different mice; those from non-stimulated male DDY mice (25–30 g), those from double-knockout mice lacking both the Fc receptor γ chain, and the class II Fc receptor for immunoglobulin G (FcRγ/FcγRII) (Taconic Farms, Inc.) (28Takai T. Ono M. Hikida M. Ohmori H. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 379: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 29Takai T. Li M. Sylvestre D. Clynes R. Ravetch J.V.

These peritoneal macrophages were collected with 8 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui Seiyaku Co., Tokyo) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml) (medium A). Cell suspensions were dispersed in each well of appropriate tissue culture plates and incubated for 90 min. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing three times with medium A. After washing, cell number was decreased to ∼80%. More than 98% of adherent cells were judged to be macrophages by Giemsa staining. The macrophage monolayers thus formed were used for following cellular experiments. SR-4987 cells, a murine bone marrow-derived stromal cell line, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (31Pessina A. Mineo E. Neri M.G. Gribaldo L. Colombi R. Brambilla P. Zaleskis G. Cytotechnology. 1992; 8: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and cultured in McCoy's 5a medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. WEHI-3 cells, a murine myelomonocytic leukemia cell line, were obtained from ATCC (32Ralph P. Nakoinz I. J. Immunol. 1977; 119: 950-954PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui Seiyaku Co., Tokyo) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. The macrophage monolayers (5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture plates (15.5 mm in diameter, Corning)) formed were cultured with 1 ml of medium A in the presence of the lipoproteins to be tested without medium exchange unless otherwise specified. [3H]Thymidine incorporation assay was performed as described previously (12Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Hakamata H. Sasaki T. Yui S. Yamazaki M. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31430-31435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications. Eighteen hours before the termination of the experiments, 20 μl of 50 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added to each well and incubated for 18 h. After discarding the medium, each well was washed three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and the cells were lysed with 0.5 ml of 0.5 m NaOH by incubation on ice for 10 min. The cell lysates were neutralized with 0.25 ml of 1m HCl, further precipitated with 0.25 ml of 40% trichloroacetic acid by incubation on ice for 20 min. The resulting trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was collected on filters (Millipore PVDF filter; 0.45 μm in pore size) and washed three times with 1 ml of 99.5% ethanol. The filters were dried under air and their radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation spectrophotometer (11Yui S. Sasaki T. Miyazaki A. Horiuchi S. Yamazaki M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The macrophage monolayers (5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture plates) as described above were cultured with 1 ml of medium A in the presence of the lipoproteins to be tested. After incubation for 7 days (without medium exchange unless otherwise specified), the adherent cells within five standard-sized areas (0.5 × 0.5 mm) in triplicate wells were counted as described previously (33Sasaki T. Horiuchi S. Yamazaki M. Yui S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1996; 19: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Then, the cells were lysed in 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and the naphthol blue-black-stained nuclei were counted in a hemocytometer as described previously (11Yui S. Sasaki T. Miyazaki A. Horiuchi S. Yamazaki M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The macrophage monolayers (5 × 106 cells/plate, 10 cm in diameter, Falcon) formed were cultured in 15 ml of medium A with or without the lipoproteins to be tested. During incubation for 120 h, 300 μl of the medium were collected at various time intervals (the actual incubation times were: 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 120 h) and immediately centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min to remove any particulate material. The supernatant was stored at −80 °C immediately. After all culture experiments were completed, the frozen culture supernatants were quickly thawed to determine GM-CSF levels in the medium. The concentration of GM-CSF protein was determined according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer of GM-CSF-specific ELISA system (sensitivity, 5 pg/ml, Amersham) using recombinant murine GM-CSF as a standard. Standard molecular biology techniques were used (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After incubation of murine peritoneal macrophage monolayers (2 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plate, 3.5 cm in diameter, Nunc) with Ox-LDL (0 to 40 μg/ml) for different time intervals (0 to 7 h), total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc). Total RNAs of SR-4987 cells (31Pessina A. Mineo E. Neri M.G. Gribaldo L. Colombi R. Brambilla P. Zaleskis G.

Immunol. 1982; 128: 2393-2398PubMed Google Scholar) were also extracted with TRIzol. The first strand cDNA synthesis containing 1 μg of total RNA was primed with oligo(dT). Primers used for PCR amplification of GM-CSF, M-CSF, IL-3, IL-5, and β-actin were designed on the basis of murine GM-CSF cDNA (36Miyatake S. Otsuka T. Yokota T. Lee F. Arai K.

Evol. 1986; 23: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar); the sizes of RT-PCR products of GM-CSF, M-CSF, IL-3, IL-5, and β-actin were expected to be 368, 578, 423, 235, and 540 base pairs, respectively. The cycling conditions in the GeneAmp 9600 System consisted of a first step of 94 °C denaturation for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of annealing at 54 °C for 60 s, extension at 75 °C for 90 s, and denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, with a final elongation step at 75 °C for 10 min. Amplification products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. To verify that the amplification products was consistent with the reported sequences of murine GM-CSF, M-CSF, IL-3, IL-5, and β-actin, they were ligated into pGEM-T (from Promega), transfected into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue and sequenced by using 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). For Northern blot analysis, GM-CSF cDNA inserted into pGEM-T was excised by restriction enzyme ApaI and SacI, and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random nanomer primer method using Megaprime™ DNA labeling system (Amersham) (41Matsuda H.

After incubation of murine peritoneal macrophage monolayers (2 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plate, 3.5 cm in diameter, Nunc) with 40 μg/ml Ox-LDL for 1 h, total RNA was prepared from 5 dishes with TRIzol. Ten μg/lane of total RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis through a denaturing formaldehyde 1% agarose gel, transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membrane as described (41Matsuda H. Hakamata H. Miyazaki A. Sakai M. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.-Y. Koboli S. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) by capillary transfer with 10 × SSC for 20 h, and then cross-linked by UV (FS 1500, Funakoshi). Hybridization of the membrane with 32P-labeled probe specific for GM-CSF was performed in a solution containing Hybridization buffer tablets (Amersham) with 50% formamide, 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C as described previously (41Matsuda H. Hakamata H. Miyazaki A. Sakai M. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.-Y. Koboli S. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Stringent washing of the membrane was performed with 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at a higher temperature (from 42 to 65 °C) (41Matsuda H. Hakamata H. Miyazaki A. Sakai M. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.-Y. Koboli S. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The membrane was then exposed to a Fuji Imaging Plate BAS-III (Fuji Photo Film Co.) for 2 h at room temperature and analyzed using a BAS-2000 II (Fuji X). PKC activity of macrophages was assayed by MESACUP Protein Kinase Assay Kit (Medical and Biological Laboratories) as described previously (19Matsumura T. Sakai M. Kobori S. Biwa T. Takemura T. Matsuda H. Hakamata H. Horiuchi S. Shichiri M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The macrophage monolayers (5 × 106 cells/plate, 10 cm in diameter, Falcon) formed were cultured for the indicated times in 15 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 with or without the lipoproteins to be tested. Cells were detached from the wells and homogenized by sonication for 30 s at 4 °C with Sonifier (Branson Sonic Power Co). The membrane fractions were collected by ultracentrifugation and were used in the PKC assay as described previously (19Matsumura T. Sakai M. Kobori S. Biwa T. Takemura T. Matsuda H. Hakamata H. Horiuchi S. Shichiri M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Differences between groups were evaluated by the Student'st test. When the p value was less than 0.05, the difference was considered significant. To determine whether the mitogenic activity of Ox-LDL is due to its direct effect on macrophage growth, or due to its indirect effect through induction of certain growth factors, we first tested the effect of medium exchange on Ox-LDL-induced cell growth of murine peritoneal macrophages. Incubation with 20 μg/ml Ox-LDL for 5 days without medium exchange induced a significant [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1 B). However, when macrophages were incubated with 20 μg/ml Ox-LDL for 5 days replacing the medium at day 1 or 2 by medium A containing the same concentration of Ox-LDL, [3H]thymidine incorporation was markedly reduced by 75 or 60%, respectively (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, replacement of the medium at day 3 or 4 by medium A containing the same concentration of Ox-LDL, did not change [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1 B). Cell-counting assay also showed that medium exchange at day 1 or 2 significantly inhibited Ox-LDL-induced macrophage growth (Table I). These results suggest that a soluble factor(s) released from these cells into the medium during day 1 to 2 may be involved in the induction of macrophage growth by Ox-LDL.Table IEffect of medium exchange on Ox-LDL-induced macrophage growth determined by cell counting assaySampleCell number× 10−4/wellMedium alone3.52 ± 0.51 (100%)Ox-LDL No medium exchange5.63 ± 0.32 (160%) Medium exchangeDay 14.77 ± 0.26 (135%)1-ap < 0.01, compared with no medium exchange (Student's t test).Day 24.89 ± 0.21 (139%)1-ap < 0.01, compared with no medium exchange (Student's t test).Day 35.84 ± 0.62 (165%)Day 45.59 ± 0.29 (158%)Peritoneal macrophage monolayers from DDY mice (5 × 104cells/well in 24-well tissue culture plates) were incubated in 1 ml of medium A with or without 20 μg/ml Ox-LDL.

Core protein domains that are variable between syndecan family members may regulate syndecan-specific associations, thereby endowing individual syndecans with unique functions. A syndecan-4-specific domain has been identified in the extracellular syndecan-4 protein. This region mediates cell adhesion when provided as an artificial substratum and is localized within amino acids 56–109 of the recombinant extracellular protein domain of mouse syndecan-4 (mS4ED) (McFall, A. J., and Rapraeger, A. C. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 12901–12904). To characterize its interaction with the cell surface, radiolabeled ligand binding studies were performed. A single high affinity interaction, with a dissociation constant of 2 × 10−9m, was observed between mS4ED and both human and mouse cells. Both chicken S4ED and mS4ED compete for this interaction, although they are only 34% identical within the cell-binding domain sequence. The extracellular protein domains of syndecan-1, -2, and -3, however, fail to compete. The interaction is also observed with native syndecan-4 shed from cell surfaces.

The syndecan family of cell surface proteoglycans contains four vertebrate members, syndecans 1–4, that regulate cell adhesion, growth factor signaling, and maintenance of cell morphology (1Bernfield M.

They do so via interactions with the glycosaminoglycan chains which decorate the syndecan core proteins and the core proteins themselves. Most cells express multiple syndecan family members, suggesting that the individual syndecan proteins, which are distinct gene products, are likely to have unique functions (4Kim C.W. Goldberger O.A. Gallo R.L. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The syndecan proteins can be divided into three domains. These are (i) a short cytoplasmic domain about 30 amino acids long, (ii) a single transmembrane domain, and (iii) an extracellular domain that is modified by the addition of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains. Within these domains are both conserved and variable regions. Conserved regions have the potential to mediate functions shared by all syndecan family members. For example, the cytoplasmic domains of all known syndecans contain the C-terminal sequence EFYA which has recently been shown to interact with syntenin, a novel PDZ domain-containing protein (5Grootjans J.J.

The transmembrane domains of the syndecans are also homologous and are likely to contribute to the shared ability of all syndecan core proteins to homodimerize and potentially multimerize (1Bernfield M.

In contrast to conserved regions within the syndecan core proteins, variable regions are candidates for unique, or syndecan-specific, interactions. One variable region of the syndecans is found within the cytoplasmic domain. This region mediates a direct association between syndecan-4 and the catalytic domain of protein kinase C (PKC)1 α (8Oh E.-S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 9Oh E.-S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This interaction appears to be specific for this syndecan family member and stimulates PKC activity, suggesting a syndecan-4-specific signaling function within cells. A second variable region of the syndecan core proteins is the extracellular domain. Previous work has shown that the recombinant syndecan-4 extracellular protein domain (S4ED) can function to mediate cell adhesion when supplied to cells as an artificial substratum (10McFall A.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12901-12904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The adhesive interaction is specific for syndecan-4 since (i) the extracellular protein domain of syndecan-1 fails to compete for cell adhesion and (ii) the extracellular protein domains of both mouse and chicken syndecan-4 compete equally well for cell adhesion. This interaction is mediated by a discrete domain within mS4ED, namely the cell-binding domain. To further explore the association between the extracellular protein domain of syndecan-4 and the cell surface, radiolabeled ligand binding studies were performed. These studies demonstrate that recombinant and native syndecan-4 shed from the cell surface specifically interact with a single class of cell surface-binding sites. Cell adhesion assays suggest that at least one other syndecan family member, syndecan-1, has a similar but discrete cell-surface association. Neonatal human foreskin fibroblasts, kindly provided by Dr. Donna Peters (University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI), were cultivated in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone) and used prior to 60 days in culture. Mouse aortic endothelial cells, kindly provided by Dr. Robert Auerbach (University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI) and Swiss 3T3, 143 osteosarcoma, and NIH 3T3 cell lines were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone). Low passage NMuMG epithelial cells were incubated in the same medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin. The ARH-77 lymphocyte cell lines, kindly provided by Dr. Ralph Sanderson (University of Arkansas, Little Rock, AR), were incubated in RPMI (Life Technologies, Inc.) and supplemented with 10% calf serum. Mouse syndecan-2 cDNA was obtained from Dr. Guido David (University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium) (11David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. Development. 1993; 119: 841-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse syndecan-3 cDNA was obtained from Vishva Dixit (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) and while unpublished, is similar to the published rat syndecan-3 sequence (12Carey D.J. Conner K. Asundi V.K. O'Mahony D.J. Stahl R.C. Showalter L.J. Cizmeci-Smith G. Hartman J. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2873-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Nucleotides 578 through 952 of the mouse syndecan-2 sequence and 194 through 1207 of the mouse syndecan-3 sequence (which corresponds to 247 through 1260 of the rat sequence) were cloned and expressed as described previously (10McFall A.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12901-12904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Production of mS4EDΔ56–108 required ligation of two amplification products containing (i) nucleotides 1 through 165 of mS4ED and (5′)BamHI and (3′) XbaI restriction enzyme sites and (ii) nucleotides 325 of mS4ED through 1020 of the pGEX-2T vector and a (5′) NheI restriction enzyme site. Two cell adhesion assays were used. In the first assay, cells were trypsinized (except for the ARH-77 cell lines which are cultured in suspension) and plated in U-shaped microtiter wells (Costar) coated with protein ligands as described previously (10McFall A.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12901-12904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After an adhesion period of 1 or 2 h at 37 °C, unbound cells were washed from the wells and the remaining cells fixed and quantified by colorimetric detection with 1% bromphenol blue. Unless otherwise noted, cells were incubated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide for 2 h prior to and during this type of adhesion assay. The second cell adhesion assay is identical to the first, with the following exceptions. Cells were not exposed to cycloheximide and after an adhesion period of 1 h, the wells were centrifuged at 150 × g for 1.5 min. Both bound and unbound cells, which pellet, remain in the wells and were fixed by the addition of 0.8% glutaraldehyde. The cells in the wells were stained with 1% bromphenol blue and photographed. Thrombin-released recombinant mS4ED peptide was labeled with 125I to a specific activity of 200–250 cpm/fmol using a modified chloramine T procedure. Reactions typically contained 100 μg of mS4ED, 1 mCi of Na[125I] (NEN Life Science Products), and 40 μg of chloramine T. Unconjugated iodine was removed by G-10 Sephadex chromatography. Cell monolayers were prepared by plating cells on fibronectin-coated tissue culture plastic. Fibronectin facilitates monolayer formation but it is not required for specific binding of mS4ED to cells (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). Adherent cells were washed with buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 138 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.25 mmEDTA, pH 7.4, prior to trypsinization with 0.1% trypsin dissolved in the same. Cells were subsequently washed with HEPES/DMEM (HEPES-buffered DMEM, pH 7.4) containing 0.05% trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Cells cultured in suspension, such as the ARH-77 cell lines, were washed once with buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 138 mm NaCl, 5.6 mmglucose, 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. All cells were then suspended in HEPES/DMEM and added to 24-well tissue culture plates pre-coated for 90 min at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml fibronectin. The ARH-77 and NMuMG cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells per cm2; all other cells were plated at 2.5 × 105 cells per cm2. After incubating for 30 min at 37 °C, non-adherent cells were aspirated from the wells and the resulting monolayers were blocked with 1% dialyzed heat-denatured BSA for an additional 30 min. The adherent monolayers of cells were subsequently used to perform radiolabeled ligand binding studies. Binding buffer consisted of HEPES/DMEM or 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 138 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.4, if testing the contribution of divalent cations. After equilibration on an ice-water bath, iodinated mS4ED, competitor molecules, and 0.5% dialyzed heat-denatured BSA were added to cells and binding reactions allowed to proceed for 200 min at 4 °C (unless otherwise specified). Cell monolayers were then washed five times with ice-cold HEPES/DMEM containing 0.2% dialyzed heat-denatured BSA. The contents of the wells were solubilized with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 25 mm Tris containing 0.5m NaOH to determine the amount of cell-associated radioactivity. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand and subtracted from total binding to determine specific binding. To determine the amount of cell-surface bound mS4ED, cells were washed with low pH buffer containing 15 mm glycine and 150 mm NaCl, pH 2.0, or buffer containing 25 mmHEPES, 5 mm KCl, 138 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.4, supplemented with 10 mmEDTA and 10 mm EGTA for 3.5 min at 4 °C. Alternatively, cells were treated with 5 mg/ml Pronase™ (Sigma) for 15 min at 4 °C. The fusion protein glutathione S-transferase-mS4ED (GST-mS4ED) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was used as an antigen for injection into New Zealand White rabbits (University of Wisconsin Animal Resources). The crude serum recognizes both mouse and rat syndecan-4 via immunoblotting (data not shown). Affinity-purified antibodies were generated by applying serum sequentially to GST and GST-mS4ED columns. Bound antibodies were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5 (13Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Conditioned medium was collected from ARH-77 cells stably expressing rat syndecan-4 (14Stanley M.J. Liebersbach B.F. Liu W. Anhalt D.J. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5077-5083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Urea was added to 6 m, sodium acetate to 50 mm, and EDTA to 5 mm prior to adjusting the pH to 4.5. After application to a DEAE Sephacel column, bound syndecan-4 was eluted with a 100-ml NaCl gradient ranging from 200 to 800 mm. Fractions containing syndecan-4 were dialyzed against HEPES/DMEM and concentrated with a Centricon 30 filter (Amicon). The resulting preparations were left untreated or digested with 1.2 milliunits/ml heparinase I and III and 50 milliunits/ml chondroitin ABC lyase (ICN). For immunoprecipitations, affinity-purified anti-syndecan-4 antibody and control rabbit immunoglobulin were covalently coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B. Precipitated material was released with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and immediately neutralized with 1m HEPES, pH 8.0. A fraction of each of the released glycosaminoglycan-denuded solutions was biotinylated by incubation on ice for 2 h in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce). Eluants were dialyzed against HEPES/DMEM prior to use. Samples were resolved by Laemmli SDS (13% total acrylamide) or Laemmli gradient SDS (4–15% total acrylamide overlaying a 17% total acrylamide step)-PAGE (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Gels were transferred to Immobilon-N (Millipore) and probed with anti-syndecan-4 serum or streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase. Signals generated with chemifluorescence were detected with a STORM 860 and quantified with ImageQuaNT™ (Molecular Dynamics). Previous data have shown that recombinant mS4ED functions as an artificial substratum to mediate adhesion of human dermal fibroblasts (10McFall A.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12901-12904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To test whether this interaction is unique to syndecan-4, or is shared by other syndecan family members, each of the syndecan extracellular protein domains were expressed as GST fusion proteins and assessed for their ability to support adhesion of fibroblast cells. The cDNAs for each of the mouse syndecan extracellular protein domains (mS1ED-mS4ED) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. They begin with the first amino acid downstream of the predicted signal peptidase cleavage site and extend through the third amino acid from the transmembrane domain (Fig. 1 A) (11David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. Development. 1993; 119: 841-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Carey D.J. Conner K. Asundi V.K. O'Mahony D.J. Stahl R.C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4870-4877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These domains were cloned into the bacterial expression vector, pGEX-2T™, which encode the domains fused to an N-terminal GST sequence. The vector also encodes a thrombin cleavage site following the GST sequence, thus providing the means to generate syndecan extracellular domain peptides free of all but two exogenous amino acids. The fusion proteins lack glycosaminoglycan modifications, ensuring that any syndecan-specific interactions are mediated solely by the syndecan proteins. Glutathione-Sepharose affinity purification and PAGE of the fusion proteins and the thrombin-released syndecan extracellular domains reveal the presence of a single major protein in each preparation migrating at the expected M r (Ref. 4Kim C.W. Goldberger O.A. Gallo R.L. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholarand data not shown). To test for interactions between the syndecan extracellular protein domains and the cell surface, a centrifugation-based cell binding assay was developed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Three different fibroblast cell types, namely, the Swiss 3T3 cell line, the NIH 3T3 cell line, and dermal fibroblasts, were incubated in wells coated with GST-syndecan extracellular domain fusion proteins. Two syndecan family members, syndecan-2 and -3, fail to support cell adhesion (Fig. 1 B). Syndecan-4, as expected, supports binding of all three fibroblast cell types (Fig. 1 B) (10McFall A.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12901-12904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Interestingly, syndecan-1 supports the adhesion of only one of the three fibroblast cell cultures, namely, the Swiss 3T3 cell line. This result suggests that syndecan-1, like syndecan-4, interacts with molecules at the cell surface. However, the interactions mediated by syndecan-1 and -4 appear to be distinct since (i) the extracellular protein domains of the two syndecans do not mediate binding of the same cells and (ii) each domain fails to compete for adhesion to the other (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). To further characterize the interaction between syndecan-4 and the cell surface, a radiolabeled mS4ED binding assay was developed. To test whether there exists a finite population of cell surface-binding sites for mS4ED, saturation binding experiments were performed with cells capable of adhering to an mS4ED substratum. Two cell types were chosen for the analyses to assess whether different cells adhere to mS4ED via a single class of binding sites or multiple classes of binding sites. Human dermal fibroblasts and mouse aortic endothelial cells, both of which adhere to an mS4ED substratum (Fig. 1 B and data not shown), were assayed for their ability to bind iodinated mS4ED peptide as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell-associated binding was determined as a function of adding increasing amounts of mS4ED to cells. Incubation with ligand was allowed to proceed for 200 min, since a kinetic analysis indicates that steady state is reached 3 h after the addition of 3 × 10−9m mS4ED (Fig. 2 A). Specific binding, calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” reached a plateau at approximately 25 ng added mS4ED, indicating a finite number of mS4ED cell surface-binding sites present on cells which adhere to an mS4ED substratum (Figs. 2 and 3).Figure 3Iodinated mS4ED interacts with a single class of binding sites. Specific binding of iodinated mS4ED to cells was quantified as a function of ligand concentration. A, data collected using dermal fibroblasts were curve-fit to a single site binding model with the computer program GraphPad Prism® to determine the affinity (K d) and number of binding sites (B max). B, these same data were subjected to Scatchard analysis. C and D, data using aortic endothelial cells were analyzed as in A and B, respectively. Data from duplicate samples are shown (mean ± S.E.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The saturation binding data obtained with these two cell types have been analyzed by both nonlinear and linear regression. Both nonlinear curve-fitting (GraphPad Prism® software) to a single site occupancy model and Scatchard analysis indicate a single high affinity interaction between mS4ED and the cell surface (Fig. 3) (18Limbird L.E. Cell Surface Receptors: A Short Course on Theory and Methods. Martinus Nijhoff Publishing, Boston1986Crossref Google Scholar). TheK d of the interaction is approximately 2 × 10−9m and is the same for both cell types, suggesting that different cell types express the same class of mS4ED-binding sites. Both cell types also have comparable values forB max, with the estimated number of binding sites at approximately 10,000 per cell. These sites were demonstrated to be at the cell surface by releasing 90% of the cell-associated mS4ED with a low pH wash or by treatment with Pronase™ (Fig. 4). To test whether the interaction between mS4ED and the cell surface requires divalent cations, cells with bound, iodinated mS4ED were briefly incubated with EDTA. EDTA, which chelates divalent cations, removed 68% of the cell-associated mS4ED (Fig. 4). To determine if specific divalent cations are capable of facilitating the interaction between mS4ED and the cell surface, calcium, magnesium, or manganese were added during iodinated mS4ED binding assays. Calcium and manganese supported near-maximal binding of iodinated mS4ED by 330 μm added cation, whereas magnesium failed to support maximal binding even at the highest concentration tested, namely 9 mm (Fig. 5 A). Since calcium, magnesium, and manganese are present in the blood at approximately 1.3 mm, 1.5 mm, and 0.5 μm, respectively, calcium is the only divalent cation of the three likely to facilitate the syndecan-4 extracellular domain interaction in vivo (19Maurer P. Hohenester E. Engel J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Darnell J. Lodish H. Baltimore D. Molecular Cell Biology, Transport across Cell Membranes.in: Darnell J. Lodish H. Baltimore D. Scientific American Books, Inc., New York1990Google Scholar, 21Saito K. Dynamics of Trace Elements in Human Body and Diseases.in: Saito K. 31. Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan1994Google Scholar). The ability of calcium to support cell adhesion to an mS4ED substratum was also tested and near-maximal adhesion was observed with 1 mm added cation. This confirms that adhesion, like binding of soluble ligand, occurs with physiological concentrations of calcium (Fig. 5 B). The specificity of the interaction between iodinated mS4ED and the cell surface was tested by assessing the ability of the different syndecan extracellular protein domains to compete for binding. Previous data has demonstrated that mS1ED failed to compete for adhesion of human dermal fibroblasts to an mS4ED substratum (10McFall A.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12901-12904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of syndecan-2 and -3 also fail to effectively compete for adhesion to an mS4ED substratum at a concentration which exceeds the IC50 of mS4ED by 100-fold (Fig. 1 A). All three syndecans likewise fail to compete for binding of iodinated mS4ED to cells at concentrations which exceed the K d by 100-fold (Fig. 6 A). As previously observed in the cell adhesion assay, both mS4ED and cS4ED compete equally well for binding of iodinated mS4ED to the cell surface, with IC50values of 7.8 and 8.1 × 10−9m, respectively (Fig. 6 B) (10McFall A.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12901-12904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, both assays reflect syndecan-4-specific interactions with the cell surface. Previous data had demonstrated that the cell adhesion activity of mS4ED is contained within amino acids 56–109 of the full-length extracellular protein domain (10McFall A.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12901-12904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Further truncations of this domain, from either the N or C terminus, abrogates the ability of this domain to compete for cell adhesion to mS4ED (Fig. 1 A). In addition, a deletion mutant of mS4ED, lacking amino acids 56–108 (mS4EDΔ56–108), fails to compete for adhesion at concentrations which exceed the IC50 by 100-fold. These data confirm that a minimal cell-binding domain has been identified and that deletion of this domain from intact mS4ED renders it nonfunctional. The cell-binding domain peptide, mS4ED56–109, also competes for binding of iodinated mS4ED to cells, with an IC50 of 3.9 × 10−9m (Fig. 6 C). As anticipated, the cell-binding domain deletion mutant, mS4EDΔ56–108, fails to compete for binding of iodinated mS4ED at concentrations which exceed the K d by 100-fold (Fig. 6 D). Thus, both the adhesion and radiolabeled ligand binding assays measure interactions mediated by the cell-binding domain of syndecan-4. Not all cells adhere to a mS4ED substratum (Fig. 7 A). While all adhesion competent cells might be expected to bind iodinated mS4ED, an inability to adhere to an mS4ED substratum could result from a variety of possibilities. Adhesion deficient cells may express less binding sites than adhesion competent cells or alternatively, express abundant sites but be unable to transmit occupancy of these sites into a productive adhesion event. Cells positive for mS4ED adhesion, for example, dermal fibroblasts, aortic endothelial cells, and the Swiss 3T3 cell line, were also found to be positive for specific binding of iodinated mS4ED (Fig. 7). Cells negative for adhesion, for example, the ARH-77 lymphocyte cell line, the ARH-77 cell line stably expressing syndecan-4, and the 143 osteosarcoma cell line, did not detectably bind iodinated mS4ED. This observation is especially noteworthy in regards to the ARH-77 cell line expressing syndecan-4. Since most cultured cells express syndecan-4 and all syndecans homodimerize, it is formally possible that syndecan-4 mediates binding of mS4ED (1Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 4Kim C.W. Goldberger O.A. Gallo R.L. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 7Asundi V.K. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26404-26410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 8Oh E.-S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These data, however, suggest that other cell surface molecules are responsible for mediating binding. The correlation between binding of iodinated mS4ED and adhesion to mS4ED also extends to cells which adhere weakly, for example, NMuMG epithelial cells. These cells bind low levels of iodinated mS4ED (Fig. 7). To test whether native syndecan-4 shed from the cell surface contains an active cell-binding domain, glycosaminoglycan-denuded shed syndecan-4 was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and subjected to immunoprecipitation with either control rabbit or affinity-purified anti-mS4ED antibodies. Immunoblotting and biotinylation were used to confirm that only one protein, namely syndecan-4, was specifically precipitated (Fig. 8, A and B). To quantify the amount of syndecan-4 present in the specific eluant, immunoblotting was performed with recombinant mS4ED protein as a standard (Fig. 8 B). Eluants were tested for their ability to compete for binding of 1 × 10−9m iodinated mS4ED to cells. The syndecan-4 eluant competes for binding of iodinated mS4ED with an IC50 of 1 × 10−9m shed syndecan-4 (Fig. 8 C). Although the IC50 value of native syndecan-4 appears to be lower than that of recombinant mS4ED, which is 8 × 10−9m, this apparent difference in activity can be attributed to the use of less iodinated mS4ED in the binding assay. An equal volume of control eluant was tested for each volume of syndecan-4 eluant and failed to affect the binding of iodinated mS4ED to cells (data not shown). The syndecan-4 eluant was further subjected to protein A precipitation to confirm that the activity of the eluant was not attributable to contaminating antibody. This treatment had no effect on the activity of the syndecan-4 eluant, further confirming that shed syndecan-4 protein is the active component of the eluant (data not shown). It was previously demonstrated that soluble heparan and chondroitin sulfate fail to compete for cell adhesion to an mS4ED substratum, indicating that it is unlikely that the glycosaminoglycan chains of syndecan-4 compete for the interaction between the cell-binding domain and the cell surface (10McFall A.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12901-12904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To confirm this finding, glycosaminoglycan-bearing syndecan-4 was also immunopurified and tested in the iodinated mS4ED binding assay. The resulting eluant competed for binding of iodinated mS4ED to cells with an IC50 of 6 × 10−10m shed glycosaminoglycan-bearing syndecan-4 (Fig. 8 C). This value is comparable to the IC50 obtained with glycosaminoglycan-denuded syndecan-4, strongly suggesting that shed syndecan-4 contains a fully active cell-binding domain. Furthermore, the activity of the cell-binding domain does not appear to be directly regulated by the glycosaminoglycan content of syndecan-4. In this study, the extracellular protein domain of syndecan-4 has been shown to interact with a single class of binding sites present at the cell surface. This interaction is of high affinity and functionally conserved between species. The association is also specific for syndecan-4; none of the other vertebrate syndecan family members contain this domain. Furthermore, native syndecan-4 shed from the cell surface contains a fully active cell-binding domain, suggesting an unanticipated role for shed syndecan-4 in vivo. Analyses of saturation binding data collected with two cell types, namely fibroblast and endothelial cells, indicate that the mS4ED ligand interacts with a single class of high affinity cell surface-binding sites. This association is identical by several criteria to the interaction which mediates adhesion to an artificial substratum of immobilized mS4ED. First, the ability to bind iodinated ligand and adhere to an mS4ED substratum is strictly correlated for all cells tested. Cells which fail to adhere to an mS4ED substratum also fail to express detectable binding sites for iodinated mS4ED. Apparently, the molecules which bind mS4ED are expressed or regulated in a cell-specific manner. Second, the interaction in both assays depends on the presence of divalent cations and can be facilitated by physiological concentrations of calcium. Several cell surface molecules depend on the presence of divalent cations to adopt an appropriate three-dimensional structure, including the well characterized integrin and cadherin families of adhesion receptors (19Maurer P. Hohenester E. Engel J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Amagai M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 146-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23Cheresh D.A. Advances in Molecular and Cell Biology. 6. JAI Press, Inc., Greenwich, CT1993: 225-252Google Scholar). Potentially either the cell surface molecules which interact with mS4ED, or the mS4ED ligand itself, may be conformationally regulated by the divalent cation calcium. Although calcium binding sequences are not well conserved and hence not easy to predict, the cell-binding domain of syndecan-4 contains both aspartic and glutamic acid, two amino acids commonly involved in calcium coordination (10McFall A.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12901-12904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Maurer P. Hohenester E. Engel J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Third, all specificity tests yielded qualitatively identical results. None of the other vertebrate syndecan family members, namely syndecan-1, -2, and -3, can compete for the interaction between mS4ED and the cell surface. Thus, the association between syndecan-4 and its cell surface-binding sites is specific to this family member and reflects a syndecan-4 specific function. Furthermore, the cell-binding domain of mS4ED competes as effectively as intact mS4ED. This domain is contained within amino acids 56–109 of mS4ED. Removing 13 amino acids from the C terminus or 20 amino acids from the N terminus abrogates the ability of this domain to function. A deletion mutant, lacking amino acids 56–108 of mS4ED, fails to compete for binding of mS4ED to cells in both assays, further confirming that the cell-binding domain is discrete and represented once in the extracellular protein domain of syndecan-4. The identification and characterization of the cell-binding domain of syndecan-4 has relied on the use of syndecan-4 derivatives expressed by bacteria. Bacterially expressed syndecan-4 is free of glycosaminoglycan modifications, ensuring that any interactions observed are mediated solely by syndecan-4 protein sequences. It is important, however, to confirm that the binding sites present on the cell surface interact with syndecan-4 produced and post-translationally modified by mammalian cells. The glycosaminoglycan content of syndecan-4, for example, could regulate the cell-binding domain interaction, potentially inhibiting it. Mammalian cells express syndecan-4 as a transmembrane molecule and as a shed product, which is cleaved at the cell surface by an undefined proteolytic activity (4Kim C.W. Goldberger O.A. Gallo R.L. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 17Kojima T. Shworak N.W. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4870-4877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24David G. Van der Schueren B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.J. van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). While full-length syndecan-4 contains the cell-binding domain sequence, it was unknown whether it is present in shed syndecan-4. Data from this report demonstrate that syndecan-4 shed from the cell surface contains a fully active cell-binding domain. Mutagenesis of recombinant mS4ED indicates that one or more amino acids C-terminal to residue 96 are critical for the cell-binding domain to function, suggesting that proteolytic cleavage of syndecan-4 occurs within the 26 amino acids that immediately precede the transmembrane domain. Furthermore, shed syndecan-4 competes equally well for binding of mS4ED to cells with or without its glycosaminoglycan chains. Thus, the glycosaminoglycan content of syndecan-4 does not appear to directly regulate the activity of the cell-binding domain. These data indicate that shed syndecan-4 may represent a protein ligand for cells in vivo. The extracellular protein domains of the individual syndecans are logical sites for mediating syndecan-specific interactions because they are divergent, both in size and sequence. However, for a given family member, there is little conservation between species (1Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). For example, a comparison of the cell-binding domain of mouse to the same region within chicken syndecan-4 indicates that the two regions are only 34% identical (10McFall A.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12901-12904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of particular significance that on a functional basis, the interaction between syndecan-4 and the cell surface is highly conserved. Syndecan-4 from mouse and chicken compete equally well for the interaction between mouse syndecan-4 and the cell surface of mouse aortic endothelial cells. Furthermore, both mouse and human cells interact with the cell-binding domain of mouse syndecan-4 with the same affinity. This high degree of functional conservation within the syndecan-4 protein suggests that the extracellular protein domains of the other syndecan family members may also harbor binding activities despite their apparent divergence. Preliminary evidence indicates that syndecan-1 engages cell surface molecules present on at least one cell type via its extracellular protein domain. This interaction also has the potential to be syndecan-specific since mS4ED fails to compete for cell binding to mS1ED. Both the shed and membrane-anchored forms of syndecan-4 are candidates for mediating cell-binding domain interactions in vivo. By extrapolation from the cell adhesion assay, shed syndecan-4 may function as a matrix-embedded adhesive ligand for cells, possibly anchored to extracellular matrix molecules via its heparan sulfate chains. Alternatively, shed syndecan-4 may interact with cells as a soluble ligand. As a recently identified component of wound fluid, shed syndecan-4 has the potential to regulate the activity of heparan-binding molecules, such as growth factors, involved in the wounding response (25Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The cell-binding domain could potentially serve to facilitate or down-regulate the activity of such ligands by either bringing them in close proximity of their cell surface receptors or accelerating their endocytosis and subsequent degradation. Equally plausible, the cell-binding domain may also regulate the assembly of cell surface complexes containing membrane-anchored syndecan-4."

Activation of Ca2+-independent novel protein kinase C (nPKC) precedes glucocorticoid-induced thymocyte apoptosis, while proper levels of Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C (cPKC) and calcineurin activities contribute to rescue thymocytes. To clarify the role of nPKC in thymocyte apoptosis, murine thymocytes were stimulated with the diterpene diester, ingenol 3,20-dibenzoate (IDB). IDB induced selective translocation of nPKC-δ, -ε, and -θ and PKC-μ from the cytosolic fraction to the particulate fraction and induced morphologically typical apoptosis through de novo synthesis of macromolecules. The apoptosis was also induced by thymeleatoxin, a diterpene ester, at relatively high concentrations that induced translocation of cPKC, nPKC-θ, and PKC-μ. The IDB- or thymeleatoxin-induced death was inhibited by non-isoform-selective PKC inhibitors, but not by their structural analogs with weak PKC-inhibitory activity or the selective inhibitor of cPKC and PKC-μ, Gö 6976. The death was also inhibited by calcium ionophore ionomycin at concentrations within a narrow range. The range corresponded to the concentration range that contributes to the inhibition of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis.

Immature T cell clones in the thymus are selected to survive or die at the CD4+CD8+ stage according to the specificity of the T cell receptors (TCRs).1 Useful clones are protected from apoptosis and differentiate into mature CD4+CD8− or CD4−CD8+T cells (positive selection), while self-reactive clones undergo apoptosis (negative selection). Useless clones also appear to undergo apoptosis. The TCR-mediated signals are critical for the fate of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and involve protein kinase C (PKC) activation. PKC consists of several subfamilies of enzymes including Ca2+-dependent classical PKC (cPKC) and Ca2+-independent novel PKC (nPKC) and atypical PKC (aPKC) (1Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). Each isoform or subfamily of PKC appears to play its own role in the fate of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. We have previously indicated that activation of cPKC is involved in positive selection (2Ohoka Y. Kuwata T. Asada A. Zhao Y. Mukai M. Iwata M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5707-5716PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, thymocyte apoptosis induced by TCR/CD3- and CD28-mediated stimulation in vitro appears to be accompanied by activation of both cPKC and nPKC, 2A. Asada, Y. Zhao, T. Kuwata, M.

Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in thymocytes is preceded by activation of nPKC including nPKC-ε and is inhibited by non-isoform-selective PKC inhibitors but not by Gö 6976, a specific inhibitor of cPKC isoforms and PKC-μ (11Iwata M.

The apoptosis is also inhibited by proper levels of stimulation through TCR·CD3 complex with co-stimulation through CD4, CD8, or lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (11Iwata M. Hanaoka S. Sato K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 16Zhao Y. Iwata M. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Iwata M. Curr.

The antiapoptotic effect is mimicked by moderate stimulation with proper combinations of PMA and the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin or combinations of thymeleatoxin (TTX) and ionomycin (2Ohoka Y. Kuwata T.

Mukai M. Iwata M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5707-5716PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, proper levels of cPKC activity appear to be involved in both the protection of CD4+CD8+thymocytes from apoptosis and the induction of positive selection. Indeed, transient stimulation of isolated CD4+CD8+ thymocytes with the antiapoptotic combinations of TTX/ionomycin induced differentiation and commitment of the cells to the CD4 or CD8 T cell lineage (2Ohoka Y. Kuwata T. Asada A. Zhao Y. Mukai M. Iwata M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5707-5716PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyzed a possible relationship between thymocyte apoptosis and activation of nPKC isoforms by using the diterpene esters ingenol 3,20-dibenzoate (IDB) and TTX. We also analyzed the effect of calcineurin activation on nPKC-dependent apoptosis in thymocytes, since activation of calcineurin as well as cPKC was critical for the inhibition of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in thymocytes and for thymocyte positive selection (16Zhao Y. Iwata M. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Zhao Y. Tozawa Y. Iseki R. Mukai M. Iwata M. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6346-6354PubMed Google Scholar). The present results suggest that nPKC activation induces apoptosis in immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and that calcineurin activation contributes to protect the cells from the apoptosis. BALB/c mice (4–6 weeks of age) were obtained from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). BOG8 TCR transgenic mice with RAG-2(−/−), and nonselecting MHC backgrounds were established as described previously (19Ohoka Y. Kuwata T. Tozawa Y. Zhao Y. Mukai M. Motegi Y. Suzuki R. Yokoyama M. Iwata M. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 24Iwata M. Kuwata T. Mukai M. Tozawa Y. Yokoyama M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2081-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Major histocompatibility complex class I and class II double knockout (DKO) mice (C57BL/6 deficient in Aβb and β2-microglobulin) were obtained from Taconic (Immuno-Biological Laboratories, Gunma, Japan). DEX, PMA, and IDB were obtained from Wako (Osaka, Japan), Sigma, and Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), respectively. Ionomycin, TTX, Gö 6976, Gö 6983, and recombinant human cPKC-α and nPKC-ε were obtained from Calbiochem. H-7 and HA1004 were obtained from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). Ro 31–8425 (bisindolylmaleimide X) and Ro 31–6045 (bisindolylmaleimide V) were obtained from LC Laboratories (Läufelfingen, Switzerland). Splenic T cells were obtained from BALB/c mice as described previously (16Zhao Y. Iwata M. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the splenic T cell preparations, 88–92% of the cells were TCRαβ+ by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Thymocytes or splenic T cells (3.75–4 × 106) were suspended in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (JRH Bioscience, Woodland, CA), 3 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1× minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 20 units of penicillin, and 20 μg of streptomycin (complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) and were cultured for the indicated times at 37 °C in the presence or absence of the indicated drugs in 24-well tissue culture plates (Corning 25820, Corning, NY). To examine the expression of CD4, CD8, and TCR, the cells were stained with labeled antibodies: R-phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (RM4–5), fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody (53–6.7), or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled or biotinylated anti-TCRαβ monoclonal antibody (H57–597) (Pharmingen) with or without streptavidin TRI-Color (Caltag Laboratories, San Francisco, CA). Viable cells were gated by using forward and side scatters with a FACScan flow cytometer and FACScan research software (Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) and were analyzed for marker expression. The gate for viable cells was determined by using propidium iodide exclusion and Paint-a-Gate software (Becton Dickinson). DNA fragmentation in thymocytes was determined as described previously (11Iwata M. Hanaoka S. Sato K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells harvested by centrifugation were lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100 containing 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 1 mm EDTA for 20 min on ice. The lysate and its supernatant after centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min were sonicated for 15 s, and then DNA contents were measured by fluorometry using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) and Fluoroskan II (Titertek; Flow Laboratories USA, McLean, VA). The percentage of DNA fragmented was calculated as the ratio of DNA content in the supernatant to that in the lysate. Cytoysis was assessed by a trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Immunoblotting analysis of PKC isoforms was performed as described previously (14Iwata M. Iseki R. Sato K. Tozawa Y. Ohoka Y. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with slight modification. The cultured thymocytes were centrifuged at 450 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C, and each cell pellet (107 cells) was washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.3% mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 250 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mm benzamidine). After a 5-min incubation, cell lysis was confirmed by trypan blue, and the suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 70 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and sonicated for 1 min. The homogenate was applied onto DEAE-cellulose DE-52 columns for removing DNA and partial purification. The columns were washed with ice-cold buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.3% mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm benzamidine) and eluted with buffer B supplemented with 0.2 m NaCl. The eluate is referred to as the particulate fraction. The proteins in the particulate fractions and those in the cytosolic fractions were precipitated with ethanol (final concentration of 60% (v/v)). Equivalent amounts of proteins were solubilized in sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (9% gel) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Micron Separations, Westboro, MA). The membranes were soaked in 5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with monoclonal anti-PKC antibodies (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). PKC isoforms (α, β, γ, δ, ε, η, θ, μ, λ, and ζ) were detected with horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo, Japan). It should be noted, however, that the anti-cPKC-α cross-reacts with β and that the anti-cPKC-γ cross-reacts with α according to the manufacturer. Cells were prefixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), washed twice with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, postfixed with 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, and embedded in 2% agar. The cells were dehydrated in an ethanol series, embedded in Epon 812, and kept at 60 °C for more than 48 h to polymerize the resin. After ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, they were observed under 1200EX transmission electron microscopy (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). We have previously shown that glucocorticoids induce an increase in nPKC activity in the particulate fraction of murine thymocytes and translocation of nPKC-ε from the cytosolic fraction to the particulate fraction (14Iwata M. Iseki R. Sato K. Tozawa Y. Ohoka Y. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Other nPKC isoforms were not significantly detected in these cells by using the antibodies available at that time, but here we could also detect nPKC-δ and -θ by using newly available antibodies. nPKC-η was not detectable. In the normal thymus, 80–85% of thymocytes are immature CD4+CD8+ cells that express low levels of Bcl-2 and are sensitive to induction of apoptosis by glucocorticoids (25Veis D.J. Sentman C.L. Bach E.A. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2546-2554PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, DKO mice were used, since T cell development is arrested at the CD4+CD8+ stage in these mice, and almost all of the thymocytes are CD4+CD8+ cells (26Grusby M.J. Auchincloss Jr., H. Lee R. Johnson R.S. Spencer J.P. Zijlstra M. Jaenisch R. Papaioannou V.E. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3913-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The synthetic glucocorticoid, DEX, induced increases in nPKC-δ and -θ in the particulate fraction of thymocytes from DKO mice after 2–2.5 h of incubation and induced decreases in these isoforms in the cytosolic fraction after 2–3 h of incubation (Fig. 1), suggesting that the nPKC isoforms were translocated. cPKC isoforms in the particulate fraction only slightly increased after 2 h of incubation, while those in the cytosolic fraction did not significantly change (Fig. 1). DEX did not induce translocation of PKC-μ, a PKC distantly related to nPKC (1Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar), or that of aPKC-λ or -ζ (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Similar changes in the intracellular distribution of PKC isoforms were observed in BALB/c mouse thymocytes treated with DEX, and the translocation of nPKC-ε was also confirmed (data not shown). However, the expression of nPKC-ε molecule in C57BL/6 and DKO thymocytes was consistently low, and thus its translocation was hardly detectable. Since DEX-induced DNA fragmentation in thymocytes is inhibited by non-isoform-selective PKC inhibitors but not by the cPKC-specific inhibitor Gö 6976 (14Iwata M. Iseki R. Sato K. Tozawa Y. Ohoka Y. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Iwata M. Ohoka Y. Kuwata T. Asada A. Stem Cells. 1996; 14: 632-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the results suggest that activation of nPKC isoforms may be involved in the death but that nPKC-ε activation may not be essential. The diterpene diester IDB has once been suggested to be a selective activator of PKC-ε, but it is not specific to this isoform as the manufacturer indicates in the product catalog. IDB at 10 or 50 nm induced translocation of nPKC-δ, -ε, and -θ and PKC-μ from the cytosolic fractions to the particulate fractions of both thymocytes and splenic T cells, whereas it did not induce translocation of cPKC isoforms or aPKC-ζ and -λ (Fig. 2 and data not shown), indicating that IDB selectively activates nPKC isoforms and PKC-μ in these cells in this dose range. On the other hand, as TTX is known as a cPKC-specific activator (20Ryves W.J. Evans A.T. Olivier A.R. Parker P.J. Evans F.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 21Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar), incubation of thymocytes with 0.3 ng/ml TTX induced selective translocation of cPKC-α and -β (Fig. 2). However, at higher concentrations (1 ng/ml or higher), TTX is no longer specific for cPKC in thymocytes.

IDB induced DNA fragmentation in thymocytes but not in splenic T cells (Fig. 3, A and B), indicating that IDB induces death in immature T cells but not in mature T cells. IDB as well as DEX induced DNA fragmentation in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes from DKO mice and BOG8 TCR transgenic mice with RAG-2 (−/−) and nonselecting major histocompatibility complex backgrounds (data not shown). In the latter mice, T cell development is also arrested at CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, and almost all of the thymocytes are CD4+CD8+ cells (19Ohoka Y. Kuwata T. Tozawa Y. Zhao Y. Mukai M. Motegi Y. Suzuki R. Yokoyama M. Iwata M. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as in DKO mice. Incubation of thymocytes with IDB induced morphological changes typical in apoptosis, such as shrinkage of cells, clumping of chromatin into masses, and dilation of endoplasmic vesicles, while keeping mitochondrial structure almost normal (Fig. 4) as observed in glucocorticoid-treated thymocytes (4Willie A.H. Morris R.G. Smith A.L. Dunlop D. J. Pathol. 1984; 142: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). TTX at 0.3 ng/ml did not induce DNA fragmentation in thymocytes, but TTX at 1 ng/ml did induce it (Fig. 3 C). Thus, there was a close correlation between activation of nPKC, especially the θ-isoform, and induction of apoptosis in thymocytes.Figure 4Morphologically typical apoptosis is induced in thymocytes by IDB stimulation. Thymocytes from BALB/c mice were cultured in the presence (D, E, and F) or the absence (A, B, and C) of 50 nm IDB for 16 h. After the culture, the cells were harvested and fixed, and their morphology was analyzed by electron microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The IDB-induced DNA fragmentation in thymocytes was inhibited by actinomycin D or cycloheximide (Fig. 5,A and B), suggesting that de novosynthesis of both RNA and proteins is necessary for the apoptosis. Accordingly, there was a time lag of more than 6 h to induce DNA fragmentation after the IDB addition (Fig. 5 B). PKC inhibitors were used to examine if PKC activation is essential for the induction of apoptosis. H-7, an inhibitor of both nPKC and cPKC and some other kinases (27Hidaka H. Inagaki M. Kawamoto S.

Ro 31-8425, a staurosporine-related and highly specific PKC inhibitor (29Muid R.E. Dale M.M. Davis P.D. Elliot L.H. Hill C.H. Kumar H. Lawton G. Twomey B.M. Wadsworth J. Wilkinson S.E. Nixon J.S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), also inhibited the DNA fragmentation (Fig. 6 A). The inhibition of death was confirmed by a trypan blue dye exclusion assay (data not shown). Ro 31-8425 at 1 μg/ml completely inhibited the activation of recombinant cPKC-α and recombinant nPKC-ε in vitro (data not shown), confirming that Ro 31-8425 is a non-isoform-selective PKC inhibitor. On the other hand, the structural analogs of these inhibitors with weak PKC-inhibitory activity, HA1004 and Ro 31-6045 (27Hidaka H. Inagaki M. Kawamoto S. Sasaki Y.

The selective inhibitor of cPKC and PKC-μ, Gö 6976, also failed to inhibit the IDB-induced DNA fragmentation, whereas its structural analog, Gö 6983 inhibited the death (Fig. 6 B). Gö 6983 has been shown to inhibit various PKC isoforms including cPKC, nPKC-δ, and PKC-ζ, but it does not effectively inhibit PKC-μ (23Gschwendt M. Dieterich S. Rennecke J. Kittstein W. Mueller H.-J. Johannes F.-J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Similar effects were observed on TTX-induced DNA fragmentation in thymocytes by using these inhibitors and analogs (Fig. 6 B and data not shown). The results collectively suggest that nPKC activation is essential for the induction of thymocyte apoptosis by IDB. Activation of calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, contributes to the inhibition of glucocorticoid-induced thymocyte apoptosis (16Zhao Y. Iwata M. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Zhao Y. Tozawa Y. Iseki R. Mukai M. Iwata M. J.

Med. 1995; 181: 927-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined if calcineurin activation also contributes to the inhibition of IDB- or TTX-induced apoptosis in thymocytes. Ionomycin alone induced DNA fragmentation in thymocytes in a dose-dependent fashion but inhibited IDB-induced DNA fragmentation at concentrations within a narrow range (0.2–0.3 μg/ml) (Fig. 7 A). Thus, ionomycin at these concentrations and IDB were mutually antagonistic in the induction of apoptosis. Similar results were obtained with TTX-induced DNA fragmentation (data not shown). The inhibition of apoptosis was canceled by FK506 but not by rapamycin (Fig. 7 B). Although the structurally related immunosuppressive macrolides FK506 and rapamycin commonly bind to FKBP-12, the FK506·FKBP-12 complex but not the rapamycin·FKBP-12 complex inhibits the phosphatase activity of calcineurin (33Lui J. Farmer J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar). The result thus suggests that calcineurin activation is essential for the antiapoptotic effect. Glucocorticoid-induced DNA fragmentation in thymocytes was not inhibited by ionomycin alone, but it was inhibited by 0.2–0.3 μg/ml ionomycin in the presence of 0.3 ng/ml TTX (Fig. 7 C) (2Ohoka Y.

Previous biochemical studies indicated that the C terminus of MxA folds back to form a functional GTP-binding pocket, and that an internal fragment contains a domain required for oligomerization. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have now mapped these domains. MxA sequences located downstream of amino acid 564 were found to strongly interact with an internal domain that includes amino acids 372 to 540. This interaction was abolished by mutating phenylalanine 382 or leucine 612, which is part of a leucine zipper motif. Neither the C-terminal nor the internal MxA fragments formed homo-oligomers. Using a mammalian nuclear transport assay that can detect protein-protein interactions, we further found that full-length MxA forms complexes with MxA fragments that include amino acids 372 to 540. This interaction was not observed when phenylalanine 382 was exchanged for alanine or arginine. Furthermore, interaction of two full-length MxA molecules occurred only if at least one of them carried a functional C-terminal leucine zipper motif. These results suggest that C-terminal back-folding and oligomerization are two alternative outcomes of the same type of interaction between the C-terminal and the internal domains of MxA. Intramolecular interaction is believed to result in the formation of MxA monomers, whereas intermolecular interaction may induce the formation of large MxA oligomers.

MxA is a 76-kDa protein that accumulates in the cytoplasm of many types of human cells in response to exposure to type I interferon (1Horisberger M.A. J.

It is an antiviral protein that can act in the absence of other interferon-induced proteins. Constitutive expression of MxA in cell lines from mice, monkeys or humans mediates a high degree of resistance to infection with influenza A virus (4Pavlovic J. Zürcher T. Haller O. Staeheli P. J.

Because overexpression of MxA can induce apoptosis in Hep3B cells, and because it is abundantly expressed in lymphoblastoid cell lines from Fanconi anemia patients (12Li Y. Youssoufian H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2873-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it was suggested that MxA may contribute to the pathological losses of hematopoetic cells in this disease.The primary structures and biochemical properties indicate that Mx proteins are members of the superfamily of large GTPases, which includes dynamin (13Obar R.A. Collins C.A. Hammarback J.A. Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1990; 347: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and yeast pVPS-1 (14Rothman J.H. Raymond C.K. Gilbert T. O'Hara J. Stevens T.H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1063-1074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Characteristic properties of these enzymes are that they bind GTP with low affinity and perform multiple cycles of GTP hydrolysis in the absence of nucleotide exchange factors (15Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Richter M.F. Schwemmle M. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13512-13517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cells expressing MxA variants with mutations in the GTP-binding consensus element do not exhibit enhanced virus resistance (17Pitossi F. Blank A. Schroder A. Schwarz A. Hussi P. Schwemmle M. Pavlovic J. Staeheli P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6726-6732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that GTP-binding is required for biological activity of Mx proteins. In vitro transcription experiments with vesicular stomatitis virus nucleocapsids showed that purified MxA can inhibit this viral multiplication step (18Schwemmle M. Weining K.C. Richter M.F. Schumacher B. Staeheli P. Virology. 1994; 206: 545-554Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because inhibition was also observed when GTP-γS was the only guanine nucleotide present in the reaction mixtures, it was concluded that binding but not hydrolysis of GTP is essential for Mx activity (18Schwemmle M. Weining K.C. Richter M.F. Schumacher B. Staeheli P. Virology. 1994; 206: 545-554Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Several attempts were made to define functional domains of Mx proteins. The N-terminal moiety of MxA contains a consensus tripartite GTP-binding element (1Horisberger M.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4705-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is required for GTPase and antiviral activity (16Richter M.F. Schwemmle M. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13512-13517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Pitossi F. Blank A. Schroder A. Schwarz A. Hussi P. Schwemmle M. Pavlovic J. Staeheli P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6726-6732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal region which includes a leucine zipper motif seems to serve several different functions. It was shown to contain the antiviral effector domain (19Ponten A. Sick C. Weber M. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a domain that determines antiviral specificity (20Zürcher T. Pavlovic J. Staeheli P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1657-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, this region also contains a domain which is required for binding and hydrolysis of GTP (21Schwemmle M. Richter M. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13518-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Limited proteolysis of purified MxA resulted in a N-terminal 60-kDa and a C-terminal 10-kDa fragment, which remained complexed and, together, exhibited high GTPase activity (21Schwemmle M. Richter M. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13518-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although the sequences involved in the formation of this complex had not been defined, it was hypothesized that the C terminus of MxA might fold back to form the GTP-binding pocket (21Schwemmle M. Richter M. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13518-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).A characteristic feature of Mx proteins is that they form large oligomers (16Richter M.F. Schwemmle M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15033-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical work with the mouse Mx1 protein suggested that a domain in the N-terminal moiety located between the first and the second motif of the tripartite GTP-binding element mediates oligomerization (23Nakayama M. Yazaki K. Kusano A. Nagata K. Hanai N. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15033-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, results from another study indicated that the leucine zipper motif near the C terminus of Mx1 was both necessary and sufficient for this activity (22Melen K. Ronni T. Broni B. Krug R.M. von Bonsdorff C.H. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25898-25907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This discrepancy is probably because of technical difficulties resulting from the high tendency of most Mx fragments to form huge aggregates (21Schwemmle M. Richter M. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13518-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). More recent work with dominant negative MxA mutants demonstrated that a newly developed nuclear transport assay may permit the mapping of the interaction domains (19Ponten A. Sick C. Weber M. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It further showed that a fragment comprising amino acids 359 to 572 associated with full-length MxA, indicating that oligomerization is controlled by a domain in this region (19Ponten A. Sick C. Weber M. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system and the nuclear transport assay to define sequences that are involved in the intramolecular folding and oligomerization of MxA. Our results indicate that back-folding of the C terminus and oligomerization are related processes. Interaction of the C-terminal domain with the internal domain of the same molecule results in monomer formation, whereas interactions involving two MxA molecules may initiate a chain reaction that results in the formation of large oligomeric structures.DISCUSSIONIn this report we identified two interaction-competent domains in the MxA protein. We found that a first domain, which is located in the C-terminal 99 amino acids is able to specifically contact a second domain, which is located between amino acids 372 and 540. This constellation predicts the existence of monomeric and multimeric forms of MxA in which the two domains participate in the formation of either intramolecular or intermolecular interactions as outlined in Fig. 7.Previous work with mouse Mx1 protein suggested that a leucine zipper motif located near the C terminus is responsible for oligomerization (22Melen K. Ronni T. Broni B. Krug R.M. von Bonsdorff C.H. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25898-25907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that the corresponding motif near the C terminus of MxA is required but not sufficient for oligomerization. In contrast to the results reported for mouse Mx1, the MxA domain, which carries the leucine zipper motif, cannot associate with the same motif on a second MxA molecule. Rather, the interaction target of the C-terminal domain is an internal MxA domain. Evidence that the leucine zipper motif is of importance for this interaction came from experiments with the MxA mutant L612K, which has a leucine residue of the motif replaced by lysine. As expected, if the model in Fig. 7 was correct, full-length MxA(L612K) still interacted with wild-type MxA presumably because the intact C-terminal domain of the wild-type molecule made contact with the unchanged internal domain of the mutant molecule, although it could no longer interact with MxA mutants carrying either the same defect or lacking part of the C-terminal domain.It is important to note that the internal interaction domain of MxA that we defined here is not related to the proposed oligomerization domain of mouse Mx1 (23Nakayama M. Yazaki K. Kusano A. Nagata K. Hanai N. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15033-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was mapped to the N-terminal moiety. Our results indicate rather that the N-terminal moiety of MxA does not actively participate in complex formation. Little is known about the structural motifs present in the internal MxA domain, which are important for the interaction with the C-terminal domain. Here, we experimentally tested the role of a heptad repeat of hydrophobic amino acids that includes Leu-375, Phe-382, Leu-389, Val-396, and Leu-403. Because mutation of Phe-382, but not Leu-389, abolished the interaction, it is unlikely that the heptad repeat is of critical importance. Nonetheless, our results showed that Phe-382 is involved in the interaction. Interestingly, the F382A mutation destroyed the interactive domain only when introduced into the minimal interaction-competent MxA fragment but not in the context of full-length MxA. This result suggests that sequences outside the immediate interaction domain can also participate in complex formation, thereby probably compensating for the destabilizing effect of the mutation. This view is supported by our observation that the interaction of two full-length MxA molecules was stronger than the interaction of full-length MxA with the various N-terminally truncated MxA fragments (Fig. 2). We cannot exclude the remote possibility that by mutating Phe-382, the MxA fragments became a better target for partial proteolytic degradation. Our findings are in conflict with previous biochemical studies (16Richter M.F. Schwemmle M. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13512-13517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which showed that N-terminal MxA fragments lacking both interaction domains that we defined here formed large complexes in vitro. It is conceivable that the previously observed formation of stable complexes resulted from the strong aggregation behavior of MxA and thus represented an in vitro artifact.Our studies also revealed that the various methods that can be used to measure molecular interactions in vivo may yield conflicting results under certain conditions. For example, using the yeast two-hybrid system it was not possible to map the boundaries of the internal domain of MxA that interacts with full-length MxA (Fig. 3), whereas such studies were feasible with the eukaryotic nuclear translocation assay (Fig. 4). From theoretical considerations it appears that this intermolecular interaction may be difficult to detect because of competition by the intramolecular interaction between the C-terminal and internal domains in the wild-type molecule. It is possible, therefore, that the bulky fusion proteins used in the yeast two-hybrid system performed less well in this respect than the much smaller molecules used in the nuclear translocation assay.The results reported here support a previous hypothesis (21Schwemmle M. Richter M. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13518-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that the C terminus of MxA folds back to constitute the functional GTPase domain. Surprisingly, however, the major touch-down site of the C-terminal domain is not located in the immediate vicinity of the tripartite GTP-binding motif, as we had speculated (21Schwemmle M. Richter M. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13518-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); rather, it is located more than 120 amino acids further downstream. Although unexpected, this constellation might be advantageous and may allow greater flexibility of the different MxA domains involved in binding and hydrolysis of GTP. This particular structural property may also explain why an MxA mutant that lacks the internal interaction domain (MxA(Δ301–576)) retained about 10% of wild-type GTPase activity (21Schwemmle M. Richter M. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13518-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this mutant, there is probably no need for the C-terminal domain to fold back because the large internal deletion may fortuitously move the critical C-terminal domain into the immediate vicinity of the GTP-binding motif so that the resulting structure may resemble the GTP-binding pocket of full-length MxA.The overall structure of MxA as defined in this study clearly resembles that of dynamin. Recent experiments with dynamin (15Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) indicated that, like in the case of MxA (21Schwemmle M. Richter M. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13518-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), limited proteolysis yields a large N-terminal and a small C-terminal fragment that remain complexed via noncovalent bonds. Furthermore, backfolding of a C-terminal domain is believed to be essential for GTP hydrolysis of dynamin (15Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), although the relevant interaction domains of dynamin have not yet been mapped. From our work with MxA it seems likely that the internal interaction domain of dynamin may also be located downstream of the GTP-binding element and that back-folding and oligomerization of dynamin may also involve intra- and intermolecular interactions as illustrated for MxA in Fig. 7.An interesting aspect of this work is that we identified an MxA mutant that no longer forms oligomers. Because the importance of oligomerization for GTPase and antiviral activity of MxA has not yet been elucidated, mutant MxA(L612K) is a precious tool for further studies along these lines. Preliminary results indicate that MxA(L612K) exhibits substantial antiviral activity when expressed in mouse 3T3 cells, although it lacks detectable GTPase activity. 2B. Schumacher and P. Staeheli, unpublished results. MxA is a 76-kDa protein that accumulates in the cytoplasm of many types of human cells in response to exposure to type I interferon (1Horisberger M.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4705-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Aebi M. Fah J. Hurt N. Samuel C.E. Thomis D. Bazzigher L. Pavlovic J. Haller O. Staeheli P. Mol. Cell.

It is an antiviral protein that can act in the absence of other interferon-induced proteins. Constitutive expression of MxA in cell lines from mice, monkeys or humans mediates a high degree of resistance to infection with influenza A virus (4Pavlovic J. Zürcher T. Haller O. Staeheli P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3370-3375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Thogotovirus (5Frese M. Kochs G. Meier-Dieter U. Siebler J. Haller O. J.

Furthermore, transgenic mice constitutively expressing MxA resist challenge infections with Thogotovirus (11Pavlovic J. Arzet H.A. Hefti H.P. Frese M. Rost D. Ernst B. Kolb E. Staeheli P. Haller O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4506-4510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because overexpression of MxA can induce apoptosis in Hep3B cells, and because it is abundantly expressed in lymphoblastoid cell lines from Fanconi anemia patients (12Li Y. Youssoufian H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2873-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it was suggested that MxA may contribute to the pathological losses of hematopoetic cells in this disease. The primary structures and biochemical properties indicate that Mx proteins are members of the superfamily of large GTPases, which includes dynamin (13Obar R.A. Collins C.A. Hammarback J.A. Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1990; 347: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and yeast pVPS-1 (14Rothman J.H. Raymond C.K. Gilbert T. O'Hara J. Stevens T.H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1063-1074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Characteristic properties of these enzymes are that they bind GTP with low affinity and perform multiple cycles of GTP hydrolysis in the absence of nucleotide exchange factors (15Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Richter M.F. Schwemmle M. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13512-13517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cells expressing MxA variants with mutations in the GTP-binding consensus element do not exhibit enhanced virus resistance (17Pitossi F. Blank A. Schroder A. Schwarz A. Hussi P. Schwemmle M. Pavlovic J. Staeheli P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6726-6732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that GTP-binding is required for biological activity of Mx proteins. In vitro transcription experiments with vesicular stomatitis virus nucleocapsids showed that purified MxA can inhibit this viral multiplication step (18Schwemmle M. Weining K.C. Richter M.F. Schumacher B. Staeheli P. Virology. 1994; 206: 545-554Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because inhibition was also observed when GTP-γS was the only guanine nucleotide present in the reaction mixtures, it was concluded that binding but not hydrolysis of GTP is essential for Mx activity (18Schwemmle M. Weining K.C. Richter M.F. Schumacher B. Staeheli P. Virology. 1994; 206: 545-554Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Several attempts were made to define functional domains of Mx proteins. The N-terminal moiety of MxA contains a consensus tripartite GTP-binding element (1Horisberger M.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4705-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is required for GTPase and antiviral activity (16Richter M.F. Schwemmle M. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13512-13517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Pitossi F. Blank A. Schroder A. Schwarz A. Hussi P. Schwemmle M. Pavlovic J. Staeheli P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6726-6732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal region which includes a leucine zipper motif seems to serve several different functions. It was shown to contain the antiviral effector domain (19Ponten A. Sick C. Weber M. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a domain that determines antiviral specificity (20Zürcher T. Pavlovic J. Staeheli P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1657-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, this region also contains a domain which is required for binding and hydrolysis of GTP (21Schwemmle M. Richter M. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13518-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Limited proteolysis of purified MxA resulted in a N-terminal 60-kDa and a C-terminal 10-kDa fragment, which remained complexed and, together, exhibited high GTPase activity (21Schwemmle M. Richter M. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13518-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although the sequences involved in the formation of this complex had not been defined, it was hypothesized that the C terminus of MxA might fold back to form the GTP-binding pocket (21Schwemmle M. Richter M. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13518-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of Mx proteins is that they form large oligomers (16Richter M.F. Schwemmle M. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13512-13517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Pitossi F. Blank A. Schroder A. Schwarz A. Hussi P. Schwemmle M. Pavlovic J. Staeheli P. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15033-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical work with the mouse Mx1 protein suggested that a domain in the N-terminal moiety located between the first and the second motif of the tripartite GTP-binding element mediates oligomerization (23Nakayama M. Yazaki K. Kusano A. Nagata K. Hanai N. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15033-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, results from another study indicated that the leucine zipper motif near the C terminus of Mx1 was both necessary and sufficient for this activity (22Melen K. Ronni T. Broni B. Krug R.M. von Bonsdorff C.H. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25898-25907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This discrepancy is probably because of technical difficulties resulting from the high tendency of most Mx fragments to form huge aggregates (21Schwemmle M. Richter M. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13518-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). More recent work with dominant negative MxA mutants demonstrated that a newly developed nuclear transport assay may permit the mapping of the interaction domains (19Ponten A. Sick C. Weber M. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It further showed that a fragment comprising amino acids 359 to 572 associated with full-length MxA, indicating that oligomerization is controlled by a domain in this region (19Ponten A. Sick C. Weber M. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system and the nuclear transport assay to define sequences that are involved in the intramolecular folding and oligomerization of MxA. Our results indicate that back-folding of the C terminus and oligomerization are related processes. Interaction of the C-terminal domain with the internal domain of the same molecule results in monomer formation, whereas interactions involving two MxA molecules may initiate a chain reaction that results in the formation of large oligomeric structures. DISCUSSIONIn this report we identified two interaction-competent domains in the MxA protein. We found that a first domain, which is located in the C-terminal 99 amino acids is able to specifically contact a second domain, which is located between amino acids 372 and 540. This constellation predicts the existence of monomeric and multimeric forms of MxA in which the two domains participate in the formation of either intramolecular or intermolecular interactions as outlined in Fig. 7.Previous work with mouse Mx1 protein suggested that a leucine zipper motif located near the C terminus is responsible for oligomerization (22Melen K. Ronni T. Broni B. Krug R.M. von Bonsdorff C.H. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25898-25907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that the corresponding motif near the C terminus of MxA is required but not sufficient for oligomerization. In contrast to the results reported for mouse Mx1, the MxA domain, which carries the leucine zipper motif, cannot associate with the same motif on a second MxA molecule. Rather, the interaction target of the C-terminal domain is an internal MxA domain. Evidence that the leucine zipper motif is of importance for this interaction came from experiments with the MxA mutant L612K, which has a leucine residue of the motif replaced by lysine. As expected, if the model in Fig. 7 was correct, full-length MxA(L612K) still interacted with wild-type MxA presumably because the intact C-terminal domain of the wild-type molecule made contact with the unchanged internal domain of the mutant molecule, although it could no longer interact with MxA mutants carrying either the same defect or lacking part of the C-terminal domain.It is important to note that the internal interaction domain of MxA that we defined here is not related to the proposed oligomerization domain of mouse Mx1 (23Nakayama M. Yazaki K. Kusano A. Nagata K. Hanai N. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15033-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was mapped to the N-terminal moiety. Our results indicate rather that the N-terminal moiety of MxA does not actively participate in complex formation. Little is known about the structural motifs present in the internal MxA domain, which are important for the interaction with the C-terminal domain. Here, we experimentally tested the role of a heptad repeat of hydrophobic amino acids that includes Leu-375, Phe-382, Leu-389, Val-396, and Leu-403. Because mutation of Phe-382, but not Leu-389, abolished the interaction, it is unlikely that the heptad repeat is of critical importance. Nonetheless, our results showed that Phe-382 is involved in the interaction. Interestingly, the F382A mutation destroyed the interactive domain only when introduced into the minimal interaction-competent MxA fragment but not in the context of full-length MxA. This result suggests that sequences outside the immediate interaction domain can also participate in complex formation, thereby probably compensating for the destabilizing effect of the mutation. This view is supported by our observation that the interaction of two full-length MxA molecules was stronger than the interaction of full-length MxA with the various N-terminally truncated MxA fragments (Fig. 2). We cannot exclude the remote possibility that by mutating Phe-382, the MxA fragments became a better target for partial proteolytic degradation. Our findings are in conflict with previous biochemical studies (16Richter M.F. Schwemmle M. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13512-13517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which showed that N-terminal MxA fragments lacking both interaction domains that we defined here formed large complexes in vitro. It is conceivable that the previously observed formation of stable complexes resulted from the strong aggregation behavior of MxA and thus represented an in vitro artifact.Our studies also revealed that the various methods that can be used to measure molecular interactions in vivo may yield conflicting results under certain conditions. For example, using the yeast two-hybrid system it was not possible to map the boundaries of the internal domain of MxA that interacts with full-length MxA (Fig. 3), whereas such studies were feasible with the eukaryotic nuclear translocation assay (Fig. 4). From theoretical considerations it appears that this intermolecular interaction may be difficult to detect because of competition by the intramolecular interaction between the C-terminal and internal domains in the wild-type molecule. It is possible, therefore, that the bulky fusion proteins used in the yeast two-hybrid system performed less well in this respect than the much smaller molecules used in the nuclear translocation assay.The results reported here support a previous hypothesis (21Schwemmle M. Richter M. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13518-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that the C terminus of MxA folds back to constitute the functional GTPase domain. Surprisingly, however, the major touch-down site of the C-terminal domain is not located in the immediate vicinity of the tripartite GTP-binding motif, as we had speculated (21Schwemmle M. Richter M. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13518-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); rather, it is located more than 120 amino acids further downstream. Although unexpected, this constellation might be advantageous and may allow greater flexibility of the different MxA domains involved in binding and hydrolysis of GTP. This particular structural property may also explain why an MxA mutant that lacks the internal interaction domain (MxA(Δ301–576)) retained about 10% of wild-type GTPase activity (21Schwemmle M. Richter M. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13518-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this mutant, there is probably no need for the C-terminal domain to fold back because the large internal deletion may fortuitously move the critical C-terminal domain into the immediate vicinity of the GTP-binding motif so that the resulting structure may resemble the GTP-binding pocket of full-length MxA.The overall structure of MxA as defined in this study clearly resembles that of dynamin. Recent experiments with dynamin (15Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) indicated that, like in the case of MxA (21Schwemmle M. Richter M. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Staeheli P. J. Biol.

In vitroα1-antichymotrypsin interacts with the Alzheimer's amyloid peptide Aβ1–42 and stimulates both formation and disruption of neurotoxic Aβ1–42 fibrils in a concentration-dependent manner. We have constructed a new hybrid model of the complex between Aβ1–42 and α1-antichymotrypsin in which both amino and carboxyl sequences of Aβ1–42 insert into two different β-sheets of α1-antichymotrypsin. We have tested this model and shown experimentally that full-length and amino-terminal segments of Aβ1–42 bind to α1-antichymotrypsin as predicted. We also show that Aβ1–42 forms both intra- and intermolecular SDS-stable complexes with α1-antichymotrypsin and that the binding of Aβ1–42 to α1-antichymotrypsin abolishes the inhibitory activity of the latter and its ability to form stable complex with chymotrypsin. The existence of both inter- as well as intramolecular complexes of Aβ1–42 explains the nonlinear concentration-dependent effects of α1-antichymotrypsin on Aβ1–42 fibril formation, which we have reinvestigated here over a broad range of Aβ1–42:α1-antichymotrypsin ratios. These data suggest a molecular basis for the distinction between amorphous and fibrillar Aβ1–42 in vivo. The reciprocal effects of Aβ1–42 and α1-antichymotrypsin could play a role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease.

We have constructed a new hybrid model of the complex between Aβ1–42 and α1-antichymotrypsin in which both amino and carboxyl sequences of Aβ1–42 insert into two different β-sheets of α1-antichymotrypsin. We have tested this model and shown experimentally that full-length and amino-terminal segments of Aβ1–42 bind to α1-antichymotrypsin as predicted. We also show that Aβ1–42 forms both intra- and intermolecular SDS-stable complexes with α1-antichymotrypsin and that the binding of Aβ1–42 to α1-antichymotrypsin abolishes the inhibitory activity of the latter and its ability to form stable complex with chymotrypsin. The existence of both inter- as well as intramolecular complexes of Aβ1–42 explains the nonlinear concentration-dependent effects of α1-antichymotrypsin on Aβ1–42 fibril formation, which we have reinvestigated here over a broad range of Aβ1–42:α1-antichymotrypsin ratios. These data suggest a molecular basis for the distinction between amorphous and fibrillar Aβ1–42 in vivo. The reciprocal effects of Aβ1–42 and α1-antichymotrypsin could play a role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. α1-antichymotrypsin β-sheet A of the α1-antichymotrypsin structure β-sheet C of the α1-antichymotrypsin structure. α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT)1 is a serpin serine proteinase inhibitor with specificity for cathepsin and chymotrypsin-like enzymes (1Rubin H.

Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the reactive site loop in the cleaved form of ACT is inserted into a preexisting, flexible β-sheet (sA) (4Baumann U. Huber R.

Bioessays. 1996; 18: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that insertion of the reactive site loop into sA is a prerequisite for stable proteinase-serpin complex formation. In further support of this, it has been shown that exogenous peptides of restricted sequence can insert into sA of the uncleaved serpin (15Schulze A.J. Baumann U. Knof S. Jaeger E. Huber R. Laurell C.-B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 16Björk I. Ylinenjarvi K. Olson S.T. Bock P.E. J. Biol.

These binary peptide·serpin complexes are similarly increased in stability to denaturation but have lost inhibitory activity, becoming substrates instead that do not form a stable complex with target proteinase. A possible link between ACT and Alzheimer's disease was established by the observation that ACT occurs in the senile plaques characteristic of this disease (18Abraham C.R. Selkoe D.J. Potter H. Cell. 1988; 52: 487-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown in vitro that ACT can either stimulate formation of the neurotoxic fibrillar form of Alzheimer's peptide Aβ1–42 (19Ma J. Yee A. Brewer Jr., B. Das S. Potter H. Nature. 1994; 372: 92-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 20Janciauskiene S. Eriksson S. Wright H.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 668-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or destabilize preformed Aβ1–40 fibrils (21Fraser P.E. Nguyen J.T. McLachlan D.R. Abraham C.R. Kirschner D.A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 22Eriksson S. Janciauskiene S. Lannfelt L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2313-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), depending on the stoichiometry of ACT to Aβ. Two models for the binding of Aβ1–42 to ACT (20Janciauskiene S. Eriksson S. Wright H.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 668-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Lukacs C. Christianson D.W. Proteins. Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 25: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), based on the known structure and properties of the latter, suggested how amino and carboxyl segments of Aβ1–42 might bind into different β-sheets of ACT. These two models are not mutually exclusive, and we have synthesized them into a new model presented here in which Aβ1–42binds to ACT through insertion of amino- and carboxyl-terminal segments of Aβ1–42 into different β-sheets of ACT. We have experimentally tested this model and its implications to understand the nature of ACT·Aβ1–42 complexes and their possible relationship to the polymerization of Aβ1–42, which is closely associated with Alzheimer's disease. We show here that full-length Aβ1–42 and also its amino-terminal segments (Aβ2–9 and Aβ1–11) bind to ACT. This supports our bimodal model for the binding of Aβ1–42 to ACT in which the amino-terminal segment of Aβ1–42 inserts into sC of ACT and the carboxyl-terminal segment into sA. The binding of Aβ1–42to ACT results in loss of ACT inhibitor activity and its transformation from an inhibitor into a proteinase substrate, an observation consistent with the effects of the insertion of other peptides into sA of serpins. The bimodal model for the intramolecular 1:1 ACT·Aβ1–42 complex also suggested that intermolecular complexes of higher molecular weight between these molecules may form. We present experimental evidence for the occurrence of complexes of higher multiplicity as well as the 1:1 intramolecular complex. This model for independent, bimodal insertion of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences of Aβ1–42 into ACT also offers a structural basis for the distinct effects of low and high concentrations of ACT on Aβ1–42 fibril formation and stability. We have tested this hypothesis with measurements of the polymerization of Aβ1–42 at a broader range of concentrations of ACT than has been examined before, and the results are described here. Aβ1–42 (Saveen, Denmark), Aβ2–9 (Commonwealth Biotechnologies), and Aβ1–11 (Bachem) were >98% pure.125I-Aβ1–42 and125I-Aβ1–11 were made by the method of Thorell and Johansson (24Thorell J.I. Johansson B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 251: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar) using chloramine T, purified on a Sephadex PD-10 column (G25M), and stored in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.02% sodium azide. Recombinant ACT was purified as described (25McLarney S. Rubin H. Wang Z.M. Nickbarg E.B. Naidoo N. Schoenberger O.L. Johnson J.L. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aβ1–42was solubilized in trifluoroacetic acid and lyophilized before use. An aliquot of lyophilized Aβ1–42 equal to 100- or 200-fold molar excess over ACT was dissolved in sterile 0.015 mTris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl and combined with ACT (29.7 μm). This mixture was incubated under sterile conditions for various time periods from overnight to 3 weeks. In competition experiments with Aβ2–9, ACT was first incubated overnight or up to 3 days with a 200-fold excess of Aβ2–9 followed by addition of a 100-fold or 200-fold excess of Aβ1–42 over ACT, and the mixture incubated further. 125I-labeled Aβ1–11 was used to observe the complex of the amino-terminal peptide with ACT. Labeled Aβ1–11 was mixed with unlabeled peptide to a final specific activity of approximately 2 mCi/mmol and incubated with ACT at a molar ratio of 200:1 (peptide:ACT) in phosphate-buffered saline for 24 and 48 h at room temperature. To control for the possibility of oxidative damage to ACT by free radicals generated by Aβ peptides, we tested the effect of prolonged incubation with 10 μmperoxide on its inhibitor activity and found no loss. ACT is not susceptible to oxidative damage, probably reflecting its function as an acute phase inflammatory reactant that must survive the presence of reactive oxygen species in vivo. The mixture of ACT with125I-Aβ1–11 was run on a 1% agarose gel in Tris barbiturate buffer at pH 8.6. Samples of ACT incubated with Aβ1–42 in the presence and absence of Aβ2–9 were run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Samples were mixed with SDS sample buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCL, 10% glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and heated at 90 °C for 5 min before running. Duplicate samples of the longest incubation were run identically in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol, with no change in pattern. Autoradiographs were made by exposure of high performance autoradiography film (Hyperfilm MP, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to the gel overnight at −70 °C. Western blot transfers to Immobilon-P membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were incubated with rabbit anti-ACT (DAKO, Denmark) followed by peroxidase-labeled pig anti-rabbit antibody and developed with 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma). Complex formation was detected by coincidence of the autoradiograph peptide band with the ACT band from the Western blot. After incubation, the Aβ1–42-ACT mixture and an ACT control were digested with chymotrypsin at a 1:1.2 molar ratio to ACT for 15 min. Digestion was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer, and samples were run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel without reducing agent and stained with Coomassie Blue. Control samples of cleaved, uncomplexed ACT were obtained by digestion with collagenase (Cooper Biomedical) at a molar ratio of 500:1 (ACT + protease) for 2 h at 37 °C. ACT (1.9 μm) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, alone or preincubated as above with Aβ2–9 and/or Aβ1–42 was then incubated with chymotrypsin (1.3 μm) for 5 min at room temperature. Substrate succinyl-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-nitroanilide (Sigma) was added immediately to 0.18 mm and residual activity of chymotrypsin measured at 405 nm for 3 min. The mean of three separate measurements is expressed as the percent of full ACT inhibitor activity (with indicated standard error) in the absence of added peptide. ACT (14.8 μm) alone, mixed with Aβ1–42 at ratios of 10:1, 1:1, 1:10, and 1:100 (ACT:Aβ1–42), and Aβ1–42 alone were incubated 48 h at room temperature in 15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. Fibril formation at various time points was quantitated by fluorometric assay with thioflavin T (26LeVine III, H. Protein Science. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). The structure of cleaved native ACT was used as a starting point, because only in the cleaved serpin is the complete insertion of strand s4A observed. Our assumptions were that ACT strands s1C and s4A were completely displaced by Aβ1–42 residues Gly9–Glu3and Lys28–Ala42, respectively. There are no constraints in this model for the structure of the strand s4A reactive loop strand and strand s1C of ACT and for residues 10–27 of the bound Aβ1–42 in the complex, both of which are depicted by a dotted line, as shown in Fig. 3, with unknown structure. Direct demonstration of complex formation between ACT and Aβ1–42 was obtained from SDS gels of 1:100 (ACT:Aβ1–42) mixtures incubated for 3 days. A slightly higher molecular weight (lower mobility) band is observed with the expected molecular weight of an SDS-stable 1:1 complex of Aβ1–42 with α1-antichymotrypsin (Fig. 1 A, lanes a and b). Our earlier study showed that the carboxyl-terminal segment of Aβ1–42 binds into sA of ACT (20Janciauskiene S. Eriksson S. Wright H.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 668-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and that full-length Aβ1–42 is necessary for this binding. This implied that the amino-terminal segment of Aβ1–42 contributes to complex stability and model building showed how residues 2–9 of Aβ1–42 could insert into sC of ACT(23). Confirmation of the binding of Aβ2–9 was obtained from competition experiments in which Aβ2–9 was shown to block binding of full-length Aβ1–42 peptide. Preincubation of ACT with Aβ2–9 (Fig. 1 A, lane f) followed by incubation with Aβ1–42 showed no formation of the higher molecular weight (lower mobility) ACT·Aβ1–42band. If ACT is incubated first with Aβ1–42 followed by Aβ2–9, the higher molecular weight band is observed (Fig. 1 A, lane e), indicating that the ACT·Aβ1–42 complex is stable once formed in prolonged incubation. The low molecular weight (high mobility) band in lane e is unreactive with ACT antibodies in the Western blot and is an Aβ species. Control incubation of ACT with Aβ2–9 did not detectably change the mobility of ACT from that of the native (Fig. 1 A, lane d), and the possibility of confounding interactions between Aβ2–9 and Aβ1–42 was eliminated by showing that a preincubated (overnight) equimolar mixture of these two peptides did not alter the effects of Aβ1–42 on ACT (data not shown). The complex between the amino-terminal segment of Aβ1–42and ACT inferred from the above competition experiments was directly confirmed by separation of the complex of radioiodinated Aβ1–11 with ACT on agarose gel. Fig. 1 B shows the autoradiogram of a 1% agarose gel in which the incubated mixture of ACT with 125I-labeled Aβ1–11 was run. The band for Aβ1–11 detected by autoradiography is coincident with that for ACT. We conclude from these experiments that the amino-terminal segment as well as the carboxyl-terminal segment of Aβ1–42 binds to ACT and that both are essential for formation of stable complex. Variations in time of incubation and stoichiometry of Aβ1–42:ACT result in different forms of the complexes between these two molecules. A stable high molecular weight (low mobility) band having the approximate molecular weight of an ACT dimer (Fig. 1 C, lane c) is observed on prolonged (3 weeks) incubation with Aβ1–42. This dimer is stable to reduction by β-mercaptoethanol and is blocked by preincubation with Aβ2–9 (Fig. 1 C, lane f). The identity of this complex was confirmed in the gels by autoradiography, which detected125I-Aβ1–42 complexes with ACT (Fig. 1 D, band 2 = dimer), and by Western blot using anti-ACT antibody (data not shown) to detect coincident ACT. This autoradiograph also shows that smaller amounts of higher polymers of the ACT·Aβ1–42 complex are formed (Fig. 1 D, band 3). We conclude that Aβ1–42 can link two molecules of ACT into a highly stable closed dimer through intermolecular bimodal binding to the two different β-sheets, sA and sC, in different molecules and that this is a slow process. The blocking of ACT·Aβ1–42 complex formation by Aβ2–9confirms the requirement for complex formation of binding of the amino terminus of Aβ1–42. This experiment parallels the diminished neurotoxicity and Aβ1–42 fibril formation of ACT·Aβ1–42 observed in the presence of Aβ2–9 (27Ma J. Brewer Jr., B. Potter H. Neurobiol. of Aging. 1996; 17: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), suggesting that the complex we have characterized here is relevant to the neurotoxic and fibrillogenic properties observed by others toward cells in cultures. Shorter incubation time (24 h) of Aβ1–42 with ACT is insufficient to produce SDS stable complexes (Fig. 1 E, lane c versus Fig. 1 A, lane b). We infer that formation of the full bimodal complex is necessary to observe SDS-stable complex and that the kinetics for full complex formation are multistep and slow. The mode of binding of Aβ1–42 to ACT proposed here leads to the prediction that ACT in complex with Aβ1–42 will lose its proteinase inhibitor activity. Inhibition of serine proteinase activity by serpins occurs with formation of an irreversible proteinase-serpin complex whose structure is stabilized by insertion of the proteinase-linked reactive site loop into sA. If Aβ1–42 is inserting into the same site in sA as the reactive site loop, we predict that ACT in complex with Aβ1–42 will lose its proteinase inhibitor activity. Fig. 1 E shows that overnight preincubation of ACT with Aβ1–42 abolishes formation of stable complex between ACT and chymotrypsin. Fig. 1 E, lane b, shows the higher molecular weight inhibitory complex formed on incubation of ACT with chymotrypsin (band 1), whereas lane d shows that, when ACT is preincubated overnight with a 50-fold molar excess of Aβ1–42 prior to incubation with chymotrypsin, no ACT·chymotrypsin complex is formed and only intact (band 2) and cleaved ACT (band 3), along with the cleaved low molecular weight carboxyl-terminal peptide band, are observed. This is consistent with our observations (see below) and earlier ones of other investigators (27Ma J. Brewer Jr., B. Potter H. Neurobiol. of Aging. 1996; 17: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that incubation of ACT with Aβ1–42results in loss of ACT inhibitor activity. It also confirms our earlier conclusion that the stabilization of intact ACT to denaturation after incubation with Aβ1–42 is because of insertion of Aβ1–42 into sA as a substitute for s4A, the reactive site loop strand. Direct assay of proteinase inhibitor activity of the ACT·Aβ1–42 complex lent further weight to the interpretation of the above experiments. Preincubation of ACT with Aβ1–42 results in a loss of 20% and 50% of ACT inhibitor activity versus chymotrypsin at molar concentration ratios of 1:100 and 1:200, respectively (ACT:Aβ1–42) (Fig. 2,sample 3, light and dark gray bar, respectively). This effect parallels the loss of inhibitor activity of the serpins α1-antitrypsin (15Schulze A.J. Baumann U. Knof S. Jaeger E. Huber R. Laurell C.-B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), antithrombin (16Björk I. Ylinenjarvi K. Olson S.T. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (17Eitzman D.T. Fay W.P. Lawrence D.A. Francis-Chmura A.M. Shore J.D. Olson S.T. Ginsburg D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2416-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) on incubation with exogenous peptides that can insert into sA. We exploited this assay system to further test whether the amino-terminal Aβ2–9binds in the complex between Aβ1–42 and ACT. If Aβ2–9 is essential for the binding of full-length Aβ1–42 to ACT, then Aβ2–9 should reverse the loss of inhibitor activity that occurs when Aβ1–42binds to ACT. Parallel assays of ACT inhibitor activity in the presence of Aβ1–42 with and without overnight preincubation with Aβ2–9 show such a reversal in the presence of Aβ2–9. When ACT is preincubated with Aβ2–9 at a 200:1 molar ratio (Aβ2–9:ACT), followed by incubation with Aβ1–42 at 100:1 and 200:1 (Aβ1–42:ACT) ratios, the loss of inhibitor activity is reduced to 5 and 20% from 20 and 50% (sample 4, light and dark gray). These data further support the model for interaction of Aβ1–42 with ACT in which the amino-terminal Aβ2–9 segment as well as the carboxyl-terminal segment of Aβ1–42 bind to ACT. The above experiments show that there are multiple complexes between ACT and Aβ1–42, whose stability is a function of incubation time. Formation of SDS-stable ACT·Aβ1–42complex is slow, like that of binary complex formation between serpins and exogenous peptides that bind in sA (15Schulze A.J. Baumann U. Knof S. Jaeger E. Huber R. Laurell C.-B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 16Björk I. Ylinenjarvi K. Olson S.T. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Slow rates of complex formation may also reflect slow structural isomerizations that are known to occur in Aβ peptides converting from their soluble form to the β-rich fibrillogenic form (28Soto C. Castaño E.M. Frangione B. Inestrosa N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3063-3067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), or the conversion of the ACT structure from the uncleaved, native conformation to the more stable Aβ1–42 strand-inserted conformation, which occurs in cleaved and proteinase-complexed serpins. The model for bimodal insertion of Aβ1–42 into ACT (Fig. 3), which was the hypothetical basis for the above experiments, is validated by these results. Our earlier observation that Aβ1–42 interaction with ACT stabilizes ACT to denaturation implied that Aβ1–42 is inserting into sA of ACT, a property already observed in several serpins. Our results here further confirm this interpretation by showing that ACT loses its inhibitor activity as a result of Aβ1–42binding to ACT, another property previously associated with the insertion of exogenous peptides into sA of inhibitory serpins. Our earlier observation that full-length Aβ1–42 is necessary for stabilization of ACT to denaturation is now also explained by the proposed model incorporating the second binding site for the Aβ2–9 segment of Aβ1–42 to sC of ACT. Bimodal insertion of Aβ1–42 into ACT suggested a possible explanation for the concentration-dependent effects of ACT on Aβ1–42 fibril formation and stability. ACT stimulates Aβ1–42 fibril formation (19Ma J. Yee A. Brewer Jr., B. Das S. Potter H. Nature. 1994; 372: 92-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 20Janciauskiene S. Eriksson S. Wright H.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 668-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) at relatively low molar ratios of ACT to Aβ1–40 or Aβ1–42, but at higher concentrations of ACT, preformed Aβ1–40 fibrils are destabilized and show signs of disintegration (21Fraser P.E. Nguyen J.T. McLachlan D.R. Abraham C.R. Kirschner D.A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 22Eriksson S. Janciauskiene S. Lannfelt L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2313-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We revisited this phenomenon by determining the dependence of Aβ1–42 polymerization on a broader range of ACT concentration than had been explored before. Using the thioflavin T fluorescence assay, we found that higher concentrations of ACT do not stimulate Aβ1–42 polymerization and that there appears to be a threshold ratio of ACT to Aβ1–42below which aggregate formation is stimulated (Fig. 4). Our earlier work and that of others (27Ma J. Brewer Jr., B. Potter H. Neurobiol. of Aging. 1996; 17: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) showed by electron microscopy that these aggregates are overwhelmingly fibrils. This threshold effect may be a consequence of a switch between intramolecular and dimeric and higher multiplicity intermolecular complexes of ACT with Aβ1–42. The intramolecular complex consisting of a single molecule of Aβ1–42 bound through its carboxyl and amino terminus in sA and sC, respectively, of a single molecule of ACT (Fig. 3) is more likely to occur at lower ACT concentrations. The closed ACT dimer circularly linked in complex by two molecules of Aβ1–42would not aggregate, whereas open, noncircular, head-to-tail complexes formed through binding of different Aβ1–42 molecules to multiple different ACT molecules, which is more likely at high relative ACT concentration, could immobilize Aβ1–42 in aggregates. We have shown here that Aβ1–42 binds into two different β-sheets of ACT. Binding to one of these β-sheets, sA, abolishes the inhibitor activity of ACT, transforming it into a substrate. We speculate that the promotion of Aβ1–42fibril formation by ACT in vitro is a result of the imposition of β-sheet conformation on both amino and carboxyl-terminal sequences of Aβ1–42 as a result of its binding to ACT. Fibrillar Aβ1–42 is predominantly in β conformation, but soluble, nonfibrillogenic Aβ1–42 at low concentrations appears to require a conformational isomerization to a more β-rich conformation to become fibrillogenic (28Soto C.

The conformational transition leading to polymerization may be the result of cooperative interactions among Aβ1–42 molecules at high concentration (30Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar) or could be provided by a chaperone, such as ACT, whose complex with Aβ1–42 we have modeled here. Our observation of a nonlinear dependence of Aβ1–42fibril formation on ACT suggests that the relative amounts of Aβ1–42 deposited in amorphous plaque or fibrils in Alzheimer's diseased brains may depend on fluctuating ratios of ACT and Aβ1–42. Elevated Aβ1–42 levels, which occur as a result of specific mutations in the amyloid precursor protein or of raised gene dosage as in Down's syndrome, correlate with early onset Alzheimer's disease (31Hardy J. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). In the case of late onset Alzheimer's disease, ACT levels, which rise during inflammation, may also be an important determinant of the neurotoxic fibril load in the brain and therefore be an important parameter in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2014558679,"We have analyzed interaction of coactivators with the wild-type estrogen receptor α (ER), HEG0, and a mutant, L536P-HEG0, which is constitutively active in several transiently transfected cells and a HeLa line that stably propagates an estrogen-sensitive reporter gene. Different classes of coactivators do not recognize the ER ligand binding domain (LBD) in the same manner. Steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1), amplified in breast cancer-1 (AIB-1), transcriptional intermediary factor-1 (TIF-1), transcriptional intermediary factor-2 (TIF-2), and receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140) interacted with HEG0 and L536P-HEG0 in the presence of estradiol, but generally not in the presence of anti-estrogens. However, ICI164,384 stimulated some interaction of RIP140 with LBDs. SRC-1, AIB-1, and RIP140 interacted constitutively with the L536P ER, whereas TIF-1 and TIF-2 interacted only weakly in the absence of hormone. Reciprocal competition for binding to the ER LBD was observed between different classes of coactivators. Moreover, coexpression of RIP140 blocked enhanced transactivation by HEG0 observed in the presence of TIF-2, suggesting that RIP140 may play a negative role in ER signaling. We conclude that constitutive activity of L536P-HEG0 is manifested to similar degrees in different cell types and likely arises from constitutive coactivator binding; different classes of coactivators recognize distinct but overlapping binding sites on the ER LBD. Finally, the observation that L536P-HEG0 interacted constitutively with AIB-1, a coactivator that has been implicated in ER signaling in breast and ovarian cancer, suggests that similar mutations in the ER may contribute to hormone-independent proliferation of breast and ovarian cells.

Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Similar to other nuclear receptors, the ER is a ligand-activated regulator of transcription that functions through stimulating formation of transcriptional preinitiation complexes. Preinitiation complexes include general transcription factors, RNA polymerase II, and multiple components of polymerase II holoenzyme (7Montminy M.

The ER stimulates the assembly of these components through interaction with factors collectively known as coactivators that interact with the receptor ligand binding domain (LBD) in the presence of hormone (11Horwitz K.B.

This interaction requires the AF-2 activating function, located at the extreme C terminus of the LBD. Different classes of coactivators have been identified, including SRC-1 and related proteins such as pCIP/AIB-1/RAC3 (12Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.

Schulman I.G. Jugulon H. Montminy M. Evans R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). CBP and SRC-1 have been shown to stimulate acetylation of histones, consistent with observations that transcriptional activators stimulate remodeling of chromatin, thus facilitating access of general transcription factors to initiation sites (24Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.I. Russanova V. Howard B. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar, 25Jenster G. Spencer T.E. Burcin M.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J.

Evidence is accumulating that suggests that different coactivators do not function in the same manner. CBP interacts with SRC-1 and related proteins, but not with coactivators of 140 kDa (13Kamei Y.

SRC-1, AIB-1, and TIF-2 stimulate hormone-dependent transactivation by nuclear receptors in transient transfection assays (12Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2044) Google Scholar, 15Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.-Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.-P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), whereas RIP140 and TIF-1 function weakly or not all under these conditions (19Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 21LeDouarin B. Nielson A.L. Garnier J.-M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). However, active templates in transient transfection assays may not require extensive chromatin remodeling and, thus, all of the components essential for preinitiation complex formation on endogenous genes. Indeed, a number of proteins likely to be required for chromatin remodeling have been shown to interact with members of the TIF-1 family (21LeDouarin B. Nielson A.L. Garnier J.-M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Given the evidence that different coactivators may function by distinct mechanisms, it is possible that recruitment of several coactivators to a target gene would stimulate preinitiation complex formation through multiple pathways. We were interested in analyzing the interaction of coactivators singly and in combination with the LBD of the ER. Using ligand binding domains from the wild-type receptor and a constitutively active ER mutant L536P (26Eng F.C.S. Lee H.S. Ferrara J. Wilson T.M. White J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4644-4653Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we found that, whereas different coactivators do not recognize the LBD in the same way, they do compete for interaction with the ER, indicating that they recognize distinct but overlapping binding sites. The estrogen-sensitive episomal reporter plasmid ERE3-TATA-CAT/EBV is identical to the previously described GRE5-CAT/EBV (27White J.H. McCuaig K.A. Mader S. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), except that the five glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) of GRE5-CAT/EBV were replaced by three consensus estrogen response elements (EREs) from the Xenopusvitellogenin gene. As described previously (27White J.H. McCuaig K.A. Mader S. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), vectors of this type carry a gene conferring resistance to hygromycin and replicate stably in HeLa cells in the presence of hygromycin. Plasmids encoding full-length SRC-1, mouse TIF-1 (residues 1–750), TIF-2 (residues 624–1287), and RIP-140 (residues 733–1158) were generous gifts of Pr. P. Chambon (Illkirch, France). A cDNA clone encoding AIB-1 was isolated from a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human fetal kidney library. The fragment of AIB-1 (residues 518–813) used in GST pull-down experiments contains three LXXLL signature motifs. Coactivator expression vectors were constructed by inserting cDNAs encoding full-length RIP140, full-length TIF-2 or AIB-1 (residues 513–813) in the expression vector pSG5. All cells were grown in 10 cm plates. Ishikawa and MCF-7 cells were propagated in α minimal essential medium plus 5 and 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. COS-7 and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa cells propagating the ERE3-TATA-CAT/EBV vector (HeLa/ERE3-EBV) were generated essentially as described (27White J.H. McCuaig K.A. Mader S. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected at 50% confluence with 15 μg of ERE3-TATA-CAT/EBV using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique. Medium was changed after 24 h, and 24 h later hygromycin was added to a final concentration of 250 μg/ml. Medium was changed every 48 h, and when all cells on control untransfected plates had been killed off, hygromycin-resistant cells were split and expanded in the presence of 100 μg/ml hygromycin. Transient transfections were performed by lipofection (COS-7) with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 50 ng of either HEG0/pSG5 or L536P-HEG0/pSG5 expression vectors, which encode the wild-type and mutant receptors, respectively, 250 ng of the reporter plasmid pXP-ERE3, and 500 ng of the internal control lacZexpression vector p610AZ. Alternatively, transfections were performed by calcium phosphate coprecipitation (Ishikawa, MCF-7, and HeLa) with 1 μg of either HEG0/pSG5 or L536P-HEG0/pSG5, 2 μg of ERE3-TATA-CAT/EBV reporter plasmid, and 2 μg of RSV-lacZas an internal control for transfection efficiency and 15 μg of Bluescript (Stratagene) carrier DNA. HeLa/ERE-EBV cells were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation with 1 μg of either HEG0/pSG5 or L536P-HEG0/pSG5, 2 μg of RSV-lacZ internal control, pSG5-based coactivator expression vectors added as indicated in the figures, and Bluescript carrier DNA to 20 μg. Prior to transfections, cells were grown in medium containing charcoal-stripped serum for 24 h. Medium was changed 24 h after transfection, and ligand was added (estradiol, 10 nm; hydroxytamoxifen and ICI164384, 100 nm) for 24 h. Cells were harvested, and luciferase or CAT activity was determined. CAT activity was determined using the solvent extraction method. Assays for β-galactosidase were performed as described (6Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Western analysis of ER expression levels in extracts of transiently transfected HeLa/ERE-EBV cells were performed as described (26Eng F.C.S. Lee H.S. Ferrara J. Wilson T.M. White J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4644-4653Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using the B10 anti-ER monoclonal antibody. GST-ER expression vectors were constructed by inserting fragments encoding the wild-type ER LBD (residues 270–595) or that of L536P-HEG0 (26Eng F.C.S. Lee H.S. Ferrara J. Wilson T.M. White J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4644-4653Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) into theEcoRI sites of pGEX2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-LBD fusion proteins were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. Briefly, bacteria expressing the GST fusion proteins were grown at 37 °C to an A 595 of 0.5. GST-ER expression was induced for 3 h at 30 °C with 0.5 misopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were centrifuged, and the bacterial pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 100 mg/ml lysozyme, and protease inhibitors) and lysed by sonication four times. Aliquots of cleared bacterial lysates were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and expression levels of fusion proteins were determined by Western analysis with anti-ER monoclonal antibody B220. Transcripts encoding SRC-1, AIB-1, TIF1, TIF2, and RIP140 were transcribed from the corresponding expression vectors with T7 or T3 RNA polymerase and translated in vitro with a TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Translation efficiency was determined by running 0.5 μl of the reaction on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. GST-ER fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by incubating 1 ml of crude bacterial extract with 200 μl of beads overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with GST buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) the amount of bound protein was determined by the Bradford method. Beads containing GST-ER fusion protein or GST alone were incubated within vitro translation products in the presence of vehicle or hormone at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were then washed three times with 800 μl of GST buffer, boiled for 2 min in 2 × SDS-polyacrylamide gel sample buffer and electrophoresed on an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were then fixed with 30% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid for 1 h, treated with EN3HANCE (DuPont) for 20 min, and vacuum-dried. Autoradiography was performed overnight. We have previously identified an ER carrying a point mutation in the LBD, L536P, located immediately N-terminal to the AF-2 activating domain (26Eng F.C.S. Lee H.S. Ferrara J. Wilson T.M. White J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4644-4653Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This mutation causes a conformational change in the LBD that partially mimics that induced by hormone and renders the receptor constitutively active when transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1 A). We were interested in determining whether L536P-HEG0 displayed comparable levels of constitutive activity in different cell types, particularly those expressing endogenous ER. The human endometrial and breast carcinoma cell lines Ishikawa and MCF-7, respectively, were transiently transfected with an estrogen-sensitive CAT reporter plasmid, ERE3-TATA-CAT, and an expression vector for either HEG0 or L536P-HEG0. In both Ishikawa and MCF-7 cells, expression of L536P-HEG0 gave rise to high levels of hormone-independent transactivation when compared with the wild-type receptor (Fig. 1, B and C). In both cases, transactivation in cells expressing ER expression vector was severalfold higher than that stimulated by the endogenous ER (data not shown). As expected, ER antagonists hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) and ICI164,384 did not stimulate transcription by HEG0 in either Ishikawa or MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1, B and C), and both OHT and ICI164,384 repressed the constitutive activity of L536P-HEG0 in these cells. Similar results to those presented in Fig. 1, Band C, were obtained in transiently transfected HeLa cells (data not shown). Given the evidence that coregulators can stimulate chromatin remodeling during preinitiation complex formation, it was of interest to determine whether L536P-HEG0 displayed similar levels of constitutive activity on a DNA template in stably transfected cells. Therefore, a stably transfected HeLa cell line was created by introduction of an ERE3-TATA-CAT cassette inserted in an EBV episomal vector to create (HeLa/ERE-EBV). Similar EBV vectors have been used successfully to stably propagate cloned cDNA sequences in HeLa cells (27White J.H. McCuaig K.A. Mader S. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 28Mader S. White J.H. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5603-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Since HeLa cells do not express significant levels of ER, the function of L536P-HEG0 could be monitored in HeLa/ERE3-EBV cells transiently transfected with a receptor expression vector. Under these conditions (Fig. 1D), L536P-HEG0 displayed high levels of constitutive activity, similar to that observed in transiently transfected COS-7, Ishikawa, MCF-7, and HeLa cells (Fig. 1, A–C, and data not shown). Thus, the constitutive activity of L536P-HEG0 is manifested in a variety of cell types on both transiently transfected and stably propagated DNA templates. The constitutive function of the L536P-HEG0 LBD was probed further by performing GST pull-down assays with GST fusion proteins composed of either the wild-type or L536P ligand binding domains and coactivators in vitro translated in the presence of [35S]methionine. All coactivators, SRC-1, AIB-1518–813, RIP140733–1158, and TIF-2624–1287, bound to the LBD of HEG0 in a hormone-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A–D). However, significant binding of TIF-1 to HEG0 was only seen with large amounts of in vitro translated protein (Fig. 2 E, lane 4). OHT did not stimulate coactivator binding to the HEG0 LBD (Fig. 2,A–E, lane 5). Significantly, however, whereas ICI164,384 had no effect on binding of SRC-1, AIB-1518–813, TIF-1, and TIF-2624–1287 to the receptor (Fig. 2, B–E, lane 6), it did stimulate some binding of RIP140 to the HEG0 LBD (Fig. 2 A, lane 6). The interaction of coactivators with the L536P-HEG0 LBD in the absence of ligand varied widely. SRC-1, AIB-1518–813, and RIP140733–1158 bound the mutant LBD to similar degrees in the presence and absence of estradiol, whereas only low levels of binding of TIF-1 and TIF-2624–1287 were observed in the absence of ligand (Fig. 2, A–E, lanes 7 and 8). Full-length AIB-1 also interacted constitutively with the L536P receptor (data not shown). It is noteworthy that TIF-2 and SRC-1 have similar domain structures and yet do not recognize the L536P-HEG0 LBD in the same way. In the presence of estradiol, TIF-1 bound L536P-HEG0 at significantly higher levels than to the wild-type receptor (Fig. 2 E, lane 8). Consistent with gene transfer experiments, OHT repressed coactivator binding to L536P-HEG0 (Fig. 2, A–E, lane 9). ICI164,384 repressed binding of SRC-1, AIB-1518–813, and TIF-2624–1287 and did not stimulate binding of TIF-1 to the L536P-HEG0 LBD (Fig. 2, B–E, lanes 10). However, similar to HEG0, the L536P-HEG0 LBD bound significant levels of RIP140733–1158 in the presence of ICI164,384 (Fig. 2 A, lane 10). Taken together, these results indicate that different coactivators do not recognize the ligand binding domain of the ER in the same manner. The capacity of RIP140, SRC-1, AIB-1 and TIF-2 to modulate basal and hormone-stimulated transactivation by the wild-type ER and L536P-HEG0 on a stably propagated episomal template was analyzed by transient transfection of receptor expression vectors with expression vectors encoding full-length coactivator cDNAs in HeLa/ERE3-EBV cells. Cotransfection of increasing amounts of a RIP140 expression vector had no or only a minor stimulatory effect on expression of luciferase activity in the presence of either HEG0 or L536P-HEG0, but inhibited both basal and hormone-stimulated transactivation at high concentrations (Fig. 3, A and B). These results suggest that potential chromatin remodeling activity of RIP140 is not revealed by transfection of cells carrying stably propagated reporter genes. SRC-1 stimulated basal and hormone-stimulated activation by both wild-type and mutant receptors 2–3-fold (Fig. 3, C and D). Similar, although somewhat more modest, effects were observed with full-length AIB-1 (Fig. 3, E and F). Cotransfection of TIF-2 strongly stimulated both hormone-independent and hormone-dependent transactivation by the wild-type ER at the highest levels of expression vector tested (Fig. 3 G). TIF-2 had a somewhat more modest effect on hormone-dependent activation by L536P-HEG0, although at lower concentrations, and stimulated activation only weakly in the absence of hormone (Fig. 3, G and H). Control Western analyses of transiently transfected cell extracts used in Fig. 3 showed that ER levels did not vary significantly when coexpressed with coactivators. Thus, altered levels of transactivation by the wild-type and L536P ERs observed in the presence of coexpressed coactivators were not due to effects of coactivators on expression of the ER (Fig. 4). Taken together, the results of Figs. 2 and 3 suggest that the activity of L536P-HEG0 in the absence of hormone is manifested, at least in part, by its constitutive interaction with the widely expressed coactivator AIB-1 and/or other members of the SRC-1 family. Given the differential interaction of heterologous coactivators with the ER ligand binding domain, it was of interest to determine whether multiple coactivators competed with each other for binding to the receptor. Competition assays were set up where interaction of coactivators SRC-1, AIB-1, TIF-2, and RIP140 was analyzed in the presence of limiting quantities of GST-HEG0 LBD. This was determined by serial dilution of GST-HEG0 LBD beads with GST beads. Thus, serial dilution of 10 μl of GST-HEG0 LBD beads (2.5 μg of protein) with GST beads led to reduced binding of in vitrotranslated SRC-1, AIB-1, RIP140, or TIF-2 in the presence of estradiol (data not shown). Based on these experiments, 64-fold dilutions of GST-HEG0 (0.039 μg of GST-HEG0) were used in reciprocal competition experiments for binding of RIP140, AIB-1, TIF-2, and SRC-1 to the HEG0 LBD. Competition assays were performed using 0.5 μl of in vitrotranslated coactivator, and increasing volumes (1 to 20 μl) of competitor in vitro translated coactivator, such that competitor was present in up to 40-fold excess. Under these conditions, RIP140733–1158 and SRC-1 competed with each other for binding to the ER LBD (Fig. 5,A and B). In a separate control experiment, 20 μl of control in vitrotranslation extract expressing LacZ had no effect on binding of RIP140733–1158 or SRC-1 to the ER LBD (Fig. 5,A and B, lanes 11 and 12), thus indicating that the observed competition between RIP140733–1158 and SRC-1 was specific. Reciprocal competition was also observed between RIP140733–1158 and TIF-2624–1287 (Fig. 5, C and D). In another set of experiments, increasing amounts of AIB-1518–813 competed for binding of RIP140733–1158 (Fig. 6 A), SRC-1 (Fig. 6 C), and TIF-2624–1287 (Fig. 6 E) to the ER LBD. Whereas RIP140733–1158 competed for binding of AIB-1518–813 (Fig. 6 B), SRC-1 (Fig. 6 D) or TIF-2624–1287 (Fig. 6 F) competed only weakly. Reciprocal competition between coactivators suggests that they have similar affinities for the ER LBD in these experiments. We also found that, whereas heterologous coactivators disrupted interaction of TIF-1 with the ER LBD, TIF-1 did not compete for their binding (data not shown). This is consistent with the observation that high levels of TIF-1 were required to observe significant interaction with the HEG0 LBD (Fig. 2). In summary, whereas our data indicate that different classes of coactivators do not bind to the receptor in the same manner, the results of competition assays suggest that SRC-1, AIB-1, RIP140, TIF-1, and TIF-2 recognize overlapping binding sites on the ER LBD.Figure 6Competitive binding of AIB-1 to the ER LBD. GST pull-down experiments were performed by incubating 0.5 μl of in vitro translated RIP140733–1158(A), SRC-1 (C), TIF-2624–1287(E), or AIB-1513–813 (B, D, and F) with increasing amounts of in vitro translated AIB-1513–813 (A, C, and E), RIP140733–1158(B), SRC-1 (D), or TIF-2624–1287(F) as indicated. In vitro translation products are shown in lanes 1 and 13 (A) orlanes 1 and 5 (B–F), and pull-down experiments performed with GST control beads (GEX) are provided in lanes 2 and 5 (A) or 2 and 6 (B–F). In lanes 8 (A) or9 (B–F) control competition experiments were performed by adding 20 μl of an in vitro translation extract programmed with lacZ instead of competing competitor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results of Figs. 5 and 6 suggest that coactivators may compete for binding to the ER in vivo. We examined the potential of RIP140 to compete for stimulation of ER-dependent transactivation by TIF-2 in HeLa-ERE3/EBV cells. Consistent with results described above (Fig. 3), TIF-2 expressed from high levels of transfected expression vector (5,000 ng) stimulated basal and hormone-stimulated transcription by HEG0 (Fig. 7). In contrast, cotransfection of 500 ng of RIP140 expression vector with 500 ng of HEG0 led to a modest inhibition of hormone-dependent transactivation by the ER. Stronger inhibitory effects were observed in the presence of higher concentrations of cotransfected RIP140 (data not shown). Moreover, addition of 500 ng of RIP140 expression vector completely abolished the stimulatory effect on ER-dependent transactivation of cotransfection of 5,000 ng of TIF-2 expression vector (Fig. 7). These results support the notion that coactivators may compete with each other in vivo (Figs. 5 and 6) and raise the possibility that RIP140 may serve a negative regulatory function. Growing evidence supports the notion that coactivators would influence transcriptional initiation by different mechanisms by recruiting distinct sets of factors to preinitiation complexes. For example, CBP interacts selectively with coactivators of the SRC-1 family (13Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R. Rose D.W. Glass C.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). SRC-1, AIB-1, and TIF-2 stimulate hormone-dependent transactivation by nuclear receptors in transient transfection assays, whereas RIP140 and TIF-1 function poorly or not all in these experiments (12Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2044) Google Scholar, 18Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Zechel C. Chambon P.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). This suggests that the final composition of preinitiation complexes may depend on the composition of coactivators present in a given cell. Our experiments indicate that an excess of one coactivator can compete for the binding of heterologous coactivators to the ER ligand binding domain in vitro. These experiments cannot rule out the possibility that coactivators present at similar concentrations may occupy simultaneously each of the LBDs of a DNA-bound ER homodimer. However, our results strongly suggest that interaction with the ER LBD is not stabilized by heterodimerization between different classes of coactivators, as no evidence was found that binding of a given coactivator to the ER LBD was enhanced by addition of a heterologous coactivator. The observation that expression of RIP140 blocked the stimulatory effect of TIF-2 on ER function (Fig. 7) is consistent with GST pull-down assays performed with the receptor LBD and supported the notion that different classes of coactivators can modulate ER function in a competitive manner in vivo. These results are significant because TIF-2 has been shown to function by interacting with CBP, whereas RIP140 apparently does not (29Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). These results suggest that RIP140 may exert a negative regulatory effect on ER function under some conditions. We cannot rule out the possibility that the inhibitory effect of RIP140 may be due to squelching via indirect competition for basal transcription factors. However, it is important to note that, over the course of several experiments, cotransfection of increasing amounts of RIP140 expression vector up to 5,000 ng had no effect of expression of β-galactosidase activity from a heterologous promoter (data not shown). This suggests that the inhibitory effects of RIP140 are specific to the ERE-containing promoter in these experiments. We conclude that different classes of coactivators recognize distinct but overlapping portions of the ER LBD. SRC-1, AIB-1, and RIP140 bound constitutively to the ER mutant L536P-HEG0, whereas TIF-2 and TIF-1 bound weakly in the absence of hormone (Fig. 3). Unlike other coactivators, TIF-1 bound to L536P-HEG0 in the presence of hormone at higher levels than to the wild-type ER LBD. In addition, RIP140, but not other coactivators, interacted with the wild-type ER LBD in the presence of the anti-estrogen ICI164,384, raising the possibility that, if RIP140 can function as an activator of ER-dependent transactivation, ICI164,384 may act like an estrogen agonist under specific conditions. These results are intriguing because they indicate that it is possible to design estrogenic compounds that would stimulate binding of specific coactivators or subsets of coactivators to the ER ligand binding domain and, thus, stimulate transactivation by the ER under specific metabolic conditions or in specific cell types. It will be important to fully characterize the different classes of coactivators expressed in specific estrogen target organs such as breast, endometrium, bone, and brain so as to understand better the molecular basis of the action of synthetic estrogenic or anti-estrogenic compounds. Recently, it was found that expression of the coactivator AIB-1, which is related to SRC-1, was elevated in a number of hormone-dependent breast and ovarian cancer cell lines (15Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.-Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.-P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar). The results suggested that AIB-1 (and other members of the SRC-1 family) is an important downstream component of ER-dependent signal transduction pathways and may mediate some of the mitogenic effects of estrogen in these cells. Significantly, we found that L536P-HEG0 functions constitutively in transiently transfected ER-positive MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, which express high levels of AIB-1 (15Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.-Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.-P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar). Moreover, the L536P-HEG0 LBD interacts constitutively with AIB-1 in vitro, and cotransfection of AIB-1 can stimulate basal transactivation by L536P-HEG0. These results suggest that mutations in the ER that cause hormone-independent binding of AIB-1 or other SRC-1 family members would lead to estrogen-independent proliferation of breast and ovarian tumors. This effect would be further enhanced in cells overexpressing AIB-1 or related coactivators. It is noteworthy that a mutation immediately adjacent to L536P, Y537N, which also confers constitutive activity on the ER, was recently identified in a metastatic breast tumor (30Zhang Q.X. Borg A. Wolf D.M. Oesterreich S. Fuqua S.A.W. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1244-1249PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that different classes of coactivators can compete for binding to the ER ligand binding domain by recognizing distinct but overlapping regions of the LBD. We have shown that AIB-1 and SRC-1 interact constitutively with the LBD of the ER mutant L536P, consistent with the notion that acquisition of such mutations in the ER LBD in vivo would enhance hormone-independent proliferation of breast and ovarian tumors.

To clarify the membrane topogenesis of this multispanning protein on the endoplasmic reticulum, the topogenic functions of the anticipated transmembrane segments were individually assessed in an in vitro system using two series of model proteins in which each segment was placed in either a “stop-transfer” context or a “translocation initiation” context. They were expressed in a cell-free system containing rough microsomal membranes, and their topologies were evaluated by taking advantage of either sensitivity to protease or accessibility toN-glycosylation. We found that some segments seem to possess insufficient topogenic functions for membrane integration: the second transmembrane segment (TM2) is insufficient for the stop-transfer sequence, and TM3, TM5, and TM7 are not sufficient for the translocation initiation. In contrast to these phenomena, we herein demonstrate that TM2 shows an efficient stop-transfer function when it is near the preceding TM1 and suggest that TM3, TM5, and TM7 are followed by TM segments with a strong topogenic function to form Nexo/Ccyt topology, via which the preceding segments are integrated into the membrane. From these results, we propose that the interactions between the TMs should be operative during membrane integration, and that the segments with a weak topogenic function are given a transmembrane orientation by their following TMs. Band 3 protein is a typical multispanning membrane protein whose membrane topology has been extensively studied from various protein chemical approaches.

Membrane proteins on the secretory pathway in eucaryotic cells are integrated into the membrane at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 and acquire their final membrane topology. Almost all the membrane proteins are integrated into the membrane during protein synthesis. Several sequences of their nascent polypeptide chains (the so-called “topogenic sequences”) regulate the cotranslational insertion to define the final membrane topology (1Sakaguchi M. Hamasaki N.

Signal sequences are responsible for ER targeting and for initiating the translocation. The signal sequences have been classified into three classes consisting of a signal peptide and two signal-anchor sequences (type I and type II signal-anchor sequences (SA-I and SA-II), respectively; Refs. 2Sakaguchi M. von Heijne G.

Signal peptide is processed by signal peptidase, whereas SA-II is not cleaved to become a membrane-anchoring segment. In contrast, SA-I mediates the translocation of its amino-terminal portion and leaves the following portion on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. All three signal sequences emerging from the ribosomes are recognized by the signal recognition particle and target the ribosomes to the ER membrane. The signal sequences are released from the signal recognition particle by signal recognition particle receptor and then enter into the protein translocation channel in the ER membrane forming loop structure. The stop-transfer sequence (St) is a hydrophobic segment that interrupts the ongoing protein translocation initiated by signal peptide and SA-II (5Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biol.

The cotranslational integration of the membrane proteins is mediated by the protein translocation channel (or the so-called translocon) consisting of the Sec61p complex and translocating chain-associated membrane protein (TRAM) (7High S.

Although the topogenic functions of these sequences in simple single spanning membrane proteins have been established, their contribution to the membrane topogenesis of multispanning proteins remains to be clarified. According to a hypothesis that has been widely accepted (9Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,10Matlack K.E. Mothes W.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar); after the synthesis of cytoplasmic domain, the following transmembrane segment (TM) initiates the translocation of the following portion (internal SA-II), and the next transmembrane segment is supposed to stop the ongoing translocation (St; Ref. 9Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This model, however, is not always applicable; in some contexts, certain transmembrane segments are left outside the membrane (12Zhang J.-T. Chen M. Han E. Wang C. Mol. Biol.

In this study, we aim to clarify the topogenic functions of individual TMs of a multispanning membrane protein, band 3. Band 3 is a major multispanning membrane protein in erythrocytes, and its topology has been extensively studied from various approaches (16Hamasaki N. Okubo K. Kuma H. Kang D. Yae Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,17Tanner M.J.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1997; 14: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). It consists of two domains: (a) an amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain of about 400 amino acid residues that bind to the cytoskeleton to regulate the cell shape of the erythrocytes, and (b) the carboxyl-terminal half, which is a transmembrane domain responsible for the anion-exchanging activity. A current model of the membrane topology of human band 3 deduces 14 TMs (Fig. 1; Ref. 18Wood P.G. Prog. Cell Res. 1992; 2: 325-352Crossref Google Scholar). We herein elucidate the topogenic functions of each TM and demonstrate that those of individual TMs are not always high enough to explain the integration process. We also suggest that several TMs in the stop-transfer context possess the potential of internal SA-I, which mediates the insertion of the preceding segment into the membrane. Using each set of the primers, each DNA fragment encoding TM was amplified and digested with EcoRI and XhoI, whose sites were included in the PCR primers. In cases in which the TM is adjacent to cytoplasmic (Fig. 1, C) and extracellular (Fig. 1, E) loops of more than 5 amino acid residues, either of them was included in the amplified sequence. These TMs are designated according to their numerical order and the flanking loops included (Fig. 1; e.g. E8 corresponds to TM8 (M664-T685) including the preceding extracellular loop, Q625-M663). The DNA fragments encoding preprolactin (NcoI/EcoRI), the TM fragment being assessed (EcoRI/XhoI), and mature prolactin (XhoI/XbaI) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, digested with the enzymes, and then sequentially ligated on pCITE2b (NcoI/XbaI) to yield constructs for the stop-transfer assay (Fig. 2 A). The amino-terminal preprolactin of these constructs was replaced with the H1 segment including an N-glycosylation consensus site (NcoI/EcoRI) to obtain the constructs for the translocation initiation assay (Fig. 3 A).Figure 3Assay for the translocation initiation function. A, the model protein for the systematic assessment of the translocation initiation function. The Nexo/Ccyt SA-I of Escherichia colileader peptidase (H1) preceding the domain with theN-glycosylation site, TMs, and the prolactin (PL) were sequentially arranged. B, the expected membrane topology of the model proteins. Membrane-targeted protein was glycosylated at the amino-terminal domain. When the inserted TM shows an internal SA-II function, the PL domain is translocated into the lumenal side, where it is resistant to externally added proteinase K (ProK). When it does not function, the molecule remains outside of the membrane and is degraded by the protease. C, typical results using TM9 (C9; Thr685-Pro722), TM10 (10C; Trp723-Val756), and TM9–10 (Thr685-Val756). The model proteins were expressed in vitro in the absence (−) or presence (+) of RM. Aliquots were treated with proteinase K (PK+). The glycosylated form (d, indicated by dots) indicates the ER targeting of the molecule. The translocated domain gave a truncated form (c) after proteinase K digestion. Both forms were quantitated by image analysis, and the translocation initiation efficiency was calculated by the formula [(c) ×k −1/(d)] × 100. k is the proteinase K protection efficiency of the translocated mature prolactin by the membrane that had been estimated by our experimental conditions using the following formula k = (mature PL after proteinase K treatment)/(mature PL before proteinase K treatment). The number of methionines in each protected form was compensated. D, the results of quantitation from the data from the translocation initiation assay.

TM1 (Thr375-Leu427,NcoI/XhoI), mature prolactin fragmentSalI/MunI, TM2 (Gly428-Gln457,EcoRI/XhoI), and mature prolactin fragmentXhoI/XbaI were sequentially ligated to yield pTM1-200-2-P. In all of these constructs, Thr375 was mutated to create the NcoI site. To monitor the translocation, the reporter of prolactin was mutated to include theN-glycosylation site by point mutagenesis (T90N). The glycosylated loop of band 3 (Asp626-Trp662,NcoI/EcoRI), inserted fragment (EcoRI/XhoI), and mature prolactin (XhoI/XbaI) were sequentially ligated into pCITE2b (NcoI/XbaI). The Asp626residue was changed to create an initiation codon and theNcoI site. In these cases, both the flanking cytoplasmic and extracellular loops were included in the inserted TMs (TM1 (Ala400-Gly436), TM4 (Phe478-Arg518), TM6 (Leu540-Arg603), and TM8 (Gln625-Gly701)). Both in vitro transcription and a topology assay were carried out as described previously (19Sakaguchi M. Hachiya N. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Plasmids were linearized byScaI and then transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase. The RNAs were translated in reticulocyte lysate in either the absence or presence of rough microsomal membranes (RM). After translation, the aliquots were treated with proteinase K (200 μg/ml) and/or endoglycosidase H. The major objective of this study was to examine whether or not the anticipated TMs of band 3 function individually during the cotranslational integration process. To this end, each TM with either an extracellular or a cytoplasmic loop was positioned in either the St or the internal SA-II context as described below. Four loops (L2, L9, L11, and L13) consisting of less than 5 residues were not examined. The assessment of a stop-transfer function was carried out essentially as described by Kuroiwa et al. (5Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9251-9255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using systematically constructed model proteins (Fig. 2 A). Translocation was initiated by the amino-terminal signal peptide. If the inserted TM shows the St function, then the carboxyl-terminal half is exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, where the carboxyl-terminal PL domain is sensitive to externally added proteinase K (Fig. 2 B). If the inserted TM does not show the St function, the nascent polypeptide should be translocated into the lumenal space, where it becomes fully resistant to the externally added protease (Fig. 2 B). Typical results of the assay are shown (Fig. 2 C). When the model proteins were synthesized in the absence of RM, single bands were observed with the expected molecular weight (lanes 1, 4, and 7). When synthesized in the presence of RM, they were processed into mature forms (lanes 2, 5, and 8). After proteinase K treatment, truncated fragments (a) were newly observed in addition to the mature forms (b;lanes 3, 6, and 9, dots). Both of the membrane-protected forms were degraded by proteinase K treatment in the presence of detergent (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 C, TM2, which is supposed to be in the St context in the topological model, showed an insufficient stop-transfer function (only 40%), and TM3 did not show this function at all. Even when the segment being assessed included both TMs (TM2–3), it showed a low stop-transfer function, similar to that of TM2 (44%). The variety of the stop-transfer function was observed (Fig. 2 D). TM2, TM3, TM9–10, and TM14 had an insufficient St function. This observation is inconsistent with the simple model of membrane topogenesis. To assess the internal SA-II function of the anticipated TMs, we constructed another series of model proteins (Fig. 3 A). The H1 segment translocated the amino-terminal domain, which is glycosylated in the ER lumen (13Gafvelin G. Sakaguchi M. Andersson H. von Heijne G. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). If the inserted TM initiates the translocation of the following domain, then the carboxyl-terminal PL domain becomes proteinase K resistant (Fig. 3 B). The typical results of the assay are shown (Fig. 3 C). When the model proteins were expressed in the absence of RM, single bands with the expected molecular weight were observed (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1, 4, and 7). Upon being synthesized in the presence of RM, higher molecular weight bands were observed (d-form; lanes 2, 5, and 8). The extent of this glycosylated form indicates the membrane insertion of the H1 portion. After the proteinase K treatment, substantial amounts of truncated forms were protected (c-form; lanes 3, 6, and 9). The variety of internal SA-II function was observed (Fig. 3 D). Odd-numbered segments TM3, TM5, TM7, and TM11, which were supposed to be an internal SA-II, showed an insufficient function of internal SA-II, thus suggesting that these segments are integrated into the membrane by a mechanism that differs from the conventional one. It is highly likely that TM11 should be a stop-transfer sequence as described below and also as suggested previously (21Popov M. Tam L.Y. Li J. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18325-18332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The results of Fig. 3 C clearly demonstrate that the combined segment TM9–10 should be a better internal SA-II than TM9 alone. TM10 alone did not initiate translocation at all. It is also concluded that TM10 did not interfere with the translocation initiated by TM9 but even enhances the SA-II function of TM9. Because TM9–10 were not interrupted by any charged residues, we thus reasoned that the two TMs functioned as a single topogenic unit of an internal SA-II (Fig. 6). TM2 and even the TM2–3 segment seemed to be insufficient for the stop-transfer sequence when they were assessed in the model constructs in which those were separated 200 residues from the amino-terminal signal peptide (Fig. 2). We then examined the topogenic properties of the amino-terminal TMs in the original context using three fusion constructs (Fig. 4 A). When synthesized in the absence of RM, they gave single bands (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1, 6, and 11). The lower molecular weight (M r 25,000) bands in lanes 1 and 2 are most likely the results of an irregular translation initiation. When translated in the presence of RM, TM1 fusion gave a higher molecular weight form (lane 2). This band disappeared upon endoglycosidase H treatment (lane 5). The lower molecular weight band in lane 5 is the deglycosylated form of processed mature prolactin. Upon proteinase K treatment, a substantial quantity of the prolactin domains was resistant (lane 3), whereas these bands were completely degraded by treatment in the presence of detergent (lane 4). In contrast, the other two constructs with TM1–2 and TM1–3 were hardly glycosylated, if at all (lanes 7 and 12), and were almost completely degraded by proteinase K treatment (lanes 8 and 13). These data indicate that TM1 efficiently translocated the following prolactin domain, whereas TM2 interrupted the translocation under the original context. Furthermore, it was suggested that TM3 possesses no internal SA-II function. This observation seems to be inconsistent with the finding from the previous systematic assay that TM2 is an insufficient St (Fig. 2; 42% stop-transfer function). A difference between these two assays was seen regarding the length of loop between the topogenic sequences, which were separated by 200 amino acid residues in the former assay (Fig. 2 A), whereas only a few residues exist between TM1 and TM2, as in the original context of band 3 (Fig. 1). We thus reasoned that the length between the signal sequence and TM2 is critical for the topogenic process. To test this hypothesis, we introduced a spacer of 200 residues in length between TM1 and TM2 (Fig. 4 A, TM1-200-2). As expected, N-glycosylation efficiency was greatly improved (three times) in comparison with that of the TM1–2 construct (Fig. 4 B, lanes 7 versus 17), and a substantial amount of the product was resistant to the externally added proteinase K (lane 18), thus indicating that TM2 was readily translocated through the membrane in this context. It is thus clear that TM2 shows a more efficient stop-transfer function when the preceding signal-anchor sequence of TM1 is closely positioned than it does when separated far from it. The observations described above suggest that TM3, TM5, and TM7 are integrated into the membrane via a novel mode that differs from the conventional model. We hypothesized that the following TMs (TM4, TM6, and TM8) might possess an internal SA-I function by which their preceding segments could be integrated into the membrane. To test this possibility, we examined which orientation (Nexo/Ccyt or Ncyt/Cexo) is favored by these segments using model proteins (Fig. 5 A). If the segment shows the SA-I function, the amino-terminal portion is translocated and glycosylated (Fig. 5 B). If it shows the SA-II function, then the prolactin domain is translocated and becomes proteinase K resistant (Fig. 5 B). When synthesized in the presence of RM, the constructs with TM4, TM6, and TM8 were glycosylated (Fig. 5 C, dots). In contrast, the construct with TM1 was only slightly glycosylated, if at all. When treated by proteinase K after the translation, the TM1 construct gave a substantial amount of the proteinase K-resistant band (Fig. 5 C, lane 12), whereas the others were degraded by proteinase K (lanes 3, 6, and 9). As shown in Fig. 5 D, the three segments, TM4, TM6, and TM8, showed a SA-I tendency rather than a SA-II one. In contrast, TM1 showed an efficient SA-II function. Each anticipated TM of human band 3 is assessed for the topogenic functions of internal SA-II and St, which are postulated to be responsible for the topogenesis of the multispanning membrane proteins. We found TMs to possess unequal topogenic functions. Several segments showed either insufficient or no supposed topogenic functions. The stop-transfer function of TM2 is affected by the distance from the preceding TM1. Some segments could not show the supposed internal SA-II function, but those were followed by highly hydrophobic segments with ade novo Nexo/Ccyt topogenic function. These facts could not be explained by the conventional model. TM2 partially interrupts the ongoing translocation (only 40%) when it is placed 200 residues away from the preceding signal peptide (Fig. 2). In contrast to this fact, the stop-transfer action of TM2 improved when it was located near the TM1 segment, as in the case of the original band 3 molecule (Fig. 4). This result demonstrated that the stop-transfer action of the segment depends on its location. When the connecting loop is long, the preceding segment should be allowed to exit from the protein translocation channel (22Mothes W. Heinrich S.U. Graf R. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Brunner J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). If the loop becomes shorter, the signal-anchor sequence should still be in the translocation channel. The existence of the preceding hydrophobic segment within the translocon would affect the translocation of the following portion; the presence of the preceding segment may affect the character of the translocon, or the two segments may directly interact with each other, so that translocation of the latter segment would easily stop within the translocon. Under such a context, the segment with a lower hydrophobicity can thus be integrated into the membrane. A protein chemical analysis has already demonstrated that segments TM1 to TM3 of band 3 are stabilized in the membrane via an interaction between the peptide segments but not via protein-lipid interaction, because these segments were readily extracted from the erythrocyte membrane by alkali denaturation and subsequent protease treatment (16Hamasaki N. Okubo K. Kuma H. Kang D. Yae Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These alkali-extractable transmembrane segments should be surrounded by other transmembrane segments that interact directly with the membrane lipids. This fact supports the idea that a direct interaction between TM1 and TM2 exists during the membrane insertion step. These segments are likely to be assembled within the translocon and are released into the hydrophobic environment as pointed out by Borel and Simon (23Borel A.C. Simon S.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The structure requirements that define such interaction are now under investigation. Although the odd-numbered TMs of band 3 molecule have been supposed to possess an internal SA-II function that mediates the translocation of their following portion, TM3 and TM5 showed an unexpectedly weak internal SA-II function (Fig. 3). TM3 did not mediate the translocation of the reporter, even in the original context (Fig. 4). Despite these observations, the third loop connecting TM3 and TM4 was demonstrated to be in the lumenal space of the ER, because the glycosylated loop inserted between TM3 and TM4 was efficiently glycosylated (21Popov M. Tam L.Y. Li J. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18325-18332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The loop connecting TM5 and TM6 has also been found in the lumen (21Popov M. Tam L.Y. Li J. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18325-18332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To explain these discrepancies, we hypothesized that TM4 and TM6 should be an internal SA-I that possesses a Nexo/Ccytorientation and promotes the integration of TM3 and TM5, respectively. Our results indicated this to be the case. Thus, it is strongly suggested that the odd-numbered segments (TM3, TM5, and TM7), which possess either no or low topogenic function, are integrated by the SA-I function of their following segments. Consistent with the consideration above, Tam et al. (24Tam L.Y. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32542-32550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that TM7 possesses partial SA-II activity, whereas the translocation of the loop between TM7 and TM8 was improved by the presence of TM8 (24Tam L.Y. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32542-32550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation supports our proposal that SA-I activity of TM8 contributes correct integration of its preceding region. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that fragments of band 3 membrane domain (e.g. TM9–14, TM8–14, and TM13–14) were correctly integrated into the membrane, indicating that there are unique topogenic sequences in these fragments (25Wang L. Groves J.D. Mawby W.J. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10631-10638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the case of the TM8–14 construct, the amino-terminal TM8 should be correctly inserted in a SA-I orientation. In the case of triple-spanning coronavirus M protein, each transmembrane segment was demonstrated to possess its intrinsic preferred orientation (27Locker J.K. Rose J.K. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21911-21918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino-terminal TM1 of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator was inserted into the membrane depending on the following TM2 (28Lu Y. Xiong X. Helm A. Kimani K. Bragin A. Skach W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 568-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Pairing of two transmembrane segments in the H+-ATPase was suggested to be essential for integration into the microsomal membrane (29Lin J. Addison R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6935-6941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These findings also suggested that the transmembrane segment can contribute membrane insertion of their preceding segment. We assessed the translocation initiation function of TM4, TM6, and TM8 in two different contexts (Figs. 3 A and 5 A). In the former construct, the loop connecting the H1 and the segment to be assessed was only 40 residues long, which is too short to allow the segments to form SA-I topology. In such a context, the presence of H1 itself dictates that the following TM cannot be inserted in a SA-I orientation. On the other hand, when they were placed near the N terminus, as in the latter case (Fig. 5 A), they showed a strong SA-I function. In the original context of band 3 molecule, their preceding sequences including the TMs (TM3 and TM5) were sufficiently long and should be integration competent (as the glycosylated loop connecting TM7 and TM8). Thus, it is highly likely that in the original context of band 3, the even-numbered TMs mediate the integration of their preceding TMs. The segment including both TM9 and TM10 was suggested to form one topogenic unit as SA-II. This conclusion is consistent with the report that the loop connecting these segments is on the lumenal side of the membrane at least during the process of biosynthesis (Fig. 6; Ref. 21Popov M. Tam L.Y. Li J. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18325-18332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, TM11 is most likely a stop-transfer sequence. TM12 was demonstrated to be left outside of the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (21Popov M. Tam L.Y. Li J. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18325-18332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), whereas our observations suggested TM12 to be a highly functional internal SA-II sequence. This discrepancy remains to be clarified. Based on the abovementioned findings, we propose the following model of the topogenic process for band 3 (Fig. 6). TM1 is a SA-II that is responsible for ER targeting and for initiating the translocation of the following portion. TM2 interrupts the translocation by interacting with the closely positioned TM1. TM3, which has a weak topogenic function and low hydrophobicity, is integrated by the internal SA-I function of the following TM4. TM5 is also likely to be integrated by the SA-I function of TM6. TM7 has a moderate (but not sufficiently high) internal SA-II action to translocate the long hydrophilic loop with the N-glycosylation site. TM8 stops the translocation initiated by TM7 and also mediates the translocation of the glycosylated loop that had not been inserted by TM7. In this connection, the membrane topology in the TM7-loop-TM8 region is established by both the function of internal SA-I of TM8 and that of internal SA-II of TM7. TM9–10 functions as a single unit of internal SA-II as a whole. TM11 and/or TM12 is a stop-transfer segment. Some part of this segment may be left out of the hydrophobic core of the membrane."

Recently, we obtained data suggesting that invasive skin cancer and its precursors derive from one original neoplastic clone. Here, the analysis were extended by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis in the chromosome 9q22.3 region. A total of 85 samples, taken from twenty-two sections of sun-exposed sites, corresponding to normal epidermis, morphological normal cells with positive immuno-staining for the p53 protein (p53 patches), dysplasias, cancer in situ (CIS) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the skin were analysed. Overall, about 70% of p53 patches had mutations in the p53 gene but not LOH in the p53 gene or 9q22.3 region. Approximately 70% of the dysplasias showed p53 mutations of which about 40% had LOH in the p53 region but not in the 9q22.3 region. In contrast, about 65% of SCC and CIS displayed LOH in the 9q22.3 region, as well as frequent (80%) mutations and/or LOH in the p53 gene. These findings strongly suggest that alterations in the p53 gene is an early event in the progression towards SCC, whereas malignant development involves LOH and alterations in at least one (or several) tumor suppressor genes located in chromosome 9q22.3."
https://openalex.org/W1987530265,"The t(15;17) rearrangement found in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) yields a fusion transcript, PML/RAR alpha. PML/RAR alpha expression is linked to leukemogenesis and to clinical sensitivity to all-trans retinoic acid (RA). Paradoxically, RA treatment causes transient complete remissions in most t(15;17) APL cases. The precise roles of PML/RAR alpha in triggering leukemia or in causing a maturation block are not yet known. This study explores directly these PML/RAR alpha functions in the growth and differentiation of APL cells using a hammerhead ribozyme to target PML/RAR alpha mRNA in the NB4 APL cell line. When the PML/RAR alpha cleaving but not the non-catalytic control ribozyme is introduced into the NB4 APL cell line, PML/RAR alpha protein expression is reduced. This catalysis signals growth suppression, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis without overcoming the maturation block found in these leukemic cells. These biologic effects depend on the selective pressure used to express the ribozyme from an episomal vector. Introduction of a non-catalytic, control ribozyme into NB4 cells caused no observed phenotype due to anti-sense activities. Expression of the catalytic or non-catalytic ribozymes in control cells lacking PML/RAR alpha mRNA yielded no apparent growth or differentiation effects. Thus, use of a hammerhead ribozyme that targets PML/RAR alpha expression in APL cells reveals the anti-apoptotic function of this translocation product and demonstrates that PML/RAR alpha cleavage is insufficient to overcome the differentiation block observed in these leukemic cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that persistent PML/RAR alpha expression is required to maintain basal leukemic cell growth and point to the therapeutic potential of targeting PML/RAR alpha in APL."

By transient transfection analysis, we identified three regions in the 5′-flanking region of the rat DBP gene, segments F-2, B, and A, that contain tissue-specific transcriptional determinants. Gel mobility shift and DNase I footprinting analyses showed that all three regions contained binding sites for the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1), a transcriptional regulator composed of HNF1α and HNF1β hetero- and homodimers. The activity of the most proximal segment A (coordinates −141 to −43) was DBP promoter-specific, position-dependent, and positively controlled by HNF1α. In contrast, the two more distal determinants (segments F-2 and B; coordinates −1844 to −1621 and −254 to −140, respectively) acted as classical enhancers in transfected hepatocyte-derived HepG2 cells; their activities were promoter- and orientation-independent, and disruption of their respective HNF1-binding sites resulted in marked loss of DBP gene expression. Remarkably, the activities of these two distal elements depended upon the relative levels of HNF1α and HNF1β; HNF1α had a major stimulatory effect, whereas HNF1β acted as a trans-dominant inhibitor of HNF1α-mediated enhancer activity.

It is essential to the transport of vitamin D sterols in the blood and to the removal of plasma actin monomers released to the blood subsequent to tissue damage. DBP also contributes to complement C5a-mediated chemotaxis, macrophage activation, and fatty acid transport (reviewed in Refs. 2Cooke N.E. Haddad J.G. Endocr.

TheDBP gene is a member of the multigene family that includes albumin, α-fetoprotein, and α-albumin (4Cooke N.E. David E.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 2420-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 5Lichenstein H.S. Lyons D.E. Wurfel M.M. Johnson D.A. McGinley M.D. Leidli J.C. Trollinger D.B. Mayer J.P. Wright S.D.

David F.E.V. George D.L. Hum. Genet. 1986; 73: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and chromosome 14 in rat (r) (7Cooke N.E. Levan G. Szpirer J. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1987; 44: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and encode proteins with conservation of both primary and secondary structures. All four genes in this family are predominantly expressed in the liver. During embryonic development, expression of the rat albumin, α-fetoprotein, and DBPgenes is induced in the yolk sac and maintained in the fetal liver (8Muglia L. Locker J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas α-albumin expression begins in the liver during the subsequent perinatal period. α-Fetoprotein is selectively silenced at the end of the fetal period, whereas α-albumin, albumin, and DBP expression remains high in the liver throughout adult life (9Belanger L. Roy S. Allard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5481-5484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2J. N. MacLeod and N. E. Cooke, unpublished observations. Although mechanisms underlying the transcriptional control of the albumin and α-fetoprotein genes have been studied by a number of laboratories, the basis for the tissue-specific and developmentally regulated expression of the DBP gene remains unexplored. Tissue-specific gene expression is predominantly regulated at the level of transcription initiation (reviewed in Ref. 10Maniatis T. Goodbourn S. Fischer J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Four families of transcription factors have been identified that are involved in liver-specific gene expression: hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), HNF3, and HNF4 (reviewed in Refs. 11Cereghini S. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar and 12Johnson P.F. Williams S.C. Tronche F. Yaniu M. Liver Gene Expression. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 231-258Google Scholar). Expression of these factors is not fully restricted to the liver, and the specificity and levels of gene expression in adult hepatocytes appear to be mediated by specific combinations of trans-activators. Whereas the HNF3 proteins bind DNA as a monomer, members of each of the remaining hepatocyte-enriched transcription factor families bind DNA as homo- and heterodimers. The composition of these dimers within a family and their potential competition for shared DNA-binding sites may impose additional complexity on hepatocyte-gene regulation. In addition to the transcription-enhancing activity usually attributed to these hepatocyte-enriched factors, the presence of repressor-like molecules has been suggested by somatic cell hybrid studies demonstrating extinction of liver-specific gene expression when differentiated hepatoma cells are fused to dedifferentiated hepatoma cells or fibroblasts (13Chin A.C. Fournier R.E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1614-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, the fidelity and level of liver-specific expression is ensured by both positive and negative gene regulation. The hepatocyte-enriched transcription factor HNF1 has been studied in detail. HNF1 was initially identified as a nuclear protein that binds to an element required for liver-specific transcription of the β-fibrinogen gene (14Courtois F. Morgan J.G. Campbell L.A. Fourel G. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1987; 238: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). It has been subsequently found to interact with sites in promoters as well as enhancer elements in a number of hepatocyte-restricted genes including albumin and α-fetoprotein (15Bois-Joyeux B.

Two members of the HNF1 transcription factor family, HNF1α (also known as HNF1, LF-B1, HP-1, APF, and A box factor) and HNF1β (also known as vHNF1, vAPF, and LFB3) (20Cereghini S. Blumenfeld M.

In addition to hepatic expression, HNF1α and HNF1β are also found in nonhepatic tissues including kidney, intestine, and stomach (23Baumhueter S. Mendel D.B. Conley P.B. Kuo C.J. Turk C. Graves M.K.

Whether the relative levels of these two proteins impact on expression of specific genes has not been defined. The rDBP gene including 2,196 base pairs (bp) of the 5′-flanking region has been previously isolated and structurally characterized (25Ray K. Wang X. Zhao M. Cooke N.E. J. Biol.

Here three segments involved in rDBP expression within this 5′-flanking region have been identified by transient transfection studies. Gel mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting analyses demonstrated that their functional activities can be attributed to the presence of three corresponding HNF1-binding sites. The functional importance of these HNF1 sites was tested by mutational analyses, and opposing effects of HNF1α and HNF1β onrDBP gene expression were demonstrated. Restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. [α-32P]dNTPs, [γ-32P]ATP, andd-threo-[dichloroacetyl-1-14C]chloramphenicol were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Standard techniques (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J.

R. Kadesch (University of Pennsylvania). pSVAO(X)-CAT is a derivative of pSVAO-CAT (29Gorman C.M. Merlino G.T. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Howard B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6777-6781Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar) where SV40 sequences between PstI and BamHI from pSVAO-CAT were removed, and the polylinker (PstI,SalI, XbaI, and BamHI) was added. Oligonucleotides used for gel mobility shift assays and PCR were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. PCR was performed withTaq DNA polymerase and 10× PCR buffer containing 15 mm MgCl2 (Boehringer Mannheim), using a Perkin-Elmer thermal cycler. Autoradiographic signals were quantitated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The 5′-flanking region of therDBP gene (2.7-kilobase pairEcoRI/HindIII fragment of rDBP genomic clone C1) (25Ray K. Wang X. Zhao M. Cooke N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6221-6229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with BstNI (coordinate +53) and the following secondary restriction enzymes: SstI (−1926),NsiI (−1465), BamHI (−1077), NheI (−670), RsaI (−253), BstNI (−141), and RmaI (−41). Coordinates used in this study are the same as published (25Ray K. Wang X. Zhao M. Cooke N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6221-6229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Double digestions generated fragments with identical 3′ termini and a series of nested 5′ termini. Each fragment was blunt-ended with mung bean exonuclease and T4 DNA polymerase and then ligated to HindIII linkers (New England Biolabs). After inactivation of ligase, the DNA fragments were digested withHindIII and ligated to the pSVAO-CAT(X) vector previously linearized with HindIII. Eight different CAT constructs containing 5′-deletions of the rDBP promoter region with same 3′-end at +53 were generated (Fig. 1 A). Seven subsegments of the 5′-flanking region (A, −141 to −43; B, −254 to −140; C, −667 to −149; D, −667 to −259;E, −1077 to −664; F, −1899 to −1490;G, −2196 to −1927, Fig. 1 A) were amplified by PCR using the appropriate specific primers each containingHindIII recognition sequences (5′-CCCAAGCTT-3′) at their 5′-ends. These fragments were cloned into the HindIII site downstream of the SV40 promoter and CAT gene in plasmid pCAT promoter (Promega Corp.) in order to study their activities with a heterologous promoter. pCAT promoter was also digested withBglII upstream of the CAT gene, blunt-ended with Klenow, and ligated to each of the blunt-ended PCR fragments. To generate a second series of CAT constructs in which the seven segments of the rDBP 5′-flanking region were linked to the rDBP minimal promoter driving CAT, the pDBP/CAT vector was constructed by cloning the rDBP minimal promoter (−39 to +53) into the XbaI site of pCAT Basic (Promega Corp.). Each of the seven amplified fragments was then similarly cloned into either HindIII (upstream of CAT gene) or BamHI (downstream of CATgene) sites of the pDBP/CAT vector. The pDBP/CAT constructs, containing the putative cis-elements (fragments A–G and F-1 to F-4; Fig. 3 A) cloned upstream of the CAT gene, were sequenced by the DNA and Protein Core, University of Pennsylvania Veterinary School. Only pDBP/CAT containing fragment E differed from the published sequence; −856 CGTCTT −860 was CTTGCGCTT. Likewise, four overlapping subsegments of F (F-1, −1899 to −1757; F-2, −1844 to −1621; F-3, −1758 to −1564; and F-4, −1628 to −1490) were cloned into the pDBP/CAT vector at theHindIII site upstream of the CAT gene (Fig. 3 A) and confirmed by sequencing.Figure 3Sublocalization of fragment F enhancer activity to subfragment F-2 and identification of repressor activity in subfragment F-4.

Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar). To generate mutB, 5′ (2025 bp) and 3′ (238 bp) fragments for the overlap splicing were amplified using PfuDNA polymerase. Each fragment was amplified with oligos −2196/5′mB and 3′mB/+53 as primer pairs using the −2196DBP/CAT construct as the template (Table I and Fig. 1 A). The conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 25 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min with a final 5-min extension at 72 °C. The two amplified fragments were gel-purified, mixed, denatured at 94 °C for 3 min, annealed at 40 °C for 1 min, and extended at 72 °C for 2 min. The full-length mutB fragment was then generated by amplification between outside primers, oligos −2196 and +53 (Table I), with annealing at 60 °C. MutF-2 was similarly generated using oligos 5′mF-2 and 3′mF-2 (Table I). These two mutant fragments were digested with HindIII and ligated into the HindIII site of pSVAO-CAT(X). The plasmid −2196DBPmF-2&B/CAT (Fig. 7 B) containing HNF1 site mutations at both regions F-2 and B was generated by releasing the 1562-bp fragment containing mutation in region F-2 from −2196DBPmF-2/CAT by SacI and BstXI digestion and ligating it to the 5.4-kilobase pair SacI/BstXI doubly digested fragment of −2196DBPmB/CAT containing the mutated region B and the vector sequences.Table ISequences of the oligonucleotides used in this studyOligonucleotide nameSequence−21965′-CCCAAGCTTGAATTCTGTTGCAAGTA-3′+535′-CCCAAGCTTAGGGAGTCCTGCAG-3′5′mB5′-TAATCTTGCTCTTTGTCACTGGGAA-3′3′mB5′-CAAAGAGCAAGATTAAAACCTCCCA-3′5′mF-25′-TAGCTAAAGTTGCTCTGTGCAGACAGAG-3′3′mF-25′-TCTGCACAGAGCAACTTTAGCTACCGA-3′β285′-AACAAACTGTCAAATATTAACTAAAGGG-3′wtF-21-aThe sequence of the footprinted region is shown in italics and the conserved half of the putative HNF1-binding site is indicated in bold.5′-GTCTGCACAGTTAATCTTTAGCTAC-3′wtB1-aThe sequence of the footprinted region is shown in italics and the conserved half of the putative HNF1-binding site is indicated in bold.5′-AGTGACAAAGTTAATGATTAAAACC-3′wtA1-aThe sequence of the footprinted region is shown in italics and the conserved half of the putative HNF1-binding site is indicated in bold.5′-TGTGCAGAGATTAATAATTGATGAA-3′mutF-21-bThe mutated sequence in each HNF1-binding site is shown in bold.5′-GTCTGCACAGAGCAACTTTAGCTAC-3′mutB1-bThe mutated sequence in each HNF1-binding site is shown in bold.5′-AGTGACAAAGAGCAAGATTAAAACC-3′1-a The sequence of the footprinted region is shown in italics and the conserved half of the putative HNF1-binding site is indicated in bold.1-b The mutated sequence in each HNF1-binding site is shown in bold. Open table in a new tab HepG2 and NIH3T3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured to 60% confluency in Eagle's minimal media supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Five to 20 μg of CAT construct and 4 μg of pCH110 containing the β-galactosidase coding sequence under control of the SV40 early promoter were transfected into cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (31Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar, 32Gorman C. Glover D.M. High Efficiency Gene Transfer into Mammalian Cells: DNA Cloning. 2. IRL Press, Washington, DC1985: 143-165Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48–72 h after the transfection and were lysed with 0.9 ml of reporter lysis buffer (Promega Corp.), and lysates were used for enzyme assays. The amount of cell lysate used in CAT assays was adjusted based on the transfection efficiency determined by β-galactosidase activity (33Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). CAT activities were measured as described previously (29Gorman C.M. Merlino G.T. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Howard B.H.

BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 193-195Google Scholar), except that all the solutions contained a protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim). Protein concentrations were measured using Bio-Rad protein assay solutions following the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). A Northern blot analysis of liver RNA from wild type, HNF1α−/−, and HNF1α+/− mice was generously carried out by Drs. M. Pontoglio and M. Yaniv (36Pontoglio M. Barra J. Hadchouel M. Doyen A. Kress C. Bach J.P. Babinet C. Yaniv M. Cell. 1996; 84: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), using a32P-labeled 875-bp EcoRI rDBP cDNA fragment (37Cooke N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3441-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equal loading of lanes was documented by ethidium bromide staining for rRNA. Gel retardation assays were performed using 1–14 μg of nuclear proteins. Probe fragments, ranging in size from 98 to 223 bp, were prepared as follows. The appropriate cis-elements cloned at the HindIII site of the pDBP/CAT plasmid were released by HindIII digestion and labeled using Klenow enzyme, [α-32P]dCTP, and [α-32P]dATP by incubating at room temperature for 30 min. The labeled fragments were subjected to 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. DNA bands with the expected sizes were cut out of the gel and purified (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide β28 (Table I) was labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP by incubating at 37 °C for 30 min. Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed by a G-25 spin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nuclear extracts were incubated with 20,000 cpm of the labeled DNA probe in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 50 ng of bovine serum albumin (BSA; Boehringer Mannheim), and 1–2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The binding mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and run on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE buffer at 10 V/cm. Gels were dried and exposed to an x-ray film at room temperature without an intensifying screen. The sequences of oligos β28, wtF-2, wtB, and wtA containing HNF1-binding sites present in the β-fibrinogen gene, the rDBP gene region F-2, B, and A, respectively, are listed in Table I. mutF-2 and mutB are the corresponding oligonucleotides with mutations in their HNF1-binding sites. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides used as competitors or as a probe were synthesized and annealed in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, by heating at 90 °C for 3 min and then cooling down to 25 °C at 1 °C per 3 min in the thermal cycler. Nonspecific competitor, “β-lac,” was a 222-bp fragment of the coding region of the β-lactamase gene isolated from the pCAT Basic (Promega Corp.) vector by AvaII digestion. Fragments “F-2a” and “F-2b” were PCR-amplified subregions of fragment F located between −1844 to −1757 and between −1758 to −1621 of the rDBP 5′-flanking region, respectively (Fig. 4 B). pDBP/CAT plasmids containing fragment F-2, B, or A at the HindIII site were digested withSalI (for F-2 and B) or XbaI (for A) and labeled with Klenow enzyme, [α-32P]dCTP, and [α-32P]dATP by incubating for 30 min at room temperature. Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed by a G-50 spin column, and the DNAs were precipitated with ethanol and digested with BanI. The labeled fragments were separated from the contaminants by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, excised, and purified (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The binding reaction consisted of the following components in a final volume of 65 μl: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml BSA, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), end-labeled DNA fragment, and 50–100 μg of HepG2 nuclear proteins. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and treated with DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) for 30 s at room temperature. The amount of DNase I was adjusted empirically for each extract to produce an even pattern of partial cleavage products, generally between 0.5 and 0.02 units of the DNase I. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 volumes of 30 mm EDTA, 375 mm NaCl, and 0.75% SDS. Excess proteins were digested by adding 2 μg of proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim) followed by an incubation for 30 min at 42 °C. Nucleic acids were extracted with 1 volume of phenol:chloroform (1:1) and ethanol-precipitated. They were dissolved in 99% formamide and 10 mm EDTA with tracking dyes, heated at 90 °C for 5 min, and loaded on 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. The DNA sequence in adjacent lanes was established by chemical cleavage of phosphodiester bonds 3′ of A and G as described previously (38Negri R. Costanzo G. Mauro E.D. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To identify determinants important in rDBP transcriptional control, a series of seven sequential 5′-deletions of the previously sequenced rDBP 2196-bp 5′-flanking region contiguous with the promoter and 5′-untranslated region (25Ray K. Wang X. Zhao M. Cooke N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6221-6229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were generated and fused to a promoterless CAT reporter gene (Fig. 1 A). Plasmids containing these deletions were introduced into human hepatoma HepG2 cells or into NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and CAT activity (normalized for transfection efficiency) was determined. The full-length −2196DBP/CAT construct was highly expressed in the HepG2 cells but inactive in NIH3T3 (see below). Deletions of sequences between −1926 and −1465 and between −253 and −141 each resulted in a marked decrease in activity in the HepG2 cells (Fig. 1 B). These data suggested the presence of at least two positive regulatory elements 5′ to the rDBP promoter. To confirm and extend the 5′-deletion study, seven subsegments of the DBP 5′-flanking region were generated with termini roughly coincident with the end of the deletion constructs (fragments A–G;Fig. 1 A). Each fragment was linked to the rDBP basal promoter (−39 and +53) and tested for transcriptional activity. Consistent with the 5′-deletion results, fragments F (−1899 to −1490) and B (−254 to −140) increased CAT gene expression 2–6-fold in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2 A). This effect was independent of the position of the fragment. In contrast, fragment A (−141 to −43) was active only in its native position, 5′ to the basal promoter (Fig. 2 A). Linkage of fragments F and B to a heterologous SV40 promoter (Fig. 2 B) also resulted in 2–4-fold increases in CAT activity in HepG2 regardless of its position, whereas fragment A was inactive in this context. Fragment E containing half of a rodent B2 small repetitive element (25Ray K. Wang X. Zhao M. Cooke N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6221-6229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), fragment G, and fragment D all demonstrated negative activity on the rDBP promoter (Fig. 2 A). Fragment C encompassed negative element D and positive element B. The net effect of fragment C on the DBP promoter was negative. However, in the deletion series, elimination of −670 to −253, which corresponds to D, did not result in marked enhancement. This suggested that the negative activity in D might not be of major importance. All regions of the rDBP 5′-flanking region lacked activity in transfected NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2 B). The tissue-specific, position- and promoter-independent enhancer activity identified in fragments F and B, and a tissue-specific, position- and promoter-dependent activity identified in fragment A were further studied. Prior to detailed characterization, the active region in the 409-bp fragment F was further s"

This phenotype correlates with a reduced cell-substratum adhesion, apparently caused by a modulation of integrin function. However, it is still unclear whether the cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is affected as well. To address this question, the cadherin complex was analyzed in different cell cycle stages of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. By immunofluorescence, mitotic Madin-Darby canine kidney cells showed an increased staining of E-cadherin and the catenins (α-catenin, β-catenin, plakoglobin, p120ctn) in the cytosol, suggesting a reorganization of the cadherin-catenin complex during mitosis. Biochemical analysis revealed that the overall amount of these components, as well as the proportion of the complex associated with the actin cytoskeleton, remained unchanged in mitotic cells. However, we found evidence for an internalization of E-cadherin during mitosis. In addition, the cadherin-catenin complex was analyzed for mitosis-specific changes in phosphorylation. We report a decrease in the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin, plakoglobin, and p120ctn during mitosis. Moreover, we observed a mitosis-specific Ser/Thr-phosphorylation of p120ctn, as detected by the MPM-2 antibody. Hence, the cadherin/catenin complex is a target for different posttranslational modifications during mitosis, which may also have a profound impact on cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion.

Epithelial cells in culture or in growing tissues, such as the intestinal epithelium or the epidermal basal layer, are confined within the epithelium by extensive adhesion, both to surrounding cells and to the underlying extracellular matrix. During mitosis, epithelial cells undergo substantial changes in the distribution of all three cytoskeletal filament systems, together with a dramatic change in morphology. They generally round up, and when grown in culture, they often bulge above the monolayer. This phenotype may be at least partially caused by the loss of cell-substratum contacts during mitosis, as has been observed in epithelial cell cultures, such as Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)1 cells (1Reinsch S. Karsenti E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1509-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In fact, for rat fibroblasts, it was shown that the rounded phenotype correlates with a modulation of integrin functions (2Anilkumar N. Bhattacharya A.K. Manogaran P.S. Pande G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 338-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells are linked by a variety of cell-cell junctions, including tight junctions, adherens junctions (AJs), desmosomal junctions, and gap junctions. Little is known about the fate of these junctions during mitosis, but during cell division, some of these junctions may be modified as well. In this respect, components of the AJs are of special interest for several reasons: 1) AJs are associated with circumferential microfilament bundles, which are important components of the actin cytoskeleton in epithelial cells. Via AJs, the circumferential microfilament bundles of adjacent cells are interconnected, maintaining the integrity of the epithelial sheet. 2) AJs are main targets for posttranslational modifications, such as tyrosine phosphorylation, which induce the destruction of this region (3Matsuyoshi N.

Some of these have been found to be associated with components of AJs (6Hoschuetzky H. Aberle H. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 7Ochiai A.

Commun. 1995; 208: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cell-cell interactions of epithelial cells via AJs are mediated by E-cadherin, a member of the classical cadherin protein family (for review, see Refs. 10Kemler R. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar and 11Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). E-cadherin associates with several cytoplasmic proteins, most prominently the catenins, namely α-catenin, β-catenin, γ-catenin (plakoglobin), and p120ctn. β-Catenin and plakoglobin directly interact with E-cadherin, in a mutually exclusive manner, bridging the gap between E-cadherin and α-catenin, which then directly or indirectly connects the E-cadherin-catenin complex to the microfilament system (12Butz S.

Vakaet L. Friis R. Winterhager E. Van Roy F. Mareel M.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence for a modulation of the E-cadherin-catenin complex by tyrosine phosphorylation during mitosis comes from results in mouse fibroblasts transfected with a cDNA encoding an E-cadherin-α-catenin fusion protein (19Nagafuchi A. Ishihara S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Whereas wild-type cells showed a rounded morphology and a reduced cell-cell interaction during mitosis, cells expressing the fusion protein remained morphologically indistinguishable from the rather flat interphase cells and retained cell-cell contacts. Because the β-catenin and plakoglobin binding sites had been deleted in the fusion protein, modifications of these proteins during mitosis may occur that play an essential role in the reconstruction of the actin-based cytoskeleton. In the present study, we biochemically analyzed the E-cadherin-catenin complex in mitotic MDCK cells. Immunofluorescence revealed an enrichment of cytosolic E-cadherin-catenin-complex in mitotic cells. However, neither changes in the overall amount of the complex nor changes in its composition were observed. Biotinylation experiments showed a reduction of cell surface-localized E-cadherin during mitosis, suggesting that the E-cadherin-catenin complex is partially internalized. Analysis for posttranslational modifications revealed a decrease of tyrosine phosphorylation for β-catenin, plakoglobin, and p120ctn during mitosis, as well as a mitosis-specific Ser/Thr phosphorylation of p120ctn. To our knowledge, this is the first biochemical analysis of the E-cadherin-catenin complex during mitosis. It demonstrates that components of the cell-cell adhesion complex are both relocalized and modified during mitosis. MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. To inhibit tyrosine phosphatases, 1 mm pervanadate was added directly to the medium 30 min before cell lysis. The mouse monoclonal antibody 3G8 against E-cadherin was kindly provided by Dr. J. Nelson (Stanford University). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against α-catenin, β-catenin, plakoglobin, p120ctn (pp120), and phosphotyrosine (PY20) were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); monoclonal antibodies against β-actin were from Sigma. For immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), two APC antibodies (Ab-1 and Ab-5) were used (Oncogene Science, Manhasset, NY). The monoclonal antibody MPM-2 was kindly provided by the group of Dr. Marc Kirschner (Harvard Medical School). Fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies l-mimosine and nocodazole were purchased from Sigma. MDCK cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 105 cells/10-cm dish. Nocodazole (5 mg/ml stock in 100% Me2SO) was added directly to the medium at 0.33 μm (0.1% Me2SO); after the cells were cultivated for an additional 11 h, they were lysed in CSK buffer (150 mm NaCl; 10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8; 3 mm MgCl2; 300 mm sucrose; 0.5% Triton X-100; 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; CompleteTM (Boehringer Mannheim)). As a control, cultures were treated with 0.1% Me2SO alone. For cell cycle analysis, synchronized cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a Becton Dickinson FACScan® as described (20Urbani L. Sherwood S.W. Schimke R.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To evaluate the percentage of mitotic cells, cells grown on coverslips were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma), and the number of cells with condensed chromatin were quantified by counting under the fluorescence microscope. Mimosine was added directly to the medium for 18 h, at a final concentration of 1 mm, to arrest the cells in early S phase. For biochemical analysis, either cells were directly lysed in CSK-buffer (G1 phase) or mimosine was washed out and cells were cultured for additional 3 h (S phase), 6 h (S/G2 phase) or 9.5 h (G2/M phase) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before lysis. MDCK cells were grown on collagen-coated coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Free aldehyde groups were blocked with 1 m glycine/phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.5, for 5 min. After washing, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Alternatively, cells were fixed with 100% methanol for 4 min at −20 °C. Fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies at 2 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C and fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed, and the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml) for 5 min at room temperature, washed, and mounted (50% glycerol; 50% phosphate-buffered saline; 100 μg/ml 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2.]octone). Digital images were taken with a computer controlled digital C4880 camera (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan) on an Axioskop microscope (Zeiss, Jena). Camera and microscope were controlled by the computer program Openlab (Improvision, Coventry, UK). MDCK cells were lysed in CSK buffer, and the detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The detergent-insoluble fraction was solubilized by heating to 100 °C for 5 min in immunoprecipitation buffer (1% SDS; 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 2 mm EDTA) and further diluted to 0.1% SDS with CSK buffer. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatant and the solubilized cytoskeleton fraction were precleared with 10% protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) for 1 h at 4 °C. Approximately 2 μg of specific antibodies were coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. The antigen-antibody complex was washed with CSK buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by PAGE as described (21Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting of APC, cell extracts were prepared according to the manufacturer's description and separated by 5% SDS-PAGE. For metabolic labeling of synchronized cultures, cells were starved for 30 min and incubated with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany) for 2 h before lysis. For quantification, radioactive gels were quantified in a BAS 1000 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji). Western blots were quantified by Lumi-Imager (Boehringer Mannheim) or by analyzing the film using the NIH Image program version 1.59. Only differences in band intensities of a factor of at least 2 were considered significant and are described in the text. After 24 h of growth in the presence or absence of nocodazole or l-mimosine, the cells were washed with Ringer's buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4; 154 mmNaCl; 7.2 mm KCl; 1.8 mm CaCl2) and incubated with 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (20 mg/ml stock in Me2SO; Pierce) in Ringer's buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, cells were washed with Tris-saline (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4; 120 mm NaCl) and lysed in CSK buffer. The detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation, and E-cadherin was precipitated from both fractions with the monoclonal antibody 3G8. Biotinylated E-cadherin was detected with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Vectastain ABC peroxidase standard kit; Vectastain Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) after Western blotting. A recombinant gluthatione S-transferase (GST)-tagged cytoplasmic domain of mouse E-cadherin was expressed in E. coli and affinity-purified on glutathioneS-transferase-agarose beads. Approximately 10 μg of GST-E-cadherin were used for the affinity precipitation of β-catenin as described (22Aberle H. Schwartz H. Hoschuetzky H. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1520-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The localization of the E-cadherin-catenin complex was compared in mitotic versus interphase cells by indirect immunofluorescence. Subconfluent MDCK cells were stained with the monoclonal antibody 3G8 specific for E-cadherin or with monoclonal antibodies specific for α-catenin, β-catenin, plakoglobin, p120ctn, and β-actin (Fig. 1, A–F); nuclei were costained with Hoechst 33342 (Fig. 1, A′–F′). Optical sections were taken at 0.2-μm intervals from the top to the bottom of the cell layer, and out-of-focus information was removed by a deconvolution algorithm. Typically, nonmitotic MDCK cells formed a flattened epithelial sheet, with E-cadherin predominantly localized at cell-cell boundaries, whereas the cytoplasm was apparently devoid of E-cadherin (Fig. 1, A and A′). Mitotic cells, instead, usually had a rounded phenotype, bulging above the monolayer, and differed markedly in the localization of the E-cadherin-catenin complex. In these cells, E-cadherin was not only restricted to sites of cell-cell contact, forming a peripheral ring-like structure, but was also substantially increased in the cytosol. Similar distribution patterns were also observed for the catenins, α-catenin, β-catenin, plakoglobin, and p120ctn, in various stages of mitosis (Fig. 1, B–E and B′–E′, respectively). The observed cytoplasmic staining is not based on an increase in the local concentration of the proteins due to a reduced cell size, because the same pattern was also observed for mitotic MDCK cells that were not completely rounded but had the same size as interphase cells (Fig. 1 E). This indicates that in mitotic cells, the subcellular localization of the cadherin-catenin-complex changes either by internalization or by cytoplasmic storage of newly synthesized complex. In agreement with previous results, the cortical actin belt was found to persist during mitosis (Fig. 1, F and F′), indicating that mitotic MDCK cells apparently retain AJs (23Sandig M. Kalnins V.I. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1990; 17: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24Baker J. Garrod D. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 415-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For a biochemical analysis of the cadherin-catenin complex during mitosis, MDCK cells were synchronized by nocodazole. After 11 h of incubation with 0.33 μm nocodazole, about 95% of the cells showed a 4c DNA content by FACScan analysis (Fig. 2, A and B, left panels). For further quantification of the number of mitotic cells, cells grown on coverslips were stained with Hoechst 33342 at each time point and analyzed under the microscope. After nocodazole treatment, nearly all cells were completely rounded and found to be in mitosis (Fig. 2, A and B, right panels). Nocodazole destabilizes microtubules and inhibits the formation of the mitotic spindle, causing an arrest in mitosis. Although no connections between the microtubule network and the E-cadherin cell adhesion complex have been described so far, some components of the complex,e.g. α-catenin, β-catenin, and plakoglobin, have been found to be associated with the tumor suppressor protein APC. APC is thought to be involved in the degradation of β-catenin and is also known to bind to microtubules (25Munemitsu S. Souza B. Muller O. Albert I. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3676-3681PubMed Google Scholar, 26Smith K.J. Levy D.B. Maupin P. Pollard T.D. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3672-3675PubMed Google Scholar, 27Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3046-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Therefore, to exclude unspecific effects of nocodazole, we also used mimosine for cell synchronization. Mimosine is a natural plant drug that arrests cells at the G1/S phase border in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting cytoskeletal structures (20Urbani L. Sherwood S.W. Schimke R.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28Ouhibi N. Fulka Jr., J. Kanka J. Moor R.M. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 38: 731-736PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hughes T.A. Cook P.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The inhibition of entry into S phase by mimosine treatment is reversed when the drug is removed, and the cells continue to progress into S phase. Hence, no drug was present when mitotic cells were analyzed. For the mimosine experiments, MDCK cells were arrested at the G1/S phase interface in the presence of 1 mmmimosine for 18 h. FACScan analysis was performed to evaluate cell synchronization as described under “Materials and Methods.” About 85% of the cells were at the G1/S phase transition (Fig. 2 C, left panel). Upon release into complete medium without mimosine, the cells progressed into S phase. After 3 h, an average of about 90% of the cells had started DNA synthesis (Fig. 2 D); 6 h after mimosine was removed, most of the cells had already replicated their DNA (considered as G2 phase) (Fig. 2 E), and at 9.5 h, about 82% cells showed a 4c DNA content (Fig. 2 F). Whereas in nonsynchronized cultures only about 5% of the cells were in mitosis (Fig. 2 A, right panel), about 50% of the cells released from the mimosine block entered mitosis in a synchronized manner, as analyzed by microscopy (Fig. 2 E, right panel). Because nocodazole leads to a higher proportion of mitotic cells, its effects were more distinct. Thus, only the nocodazole experiments are presented here. However, we have observed comparable effects with both agents in all experiments described. The immunofluorescence data suggested an overall increase in the cytosolic E-cadherin-catenin complex during mitosis. For a biochemical analysis, cells were arrested in mitosis by nocodazole treatment or at the G1/S phase border by mimosine. Both populations were compared with nonsynchronized cells and, as a control, to cells treated only with 0.1% Me2SO, used as solvent for nocodazole (Fig. 3). Cell extracts were separated into the detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction and analyzed by Western blotting. No significant change in the overall protein amount of the E-cadherin-catenin complex could be observed in mitotic cells, in the detergent-soluble (Fig. 3 A) and detergent-insoluble fraction (data not shown). This indicates that the intense cytosolic fluorescence staining in mitotic cells is not simply a result of an increased protein amount or the result of a translocation of the plasma membrane-localized, actin-associated complex to a cytosolic, non-actin-associated pool. In agreement to previous results, we found no increase in the overall actin amount in mitotic cells (30Cao L.G. Wang Y.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1905-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To determine the stoichiometry of the individual components of the cadherin-catenin complex during mitosis, MDCK cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine and arrested in the different cell cycle stages as described above. The complex was precipitated either by the 3G8 antibody or antibodies specific for β-catenin (Fig. 3 B). No significant differences in the protein stoichiometry of the E-cadherin-catenin complex were observed in a particular cell cycle stage. Additionally, no difference in the amount of E-cadherin-associated p120ctn was observed during mitosis in E-cadherin immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 C). The biochemical analysis indicated that the overall protein amount of E-cadherin is not changed during mitosis, but this does not exclude a change in the subcellular localization of the detergent-soluble (plasma membrane-associated and cytosolic) E-cadherin pool, e.g. by internalization. To determine the amount of cell surface-localized E-cadherin, cell surface proteins were biotinylated. E-cadherin was precipitated from cell extracts with the 3G8 antibody and visualized for biotinylated E-cadherin in Western blots by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. The amount of the detergent-soluble cell surface-localized E-cadherin was significantly (by a factor of 2.0) reduced in mitotic cells compared with non-mitotic cells or cells arrested in early S phase (Fig. 4). The smaller bands recognized by streptavidin-peroxidase may correspond to proteolytic degradation products of E-cadherin. Biotinylated E-cadherin was never observed in the detergent-insoluble protein fraction (not shown). We conclude that a small fraction of the detergent-soluble E-cadherin is internalized during mitosis. In addition to its function in cell adhesion, β-catenin is also known to participate in signal transduction to the nucleus (for a review, see Ref. 31Orsulic S. Peifer M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1363-1367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A major requirement for the signaling competence of β-catenin is the existence of a cytoplasmic pool of β-catenin that is not associated with E-cadherin or any other protein that could prevent association with a member of the lymphocyte enhancing factor/T-cell factor family. To analyze differences in the amount of the free, non-E-cadherin-associated pool of β-catenin, cell extracts from synchronized cells were subjected to in vitro binding assays with a recombinant E-cadherin-GST fusion protein. Cell extracts derived from nonsynchronized and synchronized cells were incubated with this recombinant GST-E-cadherin fusion protein. The formed protein complex was precipitated by glutathione S-transferase beads and analyzed by Western blotting with β-catenin-specific antibodies. Because β-catenin that is already associated with cellular E-cadherin is inaccessible to bind to the recombinant GST-E-cadherin, only the free, non-E-cadherin-associated pool of β-catenin is detected (32Tzuu-Shuh J. Stewart D.B. Stappert J. Nelson W.J. Marrs J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5067-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). No difference in the amount of cytoplasmic β-catenin was observed in mitotic cells versus nonsynchronized cells (Fig. 5, A and B). A molecule thought to regulate the cytoplasmic pool of β-catenin by participating in β-catenin degradation is the APC protein (for a review, see Ref. 33Barth A.I.M. Naethke I.S. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Previous results have shown that APC is hyperphosphorylated in mitotic human osteosarcoma cells, resulting in a molecular weight shifted band when separated by SDS-PAGE (34Bhattacharjee R.N. Hamada F. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We observed a similar molecular weight shift for APC in mitotic MDCK cells, suggesting that in these cells, APC is also hyperphosphorylated during mitosis (Fig. 5 D). In contrast to previous reports describing an enrichment of β-catenin on hyperphosphorylated APC, no such increase was detectable in mitotic cells (Fig. 5 C) (35Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Cadherins and some catenins are targets for different tyrosine kinases, but the precise role of this tyrosine phosphorylation is largely unknown. It has been reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin in cells expressing v-Src correlates with a decrease in cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion (4Behrens J. Vakaet L. Friis R. Winterhager E. Van Roy F. Mareel M.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar,5Hamaguchi M. Matsuyoshi N. Ohnishi Y. Gotoh B. Takeichi M. Nagai Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In addition, β-catenin was found to be associated with the EGFR, the activation of which correlates with a partial dissociation of the complex (6Hoschuetzky H. Aberle H. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 36Takahashi K. Suzuki K. Tsukatina Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To analyze changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of the individual components of the cadherin-catenin complex during mitosis, MDCK cells arrested in different cell cycle stages were lysed either directly after cell synchronization or preincubated with 1 mmpervanadate to inhibit tyrosine phosphatases before cell lysis. Immunoprecipitations were made with the anti-E-cadherin 3G8 antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine-antibodies (Fig. 6 A). An anti-β-catenin blot (Fig. 6B) was used as an internal control to verify that equal amounts of protein were loaded. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody specifically detected three bands, with molecular masses of approximately 90, 85, and 83 kDa, in cell lysates from cells preincubated with pervanadate (Fig. 6 A). No reactivity could be observed on lysates from no"

These two elements, however, do not universally confer efficient Sec incorporation. The objective of this study was to systematically examine the effect of UGA codon position on efficiency of Sec insertion. In a glutathione peroxidase-1 (F-GPX1) expression vector, the UGA at the native position (U47) was mutated to a cysteine codon, and codons for Ser-7, Ser-12, Ser-18, Ser-29, Ser-45, Ser-93, Cys-154, Val-172, Ser-178, and Ser-195 were individually mutated to UGA and transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. 75Se incorporation at the 11 positions was 31, 72, 54, 105, 90, 100, 146, 135, 13, 11, and 43%, respectively, of 75Se incorporation at U47, suggesting that Sec is more efficiently incorporated at UGA codons positioned in the middle of the coding region rather than close to the 5′ or 3′ ends. Ribonuclease protection showed that these differences were not due to differences in mRNA level. When the green fluorescence protein (GFP) coding region was placed in-frame at the 5′ or 3′ ends of the coding region in F-GPX1 to produce chimeric 50–51-kDa GFP/GPX1 proteins, Sec incorporation at UGA codons, formerly close to the 5′ or 3′ ends, was increased to levels comparable to the UGA at U47. Insertion of GFP after the UAA-stop was just as effective in increasing Sec insertion efficiency as GFP inserted before the stop. These studies used a recombinant expression model that incorporated Sec at non-native UGA codons at rates equal to those of endogenous glutathione peroxidase-1 and showed that the efficiency of Sec incorporation can be modulated by UGA position; Sec incorporation at high efficiency appears to require that the UGA be >21 nucleotides from the AUG-start and >204 nucleotides from the selenocysteine insertion sequence element.

A selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element stem-loop has been shown to be necessary for recognition of the UGA as a Sec codon rather than a nonsense codon (24Böck A. Burk R.F. Selenium in Biology and Human Health. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1994: 9-25Crossref Google Scholar,26Berry M.J. Banu L. Chen Y. Mandel S.J. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, the SECIS element is located in the 3′-UTR, whereas in prokaryotes, the SECIS element is located immediately downstream of the UGA codon. Together the UGA and SECIS elements appear to be the two necessary cis-acting mRNA elements that confer recognition of UGA as a Sec codon during translation (24Böck A. Burk R.F. Selenium in Biology and Human Health. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1994: 9-25Crossref Google Scholar, 27Berry M.J. Banu L. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R.

The carbon skeleton of the Sec is provided by serine (29Sunde R.A. Evenson J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 933-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); serine, esterified to a unique tRNAUCASer→Sec in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and selenophosphate, synthesized by selenophosphate synthetase, are the substrates used to form Sec-tRNAUCASer→Sec (24Böck A.

Selenium in Biology and Human Health. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1994: 25-44Crossref Google Scholar). This reaction is catalyzed by selenocysteine synthetase (SELA) in bacteria (31Forchhammer K. Leinfelder W. Boesmiller K. Veprek B. Böck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Forchhammer K. Böck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6324-6328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the enzyme is yet to be characterized in eukaryotes. The remaining steps for translational insertion of Sec into selenoproteins must be inferred from the known bacterial reactions wherein a unique elongation factor (SELB) with affinity for the SECIS element promotes the formation of a quaternary mRNA·Sec-tRNAUCASer→Sec·SELB·GTP complex that leads to translational incorporation of Sec into the nascent polypeptide chain (33Kromayer M.

To study Sec incorporation, a good experimental model is needed.75Se is readily incorporated into selenoproteins when animals are injected with 75Se or when cells are cultured with 75Se (21Sunde R.A. O'Dell B.L. Sunde R.A. Handbook of Nutritionally Essential Mineral Elements. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 493-556Google Scholar). Insertion of intact selenoprotein cDNAs or genes into conventional expression vectors, however, typically results at best in 2–5-fold overexpression of GPX1 activity when the host endogenously expresses the selenoprotein (39Brigelius-Flohe R. Friedrichs B. Maurer S. Schultz M. Streicher R. Biochem. J. 1998; 328: 199-203Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 40Kretz-Remy C. Mehlen P. Mirault M.E. Arrigo A.P. J.

RNA (NY). 1998; 4: 816-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cysteine-substituted GPX1 has been synthesized in bacteria using mutant Sec→Cys constructs, but synthesis of eukaryotic selenoproteins in bacterial systems does not occur due to disparate ribosomal and translational factors (16Rocher C. Lalanne J.L. Chaudiere J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 43Rocher C. Faucheu C. Hervë F. Bënicourt C. Lalanne J.L.

By using transfection in oocytes as well as in several different mammalian cell lines, a number of researchers have studied the effect of various SECIS elements and the effect of primary and secondary SECIS structure on Sec incorporation into selenoproteins. SECIS elements from type I deiodinase, GPX1, GPX4, selenoprotein P (with two SECIS elements), and selenoprotein W all confer the ability of an UGA-containing mRNA to incorporate Sec during translation (22Low S.C.

The efficiency of Sec incorporation occurs at 1/400th to 1/20th of the rate for Cys incorporation, and this efficiency varies markedly depending on the nature of the SECIS element (13Kim I.Y. Guimaraes M.J. Zlotnik A. Bazan J.F. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Berry M.J. Banu L. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Far fewer studies have directly examined the effect of the UGA position on the efficiency of Sec incorporation. Mutation of four codons to UGA at other positions throughout type I deiodinase demonstrated that a specific UGA context was not required for Sec incorporation (27Berry M.J. Banu L. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Deletion of nucleotide sequences adjacent to the UGA codon of GPX1 resulted in translational incorporation of 75Se into recombinant GPX1, although relative 75Se incorporation was reduced for at least four of the constructs (28Shen Q. Chu F.-F. Newburger P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11463-11469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One study, which focused directly on the base following the UGA, reported that Sec incorporation could change as much as 3-fold depending on the identity of the fourth base. These reports suggest that additional cis-elements may be required for efficient Sec translation or that the assembly of the required components at the UGA in combination with competition with release factors may be inefficient relative to the incorporation of other amino acids. Thus we conducted these studies to systematically investigate the effect of UGA position on Sec incorporation. We constructed a genomic GPX1 expression vector that overexpressed 75Se-labeled recombinant protein at levels greater than the endogenously encoded selenoproteins. Mutation of 10 separate codons to UGA indicated that UGA codons located in the middle of the open reading frame efficiently direct Sec incorporation. Codons located close to the 5′-start or 3′-termination codons were much less efficient, but insertion of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding region as a spacer increased the efficiency of Sec incorporation at these positions to that of the wild-type UGA position. These studies suggest that for optimum Sec incorporation the UGA must be >21 nt from the AUG-start and >204 nt from the SECIS element. The oligonucleotides uses are as follows: 57, cgactacaaagatgacgatgacaaagc (for inserting FLAG-epitope); 58, tttgtcatcgtcatctttgtagtcggc (for inserting FLAG-epitope); 59, cgtggtgccgcagagagacgc (for changing U47 to Cys); 73, gtagtcggctcagagccgag (for changing Ser-7 to U); 76, catacacggttcactgtgccg (for changing Ser-12 to U); 77, gcgggcgcgctcagaaggcat (for changing Ser-18 to U); 74, gagcccagtcacacaggctc (for changing Ser-29 to U); 65, tgccgcagagtcacgcgaca (for changing Ser-45 to U); 63, gtacttgagtcaattcagaatc (for changing Ser-93 to U); 64, gtcgttgcgtcacaccggag (for changing Cys-154 to U); 78, gcgcacgggtcaaccgtcggg (for changing Val-172 to U); 72, aagcggcgtcagtacctgcg (for changing Ser-178 to U); 79, cagactgctgtcacagcaggg (for changing Ser-195 to U); 80, agctgtacaagtgtgctgctcggctc (5′-PCR primer for GFP-GPX1); 81, attgtacaatgacacaggacacacaaac (3′-PCR primer for GFP-GPX1); 104, gtgagcaagggcgaggag (5′-PCR primer for GPX1-GFP and GPX1-taa-gfp); 105, ttacttgtacagctcgtc (3′-PCR primer for GPX1-GFP and GPX1-taa-gfp). The gpx1 expression vector (Fig. 1 a) was constructed by inserting theXbaI/HindIII fragment of the mouse genomicgpx1 gene (2Chambers I. Frampton J. Goldfarb P. Affara N. McBain W. Harrison P.R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) at the corresponding sites in the multiple cloning region in pRc/CMV vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) as described previously (42Weiss S.L. Sunde R.A. RNA (NY). 1998; 4: 816-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The f-gpx1 expression construct (Fig. 1 b) was prepared by annealing complementary 27-nt oligomers (oligo-57 and -58) encoding the FLAG epitope (48Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V.L. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1204-1210Crossref Scopus (752) Google Scholar) with SacII restriction site overhangs and ligating this insert into theSacII site of mouse gpx1 in pRc/CMV vector. The construct was confirmed by restriction digestion and by DNA sequencing. The f-gpx1 was then subcloned to the pBluescript II SK(−) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) vector at the XbaI site in the multiple cloning region for use as a template for site-directed mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted according to standard procedures (49Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar) to change TGA for the native U47 to TGC for Cys. The resulting U47C containing f-gpx1 was used as a common template for changing 10 different codons into TGA by site-directed mutagenesis. These codons were TCC for Ser-7, TCC for Ser-12, TCC for Ser-18, AGC for Ser-29, TCT for Ser-45, TCC for Ser-93, TGC for Cys-154, GTT for Val-172, AGC for Ser-178, and TCC for Ser-195 as indicated in Fig. 1 d. Amino acid numbers refer to the original residue position in murine GPX1 (2Chambers I. Frampton J. Goldfarb P. Affara N. McBain W. Harrison P.R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing at the DNA Core Facility at the University of Missouri, Columbia. In total, one wild-type f-gpx1 and 10 mutant f-gpx1 constructs were prepared. Each construct was made and tested independently at least twice. The coding region of enhanced GFP was obtained in the pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). To make GFP-GPX1 fusion constructs, the F-GPX1 coding region without Met-1 and the GPX1 3′-UTR (nt 41–1234) (2Chambers I. Frampton J. Goldfarb P. Affara N. McBain W. Harrison P.R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) were PCR-amplified with oligo-80 (5′ primer) and oligo-81 (3′ primer). Both primers contained BsrgI recognition sequences at the 5′ end. The amplified fragment was digested with BsrgI and inserted at the BsrgI site of GFP. Clones with GPX1 inserted in sense orientation with GFP were identified by restriction digestion analysis. The resulting GFP-GPX1 constructs had GFP coding region inserted in-frame in front of the F-GPX1 coding region (without Met-1) followed by the GPX1 3′-UTR. To make GPX1-GFP fusion constructs, the GFP coding region without Met-1 was PCR-amplified with oligo-104 (5′ primer) and oligo-105 (3′ primer). The PCR products were blunted by mung bean nuclease. The F-GPX1 constructs were digested with Bsu36I restriction enzyme, blunted with mung bean nuclease, and ligated with the GFP coding region. Clones with GFP inserted in sense orientation with GPX1 were identified by restriction digestion analysis. The resulting GPX1-GFP constructs had GFP coding region without Met-1 inserted in-frame downstream of the entire GPX1 coding region but before the UAA stop codon. The GPX1/TAA/GFP constructs were made in a similar way as GPX1-GFP except that after the F-GPX1 constructs were digested withBsu36I enzyme, the TAA overhang was filled in by Klenow fragment. The resulting GPX1/TAA/GFP fusion constructs had GFP coding region without Met-1 inserted immediately downstream from the GPX1 UAA stop codon. For these three sets of fusion constructs, at least two independently constructed fusion genes were examined. The 3′ 477-base pairApaI/EcoRI fragment of mouse genomicgpx1 was subcloned into pBluescript II SK(−) vector and then linearized with Bsu36I to make the gpx1 probe template. A 228-base pair EcoRV/PstI fragment of the neomycin resistance gene (neo) was removed from the pRc/CMV vector, subcloned into the pBluescript II SK(−) vector, and then linearized with SalI to make theneo probe template. In vitro transcription of antisense RNA probes was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison. WI) using 40 μCi of [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products) and 4 μl of 100 μm cold UTP per reaction. The full-length probes were purified by electrophoresis through a 6% polyacrylamide gel, eluted in 2 m ammonium acetate + 1% SDS, and ethanol-precipitated. Total RNA was isolated from Se-adequate (10−7mNa2SeO3) transiently transfected COS-7 cells 48 h after transfection as described previously (41Weiss S.L. Sunde R.A. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 1304-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Two plates of transfected cells were pooled for each sample to provide an adequate yield of RNA. RNA samples from each transfection pool (20 μg total RNA) were hybridized overnight at 45 °C with the single-stranded antisense RNA probes for mouse GPX1 mRNA and neomRNA and then treated with RNase (40 μg/ml RNase A, 2 μg/ml RNase T1) for 45 min at 30 °C. After RNase inactivation, the protected probe fragments were ethanol-precipitated, and samples were analyzed on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Control samples containing 20 μg of yeast tRNA did not protect any detectable probe fragments from the RNase digestion. The experiments were repeated three times with RNA samples from three individual transfections for each construct. Within each sample, the protected GPX1 mRNA signal was normalized to the protected neo mRNA. Analysis of variance was used to determine that GPX1 mRNA levels were not significantly different among COS-7 cells transfected with the various F-GPX1 constructs. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine according to standard cell culture procedures (50William B.J. Pastan I.H. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 1-642Google Scholar). For transient expression, 24 h before transfection, 1 × 106 cells were seeded in each 100-mm plate. Twenty micrograms of each plasmid DNA were transfected into cells in each plate by calcium phosphate-mediated method (51Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 1-545Google Scholar). As a control for transfection efficiency, 3 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega) was co-transfected for each plate. For75Se labeling, 5 μCi of 75Se as Na2SeO3 (100–400 μCi of 75Se/μg of selenium, pH 7.0, University of Missouri Research Reactor) were added to each plate 24 h after transfection. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in 900 μl of lysis buffer per plate (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysed cell suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min to remove cell debris, and the lysate supernatant was used for subsequent analysis. Protein concentration was quantitated by the method of Lowry et al. (52Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was determined with the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (65Promega Corp. (1993) Technical Bulletin, No. 097, Madison, WIGoogle Scholar). GPX1 activity was determined as described (53Lawrence R.A. Sunde R.A. Schwartz G.L. Hoekstra W.G. Exp. Eye Res. 1974; 18: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was conducted with 50 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel for each aliquot of lysate according to the manufacturer's protocol (Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel, Scientific Imaging Systems, Eastman Kodak Co.). Quantitation of75Se incorporation into transfected F-GPX1 was obtained by immunoprecipitation of 200 μg of lysate protein followed by counting of the washed precipitate. Selenoproteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE using 0.75-mm gels (51Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 1-545Google Scholar).75Se incorporation into selenoprotein bands was quantitated by autoradiography (X-Omat Blue XB-1 film, Kodak) followed by densitometric scanning (LKB 2222 UltraScan, Pharmacia LKB, Uppsala).75Se incorporation into transfected F-GPX1 or GPX1 was expressed as a percentage of total 75Se incorporated into all the selenoproteins. These values were normalized relative to co-expressed β-galactosidase activity. For each transfection experiment, the normalized value of each transfected recombinant GPX1 was expressed as a percentage of the level of expression of the wild-type GPX1 in the same transfection experiment. Each construct was examined in at least three independent transfection experiments with at least three replicates for each experiment. Analysis of variance was used to determine differences due to UGA position in mRNA levels and 75Se incorporation. Differences were considered significant at the probability level p < 0.05. To develop a model selenoprotein to study 75Se incorporation during translation, the 1497-base pair murine genomic GPX1 sequence was inserted into the pRc/CMV vector (Fig. 1 a), transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, and labeled for 24 h with 75Se. As shown in Fig. 2 a, wild-type COS-7 cells prominently label thioredoxin reductase (TR) (10Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mutant and wild type receptors were expressed in a mesangial cell line, and clones expressing similar numbers of receptors were studied. Affinity and specificity of TxA2 binding to the mutant receptor were identical to wild type receptors. In contrast, TxA2-induced inositol trisphosphate generation by the mutant receptor was enhanced compared with the wild type. Prior treatment with the TxA2agonist U46619 reduced subsequent U46619-induced increases in inositol trisphosphate generation by both receptors; however, the extent of desensitization was significantly reduced in the receptor mutant. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors attenuated TxA2-induced desensitization of wild type receptors, but had little effect on TxA2-induced desensitization of mutant receptors. Pretreatment with the phorbol ester phorbol 12,13-dybutyrate (PDBu) (100 nm) decreased subsequent responsiveness of wild type but not mutant TP receptors. U46619-induced desensitization of wild type receptors was associated with enhanced phosphorylation of receptor proteins.

Treatment with 100 nm PDBu increased phosphorylation of both wild type and mutant TP receptors, but the extent of phosphorylation of the receptor mutant was reduced compared with the wild type. Increasing the concentration of PDBu from 100 nm to 1 μmPDBu reduced responsiveness of both mutant and wild type receptors without enhancing phosphorylation of either of the receptor proteins.

This loss of receptor responsiveness or desensitization has been extensively studied in the cAMP-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor and the phosphodiesterase-coupled receptor rhodopsin. In these receptor systems, desensitization is largely caused by direct phosphorylation of receptors at serine and threonine residues, often in the C terminus (reviewed in Dohlman et al. (7Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar)). Receptor phosphorylation is mediated by both receptor specific kinases and general kinase systems such as protein kinase A and C (8Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). These kinase systems provide a mechanism for regulating receptor activity through negative feedback loops (homologous desensitization) as well as for modulating receptor responsiveness through cross-talk between different receptor systems (heterologous desensitization).The receptor for TxA2 belongs to the large superfamily of heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors (9Abe T., K.

Chem. 1991; 266: 9309-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, two isoforms of the human TP receptor have been described (14Raychowdhury M.K. Yukawa M. Collins L.J. McGrail S.H. Kent K.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 269: 19256-19261Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) which, in addition to coupling to phospholipase C, oppositely regulate adenylyl cyclase activity (15Hirata T. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Okuma M. Narumiyz S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that desensitization of TP receptors is mediated, in part, through activation of PKC (4Dorn G.W. Davis M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C864-C872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Spurney R.F. Middleton J.P. Raymond J.R. Coffman T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 36: F467-FF78Google Scholar). PKC-induced desensitization may involve direct phosphorylation of C-terminal domains of the TP receptor because 1) truncation of the C terminus attenuates desensitization mediated by direct activation of PKC by phorbol esters (16Spurney R.F. Coffman T.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 207-215PubMed Google Scholar), 2) PKC can phosphorylate C-terminal sequences of the TP receptor in vitro (5Kinsella B.T. O'Mahony J.O. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29914-29919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 3) phorbol ester-induced activation of PKC causes phosphorylation of the human TP receptor isoforms in the intact cell (17Habib A. Vezza R. Creminon C. Maclouf J. Fitzgerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). While the C terminus of the TP receptor contains several potential PKC phosphorylation sites, it is not known if phosphorylation of these domains contributes to TP receptor desensitization. We therefore constructed a mutant TP receptor (mutant 1) in which serines with favorable phosphorylation motifs for PKC (positions 321, 322, and 328) were replaced with either alanine or glycine. Both mutant and wild type receptors were epitope-tagged to permit rapid isolation of receptor proteins and assessment of their phosphorylation state. As an additional control, we compared desensitization of mutant 1 with another mutant receptor (mutant 2) in which a C-terminal serine lacking a consensus motif for phosphorylation by PKC (position 339) was replaced with glycine. Using these constructs, we investigated the role of C-terminal serines in regulating TP receptor responsiveness by direct phosphorylation of receptor proteins.DISCUSSIONTxA2 plays a key role in diseases affecting the heart, lungs, kidneys, and peripheral vascular system (1Fitzgerald G.A. Healy C. Daugherty J. FASEB. 1987; 46: 154-158Google Scholar, 2Oates J.A. Fitzgerald G.A. Jackson E.K. Knapp H.R. Roberts L.J. N. Engl. J.

Its effects are regulated by both PKC-dependent and PKC-independent mechanisms (4Dorn G.W. Davis M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C864-C872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Spurney R.F. Middleton J.P. Raymond J.R. Coffman T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 36: F467-FF78Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that C-terminal domains are required for regulation of the TP receptor by PKC (17Habib A. Vezza R. Creminon C. Maclouf J. Fitzgerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), perhaps by direct phosphorylation of the receptor protein (5Kinsella B.T. O'Mahony J.O. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29914-29919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Habib A. Vezza R. Creminon C. Maclouf J. Fitzgerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the role of the C-terminal serines in the rapid regulation of TP receptor responsiveness. We found that TP receptors lacking serines at positions 321, 322, and 328 in the C terminus are resistant to both U46619- and PKC-induced desensitization. Attenuated desensitization of the receptor mutant is associated with decreased phosphorylation of receptor proteins compared with wild type receptors. Taken together, these data suggest that both agonist-specific and PKC-induced desensitization of the TP receptor are mediated, at least in part, by phosphorylation of C-terminal hydroxyamino acids.The absence of the C-terminal serines at positions 321, 322, and 328 inhibited, but did not prevent, U46619-induced phosphorylation of the TP receptor. These findings indicate that the TP receptor is phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent fashion at residues other than serines 321, 322, and 328. It is likely that this agonist-dependent phosphorylation of mutant 1 is mediated by either receptor specific kinases or general kinase systems such PKC. With regard to the latter hypothesis, the specific PKC inhibitor GF109203X markedly attenuated, but did not prevent, U46619-induced phosphorylation of the TP receptor. Similar results were found using the more general kinase inhibitor staurosporine. Thus, the TP receptor is phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner by a staurosporine- and GF109203X-resistant kinase. These finding are consistent with the notion that receptor specific kinases may contribute to desensitization of the mouse TP receptor. This family of kinases has been shown to play a major key role in regulating receptor responsiveness in other receptor systems (7Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar, 8Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Although the consensus motif for phosphorylation by receptor-specific kinases is not fully elucidated, serine or threonine residues flanked by acid amino acids (D/ES/T or D/EXS/T) appear to be preferred substrates for G protein-coupled receptor kinases (33Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Motifs of this configuration are found in the third intracellular loop of the mouse, rat, and human TP receptor (9Abe T., K. Takeuchi N. Takahashi E. Tsutsumi Y. Taniyama Abe K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 644-657Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Hirata M. Hayashi Y. Ushikubi F. Yokota Y. Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Narumiya S. Nature. 1991; 349: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 11Namba T. Sugimoto Y. Hirata M. Hayashi Y. Honda A. Watabe A. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and might play a role in regulating TP receptor responsiveness. Indeed, preliminary studies from this laboratory suggest that phosphorylation of the TP receptor by G protein-coupled receptor kinases may contribute to TP receptor regulation (34Spurney R.F. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 447AGoogle Scholar).The absence of serines 321, 322, and 328 prevented desensitization of TP receptors by 100 nm PDBu. In contrast, 1 μm PDBu caused desensitization of wild type and mutant receptors to a similar extent. One possibility to explain this observation is that 1 μm PDBu enhances phosphorylation of domains of the TP receptor outside of the C-terminal 22 amino acids. Indeed, hydroxyamino acids in the proximal C terminus as well as the second and third intracellular loops have favorable motifs for phosphorylation by PKC (11Namba T. Sugimoto Y. Hirata M. Hayashi Y. Honda A. Watabe A. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 35Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 63-81Google Scholar). Moreover, the absence of serines 321, 322, and 328 inhibits, but does not prevent, phosphorylation of the TP receptor by 100 nm PDBu. We therefore determined if treatment with 1 μm PDBu further enhances TP receptor phosphorylation compared with 100 nm PDBu. In these experiments, increasing PDBu from 100 nm to 1 μm did not significantly enhance phosphorylation of either wild type or mutant TP receptors. While we cannot exclude the possibility that small increases in receptor phosphorylation were not detected by our assay system, it seems more likely that 1 μm PDBu caused phosphorylation of other substrates leading to attenuation of TP receptor signaling. In this regard, PKC might: 1) phosphorylate and inactivate other downstream components of the signaling cascade or 2) phosphorylate and activate other regulatory mechanisms. Evidence for each of these possibilities has been demonstrated in other receptor systems. For example, activation of PKC by phorbol esters has been shown to phosphorylate and inactivate phospholipase-β (36Ryu S.H. Kim U.H. Wahl M.I. Brown A.B. Carpenter G. Huang K.P. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17941-17945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 can be phosphorylated by PKC in vitro resulting in 2-fold activation of the enzyme toward its substrate (37Chuang T.T. LeVine III, H. DeBlasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18660-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, PKC might regulate multiple components of the signaling cascade.U46619-stimulated IP3 generation was higher in mutant 1 compared with either wild type receptors or mutant 2. A possible explanation for this enhanced PI hydrolysis is that general kinase systems may inhibit TP receptor responsiveness under basal conditions. The absence of C-terminal serines might attenuate this inhibition by these kinase systems. In support of this hypothesis, we previously found that PKC inhibitors tended to enhance TP receptor responsiveness in cells that express an endogenous receptor for TxA2 (6Spurney R.F. Middleton J.P. Raymond J.R. Coffman T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 36: F467-FF78Google Scholar). Alternatively, the absence of regulatory serines may result in more sustained PI hydrolysis in mutant 1 compared with wild type receptors. In this regard, agonist-induced elevations in IP3 levels are prolonged in other receptor systems following removal of C-terminal regulatory domains (38Takano T. Zonda Z. Sakanaka C. Izumi T. Kameyama K. Haga K. Haga T. Kurokawa K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22453-22458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies will be needed to determine if either of these possibilities contributes to enhanced PI hydrolysis by TP receptors lacking serines 321, 322, and 328.Although the PKC inhibitor GF109203X did not completely prevent U46619-induced phosphorylation of the mouse TP receptor, agonist-induced phosphorylation was markedly reduced in the presence of the PKC inhibitor. In contrast to our findings, Habib et al.(17Habib A. Vezza R. Creminon C. Maclouf J. Fitzgerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) found that phosphorylation of human TP receptors was only modestly affected by GF109203X in HEK293 cells expressing TP receptor isoforms. Possibilities to explain these differing results include: 1) species specific differences in TP receptor regulation or 2) methodological differences between the studies. With regard to the latter, Habibet al. (17Habib A. Vezza R. Creminon C. Maclouf J. Fitzgerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) immunoprecipitated human TP receptors using isoform-specific anti-peptide antibodies from cells stably expressing high levels of TP receptors. In contrast, we studied phosphorylation of 12CA5-tagged TP receptors in a transient transfection system expressing more modest levels of TP receptor proteins. While it is not known if these methodologic differences can account for the differing results, both these studies were performed in artificial expression systems that might affect normal regulatory mechanisms. It will therefore be important to determine whether results using overexpression systems are generalizable to cells that endogenously express receptors for TxA2.Mutating serine at position 339 did not affect signaling or desensitization of the mouse TP receptor. While we did not directly study the effects of this mutation on receptor phosphorylation, serine 339 does not have a favorable motif for phosphorylation by PKC, protein kinase A, protein kinase G, or calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (34Spurney R.F. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 447AGoogle Scholar). In addition, this amino acid residue is not flanked by acid amino acids, which tend to be favored sites for phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (33Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). It therefore seems unlikely that serine 339 is an important target for phosphorylation by protein kinases.In summary, the present studies indicate that the absence of serines at positions 321, 322, and 328 inhibits both U46619- and PKC-induced desensitization of the TP receptor. Agonist-specific desensitization is associated with enhanced phosphorylation of receptor proteins. Both U46619-induced desensitization and phosphorylation are attenuated by either PKC inhibitors or the absence of serines 321, 322, and 328. PKC-induced desensitization caused by 100 nm PDBu is also associated with increased phosphorylation of receptor proteins. This PKC-mediated phosphorylation was inhibited by deleting serines, 321, 322, and 328. Finally, increasing the concentration of PDBu from 100 nm to 1 μm PDBu reduced responsiveness of wild type receptors and mutant receptors lacking serines 321, 322, and 328 without enhancing phosphorylation of either of the receptor proteins. These data suggest that 1) phosphorylation of C-terminal serines contributes to both agonist-specific and PKC-dependent desensitization of the TP receptor, and 2) PKC-induced desensitization of the TP receptor is complex and involves both phosphorylation of C-terminal serines as well as mechanisms that may not require direct phosphorylation of receptor proteins.

Physiol. 1992; 263: C864-C872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Spurney R.F. Middleton J.P. Raymond J.R. Coffman T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 36: F467-FF78Google Scholar). PKC-induced desensitization may involve direct phosphorylation of C-terminal domains of the TP receptor because 1) truncation of the C terminus attenuates desensitization mediated by direct activation of PKC by phorbol esters (16Spurney R.F. Coffman T.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 207-215PubMed Google Scholar), 2) PKC can phosphorylate C-terminal sequences of the TP receptor in vitro (5Kinsella B.T. O'Mahony J.O. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29914-29919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 3) phorbol ester-induced activation of PKC causes phosphorylation of the human TP receptor isoforms in the intact cell (17Habib A. Vezza R. Creminon C. Maclouf J. Fitzgerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). While the C terminus of the TP receptor contains several potential PKC phosphorylation sites, it is not known if phosphorylation of these domains contributes to TP receptor desensitization. We therefore constructed a mutant TP receptor (mutant 1) in which serines with favorable phosphorylation motifs for PKC (positions 321, 322, and 328) were replaced with either alanine or glycine. Both mutant and wild type receptors were epitope-tagged to permit rapid isolation of receptor proteins and assessment of their phosphorylation state. As an additional control, we compared desensitization of mutant 1 with another mutant receptor (mutant 2) in which a C-terminal serine lacking a consensus motif for phosphorylation by PKC (position 339) was replaced with glycine. Using these constructs, we investigated the role of C-terminal serines in regulating TP receptor responsiveness by direct phosphorylation of receptor proteins. DISCUSSIONTxA2 plays a key role in diseases affecting the heart, lungs, kidneys, and peripheral vascular system (1Fitzgerald G.A. Healy C. Daugherty J. FASEB. 1987; 46: 154-158Google Scholar, 2Oates J.A. Fitzgerald G.A. Jackson E.K. Knapp H.R. Roberts L.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 3Stork J.E. Rahman M.A. Dunn M.J. Am. J. Med. 1986; 80 (suppl 1A): 34-45Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Its effects are regulated by both PKC-dependent and PKC-independent mechanisms (4Dorn G.W. Davis M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C864-C872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Spurney R.F. Middleton J.P. Raymond J.R. Coffman T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 36: F467-FF78Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that C-terminal domains are required for regulation of the TP receptor by PKC (17Habib A. Vezza R. Creminon C. Maclouf J. Fitzgerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), perhaps by direct phosphorylation of the receptor protein (5Kinsella B.T. O'Mahony J.O. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29914-29919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Habib A. Vezza R. Creminon C. Maclouf J. Fitzgerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the role of the C-terminal serines in the rapid regulation of TP receptor responsiveness. We found that TP receptors lacking serines at positions 321, 322, and 328 in the C terminus are resistant to both U46619- and PKC-induced desensitization. Attenuated desensitization of the receptor mutant is associated with decreased phosphorylation of receptor proteins compared with wild type receptors. Taken together, these data suggest that both agonist-specific and PKC-induced desensitization of the TP receptor are mediated, at least in part, by phosphorylation of C-terminal hydroxyamino acids.The absence of the C-terminal serines at positions 321, 322, and 328 inhibited, but did not prevent, U46619-induced phosphorylation of the TP receptor. These findings indicate that the TP receptor is phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent fashion at residues other than serines 321, 322, and 328. It is likely that this agonist-dependent phosphorylation of mutant 1 is mediated by either receptor specific kinases or general kinase systems such PKC. With regard to the latter hypothesis, the specific PKC inhibitor GF109203X markedly attenuated, but did not prevent, U46619-induced phosphorylation of the TP receptor. Similar results were found using the more general kinase inhibitor staurosporine. Thus, the TP receptor is phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner by a staurosporine- and GF109203X-resistant kinase. These finding are consistent with the notion that receptor specific kinases may contribute to desensitization of the mouse TP receptor. This family of kinases has been shown to play a major key role in regulating receptor responsiveness in other receptor systems (7Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar, 8Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Although the consensus motif for phosphorylation by receptor-specific kinases is not fully elucidated, serine or threonine residues flanked by acid amino acids (D/ES/T or D/EXS/T) appear to be preferred substrates for G protein-coupled receptor kinases (33Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Motifs of this configuration are found in the third intracellular loop of the mouse, rat, and human TP receptor (9Abe T., K. Takeuchi N. Takahashi E. Tsutsumi Y. Taniyama Abe K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 644-657Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Hirata M. Hayashi Y. Ushikubi F. Yokota Y. Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Narumiya S.

Commun. 1992; 184: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and might play a role in regulating TP receptor responsiveness. Indeed, preliminary studies from this laboratory suggest that phosphorylation of the TP receptor by G protein-coupled receptor kinases may contribute to TP receptor regulation (34Spurney R.F. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 447AGoogle Scholar).The absence of serines 321, 322, and 328 prevented desensitization of TP receptors by 100 nm PDBu. In contrast, 1 μm PDBu caused desensitization of wild type and mutant receptors to a similar extent. One possibility to explain this observation is that 1 μm PDBu enhances phosphorylation of domains of the TP receptor outside of the C-terminal 22 amino acids. Indeed, hydroxyamino acids in the proximal C terminus as well as the second and third intracellular loops have favorable motifs for phosphorylation by PKC (11Namba T. Sugimoto Y. Hirata M. Hayashi Y. Honda A. Watabe A. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 35Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 63-81Google Scholar). Moreover, the absence of serines 321, 322, and 328 inhibits, but does not prevent, phosphorylation of the TP receptor by 100 nm PDBu. We therefore determined if treatment with 1 μm PDBu further enhances TP receptor phosphorylation compared with 100 nm PDBu. In these experiments, increasing PDBu from 100 nm to 1 μm did not significantly enhance phosphorylation of either wild type or mutant TP receptors. While we cannot exclude the possibility that small increases in receptor phosphorylation were not detected by our assay system, it seems more likely that 1 μm PDBu caused phosphorylation of other substrates leading to attenuation of TP receptor signaling. In this regard, PKC might: 1) phosphorylate and inactivate other downstream components of the signaling cascade or 2) phosphorylate and activate other regulatory mechanisms. Evidence for each of these possibilities has been demonstrated in other receptor systems. For example, activation of PKC by phorbol esters has been shown to phosphorylate and inactivate phospholipase-β (36Ryu S.H. Kim U.H. Wahl M.I. Brown A.B. Carpenter G. Huang K.P. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17941-17945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 can be phosphorylated by PKC in vitro resulting in 2-fold activation of the enzyme toward its substrate (37Chuang T.T. LeVine III, H. DeBlasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18660-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, PKC might regulate multiple components of the signaling cascade.U46619-stimulated IP3 generation was higher in mutant 1 compared with either wild type receptors or mutant 2. A possible explanation for this enhanced PI hydrolysis is that general kinase systems may inhibit TP receptor responsiveness under basal conditions. The absence of C-terminal serines might attenuate this inhibition by these kinase systems. In support of this hypothesis, we previously found that PKC inhibitors tended to enhance TP receptor responsiveness in cells that express an endogenous receptor for TxA2 (6Spurney R.F. Middleton J.P. Raymond J.R. Coffman T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 36: F467-FF78Google Scholar). Alternatively, the absence of regulatory serines may result in more sustained PI hydrolysis in mutant 1 compared with wild type receptors. In this regard, agonist-induced elevations in IP3 levels are prolonged in other receptor systems following removal of C-terminal regulatory domains (38Takano T. Zonda Z. Sakanaka C. Izumi T. Kameyama K. Haga K. Haga T. Kurokawa K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22453-22458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies will be needed to determine if either of these possibilities contributes to enhanced PI hydrolysis by TP receptors lacking serines 321, 322, and 328.Although the PKC inhibitor GF109203X did not completely prevent U46619-induced phosphorylation of the mouse TP receptor, agonist-induced phosphorylation was markedly reduced in the presence of the PKC inhibitor. In contrast to our findings, Habib et al.(17Habib A. Vezza R. Creminon C. Maclouf J. Fitzgerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) found that phosphorylation of human TP receptors was only modestly affected by GF109203X in HEK293 cells expressing TP receptor isoforms. Possibilities to explain these differing results include: 1) species specific differences in TP receptor regulation or 2) methodological differences between the studies. With regard to the latter, Habibet al. (17Habib A. Vezza R. Creminon C. Maclouf J. Fitzgerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) immunoprecipitated human TP receptors using isoform-specific anti-peptide antibodies from cells stably expressing high levels of TP receptors. In contrast, we studied phosphorylation of 12CA5-tagged TP receptors in a transient transfection system expressing more modest levels of TP receptor proteins. While it is not known if these methodologic differences can account for the differing results, both these studies were performed in artificial expression systems that might affect normal regulatory mechanisms. It will therefore be important to determine whether results using overexpression systems are generalizable to cells that endogenously express receptors for TxA2.Mutating serine at position 339 did not affect signaling or desensitization of the mouse TP receptor. While we did not directly study the effects of this mutation on receptor phosphorylation, serine 339 does not have a favorable motif for phosphorylation by PKC, protein kinase A, protein kinase G, or calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (34Spurney R.F. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 447AGoogle Scholar). In addition, this amino acid residue is not flanked by acid amino acids, which tend to be favored sites for phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (33Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). It therefore seems unlikely that serine 339 is an important target for phosphorylation by protein kinases.In summary, the present studies indicate that the absence of serines at positions 321, 322, and 328 inhibits both U46619- and PKC-induced desensitization of the TP receptor. Agonist-specific desensitization is associated with enhanced phosphorylation of receptor proteins. Both U46619-induced desensitization and phosphorylation are attenuated by either PKC inhibitors or the absence of serines 321, 322, and 328. PKC-induced desensitization caused by 100 nm PDBu is also associated with increased phosphorylation of receptor proteins. This PKC-mediated phosphorylation was inhibited by deleting serines, 321, 322, and 328. Finally, increasing the concentration of PDBu from 100 nm to 1 μm PDBu reduced responsiveness of wild type receptors and mutant receptors lacking serines 321, 322, and 328 without enhancing phosphorylation of either of the receptor proteins. These data suggest that 1) phosphorylation of C-terminal serines contributes to both agonist-specific and PKC-dependent desensitization of the TP receptor, and 2) PKC-induced desensitization of the TP receptor is complex and involves both phosphorylation of C-terminal serines as well as mechanisms that may not require direct phosphorylation of receptor proteins. TxA2 plays a key role in diseases affecting the heart, lungs, kidneys, and peripheral vascular system (1Fitzgerald G.A. Healy C. Daugherty J. FASEB. 1987; 46: 154-158Google Scholar, 2Oates J.A.

Previous studies have suggested that C-terminal domains are required for regulation of the TP receptor by PKC (17Habib A. Vezza R. Creminon C. Maclouf J. Fitzgerald G.A. J. Biol.

In the present study, we investigated the role of the C-terminal serines in the rapid regulation of TP receptor responsiveness. We found that TP receptors lacking serines at positions 321, 322, and 328 in the C terminus are resistant to both U46619- and PKC-induced desensitization. Attenuated desensitization of the receptor mutant is associated with decreased phosphorylation of receptor proteins compared with wild type receptors. Taken together, these data suggest that both agonist-specific and PKC-induced desensitization of the TP receptor are mediated, at least in part, by phosphorylation of C-terminal hydroxyamino acids. The absence of the C-terminal serines at positions 321, 322, and 328 inhibited, but did not prevent, U46619-induced phosphorylation of the TP receptor. These findings indicate that the TP receptor is phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent fashion at residues other than serines 321, 322, and 328. It is likely that this agonist-dependent phosphorylation of mutant 1 is mediated by either receptor specific kinases or general kinase systems such PKC. With regard to the latter hypothesis, the specific PKC inhibitor GF109203X markedly attenuated, but did not prevent, U46619-induced phosphorylation of the TP receptor. Similar results were found using the more general kinase inhibitor staurosporine. Thus, the TP receptor is phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner by a staurosporine- and GF109203X-resistant kinase. These finding are consistent with the notion that receptor specific kinases may contribute to desensitization of the mouse TP receptor. This family of kinases has been shown to play a major key role in regulating receptor responsiveness in other receptor systems (7Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev.

Motifs of this configuration are found in the third intracellular loop of the mouse, rat, and human TP receptor (9Abe T., K. Takeuchi N. Takahashi E. Tsutsumi Y. Taniyama Abe K. J. Clin.

Moreover, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 can be phosphorylated by PKC in vitro resulting in 2-fold activation of the enzyme toward its substrate (37Chuang T.T. LeVine III, H. DeBlasi A. J. Biol.

U46619-stimulated IP3 generation was higher in mutant 1 compared with either wild type receptors or mutant 2. A possible explanation for this enhanced PI hydrolysis is that general kinase systems may inhibit TP receptor responsiveness under basal conditions. The absence of C-terminal serines might attenuate this inhibition by these kinase systems. In support of this hypothesis, we previously found that PKC inhibitors tended to enhance TP receptor responsiveness in cells that express an endogenous receptor for TxA2 (6Spurney R.F. Middleton J.P.

Alternatively, the absence of regulatory serines may result in more sustained PI hydrolysis in mutant 1 compared with wild type receptors. In this regard, agonist-induced elevations in IP3 levels are prolonged in other receptor systems following removal of C-terminal regulatory domains (38Takano T. Zonda Z. Sakanaka C. Izumi T.

Further studies will be needed to determine if either of these possibilities contributes to enhanced PI hydrolysis by TP receptors lacking serines 321, 322, and 328. Although the PKC inhibitor GF109203X did not completely prevent U46619-induced phosphorylation of the mouse TP receptor, agonist-induced phosphorylation was markedly reduced in the presence of the PKC inhibitor. In contrast to our findings, Habib et al.(17Habib A. Vezza R. Creminon C. Maclouf J. Fitzgerald G.A. J. Biol.

It will therefore be important to determine whether results using overexpression systems are generalizable to cells that endogenously express receptors for TxA2. Mutating serine at position 339 did not affect signaling or desensitization of the mouse TP receptor. While we did not directly study the effects of this mutation on receptor phosphorylation, serine 339 does not have a favorable motif for phosphorylation by PKC, protein kinase A, protein kinase G, or calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (34Spurney R.F.

In summary, the present studies indicate that the absence of serines at positions 321, 322, and 328 inhibits both U46619- and PKC-induced desensitization of the TP receptor.

There is increasing evidence demonstrating that the rate of mRNA turnover and its regulation by effector agents play significant roles in controlling mRNA steady-state levels (1Brawerman G. Cell. 1987; 48: 5-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 2Ross J. Mol. Biol. Med. 1988; 5: 1-14PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated, for example, that not only does the relatively high steady-state level of LDH-A1 mRNA after β-adrenergic agonist or phorbol ester stimulation of rat C6 glioma cells reflect an increased transcriptional rate (3Huang D. Jungmann R.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 108: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 4Jungmann R.A. Kelley D.C. Miles M.F. Milkowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5312-5318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but that cells also have the ability to enhance the intracellular mRNA level by a mechanism that regulates the rate of degradation and half-life of mRNA through activation of protein kinases A and C (5Huang D. Hubbard C.J. Jungmann R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 994-1004PubMed Google Scholar). Selective mRNA stabilization in eukaryotic cells by stimulants of second messenger pathways, although not as widely and thoroughly studied as transcriptional control, is a regulated property that can determine the level of expression of a gene product. It is known that individual mRNAs within eukaryotic cells can display a wide range of stability, with half-lives ranging from a few minutes for highly regulated gene products, such as oncogenes, to over 24 h for very stable species, such as β-globin mRNA (1Brawerman G. Cell. 1987; 48: 5-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 6Hargrove J.L. Schmidt F.H. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2360-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 7Peltz S.W. Brewer G.

Lactate dehydrogenase A subunit mRNA is characterized by a relatively short half-life of about 45–55 min (4Jungmann R.A. Kelley D.C. Miles M.F. Milkowski D.M. J. Biol.

Agents that activate protein kinases A or C cause a 9-fold or 4-fold increase, respectively, in the half-life of LDH-A mRNA (4Jungmann R.A. Kelley D.C. Miles M.F. Milkowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5312-5318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Huang D. Hubbard C.J. Jungmann R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 994-1004PubMed Google Scholar). Recent analysis of the factors regulating stability of LDH-A mRNA has led to the recognition of a cAMP-stabilizing region (CSR), the presence of which in the 3′-UTR is absolutely necessary for cAMP regulation of LDH mRNA stability to occur (9Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the present report, we describe the extension of our studies toward elucidation of the molecular determinants of protein kinase A-regulated mRNA stability with focus on putative regulatory RNA-binding proteins that interact with the CSR. We identified at least four cytoplasmic proteins of about 96, 67, 52, and 50 kDa that show selective binding affinity for the CSR. Their CSR binding activity is significantly enhanced in rat C6 glioma cells stimulated with activators of protein kinase A and after phosphatase inhibition and functionally correlates with increased LDH-A mRNA stabilization. Materials used, synthesis of oligonucleotides, and cell culture methodology were previously described (9Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). DNA oligonucleotides were annealed, ligated into pGEM-3Zf(+), and used as templates for in vitrotranscription of 32P-labeled RNA probes according to standard procedures (10Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vols. 1–2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). Synthetic RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from OligoTherapeutics (Wilsonville, OR). All 32P-labeled RNA probes were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Shorter RNA oligonucleotide fragments (smaller than 30 bases) used in RNA-protein binding assays were 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Cells were collected, and the ribosome salt wash (RSW) was prepared as described by Ross (11Ross J. RNA Processing. A Practical Approach.in: Rickwood D. Hames B.D. II. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994Google Scholar). Proteinase inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mm), benzamidine (20 mm), leupeptin (50 mm), and pepstatin (1 μm) were added to all cell extracts. The extracts were stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. The RSW fraction contained 95% of the RNA-protein binding activity and was used for all further RNA-protein binding studies. Cell extracts (5–10 μg of RSW protein) were incubated in RNA binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, 40 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 μg/μl heparin, and 0.5 μg/μl yeast tRNA) with32P-labeled RNA probe (50,000 cpm) on ice for 1 h in a total volume of 25 μl. In the competition experiments, competitor RNA was added simultaneously with the 32P-labeled RNA probe. Electrophoresis was carried out on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (molar ratio of acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 60:1) in 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, and 1.2 mm EDTA buffer, pH 7.4, for 4 h at 4 °C. Gels were dried and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) film for autoradiography or to a phosphorimager plate (Fuji imaging plate, type BAS-III) for quantitation. RNA-protein binding reactions were carried out in 96-well tissue culture dishes. The binding conditions were identical to those described for the gel mobility shift. Samples were placed on ice and exposed to 600 mJ of ultraviolet light (5-cm distance for 15 min using a 254 nm ultraviolet lamp, model R-52G, Ultraviolet Products, Inc.). After irradiation, RNase A (0.2 μg/μl) and RNase T1 (40 units/μl) were added, and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The irradiated samples were adjusted to 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol and heated to 90 °C for 2 min. An aliquot was subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel along with prestained protein molecular size markers (rainbow marker, United States Biochemicals). The gels were fixed for 2 h in 50% methanol, followed by 2 h in 10% acetic acid, and for 1 h in 5% methanol/7% acetic acid, after which the gels were dried. In competition experiments, protein bands were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining to verify equal loading of protein and then dried. Gels were exposed to film for autoradiography or to an imaging plate for quantitation as described above. Twenty micrograms of protein extract were subjected to electrophoresis on 0.1% SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresis was carried out for about 5 h at a constant current of 100 mA. Proteins were subsequently blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes for 2 h at 1 mA using a Hoefer electrotransfer apparatus. To renature the proteins, nitrocellulose membranes were washed three times for 30 min at room temperature in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% Ficoll 400, and 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone). The blotted proteins were then probed with 32P-labeled RNA (104 cpm/ml) in binding buffer for 1 h. Unbound RNA probe was removed using three 2-min washes with binding buffer. The membrane was air-dried and exposed to film for 1–2 days. Stable transfection of glioma cells with the protein kinase A catalytic subunit expression vector pMT-CαEVneo (12Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15202-15207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and expression of catalytic subunit were carried out as described by us (5Huang D. Hubbard C.J. Jungmann R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 994-1004PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments attempting to identify the region of LDH-A 3′-UTR capable of binding cellular factor(s), we prepared truncated32P-labeled 3′-UTR fragments and used them as probes in various binding assays with protein extracts (RSW) prepared from unstimulated and Sp-cAMPS-stimulated rat C6 glioma cells. The location of the nucleotide probes within the LDH-A 3′-UTR is shown in Fig. 1. Gel retardation assays were carried out using two fragments consisting of bases 1103–1387 (Δ1) and bases 1383–1610 (Δ2) covering the upstream and downstream regions, respectively, of LDH 3′-UTR. As shown in Fig. 2, only fragment Δ2 gave a positive gel shift resulting in two Δ2-protein complexes. The intensity of the two shifted bands is markedly increased in experiments using a protein extract from Sp-cAMPS-stimulated glioma cells (Fig. 2, Δ2, lane cA). We were unable to identify binding of protein to fragment Δ1.Figure 2Electrophoretic band-shift analysis of truncated LDH-A 3′-UTR fragments with glioma cell RSW protein extract.Protein from the RSW fraction was tested for RNA binding activity with the 32P-labeled truncated 3′-UTR fragments shown in Fig. 1. Assays were performed in the absence (−) and presence of protein from unstimulated (C) and Sp-cAMPS-stimulated (cA) cells. The arrows indicate the position of two shifted RNA-protein complexes. For experimental details, see under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the protein binding region(s) of Δ2 more precisely, we prepared three slightly overlapping truncated fragments of Δ2, namely Δ3, Δ4, and Δ5, (see Fig. 1) and tested them for protein binding. Of the three fragments, only fragment Δ4, consisting of bases 1453–1527, gave a positive shift, the intensity of which was more pronounced in extracts from Sp-cAMPS-treated cells (Fig. 2,Δ4, compare lanes C and cA). Screening of further truncated fragments derived from Δ4 (fragments Δ6, Δ7, and Δ8) produced two shifted RNA-protein complexes that localized binding of protein to fragment Δ7; that is, to the 30-base region consisting of bases 1472–1501. It is important to note that the band density of the Δ7 complex with proteins from Sp-cAMPS-stimulated glioma cells was markedly increased. A concentration of 5 × 10−6m Sp-cAMPS was needed to elicit maximum stimulatory response as measured by band density. When binding of protein from Sp-cAMPS-stimulated cells to Δ7 was assayed as a function of increasing protein concentration, a linear increase of band density was observed (not shown). Competition experiments were carried out to define the specificity of RNA-protein complex formation. We allowed complexes to form in the presence of RNA probe and unlabeled competitor RNA. Under these conditions, Δ7·protein complex formation was competitively eliminated by increasing molar concentrations of unlabeled fragment Δ7 but not by the nonspecific Δ8 fragment (see Fig. 3 A), indicating the specificity of Δ7·protein complex formation. We used an additional specificity test by adding increasing concentrations of four different ribohomopolymers to the binding reaction. Fig. 3 B shows that poly(U) but not poly(A), poly(G), or poly(C) competitively inhibited the formation of the Δ7·protein complex. The ability of polyuridine to compete suggests that one of the features recognized by the protein binding activity is the presence of abundant uridine residues and that complex formation is at least partially dependent upon the presence of uridine bases. Indeed, the Δ7 fragment contains a relatively high percentage of uridine (about 50%, as compared with 28% of the entire LDH 3′-UTR). Whereas the above studies allowed us to identify the presence of 3′-UTR-binding protein(s) in rat C6 glioma cells and to define the binding region, more detailed characterization and determination of the number of putative protein factors usually requires the application of difficult and extensive protein purification procedures. A further disadvantage may be the inadvertent selection of only one particular protein form and not of others or even proteolytically modified proteins. In consideration of these potential problems, we have applied Northwestern blotting to identify glioma cell proteins that selectively bind to the 30-nucleotide Δ7 fragment. Cytoplasmic proteins from Sp-cAMPS-stimulated glioma cells were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto membranes, and probed with a 32P-labeled Δ7 fragment. Despite the great number of cytoplasmic proteins present in the gel seen after Coomassie Blue staining (not shown), only a limited number exhibited affinity for Δ7. After an 8-h autoradiography, several protein bands of approximately 67, 52, 50, 44, 42, and possibly 61 kDa are identifiable on the autoradiograph (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). A longer exposure time (24 h) reveals two additional bands at 96 and 70 kDa (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). Addition of fragment Δ6 as nonspecific competitor showed no effect on Δ7·protein binding (Fig. 4,A and B, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, fragment Δ7 as competitor at a 10-fold molar excess eliminated the 96-, 70-, 67-, 61-, 52-, and 50-kDa bands. Competition of the 44- and 42-kDa bands required a 100-fold higher molar concentration of competitor suggesting that the corresponding proteins exhibited a lower binding affinity. Based on these data, the 96-, 70-, 67-, 61-, 52-, and 50-kDa proteins can be identified as possessing high specific binding affinity for the Δ7 fragment. The 42- and 44-kDa bands are competed only at a relatively high concentration (100-fold) of Δ7. RNA-protein complexes can be formed by irradiation of cells or cell extracts with UV light (13Greenberg J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 5685-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Greenberg J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 715-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). UV-mediated RNA-protein complex formation was carried out as an experimental approach complementary to Northwestern blotting to ascertain the specificity of interaction of the proteins with the Δ7 fragment. UV irradiation of proteins in the RSW from unstimulated and Sp-cAMPS-stimulated glioma cells with different32P-labeled LDH 3′-UTR probes resulted in a covalent linkage of Δ4 and Δ7 with several cytoplasmic proteins of apparent molecular masses of 96, 67, 52, and 50 kDa (Fig. 5). When 3′-UTR fragments Δ3, Δ5, Δ6, and Δ8 were used as probes, no labeled RNA-protein complexes were detected. Complex formation of Δ4 and Δ7 with proteins from Sp-cAMPS-stimulated glioma cells was significantly more prominent than with proteins from unstimulated cells. We were unable by this method to identify the 70-, 61-, 44-, and 42-kDa bands seen by Northwestern blot analysis (see Fig. 4). We next addressed the question of RNA-protein binding specificity by analyzing the ability of homologous and nonhomologous RNAs to compete with 32P-labeled Δ7 for protein binding in UV cross-linking assays. Radiolabeled Δ7 fragment was mixed with increasing molar amounts of unlabeled competitor, combined with protein extract from Sp-cAMPS-stimulated cells, irradiated, and analyzed as described above. The results are shown in Fig. 6. Addition of a 5–50-fold molar excess of competitors Δ5 and Δ6 had no effect on Δ7·protein binding, and the appearance of the 96-,67-, 52-, and 50-kDa protein bands was not affected. In contrast, addition of as little as a 5-fold molar excess of fragments Δ4 and Δ7 reduced band density and a 50-fold molar excess efficiently eliminated all four protein bands. These results indicate that labeling of the four protein bands is the result of formation of specific complexes between proteins in the RSW and the 30-base Δ7 fragment. To examine the putative role of the secondary structure on Δ7·protein binding, we used two different experimental approaches. First, the Δ7 probe was heat-denatured at 95 °C for 10 min and either rapidly cooled in ice to retain a denatured structure or slowly cooled to room temperature (over a 40-min period) to allow reformation of the stable secondary conformation. If secondary structure of the 3′-UTR is vital for Δ7·protein complex formation, its disruption should abolish binding of protein. UV cross-linking analysis shows that this was indeed the case (Fig. 7). Whereas no heating (lane 3) or heating followed by slow cooling (lane 2) allowed binding of proteins to Δ7, rapid cooling of the Δ7 probe in ice prevented protein binding to the denatured probe (lane 1). In the second experimental approach, in which we also aimed to identify the base sequence of the binding site in more detail, Δ7 was modified by mutation in two different ways. First, we mutated bases 1486–1492 within the single-stranded loop structure of Δ7, resulting in mutation m1. The second mutation of Δ7 (m2) altered bases 1479–1483, which participate in forming the double-stranded stem of wild-type Δ7 (see predicted secondary structure in Fig. 13). Whereas mutation of bases 1486–1492 in m1 has no effect on secondary structure, mutation of bases 1479–1483 in m2 destroys the double-stranded stem and leads to a change of secondary structure. We then tested wild-type Δ7 and mutated constructs for protein binding. Fig. 8 shows that whereas wild-type Δ7 produced a positive gel shift, mutated fragment m1, as well as fragment m2, failed to form shifted RNA-protein complexes. This data indicates that Δ7·protein complex formation not only requires a correct primary single-stranded base sequence within the loop but also critically depends on an intact double-stranded stem-loop structure of Δ7. Mutational changes of other bases (for instance, bases 1498–1502) had no effect on Δ7·protein complex formation (not shown). The functional significance of these data becomes evident when considered together with our previous findings that similar mutational changes in either the primary sequence of the single-stranded loop or in the double-stranded stem of Δ7, e.g. conditions that abrogate Δ7·protein complex formation, abolish the effect of cAMP on mRNA stabilization (9Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests a functional relationship between RNA protein binding and mRNA stability.Figure 8Electrophoretic band-shift analysis of32P-labeled fragment Δ7 and mutated Δ7 fragments (m1 and m2) with RSW protein from Sp-cAMPS-stimulated cells. The base sequence of the fragments is listed, and mutated bases are underlined. Gel shift was carried out without protein (−) and with 5 μg of protein (Δ7, m1, and m2).

Two filled arrowsindicate consistently appearing complexes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In view of the above data suggesting the involvement of protein kinase A and thus protein phosphorylation in LDH-A mRNA stabilization, we investigated the effect of modulators of protein kinase A in more detail. Activation of protein kinase A with either forskolin (an activator of adenylyl cyclase (15Seamon K.B. Padgett W. Daly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3363-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar)) or Sp-cAMPS clearly led to a marked increase of binding activity (Fig. 9, lanes 3 and 4) as analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Furthermore, exposure of glioma cells to okadaic acid (20 nm) mimicked the effects of protein kinase A activators and resulted in a shifted Δ7·protein complex of similar density as the complexes obtained with extracts from Sp-cAMPS and forskolin-stimulated cells (Fig. 9,lane 5). Okadaic acid is one of the tumor promoters that does not activate protein kinase C (16Suganuma M. Fujiki H. Suguri H. Yoshizawa S. Hirota M. Nakayasu M. Ojika M. Wakamatsu K. Yamada K. Sugimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1768-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Rather, it is a powerful inhibitor of protein phosphatases-1 and -2A in vitro as well as in vivo (17Haystead T.A.J. Sim A.T.R. Carling D. Honnor R.C. Tsukitani Y. Cohen P. Hardie D.G. Nature. 1989; 337: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Treatment of Sp-cAMPS-stimulated glioma cell extracts with calf intestinal phosphatase markedly reduced Δ7·protein complex formation (Fig. 9, lane 6). These results strongly suggest that regulation of RNA-protein binding activity occurs through reversible phosphorylative modification of binding protein(s) involving protein kinase A in combination with okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatase. The effect of modulators of protein kinase A activity on Δ7·protein binding was additionally analyzed by UV-mediated cross-linking analysis. The results are shown in Fig. 10. Treatment of glioma cells with Sp-cAMPS, forskolin, or okadaic acid led to a marked increase of binding of the 96-, 67-, 52-, and 50-kDa proteins to the Δ7 fragment (Fig. 10, lanes 3–5). Treatment of cell extracts from Sp-cAMPS-stimulated cells with calf intestinal phosphatase significantly reduced the affinity of all four binding proteins to Δ7 (lane 6). In order to investigate the contribution of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A on Δ7·protein binding, the functional effect of overexpression of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A was analyzed by electrophoretic gel mobility shift and UV cross-linking. We used an expression vector, pMT-CαEVneo (12Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15202-15207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), designed to express the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A directed by the metallothionine promoter, the activity of which can be induced with metal ions (18Glanville N. Durnam D.M. Palmiter R.D. Nature. 1981; 292: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that following Zn2+treatment of a rat C6 glioma cell line stably transfected with pMT-CαEVneo, catalytic subunit activity levels increased about 7–8-fold as compared with untreated cells (5Huang D. Hubbard C.J. Jungmann R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 994-1004PubMed Google Scholar). Evaluation of the Δ7·protein binding activity under these experimental conditions showed a marked increase of shifted Δ7 -protein complex (see Fig. 11; compare lanes 4 and 5) with protein from transfected and Zn2+-induced cells. Protein from untransfected control cells showed little or no complex formation and shift with Δ7 under these conditions (Fig. 11, lanes 2 and 3). The effect of overexpression of the catalytic subunit on the binding of the Δ7 fragment to protein was also evaluated by UV cross-linking assay. As shown in Fig. 12, binding activity of Δ7 to the 96-, 67-, 52-, and 50-kDa proteins was markedly increased (lane 5) in pMT-CαEVneo-transfected and Zn2+-treated cells. Little or no binding of the proteins was observed in nontransfected cells (lanes 2 and 3) and in transfected cells that had not been treated with Zn2+ (lane 4). In the present study, we have continued our investigation into mechanisms that are involved with and responsible for the regulation of LDH-A mRNA stability by the protein kinase A pathway. In our previous report (9Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) we have identified a CSR in the 3′-UTR of LDH-A mRNA that is responsible for the stability regulation of LDH-A mRNA by the protein kinase A pathway. Here, we provide information concerning the presence, molecular size, and cAMP regulation of proteins that exhibit marked binding affinity for the CSR. The evidence was obtained by three independent experimental methods, i.e.electrophoretic gel shift analysis, UV-mediated cross-linking of RNA and protein, and Northwestern protein blotting assay. Specificity of the CSR-protein associations was demonstrated by competition assays using homologous and nonhomologous RNAs. Furthermore, competition experiments with different ribohomopolymers revealed that the four cytoplasmic CSR-binding proteins (CSR-binding proteins 1–4) require a uridine-rich binding region and depend upon a specific primary nucleotide sequence, as well as an unaltered secondary structure of CSR, to display selective binding activity. A key finding and novel feature of our data is the dependence of active CSR-protein binding upon phosphorylative modification of the CSR-binding proteins by protein kinase A and that their binding functionally correlates with LDH-A mRNA stabilization. Based on the experimental evidence, we propose that four CSR-binding proteins are the target of protein kinase A and that their interaction with the CSR plays a major role in regulating intracellular LDH-A mRNA levels via the protein kinase A signal pathway. In a previous paper (9Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) we have shown that the CSR is a functionally relevantcis-acting nucleotide region that responds to protein kinase A activation by stabilizing the LDH-A message, whereas agents that prevent phosphorylation abolish the stabilizing effect (9Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Additionally, agents such as the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid or calf intestinal phosphatase, which alter the state of phosphorylation of a given protein, markedly alter the binding affinity of the four CSR-binding proteins and stabilize, respectively destabilize LDH-A mRNA (9Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of intracellular protein kinase A catalytic subunit leads to a corresponding up-regulation of the affinity of CSR-binding proteins and concomitant increase of LDH-A mRNA stability (5Huang D. Hubbard C.J. Jungmann R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 994-1004PubMed Google Scholar, 9Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because mutations in the CSR negatively affect CSR-protein binding as well as mRNA stability (see Fig. 8 and Ref. 9Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it is a reasonable assumption that the CSR-binding proteins are potential candidates as mRNA stability regulators, the activity of which changes with the state of activity of protein kinase A. An increasing number of proteins, other than RNases, are being identified that are believed to act as trans-regulatory factors. These factors, in concert with cis-elements in the mRNA sequence, may be key proteins involved in the regulation of mRNA stability (for reviews, see Refs. 2Ross J. Mol. Biol. Med. 1988; 5: 1-14PubMed Google Scholar and 7Peltz S.W. Brewer G. Bernstein P. Hart P.A. Ross J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1991; 1: 99-126PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, the binding affinity of a family of proteins that bind to AU- and U-rich sequences can be modulated through reversible phosphorylation by protein kinases other than protein kinase A (19Gillis P. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3172-3177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Rajagopalan L.E. Malter J.S. J. Biol.

However, it should not be assumed that in each case of up-regulation of RNA-protein binding a concurrent stabilization of mRNA occurs. There are several examples demonstrating that mRNA-protein binding affinity varies inversely with a stabilizing effect on mRNA. For instance, Tholanikunnel et al. (29Tholanikunnel B.G. Granneman J.G. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12787-12793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported the β-adrenergic agonist-mediated induction of theM r 35,000 β-adrenergic receptor mRNA-binding protein, which binds to β2-adrenergic receptor mRNA, concurrently undergoing agonist-mediated destabilization. Likewise, adrenergic stimulation up-regulates binding of AUF1 to β-adrenergic receptor mRNA but simultaneously destabilizes the receptor mRNA. Whereas the above cited data are examples of up-regulation of RNA-protein binding by cAMP (26Pende A. Tremmel K.D. DeMaria C.T. Blaxall B.C. Minobe W.A. Sherman J.A. Bisognano J.D. Bristow M.R. Brewer G. Port J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8493-8501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), it is also of interest that Nachaliel et al. (30Nachaliel N. Jain D. Hod Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24203-24209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the identification of a 100-kDa protein, the affinity of which for a region of the PEPCK 3′-UTR is down-regulated by cAMP, even though PEPCK mRNA is stabilized by cAMP under the experimental conditions (31Hod Y. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7747-7752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of these data point to the complexities of establishing a unified mechanism of action of the protein kinase A signal transduction pathway in regulating mRNA stability. Considering the similarities of the response of the LDH-A, PEPCK, renin, α2A adrenergic receptor, SGLT1, and GLUT1 mRNAs to cAMP, namely mRNA stabilization (4Jungmann R.A. Kelley D.C. Miles M.F.

Chem. 1988; 263: 7747-7752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), some common features in the mechanism of mRNA stabilization and RNA-protein binding might be expected. However, despite some overall structural similarities (e.g. presence of U-rich regions), there appear to be no strict homologies between 3′-UTR sequences that are major determinants of mRNA stability (32Jones T.R. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4513-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar,33Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3123) Google Scholar). Comparison of 3′-UTR nucleotide sequences that are implicated in cAMP-mediated protein binding shows little sequence similarity other than the presence of seemingly randomly distributed tracts of polypyrimidine and AUUUA or AUUUU motifs (34Beale E.G. Chrapkiewicz N.B. Scoble H.A. Metz R.J. Quick D.P. Noble R.L. Donelson J.E. Biemann K. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10748-10760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which do not seem sufficient to destabilize mRNA or regulate stability bytrans-factors. However, comparison of the 3′-UTR of rat PEPCK mRNA, a messenger RNA that is stabilized by cAMP (31Hod Y. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7747-7752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with LDH-A 3′-UTR reveals a 15-base PEPCK 3′-UTR fragment (bases 1119–1135) (34Beale E.G. Chrapkiewicz N.B. Scoble H.A. Metz R.J. Quick D.P. Noble R.L. Donelson J.E. Biemann K. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10748-10760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which shows a high degree of base sequence similarity with LDH-A CSR, as follows: LDH CSR, 5′-CUGUAUUAUAUGUGU-3′; PEPCK, 5′-CUGUAU−AUAUGUGU-3′. In preliminary studies, we have tested the PEPCK fragment for protein binding using electrophoretic mobility shift assay with glioma cell protein extract. The autoradiographs showed two shifted bands that were specifically competed with the PEPCK fragment and LDH CSR (data not shown). However, because so far few data are available concerning the role of PEPCK 3′-UTR base sequences on stability of its mRNA other than the report by Nachaliel et al. (30Nachaliel N. Jain D. Hod Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24203-24209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the functional role, if any, of the 15-base PEPCK 3′-UTR in PEPCK mRNA stabilization remains to be elucidated. Our own studies have provided several lines of evidence indicating that the CSR-binding proteins possess specific affinity for the primary U-rich CSR sequence and that binding affinity is sensitive to changes in 3′-UTR secondary structure. First, CSR-protein complex formation is protein concentration-dependent and is prevented by excess specific but not by nonspecific competitor RNA. Second, mutation of primary structure (see Figs. 8 and 13) and elimination of the secondary structure by appropriate mutational changes of the CSR nucleotide sequence (at nucleotides 1478–1492) and by heat denaturation completely abolished binding of proteins. Fig. 13shows a computer-generated predicted secondary structure of a LDH-A 3′-UTR fragment (nucleotides 1450–1523) containing the CSR. The position of the CSR was predicted to be within a 12-nucleotide single-stranded loop of a larger stem-loop structure. Mutations of the single-stranded primary sequence in the loop (nucleotides 1486–1492), which should not alter RNA secondary structure, resulted in decreased protein binding (see Fig. 8). Furthermore, when secondary structure was destroyed by heat denaturation or mutation of bases 1479–1483 in the double-stranded stem structure, protein binding was severely impaired. This finding may have significant functional consequences because we have shown that identical base mutations in the loop prevented stabilization of LDH-A mRNA by cAMP (9Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, our data indicate that optimal binding of proteins to the CSR, as well as a functional CSR, depends on stringent nucleotide sequence requirements in the loop, as well as proper conformation of the stem-loop structure. The LDH-A CSR primary base sequence may not per se be a general consensus motif for cAMP regulation of mRNA stability, but it is conceivable that the overall secondary/tertiary structure allowed by an element such as CSR, together with specific binding proteins, possesses properties that are critical in determining mRNA stability. For instance, sequences of differing primary nucleotide structure in cAMP-stabilized mRNAs may allow the formation of similar or identical conformations that have the ability to recognize and specifically interact with trans-regulatory phosphoproteins. However, until the various 3′-UTR-binding proteins are identified and characterized, their specific functional roles in mRNA stabilization and the significance of their phosphorylative modification by protein kinase A remain to be elucidated."

To evaluate the functional consequence of PIMT-catalyzed methylation on the stability of isoaspartyl-containing proteins in cells,Xenopus laevis oocytes were microinjected with both deamidated and nondeamidated forms of recombinant chicken calmodulin (CaM) containing a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at its N terminus. Processing of HA-CaM was monitored by electrophoretic analysis and Western blotting of oocyte extracts. The experiments indicate that deamidated HA-CaM is degraded after microinjection, while nondeamidated HA-CaM is stable. Kinetic analysis is consistent with the entry of microinjected HA-CaM into two intracellular pools with distinct hydrolytic stabilities. The larger, more stable pool may consist of HA-CaM bound to the heterogeneous pool of oocyte CaM binding proteins detected by an overlay procedure. Enzymatic methylation of deamidated HA-CaM with purified PIMT prior to injection results in its stabilization. Conversely, inhibition of endogenous oocyte PIMT with sinefungin, a nonhydrolyzable analog of S-adenosylhomocysteine, increases the rate of deamidated HA-CaM degradation.

All living cells contain enzymatic systems that maintain a functional pool of cellular proteins by catalyzing the refolding, repair, or removal of structurally damaged proteins (1Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2396) Google Scholar, 2Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar). In some cases, these enzymes recognize modified or abnormal amino acid residues that have arisen spontaneously during the aging of the protein (3Clarke S. Annu. Rev.

One such activity is a protein protein-l-isoaspartate(d-aspartate)O-methyltransferase (PIMT; EC2.1.1.77)1 that appears to be of ancient origin, with homologues identified in bacterial, plant, and animal cells (5Johnson B.A. Ngo S.Q.

Physiol. 1997; 117B: 379-385Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All of the widely distributed PIMT activities specifically recognize l-isoaspartyl residues that can spontaneously arise from either the deamidation of protein asparaginyl residues or the isomerization of protein aspartyl residues (7Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Stephenson R.C. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6164-6170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated for several proteins, including epidermal growth factor, calmodulin (CaM), and calbindin (9Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8646-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), that the appearance of an isoaspartyl site is correlated with a loss of normal enzyme function. It has been proposed that PIMT-catalyzed carboxyl methylation of isoaspartyl sites is the first step in either the repair or degradation of the damaged protein substrate (3Clarke S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Brennan T.V. Anderson J.W. Jia Z. Waygood E.B. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24586-24595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence supporting a repair function has come from studies of PIMT-catalyzed methylation in vitro. In several experiments, isoaspartyl-containing synthetic peptides were nearly stoichiometrically converted to the corresponding aspartyl-containing form following carboxyl methylation by PIMT and the ensuing internal rearrangements associated with hydrolysis of the ester, involving a succinimide intermediate (13McFadden P.N. Clarke S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2595-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 14Johnson B.A. Murray Jr., E.D. Clarke S. Glass D.B. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5622-5629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The repair process, however, lacked the strict stereochemical specificity and efficiency characteristic of enzymatic systems, requiring multiple rounds of methylation and demethylation to achieve full repair. Experimental evidence has also been presented implicating PIMT in the repair of damaged protein substrates. When deamidated, isoaspartyl-containing forms of the bacterial HPr phosphocarrier protein (12Brennan T.V. Anderson J.W. Jia Z. Waygood E.B. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24586-24595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or calmodulin (9Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used as substrates for the PIMT, carboxyl methylation partially restored enzymatic activity that had been lost as a consequence of the original deamidation. Significantly, however, full enzymatic activity was not recovered, and isoaspartyl residues were not replaced by the original asparaginyl residues. At the present time, there is no evidence supporting the other proposed role for the PIMT in marking damaged substrates for degradation, although proteolytic destruction of damaged proteins would also serve to maintain a functional pool of cellular proteins. Based on the available evidence, which is all derived from experiments using purified systems (9Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13McFadden P.N. Clarke S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1987; 262: 5622-5629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it would be premature to exclude a physiological role for the PIMT in the destruction of damaged isoaspartyl-containing proteins. Purified systems may lack hitherto unidentified activities that participate in the processing of isoaspartyl-containing proteins within cells. From these studies, it has become clear that elucidation of the biochemical pathway initiated by carboxyl methylation would be assisted by the development of a model for studying the processing of methylated proteins in intact cells. We have chosen Xenopus oocytes for a model because these cells possess a functional excess of PIMT similar to those activities previously studied in more detail in mammalian systems (15O'Connor C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10398-10403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Romanik E.A. O'Connor C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14050-14056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and because these large cells are easily injected with macromolecules. For the present studies, we constructed an epitope-tagged CaM (17Szymanska G. O'Connor M.B. O'Connor C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) as a model substrate, enabling us to follow its fate after microinjection into oocytes. CaM was chosen for several reasons. CaM acts as a physiological methyl acceptor in several cell types, including both the human erythrocyte (18Brunauer L.S. Clarke S. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 19Runte L. Jürgensmeier C.U. Söling H.D. FEBS Lett. 1982; 147: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and theXenopus oocyte (20Desrosiers R.R. Romanik E.A. O'Connor C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Careful measurement of the methylation stoichiometry in the two cells has revealed that about 0.02–0.03% of the CaM is carboxyl methylated at steady state, reflecting the low abundance of isoaspartyl residues generally in proteins. Peptide mapping of erythrocyte CaM (21Ota I.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 279: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) indicated that physiological methylation occurs at isoaspartyl residues in the central helix and calcium-binding sites as well as near the N terminus. Prolonged incubation of native CaM at the near physiological conditions of pH 7.4 and 37 °C for 2 weeks in vitro produces isoaspartyl residues at these same sites (22Ota I.M. Clarke S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4020-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Potter S.M. Henzel W.J. Aswad D.W. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1648-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), indicating that it is possible to approximate the naturally occurring age-related changes in CaM in the test tube. We have used the same protocols to produce isomerized variants of an epitope-tagged CaM for microinjection into oocytes. The presence of a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope is advantageous in allowing the injected substrate to be detected by immunochemical methods (17Szymanska G. O'Connor M.B. O'Connor C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This experimental design has allowed us to evaluate potential roles of PIMT-catalyzed methylation in cellular protein metabolism. Our results show that the presence of isoaspartyl residues severely compromises the stability of CaM in oocyte cytoplasm. PIMT-catalyzed methylation of damaged HA-CaM prior to microinjection increases its stability, while inhibition of the endogenous PIMT activity decreases the stability of injected HA-CaM. These results are most consistent with the involvement of PIMT in the structural repair of damaged proteins in cells and do not support a role for PIMT in targeting damaged proteins for proteolysis.

Nitrocellulose Enhance-100 membranes were purchased from American Bioanalytical (Natick, MA). Sexually mature Xenopus females were obtained fromXenopus Express (Homosassa, FL). Epitope-tagged CaM containing the HA epitope YPYDVPDYA at its N terminus (17Szymanska G. O'Connor M.B. O'Connor C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was prepared from E. coli N-4830 cells containing a temperature-sensitive cI repressor protein. To induce recombinant HA-CaM synthesis, bacterial cultures were grown overnight at the permissive temperature of 30 °C, and the cultures were then diluted to an A 600 of 0.4–0.5 with medium prewarmed to the nonpermissive temperature of 41 °C to induce HA-CaM synthesis. After growth at 41 °C for 2 h, bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 8000 × g. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.02 volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme. HA-CaM was purified from the cell lysate through the phenyl-Sepharose step essentially as described (24Putkey J.A. Slaughter G.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions eluting from the phenyl-Sepharose column with EDTA were applied to an additional phenyl-Sepharose (1 ml of packed resin/ml of pooled fractions) column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mmCaCl2, 500 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 5 volumes of starting buffer, after which HA-CaM was eluted with the buffer containing 1 mm EDTA. Deamidated variants of HA-CaM were prepared by incubating solutions of 100 μm HA-CaM in 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 2 weeks (9Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control HA-CaM was incubated in the same buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 in the place of EDTA. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis was performed on 15% gels using a discontinuous buffer system containing 2 mm EDTA as described (9Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Denaturing SDS-PAGE on 15% gels was carried according to the protocol described by Laemmli and Favre (25Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). CaM binding proteins in the oocyte extract were detected using a modified CaM overlay procedure (17Szymanska G. O'Connor M.B. O'Connor C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 26Slaughter G.R. Means A.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 139: 133-144Google Scholar) in the presence of either 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA. Western blotting was performed using a primary antibody directed against the HA epitope and using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as a secondary antibody, as described previously (17Szymanska G. O'Connor M.B. O'Connor C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Bound antibody was detected using the Lumi-Glo chemiluminescent detection system, and the intensity of the bands was determined by densitometry employing a scanning laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Quantitation of relative band densities was performed using the ImageQuant software program. Experimental procedures were adjusted so that all data fell within the linear response range of the chemiluminescent detection system. The amounts of HA-CaM recovered in the oocyte extract were estimated from a standard curve of known amounts of HA-CaM. The concentration of HA-CaM in the standard sample was established by amino acid analysis. Protein samples were separated under nondenaturing conditions as described above and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were stained briefly with 0.1% Amido Black in 45% methanol, 2% acetic acid to visualize the proteins. Segments containing the proteins of interest were excised from the blot and cut into 1 × 1-mm pieces, which were immersed in 20 μl of digestion buffer consisting of 1% octylglucopyranoside, 10% acetonitrile, and 100 mmammonium bicarbonate. An 0.5-μl aliquot of trypsin (0.25 μg/ml) was added, and the digest was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Samples were prepared for MALDI-TOF analysis by mixing a 0.3-μl aliquot of the digestion mixture with 0.5 μl of matrix (10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile) and allowing the mixture to air dry on the sample grid. MALDI-TOF analysis was performed on a PerSeptive Biosystems Linear Voyager Biospectrometry workstation using external calibrants of angiotensin, MH+ of 1297.5 Da and ACTH (18Brunauer L.S. Clarke S.

Spectra were acquired in positive ion mode using an accelerating voltage of 30 kV and a laser power close to threshold. Oocytes were manually dissected from ovaries and incubated in OR-2 saline (27Wallace R.A. Jared D.W. Dumont J.N. Sega M.W. J. Exp. Zool. 1973; 184: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) as described (28O'Connor C.M. Germain B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10404-10411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 46 nl of solutions containing various concentrations of HA-CaM as indicated in the figure legends. In some experiments, oocytes were injected with 46 nl of 2.5 mm sinefungin in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 30 min prior to injection with HA-CaM. Microinjected oocytes were incubated in OR-2 solution at 20 °C in groups of 5 or 10 for various lengths of time. The cells were routinely observed with a microscope to check for damaged oocytes, which were discarded. At the end of each incubation period, groups of oocytes were washed three times in homogenization medium containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.9, and then rapidly frozen in 10 volumes of the same medium. Oocytes were stored in this medium at −80 °C until used for biochemical analysis. For analysis, frozen oocytes were rapidly thawed and homogenized by trituration through a micropipet tip. The soluble protein fraction was prepared by centrifuging the homogenate at 100,000 × gfor 20 min. The protein concentration in the cytosolic fraction was determined by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The acidic isozyme of PIMT was purified from calf brain as described (30Aswad D.W. Deight E.A. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 1702-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To measure methyl-accepting activities, CaM and HA-CaM samples were incubated with 22 nm PIMT, 10 μm S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (adjusted to a final specific activity of 1 Ci/mmol with nonradioactive AdoMet) in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, for 2 h at 37 °C in a final volume of 25 μl. Protein carboxyl [3H]methyl esters were quantified as trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material converted to [3H]methanol by base treatment, as described previously (16Romanik E.A. O'Connor C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14050-14056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each assay was done in triplicate and included a negative control lacking substrate, representing the assay background. Carboxyl methylated HA-CaM was prepared for microinjection using the same procedures, except that radioactivity was omitted from the mixture. Previous experiments have shown that the addition of the HA epitope to the N terminus of CaM has no effect on the enzymatic activity of CaM, suggesting that HA-CaM could be used to model CaM functions (17Szymanska G. O'Connor M.B. O'Connor C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We have been interested in using CaM as a model substrate for PIMT because of the ease with which CaM can be converted into isoaspartyl-containing variants under the physiologically relevant conditions of a 2-week incubation at pH 7.4 and 37 °C in the presence of EGTA (9Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ota I.M. Clarke S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4020-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31Johnson B.A. Shirokawa J.M. Aswad D.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Following such incubations, one detects new electrophoretic variants that migrate more slowly on nondenaturing gels than native CaM due to the spontaneous generation of methyl-accepting isoaspartyl residues at several sites in the protein, including the calcium-binding sites (9Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Desrosiers R.R. Romanik E.A. O'Connor C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order for HA-CaM to effectively serve as a model for carboxyl methylation, it was necessary to demonstrate that the HA epitope did not adversely affect the spontaneous deamidation of CaM to these methyl-accepting forms. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1, we have used the same nondenaturing gel system to characterize CaM and HA-CaM variants produced during incubation of the samples for 14 days at pH 7.4 and 37 °C in the presence of either 1 mm CaCl2 (lanes 1 and 3) or 1 mm EDTA (lanes 2 and 4). In both cases, incubation in the presence of EDTA generates electrophoretically distinct forms that migrate more slowly than the native forms. Essentially identical results are obtained with the CaM and HA-CaM samples, except that the HA-tagged forms migrate more slowly than their untagged counterparts. All of the variants generated by prolonged incubation of HA-CaM are readily detected using a monoclonal antibody to the HA epitope on immunoblots (Fig. 1, right panel). In order for “aged” HA-CaM (Fig. 1) to serve as a model substrate for PIMT-dependent metabolism in cells, it was important to establish that the 2-week incubation did not produce changes in amino acids other than isoaspartyl generation. It was also important to eliminate the possibility that some of the new electrophoretic variants detected in Fig. 1 represented proteolytic fragments of CaM or HA-CaM, particularly in light of the heightened susceptibility of CaM to proteolytic cleavage in the presence of EGTA (32Klee C.B. Vanaman T.C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 213-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 33Walsh M. Stevens F.C. Kuznicki J. Drabikowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7440-7443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides were therefore prepared from the major variant in each sample in Fig. 1, and the fragments were analyzed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The mass spectrum for the peptide mixture obtained from native CaM identifies that protein as authentic CaM. All of the masses detected in Fig. 2 A correspond to the singly charged ions of known tryptic fragments, as indicated. In addition, two peptides, corresponding to residues 127–148 (MH+ = 2493) and residues 38–74 (MH+ = 4071), are associated with oxidized methionyl variants 16 or 32 mass units larger than the parent peptide, in good correspondence to the number of methionyl residues in the peptide. These oxidized methionyl variants are characteristically generated during the MALDI-TOF analyses. The addition of the HA epitope to CaM produces a set of tryptic fragments (Fig. 2 B) consistent with the presence of the sequence AYPYDVPDYAM that was added to the N terminus of CaM during the construction of HA-CaM (17Szymanska G. O'Connor M.B. O'Connor C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The ions MH+ = 1523, MH+ = 2461, and MH+ = 3350, corresponding to residues 1–13, 1–24, and 1–30 of native CaM, are missing from the HA-CaM samples, to be replaced with ions MH+ = 2810, MH+ = 3746, and MH+ = 4632. The mass spectra obtained from tryptic digests of deamidated CaM and deamidated HA-CaM are largely similar to those obtained with their respective nondeamidated counterparts, with two exceptions. Newly created tryptic ions MH+ = 1598 and MH+ = 3822 (indicated withasterisks in Fig. 2, C and D), corresponding to residues 78–90 and 116–148 of CaM, are detected in both deamidated CaM (Fig. 2 A) and deamidated HA-CaM (Fig. 2 D). These fragments are consistent with a lack of cleavage after Arg86 and Arg126, suggesting that deamidation reduces susceptibility to tryptic cleavage at these two sites. Overall, the incubation used to produce deamidated CaM does not alter the masses of any identified ions, suggesting that changes are limited to aspartyl isomerization and asparaginyl deamidation (21Ota I.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 279: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 34Johnson B.A. Shirokawa J.M. Hancock W.S. Spellman M.W. Basa L.J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14262-14271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35Ota I.M. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 54-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the resolution of MALDI-TOF analysis is not sufficiently sensitive to confirm the change of 1 mass unit that would be expected from the conversion of an asparaginyl residue to an aspartyl residue. Significantly, ions representing the intact N-terminal and C-terminal peptides of CaM can be identified in all samples, confirming that proteolytic digestion is not responsible for the altered electrophoretic variants generated during the 2-week incubation of CaM used to produce deamidated CaM. This is particularly important in light of a previous report that a brain carboxypeptidase produces a shortened CaM with enhanced methyl-accepting activity (36Murtaugh T.J. Wright L.S. Siegel F.L. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because of its unique specificity for protein d-aspartyl andl-isoaspartyl residues, the PIMT has proven to be a useful tool for detecting isoaspartate in peptides and proteins (37Bischoff R. Kolbe H.V.Y. J. Chromatogr. 1994; 662: 261-278Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 38Liu D.T. Trends Biotechnol. 1992; 10: 364-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To determine if the isoaspartyl content of HA-CaM is increased by prolonged incubation in the absence of calcium, we compared the specific methyl-accepting activities of the CaM and HA-CaM produced during a 2-week incubation at 37 °"

The structural determinants controlling splice selection are examined in differentiating C2-C12 muscle cells by selective intron deletion from and site-directed mutagenesis in the Ache gene. Transfection of a plasmid lacking two invariant introns (introns II and III) within the open reading frame of the Ache gene, located 5′ of the alternative splice region, resulted in alternatively spliced mRNAs encoding enzyme forms not found endogenously in myotubes. Retention of either intron II or III is sufficient to control the tissue-specific pre-mRNA splicing pattern prevalent in situ. Further deletions and branch point mutations revealed that upstream splicing, but not the secondary structure of AChE pre-mRNA, is the determining factor in the splice selection. In addition, deletion of the alternative intron between the splice donor site and alternative acceptor sites resulted in aberrant upstream splicing. Thus, selective splicing of AChE pre-mRNA during myogenesis occurs in an ordered recognition sequence in which the alternative intron influences the fidelity of correct upstream splicing, which, in turn, determines the downstream splice selection of alternative exons.

Formation of a contiguous open reading frame in eukaryotic mRNA by elimination of intervening sequences (introns) through splicing is a critical step in biosynthesis of functional proteins (1Green M.R.

Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA in various cell types generates protein isoforms with distinct activities or tissue-specific distribution patterns during development (4Andreadis A. Gallego M.E. Nadal-Ginard B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 207-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 5Smith C.W. Patton J.G. Nadal-Ginard B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 527-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). About 15% of mammalian gene mutations associated with disease states are reported to affect RNA splicing signals (2Adams M.D. Rudner D.Z. Rio D.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, especially in mammalian cells, are not well understood (1Green M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 2Adams M.D. Rudner D.Z. Rio D.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 3Moore M. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 303-358Google Scholar). One such example is the selective splicing of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)1 pre-mRNA during myogenesis. The primary function of AChE is to terminate the action of the released neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the central and peripheral nervous systems. AChE exists in multiple molecular forms whose catalytic subunits are encoded by alternatively spliced mRNAs from a single gene (6Li Y. Camp S. Rachinsky T.L. Getman D. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23083-23090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Massoulie J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.M. Prog.

The alternative gene products differ in sequence only at their very carboxyl termini, resulting in enzyme forms that differ in amphiphilic character, extent of oligomerization, and cellular disposition, but exhibit identical catalytic parameters. Within the open reading frame of the mammalian Ache gene are found three invariant exons (exons 2–4) that encode the amino-terminal 536 amino acids common to all forms of the enzyme. These invariant exons are alternatively spliced to one of three downstream sequences encoding distinct carboxyl termini and generating tissue-specific molecular forms of AChE (10Li Y. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5790-5797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exon 4 to 6 spliced mRNA, encoding catalytic subunits that assemble as monomers, dimers and tetramers, is the major species found in mammalian skeletal muscle and brain (10Li Y. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5790-5797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Luo Z.D. Pincon-Raymond M. Taylor P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The second splice option is extension of exon 4 to its 3′ intron, yielding a monomeric, hydrophilic species found in embryonic skeletal muscle and cells of hematopoietic origin (6Li Y. Camp S. Rachinsky T.L. Getman D. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23083-23090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Li Y. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The third splice option is the exon 4 to 5 splice that encodes an amphiphilic, glycophospholipid-linked form of AChE typically expressed in hematopoietic cells as well as pituitary and certain neuronal cells in culture (10Li Y. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5790-5797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Splicing of pre-mRNA involves the binding of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) to conserved intronic sequences on pre-mRNA. The binding of U1 snRNP and U2AF to the 5′ splice site and the polypyrimidine tract, respectively, promotes the binding of U2 snRNP to the branch point. The next step is the formation of spliceosome complex through the binding of the U4/U5/U6 snRNPs followed by a catalytic reaction resulting in a lariat formation between the 5′ splice site and the adenosine residue at the branch point. This, in turn, activates the cleavage of 3′ splice site and brings the spliced exons together (3Moore M. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 303-358Google Scholar, 13Black D.L. RNA. 1995; 1: 763-771PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fu X.D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, intronic sequences play an important role in molecular interactions during constitutive splicing. One mechanism for the control of alternative splicing involves interaction of tissue or cell-specific factors with specificcis-elements in pre-mRNA (14Fu X.D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction may influence the relative strength and, consequently, recognition of a given splice site as demonstrated in regulated splicing in vitro (13Black D.L. RNA. 1995; 1: 763-771PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fu X.D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar). A large body of evidence indicates that flanking intronic sequences are important in such an interaction (1Green M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 15Helfman D.M. Roscigno R.F. Mulligan G.J. Finn L.A. Weber K.S. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 98-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). One such example is the splicing of rat β-tropomyosin in which downstream intron splicing events are critical in upstream alternative splicing regulation (16Helfman D.M. Ricci W.M. Finn L.A. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1627-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Since a single gene encodes all tissue-specific forms of AChE, tissue-specific factors interacting with specificcis-elements can be expected to regulate alternative splicing. Within the Ache gene, three invariant introns are found upstream of the alternative splice region where three splice options occur from a donor site. Two of the upstream invariant introns are located within the open reading frame of the gene (Fig. 1). As the first step toward understanding the alternative splicing of AChE pre-mRNA, we examined the role of these introns in the regulation of AChE pre-mRNA splicing during myogenesis. Fortuitously, the mammalian Ache gene is relatively compact with only 6 kilobase pairs separating the CAP site for transcription and the first polyadenylation signal. This enabled us to transfect the entireAche genomic DNA with its accompanying promoter as well as specified deletion constructs directly into differentiating myocytes. Cell culture supplies were from Fisher, and components of culture medium were from Life Technologies, Inc. [32P]UTP (specific activity: 800 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Research Products (Wilmington, DE). Sucrose (ultrapure) was from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). Other chemicals were from Sigma. Mouse myoblast C2-C12 cells and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) were from American Type Culture Collection. C2-C12 cells were cultured at 37 °C, with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% chick embryo extract and 1% penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B stock solution (Antibiotic-Antimycotic, Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were passed either two or three times before plating onto 100-mm culture dishes. Differentiation from myoblasts to myotubes was induced at about 70% confluence by replacing the high serum medium with DMEM containing 2% horse serum. HEK cells were maintained under the same conditions as the C2-C12 cells, except that the culture medium contained 10% fetal bovine serum. Constructions of Achegenomic expression plasmids with the endogenous promoter and their branch point mutants are described in the legends to Figs. 1 and 3. cDNA expression constructs under CMV promoters were described previously (10Li Y. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5790-5797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proliferating C2-C12 myoblasts transfect poorly, so to optimize transfection efficiencies, cells were transfected 1 day after induction of differentiation. Transfection of 10 μg/100-mm plate of the designated expression plasmids was performed by standard calcium phosphate procedures followed by glycerol shock 4–5 h later (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Codl Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.30-16.81Google Scholar). In some experiments, LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.)-mediated transfection with 5 μg of DNA/plate was utilized. Control cells were mock-transfected with the plasmid vectors without the Acheinserts. Cells were allowed to differentiate for 2–3 additional days in normal differentiation medium. To measure AChE secreted into the medium, cells were differentiated in serum-free DMEM after transfection. To correct differences in transfection efficiency, 2–5 μg of a pcDNA3 expression vector containing the Escherichia coli lacZ gene (18Kalnins A. Otto K. Ruther U. Muller-Hill B. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) were co-transfected, and β-galactosidase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically. HEK cells were transfected by standard calcium phosphate method without glycerol shock. Total RNA was extracted from previously transfected myotubes as described previously (19Luo Z. Fuentes M.E. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27216-27223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or with TRIZol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), treated with 10 units of RQ1 DNase (Promega) for 30 min at 37 °C, and stored at −20 °C. AChE mRNA species were quantified by RNase protection assays as described (11Luo Z.D. Pincon-Raymond M. Taylor P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For detecting exon 4 to 6 spliced mRNA, a mouse Ache cDNA containing the sequence of exons 4 and 6 was subcloned in a Bluescript SK II plasmid and linearized withXhoI. After in vitro transcription with [32P]UTP, a 458-bp labeled antisense cRNA probe was used for RNase protection. Similarly, for detecting exon 4 and its retained 3′ intron, a XhoI to ApaI fragment of Ache genomic DNA was subcloned into Bluescript SK II and linearized with XhoI. Upon transcription it gives rise to a 464-bp antisense probe. For detecting exon 4 to 5 spliced species, an antisense probe was transcribed from a MscI linearized mouse AChE cDNA containing the exon 4 to 5 spliced sequence in an expression vector (pRc/CMV, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). To normalize for transfection efficiencies, an antisense probe of β-galactosidase was transcribed from a BamHI to SstI fragment of the E. coli lacZ gene, subcloned into Bluescript SK II, and linearized with Eco47III. A tRNA lane was included in each RNase protection assay to ensure the complete digestion of the free probes. Molecular masses of the protected probes were estimated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels, and protected bands were exposed to BioMax films (Kodak) and quantified by densitometry (UltroScan XL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). AChE was extracted from rinsed C2-C12 myotubes in 0.01 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 m NaCl, 0.01 m EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and a spectrum of protease inhibitors (20Silman I. Lyles J.M. Barnard E.A. FEBS Lett. 1978; 94: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Culture media were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 30 min to remove cell debris. AChE in the media was concentrated over 10-fold in Centriprep 30 concentrators (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). Enzyme activity was determined at room temperature in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) using 0.05–0.1 ml of cell extract (21Ellman G. Courtney K.D. Andres Jr., V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21719) Google Scholar). Exogenous AChE activity was estimated by subtracting the activity in mock-transfected cells from the total activity in transfected cells. Differences in transfection efficiency were corrected from the ratios of AChE to β-galactosidase activities. AChE species were distinguished on the basis of their sedimentation coefficients in 5–30% sucrose gradients as described previously (22Duval N. Massoulie J. Bon S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Coleman B.A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4410-4416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extracts or concentrated media were layered onto sucrose gradients containing 0.01m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 m NaCl, 0.01 m EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100 or Brij-96 (v/v). Carbonic anhydrase (3.3 S), alkaline phosphatase (6.1 S), and β-galactosidase (16 S) were added to the extracts as sedimentation markers. A 0.2-ml cushion of 50% sucrose was layered at the bottom of the gradients. The gradients were centrifuged at 41,000 rpm for 24 h at 4 °C in a SW41 Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) and upward fractionated. Aliquots of each fraction were assayed for AChE and marker activities using a 96-well microtiter plate reader. To examine the role of invariant introns of theAche gene in pre-mRNA splice selection, we constructed from genomic DNA five mouse AChE expression plasmids containing the endogenous promoter (Fig. 1). The genomic DNA construct (gDNA), upon transfection into C2-C12 cells, should express a pattern of AChE mRNA species similar to the endogenous AChE transcripts. A second construct lacks both invariant introns II and III within the open reading frame of the Ache gene (Δi2–3,3–4), but contains the entire alternative splicing region 3′ of exon 4. The other three expression constructs contain the gDNA with one of the three 5′ introns in the gene deleted. As shown in Fig. 2 A, transient transfection of gDNA resulted in enhanced expression of exon 4 to 6 spliced mRNA (E4–6) as expected in myotubes. This indicates that the splicing machinery in the transfected cells has the capacity to process the additional AChE transcripts correctly. However, when the same plasmid DNA was transfected into human embryonic kidney cells, only small fraction of the AChE transcripts was spliced from exon 4 to 6, indicating that selective exon 4 to 6 splicing may be intrinsic to certain differentiated cells, such as C2-C12 muscle cells. When the transfected cells were maintained in an early stage of differentiation by returning to high serum conditions immediately after transfection, AChE mRNA transcribed from the transfected gDNA was only 37% (average of two independent transfections) of the level found in fully differentiated myotubes (Fig. 2 A). This suggests that, similar to the endogenous AChE mRNA (19Luo Z. Fuentes M.E. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27216-27223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Fuentes M.E. Taylor P. Neuron. 1993; 10: 679-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), mRNA from the transfected gene underwent stabilization during myogenesis. By contrast, transient transfection of Δi2–3,3–4 resulted in additional protected bands corresponding to the individual sizes of exon 4 (E4) and 6 (E6) in the probe. This severing of the exon 4 to 6 linkage indicates that, in addition to exon 4 to 6 splice, exon 4 with retained 3′ intron or/and exon 4 to 5 spliced species are expressed. These alternatively spliced species are confirmed by two probes shown in Fig. 2 (B and C). The full-length protected probes indicate the presence of mRNA with exon 4 either linked to its 3′ intron (E4-RI in Fig. 2 B) or spliced to exon 5 (E4–5 in Fig. 2 C), respectively. These alternatively spliced species were also confirmed by the protected exon 5 sequences (E5) in these probes reflecting exon 4 to 5 splice (Fig. 2 B) or exon 4 linked to its 3′ intron (Fig. 2 C). Protected exon 4 sequences (E4) in these probes appearing in the absence of protected E5 demonstrates the presence of only the exon 4 to 6 splice (Fig. 2, B and C). These data show that removal of introns II and III results in expression of alternatively spliced AChE mRNA species, which are normally not seen in myotubes. To examine the influence of individual intron II or III on pre-mRNA splicing, AChE expression constructs devoid of either intron II (Δi2–3) or III (Δi3–4) were transfected into differentiating C2-C12 cells. Total AChE mRNA levels accumulating in differentiated myotubes were lower than that in myotubes transfected with either gDNA or Δi2–3,3–4 (Table I). However, the majority of the transcripts were spliced between exon 4 and 6, as seen for the endogenous mRNA (Fig. 2, B and C, and Table I). Thus, the presence of either intron II or III is sufficient to direct exon 4 to 6 splicing during myogenesis and yield a pattern approaching that of endogenous pre-mRNA splicing. Cumulative data on the pattern of spliced AChE mRNA species in transfected C2-C12 myotubes are summarized in Table I.Table IEnhanced mRNA expression in C2-C12 myotubes after transfection of the respective plasmids into myoblastsPlasmid transfectedgDNAΔi2–3,3–4Δi2–3Δi3–4mRNA total expression10096 ± 950 ± 566 ± 11(% of transfected gDNA)Relative mRNA species(% total AChE mRNA) E4–687 ± 531 ± 782 ± 373 ± 11 E4-RI1-aRetained intron (intron IV).3.0 ± 0.742 ± 49 ± 116 ± 4 E4–51.3 ± 0.526 ± 19 ± 213 ± 3Genomic DNA encoding AChE and its respective deletion constructs are described in Fig. 1.

Values reported are the means ± S.E. averaged from four to six independent transfections. To examine the influence of the first intron in the Ache gene on its expression and splicing, differentiating C2-C12 cells were transiently transfected with an Ache expression construct devoid of this intron (Δi1–2). However, differentiated myotubes did not express the transfected plasmid at levels above the endogenous AChE mRNA (Fig. 2 A, representative data from three independent transfection experiments), indicating that the first intron residing 5′ of the ATG start site is necessary for Ache gene transcription or RNA stabilization. The following experiments were directed to resolving the sequence of splicing events occurring around the alternative splice region of AChE pre-mRNA. Helfman et al. (16Helfman D.M. Ricci W.M. Finn L.A. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1627-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) reported that downstream splicing in rat β-tropomyosin pre-mRNA is critical to upstream splice site selection. To examine the order of intron splicing around the alternative splice region and the influence of downstream intron on upstream splicing, we used the probe shown in Fig. 4 to detect unspliced and spliced transcripts, and the presence of splicing intermediates in cells transfected with gDNA or expression constructs in which the upstream invariant exons were spliced to either exon 5 (Δi4–5) or exon 6 (Δi4–6) (Fig. 3). Transfection of gDNA resulted in expression of a 540-bp species representing unspliced pre-mRNA, a 480-bp splice intermediate devoid of intron III, and a 171-bp species representing exon 4 to 6 splice (Fig. 4,A and B; note that retention of intron IV and exon 4 to 5 splicing should yield a protected exon 5 species). We did not see a protected species that would indicate production of splice intermediates with only intron III attached after gDNA transfection, suggesting that, at steady state, splicing of intron III precedes splicing of intron IV. However, transient transfection of Δi4–5 and Δi4–6 resulted in expression of a 231-bp species representing an unspliced transcript or an aberrant mRNA species spliced from a cryptic splice site 5′ of exon 4 (Fig. 4 B). These data indicate that intron IV is critical in controlling the efficiency of correct upstream splicing and further suggest that splicing of the invariant intron occurs prior to splicing of intron IV, the site of alternative splicing. The influence of upstream introns on downstream splice selection could result from a secondary structure in the pre-mRNA or be linked to upstream splicing events. To distinguish these possibilities, we deleted a large part of intron III from the construct Δi2–3, but kept the splicing machinery including the splice junctions and the branch point intact (P3–4Δi2–3 in Fig. 3). Expression of this deletion construct should result in more dramatic changes in pre-mRNA structure, but not upstream splicing, compared with the expression of Δi2–3. If the secondary structure of pre-mRNA plays a major role on downstream splicing selection, expression should result in a splicing pattern similar to that of Δi2–3,3–4. By contrast, if splicing events play a predominate role in downstream splice selection, expression should result in a splicing pattern similar to that of Δi2–3, which is close to the splice pattern of the genomic construct. As indicated in Fig. 4 A, transfection of P3–4Δi2–3 resulted in a 513-bp unspliced species, shorter than the 540-bp unspliced species seen in gDNA-transfected cells as expected from deletion of the intronic sequences. The absence of a protected exon 5 species in P3–4Δi2–3-transfected cells, similar to the gDNA, indicates that neither the intron IV retained species nor the exon 4 to 5 spliced mRNA is expressed. Therefore, in gDNA and P3–4Δi2–3-transfected cells, the 480- and 171-bp protected species represent a splicing intermediate devoid of intron III and exon 4 to 6 spliced mRNA, respectively. Accordingly, partial deletion of intron III in the Δi2–3 plasmid resulted in a splicing pattern similar to that of gDNA, rather than the splicing pattern seen for Δi2–3,3–4. To confirm the linkage of upstream splicing to downstream splice selection, the branch point adenosine in P3–4Δi2–3 was mutated to cytosine (single A → C mutation, SA/C). Since such a change in mammalian branch sites may activate abnormal branch formation through cryptic branch points (25Ruskin B. Greene J.M. Green M.R. Cell. 1985; 41: 833-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 26Rautmann G. Breathnach R. Nature. 1985; 315: 430-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Padgett R.A.

A. 1985; 82: 8349-8353Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), four adenosines proximal to the branch point in the intronic sequence were also mutated to cytosines (four adenosine mutations, QUA/C) (Fig. 3). If upstream splicing is linked to downstream splice selection, elimination of splicing in these constructs should render a splicing pattern similar to that of Δi2–3,3–4. As shown in Fig. 4, transfection of SA/C resulted in a splice pattern similar to that of the parental construct P3–4Δi2–3 with a slight reduction in the density of the 480-bp band and appearance of an aberrant mRNA species. The presence of the 480-bp species indicates that intron III can still be spliced out despite mutation of the branch point. The presence of unspliced 513-bp species and the absence of a 501-bp species expected from the single point mutation suggest that the hybridized probe RNA with the single point mismatch is not sensitive to RNase digestion. By contrast, transfection of QUA/C resulted in diminished upstream splicing as indicated by the disappearance of the 480-bp splice intermediate, and the appearance of the 499-bp unspliced species containing sequences of intron III downstream of the point mutations. This interruption of upstream splicing resulted in aberrant splicing at the alternative splice region, as indicated by the lack of protected exon 4 sequences over the endogenous level and the appearance of aberrant mRNAs. The similar densities of the 171- and 191-bp species (over the endogenous level) suggest a low level of exon 4 to 5 splicing, but we cannot rule out the possibility that the 191-bp species results from aberrant splicing. Using the exon 4 to 6 spliced probe shown in Fig. 2 A, we confirmed that normal exon 4 to 6 splicing is diminished in QUA/C-transfected cells (data not shown). The co-existence of the 513- and 499-bp species suggests that only partial digestion occurred in the region of single point mutations. Thus, the 499-bp species, based on the assumption that the probe was excised at the first mism"
https://openalex.org/W2316073008,"Exposure of mammalian cells to UV irradiation stimulates phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis and activates the transcription factor AP-1. Since phosphocholine (PCho), a phospholipid metabolite, is a potential regulator of mitogenesis and carcinogenesis, we examined the effect of UV exposure on the formation of PCho and the possible mediatory role of PCho in UVB-and UVC-induced activation of AP-1 in mouse JB6 epidermal cells. We found that both UVB and UVC irradiation resulted in increased PCho levels. Hemicholinium-3 (HC-3), an inhibitor of choline kinase, strongly inhibited UV-induced AP-1 activity. By contrast, relatively low levels of PCho (80 microM) or choline (20 microM) nearly doubled UV-induced AP-1 activity, while higher (2-20 mM) concentrations of PCho alone stimulated AP-1 activity 6-8-fold. Importantly, HC-3 inhibited only the stimulatory effect of choline, but not of PCho, on AP-1 activity. Of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases involved in the regulation of AP-1 activity, UVC stimulated the MAP kinase family ERK-1/ERK-2, JNK as well as p38 kinase activity. These UVC effects were all inhibited by HC-3. With UVB, by contrast, only the activation of ERK-1/ERK-2 was inhibited by HC-3. The data suggest that increased formation of PCho is required for UV-induced activation of AP-1 by an ERK-1/ERK-2-dependent mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2313780805,"The subcellular localization of many oncogenic proteins is thought to be important for their function. In the case of the middle T antigen of the DNA tumour virus, polyoma, localization to membranes in a specific manner is essential for its cellular transforming activity. To investigate factors that influence this localization, heterologous membrane targetting sequences were substituted for the middle T antigen transmembrane domain and the properties of the resulting proteins studied. Whereas C-terminal lipid modification derived from the H-ras CaaX box restored oncogenic activity to non-transforming truncated middle T antigen species, N-terminal myristylation from pp60c-src did not. Furthermore, a region, rich in basic amino acids and adjacent to the middle T transmembrane domain, was found to mediate association with detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton. Co-operation between the basic motif and neighbouring membrane binding domains resulted in specific localization of proteins to particular membrane sites, characterized by the association with subcellular structures, likely to be cytoskeletal in nature. These results demonstrate that the cellular localization of MT is regulated by at least two determinants, a transmembrane sequence which confers membrane binding and a basic motif which specifies a particular site within the membrane."
