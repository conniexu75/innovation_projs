https://openalex.org/W3139109607,"The human brain has undergone rapid expansion since humans diverged from other great apes, but the mechanism of this human-specific enlargement is still unknown. Here, we use cerebral organoids derived from human, gorilla, and chimpanzee cells to study developmental mechanisms driving evolutionary brain expansion. We find that neuroepithelial differentiation is a protracted process in apes, involving a previously unrecognized transition state characterized by a change in cell shape. Furthermore, we show that human organoids are larger due to a delay in this transition, associated with differences in interkinetic nuclear migration and cell cycle length. Comparative RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reveals differences in expression dynamics of cell morphogenesis factors, including ZEB2, a known epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulator. We show that ZEB2 promotes neuroepithelial transition, and its manipulation and downstream signaling leads to acquisition of nonhuman ape architecture in the human context and vice versa, establishing an important role for neuroepithelial cell shape in human brain expansion."
https://openalex.org/W3136171392,"Background Observational studies have consistently described poor clinical outcomes and increased ICU mortality in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who require mechanical ventilation (MV). Our study describes the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to ICU in the largest health care system in the state of Florida, United States. Methods Retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to ICU due to severe COVID-19 in AdventHealth health system in Orlando, Florida from March 11 th until May 18th, 2020. Patients were characterized based on demographics, baseline comorbidities, severity of illness, medical management including experimental therapies, laboratory markers and ventilator parameters. Major clinical outcomes analyzed at the end of the study period were: hospital and ICU length of stay, MV-related mortality and overall hospital mortality of ICU patients. Results Out of total of 1283 patients with COVID-19, 131 (10.2%) met criteria for ICU admission (median age: 61 years [interquartile range (IQR), 49.5–71.5]; 35.1% female). Common comorbidities were hypertension (84; 64.1%), and diabetes (54; 41.2%). Of the 131 ICU patients, 109 (83.2%) required MV and 9 (6.9%) received ECMO. Lower positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) were observed in survivors [9.2 (7.7–10.4)] vs non-survivors [10 (9.1–12.9] p = 0.004]. Compared to non-survivors, survivors had a longer MV length of stay (LOS) [14 (IQR 8–22) vs 8.5 (IQR 5–10.8) p&lt; 0.001], Hospital LOS [21 (IQR 13–31) vs 10 (7–1) p&lt; 0.001] and ICU LOS [14 (IQR 7–24) vs 9.5 (IQR 6–11), p &lt; 0.001]. The overall hospital mortality and MV-related mortality were 19.8% and 23.8% respectively. After exclusion of hospitalized patients, the hospital and MV-related mortality rates were 21.6% and 26.5% respectively. Conclusions Our study demonstrates an important improvement in mortality of patients with severe COVID-19 who required ICU admission and MV in comparison to previous observational reports and emphasizes the importance of standard of care measures in the management of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3136452579,"Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and greater knowledge of the metastatic microenvironment is necessary to effectively target this process. Microenvironmental changes occur at distant sites prior to clinically detectable metastatic disease; however, the key niche regulatory signals during metastatic progression remain poorly characterized. Here, we identify a core immune suppression gene signature in pre-metastatic niche formation that is expressed predominantly by myeloid cells. We target this immune suppression program by utilizing genetically engineered myeloid cells (GEMys) to deliver IL-12 to modulate the metastatic microenvironment. Our data demonstrate that IL12-GEMy treatment reverses immune suppression in the pre-metastatic niche by activating antigen presentation and T cell activation, resulting in reduced metastatic and primary tumor burden and improved survival of tumor-bearing mice. We demonstrate that IL12-GEMys can functionally modulate the core program of immune suppression in the pre-metastatic niche to successfully rebalance the dysregulated metastatic microenvironment in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3138595690,"Sarcomeres are force-generating and load-bearing devices of muscles. A precise molecular picture of how sarcomeres are built underpins understanding their role in health and disease. Here, we determine the molecular architecture of native vertebrate skeletal sarcomeres by electron cryo-tomography. Our reconstruction reveals molecular details of the three-dimensional organization and interaction of actin and myosin in the A-band, I-band, and Z-disc and demonstrates that α-actinin cross-links antiparallel actin filaments by forming doublets with 6-nm spacing. Structures of myosin, tropomyosin, and actin at ~10 Å further reveal two conformations of the ""double-head"" myosin, where the flexible orientation of the lever arm and light chains enable myosin not only to interact with the same actin filament, but also to split between two actin filaments. Our results provide unexpected insights into the fundamental organization of vertebrate skeletal muscle and serve as a strong foundation for future investigations of muscle diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3138699713,"<h2>Summary</h2> Cutaneous mast cells mediate numerous skin inflammatory processes and have anatomical and functional associations with sensory afferent neurons. We reveal that epidermal nerve endings from a subset of sensory nonpeptidergic neurons expressing MrgprD are reduced by the absence of Langerhans cells. Loss of epidermal innervation or ablation of MrgprD-expressing neurons increased expression of a mast cell gene module, including the activating receptor, <i>Mrgprb2</i>, resulting in increased mast cell degranulation and cutaneous inflammation in multiple disease models. Agonism of MrgprD-expressing neurons reduced expression of module genes and suppressed mast cell responses. MrgprD-expressing neurons released glutamate which was increased by MrgprD agonism. Inhibiting glutamate release or glutamate receptor binding yielded hyperresponsive mast cells with a genomic state similar to that in mice lacking MrgprD-expressing neurons. These data demonstrate that MrgprD-expressing neurons suppress mast cell hyperresponsiveness and skin inflammation via glutamate release, thereby revealing an unexpected neuroimmune mechanism maintaining cutaneous immune homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3139151390,"The flexibility allowed by the mobilization of technology disintegrated the traditional work-life boundary for most professionals. Whether working from home is the key or impediment to academics' efficiency and work-life balance became a daunting question for both scientists and their employers. The recent pandemic brought into focus the merits and challenges of working from home on a level of personal experience. Using a convenient sampling, we surveyed 704 academics while working from home and found that the pandemic lockdown decreased the work efficiency for almost half of the researchers but around a quarter of them were more efficient during this time compared to the time before. Based on the gathered personal experience, 70% of the researchers think that in the future they would be similarly or more efficient than before if they could spend more of their work-time at home. They indicated that in the office they are better at sharing thoughts with colleagues, keeping in touch with their team, and collecting data, whereas at home they are better at working on their manuscript, reading the literature, and analyzing their data. Taking well-being also into account, 66% of them would find it ideal to work more from home in the future than they did before the lockdown. These results draw attention to how working from home is becoming a major element of researchers' life and that we have to learn more about its influencer factors and coping tactics in order to optimize its arrangements."
https://openalex.org/W3137896786,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that was first reported at the end of 2019 has impacted almost every aspect of life as we know it. This paper focuses on the incidence of the disease in Italy and Spain—two of the first and most affected European countries. Using two simple mathematical epidemiological models—the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model and the log-linear regression model, we model the daily and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the two countries during the early stage of the outbreak, and compute estimates for basic measures of the infectiousness of the disease including the basic reproduction number, growth rate, and doubling time. Estimates of the basic reproduction number were found to be larger than 1 in both countries, with values being between 2 and 3 for Italy, and 2.5 and 4 for Spain. Estimates were also computed for the more dynamic effective reproduction number, which showed that since the first cases were confirmed in the respective countries the severity has generally been decreasing. The predictive ability of the log-linear regression model was found to give a better fit and simple estimates of the daily incidence for both countries were computed."
https://openalex.org/W3136460397,"Background There are concerns that both the experience of adversities during the COVID-19 pandemic and worries about experiencing adversities will have substantial and lasting effects on mental health. One pathway through which both experience of and worries about adversity may impact health is through effects on sleep. Methods We used data from 46,284 UK adults in the COVID-19 Social Study assessed weekly from 01/04/2020-12/05/2020 to study the association between adversities and sleep quality. We studied six categories of adversity including both worries and experiences of: illness with COVID-19, financial difficulty, loss of paid work, difficulties acquiring medication, difficulties accessing food, and threats to personal safety. We used random-effect within-between models to account for all time-invariant confounders. Results Both the total number of adversity experiences and total number of adversity worries were associated with lower quality sleep. Each additional experience was associated with a 1.16 (95% CI = 1.10, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep while each additional worry was associated with a 1.20 (95% CI = 1.17, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep. When considering specific experiences and worries, all worries and experiences were significantly related to poorer quality sleep except experiences relating to employment and finances. Having a larger social network offered some buffering effects on associations but there was limited further evidence of moderation by other social or psychiatric factors. Conclusion Poor sleep may be a mechanism by which COVID-19 adversities are affecting mental health. This highlights the importance of interventions that support adaptive coping strategies during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3137057747,"Inundated wetlands can potentially sequester substantial amounts of soil carbon (C) over the long-term because of slow decomposition and high primary productivity, particularly in climates with long growing seasons. Restoring such wetlands may provide one of several effective negative emission technologies to remove atmospheric CO 2 and mitigate climate change. However, there remains considerable uncertainty whether these heterogeneous ecotones are consistent net C sinks and to what degree restoration and management methods affect C sequestration. Since wetland C dynamics are largely driven by climate, it is difficult to draw comparisons across regions. With many restored wetlands having different functional outcomes, we need to better understand the importance of site-specific conditions and how they change over time. We report on 21 site-years of C fluxes using eddy covariance measurements from five restored fresh to brackish wetlands in a Mediterranean climate. The wetlands ranged from 3 to 23 years after restoration and showed that several factors related to restoration methods and site conditions altered the magnitude of C sequestration by affecting vegetation cover and structure. Vegetation established within two years of re-flooding but followed different trajectories depending on design aspects, such as bathymetry-determined water levels, planting methods, and soil nutrients. A minimum of 55% vegetation cover was needed to become a net C sink, which most wetlands achieved once vegetation was established. Established wetlands had a high C sequestration efficiency (i.e. the ratio of net to gross ecosystem productivity) comparable to upland ecosystems but varied between years undergoing boom-bust growth cycles and C uptake strength was susceptible to disturbance events. We highlight the large C sequestration potential of productive inundated marshes, aided by restoration design and management targeted to maximise vegetation extent and minimise disturbance. These findings have important implications for wetland restoration, policy, and management practitioners."
https://openalex.org/W3138818551,"Odorant metabolizing enzymes (OMEs) are expressed in the olfactory epithelium (OE) where they play a significant role in the peripheral olfactory process by catalyzing the fast biotransformation of odorants leading either to their elimination or to the synthesis of new odorant stimuli. The large family of OMEs gathers different classes which interact with a myriad of odorants alike and complementary to olfactory receptors. Thus, it is necessary to increase our knowledge on OMEs to better understand their function in the physiological process of olfaction. This study focused on a major olfactory UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT): UGT2A1. Immunohistochemistry and immunogold electronic microscopy allowed to localize its expression in the apical part of the sustentacular cells and originally at the plasma membrane of the olfactory cilia of the olfactory sensory neurons, both locations in close vicinity with olfactory receptors. Moreover, using electroolfactogram, we showed that a treatment of the OE with beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme which counterbalance the UGTs activity, increased the response to eugenol which is a strong odorant UGT substrate. Altogether, the results supported the function of the olfactory UGTs in the vertebrate olfactory perireceptor process."
https://openalex.org/W3137974648,"The COVID-19 pandemic has increasingly disrupted the global delivery of preventive health care services, as a large number of governments have issued state of emergency orders halting service delivery. However, there is limited evidence on the realized effects of the pandemic and associated emergency orders on access to services in low-income country contexts to date. To address this gap, this paper analyzes administrative data on utilization of contraceptive health services by women referred via community health promoters in two large urban and peri-urban areas of Mozambique. We focus on the period immediately surrounding the national state of emergency declaration linked to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 31, 2020. Data reported for 109,129 women served by 132 unique promoters and 192 unique public health facilities is analyzed using logistic regression, interrupted time series analysis and hazard analysis. The results demonstrate that the imposition of the state of emergency is associated with a modest short-term drop in both service provision and utilization, followed by a relatively rapid rebound. We conclude that in this context, the accessibility of reproductive health services was not dramatically reduced during the first phase of the pandemic-related emergency."
https://openalex.org/W3136028654,"Background Childhood undernutrition is the leading cause of under-five mortality and morbidity in the world particularly in East African countries. Although there are studies on child undernutrition in different East African countries, our search of the literature revealed that there is limited evidence of a pooled analysis of these studies. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the pooled prevalence and associated factors of chronic undernutrition (i.e. stunting) among under-five children in East Africa. Methods A pooled analysis of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs) in 12 East African countries was conducted. A total weighted sample of 79744 under-five children was included in the study. Mixed-effect logistic regression analysis was used to identify significant factors associated with chronic undernutrition since the DHS data has a hierarchical structure. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), Median Odds Ratio (MOR), Likelihood Ratio (LR)-test, and deviance was used for model comparison. Variables with p-value &lt;0.2 in the bivariable mixed-effect logistic regression analysis were considered for the multivariable analysis. In the multivariable multilevel analysis model, the Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were reported for significant factors. Results The pooled prevalence of chronic undernutrition among underfive children in East Africa was 33.3% (95% CI: 32.9%, 35.6%) ranging from 21.9% in Kenya to 53% in Burundi. Children whose mothers lived in rural area (AOR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.16), born to mother who had no formal education (AOR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.34, 1.50) and primary education (AOR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.31, 1.44), being in poor household (AOR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.58, 1.74), and middle household (AOR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.35, 1.49), child aged 36–48 months (AOR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.14), being male (AOR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.15, 1.23), 2 nd - 4 th birth order (AOR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.13), and above 4 th 1.27 (AOR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.35), home delivery 1.09 (AOR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.13), small size at birth (AOR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.29, 1.40) and being multiple births (AOR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.81, 2.17) were associated with increased odds of stunting. While, antenatal care visit (AOR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.93), mothers aged 25–34 (AOR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.79, 0.86) and ≥ 35 years (AOR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.72, 0.81), large size at birth (AOR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.81, 0.88), and family size &gt;8 (AOR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87, 0.98) were associated with decreased odds of stunting. Conclusion The study revealed that stunting among under-five children remains a major public health problem in East Africa. Therefore, to improve child nutrition status the governmental and non-governmental organizations should design public health interventions targeting rural residents, and the poorest households. Furthermore, enhancing health facility delivery, ANC visit, and maternal health education is vital for reducing child chronic undernutrition."
https://openalex.org/W3139538251,"Background During the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, reductions of hospital admissions with a focus on emergencies have been observed for several medical and surgical conditions, while trend data during later stages of the pandemic are scarce. Consequently, this study aims to provide up-to-date hospitalization trends for several conditions including cardiovascular, psychiatry, oncology and surgery cases in both the in- and outpatient setting. Methods and findings Using claims data of 86 Helios hospitals in Germany, consecutive cases with an in- or outpatient hospital admission between March 13, 2020 (the begin of the “protection” stage of the German pandemic plan) and December 10, 2020 (end of study period) were analyzed and compared to a corresponding period covering the same weeks in 2019. Cause-specific hospitalizations were defined based on the primary discharge diagnosis according to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) or German procedure classification codes for cardiovascular, oncology, psychiatry and surgery cases. Cumulative hospitalization deficit was computed as the difference between the expected and observed cumulative admission number for every week in the study period, expressed as a percentage of the cumulative expected number. The expected admission number was defined as the weekly average during the control period. A total of 1,493,915 hospital admissions (723,364 during the study and 770,551 during the control period) were included. At the end of the study period, total cumulative hospitalization deficit was -10% [95% confidence interval -10; -10] for cardiovascular and -9% [-10; -9] for surgical cases, higher than -4% [-4; -3] in psychiatry and 4% [4; 4] in oncology cases. The utilization of inpatient care and subsequent hospitalization deficit was similar in trend with some variation in magnitude between cardiovascular (-12% [-13; -12]), psychiatry (-18% [-19; -17]), oncology (-7% [-8; -7]) and surgery cases (-11% [-11; -11]). Similarly, cardiovascular and surgical outpatient cases had a deficit of -5% [-6; -5] and -3% [-4; -3], respectively. This was in contrast to psychiatry (2% [1; 2]) and oncology cases (21% [20; 21]) that had a surplus in the outpatient sector. While in-hospital mortality, was higher during the Covid-19 pandemic in cardiovascular (3.9 vs. 3.5%, OR 1.10 [95% CI 1.06–1.15], P &lt;0.01) and in oncology cases (4.5 vs. 4.3%, OR 1.06 [95% CI 1.01–1.11], P &lt;0.01), it was similar in surgical (0.9 vs. 0.8%, OR 1.06 [95% CI 1.00–1.13], P = 0.07) and in psychiatry cases (0.4 vs. 0.5%, OR 1.01 [95% CI 0.78–1.31], P &lt;0.95). Conclusions There have been varying changes in care pathways and in-hospital mortality in different disciplines during the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany. Despite all the inherent and well-known limitations of claims data use, this data may be used for health care surveillance as the pandemic continues worldwide. While this study provides an up-to-date analysis of utilization of hospital care in the largest German hospital network, short- and long-term consequences are unknown and deserve further studies."
https://openalex.org/W3137914836,"Advances in digital health have enabled clinicians to move away from a reliance on face to face consultation methods towards making use of modern video and web-based conferencing technology. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote telecommunication methods have become much more common place in mental health settings. The current study sought to investigate whether remote telecommunication methods are preferable to face to face consultations for adults referred to an Autism and ADHD Service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, whether there are any differences in preferred consultation methods between adults who were referred for an assessment of Autism as opposed to ADHD. 117 service users who undertook assessment by the ADHD and Autism Service at South West Yorkshire NHS Partnership Foundation Trust from April to September 2020 completed an adapted version of the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ). Results demonstrated that service users found remote telecommunication to be useful, effective, reliable and satisfactory. Despite this, almost half of service users stated a general preference for face to face consultations. There was no difference in the choice of methods of contact between Autism and ADHD pathways. Remote telecommunication methods were found to be an acceptable medium of contact for adults who undertook an assessment of Autism and ADHD at an NHS Service during the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3138475027,"This study aimed to investigate the characteristics related to SARS-CoV-2 in Luanda, Angola. A total of 622 individuals were screened for SARS-CoV-2 from January to September 2020. Chi-square and logistic regression were used to identify the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and SARS-CoV-2. Of the 622 tested, 14.3% tested positive. The infection rate was the same for both genders (14.3%). Individuals ≥40 years old, from non-urbanized areas, and healthcare professionals had a higher frequency of infection. The risk of infection was very high in individuals ≥60 years old (AOR: 23.3, 95% CI: 4.83–112), in women (AOR: 1.24, 95% CI: 0.76–2.04), in Luanda (AOR: 7.40, 95% CI: 1.64–33.4), and healthcare professionals (AOR: 1.27, 95% CI: 0.60–2.71), whereas a low risk was observed in individuals from urbanized areas (AOR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.26–0.75). Our results suggest that Angolan authorities should implement a greater effort in non-urbanized areas and among healthcare professionals since when these individuals presented any indication for a COVID-19 test, such as fever/cough/myalgia, they were more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than having some other cause for symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3138680364,"Background Tests are scarce resources, especially in low and middle-income countries, and the optimization of testing programs during a pandemic is critical for the effectiveness of the disease control. Hence, we aim to use the combination of symptoms to build a predictive model as a screening tool to identify people and areas with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to be prioritized for testing. Materials and methods We performed a retrospective analysis of individuals registered in "" Dados do Bem ,"" a Brazilian app-based symptom tracker. We applied machine learning techniques and provided a SARS-CoV-2 infection risk map of Rio de Janeiro city. Results From April 28 to July 16, 2020, 337,435 individuals registered their symptoms through the app. Of these, 49,721 participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, being 5,888 (11.8%) positive. Among self-reported symptoms, loss of smell (OR[95%CI]: 4.6 [4.4–4.9]), fever (2.6 [2.5–2.8]), and shortness of breath (2.1 [1.6–2.7]) were independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our final model obtained a competitive performance, with only 7% of false-negative users predicted as negatives (NPV = 0.93). The model was incorporated by the "" Dados do Bem "" app aiming to prioritize users for testing. We developed an external validation in the city of Rio de Janeiro. We found that the proportion of positive results increased significantly from 14.9% (before using our model) to 18.1% (after the model). Conclusions Our results showed that the combination of symptoms might predict SARS-Cov-2 infection and, therefore, can be used as a tool by decision-makers to refine testing and disease control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3137522600,"This article analyses public debate on Twitter via network representations of retweets and replies. We argue that tweets observable on Twitter have both a direct and mediated effect on the perception of public opinion. Through the interplay of the two networks, it is possible to identify potentially misleading representations of public opinion on the platform. The method is employed to observe public debate about two events: The Saxon state elections and violent riots in the city of Leipzig in 2019. We show that in both cases, (i) different opinion groups exhibit different propensities to get involved in debate, and therefore have unequal impact on public opinion. Users retweeting far-right parties and politicians are significantly more active, hence their positions are disproportionately visible. (ii) Said users act significantly more confrontational in the sense that they reply mostly to users from different groups, while the contrary is not the case."
https://openalex.org/W3136318207,"Osteogenic endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to impaired endothelial repair and promote coronary artery disease (CAD) and vascular calcification. Immature EPCs expressing osteocalcin (OCN) has been linked to unstable CAD; however, phenotypic regulation of OCN-expressing EPCs is not understood. We hypothesized that gut-microbiome derived pro-inflammatory substance, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) might be associated with mobilization of OCN-expressing EPCs. This study aimed to investigate the association between dysbiosis, TMAO, and circulating mature and immature OCN-expressing EPCs levels in patients with and without CAD. We included 202 patients (CAD N = 88; no CAD N = 114) who underwent assessment of EPCs using flow cytometry and gut microbiome composition. Mature and immature EPCs co-staining for OCN were identified using cell surface markers as CD34+/CD133-/kinase insert domain receptor (KDR)+ and CD34-/CD133+/KDR+ cells, respectively. The number of observed operational taxonomy units (OTU), index of microbial richness, was used to identify patients with dysbiosis. The number of immature OCN-expressing EPCs were higher in patients with CAD or dysbiosis than patients without. TMAO levels were not associated with circulating levels of OCN-expressing EPCs. The relative abundance of Ruminococcus gnavus was moderately correlated with circulating levels of immature OCN-expressing EPCs, especially in diabetic patients. Gut dysbiosis was associated with increased levels of TMAO, immature OCN-expressing EPCs, and CAD. The relative abundance of Ruminococcus gnavus was correlated with immature OCN-expressing EPCs, suggesting that the harmful effects of immature OCN-expressing EPCs on CAD and potentially vascular calcification might be mediated by gut microbiome-derived systemic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3138649896,"Background Up till today, studies carried in Lebanon have focused more on the prevalence of HIV and behaviors and quality of life of infected individuals, however, none of these studies discussed the degree of stigma towards these populations. Therefore, the aim of this study is to measure the rate of stigma in terms of knowledge, attitude and practice towards patients living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) (PLWHA) and examine the factors associated with this stigma. Methods A cross-sectional survey, enrolling 862 participants, was carried across the five governorates in Lebanon: Beirut, Mount Lebanon, North, South and Bekaa. The survey was a self-administered questionnaire which covered information about participants’ general demographics, their knowledge, attitudes, practices and awareness towards HIV/AIDS in Lebanon., attitudes towards PLWHA, practices related to HIV/AIDS and awareness regarding HIV/AIDS situation in Lebanon. Results The response rate to the survey was 78.36% (862 participants). Being Muslim (Beta = -2.56) or Druze (Beta = -2.64) compared to Christians were significantly associated with lower knowledge towards HIV/AIDS, whereas having a secondary (Beta = 2.71) and a university (Beta = 3.04) levels of education compared to illiteracy and higher age (Beta = 0.05) were significantly associated with higher knowledge. Higher knowledge (Beta = 0.66) was significantly associated with better attitude, whereas higher age (Beta = -0.14) and being Muslim compared to Christian (Beta = -3.44) were significantly associated with worse attitude. Better attitude (Beta = 0.02) was significantly associated with better practice, whereas females compared to males (Beta = -0.39), having a secondary level of education compared to illiteracy (Beta = -0.88) and being Muslim compared to Christian (Beta = -0.32) were significantly associated with worse practice. Conclusion Our results stress the need for educational programs, advocacy campaigns and policies to help reduce HIV stigma. This will then help start developing interventions and strategies for a possible reduction in the stigmatization level."
https://openalex.org/W3138702084,"Introduction While trigger warnings have garnered significant debate, few studies have investigated how students typically respond to potentially triggering material. Method In this study, three hundred and fifty-five undergraduate students from four universities read a passage describing incidences of both physical and sexual assault. Longitudinal measures of subjective distress, PTSD symptoms, and emotional reactivity were taken. Results Greater than 96% of participants read the triggering passage even when given a non-triggering alternative to read. Of those who read the triggering passage, those with triggering traumas did not report more distress although those with higher PTSD scores did. Two weeks later, those with trigger traumas and/or PTSD did not report an increase in trauma symptoms as a result of reading the triggering passage. Conclusions Students with relevant traumas do not avoid triggering material and the effects appear to be brief. Students with PTSD do not report an exacerbation of symptoms two weeks later as a function of reading the passage."
https://openalex.org/W3136026849,"The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system is the most widely applied staging system for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is recommended for treatment allocation and prognostic prediction. The BCLC guidelines were modified in 2018 to indicate that Child-Pugh A without any ascites is essential for all stages except stage D. This study sought to provide a description of patients with HCC treated at a high-volume liver surgery center in Taiwan where referral is not needed and all treatment modalities are available and reimbursed by the National Health Insurance program. As such, certain variables that could modulate treatment decisions in clinical practice, including financial constraints, the availability of treatment procedures, and the expertise of the hospital, could be excluded. The study further sought to evaluate the adherence to the modified BCLC guidelines.This was a retrospective study with prospectively collected data. 1801 consecutive patients with de novo HCC were enrolled through our institution from 2011-2017.There were 302 patients with stage 0, 783 with stage A, 242 with stage B, 358 with stage C, and 116 with stage D HCC. Treatment adhering to the modified BCLC guidelines recommendations was provided to 259 (85.8%) stage 0 patients, 606 (77.4%) stage A patients, 120 (49.6%) stage B patients, 93 (26.0%) stage C patients, and 83 (71.6%) stage D patients.We reported treatment adhering to the modified BCLC guidelines at a high-volume liver surgery center in Taiwan. We found that non-adherence to the modified BCLC staging system was common in treating stage B and C patients."

Thus far, no study has determined the factors associated with anemia among children aged &lt;5 years in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic using a nationwide representative sample. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anemia and its associated factors with multilevel variations among children aged 6–59 months. This quantitative, cross-sectional study used a nationally representative sample from the Lao Social Indicator Survey II, 2017. Children aged 6–59 months tested for anemia were included in this study through multistage sampling approaches. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin level of &lt;11.0 g/dL. Multilevel binary logistic regression analyses were used to determine the adjusted effect of the factors associated with anemia. Among the 5,087 children included, the overall prevalence of anemia was 43.0%. Three factors were associated with higher odds of developing anemia—male sex (adjusted odds ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.34), underweight (adjusted odds ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–1.55), and residence in central provinces (adjusted odds ratio, 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.30–1.95) and southern provinces (adjusted odds ratio, 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.81). However, the other three factors—age, educational level of the household head, and Hmong-Mien ethnicity—were inversely associated with anemia. To resolve the problem regarding the severity of the anemia among children aged &lt;5 years in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. Our findings highlight the need for designing an effective approach to address each factor associated with childhood anemia. Interventions should focus on the prevention of childhood anemia, which is considered a major priority of public health intervention in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic."

A child may experience more than one episode of SAM depending on the improvement of the underlying factors. However, there is no study that determined the frequency of relapse of SAM cases after discharge in Ethiopia.To identify the frequency of relapse and associated factors among children discharged after undergoing treatment for SAM in Hadiya Zone, South, Ethiopia.An institution based retrospective cohort study was done among children admitted to health posts for treatment of SAM from 2014/2015-2019/2020 under-five children's after discharge in health post for severe acute malnutrition in the last five years in Hadiya zone, SNNPR, Ethiopia. Both first admission data and relapse data were abstracted from the records of the SAM children from Aguste 1-30 /2020 Using a data collection format. Data were coded and edited manually, then doubly entered into Epi-Data statistical software version 3.1 and then exported to SPSS for windows version 26. After checking all the assumptions finally Negative binomial regression for poison has been used. All tests were two sided and P values <0.05 were used to declare statistical significance.In the last five year there were the proportion of relapsed cases were 9.6%, 95% CI: (7.7%, 11.7%) On multivariable negative binomial regression model, after adjusting for background variables relapse of severe acute undernutrition was significantly associated with having edema during admission with (IRR = 2.21, 95% CI:1.303-3.732), being in the age group of 6-11 months (IRR = 4.74,95% CI:1.79-12.53), discharge MUAC for the first admission (P = 0.001, IRR = 0.37, 95% CI:0.270-0.50) increase the risk of incidence rate ratio(IRR) relapse case of severe acute under nutrition.Frequency of SAM relapse was positively associated with age, having edema during admission, while it was negatively associated with discharge MUAC. The results imply the need for reviewing the discharge criteria taking into account the recovery of MUAC as a marker for lean tissue accretion, especially in edematous children and those in the younger age."
https://openalex.org/W3136992867,"The effect of two microbial phytases at two dose-levels on performance and apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of nutrients in broilers fed European-type diets was studied. A total of 1,200 d-old Ross 308 male broilers were randomly assigned to 5 treatments with 30 birds/pen and 8 pens/treatment. A nutritionally adequate positive control (PC) diet was tested against 4 experimental diets containing reduced total P, retainable P, Ca and Na as per the recommended nutritional contribution for Buttiauxella phytase (Phy B) at 1,000 FTU/kg (-1.87 g/kg, -1.59 g/kg, -1.99 g/kg and -0.4 g/kg vs . PC, respectively). Experimental diets were supplemented with Phy B at 500 FTU/kg or 1,000 FTU/kg, or Citrobacter phytase (Phy C) at 1,000 FTU/kg or 2,000 FTU/kg. Diets were based on corn, soybean meal, rapeseed meal and sunflower meal and formulated by phase (starter 1–10 d, grower 11–21 d) in crumbled or pelleted form. Overall (d 1–21), at 1,000 FTU/kg, birds fed Phy C exhibited lower BWG (-2.7%), FI (-3.4%) and tibia ash (-2.2%) vs. PC ( P &lt; 0.05), and reduced BWG (-3.6%), FI (-3.9%) and tibia ash (-1.8%) vs. Phy B ( P &lt; 0.05). Phy B at 1,000 FTU/kg and Phy C at 2,000 FTU/kg maintained performance equivalent to the PC. Digestibility of Ca did not differ among phytase treatments but at 1,000 FTU/kg AID P was greater with Phy B than Phy C (72.3% vs. 62.7%, P &lt; 0.05). Ileal phytate (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate, IP6) digestibility was greatest with Phy B at 1,000 FTU/kg which was higher than Phy C at 1,000 FTU/kg (87.6 vs. 60.6%, P &lt; 0.05). The findings indicate a higher phytate degradation rate of Phy B than Phy C at equivalent dose-level and this is correlated to the performance of the broilers."
https://openalex.org/W3137481077,"Adaptive oscillators (AOs) are nonlinear oscillators with plastic states that encode information. Here, an analog implementation of a four-state adaptive oscillator, including design, fabrication, and verification through hardware measurement, is presented. The result is an oscillator that can learn the frequency and amplitude of an external stimulus over a large range. Notably, the adaptive oscillator learns parameters of external stimuli through its ability to completely synchronize without using any pre- or post-processing methods. Previously, Hopf oscillators have been built as two-state (a regular Hopf oscillator) and three-state (a Hopf oscillator with adaptive frequency) systems via VLSI and FPGA designs. Building on these important implementations, a continuous-time, analog circuit implementation of a Hopf oscillator with adaptive frequency and amplitude is achieved. The hardware measurements and SPICE simulation show good agreement. To demonstrate some of its functionality, the circuit's response to several complex waveforms, including the response of a square wave, a sawtooth wave, strain gauge data of an impact of a nonlinear beam, and audio data of a noisy microphone recording, are reported. By learning both the frequency and amplitude, this circuit could be used to enhance applications of AOs for robotic gait, clock oscillators, analog frequency analyzers, and energy harvesting."

However, times of crisis show us how much more we can accomplish when we work together. Here, we describe our approach to breaking down silos and fostering global collaborations and share the lessons we have learned, especially pertaining to research on SARS-CoV-2. The scientific world rewards the individual while often discouraging collaboration. However, times of crisis show us how much more we can accomplish when we work together. Here, we describe our approach to breaking down silos and fostering global collaborations and share the lessons we have learned, especially pertaining to research on SARS-CoV-2. Academic science is highly siloed. Scientists often do not communicate efficiently due in large part to the reward system that exists in the scientific world, where individuals, rather than groups of scientists working together, usually receive the awards, tenure, and grants. This helps to create an environment where sharing and collaboration is often discouraged, which is particularly problematic for young scientists who have new and fresh ideas but become guarded because of flaws on the system. Here, we briefly describe the success of our collaborative group, the QBI Coronavirus Research Group (QCRG) (http://qbi.ucsf.edu/QCRG/overview); outline the key ingredients to successful collaborations; and call on funders to recognize the value of collaborative, international research. The QCRG was immediately successful and has been recognized worldwide. The question is, why? A number of factors contributed to the success; the formula was the same one we have used when building our other collaborations. Like-minded people, who were excellent scientists with whom we already had relationships were part of the initial team and strong vocal supporters of the effort. Our well-established international network was ready to be tapped into with a phone call. Everyone was wary of this unknown virus at the beginning, and fear can often be a propellor to progress. It became apparent that no one place was self-sufficient regardless of its caliber; this in turn made all of us value each other’s work and discoveries even more.

Empowering the trainees to take on leadership roles was key to the success and helped them develop as independent scientists. A particular liaison with the French Consulate of San Francisco played a crucial role in the developments of the QCRG, as they aided with the shipment of drugs and compounds to our collaborators in France at the height of the pandemic. At the onset of the SARS-CoV-2, UCSF did not have a BSL3 laboratory, where the virus could be propagated, whereas both the Institut Pasteur and Mount Sinai in New York did. Both partners, along with more recently University College London, played a key role in these studies and ultimately in the identification of therapeutics. Having diversity in the group is extremely important; different voices, different perspectives and approaches to the same problem mean that we will get to an answer much faster. However, a large group brings its challenges. Currently the QCRG at UCSF, hundreds of scientists, has been broken down into 12 manageable subgroups with leaders, and a project manager has been hired. We should ask ourselves why it had to take such a gigantic human tragedy for us to work together. While most will agree that working together and sharing is important in science, how many would feel this is the most important facet for success? Our initial motivation behind the formation of Quantitative Biosciences Institute (QBI) (http://qbi.ucsf.edu) at UCSF in 2016 was simple: collaboration. Were there scientists out there who could also imagine that bringing people with different disciplines, expertise, and points of view together would enable all sides to grow and see problems and scientific questions from a different perspective, which would induce creativity and ultimately help progress science? The groundwork of building significant relationships with scientists and institutes both domestically and internationally would prove to be a indispensable element in our rapid COVID research output in the form of the QCRG in 2020. A concrete vision came together to actively implement this team science concept through network mapping of the cell. Since much work has been done on identifying sets of genes linked to a variety of diseases, one obvious next step was to study how the corresponding proteins were physically and functionally interacting with each other in healthy and diseased states. These maps would help inform more mechanistic and structural studies and links to patient cohorts, so they could ultimately connect scientists across a wide array of disciplines. This vision is disease agnostic and is being applied to many different disease areas in the form of three QBI-initiated cell mapping initiatives: Cancer Cell Map Initiative (CCMI) (http://ccmi.org); Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI) (http://pcmi.ucsf.edu); and the Host Pathogen Map Initiative (HPMI) (http://hpmi.ucsf.edu), which includes the NIH-funded HARC (HIV Accessory and Regulartory Complexes) center (https://harc.ucsf.edu/) focused on studying HIV-host interactions. A similar vision could be applied to different disciplines as long as a unifying concept connects people to one another. These projects, each initially composed of 10–15 PIs with diverse and complementary expertise, have allowed for the acquisition of large collaborative center grants from national funding agencies, such as NIH and DARPA. As a public institution mostly funded by NIH, we feel it is important to both inform and involve the agency in our ongoing plans. From 2017 to the end of 2019, we visited NIH and DARPA program officers over 20 times to update them and forge new alliances by introducing our concepts. This effort ultimately led to the acquisition of five collaborative grants around the different cell mapping initiatives. Initiating NIH visits is key to obtaining support for your vision and concepts. The visits are likewise a great opportunity for feedback and fine-tuning from NIH experts who share their own visions with you. It was natural to think about a similar approach internationally. To make international relationships work, it was imperative to start with initial interactions and meetings between, and among, scientists and then approach leadership to request funding and support to foster the identified collaborations. Often, grand ideas that start at the top do not get much traction if the scientists doing the work are not interested. It was important to find complementary colleagues across the world—those who did similar science but either from a different angle or using different tools. Identifying the various capabilities of each place also proved to be pivotal during the pandemic, including collaborating with those who were capable of growing the virus in a laboratory setting. Meeting someone specific at any institution in the world is easy through the commonplace but extensive network of scientific connections. When we did not know people directly, we asked for an introduction. If we had participated in a symposium together, a simple email suggested a visit and seminar to introduce the science and explore potential synergy. Our first learned lesson is that we had to put ourselves out there even when we were unsure. Virtually all of these efforts have been fruitful. The formula is straightforward: give a seminar and meet multiple people to assess the potential for synergy. Almost 100% of the scientists were excited at the prospect of working together. We seldom left a new place without already having some small projects and exchanges identified. Lesson learned: create the opportunities for one-on-one meetings, build and develop relationships, find synergies, and follow up! Once the desire to work together has been established, it is crucial to wrap up the visit with leadership who has influence at the institute. A next step is to suggest an annual symposium that brings together an equal number of people from both institutions to exchange their research ideas. This incentive is welcomed because (1) scientists love get-togethers and (2) being hosted in a great location is never a bad idea. If finances are an issue, what we have learned from the current pandemic is that it is possible to do everything online. While scientists communicated, we also met with development teams and administrators that could formalize relationships between institutions. These meetings consolidated the agreements we would eventually put together between institutions and fostered the first discussions about possible funds for collaborative research that would emerge following a symposium. We found it useful to travel with both a scientist and a representative administrator. In this way, the scientists focus on the research, and the administrator focuses on different aspects of relationship building. Again, if a budget is not available for travel, communication can occur through video conferencing. The creation of a memorandum of understanding (MOU), which is a formal agreement between two institutions, is often required for scientific engagement. Keep the initial MOU very broad to allow for flexibility, but it is important to have some base objectives that allow for an immediate start of activities. These could include student and postdoc exchanges, joint calls for proposals, and collaborative fundraising efforts. Having the signing of the MOU take place at an inaugural symposium can create excitement among the participants. If the institutions do not have discretionary funds available to seed projects, one can take advantage of research funding announcements (RFAs) or international opportunities through NSF, NIH, and others. These are easily found on the web or by asking program officers for advice. In developing nations, where the funds might not exist, the relationship is developed differently. Activities in this context may include cultural exchanges, capacity building, workshops, and joint grant applications. Both sides bring something very relevant to an increasingly global approach in science, and these particular relationships can offer a great chance to focus on both youth and the advancement of women—criteria that are often a prerequisite for funding applications. Organizing the first symposium requires the involvement of the scientific leaders who were most excited about the new relationship and its vision. Ideally, the symposium committee is gender balanced and has a healthy mix of young and seasoned scientists. Typically, at our QBI symposia (http://qbi.ucsf.edu/events/archive), we aim to have 50% of our speakers be female; we set this as a condition of the symposium, but we cannot always force the other side to do the same. While planning the first symposium, it is important to discuss the timing of a second one in order to establish a committed long-lasting relationship. It is imperative to have a similar number of speakers from both places for balance and carefully choose stellar scientists who are prone to collaborate to assure the objective of the first symposium. If possible, it can be very useful to engage funding agencies (from both sides if the symposium is international), in order to have their buy-in to the collaborative concept at its inception. In the United States, we often invite a speaker from federal funding agencies to give talks. Inviting industry contacts to attend and present may lead to alternative funding opportunities. Throughout the pandemic, we have also been successful by having first joint symposia online, followed by enthusiastic collaborations. This is a great option when facing lack of funds. Engage all possible beneficial parties: funding agencies, regional, national, international; industry relations interested in the specific topic; the corresponding embassy or consulate as well as journals. Almost all consulates have a Science Attaché and are a great liaison to national funding agencies and other funding sources. Create a buzz, and don’t be afraid to do it! Shortly after the first joint symposium, announce a call for proposals to maintain momentum. These joint proposals are funded by relatively small seed grants for projects that might be considered too risky for traditional funding institutions. However, once proven, the goal is to have these collaborations funded by more traditional federal agencies. If financial constraints exist, small external grants could be used to facilitate the collaborations. Do not be afraid to put pressure on leadership to help with reasonable seed funding, explaining the valuable investment that will bring more funds from other sources in the future. We often jointly fund 1-year projects where progress is shared with a large group at an ending event that is featured by the communications team. These events serve two purposes: (1) they hold the awardees accountable, and (2) they let the rest of the community know that the collaborative work objective is open to them as well, at the second annual symposium that will typically feature a new set of speakers."
https://openalex.org/W3138215308,"Background Postpartum contraceptive use is vital to improve maternal and child survival. It helps to have optimal child spacing, prevent unplanned pregnancies and associated adverse birth outcomes. However, postpartum contraceptive use in Tanzania remains low. Short median interval for resumption to sex after birth among African women has been associated with adverse maternal and child health wellbeing. This study aimed to assess optimal time to contraceptive use and predictors of time to contraceptive use after birth among women of reproductive age in Tanzania. Methods A cross section study using the TDHS 2015–16 data was used. A total of 3775 postpartum women were analyzed. Information on pregnancy, births and contraceptive use were recorded over the previous 5 years with the focus on most recent birth from the contraceptive calendar. Data analysis was performed using Stata 14.0. Analysis accounted for complex survey design. Time to modern contraceptive use after birth was computed using Kaplan Meier estimate. Adjusted time ratios with 95% CI were estimated using Weibull accelerated failure time models. Results A total weighted sample of 3775 women was analyzed. The median time to contraceptive use after birth was 7(IQR: 4–13) months, while for resumption to sex afterbirth was 2(IQR: 1–5) months. Factors such as never been married (TR: 1.63; 95%CI: 1.26–2.11) and breastfeeding (TR: 5.50; 95%CI: 4.12–7.35) were associated with longer time to postpartum contraceptive use. Belonging to richest wealth quintile (TR: 0.73; 95%CI: 0.54–0.99) and adopting long acting methods (TR: 0.70; 95%CI: 0.60–0.82) increased women’s likelihood of having shorter time to postpartum contraceptive use. Conclusion There was a time lag of five months from resumption of sex and initiation of postpartum contraception use. The interceptive measures to facilitate timely availing methods of women’s choice and promotion of utilization of maternal health care services may reduce delays in postpartum contraceptive use."
https://openalex.org/W3139128190,"Crop yield monitoring demonstrated the potential to improve agricultural productivity through improved crop breeding, farm management and commodity planning. Remote and proximal sensing offer the possibility to cut crop monitoring costs traditionally associated with surveys and censuses. Fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), chlorophyll concentration (CI) and normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) indices were used in crop monitoring, but their comparative performances in sorghum monitoring is lacking. This work aimed therefore at closing this gap by evaluating the performance of machine learning modelling of in-season sorghum biomass yields based on Sentinel-2-derived fAPAR and simpler high-throughput optical handheld meters-derived NDVI and CI calculated from sorghum plants reflectance. Bayesian ridge regression showed good cross-validated performance, and high reliability (R 2 = 35%) and low bias (mean absolute prediction error, MAPE = 0.4%) during the validation step. Hand-held optical meter-derived CI and Sentinel-2-derived fAPAR showed comparable effects on machine learning performance, but CI outperformed NDVI and was therefore considered as a good alternative to Sentinel-2’s fAPAR. The best times to sample the vegetation indices were the months of June (second half) and July. The results obtained in this work will serve several purposes including improvements in plant breeding, farming management and sorghum biomass yield forecasting at extension services and policy making levels."
https://openalex.org/W3136272502,"We study the gender differences in aversion to COVID-19 exposure using a natural experiment of the 2020 US Open. It was the first major tennis tournament after the season had been paused for six months, held with the same rules and prize money for men and women. We analyze the gender gap in the propensity to voluntarily withdraw because of COVID-19 concerns among players who were eligible and fit to play. We find that female players were significantly more likely than male players to have withdrawn from the 2020 US Open. While players from countries characterized by relatively high levels of trust and patience and relatively low levels of risk-taking were more likely to have withdrawn than their counterparts from other countries, female players exhibited significantly higher levels of aversion to pandemic exposure than male players even after cross-country differences in preferences are accounted for. About 15% of the probability of withdrawing that is explained by our model can be attributed to gender."
https://openalex.org/W3135956088,"In insect-pollinated crops, gene flow is affected by numerous factors including crop characteristics, mating system, life history, pollinators, and planting management practices. Previous studies have concentrated on the impact of distance between genetically engineered (GE) and conventional fields on adventitious presence (AP) which represents the unwanted presence of a GE gene. Variables other than distance, however, may affect AP. In addition, some AP is often present in the parent seed lots used to establish conventional fields. To identify variables that influence the proportion of AP in conventional alfalfa fields, we performed variable selection regression analyses. Analyses based on a sample-level and a field-level analysis gave similar, though not identical results. For the sample-level model, distance from the GE field explained 66% of the variance in AP, confirming its importance in affecting AP. The area of GE fields within the pollinator foraging range explained an additional 30% of the variation in AP in the model. The density of alfalfa leafcutting bee domiciles influenced AP in both models. To minimize AP in conventional alfalfa seed fields, management practices should focus on optimizing isolation distances while also considering the size of the GE pollen pool within the pollinator foraging range, and the foraging behavior of pollinators."
https://openalex.org/W3138324026,"Vocal fold scarring is a major cause of dysphonia. Vocal fold fibroblasts (VFFs) and the TGF-β signaling pathway play important roles in scar formation. Eupatilin, a chromone derivative of the Artemisia species, is a traditional folk remedy for wound healing. However, until recently, few studies investigated the therapeutic effects of eupatilin. We investigated the antifibrogenic effects of eupatilin on TGF-β1-treated human vocal fold fibroblasts (hVFFs). The optimal concentration of eupatilin was determined by a cell viability assay. Western blotting was used to measure the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin during myofibroblast differentiation, fibronectin (FN), collagen type I (Col I), and collagen type III (Col III) extracellular matrix proteins, and Smad2, Smad3, and p38 in the fibrotic pathway. Measurements were made before and after eupatilin treatment. Eupatilin at 100 nM was shown to be safe for use in hVFFs. TGF-β1 induced hVFFs to proliferate and differentiate into myofibroblasts and increased Col III and FN synthesis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Eupatilin suppressed TGF-β1-induced hVFF proliferation and differentiation into myofibroblasts through the Smad and p38 signaling pathways. Furthermore, eupatilin inhibited TGF-β1-induced FN, Col I, and Col III synthesis in hVFFs. Our in vitro findings show that eupatilin effectively suppressed TGF-β1-induced fibrotic changes in hVFFs via the Smad and p38 signaling pathways. Thus, eupatilin may be considered a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of vocal fold fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3138639918,"The aim of this online cross-sectional study is to identify the sources of scientific information used by Brazilian dentists in clinical decision-making and the barriers that they perceive as important to the incorporation of scientific evidence into clinical practice. A pretested questionnaire created in Google Forms which was made available to participants through links sent by e-mail or shared on Facebook® and Instagram® was used to collect the data between October 2018 and May 2019. Only dentists who were involved in direct or indirect care of patients (i.e. clinicians who performed dental procedures or dental educators who participated in the clinical training of graduate or postgraduate dental students) were asked to complete the questionnaire. The sample was comprised of 528 dentists (the response rate from the alumni database was 6.9%); their mean age was 45.2 years (±12.5) and 30.9% had an academic position. The majority were women (68.0%) and lived in Southern or Southeastern Brazil (96.0%). The sources of scientific information more frequently used by them in clinical decision-making were clinical guidelines (65.1%; 95% CI: 60.9, 69.2), scientific articles (56.8%; 95%CI: 52.5, 61.1) and bibliographic databases (48.3%; 95% CI: 43.9, 52.6). The information resource less frequently used was social media. The most important barriers to the clinical use of scientific evidence were: difficulty in determining whether scientific contents found on the Internet were reliable or not (41.8%; 95% CI: 37.6, 46.2), high cost of access to scientific papers (37.7%; 95% CI: 33.5, 41.9), and lack of time for reading scientific articles (32.4%; 95% CI: 28.4, 36.6). Although Brazilian dentists show a positive attitude towards obtaining scientific evidence from reliable sources, there still remain important barriers to the translation of evidence into practice. This can have significant implications for quality of care and should be further investigated."

This study aimed to investigate the predictive ability of artificial neural networks (ANN) and LASSO regression in terms of 5-year disease-specific survival. ANN work in a non-linear fashion, having a potential advantage in analysis of variables with complex correlations compared to regression models. LASSO is a type of regression analysis facilitating variable selection and regularization. A total of 440 patients undergoing surgical treatment for invasive IPMN of the pancreas registered in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database between 2004 and 2016 were analyzed. The dataset was prior to analysis randomly split into a modelling and test set (7:3). The accuracy, precision and F1 score for predicting mortality were 0.82, 0.83 and 0.89, respectively for ANN with variable selection compared to 0.79, 0.85 and 0.87, respectively for the LASSO-model. ANN using all variables showed similar accuracy, precision and F1 score of 0.81, 0.85 and 0.88, respectively compared to a logistic regression analysis. McNemar´s test showed no statistical difference between the models. The models showed high and similar performance with regard to accuracy and precision for predicting 5-year survival status."
https://openalex.org/W3139334698,"Approximately three percent of the human genome is occupied by microsatellites: a type of short tandem repeat (STR). Microsatellites have well established effects on (a) the genetic structure of diverse human populations and (b) expression of nearby genes. These lines of inquiry have uncovered 3,984 ethnically biased microsatellite loci (EBML) and 28,375 expression STRs (eSTRs), respectively. We hypothesize that a combination of EBML, eSTRs, and gene expression data (RNA-seq) can be used to show that microsatellites contribute to differential gene expression and phenotype in human populations. In fact, our previous study demonstrated a degree of mutual overlap between EBML and eSTRs but fell short of quantifying effects on gene expression. The present work aims to narrow the gap. First, we identify 313 overlapping EBML/eSTRs and recapitulate their mutual overlap. The 313 EBML/eSTRs are then characterized across ethnicity and tissue type. We use RNA-seq data to pursue validation of 49 regions that affect whole blood gene expression; 32 out of 54 affected genes are differentially expressed in Africans and Europeans. We quantify the relative contribution of these 32 genes to differential expression; fold change tends to be less than other differentially expressed genes. Repeat length correlates with expression for 15 of the 32 genes; two are conspicuously involved in glutathione metabolism. Finally, we repurpose a mathematical model of glutathione metabolism to investigate how a single polymorphic microsatellite affects phenotype. We conclude with a testable prediction that microsatellite polymorphisms affect GPX7 expression and oxidative stress in Africans and Europeans."
https://openalex.org/W3139348474,"Introduction and purpose Choroidal metastases (CM) are the most common intraocular malignancies. With longer survival rates for cancer patients, CM will be increasingly encountered. We evaluated clinical and ultrasonographic (US) characteristics of CM in order to identify diagnostic biomarkers that correlate with the primary tumor site. Methods The medical records of all patients with CM evaluated at the Ocular Oncology Unit between February 2010 and March 2020 were analyzed. Results 82 eyes of 70 patients were included. The primary cancer site was lung in 26 patients (37%), breast in 23 (33%), kidney in 9 (13%), gastrointestinal in 5 (7%), thyroid in 5 (7%), parathyroids and prostate respectively in 2 (3%). Fifty-five patients (78%) had other systemic metastases at the time of ocular diagnosis. Ten (14%) patients had no history of primary cancer. Bilateral CM were found in 20 patients (29%); fifty-six eyes (68%) had a single CM. The epicenter of CM was predominantly macula (43 eyes, 52%). The mean thickness was 4,1 mm (range 1,8–12,3). US structure was inhomogeneous in 67 eyes (82%). Reflectivity was mainly medium (39%) and medium-low (39%). In particular, CM from lung cancer showed lower reflectivity than those from the breast (p = 0,02). CM deriving from lung cancer were typically dome-shaped, whereas CM originating from breast were characteristically plateau shaped (p = 0,02). Seventy-four (91%) eyes presented fluid on optical coherence tomography. Conclusion We significatively found that CM from lung cancer generally appear dome-shaped with medium-low internal reflectivity, whereas those from breast cancer typically present a plateau appearance and higher internal reflectivity. Though it is hard to identify the site of the primary tumor relying exclusively on clinical and US aspects, morphology and internal reflectivity can be considered as diagnostic biomarkers. Thus, the origin of the primary tumor can be suspected by integrating a constellation of findings."

The overall objective of this study was to model growth and development of dill ‘Bouquet’ ( Anethum graveolens ), parsley ‘Giant of Italy’ ( Petroselinum crispum ), and watercress ( Nasturtium officinale ) in response to photosynthetic daily light integral (DLI) and mean daily temperature (MDT). Plants were grown hydroponically in five greenhouse compartments with MDTs ranging from 9.7 to 27.2 °C under 0%, 30%, or 50% shade cloth to create DLIs ranging from 6.2 to 16.9 mol·m ‒2 ·d ‒1 . MDT and DLI interacted to influence dill fresh mass and height, and watercress maximum quantum yield of dark adapted leaves (F v /F m ), height, and branch number while only MDT affected dill leaf number and watercress fresh mass and branch length. Besides dry matter concentration (DMC), parsley was influenced by MDT and not DLI. Increasing MDT from ≈10 to 22.4 °C (parsley) or 27.2 °C (dill and watercress), linearly or near-linearly increased fresh mass. For dill, increasing DLI decreased fresh mass when MDT was low (9.7 to 13.9 °C) and increased fresh mass when MDT was high (18.4 to 27.2 °C). DMC of dill, parsley, and watercress increased as MDT decreased or DLI increased, indicating a higher proportion of plant fresh mass is water at higher MDTs or lower DLIs. With these data we have created growth and development models for culinary herbs to aid in predicting responses to DLI and MDT."
https://openalex.org/W3136335079,"Mitochondria are commonly viewed as highly elongated organelles with regularly spaced mtDNA genomes organized as compact nucleoids that generate the local transcripts essential for production of mitochondrial ribosomes and key components of the respiratory chain. In contrast, A549 human lung carcinoma cells frequently contain apparently swollen mitochondria harboring multiple discrete mtDNA nucleoids and RNA processing granules in a contiguous matrix compartment. While this seemingly aberrant mitochondrial morphology is akin to ""mito-bulbs"" previously described in cells exposed to a variety of genomic stressors, it occurs in A549 cells under typical culture conditions. We provide a detailed confocal and super-resolution microscopic investigation of the incidence of such mito-bulbs in A549 cells. Most mito-bulbs appear stable, engage in active replication and transcription, and maintain respiration but feature an elevated oxidative environment. High concentrations of glucose and/or L-glutamine in growth media promote a greater incidence of mito-bulbs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that treatment of A549 cells with TGFβ suppresses the formation of mito-bulbs while treatment with a specific TGFβ pathway inhibitor substantially increases incidence. This striking heterogeneity of mitochondrial form and function may play an important role in a variety of diseases involving mitochondrial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3136374576,"Improving the effectiveness of route planning, especially in road transport deliveries is a challenge we need to face in the context of advancing climate change and the sustainable development goals. The main aim of the paper is to demonstrate the above average and utilitarian significance of the multiple probabilistic traveling salesman problem (MPTSP) in the coordination and modeling of sustainable product transportation, which is a novelty at the theoretical, conceptual, methodological and empirical level. We propose a new, hybrid algorithm of solving MPTSP instances (it connects harmony search, k-means and 2-opt), which can be successfully used in economic practice for coordination and modeling of Industry 4.0. The effectiveness of proposed approach is tested using a case study of drugs distribution services and datasets obtained from the transportation enterprise located in Poland. The study focuses on the issue of planning routes, with particular emphasis on the changing demand of customers. It should be stressed that this work may be of interest to researchers but also to management practitioners. The value added of this research lies in the innovative modeling the coordination of sustainable drug transportation as an instance of MPTSP and proposing an effective method to solve it. The main research results confirm that proposed method contributes to overall sustainability of studied supply chain."
https://openalex.org/W3137631677,"Hyperuricemia is highly prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, but the evidence for a relationship between uric acid (UA) and clinical outcomes in CKD patients is limited and inconsistent. We hypothesized that UA has a different impact on clinical outcomes according to the underlying disease causing CKD.This study prospectively investigated the associations between UA and renal and non-renal outcomes according to the underlying disease causing CKD in 2,797 Japanese patients under the care of nephrologists. The patients were categorized into four groups: primary renal disease (n = 1306), hypertensive nephropathy (n = 467), diabetic nephropathy (n = 275), and other nephropathy (n = 749). The renal outcome was defined as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and the non-renal outcome was defined as a composite endpoint of cardiovascular events (CVEs) and all-cause mortality.During a median 4.8-year follow-up, 359 (12.8%) patients reached the renal outcome, and 260 (9.3%) reached the non-renal outcome. In the all-patient analysis, hyperuricemia was not associated with the risks for renal and non-renal outcomes, but in primary renal disease (PRD) and hypertensive renal disease (HTN) patients, hyperuricemia was significantly associated with non-renal outcomes. Per 1 mg/dl higher UA level, multivariable adjusted hazard ratio was 1.248 (95% CI: 1.003 to 1.553) for PRD, and 1.250 (1.035 to 1.510) for HTN. Allopurinol did not reduce the risks for renal and non-renal outcomes, both in all patients and in the subgroup analysis.The effect of hyperuricemia on clinical outcomes in CKD patients varies according to the underlying disease causing CKD. Hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for non-renal outcomes in primary renal disease and hypertensive renal disease patients. Allopurinol did not decrease the risks for renal and non-renal outcomes."

We employ anchoring vignettes to correct for heterogeneous scale use in these non-cognitive skills. Our data are gathered among first-year students at a Dutch university. The results show that Conscientiousness is positively related to student performance, but the estimates are strongly biased upward if we use the uncorrected variables. We do not find significant relationships for Emotional Stability but find that the point estimates are larger when using the uncorrected variables. Measured Risk Preference is negatively related to student performance, yet this is fully explained by heterogeneous scale use. These results indicate the importance of using more objective measurements of personality traits."
https://openalex.org/W3136756950,"The circadian system produces ~24-hr oscillations in behavioral and physiological processes to ensure that they occur at optimal times of day and in the correct temporal order. At its core, the circadian system is composed of dedicated central clock neurons that keep time through a cell-autonomous molecular clock. To produce rhythmic behaviors, time-of-day information generated by clock neurons must be transmitted across output pathways to regulate the downstream neuronal populations that control the relevant behaviors. An understanding of the manner through which the circadian system enacts behavioral rhythms therefore requires the identification of the cells and molecules that make up the output pathways. To that end, we recently characterized the Drosophila pars intercerebralis (PI) as a major circadian output center that lies downstream of central clock neurons in a circuit controlling rest:activity rhythms. We have conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to identify potential circadian output genes expressed by PI cells, and used cell-specific RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down expression of ~40 of these candidate genes selectively within subsets of PI cells. We demonstrate that knockdown of the slowpoke ( slo ) potassium channel in PI cells reliably decreases circadian rest:activity rhythm strength. Interestingly, slo mutants have previously been shown to have aberrant rest:activity rhythms, in part due to a necessary function of slo within central clock cells. However, rescue of slo in all clock cells does not fully reestablish behavioral rhythms, indicating that expression in non-clock neurons is also necessary. Our results demonstrate that slo exerts its effects in multiple components of the circadian circuit, including PI output cells in addition to clock neurons, and we hypothesize that it does so by contributing to the generation of daily neuronal activity rhythms that allow for the propagation of circadian information throughout output circuits."
https://openalex.org/W3136912982,"Based on the principal-agent theory and the financial management theory, this study analyzes the impact of fund shareholding on corporate insufficient R&amp;D input, and explores the action mechanism of fund shareholding on corporate innovation activities. The results show that fund shareholding is helpful to inhibit the insufficient R&amp;D input. Moreover, this inhibiting effect is mainly reflected in the case of higher risk of financial failure. The further analyses show that the higher level of marketization strengthens the inhibiting effect of fund shareholding on insufficient R&amp;D input. Finally, it is suggested that fund companies should be encouraged to hold shares of listed companies, and the proposal power of fund companies in the shareholders’ meeting should be appropriately enhanced. And it is suggested that the regulators continue to promote the development of securities investment funds, and guide fund shareholding to play an active role in external governance. Also, it is suggested that the regulators promote the process of regional marketization, to strengthen the positive effect of fund shareholding on innovation activities."
https://openalex.org/W3136161956,"A pregnancy that has been complicated with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection results in typical management problems for both the mother and the newborn. One of the universal efforts in tackling the impact of chronic HBV is the prevention of mother-to-child transmission during Antenatal care via prompt screening as the majority of chronic infections globally harbored during this period. Rewarding result have been achieved in reducing this problem at this period of life through maternal screening programs and universal vaccination of infants. This study was aimed at assessing the seroprevalence and associated risk factor of HBV among pregnant women attending Antenatal Care (ANC) in Dilla University Referral Hospital (DURH), Southern Ethiopia.A facility- based cross- sectional study was conducted from December 01 to May 30, 2017 among pregnant women attending ANC. A total of 236 pregnant women were included in this study. All Pregnant women who were attending antenatal clinic and were volunteer during the study period were included, whereas those women who were unable to communicate due to any problem, and not volunteer to give informed consent were excluded. Volunteer participants were asked to complete a questionnaire and had offered to test for HBsAg infection. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 20 software. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between dependent and independent variables.From 215 pregnant women attending ANC, the prevalence of HBsAg by the rapid test was found to be 11 (5.1%). Among the study participants, 91.1% (215) were tested for HIV antibody during the ANC visit, with the positivity rate of 4.5%. The result showed 1.86% of the study participants who were tested for HIV were also positive for HBsAg. Among those factors affecting the transmission of HBV infection, multiple partners and HIV confection have significant association at P-value less than 0.05.The Seropositivity of Hepatitis B Virus among Pregnant Women was found to be significant and hence, routine screening of pregnant mother at Antenatal care for this virus, and subsequent management according to the guideline for both the mother and child is recommended."

Several methods have recently been proposed for estimating the association between health outcomes and exposure to chemical mixtures, but a formal simulation study comparing broad-ranging methods is lacking. We select five recently developed methods and evaluate their performance in estimating the exposure-response function, identifying active mixture components, and identifying interactions in a simulation study. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) and nonparametric Bayes shrinkage (NPB) were top-performing methods in our simulation study. BKMR and NPB outperformed other contemporary methods and traditional linear models in estimating the exposure-response function and identifying active mixture components.

https://openalex.org/W3138293518,"Background We evaluated the effect of adenosine upon mechanisms sustaining persistent AF through analysis of contact electrograms and ECGI mapping. Methods Persistent AF patients undergoing catheter ablation were included. ECGI maps and cycle length (CL) measurements were recorded in the left and right atrial appendages and repeated following boluses of 18 mg of intravenous adenosine. Potential drivers (PDs) were defined as focal or rotational activations completing ≥ 1.5 revolutions. Distribution of PDs was assessed using an 18 segment biatrial model. Results 46 patients were enrolled. Mean age was 63.4 ± 9.8 years with 33 (72%) being male. There was no significant difference in the number of PDs recorded at baseline compared to adenosine (42.1 ± 15.2 vs 40.4 ± 13.0; p = 0.417), nor in the number of segments harbouring PDs, (13 (11–14) vs 12 (10–14); p = 0.169). There was a significantly higher percentage of PDs that were focal in the adenosine maps (36.2 ± 15.2 vs 32.2 ± 14.4; p &lt; 0.001). There was a significant shortening of CL in the adenosine maps compared to baseline which was more marked in the right atrium than left atrium (176.7 ± 34.7 vs 149.9 ± 27.7 ms; p &lt; 0.001 and 165.6 ± 31.7 vs 148.3 ± 28.4 ms; p = 0.003). Conclusion Adenosine led to a small but significant shortening of CL which was more marked in the right than left atrium and may relate to shortening of refractory periods rather than an increase in driver burden or distribution.

https://openalex.org/W3139365136,"Prostate cancer differently affects different regions of the world, displaying higher rates in more developed areas. After the implementation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, several studies described rising rates globally, but it is possible that indolent lesions are being detected given the lack of changes in mortality data. The Brazilian government recommends against PSA screening in the male population regardless of age, but the Urology Society issued a report recommending that screening should start at 50 years old for certain men and for those aged ≥75 years with a life expectancy exceeding 10 years. In this study, we examined the incidence and mortality rates of invasive prostate cancer over time in the Sergipe state of Brazil. The databases of the Aracaju Cancer Registry and Mortality Information System were used to calculate age-standardized rates for all prostate tumors (International Classification of Diseases 10th edition: C61 and D07.5) in the following age ranges: 20–44, 45–54, and ≥65 years. We identified 3595 cases of cancer, 30 glandular intraepithelial high-grade lesions, and 3269 deaths. Using the Joinpoint Regression Program, we found that the incidence of prostate cancer dramatically increased over time until the mid-2000s for all age groups, after which the rates declined. Prostate cancer mortality rates increased until 2005, followed by a non-significant annual percent change of 22.0 in 2001–2005 and a stable rate thereafter. We noticed that the increases and decreases of the incidence rates of prostate cancer were associated with the screening recommendations. Meanwhile, the increased mortality rates did not appear to be associated with decreased PSA testing; instead, they were linked to the effects of age and improvements in identification of the cause of death. Thus, we do not believe a PSA screening program would benefit the population of this study."
https://openalex.org/W3137475921,"Understanding age-mixing patterns in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) transmission networks can enhance the design and implementation of HIV prevention strategies in sub-Saharan Africa. Due to ethical consideration, it is less likely possible to conduct a benchmark study to assess which sampling strategy, and sub-optimal sampling coverage which can yield best estimates for these patterns. We conducted a simulation study, using phylogenetic trees to infer estimates of age-mixing patterns in HIV transmission, through the computation of proportions of pairings between men and women, who were phylogenetically linked across different age groups (15–24 years, 25–39 years, and 40–49 years); and the means, and standard deviations of their age difference. We investigated also the uncertainty around these estimates as a function of the sampling coverage in four sampling strategies: when missing sequence data were missing completely at random (MCAR), and missing at random (MAR) with at most 30%—50%—70% of women in different age groups being in the sample. The results suggested that age-mixing patterns in HIV transmission can be unveiled from proportions of phylogenetic pairings between men and women across age groups; and the mean, and standard deviation of their age difference. A 55% sampling coverage was sufficient to provide the best values of estimates of age-mixing patterns in HIV transmission with MCAR scenario. But we should be cautious in interpreting proportions of men phylogenetically linked to women because they may be overestimated or underestimated, even at higher sampling coverage. The findings showed that, MCAR was the best sampling strategy. This means, it is advisable not to use sequence data collected in settings where we can find a systematic imbalance of age and gender to investigate age-mixing in HIV transmission. If not possible, ensure to take into consideration the imbalance in interpreting the results."
https://openalex.org/W3136604466,"Introduction Neurotrauma is an important but preventable cause of death and disability worldwide, with the majority being associated with road traffic collisions (RTCs). The greatest burden is seen in low -and middle- income countries (LMICs) where variations in the environment, infrastructure, population and habits can challenge the success of conventional preventative approaches. It is therefore necessary to understand local perspectives to allow for the development and implementation of context-specific strategies which are effective and sustainable. Methods This study took place in Colombia where qualitative data collection was carried out with ten key informants between October and November 2019. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and explored perceptions on RTCs and neurotrauma, preventative strategies and interventions, and the role of research in prevention. Interview transcripts were analysed by thematic analysis using a framework approach. Results Participants’ confirmed that RTCs are a significant problem in Colombia with neurotrauma as an important outcome. Human and organisational factors were identified as key causes of the high rates of RTCs. Participants described the current local preventative strategies, but were quick to discuss limitations and challenges to their success. Key barriers reported were poor attitudes and knowledge, particularly in the community. Suggestions were provided on ways to improve prevention through better education and awareness, stricter enforcement and new policies on prevention, proper budgeting and resource allocation, as well as through collaboration and changes in attitudes and leadership. Participants identified four key research areas they felt would influence prevention of RTCs and associated neurotrauma: causes of RTCs; consequences and impact of RTCs; public involvement in research; improving prevention. Conclusion RTCs are a major problem in Colombia despite the current preventative strategies and interventions. Findings from this study have a potential to influence policy, practice and research by illustrating different solutions to the challenges surrounding prevention and by highlighting areas for further research."

The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were built along with other classifiers. The model was tested on participants recruited from January 2020-October 2020 and deployed into CUHAS-ROBUST (index test) application. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were obtained for assessment.A total of 487 participants (32 Multidrug-Resistant/MDR 57 RR-TB, 398 drug-sensitive) were recruited for model building and 157 participants (23 MDR and 21 RR) in prospective testing. The ANN full model yields the highest values of accuracy (88% (95% CI 85-91)), and sensitivity (84% (95% CI 76-89)) compare to other models that show sensitivity below 80% (Logistic Regression 32%, Decision Tree 44%, Random Forest 25%, Extreme Gradient Boost 25%). However, this ANN has lower specificity among other models (90% (95% CI 86-93)) where Logistic Regression demonstrates the highest (99% (95% CI 97-99)). This ANN model was selected for the CUHAS-ROBUST application, although still lower than the sensitivity of global GeneXpert results (87.5%).The ANN-CUHAS ROBUST outperforms other AI classifiers model in detecting all type of RR-TB, and by deploying into the application, the health staff can utilize the tool for screening purposes particularly at the primary care level where the GeneXpert examination is not available.NCT04208789."

The aim of this study was to determine specific risk factors promoting the development of peri- and postoperative hepatopathy after surgery for congenital heart disease. In this retrospective study, we identified 20 consecutive patients operated between 2011 and 2019 from our institutional cohort who developed significant postsurgical hepatic dysfunction. These patients were compared to a control group of 30 patients with comparable initial cardiac conditions and STS-EACTS risk score. Patients who developed hepatopathy in the intensive care unit have chronic cholestasis and decreased liver synthesis. The impact of postoperative hepatopathy on morbidity was marked. In six patients (30%), liver transplantation was executed as ultima ratio, and two (10%) were listed for liver transplantation. The overall mortality related to postoperative hepatopathy is high: We found nine patients (45%) having severe hepatopathy and mostly multiple organ dysfunction who died in the postoperative course. According to risk analysis, postoperative right and left heart dysfunction in combination with a postoperative anatomical residuum needing a re-operation or re-intervention in the postoperative period is associated with a high risk for the development of cardiac hepatopathy. Furthermore, postoperative complications (pleural effusion, heart rhythm disorders, etc.), postoperative infections, and the need for parenteral nutrition also raise the risk for cardiac hepatopathy. Further investigations are needed to reduce hepatic complications and improve the general prognosis of such complex patients."
