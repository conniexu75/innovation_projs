https://openalex.org/W1515213049,"A method is described for radioiodination to high specific activity of fixed and stained proteins within sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, without elution of the proteins from the gel. Following radioiodination, the proteins can be removed from the gel by trypsin treatment and the peptides analyzed. This procedure offers a means to structurally compare the proteins of multicomponent systems when purification of each component to homogeneity is unfeasible. Using this technique, we have compared the tryptic peptides of all the major protein components of Moloney and Rauscher leukemia viruses using only 50 to 100 microgram of total protein from each virus. Additionally, we have analyzed the membrane proteins of Dictyostelium discoideum at various stages in development. The validity of the technique and its value as a tool for comparative studies and identification of precursor-product relationships is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1480181846,"The aggregation of cells from dissociated neural retinas of chick embryos can be inhibited by antibodies prepared against whole retinal cells. In order to identify the antigens involved, substances released by retinal tissues in culture were tested for their ability to neutralize specifically the inhibition by antibody of cell adhesion. Using this assay, three active polypeptides from the culture supernatant were purified 500-fold by gel filtration and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Rabbit antibodies prepared against these purified supernatant activities inhibited cell adhesion and reacted only with the three polypeptides. Immunoprecipitation by the specific antibodies of 3H-labeled proteins from a detergent extract of embryonic retinal cell membranes yielded a polypeptide having a Mr of 140,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate. This precipitation was inhibited in the presence of the three culture supernatant polypeptides that had activity, suggesting that they contained antigenic determinants in common with the 140,000 Mr surface component. They therefore represent all or parts of this cell surface molecule that were released into solution during tissue culture. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the 140,000 Mr polypeptide is intimately involved in initial adhesion among neural cells."
https://openalex.org/W1653543413,"An immunologically based method for the quantitative assay of molecules involved in cell adhesion is described. Three observations served as a basis for this assay: (a) cells obtained by trypsinization of retinal tissue aggregated rapidly, provided they had been allowed to recover in culture from the dissociation process; (b) treatment of chick retinal cells with Fab' fragments from rabbit antibodies against these cells prevented their aggregation; and (c) incubation of these antibody fragments with antigens released by retinal cells in culture neutralized their ability to inhibit aggregation. The amount of neutralizing antigen was determined by measuring the rates of cell aggregation in the presence and absence of antibody and antigen using a particle counter. Although adhesion was inhibited by anti-retinal cell antibodies, it was not affected by lectins or anti-carbohydrate antibodies that also were bound to the cell surface. Together, the results suggest that the inhibition involved blockade or inactivation of particular cell surface molecules and that the retinal cell antigens capable of neutralizing the antibodies represented these molecules or their fragments. In the accompanying paper, we describe the use of this assay for the purification from culture supernatants of a cell surface molecule involved in cell to cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1513182170,"The summation of the effects of two or more reversible inhibitors of various types on the initial velocity of enzyme systems obeying Michaelis-Menten kinetics is described by the the general relation: (formula: see text) wherein v1,2,3...n is the velocity of reaction in the simultaneous presence of n inhibitors, vi is the velocity observed in the presence of each individual inhibitor, and v0 is the velocity in the absence of inhibition. The derivation is based on the assumption that each enzyme species can combine with no more than one of the inhibitors (i.e. the inhibitors are mutually exclusive). The above relationship holds irrespective of the number of inhibitors, the type of inhibition (competitive, noncompetitive, or uncompetitive), or the kinetic mechanism (sequential or ping-pong) of the enzyme reaction under consideration. Deviations from this equality define synergism or antagonism of inhibitors depending on whether the value of the left side of the above equation is greater or smaller than the right, respectively. Knowledge of the kinetic constants for substrates and inhibitors is not required. If two or more inhibitors act independently (i.e. are not mutually exclusive), their combined effects are necessarily synergistic. Under certain circumstances, described in the text, mutually nonexclusive inhibitors obey the fractional velocity product relationship: v1,2,3...n/v0 = (v1/v0) x (v2/v0) x (v3/v0)...(vn/v0)."

https://openalex.org/W2299440952,"A direct correlation between rates of condensation and overall chain elongation has been observed with palmitoylCoA, 6,9-octadecadienoyl-CoA, and 6,9,12-octadecatrienoylCoA. Rates of condensation and overall chain elongation were all depressed when microsomes were used from rats raised on a balanced uersus a fat-free diet. This effect was more pronounced for palmitoyl-CoA than for the unsaturated substrates. The rates of the /?-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrase and 2-truns-enoyl-CoA reductase reactions were always much higher than for condensation and were not altered by dietary change. These findings show that condensation is rate-limiting and implicate it in overall control of chain elongation. In addition, a difference in the rate of Nethylmaleimide inhibition for condensation activity with palmitoyl-CoA versus unsaturated substrates provides direct evidence for the involvement of at least one different enzyme in the condensation systems using saturated versus polyunsaturated primers. Rates of both the condensation and 2-trans-enoyl-CoA reductase reactions were always elevated when bovine serum albumin was included in the incubations. In the absence of albumin, 20 to 30"

https://openalex.org/W1598771652,"The complete amino acid sequence of rabbit skeletal muscle troponin C (TnC) was determined from studies on overlapping peptides isolated from cyanogen bromide and tryptic digests. TnC was found to be a single polypeptide chain of 159 amino acid residues, including 2 residues of tyrosine and 1 each of cysteine, histidine, and proline. The amino end is acetylated, the calculated net charge at pH 7.0 is -29, and the calculated molecular weight is 17,965. There was no evidence for heterogeneity in the sequence. The previously proposed four apparent Ca2+ binding sites are located at residues 27 to 38, 63 to 74, 103 to 114, and 139 to 150."
https://openalex.org/W1602097684,Human platelet factor 4 was purified by a method employing affinity chromatography on heparin/agarose. The amino acid sequence of the protein was determined by automatic Edman degradations and carboxypeptidase Y digestion. There are 70 amino acids in the protein with 5 of the 8 negatively charged residues clustered near the NH2 terminus and 10 of the 13 positively charged residues in clusters of 3 and 4 elsewhere in the protein. Small crystals have been obtained from ammonium sulfate solutions which give a promising preliminary x-ray diffraction pattern.
https://openalex.org/W1513136721,"In this report we describe the purification and structural characterization of a near homogeneous preparation of DNA polymerase-alpha that we have obtained from cultured human KB cells. When analyzed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, velocity gradient centrifugation, and isoelectric focusing, the enzyme activity demonstrates a constancy of gel mobility, sedimentation coefficient, and isoelectric point during the final three chromatographic steps of the purification. Native gel electrophoresis of the penultimate polymerase fraction at seven concentrations of acrylamide reveals co-migration of the enzyme activity with a single discernible protein band, at constant specific activity, and indicates that the polymerase protein is electrophoretically homogeneous at this stage. The purified enzyme has a sedimentation coefficient of 7.1 to 7.2 S at high or low ionic strength, a molecular weight gel filtration of 149,000, and an isoelectric point of pH 5.0 to 5.2. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel analyses demonstrate that the polymerase-alpha molecule is a dimer comprised of two dissimilar subunits of 76,000 and 66,000 daltons that are present in equimolar ratio."

https://openalex.org/W1589855871,"Lysozyme mRNA was translated in a reticulocyte lysate with mixtures of radioactive amino acids. The in vitro product isolated by immunoprecipitation was shown by gel electrophoresis, peptide mapping, and sequence analysis to be larger than lysozyme synthesized in vivo. An NH2-terminal extension was completely sequenced by automated Edman degradation; the phenylthiohydantoins from each cycle were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography and quantitated by scintillation spectroscopy. The NH2-terminal sequence of pre-lysozyme is: (formula: see text) where lysine is the NH2 terminus of lysozyme. Sixteen of the eighteen residues in this sequence are hydrophobic and in this regard it resembles the partial sequences recently elucidated for other secretory proteins. The NH2-terminal methionine is donated by initiator Met-tRNAfMet; thus, this sequence represents the primary translation product. This 18-amino acid sequence is cleaved from lysozyme in vivo before the lysozyme molecules are completely synthesized."

https://openalex.org/W2415569945,"Zinc ion-induced assembly of tubulin was followed using electron microscopy and turbidimetric measurements. A scheme utilizing repeated cycles of assembly and disassembly was used to prepare tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) (Shelanski, M. L., Gaskin, F., and Cantor, C. R. (1973) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 70, 765-768). Tubulin was further purified by phosphocellulose chromatography to remove the MAPs (Weingarten, M., Lockwood, A. H., Hwo, S-Y, and Kirschner, M. W. (1975) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 72, 1858-1862). In tubulin preparations containing MAPs and added GTP, Zn2+-induced sheets of 15 to 60 protofilaments oriented in parallel. In the absence of MAPs and/or added GTP, Zn2+ induced the formation of sheets which wrapped quite specifically and serial sections were often consistent with a tubular structure of approximately 220 nm. The assembly of recycled tubulin + GTP and 0 to 1 mM Zn2+ was analyzed by A350 as a function of time at 30 degrees. The greater the concentration of Zn2+, the shorter the lag time, the faster the rate after the lag, and the greater the plateau value of A350. Although turbidimetric measurements can be used to quantitate microtubules, they are not quantitative for Zn2+-induced sheets."

The resulting nucleoprotein complex sediments at 9 S, has an increased molecular ellipticity at 280 nm, and has DNase I-susceptible sites at 10 nucleotide intervals. Nucleosomes containing a 32P label at the 5'-DNA termini were digested sequentially with trypsin and DNase I. Following trypsin digestion, the segments of nucleosome DNA 20 to 35 and 60 to 80 nucleotides from the 5' end became more susceptible to DNase I, suggesting that these segments interact with the trypsin-sensitive regions of the histones."
https://openalex.org/W1577627620,"A variant of the major transmembrane protein of the human erythrocyte has been detected following proteolytic digestion of intact erythrocytes. Pronase digestion of normal erythrocytes gives rise to a 60,000 molecular weight fragment of Protein 3, while digestion of erythrocytes with the variant protein produces two fragments of 60,000 and 63,000 molecular weight when peptides are separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis using the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (Laemmli, U. K. (1970) Nature 227, 680-685). The two fragments cannot be resolved if electrophoresis is conducted using the continuous phosphate or Tris/acetate buffer systems. This increased molecular weight of the variant fragment does not appear to be due to increased glycosylation, since neither sialic acid residues nor terminal galactose units can be detected. Furthermore, the transmembrane segment of Protein 3 can be detected after proteolytic digestion at both the external and cytoplasmic membrane surfaces. These transmembrane segments of both the normal and the variant peptide have identical molecular weights of 20,000 to 21,000. These results suggest that the increased molecular weight of the variant peptide is due to the incorporation of an additional segment into that region of the molecule which is exposed at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1496688787,"Quantitative cleavage of peptide bonds adjacent to tryptophanyl and methionyl residues in the polar moiety of cytochrome b5 was effected using cyanogen bromide in the presence of heptafluorobutyric and formic acids. Application of this method to native cytochrome b5 resulted in cleavage at tryptophanyl and methionyl residues in the polar and membranous segments in high yield. Amino acid analysis of peptides isolated from such digests indicated that tyrosine was modified and the derivative eluted in a position preceding lysine; however, the color constant with ninhydrin remained unchanged. Hydriodic acid hydrolysis of the phenylthiohydantoin derivative of the modified tyrosine regenerated the parent amino acid. Peptides containing the altered tyrosine remained susceptible to chymotryptic cleavage at this residue. Cleavage of methionyl bonds could be prevented by methylene blue-sensitized photooxidation prior to cyanogen bromide/anhydrous heptafluorobutyric acid treatment. The conditions employed for photooxidation were selective for methionyl residues, and the yield and specificity of tryptophanyl cleavage by the cyanogen bromide/anhydrous heptafluorobutyric acid method was unaffected."
https://openalex.org/W1601943691,"Five peaks of endonuclease activity showing a preference for ultraviolet-damaged DNA have been chromatographically identified from extracts of Micrococcus luteus. They are numerically designated as I to V in order of their elution from phosphocellulose (Whatman P-11) columns. The first two of these peaks have been highly purified by a combination of gel filtration and affinity chromatography and are catalytically homogeneous judging from their effect on transforming DNAs. Peak I, which has an isoelectric point of 4.7, is heat-stable, requires high ionic strength for optimal activity, acts with equal facility on ultraviolet-irradiated native and denatured DNA, and has been designated as Py pyrimidine dimer Py correndonuclease I. Peak II which has a pI value of 8.7, is heat-labile, is inhibited by high ionic strength, acts on ultraviolet-irradiated native but not denatured DNA, and has been designated as Py pyrimidine dimer Py correndonuclease II. Both enzymes are inhibited by Ca2+ and Zn2+, do not show any cofactor or sulfhydryl requirement, act optimally between pH 7.0 and 7.4, and have molecular weights between 11,000 and 15,000. Py pyrimidine dimer Py correndonuclease I requires a dose about 1.6 times that for Py pyrimidine dimers Py correndonuclease II for incision saturation of irradiated phiX174 RFI DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1575049484,"Human lymphoblastoid interferon was produced on an 800-liter scale (2.6 X 10(9) units) by induction of Namalva cells with Newcastle disease virus, strain B1. The interferon was partially purified by anti-leukocyte interferon affinity chromatography, sulfopropyl Sephadex ion exchange chromatography, isoelectric focusing, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Recovery of interferon after gel electrophoresis varied from 11 to 33% based on the original crude material, with about 35,000-fold purification. The gel electrophoresis resolved the antiviral activity into two components with apparent molecular weights of 18,000 and 22,000; treatment with glycosidases resulted in all the activity being associated with the lower molecular weight species. Interferon activity could be completely (85 to 113%) recovered from the gels by elution into a buffer containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. The presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate did not appear to affect the assay of interferon. The protein could also be completely (75 to 106%) eluted from gels stained with coomassie blue, again with no loss in activity."

https://openalex.org/W1623619095,"Extraction of membrane proteins from erythrocytes into sonicated phosphatidylcholine vesicles is described. In a process involving phospholipid and neutral lipid exchange, cell membrane proteins associate with the vesicles and can be separated from the cells by centrifugation. The protein transfer appears to be reversible; phospholipid vesicles mediate the delivery of small amounts of previously extracted protein into cell membranes. Prior to extraction, all but one of the proteins are accessible to lactoperoxidase iodination, and lipid analysis indicates that primarily the outer monolayer of the cell is involved in phospholipid exchange. Among the extracted proteins is acetylcholinesterase which is removed much more efficiently by this procedure than by concentrated salt solutions. The most abundant proteins of the erythrocyte membrane are not represented in the vesicle extract."

The method of purification involved chromatography of the DEAE-flowthrough protein successively on phosvitin-Sepharose and casein-Sepharose followed by rechromatography on phosvitin-Sepharose. The purified enzyme has an s20,w and molecular weight of 3.7 and 47,000, respectively, as determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation in 0.4 M NaCl. A similar molecular weight of 42,000 was determined by gel filtration using Sephadex G-100. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme revealed a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of 25,000. Protein kinase NI therefore consists of a dimer of two identical subunits.

This enzyme has a molecular weight of 40,000 and is composed of two subunits of equal size, which are joined by noncovalent interactions. Manganese constituted 0.13% of this superoxide dismutase. T,is is equivalent to 1 manganese atom/molecule of enzyme. Cyanide at 5 mM and H2O2 at 3 mM had no effect on the activity of this superoxide dismutase but 20 mM azide caused 50% inhibition. The isoelectric point, assessed by isoelectric focusing, is 4.2. The optical spectrum of this enzyme exhibited a maximum at 280 nm (Em = 49,000 M-1 cm-1) and a broad band centered at 450 nm (Em = 170 M-1 cm-1). Exposure to a pH of 3.8 in the presence of 8.0 M urea labilized the manganese and allowed the preparation of a colorless and inactive apoenzyme which could be reconstituted by subsequent treatment with MnCl2. The reconstituted enzyme was found to have regained both manganese and activity. The amino acid composition was also determined. The P. cruentum superoxide dismutase did not cross-react with antibody to the Escherichia coli manganese-containing superoxide dismutase."

Examination of the amino acid sequence of these second species indicates that nucleases B1, B2, and B3 apparently contain the same sequence as that of nuclease A with an extra sequence Ser-Gln-Thr-Asp-Asx-Gly-Val-Asx-Arg-Ser-Gly-Ser-Glu-Asp-Pro-Thr-Val-Tyr-Ser linked through a peptide bond to the NH2 terminus of the nuclease A portion. In nuclease B1 the 2 residues indicated by Asx are aspartic acid, in nuclease B2 the first and the second Asx from the NH2 terminus are aspartic acid and asparagine, respectively, and in nuclease B3 both Asx are asparagine. These second species do not contain a significant amount of carbohydrate. The extra amino acid sequence appears to be flexible and does not interfere with the ordered structure and function of the nuclease A portion. The nuclease A portion was recovered, in part, from a mixture of these nuclease B species after digestion with staphylococcal protease in the presence of ligands, deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate, and calcium ion. Thus, these nuclease B species may be closely related to, if not identical with, a precursor of nuclease A. Similar second species of nuclease have been found in strain V8."

https://openalex.org/W1534459294,"The oxygen exchange that occurs between water and the gamma-PO3 of ATP in light-activated chloroplast lamellae was found to proceed with close to full equilibration of the oxygens before ATP returned to the medium. This is in contrast to the entry of approximately one water oxygen when ATP is synthesized from ADP and P1 in the same system. In the latter case, the limitation is kinetic, however, not steric, as shown by the presence of some molecules containing more than one water-derived oxygen in the gamma-PO3. The different extents of exchange can be explained by a relatively faster rate of dissociation of ATP from the chloroplast coupling factor during synthesis from ADP and P1 relative to its dissociation in the absence of net phosphorylation. To determine the mechanism of gamma-PO3:H2O exchange, its rate was compared with the rate of reversible cleavage of ATP as detected by betagamma bridge to beta nonbridge 18O scrambling in [Pbeta-18O-Pgamma]ATP (Midelfort, C. F., and Rose, I. A. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5881-5887). The scrambling reaction, which depends on cleavage of the PbetaO--Pgamma bond, was found to occur in nearly the same fraction of ATP molecules that experienced gamma-PO3:H2O exchange in the same incubation, suggesting that the latter is due to multiple cycles of reversible ATP hydrolysis on the chloroplast coupling factor, i.e. [ATP-H2O in equilibrium ADP-Pi]."

Fluorescence titration with 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate revealed a strong and a weak binding site for BrAcT4 (K1 = 1 X 10(8) M-1; K2 = 1 X 10(6) M-1). The reaction of BrAcT4 with prealbumin to form a covalent bond was inhibited in the presence of T4 and binding of T4 to prealbumin was nearly abolished after affinity labeling with BrAcT4. Affinity labeling with 2 mol of BrAcT4/mol of prealbumin resulted in covalent binding of 1 mol of ligand. Acid hydrolysis of affinity-labeled prealbumin gave Nepsilon-carboxymethyllysine and iminodiacetic acid, the latter being derived from the NH2-terminal glycine. A combination of analytical procedures, including tryptic digestion after maleylation, cyanogen bromide cleavage, digestion with yeast protease C, and sequential Edman degradations, revealed that the Nepsilon-carboxymethyllysine was derived from lysine-9 and lysine-15 and that the affinity label had distributed itself among glycine-1, lysine-9, and lysine-15 in a ratio of 29:63:8."
https://openalex.org/W1510849526,"We have used a microsomal preparation from the pink portion of the rabbit harderian gland to study the properties of dihydroxyacetone-P acyltransferase. The enzymatic activity in the microsomes is latent and is stimulated approximately 20-fold by the addition of detergent to the assay system. Both deoxycholate and cholate stimulated the enzyme at concentrations considerably below the critical micellar concentration of these detergents. The acyltransferase was not solubilized by treatment with these detergent concentrations. In addition, we have shown that the acyltransferase is sensitive to proteolytic digestion in the presence of deoxycholate concentrations that render the microsomal vesicles permeable to the protease, but is insensitive to the protease treatment in the absence of detergent. Collectively, these data indicate that the active site of dihydroxyacetone-P acyltransferase is exposed to the lumenal surface of the microsomal vesicles. This enzyme is distinct from the glycerol-P acyltransferase in that the dihydroxyacetone-P acyltransferase is sensitive to protease digestion only in the presence of deoxycholate, is not inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents, and is not competitively inhibited by sn-glycerol-3-P."

These changes were similar to those of embryonic heart differentiation. RNAs from other sources isolated under identical conditions and synthetic polynucleotides were not effective. In the absence of inducer CEH-RNA, the embryonic cells remained undifferentiated.

https://openalex.org/W73922681,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction of phosphoglycerate kinase with the human erythrocyte ghost membrane. Ghosts prepared in 0.1 mM EDTA and 17 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5) have about 230 molecules of phosphoglycerate kinase/ghost. No additional binding is observed after incubating soluble enzyme with these leaky ghosts. This binding is tight but reversible with Kd = 7.1 X 10(-10) M. The enzyme can be eluted significantly from the membrane by incubation with 0.15 M NaCl and it rebinds to the membrane when the depleted ghosts are incubated with rabbit muscle phosphoglycerate kinase. Ligand binding studies show that NADH and NAD have opposite effects on the binding of the enzyme to the membrane; NAD (1.0 MM) favors binding while NADH (0.25 MM) does not. Similarly, ADP (0.2 mM) favors binding while ATP does not. ATP elutes the membrane-bound enzyme with Kd = 0.058 mM. MgSO4 also stimulates dissociation of the membrane-bound phosphoglycerate kinase (Kd = 0.36 mM), an effect which appears to be due to the magnesium ion. ADP (0.2 mM) can counteract the negative effect of MgSO4 (1.0 mM) on binding of phosphoglycerate kinase to the membrane. We have been unable so far to find tight coupling of the (Na+-K+)-ATPase with the membrane-bound phosphoglycerate kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1608491100,"The mitochondrial DNA of the protozoan Leishmania tarentolae, known as kinetoplast DNA, contains thousands of minicircles linked in a two-dimensional network. When kinetoplast DNA from exponentially growing cells is centrifuged to equilibrium in a CsCl/ethidium bromide gradient, it is resolved into two discrete components, Form I and Form II. Nearly all of the minicircles in Form I networks are covalently closed and all of those in Form II networks are open. These forms are indistinguishable from each other when examined by electron microscopy and they appear identical when analyzed by gel electrophoresis after digestion with the restriction enzymes Hae III or Hpa II. However, Form II networks sediment roughly 50% faster than Form I networks on a neutral sucrose gradient, indicating that Form II networks are larger in size or more compact in conformation, or both. Analysis of denatured Form II DNA by sedimentation or electron microscopy indicates that nearly all of its minicircles have one or more interruptions in both strands. Since the majority of the Form II minicircles can be closed by DNA ligase, most of these interruptions must be nicks. Experiments with S1 nuclease indicate that some small gaps may also exist in Form II minicircles. 5'-Terminal nucleotide analysis of Form II kinetoplast DNA does not suggest that the interruptions are at specific locations in the minicircles. The significance of the two forms of kinetoplast DNA has not yet been determined, but it is possible that Form II is an intermediate in replication of this DNA."

These are compared with those for accelerated formation of the methemerythrin ligand adduct in the same conditions in presence of NO2- (0.31 M-1 S-1), HCO2- (8.3 X 10(-3) M-1 S-1), F- (0.12 M-1 S-1), Cl- (1.4 X 10(-4) M-1 S-1), and imidazole (4 X 10(-3) M-1 S-1 at pH 8.0). No rapid pre-equilibria are observed in the case of the latter ligands. The effect of pH is examined."

https://openalex.org/W1524739378,"Involvement of Py pyrimidine dimers Py correnconucleases I and II in repair of ultraviolet radiation damage in vivo by Micrococcus luteus has been demonstrated by their absence in the ultraviolet-sensitive mutant DB-7 derived by treatment of the wild type parent with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. The necessity for their combined action in DNA repair in M. luteus is shown by: (a) reactivation of ultraviolet-damaged phiX174 RFI DNA in incision-defective hosts after in vivo treatment with both enzymes, (b) correlation between survival after ultraviolet irradiation and the level of the two enzymes, and (c) increased levels of repair synthesis after ultraviolet irradiation of toluenized cells DB-400 with wild type correndonuclease levels when compared with the transformant DB-200 and the mutant DB-7, which lack one or both enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1599287524,"Inbred strains of mice fall into two groups with respect to their liver histidase activity levels, high strains having approximately twice as much activity as low strains. Analysis of the F1, F2, and backcross progeny of the mating of a high activity strain (C57BL/6J) and a low activity strain (C3H/HeJ) indicates that the difference between the strains is determined by a single genetic locus with two alleles exhibiting additive inheritance. No differences with respect to various physical and kinetic parameters were found in studies of partially purified histidase from both strains. Quantitation of the amount of enzyme present by immunotitration showed that the amount of enzyme antigen is proportional to the level of enzyme activity in the two strains. Measurements of the relative rates of histidase synthesis by combined radiochemical and immunological techniques showed that the relative rate of synthesis was closely correlated with the amount of enzyme present. Rates of enzyme degradation in the two strains, measured by recovery of activity after irreversible inhibition with nitromethane, were the same."
https://openalex.org/W1515376150,"The exoribonuclease in bovine brain has been purified about 900-fold in 10% yield. The molecular weight is about 65,000. The enzyme is free from other ribonucleases of bovine brain. Studies of the mode of action of the enzyme show the following: (a) The enzyme cleaves both oligo- and polyribonucleotides exonucleolytically, initiating nucleolytic attack from the 5'-hydroxyl end to yield 3'-mononucleotides. The enzyme differs from spleen exonuclease in that it does not act on polydeoxyribonucleotides. (b) When the 5'-hydroxyl group is phosphorylated, the enzyme is inactive. (c) The enzymic action is processive in nature; the enzyme hydrolyzes one polynucleotide chain to completion before proceeding to the degradation of another chain."
https://openalex.org/W1554736341,"The effect of organic phosphates such as inositol hexaphosphate (IHP), ATP, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) on hemoglobin oxidation by hydroxylamine was studied under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, the oxidation rate of hemoglobin by hydroxylamine was accelerated as much as about 1.6 times, 1.4 times, and 1.4 times in the presence of IHP, ATP, and 2,3-DPG, respectively; however, under anaerobic conditions it was inhibited as much as 2.2 times, 2 times, and 2 times in the presence of these organic phosphates compared with the case for the absence of these organic phosphates. The effects of these organic phosphates on hemoglobin oxidation by hydroxylamine under aerobic conditions were elucidated by the two state models of hemoglobin including the R and the T state, however, the opposite effects under anaerobic conditions cannot be explained without the assumption of the existence of a third conformation of hemoglobin. The dissociation constant of IHP to deoxyhemoglobin was estimated from the rate of the hemoglobin oxidation by hydroxylamine in different concentrations of IHP under anaerobic conditions."
