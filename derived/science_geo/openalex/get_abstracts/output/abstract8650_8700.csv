https://openalex.org/W1563546627,"A highly sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay for three enkephalins (opiate-like pentapeptides) has been developed. The assay utilizes /sup 125/I-labeled enkephalins and antisera raised in rabbits, to synthetic enkephalins coupled with glutaraldehyde to bovine serum albumin. These antisera show <1% cross-reactivity between H/sub 2/N-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-OH ((Met/sup 5/)enkephalin) and H/sub 2/N-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-OH ((Leu/sup 5/)enkephalin) and even lower cross-reactvity to ..beta..-endorphin. Morphine shows no cross reactivity at all. The assay can detect as little as 10 fmol of enkephalin. Dose response curves for synthetic enkephalin and enkephalin-like immunoreactivity in acid extracts of brain are superimposable. Enkephalin-like immunoreactivity in tissue extracts is destroyed by treating extracts with leucine aminopeptidase or carboxypeptidase, enzymes which also destroy synthetic enkephalin. An opiate receptor binding assay based on the binding of /sup 125/I-labeled (DAla/sup 2/Leu/sup 5/)-enkephalin to N4TG1 neuroblastoma cells has also been developed. Gel filtration of acid extracts of brain or pituitary gland shows that both contain opiate-like material. However, whereas in brain most of opiate-like material co-chromatographs with enkephalin, in the pituitary no opiate-like material was observed to co-chromatograph with enkephalin but was of higher molecular weight. Enkephalin is widely distributed in the brain. High concentrations of both (Met/sup 5/)- and (Leu/sup 5/)enkephalins are found in the striatummore » (approximately 5 pmol/mg of protein), lower concentrations in the thalamus and midbrain, and very low concentrations in the cerebellum. The ratio of (Met/sup 5/)enkephalin to (Leu/sup 5/)enkephalin also differs in different brain areas. The ratio is very high in the hippocampus (15.2) and hypothalamus (13.6), but lower in other areas such as the cortex (1.4).« less"
https://openalex.org/W2098476077,"S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is known to be a potent inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-mediated reactions, of which SAH itself is a product. The immediate metabolic fate of SAH involves its hydrolysis to adenosine and L-homocysteine by the enzyme SAH hydrolase, but the reversibility of this reaction and its extremely low Keq in the hydrolytic direction suggest that under certain conditions of adenosine excess, SAH might accumulate with significant cytotoxic effects. We have used a model system consisting of cultured S49 mouse lymphoma cells together with the adenosine deaminase (ADA) inhibitor, erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (EHNA), to determine whether SAH is a mediator of adenosine cytotoxicity. Cells rendered resistant to adenosine-induced pyrimidine starvation by the addition of exogenous uridine or by the mutational loss of adenosine kinase are still sensitive to adenosine at concentrations >15 μM. We find that this effect is appreciably enhanced by the addition of L-homocysteine thiolactone to the culture medium. Cytotoxic concentrations of adenosine also cause significant elevations in intracellular levels of SAH, which are increased an additional several fold by 100μM exogenous L-homocysteine thiolactone. A fair correlation exists between a single time point determination of intracellular SAH and the degree of growth inhibition after 72 hr, but complicated time-dependent variations in SAH make it difficult to compare results obtained in the absence and presence of exogenous L-homocysteine thiolactone. In vivo DNA methylation in S49 cells is markedly inhibited by exposure of cells to concentrations of adenosine known to cause uridine-resistant cytotoxicity. This inhibition of methylation has been measured with short-term pulses of radiolabel, and correlates well with intracellular concentrations of SAH at all tested combinations of adenosine and L-homocysteine thiolactone. The results suggest that the uridine-resistant cytotoxic effects of adenosine on ADA-inhibited S49 cells are secondary to the inhibition of SAM-mediated methylation reactions by the adenosine metabolite SAH."

https://openalex.org/W1995567988,"Using a 3H-cDNA for RNA sequences specifically associated with murine intracisternal type A particles, we have found multiple copies of this information in high molecular weight nuclear DNA from tissues of both Mus muscules (BALB/c, NIH Swiss, A/Jax and feral) and Mus cervicolor. Reiteration frequencies varied from 1050-1800 per haploid genome, except that fewer copies (450) were found in BALB/3T3 cells. In the series studied, the reiteration frequencies in the DNA of A particle-rich tumor cells (myeloma and neuroblastoma) were not higher than those in normal tissues (liver and sperm). Multiple copies were retained when cellular DNAs were sedimented through alkaline sucrose gradients, indicating that the sequences are integrated in the mouse genome. In situ hybridization with cDNA showed that the sequences were associated with many chromosomes and were concentrated over certain regions of some chromosomes. Only low levels of homologous sequences were detected in rat, hamster and guinea pig DNA under stringent conditions of hybridization. The presence of reiterated sequence transcripts in poly(A) RNA from a neuroblastoma A particle fraction was confirmed by direct hybridization of the RNA with cellular DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1574530629,"Atypical and usual human serum cholinesterases were purified and studied with the fluorescent probe, N-methyl-(7-dimethylcarbamoxy)quinolinium iodide. Four active sites per tetramer were found in each enzyme. The turnover numbers of usual and atypical cholinesterases were the same: 15,000 mumol of benzoylcholine hydrolyzed/min/mumol of active site; 48,000 min-1 for o-nitrophenylbutyrate; and 0.0025 min-1 for N-methyl-(7-dimethylcarbamoxy)quinolinium iodide. They had identical rate constants for carbamylation, (5.0 min-1) and for decarbamylation (0.15 h-1). The major difference between the two genetically determined forms of the enzyme was substrate affinity, KD being 0.16 mM for usual and 5.4 mM for atypical cholinesterase, for the fluorescent probe substrate. Km for the uncharged ester, o-nitrophenylbutyrate, was 0.14 mM for both enzymes, whereas Km for benzoylcholine was 0.005 mM for usual and 0.024 mM for atypical cholinesterase. We interpret these data to mean that the two enzymes differ only in the structure of their anionic site."
https://openalex.org/W1509908464,"The administration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) to rachitic chicks produces an increase in (a) RNA and protein synthesis, (b) calcium binding protein (CaBP) concentration, and (c) alkaline phosphatase activity in the duodenum. These events occur concomitantly with enhanced calcium transport. We inhibited RNA and protein synthesis in richitic chicks and measured the subsequent response to 1,25(OH)2D3. Actinomycin D, injected prior to and following 1,25(OH)2D3 administration, inhibited intestinal RNA polymerase activity, blocked the rise in serum calcium, reduced the amount of CaBP, and increased alkaline phosphatase activity. Cycloheximide injected in similar fashion, inhibited the 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated increase in intestinal protein synthesis, serum calcium, CaBP, and alkaline phosphatase activity. Neither inhibitor blocked the ability of 1,25(OH)2D3 to stimulate calcium transport as measured in isolated duodenal loops in vivo. The ability of either inhibitor to block 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated calcium transport despite inhibition of CaBP production and alkaline phosphatase activity (by cycloheximide) indicates that de novo RNA and protein synthesis, and in particular CaBP and alkaline phosphatase, are not required for the 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulation of calcium transport."

Administration of zinc to pups nursing on lmlm dams reduces the observed mortality and morbidity. It is suggested that lm alters zinc transport from maternal blood to milk and that its study may provide useful information for understanding the rare human disease, acrodermatitis enteropathica."
https://openalex.org/W2055044562,"β-Glucuronidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of benzo[a]pyrene-3-glucuronide to 3-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene. During the enzymatic hydrolysis, a benzo[a]pyrene derivative is formed which binds to DNA to a far greater extent than either the 3-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene or its glucuronide. These results suggest that conjugates of benzo[a]pyrene may be converted by β-glucuronidase at intracellular and organ sites distal to the initial sites of oxygenation and conjugation of benzo[a]pyrene to activated intermediates that are possibly carcinogenic."
https://openalex.org/W1618667021,"Rat hepatocytes, isolated by a collagenase perfusion technique, specifically bind to polyacrylamide gel containing covalently immobilized 6-aminohexyl beta-D-galactopyranosyl groups. Less than 5% of these cells bind to polyacrylamide or to gels with the following covalently linked ligands: 6-aminohexanol, or the 6-aminohexyl D-pyranosides of alpha-mannose, beta-glucose, beta-2-acetamido-2-deoxyglucose, beta-cellobiose, beta-maltose, or beta-melibiose. Cell binding to beta-D-galactoside gels occurs after a lag period at 37 degrees and 65 to 100% (depending on the cell preparation) of the cells adhere. The duration of the lag period is inversely related to the beta-D-galactoside content of the gel but preincubation of the cells at 37 degrees reduces the lag period. Cell-gel binding is a threshold phenomenon. Adhesion of cells to gels does not occur when the glycoside concentration is less than about 900 nmol per cm2 x 0.25 mm thick gel piece. Above this critical concentration, cell-gel binding occurs and becomes maximal when the concentration is increased by only 20%. If these in vitro results apply to cellular interactions in vivo, they suggest that slight changes in the levels of cell surface or extracellular matrix carbohydrates may profoundly influence the behavior of neighboring cells."
https://openalex.org/W1579466639,"An N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, which converts blood group O red blood cells to A cells, was purified to homogeneity from plasma of blood group A1 subjects. The enzyme was adsorbed on Sepharose 4B, and after washing out the impurities, the enzyme was eluted with UDP. This procedure resulted in a 70,000- to 100,000-fold increase in specific activity with recovery of about 80%. Further purification of the enzyme was achieved by Bio-Gel P treatment. The final enzyme preparation showed a single protein band, which coincided with enzyme activity, on acrylamide gel electrophoresis, and revealed a single protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Judging from the molecular weight (90,000 to 100,000), which was estimated by Sephadex gel filtration, and the subunit size estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, the enzyme is presumably in a dimeric form. The enzyme required Mn2+ and had optimum activity at pH 6.5 to 7.0."

https://openalex.org/W2070200000,"Mice were trained in a passive (foot shock) avoidance task. When administered after training, the stimulants caffeine or nicotine blocked amnesia for the task that had been produced by injections of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin given prior to training. With foot shock at a higher intensity, anisomycin did not produce amnesia by itself, but the administration of the depressants chloral hydrate or sodium phenobarbital after training did cause amnesia. Stimulants and depressants did not have an appreciable influence on the overall degree of protein synthesis inhibition produced by anisomycin. The results support the hypothesis that arousal after training is an important factor in the conversion of short-term to long-term memory."
https://openalex.org/W1966439005,"Chromatin from Friend erythroleukemia cells has been fractionated according to the DNAase II/ Mg++ solubility method of Gottesfeld et al., 1974 Gottesfeld J.M. Garrard W.T. Bagi G. Wilson R.F. Bonner J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 71. 1974: 2193-2197 Google Scholar . Chromatin was separated into nuclease-sensitive and -resistant fractions after mild DNAase II digestion; the enzyme-solubilized material was further fractionated into Mg++-soluble and -insoluble fractions. The Mg++-soluble fraction of Friend cell chromatin represents 15–18% of total chromosomal DNA. The distribution of transcribed and nontranscribed DNA sequences in these chromatin fractions has been determined. When grown under standard conditions of cell culture, Friend cells contain only low levels of globin mRNA (about 130 copies per cell cytoplasm). Upon stimulation with 1.5% dimethylsulfoxide, these cells produce 10-fold higher amounts of cytoplasmic globin message. While no enrichment for globin nucleotide sequences is found in the Mg++-soluble fraction of nonstimulated cells, globin sequences are significantly more abundant in the Mg++-soluble fraction of dimethylsulfoxide-treated cells. DNA sequences complementary to poly(A)-containing cytoplasmic RNA are also preferentially localized in the Mg++-soluble fraction of Friend cell chromatin. Upon DMSO induction, transcription of 45S rRNA precursor is inhibited ( Sherton and Kabat, 1976 Sherton C.C. Kabat D. Dev. Biol. 1976; 48: 118-131 Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar ). We find that DNA sequences coding for rRNA are 4–5 fold more abundant in the Mg++-soluble fraction of uninduced cells than in the insoluble chromatin from these cells; no such difference, however, is found between the chromatin fractions obtained from DMSO-induced cells. Nontranscribed highly repetitive DNA sequences are concentrated in the inactive chromatin fraction. These data support the hypothesis that the Mg++-soluble fraction of isolated chromatin corresponds to the portion of the genome which is transcriptionally active in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2086479662,"The spinal fluid of sheep with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis contains myelin basic protein (6 to 18 nanograms per milliliter) bound to antibody as well as excess free antibody. This bound myelin basic protein appeared concurrently with the onset of the disease and remained elevated until death. In contrast, in active multiple sclerosis, the spinal fluid contains free myelin basic protein and there are no detectable levels of antibody. The results indicate that the antibodies enter the spinal fluid from the serum by passive diffusion. This mechanism may also explain the presence of viral antibodies in the spinal fluid of multiple sclerosis patients."
https://openalex.org/W1592850421,"BERNARDO NADAL-GINARD From the Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461 The number of lactate dehydrogenase molecules per cell equivalent in normal adult mouse tissues is: heart muscle 1.13 x 10s, skeletal muscle 3.6 x 1O8, liver 3.94 x lo’, and kidney 3.91 x 107. These steady state levels of lactate dehydrogenase reflect a balance between synthesis and degradation. To study the relative role of the two processes the half-lives of lactate dehydrogenase in these four mouse tissues were determined by means of a combination of the double isotope labeling technique and enzyme purification by oxamate . aminohexyl . Sepharose 4B affinity chromatog- raphy. This technique makes possible the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase turnover in single mouse organs and allows for the comparison of isotope decay between different tissues without being affected by differences in the size of the amino acid pools. All the lactate dehydrogenase isozymes in the same tissue were found to have the same half-life. The half-lives were: heart 8.2 days, skeletal muscle 43.0 days, liver 4.3 days, and kidney 6.1 days. The rates of lactate dehydrogenase synthe- sis in these tissues were calculated to be 110, 67, 74, and 52 molecules per cell per s, respectively. From these data and from the proportion of A and B subunits in each tissue, the rates of synthesis of each subunit were calculated. From the results it is concluded that the different steady state lactate dehydrogenase levels, a phenotypic expression of the lactate dehydrogenase genes, reflect mainly the differ- ing rates of degadation since the rates of synthesis are very similar; thus the regulation of the quantitative expres- sion of the lactate dehydrogenase genes in the mouse is largely post-translational."
https://openalex.org/W1541225060,"A galactosyltransferase, which converts blood group O red bloodcells to B-cells, was purfied to homogeneity from plasma of blood group B subjects. The stepwise purification procedures include: (a) column chromatography with CM-Sephadex, followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation; (b) Sephadex G-200 gel filtration; (c) column chromatogr,phy with DEAE-Sephadex; and (d) column chromatography with hydroxylapatite. The procedures provided about a 400,000-fold increase of specific activity with a 40 to 50% yield. Further purification of the enzyme was performed by small scale preparative acrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 4.3. The final enzyme preparation showed a single protein band which coincided with enzyme activity, in acrylamide gel electrophoresis, and revealed a single protein band in sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Judging from the molecular weight, which was estimated by Sephadex gel filtration, and subunit size estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, the enzyme is presumably in a dimeric form.

Activation by monovalent cations and ATP, and inhibition by Pi, PPi, GDP, GTP, and 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid were studied in more detail."
https://openalex.org/W2034755054,"Axons from eyes transplanted to the tail in Xenopus larvae enter the caudal spinal cord and follow two adjacent tracts rostrally to the level of the cerebellum. When eyes are transplanted to the ear area, optic axons enter the hindbrain and follow the same tracts rostrally and caudally. These sensory pathways normally contain the embryonic sensory system of the Rohon-Beard axons and the descending and ascending tracts of nerve V. We propose that the transplanted optic axons have followed a continuous substrate sensory pathway normally shared by a number of different sensory tracts."
https://openalex.org/W2084365670,"Abstract A new class of previously undetected small RNA molecules with a range of discrete sizes between 6S and 10S has been identified in HeLa cell nuclei. They differ in size and location from the previously described small nuclear RNA species (snRNA). These RNA molecules were initially found by selective RNA labeling in vitro in isolated nuclei. The in vitro products migrate in gel electrophoresis in the region from 6–10S with predominant components between 8S and 10S. They are labeled in the presence of very high concentrations of α-amanitin (150–400 μg/ml), suggesting they are synthesized by a type I polymerase. Unlike the major polymerase I product, ribosomal precursor RNA, however, these molecules are found in the nucleoplasm and their labeling is not affected by pretreatment of cells with low concentrations of actinomycin D (0.04 μg/ml). Their formation by a presumptive polymerase I type of enzyme is the basis of their tentative designation as small nuclear polymerase I (snPI) RNAs. The snPI RNA molecules appear to be associated with chromatin and the nuclear matrix. They can be selectively eluted from nuclei leaving most of hnRNA behind. This association is used as the basis of fractionation procedures which separate these molecules from hnRNA and permit the demonstration of the synthesis of at least the most predominant of these RNA molecules in vivo. w"
https://openalex.org/W1571932777,"Abstract Human antithrombin III was found to contain covalently linked N-acetylglucosamine, mannose, galactose, and sialic acid in a molar ratio of approximately 1:1:0.6:1. Sialic acid was released upon treatment with neuraminidase. The modified glycoprotein retained the capability to inhibit thrombin and to bind with heparin. Antithrombin III isolated by different procedures was also found to contain glucose in an approximately equimolar ratio with N-acetylglucosamine. Th glucose-containing component was extractable with lipid solvents and shown to be beta-glucosylceramide. This glycolipid is tightly complexed with antithrombin III and could not be separated by fractional precipitations or ion exchange gels. Although it remains to be established whether the inhibitory actions of antithrombin III are affected by glucosylceramide, the relative amounts which are bound suggest that antithrombin III may be a significant carrier of the glycolipid."
https://openalex.org/W1641605056,"Abstract The stereospecificity of microsomal 26 -hydroxylation in bile acid biosynthesis was studied. Cholesterol was biosynthesized from [2-14C] mevalonate by a rat liver preparation. The cholesterol was converted stepwise into 3alpha, 7alpha, 12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oic acid by microsomal and soluble fractions of rat liver homogenate. The 3alpha, 7alpha, 12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oic acid was decarboxylated chemically and the carbon dioxide was assayed for 14C. The amount of radioactivity in the liberated carbon dioxide was assayed for 14C. The amount of radioactivity in the liberated carbon dioxide was such as to indicate complete stereospecificity of the microsomal 26 -hydroxylase system. The system hydroxylates the methyl group in position C-26 (the 25-pro-R methyl group) and its stereospecificity is opposite that of the mitochondrial 26 -hydroxylase system which hydroxylates the methyl group in position C-27 (the 25-pro-S methyl group)."

https://openalex.org/W1593155586,"Adenylate cyclase activity measured in membranes of cultured normal rat kidney (NRK) fibroblasts was markedly increased by prior treatment of the intact cells with trypsin. Cell population density influenced the extent of activation observed. Trypsin treatment of sparse cells significantly enhanced adenylate cyclase activity, whereas similar treatment of confluent cells caused only a slight increase in adenylate cyclase activity. The degree of activation noted after trypsin treatment also varied depending on the adenylate cyclase function measured. Activity determined in the presence of GTP alone showed the greatest increase after trypsin treatment. Similar enhancement of adenylate cyclase activity of a washed cell membrane preparation was achieved by the addition of low concentrations of trypsin directly to the adenylate cyclase reaction mixture. The membranes of confluent NRK fibroblasts initially exhibited higher adenylate cyclase activity than did membranes of sparse cells. The present results suggest that this change in adenylate cyclase activity at cell confluence is not due to an increase in the amount of adenylate cyclase in the cell membrane but rather to a change in membrane components that regulate its activity. Proteolytic activation of adenylate cyclase appears to result from degradation of cell membrane proteins that modulate the activity of this enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1545818354,"Type I procollagen secreted by matrix-free chick embryo tendon cells was labeled with L-[3,3'-3H] cystine and purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. After bacterial collagenase digestion, the NH2- and COOH-terminal propeptides were partially characterized by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Similar experiments were then conducted after labeling with either D-[6-3H] glucosamine, D-[2-3H] mannose, or D-[U-14C] glucose. On the basis of these studies and subsequent carbohydrate analysis, it was concluded that the COOH-terminal peptide contained greater than 90% of the radioactive carbohydrate which consisted predominantly of glucosamine and mannose with traces of galactosamine and galactose. Only radioactive glucosamine could be detected in the NH2-terminal propeptide. Under conditions which inhibit hydroxylation of lysine and glycosylation of hydroxylysine, unhydroxylated procollagen (protocollagen) could still be labeled with [3H] glucosamine and [3H] mannose. This suggested that glycosylation of the propeptides is at least initiated at the level of the rough endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1557259256,"DNA polymerase and gene 4 protein of bacteriophage T7 catalyze extensive DNA synthesis on duplex phage T7 or PM2 DNA templates containing single strand breaks. A variety of physicochemical techniques have been used to characterize the DNA product synthesized in this reaction in the absence of ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates. Pyknographic and sedimentation analyses reveal that all of the newly synthesized DNA is covalently attached to the template DNA. Analysis by electron microscopy shows the major portion of the product molecules synthesized on duplex T7 DNA templates to consist of a double-stranded branch attached to an intact template molecule. Using PM2 DNA templates, the predominant product consists of a double-stranded branch attached to the circular PM2 DNA template. Analyses of these product molecules indicate that DNA synthesis by the gene 4 protein and T7 DNA polymerase is initiated at single strand breaks in the duplex DNA and that synthesis is accompanied by extensive displacement of one of the parental strands. At later times in the reaction, a portion of the 3'-hydroxyl terminus of the newly synthesized DNA is displaced from the template by branch migration and is used as a primer by the DNA polymerase to copy the displaced 5' single-stranded parental strand to form a duplex branch."

https://openalex.org/W1586894505,The nucleotide sequence of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) 5.8 S rRNA was determined to be (formula: see text). The major molecular species is 161 nucleotides long; the sequence differs in only eight nucleotides from that of Man. An estimate of the secondary structure retains essentially all of the features previously described in mammalian 5.8 S RNAs with several interesting variations. The very stable G-C-rich hairpin loop is extended by two additional hydrogen bond pairs; the A-U-rich loop is shorter; and a third 2'-O-methylation occurs at residue 8 close to the under methylated U(m) residue at position 14. Comparisons with other known sequences indicate that in eukaryotes 5.8 S rRNA is more highly conserved than 5 S RNA species.

The mutant enzyme shows no differences in its molecular weight, its Km for tRNAAsn, or its ability to aminoacylate tRNAAsn isoacceptor species compared to the wild type enzyme. These observations, as well as the growth properties of the mutant cells as a function of temperature and exogenous asparagine concentrations, are consistent with their decreased ability to aminoacylate tRNAAsn in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1668478609,Liver poly(A)-containing RNA isolated from rats in different dietary states was translated in a cell free protein synthesizing system employing reticulocyte lysates. Immunoprecipitation of the cell-free reaction products with goat anti-6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-gel electrophoresis showed that the induction of this lipogenic enzyme was accompanied by a corresponding increase in the concentration of its specific translatable mRNA.
https://openalex.org/W1487911814,"It is suggested from analysis of proton spin-spin coupling constants that the tetrahydropyrazine ring of tetrahydrofolate is a roughly equal mixture of two half-chair conformations, one with the C-6 proton axial and the other with the C-6 proton equatorial. The chemical shifts and spin-spin coupling constants for the carbon-bound protons of (+/-)-L-, (-)-L-, and (-)-L-[6-2H] 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate were measured at 25 degrees and at 300 MHZ. The resonances corresponding to the two C-7 protons in the deuterated compound constituted an AB quartet with JAB of 12 Hz and chemical shift difference of 92 Hz or 0.307 ppm; the C-7 protons are proposed to be a geminally coupled axial-equatorial pair whose rapid equilibration does not result in equivalence due to the adjacent chiral center at C-6. The spin-spin splitting in the C-7 resonances were 3.0 and 6.6 Hz for the low field and high field resonances, respectively, reflecting coupling to the C-6 proton. These coupling constants reflect the conformational equilibrium. The resonances assignable to C-9 protons are nearly equivalent in the 6-2H compound, but exhibit the resonances corresponding to a complex spin system in the 6-H compound."
https://openalex.org/W1494318646,"Double-stranded human globin DNA synthesized in vitro from sickle cell mRNA has been used as a substrate for a series of restriction endonucleases. The double-stranded DNA contained full length transcripts of the alpha- and beta- globin genes. Of the 10 enzymes tested, only 3 (Hpa I, Sal I, and Kpn I) failed to cleave either alpha- or beta-DNA; 2 (Eco RI and Bam HI) cleaved only beta-DNA; 3 (HindIII, Hpa II, and Hha I) cleaved only alpha-DNA; and 2 (Hae III and Alu I) cleaved both alpha- and beta-DNAs. The selective cleavage of human globin genes by restriction endonucleases should provide a strategy for the identification and purification of DNA fragments of genomic DNA containing globin genes plus their flanking sequences, simplify the preparation of pure, chain-specific globin probes, and permit the isolation of DNA probes for specific regions of the globin genes."
https://openalex.org/W2077027847,The combination of a defined medium with single-pass perfusion has made possible long-term maintenance of beating rat hearts at 22 degrees C in vitro. The 6- to 9-day survival period appears to be the longest so far reported for hearts. This method provides a stable system which should be useful for investigating the role of single factors in myocardial preservation and evaluating the effects of exposure to pharmacological and toxicological agents.
https://openalex.org/W1496986327,"The six 13Czeta resonances of the 6 tyrosine residues of ribonuclease A have been resolved by high field 13C Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spect=oscopy. Titration studies of these resonances reveal 1 nontitrating or buried tyrosine residue, 1 partially buried residue, and 4 normally titrating residues, which are tentatively identified."
https://openalex.org/W2011866965,"The costa is an intracellular organelle common to all trichomonads. Costae from Tritrichomonas foetus have been purified by a method which involves lysis of T. foetus with the heat-stable hemolysin produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by differential centrifugation. Analysis of the purified costae demonstrated that the organelle is composed of 95 percent carbohydrate and 5 percent protein. The carbohydrate moiety, probably a polysaccharide, consisted of glucose (95 percent), mannose (0.4 percent), glucosamine (1.4 percent), ribose (0.6 percent), and an unidentified sugar (2.6 percent). The kinetosomal complex was attached to the costa after initial lysis of cells but was separated from the costa during purification."
https://openalex.org/W1564314651,"The analysis of progress curves using the integrated rate equation was applied to the adenosine deaminase-catalyzed conversion of adenosine to inosine. Adenosine deaminase was purified from human red blood cells of phenotypes ADA 1, ADA 2, and ADA 2-1. For all three types, no measurable product inhibition by inosine was observed. These results do not confirm the hypothesis that inosine accumulation in purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency causes adenosine deaminase inhibition, resulting in a common mechanism for the immune defects related to these two enzyme deficiencies."
https://openalex.org/W1484184249,The kinetics of reaction of singly reduced methemoglobin (HbFe3(3+)Fe2+) with carbon monoxide have been investigated by the pulse radiolysis method. The rate constant for carbon monoxide binding to this form of hemoglobin is 4.1 X 10(6) M-1 S-1 at 24 degrees in our solutions. This value compares with existing values for various forms of hemoglobin ranging from 4 X 10(6) to 6.5 X 10(6) M-1 S-1. Addition of inositol hexaphosphate to the solutions results in a lower rate constant for carbon monoxide binding amounting to 1.1 X 10(5) M-1 S-1.
https://openalex.org/W1515164452,"Abstract The order of methylation of the 5'-terminus of globin mRNA of mice was studied by incubation of staged nucleated erythroid cells and peripheral reticulocytes with [methyl-3H] methionine. Methylation of the 5'-termini of alpha and beta- globin mRNAs in enucleated reticulocytes was demonstrated as follows: (a) [methyl-3H] incorporation into poly(A)+ RNA of reticulocytes co-migrated with the alpha- and beta- globin mRNAs on gel electrophoresis, and (b) following digestion of this RNA, radioactivity was localized to the four methyl sites at the 5'-capped structure of mouse globin mRNAs. However, this methylation is only 5 to 8% as efficient as in nucleated erythroid precursor cells, suggesting that most globin mRNA molecules are fully methylated prior to the reticulocyte stage. Incubations of early and late nucleated erythroid precursor cells and pulse-chase experiments with reticulocytes demonstrate that addition of the four 5'-terminal methyl groups follows an orderly sequence. In addition, the pulse-chase experiments suggest the turnover of the N7-methyl group on the 5'-terminal guanosine, but not of the other methyl groups in the 5'-terminus of globin mRNA. Thus, 5'-terminal methylation of globin mRNA is a nonrandom, dynamic process."
