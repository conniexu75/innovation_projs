https://openalex.org/W1491060698,"Cycloheximide and related glutarimide antibiotics have been shown to affect binding, transfer enzyme II-dependent movement, and release of transfer RNA from the donor site of reticulocyte ribosomes, as well as both the initiation and extension of globin and phenylalanine peptides. They inhibit binding of deacylated tRNAphe to reticulocyte ribosomes in the absence of transfer enzymes at concentrations similar to those that inhibit peptide initiation. These concentrations are below those required for comparable inhibition of peptide extension or transfer enzyme II-dependent translocation of peptidyl-tRNA from the acceptor to the donor ribosomal sites and appear to provide the basis for differential inhibition of peptide initiation and extension."
https://openalex.org/W1507222111,"Abstract In rat ventral prostate there are at least two soluble cytoplasmic proteins which specifically bind 3H-5α-dihydrotestosterone (3H-17β-hydroxy-5α-androstan-3-one). Only one of the 3H-5α-dihydrotestosterone-protein complexes (Complex II) can be retained by cell nuclei of the same tissue. The other 5α-dihydrotestosterone-binding protein (Complex I) can be separated from Complex II by an ammonium sulfate fractionation and a Sephadex gel filtration. Complex I preparations strongly inhibit the retention of Complex II by the prostate cell nuclei. The extent of the retention of prostate Complex II by cell nuclei of other rat tissues (liver, brain, thymus, and diaphragm), which are less sensitive to androgen, is relatively small. The cytosol fraction of liver contains very little of the protein which can form a complex (with 5α-dihydrotestosterone) retainable by cell nuclei of rat liver or ventral prostate. Cell nuclei of rat ventral prostate appear to contain specific nuclear acceptors which can selectively retain the 5α-dihydrotestosterone-receptor protein Complex II. The ability of cell nuclei to retain Complex II is rapidly lost when the nuclei are heated for 10 min at temperatures higher than 50°. Complex II is even less stable to heating. At 37° about one-half of the bound 5α-dihydrotestosterone is released from Complex II in 10 min. Complex II, by itself, is not retained firmly by prostate cell nuclei in the absence of 5α-dihydrotestosterone. This suggests that 5α-dihydrotestosterone binds to the receptor protein in such a way that the complex formed will have the structural requirement to fit the binding site of the prostate nuclear acceptor. Other steroids such as 5β-dihydrotestosterone, testosterone, 5α-androstane-3, 17-dione, 3α (or 3β),-17β-dihydroxy-5α-androstane, 4-androstene-3, 17-dione, 17β-estradiol, cortisol, and progesterone are not effective for this purpose. The steroid- and tissue-specificity of the cell-free systems strongly suggests that 5α-dihydrotestosterone plays a central role in the retention of an androgen receptor protein by prostate nuclei in vivo. The biological importance of the process is also underlined by the fact that cyproterone (6-chloro-17α-hydroxy-1,2α-methylene-4,6-pregnadiene-3,20-dione) 17α-acetate, a potent antiandrogen, also inhibits the retention process in the cell-free system."
https://openalex.org/W1524653065,"We have measured the rate of protein synthesis per unit of ribosomes in several tissues of intact animals in the fed and fasted state. The technique utilized measured the rate of incorporation of radioactive lysine into protein and was designed to produce relatively constant intracellular specific activities which were taken into account in calculating absolute rates of lysine incorporation. In animals fed ad libitum but growing at different rates, the rates of protein synthesis per unit of ribosomes in liver and muscle varied directly with growth rate and ranged in liver from 2.4 to 9.1 mµmoles of lysine incorporated per mg of RNA per min and in muscle from 1.1 to 3.9. Rates in brain and testis were variable, from 0.8 to 5.6 and 0.4 to 2.7, respectively, but did not correlate with growth rate. The rate in the Dunning ascites tumor was 1.0 to 1.5, which is consistent with the doubling time of these cells. During a 3½ day fast, rates fell to one-half to one-quarter of the fed value in liver and muscle, but were maintained in the tumor (until its terminal phase of growth in the animal), and appeared, on the basis of limited data, also to be maintained in brain and testis. These responses to fasting correlate well with the rapid loss of protein from liver and muscle during fasting and the maintenance of tissue protein in the latter three tissues. To identify the mechanisms that modulate the synthesis rate per unit of total ribosomes, we measured, in the liver, the proportion of ribosomes incorporated in polyribosomes (and hence active in synthesis) and also calculated the synthesizing activity of these ribosomes. The variations in synthesis among fed animals were due entirely to changes of polyribosome activity. These appeared to be due to alterations in soluble factors rather than in the ribosomes themselves. In fasted animals the decrease in protein synthesis in the liver was due to roughly equal decreases in ribosome content, polyribosome activity, and the proportion of ribosomes in polyribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1525295918,"Abstract The chromatographic behavior of β-galactosidase from the constitutive strain 3300 of Escherichia coli, K-12, was studied with derivatives of agarose and polyacrylamide which contained the substrate analogue inhibitor, p-aminophenyl-β-dthiogalactopyranoside, covalently attached in various ways. A two-step purification of this enzyme from extracts could be achieved with selective agarose adsorbents provided the ligand was placed at a sufficient distance (about 21 A) from the matrix backbone by interposing a long hydrocarbon arm, 3-aminosuccinyl-3'-aminodipropylamine. The various polyacrylamide-ligand derivatives studied were ineffective in adsorbing the enzyme. The enzyme adsorbed tightly at neutral pH to columns containing the substituted resin, and elution was achieved with buffers having a pH of 10. Buffers containing high concentration (0.05 m) of the substrates, lactose, isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, or o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, did not affect elution of the enzyme and were rapidly hydrolyzed by the enzyme adsorbed to the column. The enzyme obtained by these procedures was pure by disc gel electrophoresis and it possessed the physical and chemical characteristics of the protein purified by conventional procedures. The specific activity was between 300,000 and 320,000 units per mg. The procedure can be carried out on a preparative scale, and the adsorbent may be used several times without appreciable impairment of the binding capacity. The enzyme remains active while bound to the column and it can be readsorbed and eluted without apparent deleterious effects. The monomeric form of the enzyme also binds strongly to the substituted agarose, and it can be eluted together with the active tetramer species with sodium borate, pH 10. The ability of the enzymatically inactive monomer forms to bind to the ligand column suggests that this affinity chromatographic method may be used in the purification of catalytically inactive mutant forms which retain the ability to bind substrate analogues."
https://openalex.org/W1526477746,"Abstract The kinetics of induced synthesis of glycolytic enzymes of the hybrid yeast Saccharomyces fragilis x Saccharomyces dobzhanskii in response to the addition of glucose or galactose has been studied in a basal medium containing peptone, acetate, and yeast extract. Glucose and galactose bring about a 3- to 100-fold increase in specific activity of various glycolytic enzymes during a 7- hour period. The smallest increase is observed in the case of P-glucoisomerase (EC 5.3.1.9) and the largest with glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12). In the stationary state of cells grown in the presence or absence of glucose, the glycolytic enzymes display a coordinate relationship to one another. The time course of enzyme synthesis by glucose and galactose, as well as of enzyme disappearance on removal of the sugars, however, suggests a kinetic heterogeneity. With galactose as the inducing carbohydrate, the enzymes increase in specific activity in the following sequence: pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), within 20 min after addition of galactose; P-glucomutase (EC 2.7.5.1), P-fructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), and glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase, within 1 hour; P-glucoisomerase, P-glycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3), P-glycerate mutase (EC 2.7.5.3), and enolase (EC 4.2.1.11), between 1 and 3 hours; hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), aldolase (EC 4.1.2.7), triose-P isomerase (EC 5.3.1.1), and pyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.1), between 2 and 5 hours. Alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) falls outside any of these groups; after an initial period of repression, galactose causes increased synthesis of this enzyme during later periods. The increase of glycolytic enzyme activity elicited by sugars seems to be due to increased production of the same enzyme species already existing in uninduced cultures. The glucose-induced increase in glycolytic enzyme activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is completely prevented by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis in this yeast. P-Fructokinase and pyruvate decarboxylase decay rapidly inside the cells in the presence of this antibiotic."
https://openalex.org/W1588141897,"Abstract Sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1) has been purified 1000-fold from acetone powders of bovine liver. This enzyme was capable of transmitting electrons, abstracted from sulfite, to oxygen, to 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol, and to methylene blue as well as to cytochrome c and ferricyanide. The oxidase activity of this enzyme was shown to involve a 2-electron reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide without the formation of any detectable radical intermediates. The kinetic behavior of sulfite oxidase was completely accountable in terms of a simple ping-pong model. The Ks for sulfite was found to be 1.4 x 10-4 m and that for molecular oxygen was 5.8 x 10-4 m. The pH optimum was 8.6. The ratio of the activity of the enzyme toward oxygen and toward 1-electron acceptors was constant throughout the purification procedure. Furthermore, the oxidase activity and the cytochrome c reductase activities were equally susceptible to thermal inactivation; and sulfate protected both activities to the same degree against this inactivation. Anions were noncompetitive inhibitors of the reduction of 1-electron acceptors by sulfite oxidase but had no effect on the reduction of 2-electron acceptors. Divalent anions were more effective in this respect than were monovalent anions. Because ferricyanide was a more efficient acceptor of electrons from the enzyme than was oxygen; ferricyanide inhibited the reduction of oxygen by sulfite oxidase plus sulfite; and anions, by virtue of their selective inhibition of the reduction of 1-electron acceptors, were able to eliminate this action of ferricyanide."
https://openalex.org/W1533781040,"A retinol-transporting protein complex has been isolated in good yield from normal human serum. The protein complex consists of prealbumin and the actual vitamin carrier, the human retinol-binding protein (RBP). The interaction between prealbumin and RBP is dependent on the salt concentration. Dissociation occurred at low ionic strength, which enabled each of the two proteins to be isolated. The purified proteins appeared homogeneous by Ouchterlony immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, and ultracentrifugation. The molecular weights determined by equilibrium ultracentrifugation and from sedimentation diffusion data were for prealbumin-RBP 85,000, for prealbumin 64,000, and for RBP 21,000. The frictional ratios (f/f0) were low for all three components, indicating a close to spherical appearance also for the prealbumin-RBP complex. On polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the prealbumin was homogeneous, whereas the RBP separated into four molecular species. Amino acid analyses of the RBP indicated the presence of 181 residues, giving a calculated molecular weight of 20,600. Both prealbumin and RBP were devoid of carbohydrate. The only species of vitamin A bound to the RBP was the alcohol form (retinol). It is proposed that 1 mole of vitamin A is transported by 1 mole of RBP."
https://openalex.org/W1581143419,"Yeast cells were extracted with alkali and acetic acid according to the method of Bacon et al. (Biochem. J., 101, 36C (1966)). Examination of the extracted cell ghosts under the electron microscope revealed very thin cell envelopes with prominent bud scars in the shape of a shallow crater with a raised rim. The extracted cell ghosts, which had a high chitin content (15%), were treated with purified chitinase and glucanase. Electron micrographs showed that chitinase treatment did not destroy the integrity of the cell envelope, but largely eliminated the bud scar rims. On the other hand, after incubation with glucanase only fragments in the shape of bud scars, isolated or in groups, were observed. It is concluded that chitin is localized in a ring around the bud scar, sandwiched between two layers of glucan. The possible function of chitin during budding is discussed on the basis of this localization. During extraction of the yeast cells, a glucan fraction was isolated, which is soluble above pH 10, but rapidly forms a gel upon neutralization. This glucan was used to adsorb and purify the glucanase."
https://openalex.org/W1541162834,"Abstract The binding of liganded hemoglobin to haptoglobin, a plasma α2-glycoprotein, is an irreversible and stoichiometric reaction that occurs physiologically at the micromolar concentration level. The study of the reaction between deoxyhemoglobin which does not bind haptoglobin and a haptoglobin solution saturated with carbon monoxide indicates that hemoglobin tetramer is incapable of binding haptoglobin and its dissociation to dimers is a prerequisite for the reaction. The reaction between haptoglobin and the liganded dimers proceeds with a rate constant of about 5.5 x 105 m-1 sec-1 and the results can be fitted with a dissociation constant of 1.5 x 10-6 m for the hemoglobin tetramer. The study of the reaction of isolated α- and β-hemoglobin chains towards haptoglobin half-saturated by α chains or Hb A, has permitted a detailed analysis of this reaction. The haptoglobin, on the basis of the data presented here, probably contains four binding sites, two for each hemoglobin dimer (αβ). These two pair of sites are independent and noninteracting but within each pair a strong interaction is observed between the α-specific site and the allosterically induced β site. A detailed model of the reaction under physiological conditions is proposed on the basis of these results."
https://openalex.org/W1542642660,"A human retinol-transporting protein has been isolated from the urine of patients with tubular proteinuria. The protein separated into four fractions in the last two purification steps (sulfoethyl Sephadex chromatography and DEAE-Sephadex chromatography). The yield of purified retinol-binding protein (RBP) was 33 to 41% of the amount in concentrates of urinary proteins. A substance with an absorbance maximum at 330 nm was extracted from the protein with heptane and identified as retinol. Close to 1 mole of retinol per mole of protein was present in the fraction with the highest vitamin A content. The four isolated fractions of RBP gave reactions of identity on Ouchterlony immunodiffusion and a total of four zones on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Isoelectric focusing also revealed four components with isoelectric points in the pH range of 4.4 to 4.8. Ultracentrifugations indicated that the two main protein fractions were homogeneous with a molecular weight of 21,400. Amino acid analyses suggested that these two fractions differed by 1 residue of arginine. RBP was free from neutral sugar and hexosamine. Immunochemical determinations of RBP in normal biological fluids gave the following average values: serum, 46 mg per liter; urine, 0.11 mg per 24-hour volume; and cerebrospinal fluid, 0.35 mg per liter. Urine from patients with tubular proteinuria contained up to 150 mg of RBP per 24-hour volume."
https://openalex.org/W1605411651,Abstract Fe3+ was shown to be required for enzyme-catalyzed peroxidative chain-scission of polyunsaturated fatty acids of phospholipids in liver microsomal membranes. The Km value for iron in the reaction is different from that of nonenzymic processes which cause similar alterations of phospholipids. The products of both reactions include malondialdehyde which was shown to be the only substance formed which reacts with thiobarbituric acid to form a pigment absorbing at 532 mµ. The enzymic reaction proceeds first through the formation of peroxides on the β position polyunsaturated fatty acids followed by cleavage of the carbon chain to yield carbonyl compounds. Iron was shown to be required for formation of the phospholipid peroxides. The activity of the enzymic system in microsomes could be reduced to low levels by washing the particles several times in iron-free media. Activity could be restored by addition of Fe3+ to the assay system. The results suggest that TPNH-dependent oxidation processes may contribute to the normal catabolism of phospholipids in microsomal membranes.
https://openalex.org/W1496493167,"Abstract The role of the Golgi apparatus in the secretion of serum albumin has been investigated by measurements on albumin isolated immunologically from rough microsomes, smooth microsomes, and Golgi-rich fractions prepared from rat liver. Albumin constituted 6% of the total protein of the Golgi-rich fraction, which was the highest level found among intracellular components. After intravenous injection of 14C-leucine the maximum radioactivity of albumin occurred at about 5 min in rough microsomes, 15 min in smooth microsomes, and 20 min in the Golgi-rich fractions. The results indicate the pathway of albumin secretion to be: rough membranes-smooth membranes-Golgi bodies-blood. On the basis of relative specific radioactivities rough and smooth membrane fractions may contain some albumin not normally in the process of active synthesis and secretion, which could represent albumin in temporarily quiescent membrane channels or in pinocytotic vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1552108793,"The dissociation of the human vitamin A-transporting protein complex into free prealbumin and free retinol-binding protein (RBP) was studied by gel chromatography under varying conditions of pH and ionic strength. The interaction between the two proteins was diminished at a low ionic strength and complete dissociation seemed to occur at an ionic strength of 0.002. Variations in pH did not appear to alter seriously the affinity between prealbumin and RBP as the prealbumin-RBP complex was the predominant component in the pH range of 8 to 3. The release of vitamin A from free RBP and from prealbumin-RBP was studied at various values of pH and ionic strength. A facilitated release of retinol from RBP was found at conditions of low ionic strength, whereas variations in pH gave rise to only moderate changes in the release velocity of vitamin A. The binding of prealbumin to RBP seemed to strengthen the interaction between RBP and retinol. These observations suggested a conformational change of one or both of the two proteins at low ionic strength. Sedimentation velocity analyses performed at various values of ionic strength indicated that RBP was amenable to conformational changes at a low ionic strength. Variations in ionic strength did not seem to alter the sedimentation behavior of prealbumin. Immunochemical analyses showed that the prealbumin-RBP complex dissociated in the presence of antibodies directed against RBP, whereas antibodies directed against prealbumin did not seem to affect the interaction between prealbumin and RBP. These data suggest that RBP is more liable to conformational changes than is prealbumin."
https://openalex.org/W1538010644,"Abstract Sodium fluoride activates adenyl cyclase at a rate that is dependent on temperature and the concentration of NaF. The activation is not readily reversed by dilution, extensive washing of the membrane-bound enzyme, or dialysis. Activation occurs in the absence of added Mg++, but the rate of activation is increased 2-fold by 5 mm Mg++. The NaF-activated enzyme is more stable at 40° and during dialysis than the native enzyme. The enzyme also is activated by Triton X-100 and to a lesser extent by sodium dodecyl sulfate. The activity of the detergent-treated enzyme is not stimulated by NaF, but the activity of the NaF-activated enzyme can be increased by Triton X-100. Thus, NaF does not cause full expression of adenyl cyclase activity. Freezing and thawing of the cerebral cortex of young (1 to 20 days) rats prior to homogenization causes a 2-fold increase in enzyme activity. It was concluded that adenyl cyclase exists in its membranous environment in a state of inhibition. Treatment with detergents or freezing of the tissue could lead to nonspecific changes in membrane structure which cause reduction of the inhibition and increased catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1558936263,"Abstract The rate of RNA synthesis in a stringent strain of Escherichia coli was measured before and during amino acid deprivation. Upon amino acid deprivation the rate of RNA synthesis rapidly fell to 30% of the control rate and did not significantly change from that value upon prolonged starvation. The composition of RNA synthesized during amino acid deprivation was investigated by hybridization-competition, methyl labeling with 14C-methyl-labeled methionine, and polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis. Of the RNA pulse labeled during amino acid deprivation, ribosomal and transfer species comprise about 12% of the total, as opposed to about 40% in the unstarved control. Consequently, although some ribosomal and transfer RNAs are synthesized during amino acid starvation, the RNA is considerably enriched in messenger RNA, and the major effect of amino acid deprivation is the preferential curtailment of stable RNA synthesis. Our results also indicate that the rate of messenger RNA synthesis is reduced to 50% during amino acid deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W1558637401,"The freezing point-depressing glycoproteins, which are present in the blood of the Antarctic fish, Trematomus borchgrevinki, were sequenced. The first 6 residues of the native glycoprotein and the β-eliminated protein were identified by phenyl isothiocyanate degradation. The native glycoproteins were hydrolyzed into several small glycopeptides by the proteolytic enzymes subtilisin or elastase. The resulting hepta, hexa, penta, tetra, tri, and diglycopeptides were separated on Dowex 50 and were sequenced by phenyl isothiocyanate degradation. The sequences of these glycopeptides showed that the molecule contained the same repeating unit found in the first 6 residues of the unhydrolyzed protein. The repeating structural unit is a tripeptide of alanine-alanine-threonine in which the last residue is glycosidically linked to the disaccharide galactosyl-N-acetylgalactosamine."
https://openalex.org/W1565339037,"Abstract The ribosomal proteins of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been examined by gel electrophoresis. The large subunit has about 50 proteins, with molecular weights ranging from 10,000 to 46,000; the small subunit has about 30 proteins, with none larger than 30,000. Newly formed ribosomal protein appears on ribosomes during a period of about 20 min after its synthesis. At this time much of the ribosomal protein is within the nucleus, where it may be associated with maturing RNA in the form of partially assembled ribosomes. For a short time after a pulse of radioactive amino acid, one can observe on ribosomes a distinct set of proteins which are probably not involved in the assembly of new ribosomes. Newly formed ribosomes first appear in the cytoplasm as subunits. Although the new subunits are indistinguishable from the old ones on the basis of their buoyant density and the acrylamide gel analysis of their proteins, they pass rather slowly into the polysomes, which suggests that a final cytoplasmic maturation step is required. The process of ribosome synthesis in yeast is nearly indistinguishable from that in higher organisms. This finding validates the attempt to use a simple, genetically tractable organism, the yeast, to study the general problem of nucleocytoplasmic interactions in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1560444542,"Abstract Heparin with a molecular weight of 1.1 x 106 and sedimentation coefficient of 12.8 S has been isolated from Pronase-digested rat skin. The limiting viscosity number of this product is 16 times that of a commercial preparation from pig intestinal mucosa. The high molecular weight range of this polydisperse material was confirmed by gel filtration on columns of agarose gel. No depolymerization was observed on such columns in the presence of 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 8 m urea, or 4 m NaCl. Oxidative-reductive depolymerization with ascorbate gave two fractions on gel filtration media and two components on electrophoresis in agarose gel. Further study of these components led to the concept of a higher molecular weight polysaccharide core fraction to which chains of heparin in the same molecular weight range as commercial heparins were bound by ascorbate-sensitive linkages. Analyses for amino acids and xylose showed that the xylosylserine linkage-to-protein region was concentrated within the polysaccharide core fraction. A core preparation which represented only 8% of the weight of the undegraded macromolecule contained 42% of the total serine. These results show that macromolecular heparin from rat skin has a highly branched structure."
https://openalex.org/W1585951915,"Abstract A combination of narrow range isoelectric focusing, electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel, and gel exclusion on Sephadex reveals the presence of at least 9, possibly 11 isoenzymes of phospholipase A in Naja naja (cobra) venom. Their isoelectric points range from pH 4.60 to 5.66 and their molecular weights from 8,500 to 20,200. The most abundant form (isoelectric point = pH 4.95) has been isolated in apparently homogeneous state. All other forms have been prepared free from catalytically inactive impurities and partially or completely separated from each other. Vipera russellii venom has been shown to contain seven isoenzymes with isoelectric points ranging from pH 4.62 to 9.90 and molecular weights from below 15,000 to 23,800. The two components responsible for most of the catalytic activity of the venom on pure phosphatides (isoelectric points = pH 9.52 and 9.90) may be isolated from crude venom in a single isoelectric focusing step in approximately 90% homogeneous state. It has been shown that the isoenzymes of cobra venom do not arise by proteolysis or other preparative modification during isolation and they do not appear to have a subunit structure. A simple and rapid assay method involving a recording pH meter and aqueous media suitable for kinetic studies on the enzyme, is described."
https://openalex.org/W1585380255,"Abstract A requirement for the 105,000 x g supernatant of rat liver (S105) is demonstrated for five different reactions in cholesterol biosynthesis. This is best delinated using a buffer-washed acetone powder of liver microsomes. Incubation of S105 alone with each substrate yields chemically unchanged substrate. Evidence that S105 contains a protein responsible for this requirement includes the observations that it is nondialyzable, heat-labile, and destroyed by trypsin. Chromatography of S105 on Sephadex G-75 yields a protein peak which travels at the void volume and has associated with it both endogenous cholesterol and the ability to stimulate sterol synthesis as assayed in the conversion of Δ7-cholestenol to Δ5,7-cholestadienol. In addition, virtually all of the cholesterol present in the 105,000 x g supernatant of liver is bound to protein. These results plus other observations support the following hypothesis. S105 contains a noncatalytic carrier protein (STEROL CARRIER PROTEIN) which originates from the endoplasmic reticulum, binds the substrate, and makes the substrate reactive to the sterol-synthesizing enzymes present in the acetone powder of liver microsomes. The participation of Sterol Carrier Protein (SCP) may be of key importance in the understanding of the enzymatic synthesis of cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1544291828,"Abstract The catalytic and immunochemical properties of homomeric and heteromeric rabbit fructose diphosphate aldolase tetramers are described. Heteromers composed of either A and C (A3C, A2C2, AC3) or B and C (B3C, B2C2, BC3) subunits have maximal velocities and Michaelis constants indistinguishable from those of an equivalent mixture of homomers. These results indicate the subunits act independently and also imply the existence of four catalytically active sites in the aldolase molecule (one active site per subunit). Specific noncross-reaction antibodies prepared against the homomeric aldolases A4, B4, and C4 react with heteromers containing one or more subunits to which the antibodies had been directed. This interaction results in essentially complete inhibition of the catalytic activity of the heteromer. The amount of antibody required is inversely proportional to the number of antigenic subunits in the heteromer. These results suggest that (a) interaction with antibody may alter subunit interactions that are required for catalytic activity, and (b) antigenic sites may be modified in homomeric and heteromeric combination."
https://openalex.org/W1532024728,"Oxidation of purified heparin with periodate destroyed about 30% of the total uronic acid and almost all of the glucuronic acid residues, suggesting that glucuronic acid was essentially nonsulfated. Heparin was degraded with nitrous acid at low temperature, and the resulting products were separated by gel chromatography followed by paper electrophoresis. Four fractions were isolated and identified as nonsulfated uronic acid monosaccharide (B), monosulfated uronosylanhydromannose disaccharide (C), disulfated uronosylanhydromannose disaccharide (D), and sulfated uronic acid monosaccharide (E), respectively. Fractions B and C contained both glucuronic acid and iduronic acid, whereas iduronic acid constituted almost all of the uronic acid present in Fractions D and E. The results obtained do not support a recent claim that treatment of heparin with nitrous acid causes a conversion of glucuronic acid residues to iduronic acid via epimerization at C-5. It is concluded that iduronic acid is the major sulfated uronic acid of heparin."
https://openalex.org/W1512322481,"Abstract Cell fractionation experiments indicate that NAD glycohydrolase (EC 3.2.2.6) is a constituent enzyme of both the microsomal (endoplasmic reticulum) and plasmalemma membrane of the rat hepatocyte. The enzyme was solubilized by steapsin digestion from both fractions and subsequently purified ∼2000 over the homogenate and ∼500 over the microsomal fraction by successive DEAE-cellulose, Sephadex G-100 chromatography, and polyacylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme is a heterogeneous mixture of proteins with two or three major components. The apparent half-life of the purified NAD glycohydrolase was determined to be ∼18 days by the use of a double labeling procedure with uniformly labeled 14C-l-leucine and 3H-(4,5)-l-leucine. The results add another protein to the list of those (NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome b5) known to turn over asynchronously in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. No gross differences were found between the half-life of microsomal and plasmalemmal NAD glycohydrolase."
https://openalex.org/W1591185345,"Abstract A Golgi apparatus-rich fraction from rat liver was examined for the ability to mediate steps involved in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins. Five enzymatic activities were studied: the transfer of glucosamine, galactose, glucuronic acid, mannose, and N-acetylneuraminic acid from their sugar nucleotide precursors to endogenous trichloracetic acid-precipitable proteins. The glucosaminyl transfer was enriched 23-fold in the Golgi membrane fraction, and represented 17% of the total activity of the homogenate. The initial rate of transfer of glucosamine exhibits optima both at pH 6.1 and 7.1. UDP-glucuronic acid stimulates the net transfer of glucosamine at pH 7.1, but not at pH 6.1. GDP-mannose and GTP are also stimulatory at pH 7.1. UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UTP, UDP, and UMP are inhibitory. The Golgi-associated galactosyl transfer was enriched over 24-fold, and accounted for 13% of the original activity of the homogenate. This transfer activity is stimulated by GDP-mannose. UDP-glucose, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, and UMP inhibit the transfer of galactose. The Golgi membrane fraction also transfers glucuronic acid from UDP-glucuronic acid to trichloracetic acid-insoluble material. This transfer is stimulated by UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine. It represents 5% of the activity of the original homogenate, and is enriched approximately 8-fold in the Golgi fraction. The Golgi-associated transfer of N-acetylneuraminic acid represents 10% of the activity of the homogenate, and is enriched 18-fold. This transfer is stimulated by UDP-galactose, and is inhibited by CMP. Although the transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to trichloracetic acid-precipitable material is very active in the crude homogenate, little transfer, and rapid destruction of GDP-mannose is observed in the Golgi fraction. Mild alkaline treatment (0.5 n NaOH, 24°, 90 min) results in the release of 88 to 92% of the radioactivity of the 14C-glucuronic acid-labeled product to the trichloracetic acid-soluble fraction. On the other hand, only 32 to 35% of the 14C-glucosamine-labeled product is converted into a trichloracetic acid-soluble form by this treatment. When glucosamine transfer is stimulated by the addition of UDP-glucuronic acid, however, approximately 50% of the product is released by alkali. It is suggested that the alkali-stable products might represent glycoproteins, while the more alkali-labile products may be glycosaminoglycans. Bacterial heparinase degraded 70% of the glucuronic acid-labeled product, and 25% of the glucosamine-labeled product. Testicular hyaluronidase degraded 35% of the glucuronic acid-labeled, and 7% of the glucosamine-labeled material. Pronase digestion converted all of the radioactivity of glucosamine-, glucuronic acid-, or galactose-labeled trichloracetic acid-precipitable products into trichloracetic acid-soluble forms. These digestion products are still of relatively high molecular weight, as they are eluted in the void volume of a Sephadex G-50 column. Acid hydrolysis released all of the radioactivity of the glucosamine-labeled, pronase-digested product as free glucosamine, as identified by paper chromatography. The radioactive product of the galactosyl transferase reaction was shown to be 14C-galactose by the same method. The results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that the N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, and N-acetyl-neuraminic acid residues of the terminal sialic acid → galactose → N-acetylglucosamine sequence of many glycoproteins are added to the nascent glycoprotein within the Golgi apparatus, while the sugar residues of the inner core are inserted at other sites in the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1484690240,"Abstract Chromatography of bovine plasma albumin (BPA) on diethylaminoethyl cellulose resulted in a single asymmetric peak with considerable tailing. An identical result was obtained with half-cystinyl bovine plasma albumin (Cys-BPA), in which the single sulfhydryl group of BPA is in the form of a mixed disulfide with l-cysteine. This chromatographic behavior was related to the presence of albumins with different isoelectric points as revealed by isoelectric focusing of Cys-BPA on acrylamide gel containing 6 m urea. The two major components, about 76 and 20% of the sample, differed by 1 unit charge. This was shown by comparative isoelectric focusing studies of Cys-BPA and its mono-14C-acetylated derivative. The mono-14C-acetylated albumin and possibly the di- and triacetylated derivatives were prepared by the reaction of 14C-acetylsalicyclic acid with Cys-BPA. Investigation of chromatographic cuts, enriched with the different isoelectric components of Cys-BPA, indicated that these components were noninterconvertible on reversible denaturation or on treatment with thiol reagents, and that these components differed in their thermal and acid denaturation properties. The isoelectric heterogeneity of Cys-BPA is not a result of heterozygosity of the structural gene since studies of Cys-BPA isolated from six separate calves showed the same result. Also studies with albumins isolated from eight humans and four mice showed similar findings."
https://openalex.org/W1498417707,"Abstract Magnetic resonance studies of the activation of arginase (l-arginine amidinohydrolase, EC 3.5.3.1) with manganese have been performed with nuclear magnetic resonance. The results showed that 4 moles of manganese were bound per mole of fully activated arginase. However, the binding affinities of the metal ions to the enzyme were not identical; 50% of the Mn2+ was strongly bound and could not be removed without considerable irreversible loss of activity and solubility of the enzyme. Various treatments such as dialysis, electrophoresis, or chelating of the Mn2+ by an excess of complexing agents resulted in enzyme preparations that retained about 50% of their original activity; full activity could be recovered in these samples by the addition of Mn2+. The amount of tightly bound manganese estimated by quantitative electron spin resonance measurements after denaturation of the enzyme with 1.5 n HCl showed that the dialyzed enzyme, with a residual catalytic activity of 50%, contained 2 moles of manganese per mole of arginase, suggesting that the enzyme existed then in the form of an E-Mn2 complex. Measurements of the effect of the manganese in the E-Mn2 complex on the longitudinal nuclear relaxation rate of water protons at pH 7.5 and 34° yielded an enhancement of 8.0 and a binding constant (K1) whose lower limit is 3 x 107 m-1. The activation step of arginase from E-Mn2 ⇌ E-Mn4, which results in a restoration of 100% of the catalytic activity, was studied kinetically at increasing manganese concentrations and at various temperatures and pH. By titration of the enzyme with manganese and vice versa, the formation of the E-Mn4 complex was followed by measurements of the proton relaxation rate, which yielded an enhancement of 6 to 8 at pH 7.5 and 34°. The binding constant for the reversibly removable Mn2+ was calculated to be K2 = 2 ± 1 x 104 m-1. The addition of arginine (substrate) or or nithine (competitive inhibitor) did not further increase the enhancement; rather, it slightly lowered it, which proves that primarily a binary complex between arginase and manganese is formed."

https://openalex.org/W1529478272,"Circular dichroism (CD) of various kinds of hemoglobins and the protoporphyrin-globin complex has been measured over the range of 200 to 660 nm. All mammalian hemoglobins so far tested show CD spectra identical with those of human hemoglobin. Although the absorption spectra of lamprey hemoglobin and toad embryonic hemoglobin are similar to those of human hemoglobin, these hemoglobins show various CD spectra different from human hemoglobin in the Soret and visible regions. CD spectra of human γ chains are almost identical with those of β chains, however both are different from those of α chains. These various CD spectra may be attributed to the different structures of heme environments of these hemoglobins. A protoporphyrin-globin complex exhibits distinctive CD bands both in the Soret and visible regions, indicating that contacts other than the iron-histidine bond make the tetrapyrrole ring optically active. The prominent positive ellipticity of deoxygenated human hemoglobin at 430 nm was decreased by either carboxypeptidase digestion or dialysis against deionized water. These treatments led to a loss of heme-heme interaction and to an increase in the oxygen affinity, without changing the gross structure of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1594805342,"Intermediate steps in the aromatization of 4-androstene-3,17-dione to estrone, catalyzed by human placental microsomes, have been evaluated through the use of normal and hypothetical intermediate compounds as substrates and the oxidases involved have been characterized by the effects of oxygen and carbon monoxide upon these conversions. When air was replaced by a 5% oxygen-95% nitrogen atmosphere, the rate of aromatization of 4-androstene-3,17-dione or of 19-hydroxy-4-androstene-3,17-dione was reduced 30 to 35% while no inhibition occurred if 3,17-dioxo-4-androsten-19-al was the substrate. The aromatization of all three of these steroids in 5% oxygen was not inhibited when carbon monoxide was added at a concentration 8.8 times that of oxygen. However, this same CO:O2 ratio of 8.8 decreased the aromatization of 4-estrene-3,17-dione 51 to 95% and the aromatization of 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione 10 to 16%. Hydroxylation of the A ring of 4-estrene-3,17-dione was also inhibited by carbon monoxide to the same extent as was its aromatization. These findings have been interpreted as evidence for the existence of three mixed function oxidases active in steroid aromatization, one of which may be a form of cytochrome P-450."
https://openalex.org/W1582348127,"An endonuclease activity present in extracts from Escherichia coli B infected with T7+ phage has been purified 2500-fold. This enzyme, T7 endonuclease I, is the product of gene 3, and its activity is maximal 7.5 min after infection at 37°. The activity is at least 100 times greater with single stranded DNA as substrate than with duplex DNA. The limit product obtained by digestion of single stranded DNA with the endonuclease is about 50% acid soluble and consists of oligonucleotides with a chain length of about 10. The enzyme produces single strand and double strand breaks in duplex DNA, and the limit product obtained when double stranded DNA is digested with the endonuclease consists of fragments of duplex DNA whose strands are about 125 nucleotides long. T7 endonuclease I produces breaks with 5'-phosphate and 3'-hydroxyl termini. Although all four deoxynucleoside monophosphates are found at the 5'-terminus, the enzyme makes fragments with predominantly pyrimidine-containing nucleotides at their 5'-termini. The enzyme acts equally well on E. coli DNA and T4, T7, and λ phage DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1648274396,"Stable ferro-forms of hemoglobins containing various hemes such as dimethyl proto-, dimethyl meso-, etio-, meso-, hemato-, and deuteroheme were prepared by combination of human globin with hemes, followed by reduction with dithionite and purification with carboxymethyl Sephadex column. Sedimentation coefficients of these hemoglobins were all near to 4.0 S and chemical analysis showed that 4 moles of heme were bound per mole of hemoglobin. Esterification of propionyl carboxyl groups of heme did not change the absorption spectra of hemoglobin; absorption spectra of dimethyl protohemoglobin were essentially identical with those of protohemoglobin, and absorption spectra of dimethyl mesohemoglobin with those of mesohemoglobin. Absorption spectra of etiohemoglobin, in which the propionic acid groups of mesoheme were substituted by ethyl groups, were similar to those of mesohemoglobin. Parameters of oxygen equilibrium, namely oxygen affinity, n in Hill's equation, and Bohr effect, of hemoglobin containing hemes which lack free carboxyl groups were the same as those for the corresponding hemoglobin with free propionic acid groups. Oxygen affinities of meso-, deutero-, hemato-, and protohemoglobin, in which heme side chains at positions 2 and 4 are ethyl, hydrogen, hydroxyethyl, and vinyl groups, respectively, were in the ratio of 5:2:1.3:1, corresponding to the reverse order of the negative inductive effects of the groups at positions 2 and 4. These results suggest the effect of π electron of a porphyrin ring on the oxygen binding."
https://openalex.org/W1535710757,"Rat liver acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase was purified about 200-fold and the inhibition of this enzyme by certain hypolipidemic drugs was studied. The inhibition was more pronounced if the drugs were added before rather than after the citrate activation of the enzyme. Kinetic analysis revealed noncompetitive inhibition of the drugs with respect to the substrates acetyl-CoA, ATP, and HCO3-, and competitive inhibition with respect to the activator, citrate. Sucrose density gradient centrifugations showed that the drugs reverse the aggregating effect of citrate to form the active polymeric forms of the enzyme from the inactive monomers. Arrhenius plots and heat-inactivation studies suggest gross conformational changes of the enzyme protein in the presence of the drugs. Relative affinities of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase for citrate and the drugs are expressed by the calculated dissociation constant for citrate and the inhibition constants of the drugs. Derangement of fatty acid synthesis in vivo is conceivable by competition of the drugs with the activation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase at low and physiologically possible concentrations of the drugs and citrate."
https://openalex.org/W1558467261,"Giant grouper serum was shown to contain 16 S (∼3 mg per ml of serum) and 6.4 S (∼6 mg per ml of serum) immunoglobulins. The 16 S immunoglobulin had a molecular weight of ∼700,000, a relatively high hexose content, and was composed of approximately equimolar amounts of H and L polypeptide chains. It is suggested that this molecule resembles immunoglobulin M on the basis of polypeptide chain properties but that it is most likely a tetramer instead of the typical 19 S pentamer of immunoglobulin M. The 6.4 S immunoglobulin appeared structurally to represent a fragment of the 16 S molecule; the major difference being that the 6.4 S H chain was missing ∼30,000 daltons. In attempting to fit the class Osteichthyes into a scheme of vertebrate immunoglobulin evolution, it was suggested that the primitive form of polymeric immunoglobulin M may be a tetramer of subunits held together by both disulfide and noncovalent bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1553128399,"The enzymatic mechanism of asparaginase action has been explored using the acyl acceptor, hydroxylamine. Asparaginase catalyzed the synthesis of the hydroxamate from asparagine and more slowly from aspartic acid. β-Aspartohydroxamate was also a substrate for asparaginase. These reactions have rates which are linearly dependent on the concentration of the enzyme and can therefore be used as convenient colorimetric assays. The activity which catalyzed these reactions migrated precisely with asparaginase II during isoelectric focusing with an isoelectric point of 4.9. The reactions with hydroxylamine suggest a mechanism which involves a β-aspartyl enzyme intermediate. Further support for this mechanism has been obtained from exchange studies which showed that asparaginase catalyzed the incorporation of oxygen from 18O-labeled water into aspartic acid. Useful kinetic analysis of the hydrolysis of asparagine cannot be carried out because the concentration of water cannot be varied as a kinetic parameter. The hydroxylaminolysis reactions, however, allowed demonstration of a ping-pong mechanism consistent with a reaction pathway involving an acyl enzyme intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1495537266,"Abstract Several isoenzymes of phospholipase A from Naja naja venom have been studied in regard to specificity of action on pure phosphatides (natural and synthetic) and on membrane-bound phospholipids and compared with phospholipases A from other species. Test systems for membrane-bound substrates included the solubilization of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase from inner membranes of heart mitochondria, choline dehydrogenase from liver mitochondria, α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase from brain mitochondria, and the formation of endogenous inhibitors of NADH oxidase in inner membrane. Although it is clear that all of these activities are due to the action of phospholipase A itself, the kinetics of action on membrane systems are complex, so that the activity on membranes is not a simple function of phospholipase concentration. Marked differences have been noted among phospholipases A from different venoms in regard to specificity toward membrane-bound phospholipids, the effect of added Ca+2 ions and of inorganic phosphate. Significant differences in specificity have also been noted among isoenzymes from the same venom (N. naja and Russell's viper). The effect of inhibitors selective for thiol, disulfide, histidine, and serine groups on the isoenzymes from these sources has also been examined."
https://openalex.org/W1600654702,"Abstract The sulfurtransferase system which forms 4-thiouridylate in tRNA has been separated into two activities from Escherichia coli B. The system is stable and is freed of most of the other thionucleotide-forming activities. The first enzyme has absolute requirements for ATP, a divalent metal ion (optimally Mg2+), tRNA, and a sulfhydryl compound. The second enzyme requires cysteine as the sulfur donor and the product of the first reaction. β-Mercaptopyruvate is inactive either as a cofactor or as a sulfur donor when the enzymes are prepared using the dextran partition method. Both E. coli B and yeast tRNA can serve as sulfur acceptors, but no other polyribo- or polydeoxyribonucleotide sulfur acceptors have been found."
https://openalex.org/W1556250577,"Abstract An unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph of Escherichia coli designated civ-2 fao-6, unable to carry out β oxidation of fatty acids has been isolated and characterized. The mutant is devoid of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, and has low levels of enoyl-CoA hydrase and β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase while the activities of acyl-CoA synthetase and thiolase are normal. Long chain unsaturated fatty acids with chain length up to C20 can meet the auxotrophic requirements of the mutant without further chain shortening. Fatty acid analyses of the phospholipids of cells grown on different unsaturated fatty acids confirm that a regulatory mechanism is operative in E. coli that minimizes variations in the physical properties of phospholipids. When Δ11-eicosenoic acid was supplied, the phospholipids contained a low level of unsaturated acid but a high proportion of C14:0 was detected. Synthesis in vivo of fatty acids indicated that fatty acid synthetase is responsive to requirements for membrane lipid synthesis. This relationship is lost in the assay in vitro in which a high proportion of C18:0 is synthesized. Besides trans-octadecenoic acids, cis-Δ6-octadecenoic acid was found to cause cell death at low temperature. At 27°, death of elaidate-grown cells is associated with loss of crypticity to o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside hydrolysis, and is prevented by oleate which is incorporated into all major phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1584900555,"The effects of insulin on glycolysis in the rat hemidiaphragm were studied. When diaphragms were preloaded with [14C]-glucose and then incubated in a glucose-free medium, insulin caused an increase in [14C]-CO2 production. Paired hemidiaphragms were incubated in a glucose medium, with and without insulin, the glucose concentrations so adjusted that glucose uptake was slightly higher in the absence of insulin; insulin increased incorporation of [14C] from glucose into CO2 and triglyceride glycerol. We concluded that insulin stimulates glycolysis independently of its effect on glucose transport. Phosphorylated glycolytic intermediates were measured after incubation; the concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate were reduced, while those of fructose diphosphate, 2-phosphoglycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate, and phosphoenolypyruvate were increased. It is concluded that insulin stimulates the phosphofructokinase reaction. During incubation with lactate, insulin produced a small increase in [1-14C]-lactate oxidation but had no effect on [2-14C]-lactate oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1516705961,"The solvent perturbation behavior and acetylation characteristics of the tyrosine residues in the subtilisins have been examined. The availability of the phenolic side chains both to acetylation and solvent is high, in agreement with the proposed x-ray structure for subtilisin BPN'. Spectroscopic studies on N,O-diacetyltyrosine, N-acetyl-tyrosine, and 3-nitrotyrosine in water-dioxane mixtures show that the spectra of these compounds are very sensitive to solvent composition. Consequently, when determination of the degree of acetylation, or nitration, is performed spectrophotometrically on native proteins, significant errors may occur due to differences in the microenvironments of individual tyrosine side chains. Relevant data from the literature are discussed which indicate that phenolic groups in apolar locations undergo substitution preferentially, and that reactivity with N-acetylimidazole or tetranitromethane is an uncertain (and, in some cases, misleading) index of exposure of a phenolic side chain to the solvent. Circular dichroism studies on subtilisins Novo and Carlsberg indicate some differences in the arrangement of the aromatic residues in these two enzymes, and, possibly, small differences in the conformation of the polypeptide backbones as well."
https://openalex.org/W1596650834,"Abstract Rat diaphragm was incubated with [14C]-glucose or [14C]-pyruvate; a number of the phosphorylated glycolytic intermediates were then isolated and their specific activities determined. Following incubation with either substrate, the specific activities of fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, and phosphoenolpyruvate were very close to that of the substrate. The specific activities of glucose 6-phosphate and phosphoglyceric acids were much lower than those of the substrates and of their immediate precursors; their relative specific activities were different for the two substrates. It is concluded that there are multiple intracellular pools of glucose 6-phosphate and phosphoglyceric acids and that the pools involved in glycolysis are distinct from those involved in gluconeogenesis. Insulin had no effect on the pattern of specific activities."

The anionic trypsinogen is present in large amounts and accounts for about half of the total potential tryptic activity. The kinetics of the conversion of the anionic trypsinogen to active enzyme is autocatalytic, yielding an anionic trypsin which is less anionic than the zymogen. Km values and specific activities of anionic trypsin toward esters and anilides of arginine and lysine were found to be very similar to those of cationic trypsin.

https://openalex.org/W1892183534,"Abstract An enzyme was purified 500-fold from Neurospora which catalyzes the formation of homocysteine from O-acetylhomoserine and sulfide or methionine from O-acetylhomoserine and methylmercaptan. The two activities were not separated by purification. The rate with methylmercaptan is 1.8 times that with sulfide. No cystathionine is formed from cysteine, and there is essentially no α-ketobutyrate formed from O-acetylhomoserine or cystathionine. The enzyme is highly specific for O-acetylhomoserine, having negligible activity with homoserine, serine, and several of their other acyl derivatives. The apparent Michaelis constants are 7 x 10-3 m for O-acetylhomoserine in both reactions, 7 x 10-4 m for sulfide, and 8 x 10-4 m for methylmercaptan. A requirement for pyridoxal phosphate can be shown after dialyzing the enzyme with cysteine. Moderate inhibition was observed with methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, and S-adenosylhomocysteine, but not with cystathionine. No repression by methionine was observed. No mutants were found which are defective in this activity. Previous evidence led to the conclusion that these reactions are not the primary mechanisms in vivo for homocysteine and methionine synthesis. A possible temporary function for this enzyme may be formation of methionine from methylmercaptan at times of exhaustion of an exogenous source of sulfur."
https://openalex.org/W1528428428,"The soluble fraction of a spheroplast lysate from Saccharomyces carlsbergensis or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, contains a heat-stable, nondialyzable inhibitor of the particulate chitin synthetase. The chitin synthetase inhibitor (CSI) can also be extracted by heating intact cells in buffer. CSI was highly purified by conventional methods of protein fractionation, as indicated by disc gel electrophoresis. The inhibitory power is destroyed by incubation with trypsin, thus confirming that CSI is a protein. CSI is a potent effector, since half-maximal inhibition is attained with less than 1 µg per ml, yet the activity of chitin synthetase is never totally abolished. Kinetically, the inhibition is of the noncompetitive type. Storage of chitin synthetase results in a decreased sensitivity to CSI, and treatment of the enzyme with trypsin eliminates the effect of CSI altogether, while the enzymatic activity is doubled. The desensitized enzyme is still sedimentable and its Km for UDP-acetylglucosamine is essentially unchanged. The content of CSI in yeast increased 3- to 4-fold during growth from the middle logarithmic to the stationary phase. The activity of chitin synthetase also increased. It is postulated that CSI has a regulatory role connected with the budding process since chitin is found in the cell wall at the site where the bud had formed and detached."
https://openalex.org/W1507415332,"Abstract Pyruvate-phosphate dikinase formation was induced on transfer of glucose-grown cells of Acetobacter xylinum to succinate- or pyruvate-containing media. Enzyme formation did not occur if such media were supplemented with glucose or in the presence of chloramphenicol. Fructose and glycerol were less effective in repressing enzyme formation. When glucose was added to cultures of cells growing on succinate, the growth of the organism was unimpaired, but was accompanied by virtual cessation of dikinase synthesis. The changes in the dikinase activity of the cells were accompanied by parallel changes in the ability of cells to convert pyruvate into cellulose. It is concluded that the physiological function of pyruvate-phosphate dikinase in A. xylinum is gluconeogenic, and that gluconeogenesis in this organism is subject to control exerted over the synthesis of the dikinase."
https://openalex.org/W1524903943,"Abstract The electron acceptor 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCI) forms a spectrophotometrically and kinetically detectable complex with bovine milk xanthine oxidase. The visible absorption spectrum of complexed DCI exhibits an absorption maximum at 660 nm at pH 7.8 (e = 34.2 x 103 m-1 cm-1), a marked bathochromic shift from the visible absorption maximum at 608 nm characteristic of the free dye (e = 21.0 x 103 m-1 cm-1. The bound dye can be partially removed from the enzyme by prolonged dialysis (24 hours), and totally removed by gel filtration, indicating a reversible rather than a covalent interaction. From the DCI concentration dependence of the spectral change, the stoichiometry of the interaction is 2.08 DCI-binding sites per molecule of xanthine oxidase (assuming a molar extinction coefficient for the enzyme of 66 x 103 m-1 cm-1 at 450 nm); and the dissociation constant of the DCI-enzyme complex is 1.3 x 10-6 m. The spectral shift characteristic of DCI-xanthine oxidase interaction is blocked by 2 mm arsenite, by 2 mm p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, by the competitive inhibitor 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxy-s-triazine, 1.5 mm, and by the stoichiometric xanthine oxidase inhibitor, 4,6-dihydroxypyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (4,6-diHPP), at levels equimolar with those of the enzyme. With the latter inhibitor, the DCI spectral shift, although not present initially, develops concomitantly with reoxidation of the reduced enzyme molybdenum of the 4,6-diHPP-xanthine oxidase complex. In contrast to the results seen with the other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, the DCI-xanthine oxidase interaction is not blocked by 16 mm sodium cyanide. In kinetic studies, DCI, in addition to acting as an electron acceptor, is also a noncompetitive inhibitor of the enzyme, with a Ki of 2.8 x 10-6 m. Prior incubation with DCI protects the enzyme from inhibition by arsenite, but not from inhibition by cyanide. On the basis of the spectrophotometric and kinetic data, it is proposed that the DCI-binding site is the molybdenum or molybdenum-sulfur component of the internal electron transport chain of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1529378017,"Abstract Denaturation of dilute solutions of ferrimyoglobins at pH 6.50 and 50° by a 7- to 10-fold molar excess for copper(II) is completely reversible on addition of excess chelating agent. The renaturation reaction exhibits first order kinetics. In the ultracentrifuge, the copper(II)-denatured proteins show little aggregation except for an increase in sedimentation constant for the sperm whale protein from 1.9 to 2.8 to 2.9. Copper(II) denaturation of sperm whale protein does not result in liberation of the heme group from the protein. Bound copper(II) ion inhibits alkylation of ferrimyoglobin histidyl residues by iodoacetamide. First order rate constants for renaturation of porpoise, harbor seal, and alkylated sperm whale ferrimyoglobins have different pH-independent values under mildly acidic and mildly basic conditions; the transition between the two can be accounted for by the ionization of a single group with a value of pKa near 6.5. Renaturation of native sperm whale protein is nearly pH independent over the accessible range. In all cases, the entropy of activation for the renaturation process is near zero. The rate constants for ferrimyoglobin renaturation show little sensitivity to variations in ionic strength but are increased about 2-fold in the presence of 0.01 m benzene."
https://openalex.org/W1550465988,"Abstract The validity of the reducing end group (copper reduction) method for determination of chain weight of chondroitin sulfate is shown by comparison with chain weight determination from linkage region components, xylose and galactose. It is established that chains of both chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate are stable to alkali as strong as 2.0 n NaOH at room temperature for at least 120 hours. The existence of two populations of protein linkage regions in both chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate from both the and fractions of proteoglycan from human nucleus pulposus is shown. These linkage regions are classified as alkali-labile, which is split by 0.2 n NaOH at room temperature, and alkali-stable, which is stable to 0.2 n NaOH at room temperature but which is readily split by 2.0 n NaOH at room temperature. Sixty-two per cent of the linkage regions of both chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate in the light fraction of proteoglycan were alkali-labile, while 78% of linkage regions of both mucopolysaccharides in the heavy fraction were alkali-labile. It is pointed out that the individual chain weights of the alkali-labile and the alkali-stable fractions cannot be determined from reducing end group determinations alone. The relative molecular sizes and amounts of chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate bound by alkali-labile and alkalistable linkages in both light and heavy fractions of proteoglycan are investigated by gel filtration. Removal of mucopolysaccharide from protein by 2.0 n NaOH allows the separation by gel filtration of the protein of proteoglycan into two peaks differing in amino acid composition and molecular size. It is observed for the chondroitin sulfate studied that reducing end group determination after 0.2 n NaOH treatment should give fairly reliable values for the chain weight of the alkali-labile fraction."
