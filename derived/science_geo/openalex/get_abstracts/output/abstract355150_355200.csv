https://openalex.org/W2130313087,"BACE is an enzyme necessary for the generation of neurotoxic amyloid-β in Alzheimer's disease. Claes Wahlestedt and his colleagues identify a noncoding RNA that is upregulated in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disase. This noncoding RNA increases expression of BACE, driving amyloid-β generation and possibly disease progression. Recent efforts have revealed that numerous protein-coding messenger RNAs have natural antisense transcript partners, most of which seem to be noncoding RNAs. Here we identify a conserved noncoding antisense transcript for β-secretase-1 (BACE1), a crucial enzyme in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. The BACE1-antisense transcript (BACE1-AS) regulates BACE1 mRNA and subsequently BACE1 protein expression in vitro and in vivo. Upon exposure to various cell stressors including amyloid-β 1–42 (Aβ 1–42), expression of BACE1-AS becomes elevated, increasing BACE1 mRNA stability and generating additional Aβ 1–42 through a post-transcriptional feed-forward mechanism. BACE1-AS concentrations were elevated in subjects with Alzheimer's disease and in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. These data show that BACE1 mRNA expression is under the control of a regulatory noncoding RNA that may drive Alzheimer's disease–associated pathophysiology. In summary, we report that a long noncoding RNA is directly implicated in the increased abundance of Aβ 1–42 in Alzheimer's disease."

We generated an HIV-resistant genotype de novo using engineered zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) to disrupt endogenous CCR5. Transient expression of CCR5 ZFNs permanently and specifically disrupted ∼50% of CCR5 alleles in a pool of primary human CD4+ T cells. Genetic disruption of CCR5 provided robust, stable and heritable protection against HIV-1 infection in vitro and in vivo in a NOG model of HIV infection. HIV-1-infected mice engrafted with ZFN-modified CD4+ T cells had lower viral loads and higher CD4+ T-cell counts than mice engrafted with wild-type CD4+ T cells, consistent with the potential to reconstitute immune function in individuals with HIV/AIDS by maintenance of an HIV-resistant CD4+ T-cell population. Thus adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded CCR5 ZFN–modified autologous CD4+ T cells in HIV patients is an attractive approach for the treatment of HIV-1 infection."

https://openalex.org/W1976203623,"The cancer stem cell hypothesis proposes that cancers arise in stem/progenitor cells through disregulation of self-renewal pathways generating tumors, which are driven by a component of 'tumor-initiating cells' retaining stem cell properties. The HER2 gene is amplified in 20-30% of human breast cancers and has been implicated in mammary tumorigenesis as well as in mediating aggressive tumor growth and metastasis. We demonstrate that HER2 overexpression drives mammary carcinogenesis, tumor growth and invasion through its effects on normal and malignant mammary stem cells. HER2 overexpression in normal mammary epithelial cells (NMEC) increases the proportion of stem/progenitor cells as demonstrated by in vitro mammosphere assays and the expression of stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) as well as by generation of hyperplastic lesions in humanized fat pads of NOD (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain)/SCID (severe combined immunodeficient) mice. Overexpression of HER2 in a series of breast carcinoma cell lines increases the ALDH-expressing 'cancer stem cell' population which displays increased expression of stem cell regulatory genes, increased invasion in vitro and increased tumorigenesis in NOD/SCID mice. The effects of HER2 overexpression on breast cancer stem cells are blocked by trastuzumab in sensitive, but not resistant, cell lines, an effect mediated by the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway. These studies provide support for the cancer stem cell hypothesis by suggesting that the effects of HER2 amplification on carcinogenesis, tumorigenesis and invasion may be due to its effects on normal and malignant mammary stem/progenitor cells. Furthermore, the clinical efficacy of trastuzumab may relate to its ability to target the cancer stem cell population in HER2-amplified tumors."

https://openalex.org/W1969896384,"Atg18 is essential for both autophagy and the regulation of vacuolar morphology. The latter process is mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate binding, which is dispensable for autophagy. Atg18 also binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) in vitro. Here, we investigate the relationship between PtdIns(3)P-binding of Atg18 and autophagy. Using an Atg18 variant, Atg18(FTTG), which is unable to bind phosphoinositides, we found that PtdIns(3)P binding of Atg18 is essential for full activity in both selective and nonselective autophagy. Atg18(FTTG) formed a complex with Atg2 in a normal manner, and Atg18-Atg2 complex formation occurred in cells in the absence of PtdIns(3)P, indicating that Atg18-Atg2 complex formation is independent of PtdIns(3)P-binding of Atg18. Atg18 localized to endosomes, the vacuolar membrane, and autophagic membranes, whereas Atg18(FTTG) did not localize to these structures. The localization of Atg2 to autophagic membranes was also lost in Atg18(FTTG) cells. These data indicate that PtdIns(3)P-binding of Atg18 is involved in directing the Atg18-Atg2 complex to autophagic membranes. Connection of a 2xFYVE domain, a specific PtdIns(3)P-binding domain, to the C terminus of Atg18(FTTG) restored the localization of Atg18-Atg2 to autophagic membranes and full autophagic activity, indicating that PtdIns(3)P-binding by Atg18 is dispensable for the function of the Atg18-Atg2 complex but is required for its localization. This also suggests that PtdIns(3)P does not act allosterically on Atg18. Taken together, Atg18 forms a complex with Atg2 irrespective of PtdIns(3)P binding, associates tightly to autophagic membranes by interacting with PtdIns(3)P, and plays an essential role."
https://openalex.org/W2081040269,"People with the metabolic syndrome often develop gallstones. Why these two disorders are linked has not been not clear, but now Kahn and his colleagues have shown that lack of insulin signaling in the liver leads to dysregulation of genes that control the transport and synthesis of bile acids, thus altering the proper profile of bile salts and resulting in the formation of gallstones. Despite the well-documented association between gallstones and the metabolic syndrome1,2, the mechanistic links between these two disorders remain unknown. Here we show that mice solely with hepatic insulin resistance, created by liver-specific disruption of the insulin receptor (LIRKO mice)3 are markedly predisposed toward cholesterol gallstone formation due to at least two distinct mechanisms. Disinhibition of the forkhead transcription factor FoxO1, increases expression of the biliary cholesterol transporters Abcg5 and Abcg8, resulting in an increase in biliary cholesterol secretion. Hepatic insulin resistance also decreases expression of the bile acid synthetic enzymes, particularly Cyp7b1, and produces partial resistance to the farnesoid X receptor, leading to a lithogenic bile salt profile. As a result, after twelve weeks on a lithogenic diet, all of the LIRKO mice develop gallstones. Thus, hepatic insulin resistance provides a crucial link between the metabolic syndrome and increased cholesterol gallstone susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2045871368,"Adult neurogenesis is a lifelong feature of brain plasticity; however, the potency of adult neural stem/progenitor cells in vivo remains unclear. We found that retrovirus-mediated overexpression of a single gene, the bHLH transcription factor Ascl1, redirected the fate of the proliferating adult hippocampal stem/progenitor (AHP) progeny and lead to the exclusive generation of cells of the oligodendrocytic lineage at the expense of newborn neurons, demonstrating that AHPs in the adult mouse brain are not irrevocably specified in vivo. These data indicate that AHPs have substantial plasticity, which might have important implications for the potential use of endogenous AHPs in neurological disease."
https://openalex.org/W2079455590,"People can moderate their aversive emotional reactions. Delgado and colleagues now show that people can also downregulate expectations of reward, which can at times be maladaptive (for example, drug cravings), and that this results in an attenuation of the physiological and neural correlates of reward expectation. Previous emotion regulation research has been successful in altering aversive emotional reactions. It is unclear, however, whether such strategies can also efficiently regulate expectations of reward arising from conditioned stimuli, which can at times be maladaptive (for example, drug cravings). Using a monetary reward-conditioning procedure with cognitive strategies, we observed attenuation in both the physiological (skin conductance) and neural correlates (striatum) of reward expectation as participants engaged in emotion regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1988919269,"The brachyolmias constitute a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal dysplasias characterized by a short trunk, scoliosis and mild short stature. Here, we identify a locus for an autosomal dominant form of brachyolmia on chromosome 12q24.1-12q24.2. Among the genes in the genetic interval, we selected TRPV4, which encodes a calcium permeable cation channel of the transient receptor potential (TRP) vanilloid family, as a candidate gene because of its cartilage-selective gene expression pattern. In two families with the phenotype, we identified point mutations in TRPV4 that encoded R616Q and V620I substitutions, respectively. Patch clamp studies of transfected HEK cells showed that both mutations resulted in a dramatic gain of function characterized by increased constitutive activity and elevated channel activation by either mechano-stimulation or agonist stimulation by arachidonic acid or the TRPV4-specific agonist 4alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4alphaPDD). This study thus defines a previously unknown mechanism, activation of a calcium-permeable TRP ion channel, in skeletal dysplasia pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2130392240,"Targeting angiogenesis, the formation of blood vessels, is an important modality for cancer therapy. TNP-470, a fumagillin analog, is among the most potent and broad-spectrum angiogenesis inhibitors. However, a major clinical limitation is its poor oral availability and short half-life, necessitating frequent, continuous parenteral administration. We have addressed these issues and report an oral formulation of TNP-470, named Lodamin. TNP-470 was conjugated to monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol-polylactic acid to form nanopolymeric micelles. This conjugate can be absorbed by the intestine and selectively accumulates in tumors. Lodamin significantly inhibits tumor growth, without causing neurological impairment in tumor-bearing mice. Using the oral route of administration, it first reaches the liver, making it especially efficient in preventing the development of liver metastasis in mice. We show that Lodamin is an oral nontoxic antiangiogenic drug that can be chronically administered for cancer therapy or metastasis prevention."

https://openalex.org/W1970595490,"Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) underlies cancer cell immortalization, and the expression of hTERT is regulated strictly at the gene transcription. Here, we report that transcription factor Ets2 is required for hTERT gene expression and breast cancer cell proliferation. Silencing Ets2 induces a decrease of hTERT gene expression and increase in human breast cancer cell death. Reconstitution with recombinant hTERT rescues the apoptosis induced by Ets2 depression. In vitro and in vivo analyses show that Ets2 binds to the EtsA and EtsB DNA motifs on the hTERT gene promoter. Mutation of either Ets2 binding site reduces the hTERT promoter transcriptional activity. Moreover, Ets2 forms a complex with c-Myc as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays. Immunological depletion of Ets2, or mutation of the EtsA DNA motif, disables c-Myc binding to the E-box, whereas removal of c-Myc or mutation of the E-box also compromises Ets2 binding to EtsA. Thus, hTERT gene expression is maintained by a mechanism involving Ets2 interactions with the c-Myc transcription factor and the hTERT gene promoter, a protein-DNA complex critical for hTERT gene expression and breast cancer cell proliferation.

The Ets protein family consists of a large number of evolutionarily conserved gene transcription factors. Each Ets member has an 85-amino acid sequence called the Ets domain that adopts the winged helix-turn-helix DNA binding structure with high affinity for the core consensus sequence of GGAA/T in a variety of genes. Although many Ets proteins are transcription factors, some function as repressors, and others are shown to be both activators and repressors (1Seth A. Watson D.K. Eur. J.

This is particularly critical in cancer cells where telomeres are critically short in supporting constant cell proliferation. Previous studies show that c-myc is a primary transcription factor of the hTERT gene. Binding the E-box on the hTERT gene promoter, c-myc, stimulates hTERT gene promoter activity (16Dwyer J. Li H. Xu D. Liu J.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2007; 1114: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Li H. Xu D. Li J. Berndt M.C. Liu J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25588-25600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Myc regulates gene expression by binding cognate DNA sequences known as E-box (CACGTG). Although other transcriptional factors such as Ets1, Ets2, and Sp1 are also implicated as playing a role in regulating the hTERT gene, little is known of and how these transcription factors cooperate.To establish the role of Ets1 and Ets2 in regulating telomerase activity, we chose to silence each of the Ets1 and Ets2 genes in breast cancer cells in which Ets2 is expressed at high levels (6Galang C.K. Muller W.J. Foos G. Oshima R.G. Hauser C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11281-11292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), to observe their effects on hTERT gene expression and breast cancer cell proliferation. We found that knockdown of Ets1 has no effect on telomerase activity, but knockdown of Ets2 significantly disrupts hTERT gene expression and causes breast cancer cell death. Reconstitution with recombinant hTERT rescues the Ets2 knockdown-induced cell death. Mechanistic studies showed that Ets2 binds to the hTERT gene at two discrete Ets-binding sites of the gene promoter. Mutation of either site reduces the hTERT gene promoter activity. In addition, silencing Ets2 entrains a decreased gene expression of c-Myc, but reconstituted c-Myc in the Ets2 knockdown cells does not restore hTERT activity. Furthermore, Ets2 forms a complex with c-Myc regulating c-Myc binding to the E-box. Thus, the hTERT gene is stimulated with a cooperative interaction between Ets2 and c-Myc in their respective bindings to their individual binding sites on the hTERT gene promoter, which is critically required for telomerase activity and hTERT-dependent proliferation of human breast cancer cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—The human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cell culture media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were seeded in 24-well plastic plates, 6–10-cm dishes or eight-chamber glass slides (Nunc, Naperville, CT).RNA Interference (RNAi) Constructs, Synthetic siRNAs, and Gene Silencing—For generation of Ets1- and Ets2-specific RNAi, specifically annealed oligonucleotides were cloned individually to the BamHI and BbsI sites immediately downstream of the initiating “G” of the U6 promoter. The annealed oligonucleotides used are listed below: Ets2a (5′-tttgtcttgtggatgatgttcttgaagcttgaagaacatcatccacaagactttttt-3′ and 5′-gatcaaaaaagtcttgtggatgatgttcttcaagcttcaagaacatcatccacaaga-3′), Ets2b (5′-tttgcacaggctttaattgtaaagaagcttgtttacaattaaagcctgtgctttttt-3′ and 5′-gatcaaaaaagcacaggctttaattgtaaacaagcttcaagcttgtttacaattaaagcctgtgc-3′), and Ets1 (5′-tttggcagaattcagtgaatcatcggaagcttgcgatgattcactgaattctgctttttt-3′ and 5′-gatcaaaaaagcagaattcagtgaatcatcgcaagcttccgatgattcactgaattctgc-3′). Correctly integrated clones were identified by HindIII digestion and verified by sequencing. The DNA fragment containing the U6 promoter and Ets2-specific hairpin was prepared by amplification with T7 and SP6 and gel purification. 500 ng of U6-Ets2RNAi DNA was co-transfected with 50 ng of a PGK-puromycin into MCF-7 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche). After 24 h 25 μg/ml puromycin was added to the cultures and after 7 days of selection, cells were pooled and expanded for analysis. For transient gene silencing, synthetic small interference RNA (siRNA) targeting Ets1 and Ets2 were used. The siRNAs were purchased from Ambion.Gene Expressions of Ets2, c-Myc, and hTERT—Wild type hTERT gene expression plasmid was prepared by subcloning hTERT full-length cDNA into the pcDNA3HA plasmid as described previously (21Cao Y. Li H. Deb S. Liu J.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3130-3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The c-Myc gene expression plasmid was generated by inserting full-length c-Myc cDNA downstream of the EF-1α promoter. The gene expression plasmids were transfected into Ets2 knockdown clones (clone 2–15) using FuGENE 6, e.g. 20 μg of pEFBOS-c-Myc (or pEFBOS 1 FLAG) and a puromycin resistance clone. Individual clones were isolated and screened by PCR. Other Ets2 knockdown cell clones (clones 17–34) were also transfected in mass cell cultures. The transfection of hTERT was confirmed by telomerase activity assay and c-Myc expression was confirmed by Western blotting. The cell line and multiple clones displayed various levels of c-Myc protein; however, there was no difference between their growths (data not shown).Real-time RT-PCR Analysis—Single-stranded cDNA was generated using 1 μg of total RNA as template and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega), as per the manufacturer's instructions. A ⅕ dilution of the resulting cDNA was used for real-time RT-PCR of 45 cycles, using a Light Cycler (Roche, version 3.5 software). Fast start SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche) was used, with 10 pmol of each primer in 10-μl reactions. Primers specific for different genes are: hTERT (5′-CCACCTTGACAAAGTACAG-3′ and 5′-CGTCCAGACTCCGCTTCAT-3′) and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-GAGAGACCCTCACTGCTG-3′ and 5′-GTAGGTATATGACAAGGTG-3′). Following gel electrophoresis on 2% agarose-TAE gel, the size and purity of each PCR product were analyzed. Each DNA sequence was subjected to BLAST analysis to confirm that the PCR represented the correct gene. All samples were subjected to PCR with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a control. To create a standard curve, five 10-fold dilutions of plasmid DNA were used as template (10–5–10–9 ng/μl). Results represent an average of three independent experiments.Gene Transfection and Luciferase Gene Reporter Assay—The Ets consensus sites (EtsA and -B) were mutated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) in the hTERT luciferase reporter (pTERT-luc330, gift from Silvia Bacchetti and Yu-sheng Cong). The mutagenesis primers used for EtsA were 5′-CCC AGG ACC GCG CTT CTC ACG TGG CGG AGG G-3′ and 5′-CCC TCC GCC ACG TGA GAA GCG CGG TCC TGG G-3, and for EtsB were 5′-CAG CCC CTC CCC TTC TTT TCC GCG GCC CCG-3′ and 5′-CGG GGC CGC GGA AAA GAA GGG GAG GGG CTG-3′ (underlined were putative Ets binding sites and italic were the mutations). All the expression plasmids, wild type and mutants, were verified by DNA sequencing before use. All plasmids used in the transfection assay were prepared with the endotoxin-free plasmid Maxi-kit (Qiagen) and resuspended with endotoxin-free 0.1× Tris/EDTA buffer to a concentration of 1 μg/μl. MCF-7 cells (2 × 105) were placed in 1 ml of medium in 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated overnight. Next day, the wild type or mutant hTERT promoter reporter gene vector (1 μg) along with 0.2 μgof α-galactosidase expression vector were transfected into MCF-7 cells with FuGENE 6 (Roche). In 24 h of transfection, the cells were harvested, washed in PBS, and lysed in cell lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured with luciferase substrate purchased from Promega according to the procedures of the Luciferase Assay System (Promega), and readout in opaque 96-well plates using a plate reading luminometer. β-Galactosidase was used to normalize transfection efficiency. Experiments were performed in triplicate.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—MCF-7 cell nuclear extract was incubated with 10,000 cpm of a 22-bp DNA oligonucleotide containing the EtsA and -B consensus sequence (wild type EtsA, 5′-GACCGCGCTTCCCACGTGGC-3′, mutant EtsA, 5′-GACCGCGCTTCTCACGTGGC-3′; wild type EtsB, 5′-CCCTCCCCTTCCTTTCCGCG-3′, and mutant EtsB, 5′-CCCTCCCCTTCTTTTCCGCG-3′). Probes were labeled with [γ-32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences). Incubations were performed at room temperature for 30 min in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, and 100 μg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin. For competition studies, unlabeled wild-type or mutant Ets oligonucleotides were added to the binding reaction 30 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. Specific Ets1 or Ets2 antibody (0.5 μl) was incubated with nuclear extracts for 20 min on ice before the binding reaction. All incubation mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis on native 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, which were subsequently dried and subjected to autoradiography.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were performed using the ChIP Assay Kit (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, MCF-7 cells (1 × 107) were fixed with formaldehyde (final concentration, 1%) for 10 min at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were pelleted and resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were sonicated to generate the DNA fragments, diluted with dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl), and pre-cleared by incubation with a salmon sperm DNA, protein A,agarose 50% slurry for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with anti-Ets1, anti-Ets2, anti-acetylhistone H3 antibodies or IgG at 4 °C overnight. Immunocomplexes were collected with a salmon sperm DNA, protein A, agarose, 50% slurry, heated at 65 °C to reverse cross-linkage, and treated with 40 μg/ml proteinase K at 45 °C for 60 min. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform/ethanol precipitation and used as a template for PCR to amplify the proximal region containing the Ets site of the hTERT promoter or the distal region void of the Ets site as control. The primer pairs for the proximal region were 5′-GGC CGG GCT CCC AGT GGA TTC-3′ and 5′-CAG CGG GGA GCG CGC GGC ATC G-3′, and the primer pairs for the distal region were 5′-GGCAGGCACGAGTGATTTTA-3′ and 5′-CTGAGGCACGAGAATTGCTT-3. Primer pairs for PTHrP control were 5′-TGCCTCGAGCGTGTGAACA-3′ and 5-TCCCATAGCAATGTCTAATTAATCTGG-3. The PCR conditions were 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C for 35 cycles. The PCR products were resolved on a 7% polyacrylamide gel and stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).GST Fusion Proteins—GST, GST-Ets1, and GST-Ets2 fusion proteins were produced in BL21 Escherichia coli under induction by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature. Proteins were purified by affinity absorption using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The recombinant GST, GST-Ets1, and GST-Ets2 proteins on the glutathione beads were incubated with nuclear protein extracts or total cell lysates of breast cancer MCF-7 cells at 4 °C for 1 h followed by extensive washing. Proteins on the beads were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting with anti-myc antibody and anti-GST antibodies.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting Analysis—For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed with triple detergent lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). Cell lysates (∼1 mg) were incubated with antibodies as indicated in individual experiments. Antibody complexes were captured using protein A-agarose beads (GE Healthcare) and washed three times with PBS. The beads carrying the immune complex were boiled in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. For total nuclear protein extraction, 1 × 106 cells were collected in cold PBS and resuspended in RIPA buffer (150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked at 4 °C overnight in 10% (w/v) nonfat milk (0.2% fetal calf serum, 0.05% Tween 20 in 1× PBS) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:1000, DAKO Australia). SuperSignal West PICO (Calbiochem) chemiluminescent substrate kit was used to detect and visualize protein antigens after exposure to BioMax autoradiographic film (Kodak). Alternatively x-ray film or Odyssey was used for autoradiography. The autoradiograph films were scanned and the bands quantified on a PhosphorImager (Fujifilm FLA-2000, Berthold).Immunofluorescence—MCF-7 cells (1 × 105) were seeded in Chamber slides (Lab-Tek II, Nalge Nunc International) containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells at 60–80% confluence were washed with PBS, starved by addition of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h, followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and blocking with CAS blocking solution (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were incubated with the Ets2 polyclonal (Santa Cruz) or hTERT primary antibody at room temperature for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, 0.01% Triton X-100 for 5 min each, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). For staining of the nuclei, cells were stained with 50 ng/ml Hoechst (Sigma) at room temperature for 10 min. Slides were washed with PBS, Triton X-100, mounted in anti-fade medium (Bio-Rad), and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Leica Instruments).Telomerase Activity Assay Analysis—Atelomeric repeat amplification protocol was employed to determine telomerase activity essentially as described previously (22Li H. Zhao L. Yang Z. Funder J.W. Liu J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33436-33442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells treated with different reagents were washed and lysed by detaching and passing the cells though a 26½-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml syringe in pre-chilled telomeric repeat amplification protocol lysis buffer (0.5% CHAPS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 63 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and mixture protease inhibitors). The nuclei were isolated by centrifugation and protein content determined. Equal amounts of nuclear telomerase extracts (0.4 μg) were incubated with telomeric DNA substrate and dNTP, and de novo synthesized telomeric DNA, with or without phenol and chloroform extraction, was amplified by PCR using specific telomeric DNA primers in the presence of [α-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and Taq DNA polymerase. The resultant 32P-labeled telomeric DNA ladders were resolved by polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. To monitor nonspecific PCR effects, additional primers were included: NT (ATCGCTTCTCGGCCTTTT) and TSNT (AATCCGTCGAGCAGAGTTAAAAGGCCGAGAAGCGAT). Negative controls that were treated with either RNase A or alkaline phosphatase to inactivate telomerase were included in each experiment.Apoptosis and the Cell Cycle Analysis—Apoptosis and the cell cycle analysis were performed as described (23Gong J. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Briefly, both adherent and floating cells were fixed with 80% cold ethanol, pelleted by centrifugation, stained with propidium iodide and analyzed using an EPICS 752 flow cytometer. Cell debris, doublets, and fixation artifacts were gated out, and G0-G1, S, G2-M, and apoptotic populations recorded on a logarithmic scale. Apoptotic cells were identified as the lower fluorescence peak (“sub-G1 peak” on DNA frequency histograms) due to their reduced DNA content or detected with Apoptaq TUNEL kit (Oncor Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Alternatively, apoptotic cells were stained with Annexin V-FLUOS conjugate (Roche Diagnostics) and propidium iodide (Sigma) at room temperature for 15 min in an incubation buffer that facilitates binding per the manufacturer's instructions. Analyzed for Annexin V and propidium iodide staining in FL-2 and FL-3 channels, respectively, the percentages of stained cells were determined using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). An acquisition gate was set to include ∼20,000 of the centrally located cells for each sample acquisition using linear forward scatter versus linear side scatter. This acquisition strategy resulted in ∼40,000 ungated events being included for each sample analysis. Dot-plot integration was determinate from the background fluorescence using unstained cells. This integration cursor placement remained unchanged when stained cells were analyzed.RESULTSRequirement of Ets2 for Telomerase Activity and hTERT Gene Expression in Breast Cancer Cells—To investigate the role of Ets1 and Ets2 in regulating telomerase, we selectively silenced each of the Ets1 and Ets2 genes using small hairpin RNAs (shRNA) or synthetic siRNA targeting Ets1 and Ets2 mRNA specifically. MCF-7 cells were transfected stably with Ets1 shRNA construct, Ets2 shRNA constructs, or transiently with siRNA for 48 h. Whereas silencing Ets1 had no significant effect on telomerase activity, silencing Ets2 induced a marked inhibition of telomerase activity to 30–40% of the controls (Fig. 1A). Immunofluorescence staining of the telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT showed significant reduction of hTERT in the nucleus of Ets2-silenced cells (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the reduced telomerase activity and hTERT immunoreactivity, hTERT gene expression was decreased by about 75% in Ets2-silenced cells compared with controls expressing GFP or Ets1 shRNA (Fig. 1C). Western blotting confirmed a significant reduction of the Ets1 and Ets2 immunoreactivities induced by Ets1 and Ets2 RNAi, respectively (Fig. 1D). Thus, silencing the Ets2 gene triggered an inhibition of hTERT gene expression and telomerase activity in breast cancer MCF-7 cells.To explore the specificity and mechanisms of hTERT gene repression induced by Ets2 gene silencing, we examined Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL that were shown to be downstream target genes of Ets2 (14Carbone G.M. Napoli S. Valentini A. Cavalli F. Watson D.K. Catapano C.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4358-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). No significant change of the Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL gene expression was observed by Western blotting using specific antibodies in the same experiment where decreased gene expressions of Ets2 and hTERT were observed (Fig. 1D). However, we found that the proto-oncogene c-Myc was reduced significantly (Fig. 1E). The decrease of c-Myc was about 25% of controls, versus ∼70% decrease of the hTERT gene expression (Fig. 1F). The data suggest that hTERT and c-Myc are downstream target genes of Ets2, and that the hTERT gene is regulated by Ets2 directly and indirectly via c-Myc in human breast cancer cells.Ets2 Gene Silencing, hTERT Gene Repression, and Breast Cancer Cell Death—Because little is known of the cellular consequence of Ets regulation of telomerase activity, we determined the effect of gene silencing of Ets2 on breast cancer cell death by measuring Annexin V and propidium iodide staining-positive cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, 48 h post-transfection of MCF-7 cells with different shRNA plasmids, there was a significant inhibition of cell proliferation in cell cultures transfected with Ets2 shRNA, whereas control cells underwent exponential cell population doublings. The reduction of cell numbers in the Ets2-transfected cells was by about 70–75% of the controls transfected with GFP shRNA (Fig. 2A). Significant floating cells were noted under the microscope and staining of the attached cells with crystal violet blue showed a significant cell loss (not shown). DNA da"

For pentameric channels related to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and tetrameric channels such as glutamate receptors, the pore-forming and gate regions have been studied extensively. In contrast, little is known about the structure of trimeric P2X receptor channels, a family of channels that are activated by ATP and are important in neuronal signaling, pain transmission and inflammation. To identify the pore-forming and gate regions in P2X receptor channels, we introduced cysteine residues throughout the two transmembrane (TM) segments and studied their accessibility to thiol-reactive compounds and ions. Our results show that TM2 lines the central ion-conduction pore, TM1 is positioned peripheral to TM2 and the flow of ions is minimized in the closed state by a gate formed by the external region of TM2."

https://openalex.org/W2092149409,"β-O-Linked N-acetylglucosamine is a dynamic post-translational modification involved in protein regulation in a manner similar to phosphorylation. Removal of N-acetylglucosamine is regulated by β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase), which was previously shown to be a substrate of caspase-3 in vitro. Here we show that O-GlcNAcase is cleaved by caspase-3 into two fragments during apoptosis, an N-terminal fragment containing the O-GlcNAcase active site and a C-terminal fragment containing a region with homology to GCN5 histone acetyl-transferases. The caspase-3 cleavage site of O-GlcNAcase, mapped by Edman sequencing, is a noncanonical recognition site that occurs after Asp-413 of the SVVD sequence in human O-GlcNAcase. A point mutation, D413A, abrogates cleavage by caspase-3 both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that O-GlcNAcase activity is not affected by caspase-3 cleavage because the N- and C-terminal O-GlcNAcase fragments remain associated after the cleavage. Furthermore, when co-expressed simultaneously in the same cell, the N-terminal and C-terminal caspase fragments associate to reconstitute O-GlcNAcase enzymatic activity. These studies support the identification of O-GlcNAcase as a caspase-3 substrate with a novel caspase-3 cleavage site and provide insight about O-GlcNAcase regulation during apoptosis. β-O-Linked N-acetylglucosamine is a dynamic post-translational modification involved in protein regulation in a manner similar to phosphorylation.

Tsang E. Ruland J. Iscove N.N. Dennis J.W. Mak T.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5092-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In response to various forms of cellular stress, O-GlcNAc levels are increased, resulting in cells that are more thermotolerant (31Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1673: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Increased O-GlcNAc levels also protects cardiomyocytes during ischemia/reperfusion (32Champattanachai V. Marchase R.B. Chatham J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C178-C187Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that O-GlcNAc may promote cell survival, and loss of O-GlcNAc could result in defective proliferation and cell death. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a naturally occurring process important in normal development and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (34Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6256) Google Scholar, 35Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). There are two major apoptotic pathways: the mitochondrial and the death receptor pathways (34Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6256) Google Scholar, 35Danial N.N.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 526-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial pathway is triggered by activation of pro-apoptotic proteins at the mitochondria, whereas the death receptor pathway is activated by the death family receptors such as tumor necrosis factor receptor I and CD95 (Fas). Apoptotic stimulation by any of these pathways leads to activation of a cascade of a family of cysteine proteases called caspases (37Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6151) Google Scholar). One of the most crucial effector caspases is caspase-3. Activation of caspase-3 leads to proteolysis of several protein substrates. This proteolytic cleavage usually results in either inactivation of proteins that protect living cells or activation of proteins that promote cell death (37Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6151) Google Scholar, 38Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1841-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Interestingly, O-GlcNAcase is an in vitro substrate of caspase-3 (26Wells L. Gao Y. Mahoney J.A. Vosseller K. Chen C. Rosen A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1755-1761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether O-GlcNAcase is also a caspase-3 substrate in vivo and how caspase-3 cleavage affects the behavior of O-GlcNAcase. O-GlcNAcase cleavage may alter the properties of O-GlcNAcase, which may in turn have effects that could further alter O-GlcNAc levels and/or further influence apoptotic events. Hence, altered O-GlcNAc modification may be another hallmark of apoptotic pathways. In this study, we examined how apoptosis affects the behavior of O-GlcNAcase in vivo to better understand the role of O-GlcNAc in apoptosis. Materials and Antibodies—Rabbit anti-O-GlcNAcase antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Wally Whiteheart (University of Kentucky). Anti-O-GlcNAc 110.6 was made by our laboratory. Rabbit anti-caspase-3 antibody was obtained from Stressgen. Anti-Fas mouse IgM CH-11 and rabbit anti-PARP antibodies were from Millipore. Anti-HA and anti-c-Myc (9E10) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-mouse IgM and secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgM were purchased from Sigma. Anti-rabbit and anti-chicken horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were from GE Healthcare and Promega, respectively. PUGNAc was purchased from Carbogen (Switzerland). Pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD(OMe)-fmk and caspase-3 inhibitor (Z-D(OMe)E(OMe)VD(OMe)-fmk were purchased from Calbiochem. Recombinant caspase-3 was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. Generation of O-GlcNAcase Antibodies—Through Sigma, we created a rabbit polyclonal antibody and a chicken polyclonal antibody specific to the N and C termini of O-GlcNAcase, respectively, using peptides purified from bacteria expressing amino acids 1–413 (N-terminally specific) and amino acids 414–916 (C-terminally specific) of the human O-GlcNAcase protein sequence. Prior to use, rabbit serum (for anti-N-terminal O-GlcNAcase antibody) or chicken IgY extracts (for anti-C-terminal O-GlcNAcase) were passed through antigen-coupled columns (coupled with either the N-terminal or the C-terminal O-GlcNAcase peptides) three times. The columns were washed with at least 20 column volumes of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, followed by 20 column volumes of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 500 mm NaCl. The antibodies were eluted by 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.0, and concentrated into 40% glycerol in PBS. Plasmid Constructions—Full-length O-GlcNAcase was subcloned into pET32 vector or pRK5-c-Myc vector with c-Myc tag located at the N terminus. O-GlcNAcase D413A clone was generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis XL II (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the O-GlcNAcase D413A mutant was generated by PCR amplification using DNA from either pRK5 or pET32 plasmids containing the full-length O-GlcNAcase as a template. The forward and reverse primers for PCR amplication from 5′ to 3′ ends were GCTAAAGCAAGTGTAGTTGCTGGTACCCCTTTAGTTGCAGC and GCTGCAACTAAAGGGGTACCAGCAACTACACTTGCTTTAGC, respectively. The N- and C-terminal O-GlcNAcase mutants were created by PCR amplification. The forward and reverse primers to amplify the N-terminal O-GlcNAcase were ACGCGTCGACCATGGTGCAGAAGGAGAGTCA and ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTCAATCAACTACACTTGCTTTAG. The forward and reverse primers to amplify the C-terminal O-GlcNAcase were ACGCGTCGACCGGGACTCCTTTAGTTGCAGC and ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTCACAGGCTCCGACCAAGTA, respectively. The PCR fragments were then subcloned into the pRK5-cMyc or pRK5-HA vectors with c-Myc tag or HA tag located at the N terminus of each construct. The amino acid sequences of c-Myc tag and HA tag are MEQKLISEEDLN and MGYPYDVPDYADLN, respectively. O-GlcNAcase and O-GlcNAcase mutant sequences were verified by sequencing. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Apoptosis Induction—Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products) and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. The cells were transfected with expression vectors using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. To induce apoptosis, Jurkat cells were treated with 100 ng/ml of anti-Fas CH11 Ab. The same amount of anti-mouse IgM was used in control cells. The cells were harvested at the indicated times. To inhibit apoptosis in Jurkat cells, all of the caspase inhibitors were incubated with Jurkat cells 1 h prior to Fas stimulation. HeLa cells were treated with anti-Fas CH11 Ab and harvested 4 h after apoptotic induction. Western Blot Analysis—After treatment, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed in either 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (for Jurkat cells) or 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (for HeLa cells) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor cocktails, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 5 mm sodium fluoride. The cells were incubated with lysis buffer on ice with occasional vortexing for 40 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were collected and separated using Tris-HCl gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad). The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with either 3% BSA in TBST (for anti-110.6, anti-c-Myc, and anti-HA antibodies) or 5% milk in TBST (for anti-O-GlcNAcase, anti-PARP, and anti-caspase-3 antibodies) for 1 h. The membranes were then probed with antibodies to O-GlcNAc (1:5,000), O-GlcNAcase (anti-full-length O-GlcNAcase; 1:5000; anti-N-terminal O-GlcNAcase; 1:1,000; anti-C-terminal O-GlcNAcase; 1:1,000), PARP (1:5,000), HA (1:5,000), c-Myc (1:5,000), and caspase-3 (1:2,500) overnight at 4 °C. Next, the membranes were washed with TBST five times for 10 min, probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h, and washed with TBST five times for 10 min followed by TBS for 10 min. Detection was carried out by ECL (GE Healthcare). Immunoprecipitation—Cell extracts were incubated with an antibody specific to the C terminus of O-GlcNAcase at 4 °C overnight. The next day, the mixtures were incubated with IgY-agarose beads (Gallus Immunotech, Inc.) for 2 h at 4 °C. the beads were washed with cell extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40). Laemmli buffer was added to the washed beads, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Purification of Recombinant O-GlcNAcase—For expression of active O-GlcNAcase, the human O-GlcNAcase cDNA was subcloned into pET32 vector and transformed into BL21 bacteria. A freshly transformed colony was picked to inoculate 50 ml of LB and grown at 37 °C overnight. The next day, the inoculated LB were added to 1 liter of LB and grown at 37 °C to A600 = 0.6 before induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The bacteria were next grown for 4 h at room temperature, harvested by centrifugation (3,000 × g, 15 min), and washed with cold PBS. The bacterial pellet was frozen overnight, slowly thawed and lysed by PBS supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktails and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The bacterial DNA was sheared by sonication, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation (30,000 × g, 30 min). The supernatant containing active O-GlcNAcase was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (45%), stirred for 1 h at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibration buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl) with protease inhibitor cocktails and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The resuspension was passed through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen). The column was washed with 5 column volumes of equilibration buffer, 5 column volumes of wash buffer 1 (5 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl), and 5 column volumes of wash buffer 2 (30 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl). Recombinant O-GlcNAcase was eluted with 2 column volumes of elution buffer (500 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl). Active O-GlcNAcase was dialyzed in PBS at 4 °C overnight, concentrated using Centricon concentrator (Millipore), and stored in 40% glycerol. Recombinant O-GlcNAcase D413A mutant was also purified using the same protocol. O-GlcNAcase Activity Assay—O-GlcNAcase activity assays were performed as previously described (18). O-GlcNAcase activity was measured directly using the synthetic substrate pNP-GlcNAc (Sigma). Caspase-3 in Vitro Cleavage Assay—Caspase-3 cleavage assays were performed as previously described with some modifications (43Kipp M. Schwab B.L. Przybylski M. Nicotera P. Fackelmayer F.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5031-5036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, wild-type O-GlcNAcase or O-GlcNAcase D413A mutant was incubated with recombinant caspase-3 in caspase-3 reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS) for 2.5 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer. Cleavage products were resolved onto a 7.5% SDS-PAGE and either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 or transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and immunoblotted with anti-O-GlcNAcase antibody. Cleavage Site Mapping—Cleavage site mapping by Edman sequencing was performed as previously described (43Kipp M. Schwab B.L. Przybylski M. Nicotera P. Fackelmayer F.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5031-5036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, 120 μg of purified recombinant pET32 O-GlcNAcase was incubated with 5,000 units of purified caspase-3 in caspase-3 reaction buffer for 2.5 h at 37 °C. Cleavage products were separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 1 min and destained in 50% methanol. Segments of polyvinylidene difluoride membrane containing O-GlcNAcase fragments were subjected to automated sequencing on an Applied Biosystems Procise® 484 cLC protein sequencing system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Note that one unit of caspase-3 was equal to 1 pmol/min at 30 °C using Ac-DEVD-pNA as substrate. Cleavage of Recombinant O-GlcNAcase by Caspase-3 in Vitro—Our previous report showed that O-GlcNAcase could be cleaved by caspase-3 in vitro (26Wells L. Gao Y. Mahoney J.A. Vosseller K. Chen C. Rosen A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1755-1761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To confirm that recombinant O-GlcNAcase was indeed a caspase-3 substrate, we cloned human O-GlcNAcase cDNA into pET32 vector, purified, and performed in vitro cleavage assay with recombinant caspase-3. Incubation of recombinant O-GlcNAcase with caspase-3 resulted in cleavage of O-GlcNAcase that yielded fragments distinguishable by gel electrophoresis from that found in the untreated O-GlcNAcase in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). We found that O-GlcNAcase was cleaved by caspase-3 into four different fragments with molecular masses of 150, 72, 70, and 60 kDa. This cleavage could be blocked by the caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (Fig. 1B). In agreement with our previous report, cleavage of O-GlcNAcase by caspase-3 did not result in any changes in O-GlcNAcase enzyme activity (Fig. 1C). O-GlcNAcase Cleavage Occurs during Apoptosis in Vivo—Because O-GlcNAcase is a caspase-3 substrate in vitro, we next examined whether caspase-3 might also be responsible for cleavage of O-GlcNAcase in vivo. Apoptosis was induced in Jurkat cells using anti-Fas CH11 Ab, because Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells is a well characterized model for apoptosis (44Weis M. Schlegel J. Kass G.E. Holmstrom T.H. Peters I. Eriksson J. Orrenius S. Chow S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 45Algeciras-Schimnich A. Shen L. Barnhart B.C. Murmann A.E. Burkhardt J.K. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). As seen by immunoblotting with the O-GlcNAcase-specific polyclonal antibody, O-GlcNAcase cleavage is observed after 2 h of apoptotic induction, suggesting that O-GlcNAcase was cleaved by an apoptotic enzyme in vivo (Fig. 2A). In addition, O-GlcNAcase cleavage occurred at the same time as that of PARP, which is a well known substrate of caspase-3 (40Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3789) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc levels on proteins in Jurkat cells were also altered during apoptosis, as seen by immunoblotting with the O-GlcNAc-specific monoclonal antibody, CTD 110.6 (Fig. 2B). This suggests that alterations in O-GlcNAc-modified proteins occurred specifically in response to Fas-mediated apoptosis. In addition, the patterns of changes in O-GlcNAc levels appeared to be specific depending on the proteins, suggesting that some proteins are more susceptible to decreased or increased O-GlcNAc levels, and these changes may be associated with their functions during apoptosis. Even though we could not rule out the possibility that changes in O-GlcNAc levels are not due to changes in protein levels upon apoptosis, we did not detect apparent changes of protein levels from G-250 staining of lysate from cells undergoing apoptotic compared with those from uninduced cells (supplemental Fig. S1). The addition of PUGNAc to cells prior to apoptosis induction also increased O-GlcNAc levels on proteins that showed decreased O-GlcNAc during apoptosis, suggesting that changes in O-GlcNAc levels were not solely due to protein degradation (supplemental Fig. S1). In addition to Jurkat cells, we also examined O-GlcNAcase cleavage during apoptosis in other cell lines. We found that O-GlcNAcase cleavage also occurs in HeLa cells during Fas-mediated apoptosis, indicating that O-GlcNAcase is a substrate of a protease that is activated in the Fas signaling pathway during apoptosis (data not shown). Next, we examined whether other types of apoptosis could induce O-GlcNAcase cleavage. We induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells using hydrogen peroxide, which works through the mitochondrial pathway instead of the receptor pathway (46Dumont A. H"

https://openalex.org/W2008762509,"Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a fatal autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the accumulation of free cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in the endosomal-lysosomal system. Patients with NPC disease have markedly progressive neuronal loss, mainly of cerebellar Purkinje neurons. There is strong evidence indicating that cholesterol accumulation and trafficking defects activate apoptosis in NPC brains. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relevance of apoptosis and particularly the proapoptotic c-Abl/p73 system in cerebellar neuron degeneration in NPC disease. We used the NPC1 mouse model to evaluate c-Abl/p73 expression and activation in the cerebellum and the effect of therapy with the c-Abl-specific inhibitor imatinib. The proapoptotic c-Abl/p73 system and the p73 target genes are expressed in the cerebellums of NPC mice. Furthermore, inhibition of c-Abl with imatinib preserved Purkinje neurons and reduced general cell apoptosis in the cerebellum, improved neurological symptoms, and increased the survival of NPC mice. Moreover, this prosurvival effect correlated with reduced mRNA levels of p73 proapoptotic target genes. Our results suggest that the c-Abl/p73 pathway is involved in NPC neurodegeneration and show that treatment with c-Abl inhibitors is useful in delaying progressive neurodegeneration, supporting the use of imatinib for clinical treatment of patients with NPC disease."
https://openalex.org/W2056378761,"Carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) is a glucose-responsive transcription factor that activates genes involved in de novo lipogenesis in mammals. The current model for glucose activation of ChREBP proposes that increased glucose metabolism triggers a cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation of ChREBP that is critical for activation. However, we find that ChREBP actively shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus in both low and high glucose in the glucose-sensitive β cell-derived line, 832/13. Glucose stimulates a 3-fold increase in the rate of ChREBP nuclear entry, but trapping ChREBP in the nucleus by mutagenesis or with a nuclear export inhibitor does not lead to constitutive activation. In fact, mutational studies targeting the nuclear export signal of ChREBP also identified a distinct function essential for glucose-dependent transcriptional activation. From this, we conclude that an additional event independent of nuclear translocation is required for activation. The N-terminal segment of ChREBP (amino acids 1-298) has previously been shown to repress activity under basal conditions. This segment has five highly conserved regions, Mondo conserved regions 1-5 (MCR1 to -5). Based on activating mutations in MCR2 and MCR5, we propose that these two regions act coordinately to repress ChREBP in low glucose. In addition, other mutations in MCR2 and mutations in MCR3 were found to prevent glucose activation.

Both ChREBP and Mlx are required for binding to the ChoRE, but recent evidence establishes ChREBP as the direct target of glucose signaling. ChREBP is highly expressed in glucose-responsive tissues, such as the liver, adipose, and pancreas, whereas Mlx expression is ubiquitous (23Billin A.N. Eilers A.L. Queva C. Ayer D.E. J. Biol.

Similarly, cultured mouse hepatocytes in which ChREBP expression has been inhibited by small interfering RNA do not induce lipogenic gene expression in response to glucose (26Dentin R. Pegorier J.P.

Finally, a fusion protein of the Gal4 DNA binding domain and ChREBP can activate an appropriate reporter gene in response to glucose, even when the Mlx-interacting region of ChREBP is deleted (27Collier J.J.

Hence, ChREBP is the major target of the glucose signaling pathway, whereas Mlx serves to help recruit ChREBP to appropriate target genes (30Ma L. Sham Y.Y. Walters K.J. Towle H.C.

The originally proposed and widely accepted model for ChREBP activation suggests that its activity is regulated by reversible phosphorylation (20Ishii S. Iizuka K. Miller B.C. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15597-15602Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 31Uyeda K. Repa J.J. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 107-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In this model, protein kinase A phosphorylates residues Ser-196, Ser-626, and Thr-666 of ChREBP in low glucose conditions, restricting it to the cytoplasm and inhibiting its DNA binding (19Kawaguchi T. Takenoshita M. Li Y. Kabashima T. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13710-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). An increase in glucose metabolism stimulates protein phosphatase 2A activity via direct binding to the glucose metabolite xyulose-5-phosphate (32Kabashima T. Kawaguchi T. Wadzinski B.E. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5107-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of ChREBP at these critical protein kinase A sites allows ChREBP to translocate to the nucleus and bind to the ChoRE, which is sufficient for activation of lipogenic gene expression. Subsequent studies performed by our laboratory and others have questioned the current model for glucose regulation of ChREBP. The level of phosphorylation of ChREBP did not decrease in response to high glucose, as predicted by the current model (33Tsatsos N.G. Towle H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mutating residues Ser-196, Ser-626, and Thr-666 to alanines did not lead to constitutive activation, suggesting that dephosphorylation of these residues is not sufficient for activation (27Collier J.J. Zhang P. Pedersen K.B. Burke S.J. Haycock J.W. Scott D.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: E48-E56Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Li M.V. Chang B. Imamura M. Poungvarin N. Chan L.

Finally, inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A in 832/13 cells by the addition of cantharidic acid did not interfere with the activation of ChREBP by glucose (28Li M.V. Chang B. Imamura M. Poungvarin N. Chan L. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that although protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation may repress ChREBP activity under fasting conditions, reversal of this phosphorylation is not sufficient for glucose activation. To address the mechanism of ChREBP activation, we further evaluated the connection between ChREBP localization and glucose-stimulated activity. We present evidence that ChREBP shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in both low and high glucose conditions, but accumulation in the nucleus occurs more rapidly in high glucose conditions than in low. However, nuclear localization is not sufficient for ChREBP activation. Thus, we suggest that there are additional events, independent of nuclear localization, required for glucose activation of ChREBP. Construction of Mutant ChREBP Plasmids—Site-specific mutations of ChREBP were constructed with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using mouse FLAG-tagged ChREBP in the expression plasmid CMVS4 as a template (21Stoeckman A.K. Ma L. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15662-15669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). All mutations and coding sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Immunoblotting of ChREBP from transfected HEK293 cells was performed using FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) to ensure that each construct was expressed. Only mutants with comparable expression to wild-type (WT) ChREBP were used for subsequent analysis. Transcriptional Reporter Gene Assays for Measuring ChREBP Activity—832/13 cells (a gift from Dr. C. Newgard, Duke University) were cultured in RPMI media containing 11 mm glucose in 24-well plates, as previously described (34Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Cells were transduced with adenovirus expressing dominant negative ChREBP (29Tsatsos N.G. Davies M.N. O'Callaghan B.L. Towle H.C. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The amount of virus used was determined empirically to give ∼90% inhibition of the glucose response. After 2 h of transduction, 832/13 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) with a mixture of firefly luciferase reporter (700 ng) driven by the ACC ChoRE-containing promoter region (33Tsatsos N.G. Towle H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and a Renilla luciferase control plasmid (pRL-CMV; 15 ng; Promega). In addition, where indicated, cells were also co-transfected with 60 ng of each ChREBP expression plasmid and 30 ng of Mlx expression plasmid. After 18 h, cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing low (2.5 mm) or high (25 mm) glucose for 24 h and lysates were prepared in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Dual luciferase assays were performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Values represent the ratio of firefly/Renilla luciferase from triplicate samples and are expressed as mean ± S.D. Immunolocalization of ChREBP—832/13 cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 11 mm glucose on glass slides and grown to 70% confluence (29Tsatsos N.G. Davies M.N. O'Callaghan B.L. Towle H.C. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with 0.15 μg each of FLAG-tagged WT or mutant ChREBP and hemagglutinin-tagged Mlx using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 1.1 μl of Virofect (Targeting Systems, San Diego, CA). After overnight transfection, cells were refed RPMI medium containing 2.5 mm glucose for 4 h. Cells were then incubated in RPMI medium containing 2.5 or 25 mm glucose for 2 h. Where indicated, leptomycin B was added at 3.6 μm. After treatment, cells were fixed in a 1.6% formaldehyde solution containing phosphate-buffered saline and 0.2% Triton. Cells were subsequently washed in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Triton and incubated overnight in a humidity chamber at 4 °C. The slides were washed two additional times and then blocked with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Triton, and 5 μl/ml donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Following the block, fixed cells were incubated with 0.25 μg of FLAG monoclonal antibody for 1 h at 37°C and washed five more times, followed by incubation with a secondary FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for an additional 1 h. Nuclei were stained with TO-PRO3 (Molecular Probes) during the final wash steps. Cells were imaged using a multiphoton confocal microscope (Fluoview 1000; Olympus). Co-immunoprecipitation—832/13 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged ChREBP and Mlx in RMPI medium containing 11 mm glucose, as described above. After 36 h, cells were collected in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and then lysed in a glass-Teflon homogenizer. Anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma) were added, and samples were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoadsorbed proteins were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated 14-3-3β antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Measurement of mRNA by Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated from 832/13 cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and selected ChREBP target gene products were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR performed by a two-step procedure described previously (35Ma L. Robinson L.N. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28721-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Primers were designed using MacVector (Accelrys Software, Inc.). Reverse transcription-PCR results are expressed as -fold induction by normalizing the mean of the Ct values from the high glucose-treated cells relative to the mean of Ct values from low glucose cells. All samples were analyzed in triplicate and expressed as mean ± S.E. ChREBP Shuttles between the Nucleus and Cytoplasm under Low and High Glucose Conditions—The human homolog of ChREBP, Wbscr14 (36de Luis O. Valero M.C. Jurado L.A. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 8: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the ChREBP paralog, MondoA (37Billin A.N. Eilers A.L. Coulter K.L. Logan J.S. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 8845-8854Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), have been shown to shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus in several cell lines, such as mouse 3T3, monkey COS7, and human 293 cells (38Eilers A.L. Sundwell E. Lin M. Sullivan A.A. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8514-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 39Merla G. Ucla C. Guipponi M. Reymond A. Hum. Genet. 2002; 110: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, these cell lines are not known to respond transcriptionally to changes in glucose metabolism. Thus, we decided to examine ChREBP nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and the effect of glucose on this process in a glucose-sensitive cell line. Immunofluorescence was performed in 832/13 cells, an INS-1-derived cell line with robust glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (34Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). These cells express ChREBP and support a transcriptional activation of ChREBP in response to elevated glucose (24Wang H. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32746-32752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Collier J.J. Zhang P. Pedersen K.B. Burke S.J. Haycock J.W. Scott D.K. Am. J.

Mlx was incorporated in these studies because of its known interaction with ChREBP (21Stoeckman A.K. Ma L. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15662-15669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 30Ma L. Sham Y.Y. Walters K.J. Towle H.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), its requirement for ChREBP-dependent gene transcription (22Ma L. Tsatsos N.G. Towle H.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 28721-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and its requirement for ChREBP nuclear entry (see Fig. S1). Transfected cells were incubated in low glucose medium for 4 h and then treated with either low or high glucose medium for 2 h. At this time, optimal induction of several ChREBP target genes is observed (28Li M.V. Chang B. Imamura M. Poungvarin N. Chan L. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 35Ma L. Robinson L.N. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28721-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was performed with anti-FLAG primary and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by confocal microscopy. As expected, ChREBP was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm under low glucose conditions (Fig. 1a). However, as previously reported (29Tsatsos N.G. Davies M.N. O'Callaghan B.L. Towle H.C. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), treatment of cells with high glucose to induce ChREBP activity did not result in a major accumulation of ChREBP in the nucleus. The majority of fluorescent signal in these cells was still found within the cytoplasm. Quantification of signals from a large number of cells revealed that 94% displayed cytoplasmic localization and 6% had signals from both cytoplasm and nucleus in low glucose (Fig. 2a). In high glucose, ChREBP was cytoplasmic in 78%, both cytoplasmic and nuclear in 18%, and nuclear in 2% of cells. Hence, although there was a shift to a more nuclear pattern in high glucose, this trend was only observed in a small fraction of the total cells. Similar results were reported for a green fluorescent protein-tagged fusion of ChREBP in 832/13 cells at 6 h of glucose treatment (28Li M.V. Chang B. Imamura M. Poungvarin N. Chan L. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2The rate of ChREBP nuclear entry is increased in high glucose conditions. a, 832/13 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged ChREBP and Mlx overnight in RPMI medium containing 11 mm glucose and were then incubated in low glucose medium for 4 h. Cells were then treated with either low or high glucose for 2 h, and immunofluorescence was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Over 100 cells in each treatment were scored as predominantly cytoplasmic, both cytoplasmic and nuclear, or predominantly nuclear by two observers. Results represent the means ± S.E. for three experiments. b, cells were treated with low (open triangles) or high glucose (closed squares) medium with the addition of leptomycin B at various time points as indicated. Immunofluorescence and quantification was performed as described above. Cells displaying either predominantly nuclear or both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization were combined and expressed as a percentage of the total cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since ChREBP was located in the cytoplasm under high glucose conditions in the majority of cells, shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus must occur to support its transcriptional function. The domains of Wbscr14 and MondoA found to contain the nuclear export signal (NES) are highly conserved in ChREBP, suggesting that it may be subject to Crm-1-dependent export. To confirm this, localization of ChREBP was observed in 832/13 cells treated with low or high glucose conditions for 2 h with the addition of leptomycin B, a Crm-1 nuclear export inhibitor (Fig. 1b). ChREBP accumulated in the nucleus in high glucose conditions with leptomycin B treatment, as expected. However, ChREBP was found predominantly in the nucleus in low glucose as well. The observation that ChREBP actively shuttles under low glucose conditions in which it is not transcriptionally active suggests that an additional event is required for its transcriptional activation. The Rate of ChREBP Nuclear Entry Is Increased under High Glucose Conditions—The fact that ChREBP is predominantly cytoplasmic under stimulating conditions indicates that only a fraction of total cellular ChREBP needs to be in the nucleus for gene activation. Therefore, it seemed plausible that glucose might act by transiently increasing the rate of ChREBP entry to the nucleus without a dramatic shift in the cellular pool of ChREBP to the nuclear compartment. To measure its rate of nuclear accumulation, 832/13 cells were co-transfected with ChREBP and Mlx. Subsequently, cells were treated with leptomycin B, and the time course of ChREBP nuclear accumulation in low or high glucose conditions was compared. ChREBP localization was classified as cytoplasmic, both cytoplasmic and nuclear, or nuclear. Cells that displayed either nuclear or both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization were combined to represent cells that had initiated nuclear accumulation. An increased nuclear accumulation was observed in high glucose conditions at the 15 and 30 min time points relative to cells maintained in low glucose (Fig. 2). At 45 min, the difference in ChREBP accumulation between treatments was less evident, and at 1 h, ChREBP was predominantly nuclear in both low and high glucose conditions. From the time required to achieve 50% nuclear accumulation, we estimate that the rate of nuclear entry was 3-fold greater in high glucose compared with low glucose. Thus, we conclude that glucose regulates ChREBP at the level of nuclear entry. The L86A/L93A ChREBP Mutant Is Deficient in Nuclear Export and Is Not Transcriptionally Active—The observation that ChREBP enters the nucleus more rapidly in high glucose raises the question of whether this event is sufficient to account for the elevated ChREBP activity in these conditions. To further examine this question, a mutant ChREBP deficient in nuclear export was constructed and tested for functional activity. This ChREBP mutant was prepared by mutating two conserved leucine residues (Leu-86 and Leu-93) in the NES to alanines. The comparable mutations in Wbscr14 and MondoA have been shown to accumulate in the nucleus (38Eilers A.L. Sundwell E. Lin M. Sullivan A.A. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8514-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 39Merla G. Ucla C. Guipponi M. Reymond A. Hum. Genet. 2002; 110: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To test whether the L86A/L93A ChREBP mutant is deficient in nuclear export, we performed immunofluorescence in 832/13 cells (Fig. 3a). The L86A/L93A ChREBP mutant localizes to the nucleus under both low and high glucose conditions without the addition of leptomycin B, indicating that this mutant was indeed deficient in nuclear export. We then tested the activity of the L86A/L93A mutant using a functional rescue assay that our laboratory has previously established (33Tsatsos N.G. Towle H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To accomplish this, 832/13 cells were transduced with an adenoviral construct expressing a dominant negative form of ChREBP. This form of ChREBP is able to dimerize with Mlx, but the resultant dimer cannot bind to DNA. Hence, this mutant ChREBP competes with endogenous ChREBP for Mlx heterodimerization. Subsequently, 832/13 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing WT or mutant ChREBP, together with a ChoRE-containing reporter construct. The activity of the reporter gene reflects the ability of the overexpressed ChREBP to support a glucose response. As shown in Fig. 3b, overexpressing WT ChREBP rescues the glucose response, although not to the level of endogenous ChREBP. The extent of rescue in different experiments varied from 30 to 80%, depending on the effectiveness of the viral transduction of dominant negative ChREBP. However, the L86A/L93A ChREBP mutant did not rescue the glucose response, indicating that it is not functional for transcriptional activation. Western blotting showed that L86A/L93A ChREBP is expressed equivalently to WT ChREBP (see Fig. S2) and bound to a ChoRE-containing oligonucleotide in an electro-phoretic mobility shift assay. 3M. N., Davies, and H. C., Towle, unpublished results. Thus, trapping ChREBP within the nucleus did not result in constitutive transcriptional activation, as might have been expected, but rather a loss of function. Preventing Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling of ChREBP Does Not Inhibit Glucose Activation—We considered two possible explanations for why the L86A/L93A mutant is inactive despite its nuclear localization: (a) ChREBP may need to be activated by an event in the cytoplasm and nucleocytop"

Here we demonstrate that inhibition of LOX activity by β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) reduced the chemotactic response and sensitivity of these cells toward LOX and toward PDGF-BB. The chemotactic activity of PDGF-BB was significantly enhanced in the presence of a non-chemotactic concentration of LOX. We considered the possibility that extracellular LOX may oxidize cell surface proteins, including the PDGF receptor-β (PDGFR-β), to affect PDGF-BB-induced chemotaxis. Plasma membranes purified from control SMC contained oxidized PDGFR-β. The oxidation of this receptor and other membrane proteins was largely prevented in cells preincubated with BAPN. Addition of purified LOX to these cells restored the profile of oxidized proteins toward that of control cells. The high affinity and capacity for the binding of PDGF-BB by cells containing oxidized PDGFR-β was diminished by ∼2-fold when compared with cells in which oxidation by LOX was prevented by BAPN. Phosphorylated members of the PDGFR-β-dependent signal transduction pathway, including PDGFR-β, SHP2, AKT1, and ERK1/ERK2 (p44/42 MAPK), turned over faster in BAPN-treated than in control SMCs.

In addition to the non-ionic aldehyde product, the LOX-catalyzed reaction acting on protonated lysine produces stoichiometric amounts of hydrogen peroxide and ammonium, as shown in Reaction 1.RCH2NH3++H2O+O2→RCHO+H2O2+NH4+REACTION 1(Eq. 1) lysyl oxidase LOX-like embryonic rat aorta SMC line v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 β-aminoproprionitrile dinitrophenol dinitrophenylhydrazine extracellular signal-regulated kinase mouse embryonic fibroblasts neonatal rat aorta smooth muscle cells platelet-derived growth factor β SRC homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine mitogen-activated protein kinase. LOX is synthesized as an N-glycosylated preproprotein, which is secreted as the 50-kDa proprotein, proLOX. proLOX is activated by proteolysis to release the C-terminal moiety of the proprotein as the 32-kDa non-glycosylated functional catalyst (LOX) and the glycosylated propeptide in the extracellular space (2Panchenko M.V.

Deletion of the LOX gene does not alter embryonic development of the knock-out mouse but is perinatal lethal due to major defects in cardiovascular tissue and the respiratory system (3Mäki J.M.

In recent years, four lysyl oxidase-like proteins (LOXL), LOXL-1, -2, -3, and -4, have been identified in mammalian cells (5Csiszar K. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 70: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LOXL1 activity has recently been implicated in elastin homeostasis (6Liu X. Zhao Y. Gao J. Pawlyk B. Starcher B. Spencer J.A. Yanagisawa H. Zuo J. Li T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The spectrum of substrates and biological functions of LOXL-2, -3, and -4 remain to be established. Basic research on LOX began with the demonstration of the oxidation of peptidyl lysine in an elastin substrate by a crude aortic extract (7Pinnell S.R. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Subsequent investigations operated on the assumption that the function of this enzyme was restricted to its oxidation of its extracellular elastin and collagen substrates. Thus, it was of considerable interest that purified LOX was found to readily oxidize lysine within a variety of basic globular proteins (pI ≥ 8.0) in vitro, suggesting that its substrate specificity in vivo might be broader than initially thought (8Kagan H.M. Williams M.A. Williamson P.R. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11203-11207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the limited view of LOX function pertained until the striking observation was made that LOX acted as a suppressor of ras-induced carcinogenesis (9Kenyon K. Contente S. Trackman P.C. Tang J. Kagan H.M. Friedman R.M. Science. 1991; 253: 802Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 10Jeay S. Pianetti S. Kagan H.M. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 7: 2251-2263Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Subsequently, LOX has been implicated in a number of novel biological functions, including the regulation of the promoter activity of collagen type III (11Giampuzzi M. Botti G. Di Luca M. Arata L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36341-36349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the control of cell adhesion and growth (12Giampuzzi M. Oleggini R. Di Donato A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1647: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the metastatic phenotype of certain tumors in adult animals (13Kirschmann D.A. Seftor E.A. Fong S.F.T Nieva D.R.C Sullivan C.M.

Cell Biochem. 2007; 101: 1338-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Of additional interest is the finding that the mature extracellular catalyst can be found within the nuclei of fibrogenic vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts (16Li W. Nellaiappan K. Strassmaier T. Graham L. Thomas K.M. Kagan H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12817-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 17Nellaiappan K. Risitano A. Liu G. Nicklas G. Kagan H.M. J. Cell Biochem. 2000; 79: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that LOX purified from bovine aorta actively induces the migration of peripheral blood monocytes (18Lazarus H.M. Cruikshank W.W. Narasimhan N. Kagan H.M. Center D.M. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) (19Li W. Liu G. Chou I.N. Kagan H.M. J. Cell Biochem. 2000; 78: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, this chemotactic activity of LOX was fully inhibitable by β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), which inactivates catalysis by LOX, or by the presence of catalase in the chemotactic chamber assays (19Li W. Liu G. Chou I.N. Kagan H.M. J. Cell Biochem. 2000; 78: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The conclusions were drawn, therefore, that the enzymatic activity of LOX and the hydrogen peroxide product of its enzyme activity underlie the chemotactic response. Consistent with the principle that chemokines initiate cell migration by binding to cell membrane receptors, these studies also noted that the chemotactic response of SMCs to LOX did not reflect the interaction of this enzyme with soluble forms of its extracellular substrates secreted into the medium, but more likely required the direct interaction of this enzyme with the cell membrane (19Li W. Liu G. Chou I.N. Kagan H.M. J. Cell Biochem. 2000; 78: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The chemotactic response of vascular SMCs to LOX may prove to be relevant to certain pathologies. For example, normally quiescent vascular SMCs actively migrate from the arterial media to developing atherosclerotic lesions in the sub-endothelial region of diseased arteries, which, in turn, may relate to the observation that total LOX enzyme activity is significantly increased in the arterial lesions of atherosclerotic rabbits (20Kagan H.M. Raghavan J. Hollander W. Arteriosclerosis. 1981; 1: 287-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A more tangible relationship between LOX-induced migration and pathology has recently been demonstrated. Kirschmann and colleagues (13Kirschmann D.A. Seftor E.A. Fong S.F.T Nieva D.R.C Sullivan C.M. Edwards E.M. Sommer P. Csiszar K. Hendrix M.J.C Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4478-4483PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that the malignant invasion of breast cancer cells is induced by LOX and noted that this chemotactic response is inhibited by BAPN and by the presence of catalase, supporting the catalysis- and peroxide-dependent mechanism of LOX-induced chemotaxis reported earlier. LOX has also been implicated in the migration of malignant dermal cells in squamous cell carcinoma (21Bouez C. Reynaud C. Noblesse E. Thépot A. Gleyzal C. Kanitakis J. Perrier E. Damour O. Sommer P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 1463-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and in the directed movement of neurons (22Laczko R. Szauter K.M. Jansen M.K. Hollosi P. Muranyi M. Molnar J. Fong K.S. Hinek A. Csiszar K. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2007; 33: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Despite the number of well documented cellular and biological processes dependent on LOX activity, the relevant molecular mechanisms, including the identification of cell protein substrates that might be oxidized by LOX in these instances, has yet to be accomplished. We have approached this issue in part by studying the role of LOX in chemotaxis, a basic cellular response underlying several of the biological functions in which LOX is involved. Specifically, we have focused on the effect of LOX activity on chemotaxis induced by LOX and by PDGF-BB in rat aorta SMCs. The results reveal that oxidation of specific plasma membrane proteins by LOX is required for optimal chemotactic responses of SMCs. This newly documented priming effect of LOX on chemotaxis is clearly distinguishable from the acute chemotactic effect of this enzyme previously described (19Li W. Liu G. Chou I.N. Kagan H.M. J. Cell Biochem. 2000; 78: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Materials—Rat recombinant, protein carrier-free PDGF-BB (R&D Systems), 125I-Monoiodo Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham Biosciences Corporation), rabbit anti-dinitrophenol antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody, and rabbit anti-actin antibody (Invitrogen), oxy-blot protein oxidation detection kit (Chemicon International), rabbit polyclonal anti-PDGFR-β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), rabbit polyclonal antibodies against prosphoproteins of the PDGFR-β signal transduction pathway described in the text (Cell Signaling Technology), 30% hydrogen peroxide, glucose oxidase, and catalase (Sigma-Aldrich), and OptiPrep (Axis-Shield) were purchased from the indicated companies. The sources of other reagents are indicated in the text. Cell Culture Preparation—Neonatal rat aorta SMCs were isolated and expanded as described (23Schreiber B.M. Martin B.M. Hollander W. Franzblau C. Atherosclerosis. 1988; 69: 69-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a density of 7.5 × 104 cell/ml in 2 ml of medium per well of a 6-well plate. Freshly isolated cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cell counting was carried out by hemocytometry in triplicate cultures using the trypan blue exclusion method. Wild-type and lox-/- embryos from heterozygous crosses were used to derive mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). E14.5 embryos were dissociated with sterile scissors, trypsinized, and transferred to 60-mm tissue culture dishes. After 2-3 days, cells were trypsinized and expanded as described (4Mäki J.M. Sormunen R. Lippo S. Kaarteenaho-Wiik R. Soininen R. Myllyharju J. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 167: 927-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Cells of the embryo rat aorta SMC line A7r5 (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured and expanded as described above for SMCs. Lysyl oxidase was purified from bovine aorta (24Kagan H.M. Cai P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Chemotaxis Assays—SMCs, MEFs, and A7r5 cells were grown from seeding to 80-90% confluence in the absence (control) or in the presence of 100 μm BAPN. The cell layers were rinsed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution. In some experiments, cells were further incubated with pure LOX (5 units/ml) for 30 min in a medium designed for optimal LOX activity and cell viability containing 5.5 mm glucose, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4 in PBS (pH 7.8). SMCs and A7r5 were starved for 24 h and MEFs for 6 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium serum-free medium containing 0.2% BSA with or without 100 μm BAPN, and washed three times in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cell layers were then harvested by incubation at 37 °C for 15 min in a medium containing 2 mm EDTA/Hanks' balanced salt solution, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 0.05% TrypZean, a recombinant bovine trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich), and then collected by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min. This harvesting procedure did not result in the degradation of PDGFR-β as judged by the expected apparent molecular masses of 180-185 kDa determined by Western blots using specific antibody (not shown). Sedimented cells were resuspended in an appropriate volume of quenching medium composed of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% BSA, 2 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm MgCl2, counted using Trypan blue to assess viability (>90%), and diluted to 1.0 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% BSA. Chemotaxis assays, performed in 96-well, 8-μm MultiScreen MIC plates (Millipore), were initiated immediately after cells were harvested, counted, and diluted. Plates and reagents were brought to room temperature (25 °C). Serum-free medium (150 μl) containing or lacking the designated chemoattractants was added to the wells of the feeder tray (lower plate). The cell migration plate (upper plate) was placed on the feeder tray, and 100 μl of serum-free medium containing 5 × 104 cells was added to each well. The mounted plate was covered and incubated for 1-3 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells and media from the migration plate were gently removed and discarded, and the migration plate was rinsed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution and placed onto a new feeder tray containing 150 μl of the cell detachment solution containing 0.25% TrypZean, 1 mm EDTA in Dubecco's PBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. During this time, the migration plate was gently lifted from and then reassembled onto the feeder tray to allow complete dislodging of the cells from the underside of the membrane. Finally, 100 μl taken from each well of the feeder tray was transferred to the corresponding wells of a new 96-well plate. Cell content in the wells was determined in a Tecan Infinite M200 microplate reader using the CyQuant NF cell proliferation kit assay (Invitrogen). Oxy-immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown in the wells of the Nunc Lab-Tek II CC2 Chamber Slide System to ∼80% confluence under the conditions as described herein, including the starvation in serum-free medium and washing steps. Cells were fixed in PBS containing 3% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, incubated for 10 min at room temperature in PBS containing 10 mm ammonium chloride to quench the excess of formaldehyde, and then washed twice with PBS. Carbonyl residues generated by the oxidative deamination of lysyl residues in cell surface proteins of cell monolayers were covalently derivatized with 1 ml/well of 1.5 mm dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in 0.5 m trifluoroacetic acid for 15 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. Cells not derivatized with DNPH were incubated in 0.5 m trifluoroacetic acid for 15 min at room temperature in the absence of DNPH. The DNPH solution was aspirated and 0.5 m Tris base (1 ml/well) was added to neutralize the residual trifluoroacetic acid. The fact that neither anti-core histone antibody nor rhodamine-phalloidin were able to bind to their target proteins when fixed cells were derivatized but not permeabilized (not shown) indicated that the acidic treatment of the fixed cell monolayer, under the conditions described above, did not result in cell permeabilization. Wells were rinsed two times with PBS, incubated for 2 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (PBS/3% BSA). The resulting dinitrophenyl adducts were reacted with anti-dinitrophenol antibodies (anti-DNP) in PBS/3% BSA buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. Wells were rinsed three times for 5 min each with PBS and then incubated with a 1/500 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody in PBS/3% BSA buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Fluorescent images were captured in a Nikon Eclipse E400 equipped with ocular lens CFIUW 10×/25 and objective lenses 40×/0.65 Ph2 DL and 20×/0.40 Ph1 DL, using a Spot RT KE digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) driven by the Spot imaging software V 4.6. Plasma Membrane Purification—Cultured cells were grown in 150 mm plates, rinsed and then harvested by gently scraping each plate in 5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), containing 1 μl/ml medium of protease inhibitor mixture for use with mammalian cell extracts (Sigma) and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The resulting cell suspension was left on ice for 15 min to allow swelling and then disrupted by 20 strokes in a 12 ml Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was subjected to zonal rate centrifugation twice for 5 min at 700 × g to sediment the nuclear fraction and cell debris. The post-nuclear supernatant (S700 × g) was either concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h or loaded directly onto a 6-40% OptiPrep (Iodixanol) gradient. When S700 × g was concentrated by ultracentrifugation, the supernatant (S150K × g) consisted of the cytoplasmic fraction while the pellet (P150K × g) was the total membrane fraction of the cells depleted of nuclear membranes. This P150K × g was then gently resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer and loaded onto a 6-40% OptiPrep gradient composed of 150 mm NaCl, Tricine-NaOH (pH 7.4), and 1 mm EDTA. A linear gradient was formed by overlaying 18 fractions (211 μl) of 40.0%, 38.0%, 36.0%, 34.0%, 32.0%, 30.0%, 28.0%, 26.0%, 24.0%, 22.0%, 20.0%, 18.0%, 16.0%, 14.0%, 12.0%, 10.0%, 8.0%, and 6.0% in a 4.3-ml tube of the SW 60Ti rotor. Equilibrium sedimentation of the sub-cellular membrane fraction P150K × g was achieved by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 130 min at 4 °C. Twenty fractions (215 μl) from the top of the tube were collected in new tubes. The refractive index of each fraction (50 μl) was determined using a digital display refractometer, and the corresponding density, ρ, was calculated from ρ = (η × A) - B, where η is the refractive index and the constant values used, A = 3.344 and B = 3.458, are for an OptiPrep gradient in NaCl/Tricine solution. To identify the actual sedimentation density of the PM fraction in the gradient, SMC surface proteins were biotinylated as follows: rinsed cell monolayers in 150-mm plates were incubated in 5 ml of biotinylation buffer (1 mg/ml biotin (Pierce), 10 mm triethanolamine (pH 8.3), and 150 mm NaCl), and incubated for 25-30 min at 4 °C to prevent endocytosis. Plates were rinsed three times with PBS, and the excess biotin was quenched by incubation in 5 ml of quenching buffer (100 mm glycine (pH 8.3) in PBS) for an additional 15 min at 4 °C. Surface biotinylated cells were then subjected to lysis, zonal rate centrifugation, and equilibrium sedimentation in an OptiPrep gradient as described above. Western blot analysis using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen) to probe gradient fractions revealed that plasma membranes sedimented at a density of 1.065 ± 0.021 g/ml corresponding to fractions 6 (8% Opti-Prep) to 10 (16% OptiPrep) withdrawn from the top of the tube. Alternatively, plasma membranes were recovered after equilibrium sedimentation in the 6-18% interface of a stepwise gradient consisting of 6%, 18%, and 30% OptiPrep layers. Ten 150-mm plates were processed to obtain 100-150 μg of purified plasma membrane, free of antigenic signals toward anti-Sec61β (ER marker), anti-syntaxin 6 (Golgi marker), and anti-histone H1 (nucleus marker) (not shown). Detection of oxidized proteins in solution was done using an oxy-blot protein oxidation detection kit (Chemicon International) following the manufacturer's instructions. Enzyme Assays and Immunoprecipitation—Lysyl oxidase and glucose oxidase activities were determined fluorometrically by monitoring the production of H2O2 through the oxidation of Amplex Red (Invitrogen) as described for lysyl oxidase activity (25Palamakumbura A.H. Trackman P.C. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 300: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) with modification. The substrate used for lysyl oxidase was a synthetic lysine:tyrosine (4:1) heteropolymer present at 5 μg/ml in the assay mixture. Glucose oxidase activity was measured in PBS containing 5 mm glucose. One unit of activity of either enzyme is the amount of enzyme required to produce 50 pmol of H2O2/min. The kinetics of fluorescence change was monitored using a TECAN Infinite M200 microplate reader. PDGFR-β was immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against rat PDGFR-β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using a protein A/G-agarose immunoprecipitation kit (KPL) following the manufacturer's instructions. Iodination of PDGF-BB and Binding of 125I-PDGF-BB to Cell Monolayers—PDGF-BB was iodinated using the Bolton-Hunter reagent (26Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of freeze-dried, recombinant rat, carrier-free PDGF-BB (R&D Systems) was resuspended in 50 μl of 100 mm sodium borate, pH 8.5, and added to 125I-Monoiodo Bolton-Hunter reagent (1000 μCi) that had been dried under nitrogen and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. 200 μl of quenching solution (0.1 m sodium borate, pH 8.5, and 0.2 m glycine) was added and the mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min at 4 °C followed by the addition of 50 μl of 100 mm sodium borate containing 5 mg/ml BSA. Two 5-μl aliquots of the mixture were used to assess the efficiency of iodination, and the remaining 295 μl was loaded onto a D-Salt polyacrylamide desalting column (6-kDa cut-off, Pierce) that had been equilibrated in 100 mm acetic acid containing 1 mg/ml BSA. Fractions of 500 μl were collected and 125I-PDGF-BB eluted in the first peak of radioactivity (fractions 4th to 6th) with a specific radioactivity of 25,000 cpm/ng. Binding of 125I-PDGF-BB was measured in monolayers of cells grown in 24-well cluster culture plates. Cells were seeded on the plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well, grown to near confluence, starved in serum-free medium for 48 h, washed three times with cold binding buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mm CaCl2, containing 2 mg/ml BSA) and incubated in 1 ml of binding buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. The binding buffer was aspirated, and 1 ml of fresh binding buffer containing the indicated concentrations of 125I-PDGF-BB at a specific radioactivity of 88,000 cpm/ng was added and further incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. After washing four times with 1 ml of binding buffer at 4 °C, cells were solubilized with 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml BSA. Radioactivity was measured in a gamma counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of unlabeled PDGF-BB at 500 ng/ml. Specific binding was obtained by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the total binding. The dissociation constant (Kd) and the maximum binding capacity (Bmax) for 125I-PDGF-BB were determined by least-squares, non-linear regression fitting of the hyperbolic function for ligand binding to one site saturation. Cell numbers were determined in triplicate parallel cultures by trypsinization and counting the detached cells in a hemocytometer. PDGF-BB Signal Transduction Pathway—Activation of SHP2, Akt, and ERK1/ERK2 (p44/42 MAPK), assessed as downstream components of PDGFR-β in response to PDGF-BB binding, was assayed in cell monolayers by monitoring their phosphorylated state using specific anti-phosphoprotein antibodies. Cells grown on 6-well plates were incubated for 24 h (SMC and A7r5) or for 6 h (MEF) in serum-free medium and then stimulated with PDGF-BB (25 ng/ml) for the indicated times at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The reaction was stopped by aspirating the media, and cells were immediately lysed with 200 μl/well extraction buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were saved. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) using BSA as the standard. To assess phosphorylation of SHP2, Akt, and ERK1/ERK2 (p44/42 MAPK) and PDGFR-β, total protein extracts (30 μg/lane) were separated by 4.0-20.0% gradient SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol using a Mini Trans-Blot blotter (Bio-Rad) at 30 V overnight and under continuous cooling at 4 °C. Blots were blocked in PBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% w/v nonfat dry milk for 1 h and then incubated overnight with gentle agitation at 4 °C with a mixture of the anti-phosphoprotein antibodies, anti-P-SHP2, anti-P-Akt, anti-P-ERK1/ERK2(p44/42 MAPK), and anti-P-PDGFR-β, each diluted 1/1000 in PBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% w/v BSA. Membranes were washed three times for 5 min each with PBS/T buffer and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, goat anti-rabbit-IgG antibody (1:2000) in PBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% w/v BSA. After washing four times for 10 min each with PBS/T, membranes were developed with a chemiluminescence substrate for detection of horseradish peroxidase (Pierce), and images were captured in a Chemi Doc XRS imager (Bio-Rad) using the Quantity One v 4.6 imaging software. Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the cells in 4 m guanidinium thiocyanate as described previously (27Wolfe L.B. Rich C.B. Go"
https://openalex.org/W2023258833,"Mutated in colorectal cancer (MCC) was originally identified as a candidate gene for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) but further study identified adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) as responsible for FAP and the physiologic/pathologic roles of MCC remained poorly understood. Recently, MCC promoter methylation was discovered as a frequent early event in a distinct subset of precursor lesions and colorectal cancer (CRC) associated with the serrated CRC pathway. Here we provide the first evidence of the biological significance of MCC loss in CRC and the molecular pathways involved. We show MCC expression is dramatically decreased in many CRC cell lines and the distinct subset of sporadic CRC characterized by the CpG island methylator phenotype and BRAFV600E mutation due to promoter methylation as reported previously. Importantly, we find MCC interacts with β-catenin and that reexpression of MCC in CRC cells specifically inhibits Wnt signaling, β-catenin/T-cell factor/lymphoid-enhancer factor-dependent transcription and cellular proliferation even in the presence of oncogenic mutant APC. We also show that MCC is localized in the nucleus and identify two functional nuclear localization signals. Taken together, MCC is a nuclear, β-catenin-interacting protein that can act as a potential tumor suppressor in the serrated CRC pathway by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2167159137,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are among the fundamental molecules that alert the immune system to the presence of an infection by recognizing pathogen-associated molecules. Much of our understanding regarding TLR function stems from the study of innate immune cells. Recent studies by several groups, including ours, have shown that TLRs can function as costimulatory receptors for antigen-specific T cells, resulting in enhanced T-cell survival and increased expression of effector molecules. We report that the ligation of the TLR1/2 heterodimer on OT-1 cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) but not TLR2(-/-)OT-1 T cells increased cytolytic activity in vitro and in vivo. On the basis of these data, we tested the hypothesis that TLR1/2 stimulation on CTLs would enhance antitumor activity in a therapeutic model of B16-Ova melanoma. Adoptive OT-1 T-cell transfer into wild-type and MyD88(-/-) mice, followed by injection with TLR1/2 ligand, resulted in a synergistic antitumor effect, which correlated with the induction of CD8 T cells specific to various tumor antigens. In contrast, mice receiving TLR2(-/-)OT-1 T cells and TLR1/2 ligand showed minimal therapeutic efficacy. These findings emphasize the physiological significance of TLR2 engagement on CTLs and could make possible new approaches for the development of effective immunotherapies by manipulating TLR signaling within CTLs."

It plays a key role in the regulation of transmethylation reactions in all eukaryotic organisms by catalyzing the degradation of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy), the potent product inhibitor of AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases (see Fig. 1) (3Wolfe M.S.

Thus, by regulating AdoHcy levels in the cell, Sah1 activity has pleiotropic effects on gene expression, signal transduction, and lipid biosynthesis. In addition, the Sah1-catalyzed reaction is reversible, adding to the regulatory complexity of trans-methylation reactions. Whereas in vitro the equilibrium of the Sah1 reaction is in the biosynthetic direction to form AdoHcy from adenosine and homocysteine (10De La Haba G. Cantoni G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 603-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), quick metabolization of adenosine to ATP and inosine and homocysteine to methionine and cysteine and subsequently, glutathione, favors the catabolic direction of the reaction in vivo (11Hoffman D.R. Marion D.W. Cornatzer W.E. Duerre J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10822-10827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in vivo accumulation of homocysteine and/or adenosine favors the bio-synthetic reaction, resulting in AdoHcy accumulation under these conditions (12Isa Y. Mishima T. Tsuge H. Hayakawa T.

Many pathological disease states have been related to altered Sah1 function.

Mice deficient in methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase, necessary for homocysteine to methionine remethylation, exhibit hyperhomocysteinemia and decreased methylation capacity along with neuropathology and aortic lipid deposition (17Chen Z.

Complete loss of Sah1 function in mammals is deleterious for growth and development; deletion of the SAH1 locus is embryonic lethal in mice (21Miller M.W. Duhl D.M. Winkes B.M. Arredondo-Vega F.

However, recently patients deficient in Sah1 and exhibiting only 3-20% of mean control Sah1 activity were identified that displayed severe myopathy and mental retardation (22Buist N.R. Glenn B.

Conflicting results exist as to the essential function of Sah1 in yeast (see below). In addition to AdoHcy catabolism, Sah1 plays an important role both in mammals and yeast in homocysteine production, which is required for cysteine and glutathione synthesis (25Finkelstein J.D. J. Nutr. 2006; 136: 1750-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mendoza-Cozatl D. Loza-Tavera H. Hernandez-Navarro A. Moreno-Sanchez R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 653-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Whereas in mammalian cells homocysteine is produced exclusively by Sah1, yeast possesses an additional option to synthesize homocysteine through the sulfur assimilation pathway that allows it to utilize sulfate as a source of sulfur (Fig. 1) (27Hansen J. Johannesen P.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 28Breton A. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 132: 224-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). In yeast as in mammalian cells the major membrane phospholipid, PC, is synthesized either de novo by sequential methylation of PE by AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases (Cho2 and Opi3 in yeast) or via the Kennedy pathway from diacylglycerol (DG) and CDP-activated choline (9Vance D.E. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5430-5435Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 30Vance J.E. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 31de Kroon A.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although in yeast PC de novo synthesis is the dominating pathway, in mammals only 30% of total hepatic PC is synthesized by PE methylation de novo (9Vance D.E. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5430-5435Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, phospholipid methylation in mammals appears to be a major AdoMet-consuming pathway, since hepatic PC de novo synthesis is responsible for about 50% of plasma homocysteine levels (32Stead L.M. Brosnan J.T. Brosnan M.E. Vance D.E. Jacobs R.L. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2006; 83: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the highest Sah1 activity levels were detected in liver (21Miller M.W. Duhl D.M. Winkes B.M. Arredondo-Vega F. Saxon P.J. Wolff G.L. Epstein C.J. Hershfield M.S. Barsh G.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1806-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that SAH1 transcription in yeast is regulated in response to the lipid precursors, inositol and choline, and is coordinated with genes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis (2Tehlivets O. Hasslacher M. Kohlwein S.D. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This transcriptional regulation requires two transcriptional activators Ino2/Ino4 as well as the repressor Opi1 and is dependent on the phospholipid metabolite, phosphatidic acid (PA), in the endoplasmic reticulum (33Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Ino2/Ino4 bind as heterodimeric activation complex to UASINO sequences present in the 5′ regions of all phospholipid biosynthetic genes (34Chen M. Hancock L.C. Lopes J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 35Bachhawat N. Ouyang Q. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25087-25095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the absence of lipid precursors, Opi1, which may interact with Ino2 in the nucleus to block transcription, is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum by binding to PA (33Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The presence of inositol leads to rapid consumption of PA pools in the ER and subsequent translocation of Opi1 into the nucleus to repress Ino2/Ino4-dependent transcription (33Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 36Gaspar M.L. Aregullin M.A. Jesch S.A. Nunez L.R. Villa-Garcia M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 24070-24083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Defective PE to PC methylation in cho2 or opi3 mutants leads to PA accumulation and, accordingly, to derepression of phospholipid biosynthetic genes, in particular INO1, which encodes inositol 3-phosphate synthase, the most highly regulated gene in this regulatory circuit (38Henry S.A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 133-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Carman G.M. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37293-37297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Depletion of Sah1 activity in yeast results in massive accumulation of lipid droplets and triacylglycerols during logarithmic growth (2Tehlivets O. Hasslacher M. Kohlwein S.D. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we show for the first time that Sah1 activity controls PC synthesis in yeast and that a decreased PC de novo synthesis both in Sah1-depleted cells and in cho2 and opi3 mutants defective in PE to PC methylation is accompanied by an increase in triacylglycerol levels. Reduction of Sah1 activity leads to deregulated INO1 expression, comparable with that observed in cho2 and opi3 mutants. Furthermore, homocysteine supplementation leads to AdoHcy accumulation through the Sah1-catalyzed reaction in vivo and, subsequently, inhibition of PE methylation and TG accumulation. We also show that the sulfur assimilation pathway in yeast is essential for survival in the absence of Sah1. These data demonstrate that Sah1 is not only important for regulating AdoMet-dependent methyl transfer reactions. It is also essential for providing homocysteine as a precursor for cysteine and glutathione synthesis in the absence of sulfur assimilation, which is lacking in mammalian cells. Taken together, Sah1 activity has a major impact on cellular lipid homeostasis, and its deficiency results in dysregulated lipid metabolism, leading to an imbalance of phospholipid and triacylglycerol synthesis, with implications for mammalian lipid-associated disorders. Strains and Culture Conditions—The strains used in this study, except for the AID strain, are derived from the BX back-ground and are listed in Table 1. The tetO7-SAH1 strain, expressing SAH1 under control of the heterologous tetO7 promoter, was obtained from Open Biosystems. Precultures were grown in YPD complete media containing 10 g/liter yeast extract (Difco), 20 g/liter peptone (Difco), and 20 g/liter glucose (Merck) or in minimal SD media containing 6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 20 g/liter glucose (Merck) and supplemented with amino acids and bases as described (2Tehlivets O. Hasslacher M. Kohlwein S.D. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Synthetic, inositol- and choline-free media that also lacked threonine (-I/-C/-threo) contained 10% glucose (40Jesch S.A. Zhao X. Wells M.T. Henry S.A. J. Biol.

Where indicated, methionine (20 μg/ml), cysteine (0.1 mm), inositol (80 μm), choline (1 mm), and homocysteine (1 mm) were added. Deuterated homocysteine (d4-Hcy, CDN Isotopes, Quebec, Canada) was added to the -I/-C/-threo medium at 1 mm. For repression of SAH1 expression under control of the tetO7 promoter, doxycycline was added at concentrations ranging from 0 to 50 μg/ml, as indicated. Media were solidified by the addition of 20 g/liter agar.TABLE 1Strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceYNM1MATa his3Δ1 met25Δ0 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 lys2Δ0Laboratory strainYNM8MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 lys2Δ0This studyYNM9MATa his3-1 leu2-0 pSAH1::kanR-tet07-TATA URA3::CMV-tTAThis studyYNM2MATa his3-1 leu2-0 met25-0 pSAH1::kanR-tet07-TATA URA3::CMV-tTAOpen BiosystemsYNM3MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met25Δ0 ura3Δ0 cho2::kanMX4EuroscarfYNM4MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met25Δ0 ura3Δ0 opi3::kanMX4EuroscarfYNM5MATa his3Δ1 met25Δ0 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 lys2Δ0 met6::kanMX4 str4::kanMX4This studyYNM6MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 lys2Δ0 met6::kanMX4 str4::kanMX4This studyYNM7MATa/α; his3Δ1/his3Δ1 leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0/LYS2 MET25/met25Δ0 ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0 sah 1::kanMX4/SAH1EuroscarfYNM10MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 lys2Δ0 pUG36[Opil-GFP]This studyYNM11MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 lys2Δ0 sah 1::kanMX4 pUG36[Opil-GFP]This studyAIDMATa/α ade1/ade1 ino1-13/ino1-13S.A. Henry Open table in a new tab Cloning of the MET25 Gene and Repair of the met25 Mutation—The MET25 wild type gene was amplified from BY4742 genomic DNA by PCR using 5′-ACTAATTAAGTTAGTCAAGGCGCCA-3′ and 5′-TCATTACGCACACTCATGGTTTTT-3′ primers and Tag DNA polymerase (Fermentas) following standard procedures. The obtained 2.7-kilobase MET25 fragment was transformed into yeast strains YNM1 and YNM2 (both met25) by the method of Gietz (41Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A.

Correct integration at the MET25 locus and methionine prototrophy of the resultant transformants was confirmed by colony PCR and growth tests on media plates lacking methionine, respectively. AdoHcy Quantification—AdoHcy was extracted by the method of Gellekink (42Gellekink H. van Oppenraaij-Emmerzaal D. van Rooij A. Struys E.A. den Heijer M. Blom H.J. Clin.

Yeast cells were grown overnight in 5 ml of YPD at 30 °C with shaking, inoculated in 100 ml of YPD medium to A600 = 0.1, and grown for additional 72 h. Cells were washed with sterile water and inoculated to A600 = 0.025 in -I/-C/-threo medium with or without supplements as indicated. Over a period of 25 h samples were collected, stored at -70 °C, or processed immediately. For AdoHcy extraction 100 A600 units of yeast cells were harvested, resuspended in 5 ml of 0.091 m acetic acid, and broken with glass beads in a Mercken-schlager homogenizer (Braun Bio-tech International) under CO2 cooling. The supernatant was separated from glass beads by centrifugation. 15 nmol of d3-AdoMet (CDN Isotopes) were added as internal standard to every sample before solid-phase extraction (SPE) on Bond Elut PBA columns (Varian Inc.) (42Gellekink H. van Oppenraaij-Emmerzaal D. van Rooij A. Struys E.A. den Heijer M. Blom H.J. Clin. Chem. 2005; 51: 1487-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). AdoHcy was separated by HPLC (Rheos 2000 pump, Flux Instruments, Basel, Switzerland) using an ACE®3 C18 column (100 × 2.1 mm, Advanced Chromatography Technologies, Aberdeen, UK). The gradient started from 96% solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and increased to 100% solvent B (acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) over 9 min at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. AdoHcy concentration was measured on an LCQ Duo Ion Trap mass spectrometer (Thermo, San Jose, CA) using MS/MS-Scans for m/z 385 (AdoHcy), 389 (d4-AdoHcy) and 402 (d3-AdoMet) and with a TSQ-7000 Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometer performing the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) scans for m/z 385→136 (AdoHcy), m/z 389→136 (d4-AdoHcy), and m/z 402→136 (d3-AdoMet). Calibration curves of AdoMet and AdoHcy (Sigma Aldrich) in the range of 1 to 50 μm were used for quantification. Lipid Analysis—Yeast lipids were extracted by the Folch method (43Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 A600 units of yeast cells grown under identical conditions as used for AdoHcy extraction (see above) were harvested and broken with glass beads in a Mercken-schlager homogenizer (Braun Biotech International) under CO2 cooling. Lipids were extracted using chloroform/methanol 2:1 (v/v). Samples were applied onto silica gel TLC plates (Merck) with an automated sampler (Camag Automatic TLC Sampler 4). Total lipids were separated using light petroleum/diethyl ether/acetic acid 32:8:0.4 (v/v/v). Triacylglycerols and total phospholipids were visualized by carbonization and quantified by densitometric scanning as described (44Schneiter R. Daum G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313: 75-84PubMed Google Scholar) using triolein as the standard. Phospholipid composition was analyzed by normal-phase HPLC using a YMC-Pack™ Diol column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) on an Agilent 1100 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, GER) equipped with an evaporative light scattering detector (PL-ELS 1000, Polymer Labs, Amherst, MA). The gradient was based on a previously reported method (45Sas B. Peys E. Helsen M. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 864: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and changed from acetone to acetone/methanol (46.2/53.8 v/v) in the presence of hexane (7 volume %), acetic acid (1.9%), and triethylamine (1.6%) over 32 min at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Quantification of phospholipids was achieved by external standardization using lipid standards from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). RNA Isolation and Real Time PCR—An overnight culture grown in minimal medium was inoculated to A600 = 0.05 in -I/-C/-threo synthetic medium with or without doxycycline supplementation and grown for 6 h at 30°C under shaking. RNA was prepared using SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega). 1 μg of total RNA was converted into cDNA using Superscript™ reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Expression of SAH1 (primers 5′-CCGAAGTTACCTGGTCCTCTTTGA-3′ and 5′-ACCGGAAGCGGCAATAGC-3′ and TagMan probe 5′-CGACTCAAGATCATGCCGCCGC-3′) and INO1 genes (primers 5′-GGAATGACGTTTATGCTCCTTTTAA-3′ and 5′-GTCCCAACCAGAGACGACAAA-3′ and TagMan probe 5′-CTGTTGCCCATGGTTAGCCCAAACG-3′) was measured by real time PCR using Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and normalized to ACT1 (primers 5′-CGCCTTGGACTTCGAACAAG-3′ and 5′-GACCATCTGGAAGTTCGTAGGATT-3′ and TagMan probe 5′-TGCAAACCGCTGCTCAATCTTCTTCAAT-3′). Calculation of relative expression was according to the suppliers' protocol. Opi Test—The test for Opi phenotype was performed as described previously with minor modifications (46Greenberg M.L. Goldwasser P. Henry S.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 186: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 47McGee T.P. Skinner H.B. Bankaitis V.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6861-6868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, strains were grown overnight in minimal medium, and 5-μl aliquots of A600 = 1 dilutions each were spotted onto -I/-C/-threo plates with or without doxycycline supplementation as indicated. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24 h and sprayed with a suspension of an inositol auxotrophic tester strain (AID). Secretion of inositol resulting in a growth ring of the tester strain around the spotted cultures was scored after further incubation for 24-48 h at 30 °C. Microscopic Analysis of Opi1-GFP Localization—Wild type and sah1 mutant cells expressing C-terminal GFP-tagged Opi1 from plasmid pUG36 (48Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) were grown overnight in minimal SD media lacking uracil. Before microscopy, cells were inoculated into fresh -I/-C/-ura media containing 2 μg/ml methionine and 1 mm cysteine (see above) and sequentially re-inoculated in 3 cycles (8-12 h each) to obtain a logarithmically growing cell population with homogeneous Opi1-GFP expression. GFP fluorescence was analyzed on a Leica TCS4d confocal microscope with 488-nm excitation and 525/50-nm band pass filter detection. Quantitative image analysis was performed using Image J software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). Briefly, GFP fluorescence intensity profiles were calculated along a linear axis through the cell, normalized, and plotted (see also Fig. 6C). Intensity maxima (±S.D.), corresponding to the nuclear rim/ER, were correlated to intensity values inside and outside the nucleus, from at least 20 cells/nuclei in each preparation. Sah1 Is Essential in Yeast in the Absence of Sulfur Assimilation—Previous studies have yielded ambiguous results as to an essential function of Sah1 in yeast. To address the reported discrepancies and to generate a conditional system that allowed systematic studies of the impact of Sah1 on lipid metabolism, we made use of a strain expressing SAH1 under control of the doxycycline-regulatable tetO7 promoter (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, expression of SAH1 in strain YNM2 (tet07SAH1 met25), as determined by real time PCR, was elevated compared with wild type during growth without doxycycline supplementation, consistent with previous results showing that the tetO7 promoter is rather strong in the absence of repressor. However, SAH1 expression was strongly dependent on the doxycycline concentration and was completely abolished in the presence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline in the medium. This concentration was also sufficient to fully inhibit growth of strain YNM2 (Fig. 2C). The addition of cysteine or homocysteine only marginally restored growth of this strain in the presence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline; however, it indicated to us that the essential function of Sah1 may be related to methionine or cysteine homeostasis. Indeed, MATa strains of the Euroscarf collection (and strains from the tetO7 promoter replacement collection) contain a mutation in the MET25 gene, encoding O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase, which renders the sulfur assimilation pathway inactive (49Thomas D. Barbey R. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15518-15524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because in yeast sulfur assimilation is an integral part of homocysteine and methionine homeostasis, we have repaired the met25 deletion in strain YNM2 by replacing the mutated allele with the MET25 wild type gene. Indeed, the addition of doxycycline to the medium did not affect the growth of strain YNM9 (tet07SAH1 MET25), demonstrating that Sah1 is only essential in the absence of Met25. To analyze this further, we have subjected strain YNM7 heterozygous for sah1 and met25 mutations (sah1/SAH1 met25/MET25) to tetrad analysis (Fig. 2D). On methionine-containing plates, the resulting progeny developed either big (MET25 or met25), medium size (sah1 MET25), or very small (sah1 met25) colonies. Supplementation of either homocysteine or cysteine in combination with methionine, but not methionine alone, supported slow growth of sah1 or sah1 met25 deletion strains (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data demonstrate that (i) Sah1 is not an essential enzyme and is only indispensable for the yeast cell in the absence of sulfur assimilation and (ii) elimination of Sah1 function results in strongly reduced growth that cannot be completely rescued by amino acid supplementation, as a consequence of lacking AdoHcy catabolism. Because sulfur assimilation is a"

In the current study, we examined the role of complement C3 and C5 in sepsis in wild-type and C3- or C5-deficient mice induced by cecal ligation and puncture. When compared to wild-type mice, C5(-/-) showed identical survival, and C3(-/-) presented significantly reduced survival. Interestingly, this was associated with significant decreases in plasma levels of proinflammatory mediators. Moreover, although septic C3(-/-) animals displayed a 10-fold increase of blood-borne bacteria, C5(-/-) animals exhibited a 400-fold increase in bacteremia when compared to wild-type mice. These effects were linked to the inability of C5(-/-) mice to assemble the terminal membrane attack complex (MAC), as determined by complement hemolytic activity (CH-50). Surprisingly, although negative control C3(-/-) mice failed to generate the MAC, significant increases of MAC formation was found in septic C3(-/-) mice. In conclusion, our data corroborate that hemolytic complement activity is essential for control of bacteremia in septic mice. Thus, during sepsis, blockade of C5a or its receptors (rather than C5) seems a more promising strategy, because C5a-blockade still allows for MAC formation while the adverse effects of C5a are prevented."
https://openalex.org/W2004451606,"Expression of the genes for resistance to heavy metals and metalloids is transcriptionally regulated by the toxic ions themselves. Members of the ArsR/SmtB family of small metalloregulatory proteins respond to transition metals, heavy metals, and metalloids, including As(III), Sb(III), Cd(II), Pb(II), Zn(II), Co(II), and Ni(II). These homodimeric repressors bind to DNA in the absence of inducing metal(loid) ion and dissociate from the DNA when inducer is bound. The regulatory sites are often three- or four-coordinate metal binding sites composed of cysteine thiolates. Surprisingly, in two different As(III)-responsive regulators, the metalloid binding sites were in different locations in the repressor, and the Cd(II) binding sites were in two different locations in two Cd(II)-responsive regulators. We hypothesize that ArsR/SmtB repressors have a common backbone structure, that of a winged helix DNA-binding protein, but have considerable plasticity in the location of inducer binding sites. Here we show that an As(III)-responsive member of the family, CgArsR1 from Corynebacterium glutamicum, binds As(III) to a cysteine triad composed of Cys(15), Cys(16), and Cys(55). This binding site is clearly unrelated to the binding sites of other characterized ArsR/SmtB family members. This is consistent with our hypothesis that metal(loid) binding sites in DNA binding proteins evolve convergently in response to persistent environmental pressures."

Because the role of T(reg) impairments in multiple sclerosis (MS) is still contradictory, we analyzed naive PD1- and PD1+ T(reg) cells in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS) patients and of healthy control subjects. Results showed that 1) CSF PD1- T(reg) cells were significantly augmented in MS patients; 2) PD1- T(reg) cells were significantly increased in the peripheral blood of patients with stable disease (SMS) compared to those with acute (AMS) disease, and in patients responding to glatiramer acetate (COPA) compared to AMS- and COPA-unresponsive patients; and 3) PD1+ T(reg) cells were similar in CSF and peripheral blood of all groups analyzed. PD1- T(reg) cells were not increased in the peripheral blood of interferon-beta (IFNbeta) -responsive patients, but the suppressive ability of T(reg) cells was significantly higher in SMS and in COPA- or IFNbeta-responsive compared to AMS- and COPA-unresponsive individuals.

In this study, we examined the expression and significance of components within the 5-LO pathway in human neuroblastoma, an embryonal tumor of the sympathetic nervous system. High expression of 5-LO, 5-LO-activating protein (FLAP), leukotriene A(4) hydrolase, leukotriene C(4) synthase, and leukotriene receptors was detected in a majority of primary neuroblastoma tumors and all cell lines investigated. Expression of 5-LO and FLAP was evident in tumor cells but not in nonmalignant adrenal medulla where neuroblastomas typically arise. Moreover, neuroblastoma cells produce leukotrienes, and stimulation of neuroblastoma cells with leukotrienes increased neuroblastoma cell viability. Inhibitors of 5-LO (AA-861), FLAP (MK-886), or the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast inhibited neuroblastoma cell growth by induction of G(1)-cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Similarly, specific 5-LO and leukotriene receptor silencing by small interfering RNA decreased neuroblastoma cell growth. These findings provide new insights into the pathobiology of neuroblastoma, and the use of leukotriene pathway inhibitors as a novel adjuvant therapy for children with neuroblastoma warrants further consideration."
https://openalex.org/W2057230845,"The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor is a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of Wnt signalling and cytoskeletal dynamics. Little is known about how APC controls these disparate functions. In this study, we have used APC- and axin-fluorescent fusion proteins to examine the interactions between these proteins and show that the functionally distinct populations of APC are also spatially separate. Axin-RFP forms cytoplasmic punctate structures, similar to endogenous axin puncta. Axin-RFP recruits β-catenin destruction complex proteins, including APC, β-catenin, glycogen synthase kinase-3-β (GSK3-β) and casein kinase-1-α (CK1-α). Recruitment into axin-RFP puncta sequesters APC from clusters at cell extensions and this prevents its microtubule-associated functions. The interaction between APC-GFP and axin-RFP within the cytoplasmic puncta is direct and dramatically alters the dynamic properties of APC-GFP. However, recruitment of APC to axin puncta is not absolutely required for β-catenin degradation. Instead, formation of axin puncta, mediated by the DIX domain, is required for β-catenin degradation. An axinΔDIX mutant did not form puncta, but still mediated recruitment of destruction complex proteins and phosphorylation of β-catenin. We conclude that there are distinct pools of APC and that the formation of axin puncta, rather than the axin/APC complex, is essential for β-catenin destruction."
https://openalex.org/W2008247190,"REV1, a Y family DNA polymerase (pol), is involved in replicative bypass past DNA lesions, so-called translesion DNA synthesis. In addition to a structural role as a scaffold protein, REV1 has been proposed to play a catalytic role as a dCTP transferase in translesion DNA synthesis past abasic and guanine lesions in eukaryotes. To better understand the catalytic function of REV1 in guanine lesion bypass, purified recombinant human REV1 was studied with two series of guanine lesions, N(2)-alkylG adducts (in oligonucleotides) ranging in size from methyl (Me) to CH(2)(6-benzo[a]pyrenyl) (BP) and O(6)-alkylG adducts ranging from Me to 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)butyl (Pob). REV1 readily produced 1-base incorporation opposite G and all G adducts except for O(6)-PobG, which caused almost complete blockage. Steady-state kinetic parameters (k(cat)/K(m)) were similar for insertion of dCTP opposite G and N(2)-G adducts but were severely reduced opposite the O(6)-G adducts. REV1 showed apparent pre-steady-state burst kinetics for dCTP incorporation only opposite N(2)-BPG and little, if any, opposite G, N(2)-benzyl (Bz)G, or O(6)-BzG. The maximal polymerization rate (k(pol) 0.9 s(-1)) opposite N(2)-BPG was almost the same as opposite G, with only slightly decreased binding affinity to dCTP (2.5-fold). REV1 bound N(2)-BPG-adducted DNA 3-fold more tightly than unmodified G-containing DNA. These results and the lack of an elemental effect ((S(p))-2'-deoxycytidine 5'-O-(1-thiotriphosphate)) suggest that the late steps after product formation (possibly product release) become rate-limiting in catalysis opposite N(2)-BPG. We conclude that human REV1, apparently the slowest Y family polymerase, is kinetically highly tolerant to N(2)-adduct at G but not to O(6)-adducts."
https://openalex.org/W1993019336,"Vibrio cholerae secretes a large virulence-associated multifunctional autoprocessing RTX toxin (MARTX(Vc)). Autoprocessing of this toxin by an embedded cysteine protease domain (CPD) is essential for this toxin to induce actin depolymerization in a broad range of cell types. A homologous CPD is also present in the large clostridial toxin TcdB and recent studies showed that inositol hexakisphosphate (Ins(1,2,3,4,5,6)P(6) or InsP(6)) stimulated the autoprocessing of TcdB dependent upon the CPD (Egerer, M., Giesemann, T., Jank, T., Satchell, K. J., and Aktories, K. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 25314-25321). In this work, the autoprocessing activity of the CPD within MARTX(Vc) is similarly found to be inducible by InsP(6). The CPD is shown to bind InsP(6) (K(d), 0.6 microm), and InsP(6) is shown to stimulate intramolecular autoprocessing at both physiological concentrations and as low as 0.01 microm. Processed CPD did not bind InsP(6) indicating that, subsequent to cleavage, the activated CPD may shift to an inactive conformation. To further pursue the mechanism of autoprocessing, conserved residues among 24 identified CPDs were mutagenized. In addition to cysteine and histidine residues that form the catalytic site, 2 lysine residues essential for InsP(6) binding and 5 lysine and arginine residues resulting in loss of activity at low InsP(6) concentrations were identified. Overall, our data support a model in which basic residues located across the CPD structure form an InsP(6) binding pocket and that the binding of InsP(6) stimulates processing by altering the CPD to an activated conformation. After processing, InsP(6) is shown to be recycled, while the cleaved CPD becomes incapable of further binding of InsP(6)."
https://openalex.org/W1973222341,"Phosphatidylethanolamine is a major phospholipid class of all eukaryotic cells. It can be synthesized via the CDP-ethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway, by decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine, or by base exchange with phosphatidylserine. The contributions of these pathways to total phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis have remained unclear. Although Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human and animal trypanosomiasis, has served as a model organism to elucidate the entire reaction sequence for glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis, the pathways for the synthesis of the major phospholipid classes have received little attention. We now show that disruption of the CDP-ethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway using RNA interference results in dramatic changes in phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylcholine. By targeting individual enzymes of the pathway, we demonstrate that de novo phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis in T. brucei procyclic forms is strictly dependent on the CDP-ethanolamine route. Interestingly, the last step in the Kennedy pathway can be mediated by two separate activities leading to two distinct pools of phosphatidylethanolamine, consisting of predominantly alk-1-enyl-acyl- or diacyl-type molecular species. In addition, we show that phosphatidylserine in T. brucei procyclic forms is synthesized exclusively by base exchange with phosphatidylethanolamine."

However, abnormal telomere signals and telomere elongation phenotypes were either not rescued or only partially rescued, respectively.

Immunoprecipitation—Cells were harvested and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). After incubation on ice for 30 min, an equal volume of cold-water was added and mixed. The treated samples were centrifuged, and supernatants were collected as total cell extracts. Extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2, Sigma) and immunoblotted with anti-mTIN2 antibody (a kind gift of Sahn-Ho Kim). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay was performed as described previously (11Iwano T. Tachibana M. Reth M. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1442-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cross-linked cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-mTRF2 antibody. The immuno-DNA complexes were collected by protein G-coupled Sepharose beads, then incubated at 65 °C overnight to reverse the cross-linking and treated with proteinase K to remove the mTRF2 protein. The remaining mTRF2-associated ChIP DNA was slot-blotted and hybridized with 32P-labeled (CCCTAA)4 probe. Autoradiogram signals were quantified with BAS 5000. Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) and Immuno-FISH Analysis—FISH assay was performed as described previously (11Iwano T. Tachibana M. Reth M. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1442-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Colcemid-treated cells were harvested and incubated in 0.03 mm sodium citrate and fixed with calnoy solution (MeOH: acetic acid = 3:1). Metaphase cells were spread out and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, treated with 1 mg/ml pepsin, and fixed again. Slides were dehydrated with 70, 90, and 100% EtOH. The Cy3-Telomere peptide nucleic acid probe (0.5 ng/ml) was mounted on the slides, heated for 3 min at 80 °C, and incubated at room temperature. Slides were washed in solution I (70% formamide, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and TBS-T and dehydrated again. DNA was stained with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and examined under fluorescence microscopy. In the case of Immuno-FISH, cells suspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 50% glycerol) were spotted onto glass slides by centrifugation and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and with 70% ethanol. Then cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and heated with 0.1 m citrate buffer at 120 °C for 5 min. Preheated Cye3-Tel peptide nucleic acid was hybridized, and cells were permeabilized again and incubated with anti-FLAG, anti-mTIN2 or anti-phospho histone H2A.X (Ser-139) (upstate) antibody. Alexa-488-conjugated goat IgG were used as the secondary antibody. Labeled cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy (Axioplan II, Zeiss). For all of the immunofluorescence comparison data, the exposure time remained the same in the same set of experiments. Preparation of Genomic DNA and the Telomere Restriction Fragment (TRF) Analysis—The genomic DNA was prepared using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen). Purified genomic DNA was digested with HinfI and separated by pulse-field gel electrophoresis. The gel was dried and denatured in buffer containing 1.5 m NaCl and 0.4 n NaOH and then neutralized in 1.5 m NaCl and 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer. The telomere probe (CCCTAA)4 was end-labeled with γ-[32P]ATP and used for hybridization at 42 °C in five times SSC and five times in Denhardt's solution. The hybridized gel was washed in a 0.1× SSC solution at 25 °C. TRF signals were detected with BAS 5000 and Median telomere length and semi-interquartile range was calculated using Telometric software, Version 1.2 (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA) (25Zhong Z.H.

Creation of a Chicken-Mouse TRF1 Chimera That Can Localize to Telomeres but Does Not Associate with mTIN2—We previously described the phenotype of a murine TRF1 conditional knock-out model (mTRF1 cond-KO) in ES cells in which both alleles of the endogenous mTRF1 gene were inactivated but exogenous mTRF1 cDNA flanked by two loxP sequences and a transgene encoding a Cre-estrogen receptor fusion molecule, Mer-Cre-Mer, were expressed (11Iwano T. Tachibana M. Reth M. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1442-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The deletion of mTRF1 by the OHT-mediated lox/Cre recombination caused growth defects and chromosomal instability. Furthermore, mTIN2 and mTRF2 resulted in lost or decreased telomeric association in these cells, respectively, and abnormal telomere structures (doublet, broken, and loss of telomeres) were frequently observed in metaphase-chromosome spreads. To further examine whether telomere localization of other shelterin components, mTPP1 and mPOT1, are affected in mTRF1Δ ES cells, we introduced the GFP-mTPP1, GFP-mPOT1a, and GFP-mPOT1b expression vectors. All of these GFP fusion molecules formed nuclear foci and also overlapped with FLAG-mTRF1 signals, indicating their telomere localization (supplemental Fig. 1A). In mTRF1 cond-KO ES cells, after mTRF1 was deleted by OHT treatment, all of these fusion molecules lost telomeric foci formation, and only diffused nuclear signals were detected (supplemental Fig. 1B). These data support that the telomere localization of shelterin components is severely affected by the absence of mTRF1 in mTRF1Δ ES cells (3Liu D. O'Connor M.S. Qin J. Songyang Z. J. Biol.

To elucidate the importance of mTRF1 in shelterin regulation of telomere function, we aimed to investigate the role of each shelterin component in the mTRF1Δ phenotypes. First, we designed a mTRF1 mutant molecule that could bind to telomeric DNA but could not interact with mTIN2 to clarify whether telomeric localization of mTIN2 was crucial for the TRF1Δ phenotype. We deleted the N-terminal domain of mTRF1 that is responsible for homodimerization and its interaction with mTIN2 (TRFH domain) (27Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). However, this mTRF1 deletion mutant did not localize to telomeres (data not shown), probably because it was unable to form dimers, an essential requisite for telomere DNA binding (5de Lange T. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2288) Google Scholar, 7Bianchi A. Smith S. Chong L. Elias P. de Lange T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we obtained evidence that a chicken TRF1 homologue (cTRF1) localized to telomeres in a chicken B cell line, DT40 and that a GFP-tagged mTIN2 did not form telomeric foci in the same cells (data not shown). Furthermore, the chicken telomeric DNA sequences are the same as those of mammals (28Nanda I. Schmid M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1994; 65: 190-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned that the cTRF1 would not interact with mTIN2. To demonstrate this, we expressed MYC-mTIN2 and either FLAG-cTRF1 or FLAG-mTRF1 in HEK293T cells. The immunoprecipitation analyses showed that the interaction of cTRF1 with mTIN2 was greatly reduced in transient expression, although a significant amount of mTIN2 associated with mTRF1 (supplemental Fig. 2). Then, we established stable clone expressing FLAG-cTRF1 in mTRF1 cond-KO ES cell lines and examined FLAG-cTRF1 telomere localization. Although chicken and mouse telomere DNA sequences are the same, immunostaining with anti-FLAG antibodies showed only faint cTRF1 signals localized at the telomeres even before mTRF1 was deleted (Fig. 1B, middle panel). After the OHT treatment mTIN2 telomere localization was undetected, and none of the TRF1Δ phenotypes could be rescued by FLAG-cTRF1 expression (data not shown). Next, we made a chicken-mouse TRF1 chimera (cmTRF1) in which the N terminus of the mouse TRF1, including the TRFH domain (amino acids 1-247) was replaced with that of the chicken TRF1 (amino acids 1-214) (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 3). Because it possessed the mouse Myb domain and the chicken TRFH domain, cmTRF1 was expected to firmly bind to telomeres by forming a homodimer but not to interact with mTIN2. Therefore, we hoped that cmTRF1 would complement for the mTRF1 telomere functions other than those which are mTIN2-mediated or -regulated. To investigate whether cmTRF1 interacts with mTIN2 and also other telomeric proteins, cell lysates of HEK293T cells co-expressing FLAG-cmTRF1 and GFP-fused mTIN2, mTRF2, mTPP1, mPOT1a, or mPOT1b were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody. As shown in supplemental Fig. 4, there is no evident interaction of FLAG-cmTRF1 with mTIN2 and other shelterin components. Then, we established stable clone expressing FLAG-cmTRF1 (supplemental Fig. 5A) and confirmed again that association of cmTRF1 with mTIN2 was not detected (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the co-localization of cmTRF1 foci with telomeric DNA indicated that cmTRF1 was localized at telomeres (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). cmTRF1 Could Not Rescue Any of the Phenotypes Observed in mTRF1Δ ES Cells—To investigate whether any mTRF1Δ phenotypes were rescued by FLAG-cmTRF1 expression, we first examined localization of telomere components in mTRF1-KO ES cells and those expressing either FLAG-mTRF1 or FLAG-cmTRF1 with or without OHT (supplemental Fig. 5A). Telomere localization of endogenous mTIN2 and exogenous GFP-mTPP1, GFP-mPOT1a, and GFP-mPOT1b were examined by immunostaining. The binding of mTRF2 to telomeres was studied with a ChIP assay. All the data indicated that cmTRF1 could not rescue the telomere localization defects of any of the shelterin components in mTRF1Δ ES cells, although telomeric localization in all of them was rescued in ES cells expressing FLAG-mTRF1 (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Figs. 1, C and D, and 6A). Growth defects and abnormal telomere signals were not changed by the presence of FLAG-cmTRF1 (Fig. 2, C and D, and Table 1). In addition, accumulation of H2A.X phosphorylation (γH2AX) at telomeres, referred to as telomere dysfunction-induced foci (TIFs) (29Takai H. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1549-1556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar, 30d'Adda di Fagagna F. Reaper P. Clay-Farrace L. Fiegler H. Carr P. Von Zglinicki T. Saretzki G. Carter N. Jackson S.

The TIF formation was not induced in TRF1Δ ES cells expressing FLAG-mTRF1, confirming that TIF formation is another mTRF1Δ phenotype (supplemental Fig. 5B, middle panel). In conclusion, these results suggest that cmTRF1 can localize to telomeres but cannot rescue any of the phenotypes induced in the mTRF1Δ ES cells. These results further support the possibility that the inability to recruit TIN2 and other shelterin components to telomeres is the cause of the mTRF1Δ phenotypes.TABLE 1End-to-end fusions and aberrant telomere signals in metaphase chromosome spreads of mTRF1 cond-KO ES cellsmTRF1 cond-KOFLAG-mTRF1+FLAG-cmTRF1+FLAG-mTRF2+FLAG-TIN2-cmTRF1+OHT−OHT+OHT−OHT+OHT−OHT+OHT−OHT+OHT−OHT+No. of metaphase10101010101010101010No. of the chromosomes per metaphase40.540.640.740.740.440.940.241.140.740.8Doublet and broken telomere signals7 (0.43)258 (15.9)28 (1.16)19 (1.16)24 (1.48)185 (11.3)16 (3.94)240 (14.6)15 (0.92)165 (10.1)Loss of telomere signals5 (0.31)54 (3.3)1 (0.06)4 (0.04)4 (0.25)79 (4.8)1 (0.25)85 (5.17)1 (0.06)30 (1.84)End-to-end fusions of telomere0 (0)2 (0.12)3 (0.18)0 (0)0 (0)9 (0.55)0 (0)2 (0.12)0 (0)1 (0.06) Open table in a new tab Aberrant Telomere Structure Is Independent of TRF2 and TIN2-TPP1-POT1 Telomere Localization Defects—To clarify further whether the telomeric localization of mTIN2 was essential for the mTRF1Δ phenotypes, we established ES cells in which mTIN2 localized to the telomere in the absence of functional mTRF1. We applied two different strategies for creating these cells. First, we overexpressed exogenous mTRF2 in mTRF1 cond-KO ES cells. Previous work had shown that some mTRF2 remained on the telomeres in the absence of mTRF1 (Ref. 11Iwano T. Tachibana M. Reth M. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1442-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and Fig. 2B) and also that mTIN2 interacted with mTRF2 in vivo (17Houghtaling B.R. Cuttonaro L. Chang W. Smith S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1621-1631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 18Kim S.H. Beausejour C. Davalos A.R. Kaminker P. Heo S.J. Campisi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43799-43804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expected that overproduction of exogenous mTRF2 would suppress the reduction of mTRF2 from telomeres in mTRF1Δ ES cells and that some mTIN2 would be recruited to telomeres through the TRF2-TIN2 interaction. The second strategy was to utilize a fusion molecule that combined mTIN2 and cmTRF1 (TIN2-cmTRF1) (Fig. 3A). We reasoned that TIN2-cmTRF1 should localize to telomeres by cmTRF1-mediated telomere binding. Thus, we established the stable clones expressing either FLAG-mTRF2 or FLAG-TIN2-cmTRF1 in mTRF1 cond-KO ES cell lines (mTRF1 cond-KO, FLAG-mTRF2+ or mTRF1 condKO, FLAG-TIN2-cmTRF1+, respectively) (supplemental Fig. 5C). We found that TIN2-cmTRF1 localized to telomeres in the presence or absence of mTRF1 and that it led GFP-mTPP1, GFP-mPOT1a, and GFP-mPOT1b to form telomeric foci (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. 1F), and mTRF2 telomere binding was not also diminished in the absence of mTRF1 (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. 6B), corresponding to previous reports in that the telomeric localization of mTPP1 and its associated protein mPOT1 was dependent on mTIN2 (13Liu D.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, the overproduction of exogenous mTRF2 rescued mTRF2 telomere binding but did not maintain endogenous mTIN2 localization at telomeres in mTRF1Δ ES cells (Fig. 3, B and C, and supplemental Fig. 6B). Furthermore, GFP-mTPP1, GFP-mPOT1a, and GFP-mPOT1b could not form telomere foci in mTRF1Δ, FLAG-mTRF2+ ES cells (supplemental Fig. 1E). These data clearly indicate that mTRF2 telomere localization does not serve as a scaffold for mTIN2, mTPP1, or mPOT1 recruitment to telomeres. Growth defects and TIF formation (γH2AX) were not induced in either mTRF1Δ, FLAG-mTRF2+ or mTRF1Δ, FLAG-TIN2-cmTRF1+ ES cells (Fig. 3D and supplemental Fig. 5D). However, abnormal telomere signals in the metaphase spreads were not suppressed in either type of mTRF1Δ ES cells (Fig. 3E). Doublets and broken telomeres and loss of telomeres were observed in 15.9 and 3.3% of the analyzed chromosomal ends of mTRF1Δ cells, respectively, as well as 14.6 and 5.17% of mTRF1Δ, FLAG-mTRF2+ cells, 10.1 and 1.84% of mTRF1Δ, FLAG-TIN2-cmTRF1+ cells, and 1.16 and 0.24% of mTRF1Δ, FLAG-mTRF1+ cells (Table 1). These data strongly suggest that aberrant telomere signals in the metaphase spreads are not caused by defects in telomere localization of the shelterin components mTIN2, mTRF2, mTPP1, or mPOT1. Abnormal Telomere Signals Are Maintained without Chromosomal Instability after Long Term Culture—Even without TIF formation and growth defects, abnormal telomere signals were maintained in the mTRF1Δ ES cells that expressed mTRF2 or TIN2-cmTRF1. Our previous studies demonstrate that in long term cultures, mTRF1Δ ES cells accumulated many end-to-end fusions. (Ref. 11Iwano T. Tachibana M. Reth M. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1442-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and Table 2). To examine the relationship between chromosomal instability and the abnormal telomere signals we subcloned mTRF1Δ, FLAG-mTRF2+, mTRF1Δ, FLAG-TIN2-cmTRF1+, and mTRF1Δ, FLAG-mTRF1+ ES cells (supplemental Fig. 7A) and examined whether end-to-end fusion or aneuploid chromosomes accumulated after ∼60 days culture. We found that none of these ES cell clones showed growth defects during the culture period (data not shown), but abnormal telomere signals were observed in mTRF1Δ cells that expressed FLAG-mTRF2 or FLAG-TIN2-cmTRF1 after ∼60 days culture. Nevertheless, there were no obvious alterations of chromosomal number or accumulation of end-to-end fusions (summarized in Table 2). These results indicate that abnormal telomere signals in the metaphase spreads did not correlate with chromosomal instability in TRF1Δ ES cells.TABLE 2End-to-end fusions and aberrant telomere signals in metaphase chromosome spreads of mTRF1-positive and -negative ES cell clones after ~60 days cultureloxP-mTRF1 cDNAmTRF1 ΔES cells (clone 81-24)aIndicates data reproduced with permission from Iwano et al.

Open table in a new tab POT1-TPP1-independent Telomere Length Regulation of TRF1—According to the current understanding, shelterin components and the dynamics of higher-order telomere structures, including t-loop formation, are crucial for the regulation of telomerase-mediated telomere lengthening (5de Lange T. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2288) Google Scholar). The aberrant telomere signals that we observed in mTRF1Δ ES cells represent unknown qualitative defects of telomere structure that are independent of chromosomal instability. Therefore, we examined the relationship between those abnormal telomere signals and telomere length regulation. We cultured mTRF1-present and -absent ES clones that expressed FLAG-mTRF1, FLAG-mTRF2, or FLAG-TIN2-cmTRF1 for ∼60 days and monitored their telomere lengths during this culture period (supplemental Fig. 7A). Telomere lengths were examined by the TRFs analysis (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B shows each median telomere length. In contrast to mTRF1 cond-KO, FLAG-mTRF1+ and mTRF1 condKO, FLAG-TIN2-cmTRF1+ ES cells, we found that mTRF1 cond-KO, FLAG-TRF2+ ES cells had a much shorter median telomere length (less than 20 kb) and remained this size during the culture period, in agreement with previous reports of TRF2-mediated telomere shortening (31Muñoz P. Blanco R. Flores J. Blasco M. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 32Wu Y. Zacal N. Rainbow A. Zhu X. DNA Repair (Amst). 2007; 6: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33Karlseder J. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Science. 2002; 295: 2446-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A, lanes 7-9). Interestingly, this exogenous mTRF2-mediated telomere shortening was canceled out by the mTRF1 deletion; in the absence of mTRF1, telomeres rapidly elongated to a median telomere length of 21-27.5 kb (Fig. 4A, lanes 10-12). These data suggest that mTRF2-mediated telomere length regulation may be primarily dependent on mTRF1 expression. No telomere elongation or shortening was observed in either mTRF1-positive or -negative ES cells that expressed either FLAG-mTRF1 or FLAG-TIN2-cmTRF1 in ∼60 day cultures (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-6 and 13-18). To examine the relationship between the telomere elongation phenotype of mTRF1Δ, FLAG-mTRF2+ ES cells and the inability of telomeres to recruit mTIN2, mTPP1, or mPOT1, we further introduced either MYC-cmTRF1 or MYC-TIN2-cmTRF1 expression vectors into mTRF1 cond-KO, FLAG-mTRF2+ ES cells and subcloned mTRF1Δ cells (supplemental Fig. 7B). We then monitored alterations of telomere length in mTRF1-present and -absent ES clones during ∼60 days culture (Fig. 5A). In mTRF1 cond-KO, FLAG-mTRF2+ ES cells that expressed MYC-cmTRF1 or MYC-TIN2-cmTRF1, the median telomere lengths were under 20 kb (Fig. 5B), similar to that of the parental phenotype (Fig. 4B). After OHT treatment and subcloning of mTRF1 deficient cells, the median telomere lengths were slightly elongated; that is, 20 kb for cells that expressed MYC-cmTRF1, 18 kb for cells that expressed MYC-TIN2-cmTRF1, and 15-16 kb for mTRF1 cond-KO, FLAG-mTRF2+ ES cells (parental phenotype) (Fig. 5A, lanes 5 and 13). However, during ∼60 days of culture, mTRF1 cond-KO cells that expressed MYC-cmTRF1 and MYC-TIN2-cmTRF1 maintained their telomere lengths under 20 kb, but the mTRF1Δ clones displayed progressive elongation of their telomeres. Although the mTRF1 deletion-induced telomere elongation in both MYC-cmTRF1 and MYC-TIN2-cmTRF1-expressing clones, the telomere lengthening in the MYC-TIN2-cmTRF1-expressing clones was significantly diminished (3-kb telomere DNA elongation/60 days) compared with that in the MYC-cmTRF1-expressing clone (6-kb telomere DNA elongation/60 days) (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 5-8 and 13-16, respectively, and not shown). These data suggest that TRF1 has two molecular pathways involved in negative telomere length regulation; one is mediated by the recruitment of the TIN2-TPP1-POT1 complex to telomeres (10Loayza D. De Lange T. Nature. 2003; 423: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 19Ye J.Z. Hockemeyer D. Krutchinsky A.N. Loayza D. Hooper S.M. Chait B.T. de Lange T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and the other is independent of the TIN2-TPP1-POT1 recruitment. The latter pathway may be mediated by other TRF1 functions that include its DNA bending activity or its regulation or recruitment of a novel telomere-associating protein(s). By exploring different ways to tether shelterin components to telomeres in the absence of functional TRF1, we clarified that the mTRF1Δ phenotypes can be categorized as dependent or independent of TIN2-TPP1-POT1 telomere localization. Thus, the growth defects, TIF formation, and chromosomal instability were dependent, the abnormal telomere signals in the metaphase spreads were independent, and the telomere elongation phenotypes were a mixture of dependent and independent. TRF1-mediated Telomere Length Regulation—It has been shown that TRF1 is a regulator for telomerase-dependent telomere elongation. In addition, it was also shown that telomeric TPP1-POT1 functions as a transducer of the telomere length regulation of TRF1 (10Loayza D. De Lange T. Nature. 2003; 423: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 19Ye J.Z. Hockemeyer D. Krutchinsky A.N. Loayza D. Hooper S.M. Chait B.T. de Lange T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, although some of our results confirm this mechanism (Fig. 5A, lane 1-8, and B), our studies with mTRF1Δ FLAG-mTRF2+ ES cells that expressed MYC-cmTRF1 or MYC-TIN2-cmTRF1 suggested that a TPP1-POT1-independent pathway also exists. What is the nature of the TPP1-POT1-independent telomere length regulation of TRF1? There are several different possibilities. In some studies we utilized mTRF1 cond-KO ES cells that overexpressed mTRF2. In these cells the telomere length was considerably shortened (median telomere length <20 kb) compared with those in control mouse ES cells (median telomere length >30 kb). Telomere shortening with mTRF2 overexpression has been reported previously, and it was shown that endonuclease protein XPF was involved in this process (31Muñoz P. Blanco R. Flores J. Blasco M. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 32Wu Y. Zacal N. Rainbow A. Zhu X. DNA Repair (Amst). 2007; 6: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33Karlseder J. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Science. 2002; 295: 2446-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Our subsequent results showed that mTRF1 deletion blocked the TRF2-mediated telomere shortening. Thus, the first hypothesis is that the TPP1-POT1-independent TRF1 regulation of telomere elongation may be mediated by the regulation of XPF telomere localization. Our second hypothesis is that TRF1 acts in an intrinsic manner, and its regulation of telomere elongation may be TIN2-mediated. As described, TRF1 can bend telomere DNA (7Bianchi A. Smith S. Chong L. Elias P. de Lange T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and TIN2 enhances the TRF1-telomere DNA interaction; this suggests that TIN2 may alter the conformation of TRF1 and induce a structural change in telomeres that is less accessible to telomerase (34Kim S. Han S. You Y. Chen D. Campisi J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our results showed that the fusion of TIN2 to cmTRF1 localized exogenous TIN2-(-cmTRF1) to telomeres and recruited other shelterin components, but this might not induce conformational changes of TRF1 (cmTRF1). Thus, we speculate that the TPP1-POT1-independent telomere length regulation of TRF1 depends on the ability to induce a telomeric structural change. Our last hypothesis acknowledges the possibility that a novel mTRF1-associated molecule(s) exists that does not bind to the cmTRF1. Thus, in this hypothetical scenario we speculate that the TPP1-POT1-independent TRF1 regulation of telomere elongation depends on the association of this putative molecule with TRF1. The Nature of Abnormal Telomere Signals in mTRF1Δ Metaphase Spreads—Abnormal telomere signals in the TRF1Δ metaphase spreads were not suppressed by the telomere localization of other shelterin components. In general, telomere loss or telomere shortening below a critical length resulted in an inability to maintain the requisite end protection and promoted chromosomal instabilities, primarily induced by end-to-end fusion. Suppression of growth defects, TIF formation, and chromosomal instability (fusions and aneuploidy) in mTRF1Δ, FLAG-TIN2-cmTRF1+ ES cells indicated that the DNA damage response pathways were not activated. Therefore, we assumed that the observed abnormal telomere signals in mTRF1Δ ES cells did not reflect telomere disruption in vivo. In mTRF1Δ ES cells, telomere chromatin condensation may have been incomplete, and thus, telomeres were highly susceptible to DNA breakage in the physically disruptive process of FISH analysis. Telomere regions are usually heterochromatic (35Blasco M.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). In addition, it is reported that telomere RNA localizing at telomeres appears to be essential for heterochromatinization, and TRF1 is involved in accumulation of telomere RNA (36Schoeftner S. Blasco M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The TRF1 function, which is not complemented with cmTRF1, may be involved in this telomere heterochromatinization. In any event, further elucidation of the nature of the abnormal telomere signals observed in mTRF1Δ ES cells will be crucial for obtaining insight into the mechanism of the TPP1-POT1-independent TRF1-mediated telomere length regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2034352799,"Fractionation of brain extracts and functional biochemical assays identified PP2Calpha, a serine/threonine phosphatase, as the major biochemical activity inhibiting PAK1. PP2Calpha dephosphorylated PAK1 and p38, both of which were activated upon hyperosmotic shock with the same kinetics. In comparison to growth factors, hyperosmolality was a more potent activator of PAK1. Therefore we characterize the PAK signaling pathway in the hyperosmotic shock response. Endogenous PAKs were recruited to the p38 kinase complex in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Overexpression of a PAK inhibitory peptide or dominant negative Cdc42 revealed that p38 activation was dependent on PAK and Cdc42 activities. PAK mutants deficient in binding to Cdc42 or PAK-interacting exchange factor were not activated. Using a panel of kinase inhibitors, we identified PI3K acting upstream of PAK, which correlated with PAK repression by pTEN overexpression. RNA interference knockdown of PAK expression reduced stress-induced p38 activation and conversely, PP2Calpha knockdown increased its activation. Hyperosmotic stress-induced PAK translocation away from focal adhesions to the perinuclear compartment and resulted in disassembly of focal adhesions, which are hallmarks of PAK activation. Inhibition of PAK by overexpression of PP2Calpha or the kinase inhibitory domain prevented sorbitol-induced focal adhesion dissolution. Inhibition of MAPK pathways showed that MEK-ERK signaling but not p38 is required for full PAK activation and focal adhesion turnover. We conclude that 1) PAK plays a required role in hyperosmotic signaling through the PI3K/pTEN/Cdc42/PP2Calpha/p38 pathway, and 2) PAK and PP2Calpha modulate the effects of this pathway on focal adhesion dynamics."

https://openalex.org/W1999350740,"Mutations in the late endosomal/lysosomal membrane protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) are known to cause a generalized block in retrograde vesicle-mediated transport, resulting in the hyper-accumulation of multiple lysosomal cargos. An important, yet often overlooked, category of lysosomal cargo includes the vast array of small molecular weight amine-containing molecules that are substrates for ion trapping in the highly acidic organelle lumen. We show here that the introduction of amine-containing molecules in lysosomes can significantly stimulate NPC1-mediated late endosome/lysosome fusion, and subsequently the secretion of lysosomal cargo. To illustrate the physiological importance of this NPC1-mediated transport pathway, we show that NPC1-deficient cells are more susceptible to the toxic effects of a lysosomotropic polyamine metabolite 3-aminopropanal. Moreover, NPC fibroblasts are shown to have higher levels of polyamine oxidase, an enzyme involved in the formation of 3-aminopropanal.

Acta. 2004; 1685: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The early work of Pentchev and others showed that NPC-diseased cells are laden with LDL-derived free unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in their lysosomes, which was thought to be the direct cause of NPC disease pathology (2Pentchev P.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1685: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 3Garver W.S. Heidenreich R.A. Curr. Mol.

Therapeutic interventions aimed at limiting the biosynthesis and/or uptake of cholesterol and other lipids have been quite effective in reducing the hyper-accumulation phenotype; however, such approaches have not been successful in significantly decreasing NPC disease progression in various human and animal disease models (5Erickson R.P.

Accordingly, the true functional role of NPC1 has been controversial and is, perhaps, unknown (9Ioannou Y.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 498-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).It is clear that NPC1 is required for the trafficking of LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes; however, NPC1 is also known to be required for the trafficking of multiple cargos from lysosomes (10Neufeld E.B. Wastney M. Patel S. Suresh S. Cooney A.M. Dwyer N.K. Roff C.F. Ohno K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Incardona J.P. Strauss 3rd, J.F. Vanier M.T. Patterson M.C. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9627-9635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Is there a “primary cargo” that regulates this NPC1-mediated lysosomal egress pathway? To address this, we considered other molecules that accumulate in lysosomes but do not have an established pathway for their removal. Cells are known to be continuously exposed to very high concentrations of endogenous biogenic amines, polyamines, and their metabolites (11Davis B.A. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 466: 89-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Masuko T. Kusama-Eguchi K. Sakata K. Kusama T. Chaki S. Okuyama S. Williams K. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that these molecules are not fluorescent, making it difficult to analyze their intracellular localization, a number of reports have suggested that these molecules are extensively compartmentalized in lysosomes (13Dai H. Kramer D.L. Yang C. Murti K.G. Porter C.W. Cleveland J.L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4944-4954PubMed Google Scholar, 14Soulet D. Gagnon B. Rivest S. Audette M. Poulin R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 6: 717-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The propensity for weakly basic amine-containing molecules to be sequestered into acidic organelles of cells, principally lysosomes, has long been observed and theoretically understood (16de Duve C. de Barsy T. Poole B. Trouet A. Tulkens P. Van Hoof F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1974; 23: 2495-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar, 17Ohkuma S. Poole B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3327-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar, 18Bulychev A. Trouet A. Tulkens P. Exp. Cell Res. 1978; 115: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The basic substrates are referred to as lysosomotropics. The driving force for accumulation relies on the magnitude of the pH gradient separating the lysosomal lumen (∼pH 4.5) and the cell cytosol (∼pH 7.0). Amine-containing molecules, depending on their pKa, can be significantly unionized and membrane-permeable in the cytosol and readily cross lipid bilayers of organelles. When such compounds enter the acidic environment of lysosomes, they experience a dramatic change in their ionization state and can now exist virtually 100% in their ionized and membrane-impermeable form, which severely impairs their rate of diffusion back out. The lysosomal proton concentration is kept high through the action of the vacuolar H+ ATPase, thus allowing excessive accumulation of the amines (19Duvvuri M. Krise J.P. Mol. Pharm. 2005; 2: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Some lysosomotropic agents when incubated with cells have been shown to induce massive vacuolization of lysosomes (20Yang W.C. Strasser F.F. Pomerat C.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1965; 38: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Finnin B.C. Reed B.L. Ruffin N.E. J. Pharm.

Ther. 2004; 310: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Their subsequent clearance and the loss of the vacuolar appearance have been observed, but the mechanistic basis for this pathway has not been previously understood (18Bulychev A. Trouet A. Tulkens P. Exp. Cell Res. 1978; 115: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).There are three separate lines of evidence that support a potential functional role for NPC1 in the regulation of endogenous amines in lysosomes: 1) We and others have shown that NPC1 is required for efficient clearance of amines from lysosomes (23Gong Y. Duvvuri M. Duncan M.B. Liu J. Krise J.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24Davies J.P. Chen F.W. Ioannou Y.A. Science. 2000; 290: 2295-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar); 2) endogenous hydrophobic amines have been shown to be over 20-fold elevated in livers of mice with NPC disease compared with control mice and were shown to be concentrated in lysosomes (25Goldin E. Roff C.F. Miller S.P. Rodriguez-Lafrasse C. Vanier M.T. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1127: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); and 3) alterations in endogenous polyamine levels and/or their metabolizing enzymes have been associated with neurodegenerative disorders similar to Alzheimer and NPC disease (26Virgili M. Crochemore C. Pena-Altamira E. Contestabile A. Neurochem. Int. 2006; 48: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 27Bernstein H.G. Muller M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 57: 485-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28Morrison L.D. Kish S.J. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 197: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).The rational development of successful therapeutic strategies for treating NPC disease have, for the most part, failed due to the lack of understanding of the function of NPC1. We show here that the formation of late endosome/lysosome hybrid organelles and the subsequent egress of lysosomal cargo are significantly enhanced when cells are exposed to certain lysosomotropic amines. Moreover, cells deficient in NPC1 are shown to be highly sensitive to the toxic effects of an endogenous polyamine metabolite, which illustrates the significance of the function. Collectively, our findings support a role for NPC1 in regulating lysosomal amine concentrations and should help to understand NPC disease pathology.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—Anti-EEA1 (early endosomes), anti-golgin-84, and anti-GM130 (Golgi apparatus) mouse monoclonal antibodies were from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR, late endosomes) was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Mouse monoclonal anti-LAMP-1 (lysosomes) was from Developmental Studies Hybridoma (Iowa City, IA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-NPC1 was obtained from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). Goat polyclonal anti-polyamine oxidase was purchased through Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). LysoTracker Red DND-99 (LTR), Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, biotinylated dextran amine, and Alexa Fluor 555 and 647 succinimidyl esters were obtained from Invitrogen. Carboxylate-modified polystyrene beads were purchased from Polysciences (Warrington, PA). 3-Aminopropanal diethyl acetal was obtained from TCI America (Portland, OR). All other materials, unless otherwise stated, were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich.Cell Culture and Conditions—Normal human fibroblasts (CRL-2076, designated NPC1+/+) were cultured according to suggestions from Coriell Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). NPC disease fibroblasts with mutated and dysfunctional NPC1 protein (GM-03123, designated NPC1-/-), mucolipidosis type IV (GM-02408, designated MLIV), and Sandhoff disease (GM-11707) fibroblasts were all cultured according to ATCC (Manassas, VA) instructions. All media was supplemented with fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere. For all experiments, cells were plated 24 h prior to evaluations to allow for adherence.Amine-induced Vacuole Size Determinations—A confocal microscopy method was developed to obtain average diameters of NR-containing compartments. Briefly, cells were treated with 50 μm nocodazole (NOC) for 1 h, washed with PBS (3×), and then exposed to 70 μm neutral red (NR) in culture medium for 6 h. Cells without NOC pretreatment were included as positive controls for vacuolization. Cells were viewed with a Zeiss Meta 510 confocal microscope equipped with an argon laser set at 458 nm. Images were captured with a Hamamatsu Orca ER camera. For size determination, NR-containing compartments were measured using MetaMorph software version 7.0 from Universal Imaging Corp. (Downington, PA). The diameters of 150 NR-containing vesicles from three separate experiments were averaged.Silencing of NPC1 Expression Using siRNA—An siRNA construct was utilized to silence NPC1 expression as previously reported (29Ganley I.G. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17890-17899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Nonspecific scrambled siRNA (Ambion, Austin, T×) was used as a negative control under identical transfection conditions per the manufacturer's suggestions. All siRNA transfections were performed using siPORT-Amine (Ambion) transfection reagent for 72 h. To confirm NPC1 knockdown, cells were harvested post-transfection, and lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis with subsequent densitometry performed using ImageJ software. For siRNA experiments requiring subsequent amine exposure, transfections were performed as described, at which point cells were exposed to 70 μm NR or 100 μm chloroquine for 6 h.Immunofluorescence—Fibroblasts were fixed using freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized by incubating cells with PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 10% fetal bovine serum for 30 min at room temperature. Primary and secondary antibody solutions were made in 0.05% saponin and 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h using the following dilutions: EEA1 (1:50), MPR (1:50), LAMP-1 (1:100), NPC1 (1:100), and GM130 (1:100). Cells were subsequently washed with PBS (3×), and secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit IgG, 1:1000) were applied for 2 h. Cells were washed again with PBS (4×) prior to microscopy with standard epifluorescence optics (Nikon).Isolation and Characterization of NR-containing Lysosomes— Lysosomes were isolated using a previously described magnetic chromatography approach. The isolation procedure, as well as control experiments, was performed as previously described with minor modifications to allow for localization of the super-paramagnetic iron dextran in lysosomes of amine-treated cells (30Diettrich O. Mills K. Johnson A.W. Hasilik A. Winchester B.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To confirm that the iron dextran was localizing in amine-containing compartments, cells were incubated with 2 mg/ml Alexa Fluor 647 dextran in PBS for 2 h, washed with PBS (4×), and subsequently given chase in complete dextran-free medium for 20 h at 37 °C. Cells were then exposed to 100 μm CQ for 6 h, and phase-contrast and fluorescence images were taken.DNA Transfections—NPC1-GFP and Rab9-YFP plasmid DNA were kindly provided by Dr. Suzanne Pfeffer and Dr. Matthew Scott, respectively (Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA). Transfections were performed using FuGene6 (Roche Applied Science) per the manufacturer's suggestions. Transfections were carried out for 48 h to allow adequate protein expression. To assess the effects of amine exposure on single and dual transfected cells, 100 μm chloroquine was added post-transfection to the culture medium for 6 h. Microscopy was then performed using standard epifluorescence optics (Nikon).Sucrosome Formation—Sucrosomes were formed by culturing cells in complete medium containing 0.1% sucrose for 48 h.Evaluating Amine Secretion from Cells—Quantitative and qualitative methods were developed to determine secretion of amines from cells. First, fibroblasts were exposed to either 70 μm NR for 6 h or 2 μm LTR for 1 h. After incubation, cells were washed with warm PBS (3×), and complete medium was replaced. For LTR, cells were imaged as a function of time using fluorescence microscopy under identical microscope settings for each time point. For NR, monolayers were washed with PBS (3×), and NR was extracted using a solution containing 49% methanol and 1% acetic acid. Samples were analyzed by spectrophotometry measuring absorbance at 540 nm using a 96-well plate reader.Dextran Secretion Assay—Cellular release of [3H]dextran (70,000 molecular weight, 125 μCi/mg, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) into culture medium, as well as controls, was performed as described by Gong et al. (23Gong Y. Duvvuri M. Duncan M.B. Liu J. Krise J.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For assays that included amine treatments, cells were incubated with amines for 3 h in complete medium at the end of the [3H]dextran chase, washed with warm PBS (2×), and medium replaced. Detection of [3H]dextran began immediately after replacement of the medium as described. The cumulative amount of dextran released into the medium is reported as a percentage of the total amount of dextran endocytosed.Late Endosome/Lysosome Fusion Assay—The fusion between late endosomes and lysosomes was evaluated in fibroblasts using a method described by Jahrus et al. (31Jahraus A. Storrie B. Griffiths G. Desjardins M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 145-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications to allow quantitative assessments based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of late endosome/lysosome contents upon fusion. To accomplish this, biotinylated dextran, fluorescently labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 (FRET acceptor), was localized to lysosomes using the above optimized pulse/chase scheme for dextran. Next, streptavidin-conjugated latex beads (0.792 ± 0.037 μm), fluorescently labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 (FRET donor), were localized to late endosomes per Jahrus et al. (31Jahraus A. Storrie B. Griffiths G. Desjardins M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 145-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amine treatments were performed after localization of the latex bead to the late endosome. Intracellular localizations of dextran and latex beads were confirmed by immunofluorescence (data not shown). To detect fusion, FRET measurements were made using a Photon Technologies International (Birmingham, NJ) Ratiomaster microscope-mounted spectrofluorometer with PMT detection. Complete details on tracer construction, measurements, and analysis can be found in the supplemental “Experimental Procedures.”3-Aminopropanal Synthesis and Toxicity Studies—3-Aminopropanal (3-AP) was prepared, as previously described, from the hydrolysis of 3-aminopropanal diethyl acetal (32Ivanova S. Botchkina G.I. Al-Abed Y. Meistrell 3rd, M. Batliwalla F. Dubinsky J.M. Iadecola C. Wang H. Gregersen P.K. Eaton J.W. Tracey K.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The reactant mixture was applied to a strong cation exchange resin (Dowex 50 × 2, H+ form) and eluted using a 0–3 m HCl step gradient. Fractions were collected, and aldehyde content was assayed by the method of Bachrach and Reches (33Bachrach U. Reches B. Analyt. Biochem. 1966; 17: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using a standard curve constructed of propionaldehyde. For cytotoxicity studies, fractions of 3-AP were neutralized to physiological pH before use. Cell viability was assessed after 12 h of 3-AP exposure using the Quick Cell Proliferation WST-1 assay from BioVision (Mountain View, CA). To determine the effects of 3-AP exposure on lysosomal membrane integrity, cellular cytosol was purified as described previously by our laboratory (34Duvvuri M. Feng W. Mathis A. Krise J.P. Pharm. Res. 2004; 21: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fractions of purified cytosol were assayed for β-hexosaminidase activity, a lysosomal enzyme, as described by Duvvuri et al. (19Duvvuri M. Krise J.P. Mol. Pharm. 2005; 2: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).RESULTSAmine-induced Vacuolization of Lysosomes Requires Functional NPC1—When cells grown in culture are exposed to high concentrations of lysosomotropic amines, their lysosomes typically become vacuolated (20Yang W.C. Strasser F.F. Pomerat C.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1965; 38: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Morissette G. Moreau E. C-Gaudreault R. Marceau F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 310: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The vacuolar appearance rapidly disappears when the amines are removed from the cell culture medium, which suggests that the amines are efficiently cleared (18Bulychev A. Trouet A. Tulkens P. Exp. Cell Res. 1978; 115: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The mechanism for release is not clearly understood, but it has been shown to require intact microtubules and its efficiency differed between cell types (22Morissette G. Moreau E. C-Gaudreault R. Marceau F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 310: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Gong Y. Duvvuri M. Duncan M.B. Liu J. Krise J.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).If lysosomes were to rupture, the release of enzymes (i.e. cathepsins) into the cell cytosol would potentially initiate apoptosis (35Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). When amines accumulate in the lysosome, a significant osmotic imbalance can result causing water to enter the organelle and exert pressure on the organelle lipid bilayer. Accordingly, the vacuolization would serve to increase the organelle volume, decrease amine concentration, and help relieve pressure to avoid organelle rupture.We examined if NPC1 was involved in the amine-induced vacuolization of lysosomes. Human foreskin fibroblasts (normal or with a mutated and dysfunctional NPC1, represented by NPC1+/+ and NPC1-/-, respectively) were incubated with the lysosomotropic amine NR, and high resolution images of cells were taken with a confocal microscope to examine the average diameter of NR-containing compartments. Normal cells exposed to NR had an approximate vacuole size of 1.5 μm (Fig. 1, A and B). NPC1-/- cells exposed to the amine had NR-containing compartments approximately one-half the size of those from NPC1+/+ cells. NPC1+/+ cells treated with nocodazole also had small NR-containing vacuoles. This illustrates the involvement of microtubules in vacuolization, suggesting that the membrane is not obtained, at least significantly, from internal sources such as multivesicular bodies. To more specifically illustrate the involvement of NPC1 in amine-induced vacuolization, we utilized a small interfering RNA (siRNA) designed to transiently suppress the expression of NPC1. When performing the siRNA transfections, we were sometimes able to view, on a single image, cells that were not transfected (i.e. had normal NPC1 expression) alongside those that were efficiently transfected and had depleted NPC1. Immunofluorescence staining of NPC1 allowed us to demonstrate that only cells expressing NPC1 formed amine-induced vacuoles (Fig. 1C). Conversely, cells that did not have visible amounts of NPC1 did not form the amine-induced vacuoles. We were also able to rescue the amine-induced vacuolization phenotype in NPC1-/- fibroblasts by transfecting them with a functional NPC1-GFP construct (Fig. 1D). Collectively, these results illustrate the requirement for NPC1 in the amine-induced vacuolization of lysosomes.Amine-induced Vacuoles Are Formed through a Heterotypic Fusion of Lysosomes with Late Endosomes—When considering vacuolization, it is important to realize that amine-induced vacuolization requires the recruitment of membranes to allow lipid bilayers to expand (36Solheim A.E. Seglen P.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our previous results that illustrated the requirement of intact microtubules in this process (Fig. 1, A and B). Accordingly, we examined if amines facilitated the fusion of lysosomes with other organelles or vesicles. Immunofluorescence analysis of NPC1+/+ fibroblasts demonstrated that without amine treatment NPC1 is shown to reside predominantly on a subset of a lysosome-specific membrane protein (LAMP-1)-positive lysosomes and not to a significant extent on late endosomes containing the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR) (Fig. 2A). However, when NPC1+/+ cells were treated with NR the resultant vacuoles contained LAMP-1, MPR, and the NPC1 protein (Fig. 2B). The vacuoles did not colocalize with a Golgi-specific protein GM130 or with an early endosome specific protein EEA1 (supplemental Fig. S1). Terminal endocytic compartments (vacuoles) were purified from fibroblasts using a previously described magnetic chromatographic approach that utilizes endocytosed iron-coated dextran (10,000 molecular weight) (19Duvvuri M. Krise J.P. Mol. Pharm. 2005; 2: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A fluorescence-labeled dextran of the same size was incubated with cells to establish optimal pulse-chase parameters to ensure localization with amine-induced vacuoles (Fig. 2C). The isolated compartment was highly enriched in the lysosomal protein LAMP-1 and was not significantly contaminated with other compartments such as the Golgi or early endosomes (Fig. 2D). The isolated compartment was analyzed for the presence of MPR, which was shown to become enriched only in NPC1+/+ and not in NPC1-/- fibroblasts that were treated with amines prior to the isolation (Fig. 2E). To confirm the involvement of late endosomes in the vacuolization, NPC1+/+ fibroblasts were co-transfected with Rab9-YFP, a late endosome-specific protein, and with NPC1-GFP. Consistent with prior results, colocalization of these proteins occurred extensively on amine-induced vacuoles, yet a much smaller degree of colocalization was observed in cells not incubated with the amine (Fig. 2F).FIGURE 2Amine-induced vacuoles are created through a heterotypic fusion of lysosomes with late endosomes. A, immunofluorescence images of NPC1+/+ cells showing the localization of NPC1 (without amine treatment). NPC1 (green) does not significantly colocalize with the late endosome-specific mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR, red) and does colocalize with the lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1, red). B, immunofluorescence and phase contrast images of NPC1+/+ cells incubated with NR to induce vacuolization. NPC1, LAMP-1, and MPR are all localized to the membrane of the newly formed vacuoles. C, fluorescence-labeled dextran macromolecules specifically colocalize with amine-induced vacuoles in normal fibroblasts following a pulse-chase protocol (see “Experimental Procedures”). D, Western blot analysis of organelle-specific proteins contained in the purification of terminal endocytic compartments (see “Experimental Procedures”). Aliquots of the post nuclear supernatant (PNS), the material flowing through the magnetic column (flow through, F.T.), and the fraction retained on the column (retained) were all analyzed for the Golgi-specific protein Golgin-84, the lysosome-specific protein LAMP-1, and the early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1). E, Western blot analysis of MPR in purified terminal endocytic compartments before and after amine (NR) treatments. NPC1+/+ fibroblasts become enriched in MPR after amine treatment, which does not occur with NPC1-/- fibroblasts. F, fluorescence images of NPC1+/+ fibroblasts transfected with NPC1-GFP (green) and with the late endosome-specific Rab9-YFP (red). An increase NPC1/Rab9 colocalization is observed following treatment with the amine CQ. G, vacuolization of lysosomes with sucrose occurs regardless of NPC1 functional status and does not involve fusion with late endosomes. Phase contrast images show that the addition of 0.1% sucrose induced vacuolization (sucrosomes formation) in both NPC1+/+ and NPC1-/- fibroblasts. Immunofluorescence analysis of LAMP-1 (green) and MPR (red) reveals that they do not colocalize with or without sucrose. Scale bars represent 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownl"
https://openalex.org/W2150361629,"DNA microarrays are used for gene-expression profiling, single-nucleotide polymorphism detection and disease diagnosis. A persistent challenge in this area is the lack of microarray screening technology suitable for integration into routine clinical care. Here, we describe a method for sensitive and label-free electrostatic readout of DNA or RNA hybridization on microarrays. The electrostatic properties of the microarray are measured from the position and motion of charged microspheres randomly dispersed over the surface. We demonstrate nondestructive electrostatic imaging with 10-mum lateral resolution over centimeter-length scales, which is four-orders of magnitude larger than that achievable with conventional scanning electrostatic force microscopy. Changes in surface charge density as a result of specific hybridization can be detected and quantified with 50-pM sensitivity, single base-pair mismatch selectivity and in the presence of complex background. Because the naked eye is sufficient to read out hybridization, this approach may facilitate broad application of multiplexed assays."
https://openalex.org/W2034949902,"Pseudouridine, a non-classical nucleoside present in human urine as a degradation product of RNAs, is one of the few molecules that has a glycosidic C-C bond. Through a data base mining approach involving transcriptomic data, we have molecularly identified two enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of pseudouridine in uropathogenic Escherichia coli, the principal agent of urinary tract infections in humans. The first enzyme, coded by the gene yeiC, specifically phosphorylates pseudouridine to pseudouridine 5′-phosphate. Accordingly, yeiC– mutants are unable to metabolize pseudouridine, in contrast to wild-type E. coli UTI89. The second enzyme, encoded by the gene yeiN belonging to the same operon as yeiC, catalyzes the conversion of pseudouridine 5′-phosphate to uracil and ribose 5-phosphate in a divalent cation-dependent manner. Remarkably, the glycosidic C-C bond of pseudouridine is cleaved in the course of this reaction, indicating that YeiN is the first molecularly identified enzyme able to hydrolyze a glycosidic C-C bond. Though this reaction is easily reversible, the association of YeiN with pseudouridine kinase indicates that it serves physiologically to metabolize pseudouridine 5′-phosphate rather than to form it. YeiN is homologous to Thermotoga maritima IndA, a protein with a new fold, which we now show to act also as a pseudouridine-5′-phosphate glycosidase. Data base mining indicates that most eukaryotes possess homologues of pseudouridine kinase and pseudouridine-5′-phosphate glycosidase and that these are most often associated in a single bifunctional protein. The gene encoding this bifunctional protein is absent from the genomes of man and other mammals, indicating that the capacity for metabolizing pseudouridine has been lost late in evolution.

The gene encoding this bifunctional protein is absent from the genomes of man and other mammals, indicating that the capacity for metabolizing pseudouridine has been lost late in evolution. Pseudouridine is a nucleoside that is formed post-transcriptionally in RNAs such as tRNAs, ribosomal RNAs, and small RNAs, where it represents one of the main non-classical nucleosides (1Charette M. Gray M.W. IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Mammalian ribosomal RNA contains about ≈100 pseudouridines per ribosome, and tRNAs contain an average of 3–4 pseudouridines. The binding of uracil to ribose through C5 rather than through N1 allows the presence of an additional N-bound hydrogen, which by immobilizing a water molecule stabilizes secondary structures and reinforces base stacking. Pseudouridine is formed post-transcriptionally by pseudouridine synthases, which act on maturing tRNAs or rRNAs by severing the normal glycosidic C-N bond, flipping the uracil moiety along its N3-C6 axis and forming a glycosidic C-C bond with C5 without any additional input of energy. Pseudouridine is one of the few examples of molecules that have a glycosidic C-C bond. Other examples are the C-mannosyl residues bound to tryptophan (2Furmanek A. Hofsteenge J. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2000; 47: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the C-glucosides bound to catechol derivatives (C-glucosylated form of microcin E492, Ref. 3Vassiliadis G. Peduzzi J. Zirah S.

Agents Chemother. 1974; 5: 90-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). No enzyme that hydrolyzes a glycosidic C-C bond has yet been molecularly identified. Pseudouridine can be used by Escherichia coli as a source of uracil for a strain deficient in pyrimidine synthesis (uridine auxotroph) (6Breitman T.R. Scher C.D. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 1873-1874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pseudouridine was shown to be phosphorylated in E. coli extracts by a kinase to pseudouridine 5′-phosphate (PsiMP) 3The abbreviations used are: PsiMPpseudouridine 5′-phosphateLBLuria-Bertanippmparts per millionPCAperchloric acid. 3The abbreviations used are: PsiMPpseudouridine 5′-phosphateLBLuria-Bertanippmparts per millionPCAperchloric acid. (7Solomon L.R. Breitman T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), which is hydrolyzed to ribose 5-phosphate and uracil (8Breitman T.R. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 103: 263-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Scheme 1). Neither of these enzymes has been identified, despite the interest that may represent the identification of an enzyme that cleaves a C-C bond. Pseudouridine metabolism is likely to be restricted to only some species. The finding that this nucleoside is present in human urine, where its concentration is increased in tumor-bearing patients (9Feng B. Zheng M.H. Zheng Y.F. Lu A.G. Li J.W. Wang M.L. Ma J.J. Xu G.W.

Expression and Purification of YeiC—A 5′-primer containing the putative ATG codon (AAATCATATGCGCGAAAAGGATTATGTCGTAATTATAGG) in a NdeI site (in bold) and a 3′ primer containing the putative stop codon (AAGGATCCTTAATTCAGACATTCTGCGTTCTCCACTAACG) flanked by a BamHI site were used to PCR-amplify genomic DNA from E. coli K12 with Pfu polymerase. A ∼950-bp product was obtained. This fragment was restricted with NdeI and BamHI and ligated in pET-15b. This vector was used to transform E. coli BL21 and checked by sequencing. The resulting bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin. The culture was grown at 37 °C until A600 reached 0.5–0.6. It was then cooled on ice for 20 min, and the inducer isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Hepes pH 7.1, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, 1 mg/ml lysozyme), and submitted to three cycles of freezing and thawing. The bacterial extract was incubated on ice for 1 h with 0.5 mg/ml DNaseI in the presence of 10 mm MgSO4, and centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was recentrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 × g, filtered on a 0.22-μm filter, diluted 2-fold with buffer B (25 mm Hepes pH 7.1, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole), and loaded on a HisSpinTrap column.

Delpierre G. Van Schaftingen E. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The fraction containing YeiN, as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis, was concentrated (using Vivaspin-15), desalted on a PD-10 column equilibrated with buffer D supplemented with 10% glycerol, and stored at –70 °C. Expression and Purification of IndA from T. maritima—A 5′-primer containing an NdeI site (in bold) flanked by a sequence coding for a purification tag (MGSDKIHHHHHH, underlined) and the putative ATG codon (in italics) (GACCGCCATATGGGCAGCGATAAAATCCATCATCATCATCATCACATGATCATAGAAAGCAGGATAGAAA) and a 3′ primer containing the putative stop codon (GACCGCGGATCCTCACGAGCGTTTGAGTTTTACC) flanked by a BamHI site were used to PCR-amplify genomic DNA from T. maritima with Pwo polymerase. A ∼900-bp product was obtained. This fragment was restricted with NdeI and BamHI, and ligated in pET-3a. This vector was used to transform BL21 and checked by sequencing. Expression, preparation of the extract, and purification were performed as described for YeiC, except that the expression was carried out at 18 °C. Measurement of Enzymatic Activities—Activities were assayed spectrophotometrically (340 nm) at 30 °C. Unless otherwise stated, the assay medium (reaction mixture of 600 μl) contained 25 mm Hepes pH 7.1, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The pseudouridine kinase activity of E. coli YeiC was assayed through the production of ADP with a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay. The assay buffer contained 0.5 mm ATP-Mg, 0.25 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.15 mm NADH and different nucleoside concentrations, as well as 10 μg of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase and 10 μg of rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase. The pseudouridine-5′-phosphate glycosidase activity of E. coli YeiN was assayed through the production of ribose 5-phosphate with a ribose-5-phosphate isomerase/ribulose-5-phosphate reductase-coupled assay. The assay buffer contained 50 μm CTP-Mg, 0.15 mm NADPH, 1.7 units/ml ribose-5-phosphate isomerase from spinach, 0.3 units/ml Haemophilus influenzae ribulose-5-phosphate reductase (12Follens A. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Merckx R. van Schaftingen E. van Eldere J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2001-2007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the indicated concentrations of metal ions and nucleotide 5′-monophosphates. The pseudouridine-5′-phosphate glycosidase activity of T. maritima IndA was measured in a two-step assay. The enzyme (7.5 μg/ml) was first incubated for 0, 5, or 10 min at different temperatures (50–90 °C) in an assay medium containing 25 mm Hepes pH 7.1, 0.5 mm CoCl2, and 1 mm PsiMP (final volume: 400 μl). The tubes were transferred on ice to stop the reaction and the formed ribose 5-phosphate was measured spectrophotometrically with spinach ribose 5-phosphate isomerase (1.7 units/ml) and H. influenzae ribulose 5-phosphate reductase (0.3 units/ml), in the presence of 50 μm CTP-Mg, 0.15 mm NADPH, and 1 mm MgCl2 (final volume: 600 μl). Reversibility of the Reaction Catalyzed by YeiN—HPLC assays were used to study the forward and backward reactions of YeiN. The reactions were assayed at 30 °C, in a medium containing 25 mm Hepes pH 7.1, 0.5 mm CoCl2 and 50 μg/ml YeiN, as well as 0.5 mm PsiMP (forward reaction) or 1 mm uracil and 0–1 mm ribose 5-phosphate (backward reaction). The reaction was stopped after 0–120 min by mixing a portion of the incubation medium with 0.25 vol. of cold 10% (w/v) perchloric acid. After neutralization, the samples (50 μl) were analyzed by chromatography on a Partisphere Sax column (4.6 × 125 mm; from Whatman) using a gradient of 0.01–0.5 m NH4H2PO4 (pH 3.7) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. A254 was measured, the reference wavelength being 350 nm. Concentrations were calculated by comparing the integrated peak surfaces with those obtained with titrated solutions of PsiMP and uracil. Synthesis of [14C]Pseudouridine—For the synthesis of [14C]ribose 5-phosphate, 5 μCi of d-[1-14C]ribose was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with 5 μg (25 milliunits) of ribokinase in a solution (final volume: 100 μl) containing 25 mm Hepes pH 7.1, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ribose, and 1 mm ATP-Mg. The incubation was stopped by the addition of 25 μl of ice-cold 10% (w/v) HClO4. After neutralization with K2CO3, the salts were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was diluted with water. The sample (1 ml) was applied onto a 1-ml Dowex 1-X8 column, which was washed with 3 ml of water. [14C]Ribose 5-phosphate was eluted with 6 × 0.5 ml of 0.5 m NaCl. The elution fractions containing radioactivity were pooled. For the synthesis of [14C]pseudouridine, 5 mm uracil and 2.5 × 106 cpm [14C]ribose 5-phosphate were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C in a medium containing 25 mm Hepes pH 7.1, 50 μm CoCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ribose 5-phosphate, and 50 μg/ml YeiN (final volume: 1 ml). The sample was then treated with 1.4 units (1 μg) alkaline phosphatase for 30 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 250 μl of ice-cold 10% (w/v) HClO4. The neutralized perchloric extract was diluted to a volume of 2 ml and phosphorylated with YeiC (2.5 μg/ml) for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 25 mm Hepes pH 7.1, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm ATP-Mg. The reaction was stopped by heating for 5 min at 80 °C. The sample was diluted three times with water and applied on a Q-Sepharose column (3 ml). After washing with 3 ml of water, [14C]PsiMP was eluted with a gradient (100–300 mm) of NaCl. The elution fractions containing radioactivity were pooled (8 ml) and incubated with 1.4 units of alkaline phosphatase for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 25 mm Hepes pH 7.1, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm ZnCl2. The reaction was stopped by heating 5 min at 80 °C, and the preparation was centrifuged to remove denatured proteins. E. coli UTI89 yeiC–—The E. coli UTI89 yeiC– mutants were constructed by transferring the ΔyeiC::kan allele from the Keio collection (13Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2 (2006 0008)Crossref Scopus (5196) Google Scholar) into the UTI89 wild-type strain by P1 transduction. Consumption of [14C]Pseudouridine by E. coli UTI89 Wild Type and yeiC– Mutants—E. coli UTI89 wild-type and mutant strains were precultured overnight in LB medium (containing 100 μg/liter kanamycin for the mutants). The precultures were used to seed LB medium at an A600 of 0.2. When A600 reached 0.5, 1-ml samples were taken and further incubated with [14C]pseudouridine (50,000 cpm) and 100 μm pseudouridine for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and perchloric acid extracts were prepared from the extracellular medium and the cell pellet with 250 μl and 100 μl of ice-cold 10% (w/v) HClO4, respectively. After a 10-min centrifugation at 13,000 rpm, the supernatants were neutralized with K2CO3, and the pellets were resuspended in Soluene-350. Samples of these extracts were counted to determine the acid-soluble and -insoluble radioactivity. The soluble part of the extracellular medium was treated or not with pseudouridine kinase (YeiC) in an incubation medium containing 25 mm Hepes pH 7.1, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP-Mg, or with alkaline phosphatase in the presence of 25 mm Hepes pH 7.1 and 25 mm KCl. The samples were applied onto 1-ml Dowex 1-X8 columns equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes pH 7.1. The columns were washed with 2× 1 ml of 20 mm Hepes pH 7.1, and the retained radioactivity was eluted with a stepwise 0–1 m NaCl gradient. The fractions were counted for radioactivity. Preparation of Pseudouridine 5′-Phosphate—For the synthesis with YeiN, 500 μmol of uracil and 250 μmol of ribose 5-phosphate were incubated in the presence of 25 mm Hepes pH 7.1, 500 μm CoCl2, and 2.5 mg of YeiN for 1 h at 30 °C. The sample was heated for 5 min at 80 °C and centrifuged. The resulting supernatant was diluted 3-fold and loaded onto a 20-ml Q-Sepharose column. The column was washed with 60 ml of water and PsiMP was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–1 m in 150 ml). Fractions containing PsiMP (assayed with YeiN) were pooled, concentrated to a volume of 2 ml, and loaded on a Sephadex G10 fine column (0.9 × 50 cm) equilibrated with water to separate the phosphorylated compound from salts. Fractions containing PsiMP were pooled and freeze-dried for NMR analysis. For synthesis with YeiC, 100 μmol of pseudouridine were incubated in the presence of 25 mm Hepes pH 7.1, 12.5 mm ATP-Mg, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 200 μg of YeiC over 30 min at 30 °C. The sample was heated for 5 min at 80 °C and centrifuged. The phosphorylation product was purified as described above. NMR Analysis of Pseudouridine 5′-Phosphate—Samples (400 μl) containing 10 or 25 μmol of PsiMP in water were adjusted to pH 6.0, mixed with 50 μl of D2O (for locking on the deuterium signal), and placed in 5-mm outer diameter tubes. All spectra were recorded at a constant temperature of 0 °C. 31P NMR spectra were acquired by 1D NMR methods (14Seelig J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 105-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) on a Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer at 202.5 MHz (11.7 Tesla) equipped with a Bruker 5-mm BBI (broad band inverse) probe. Typical Fourier transform spectral parameters were: 45° (6 μs) flip angle, 50 kHz spectral width, 8 K data points, 0.6-s repetition time. 1000 transients were accumulated. Chemical shift values were quoted in parts per million (ppm) and were referenced to the isotropic chemical shift of H3PO4 (0 ppm). 1H1D NMR spectra were obtained with the WATERGATE solvent-suppression pulse sequence (15Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar) on a Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer equipped with a Bruker 5 mm BBI (broad band inverse) probe at 500.2 MHz (11.7 Tesla). Typical Fourier transform spectral parameters were: 90° (7 μs) flip angle, 10 kHz spectral width, 5 K data points, 6-s repetition time. 512 transients were accumulated. Chemical shift values were referenced to the isotropic chemical shift of sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)-propionate-2, 2, 3, 3-d4 (TSP, 0 ppm). Data Base Analysis—Microarray studies indicate that yeiC, which encodes a putative enzyme of the ribokinase/adenosine kinase/pfkB family, is the most overexpressed gene (about 6-fold) when a uropathogenic strain of E. coli is grown on human urine (16Snyder J.A. Haugen B.J. Buckles E.L. Lockatell C.V. Johnson D.E. Donnenberg M.S. Welch R.A. Mobley H.L. Infect Immun. 2004; 72: 6373-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). This suggests that YeiC catalyzes the phosphorylation of a sugar derivative present in urine. Functionally related genes are often associated in operons in bacterial genomes. Genome analysis may therefore provide clues to the function of a putative protein. Analysis of the environment of yeiC homologues in other bacterial genomes disclosed two significant associations (Fig. 1). A first one was with a gene encoding a putative nucleoside transporter, which was found in the genomes of E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus. This suggested that YeiC serves to phosphorylate a nucleoside. The second significant association was with a gene coding for a protein of unknown function, designated YeiN in E. coli and IndA in many other bacterial genomes. Alignments of YeiC and YeiN with some of their homologues are shown in Fig. 2. indA is a gene, which, on the basis of mutational insertion (17Reverchon S. Rouanet C. Expert D. Nasser W. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 654-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) has been proposed to participate in the synthesis of the pigment indigoidine in Erwinia chrysanthemi (see “Discussion”). More recent results indicate, however, that another protein, IndC, has the full capacity of synthesizing indigoidin (18Takahashi H. Kumagai T. Kitani K. Mori M. Matoba Y. Sugiyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9073-9081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), questioning the role of IndA in this process. Interestingly, the IndA homologue of T. maritima has been crystallized and shown to have a new fold (19Levin I. Miller M.D. Schwarzenbacher R. McMullan D. Abdubek P. Ambing E. Biorac T. Cambell J. Canaves J.M. Chiu H.J. Deacon A.M. DiDonato M. Elsliger M.A. Godzik A. Grittini C. Grzechnik S.K. Hale J. Hampton E. Han G.W. Haugen J. Hornsby M. Jaroszewski L. Karlak C. Klock H.E. Koesema E. Kreusch A. Kuhn P. Lesley S.A. Morse A. Moy K. Nigoghossian E. Ouyang J. Page R. Quijano K. Reyes R. Robb A. Sims E. Spraggon G. Stevens R.C. van den Bedem H. Velasquez J. Vincent J. Wang X. West B. Wolf G. Xu Q. Zagnitko O. Hodgson K.O. Wooley J. Wilson I.A. Proteins. 2005; 59: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The association of yeiC with yeiN/indA was found not only in bacterial genomes, but also in eukaryotic sequences. Blast searches indeed indicated the existence in eukaryotes of putative bifunctional proteins comprising a YeiN/IndA N-terminal domain and a YeiC C-terminal domain. Such proteins were found in fish (Danio rerio), birds (Gallus gallus), invertebrates (Drosophila melanogaster, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Caenorhabditis elegans), and fungi (Aspergillus, Schizosaccharomyces pombe), but not in man and other mammals, nor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The association of a putative nucleoside kinase, highly expressed when bacteria are grown in urine, with an enzyme with a novel structure suggested that the product of the reaction underwent an unusual reaction. These considerations led us to hypothesize that these enzymes served to metabolize pseudouridine, one of the most abundant nucleosides present in urine (20Adams W.S. Davis F. Nakatani M. Am. J. Med. 1960; 28: 726-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Both E. coli YeiC and YeiN (IndA) were produced as fusion proteins with a His tag at the N terminus. They were overexpressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity by metal affinity chromatography. YeiC Is a Pseudouridine Kinase—The ability of YeiC to phosphorylate pseudouridine and other substrates was determined by measuring enzymatically the formation of ADP in the presence of different nucleosides and ATP. As shown in Fig. 3, the enzyme converted ATP to ADP in the presence of pseudouridine but not in the presence of uridine, adenosine, guanosine, or cytidine, indicating that it was specific for pseudouridine. The enzyme was dependent on the presence of Mg2+. Its Km for pseudouridine was 120 μm in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP-Mg, and its Km was 330 μm for ATP-Mg in the presence of 200 μm pseudouridine (Fig. 3). HPLC analysis of the products indicated that YeiC converted pseudouridine to a more polar compound, which was retained on the Partisphere Sax column (anion exchanger) and eluted at 5 min. This compound had a similar UV absorption spectrum as pseudouridine, with a peak at 264 nm. It was purified by chromatography on an anion-exchanger column and characterized. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that it had the expected mass (m/z value of 323 for the monodeprotonated species) for a phosphorylated derivative of pseudouridine. 31P and 1H 1D NMR spectra of pseudouridine phosphate were acquired (Fig. 4A) as well as those of pseudouridine and uridine 5′-monophosphate for the sake of comparison (not shown). 31P 1D NMR analysis confirmed that the product was indeed phosphorylated (Fig. 4B). The 1H 1D NMR spectrum of the product (Fig. 4C) was distinctly different from that of UMP (not shown). A major difference was the absence of the resonance corresponding to H5 and appearing as a doublet at 5.95 ppm in the UMP spectrum. Compared with pseudouridine, the chemical shifts of the H5′ and H5″ protons of the product of YeiC were displaced downfield by ∼0.27 ppm (135 Hz) compared with pseudouridine and they appeared as octuplets instead of quadruplets, indicating additional coupling with 31P. This indicated that phosphorylation had occurred on carbon atom C5′ of the ribose moiety (Fig. 4D). We also noted that the H6 chemical shift of pseudouridine 5′-monophosphate was about 7.87 ppm, whereas its value is ≈7.68 ppm in pseudouridine. This shift change can be attributed to the anti conformation adopted by pseudouridine 5′-monophosphate. This pseudouridine 5′-monophosphate H6 chemical shift variation of about 0.2 ppm (100 Hz) is in agreement with previous comparative studies on conformations of uridine, pseudouridine, and their derivatives (21Neumann J.M. Bernassau J.M. Gueron M. Tran-Dinh S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 108: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Dugaiczyk A. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1557-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). YeiN Is a Pseudouridine 5′-Phosphate Glycosidase—We tested the ability of YeiN to convert PsiMP to ribose 5-phosphate and uracil. Ribose 5-phosphate formation was followed using ribose-5-phosphate isomerase and H. influenzae ribulose-5-phosphate reductase (12Follens A. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Merckx R. van Schaftingen E. van Eldere J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2001-2007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of Mn2+, YeiN was found to catalyze the formation of ribose 5-phosphate from PsiMP, though not from any of the four classical ribonucleotide monophosphates (AMP, UMP, GMP, CMP) (Fig. 5A). No consumption of NADPH was observed when ribose-5-phosphate isomerase was omitted from the reaction mixture, indicating that ribose 5-phosphate was formed and not ribulose 5-phosphate. The Km for PsiMP was 60 μm in the presence of 0.5 mm Mn2+. The reaction could also be studied through the formation of uracil by HPLC. A compound with the same elution time as uracil (0.7 min) was formed when the enzyme was incubated with PsiMP. We also determined the metal ion dependence of YeiN. As shown in Fig. 5B, the highest activities were recorded with Fe2+, Co2+, and Mn2+, whereas Zn2+ and, to a lesser extent, Ni2+ behaved as inhibitors. Previous results have indicated that the reaction catalyzed by pseudouridine-5′-phosphate glycosidase (called pseudouridylate synthase in some works) is easily reversible (23Heinrikson R.L. Goldwasser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 1177-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This could indeed be confirmed. Incubation of YeiN with uracil and ribose 5-phosphate followed by HPLC separation led to the appearance of a compound that had the same elution time and UV spectrum as PsiMP. This product was purified by anion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Its analysis by NMR indicated that it had the same 1H and 31P spectrum as the product of YeiC, i.e. pseudouridine 5′-phosphate. In particular, no duplication of the shift corresponding to H1′ was observed (not shown), indicating that only one anomer was present in the preparation. The equilibrium constant of the glycosidase reaction was determined by allowing the hydrolytic reaction or the condensation reaction to proceed until the concentration of the reaction product(s) reached a plateau (Fig. 6). A value of 2.3 × 10–4 m could be calculated for the ratio [Ribose 5-P][Uracil]/[PsiMP] in both cases. From this, a ΔG°' value of + 4.9 kcal/mol was calculated for the hydr"
https://openalex.org/W2084644131,"TSG-6 is an inflammation-induced protein that is produced at pathological sites, including arthritic joints. In animal models of arthritis, TSG-6 protects against joint damage; this has been attributed to its inhibitory effects on neutrophil migration and plasmin activity. Here we investigated whether TSG-6 can directly influence bone erosion. Our data reveal that TSG-6 inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation/activation from human and murine precursor cells, where elevated dentine erosion by osteoclasts derived from TSG-6-/- mice is consistent with the very severe arthritis seen in these animals. However, the long bones from unchallenged TSG-6-/- mice were found to have higher trabecular mass than controls, suggesting that in the absence of inflammation TSG-6 has a role in bone homeostasis; we have detected expression of the TSG-6 protein in the bone marrow of unchallenged wild type mice. Furthermore, we have observed that TSG-6 can inhibit bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2)-mediated osteoblast differentiation. Interaction analysis revealed that TSG-6 binds directly to RANKL and to BMP-2 (as well as other osteogenic BMPs but not BMP-3) via composite surfaces involving its Link and CUB modules. Consistent with this, the full-length protein is required for maximal inhibition of osteoblast differentiation and osteoclast activation, although the isolated Link module retains significant activity in the latter case. We hypothesize that TSG-6 has dual roles in bone remodeling; one protective, where it inhibits RANKL-induced bone erosion in inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, and the other homeostatic, where its interactions with BMP-2 and RANKL help to balance mineralization by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts.

In cartilage-specific TSG-6 transgenic mice, the instigation of antigen-induced arthritis (a model of monoarticular arthritis) resulted in delayed cartilage damage compared with controls, with reduced degradation of aggrecan by matrix metalloproteinases and aggrecanases (34Glant T.T.

Furthermore, there was evidence of cartilage regeneration 4–5 weeks after the onset of disease in these animals. Similar chondroprotective effects were seen in wild type mice where recombinant murine TSG-6 was injected directly into the affected joint in antigen-induced arthritis or intravenously in proteoglycan-induced arthritis (a model of human RA) (33Bárdos T.

The anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effects of TSG-6 observed in these studies are likely to be due to more than one mechanism (22Milner C.M. Higman V.A. Day A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For example, TSG-6 is a potent inhibitor of neutrophil extravasation in vivo (36Wisniewski H.G. Hua J.C. Poppers D.M. Naime D.

In this regard, TSG-6-/- mice develop an accelerated and much more severe form of proteoglycan-induced arthritis than controls, having extensive cartilage degradation and bone erosion, which was attributed to increased neutrophil infiltration and plasmin activity in the inflamed paw joints (35Szántó S. Bárdos T. Gál I. Glant T.T. Mikecz K. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The data presented here demonstrate that TSG-6 inhibits bone erosion by osteoclasts and that this is likely to be mediated via a mechanism that involves its direct interaction with RANKL (the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand), the major regulator of osteoclast activity and of joint destruction in arthritis. We have also shown that TSG-6 binds to osteogenic bone morphogenetic proteins (i.e. BMP-2, -4, -5, -6, -7, -13, and -14) and provide evidence that TSG-6 has a physiological role in bone homeostasis via the regulation of both bone formation and resorption. Preparation of Recombinant TSG-6 Proteins—Full-length recombinant human (rh)TSG-6 was expressed in Drosophila S2 cells and purified as described previously (39Nentwich H.A. Mustafa Z. Rugg M.S.

Effect of TSG-6 on RANKL-induced Human Osteoclast Formation—To determine the effects of TSG-6 on RANKL-induced human osteoclast formation, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy male volunteers (age range 25–35 years) as described in Sabokbar and Athanasou (41Sabokbar A. Athanasou N.A. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 80: 101-111PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, blood was collected in EDTA-treated tubes and diluted 1:1 in α-minimum essential medium (αMEM) (Invitrogen), layered over Histopaque (Sigma-Aldrich), then centrifuged (693 × g), washed, and resuspended in αMEM with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). PBMCs were counted after lysis of red cells with 5% (v/v) acetic acid and seeded (at 5 × 105 cells/well) into 96-well tissue culture plates containing either dentine slices or coverslips. After 2 h of incubation, dentine slices and coverslips were removed from the wells and washed vigorously in αMEM to remove non-adherent cells before transfer into 24-well tissue culture plates containing 1 ml/well αMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 10 mm l-glutamine, antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin), 25 ng/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; R&D Systems Europe), and 50 ng/ml soluble (s)RANKL (PeproTech). After the addition of rhTSG-6 (30.1 kDa (39Nentwich H.A. Mustafa Z. Rugg M.S. Marsden B.D. Cordell M.R. Mahoney D.J. Jenkins S.C. Dowling B. Fries E. Milner C.M. Loughlin J. Day A.J. J. Biol.

Osteoclast formation was assessed cytochemically by determining the number of multinucleated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells after 14 days in culture. Cells on coverslips were fixed in 10% (v/v) formalin and stained using napthol AS-BI as a substrate in the presence of 1.0 m acetate-tartrate; the reaction was stopped with 0.5 m NaF. Bone resorptive activity, an indicator of osteoclast activation, was determined by the measurement of resorption lacunae on dentine slices. After 21 days in culture dentine slices were removed from the wells, rinsed in PBS, placed in 1.0 m NH4OH overnight, and then sonicated for 5–10 min; this resulted in complete removal of cells from the dentine slice, permitting examination of its surface. The slices were washed in distilled water, stained with 0.5% (w/v) aqueous toluidine blue, pH 5.0, and examined by light microscopy. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining was analyzed using ImageJ software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij), whereas for lacunar resorption the data were expressed as the mean percentage area resorbed from four dentine slices per treatment. Each set of experiments was repeated at least three times. Extent of Osteoclast Formation in TSG-6-deficient Mice—TSG-6-/- mice were generated as described previously (27Fülöp C. Szántó S. Mukhopadhyay D. Bárdos T. Kamath R.V. Rugg M.S. Day A.J. Salustri A. Hascall V.C. Glant T.T. Mikecz K.

Age-matched pairs of female TSG-6-/- and wild type (WT) BALB/c mice (between 18 and 25 weeks of age) were used for experiments. All procedures carried out on animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL). Bone marrow cells from the long bones of TSG-6-/- mice were isolated as previously described (42Wani M.R. Fuller K. Kim N.S. Choi Y. Chambers T. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were killed by CO2 inhalation, and the femora and tibiae were aseptically removed and dissected free of adherent soft tissue. The bone ends were cut, and the marrow cavity was flushed out into a Petri dish by slowly injecting αMEM at one end of the bone using a sterile 21-gauge needle. The bone marrow suspension was carefully agitated with a plastic Pasteur pipette to obtain a homogeneous suspension of cells, and these were incubated for 2 h at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml in 96-well plates containing dentine slices. Non-adherent cells were removed from the dentine slices (by vigorous washing in αMEM), which were then transferred to 24-well plates containing αMEM with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated serum and antibiotics (as described above). Cultures on dentine slices were maintained in the presence of 25 ng/ml M-CSF (R&D Systems Europe) and 30 ng/ml murine sRANKL (PeproTech) for 10 days during which the culture media and factors were replenished every 2–3 days. The extent of lacunar resorption was then determined as described above. Micro-computerized Tomography (CT) Analysis of Long Bones from TSG-6-deficient and WT Mice—Micro-CT analysis of the long bones in TSG-6-deficient and WT mouse femurs was performed to determine any differences in trabecular bone; four pairs of age-matched male mice (24–28 weeks) were analyzed. Briefly, plastic-wrapped knees were mounted vertically on a Skyscan 1172 micro-CT scanner and scans (6.77 μm with a voxel resolution of 6.9 μm2) were performed using a 20–100-kV microfocus x-ray source with a 10-megapixel digital x-ray camera. The images obtained were subjected to three-dimensional angular resampling (using Skyscan 3D-creator software), and morphometric parameters were calculated for trabecular regions of interest using a Marching Cubes model (43Lorensen W.E.

Briefly, mouse legs were fixed in 10% (v/v) neutral-buffered formalin for 48 h, skin and muscle tissue were removed, and joints were decalcified in 5% (w/v) EDTA in PBS for 14 days. Specimens were then processed and embedded in paraffin. Thin sections (4 μm) were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and exposed to a rabbit anti-TSG-6 polyclonal antibody (prepared in collaboration with Dr. J. D.

Differentiation into osteoblasts was induced with 100 ng/ml BMP-2 (R&D Systems Europe), and the effects of adding rhTSG-6 (0–10000 ng/ml) or molar equivalents of Link_TSG6 or CUB_C_TSG6 proteins were determined. Cells were cultured for 7 days in a humidified atmosphere with 5% (v/v) CO2 at 37 °C, during which time the culture media (including all factors) was replaced every 72 h. Cells were washed in PBS and freeze-thawed 3 times, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was released by scraping cells into 50 μl of 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (Fluka) and subsequent sonication (5 s at 6 watts). ALP activity (pmol/μl of material) was determined using the fluorescent substrate 4-methyl umbelliferyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich).

https://openalex.org/W2068627571,"Tubulointerstitial inflammation is a common feature of renal diseases. We have investigated the relationship between inflammation and Na+ transport in the collecting duct (CD) using the mCCDcl1 and mpkCDDcl4 principal cell models. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) decreased basal and aldosterone-stimulated amiloride-sensitive transepithelial current in a time-dependent manner. This effect was associated with a decrease in serum and gucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) mRNA and protein levels followed by a decrease in epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) α-subunit mRNA levels. The LPS-induced decrease in SGK1 expression was confirmed in isolated rat CD. This decreased expression of either SGK1 or the ENaC α-subunit was not due to enhanced degradation of mRNA. In contrast, LPS inhibited transcriptional activity of the SGK1 promoter measured by luciferase-reporter gene assay. The effect of LPS was not mediated by inhibition of mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid receptor, because expression of both receptors was unchanged and blockade of either receptor by spironolactone or RU486, respectively, did not prevent the down-regulation of SGK1. The effect of LPS was mediated by the canonical NF-κB pathway, as overexpression of a constitutively active mutant, IKKβ (inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase-β) decreased SGK1 mRNA levels, and knockdown of p65 NF-κB subunit by small interfering RNA increased SGK1 mRNA levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that LPS increased p65 binding to two NF-κB sites along the SGK1 promoter. In conclusion, we show that activation of the NF-κB pathway down-regulates SGK1 expression, which might lead to decreased ENaC α-subunit expression, ultimately resulting in decreased Na+ transport.

It can be divided into two major signaling pathways: the canonical and alternative (non-canonical) pathways. The canonical pathway is the major NF-κB pathway in most cells and is activated by various stimuli including proinflammatory cytokines and bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This pathway is dependent on the nuclear factor κB kinase-β (IKKβ), which phosphorylates IκBα protein and induces its degradation by the proteasome, leading to the release of p65-p50 NF-κB heterodimers. These dimers then translocate into the nucleus and, after phosphorylation and acetylation of p65 and possible cofactor binding, selectively increase or suppress gene transcription. The alternative NF-κB pathway is triggered by various factors such as CD40R, LTβR, and BAFFR and is strictly dependent on protein kinase IKKα activation, leading to regulated cleavage of p100 NF-κB subunit and generation of p52-RelB NF-κB heterodimers. This noncanonical pathway is involved mainly in the maintenance and development of lymphoid organs. In addition to these two pathways, many other NF-κB dimers are formed, such as p50, p65, cRel, and p52 homodimers, or cRel-p65 heterodimers. Among these, p50-p50 and p52-p52 NF-κB homodimers lack a transactivation domain and therefore behave as transcriptional repressors in the absence of the Bcl3 cofactor (reviewed in Refs. 16Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5563) Google Scholar and 17Perkins N.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). Molecular cross-talk between transport signaling and the NF-κB pathway has recently been described. Indeed SGK1, in addition to its major role in transport regulation, has been shown to interact with the canonical NF-κB pathway. SGK1 physically associates with IKKβ leading to activation of the NF-κB pathway in cultured cells (20Zhang L. Cui R. Cheng X. Du J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 457-464PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, GILZ functions as an anti-inflammatory factor, inhibiting the NF-κB pathway (21Ayroldi E. Migliorati G. Bruscoli S. Marchetti C. Zollo O. Cannarile L. D'Adamio F. Riccardi C. Blood. 2001; 98: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 22Berrebi D. Bruscoli S. Cohen N. Foussat A. Migliorati G. Bouchet-Delbos L. Maillot M.C. Portier A. Couderc J. Galanaud P. Peuchmaur M. Riccardi C. Emilie D. Blood. 2003; 101: 729-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Finally, a mutual antagonism between the GR and the NF-κB pathway has been well described (23McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). This led us to hypothesize that a cross-talk exists between the NF-κB pathway and Na+ transport. Our aim was first to test the hypothesis that activation of the NF-κB pathway alters Na+ transport in CD principal cells and then to investigate the molecular pathway involved in this effect. For this purpose, we used both mCCDcl1 and mpkCCDcl4 cells, which display conserved major electrical and regulatory properties of CD principal cells, i.e. high electrical resistance and response to cortico-steroids and vasopressin (4Gaeggeler H.P. Gonzalez-Rodriguez E. Jaeger N.F. Loffing-Cueni D. Norregaard R. Loffing J. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 878-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 24Bens M.

In this work we demonstrate that: 1) basal and aldosterone-stimulated amiloride-sensitive electrogenic ion transport and SGK1 expression are significantly decreased by proinflammatory stimuli independently of MR or GR inhibition; and 2) the canonical NF-κB pathway directly down-regulates SGK1 expression, which may participate in reducing ENaC α-subunit expression, leading altogether to a decrease in sodium transport. Chemicals—Highly purified LPS from Escherichia coli O55:B5 (Calbiochem) was prepared as a 5 mg/ml stock solution in water and stored at -20 °C. Aldosterone, spironolactone, corticosterone, and RU486 (Sigma) were prepared as 10 mmstock solutions in 100% ethanol or DMSO and stored at -20 °C. Cell Culture—mCCDcl1 cells (passages 20-32) and mpkC-CDcl4 cells (passages 20-34) were seeded on permeable filters (Transwell®, Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA), grown to confluence in culture medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum (4Gaeggeler H.P. Gonzalez-Rodriguez E. Jaeger N.F. Loffing-Cueni D. Norregaard R. Loffing J. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 878-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and then maintained in serum- and hormone-deprived medium for 48 h before performing experiments. Isolated Rat Kidney Tubules—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g body weight; Charles River, Saint Germain de l'Arbresle, France) were anesthetized with pentobarbital (5 mg/100 g body weight, intraperitoneal), and the left kidney was perfused with incubation solution (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 4 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm NaH2PO4, 0.15 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm lactate, 1 mm pyruvate, 4 mm essential and nonessential amino acids, 0.03 mm vitamins, 20 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.45) containing 250 μl of collagenase (Blendzyme 2; Hoffmann-La Roche) to hydrolyze interstitial tissue. Afterward, the kidney was removed, sliced into small pyramids, and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in an oxygenated (95% O2 and 5% CO2) incubation solution containing 100 μl of collagenase. Single cortical collecting ducts (CCD) were isolated by microdissection in icecold oxygenated incubation solution and stored in ice-cold medium until used. Each experimental group was constituted by pools of 50 CCDs from the same animal. Electrophysiology—As described previously (9Summa V. Mordasini D. Roger F. Bens M. Martin P.Y. Vandewalle A. Verrey F. Feraille E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47087-47093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the equivalent short-circuit current was calculated according to Ohm's law from the values of transepithelial potential difference and resistance measured with a Millicell (Millipore) device. These measurements were not performed in transiently transfected cells because the electrical resistance of the monolayer could be measured only 6-7 days post-transfection, whereas expression of the transgene and the efficacy of small interfering RNA persisted at best for 3-4 days. Transfection—Transfection was performed by electroporating cells as described previously (25Bustamante M. Hasler U. Leroy V. de S.S. Dimitrov M. Mordasini D. Rousselot M. Martin P.Y. Feraille E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2008; 19: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 × 106 cells were transferred to electroporation cuvettes (Gene Pulser cuvette, 0.4 cm, Bio-Rad) along with 400 μl of culture medium supplemented with 10% serum and 1.2 mmol of RNA interference (RNAi) or 8 pmol of plasmid containing cDNA encoding for enhanced green fluorescent protein, constitutively active IKKβ, β-galactosidase, p105, or p50. Cells were electroporated (300 mV, 960 picofarads) using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser, seeded at a density that allows confluence without division, and allowed to recover for 24 h in culture medium containing 10% serum. Transfected cells were then maintained in serum-free, hormone-deprived medium for another 24 h for RNAi or 48 h for plasmids. RNAi were designed using an Invitrogen design tool. RNAi targeting sense primers were: p65, 5′-GCACCUGCAGUUUGAUGCUGAUGAATT-3′, and scramble RNA, 5′-GCACGUUGAGUUGUAGUCUACCGAATT-3′; c-Rel, 5′-CCUGAUGACCUAGCUAGAAUGGAAATT-3′, and scramble RNA, 5′-CACGUCGUCCGUCUCACCUUAAGUUTT-3′; p105/p50, 5′-GGGAGGAGAUUUACCUUCUCUGUGATT3′, and scramble RNA, 5′-CAGCCGGAUACUUCCAAACUUAAUUTT-3′; SGK1, 5′-GGGCUGUCCUGUAUGAGAUGCUCUATT-3′, and scramble RNA, 5′-CGACACUCCCAUAUCCUCACAGGAATT-3′.

Gosh (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT), and pRSV NF-κB1 (p50) and p105 were generous gifts from Dr N. Perkins (University of Dundee, Scotland, UK). Real-time PCR Analysis—RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and real-time PCR analysis were performed as described previously (25Bustamante M. Hasler U. Leroy V. de S.S. Dimitrov M. Mordasini D. Rousselot M. Martin P.Y. Feraille E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2008; 19: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Primers used for detection of mouse acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 were 5′-AATCTCCAGAGGCACCATTG-3′ and 5′-GTTCAGCATGTTCAGCAGTG-3′; for rat acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0, 5′-CCTTCTCCTTCGGGCTGATC-3′ and 5′-GGGCTGTAGATGCTGCCATT-3′; for mouse αENaC, 5′-CGTCACTGTGTGCACCCTTAA-3′ and 5′-TGATGCGGTCCAGCTCTTC-3′; for mouse Na, K-ATPase α-subunit, 5′-TCCCTTCAACTCCACCAACAA-3′ and 5′-TTTGGGCTCAGATGCATTTG-3′; for mouse SGK1, 5′-CCAAACCCTCCGACTTTCAC-3′ and 5′-CCTTGTGCCTAGCCAGAAGAA-3′; for rat SGK1, 5′-GGGACAACGTCCACCTTCTG-3′ and 5′-CGGCTGCTTATGGAGAACCT-3′; for mouse GILZ1 and -2 isoforms, 5′GGTGGCCCTAGACAACAAGATT-3′ and 5′-GCGTACATCAGGTGGTTCTTCA-3′; for 11β-hydroxysteroid deshydrogenase, 5′-GGCCTATGGTGAAGACTACATTGAG-3′ and 5′-TCAGGCAATGCCATTCTGAGT-3′; for mouse TNFα, 5′-GACCCTCACACTCA GATCATCTTCT-3′ and 5′-CCACTTGGTGGTTTGCTACGA-3′; for mouse IκBα, 5′-CGGAGGACGGAGACTCGTT-3′ and 5′-TTCACCTGACCAATGACTTCCA-3′; for mouse p65, 5′-GGAGTTCCAGTACTTGCC-3′ and 5′-GTCCTTTTGCGCTTCTCT-3′; for mouse c-Rel, 5′-CCAGGGCAAGCTGAACCTTA-3′ and 5′-GTGGGTGATGTGGCAATCC-3′; and for human p105/p50, 5′-GGTGCCTCTAGTGAAAAGAACAAGA-3′ and 5′-GCTGGTCCCACATAGTTGCA-3′. For each pair of primers a dissociation plot resulted in a single peak, indicating that a single cDNA species was amplified. Each primer pair was applied to a 5-fold serial dilution of cDNA. The primers were validated for experiments if the SYBR Green signal was linearly related with the initial amount of cDNA and if the slope of this linear relation was comprised between -3 and -3.4, indicating that during each PCR cycle the starting material was amplified by a factor of 2. Data were analyzed using ABI Prism software (Applied Biosystems) and P0 was used as an internal standard. The -fold difference in cDNA abundance (F) was calculated using the formula F = 2(Ct1 - Ct2) where Ct1 and Ct2 are the number of cycles required to reach the threshold of amplicon abundance for experimental and control conditions, respectively. Western Blot Analysis—After incubation, cells were lysed, and proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore) as described previously (27Carranza M.L. Feraille E. Favre H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C136-C143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SGK1 was detected using polyclonal antibodies at 1/2000 (Sigma) (28Gonzalez-Rodriguez E. Gaeggeler H.P. Rossier B.C. Kidney Int. 2007; 71: 116-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), MR was detected with monoclonal antibody 907 (1/2000) (a kind gift from Dr. C. Gomez-Sanchez, Division of Endocrinology, University of Mississippi Medical Center); GR and PKA catalytic subunit were detected by polyclonal antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) at 1/1000 and 1/10.000, respectively; and p105/p50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), c-Rel, and p65 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) were detected by polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies at 1/1000. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Results were quantified using video densitometer and Scion Image software (Scion Corp.). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—A ChIP assay was performed as described previously (29Ryser S. Fujita T. Tortola S. Piuz I. Schlegel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5075-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, after stimulation cells were fixed rapidly in ice-cold cross-linking solution (1% formaldehyde, 9 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm HEPES, pH 8) before cell lysis (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm Tris, pH 8) and isolation of nuclei by centrifugation. Nuclei were then lysed (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% Sarkosyl, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm Tris, pH 8), and pelleted chromatin was resuspended (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8) before fragmentation (<1 kb) by sonication. For immunoprecipitation, chromatin extracts (100 μg) were precleared for 1 h with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and salmon sperm DNA in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal anti-p65 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4°C. Reversal of cross-link was achieved by overnight incubation at 65 °C with proteinase K and 1% SDS. DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol supplemented with 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 100 μg of glycogen in a final volume of 1.5 ml. Real-time PCR was performed as described above. Primers flanking the proximal NF-κB site (-2488) of the SGK1 promoter were 5′-TCAGAACAGAAAGGCAATAGCA-3′ and 5′-CGGAAAAAGTTAGCCTCCAG-3′; and those flanking the distal NF-κB site (-1975) were 5′-AGTTTATGCAGAATCCAAGCA-3′ and 5′-CTTAGGGTGCCTGAAATTGG-3′. Results were expressed as fold of control (base-line condition). Control experiments were performed either without antibodies (mock) or without genomic DNA fragments (radioimmune precipitation assay buffer). Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—Luciferase plasmid constructs used for transfection were the previously described (30Itani O.A. Liu K.Z. Cornish K.L. Campbell J.R. Thomas C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E971-E979Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) pGL3 Basic, containing 3000 bp of the proximal 5′-flanking region of human sgk1 upstream of exon 1 upstream of the firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase coding sequence (a kind gift of Dr. Christie P. Thomas, University of Iowa), and pRL vector (Promega, Madison, WI), containing the Renilla (Renilla reniformis) luciferase coding sequence downstream of a constitutively active cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV; Promega). Cells were co-transfected with both plasmids, and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The light produced was measured using a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold). The ratio of firefly/Renilla luciferase activity was calculated to normalize results with respect to the efficiency of transfection. Statistics—Results are given as the mean ± S.E. from n independent experiments. Each experiment was performed on cells from the same passage. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between two groups were performed by unpaired Student's t test if not stated otherwise. Multiple group analyses were done using ANOVA and Tukey's test for post hoc analysis. Proinflammatory Stimuli Inhibit Amiloride-sensitive Electrogenic Sodium Transport and Alter SGK1 Expression in CD Cells—We assessed the effect of LPS, a classical activator of the NF-κB pathway, on electrogenic ion transport in mCCDcl1 and mpkC-CDcl4 cells, a second differentiated mouse CD principal cell line (24Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mCCDcl1 cells were treated or not with 100 ng/ml LPS in the absence or presence of 10-6 m aldosterone for 6 h (Fig. 1A). The results show that LPS significantly decreased the transepithelial equivalent short-circuit current (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1A) both in the absence and presence of aldosterone. It should be mentioned however that the equivalent short-circuit current remained stimulated by aldosterone in the presence of LPS. The addition of 10-5 m amiloride to the apical compartment abolished the transepithelial current, indicating that vectorial Na+ transport from the apical to the basolateral compartment accounts for the measured current (data not shown). Fig. 1C shows that LPS induced a time-dependent inhibition of electrogenic sodium transport in mpkCCDcl4 cells. The decrease in transepithelial current was seen together with an LPS-dependent increase of transepithelial resistance in both cell types (data not shown) indicating the absence of cell damage or alteration of tight junction permeability. This increase in transepithelial resistance was most likely because of decreased sodium conductance. Therefore, LPS inhibits vectorial Na+ transport under both basal and aldosterone-stimulated conditions in different types of cultured CD principal cells. In vivo CD cells are exposed to both mineralo- and glucocorticoids. 11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 protects CD cells from occupancy of the MR and thereby stimulation of sodium transport by glucocorticoids. Activation of the NF-κB pathway has recently been demonstrated to decrease 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 expression (31Kostadinova R.M. Nawrocki A.R. Frey F.J. Frey B.M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 650-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) potentially leading to MR occupancy by glucocorticoids and stimulation of sodium transport. We confirmed the decrease in 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 mRNA levels in mCCDcl1 cells treated for 6 h with 100 ng/ml LPS (as percent of control ± S.E.: 50 ± 9, n = 4, p < 0.05). We therefore assessed the effect of physiological doses of mineralo- and glucocorticoids on electrogenic sodium transport by mCCDcl1 cells. In the presence of 10-7 m corticosterone and 10-8 m aldosterone, LPS partially prevented the increase in electrogenic current in mCCDcl1 cells (Fig. 1B). These results show that under conditions mimicking the physiological situation, LPS inhibits CD transepithelial sodium transport. Because LPS inhibits the amiloride-sensitive transepithelial current (mostly, if not exclusively, consisting of ENaC-mediated Na+ transport (4Gaeggeler H.P. Gonzalez-Rodriguez E. Jaeger N.F. Loffing-Cueni D. Norregaard R. Loffing J. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 878-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar)), we assessed mRNA expression levels of genes encoding regulators of CD Na+ transport including early aldosterone-induced genes such as SGK1 and GILZ. Fig. 2A shows that SGK1 expression levels decreased by two-thirds (as percent of control ± S.E.: 100 versus 33 ± 5; p < 0.05) in cells incubated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 6 h. In the presence of 10-6 m aldosterone, LPS induced a relative reduction of the increase of SGK1 mRNA (as percent of control ± S.E.: 1094 ± 250 versus 409 ± 37; p < 0.05). In contrast, basal and aldosterone-induced GILZ1 and -2 (32Soundararajan R. Wang J. Melters D.P. Pearce D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36303-36313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) mRNA levels were not significantly altered by LPS (Fig. 2B). It is well established that aldosterone increases the expression levels of ENaC and Na, K-ATPase α-subunits mRNA in the CD (33Masilamani S. Kim G.H. Mitchell C. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J. Clin.

The formation of SG nucleotides from the thiopurine prodrugs and their subsequent incorporation into nucleic acids are important for the drugs to exert their cytotoxic effects. SG in DNA can be methylated by S-adenosyl-l-methionine to give S6-methylthioguanine (S6mG) and oxidized by UVA light to render guanine-S6-sulfonic acid (SO3HG). Here, we constructed single-stranded M13 shuttle vectors carrying a SG, S6mG, or SO3HG at a unique site and allowed the vectors to propagate in wild-type and bypass polymerase-deficient Escherichia coli cells. Analysis of the replication products by using the competitive replication and adduct bypass and a slightly modified restriction enzyme digestion and post-labeling assays revealed that, although none of the three thionucleosides considerably blocked DNA replication in all transfected E. coli cells, both S6mG and SO3HG were highly mutagenic, which resulted in G→A mutation at frequencies of 94 and 77%, respectively, in wild-type E. coli cells. Deficiency in bypass polymerases does not result in alteration of mutation frequencies of these two lesions. In contrast to what was found from previous steady-state kinetic analysis, our data demonstrated that 6-thioguanine is mutagenic, with G→A transition occurring at a frequency of ∼10%. The mutagenic properties of 6-thioguanine and its derivatives revealed in the present study offered important knowledge about the biological implications of these thionucleosides.

Science. 1996; 273: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) proposed that, after metabolic activation, SG in DNA may kill cells by triggering the post-replicative mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. In this context both SG and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea exhibit delayed cytotoxic effect, and both introduce sister chromatid exchange, which is a type of chromosomal damage associated with post-replicative MMR. In addition, cells that are deficient in the MMR pathway are resistant to both SG and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (10Aquilina G. Zijno A. Moscufo N. Dogliotti E. Bignami M.

Both O6-methylguanine (O6mG) and S6mG can miscode during DNA replication and give rise to O6mG:T and S6mG:T mispairs, which can both be recognized by the post-replicative MMR pathway (9Swann P.F. Waters T.R. Moulton D.C. Xu Y.Z. Zheng Q. Edwards M. Mace R. Science. 1996; 273: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 12Jones M. Wagner R. Mol. Gen.

Therefore, it was proposed that 6-thioguanine exerts its cytotoxic effect via its incorporation into DNA, its subsequent methylation by S-adenosyl-l-methionine, the misincorporation of dTMP opposite S6mG during DNA replication, and the provoking of the post-replicative MMR by the S6mG:T mispair (9Swann P.F.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2501-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, it was found that the removal of methyl group from S6mG by O6-methylguanine DNA alkyltransferase is 106 times slower than the corresponding transfer of a methyl group from O6-methylguanine (9Swann P.F. Waters T.R. Moulton D.C. Xu Y.Z. Zheng Q. Edwards M. Mace R. Science. 1996; 273: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Although a SG:T mispair in duplex DNA can be recognized by mammalian mismatch repair proteins as efficiently as the G:T mispair (15Griffin S. Branch P. Xu Y.Z. Karran P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4787-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the triggering of MMR by SG in DNA was discounted because in vitro replication studies demonstrated that SG in template DNA directs mostly the incorporation of the correct nucleotide, dCMP (9Swann P.F.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether the observations made in these in vitro replication studies can be extended to cells. Unlike natural nucleobases, 6-thioguanine exhibits a UV absorption maximum at 342 nm. Thus, UVA exposure of SG and oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) containing a SG can result in the oxidation of the SG to give guanine-S6-sulfonic acid (SO3HG, Fig. 1) (18O'Donovan P. Perrett C.M. Zhang X.

Montaner B. Perrett C.M. Karran P. Xu Y.Z. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In vitro replication studies with purified DNA polymerases further showed that SO3HG is a strong block to replicative DNA polymerase, and it exhibits ambiguous coding properties; significant misinsertion of dTMP and dAMP opposite the lesion was observed (18O'Donovan P. Perrett C.M. Zhang X. Montaner B. Xu Y.Z. Harwood C.A. McGregor J.M. Walker S.L. Hanaoka F. Karran P. Science. 2005; 309: 1871-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 19Zhang X. Jeffs G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The high mutagenic potential of SO3HG and the UVA-induced formation of reactive oxygen species in SG-treated cells are thought to be associated with the increased skin cancer occurrence in those patients who have undergone azathioprine therapy (18O'Donovan P. Perrett C.M. Zhang X. Montaner B. Xu Y.Z. Harwood C.A. McGregor J.M. Walker S.L. Hanaoka F. Karran P. Science. 2005; 309: 1871-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). It remains elusive, however, to what extent SO3HG can block DNA replication and cause mutations in vivo. In the present study we constructed single-stranded shuttle vectors containing a SG, S6mG, or SO3HG at a defined site and assessed how these thionucleosides perturb the efficiency and fidelity of DNA replication in E. coli cells. Materials—The phosphoramidite building block of 6-thio-2′-deoxyguanosine was obtained from Glen Research (Sterling, VA). Unmodified ODNs used in this study were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Chemicals unless otherwise noted were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. M13mp7(L2) and wild-type Escherichia coli strains were kindly provided by Prof. John M. Essigmann, and polymerase-deficient AB1157 strains (Δpol B1::spec (pol II-deficient), ΔdinB (pol IV-deficient), ΔumuC::kan (pol V-deficient), ΔumuC::kan ΔdinB (pol IV, pol V-double knock-out), and ΔumuC::kan ΔdinB Δpol B1::spec (pol II, pol IV, pol V-triple knock-out)) were generously provided by Prof. Graham C. Walker (21Jarosz D.F. Beuning P.J. Cohen S.E. Walker G.C. Trends Microbiol. 2007; 15: 70-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Preparation of ODN Substrates Containing a 6-Thioguanine or Its Modified Derivatives—ODN substrates containing a SG, S6mG, or SO3HG were prepared following previously published procedures (19Zhang X. Jeffs G. Ren X. O'Donovan P. Montaner B. Perrett C.M. Karran P. Xu Y.Z. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Gu C. Wang Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 22Xu Y. Tetrahedron. 1996; 52: 10737-10750Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the identities of the modified ODNs were confirmed by electrospray ionization-MS and tandem MS (MS/MS) analyses. Construction of ss-M13 Genomes Harboring a Site-specifically Inserted SG, S6mG, or SO3HG—The M13mp7(L2) viral genomes, either lesion-free or carrying a site-specifically inserted SG, S6mG, or SO3HG, were prepared following the previously described procedures (23Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 pmol of ss-M13mp7(L2) was digested with 40 units of EcoRI at 23 °C for 8 h to linearize the vector. Two scaffolds, 5′-GCCCATGGCACTGAATCATGGTCATAGC-3′ and 5′-AAAACGACGGCCAGTGAATTAATTCGG-3′ (25 pmol), each spanning one end of the cleaved vector and the modified ODN insert, were annealed with the linearized vector. The 16-mer insert (d(CCATGGGCXCCGAATT), where X represents a guanine, SG, S6mG, or SO3HG, 30 pmol) was 5′-phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase. The 5′-phosphorylated 16-mer inserts were ligated to the above vector by using T4 DNA ligase in the presence of the two scaffolds at 16 °C for 8 h. T4 DNA polymerase (22.5 units) was subsequently added, and the resulting mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h to degrade the scaffolds and residual unligated vector. The solution was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v), and the aqueous phase was passed through a ProbeQuant-G50 micro column (GE Healthcare) to remove traces of phenol and salt. The constructed genomes were normalized against a lesion-free competitor genome, which was prepared by inserting a 19-mer unmodified ODN to the EcoRI-linearized genome, following the method described by Delaney et al. (23Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transfection of E. coli Cells with ss-M13 Vectors Containing a Guanine, SG, S6mG, or SO3HG—Desalted genomes containing a lesion or unmodified guanine (150 fmol) were mixed with the competitor genome at a molar ratio of 6:1 (lesion/competitor) and transfected into the electrocompetent AB1157 E. coli cells. The M13 genome-carrying E. coli cells were grown in 3 ml of LB culture at 37 °C for 6 h after which the phage was recovered from the supernatant by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The resulting phage was further amplified in SCS110 E. coli cells to increase the progeny/lesion-genome ratio (23Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The phage recovered from the supernatant (700 μl) was passed through a QIAprep Spin M13 kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to isolate the ss-M13 DNA. Determination of the Bypass Efficiency and Mutation Frequency Using Competitive Replication and Adduct Bypass (CRAB) and Restriction Endonuclease and Post-labeling (REAP) Assays—CRAB and REAP assays were carried out according to previously described procedures with some modifications (23Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PCR amplification of the region of interest in the resulting progeny genome was performed by using Phusion high fidelity DNA polymerase. The primers were 5′-YCAGCTATGACCATGATTCAGTGCCATG-3′ and 5′-YTCGGTGCGGGCCTCTTCGCTATTAC-3′ (Y is an amino group), and the amplification cycle was 26, each consisting of 10 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 62 °C, 15 s at 72 °C, with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were purified by using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). For the bypass efficiency assay, a portion of the above PCR fragments was treated with 10 units of NcoI and 1 unit of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (USB Corp., Cleveland, OH) in 10-μl of NEB buffer 2 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) at 37 °C for 2 h followed by heating at 65 °C for 20 min to deactivate the phosphatase. The above mixture was then treated in a 15-μl of NEB buffer 2 with 5 mm dithiothreitol, ATP (50 pmol cold premixed with 1.66 pmol of [γ-32P] ATP) and 10 units of polynucleotide kinase. The reaction was continued at 37 °C for 1 h followed by heating at 65 °C for 20 min to deactivate the polynucleotide kinase. To the reaction mixture was subsequently added 10 units of Tsp509I, and the solution was incubated at 65 °C for 1 h followed by quenching with 15 μl of formamide gel loading buffer containing xylene cyanol FF and bromphenol blue dyes. The mixture was loaded onto a 30% native polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide = 19:1), and products were quantified by phosphorimaging analysis. After the restriction cleavages, the DNA fragment of interest from the full-length replication product was liberated as an 11-mer ODN, d(p*CATGGGCNCCG), where N designates the nucleobase present at the original lesion site after in vivo DNA replication, and p* represents the 5′-radiolabeled phosphate. The 11-mers with a single nucleotide difference could be resolved by 30% native polyacrylamide gel. On the other hand, the corresponding DNA fragment released from the competitor genome was a 14-mer ODN, d(p*CATGGGCATGTCCG). The mutation frequencies were determined from the relative amounts of different 11-mer products from the gel band intensities. The bypass efficiency was calculated using the formula % bypass = (lesion signal/competitor signal)/(non-lesion control signal/its competitor signal) (23Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Identification of Replication Products by Using LC-MS/MS—To identify the replication products using LC-MS, PCR products were treated with 50 units of NcoI and 20 units shrimp alkaline phosphatase in 250 μl of NEB buffer 2 at 37 °C for 2 h followed by heating at 65 °C for 20 min. To the resulting solution was then added 50 units of Tsp509I, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 1 h followed by extraction once with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v), and the aqueous portion was dried with SpeedVac and dissolved in 12 μl of water. The ODN mixture was subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. A 0.5 × 150-mm Zorbax SB-C18 column (5 μmin particle size, Agilent Technologies) was used for the separation, and the flow rate was 8.0 μl/min, which was delivered by using an Agilent 1100 capillary HPLC pump. A 5-min gradient of 0–20% methanol followed by a 35 min of 20–50% methanol in 400 mm 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (pH was adjusted to 7.0 by the addition of triethylamine) was employed for the separation (24Apffel A. Chakel J. Fischer S. Lichtenwalter K. Hancock W. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 1320-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The effluent from the LC column was coupled directly to an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA), which was set up for monitoring the fragmentation of the [M-3H]3– ions of the 11-mer (d(CATGGGCNCCG), where N designates A, T, C, or G), and 14-mer (i.e. d(CATGGGCATGTCCG)) ODNs. Preparation of ODNs Containing a 6-Thioguanine or Its Modification Products—We employed traditional phosphoramidite chemistry and synthesized a SG-containing ODN, d(CCATGGGCSGCCGAATT). As reported previously (22Xu Y. Tetrahedron. 1996; 52: 10737-10750Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), SG in ODNs can be selectively methylated to S6mG by treatment with methyl iodide (CH3I) in a phosphate buffer (pH 8.5). In addition, SG in ODNs can be oxidized selectively to SO3HG upon treatment with magnesium monoperoxyphthalate (19Zhang X. Jeffs G. Ren X. O'Donovan P. Montaner B. Perrett C.M. Karran P. Xu Y.Z. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Gu C. Wang Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 22Xu Y. Tetrahedron. 1996; 52: 10737-10750Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We employed similar procedures and isolated the desired S6mG- and SO3HG-containing ODNs from the reaction mixtures by HPLC. The identities of these thionucleoside-bearing ODNs were confirmed by electrospray ionization MS and MS/MS analyses (supplemental Figs. S1–S3). Replication of 6-Thioguanine or Its Modification Products in E. coli Cells—We next asked how the presence of SG, S6mG, and SO3HG compromises DNA replication and which translesion synthesis-induced DNA polymerase is involved in bypassing the lesion in E. coli cells. To this end we inserted the aforementioned thionucleoside-bearing ODNs into single-stranded M13 genome and assessed the bypass efficiencies and mutation frequencies of these modified nucleosides by using the CRAB and REAP assays introduced by Essigmann and Delaney (Fig. 2) (23Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14051-14056Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 26Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 743-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the absence of deletion mutation, restriction digestion of the PCR products of the progeny M13 genome emanating from in vivo replication affords an 11-mer fragment harboring the site where the SG, S6mG, or SO3HG was initially incorporated. The corresponding digestion of PCR products of the progeny of the competitor genome gives a 14-mer fragment (Fig. 2). The failure to detect radiolabeled fragments with lengths shorter than 11-mer supports that none of the thiopurine derivatives gives rise to deletion mutations (Fig. 3). In this context, we employed 30% (19:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) native polyacrylamide gels to resolve the 32P-labeled fragments, and it turned out that the 11-mers with a single nucleotide difference can be readily resolved from each other (Fig. 3). The bypass efficiencies were calculated from the ratio of the combined intensities of bands observed for the 11-mer products over the intensity of the 14-mer band with the consideration of the ratio of the lesion over competitor genome employed in the initial transfection. The bypass efficiencies for the lesion-carrying genomes were then normalized against that for the control lesion-free genome. It turned out that none of the thiopurine derivatives is a strong block to DNA replication in wild-type AB1157 cells, and the bypass efficiencies for SG, S6mG, and SO3HG are ∼98, 91, and 87%, respectively. In addition, deficiency in pol II, pol IV, or pol V in the isogenic AB1157 background does not considerably affect the bypass efficiencies for these thionucleosides (Fig. 4A). Only a slight drop in bypass efficiency was found for S6mG in AB1157 cells deficient in pol IV (7% drop relative to wild-type cells) or pol V (5% decrease) and for SO3HG in pol V-deficient cells (9% decrease compared with wild-type cells; Fig. 4A). Depletion of both pol IV and pol V results in synergistic decrease in bypass efficiencies; relative to the results obtained for the wild-type cells, a decrease from 91 to 63% was found for S6mG, and a drop from 87% to 48% was observed for SO3HG (supplemental Fig. S4 and Fig. 4A). These data support that both pol IV and pol V are involved to some extent in the bypass of S6mG and SO3HGin E. coli cells. On the other hand, further deletion of pol II did not lead to an increased drop in bypass efficiency, underscoring the lack of involvement of this polymerase in bypassing S6mG or SO3HG. The results from native PAGE analysis also allowed us to measure the mutation frequencies of SG, S6mG, and SO3HGin wild-type and bypass polymerase-deficient E. coli strains with the REAP assay (23Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 743-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The quantification data showed that both S6mG and SO3HG are highly mutagenic in wild-type AB1157 cells, with the G→A transition occurring at frequencies of 94 and 77%, respectively. Somewhat to our surprise, the presence of SG also results in G→A transition mutation at a frequency of 11%. The deficiency in translesion synthesis-induced polymerases did not confer significant alteration in the mutation frequencies for the replication of the three thionucleosides (Fig. 4B). We also employed LC-MS/MS for interrogating the restriction fragments (Fig. 2) (27Hong H. Cao H. Wang Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 7118-7127Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Yuan B. Cao H. Jiang Y. Hong H. Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 8679-8684Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this respect the restriction digestion mixture was analyzed by LC-MS/MS, and we monitored the fragmentation of the [M-3H]3– ions of d(CATGGGCNCCG), where N is an A, T, C, or G. It turned out that only d(CATGGGCGCCG) and d(CATGGGCACCG) could be detected in the digestion mixtures for samples arising from the in vivo replication of SG-, S6mG-, and SO3HG-containing substrates, which is in line with what we found from native PAGE analysis (LC-MS/MS results for monitoring the formation of d(CATGGGCGCCG) and d(CATGGGCACCG) are shown in supplemental Fig. S5). The cytotoxicity of the thiopurine drugs involved the formation of SG nucleotide upon metabolic activation and its subsequent incorporation into DNA (29Gunnarsdottir S. Elfarra A.A. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2003; 31: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In DNA, SG can be methylated by S-adenosyl-l-methionine to form S6mG (9Swann P.F. Waters T.R. Moulton D.C. Xu Y.Z. Zheng Q. Edwards M. Mace R. Science. 1996; 273: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) and converted to SO3HG upon UVA irradiation (18O'Donovan P. Perrett C.M. Zhang X. Montaner B. Xu Y.Z. Harwood C.A. McGregor J.M. Walker S.L. Hanaoka F. Karran P. Science. 2005; 309: 1871-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). By using shuttle vector technology, we showed that although SG, S6mG, and SO3HG in a single-stranded M13 genome do not block considerably DNA replication, the three thiopurine derivatives are mutagenic in wild-type AB1157 E. coli cells, and the mutation frequencies for SG, S6mG and SO3HG are 11, 94, and 77%, respectively. Previous steady-state kinetic measurements showed that the nucleotide insertion by the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I opposite SG is not mutagenic; the polymerase inserts predominantly the correct nucleotide opposite the lesion, with the incorporation of dTMP at a frequency of 0.3% of that for the insertion of dCMP (17Krynetski E.Y. Krynetskaia N.F. Gallo A.E. Murti K.G. Evans W.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This is in stark contrast with an ∼11% G→A mutation observed in E. coli cells. In addition, the exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment was found to insert dTMP opposite S6mG seven times more efficiently than dCMP (13Spratt T.E. Levy D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3354-3361Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); consistently, the insertion of dTMP accounts for 94% of the nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion in E. coli cells. Several factors may contribute to the observed differences for nucleotide incorporation opposite SG with Klenow fragment and in E. coli cells. First of all, DNA replication in E. coli cells may require both pol I and pol III (30Sutton M.D. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8342-8349Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Second, the steady-state kinetic measurements were carried out in the presence of one kind of nucleotide at a time, which is different from in vivo polymerase synthesis conditions where all four nucleotides are mutually present. Indeed our recent LC-MS/MS results showed that when all four natural nucleotides are present, 72, 8, and 15% of the products arising from Klenow fragment-mediated primer extension are full-length replication products carry, respectively, dCMP, dTMP, and dAMP opposite SG (20Gu C. Wang Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Third, in vivo DNA replication is often carried out in the presence of auxiliary protein factors, which can alter both the efficiency and accuracy of nucleotide insertion by DNA polymerases (31Maga G. Villani G. Crespan E. Wimmer U. Ferrari E. Bertocci B. Hubscher U. Nature. 2007; 447: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The observation that SG can introduce high frequency of G→A mutation supports that the presence of 6-thioguanine in DNA can introduce SG:T base pair, which may possibly stimulate post-replicative mismatch repair pathway (32Karran P. Bignami M. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Along this line, it was observed that the SG:T base pair can be recognized by mammalian mismatch repair factors to a similar extent as a G:T mispair (15Griffin S. Branch P. Xu Y.Z. Karran P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4787-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Previously it was estimated that ∼1.6 of 104 SG in DNA are methylated by S-adenosyl-l-methionine to S6mG (9Swann P.F. Waters T.R. Moulton D.C. Xu Y.Z. Zheng Q. Edwards M. Mace R. Science. 1996; 273: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). These results together with the observations that the S6mG:T mispair can be recognized less efficiently than the SG:T mispair by MMR factor (14Waters T.R. Swann P.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2501-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15Griffin S. Branch P. Xu Y.Z. Karran P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4787-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) suggest the possibility that SG may exert its cytotoxic effect by triggering the post-replicative mismatch repair pathway without being converted to S6mG. In this context it is worth emphasizing that the present replication studies are carried out by using E. coli as host; it is important to examine whether the findings made for E. coli can be extended to human cells. In addition, single-stranded genome was employed for the current replication studies, which does not allow for the assessment of the implications of mismatch repair in the cytotoxic effects of SG. Replication studies using bypass polymerase-deficient E. coli cells revealed that both pol IV and pol V are partially involved in the bypass of S6mG, and pol V is involved to some degree in the translesion synthesis of SO3HG. Overall, all the three thionucleosides are not strong blocks to DNA replication. Thus, the biological consequences of these thionucleosides may arise mostly from their mutagenic properties. Since the approval of the thiopurine drugs by Food and Drug Administration in the 1960s, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and 6-thioguanine have been widely used as therapeutic agents in the treatment of a variety of human diseases (1Elion G.B. Science. 1989; 244: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). However, there is a high occurrence of certain cancers in long-term survivors of these patients (33Lindelof B. Sigurgeirsson B. Gabel H. Stern R.S. Br. J. Dermatol. 2000; 143: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 34Euvrard S. Kanitakis J. Claudy A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 35Penn I. Cancer Detect. Prev. 1994; 18: 241-252PubMed Google Scholar). For example, 20 years after transplant, about 60–90% of the patients who have taken azathioprine as an immunosuppressant develop squamous cell carcinoma (36Ramsay H.M. Fryer A.A. Hawley C.M. Smith A.G. Harden P.N. Br. J. Dermatol. 2002; 147: 950-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The oxidation of SGto SO3HG and the high mutagenic potential of the latter as revealed by the present in vivo mutagenesis study may account for the development of cancers in those patients. Different from the traditional REAP assay, which requires the elution of the post-labeled restriction fragments from denaturing PAGE, digestion of the eluted ODN fragments with 5′→3′ exonuclease, and analysis of the resulting 32P-labeled 5′ terminal nucleotide by thin-layer chromatography, here we showed that 30% native PAGE analysis can allow for the direct determination of the identities of the restriction fragments. Nevertheless, it is important to note that it is often necessary, as illustrated in the present study, to confirm the identities of the restriction fragments by an alternative method, i.e. mass spectrometry, particularly when the in vivo replication gives a complicated mixture of products.

https://openalex.org/W2062576240,"Interaction of the mu-opioid receptor (MOP) with selected ligands was investigated in live cells using advanced imaging by confocal laser scanning microscopy integrated with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy. In PC12 cells stably transformed to express the fluorescently labeled MOP-enhanced green fluorescent protein construct, two pools of MOP were identified that could be discriminated by differences in their lateral mobility in the cell membrane. The majority of MOP receptors (80+/-10%) were characterized by a diffusion coefficient D(MOP,1) = (4+/-2) x 10(-11) m(2) s(-1), compared with the slowly moving fraction, D(MOP,2) = (4+/-2) x 10(-12) m(2) s(-1). On stimulation with selected agonists ([D-Ala(2),N-MePhe(4),Gly-ol(5)]enkephalin, enkephalin-heptapeptide Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Arg-Phe, morphine, and methadone), surface density of the MOP decreased, whereas the lateral mobility increased. In contrast, antagonists (naloxone and naltrexone) ""froze"" the receptor in the membrane, i.e., increased MOP surface density and decreased lateral mobility. Agonist activation was also accompanied by pronounced changes in the dynamics of plasma membrane lipids, as revealed by the general lipid marker 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate dye. The results provide new information about MOP activation in live cells at the molecular level, with a special focus on the dynamics of the intricate interplay between this receptor and the surrounding lipids."
https://openalex.org/W1964617248,"The highly negatively charged membrane sialoglycoprotein leukosialin, CD43, is shed during neutrophil activation. This is generally thought to enhance cell adhesion. We here describe two novel consequences of this shedding, during neutrophil activation by phorbol esters or by chemoattractants after TNF-α priming. CD43 proteolysis was investigated by Western blotting, using a polyclonal antibody to CD43 intracellular domain. Our data emphasize the importance of a juxtamembranous cleavage of about 50% of membrane CD43 molecules by cathepsin G. Indeed, it is inhibited by α1-antichymotrypsin and cathepsin G inhibitor I and is reproduced by exogenous purified cathepsin G. The resulting membrane-anchored C-terminal fragment, CD43-CTF, becomes susceptible to presenilin/γ-secretase, which releases CD43 intracytoplasmic domain: preincubation with three different γ-secretase inhibitors, before PMN treatment by agonists or by purified cathepsin G, results in the accumulation of CD43-CTF. Because CD43 binds E-selectin, we also investigated the effect of the soluble extracellular domain CD43s, released by cathepsin G juxtamembranous cleavage, on neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells. A recombinant CD43s-Fc fusion protein inhibited neutrophil E selectindependent adhesion to endothelial cells under flow conditions, while it had no effect on neutrophil static adhesion. We thus propose that, in addition to its potential pro-adhesive role, CD43 proteolysis results in: (i) the release, by cathepsin G, of CD43 extracellular domain, able to inhibit the adhesion of flowing neutrophils on endothelial cells and thus to participate to the natural control of inflammation; (ii) the release and/or the clearance, by presenilin/γ-secretase, of CD43 intracellular domain, thereby regulating CD43-mediated signaling.

The regulated proteolysis of transmembrane proteins represents an important mechanism of cell functions modulation. The inflammation resolution involves, for example, the shedding of cytokine receptors and adhesion molecules, which down-regulates leukocyte adhesion to endothelium. These regulations result from a decreased membrane expression of receptors and/or from the release of soluble fragments, competing with their membrane counterparts. The majority of shed proteins identified to date are cleaved by metalloproteinases or by neutrophil-derived serine proteases (1Garton K.J. Gough P.J. Raines E.W. J. Leuk. Biol. 2006; 79: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Leukosialin, CD43, is the predominant cell surface sialoprotein of leukocytes (2Nathan C. Xie Q.W. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Jin W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and has both anti-adhesive and adhesive properties. Its function has been mainly studied on lymphocytes, where CD43 behaves both as a negative regulator of T cell proliferation and adhesion and as a positive regulator of memory T cell trafficking (3Manjunath N.

Blood. 2007; 110: 2974-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although its expression is normally restricted to leukocytes, CD43 is present on colon carcinomas and on several nonhematopoietic cell lines (5Sikut R. Nilsson O. Baeckstrom D. Hansson G.C. Biochem.

RIP refers to a sequential proteolysis of various type I membrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein of Alzheimer disease, the Notch receptor, CD44, and E-cadherin (8Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Cell. 2007; 131: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). RIP is initiated usually by a metalloproteinase, which induces the shedding of the receptor ectodomain, followed by an intramembrane processing of the cell-bound fragment by a PS/γ secretase. This releases the receptor intracellular domain in the cytoplasm. In the case of CD43 in cancer cell lines, this domain translocates in the nucleus and causes the up-regulation of various genes (9Andersson C.X. Fernandez-Rodriguez J. Laos S. Sikut R. Sikut A.

A soluble form of CD43, CD43s, representing the entire extracellular domain, has been described in plasma and identified to galactoglycoprotein (Galgp) (19Schmid K. Hediger M.A. Brossmer R. Collins J.H. Haupt H. Marti T. Offner G.D. Schaller J. Takagaki K. Walsh M.T. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 663-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). CD43 proteolysis on PMN was claimed to involve serine proteases and metalloproteinases. The precise analysis of the proteolysis mechanism was hampered by the fact that CD43 soluble fragments do not transfer on blotting membranes (15Remold-O'Donnell E. Parent D. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3595-3605PubMed Google Scholar) and required an immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled neutrophil membranes. We produced a polyclonal antibody against a recombinant CD43 intracellular domain to re-assess the molecule proteolysis in the light of recent data on: (i) the γ-secretase processing of CD43 in cancer cells; (ii) the description of CD43 as a leukocyte ligand for endothelial E-selectin. We here describe for the first time, in human PMN activated by pro-inflammatory stimuli, a cathepsin G and γ-secretase mediated processing of CD43 with putative important functional consequences. Antibodies and Reagents—FITC-anti-CD43 mAb (1G10) and IgG1 were from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), anti-CD18 clone IB-4 from Ancell (Bayport, MN), anti-CD62E, FITC-anti-CD62L mAbs, and PE-anti-CD146 from Beckman Coulter (Roissy, France). The rabbit anti-CD43cyto pAb was obtained as described (20Nusbaum P. Laine C. Bouaouina M. Seveau S. Cramer E.M. Masse J.M. Lesavre P. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5843-5853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Human neutrophil elastase (NE), cathepsin G, and proteinase 3 were purified as described (21Renesto P. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Nusbaum P. Lesavre P. Chignard M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4612-4617PubMed Google Scholar). Purified cathepsin G was also purchased from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany) and Athens Technology (Athens, Georgia). Human IgGs were purified on protein A-Sepharose from an AB blood group normal human serum. The CD43s-Fc fusion protein was produced in COS cells, as described (22Sawada R. Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1425-1431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified on protein A-Sepharose. Tumor necrosis factor α, TNF-α, was from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Recombinant human VCAM-1-Fc was from R&D (Abingdon, UK). α1-anti-chymotrypsin (α1-CT), cathepsin G inhibitor I, and MG-132 were from Calbiochem, Compound E from Alexis (Lausanne, Switzerland), Tapi-0, and Tapi-1 from Peptides International (Louisville, KY), while Marimastat, CH46644 and CH6631 were a kind gift from Dr. John Bird (Celltech Chiroscience, Cambridge, UK). All other inhibitors and reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. Cells—Human neutrophils and endothelial cells HUVEC were isolated as described (20Nusbaum P. Laine C. Bouaouina M. Seveau S. Cramer E.M.

Neutrophils were suspended in Hanks balanced solution with Ca2+ and Mg2+ containing bovine serum albumin (0.1%, HBSS2+-BSA). In our hands, this BSA concentration has no effect on CD43 proteolysis (2Nathan C. Xie Q.W. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Jin W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). HUVECs were cultured on gelatin-coated flasks (Costar Corporation, Cambrige, MA) in M199 supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, l-glutamine, Hepes (10 mm), heparin (50 μg/ml), endothelial cell growth supplement ECGS (20 μg/ml), and 20% fetal calf serum. 3rd- and 4th passage cells were used exclusively. CHO cells were either transiently transfected with CD43 cDNA or stably transfected with cDNAs encoding both CD43 and core 2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase (C2GnT), as described (24Bierhuizen M.F. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4473-4479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), then further transiently transfected to enhance protein expression. Neutrophil Activation, Flow Cytometry, and Western Blotting—Freshly isolated neutrophils were distributed in BSA-coated tubes and gently tumbled every 5 min during their activation at 37 °C either with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or with TNF-α and N-formyl-l-methionyl-l-leucyl-l-phenylalanine (fMLP), as described in the figure legends. The reaction was stopped by adding ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and 1,10-phenanthroline (1 mm), to prevent any further CD43 cleavage. PMN were centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 s at 3,800 × g and submitted to Western blotting or flow cytometry as described (20Nusbaum P. Laine C. Bouaouina M. Seveau S. Cramer E.M. Masse J.M. Lesavre P. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5843-5853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Assays for PMN Adhesion to HUVEC—Static adhesion: confluent HUVECs, subcultured in 48-well 0.5% gelatin-coated plates, were pretreated for 4 h with 10 ng/ml TNF-α and rinsed with medium. PMN were then added (2 × 106 per ml of M199 with 0.1% BSA) and allowed to adhere for 30 min at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed by rinsing and adherent PMN and HUVEC were detached with 0.5 mg/ml collagenase for 15 min at 37 °C. They were then labeled with PE-anti-CD146, to distinguish CD146-negative PMN from CD146-positive endothelial cells. PMN were counted by flow cytometry with a constant time setting. Flow Assay—Cell adhesion was analyzed, as described (25Legendre P. Salsmann A. Rayes J. Trassard O. Kieffer N. Baruch D. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 236-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), by real-time videomicroscopy with a ×10 objective, in a flow chamber containing a 0.5% gelatin-precoated glass coverslip with confluent HUVECs, which had been stimulated for 4 h with 0.2 ng/ml TNF-α and washed to remove the TNF-α. Controlled flow rates, generating a wall shear rate of 100 s–1, were applied alternatively to two syringes, resulting in sequential perfusion of 37 °C warmed HBSS2+-BSA and PMN suspension (2 × 106/ml), for 4 min each, over the endothelial cells layer. This was followed by a period of washout with warm buffer, and video microscopic recordings were made between minutes 1 and 2, as described (26Radford D.J. Luu N.T. Hewins P. Nash G.B. Savage C.O. Arth. Rheum. 2001; 44: 2851-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The Histolab software (Microvision Instruments, Evry, France) allowed quantifying the number of adherent cells visible in at least three fields. Statistical Analysis—Data were compared using a paired Student's t test analysis. Statistical significance was defined as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001. Cell-associated CD43 Fragments Analyzed by Western Blotting—Confirming a previous report (15Remold-O'Donnell E. Parent D. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3595-3605PubMed Google Scholar), we observed that extracellular soluble CD43 fragments fail to transfer onto blotting membranes, whatever membrane (nitrocellulose, polyvinylidene difluoride, positively charged PALL membranes), blotting buffer (pH 4–11), or anti-CD43 mAb clones (L60, MEM59, 1G10) were used. We thus raised an anti-CD43cyto intrapolyclonal antibody to analyze by Western blotting the fragments containing CD43 intracellular domains and remaining membrane-anchored after proteolysis. The antibody specificity was analyzed by Western blot with CHO cell lines transfected with CD43 without and with Core2GnT, resulting in bands corresponding to the previously reported 115- and 130-kDa glycosylated forms of CD43 (24Bierhuizen M.F. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4473-4479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Analysis of PMA-activated PMN (Fig. 1B) confirmed previous data, because it revealed cell-associated fragments complementary in size to the reported soluble CD43 fragments observed by immunoprecipitation of 125I-labeled neutrophils (15Remold-O'Donnell E. Parent D. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3595-3605PubMed Google Scholar, 27Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Bessou G. Lesavre P. Renesto P. Chignard M. Blood. 1996; 87: 1200-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): (i) a cell-bound 90-kDa doublet, resulting from clip A (Fig. 1C) and complementary to the reported soluble 50-kDa doublet; (ii) a cell-bound CD43 C-terminal fragment, CD43-CTF, of 25 kDa, resulting from clip B and complementary to the reported soluble 120-kDa fragment. The intensity of the 90-kDa doublet was variable and appeared to be related to the “spontaneous” activation of PMN during the isolation procedure: As we had observed with the soluble 50-kDa doublet (27Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Bessou G. Lesavre P. Renesto P. Chignard M. Blood. 1996; 87: 1200-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was often observed on freshly isolated PMN, appeared upon incubation at cell concentrations above 106/ml without any stimuli, and was significantly prevented by avoiding the lysis of contaminating erythrocytes and by the presence of 1 mg/ml BSA in incubation medium. It is not known whether the doublet represents two very close split sites, or a single split resulting in fragments that differ by post-translational modifications such as glycosylation. Kinetic studies showed that the small 25-kDa CD43-CTF appeared later than the 90-kDa doublet and was the main fragment after 30 min of incubation (Fig. 1B). PMN activation by TNF-α (10 ng/ml) or fMLP (10–6 m) did not modify significantly CD43, as mentioned previously (14Rieu P. Porteu F. Bessou G. Lesavre P. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 3021-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), while priming with 5 ng/ml TNF-α for 30 min, followed by 30 min of activation with fMLP (10–6 m) resulted in CD43 cleavage similar to PMA, but the 25-kDa CD43-CTF was either weakly present or not detected (Fig. 1B). CD43 Proteolysis in Plasma—Western blot analysis confirmed that plasma inhibits CD43 proteolysis (Fig. 2A). It significantly prevented the decrease of the CD43 full-length band, and the appearance of CD43 fragments promoted by high PMA concentrations (100 ng/ml) or, to a lesser extent, by TNF-α (5 ng/ml) with fMLP (10–6 m). This inhibition, not modified by plasma heat-inactivation (30 min, 56 °C), was impressive but not complete. Although neutrophil activation in plasma resulted in little or no increase of the 90-kDa doublet, as compared with control cells in buffer, some 25-kDa CD43-CTF appeared with plasma/PMA-activated cells (Fig. 2A). This suggests that plasma efficiently protects the extended extracellular domain of CD43 from proteolysis, while the juxtamembranous cleavage site is less accessible to plasma inhibitors. Sample loads of Fig. 2A blots, aimed to detect the 25-kDa CD43-CTF fragment, resulted in saturating signals for the full-length CD43 band. However, serial dilutions of PMN lysates showed a significant decrease of full-length CD43 band intensities upon activation in plasma with PMA and TNF/fMLP, respectively (Fig. 2B). Role of Neutrophil Serine Proteases in CD43 Shedding—Inhibition of CD43 proteolysis may involve plasma protease inhibitors. Because the main plasma serpins are α1-proteinase inhibitor α1-PI and α1-anti-chymotrypsin α1-CT, we analyzed the effects of these inhibitors on CD43 proteolysis. Western blotting analysis revealed that whereas α1-PI does not seem to prevent any cleavage, α1-CT inhibits the degradation of a newly appearing 70-kDa fragment and decreases the intensity of the 25-kDa CD43-CTF (Fig. 3A). α1-PI is known to inhibit all the serine proteases released by PMN upon PMA-triggered degranulation, namely elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3, PR3, with the highest affinity for elastase. By contrast, α1-CT inhibits cathepsin G but neither elastase nor PR3 (28Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). These results thus proposed cathepsin G as a candidate for the cleavage of the 70-kDa fragment into a 25-kDa cell-bound CTF. Flow cytometry analysis of CD43 membrane expression, after neutrophil incubation with exogenous purified serine proteases, showed no significant cleavage by PR3, while elastase and cathepsin G resulted in up to 80 and 40% CD43 down-regulation respectively (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3A and in agreement with previous data (29Remold-O'Donnell E. Parent D. Blood. 1995; 86: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Western blot analysis of PMN incubated with purified elastase resulted in a 90-kDa doublet, similar to that observed with PMA. Elastase also produced a 70-kDa fragment. Interestingly, cathepsin G promoted a juxtamembranous cleavage, leaving a 25-kDa cell-associated fragment analogous to the CD43-CTF observed after PMN activation by PMA (Fig. 3A). Data shown in Fig. 3A were obtained with our homemade cathepsin G preparation, but identical results were obtained with two commercial cathepsin G (data not shown). Finally, the specific cathepsin G inhibitor 1 (10 μm) partially inhibited the appearance of the 25-kDa CD43-CTF resulting from PMA activation Fig. 3C). We thus propose (Fig. 3D) that PMA-induced CD43 proteolysis includes: (i) clips A and C, mediated by elastase-like enzyme(s) and resulting in 90- and 70-kDa membrane-spanning fragments, respectively; (ii) a juxtamembranous clip B, presumably mediated by cathepsin G, producing the 25-kDa CD43-CTF. Our results also show that clip C appears to be followed immediately by clip B and thus only detected if clip B is prevented by α1-CT. Role of Presenilin/γ-Secretase (PS/γ-Secretase)—In cancer cells, an intramembrane cleavage of CD43 by PS/γ-secretase has been described (7Andersson C.X. Fernandez-Rodriguez J. Laos S. Baeckstrom D. Haass C. Hansson G.C. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We thus investigated a possible role of γ-secretase in CD43 processing in neutrophils. In most instances, RIP-induced intracytoplasmic fragments are difficult to individualize, either because they translocate to the nucleus or because they are degraded by the proteasome. PS/γ-secretase activity is thus indirectly measured by the accumulation of membrane CTF in the presence of γ-secretase inhibitors. The presence of three different inhibitors of γ-secretase, L685,458, MG132, or compound E, during neutrophil activation by PMA (Fig. 4A), significantly increased the amount of the 25-kDa CD43-CTF observed on Western blots. Moreover, in the presence of γ-secretase inhibitors, the 25-kDa CD43-CTF now appeared on Western blots from neutrophils activated by TNF/fMLP (Fig. 4B). Neutrophil incubation with γ-secretase inhibitors in the absence of agonist did not produce any CD43-CTF fragment (data not shown). γ-Secretase inhibition thus reveals the occurrence of a juxtamembranous cleavage, upon PMN activation by TNF/fMLP, which was not detected normally, because of CD43-CTF rapid degradation by γ-secretase. We did not detect smaller putative intracytoplasmic fragments resulting from this further degradation, even when cell pellets were immediately boiled in Laemmli buffer to solubilize nuclear proteins before Western blot analysis (data not shown). Absence of Metalloproteinase Involvement in CD43 Shedding—RIP intramembranous proteolysis is usually triggered by matrix metalloproteinases, MMPs. We thus tested the effects of various MMP inhibitors on CD43 shedding. PMA-induced CD43 cleavage was not inhibited by metalloproteinase inhibitors, such as TAPI-0, TAPI-1, and CH4644 and CH6631, that block various MMPs, including MMP8 and MMP9 (data not shown) and the broad MMP and TACE inhibitor marimastat (BB 2516) (Fig. 5, A and D). In parallel experiments, marimastat efficiently blocked the shedding of L-selectin (CD62L) on the same cells (Fig. 5B). CD43 down-regulation was inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline (Fig. 5, C and D), but also by the inactive analogue 1,7-phenanthroline (Fig. 5C), confirming previous data (17Bazil V. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1314-1322PubMed Google Scholar) and suggesting an effect unrelated to metalloproteinase inhibition. Metalloproteinases thus do not seem to be involved in PMA-induced cleavage. CD43 Is Processed by Presinilin/γ-Secretase as a Consequence of Cathepsin G Cleavage—We thus wondered if cathepsin G could fulfill the function of MMPs in the RIP processing and prepare CD43 for γ-secretase processing. As shown in Fig. 6A, exogenous purified cathepsin G resulted in a CD43-CTF fragment, which was further degraded byγ-secretase. Indeed, the intensity of the CD43-CTF fragment, resulting from increasing doses of cathepsin G, was further enhanced by PMN preincubation with γ-secretase inhibitor compound E (97.3 ± 64.6% increase, n = 7, p = 0.007). To exclude the effects of putative enzymes contaminating our cathepsin G preparations, we repeated these experiments with two commercial cathepsin G sources and obtained the same results (data not shown). By contrast, the intensities of CD43 fragments released by exogenous elastase were not modified by compound E (Fig. 6A). Finally, CD43-CTF fragments appearing upon PMN treatment by cathepsin G, in the presence of the γ-secretase inhibitor, disappeared completely in the presence of the specific cathepsin G inhibitor I, but were not affected by the MMP inhibitor marimastat (Fig. 6B). This result shows that the cleavage of CD43 by purified cathepsin G, in the absence of any PMN agonist, is sufficient to allow CD43 further processing by PS/γ-secretase. Role of Presinilin/γ-Secretase in the Regulation of Neutrophil Functions—γ-Secretase inhibitors had no effect on neutrophil degranulation, promoted by PMA or TNF/fMLP, reflected by CD11b up-regulation, as measured by flow cytometry (n = 5, data not shown). They had no effect either on the oxidative burst, measured with the fluorescent probe 2′-7′-dichlorofluorescein hydrodiacetate (n = 5, data not shown). By contrast, all threeγ-secretase inhibitors significantly inhibited neutrophil adhesion to gelatin, promoted either by TNF/fMLP or by PMA (Fig. 7). Modulation of PMN Adhesion to Endothelial Cells by CD43s, the Soluble Ectodomain of CD43 Released after Cell Activation—We tested the effect of a recombinant chimeric Fc-CD43s molecule on neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells. To preserve the function of the natural molecule, CD43s was expressed in COS cells, which contain the enzymatic machinery required for a post-translational glycosylation similar to neutrophils (24Bierhuizen M.F. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4473-4479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used 10–30 μg/ml Fc-CD43s, based on normal plasma CD43s (Galgp) concentration, previously estimated at 10 μg/ml (19Schmid K. Hediger M.A. Brossmer R. Collins J.H. Haupt H. Marti T. Offner G.D. Schaller J. Takagaki K. Walsh M.T. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 663-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, a homemade sandwich ELISA, using anti-CD43-coated plates and biotinylated wheat germ agglutinin and standardized with the recombinant Fc-CD43s protein, resulted in a mean of 7 ± 6.7 μg/ml of CD43s in normal plasma (n = 7, data not shown). Our results show that Fc-CD43s has no effect on PMN static adhesion to extracellular matrix (gelatin, fibronectin, data not shown) or to TNF-activated endothelial cells (Fig. 8A). We confirmed with blocking antibodies that this adhesion is β2 integrin-dependent but E-selectin-independent. By contrast, PMN adhesion to TNF-activated HUVECs under flow conditions, partially prevented by anti-E-selectin antibodies, was also significantly inhibited by 10 μg/ml Fc-CD43s, when compared with human IgGs purified from an AB normal serum, as a control for the Fc portion (Fig. 8B). The inhibition level was the same with 10 μg/ml and 30 μg/ml CD43s (data not shown). In similar conditions, 10 μg/ml recombinant Fc-VCAM-1 had no effect on PMN adhesion (Fig. 8B). These results suggest that CD43s i"
https://openalex.org/W2090406972,"The majority of mutations that cause isolated growth hormone deficiency type II are the result of aberrant splicing of transcripts encoding human growth hormone. Such mutations increase skipping of exon 3 and encode a 17.5-kDa protein that acts as a dominant negative to block secretion of full-length protein produced from unaffected alleles. Previously, we identified a splicing regulatory element in exon 3 (exonic splicing enhancer 2 (ESE2)), but we had not determined the molecular mechanism by which this element prevents exon skipping. Here, we show that two members of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein superfamily (ASF/SF2 and SC35) act antagonistically to regulate exon 3 splicing. ASF/SF2 activates exon 3 inclusion, but SC35, acting through a region just downstream of ESE2, can block such activation. These findings explain the disease-causing mechanism of a patient mutation in ESE2 that creates a functional SC35-binding site that then acts synergistically with the downstream SC35 site to produce pathological levels of exon 3 skipping. Although the precedent for SR proteins acting as repressors is established, this is the first example of a patient mutation that creates a site through which an SR protein represses splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2161146012,Huntington disease derives from a critically expanded polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin (Htt) protein; a similar polyglutamine expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) causes spinobulbar muscular atrophy. AR activity also plays an essential role in prostate cancer. Molecular mechanisms that regulate Htt and AR degradation are not well understood but could have important therapeutic implications. We find that a pentapeptide motif (FQKLL) within the Htt protein regulates its degradation and subcellular localization to cytoplasm puncta. Disruption of the motif by alanine substitution at the hydrophobic residues increases the steady state level of the protein. Pulsechase analyses indicate that the motif regulates degradation. A similar motif (FQNLF) has corresponding activities in the AR protein. Transfer of the Htt motif with five flanking amino acids on either side to YFP reduces the steady state YFP level by rendering it susceptible to proteasome degradation. This work defines a novel proteasome-targeting motif that is necessary and sufficient to regulate the degradation of two disease-associated proteins.
https://openalex.org/W1999425838,"Interleukin-3 (IL-3) regulates cell growth by affecting various processes such as cell death, survival, and proliferation. Cues from the external environment are sensed by surface receptors, and complex signaling mechanisms arise within the cells, leading to specific functional outcomes. In this study, we demonstrate that the cytokine IL-3 induces the activation of the Ca(2+)-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin (Cn). Furthermore Cn dephosphorylates Gab2, resulting in c-fos activation and cell proliferation. We also report that there is a direct interaction between Cn and Gab2 upon IL-3 stimulation, and Akt can regulate this interaction."
