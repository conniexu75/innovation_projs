https://openalex.org/W3038133190,"Heterotrimeric G-proteins (Gαβγ) are the main transducers of signals from GPCRs, mediating the action of countless natural stimuli and therapeutic agents. However, there are currently no robust approaches to directly measure the activity of endogenous G-proteins in cells. Here, we describe a suite of optical biosensors that detect endogenous active G-proteins with sub-second resolution in live cells. Using a modular design principle, we developed genetically encoded, unimolecular biosensors for endogenous Gα-GTP and free Gβγ: the two active species of heterotrimeric G-proteins. This design was leveraged to generate biosensors with specificity for different heterotrimeric G-proteins or for other G-proteins, such as Rho GTPases. Versatility was further validated by implementing the biosensors in multiple contexts, from characterizing cancer-associated G-protein mutants to neurotransmitter signaling in primary neurons. Overall, the versatile biosensor design introduced here enables studying the activity of endogenous G-proteins in live cells with high fidelity, temporal resolution, and convenience."
https://openalex.org/W3039672530,"Accurate identification of crop varieties grown by farmers is crucial, among others, for crop management, food security and varietal development and dissemination purposes. One may expect varietal identification to be more challenging in the context of developing countries where literacy and education are limited and informal seed systems and seed recycling are common. This paper evaluates the extent to which smallholder farmers misidentify their wheat varieties in Ethiopia and explores the associated factors and their implications. The study uses data from a nationally representative wheat growing sample household survey and DNA fingerprinting of seed samples from 3,884 wheat plots in major wheat growing zones of Ethiopia. 28–34% of the farmers correctly identified their wheat varieties. Correct identification was positively associated with farmer education and seed purchases from trusted sources (cooperatives or known farmers) and negatively associated with seed recycling. Farmers’ varietal identification thereby is problematic and leads to erroneous results in adoption and impact assessments. DNA fingerprinting can enhance varietal identification but remains mute in the identification of contextual and explanatory factors. Thus, combining household survey and DNA fingerprinting approaches is needed for reliable varietal adoption and impact assessments, and generate useful knowledge to inform policy recommendations related to varietal replacement and seed systems development."
https://openalex.org/W3040243154,"Cardiolipin (CL) is the signature phospholipid of mitochondrial membranes, where it is synthesized locally and plays an important role in mitochondrial bioenergetics. Previous studies in the yeast model have indicated that CL is required for optimal iron homeostasis, which is disrupted by a mechanism not yet determined in the yeast CL mutant, crd1Δ. This finding has implications for the severe genetic disorder, Barth syndrome (BTHS), in which CL metabolism is perturbed because of mutations in the CL-remodeling enzyme, tafazzin. Here, we investigate the effects of tafazzin deficiency on iron homeostasis in the mouse myoblast model of BTHS tafazzin knockout (TAZ-KO) cells. Similarly to CL-deficient yeast cells, TAZ-KO cells exhibited elevated sensitivity to iron, as well as to H2O2, which was alleviated by the iron chelator deferoxamine. TAZ-KO cells exhibited increased expression of the iron exporter ferroportin and decreased expression of the iron importer transferrin receptor, likely reflecting a regulatory response to elevated mitochondrial iron. Reduced activities of mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster enzymes suggested that the mechanism underlying perturbation of iron homeostasis was defective iron–sulfur biogenesis. We observed decreased levels of Yfh1/frataxin, an essential component of the iron–sulfur biogenesis machinery, in mitochondria from TAZ-KO mouse cells and in CL-deleted yeast crd1Δ cells, indicating that the role of CL in iron–sulfur biogenesis is highly conserved. Yeast crd1Δ cells exhibited decreased processing of the Yfh1 precursor upon import, which likely contributes to the iron homeostasis defects. Implications for understanding the pathogenesis of BTHS are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3041684278,"As global ocean-bound commerce increases, managing human activities has become important in reducing conflict with threatened wildlife. This study investigates environmental factors determining abundance and distribution of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and their prey (Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera) in central California. We provide insights into environmental drivers of the ecology and distribution of these species, model whale distributions and determine coincident hotspots of whales and their prey that will help decrease human threats to whales and protect critical feeding habitat. We developed separate predictive models of whale abundances (using negative binomial regression on count data) and krill abundance (using a two-part hurdlemodel combining logistic and negative binomial regressions) over a 14 year period (2004-2017). Variables included in situ surface and midwater oceanographic measures (temperature, salinity, and fluorescence), basin-scale climate indices, and bathymetric- and distance-related data. Predictions were applied to 1 km2 cells spanning the study area for May, June, July, and September during each of the 14 years of surveys to identify persistent distribution patterns. Both whales and krill were found to consistently use the northeast region of Cordell Bank, the Farallon Escarpment, and the shelf-break waters. The main identified blue whale hotspots were also krill hotspots, while co-occurrence was more limited and varied seasonally for humpback whales and krill. These results are valuable in identifying patterns in important areas of ecological interaction to assist management of whales. Areas north of Cordell Bank are of particular management concern since they overlap with the end of the San Francisco Bay northern shipping lane. Our findings can help decrease threats to whales, particularly in important foraging areas, by supporting implementation of vessel management and informing potential conflicts with other human uses."
https://openalex.org/W3038971645,"Low egg quality and embryonic survival are critical challenges in aquaculture, where assisted reproduction procedures and other factors may impact egg quality. This includes European eel (Anguilla anguilla), where pituitary extract from carp (CPE) or salmon (SPE) is applied to override a dopaminergic inhibition of the neuroendocrine system, preventing gonadotropin secretion and gonadal development. The present study used either CPE or SPE to induce vitellogenesis in female European eel and compared impacts on egg quality and offspring developmental competence with emphasis on the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). Females treated with SPE produced significantly higher proportions of floating eggs with fewer cleavage abnormalities and higher embryonic survival. These findings related successful embryogenesis to higher abundance of mRNA transcripts of genes involved in cell adhesion, activation of MZT, and immune response (dcbld1, epcam, oct4, igm) throughout embryonic development. The abundance of mRNA transcripts of cldnd, foxr1, cea, ccna1, ccnb1, ccnb2, zar1, oct4, and npm2 was relatively stable during the first eight hours, followed by a drop during MZT and low levels thereafter, indicating transfer and subsequent clearance of maternal mRNA. mRNA abundance of zar1, epcam, and dicer1 was associated with cleavage abnormalities, while mRNA abundance of zar1, sox2, foxr1, cldnd, phb2, neurod4, and neurog1 (before MZT) was associated with subsequent embryonic survival. In a second pattern, low initial mRNA abundance with an increase during MZT and higher levels persisting thereafter indicating the activation of zygotic transcription. mRNA abundance of ccna1, npm2, oct4, neurod4, and neurog1 during later embryonic development was associated with hatch success. A deviating pattern was observed for dcbld1, which mRNA levels followed the maternal-effect gene pattern but only for embryos from SPE treated females. Together, the differences in offspring production and performance reported in this study show that PE composition impacts egg quality and embryogenesis and in particular, the transition from initial maternal transcripts to zygotic transcription."
https://openalex.org/W3041779359,"Ectopic cardiovascular calcification is a highly prevalent pathology for which there are no effective novel or repurposed pharmacotherapeutics to prevent disease progression. We created a human calcification endophenotype module (ie, the “calcificasome”) by mapping vascular calcification genes (proteins) to the human vascular smooth muscle-specific protein-protein interactome (218 nodes and 632 edges, P < 10−5). Network proximity analysis was used to demonstrate that the calcificasome overlapped significantly with endophenotype modules governing inflammation, thrombosis, and fibrosis in the human interactome (P < 0.001). A network-based drug repurposing analysis further revealed that everolimus, temsirolimus, and pomalidomide are predicted to target the calcificasome. The efficacy of these agents in limiting calcification was confirmed experimentally by treating human coronary artery smooth muscle cells in an in vitro calcification assay. Each of the drugs affected expression or activity of their predicted target in the network, and decreased calcification significantly (P < 0.009). An integrated network analytical approach identified novel mediators of ectopic cardiovascular calcification and biologically plausible candidate drugs that could be repurposed to target calcification. This methodological framework for drug repurposing has broad applicability to other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3038175414,"The implementation of multiple drives for belt conveyors can solve the problems associated with motor overpower and the excessive tension of conveyor belts powered by a single drive. However, multiple drives can suffer from uneven driving power allocation. Among various factors, the selection of the type of conveyor belt particularly affects the power allocation. The current study aims to investigate the influence of the elastic modulus of a conveyor belt on the power allocation of multi-drive conveyors. Based on the Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic model, a discrete model of an entire machine is established. Kelvin-Voigt software is used to simulate the working conditions of conveyor belts with different elastic moduli under full loads. The driving forces of individual rollers are obtained and then compared. Compared to other types of belts, a steel wire core conveyor belt, whose elastic modulus is relatively high, effectively improves the stability of the conveyor belt under a full load after start-up to achieve a reasonable power allocation. The results of this study provide a foundation for conveyor belt selection for multi-drive conveyors."
https://openalex.org/W3041293338,"Inflammatory responses are pivotal incidences in hepatic metabolic derangements. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1α) in IL10-mediated anti-inflammatory response, and its role in hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Hepatocyte-specific PGC1α knock-in (LivPGC1α) mice and the control mice were fed high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks. IL-10 neutralizing antibody was injected into the liver of PGC1α mice. A variety of biological and histological approaches were applied to assess hepatic function. We demonstrated that hepatic PGC1α expression was significantly reduced in mice fed HFD. LivPGC1α livers exhibited enhanced gene expressions involving mitochondrial function, and favored an accelerated lipid metabolism upon HFD. Meanwhile, LivPGC1α mice revealed improved hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Mechanistically, PGC1α bound and activated the promotor region of IL-10, thereby attenuating inflammatory response in the liver. Administration of IL10 neutralizing antibody to LivPGC1α mice abolished PGC1α-mediated anti-inflammatory effects in mice. Further, IL-10 neutralizing antibody intervention aggravated hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in LivPGC1α mice. Taken together, our data indicated that hepatic-specific overexpression of PGC1α exerts a beneficial role in the regulation of hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance via enhancing IL10-mediated anti-inflammatory response. Pharmacological activation of PGC1α-IL10 axis may be promising for the treatment of fatty liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3041069350,"Since 2015 Brazil has experienced the social repercussions of the Zika virus epidemic, thus raising a debate about: difficulties of diagnosis; healthcare access for children with Zika Congenital Syndrome (ZCS); the search for benefits by affected families; social and gender inequalities; and a discussion on reproductive rights, among others. The objective of this article is to analyse access to specialized health services for the care of children born with ZCS in three North-eastern states of Brazil. This is an exploratory cross-sectional study which analyses recorded cases of microcephaly at the municipal level between 2015 and 2017. Most of the cases of ZCS were concentrated on the Northeast coast. Rio Grande do Norte and Paraiba had the highest incidence of microcephaly in the study period. The states of Bahia, Paraiba and Rio Grande do Norte were selected for their high incidence of microcephaly due to the Zika Virus. Socio-territorial vulnerability was stratified using access to microcephaly diagnosis and treatment indicators. The specialized care network was mapped according to State Health Secretaries Protocols. A threshold radius of 100 km was stablished as the maximum distance from municipalities centroids to specialised health care for children with microcephaly. Prenatal coverage was satisfactory in most of the study area, although availability of ultrasound equipment was uneven within states and health regions. Western Bahia had the lowest coverage of ultrasound equipment and lacked health rehabilitation services. ZCS's specialized health services were spread out over large areas, some of which were outside the affected patients' home municipalities, so displacements were expensive and very time consuming, representing an extra burden for the affected families. This study is the first to address accessibility of children with microcephaly to specialised health care services and points to the urgent need to expand coverage of these services in Brazil, especially in the northeastern states, which are most affected by the epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W3039437037,"Background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are increasingly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries. Successful management requires consistent access to appropriate medicines. Availability of NCD medicines is generally low, especially in the public sector, however, little is known about other factors affecting access. We explored barriers and facilitators of access to medicines for diabetes and hypertension at public and private health facilities in Uganda. Methods We conducted a qualitative descriptive study at six public hospitals and five private health facilities in different regions of Uganda. Data collection included 36 in-depth interviews and 14 focus group discussions (n = 128) among purposively selected adult outpatients with diabetes and/or hypertension and 26 key informant interviews with healthcare workers and patient association leaders. Transcripts were coded and emerging themes identified using the Framework method. Results Four main themes emerged: Stocking of medicines and supplies, Financial factors, Individual behaviour and attitudes, and Service delivery at health facilities. Stocking of medicines and supplies mainly presented barriers to access at public facilities including frequent stockouts, failure to stock certain medicines and low quality brands often rejected by patients. Financial factors, especially high cost of medicines and limited insurance coverage, were barriers in private facilities. Free service provision was a facilitator at public facilities. Patients’ confusion resulting from mixed messages and their preference for herbal treatments were cross-sector barriers. While flexibility in NCD service provision was a facilitator at private facilities, provider burnout and limited operating hours were barriers in public facilities. Patient-driven associations exist at some public facilities and help mitigate inadequate medicine stock. Conclusion Access to NCD medicines in Uganda is influenced by both health system and patient factors. Some factors are sector-specific, while others cross-cutting between public and private sectors. Due to commonalities in barriers, potential strategies for overcoming them may include patient-driven associations, public-private partnerships, and multi-modal health education platforms."
https://openalex.org/W3038754138,"Given recent slowing of declines in national all-cause, heart disease, and stroke mortality, examining spatiotemporal distributions of coronary heart disease (CHD) death rates and trends can provide data critical to improving the cardiovascular health of populations. This paper documents county-level CHD death rates and trends by age group, race, and gender from 1979 through 2017. Using data from the National Vital Statistics System and a Bayesian multivariate space-time conditional autoregressive model, we estimated county-level age-standardized annual CHD death rates for 1979 through 2017 by age group (35-64 years, 65 years and older), race (white, black, other), and gender (men, women). We then estimated county-level total percent change in CHD death rates during four intervals (1979-1990, 1990-2000, 2000-2010, 2010-2017) using log-linear regression models. For all intervals, national CHD death rates declined for all groups. Prior to 2010, although most counties across age, race, and gender experienced declines, pockets of increasing CHD death rates were observed in the Mississippi Delta, Oklahoma, East Texas, and New Mexico across age groups and gender, and were more prominent among non-white populations than whites. Since 2010, across age, race, and gender, county-level declines in CHD death rates have slowed, with a marked increase in the percent of counties with increasing CHD death rates (e.g. 4.4% and 19.9% for ages 35 and older during 1979-1990 and 2010-2017, respectively). Recent increases were especially prevalent and geographically widespread among ages 35-64 years, with 40.5% of counties (95% CI: 38.4, 43.1) experiencing increases. Spatiotemporal differences in these long term, county-level results can inform responses by the public health community, medical providers, researchers, and communities to address troubling recent trends."
https://openalex.org/W3041733237,"Background The prognostic value of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a comorbidity in heart failure has been well documented. However, the role of pulmonary function indices in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains to be elucidated. Methods Subjects with HFpEF received pulmonary function tests and echocardiogram. Total lung capacity (TLC), residual volume (RV), forced expiratory flow rate between 25% and 75% of vital capacity (FEF25-75), forced expiratory volume in the 1st second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and vital capacity (VC) were measured. Echocardiographic indices, including pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), the ratio of early ventricular filling flow velocity to the septal mitral annulus tissue velocity (E/e’), and left ventricular mass (LVM), were recorded. National Death Registry was linked for the identification of mortality. Results A total of 1194 patients (72.4±13.2 years, 59% men) were enrolled. PASP, E/e’ and LVM were associated with either obstructive (RV/TLC, FEV1 and FEF25-75) or restrictive (VC and TLC) ventilatory indices. During a mean follow-up of 23.0±12.8 months, 182 patients died. Subjects with COPD had a lower survival rate than those without COPD. While VC, FVC, RV/TLC, and FEV1 were all independently associated with all-cause mortality in patients without COPD, only FEF25-75 was predictive of outcomes in those with COPD. Conclusions The abnormalities of pulmonary function were related to the cardiac hemodynamics in patients with HFpEF. In addition, these ventilatory indices were independently associated with long-term mortality, especially in those without COPD."
https://openalex.org/W3038239736,"Dengue virus (DENV) infection is endemic in Nepal. Although infection rates are reported annually, little information is available about the circulating viral serotypes and genotypes. Here, we report the results of a multicentre cross-sectional study of DENV serotypes and genotypes sampled from individuals with suspected DENV infection in Nepal in 2017. Of the 50 patients sampled, 40 were serologically positive for DENV NS1, 29 for anti-DENV IgM, 21 for anti-DENV IgG and 14 were positive by qRT-PCR. The three serotypes DENV-1, 2 and 3 were detected and there was no DENV-4. Positive samples from serotyping were subjected to PCR amplification by envelope (E) gene specific primer and subsequent bidirectional sequencing of 5 samples. A time to most recent common ancestor phylogenetic tree was constructed from the new sequences obtained here together with historical DENV-1 and DENV-2 E gene sequences. The DENV-1 isolates (n = 2) from Nepalese individuals were closely related to Indian genotype V, whereas DENV-2 isolates (n = 3) belonged to Cosmopolitan genotype IVa, which is closely related to Indonesian isolates. Historical DENV isolates obtained between 2004 and 2013 clustered with Cosmopolitan IVb, Cosmopolitan IVa, and Asian II genotypes. All Nepalese isolates had different lineages with distinct ancestries. With the exception of isolates obtained in 2004, all other previously published isolates had ancestry to geographically distant part of the world. Molecular analysis revealed dengue epidemics to be comprised of different genotypes of serotype 1 and 2 raising concerns on potential role of different genotypes causing Dengue hemorrhagic fever. Also, our result indicated spread of DENV-2 in non-endemic area such as hilly region of Nepal which was considered to be free of dengue due to high altitude and cold weather."
https://openalex.org/W3038657813,"In order to explore the application of the image recognition model based on multi-stage convolutional neural network (MS-CNN) in the deep learning neural network in the intelligent recognition of commodity images and the recognition performance of the method, in the study, the features of color, shape, and texture of commodity images are first analyzed, and the basic structure of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model is analyzed. Then, 50,000 pictures containing different commodities are constructed to verify the recognition effect of the model. Finally, the MS-CNN model is taken as the research object for improvement to explore the influence of label errors (p = 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.12) with different parameter settings and different probabilities (size of convolutional kernel, Dropout rate) on the recognition accuracy of MS-CNN model, at the same time, a CIR system platform based on MS-CNN model is built, and the recognition performance of salt and pepper noise images with different SNR (0, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.1) was compared, then the performance of the algorithm in the actual image recognition test was compared. The results show that the recognition accuracy is the highest (97.8%) when the convolution kernel size in the MS-CNN model is 2*2 and 3*3, and the average recognition accuracy is the highest (97.8%) when the dropout rate is 0.1; when the error probability of picture label is 12%, the recognition accuracy of the model constructed in this study is above 96%. Finally, the commodity image database constructed in this study is used to identify and verify the model. The recognition accuracy of the algorithm in this study is significantly higher than that of the Minitch stochastic gradient descent algorithm under different SNR conditions, and the recognition accuracy is the highest when SNR = 0 (99.3%). The test results show that the model proposed in this study has good recognition effect in the identification of commodity images in scenes of local occlusion, different perspectives, different backgrounds, and different light intensity, and the recognition accuracy is 97.1%. To sum up, the CIR platform based on MS-CNN model constructed in this study has high recognition accuracy and robustness, which can lay a foundation for the realization of subsequent intelligent commodity recognition technology."
https://openalex.org/W3040547078,"Survey cruises by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in 2016 and 2019 yielded specimens of an undetermined red alga that rapidly attained alarming levels of benthic coverage at Pearl and Hermes Atoll, Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, Hawai'i. By 2019 the seaweed had covered large expanses on the northeast side of the atoll with mat-like, extensive growth of entangled thalli. Specimens were analyzed using light microscopy and molecular analysis, and were compared to morphological descriptions in the literature for closely related taxa. Light microscopy demonstrated that the specimens likely belonged to the rhodomelacean genus Chondria, yet comparisons to taxonomic literature revealed no morphological match. DNA sequence analyses of the mitochondrial COI barcode marker, the plastidial rbcL gene, and the nuclear SSU gene confirmed its genus-level placement and demonstrated that this alga was unique compared to all other available sequences. Based on these data, this cryptogenic seaweed is here proposed as a new species: Chondria tumulosa A.R.Sherwood & J.M.Huisman sp. nov. Chondria tumulosa is distinct from all other species of Chondria based on its large, robust thalli, a mat-forming tendency, large axial diameter in mature branches (which decreases in diameter with subsequent orders of branching), terete axes, and bluntly rounded apices. Although C. tumulosa does not meet the criteria for the definition of an invasive species given that it has not been confirmed as introduced to Pearl and Hermes Atoll, this seaweed is not closely related to any known Hawaiian native species and is of particular concern given its sudden appearance and rapid increase in abundance in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument; an uninhabited, remote, and pristine island chain to the northwest of the Main Hawaiian Islands."
https://openalex.org/W3040780593,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) can contribute to protecting biodiversity and managing ocean activities, including fishing. There is, however, limited evidence of ecological responses to blue water MPAs. We conducted the first comprehensive evaluation of impacts on fisheries production and ecological responses to pelagic MPAs of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. A Bayesian time series-based counterfactual modelling approach using fishery-dependent data was used to compare the temporal response in the MPAs to three reference regions for standardized catch rates, lengths, trophic level of the catch and species diversity. Catch rates of bigeye tuna, the main target species (Kingman/Palmyra MPA, causal effect probability >99% of an 84% reduction; 95% credible interval: -143%, -25%), and blue shark (Johnston MPAs, causal effect probability >95%) were significantly lower and longnose lancetfish significantly higher (Johnston MPAs, causal effect probability >95%) than predicted had the MPAs not been established, possibly from closing areas near shallow features, which aggregate pelagic predators, and from ‘fishing-the-line’. There were no apparent causal impacts of the MPAs on species diversity, lengths and trophic level of the catch, perhaps because the MPAs were young, were too small, did not contain critical habitat for specific life-history stages, had been lightly exploited or experienced fishing-the-line. We also assessed model-standardized catch rates for species of conservation concern and mean trophic level of the catch within and outside of MPAs. Displaced effort produced multi-species conflicts: MPAs protect bycatch hotspots and hotspots of bycatch-to-target catch ratios for some at-risk species, but coldspots for others. Mean trophic level of the catch was significantly higher around MPAs, likely due to the aggregating effect of the shallow features and there having been light fishing pressure within MPAs. These findings demonstrate how exploring a wide range of ecological responses supports evidence-based evaluations of blue water MPAs."
https://openalex.org/W3041411542,"Purpose Rod and cone photoreceptor-specific tests can be time-consuming. A new non-invasive test is described. The test is based on the measurement of flicker modulation thresholds with rod- and cone-enhanced visual stimuli, which requires only minimum adaptation time. Here, we investigated how the rod-and cone-mediated flicker thresholds vary with age. Methods Monocular thresholds with rod and cone–enhanced stimuli were measured in 140 healthy adults, (age range: 18–75 years), foveally (0°) and at four parafoveal locations, at an eccentricity of 5° in each of the four quadrants using five, adaptive, interleaved staircases. Temporal frequencies, stimulus sizes, background luminance and spectral composition, were adjusted appropriately to achieve approximately 1 log unit separation in sensitivity between the rod- and cone-enhanced stimuli. Spectrally calibrated, ‘neutral density’ filters were used to enable adequate control of display luminance for rod enhanced stimuli. Results The magnitude of central and parafoveal rod thresholds was significantly higher than the central and parafoveal cone thresholds, respectively (p < 0.001) in both the age groups. However, the rate of increase in central rod thresholds (y = 0.45x—12.79; linear regression equation) was not significantly steeper than the rate of increase in central (y = 0.29x—8.53) cone thresholds (p = 0.15). Centrally, cone thresholds showed a better correlation with rod central thresholds for the age > 45 years (Spearman correlation, ρ = 0.74, p < 0.001) compared to age ≤ 45 years (ρ = 0.41, p < 0.001). Conclusions Thresholds with rod- and cone-enhanced stimuli are largely invariant below 45 years of age and increase rapidly above this age. This age-wise normative database can be used as an effective functional-marker to assess photoreceptor sensitivities in retinal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3041653658,"Liquid biopsy has become widely applied in clinical medicine along with the progress in innovative technologies, such as next generation sequencing, but the origin of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has not yet been precisely established. We reported bimodal peaks of long fragment circulating free DNA (cfDNA) of 5 kb and short fragment cfDNA of 170 bp in patients with advanced lung cancer, and both contained ctDNA. In this paper, we demonstrate that the total amount of cfDNA is higher when patients with lung cancer have extrathoracic metastases, and the amount of long fragment cfDNA is significantly higher in those patients. To investigate the origin of long fragment cfDNA, conditioned media isolated from lung cancer cell lines was fractionated. Long fragment cfDNA was found concomitant with extracellular vesicles (EVs), but short fragment cfDNA was not observed in any fractions. However, in peripheral blood from a metastatic animal model both fragments were detected even with those same lung cancer cell lines. In human plasma samples, long fragment cfDNA was observed in the same fraction as that from conditioned media, and short fragment cfDNA existed in the supernatant after centrifugation at 100,000g. Concentration of ctDNA in the supernatant was two times higher than that in plasma isolated by the conventional procedure. Long fragment cfDNA associated with tumor progression might therefore be released into peripheral blood, and it is possible that the long fragment cfDNA escapes degradation by co-existing with EVs. Examination of the biological characteristics of long fragment cfDNA is a logical subject of further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3039140921,"Background Spontaneous pneumothorax is a complication that occurs in patients with connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD); however, few studies on the clinical implications of pneumothorax for patients with CTD-ILD have been performed. Objectives This study aimed to investigate the incidence and prognostic significance of pneumothorax and the risk factors for its onset in patients with CTD-ILD. Methods This study included 140 consecutive patients with CTD-ILD. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, pulmonary function test results, and chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images were retrospectively evaluated. Results A total of 18 patients (12.9%) developed pneumothorax during their clinical course. The cumulative incidence of pneumothorax from the time of CTD-ILD diagnosis was 6.5%, 8.7%, and 11.3% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The 10-year survival rate was significantly lower in patients with pneumothorax (29.6%) than that in those without pneumothorax (81.3%). The development of pneumothorax was significantly associated with poor prognosis (HR 22.0; p < 0.010). Furthermore, a lower body mass index, greater extent of reticular abnormalities on HRCT, and administration of methylprednisolone pulse therapy were significantly associated with the development of pneumothorax. Conclusion Pneumothorax is a serious complication in the clinical course of patients with CTD-ILD and the onset of pneumothorax predicts a poor outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3041579215,"Background Middle-aged and older adults are more likely to suffer from chronic conditions, which can increase their need for both formal and informal care. This study seeks to assess and compare the extent to which the use of formal and informal care is attributed to different chronic conditions among middle-aged and older women and men in Canada. Methods We used baseline data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA). Outcomes of interest were the number of hours of formal care and informal care received during the past 12 months. All chronic conditions were first classified according to existing classification frameworks. If total formal and informal care hours for a particular condition differed greatly from other conditions, we considered it as a stand-alone classification. We used a two-part model consisting of a logistic regression for the probability of receiving formal/informal care and a generalized linear model for the hours of formal/informal care for those who received care. Results Our final analytic sample was 23,206 women and 22,903 men who did not have missing data. Among the 16 chronic conditions considered, multiple sclerosis, memory problems, Parkinsonism, and stroke had the greatest average marginal effects on overall hours of formal care among women (53.07, 13.95, 9.13 and 8.14 incremental hours annually, respectively) and men (152.17, 8.13, 13.95 and 6.00 incremental hours). Similarly, the average marginal effects of these four conditions on informal care were the greatest (77.78, 29.52, 26.18 and 34.95 incremental hours for women and 133.94, 34.99, 104.86 and 17.85 incremental hours for men). Conclusions Chronic conditions, especially multiple sclerosis, Parkinsonism, memory problems, and stroke, are associated with substantial time of formal and informal care in middle-aged and older women and men. Findings will help decision-makers assess the potential impact of chronic disease prevention and management programs in an aging population."

The various methods used to isolate EVs from body fluid and cell culture supernatant have been compared in prior studies, which determined that the component yield and physical properties of isolated EVs depend largely on the isolation method used. Several novel and combined methods have been recently developed, which have not yet been compared to the established methods. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the physical and functional differences in EVs isolated using a differential centrifugation method, the precipitation-based Invitrogen kit, the ExoLutE kit, and the Exodisc, of which the latter two were recently developed. We investigated the properties of EVs isolated from non-infected and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells using each method and determined the yields of DNA, RNA, and proteins using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and bicinchoninic acid assays. Additionally, we determined whether the biological activity of EVs correlated with the quantity or physical properties of the EVs isolated using different methods. We found that Exodisc was the most suitable method for obtaining large quantities of EVs, which might be useful for biomarker investigations, and that the EVs separated using Exodisc exhibited the highest complement activation activity. However, we also found that the functional properties of EVs were best maintained when differential centrifugation was used. Effective isolation is necessary to study EVs as tools for diagnosing cancer and our findings may have relevant implications in the field of oncology by providing researchers with data to assist their selection of a suitable isolation method."
https://openalex.org/W3041778595,"Macrophages in lung, including resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) and interstitial macrophages (IMs), and monocyte-derived macrophages, play important roles in pulmonary fibrosis (PF), but mechanisms underlying their differential regulation remain unclear. Recombination signal-binding protein Jκ (RBP-J)-mediated Notch signaling regulates macrophage development and phenotype. Here, using bleomycin-induced fibrosis model combined with myeloid-specific RBP-J disruption (RBP-JcKO) mouse, we investigated the role of Notch signaling in macrophages during PF. Compared with the control, RBP-JcKO mice exhibited alleviated lung fibrosis as manifested by reduced collagen deposition and inflammation, and decreased TGF-β production. FACS analysis suggested that decreased Ly6cloMHCIIhi AMs might make the major contribution to attenuated fibrogenesis in RBP-JcKO mice, probably by reduced inflammatory factor release and enhanced matrix metalloproteinases expression. Using clodronate-mediated macrophage depletion in RBP-JckO mice, we demonstrated that embryonic-derived AMs play negligible role in lung fibrosis, which was further supported by adoptive transfer experiments. Moreover, on CCR2 knockout background, the effect of RBP-J deficiency on fibrogenesis was not elicited, suggesting that Notch regulated monocyte-derived AMs. Co-culture experiment showed that monocyte-derived AMs from RBP-JcKO mice exhibit reduced myofibroblast activation due to decreased TGF-β secretion. In conclusion, monocyte-derived Ly6cloMHCIIhi AMs, which are regulated by RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling, play an essential role in lung fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3038572111,"Background Continuing tuberculosis control with current approaches is unlikely to reach the World Health Organization’s objective to eliminate TB by 2035. Innovative interventions such as unmanned aerial vehicles (or drones) and digital adherence monitoring technologies have the potential to enhance patient-centric quality tuberculosis care and help challenged National Tuberculosis Programs leapfrog over the impediments of conventional Directly Observed Therapy (DOTS) implementation. A bundle of innovative interventions referred to for its delivery technology as the Drone Observed Therapy System (DrOTS) was implemented in remote Madagascar. Given the potentially increased cost these interventions represent for health systems, a cost-effectiveness analysis was indicated. Methods A decision analysis model was created to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness of the DrOTS strategy compared to DOTS, the standard of care, in a study population of 200,000 inhabitants in rural Madagascar with tuberculosis disease prevalence of 250/100,000. A mixed top-down and bottom-up costing approach was used to identify costs associated with both models, and net costs were calculated accounting for resulting TB treatment costs. Net cost per disability-adjusted life years averted was calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed for key input variables to identify main drivers of health and cost outcomes, and cost-effectiveness. Findings Net cost per TB patient identified within DOTS and DrOTS were, respectively, $282 and $1,172. The incremental cost per additional TB patient diagnosed in DrOTS was $2,631 and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of DrOTS compared to DOTS was $177 per DALY averted. Analyses suggest that integrating drones with interventions ensuring highly sensitive laboratory testing and high treatment adherence optimizes cost-effectiveness. Conclusion Innovative technology packages including drones, digital adherence monitoring technologies, and molecular diagnostics for TB case finding and retention within the cascade of care can be cost effective. Their integration with other interventions within health systems may further lower costs and support access to universal health coverage."
https://openalex.org/W3039102048,"While the general practitioner (GP) in the Netherlands is the first point of entry to and gatekeeper of the healthcare system, no study exists to explore the experiences of women with female genital mutilation or cutting (FGM/C) in general practice. Therefore, the aim of this study is to look into the experiences of women with FGM/C in Dutch general practice.Semistructured interviews were held with 16 women with FGM/C. Sampling was purposeful. The interview guide and thematic analysis were based on the Illness Perception Model and Kleinman's Explanatory model. Interviews were held in English or Dutch. All data were anonymized, and recordings were transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded and thematically analyzed.The women considered FGM/C to be connected to a range of health problems, for which not all of them sought medical care. They had difficulty discussing such a sensitive topic with their GP, did not know their problems could be relieved or perceived GPs to have insufficient knowledge of FGM/C. Lack of time during consultations and overall dissatisfaction with Dutch GP care hampered trust. They strongly preferred the GP to be proactive and ask about FGM/C.There is room for improvement as most women would like their GP to discuss their health problems related to FGM/C. GPs should take a proactive attitude and ask about FGM/C. In addition, to develop the trusted relationship needed to discuss sensitive topics and provide culturally sensitive person-centered care, sufficient time during consultations is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3042089276,"This study aimed to estimate energy requirements of pregnant Holstein × Gyr cows. Different planes of nutrition were established by two feeding regimens: ad libitum or maintenance. Sixty-two nonlactating cows with average body weight of 480 ± 10.1 kg and an age of 5 ± 0.5 years were used. Cows were divided into three groups: pregnant (n = 44), non-pregnant (n = 12), and baseline reference (n = 6). The 56 pregnant and non-pregnant cows were randomly allocated into a feeding regimen: ad libitum or maintenance. To evaluate the effects of days of pregnancy, pregnant and non-pregnant animals were slaughtered at 140, 200, 240, and 270 days of pregnancy. Energy requirements for maintenance differed between pregnant and non-pregnant cows, thus two equations were developed. Net energy and metabolizable energy requirements for maintenance of non-pregnant cows were 82 kcal/kg empty body weight0.75/day and 132 kcal/kg empty body weight0.75/day, respectively. The efficiency of use of metabolizable energy for maintenance of non-pregnant cows was 62.4%. Net energy and metabolizable energy for maintenance of pregnant cows were 86 kcal/kg empty body weight0.75/day and 137 kcal/kg empty body weight0.75/day, respectively. Efficiency of use of metabolizable energy for maintenance of pregnant cows was 62.5%. The efficiency of use of metabolizable energy for gain was 41.9%. The efficiency of use of metabolizable energy for pregnancy was 14.1%. Furthermore, net energy requirement for pregnancy was different from zero from day 70 of pregnancy onwards. In conclusion, net energy and metabolizable energy requirements for maintenance of non-pregnant cows are different from pregnant cows. Furthermore, we believe that the proposed non-linear equations to estimate net energy requirements for pregnancy are more adequate than current NRC equation, and should be recommended for Holstein × Gyr cows."
https://openalex.org/W3040733211,"Glioblastoma is a common, malignant brain tumor whose disease incidence increases with age. Glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) are thought to contribute to cancer therapy resistance and to be responsible for tumor initiation, maintenance, and recurrence. This study utilizes both SNP array and gene expression profiling to better understand GSCs and their relation to malignant disease. Peripheral blood and primary glioblastoma tumor tissue were obtained from patients, the latter of which was used to generate GSCs as well as a CD133pos./CD15pos. subpopulation. The stem cell features of GSCs were confirmed via the immunofluorescent expression of Nestin, SOX2, and CD133. Both tumor tissue and the isolated primary cells shared unique abnormal genomic characteristics, including a gain of chromosome 7 as well as either a partial or complete loss of chromosome 10. Individual genomic differences were also observed, including the loss of chromosome 4 and segmental uniparental disomy of 9p24.3→p21.3 in GSCs. Gene expression profiling revealed 418 genes upregulated in tumor tissue vs. CD133pos./CD15pos. cells and 44 genes upregulated in CD133pos./CD15pos. cells vs. tumor tissue. Pathway analyses demonstrated that upregulated genes in CD133pos./CD15pos. cells are relevant to cell cycle processes and cancerogenesis. In summary, we detected previously undescribed genomic and gene expression differences when comparing tumor tissue and isolated stem-like subpopulations."
https://openalex.org/W3038908443,"Diatoms play a key role in the marine carbon cycle with their high primary productivity and release of exudates such as extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP). These exudates contribute to aggregates (marine snow) that rapidly transport organic material to the seafloor, potentially capturing contaminants like petroleum components. Ocean acidification (OA) impacts marine organisms, especially those that utilize inorganic carbon for photosynthesis and EPS production. Here we investigated the response of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana grown to present day and future ocean conditions in the presence of a water accommodated fraction (WAF and OAWAF) of oil and a diluted chemically enhanced WAF (DCEWAF and OADCEWAF). T. pseudonana responded to WAF/DCEWAF but not OA and no multiplicative effect of the two factors (i.e., OA and oil/dispersant) was observed. T. pseudonana released more colloidal EPS (< 0.7 μm to > 3 kDa) in the presence of WAF/DCEWAF/OAWAF/OADCEWAF than in the corresponding Controls. Colloidal EPS and particulate EPS in the oil/dispersant treatments have higher protein-to-carbohydrate ratios than those in the control treatments, and thus are likely stickier and have a greater potential to form aggregates of marine oil snow. More TEP was produced in response to WAF than in Controls; OA did not influence its production. Polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations and distributions were significantly impacted by the presence of dispersants but not OA. PAHs especially Phenanthrenes, Anthracenes, Chrysenes, Fluorenes, Fluoranthenes, Pyrenes, Dibenzothiophenes and 1-Methylphenanthrene show major variations in the aggregate and surrounding seawater fraction of oil and oil plus dispersant treatments. Studies like this add to the current knowledge of the combined effects of aggregation, marine snow formation, and the potential impacts of oil spills under ocean acidification scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W3039419625,"HIV-associated/epidemic Kaposi’s sarcoma (EpKS) is an AIDS-defining angio-proliferative malignancy. It can be treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) alone or with ART plus cytotoxic chemotherapy. ART-treated EpKS can either respond or worsen upon treatment. This study aimed at identifying immunological markers of ART-treatment response. We compared responders (those with clinical EpKS tumor regression) versus poor responders (those with progressive or non-responsive EpKS). We measured plasma cytokine and chemokine levels using cytometric bead assays. Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses were also quantified to test associations with treatment outcome. Interleukin (IL)-5 levels were significantly elevated in responders versus poor-responders at baseline (0.76pg/ml vs. 0.37pg/ml; p<0.01) and follow-up (0.56pg/ml vs. 0.37pg/ml; p<0.01); IL-6 was lower in responders than poor-responders at follow-up (600fg/ml vs. 4272fg/ml; p<0.05). IP-10/CxCL-10 was significantly lower at follow-up in responders versus poor-responders (187pg/ml vs. 528pg/ml; p<0.01). KSHV nAb were not significantly differential between responders and poor-responders. In conclusion, high plasma IL-5 at baseline could be a marker for ART-treated KS tumor regression, whereas increased pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, and the chemokine IP-10, associate with KS tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W3039961884,"A better understanding of plant cell micromechanics would enhance the current opinion on “how things are happening” inside a plant cell, enabling more detailed insights into plant physiology as well as processing plant biomaterials. However, with the contemporary laboratory equipment, the experimental investigation of cell micromechanics has been a challenging task due to diminutive spatial and time scales involved. In this investigation, a three-dimensional (3-D) coupled Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Coarse-Grained (CG) computational approach has been employed to model micromechanics of single plant cells going through drying or dehydration. This meshfree-based computational model has conclusively demonstrated that it can effectively simulate the behaviour of stress and strain in a plant cell being compressed at different levels of dryness: ranging from a fresh state to an extremely dried state. In addition, different biological and physical circumstances have been approximated through the proposed novel computational framework in the form of different turgor pressures, strain rates, mechanical properties and cell sizes. The proposed computational framework has potential not only to study the micromechanical characteristics of plant cellular structure during drying, but also other equivalent, biological structures and processes with relevant modifications. There are no underlying difficulties in adopting the model to replicate other types of cells and more sophisticated micromechanical phenomena of the cells under different external loading conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3041082742,"Background The number of non-Western immigrants with breast cancer in the Netherlands has increased over the past decades and is expected to triple by 2030. Due to insufficient representation in clinical studies, it is unclear what the specific experiences and needs of these women are. Understanding how culture and religion affect these women’s experience of breast cancer and how they deal with chemotherapy and treatment-related changes in body weight and lifestyle is crucial for health care professionals to be able to provide effective support. Methods A qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews with 28 immigrant women with a history of breast cancer treated with chemotherapy. Results Women often associated breast cancer with taboo, death or bad luck. Religion offered these women guidance, strength and meaning to the disease, but also limited the women to openly talk about their disease. Women perceived lifestyle factors to have little influence on the development and treatment of cancer. After treatment, however, their thinking changed and these lifestyle factors became of paramount importance to them. They realised that they missed out on information about managing their own diet, exercise and body weight and were eager to share their experiences with other women in their culture with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Conclusion Women became aware during and after breast cancer treatment that it was difficult for them to actively deal with their illness under the influence of their culture and religion. Based on their own experiences and acquired knowledge, they would like to give advice to newly diagnosed women on how to deal with breast cancer within their own culture and religion. Their recommendations could be used by mosques, churches, support groups and health care professionals, to ensure interventions during breast cancer treatment meet their religious and cultural needs and thus improve their quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W3041104178,"Historically, the Netherlands has hosted a large number of migrant sex workers. Since sex work is considered a legal profession it might serve as an example of better access to health services, including HIV testing, at least for those working within the legal framework. However, migrant sex workers, especially non-European Union (EU) nationals, might not be eligible to register for official employment and thus face obstacles in obtaining access to health services, becoming essentially invisible. This study examined context-specific vulnerabilities of migrant female sex workers (FSWs) from Belarus, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine, whether and how they have access to HIV testing compared to other EE, non-EU migrant FSWs in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. We conducted a multi-stakeholder perspective study from November 2015 to September 2017 in Amsterdam. The study comprised 1) semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders (N = 19); 2) in-depth interviews with Eastern European, non-EU migrant FSWs (N = 5) and field observations of the escort agency working with them; and 3) in-depth interviews with key stakeholders (N = 12). We found six key barriers to HIV testing: 1) migration and sex-work policies; 2) stigma, including self-stigmatization; 3) lack of trust in healthcare providers or social workers; 4) low levels of Dutch or English languages; 5) negative experience in accessing healthcare services in the home country; and 6) low perceived risk and HIV-related knowledge. Having a family and children, social support and working at the licensed sex-work venues might facilitate HIV testing. However, Internet-based sex workers remain invisible in the sex-work industry. Our findings indicate the importance of addressing women’s diverse experiences, shaped by intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, network and policy-level factors, with stigma being at the core. We call for the scaling up of outreach interventions focusing on FSWs and, in particular, migrant FSWs working online."
https://openalex.org/W3041717140,"The greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis) is a flagship species for the protection of hibernation and summer maternity roosts in the Western Palearctic region. A range of pathogenic agents is known to put pressure on populations, including the white-nose syndrome fungus, for which the species shows the highest prevalence and infection intensity of all European bat species. Here, we perform analysis of blood parameters characteristic for the species during its natural annual life cycle in order to establish reference values. Despite sexual dimorphism and some univariate differences, the overall multivariate pattern suggests low seasonal variation with homeostatic mechanisms effectively regulating haematology and blood biochemistry ranges. Overall, the species displayed a high haematocrit and haemoglobin content and high concentration of urea, while blood glucose levels in swarming and hibernating bats ranged from hypo- to normoglycaemic. Unlike blood pH, concentrations of electrolytes were wide ranging. To conclude, baseline data for blood physiology are a useful tool for providing suitable medical care in rescue centres, for studying population health in bats adapting to environmental change, and for understanding bat responses to stressors of conservation and/or zoonotic importance."

Identification of these pathogenic variants is important to identify endometrial cancer patients with inherited increased risk of new cancers, in order to offer them lifesaving surveillance. However, several other genes are also part of the MMR pathway. It is therefore relevant to search for variants in additional genes that may be associated with cancer risk by including all known genes involved in the MMR pathway. Next-generation sequencing was used to screen 22 genes involved in the MMR pathway in constitutional DNA extracted from full blood from 199 unselected endometrial cancer patients. Bioinformatic pipelines were developed for identification and functional annotation of variants, using several different software tools and custom programs. This facilitated identification of 22 exonic, 4 UTR and 9 intronic variants that could be classified according to pathogenicity. This study has identified several germline variants in genes of the MMR pathway that potentially may be associated with an increased risk for cancer, in particular endometrial cancer, and therefore are relevant for further investigation. We have also developed bioinformatics strategies to analyse targeted sequencing data, including low quality data and genomic regions outside of the protein coding exons of the relevant genes."

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is associated with proximal renal tubular dysfunction, proteinuria and decrease in glomerular function. Studies in developed countries have shown variable prevalence of proximal renal tubular dysfunction in children on TDF. There are no known studies in developing countries, including Zimbabwe, documenting the proximal tubular function in HIV infected children on TDF. The aim of this study was to assess renal and proximal renal tubular function in HIV infected children receiving TDF and determine factors associated with proximal tubular dysfunction.A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in HIV infected patients below 18 years of age attending outpatient clinics at two tertiary hospitals in Harare, who received a TDF-containing antiretroviral regimen for at least six months. Dipstick protein and glucose, serum and urine phosphate and creatinine levels were measured. Fractional excretion of phosphate was calculated. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Schwartz formula. Tubular dysfunction was defined by at least two of the following characteristics: normoglycaemic glycosuria, hypophosphatemia and fractional excretion of phosphate > 18%.One hundred and ninety-eight children below 18 years of age were recruited over a period of six months. The prevalence of tubular dysfunction was 0.5%. Normoglycaemic glycosuria occurred in 1 (0.5%), fractional excretion of phosphate >18% in 4 (2%), and hypophosphatemia in 22 [11.1%] patients. Severe stunting was associated with increased risk of hypophosphatemia (OR 9.31 CI (1.18, 80.68) p = 0.03). Reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 90ml/min/1.73m2 and proteinuria was evident in 35.9% and 32.8% of children, respectively. Concurrent TDF and HIV-1 protease inhibitor-based regimen was the only independent factor associated with reduction in GFR (OR 4.43 CI (1.32; 4.89) p = 0.016).Tubular dysfunction was uncommon in Zimbabwean children on a TDF-based ART regimen. Hypophosphatemia, proteinuria and reduction in eGFR were common. Reassessing renal function using more sensitive biomarkers is needed to examine the long-term tolerance of TDF."
https://openalex.org/W3038509910,"Nutrient-transporting enterocytes interact with their luminal environment using a densely packed collection of apical microvilli known as the brush border. Assembly of the brush border is controlled by the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC), a protocadherin-based complex found at the tips of brush border microvilli that mediates adhesion between neighboring protrusions. ANKS4B is known to be an essential scaffold within the IMAC, although its functional properties have not been thoroughly characterized. We report here that ANKS4B is directed to the brush border using a noncanonical apical targeting sequence that maps to a previously unannotated region of the scaffold. When expressed on its own, this sequence targeted to microvilli in the absence of any direct interaction with the other IMAC components. Sequence analysis revealed a coiled-coil motif and a putative membrane-binding basic-hydrophobic repeat sequence within this targeting region, both of which were required for the scaffold to target and mediate brush border assembly. Size-exclusion chromatography of the isolated targeting sequence coupled with in vitro brush border binding assays suggests that it functions as an oligomer. We further show that the corresponding sequence found in the closest homolog of ANKS4B, the scaffold USH1G that operates in sensory epithelia as part of the Usher complex, lacks the inherent ability to target to microvilli.

Intestinal enterocytes undergo an intricate morphogenic program to become specialized to mediate nutrient absorption in the gut. During terminal differentiation, each enterocyte constructs a highly ordered array of ∼1000 lumen-oriented apical microvilli that are enriched in nutrient processing enzymes and transport channels (1Crawley S.W. Mooseker M.S. Tyska M.J. Shaping the intestinal brush border.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 207 (25422372): 441-45110.1083/jcb.201407015Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Collectively these microvilli form the intestinal brush border (BB), a cellular adaptation that alone is responsible for nutrient uptake in the gut. Along with nutrient absorption, BB microvilli also play an important role in barrier function in the intestine. Enterocyte microvilli are coated by a thick glycocalyx at their apical tips (2Pelaseyed T. Bergström J.H. Gustafsson J.K. Ermund A. Birchenough G.M. Schütte A. van der Post S. Svensson F.

Together, these structural and functional properties help ensure the integrity of host tissue against potentially harmful toxins and microbes that can be found in the gut lumen. The importance of the BB is underscored by the fact that genetic conditions or acquired infections that perturb BB structure can be life-threatening, as seen with microvillus inclusion disease (6Wilson W. Scott R.B. Pinto A. Robertson M.A. Intractable diarrhea in a newborn infant: microvillous inclusion disease.Can. J.

During BB assembly, microvilli pack together into near-perfect hexagonal arrays, which allows for their maximum number to be constructed on the apical surface of each enterocyte (1Crawley S.W. Mooseker M.S. Tyska M.J. Shaping the intestinal brush border.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 207 (25422372): 441-45110.1083/jcb.201407015Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the lengths of microvilli are remarkably uniform both within and across neighboring enterocytes. Investigations into the mechanism underlying the assembly of the BB led to the discovery of a protocadherin-based adhesion complex that plays a key role in promoting BB organization (8Crawley S.W.

During construction of the BB, physical adhesion between neighboring microvilli controls their ordered packing. This adhesion is mediated by a pair of protocadherins: CDHR2 (cadherin-related family member 2; also known as protocadherin-24) and CDHR5 (cadherin-related family member 5; also known as mucin-like protocadherin) (8Crawley S.W.

These protocadherins reside at the distal tips of BB microvilli and interact in trans via a heterophilic adhesion bond to create “intermicrovillar adhesion links” that connect neighboring microvilli to control organization. Correct targeting and function of these protocadherins require a host of cytoplasmic factors.

ANKS4B is comprised of an N-terminal ankyrin-repeat domain (denoted here as ANKRmin), a central unstructured region (CEN), and a C-terminal sterile α-motif (SAM) ending in a PDZ-binding motif (PBM). ANKS4B uses its SAM–PBM domain to bind USH1C with high affinity (Kd = ∼4 nm), whereas its CEN domain interacts with Myo7b with moderate affinity (Kd = ∼1 μm) (13Li J. He Y. Lu Q. Zhang M.

The protein levels of the remaining IMAC components are also markedly reduced in ANKS4B KD cells, suggesting that ANKS4B plays a crucial role in stabilizing the mature adhesion complex. The closest homolog to ANKS4B is the scaffold USH1G (also known as Sans) (16Johnston A.M. Naselli G. Niwa H. Brodnicki T. Harrison L.C. Góñez L.J.

Interestingly, USH1C overlaps as a component in both the IMAC and the Usher complex. In agreement with this, USH1 patients with genetic defects in USH1C have been reported to also suffer from severe inflammatory enteropathy in addition to the typical neurosensory deficits associated with the disease (20Bitner-Glindzicz M.

In this study we sought to further characterize the functional properties of ANKS4B within the IMAC. Toward this goal, we used CACO-2BBE cells to perform structure–function studies and discovered that ANKS4B localizes to apical microvilli using a cryptic targeting sequence found in a previously unannotated region of the protein. Although this sequence does not display any overt homology to other known canonical structured domains, our functional analysis identified a number of conserved sequence motifs within this region of ANKS4B that were essential for apical targeting of the scaffold. Importantly, this targeting sequence localized to apical microvilli independent of a direct interaction with the other known IMAC components and was required for the function of ANKS4B in promoting BB assembly during enterocyte polarization. We further show the apical targeting ability of this sequence represents a possible point of functional divergence between the ankyrin repeat-based scaffolds that operate in the IMAC and the Usher complex. Together, these data reveal that ANKS4B exhibits characteristics that may allow it to function as the “primordial” scaffold that targets the IMAC to the apical domain of enterocytes to drive BB assembly. CACO-2BBE cells construct a well-ordered apical BB when allowed to polarize for extended periods in cell culture (15Peterson M.D. Mooseker M.S. An in vitro model for the analysis of intestinal brush border assembly: I. Ultrastructural analysis of cell contact-induced brush border assembly in Caco-2BBe cells.J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105 (8408276): 445-460PubMed Google Scholar). During this process, microvilli assemble into organized clusters on the apical surface as a result of the adhesion activity of the IMAC (8Crawley S.W. Shifrin Jr., D.A. Grega-Larson N.E.

To gain insight into the functional properties of ANKS4B during BB assembly, we followed the expression profile of this IMAC scaffold by immunoblot analysis across a developmental time series of CACO-2BBE cells. We have previously shown that all the other known IMAC components are largely absent from the early time points of CACO-2BBE cell development (8Crawley S.W. Shifrin Jr., D.A. Grega-Larson N.E.

In contrast, ANKS4B could be detected across all time points of our developmental time series (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, ANKS4B exhibited a laddered appearance by immunoblot analysis, with multiple higher-molecular-mass species being detected. The dominant band in fully polarized cells was the lowest-mass species, which migrated at an apparent molecular mass of ∼52 kDa (Fig. 1A, arrow), slightly larger than the theoretical mass of 46.6 kDa for ANKS4B. After day 2, this lower-mass species rapidly increased in quantity to end up constituting ∼95% of the total ANKS4B signal detected in mature cells (days 14–21). Although the nature of the higher mass species of ANKS4B remains unknown, we noted that these bands tended to collapse when samples were reheated multiple times. This may suggest that they represent oligomers of the scaffold that are partially resistant to disruption by heating and detergent. To further explore how ANKS4B behaves during CACO-2BBE differentiation, we stained for endogenous ANKS4B in CACO-2BBE cells across a similar polarization time course. For this analysis, we assessed the relative enrichment of ANKS4B in the apical domain compared with the total cellular signal at each time point (Fig. 1B; see also Fig. S1A for demarcation examples). During the early stages of BB development (days 0–2), apical microvilli appeared small and did not organize into distinct clusters that would be indicative of active IMAC within these protrusions (Fig. 1C). In agreement with this, ANKS4B was largely absent from the apical domain at the beginning of polarization, appearing mostly as distinct puncta within the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, B and C, day 0 cells, arrows). We did observe discrete examples of individual cells that appeared to have more pronounced microvilli that displayed some apical targeting of ANKS4B (see asterisk in the zoomed panel, day 2 cells), although cells with these characteristics were relatively rare at early time points. ANKS4B became rapidly enriched in the apical BB at the first appearance of clustering of microvilli at day 4; however, targeting of the scaffold was not exclusively restricted to the distal tips of microvilli (Fig. 1C, day 4). Indeed, microvilli at this time point were relatively small and immature and only formed rudimentary clusters that were not well-organized. Clear targeting to the distal tips of BB microvilli typically appeared at time points of day 6 and beyond, with microvilli forming well-structured clusters that organized into various patterns as previously seen with this cell line (Fig. 1C, days 6–14) (8Crawley S.W.

To investigate the in vivo apical targeting properties of ANKS4B, we stained mouse duodenal tissue sections and imaged the scaffold across the crypt–villus axis, which allowed us to visualize the entire life cycle of enterocytes in a single tissue section (Fig. S1B). As a marker for BB microvilli, we used an antibody that specifically recognizes the active phosphorylated form of Ezrin–Radixin–Merlin (ERM) family members that function as cytoskeletal-membrane cross-linkers (26Fehon R.G. McClatchey A.I. Bretscher A. Organizing the cell cortex: the role of ERM proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11 (20308985): 276-28710.1038/nrm2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Ezrin is the principal ERM protein expressed in the gut epithelia (27Pataky F. Pironkova R. Hudspeth A.J. Radixin is a constituent of stereocilia in hair cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101 (14983055): 2601-260610.1073/pnas.0308620100Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Berryman M. Franck Z. Bretscher A. Ezrin is concentrated in the apical microvilli of a wide variety of epithelial cells whereas moesin is found primarily in endothelial cells.J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105 (8227193): 1025-1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the active phosphorylated form (pThr567) found highly enriched in BB microvilli along the entire crypt–villus axis (29Pelaseyed T. Bretscher A. Regulation of actin-based apical structures on epithelial cells.J. Cell Sci. 2018; 131 (30333133): jcs22185310.1242/jcs.221853Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We first used the phospho-ERM signal to assess the relative length of microvilli, and hence their maturity, along the crypt–villus axis in our tissue sections (Fig. S1C, see top panel for examples of length demarcations). Microvilli found in the crypt domain and at the villus base were short and immature (Fig. S1, B and D). Microvillar length rapidly increased until the mid-villus position, where it reached a mature length of ∼1.8 μm toward the distal position of the villus (Fig. S1D). Confocal imaging revealed ANKS4B expression in both mature enterocytes on the villus surface and differentiating cells that reside in the crypt (Fig. S1B). However, the immature microvilli within the crypt were largely devoid of apical ANKS4B signal. Calculation of the ratio of apical to cytosolic signal of ANKS4B in enterocytes along the crypt–villus axis demonstrated that ANKS4B becomes apically enriched just prior to the enterocytes emerging from the crypt domain onto the villus surface (Fig. S1E; see also Fig. S1C, bottom panels for examples of cell compartment demarcations). Even at this early stage, ANKS4B signal could be seen at the distal tips of these still immature BB microvilli. Similar to microvillar length, apical signal of ANKS4B increased until the mid-villus position, where it reached its stable level of ∼10-fold enrichment over the cytosol (Fig. S1E). Together, these results suggest that ANKS4B targets to the apical domain of enterocytes after the initial genesis of BB microvilli, consistent with its proposed role in organizing microvilli during BB assembly. It was previously shown that an N-terminal fragment (aa 1–252) of ANKS4B, containing the conserved ankyrin repeat domain, exhibited robust targeting to the BB when expressed as an EGFP-fusion protein in CACO-2BBE cells (9Crawley S.W.

To begin to characterize the underlying mechanism governing apical targeting of ANKS4B, we performed a more refined structure–function analysis of this region of the scaffold. We divided the N-terminal fragment into two separate constructs: the predicted minimal ankyrin repeat domain (referred to as ANKRmin; aa 1–126) and a construct containing the unannotated sequence connecting the ANKRmin to the CEN domain, which we refer to as the Linker segment (LK; aa 119–252) (Fig. 2A). A cursory analysis of this LK segment using the PROSITE database revealed no similarity to any recognizable structured domain (30Sigrist C.J.A. de Castro E. Cerutti L. Cuche B.A. Hulo N. Bridge A.

https://openalex.org/W3038557062,"Keratin filaments (KFs) comprise the intermediate filaments of epithelial cells and are well known for their cytoprotective properties and their mechanical resilience. Although, several studies have demonstrated KFs' remarkable tensile properties relatively little is known about acute implications of mechanical stretch on KFs in living cells. This includes structural effects on the KFs and their higher level assembly structures as well as posttranslational response mechanisms to possibly modify KF's properties. We subjected simple epithelial A549 lung cells to 30% unidirectional stretch and already after 10 seconds we observed morphological changes of the KF-network as well as structural effects on their desmosomal anchor sites—both apparently caused by the tensile strain. Interestingly, the effect on the desmosomes was attenuated after 30 seconds of cell stretch with a concomitant increase in phosphorylation of keratin8-S432, keratin18-S53, and keratin18-S34 without an apparent increase in keratin solubility. When mimicking the phosphorylation of keratin18-S34 the stretch-induced effect on the desmosomes could be diminished and probing the cell surface with atomic force microscopy showed a lowered elastic modulus. We conclude that the stretch-induced KF phosphorylation affects KF's tensile properties, probably to lower the mechanical load on strained desmosomal cell-cell contacts, and hence, preserve epithelial integrity."

Skeletal muscle inflammation and inactivity are independently associated with muscle insulin resistance and atrophy. Our objective was to identify early molecular and biochemical markers in muscle from a rodent model of RA relative to control and subsequently identify commonality in muscle gene expression between this model and muscle from RA patients. Pain behaviour and locomotor activity were measured in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model of RA (n = 9) and control (n = 9) rats. Energy substrates and metabolites, total alkaline-soluble protein:DNA ratio and mRNA abundance of 46 targeted genes were also determined in Extensor digitorum longus muscle. Expression of targeted mRNAs was quantified in Vastus Lateralis muscle from RA patients (n = 7) and healthy age-matched control volunteers (n = 6). CIA rats exhibited pain behaviour (p<0.01) and reduced activity (p<0.05) compared to controls. Muscle glycogen content was less (p<0.05) and muscle lactate content greater (p<0.01) in CIA rats. The bioinformatics analysis of muscle mRNA abundance differences from the control, predicted the activation of muscle protein metabolism and inhibition of muscle carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism in CIA rats. Compared to age-matched control volunteers, RA patients exhibited altered muscle mRNA expression of 8 of the transcripts included as targets in the CIA model of RA. In conclusion, muscle energy metabolism and metabolic gene expression were altered in the CIA model, which was partly corroborated by targeted muscle mRNA measurements in RA patients. This research highlights the negative impact of RA on skeletal muscle metabolic homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3041273399,"As biomedical research becomes more data-intensive, computational reproducibility is a growing area of importance. Unfortunately, many biomedical researchers have not received formal computational training and often struggle to produce results that can be reproduced using the same data, code, and methods. Programming workshops can be a tool to teach new computational methods, but it is not always clear whether researchers are able to use their new skills to make their work more computationally reproducible.This mixed methods study consisted of in-depth interviews with 14 biomedical researchers before and after participation in an introductory programming workshop. During the interviews, participants described their research workflows and responded to a quantitative checklist measuring reproducible behaviors. The interview data was analyzed using a thematic analysis approach, and the pre and post workshop checklist scores were compared to assess the impact of the workshop on the computational reproducibility of the researchers' workflows.Pre and post scores on a checklist of reproducible behaviors did not change in a statistically significant manner. The qualitative interviews revealed that several participants had made small changes to their workflows including switching to open source programming languages for their data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Overall many of the participants indicated higher levels of programming literacy, and an interest in further training. Factors that enabled change included supportive environments and an immediate research need, while barriers included collaborators that were resistant to new tools, and a lack of time.While none of the workshop participants completely changed their workflows, many of them did incorporate new practices, tools, or methods that helped make their work more reproducible and transparent to other researchers. This indicates that programming workshops now offered by libraries and other organizations contribute to computational reproducibility training for researchers."
https://openalex.org/W3041804867,"Microctis Folium is the dried leaves of a plant (Microcos paniculata L.) used to improve the digestive system, alleviate diarrhoea, and relieve fever, but information regarding its chemical composition has rarely been reported. The traditional research approach of determining chemical composition has included isolating, purifying, and identifying compounds with high-cost and time-consuming processes. In this study, molecular networking (MN) and fingerprint analysis were integrated as a comprehensive approach to study the chemical composition of Microctis Folium by an ultra fast liquid chromatography-photo diode array detector-triple-time of flight-tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-DAD-Triple TOF-MS/MS). Large numbers of mass spectrometric data were processed to identify constituents, and the identified compounds and their unknown analogues were comprehensively depicted as visualized figures comprising distinct families by MN. A validated fingerprint methodology was established to quantitatively determine compounds in Microctis Folium. Ultimately, 165 constituents were identified in Microctis Folium for the first time and the identified compounds and approximately five hundred unknown analogues were applied to create visualized figures by MN, indicating compound groups and their chemical structure analogues in Microctis Folium. The validated fingerprint methodology was indicated to be specific, repeatable, precise, and stable and was used to determine 15 batches of samples during three seasons in three districts. Furthermore, seasonal or geographic environmental influences on the chemical profile were estimated by principal coordinate analysis. The results can be used to control the quality of Microctis Folium, observe seasonal or geographic environmental influences on the chemical profiles, and provide a reference for further exploitation of potential active unknown analogues in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3038231363,"The genus Makalata is a taxonomically complex group of rodents on which few cytogenetic studies have been performed. Most of the published karyotypes were described based only on conventional chromosome staining. Here, we studied the karyotypes of Makalata from two Brazilian Amazonian states, Amapá and Pará, by Giemsa-staining, G- and C-banding, AgNO3-staining and FISH with 18S rDNA and telomeric sequences probes. We observed 2n = 66/FN = 124 in the Pará state population in Makalata sp; and 2n = 72/FN = 128 in the Amapá state population in M. didelphoides. Multiple chromosome rearrangements may have given rise to these karyotypes, which differ significantly from each other and from those reported in the literature. The chromosomal differences among the described Makalata karyotypes can act as a barrier to gene flow; since they are also associated with geographic barriers (e.g., rivers) and numerous molecular differences, they could be seen as evidence for reproductive isolation of populations from genus Makalata. Our data suggest that the genus is chromosomally diverse and the karyotypes may belong to different species. These karyotypes may prove useful as taxonomic markers for these rodents."
https://openalex.org/W3039332308,"To decrease contamination of needleless catheter hubs, caps or port protectors impregnated with isopropanol (IPA) have been developed and shown to be superior to other disinfection methods. The safety of the caps has been questioned, as they can be associated with alcohol leakage across the hub membrane.We evaluated the use of IPA caps and the scrub-the-hub method from the safety standpoint of possible alcohol leakage across the hub membrane.Circuits imitating an intravenous line were constructed. Circuits with an IPA cap were flushed with sodium chloride after the hub had been exposed to the cap for 1 hour, 24 hours, and 7 days. At the end of each period the fluid was collected and amounts of IPA in it were measured, using gas chromatography. Scrub circuits without IPA caps were also tested and ethanol from these was measured using the same method.In this in vitro study, IPA was detected in all samples from cap circuits, and ethanol was detected from all scrub circuits. Leakage increased over time in IPA circuits. After 24 hours and 7 days of exposure, the first injection resulted in higher amounts of IPA; thereafter, the levels decreased. The amounts of ethanol measured from the scrub circuits were low.IPA caps can cause leakage of alcohol across the hub membrane. Leakage increased over time, and a 30 sec drying time was not sufficient to solve the problem. Scrub-the-hub seems safe to use with regard to alcohol leakage."
https://openalex.org/W3040793880,"Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis is the most common form of systemic amyloidosis. AL amyloidosis is caused by a misfolded light chain produced by a clonal population of plasma cells. Disease status currently is defined by measuring the absolute quantity of serum free light chain protein, but this measurement often fails to identify the subclinical presence of clonal cells that may merit additional therapy. Next generation sequencing has the sensitivity to measure the relative amount of dominating light chains within the repertoire of a patient, and this technique is in clinical use to identify clonal populations of plasma cells for multiple myeloma, a related disorder. In this proof-of-concept study, we used bone marrow aspirates of AL amyloidosis positive patients and used reverse transcription of the antibody transcriptome followed by next generation sequencing to identify antibody variable-diversity-joining gene sequences for patients with immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis, and demonstrate that this technology can be used to identify the dominant clone. The data also reveal differing patterns of overall antibody repertoire disruption in different patients. This method merits further study in larger prospective studies to establish its utility in detecting residual disease for patients with immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis."
https://openalex.org/W3041539562,"Overconfident people should be surprised that they are so often wrong. Are they? Three studies examined the relationship between confidence and surprise in order to shed light on the psychology of overprecision in judgment. Participants reported ex-ante confidence in their beliefs, and after receiving accuracy feedback, they then reported ex-post surprise. Results show that more ex-ante confidence produces less ex-post surprise for correct answers; this relationship reverses for incorrect answers. However, this sensible pattern only holds for some measures of confidence; it fails for confidence-interval measures. The results can help explain the robust durability of overprecision in judgment."
https://openalex.org/W3041889695,"Radioluminescence microscopy (RLM) is an imaging technique that allows quantitative analysis of clinical radiolabeled drugs and probes in single cells. However, the modality suffers from slow data acquisition (15-30 minutes), thus critically affecting experiments with short-lived radioactive drugs. To overcome this issue, we suggest an approach that significantly accelerates data collection. Instead of using a single scintillator to image the decay of radioactive molecules, we sandwiched the radiolabeled cells between two scintillators. As proof of concept, we imaged cells labeled with [18F]FDG, a radioactive glucose popularly used in oncology to image tumors. Results show that the double scintillator configuration increases the microscope sensitivity by two-fold, thus reducing the image acquisition time by half to achieve the same result as the single scintillator approach. The experimental results were also compared with Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation to confirm the two-fold increase in sensitivity with only minor degradation in spatial resolution. Overall, these findings suggest that the double scintillator configuration can be used to perform time-sensitive studies such as cell pharmacokinetics or cell uptake of short-lived radiotracers."
