https://openalex.org/W1596173378,"Cellular retinol-binding protein has been purified to homogeneity from rat liver. The procedures utilized in the purification included acid precipitation, gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 and G-50, and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The binding protein was purified approximately 3,500-fold, based on total soluble liver protein. The protein is a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 14,600 based on information obtained by the techniques of sedimentation equilibrium analysis, gel filtration, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. The protein binds retinol with high affinity; the appparent dissociation constant was determined by fluorometric titration to be 1.6 X 10(-8) M. Retinol bound to the protein has an absorption spectrum (lambdamax, 350 nm) considerably altered from the spectrum of retinol in ethanol (lambdamax, 325 nm)."

Extensive acetylation of histones is seen at the same time as inhibition of DNA synthesis. Nuclei from n-butyrate-treated HeLa cells remain inactive in control cytosol; control nuclei are strongly inhibited by cytosol from treated cells."
https://openalex.org/W2042718096,"Several criteria have been used to identify actin in hand-isolated nuclei of Xenopus laevis oocytes; these include co-migration with actin on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, immunological cross-reactivity with antiserum against actin, binding to DNAase I and peptide mapping on SDS gels. The use of hand-isolated nuclei precludes the possibility of contamination from cytoplasmic actin or the leakage of significant amounts of actin from nuclei during isolation. Actin constitutes roughly 6% of the total nuclear protein. Approximately 75% of the actin is diffusible under the conditions of nuclear isolation used. About 25%, however, is stably associated with an insoluble nuclear gel, in which chromosomes, nucleoli and other nuclear granules are embedded. Actin is the single most promient component of the nuclear gel, comprising roughly 16% of the total protein of the complex. The possible significance of diffusible and bound actin in these nuclei is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2143944792,"The assembly of new histones into nucleosomes and the segregation of old histones during replication were investigated using a density gradient, sedimentation equilibrium analysis of histones labeled in vivo with dense amino acids. After a 1 hr pulse of dense amino acids and 3H-lysine, nucleosomes were isolated from chick myoblast organ cultures, and the histones were cross-linked to octamers. The octamers were purified from DNA and then banded to equilibrium in cesium-formate guanidinium-HCI density gradients. The cross-linked dense octamers have the same density as the noncross-linked dense histones, and both were significantly heavier than histones synthesized in the presence of light amino acids. This experiment shows that new histone does not mix with old histone in the new nucleosomes, since the labeling protocol allows density labeling of only one histone for every seven preexisting unlabeled histones. Thus the assembly of new histone octamers is conservative. Using essentially the same experimental design, but varying the details of the labeling procedures, we also show that the dense histone octamer is stable over 3–4 generations, that neighboring octamers tend to be synthesized at the same time, and that old and new histone octamers segregate conservatively over 2–3 generations."

https://openalex.org/W2065451764,"We have analyzed the sequence complexity, frequency distribution and coding capacity of the mRNA populations of primary chick embryo muscle cultures at different stages of myogenesis. Prefusion cultures, fused myofibrillar cultures and cultures blocked for both fusion and myogenesis all contain about 17,000 different mRNA sequences, arranged in three of four abundance classes. The myofibril (96 hr) cultures, however, contain about 2500 sequences in higher concentration and six sequences in exceptionally high concentration, each present in about 15,000 copies per nucleus. These sequences are shown to be 10 times less common in premyogenic (26 hr) cultures and 40 times less common in cultures that have been blocked by BUdR against both fusion and myogenesis. The concentration of these sequences in cultures developing toward myofibril formation correlates well with the capacity of the mRNA to stimulate the cell-free synthesis of muscle-specific proteins. A more direct approach to the identity of the abundant class of myofibril mRNA indicates that it contains the templates for the synthesis of seven polypeptides that are synthesized in particularly large amounts in myogenic cultures, including myosin, actin and tropomyosin. Between 20 and 30% of the abundant mRNA is transcribed from moderately repetitive DNA sequences. The remainder of the abundant, and all of the less-abundant, mRNA is transcribed from single-copy DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2007009119,"Pinealectomized Syrian hamsters were injected thrice daily with 25 micrograms of melatonin per injection. The injections were administered at 3-hour intervals either during the day or during the night of a photoperiodic cycle of 14 hours of light and 10 hours of darkness. After 6 weeks of treatment with melatonin during the night, both pinealectomized and intact hamsters had reduced testis weight, and pinealectomized hamsters showed decreased levels of serum gonadotropins. Injection of melatonin during the day for 7 weeks either once (75 micrograms) a day or thrice (25 micrograms per injection) daily caused a reduction in testis weight in pinealectomized hamsters. Both pinealectomized and intact females injected with melatonin thrice daily during the day became anovulatory by week 7 of treatment. These results are similar to those observed when hamsters are exposed to a short photoperiod, suggesting that melatonin may be acting as a hormone in mediating the effects of photoperiod on the reproductive system of the Syrian hamster."
https://openalex.org/W2032551297,"The sensitivity to deoxyribonuclease I (DNAase I) of integrated adenovirus genes that encode mRNA has been compared to the sensitivity of adjacent viral DNA sequences that are not expressed as mRNA in two lines of adenovirus type 5-transformed hamster cells. We determined the concentrations of integrated DNA sequences homologous to different regions of the viral genome before and after mild DNAase I digestion of intact nuclei by measuring the rate of reassociation of restriction endonuclease fragments of labeled adenovirus DNA in the presence of DNA isolated from untreated and digested transformed cell nuclei. The HT14A cell line contains 2.4 copies of the left-hand 35% of the adenovirus type 5 genome per diploid quantity of cell DNA. Integrated sequences that are preferentially sensitive to DNAase I include all those encoding mRNA and some additional sequences, equivalent to 3−4 nucleosomes, to the 5′ side of the stable mRNA transcript. These results indicate that there is a striking correspondence, to within 3–4 nucleosomes, between the structure of an active transcription unit and the stable mRNA sequences encoded by it. The second cell line examined, HT14B, contains 5.5 copies of the left-hand 40% of the adenovirus type 5 genome per diploid quantity of cell DNA. Of the sequences complementary to viral mRNA, only half are preferentially sensitive to DNAase I. By contrast, the majority of the integrated viral DNA sequences that are not expressed as mRNA are resistant to DNAase I digestion in both this and the HT14A cell line. The results observed with HT14B cells suggest that only half of the integrated adenovirus sequences are in a chromatin conformation that permits transcription to occur."

https://openalex.org/W1542833412,"Fibroblasts isolated by enzymic digestion of chick embryo tendons were incubated for several hours in suspension under conditions in which they were in steady state in terms of the synthesis and secretion of procollagen. Under these conditions, the cells synthesized and secreted about 630 microgram of procollagen/10(9) cells/h. The cells were labeled with [14C]proline for 15 to 120 min and then the kinetics of secretion were followed by chasing the label and assaying the 14C-peptides digestible by collagenase in the cells and in the medium. The results demonstrated that secretion of collagenase-digestible peptides did not follow the kinetics of a single first order process but suggested at least two pseudo-first order process with half-times of 14 and 115 min. The [14C]procollagen secreted during 0 to 30 min and 90 to 120 min of chase was the same in terms of the ratio of pro-alpha1 to pro-alpha2 chains, the size of the pro-alpha chains, the extent of interchain disulfide bonding, the extent of prolyl hydroxylation, and the degree of helicity as tested by resistance to pepsin digestion. Addition of ascorbic acid to the incubation medium increased slightly the extent of prolyl hydroxylation but did not alter the kinetics of secretion. The results suggested that the kinetics of secretion are influenced by a two-compartment system in which at least one metabolic pool contributing to the secretory process is present as a side pocket."
https://openalex.org/W1552663214,"Interferon production was induced in mouse Ehrlich ascites tumor cells by infection with Newcastle disease virus. The interferon produced was purified by precipitation with ammonium sulfate, chromatography on carboxymethyl-Sephadex, treatment with blue dextran and polyethylene glycol, gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-60 and Bio-Gel P-200, chromatography on phosphocellulose, isoelectric focusing, and chromatography on octyl-Sepharose. The specific activity of the product was 1.6 x 10(9) NIH mouse interferon reference standard units/mg of protein. Electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated that the apparent molecular weight of the interferon-active material ranged from 25,000 to 35,000. As revealed by staining the gels with Coomassie brilliant blue, the interferon activity co-migrated with the major, broad protein band. Minor, stainable bands of proteins were free of interferon activity and their apparent molecular weight was smaller than 12,000."

https://openalex.org/W1486447264,"The complete covalent structure of the membranous segment of horse liver cytochrome b5 has been determined. This peptide spans residues 91 to 133 of the cytochrome molecule, and contains the segment responsible for the association of the hemoprotein with microsomal or synthetic vesicles. Two peptides, residues 91 to 127 and 128 to 133, comprising the entire membranous moiety were isolated from a tryptic digest of urea-denatured apoprotein. The membranous segment (residues 91 to 127) could be separated from all other tryptic peptides by a single gel filtration step. Trypsin digestion of succinylated cytochrome produced similar peptides, residues 89 to 127 and 128 to 133. The covalent structures for residues 89 to 127 and 128 to 133 were derived from automated sequenator analysis of tryptic peptides. Chemical cleavage at tryptophanyl, or methionyl residues, or both, by the method of Ozols and Gerard ((1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 5986-5989) provided the overlapping peptides from which the following unique sequence was deduced: (formula: see text)."

https://openalex.org/W1968120710,"A second and minor DNA component containing 5S RNA genes has been purified from the genomic DNA of Xenopus laevis (Xlt 5S DNA). Some of Its physical and chemical characteristics are described. It contains a 5S RNA gene sequence which has some oocyte and some somatic-specific residues, as well as nucleotides which differ from both types of 5S RNA. There are about 2000 of these 5S RNA genes per haploid complement of DNA compared to about 24,000 of the principal oocyte 5S RNA genes. The multiple repeating units of Xlt 5S DNA are homogeneous in length (about 350 base pairs). We present evidence that Xlt 5S RNA is transcribed in ovaries but not in somatic cells; Xlt 5S DNA may therefore be under the same control as the major oocyte 5S DNA."

Cultured cells respond to parathyroid hormone and exhibit a marked rise in alkaline phosphatase activity during proliferation, which suggests the progressive differentiation or preferential growth of osteoblast-like cells."

https://openalex.org/W2108755343,"Cytoplasm from unfertilized eggs of the frog Xenopus laevis was separated by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography into nine fractions. Supercoiled pXir 11 DNA molecules (pXir 11 is a Col El-based recombinant plasmid containing part of the Xenopus laevis 18S and 28S ribosomal genes and transcribed spacer region) were incubated with each fraction singly and in various combinations. After incubation for 4 hr at 26 degrees C, the pXir 11 DNA was reisolated and examined by electron microscopy. Using appropriate reaction conditions (pH 7.2, 10 mM Mg2+, 250 micron NTP, 50 50 micron dNTP, 50 MM KCl, fractions III and IV or VI), at least 5-10% of the input DNA was converted to theta structures (presumed intermediates in DNA replication)."

https://openalex.org/W2168593111,"Abstract The cellular property of being able to grow on agar (aga + ) or to show anchorage independence has been transferred by means of metaphase chromosomes from CHO cells to BHK and other permanent transformed hamster lines unable to grow on agar. As with other genetic markers, the transferents are unstable when grown under non-selective conditions. The aga + transferents are tumorigenic, providing further evidence for the association between the ability to grow in agar or anchorage independence and tumorigenicity. Evidence has been obtained in these experiments for the existence of at least two discrete events in the transformation of normal into tumorigenic cells. The ability to transfer and select for the aga + marker in recipient cells indicates that tumorigenicity behaves dominantly phenotypically."

https://openalex.org/W2107421562,"The rate and equilibrium constants for the information of a number of metmyoglobin species Mb+X (X = imidazole, imidazole-H-, 1-methylimidazole, 2-methylimidazole, 4-nitroimidazole, 2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole, pyridine, 2-, 3-, and 4-picoline) and the rates of their reduction by dithionite have been measured at 25 degrees. Several different kinds of kinetic behavior for the reduction were observed. In all cases, a rate constant for direct reaction of Mb+X with SO2- can be assessed. The data strongly support attack of SO2- on the ligand, followed by electron transfer through the pi system to the metal ion."

https://openalex.org/W1496242626,"Abstract Experiments involving the co-incubation of wild type (A3) cells of Dictyostelium discoideum and a spontaneous aggregation-minus mutant (HW 2) suggested that the mutant was defective in cellular interactions. The inhibition of A3 development by HW 2 cells and the differentiation of a small fraction of HW 2 cells which is allowed by A3 cells, both depend on cell contact. Therefore, we compared cell surface molecules in vegetative A3 and HW 2 cells by a variety of techniques to determine whether defects in HW 2 could be found prior to the inhibition of development in vegetative amoebae. Antigenic defects, or differences in binding of concanavalin A, or both, were localized to three plasma membrane macromolecules using glutaraldehyde-fixed sodium dodecyl sulfate gels of plasma membranes. Two periodic acid-Schiff-positive glycoproteins, and one glycolipid also differed in HW 2. Three glycoproteins had an increased sensitivity to pronase in isolated plasma membranes suggesting an alteration in their topography. Glycoprotein E, the major glycoprotein of vegetative plasma membranes is abnormal in topography, altered as a concanavalin A receptor, and is antigenically abnormal."

One nucleus (dinokaryotic) has permanently condensed chromosomes, while the other (eukaryotic) does not have morphologically distinct chromosomes. Acid extracts of chromatin prepared from a mixture of dinokaryotic and eukaryotic nuclei and purified eukaryotic nuclei give four bands that co-migrate with four of the five histones from calf thymus when analyzed in urea-containing polyacrylamide gels."
https://openalex.org/W1578116886,"Formate-induced inactivation of pig heart mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase by beta-chloro-L-alanine resulted in the modification of the epsilon-amino group of the lysyl residue which is involved in the formation of an aldimine bond with 4-formyl group of the coenzyme, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. The tryptic peptide isolated from the labeled site of the enzyme was composed of 25 residues and exhibited positive circular dichroism at 325 and 254 nm where the pyridoxyl chromophore of the labeled site peptide absorbs, while the phosphopyridoxyl peptide isolated from the boro-hydride-reduced enzyme did not show any ellipticity in this spectral region. Its comparison with the analogous tryptic peptide from the labeled site of the cytosolic isoenzyme revealed a high degree of homology in their primary structures as well as in spectral properties. Structural analysis of the labeled site peptide and mechanistic consideration of the labeling process indicated that with both isoenzymes the phosphopyridoxyl group is covalently bound to the alpha amino group of the alanyl moiety derived from beta-chloro-L-alanine, the beta carbon of which is covalently linked to the epsilon-amino group of the lysyl residue."

The learned experience was completely recognizable by the naive eye that had been occluded during training. When both eyes were opened after monocular training, the velocity of blood flow through paired left and right brain regions was identical. However, when chicks were reexposed to the discrimination situation, blood flow through the cerebral hemisphere associated with the naive eye was greater than that through the hemisphere associated with the trained eye."
https://openalex.org/W1598892284,"The kinetic parameters of beef heart cytoplasmic and pig heart mitochondrial malate dehydrogenases have been examined over a wide range of enzyme concentration. No significant changes are observed in these properties. In conjunction with active enzyme sedimentation and sedimentation equilibrium experiments, it is concluded that there is no evidence for dissociation of the dimeric enzyme at any enyzme level in the kinetic analyses. Thus, if dissociation occurs, it must be too slow to be of significance in determining the kinetic properties of the enzyme. It is shown that unless a subunit and its dimeric form have identical kinetic and substrate binding characteristics, the kinetic parameters should change as a function of enzyme concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1598449591,"Abstract The basidiomycete Schizophyllum commune produces three chromatographically distinguishable proteases which are capable of attack on a variety of other enzymes from S. commune and other sources. These proteases, which are produced during a specific phase of the development cycle, exhibit typical enzyme kinetic patterns, are active in the neutral to weakly alkaline pH range and are inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and ovomucoid. No pattern of specificity toward the test enzymes could be discerned. The proteases co-purify with the activity which causes the increase in cold lability of S. commune phosphoglucomutase reported previously. In addition, one of the protease enzymes could be purified to the point where it had no significant ability to release trichloroacetic acid products from denatured substrates at pH 3 or pH 7. When undenatured hemoglobin was used as a substrate, the purified protease releases a relatively large molecular weight nonheme peptide. Relatively large peptides are also formed after proteolysis of rabbit muscle phosphoglucomutase. These results suggest that the protease carries out only limited proteolysis."

These pepsinogen crystals were dissolved, activated, and assayed for proteolytic activity. The specific enzymic activity of the dissolved crystalline protein was nearly twice that of the commerical pepsinogen from which the crystals were grown. Incubation at pH 8 before assay demonstrated that the crystals are free of pepsin. This crystal form of pepsinogen belongs to the monoclinic space group C2 with 4 molecules in the unit cell. The unit cell dimensions are a = 104.8 +/- 0.5 A, b = 43.1 +/- 0.1 A, c = 88.4 +/- 0.3 A, and beta = 91.3 degrees."
