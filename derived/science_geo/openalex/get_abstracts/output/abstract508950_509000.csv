https://openalex.org/W1992373870,"Functional connectivity (FC) and graph measures provide powerful means to analyze complex networks. The current study determines the inter-subject-variability using the coefficient of variation (CoV) and long-term test-retest-reliability (TRT) using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) in 44 healthy subjects with 35 having a follow-up at years 1 and 2. FC was estimated from 256-channel-EEG by the phase-lag-index (PLI) and weighted PLI (wPLI) during an eyes-closed resting state condition. PLI quantifies the asymmetry of the distribution of instantaneous phase differences of two time-series and signifies, whether a consistent non-zero phase lag exists. WPLI extends the PLI by additionally accounting for the magnitude of the phase difference. Signal-space global and regional PLI/wPLI and weighted first-order graph measures, i.e. normalized clustering coefficient (gamma), normalized average path length (lambda), and the small-world-index (SWI) were calculated for theta-, alpha1-, alpha2- and beta-frequency bands. Inter-subject variability of global PLI was low to moderate over frequency bands (0.12<CoV<0.28), higher for wPLI (0.25<CoV<0.55) and very low for gamma, lambda and SWI (CoV<0.048). TRT was good to excellent for global PLI/wPLI (0.68<ICC<0.80), regional PLI/wPLI (0.58<ICC<0.77), and fair to good for graph measures (0.32<ICC<0.73) except wPLI-based lambda in alpha1 (ICC = 0.12). Inter-electrode distance correlated very weakly with inter-electrode PLI (-0.06<rho<0) and weakly with inter-electrode wPLI (-0.22<rho<-0.18). Global PLI/wPLI and topographic connectivity patterns differed between frequency bands, and all individual networks showed a small-world-configuration. PLI/wPLI based network characterization derived from high-resolution EEG has apparently good reliability, which is one important requirement for longitudinal studies exploring the effects of chronic brain diseases over several years."

Here we showed that the TAK1-JNK pathway, a MAPK signaling pathway, is activated through lysosome rupture and that this activation is necessary for the complete activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome through the oligomerization of an adapter protein, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC). We also revealed that the activation of the TAK1-JNK pathway is sustained through Ca2+ ions and that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II functions upstream of the TAK1-JNK pathway and specifically regulates lysosome rupture-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These data suggest a novel role for the TAK1-JNK pathway as a critical regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Lysosome rupture triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages.

https://openalex.org/W2022568896,"Climate change is impacting agro-ecosystems, crops, and farmer livelihoods in communities worldwide. While it is well understood that more frequent and intense climate events in many areas are resulting in a decline in crop yields, the impact on crop quality is less acknowledged, yet it is critical for food systems that benefit both farmers and consumers through high-quality products. This study examines tea (Camellia sinensis; Theaceae), the world's most widely consumed beverage after water, as a study system to measure effects of seasonal precipitation variability on crop functional quality and associated farmer knowledge, preferences, and livelihoods. Sampling was conducted in a major tea producing area of China during an extreme drought through the onset of the East Asian Monsoon in order to capture effects of extreme climate events that are likely to become more frequent with climate change. Compared to the spring drought, tea growth during the monsoon period was up to 50% higher. Concurrently, concentrations of catechin and methylxanthine secondary metabolites, major compounds that determine tea functional quality, were up to 50% lower during the monsoon while total phenolic concentrations and antioxidant activity increased. The inverse relationship between tea growth and concentrations of individual secondary metabolites suggests a dilution effect of precipitation on tea quality. The decrease in concentrations of tea secondary metabolites was accompanied by reduced farmer preference on the basis of sensory characteristics as well as a decline of up to 50% in household income from tea sales. Farmer surveys indicate a high degree of agreement regarding climate patterns and the effects of precipitation on tea yields and quality. Extrapolating findings from this seasonal study to long-term climate scenario projections suggests that farmers and consumers face variable implications with forecasted precipitation scenarios and calls for research on management practices to facilitate climate adaptation for sustainable crop production."
https://openalex.org/W1979329156,"Thirdhand smoke (THS) refers to components of secondhand smoke that stick to indoor surfaces and persist in the environment. Little is known about exposure levels and possible remediation measures to reduce potential exposure in contaminated areas. This study deals with the effect of aging on THS components and evaluates possible exposure levels and remediation measures. We investigated the concentration of nicotine, five nicotine related alkaloids, and three tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) in smoke exposed fabrics. Two different extraction methods were used. Cotton terry cloth and polyester fleece were exposed to smoke in controlled laboratory conditions and aged before extraction. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used for chemical analysis. Fabrics aged for 19 months after smoke exposure retained significant amounts of THS chemicals. During aqueous extraction, cotton cloth released about 41 times as much nicotine and about 78 times the amount of tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) as polyester after one hour of aqueous extraction. Concentrations of nicotine and TSNAs in extracts of terry cloth exposed to smoke were used to estimate infant/toddler oral exposure and adult dermal exposure to THS. Nicotine exposure from THS residue can be 6.8 times higher in toddlers and 24 times higher in adults and TSNA exposure can be 16 times higher in toddlers and 56 times higher in adults than what would be inhaled by a passive smoker. In addition to providing exposure estimates, our data could be useful in developing remediation strategies and in framing public health policies for indoor environments with THS."

In this study, we analyzed the immune characteristics of 99 consecutive previously diagnosed CLL patients and 50 healthy controls. The distribution of lymphocyte subsets at diagnosis was retrospectively analyzed. Compared with controls, leukemia patients showed an expansion of NK and CD8 T cells at diagnosis. The relative number of CD8 T cells at diagnosis was associated with time to treatment, suggesting that CD8 T cells may modify disease progression. The distribution of lymphocyte subsets was analyzed again when patients were enrolled in this study. The median time since these patients were diagnosed was 277 weeks. Compared with diagnosis, the absolute number of CD8 T cells significantly decreased in these patients, reaching similar values to healthy controls; however NK cells kept significantly elevated overtime. Nevertheless, NK cells showed an impaired expression of NKG2D receptor and a defective cytotoxic activity. This down-regulation of NKG2D expression was further enhanced in patients with advanced and progressive disease. Additionally, membrane NKG2D levels significantly decreased on CD8 T cells, but a significant increase of NKG2D+CD4+ T cells was observed in CLL patients. The cytotoxic activity of NK cells was diminished in CLL patients; however the treatments with IL-2, IL-15, IL-21 and lenalidomide were able to restore their activity. The effect of IL-2 and IL-15 was associated with the increase of NKG2D expression on immune cells, but the effect of IL-21 and lenalidomide was not due to NKG2D up-regulation. The expansion of NK cells and the reversibility of NK cell defects provide new opportunities for the immunotherapeutic intervention in CLL."
https://openalex.org/W2054922959,"Few data on services for people with severe multiple sclerosis (MS) are available. The Palliative Network for Severely Affected Adults with MS in Italy (PeNSAMI) developed a home palliative care program for MS patients and carers, preceded by a literature review and qualitative study (here reported).To identify unmet needs of people with severe MS living at home by qualitative research involving key stakeholders, and theorize broad areas of intervention to meet those needs.Data were collected from: at least 10 personal interviews with adults with severe MS (primary/secondary progressive, EDSS≥8.0); three focus group meetings (FGs) of carers of people with severe MS; and two FGs of health professionals (HPs). Grounded theory guided the analysis of interview and FG transcripts, from which the areas of intervention were theorized.Between October 2012 and May 2013, 22 MS patients, 30 carers and 18 HPs participated. Forty-eight needs themes were identified, grouped into 14 categories and four domains. Seven, highly interdependent intervention areas were theorized. Patients had difficulties expressing needs; experiences of burden and loneliness were prominent, chiefly in dysfunctional, less affluent families, and among parent carers. Needs differed across Italy with requirements for information and access to services highest in the South. All participants voiced a strong need for qualified personnel and care coordination in day-to-day home care. Personal hygiene emerged as crucial, as did the need for a supportive network and preservation of patient/carer roles within family and community.Unmet needs transcended medical issues and embraced organizational and psychosocial themes, as well as health policies. The high interdependence of the seven intervention areas theorized is in line with the multifaceted approach of palliative care. At variance with typical palliative contexts, coping with disability rather than end-of-life was a major concern of patients and carers."
https://openalex.org/W2331704657,"It is increasingly important to understand the molecular basis for the plasticity of neoplastic cells and their capacity to transition between differentiated and stemlike phenotypes. Kruppel-like factor-9 (KLF9), a member of the large KLF transcription factor family, has emerged as a regulator of oncogenesis, cell differentiation, and neural development; however, the molecular basis for the diverse contextual functions of KLF9 remains unclear. This study focused on the functions of KLF9 in human glioblastoma stemlike cells. We established for the first time a genome-wide map of KLF9-regulated targets in human glioblastoma stemlike cells and show that KLF9 functions as a transcriptional repressor and thereby regulates multiple signaling pathways involved in oncogenesis and stem cell regulation. A detailed analysis of one such pathway, integrin signaling, showed that the capacity of KLF9 to inhibit glioblastoma cell stemness and tumorigenicity requires ITGA6 repression. These findings enhance our understanding of the transcriptional networks underlying cancer cell stemness and differentiation and identify KLF9-regulated molecular targets applicable to cancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W1982423965,"Sterile α motif and histidine-aspartate domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) plays a critical role in inhibiting HIV infection, curtailing the pool of dNTPs available for reverse transcription of the viral genome. Recent structural data suggested a compelling mechanism for the regulation of SAMHD1 enzymatic activity and revealed dGTP-induced association of two inactive dimers into an active tetrameric enzyme. Here, we present the crystal structures of SAMHD1 catalytic core (residues 113-626) tetramers, complexed with mixtures of nucleotides, including dGTP/dATP, dGTP/dCTP, dGTP/dTTP, and dGTP/dUTP. The combined structural and biochemical data provide insight into dNTP promiscuity at the secondary allosteric site and how enzymatic activity is modulated. In addition, we present biochemical analyses of GTP-induced SAMHD1 full-length tetramerization and the structure of SAMHD1 catalytic core tetramer in complex with GTP/dATP, revealing the structural basis of GTP-mediated SAMHD1 activation. Altogether, the data presented here advance our understanding of SAMHD1 function during cellular homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1995750928,"Stefin B (cystatin B) is an endogenous cysteine cathepsin inhibitor, and the loss-of-function mutations in the stefin B gene were reported in patients with Unverricht-Lundborg disease (EPM1). In this study we demonstrated that stefin B-deficient (StB KO) mice were significantly more sensitive to the lethal LPS-induced sepsis and secreted higher amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 in the serum. We further showed that increased caspase-11 gene expression and better pro-inflammatory caspase-1 and -11 activation determined in StB KO bone marrow-derived macrophages resulted in enhanced IL-1β processing. Pretreatment of macrophages with the cathepsin inhibitor E-64d did not affect secretion of IL-1β, suggesting that the increased cathepsin activity determined in StB KO bone marrow-derived macrophages is not essential for inflammasome activation. Upon LPS stimulation, stefin B was targeted into the mitochondria, and the lack of stefin B resulted in the increased destabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial superoxide generation. Collectively, our study demonstrates that the LPS-induced sepsis in StB KO mice is dependent on caspase-11 and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species but is not associated with the lysosomal destabilization and increased cathepsin activity in the cytosol.

Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome induced by infection, is characterized by multiple organ failures and hemodynamic shock (1.Cohen J. The immunopathogenesis of sepsis.Nature. 2002; 420: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component on the surface of Gram-negative bacteria, is a potent inducer of sepsis and inflammation and acts by stimulating immune system cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. Upon LPS binding and receptor homodimerization, the signal-transducing adaptor proteins become associated with the receptor and trigger the downstream signaling pathway leading to the activation of NF-κB (2.Kawai T. Akira S. The role of pattern-recognition receptors in innate immunity: update on Toll-like receptors.Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (6189) Google Scholar, 3.Medzhitov R. Recognition of microorganisms and activation of the immune response.Nature. 2007; 449: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). Members of the NLR family (NLR proteins, Nlrp) and the adaptor ASC form multiprotein complexes, termed inflammasomes, that are required for the activation of the pro-inflammatory caspase-1 that processes pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and pro-IL-18 into mature forms (4.Martinon F. Tschopp J. Inflammatory caspases and inflammasomes: master switches of inflammation.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 10-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 5.Latz E. Xiao T.S. Stutz A. Activation and regulation of the inflammasomes.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). The inflammasome activity should be tightly regulated to defend the host while limiting the excessive inflammation and immunopathology. Nlrp3 inflammasome is the best characterized as a central regulator of inflammation, which regulates caspase-1 and IL-1β production in myeloid cells (4.Martinon F. Tschopp J. Inflammatory caspases and inflammasomes: master switches of inflammation.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 10-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 5.Latz E. Xiao T.S. Stutz A.

Immunol. 2009; 183: 787-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar). Besides the priming step, there are three main cellular processes described in the literature that lead to Nlrp3 inflammasome activation (5.Latz E. Xiao T.S. Stutz A. Activation and regulation of the inflammasomes.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar, 7.Rathinam V.A. Vanaja S.K. Fitzgerald K.A. Regulation of inflammasome signaling.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The first is the pannexin-1 membrane pore formation via the ATP-gated P2X7 ion channel and K+ efflux (8.Kahlenberg J.M. Dubyak G.R. Mechanisms of caspase-1 activation by P2X7 receptor-mediated K+ release.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 286: C1100-C1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The second way of Nlrp3 activation is the phagocytosis of crystalline or particulate structures. The proposed mechanism suggests that phagocytosis triggers lysosomal destabilization and subsequent release of the lysosomal content, including lysosomal cathepsin proteases, into the cytosol. However, it is not known yet whether the cathepsins interact directly with the inflammasome or whether the process involves molecules activated by the cathepsins (9.Halle A. Hornung V. Petzold G.C.

Silica crystals and aluminum salts activate the NALP3 inflammasome through phagosomal destabilization.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). The third model proposes that generation of the reactive oxygen species up-regulates activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome. The role of mitochondria in the inflammasome activation has been recently elucidated by blocking the key enzymes of the respiratory chain, which resulted in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, a vast ROS generation and IL-1β secretion (11.Zhou R.

Recently, in addition to the canonical (LPS and ATP) Nlrp3 inflammasome signaling, a new noncanonical inflammasome pathway has been described, where caspase-11 is engaged in response to a number of Gram-negative bacteria. Caspase-11 is involved in Nlrp3-dependent activation of caspase-1 leading to IL-1β processing and secretion or in the Nlrp3- and caspase-1-independent pathway leading to cell death (13.Rathinam V.A.

In this study, we describe a series of in vivo and in vitro experiments showing that stefin B deficiency profoundly influences the Nlrp3 inflammasome activation and viability of mice in response to LPS. In particular, the data strongly suggest that the lack of stefin B results in an increase of caspase-11 expression, pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and IL-18 serum concentrations, and mitochondrial ROS formation. Thus, the traits observed in StB KO mice result from an increased sensitivity of these mice to inflammation rather than increased enzymatic activity of cathepsin proteases.

Recombinant mouse macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) was purchased from eBioscience and used at a final concentration of 40 ng/ml. The cysteine protease inhibitor E-64d was purchased from the Peptide Research Institute and used at a final concentration of 15 µm. Stefin B (cystatin B)-deficient mice were created as described previously (28.Pennacchio L.A. Bouley D.M. Higgins K.M. Scott M.P. Noebels J.L. Myers R.M. Progressive ataxia, myoclonic epilepsy, and cerebellar apoptosis in cystatin B-deficient mice.Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and were provided by Dr. R. M. Myers, Stanford University, and bred in our local colony. Mice (8–12 weeks of age) used in this study were wild type (WT) and StB KO, fully backcrossed to FVB/N background. All mouse studies were conducted in accordance with protocols approved by the Veterinary Administration of the Republic of Slovenia and the Government Ethical Committee. Procedures for animal care and use were in accordance with the “PHS Policy on Human Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” and the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.” Mouse primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were obtained by ex vivo differentiation from mouse bone marrow progenitors in the presence of M-CSF over 7 days, as described previously (32.Weischenfeldt J. Porse B. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM): isolation and applications.CSH Protoc. 2008; (10.1101/pdb.prot5080)PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were kept in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and M-CSF. The cDNA clone for stefin B was obtained from Image (IMAGE, 3453675). It was PCR-amplified, tagged, and cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) at HindIII and XhoI restriction sites (24.Ceru S. Konjar S. Maher K. Repnik U. Krizaj I. Bencina M. Renko M. Nepveu A. Zerovnik E. Turk B. Kopitar-Jerala N. Stefin B interacts with histones and cathepsin L in the nucleus.J. Biol.

Raw-blue cells (InvivoGen) were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 and pcDNA/stefin B-HisTag plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Raw-blue cells (InvivoGen) were derived from the murine RAW 264.7 macrophages with chromosomal integration of a secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter construct inducible by NF-κB and AP-1. Cells were grown according to the manufacturer's protocol. Upon TLR activation, the signaling pathway leads to activation of the NF-κB-dependent secretion of SEAP. Quanti-blue medium (InvivoGen) was used for detection and quantification of SEAP, according to the manufacturer's protocol. SEAP activity was assessed by reading OD at 655 nm with a microplate reader (Tecan). BMDMs were prepared as described above and seeded in 6-well plates (106 cells/well) for lysate preparation or in 96-well plates (105 cells/well) for supernatant collection. Cell were stimulated as indicated. Briefly, LPS (100 ng/ml) were primed for 4 h, washed with PBS, pH 7.2, and then ATP (5 mm) was applied for 20 min. For cytokine analysis in the serum, StB KO and WT mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS at 10 mg/kg (E. coli 055:B5, Sigma). Blood was taken before (0 h) and 2, 4, and 6 h after the LPS administration. The serum was prepared by removing the clot by centrifuging at 2000 rpm for 10 min in a refrigerated centrifuge; the resulting supernatants were collected, and the serum levels of the cytokines were determined by flow cytometry. For the viability study, WT and StB KO mice were injected intraperitoneally with a high dose of LPS at 30 mg/kg (E. coli 055:B5, Sigma) and monitored six times daily over the 96 h. Monolayer BMDMs at 80% confluence were first washed with ice-cold PBS, followed by the direct addition of the radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer supplemented with the Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) Cell lysates were prepared as described previously (33.Kopitar-Jerala N. Schweiger A. Myers R.M. Turk V. Turk B. Sensitization of stefin B-deficient thymocytes towards staurosporin-induced apoptosis is independent of cysteine cathepsins.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2149-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the cell lysates was measured using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). The lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by Western blotting as described previously (33.Kopitar-Jerala N. Schweiger A. Myers R.M. Turk V. Turk B. Sensitization of stefin B-deficient thymocytes towards staurosporin-induced apoptosis is independent of cysteine cathepsins.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2149-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The proteins were visualized with ECL (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cytosolic cathepsin activity assay was performed in a 96-well plate by using sensitive fluorogenic substrates Z-Arg-Arg-AMC (Z-RR-AMC) and Z-Phe-Arg-AMC (Z-FR-AMC) (Bachem). The treated cells were partially lysed with an acetate buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 5.6) containing 15 µg/ml digitonin (for the cytosolic cathepsin activity) for 12 min on ice as described (34.Zhang H. Zhong C. Shi L. Guo Y. Fan Z. Granulysin induces cathepsin B release from lysosomes of target tumor cells to attack mitochondria through processing of bid leading to necroptosis.J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 6993-7000Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Immediately after the incubation on ice, the substrate (30 µm)-containing acetate buffer was added, and the liberation of AMC was measured using a fluorimeter (Tecan). Total RNA was isolated from the BMDMs after stimulation with LPS using PureLink RNA mini kit (Ambion), followed by DNase treatment using TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion). RNA concentrations and A260/A230 and A260/A280 ratios were assessed spectrophotometrically using NanoDrop, whereas RNA integrity was confirmed by 1.2% gel electrophoresis. cDNA was synthesized from RNA with Precision nanoScript Reverse Transcription kit (Primer Design Ltd.) using random nanomer primers. The following primers designed by Primer Design were used for the real time quantitative PCR: IL-1β (Il1b) sense, 5′-GCTATGGCAACTGTTCCTGAA-3′, and antisense, 5′-ACAGCCCAGGTCAAAGGTT-3′; IL-18 (Il18) sense, 5′-CCAAGTTCTCTTCGTTGACAAAA-3′, and antisense, 5′-GTCCTCTTACTTCACTGTCTTTG-3′; caspase-1 (Casp1) sense, 5′-CTGCGGTGTAGAAAAGAAACG-3′, and antisense, 5′-TCCATTTATTGTCCCTATACTCACT-3′; caspase-11 (Casp4) sense, 5′-GCTACGATGTGGTGGTGAAA-3′, and antisense, 5′-GGAATGTGCTGTCTGATGTCT-3′. Real time PCR was run on Mx3005P system (Agilent, Stratagene products) using the following thermal profile: 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Additionally, a melting curve (55–95 °C) was performed at the end of each run. The mRNA expressions of target genes were normalized to the expression of Gapdh and B2m, which were confirmed to be the most stably expressed reference genes by mouse geNorm reference gene selection kit (Primer Design). The mRNA expression of genes was calculated considering their real time PCR efficiencies using REST 2009 (Relative Expression Software Tool) and presented as a fold increase, relative to the unstimulated cells (control). The mRNA expression levels of genes in control samples were normalized to 1.0. WT and StB KO BMDMs were grown on six 10-cm culture dishes. The attached cells were washed two times with PBS on the dish and then overlaid with 10 ml of PBS with 1% formaldehyde for fixation at room temperature for 10–15 min with occasional shaking. After fixation, the dishes were washed once with PBS containing 125 mm glycine and two times with cold PBS, and then the cell nuclei were isolated as described (35.Nekrasov M. Amrichova J. Parker B.J. Soboleva T.A. Jack C. Williams R. Huttley G.A. Tremethick D.J. Histone H2A.Z inheritance during the cell cycle and its impact on promoter organization and dynamics.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 3 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The nuclear preparation was digested with 60 units/ml micrococcal nuclease (Nuclease7, Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 30 min with occasional shaking to achieve ∼150-bp-long mononucleosome fragments. The reaction was terminated by 10 mm EDTA. Nuclei were centrifuged for 5 min at 7500 rpm, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of L-CHIP buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), 1 mm PMSF, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and sonicated once at setting 2 for 10 s on Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher, model 100). The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml with L-CHIP buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against histone H3 dimethyl K9 (Abcam, ab1220 ChIP grade) as described (36.Popova E.Y. Xu X. DeWan A.T. Salzberg A.C. Berg A. Hoh J. Zhang S.S. Barnstable C.J. Stage- and gene-specific signatures defined by histones H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 accompany mammalian retina maturation in vivo.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e46867Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Before immunoprecipitation, an aliquot of the nuclear lysate was saved for isolation of input DNA. Immunoprecipitated (ChIP) and input chromatin (Input) were treated with 0.5 mg/ml of proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) and RNase A (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 30 min and uncross-linked by incubating at 65 °C overnight. DNA was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform and once with chloroform and ethanol precipitated with glycogen (Roche Applied Science) and sodium acetate. DNA was dissolved in 50 µl of water and used to prepare libraries with NEBNext ChIP-Seq Library Prep Reagent Set for Illumina (E6200). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 Genome Analyzer at the Pennsylvania State University Genomic Core Facility. ChIP-sequencing reads were mapped to the mouse genome with bowtie 0.12.9 software using the default parameters and the provided index NCBI37/mm9. Sequence reads mapped to multiple genomic locations were excluded from subsequent analysis. All sequence reads and input DNA reads were normalized to genome average, and the ratio of normalized ChIP sequence versus the nonfractionated input DNA was calculated for the promoter-containing region (1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site) and the open reading frame (1 kb downstream of the transcriptional start site) of the mouse caspase-11 gene (Casp4). The levels of secreted cytokines in the BMDM culture supernatants and mice sera were quantified by bead-based multiplex immunoassay for the flow cytometer (FlowCytomixTM, eBioscience), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lysosomes in primed and stimulated BMDMs were stained with the fluorescent acidotropic probe LysoTracker Green probe (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, as described previously (37.špes A. Sobotic B. Turk V. Turk B. Cysteine cathepsins are not critical for TRAIL- and CD95-induced apoptosis in several human cancer cell lines.Biol. Chem. 2012; 393: 1417-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in BMDMs was determined by the MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Invitrogen) uptake, as described previously (37.špes A. Sobotic B. Turk V. Turk B. Cysteine cathepsins are not critical for TRAIL- and CD95-induced apoptosis in several human cancer cell lines.Biol. Chem. 2012; 393: 1417-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). MitoSOX Red (Invitrogen) was used as a mitochondrial superoxide indicator in WT and StB-deficient BMDMs. Upon 4 h of LPS treatment, cells were washed with warm PBS and loaded with 5 µm MitoSOX in PBS for 15 min at 37 °C. ATP was added thereafter for 20 min where indicated. Cells were harvested, pelleted at 1000 rpm for 5 min, immediately resuspended in PBS, and subjected to FACS analysis. According to the manufacturer, MitoSOX Red permeates live cells and is targeted to the mitochondria. The dye was rapidly oxidized by superoxide, which upon binding to nucleic acids emits red fluorescence, which was monitored by flow cytometer using excitation/emission = 488/564–606 nm. All samples were analyzed with the FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and fluorescence intensity plots were evaluated using the CellQuest acquisitions software (BD Biosciences), version 3.3. All flow cytometry analyses were performed following live cell gating from forward and side scatter profiles. Release of the cytoplasmic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase ("
https://openalex.org/W2171378773,"Neuronal protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) deficiency in mice results in enhanced leptin signaling and protection from diet-induced obesity; however, whether additional signaling pathways in the brain contribute to the metabolic effects of PTP1B deficiency remains unclear. Here, we show that the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor is a direct PTP1B substrate and implicate PTP1B in the regulation of the central brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling. PTP1B interacts with activated TrkB receptor in mouse brain and human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. PTP1B overexpression reduces TrkB phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways, whereas PTP1B inhibition augments TrkB signaling. Notably, brains of Ptpn1(-/-) mice exhibit enhanced TrkB phosphorylation, and Ptpn1(-/-) mice are hypersensitive to central BDNF-induced increase in core temperature. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that PTP1B is a novel physiological regulator of TrkB and that enhanced BDNF/TrkB signaling may contribute to the beneficial metabolic effects of PTP1B deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1976095186,"Objective To determine the physical activity level and factors influencing physical activity among pregnant urban Chinese women. Methods This prospective cross-sectional study enrolled 1056 pregnant women (18–44 years of age) in Tianjin, China. Their socio-demographic characteristics were recorded, and the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to assess their physical activity during pregnancy. The data were analyzed by multinomial logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounders. Results Median total energy expenditure of pregnant women in each of the three trimesters ranged from 18.50 to 21.90 metabolic equivalents of task (METs) h/day. They expended 1.76–1.85 MET h/day on moderate and vigorous activities and 0.11 MET h/day on exercise. Only 117 of the women (11.1%) met the international guideline for physical activity in pregnancy (≥150 min moderate intensity exercise per week). The most frequent reason given for not being more physically active was the fear of miscarriage. Higher education level (OR: 4.11, 95% CI: 1.59–10.62), habitual exercise before pregnancy (OR: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.39–3.28), and husbands who exercised regularly (OR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.33–3.67) significantly increased the odds of meeting the guideline (p<0.001). A low pre gravid body mass index (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.20–0.87) significantly decreased the odds (p<0.001). Conclusions Few urban Chinese pregnant women met the recommended physical activity guideline. They also expended little energy exercising. Future interventions should be based on the clinic environment and targeting family members as well as the subjects. All pregnant women should be targeted, not just those in high-risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W2089590751,"It is increasingly recognized that the risk for HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) transmission among people who inject drugs (PWID), such as syringe sharing, occurs in the context of relationships between (at least) two people. Evidence suggests that the risk associated with injection behavior varies with injection partner types.We utilized longitudinal dyad-level data from a study of young PWID from San Francisco (2006 to 2013) to investigate the relationship-level factors influencing high-risk injecting within HCV-serodiscordant injection partners (i.e., individuals who injected together ≥5 times in the prior month). Utilizing data from 70 HCV-serodiscordant injection partnerships, we used generalized linear models to examine relationship-level predictors (i.e., partnership composition, partnership closeness, and partnership dynamics) of: (1) receptive syringe sharing (RSS); and (2) receptive cooker use (RCU), as reported by the HCV-negative injection partner.As reported by the ""at-risk"" HCV-negative injection partner, receptive syringe sharing (RSS) and receptive cooker use (RCU) were 19% and 33% at enrollment, and 11% and 12% over all visits (total follow-up time 55 person-years) resulting in 13 new HCV-infections (incidence rate: 23.8/100 person-years). Person-level factors, injection partnership composition, and partnership dynamics were not significantly associated with either RSS or RCU. Instead, intimate injection partnerships (those who lived together and were also in a sexual relationship) were independently associated with a 5-times greater risk of both RSS and a 7-times greater risk of RCU when compared to injecting only partnerships.Our findings suggest a positive, and amplified effect of relationship factors on injecting drug risk behaviors among young PWID injection partnerships. The majority of interventions to reduce injection drug use related harms focus on individual-based education to increase drug use knowledge. Our findings support the need to expand harm reduction strategies to relationship-based messaging and interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2035311045,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a syndrome characterized by intermittent nocturnal hypoxia, sleep fragmentation, hypercapnia and respiratory effort, and it has been associated with several complications, such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. Quantitative real-time PCR has been performed in previous OSA-related studies; however, these studies were not validated using proper reference genes. We have examined the effects of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), which is an experimental model mainly of cardiovascular consequences of OSA, on reference genes, including beta-actin, beta-2-microglobulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase and eukaryotic 18S rRNA, in different areas of the brain. All stability analyses were performed using the geNorm, Normfinder and BestKeeper software programs. With exception of the 18S rRNA, all of the evaluated genes were shown to be stable following CIH exposure. However, gene stability rankings were dependent on the area of the brain that was analyzed and varied according to the software that was used. This study demonstrated that CIH affects various brain structures differently. With the exception of the 18S rRNA, all of the tested genes are suitable for use as housekeeping genes in expression analyses."

Affected patients show multiple disease phenotypes, including dilated cardiomyopathy, exercise intolerance, and hepatopathy, reflecting the central role of the enzyme in glucose metabolism. We present here the first in vitro biochemical characterization of 13 missense mutations involved in PGM1 deficiency. The biochemical phenotypes of the PGM1 mutants cluster into two groups: those with compromised catalysis and those with possible folding defects. Relative to the recombinant wild-type enzyme, certain missense mutants show greatly decreased expression of soluble protein and/or increased aggregation. In contrast, other missense variants are well behaved in solution, but show dramatic reductions in enzyme activity, with kcat/Km often <1.5% of wild-type. Modest changes in protein conformation and flexibility are also apparent in some of the catalytically impaired variants. In the case of the G291R mutant, severely compromised activity is linked to the inability of a key active site serine to be phosphorylated, a prerequisite for catalysis. Our results complement previous in vivo studies, which suggest that both protein misfolding and catalytic impairment may play a role in PGM1 deficiency.

Enzyme activity, measured from cell extracts, was reduced for all cases studied. Protein expression levels in fibroblasts, however, varied widely, with some of the mutant proteins expressing similarly to wild-type (WT) PGM1, whereas others had poor or no expression, despite mRNA levels ∼40% or more of controls (3.Tegtmeyer L.C.

Although not definitive, this pattern is consistent with early degradation of certain mutant proteins by the proteasome due to misfolding. As has been shown for a growing number of metabolic disorders (6.Gregersen N. Protein misfolding disorders: pathogenesis and intervention.J. Inherit. Metab.

Med. 2013; 31: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the available in vivo data suggest that inherited PGM1 deficiency fits a “loss-of-function” phenotype that may include protein misfolding, in addition to conventional catalytic defects. Other possibilities, such as problems with protein oligomerization or cellular trafficking are unlikely, because PGM1 is a monomeric protein found in the cytosol of the cell. Because of its fundamental importance in metabolism, the reaction catalyzed by human PGM1 has been appreciated for decades (10.Quick C.B. Fisher R.A. Harris H. A kinetic study of the isozymes determined by the three human phosphoglucomutase loci PGM1, PGM2 and PGM3.Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 42: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Its reaction entails two consecutive phosphoryl transfers (Fig. 1A). The first takes place from phosphoserine 117 of the enzyme to substrate (α-d-glucose 1-phosphate or glucose 6-phosphate), to create the bisphosphorylated sugar intermediate, α-d-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (Glc-1,6-P). The second phosphoryl transfer is from the intermediate back to the enzyme, creating product and regenerating the active state of the enzyme. The protein has 562 amino acids, and although its crystal structure is unknown, a high quality model is provided by the structure of PGM from rabbit (97% identity to human enzyme; Fig. 1B) (11.Liu Y.

The large active site cleft of the protein contains key functional regions necessary, including the catalytic phosphoserine, a loop that binds a Mg2+ ion required for activity, as well as residues involved in contacting the sugar hydroxyls and phosphate group of the substrates (12.Shackelford G.S.

Proteins were characterized for expression, solubility, conformational flexibility, and stability. We establish in this recombinant system that PGM1 missense variants segregate into two categories: those with severe catalytic defects and those that primarily appear to affect folding/solubility relative to the behavior of WT enzyme. The biochemical phenotypes are consistent with the three-dimensional structural context of the missense variants and available data from patient samples. This work provides an essential baseline for future in vivo and clinical studies of PGM1 variants associated with disease. Leuconostoc mesenteroides glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, α-d-glucose 1-phosphate, glucosamine 1-phosphate, and Glc-1,6-P were obtained from Sigma. Tritirachium album proteinase K was obtained from Fisher Scientific and 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) from Acros Organics. Contaminants of Glc-1,6-P in the α-d-glucose 1-phosphate were removed by anion exchange column chromatography (18.Ray Jr., W.J. Burgner 2nd, J.W. Post C.B. Characterization of vanadate-based transition-state-analogue complexes of phosphoglucomutase by spectral and NMR techniques.Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2770-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The gene for human PGM1 (GI:189926) was commercially synthesized (GenScript) and inserted into the pMCSG7 vector with N-terminal His6 affinity tag and tobacco etch virus protease site. PGM1 mutants were constructed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and verified by automated DNA sequencing. For expression of WT PGM1 and mutants, Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with corresponding plasmids. For small scale expression tests, E. coli cultures were grown at 37 °C in 20 ml of LB media, supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml of ampicillin, to an A600 of 0.8–1.0. Prior to induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration 0.2 mm), cultures were cooled at 4 °C for at least 30 min. Cells were induced for ∼17 h at 19 °C. At the end of induction, 1.5 ml of each cell culture was centrifuged, and pellets were resuspended in 200 µl of B-PER Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Scientific) and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal volumes of samples obtained from the soluble and insoluble fractions (10 µl each) were mixed with 10 µl of 2× SDS sample buffer, and 9 µl of this mixture loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel for analysis. Gels were scanned using Universal Hood II and ChemiDoc XRS in the Quantity One software suite (Bio-Rad). The white light imaging protocol was employed, and corrected by the subtract background function. Constant area rectangles were used to select bands and densities determined using the volume analysis function (intensity/mm2). Data were plotted as a histogram using Excel 2010 (Microsoft Office). For protein purification, 0.5–1.0-liter cell cultures were grown as described above, except that following completion of induction, cell pellets were flash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 7.8) containing 14.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.5 mm tosyllysine chloromethyl ketone, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgSO4, and 10 µg/ml of DNase. Cell lysis was performed with a French press, and the soluble fraction containing PGM1 was obtained through centrifugation. Protamine sulfate was added at 5 mg/g of cell pellet over 15 min, stirred for 30 min, and centrifuged. The supernatant was mixed with Ni2+ affinity resin (His-Select, Sigma), which had been previously equilibrated in Buffer A, and incubated for 30 min on a two-way orbital rocker. The mixture was transferred into a gravity-packed column and washed with Buffer A containing 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.8. Protein was eluted using Buffer A supplemented with 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.8. Purified proteins were dialyzed by a slow NaCl gradient into 50 mm MOPS, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and then into the final buffer (50 mm MOPS, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4). Protein samples (7 µm) in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, were analyzed at 25 °C in a 0.1-cm quartz cuvette with an Aviv 62DS spectrometer. Background subtraction was performed using buffer dialysate as the reference. Data were collected at 1-nm intervals from 200 to 250 nm and the signal averaged for 30 s. For thermal denaturation, samples were heated from 25 to 90 °C while monitoring ellipticity θ at 222 nm. As thermal denaturation of PGM1 is not reversible, the apparent Tm reports on both thermal stability and the kinetics of unfolding in this system. Protein samples at 1 mg/ml in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 1 mm MgCl2 were prepared and centrifuged prior to data collection. Data were collected on a Protein Solutions DynaPro 99 instrument at a wavelength of 8363 Å for at least 200 s (10 s each for 20 acquisitions) at 25 °C. Polydispersity of samples ranged from 0 to 39%. Samples that gave larger than expected Mr estimates (T19A, N38Y, Q41R, and D263G) were additionally filtered through a 0.2-µm filter and data were re-measured. For T19A and D263G, the expected Mr was then obtained, however, aggregation for N38Y and Q41R remained (data on Table 1 for these four samples is post-filtration). In a further effort to remove aggregates, the Q41R sample was applied to a Superdex 200 size-exclusion column in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2, and the protein in a fraction corresponding to the expected size was collected. However, subsequent analysis of this fraction by DLS (Table 1) showed that aggregation remained.TABLE 1Summary of expression and biochemical data on PGM1 deficiency mutants‡ In vivo data on protein expression levels obtained from patient fibroblasts as described in Ref. 4.Stojkovic T.

https://openalex.org/W1996927477,"High glucose-induced Akt acts as a signaling hub for mesangial cell hypertrophy and matrix expansion, which are recognized as cardinal signatures for the development of diabetic nephropathy. How mesangial cells sustain the activated state of Akt is not clearly understood. Here we show Akt-dependent phosphorylation of the transcription factor FoxO1 by high glucose. Phosphorylation-deficient, constitutively active FoxO1 inhibited the high glucose-induced phosphorylation of Akt to suppress the phosphorylation/inactivation of PRAS40 and mTORC1 activity. In contrast, dominant negative FoxO1 increased the phosphorylation of Akt, resulting in increased mTORC1 activity similar to high glucose treatment. Notably, FoxO1 regulates high glucose-induced protein synthesis, hypertrophy, and expression of fibronectin and PAI-1. High glucose paves the way for complications of diabetic nephropathy through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We considered whether the FoxO1 target antioxidant enzyme catalase contributes to sustained activation of Akt. High glucose-inactivated FoxO1 decreases the expression of catalase to increase the production of ROS. Moreover, we show that catalase blocks high glucose-stimulated Akt phosphorylation to attenuate the inactivation of FoxO1 and PRAS40, resulting in the inhibition of mTORC1 and mesangial cell hypertrophy and fibronectin and PAI-1 expression. Finally, using kidney cortices from type 1 diabetic OVE26 mice, we show that increased FoxO1 phosphorylation is associated with decreased catalase expression and increased fibronectin and PAI-1 expression. Together, our results provide the first evidence for the presence of a positive feedback loop for the sustained activation of Akt involving inactivated FoxO1 and a decrease in catalase expression, leading to increased ROS and mesangial cell hypertrophy and matrix protein expression."
https://openalex.org/W2025809920,"The alginate-assimilating bacterium, Sphingomonas sp. strain A1, degrades the polysaccharides to monosaccharides through four alginate lyase reactions. The resultant monosaccharide, which is nonenzymatically converted to 4-deoxy-l-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronate (DEH), is further metabolized to 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-gluconate by NADPH-dependent reductase A1-R in the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. A1-R-deficient cells produced another DEH reductase, designated A1-R′, with a preference for NADH. Here, we show the identification of a novel NADH-dependent DEH reductase A1-R′ in strain A1, structural determination of A1-R′ by x-ray crystallography, and structure-based conversion of a coenzyme requirement in SDR enzymes, A1-R and A1-R′. A1-R′ was purified from strain A1 cells and enzymatically characterized. Except for the coenzyme requirement, there was no significant difference in enzyme characteristics between A1-R and A1-R′. Crystal structures of A1-R′ and A1-R′·NAD+ complex were determined at 1.8 and 2.7 Å resolutions, respectively. Because of a 64% sequence identity, overall structures of A1-R′ and A1-R were similar, although a difference in the coenzyme-binding site (particularly the nucleoside ribose 2′ region) was observed. Distinct from A1-R, A1-R′ included a negatively charged, shallower binding site. These differences were caused by amino acid residues on the two loops around the site. The A1-R′ mutant with the two A1-R-typed loops maintained potent enzyme activity with specificity for NADPH rather than NADH, demonstrating that the two loops determine the coenzyme requirement, and loop exchange is a promising method for conversion of coenzyme requirement in the SDR family. The alginate-assimilating bacterium, Sphingomonas sp. strain A1, degrades the polysaccharides to monosaccharides through four alginate lyase reactions.

A1-R′ was purified from strain A1 cells and enzymatically characterized. Except for the coenzyme requirement, there was no significant difference in enzyme characteristics between A1-R and A1-R′. Crystal structures of A1-R′ and A1-R′·NAD+ complex were determined at 1.8 and 2.7 Å resolutions, respectively. Because of a 64% sequence identity, overall structures of A1-R′ and A1-R were similar, although a difference in the coenzyme-binding site (particularly the nucleoside ribose 2′ region) was observed. Distinct from A1-R, A1-R′ included a negatively charged, shallower binding site. These differences were caused by amino acid residues on the two loops around the site. The A1-R′ mutant with the two A1-R-typed loops maintained potent enzyme activity with specificity for NADPH rather than NADH, demonstrating that the two loops determine the coenzyme requirement, and loop exchange is a promising method for conversion of coenzyme requirement in the SDR family."
https://openalex.org/W2071278507,"The activity of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is dysregulated in a number of hematological and solid malignancies. Development of pharmacological STAT3 Src homology 2 (SH2) domain interaction inhibitors holds great promise for cancer therapy, and a novel class of salicylic acid-based STAT3 dimerization inhibitors that includes orally bioavailable drug candidates has been recently developed. The compounds SF-1-066 and BP-1-102 are predicted to bind to the STAT3 SH2 domain. However, given the highly unstructured and dynamic nature of the SH2 domain, experimental confirmation of this prediction was elusive. We have interrogated the protein-ligand interaction of STAT3 with these small molecule inhibitors by means of time-resolved electrospray ionization hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Analysis of site-specific evolution of deuterium uptake induced by the complexation of STAT3 with SF-1-066 or BP-1-102 under physiological conditions enabled the mapping of the in silico predicted inhibitor binding site to the STAT3 SH2 domain. The binding of both inhibitors to the SH2 domain resulted in significant local decreases in dynamics, consistent with solvent exclusion at the inhibitor binding site and increased rigidity of the inhibitor-complexed SH2 domain. Interestingly, inhibitor binding induced hot spots of allosteric perturbations outside of the SH2 domain, manifesting mainly as increased deuterium uptake, in regions of STAT3 important for DNA binding and nuclear localization."
https://openalex.org/W2005149880,"This publication provides the first comprehensive DNA barcode data set for the Neuropterida of Central Europe, including 80 of the 102 species (78%) recorded from Bavaria (Germany) and three other species from nearby regions (Austria, France and the UK). Although the 286 specimens analyzed had a heterogeneous conservation history (60% dried; 30% in 80% EtOH; 10% fresh specimens in 95% EtOH), 237 (83%) generated a DNA barcode. Eleven species (13%) shared a BIN, but three of these taxa could be discriminated through barcodes. Four pairs of closely allied species shared barcodes including Chrysoperla pallida Henry et al., 2002 and C. lucasina Lacroix, 1912; Wesmaelius concinnus (Stephens, 1836) and W. quadrifasciatus (Reuter, 1894); Hemerobius handschini Tjeder, 1957 and H. nitidulus Fabricius, 1777; and H. atrifrons McLachlan, 1868 and H. contumax Tjeder, 1932. Further studies are needed to test the possible synonymy of these species pairs or to determine if other genetic markers permit their discrimination. Our data highlight five cases of potential cryptic diversity within Bavarian Neuropterida: Nineta flava (Scopoli, 1763), Sympherobius pygmaeus (Rambur, 1842), Sisyra nigra (Retzius, 1783), Semidalis aleyrodiformis (Stephens, 1836) and Coniopteryx pygmaea Enderlein, 1906 are each split into two or three BINs. The present DNA barcode library not only allows the identification of adult and larval stages, but also provides valuable information for alpha-taxonomy, and for ecological and evolutionary research."
https://openalex.org/W1967219950,"The function of neutrophil protease 3 (PR3) is poorly understood despite of its role in autoimmune vasculitides and its possible involvement in cell apoptosis. This makes it different from its structural homologue neutrophil elastase (HNE). Endogenous inhibitors of human neutrophil serine proteases preferentially inhibit HNE and to a lesser extent, PR3. We constructed a single-residue mutant PR3 (I217R) to investigate the S4 subsite preferences of PR3 and HNE and used the best peptide substrate sequences to develop selective phosphonate inhibitors with the structure Ac-peptidylP(O-C6H4-4-Cl)2. The combination of a prolyl residue at P4 and an aspartyl residue at P2 was totally selective for PR3. We then synthesized N-terminally biotinylated peptidyl phosphonates to identify the PR3 in complex biological samples. These inhibitors resisted proteolytic degradation and rapidly inactivated PR3 in biological fluids such as inflammatory lung secretions and the urine of patients with bladder cancer. One of these inhibitors revealed intracellular PR3 in permeabilized neutrophils and on the surface of activated cells. They hardly inhibited PR3 bound to the surface of stimulated neutrophils despite their low molecular mass, suggesting that the conformation and reactivity of membrane-bound PR3 is altered. This finding is relevant for autoantibody binding and the subsequent activation of neutrophils in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Wegener disease).

These are the first inhibitors that can be used as probes to monitor, detect, and control PR3 activity in a variety of inflammatory diseases. There are ∼100 active serine proteases with a trypsin/chymotrypsin-like fold that are encoded by distinct human genes, but the physiological substrates and in vivo function of most of them are still poorly characterized. Although they are potential therapeutic targets in a large number of diseases, only a few inhibitors, primarily those that interfere with the coagulation cascade (factor Xa, thrombin inhibitors), have been approved for clinical use (for review see Ref. 1.Turk B.

(EC 3.4.21.76) is a neutrophilic serine protease that shares many structural and functional characteristics with human neutrophil elastase (HNE) (EC 3.4.21.37) (2.Korkmaz B. Moreau T. Gauthier F.

Large amounts of both proteases are stored intracellularly in so-called primary granules and contribute to the breakdown of extracellular matrix components in infectious and inflammatory diseases, especially those of the lung (4.Owen C.A. Roles for proteinases in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Int. J. Chron. Obstruct. Pulmon. Dis. 2008; 3: 253-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PR3 has also been identified as the principal autoantigen in one clinical subtype of systemic autoimmune vasculitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (formerly Wegener disease) (5.Jenne D.E. Tschopp J. Ludemann J. Utecht B. Gross W.L. Wegener's autoantigen decoded.Nature. 1990; 346: 520Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 6.Kallenberg C.G.

Current understanding of the pathogenesis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's).Expert Rev. Clin. Immunol. 2013; 9: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The PR3 in activated neutrophils with destabilized lysosomal membranes can induce apoptosis and hence accelerate their death in inflamed tissues (8.Gabillet J. Millet A. Pederzoli-Ribeil M. Tacnet-Delorme P. Guillevin L. Mouthon L. Frachet P. Witko-Sarsat V. Proteinase 3, the autoantigen in granulomatosis with polyangiitis, associates with calreticulin on apoptotic neutrophils, impairs macrophage phagocytosis, and promotes inflammation.J. Immunol. 2012; 189: 2574-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Unlike HNE, PR3 is also present in highly mobile secretory vesicles and is translocated to the outer plasma membrane under certain conditions of priming (9.Witko-Sarsat V. Cramer E.M. Hieblot C. Guichard J. Nusbaum P. Lopez S. Lesavre P. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Presence of proteinase 3 in secretory vesicles: evidence of a novel, highly mobilizable intracellular pool distinct from azurophil granules.Blood. 1999; 94: 2487-2496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, very small amounts of PR3 are constitutively exposed on the outer surface of circulating neutrophils (10.Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Bessou G. Lesavre P. Lopez S. Witko-Sarsat V. Bimodal distribution of proteinase 3 (PR3) surface expression reflects a constitutive heterogeneity in the polymorphonuclear neutrophil pool.FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This genetically determined constitutive distribution is a unique feature of human PR3 that may explain its function of autoantibody target in vasculitides (11.Schreiber A. Busjahn A. Luft F.C. Kettritz R. Membrane expression of proteinase 3 is genetically determined.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring inhibitors of PR3 in the extracellular compartment and blood plasma target HNE preferentially, which makes investigating and understanding its biological function particularly complex (12.Korkmaz B.

Peptidyldiphenyl phosphonate inhibitors are irreversible transition state inhibitors that form a tetrahedral adduct with the serine 195 residue (chymotrypsin numbering) of the catalytic triad (13.Sieńczyk M. Oleksyszyn J. Irreversible inhibition of serine proteases: design and in vivo activity of diaryl α-aminophosphonate derivatives.Curr. Med.

Des. 2013; 19: 1154-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They selectively inhibit serine proteases, are chemically stable in several buffers and in the plasma under acidic and neutral conditions, and are effective at low concentrations (15.Boduszek B. Brown A.D. Powers J.C. α-Aminoalkylphosphonate di(chlorophenyl) esters as inhibitors of serine proteases.J. Enzyme Inhib. 1994; 8: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). They can also be used as activity-based probes for labeling serine proteases at the cell surface (16.Brown C.M. Ray M. Eroy-Reveles A.A. Egea P. Tajon C. Craik C.S. Peptide length and leaving-group sterics influence potency of peptide phosphonate protease inhibitors.Chem.

Immunol. 1994; 153: 5016-5025PubMed Google Scholar). These inhibitors, therefore, seem to be most appropriate for dissecting the intracellular and extracellular biological roles of enzymatically active PR3 whether free or membrane-bound. We and others have shown that the substrate binding site of PR3 extends on both side of the catalytic site and that the Asp residues at P2 and P2′ (nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (18.Schechter I. Berger A. On the size of the active site in proteases. I. Papain.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4759) Google Scholar)) are essential to obtain selectivity toward PR3 (19.Jégot G. Derache C. Castella S. Lahouassa H. Pitois E. Jourdan M.L.

Our goal was to produce an inhibitor that was selective for PR3 and had a sequence that binds only to the nonprime subsites of the protease. Having an Asp at P2 is not sufficient to ensure a selective interaction with PR3; we therefore used the difference between the structures of the S4 subsites of PR3 and HNE to determine whether the cooperation between the S4 and the S2 subsites could provide inhibitors selective for PR3. We designed a tetrapeptide to be the peptide moiety of a PR3-selective, irreversible, easy-to-handle chlorodiphenyl phosphonate inhibitor. This compound has proved to be a successful probe for detecting PR3 activity in biological samples or for visualizing and monitoring PR3 both inside cells and at the cell surface. The proI217R mutant was produced in Sf9 insect cells using the pMT/BiP/proPR3/His vector as a matrix and two complementary primers (5′-ccaaggaatagactccttcgtgaggtggggatgtgcc-3′ and 5′-ggcacatccccacctcacgaaggagtctattccttgg-3′). The mutation was introduced using the QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and its presence was checked by sequencing (MWG Biotech). We established a stable cell line using antibiotic selection, and the cells were cultured in Schneider medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. We used CuSO4 to induce synthesis of the protein, which was purified by affinity chromatography on a chelating Sepharose fast flow resin column (Amersham Biosciences), eluted with a gradient of imidazole. The proI217R was activated as described previously for recombinant wtPR3 and the K99L (19.Jégot G. Derache C. Castella S. Lahouassa H. Pitois E. Jourdan M.L. Remold-O'Donnell E. Kellenberger C. Gauthier F. Korkmaz B.

The first step in the synthesis of the phosphonic analog of alanine was the preparation of tri(4-chlorophenyl)phosphite from 4-chlorophenol and phosphorus trichloride (21.Sieńczyk M. Oleksyszyn J. Inhibition of trypsin and urokinase by Cbz-amino(4-guanidinophenyl)methanephosphonate aromatic ester derivatives: the influence of the ester group on their biological activity.Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2006; 16: 2886-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphorus trichloride (10 mmol) was added to 4-chlorophenol (30 mmol) dissolved in acetonitrile (50 ml), and the mixture was refluxed for 6 h. The volatile elements were removed in a vacuum, and the resulting crude phosphite, a yellow oil, was used directly in an amidoalkylation reaction. It was mixed with benzyl carbamate (12 mmol) and acetaldehyde (12 mmol) and refluxed in acetic acid for 3 h (Oleksyszyn and Powers (22.Oleksyszyn J. Powers J.C. Irreversible inhibition of serine proteases by peptidyl derivatives of α-aminoalkylphosphonate diphenyl esters.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)). The resulting carboxybenzyl-AlaP(O-C6H4-4-Cl)2 was a white solid, 56%; yield, purity after 56%; high resolution mass spectrometry calculated for (C22H20Cl2NO5P)H+, 480.0534; found, 480.0533; 1H NMR (CDCl3, ppm), δ 7.43-6.97 (m, 14H), 5.22-5.08 (m, 2H), 4.74-4.37 (m, 1H), 1.56 (dd, J = 18.2, 7.4 Hz, 3H); 31P NMR (CDCl3, ppm): δ 19.56 (s). The carboxybenzyl protecting group was then removed by incubation with 33% hydrobromic acid in acetic acid (2 h), and the volatile components were removed under reduced pressure. The product was crystallized from methanol/diethyl ether to give HBr*H2N-AlaP(OPh)2 as a white solid, 97%; high resolution mass spectrometry calculated for (C14H14Cl2NO3P)H+, 346.0167; found, 346.0172; 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, ppm): δ 8.85 (s, 3H), 7.57-7.44 (m, 4H), 7.36-7.16 (m, 4H), 4.45-4.24 (m, 1H), 1.55 (dd, J = 18.3, 7.2 Hz, 3H); 31P NMR (CDCl3, ppm): δ 16.49 (s). The peptides were synthesized manually by the solid-phase method using Fmoc (fluoromethyloxycarbonyl chloride) chemistry. The following amino acid derivatives were used: Fmoc-Pro, Fmoc-Tyr(tBu), Fmoc-Asp(OtBu). The protected derivative of the C-terminal amino acid residue, Fmoc-Asp(OtBu), was attached to the 2-chlorotritylchloride resin (substitution of Cl− 1.46 meq/g) (Calbiochem) in the presence of an equimolar amount of diisopropylethylamine (based on the amino acid) under anhydrous conditions in dichloromethylene solution. Peptide chains were elongated in consecutive cycles of deprotection and coupling. They were deprotected with 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide (DMF)/n-methylpyrrolidone (1:1, v/v) plus 1% Triton X-100, whereas chain elongation used standard differential interference contrast/hydroxybenzotriazole chemistry; 3 eq of protected amino acid derivatives were used. The same method was used to couple biotin and fluorescent compounds (used as N-protected Fmoc derivatives). A 10-fold molar excess of N-acetylimidazole in DMF was used for N-terminal acetyl derivates. Bt-[PEG]66-Pro-Tyr-Asp-AlaP(O-C6H4-4-Cl)2 was synthesized by coupling the α-(9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl)amino-ω-carboxyl poly(ethylene glycol) Fmoc-polyethylene glycol-66 (PEG66; Mr 3000 Da) to the amino group of Pro. The N-terminal biotin group was introduced stirring a 5-fold molar (1.8 mmol) excess of biotin and 1,3-diisopropylcarbidiimide in 2 ml of anhydrous DMSO for 6 h at 30 °C. The synthesized peptides were cleaved from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid/hexane/acetic acid (1:6:1, v/v/v). Fully protected peptides were dissolved in DMF, and their carboxyl groups were activated with 1,3-diisopropylcarbidiimide to which were added HBr×H2N-AlaP(OPh)2 in DMF and diisopropylethylamine. The mixture was stirred for 6 h, and the DMF was evaporated off under reduced pressure. The resulting compound was suspended in trifluoroacetic acid/phenol/triisopropylsilane/H2O (88:5:2:5, v/v/v/v) for 2 h to remove side-chain protecting groups. The crude peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Beckman Gold System (Beckman) with an RP Kromasil-100, C8, 5 µm column (8 × 250 mm) (Knauer, Berlin, Germany). The solvent systems were 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (A) and 80% acetonitrile in A (B). Either isocratic conditions or a linear gradient were applied (flow rate 3.0 ml/min, monitored at 226 nm). The purity of the synthesized peptides was checked on an RP Kromasil 100, C8, 5 µm column (4.6 × 250 mm) (Knauer). The peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of the above solvent system (10–90% B) for 30 min and a flow rate 1 ml/min, monitored at 226 nm. Mass spectrometric analysis was done on a MALDI MS (a Biflex III MALDI-TOF spectrometer, Bruker Daltonics, Ettlingen, Germany) using a CCA matrix. Free wtPR3, I217R, K99L, and HNE (Biocentrum, Krakow, Poland) were titrated with α-1-proteinase inhibitor (23.Korkmaz B. Attucci S. Hazouard E. Ferrandiere M. Jourdan M.L. Brillard-Bourdet M.

The specificity constants kcat/Km for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) substrates and para-nitroanilide (pNA) substrates synthesized by Genecust (Dudelange Luxembourg) were determined under first-order conditions (23.Korkmaz B.

We measured the inactivation of proteases by substrate analog inhibitors in the presence of the substrate by competition for the enzyme binding site by the method of Tian and Tsou (24.Tian W.X. Tsou C.L. Determination of the rate constant of enzyme modification by measuring the substrate reaction in the presence of the modifier.Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Product formation in the presence of an irreversible inhibitor approaches an asymptote in this system, as described by: log([P∞] − [P]) = log[P∞] − 0.43A[Y]t, where [P∞] is the concentration of product formed at time approaching infinity, [P] is the concentration of product at time t, [Y] is the inhibitor concentration, and A is the apparent inhibition rate constant in the presence of the substrate. A is given by: A = k+o/(1 + K−1[S]), where k+o is the rate constant for association of the inhibitor with the enzyme, K−1 is the inverted Michaelis constant, and [S] is the substrate concentration. The apparent inhibition rate constant A is the slope of a plot of log([P∞] − [P]) against t, to give the second-order rate constant of inhibition k+o. The rates of inhibition of PR3 and HNE were measured in 50 mm HEPES, 0.75 m NaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 (pH = 7.4). HPLC-purified fragments of FRET substrates were diluted 20-fold in acetonitrile:water:formic acid (45:54.8:0.2) and analyzed by direct infusion in a 4-GHz MaXis ultra high resolution quadrupole-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with an electrospray ion source. Spectra were acquired in positive ion MS mode over a 300–3000 m/z range with a nebulizer gas pressure of 0.3 bars. The drying gas flow was 4 liter/min, and the temperature was 180 °C. The acquisition rate was 1 Hz corresponding to spectra summations of 5494. External calibration was performed with the ESI-L Low Concentration Tuning Mix (Agilent Technologies). Electrospray ionization-high resolution mass spectrometry spectra were processed using DataAnalysis 3.1 software (Bruker Daltonics), and cleavage peptides were assigned using Paws Version 8.5.0.3 (ProteoMetrics, New York, NY). The volumes of cystic fibrosis (CF) sputa and 10× concentrated urines from patients with bladder cancer were adjusted to give a final PR3 concentration of 10–100 nm (4–40 ng). These samples were incubated with compound 5 (150 nm final) for 20 min at 37 °C in 50 mm HEPES, 0.75 m NaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 (pH 7.4). The reaction was stopped by adding 1 volume of 2× SDS reducing buffer and heating at 90 °C for 5 min. The components of the mixture were separated by SDS-PAGE, 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions (4–40 ng of protein per lane). They were transferred to a nitrocellulose (Hybond)-ECL (Enhanced Chemiluminescence) membrane at 4 °C. Free sites on the membrane were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) or with 0.1% Tween in PBS for 90 min at room temperature (RT). Membranes were then given two quick washes with PBS, Tween 0.1% and incubated for 2 h at RT with extravidin horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Sigma) (diluted 1/4000 in 3% BSA in PBS, Tween 0.1%). The extravidin-HRP-treated membrane was washed (3 × 10 min) with PBS, Tween 1% and then incubated with HRP substrate for 1 min. Reactive bands were identified by chemiluminescence (ECL kit). Free sites on the membranes were blocked by incubation with 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS, 0.1% Tween for 90 min at RT. They were washed twice with PBS, Tween 0.1% and incubated overnight with a rabbit primary anti-PR3 antibody (1:700) followed by a goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:7000). These membranes were then washed and processed as above. The wells of Nunc Maxisorp plates were coated with purified wtPR3 and HNE by incubating them with enzyme (0.05 µm in 100 µl PBS) at 37 °C for 1 h. The plates were washed 4 times with 200 µl of PBS, Tween 0.1%. Bt-[PEG]66-PYDAP(O-C6H4-4-Cl)2 (compound 9) (2.5 µm final) in 100 µl of HEPES buffer was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 180 min. The wells were washed 4 times with 200 µl of PBS, Tween 0.1% and then saturated by adding 2% BSA in PBS (200 µl/well) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed again (4 × 200 µl PBS, Tween 0.1%) and incubated with extravidin-HRP (1/2000) or streptavidin-HRP (1/15000) in 0.1% Tween, 2% BSA in PBS for 2 h at RT. The plates were washed again and incubated with the chromogenic substrate ortho-phenylenediamine (Sigma). The reaction was stopped by adding H2SO4 (2 m), and the absorbance at 492 nm was measured. Neutrophils were isolated from heparinized peripheral blood samples from healthy volunteers who gave their informed consent (25.Korkmaz B. Attucci S. Juliano M.A. Kalupov T. Jourdan M.L. Juliano L.

Protoc. 2008; 3: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Purified quiescent neutrophils were suspended in PBS and fixed with 3.7% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (20 min at RT). They were washed twice with PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 (10 min at RT). Permeabilized cells were washed twice in PBS and then incubated for 20 min at RT with 10 µm Bt-[PEG]66-PYDAP(O-C6H4-4-Cl)2 (compound 9). These cells were then washed twice in PBS to remove unbound inhibitors, and free binding sites were blocked by incubation with 10% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 1 h. They were then incubated with Alexa Fluor® 488 streptavidin (Invitrogen, diluted 1/1000 in 3% (w/v) PBS) for 1 h at RT. Flow cytometry or confocal microscopy were performed immediately after this last wash. For flow cytometry, cells were suspended in 200 µl of PBS and examined in a flow cytometer equipped with a 488-nm argon laser. For microscopy, 200 µl of suspended cells were centrifuged (500 g, 5 min) on a glass slide, treated with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), and examined under a Zeiss Axio Imager fluorescence microscope. The charge distribution of the solvent-accessible surfaces in the vicinity of the substrate binding sites of PR3 and HNE differ significantly (20.Korkmaz B. Hajjar E. Kalupov T. Reuter N.

The crystal structure of PR3, a neutrophil serine proteinase antigen of Wegener's granulomatosis antibodies.J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The S2 pocket is smaller and more hydrophilic in PR3 than in HNE mainly because the Leu at position 99 is replaced by a Lys in the vicinity of both the S2 and S4 pockets (26.Fujinaga M. Chernaia M.M. Halenbeck R. Koths K. James M.N. The crystal structure of PR3, a neutrophil serine proteinase antigen of Wegener's granulomatosis antibodies.J. Mol.

We investigated the importance of the S4 subsite in PR3 by producing a new PR3 variant with an Arg at position 217 (I217R) (Fig. 1A). The activities of the wild type and the two PR3 mutants (I217R, K99L (19.Jégot G. Derache C. Castella S. Lahouassa H. Pitois E. Jourdan M.L. Remold-O'Donnell E. Kellenberger C. Gauthier F. Korkmaz B.

Derache C. Castella S. Lahouassa H. Pitois E. Jourdan M.L. Remold-O'Donnell E. Kellenberger C. Gauthier F. Korkmaz B.

The wtPR3, the PR3 mutants, and HNE all cleaved substrate 1 at the V-V bond with similar specificity constants (Table 1). Although replacing P4 Pro by a positively charged residue in substrate 1 (substrate 2) had no significant influence on the rate of hydrolysis, an Asp at P4 (substrate 3) strongly impaired cleavage by wtPR3 and K99L but not by I217R, which cleaved at the V-V bond with a significantly larger kcat/Km (Table 1 and Fig. 1, A and B). Although replacing the Ala at P2 by Asp in substrate 1 (substrate 4) resulted in a large increase in the specificity constant with wtPR3 (19.Jégot G. Derache C. Castella S. Lahouassa H. Pitois E. Jourdan M.L. Remold-O'Donnell E. Kellenberger C. Gauthier F. Korkmaz B.

These observations strongly suggest that the S4 pocket greatly influences the substrate specificity of PR3. This was also demonstrated by replacing the Pro at P4 by Asp and the Ala at P2 by Asp. The resulting substrate (substrate 5) was not hydrolyzed by wtPR3 but was cleaved by I217R. As expected K99L did not cleave substrates with an Asp at either P2 or P4 (Table 1). HNE still cleaved substrate 5, but cleavage was one bond downstream from the V-V bond (Fig. 1, A and B), which is not a drawback when constructing inhibitors with no prime residues. We deduced from these data that the sequence Asp-X-Asp-Ala (DXDA) should be optimal for discriminating between PR3 and HNE in terms of selectivity, but that PR3 would have a greater affinity for Pro-X-Asp-Ala (PXDA).TABLE 1Kinetics of synthetic substrate cleavage by proteinase 3 and elastaseTABLE 1Kinetics of synthetic substrate cleavage by proteinase 3 and elastase* Values are the means ± S.D. of three experiments.# Values were from Jégot et al., (19.Jégot G.

https://openalex.org/W2009076078,"The urate transporter, GLUT9, is responsible for the basolateral transport of urate in the proximal tubule of human kidneys and in the placenta, playing a central role in uric acid homeostasis. GLUT9 shares the least homology with other members of the glucose transporter family, especially with the glucose transporting members GLUT1-4 and is the only member of the GLUT family to transport urate. The recently published high-resolution structure of XylE, a bacterial D-xylose transporting homologue, yields new insights into the structural foundation of this GLUT family of proteins. While this represents a huge milestone, it is unclear if human GLUT9 can benefit from this advancement through subsequent structural based targeting and mutagenesis. Little progress has been made toward understanding the mechanism of GLUT9 since its discovery in 2000. Before work can begin on resolving the mechanisms of urate transport we must determine methods to express, purify and analyze hGLUT9 using a model system adept in expressing human membrane proteins. Here, we describe the surface expression, purification and isolation of monomeric protein, and functional analysis of recombinant hGLUT9 using the Xenopus laevis oocyte system. In addition, we generated a new homology-based high-resolution model of hGLUT9 from the XylE crystal structure and utilized our purified protein to generate a low-resolution single particle reconstruction. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the functional protein extracted from the Xenopus system fits well with the homology-based model allowing us to generate the predicted urate-binding pocket and pave a path for subsequent mutagenesis and structure-function studies."
https://openalex.org/W1979661372,"Gluconeogenesis is an active pathway in Leishmania amastigotes and is essential for their survival within the mammalian cells. However, our knowledge about this pathway in trypanosomatids is very limited. We investigated the role of glycerol kinase (GK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) in gluconeogenesis by generating the respective Leishmania mexicana Δgk, Δpepck, and Δppdk null mutants. Our results demonstrated that indeed GK, PEPCK, and PPDK are key players in the gluconeogenesis pathway in Leishmania, although stage-specific differences in their contribution to this pathway were found. GK participates in the entry of glycerol in promastigotes and amastigotes; PEPCK participates in the entry of aspartate in promastigotes, and PPDK is involved in the entry of alanine in amastigotes. Furthermore, the majority of alanine enters into the pathway via decarboxylation of pyruvate in promastigotes, whereas pathway redundancy is suggested for the entry of aspartate in amastigotes. Interestingly, we also found that l-lactate, an abundant glucogenic precursor in mammals, was used by Leishmania amastigotes to synthesize mannogen, entering the pathway through PPDK. On the basis of these new results, we propose a revision in the current model of gluconeogenesis in Leishmania, emphasizing the differences between amastigotes and promastigotes.

This work underlines the importance of studying the trypanosomatid intracellular life cycle stages to gain a better understanding of the pathologies caused in humans. Trypanosomatids of the genera Trypanosoma and Leishmania are the causative agents of serious diseases in humans. In particular, Leishmania species are responsible for various manifestations of leishmaniasis in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world (1Desjeux P. Leishmaniasis: current situation and new perspectives.Comp. Immunol. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 2004; 27: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar). During their life cycle, Leishmania parasites develop into extracellular flagellated promastigotes within the alimentary tract of the sand fly vector and into intracellular amastigotes within the acidified macrophage phagolysosome of the mammalian host (2Murray H.W. Berman J.D. Davies C.R. Saravia N.G. Advances in leishmaniasis.Lancet. 2005; 366: 1561-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Glucose and other hexoses are critical cellular nutrients. Leishmania parasites take up and metabolize glucose and other sugars throughout their life cycle (3Burchmore R.J. Hart D.T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29118-29126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and they are able to synthesize sugar de novo, via gluconeogenesis, under sugar starvation (6Simon M.W.

In contrast, Leishmania amastigotes actively carry out gluconeogenesis even in the presence of external sugar (7Rodríguez-Contreras D. Landfear S.M. Metabolic changes in glucose transporter-deficient Leishmania mexicana and parasite virulence.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20068-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), a condition in which gluconeogenesis is down-regulated in mammalian cells (8Nelson D.L. Cox N.N. Principles of Biochemistry. 4th Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York2005: 551-559Google Scholar), suggesting that amastigotes are adapted to sugar-limiting intracellular environments. Gluconeogenesis is important for amastigote survival (9Naderer T. Ellis M.A. Sernee M.F. De Souza D.P. Curtis J. Handman E. McConville M.J.

Improving our understanding of Leishmania gluconeogenesis could aid in the design of better treatments against amastigotes, which are responsible for the pathologies observed in humans. It has been previously demonstrated that Leishmania mexicana is able to use glycerol, aspartate, and alanine to synthesize their storage carbohydrate mannogen (7Rodríguez-Contreras D. Landfear S.M.

It was proposed that glycerol enters the gluconeogenesis pathway through GK, 2The abbreviations used are: GKglycerol kinasePEPCKphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinasePPDKpyruvate phosphate dikinasePEPphosphoenolpyruvateFBPasefructose 1,6-bisphosphatasePYKpyruvate kinaseLPGlipophosphoglycanMEmalic enzymeBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-dioliFBSheat-inactivated FBS. whereas aspartate and alanine enter through PEPCK and PPDK, respectively (7Rodríguez-Contreras D.

GK catalyzes the conversion of glycerol into glycerol 3-phosphate; PEPCK catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate into phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and PPDK catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate into PEP (8Nelson D.L. Cox N.N. Principles of Biochemistry. 4th Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York2005: 551-559Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, PPDK is absent, and alanine enters into the pathway by the combined action of pyruvate carboxylase and PEPCK (supplemental Fig. S1). However, the lack of a bona fide pyruvate carboxylase gene in the trypanosomatid genome databases raises the question about the entry of alanine into the pathway in these parasites. GK, PPDK, and PEPCK have been described in Leishmania or related parasites (11Bringaud F. Baltz D. Baltz T.

The objective of this work was to study the contribution of these enzymes to the gluconeogenesis pathway in Leishmania parasites. We demonstrated that GK, PEPCK, and PPDK allow the entry of glycerol, aspartate, and alanine into the pathway, respectively; however, their participations in the entry of such substrates differed between the parasite life cycle stages. Our results also supported previous reports suggesting the importance of PEPCK in the carbohydrate metabolism of the promastigotes (14Saunders E.C. Ng W.W. Chambers J.M. Ng M. Naderer T. Krömer J.O.

Finally, we describe the use of another glucogenic precursor abundant in mammals, l-lactate, that could be utilized for gluconeogenesis by L. mexicana amastigotes. The L. mexicana (strain MNYZ/BZ/62/M379) parasites were generously donated by Dr. Scott Landfear (Oregon Health and Science University). Promastigotes and axenic amastigotes of L. mexicana wild type, Δgk, Δppdk, and Δpepck null mutants and add-back cell lines were cultured as described previously (18Rodriguez-Contreras D. Feng X. Keeney K.M. Bouwer H.G. Landfear S.M. Phenotypic characterization of a glucose transporter null mutant in Leishmania mexicana.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2007; 153: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Promastigotes were cultured at 26 °C in glucose-free RPMI 1640 medium, pH 7.4, containing 10% iFBS, with either 10 mm glucose or no sugar (see below). Continuous cultures were maintained by dilution of parasites in logarithmic phase of growth twice a week, and new promastigote cultures were initiated frequently from frozen stocks. Axenic (culture form) amastigotes were cultivated at 32.5 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium modified for Leishmania (DME-L), pH 5.5, supplemented with 30 mm MES instead of HEPES, 20% iFBS, and 10 mm glucose (19Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. High efficiency plating method for Leishmania promastigotes in semidefined or completely-defined medium.J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and maintained by weekly dilutions. The Δgk[GK] and Δppdk[PPDK] cell lines were grown with 100 μg/ml G418 drug and Δpepck[PEPCK] with 50 μg/ml phleomycin, respectively. Transfections employed to generate null mutants and episomally complemented cell lines were performed as reported (20Robinson K.A. Beverley S.M. Improvements in transfection efficiency and tests of RNA interference (RNAi) approaches in the protozoan parasite Leishmania.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 128: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In glucose-limited conditions, glucose-free RPMI 1640 medium was only supplemented with 10% iFBS (glucose concentration of this medium was ∼0.5 mm), and for glucose-repleted conditions, 1.8 g/liter glucose (10 mm) was added to this medium (its glucose concentration was ∼10.5 mm). Growth curves were determined by fixing parasites in 2% formaldehyde followed by counting triplicate samples on a hemocytometer grid. Genomic DNA samples were prepared using DNAzol® reagent (Invitrogen). PCR products were gel-purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, CA) and, if intended, ligated into pCR 2.1-TOPO vectors (Invitrogen) prior to their cloning in the Leishmania expression vectors. Plasmid DNA was purified using the Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA purification system (Promega, WI). All plasmids generated were sequenced at the Core Facility at the Oregon Health and Science University to verify accuracy. Southern blots were performed as described previously (21Feng X.

Microbiol. 2013; 87: 412-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), using 10 μg of genomic DNA per sample. Probes were obtained by PCR amplification from genomic DNA using the oligonucleotides described in supplemental Table S1 and were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) using the Ready-to Go DNA labeling beads kit (GE Healthcare) and purified using the ProbeQuantTM G-50 micro-columns (GE Healthcare). A 0.68-kb region of the LmxPPDK ORF, a 0.77-kb fragment of the LmxGK ORF, a 1.2-kb fragment of the LmxPEPCK ORF, and a 0.68-kb fragment of the LmxGT2 ORF (used as control of loading) were used as probes. In L. mexicana, GK and PPDK are encoded by single copy genes (LmxM34.3080 and LmxM11.1000, respectively), whereas PEPCK is encoded by three repeated genes (LmxM27.1810, LmxM27.1807, and LmxM27.1805) organized in tandem. For generation of Δgk, Δppdk, and Δpepck null mutants, recombinant homologous gene replacement constructs were prepared containing the following drug selectable markers: blasticidin and nourseothricin resistances for GK; hygromycin B and phleomycin resistances for PPDK; and puromycin and hygromycin B resistances for PEPCK. The flanking regions used to target each gene replacement were as follows: Δgk, upstream targeting sequence, 0.47 kb extending 110 bp into the ORF, and downstream targeting sequence, 0.79 kb beginning 132 bp before the stop codon; Δppdk, upstream targeting sequence, and 0.82 kb extending 200 bp into the ORF, and downstream targeting sequence, 0.65-kb beginning 450 bp before the stop codon; Δpepck, upstream targeting sequence 0.76-kb finishing 160 bp before the starting ATG codon of gene LmxM27.1810, and downstream targeting sequence, 0.93 bp beginning 71 bp after the stop codon of gene LmxM27.1805 (supplemental Table S1). The knock-out cell lines were obtained and confirmed as previously described (21Feng X. Rodriguez-Contreras D. Polley T. Lye L.F. Scott D. Burchmore R.J. Beverley S.M.

Southern blot experiments confirmed that Δgk, Δppdk, and Δpepck null mutants did not retain any wild type copy of the GK, PPDK, and PEPCK genes, respectively (Fig. 1A). For the generation of add-back cell lines, LmxGK ORF, LmxPPDK ORF, and LmxPEPCK ORF were amplified by PCR from L. mexicana genomic DNA with specific oligonucleotides containing flanking BamHI restriction sites (supplemental Table S1) for cloning into the Leishmania expression vectors. LmxGK ORF and LmxPPDK ORF were subcloned into pX63NeoRI, whereas the LmxPEPCK ORF was subcloned into pX63PHLEO expression vectors (21Feng X. Rodriguez-Contreras D. Polley T. Lye L.F. Scott D.

Promastigotes were grown in the presence of 10 mm glucose, and uptake assays were performed using cells in early/middle logarithmic (0.6–1.4 × 107 cells/ml) or late logarithmic/early stationary (3.5–6.0 × 107 cells/ml) phases of growth. Uptake of 100 μm d-[14C]glucose was carried out between 0 and 60 s, and the data were fitted to a straight line by linear regression (Prism version 5; GraphPad, San Diego). Rate of glucose uptake was normalized to milligrams of total protein. To determine the expression levels of mannogen in wild type and Δpepck cell lines, this carbohydrate was quantified using the phenol-sulfuric acid method (23Christie W.W. Lipid Analysis: Isolation, Separation, Identification and Structural Analysis of Lipids. 3rd Ed. The Oil Press, Bridgwater, UK2003: 343-372Google Scholar). Promastigotes in late log/early stationary phases of growth were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS, in the presence or absence of 10 mm glucose at 26 °C by 24 h. Mannogen fractions were extracted from wild type, Δpepck, and Δpepck[PEPCK] parasites as described below. The sugar concentration of each sample was obtained using a standard curve for d-mannose. Samples were assayed in duplicate, and the experiment was repeated three times. The Δpepck[PEPCK] promastigotes expressed similar levels of PEPCK expression than wild type parasites as was determined by Western blot (WT/add-back ratio was 1.2 ± 0.01 and 1.4 ± 0.2 in both conditions, respectively). Total cell lysates used for Western blot experiments and normalization of several assays were obtained as described previously (7Rodríguez-Contreras D. Landfear S.M. Metabolic changes in glucose transporter-deficient Leishmania mexicana and parasite virulence.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20068-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and samples were stored in small aliquots at −70 °C. Protein determination was performed using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). In Western blot experiments, cell lysate samples were resolved by electrophoresis, transferred, and developed as described (24Tran K.D. Rodriguez-Contreras D. Vieira D.P. Yates P.A. David L.

Briefly, cell lysates were diluted 1:1 in 2× Laemmli sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol, heated to 70 °C for 5 min, and separated on a NuPAGE Novex BisTris 4–12% acrylamide gel using the XCell SureLock mini-cell system (Invitrogen). For immunoblotting, separated proteins were transferred to Whatman nitrocellulose membranes using the XCell II blot module (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C using 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20). Blots were developed using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) and Kodak BioMax MR films. Quantification of the band intensity was carried out by densitometry. All statistical analyses were carried out using a two-tailed unpaired t test (Prism version 5; GraphPad, San Diego). The ORF of GK, PPDK, PEPCK, FBPase, and PYK were amplified from L. mexicana genomic DNA by PCR using oligonucleotides designed against the NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences of the corresponding ORF from L. mexicana (LmxM34.3080, LmxM11.1000, LmxM27.1810, LmxM04.1160, and LmxM34.0030, respectively; see supplemental Table S1). Recombinant proteins were purified using the pET200 vector system (Invitrogen), by generating recombinant proteins with an NH2-terminal polyhistidine (His6) tag. Recombinant proteins were purified by cobalt column chromatography using the HisPur Cobalt Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and sent to Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. (Reamstown, PA), to raise specific antisera in rabbits. Specific antisera against the L. mexicana enzymes PPDK, PEPCK, FBPase, and PYK were used at 1:5000 dilution; goat anti-rabbit IgG F(ab2) fraction coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen) was used as described by the manufacturer. Two independent attempts to raise specific antiserum against the recombinant L. mexicana GK were made with unsuccessful results. Extraction of mannogen and phospholipid fractions, their analysis by HPTLC, and metabolic labeling of wild type and null mutant parasites were performed as detailed previously (7Rodríguez-Contreras D.

Promastigotes at late logarithmic/early stationary phase of growth were harvested by centrifugation, and 1 × 108 parasites were resuspended in 5 ml of glucose-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed iFBS. Parasites were metabolically labeled with the glucogenic precursors by adding to the cultures 0.5 mm of the cold substrate plus 5 μCi/ml of the radiolabeled precursors. The following radiolabeled precursors were used: l-[U-14C]aspartic acid (Moravek Biochemicals); l-[U-14C]alanine, l-[1-14C]alanine; [2-14C]alanine; [1,3-14C]glycerol, dl-[1-14C]lactic acid, sodium salt, l-[1-14C]sodium salt lactic acid, and d-[1-14C]lactic acid, sodium salt (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.); and d-[1-14C]mannose (Moravek Biochemicals). Amastigotes were metabolically labeled as described for promastigotes, using glucose-free DME-L medium, pH 5.5 (19Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B.

The pooled fractions were dried and partitioned by biphasic separation in 1-butanol/water (1:1 v/v). Phospholipids were recovered in the upper organic phase. The lower aqueous phase containing mannogen was extracted twice with water-saturated butanol, desalted using AG501-X8 resin (Bio-Rad), and dried before separating by HPTLC. In some assays, lipophosphoglycan (LPG) fractions were extracted from delipidated pellets from promastigotes using 1-butanol-saturated water (7Rodríguez-Contreras D. Landfear S.M. Metabolic changes in glucose transporter-deficient Leishmania mexicana and parasite virulence.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20068-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mannogen fractions were analyzed on glass-backed Silica Gel 60 plates (Merck) and developed twice in 1-butanol/ethanol/water (4:3:3 v/v). Radiolabeled bands were detected by fluorography after spraying HPTLC plates with EN3HANCE spray (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposing them to Kodak BioMax MR film at −70 °C. Films were obtained for each plate analyzed by fluorography at several exposure times. To quantify the levels of 14C label incorporation in mannogen, LPG and phospholipid fractions, counts/min, were obtained by duplicate for each sample assayed before its chromatographic analysis and normalized to protein content. In some experiments, twin plates were stained using the carbohydrate-specific orcinol-H2SO4 stain and heating to 100 °C for 10 min (7Rodríguez-Contreras D. Landfear S.M.

To define the role of the L. mexicana GK, PPDK, and PEPCK in gluconeogenesis, we generated the specific null mutants (referred as Δgk, Δppdk, and Δpepck, respectively) by targeted gene replacement (see “Experimental Procedures”). The loss of the respective GK, PPDK, and PEPCK ORF in the Δgk, Δppdk, and Δpepck null mutants, respectively, was confirmed by Southern blots of genomic DNA (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the loss of PPDK and PEPCK protein expression in Δppdk and Δpepck was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 1B), using specific antiserum generated against the respective proteins. Unfortunately, specific antibodies against the recombinant GK protein could not be generated after two attempts. To determine whether the lack of expression of these enzymes affects promastigote growth, wild type, Δgk, Δppdk, and Δpepck parasites were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm glucose (glucose-replete condition) or without glucose (glucose-limited condition). No difference in growth was observed between wild type and the null mutant parasites in any of the assayed conditions (Fig. 1C). In protozoan parasites such as Leishmania, glucose-6-phosphatase is absent (7Rodríguez-Contreras D. Landfear S.M. Metabolic changes in gl"
https://openalex.org/W1969774554,"Programmed cell death is essential part of development and cell homeostasis of any multicellular organism. We have analyzed programmed cell death in developing barley caryopsis at histological, biochemical and molecular level. Caspase-1, -3, -4, -6 and -8-like activities increased with aging of pericarp coinciding with abundance of TUNEL positive nuclei and expression of HvVPE4 and HvPhS2 genes in the tissue. TUNEL-positive nuclei were also detected in nucellus and nucellar projection as well as in embryo surrounding region during early caryopsis development. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of micro-dissected grain tissues revealed the expression of HvVPE2a, HvVPE2b, HvVPE2d, HvPhS2 and HvPhS3 genes exclusively in the nucellus/nucellar projection. The first increase in cascade of caspase-1, -3, -4, -6 and -8-like activities in the endosperm fraction may be related to programmed cell death in the nucellus and nucellar projection. The second increase of all above caspase-like activities including of caspase-9-like was detected in the maturating endosperm and coincided with expression of HvVPE1 and HvPhS1 genes as well as with degeneration of nuclei in starchy endosperm and transfer cells. The distribution of the TUNEL-positive nuclei, tissues-specific expression of genes encoding proteases with potential caspase activities and cascades of caspase-like activities suggest that each seed tissue follows individual pattern of development and disintegration, which however harmonizes with growth of the other tissues in order to achieve proper caryopsis development."
https://openalex.org/W2036832965,"Understanding tree recruitment is needed to forecast future forest distribution. Many studies have reported the relevant ecological factors that affect recruitment success in trees, but the potential for genetic-based differences in recruitment has often been neglected. In this study, we established a semi-natural reciprocal sowing experiment to test for local adaptation and microenvironment effects (evaluated here by canopy cover) in the emergence and early survival of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton), an emblematic Mediterranean forest tree. A novel application of molecular markers was also developed to test for family selection and, thus, for potential genetic change over generations. Overall, we did not find evidence to support local adaptation at the recruitment stage in our semi-natural experiment. Moreover, only weak family selection (if any) was found, suggesting that in stressful environments with low survival, stochastic processes and among-year climate variability may drive recruitment. Nevertheless, our study revealed that, at early stages of recruitment, microenvironments may favor the population with the best adapted life strategy, irrespectively of its (local or non-local) origin. We also found that emergence time is a key factor for seedling survival in stressful Mediterranean environments. Our study highlights the complexity of the factors influencing the early stages of establishment of maritime pine and provides insights into possible management actions aimed at environmental change impact mitigation. In particular, we found that the high stochasticity of the recruitment process in stressful environments and the differences in population-specific adaptive strategies may difficult assisted migration schemes."
https://openalex.org/W1995410719,"Highly conserved glycoside hydrolase family 70 glucansucrases are able to catalyze the synthesis of α-glucans with different structure from sucrose. The structural determinants of glucansucrase specificity have remained unclear. Residue Leu(940) in domain B of GTF180, the glucansucrase of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri 180, was shown to vary in different glucansucrases and is close to the +1 glucosyl unit in the crystal structure of GTF180-ΔN in complex with maltose. Herein, we show that mutations in Leu(940) of wild-type GTF180-ΔN all caused an increased percentage of (α1→6) linkages and a decreased percentage of (α1→3) linkages in the products. α-Glucans with potential different physicochemical properties (containing 67-100% of (α1→6) linkages) were produced by GTF180 and its Leu(940) mutants. Mutant L940W was unable to form (α1→3) linkages and synthesized a smaller and linear glucan polysaccharide with only (α1→6) linkages. Docking studies revealed that the introduction of the large aromatic amino acid residue tryptophan at position 940 partially blocked the binding groove, preventing the isomalto-oligosaccharide acceptor to bind in an favorable orientation for the formation of (α1→3) linkages. Our data showed that the reaction specificity of GTF180 mutant was shifted either to increased polysaccharide synthesis (L940A, L940S, L940E, and L940F) or increased oligosaccharide synthesis (L940W). The L940W mutant is capable of producing a large amount of isomalto-oligosaccharides using released glucose from sucrose as acceptors. Thus, residue Leu(940) in domain B is crucial for linkage and reaction specificity of GTF180. This study provides clear and novel insights into the structure-function relationships of glucansucrase enzymes."

The mRNA expression levels of GOLPH3, mTOR, Akt, p70S6 and 4E-BP1 in gastric cancer, carcinoma-adjacent and paired normal tissue were analyzed using RT-PCR. Western blotting was used to determine the protein expression of GOLPH3, p-mTOR, p-Akt, p-p70S6 and p-4E-BP1 in tissues.High expression protein levels of GOLPH3, p-AKT, p-mTOR, p70S6, p-4E-BP1 were positively associated with histological grade (p<0.05), depth of invasion (p<0.05), distant metastasis (p<0.05) and lymph node involvement (p<0.05). Compared with carcinoma-adjacent and paired normal tissues, the mRNA expression levels of GOLPH3, AKT, mTOR, p70S6 and 4EBP1 in gastric cancer tissues were significantly higher. The protein expression levels of GOLPH3, p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-p70S6 and p-4E-BP1 in gastric cancer tissues were also significantly higher than in carcinoma-adjacent and paired normal tissues. A strong positive correlation was observed between GOLPH3, p-mTOR, p-p70S6 and p-4EBP1 expression (r = 0.410, 0.303 and 0.276, respectively, p<0.05), but no significant correlation between the expression of GOLPH3 and p-Akt was observed.The GOPLH3 expression level is highly correlated with Akt/mTOR signaling in human gastric cancer samples. GOLPH3 combined with Akt/mTOR signaling activation may play an important role in the development, differentiation, invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2072902720,"Cholesterol-loaded foam cell macrophages are prominent in atherosclerotic lesions and play complex roles in both inflammatory signaling and lipid metabolism, which are underpinned by large scale reprogramming of gene expression. We performed a microarray study of primary human macrophages that showed that transcription of the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3A (SMPDL3A) gene is up-regulated after cholesterol loading. SMPDL3A protein expression in and secretion from primary macrophages are stimulated by cholesterol loading, liver X receptor ligands, and cyclic AMP, and N-glycosylated SMPDL3A protein is detectable in circulating blood. We demonstrate for the first time that SMPDL3A is a functional phosphodiesterase with an acidic pH optimum. We provide evidence that SMPDL3A is not an acid sphingomyelinase but unexpectedly is active against nucleotide diphosphate and triphosphate substrates at acidic and neutral pH. SMPDL3A is a major source of nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity secreted by liver X receptor-stimulated human macrophages. Extracellular nucleotides such as ATP may activate pro-inflammatory responses in immune cells. Increased expression and secretion of SMPDL3A by cholesterol-loaded macrophage foam cells in lesions may decrease local concentrations of pro-inflammatory nucleotides and potentially represent a novel anti-inflammatory axis linking lipid metabolism with purinergic signaling in atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2067236516,"After exposure to [U-(13)C3]glycerol, the liver produces primarily [1,2,3-(13)C3]- and [4,5,6-(13)C3]glucose in equal proportions through gluconeogenesis from the level of trioses. Other (13)C-labeling patterns occur as a consequence of alternative pathways for glucose production. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), metabolism in the citric acid cycle, incomplete equilibration by triose phosphate isomerase, or the transaldolase reaction all interact to produce complex (13)C-labeling patterns in exported glucose. Here, we investigated (13)C labeling in plasma glucose in rats given [U-(13)C3]glycerol under various nutritional conditions. Blood was drawn at multiple time points to extract glucose for NMR analysis. Because the transaldolase reaction and incomplete equilibrium by triose phosphate isomerase cannot break a (13)C-(13)C bond within the trioses contributing to glucose, the appearance of [1,2-(13)C2]-, [2,3-(13)C2]-, [5,6-(13)C2]-, and [4,5-(13)C2]glucose provides direct evidence for metabolism of glycerol in the citric acid cycle or the PPP but not an influence of either triose phosphate isomerase or the transaldolase reaction. In all animals, [1,2-(13)C2]glucose/[2,3-(13)C2]glucose was significantly greater than [5,6-(13)C2]glucose/[4,5-(13)C2]glucose, a relationship that can only arise from gluconeogenesis followed by passage of substrates through the PPP. In summary, the hepatic PPP in vivo can be detected by (13)C distribution in blood glucose after [U-(13)C3]glycerol administration."
https://openalex.org/W2109557575,"Background Breathing the inert gas Xenon (Xe) enhances hypothermic (HT) neuroprotection after hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in small and large newborn animal models. The underlying mechanism of the enhancement is not yet fully understood, but the combined effect of Xe and HT could either be synergistic (larger than the two effects added) or simply additive. A previously published study, using unilateral carotid ligation followed by hypoxia in seven day old (P7) rats, showed that the combination of mild HT (35°C) and low Xe concentration (20%), both not being neuroprotective alone, had a synergistic effect and was neuroprotective when both were started with a 4 h delay after a moderate HI insult. To examine whether another laboratory could confirm this finding, we repeated key aspects of the study. Design/Methods After the HI-insult 120 pups were exposed to different post-insult treatments: three temperatures (normothermia (NT) NT37°C, HT35°C, HT32°C) or Xe concentrations (0%, 20% or 50%) starting either immediately or with a 4 h delay. To assess the synergistic potency of Xe-HT, a second set (n = 101) of P7 pups were exposed to either HT35°C+Xe0%, NT+Xe20% or a combination of HT35°C+Xe20% starting with a 4 h delay after the insult. Brain damage was analyzed using relative hemispheric (ligated side/unligated side) brain tissue area loss after seven day survival. Results Immediate HT32°C (p = 0.042), but not HT35°C significantly reduced brain injury compared to NT37°C. As previously shown, adding immediate Xe50% to HT32°C increased protection. Neither 4 h-delayed Xe20%, nor Xe50% at 37°C significantly reduced brain injury (p>0.050). In addition, neither 4 h-delayed HT35°C alone, nor HT35°C+Xe20% reduced brain injury. We found no synergistic effect of the combined treatments in this experimental model. Conclusions Combining two treatments that individually were ineffective (delayed HT35°C and delayed Xe20%) did not exert neuroprotection when combined, and therefore did not show a synergistic treatment effect."

Inexpensive aphrodisiacs are available for purchase in suburban and rural areas. This study aims to investigate the association between aphrodisiac use and increased HIV risk for middle-aged and elderly men in Guangxi. Methods A matched case-control study of aphrodisiac use-associated HIV infection was performed among male subjects over 50 years old who were clients of low-cost commercial sex venues in Guangxi. The cases were defined as clients who were HIV-positive and two controls were selected for each case. The cases and the controls were matched on the visited sex venue, age (±3 years), number of years of purchasing sex (±3 years), and educational attainment. Subjects were interviewed and tested for HIV. Paired t-test or McNemar Chi-squared test were used to compare the characteristics between the cases and controls. A stepwise conditional logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with HIV infection. Findings This study enrolled 103 cases and 206 controls. Aphrodisiac use (P = 0.02, odds ratio (OR) = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.08–3.04), never using condom during commercial sex encounter (P = 0.03, odds ratio (OR) = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.08–3.07), and lacking a stable partner (P = 0.03, odds ratio (OR) = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.05–2.98) were found to be risk factors for HIV infection among the study groups. For subjects reporting aphrodisiac use, the frequency of purchasing sex was positively correlated with the frequency of aphrodisiac use (r = 0.3; p = 0.02). Conclusions Aphrodisiac use was significantly associated with increased HIV infection risk in men over 50 years old who purchased commercial sex in the suburban and rural areas of Guangxi. Further research and interventions should address the links between aphrodisiac use, commercial sex work, condom use, and increased HIV transmission."

We inhibited p110γ with AS604850 (1 µmol/liter) or knocked it down using an shRNA adenovirus or siRNA duplex in mouse and human islets and β-cells. Inhibition of PI3Kγ blunted the exocytotic and insulinotropic response to GIP receptor activation, whereas responses to the glucagon-like peptide-1 or the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 were unchanged. Downstream, we find that GIP, much like glucose stimulation, activates the small GTPase protein Rac1 to induce actin remodeling. Inhibition of PI3Kγ blocked these effects of GIP. Although exendin-4 could also stimulate actin remodeling, this was not prevented by p110γ inhibition. Finally, forced actin depolymerization with latrunculin B restored the exocytotic and secretory responses to GIP during PI3Kγ inhibition, demonstrating that the loss of GIP-induced actin depolymerization was indeed limiting insulin exocytosis.

Certain anti-diabetic agents, such as the incretin mimetic class of drugs, exploit this pathway by activating the GLP-1 receptor (22.Barnett A. Exenatide.Expert Opin.

The nonselective PI3K inhibitor wortmannin partially inhibits GIP stimulated insulin secretion in a clonal β-cell line, in a manner independent of cAMP generation (26.Straub S.G. Sharp G.W.

Cloning and characterization of a G protein-activated human phosphoinositide-3 kinase.Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GIP is shown to directly activate PI3Kγ in INS-1 cells, as measured by an increase in the production of its main phosphorylation product phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (25.Trümper A. Trümper K. Trusheim H. Arnold R. Göke B. Hörsch D. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide is a growth factor for β (INS-1) cells by pleiotropic signaling.Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that PI3Kγ is required for a robust insulin secretory response by promoting actin depolymerization and insulin granule recruitment to the plasma membrane (29.Pigeau G.M. Kolic J. Ball B.J. Hoppa M.B. Wang Y.W. Rückle T. Woo M. Manning Fox J.E. MacDonald P.E. Insulin granule recruitment and exocytosis is dependent on p110γ in insulinoma and human β-cells.Diabetes. 2009; 58: 2084-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Given the importance of incretin action to secretory dysfunction in type 2 diabetes, we now examine the requirement for PI3Kγ in incretin-stimulated insulin secretion. We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition, or shRNA-mediated knockdown of p110γ impairs the insulinotropic effect of GIP-R (but not GLP-1-R) activation in mouse and human islets. We show that GIP is a potent stimulator of insulin granule exocytosis, an effect that is blunted with p110γ inhibition or knockdown. Furthermore, we show that p110γ inhibition prevents GIP-induced actin depolymerization, likely by preventing activation of the small GTPase protein Rac1. Finally, we show that forced actin depolymerization restores the insulinotropic effect of GIP in cells lacking functional p110γ. Thus, we demonstrate that in addition to the classical cAMP pathway, PI3K signaling through p110γ is required for the full insulinotropic effect of GIP. Islets from male C57/BL6 mice were isolated by collagenase digestion and then handpicked. Human islets from 14 healthy donors (53 ± 5 years of age) were from either the Clinical Islet Laboratory at the University of Alberta or the IsletCore program at the Alberta Diabetes Institute. Islets were dispersed to single cells in Ca2+-free buffer. INS-1 832/13 cells were a gift of Prof. Christopher Newgard (Duke University). Islet and cell culture was as described previously (29.Pigeau G.M. Kolic J. Ball B.J. Hoppa M.B. Wang Y.W. Rückle T. Woo M. Manning Fox J.E. MacDonald P.E.

An Allstars negative control siRNA was from Qiagen (catalog no. 1027284). AS6048505 (2,2-difluoro-benzo[1,3] dioxol-5-ylmethylene)-thiazolidine-2,4-dione) (Selleckchem, Houston, TX) is a selective, competitive inhibitor of p110γ (IC50 = 250 nmol/liter for p110γ versus 4.5 µmol/liter for p110α and >20 µmol/liter for p110β) (31.Camps M.

It exhibits no notable activity against a wide array of kinases at concentrations of 1 µmol/liter. Latrunculin B, a potent actin-depolymerizing agent, was from Sigma-Aldrich. GIP and GLP-1(7–36) peptides were from AnaSpec (Fremont, CA). Exendin-4 was from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA), probed with primary antibodies (anti-p110α, anti-p110β, and anti-p110γ (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); and anti-Rac1 (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO)). Detection was with peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies (GE Healthcare), and visualization by chemiluminescence (ECL-Plus; GE Healthcare) and exposure to x-ray film (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) from dispersed mouse β-cells 48 h post transfection with siRNA constructs. Real time quantitative PCR assays were carried out on the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) as the amplification system. Primers were as follows: mouse p110γ forward, 5′-CATCAATAAAGAGAGAGTGCCCTTCGTCCTAAC-3′; mouse p110γ reverse, 5′-CTAGGTAAGCTCTAACACAGACATCCTGATTTC-3′; mouse cyclophilin forward, 5′-CGCGTCTCCTTCGAGCTGTTTGC-3′; and mouse cyclophilin reverse, 5′-GTGTAAA GTCACCACCCTGGCACATGAATC-3′. INS-1 cells were treated overnight with AS604850 (1 µmol/liter) or DMSO vehicle. Cells were preincubated for 2 h in 1 mmol/liter glucose Krebs Ringer buffer (KRB; 115 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter KCl, 24 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 2.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, and 10 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.4) and then stimulated for 25 min with either 1 or 16.7 mmol/liter glucose KRB. For GIP stimulation experiments, 100 nmol/liter GIP was included in the 1 or 16.7 mmol/liter glucose KRB. Rac1 activity was determined with GST-p21-activated kinase binding domain as described in the Rac1 pulldown activation biochem kit manual (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO). Islets (either mouse or human) were treated overnight with 1 µmol/liter AS604850, (or vehicle) or infected with a p110γ shRNA adenovirus (or scrambled control) for 72 h. Static insulin secretion measurements were performed at 37 °C in KRB, as described previously (29.Pigeau G.M. Kolic J. Ball B.J. Hoppa M.B. Wang Y.W. Rückle T. Woo M. Manning Fox J.E. MacDonald P.E.

GIP (100 nmol/liter), Ex-4 (100 nmol/liter), GLP-1 (10 nmol/liter), or latrunculin B (10 µmol/liter) was present during the 60-min 16.7-mmol/liter glucose KRB stimulation as indicated. Human islet perifusion was performed at 37 °C using a Brandel SF-06 system (Gaithersburg, MD) after a 2-h preincubation in KRB with 1 mmol/liter glucose. Thirty-five islets per lane were perifused (0.5 ml/min) with KRB with glucose as indicated. Samples stored at −20 °C were assayed for insulin via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MSD, Rockville, MD). We used the standard whole cell technique with the sine+DC lockin function of an EPC10 amplifier and Patchmaster software (HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). Experiments were performed at 32–35 °C. Solutions used for capacitance measurements are previously described (29.Pigeau G.M. Kolic J. Ball B.J. Hoppa M.B. Wang Y.W. Rückle T. Woo M. Manning Fox J.E.

For GIP (100 nmol/liter) or Ex-4 (100 nmol/liter) stimulation experiments, the peptides were added to the bath solution prior to patch-clamping. For some experiments, the pipette solution also contained 10 µmol/liter latrunculin B. For experiments in Fig. 9C, cells were preincubated in 1 mmol/liter bath solution for 1 h and glucose or GIP were added to the bath as indicated. Capacitance responses and Ca2+ currents were normalized to initial cell size and expressed as femtofarad per picofarad and picoamperes per picofarad. Mouse β-cells were identified by size, whereas human β-cells were identified by insulin immunostaining. Mouse islets were dispersed into single cells onto coverslips as previously described (29.Pigeau G.M. Kolic J. Ball B.J. Hoppa M.B. Wang Y.W. Rückle T. Woo M. Manning Fox J.E. MacDonald P.E.

Cells were treated overnight with the AS604850 inhibitor (1 µmol/liter) or vehicle. For FIGURE 7., FIGURE 8., the glucose concentration was 11 mmol/liter. For the low glucose experiments in Fig. 9, cells were preincubated with 2.8 mmol/liter KRB for 2 h prior to treatments. For GIP, Ex-4, and latrunculin B experiments, cells were treated as indicated. Immediately following treatment, cells were fixed with Z-FIX (Anatech, Battle Creek, MI). Cells were stained for insulin with rabbit anti-insulin primary antibody (Santa Cruz, CA) and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Cells were also stained for filamentous actin (F-actin) with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen). The cells were imaged with a Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 microscope and ×63 Plan ApoChromat objective (1.4 NA). Excitation was with a COLIBRITM (Carl Zeiss Canada, Toronto, Canada) LED light source with 495- or 555-nm filter set. Only insulin-positive cells were used for F-actin intensity measurement, which were analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health).FIGURE 8.p110γ inhibition prevents GIP-induced actin depolymerization in mouse β-cell.

For secretion and perifusion studies, the n values represent numbers of distinct islet preparations from at least three individual experiments. Electrophysiological data were extracted using FitMaster v2.32 (HEKA Electronik). All data were analyzed using the Student t test, or post hoc Tukey test following a two-way analysis of variance where more than two groups were present. Statistical outliers were removed using the Grubb's test. The data are expressed as means ± S.E., and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Expression of the p110γ catalytic subunit of PI3K was confirmed by Western blot in INS-1 832/13 cells, mouse islets, and human islets (Fig. 1A). The p110γ inhibitor AS604850 (1 µmol/liter, overnight) did not alter expression of p110γ protein in INS-1 832/13 cells (Fig. 1B). Because other PI3K catalytic isoforms could possibly compensate for each other, we examined the effects of AS604850 on protein expression of p110α and p110β in INS-1 832/13 cells and found no difference following overnight p110γ inhibition (Fig. 1B). Consistent with our previous findings using a different p110γ-selective inhibitor (29.Pigeau G.M. Kolic J. Ball B.J. Hoppa M.B. Wang Y.W. Rückle T. Woo M. Manning Fox J.E. MacDonald P.E. Insulin granule recruitment and exocytosis is dependent on p110γ in insulinoma and human β-cells.Diabetes. 2009; 58: 2084-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), inhibition of p110γ with AS604850, (1 µmol/liter overnight) decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from mouse islets by 50% (n = 18 from seven distinct experiments, p < 0.05; Fig. 1C). The insulinotropic effect of GIP (100 nmol/liter) was blunted by 46% following inhibition of p110γ (n = 17 from seven distinct experiments, p < 0.01; Fig. 1C). Insulin content was unaffected by overnight p110γ inhibition (n = 18 from seven distinct experiments, Fig. 1C (inset)), nor was there a change in GIP-R or GLP-1-R mRNA as measured by quantitative PCR (not shown). The secretory response to GIP was also blunted by p110γ inhibition in islets from six human donors (Fig. 2). This suggests that GIP-induced insulin secretion requires p110γ activity, in line with previous demonstrations that GIP can activate p110γ in INS-1 cells (25.Trümper A. Trümper K. Trusheim H. Arnold R. Göke B. Hörsch D. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide is a growth factor for β (INS-1) cells by pleiotropic signaling.Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and that GIP-dependent insulin secretion is blunted by the pan-PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (26.Straub S.G. Sharp G.W. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide stimulates insulin secretion via increased cyclic AMP and [Ca2+]1 and a wortmannin-sensitive signalling pathway.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

We thus examined the insulinotropic effect of GLP-1 (10 nmol/liter) and the GLP-1 agonist Ex-4 (100 nmol/liter) following p110γ inhibition in isolated islets. Insulin secretion in response to either GLP-1 or Ex-4 was not blunted following p110γ inhibition in mouse islets (n = 16 from six distinct experiments Fig. 1D). Similarly, Ex-4 remained able to stimulate insulin secretion from islets of six human donors (Fig. 2). This suggests that insulin secretion stimulated by the GIP-R, but not the GLP-1-R, requires p110γ. We next monitored β-cell exocytosis as whole cell capacitance increases in response to a train of membrane depolarizations following p110γ inhibition. AS604850 (1 µmol/liter, overnight) decreased exocytosis by 60% (n = 15–18, p < 0.01; Fig. 3A) in mouse β-cells. GIP treatment (100 nmol/liter) increased exocytosis in control cells by 2.3-fold (n = 15–17, p < 0.05; Fig. 3, A and B), an effect that was blunted following p110γ inhibition (n = 16–17; Fig. 3B). Conversely, Ex-4 treatment (100 nmol/liter) increased exocytosis in control cells by 2.6-fold (n = 15–19, p < 0.01; Fig. 3, A and C), and p110γ inhibition did not blunt the ability of Ex-4 to stimulate the exocytotic response (n = 16–19; Fig. 3C). We also monitored whole cell capacitance followi"
https://openalex.org/W1965758283,"Cephalopod mollusks possess a number of anatomical traits that often parallel vertebrates in morphological complexity, including a centralized nervous system with sophisticated cognitive functionality. Very little is known about the genetic mechanisms underlying patterning of the cephalopod embryo to arrive at this anatomical structure. Homeodomain (HD) genes are transcription factors that regulate transcription of downstream genes through DNA binding, and as such are integral parts of gene regulatory networks controlling the specification and patterning of body parts across lineages. We have used a degenerate primer strategy to isolate homeobox genes active during late-organogenesis from the European cuttlefish Sepia officinalis. With this approach we have isolated fourteen HD gene fragments and examine the expression profiles of five of these genes during late stage (E24-28) embryonic development (Sof-Gbx, Sof-Hox3, Sof-Arx, Sof-Lhx3/4, Sof-Vsx). All five genes are expressed within the developing central nervous system in spatially restricted and largely non-overlapping domains. Our data provide a first glimpse into the diversity of HD genes in one of the largest, yet least studied, metazoan clades and illustrate how HD gene expression patterns reflect the functional partitioning of the cephalopod brain."

The voltage lowering the blood pressure was used as the threshold for setting LL-CBS at 80% below the threshold. Treatment started 1 hour before left anterior descending coronary (LAD) occlusion, and continued until the end of experience. Ventricular effective refractory periods (ERP), monophasic action potential duration at 90% (APD90), ventricular arrhythmias, indices of heart rate variability, left stellate ganglion nerve activity (LSGNA) and infarct sizes were measured and analyzed.Ventricular ischemia resulted in an acute reduction of blood pressure, which was not significantly affected by LL-CBS. After 1 hour of LL-CBS, there was a progressive and significant increase in ERP, increase in APD90, and decrease in LSGNA vs the SHAM group (all P<0.05). LL-CBS apparently reduced premature ventricular contractions (PVC, 264±165 in the SHAM group vs 60±37 in the LL-CBS group; P<0.01) during LAD occlusion. Number of episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VF) was 8 in the Control group versus 3 in the LL-CBS group (80% versus 30%, P<0.05). LL-CBS obviously increased high frequency (HF) component (P<0.05) and decreased low frequency/high frequency ratio (P<0.05) compared with the SHAM group. Ischemic size was not affected by LL-CBS between the two groups.LL-CBS reduced the occurrences of ventricular arrhythmias during acute ischemia without affecting blood pressure. The procedure was associated with changes of electrophysiological characteristics, nerve activity and heart rate variability. Therefore, LL-CBS may protect from ventricular arrhythmias during acute ischemic events by modulating ANS."
https://openalex.org/W2004688772,"Solving demanding tasks requires fast and flexible coordination among different brain areas. Everyday examples of this are the social dilemmas in which goals tend to clash, requiring one to weigh alternative courses of action in limited time. In spite of this fact, there are few studies that directly address the dynamics of flexible brain network integration during social interaction. To study the preceding, we carried out EEG recordings while subjects played a repeated version of the Ultimatum Game in both human (social) and computer (non-social) conditions. We found phase synchrony (inter-site-phase-clustering) modulation in alpha band that was specific to the human condition and independent of power modulation. The strength and patterns of the inter-site-phase-clustering of the cortical networks were also modulated, and these modulations were mainly in frontal and parietal regions. Moreover, changes in the individuals’ alpha network structure correlated with the risk of the offers made only in social conditions. This correlation was independent of changes in power and inter-site-phase-clustering strength. Our results indicate that, when subjects believe they are participating in a social interaction, a specific modulation of functional cortical networks in alpha band takes place, suggesting that phase synchrony of alpha oscillations could serve as a mechanism by which different brain areas flexibly interact in order to adapt ongoing behavior in socially demanding contexts."
https://openalex.org/W1965864496,"Chaperones assist protein folding by preventing unproductive protein aggregation in the cell. In Escherichia coli, chaperonin GroEL/GroES (GroE) is the only indispensable chaperone and is absolutely required for the de novo folding of at least ∼60 proteins. We previously found that several orthologs of the obligate GroE substrates in Ureaplasma urealyticum, which lacks the groE gene in the genome, are E. coli GroE-independent folders, despite their significant sequence identities. Here, we investigated the key features that define the GroE dependence. Chimera or random mutagenesis analyses revealed that independent multiple point mutations, and even single mutations, were sufficient to confer GroE dependence on the Ureaplasma MetK. Strikingly, the GroE dependence was well correlated with the propensity to form protein aggregates during folding. The results reveal the delicate balance between GroE dependence and independence. The function of GroE to buffering the aggregation-prone mutations plays a role in maintaining higher genetic diversity of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2056034569,"Interactions between structured proteins require a complementary topology and surface chemistry to form sufficient contacts for stable binding. However, approximately one third of protein interactions are estimated to involve intrinsically disordered regions of proteins. The dynamic nature of disordered regions before and, in some cases, after binding calls into question the role of partner topology in forming protein interactions. To understand how intrinsically disordered proteins identify the correct interacting partner proteins, we evaluated interactions formed by the Drosophila melanogaster Hox transcription factor Ultrabithorax (Ubx), which contains both structured and disordered regions. Ubx binding proteins are enriched in specific folds: 23 of its 39 partners include one of 7 folds, out of the 1195 folds recognized by SCOP. For the proteins harboring the two most populated folds, DNA-RNA binding 3-helical bundles and α-α superhelices, the regions of the partner proteins that exhibit these preferred folds are sufficient for Ubx binding. Three disorder-containing regions in Ubx are required to bind these partners. These regions are either alternatively spliced or multiply phosphorylated, providing a mechanism for cellular processes to regulate Ubx-partner interactions. Indeed, partner topology correlates with the ability of individual partner proteins to bind Ubx spliceoforms. Partners bind different disordered regions within Ubx to varying extents, creating the potential for competition between partners and cooperative binding by partners. The ability of partners to bind regions of Ubx that activate transcription and regulate DNA binding provides a mechanism for partners to modulate transcription regulation by Ubx, and suggests that one role of disorder in Ubx is to coordinate multiple molecular functions in response to tissue-specific cues."
https://openalex.org/W2056086142,"The Gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is the causative agent of listeriosis, a severe food-borne infection characterised by abortion, septicaemia, or meningoencephalitis. L. monocytogenes causes outbreaks of febrile gastroenteritis and accounts for community-acquired bacterial meningitis in humans. Listeriosis has one of the highest mortality rates (up to 30%) of all food-borne infections. This human pathogenic bacterium is an important model organism for biomedical research to investigate cell-mediated immunity. L. monocytogenes is also one of the best characterised bacterial systems for the molecular analysis of intracellular parasitism. Recently several transcriptomic studies have also made the ubiquitous distributed bacterium as a model to understand mechanisms of gene regulation from the environment to the infected host on the level of mRNA and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). We have used semiconductor sequencing technology for RNA-seq to investigate the repertoire of listerial ncRNAs under extra- and intracellular growth conditions. Furthermore, we applied a new bioinformatic analysis pipeline for detection, comparative genomics and structural conservation to identify ncRNAs. With this work, in total, 741 ncRNA locations of potential ncRNA candidates are now known for L. monocytogenes, of which 611 ncRNA candidates were identified by RNA-seq. 441 transcribed ncRNAs have never been described before. Among these, we identified novel long non-coding antisense RNAs with a length of up to 5,400 nt e.g. opposite to genes coding for internalins, methylases or a high-affinity potassium uptake system, namely the kdpABC operon, which were confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. RNA-seq, comparative genomics and structural conservation of L. monocytogenes ncRNAs illustrate that this human pathogen uses a large number and repertoire of ncRNA including novel long antisense RNAs, which could be important for intracellular survival within the infected eukaryotic host."

Skeletal muscles of affected cattle are characterized by a selective reduction of SERCA1 in sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. In this study, we provide evidence that the ubiquitin proteasome system is involved in the reduced density of mutated SERCA1. The treatment with MG132, an inhibitor of ubiquitin proteasome system, rescues the expression level and membrane localization of the SERCA1 mutant in a heterologous cellular model. Cells co-transfected with the Ca(2+)-sensitive probe aequorin show that the rescued SERCA1 mutant exhibits the same ability of wild type to maintain Ca(2+) homeostasis within cells. These data have been confirmed by those obtained ex vivo on adult skeletal muscle fibers from a biopsy from a pseudomyotonia-affected subject. Our data show that the mutation generates a protein most likely corrupted in proper folding but not in catalytic activity. Rescue of mutated SERCA1 to sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane can re-establish resting cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration and prevent the appearance of pathological signs of cattle pseudomyotonia."

However, recent in vitro studies have revealed cytotoxic effects of local anesthetics on intervertebral disc (IVD) cells. Here we aimed to investigate the deteriorative effects of lidocaine and bupivacaine on rabbit IVDs using an organotypic culture model and an in vivo long-term follow-up model.For the organotypic culture model, rabbit IVDs were harvested and cultured for 3 or 7 days after intradiscal injection of local anesthetics (1% lidocaine or 0.5% bupivacaine). Nucleus pulposus (NP) cell death was measured using confocal microscopy. Histological and TUNEL assays were performed. For in vivo study, each local anesthetic was injected into rabbit lumbar IVDs under a fluoroscope. Six or 12 months after the injection, each IVD was prepared for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological analysis.In the organotypic culture model, both anesthetic agents induced time-dependent NP cell death; when compared with injected saline solution, significant effects were detected within 7 days. Compared with the saline group, TUNEL-positive NP cells were significantly increased in the bupivacaine group. In the in vivo study, MRI analysis did not show any significant difference. Histological analysis revealed that IVD degeneration occurred to a significantly level in the saline- and local anesthetics-injected groups compared with the untreated control or puncture-only groups. However, there was no significant difference between the saline and anesthetic agents groups.In the in vivo model using healthy IVDs, there was no strong evidence to suggest that discoblock with local anesthetics has the potential of inducing IVD degeneration other than the initial mechanical damage of the pressurized injection. Further studies should be performed to investigate the deteriorative effects of the local injection of analgesic agents on degenerated IVDs."
https://openalex.org/W2128864851,"Disulfide bridges are no longer considered to merely stabilize protein structure, but are increasingly recognized to play a functional role in many regulatory biomolecular processes. Recent studies have uncovered that the redox activity of native disulfides depends on their C-C-S-S dihedrals, χ2 and χ'2. Moreover, the interplay of chemical reactivity and mechanical stress of disulfide switches has been recently elucidated using force-clamp spectroscopy and computer simulation. The χ2 and χ'2 angles have been found to change from conformations that are open to nucleophilic attack to sterically hindered, so-called closed states upon exerting tensile stress. In view of the growing evidence of the importance of C-C-S-S dihedrals in tuning the reactivity of disulfides, here we present a systematic study of the conformational diversity of disulfides as a function of tensile stress. With the help of force-clamp metadynamics simulations, we show that tensile stress brings about a large stabilization of the closed conformers, thereby giving rise to drastic changes in the conformational free energy landscape of disulfides. Statistical analysis shows that native TDi, DO and interchain Ig protein disulfides prefer open conformations, whereas the intrachain disulfide bridges in Ig proteins favor closed conformations. Correlating mechanical stress with the distance between the two a-carbons of the disulfide moiety reveals that the strain of intrachain Ig protein disulfides corresponds to a mechanical activation of about 100 pN. Such mechanical activation leads to a severalfold increase of the rate of the elementary redox S(N)2 reaction step. All these findings constitute a step forward towards achieving a full understanding of functional disulfides."
https://openalex.org/W2017453569,"Bax is a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein. The activated Bax translocates to mitochondria, where it forms pore and permeabilizes the mitochondrial outer membrane. This process requires the BH3-only activator protein (i.e. tBid) and can be inhibited by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bcl-xL. Here by using single molecule fluorescence techniques, we studied the integration and oligomerization of Bax in lipid bilayers. Our study revealed that Bax can bind to lipid membrane spontaneously in the absence of tBid. The Bax pore formation undergoes at least two steps: pre-pore formation and membrane insertion. The activated Bax triggered by tBid or BH3 domain peptide integrates on bilayers and tends to form tetramers, which are termed as pre-pore. Subsequent insertion of the pre-pore into membrane is highly dependent on the composition of cardiolipin in lipid bilayers. Bcl-xL can translocate Bax from membrane to solution and inhibit the pore formation. The study of Bax integration and oligomerization at the single molecule level provides new evidences that may help elucidate the pore formation of Bax and its regulatory mechanism in apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2051333364,"N-Formylation of initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNA(Met)) by methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (MTF) is important for translation initiation in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. Unlike all other translation systems, the metazoan mitochondrial system is unique in using a single methionine tRNA (tRNA(Met)) for both initiation and elongation. A portion of Met-tRNA(Met) is formylated for initiation, whereas the remainder is used for elongation. Recently, we showed that compound heterozygous mutations within the nuclear gene encoding human mitochondrial MTF (mt-MTF) significantly reduced mitochondrial translation efficiency, leading to combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency and Leigh syndrome in two unrelated patients. Patient P1 has a stop codon mutation in one of the MTF genes and an S209L mutation in the other MTF gene. P2 has a S125L mutation in one of the MTF genes and the same S209L mutation as P1 in the other MTF gene. Here, we have investigated the effect of mutations at Ser-125 and Ser-209 on activities of human mt-MTF and of the corresponding mutations, Ala-89 or Ala-172, respectively, on activities of Escherichia coli MTF. The S125L mutant has 653-fold lower activity, whereas the S209L mutant has 36-fold lower activity. Thus, both patients depend upon residual activity of the S209L mutant to support low levels of mitochondrial protein synthesis. We discuss the implications of these and other results for whether the effect of the S209L mutation on mitochondrial translational efficiency is due to reduced activity of the mutant mt-MTF and/or reduced levels of the mutant mt-MTF."

In particular, electrostatic interactions provided by Arg-179 and Lys-247, together with hydrogen bond interactions contributed by hydroxyl groups of several tyrosine residues, are critical for phosphobase binding. In addition, Tyr-19 and His-132, which are positioned between AdoMet and phosphobase-binding sites, were suggested as catalytic residues (18Lee S.G. Kim Y. Alpert T.D. Nagata A. Jez J.M.

In the proposed reaction mechanism (Fig. 1, bottom), His-132 functions as a general base to abstract a proton from the hydroxyl group of Tyr-19. Next, the negatively charged tyrosine oxygen interacts with a hydrogen atom on the substrate amine, orienting the lone pair of electrons toward the methyl group of AdoMet to facilitate the bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (Sn2) methyl transfer to pEA. In this study, we combine computational modeling with protein crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis to re-examine the methylation of pEA catalyzed by PfPMT. Initially, we tested the ability of the proposed catalytic Tyr-19–His-132 dyad in deprotonating pEA, which suggests an energetically unfavorable mechanism. Instead, the quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations suggest an alternative mechanism involving Asp-128 to deprotonate pEA via a bridging water molecule (Fig. 1, bottom). Biochemical analysis of site-directed mutants targeting Asp-128 shows a loss of activity with pEA as a substrate but retains activity with pDME. The x-ray crystal structures of the PfPMT·D128A mutant in complex with S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) and either pEA or pCho reveal structural changes in the active site. Overall, these studies suggest the importance of Asp-128 in the initial step of the phosphobase methylation pathway catalyzed by PfPMT and provide insight on the evolution of multiple activities in the active site of the PMT from the malaria parasite.

The protonation state of the amine group in pEA was estimated using PROPKA (21Sondergaard C.R. Olsson M.H. Rostkowski M. Jensen J.H. Improved treatment of ligands and coupling effects in empirical calculation and rationalization of pKa values.J. Chem. Theory Comp. 2011; 7: 2284-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Five different PfPMT·pEA·AdoMet conformations, including the crystal structure and four MD snapshots along the equilibration, were used and resulted in an estimated pKa of 10.72 ± 1.51 (Table 1). Addition of AdoMet to the active site model decreases the pKa to 8.68 ± 0.52 because of electrostatic interaction with the positive charge of the AdoMet methyl group. A similar pKa shift (from ∼11 to ∼8) in the presence of the AdoMet cofactor was reported for lysine methyltransferase (22Zhang X. Bruice T.C. Enzymatic mechanism and product specificity of SET-domain protein lysine methyltransferase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5728-5732Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, we assigned the pEA substrate in its protonated form as NH3+-pEA.TABLE 1Calculated pKa values of the amine group of pEAModelPfPMT·pEAPfPMT·pEA·AdoMetX-ray structure12.379.12M18.368.06M211.049.44M310.318.42M411.508.34Average10.72 ± 1.518.68 ± 0.52 Open table in a new tab All QM/MM calculations were carried out using the QSite program of the Schrodinger Suite (QSite, version 5.7; Schrödinger, LLC: New York). The QM part was treated at the M06/6-31G(d,p) level of theory (23Zhao Y. Truhlar D.G. The M06 suite of density functions for main group thermochemistry, thermochemical kinetics, noncovalent interactions, excited states, and transition elements: two new functionals and systematic testing of four M06-class functionals and 12 other functionals.Theor. Chem. Acc. 2008; 120: 215-241Crossref Scopus (20448) Google Scholar), and the MM part was described with the OPLS force field (24Jorgensen W.L. Maxwell D.S. Tirado-Rives J. Development and testing of the OPLS all-atom force field on conformational energetics and properties of organic liquids.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11225-11236Crossref Scopus (10625) Google Scholar). The hydrogen link atom approach was used for the QM/MM boundary treatment. During the QM/MM geometry optimization, the QM region and all MM atoms within a distance of 10 Å from any atom in NH3+-pEA and AdoMet were allowed to relax. To calculate the QM/MM reaction profiles, we performed a linear scanning approach by imposing distance constraints. For each reaction profile, we carried out three iterative scans driving the reaction coordinate forward, backward, and repeatedly forward between reactant and product states. Analytical harmonic second derivatives were calculated to confirm the nature of the stationary point, with no imaginary eigenvalues for minima and only one imaginary eigenvalue for transition states. All MD simulations were carried out with AMBER11.0 using the AMBER03 (25Duan Y. Wu C. Chowdhury S. Lee M.C. Xiong G. Zhang W. Yang R. Cieplak P. Luo R. Lee T. Caldwell J. Wang J. Kollman P.

Atomic charges on pEA and AdoMet were determined at the HF/6–31G(d) level of theory using the restrained electrostatic potential approach (27Bayly C.I. Cieplak P. Cornell W. Kollman P.A. A well-behaved electrostatic potential based method using charge restraints for deriving atomic charges: the RESP model.J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 10269-10280Crossref Scopus (5633) Google Scholar). The long range electrostatic interaction was treated with particle mesh Ewald (28Darden T. York D. Pedersen L.G. Particle mesh Ewald: an Nlog(N) method for Ewald sums in large systems.J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (20827) Google Scholar), and the short range cut off for nonbonded interactions was set to 12 Å. The PfPMT·pEA·AdoMet system was immersed in a cubic box of TIP3P water molecules extending 15 Å from solute atoms in all three dimensions. The system was initially relaxed by imposing a position constraint on the heavy atoms of the PfPMT·pEA·AdoMet complex over 5,000 cycles of minimization procedure. The constraint was gradually released while heating the system in the NVT ensemble from 10 to 300 K over 50 ps. Temperature was controlled by the Andersen temperature coupling scheme, and the pressure was controlled by the isotropic position scaling protocol applied in AMBER. The SHAKE algorithm was employed to constrain all hydrogen atoms, and the time step was set to 2.0 fs (29Ryckaert J.P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C. Numerical integration of the cartesian equations of motion of a system with constraints: molecular dynamics of n-alkanes.J. Comp. Phys. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (16904) Google Scholar). The simulation was equilibrated for 1 ns, prior to MD runs of 10 ns at a target temperature of 300 K and pressure of 1 atmosphere. Three independent MD simulations were run. In all simulations, the root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of the enzyme backbone from their positions in the crystal structure was less than 1.2 Å. Structural and water-shell analyses from MD trajectories were carried out with PTRAJ module (30Roe D.R. Cheatham T.E. PTRAJ and CPPTRAJ: software for processing and analysis of molecular dynamics trajectory data.J. Chem. Theory Comp. 2013; 9: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (3495) Google Scholar). pEA binding affinities were estimated using the MM/GBSA approach (31Kollman P.A. Massova I. Reyes C. Kuhn B. Huo S. Chong L. Lee M. Lee T. Duan Y. Wang W. Donini O. Cieplak P. Srinivasan J. Case D.A. Cheatham T.E. Calculating structures and free energies of complex molecules: combining molecular mechanics and continuum models.Acc. Chem. Res. 2000; 33: 889-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar). The enthalpy term was computed from 1,000 snapshots evenly extracted from a single MD trajectory. Because of the high computational demand for the normal mode analysis, we used only 10 snapshots for each ternary complex to estimate the contribution of the entropy to binding (extracting structures every 1 ns). Generation of PfPMT D128A, D128E, D128Q, and D128N mutants used the QuikChange PCR mutagenesis method with the pET28a-PfPMT vector (18Lee S.G. Kim Y. Alpert T.D. Nagata A. Jez J.M.

https://openalex.org/W1985346991,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory RNAs, stable in circulation, and implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) etiology and progression. Therefore they are promising as early detection biomarkers of colorectal neoplasia. However, many circulating miRNAs are highly expressed in blood cells, and therefore may not be specific to colorectal neoplasia.We selected 7 miRNA candidates with previously reported elevated expression in adenoma tissue but low expression in blood cells (""rare"" miRNAs), 2 previously proposed as adenoma biomarkers, and 3 implicated in CRC. We conducted a colonoscopy-based case-control study including 48 polyp-free controls, 43 advanced adenomas, 73 non-advanced adenomas, and 8 CRC cases. miRNAs from plasma were quantified by qRT-PCR. Correlations between miRNA expression levels, adjusted for age and sex, were assessed. We used polytomous logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals quantifying the association between expression levels of miRNAs and case groups. We also conducted nonparametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses and estimated area under the curve (AUC).miRNAs with high expression levels were statistically significantly correlated with one another. No miRNAs were significantly associated with non-advanced or advanced adenomas. Strong (ORs >5) and significant associations with CRC were observed for 6 miRNA candidates, with corresponding AUCs significantly >0.5.These candidate miRNAs, assayed by qRT-PCR, are probably unsuitable as blood-based adenoma biomarkers. Strong associations between miRNAs and CRC were observed, but primarily with miRNAs highly expressed in blood cells. These results suggest that rare miRNAs will require new detection methods to serve as circulating biomarkers of adenomas."

Further, CaeA is reported to induce the expansion of regulatory T cell and prolongs the survival of skin allografts in mouse model of transplantation. In the current study, CaeA was purified and characterized from a novel species of actinomycetes, Actinoalloteichus spitiensis. The CaeA was identified for its novel immunosuppressive property by inhibiting in vitro and in vivo function of T cells. Methods Isolation, purification and characterization of CaeA were performed using High Performance Flash Chromatography (HPFC), NMR and mass spectrometry techniques. In vitro and in vivo T cell studies were conducted in mice using flowcytometry, ELISA and thymidine-[methyl-3H] incorporation. Results CaeA significantly suppressed T cell activation and IFN-γ secretion. Further, it inhibited the T cells function at G1 phase of cell cycle. No apoptosis was noticed by CaeA at a concentration responsible for inducing T cell retardation. Furthermore, the change in the function of B cells but not macrophages was observed. The CaeA as well exhibited substantial inhibitory activity in vivo. Conclusion This study describes for the first time novel in vitro and in vivo immunosuppressive function of CaeA on T cells and B cells. CaeA has enough potential to act as a future immunosuppressive drug."
https://openalex.org/W2073256738,"Sesquiterpenoid capsidiol, exhibiting antifungal activity against pathogenic fungus, is accumulated in infected ripe pepper fruits. In this study, we found a negative relation between the capsidiol level and lesion size in fruits infected with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, depending on the stage of ripening. To understand the developmental regulation of capsidiol biosynthesis, fungal-induced gene expressions in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways were examined in unripe and ripe pepper fruits. The sterol biosynthetic pathway was almost shut down in healthy ripe fruits, showing very low expression of hydroxymethyl glutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR) and squalene synthase (SS) genes. In contrast, genes in the carotenoid pathway were highly expressed in ripe fruits. In the sesquiterpene pathway, 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (EAS), belonging to a sesquiterpene cyclase (STC) family, was significantly induced in the ripe fruits upon fungal infection. Immunoblot and enzyme activity analyses showed that the STCs were induced both in the infected unripe and ripe fruits, while capsidiol was synthesized discriminatively in the ripe fruits, implying diverse enzymatic specificity of multiple STCs. Thereby, to divert sterol biosynthesis into sesquiterpene production, infected fruits were pretreated with an SS inhibitor, zaragozic acid (ZA), resulting in increased levels of capsidiol by more than 2-fold in the ripe fruits, with concurrent reduction of phytosterols. Taken together, the present results suggest that the enhanced expression and activity of EAS in the ripe fruits play an important role in capsidiol production, contributing to the incompatibility between the anthracnose fungus and the ripe pepper fruits."
https://openalex.org/W2045661425,"Many noncoding genomic loci have remained constant over long evolutionary periods, suggesting that they are exposed to strong selective pressures. The molecular functions of these elements have been partially elucidated, but the fundamental reason for their extreme conservation is still unknown.To gain new insights into the extreme selection of highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs), we used a systematic analysis of multi-omic data to study the epigenetic regulation of such elements during the development of Drosophila melanogaster. At the sequence level, HCNEs are GC-rich and have a characteristic oligomeric composition. They have higher levels of stable nucleosome occupancy than their flanking regions, and lower levels of mononucleosomes and H3.3, suggesting that these regions reside in compact chromatin. Furthermore, these regions showed remarkable modulations in histone modification and the expression levels of adjacent genes during development. Although HCNEs are primarily initiated late in replication, about 10% were related to early replication origins. Finally, HCNEs showed strong enrichment within lamina-associated domains.HCNEs have distinct and protective sequence properties, undergo dynamic epigenetic regulation, and appear to be associated with the structural components of the chromatin, replication origins, and nuclear matrix. These observations indicate that such elements are likely to have essential cellular functions, and offer insights into their epigenetic properties."
https://openalex.org/W2150794651,"Inhibitors of the catalytic activity of the 20S proteasome are cytotoxic to tumor cells and are currently in clinical use for treatment of multiple myeloma, whilst the deubiquitinase activity associated with the 19S regulatory subunit of the proteasome is also a valid target for anti-cancer drugs. The mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs and their selective toxicity towards cancer cells are not known. Here, we show that increasing the cellular levels of proteasome substrates using an inhibitor of Sec61-mediated protein translocation significantly increases the extent of apoptosis that is induced by inhibition of proteasomal deubiquitinase activity in both cancer derived and non-transformed cell lines. Our results suggest that increased generation of misfolded proteasome substrates may contribute to the mechanism(s) underlying the increased sensitivity of tumor cells to inhibitors of the ubiquitin-proteasome system."
https://openalex.org/W2054032736,"Specialized blood cells are generated through the entire life of an organism by differentiation of a small number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). There are strictly regulated mechanisms assuring a constant and controlled production of mature blood cells. Although such mechanisms are not completely understood, some factors regulating cell cycle and differentiation have been identified. We have previously shown that Caspase-3 is an important regulator of HSC homeostasis and cytokine responsiveness. p21cip1/waf1 is a known cell cycle regulator, however its role in stem cell homeostasis seems to be limited. Several reports indicate interactions between p21cip1/waf1 and Caspase-3 in a cell type dependent manner. Here we studied the impact of simultaneous depletion of both factors on HSC homeostasis. Depletion of both Caspase-3 and p21cip1/waf1 resulted in an even more pronounced increase in the frequency of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. In addition, simultaneous deletion of both genes revealed a further increase of cell proliferation compared to single knock-outs and WT control mice, while apoptosis or self-renewal ability were not affected in any of the genotypes. Upon transplantation, p21cip1/waf1-/- bone marrow did not reveal significant alterations in engraftment of lethally irradiated mice, while Caspase-3 deficient HSPC displayed a significant reduction of blood cell production. However, when both p21cip1/waf1 and Caspase-3 were eliminated this differentiation defect caused by Caspase-3 deficiency was abrogated."
