Yet only about 10% of those infected develop tuberculosis. Genetic variation within host populations is known to be significant in humans and animals, but the nature of genetic control of host resistance to tuberculosis remains poorly understood. Previously we mapped a new genetic locus on mouse chromosome 1, designated sst1 (for supersusceptibility to tuberculosis 1). Here we show that this locus mediates innate immunity in sst1 congenic mouse strains and identify a candidate gene, Intracellular pathogen resistance 1 (Ipr1), within the sst1 locus. The Ipr1 gene is upregulated in the sst1 resistant macrophages after activation and infection, but it is not expressed in the sst1 susceptible macrophages. Expression of the Ipr1 transgene in the sst1 susceptible macrophages limits the multiplication not only of M. tuberculosis but also of Listeria monocytogenes and switches a cell death pathway of the infected macrophages from necrosis to apoptosis. Our data indicate that the Ipr1 gene product might have a previously undocumented function in integrating signals generated by intracellular pathogens with mechanisms controlling innate immunity, cell death and pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2127684282,"Human DAB2IP (hDAB2IP), a novel GTPase-activating protein modulating the Ras-mediated signaling and tumor necrosis factor-mediated apoptosis, is a potent growth inhibitor in human prostate cancer (PCa). Loss of hDAB2IP expression in PCa is due to altered epigenetic regulation (i.e. DNA methylation and histone modification) of its promoter region. The elevated polycomb Ezh2, a histone methyltransferase, has been associated with PCa progression. In this study, we have demonstrated that an increased Ezh2 expression in normal prostatic epithelial cells can suppress hDAB2IP gene expression. In contrast, knocking down the endogenous Ezh2 levels in PCa by a specific small interfering RNA can increase hDAB2IP expression. The association of Ezh2 complex (including Eed and Suz12) with hDAB2IP gene promoter is also detected in PCa cells but not in normal prostatic epithelial cells. Increased Ezh2 expression in normal prostatic epithelial cells by cDNA transfection facilitates the recruitment of other components of Ezh2 complex to the hDAB2IP promoter region accompanied with the increased levels of methyl histone H3 (H3) and histone deacetylase (HDAC1). Consistently, data from PCa cells transfected with Ezh2 small interfering RNA demonstrated that reduced Ezh2 levels resulted in the dissociation of Ezh2 complex accompanied with decreased levels of both methyl H3 and HDAC1 from hDAB2IP gene promoter. We further unveiled that the methylation status of Lys-27 but not Lys-9 of H3 in hDAB2IP promoter region is consistent with the hDAB2IP levels in both normal prostatic epithelial cells and PCa cells. Together, we conclude that hDAB2IP gene is a target gene of Ezh2 in prostatic epithelium, which provides an underlying mechanism of the down-regulation of hDAB2IP gene in PCa.

The human DOC-2/DAB2 interactive protein gene (hDAB2IP) located at chromosome 9q33.1-33.3 is a new member of the Ras GTPase-activating family gene (1Chen H. Pong R.C. Wang Z. Hsieh J.T.

We have demonstrated that normal prostatic epithelial cells express higher hDAB2IP levels than PCa cells, which is due to epigenetic alternation (i.e. aberrant DNA methylation and histone deacetylation) in the promoter region during carcinogenesis.

In this study, we found an inverse correlation between Ezh2 and hDAB2IP gene expression in either normal prostatic epithelia or PCa cells. Increased Ezh2 expression in normal prostatic epithelial cells could inhibit the hDAB2IP promoter activity and its gene expression. In contrast, knockdown of Ezh2 expression by siRNA in PCa cells resulted in an elevated hDAB2IP gene expression. These data prompted us to investigate the role of Ezh2 in modulating hDAB2IP gene expression, and we demonstrated that Ezh2 complex and histone deacetylase (HDAC) are associated with hDAB2IP promoter regions in PCa cells but not in normal prostatic epithelial cells. The outcome of this study provides an underlying mechanism of the functional role of Ezh2 in metastatic PCa.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures—Three human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, C4-2, and PC3) were maintained in T medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (27Zhou J.

After 24 h, PrEC1 and PZ-HPV-7 cells were co-transfected with Myc-tagged human Ezh2 expression construct (32Sewalt R.G. Lachner M. Vargas M. Hamer K.M. den Blaauwen J.L. Hendrix T. Melcher M.

Toyooka S. Gazdar A.F. Hsieh J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3121-3130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine Plus transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Luciferase assay was described previously (1Chen H. Pong R.C. Wang Z. Hsieh J.T. Genomics. 2002; 79: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 2Chen H. Toyooka S. Gazdar A.F. Hsieh J.T. J.

The relative luciferase activity was calculated as described previously (2Chen H. Toyooka S. Gazdar A.F. Hsieh J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3121-3130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).RNA Isolation and Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)—Total cellular RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Inc) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To measure hDAB2IP or Ezh2 mRNA levels, 1 μg of total cellular RNA from each cell line was reversibly transcribed into first strand cDNA using iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad).The first strand cDNA was further amplified by qRT-PCR using hDAB2IP primer set F-hDAB2IP, 5′-TGGACGATGTGCTCTATGCC-3′; R-hDAB2IP, 5′-GGATGGTGATGGTTTGGTAG-3′ or Ezh2 primer set F-Ezh2, 5′-GCCAGACTGGGAAGAAATCTG-3′; or R-Ezh2, 5′-TGTGCTGGAAAATCCAAGTCA-3′ in a 40-μl reaction mixture containing 20 μl of iQ™ SYBGREEN Supermix® (Bio-Rad). The reactions were carried out in a 96-well plate, and PCR amplification protocol was followed by 95 °C (3 min) and 36 cycles of amplification cycle (95 °C (30 s), 55 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (1 min)) using an iCycler iQ machine (Bio-Rad). The 18S cDNA (F-18S, 5′-GGAATTGACGGAAGGGCACCACC-3′; R-18S, 5′-GTGCAGCCCCGGACATCTAAGG-3′) was used as an internal control. All experiments have been repeated twice in duplicates. hDAB2IP or Ezh2 mRNA level was determined by normalizing with the 18 S cDNA of each sample.The quality control was carried out using both electrophoresis analyses on a 2% NuSieve agarose gel (3:1, FMC Bioproducts) and melting curve analysis performed immediately after the end of amplification using 95 °C (1 min), 55 °C (1 min), and 80 cycles of 0.5 °C increment beginning at 55 °C. We also performed standard curve for hDAB2IP and Ezh2 to ensure the linearity and efficiency of both genes.Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed with whole cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and were alternately frozen and thawed three times in -80 °C to rupture the cell membranes. Samples were incubated for 30 min on ice to lyse the nuclei and then centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 5 min to pellet the cell membranes. The protein concentration of each sample was determined by a standard Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein (20 μg) of each cell line were subjected to Western blot analysis. Antibodies used for probing were hDAB2IP (3Wang Z. Tseng C.P. Pong R.C. Chen H. McConnell J.D. Navone N. Hsieh J.T. J. Biol.

Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells were transfected either with both Ezh2, siRNA duplexes together (100 nmol each) or with control siRNA (200 nmol) using RNAiFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At various time points after transfection, the cells were harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—This assay for hDAB2IP gene promoter was performed as described previously (2Chen H. Toyooka S. Gazdar A.F. Hsieh J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3121-3130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For DOC-2/DAB2 gene promoter, the same PCR condition was applied with two primer sets as follows: first PCR (5′-ACATCACTCGCAGTGGC-3′ and 5′-GGCGAGAGATATGGTTC-3′) and second PCR (5′-CTCGCGGAGCTCAGGGGAG-3′ and 5′-GGTAACTCCCCCTCAACGTG-3′). Briefly, precleared chromatin from 2 × 106 cells was used for each ChIP assay, and 5 μg of each antibody was used in this assay including Ezh2, Suz12, trimethyl H3 (Lys-27), trimethyl H3 (Lys-9), and dimethyl H3 (Lys-9) purchased from Abcam Inc.; and Eed, dimethyl H3 (Lys-27), monomethyl H3 (Lys-27), acetyl H3, and HDAC1 purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The total input or immunoprecipitated DNA was determined by qPCR at least twice with the equation ΔCt (threshold cycle) of each sample = mean of Ct(antibody) - mean of Ct(input).RESULTSProfiling hDAB2IP and Ezh2 Expression in Various Prostatic Epithelia—To evaluate the expression profile of hDAB2IP gene and Ezh2 in the prostate cell lines, we performed qRT-PCR to document the steady-state levels of hDAB2IP (Fig. 1A) and Ezh2 (Fig. 1B) mRNA in cells derived from normal prostatic epithelium (PrEC1, PrEC2, PrEC3, PZ-HPV-7, and SWNPC2), primary PCa cells (SWPC1, SWPC2, and SWPC3), or metastatic PCa cell lines (LNCaP, C4-2, PC3, MADPC2a, MADPC2b, VCAP, and DU145). We observed a trend of decreasing hDAB2IP mRNA from normal cells to malignant cells; however, an opposite trend of Ezh2 mRNA was seen from normal cells to malignant cells. Western blot data (Fig. 1C) also confirmed the qRT-PCR results. Taken together, an inverse correlation between Ezh2 and hDAB2IP gene expression prompted us to investigate the possibility that hDAB2IP gene expression could be modulated by the Ezh2 complex particularly, since loss of hDAB2IP expression was frequently observed in metastatic PCa cells.The Inhibitory Effect of Ezh2 on hDAB2IP Gene Expression—To test whether Ezh2 is a negative regulator to modulate hDAB2IP gene expression in PCa cells, Western blot analysis was performed using whole cell extract prepared from PCa cells transfected with either a mixture of two different Ezh2 siRNAs (23Varambally S.

The significantly decreased Ezh2 levels in PC3 (Fig. 2A) and in DU145 (Fig. 2C) were observed within 48–72 h after transfection, and the reduced Ezh2 protein became more prominent 96 h after transfection. Under this condition, the elevated levels of hDAB2IP protein were detected in both PCa cells. In contrast, Lamin A/C siRNA duplex did not alter Ezh2 or hDAB2IP levels in either cell type (Fig. 2, B and D). To demonstrate the specific effect of Ezh2 on hDAB2IP gene expression, the DOC-2/DAB2 gene (27Zhou J. Hsieh J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 278: 27793-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which is not regulated by Ezh2 in prostate (Fig. 2), was used as a negative control in this study.Fig. 2The effect of Ezh2 on hDAB2IP protein expression in PCa cells. The cell lysate from PC3 cells (A and B) or DU145 cells (C and D) was collected at the indicated time points after transfecting with either Ezh2 siRNA (A or C) or control Lamin A/C siRNA (B or D). The Western blot analyses were performed using antibodies against Ezh2, hDAB2IP, DOC-2/DAB2, and LaminA/C. Actin was used as an internal loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the inhibitory effect of Ezh2 on hDAB2IP gene expression via the transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation, we examined the hDAB2IP promoter activity in several normal prostatic epithelial cells by transfecting with both pGL3-P2 and Ezh2 expression vectors. We observed that an increased Ezh2 protein expression (Fig. 3A) in normal prostatic epithelial cells could inhibit the hDAB2IP promoter activity (Fig. 3, B–E) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Using qRT-PCR, we also observed a similar inhibitory effect of Ezh2 on hDAB2IP mRNA levels in these and two other normal epithelial cells such as PrEC2 and PrEC3 (data not shown). We also generated a stable Ezh2-expressing PZ-HPV-7 transfectant and found reduction of the endogenous hDAB2IP protein levels in these cells (Fig. 3F). These data clearly indicate that the suppression of hDAB2IP gene promoter activity is mediated by Ezh2 protein.Fig. 3The inhibitory effect of EZH2 on hDAB2IP promoter activity and protein expression in normal prostatic epithelia. PZ-HPV-7 (A, B, D, and F) and PrEC1 (C and E) cells were transfected with both Myc-tagged Ezh2 expression vector and pGL3-P2 reporter gene construct. In the time course experiment, Ezh2 expression vector (0.2 μg) and pGL3-P2 reporter gene construct (0.5 μg) were used.

In Fig. 4A, robust binding of Ezh2 as well as two other components, Eed and Suz12, to the hDAB2IP promoter was seen in PC3 cells, the moderate binding of Ezh2 complex was detected in DU145 cells, and the lowest binding of Ezh2 complex was detected in PZ-HPV-7 cells. Noticeably, the amount of Ezh2 complex associated with hDAB2IP promoter inversely correlated with hDAB2IP mRNA and protein expression patterns in these cells (Fig. 1). On the other hand, we did not observe an inverse correlation between Ezh2 and DOC-2/DAB2 levels in these cells (Fig. 1C) or a consistent association pattern between Ezh2 complex and DOC-2/DAB2 gene promoter (Fig. 4).Fig. 4The status of PcG complex, HDAC1, histone methylation, and histone acetylation on the hDAB2IP promoter region in prostatic epithelia. A ChIP assay was performed using DNA-protein complex isolated from PZ-HPV-7 (lane 1), PC3 (lane 2), and DU145 (lane 3) cells immunoprecipitated with various antibodies. The amount of endogenous hDAB2IP or DOC-2/DAB2 gene promoter was determined by qPCR using the specific primer set described previously (2Chen H. Toyooka S. Gazdar A.F. Hsieh J.T. J. Biol.

Otte A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the association of HDAC1 with the hDAB2IP promoter region. As shown in Fig. 4B, the higher levels of HDAC1 associated with hDAB2IP promoter were detected in PC3 and DU145 cells than in PZ-HPV-7 cells. In contrast, the lower levels of acetyl H3 associated with hDAB2IP promoter were seen in these two PCa cells than in PZ-HPV-7 cells (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that this repression complex associated with hDAB2IP promoter contains both Ezh2 complex and HDAC1.Furthermore, by increasing Ezh2 gene expression in PZ-HPV-7 cells, we observed that the presence of Ezh2 protein could recruit not only other components of PcG proteins such as Eed and Suz12 (Fig. 5A) but also HDAC1 to the hDAB2IP promoter region in these cells. Meanwhile, the decreased acetyl H3 level became more apparent in these cells (Fig. 5B). Taken together, Ezh2 plays a key role in recruiting other transcription repressors to the hDAB2IP promoter region in prostatic epithelia. On the other hand, we were able to show the dissociation of both PcG complex and HDAC1 from hDAB2IP gene promoter in PC3 (Fig. 6) and DU145 (Fig. 6) when their endogenous Ezh2 levels were knocked down by Ezh2 siRNA (Fig. 2). Under the same condition, the acetyl H3 levels were elevated. For DOC-2/DAB2 gene, no consistent pattern of these complexes could be observed in the promoter region (Figs. 4 and 5). Thus, these data further support the notion that hDAB2IP is an Ezh2 target gene.Fig. 5The impact of Ezh2 on the status of H3 methylation and acetylation of the hDAB2IP promoter region in PZ-HPV-7 cells after recruiting PcG complex proteins and HDAC1. A ChIP assay was performed using DNA-protein complex isolated from PZ-HPV-7 cells transfected with different amounts of Ezh2 expression vector and immunoprecipitated with various antibodies.

In parallel studies, GIP decreased bax promoter activity. Serial deletion analysis of the bax promoter demonstrated that the region -682 to -320, containing FHRE-II (5AAAACAAACA), was responsible for GIP-mediated effects. Foxo1 bound to FHRE-II in gel mobility shift assays, and Foxo1-FHRE-II interactions conferred GIP responsiveness to the bax promoter. INS-1 cells incubated under proapoptotic and glucolipotoxic conditions demonstrated increased nuclear localization of Foxo1 and bax promoter activity and decreased cytoplasmic phospho-PKB/Foxo1.

Recent studies have revealed that Foxo (FKHR) transcription factors (7Kaestner K.H. Knöchel W. Martinez D.E.

Members of the Foxo subfamily share several structural features; in addition to the highly conserved central DNA binding Foxo domain (Fox box), Foxo members contain a C-terminal transactivation domain and three consensus phosphorylation sites for PKB located at Thr24, Ser256, and Ser316 (9Rena G.

Phosphorylation by PKB causes redistribution of Foxo1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and the resulting decrease in nuclear Foxo1 has been proposed as the possible mechanism for the inhibition of Foxo1-mediated transcription (13Webster K.A. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Regulation of insulin secretion involves the gut-derived peptide incretin hormones glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and the proglucagon gene products glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1)-(7–37) and GLP-1-(7–36)-amide (14Pederson R.A.

Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4433-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and, because β-cell death is a major contributing factor to diabetes mellitus, an understanding of the underlying mechanisms that increase cell survival is clearly important. GIP has been shown to activate PKB in INS-1 β-cells (20Trümper A. Trümper K. Trusheim H. Arnold R. Göke B. Hörsch D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), but neither the signaling pathway responsible nor the subsequent downstream events have been identified. In the present study, we demonstrated that GIP, acting via the PI3K/PKB signaling pathway, decreases nuclear Foxo1 interaction with the Foxo1 response element (FHRE) in INS-1 β-cells, resulting in down-regulation of the bax gene during glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis. Additionally, we have shown that these events are intimately involved in GIP-induced reduction of glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis in both dispersed wild-type C57BL/6 mouse islet cells and Vancouver diabetic fatty (VDF) Zucker rats in vivo. This is the first demonstration of PI3K/PKB/Foxo1-mediated transcriptional regulation of bax expression, and it adds the bax gene to the list of Foxo1-responsive genes.

Construction of Human Bax Promoter-Luciferase Plasmids—The human bax gene promoter (972 bp; GenBank™ accession number AB183034) was cloned into the pGL3 vector (Promega), and various deletion constructs were prepared by PCR with NheI and HindIII insertions for directed cloning. Site-directed mutant constructs were prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All transfection plasmids were prepared using Qiagen plasmid midi kits (Qiagen). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays—INS-1 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells per 6-well plate.

Nuclei were then pelleted at 2000 × g in a microfuge, and the supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was collected. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and the fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—For studies on the effect of GIP on PKB and Foxo1 phosphorylation, INS-1 cells (106 cells per well) were incubated in the presence or absence (control) of GIP at the concentrations indicated in legends to Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Proteins (15 μg of protein per well) from each sample were separated on a 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) membranes. Probing of the membranes was performed with phospho-PKB (Ser473), PKB, phospho-Foxo1 (Ser256), Foxo1, and β-tubulin purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies.

Gel Mobility Shift Assays—For the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, oligonucleotides for FHRE-I (5′-CACAAACACAAACATTCGAGT-3′) and FHRE-II (5′-AGGAAAAAACAAACAAACAGA-3′) were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP using the T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) and annealed with 5-fold excess of its complementary, unlabeled oligonucleotide. The annealed probe was separated from unincorporated nucleotides using a QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). Nuclear proteins (5 μg) were incubated in a binding buffer for Foxo1 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) per reaction) with 5 × 105 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides. To verify the specificity of the binding reaction, a 12.5- to 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the reaction before adding the labeled probe. For supershift assays, an antibody against Foxo1 was preincubated with nuclear proteins for 30 min before the addition of a labeled probe. Samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TES buffer (6.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 3.3 mm sodium acetate) at 130 V for 1.5 h. Gels were dried and exposed for the appropriate period at -70 °C with intensifying screens. Islet Isolation and Cell Culture—Male C57BL/6, GIP receptor knockout (GIPR-/-) (21Miyawaki K. Yamada Y.

Science. 1995; 270: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar) mice (25–30 g) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injections of pentobarbital (30–40 mg/kg). Islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and dispersed to single cells as described by MacDonald et al. (23MacDonald P.E. Ha X.F. Wang J. Smukler S.R. Sun A.M. Gaisano H.Y. Salapatek A.M. Backx P.H. Wheeler M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Dispersed islets were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5 mm glucose, 0.25% HEPES, 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Induction of Apoptosis and Apoptosis Assay—INS-1 cells or dispersed mouse islets were incubated with a 2 mmol/liter long chain free fatty acid mixture (2:1 oleate to palmitate) (Sigma) containing high glucose (15 mm). After 24 h, GIP (100 nm) was added every 8 h to culture media and incubated for an additional 24 h. Detection of apoptotic cells was performed with the APOPercentage apoptosis assay kit (Biocolor Ltd., Belfast, Northern Ireland) based on the specific uptake of dye by an apoptotic “flip-flop” mechanism. Quantitative analysis was performed using a colorimetric assay following release of the dye from the apoptotic cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Concentrations of released APOPercentage dye (μm), which are proportional to the level of apoptosis, were determined from absorbance values using a standard curve and normalized to levels observed with control cells. Confocal Microscopy—INS-1 cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant forms of vectors encoding FLAG-Foxo1. After overnight serum starvation, the cells were treated for 6 h with GIP (100 nm). Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature and immunostained successively with an α-FLAG antibody and a secondary Texas Red® dye-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. Cell nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole and mounted with Hydromount (with 2.5% (v/v) 1,4-diazobicyclo[2, 2, 2]octane anti-fade reagent). The transfected cells were imaged using a Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope (Axioskop2), and all imaging data were analyzed using the Northern Eclipse program (version 6). GIP Infusion Study—A 2-week continuous infusion of GIP (10 pmol/kg/min synthetic porcine GIP1-42; Bachem, Torrence, CA) was administered to VDF Zucker rats and their lean litter mate controls (8–12 weeks old) via an Alzet micro-osmotic pump (Alza Corp., Minneapolis, MN) implanted in the intraperitoneal region. Prior to surgical implantation of the pump, the rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injections of pentobarbital (40 mg/kg). Rats were sacrificed at the end of the infusion, and pancreata were harvested and fixed in paraffin for histological studies. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines put forth by the University of British Columbia Committee on Animal Care and the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Immunohistochemistry—Pancreatic sections from GIP-treated and control rats were subjected to a double immunostaining for Bax and Bcl-2. After deparaffinization, the sections were incubated with Bax and Bcl-2 antibodies and visualized with Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody and Texas Red® dye-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. Cell nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole and imaged using a Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope (Axioskop2). A TUNEL assay was performed in adjacent sections to detect DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells using the Apoptag® apoptosis detection kit (Intergen Company, Purchase, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantification of staining intensity was performed by computer-based densitometric analysis using the Northern Eclipse program (version 6). Values of “average gray” were first calculated using a formula of total gray/pixel area. Values were then compared with those of lean islets and expressed as relative fluorescence intensity (RFI). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. with the number of individual experiments presented in the legends to Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Data were analyzed using the non-linear regression analysis program PRISM (GraphPad, San Diego, CA), and significance was tested using ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparison test or the Newman-Keuls post hoc test as indicated in the legends to Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. GIP Activates a PKB/Foxo1 Signaling Pathway in INS-1 β-Cells—Treatment of INS-1 cells with 100 nm GIP increased phosphorylation of PKB at Ser473 (Fig. 1A), but had no effect on total PKB levels. Increased phosphorylation of PKB was observed by 15 min after the start of treatment, was almost maximal by 1 h (Fig. 1A), and was sustained for 6 h. GIP stimulation was concentration-dependent with an EC50 value of 11.38 ± 0.23 nm (Fig. 1B). GIP treatment also increased phosphorylation of Foxo1 at Ser256 over a similar time frame (Fi"

These compounds serve a wide range of functions in plants, from pigmentation and UV protection to the regulation of hormone transport.

This is the first indication that differential targeting of the biosynthetic machinery may be used to regulate the deposition of plant secondary products at diverse sites of action within the cell. Flavonoids represent a major class of plant secondary metabolites that include the flavonols, anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins), and isoflavonoids. These compounds are well known for their roles in flower pigmentation, UV protection, signaling, male fertility, and defense against microbial pathogens (1Winkel-Shirley B.

Flavonoids are synthesized via a well-characterized biosynthetic pathway that has been localized to the cytoplasm in many different plant species (11Winkel B. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2004; 55: 85-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 12Winkel-Shirley B. Physiol. Plant. 1999; 107: 142-149Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 13Hrazdina G. Jensen R.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 241-267Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The products are then deposited in a variety of cellular locations. In some tissues, such as the epidermis of leaves and flowers and endothelium of the developing seed coat, flavonoids are transported primarily to the vacuole by processes that appear to involve multidrug resistance-associated protein or multidrug and toxic compound extrusion proteins (14Goodman C.D. Casati P. Walbot V. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1812-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 15Debeaujon I. Peeters A.J.M. Léon-Kloosterziel K.M. Koornneef M.

Bot. 1999; 84: 135-143Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Vesicles apparently involved in transport of flavonoids to the cell periphery have been described in sorghum plants responding to fungal infection (24Snyder B.A. Nicholson R.L. Science. 1990; 248: 1637-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and in maize cells induced to accumulate anthocyanins (25Grotewold E. Chamberlin M. Snook M. Siame B. Butler L. Swenson J. Maddock S. St. Clair G. Bowen B. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 721-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). This localization may occur via alternative secretory pathways not involving the Golgi (26Lin Y. Irani N.G. Grotewold E. BMC Plant Biol. 2003; 3: 10.11-10.12Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Flavonoids that regulate basipetal auxin transport in the root may also be moved across the cell in some manner because flavonoid enzymes have been localized to the opposite end of the cell from the auxin transport proteins, with which flavonoids are proposed to interact (27Saslowsky D. Winkel-Shirley B. Plant J. 2001; 27: 37-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A large proportion of flavonoids can even remain in the cytoplasm in some tissues; for example, interaction of flavonoids with cytoplasmic proteins has been proposed to contribute to yellow flower color in lisianthus (17Markham K.R. Gould K.S. Ryan K.G. Phytochemistry. 2001; 58: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Hutzler P. Rischbach R. Heller W. Jungblut T.P. Reuber S. Schmitz R. Veit M. Weissenbck G. Schmitzler J-P. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 953-965Crossref Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Several recent reports describe the accumulation of flavonoids in the nucleus in such diverse species as Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica napus, Flaveria chloraefolia, Picea abies, Tsuga canadensis, and Taxus baccata (18Hutzler P.

Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 536-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This is somewhat surprising because flavonoids are well known to bind to proteins and nucleic acids and could therefore interfere with essential biological processes (32Nijveldt R.J. van Nood E. van Hoorn D.E.

Phytochem. 1974; 8: 53-79Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although the physiological roles of flavonoids in plant cell nuclei are far from clear, it has been suggested that these compounds may serve to protect DNA from UV and oxidative damage (30Feucht W. Treutter D. Polster J. Plant Cell Rep. 2004; 22: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) or directly or indirectly control the transcription of genes required for growth and development including those encoding auxin transport proteins (23Kuras M. Stefanowska-Wronka M. Lynch J.M. Zobel A.M. Ann. Bot. 1999; 84: 135-143Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Buer C.S. Muday G.K.

The flavonoid biosynthetic machinery has, until now, been found exclusively in the cytoplasm, where it appears to be organized as a multienzyme complex both at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CHI, chalcone isomerase (EC 5.5.1.6); CHS, chalcone synthase (EC 2.3.1.74); CLSM, confocal laser scanning microcopy; DPBA, diphenylboric acid 2-aminoethyl ester; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MES, 2(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride; NLS, nuclear localization signal. and in as-yet-uncharacterized electron-dense particles (11Winkel B. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2004; 55: 85-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 12Winkel-Shirley B. Physiol. Plant. 1999; 107: 142-149Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 13Hrazdina G. Jensen R.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 241-267Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Although specific transport mechanisms control the distribution of flavonoids from the cytoplasm to sites of action in the vacuole and at the cell periphery, we now have evidence that flavonoids located in the nucleus may be synthesized in situ. These findings provide the first evidence that differential localization of a biosynthetic pathway may be used to direct the deposition of metabolites at diverse sites of action within the cell. Plant Material—The Landsberg erecta (La-er) ecotype was used as the wild type in all experiments. Seedlings were grown on the surface of agar medium containing Murashige and Skoog salts and sucrose under continuous white light (120 microeinsteins m–2 s–1) for 4 days at 21 °C as described previously (27Saslowsky D. Winkel-Shirley B. Plant J. 2001; 27: 37-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of Transgenic Arabidopsis Plants Expressing Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Fusion Proteins—The AtCHS and AtCHI coding regions (34Pelletier M.K. Shirley B.W. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) were amplified using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and primers that added NcoI sites for fusion to the 5′ end of mGFP5 and either BglII (AtCHS) or BamHI (AtCHI) sites for fusion to the 3′ end. The fragments were then inserted into the NcoI or BlgII site in pAVA393 (35von Arnim A.G. Deng X.W. Stacey M.G. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 221: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). For mGFP5-CHI, the resulting expression cassette, consisting of the double-enhanced CaMV 35S promoter, Tobacco Etch Virus translational leader, mGFP5-CHI coding region, and nopaline synthase terminator, was then excised using XmaI and SalI and subcloned into corresponding sites in pBIB-KAN (36Becker D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 203Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The corresponding region was also subcloned from the empty pAVA393 vector into pBIB-KAN to serve as a control for localization experiments. For the other three fusions, constructs in pAVA393 were digested with KpnI, filled in, digested with SacI, and then cloned into the SmaI and SacI sites in pCAMBIA3300 (Cambia, Canberra, Australia). The five constructs were used to transform Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 using a freeze-thaw method (37Chen H. Nelson R.S. Sherwood J.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16 (670): 664-668PubMed Google Scholar) and then introduced into Arabidopsis La-er plants using the floral dip method (38Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the constructs in pBIB-KAN, selection of transformants was on medium containing 0.5× Murashige-Skoog salts and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. For constructs in pCAMBIA3300, selection was carried out by spraying soil-grown plants at 10, 11, 12, and 16 days with a 1:10,000 dilution of glufosinate ammonium concentrate (Basta; AgrEvo Co.), 0.005% Silwet L-77 (Lehle) per the manufacturer's instructions. Immunolocalization, Flavonoid Staining, and Imaging—Methods were as described previously (27Saslowsky D. Winkel-Shirley B. Plant J. 2001; 27: 37-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for immunolocalization using affinity-purified rabbit anti-CHS and chicken anti-CHI antibody preparations, flavonoid staining with diphenylboric acid 2-aminoethyl ester (DPBA), and imaging by electron microscopy or confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). mGFP5 fluorescence was visualized using a LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) using a 1.2 numerical aperture 40× C-Apo water-immersion objective lens, 488 nm argon laser line, and 505–550 nm band pass filter. Nuclear Protein Preparations—Seedlings were immersed in liquid nitrogen in a pre-chilled ceramic mortar and ground with a pestle to a fine powder. The powder (~1.5 g) was transferred to a Dounce homogenizer (Kontes Glass) containing 10 ml of cold nuclei isolation buffer (10 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.3, 330 mmd-sorbitol, 0.1 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 6.3, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1× Protease Complete (-EDTA) protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The suspension was allowed to thaw on ice, and then 10 passes with a loose (0.16 mm) clearance and 10 passes with a tight (0.07 mm) clearance pestle were performed. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 380 × g for 6 min at 4 °C to sediment large cellular debris and then filtered through 75 μm NITEX nylon mesh (Precision Woven Screening Media, Briarcliff Manor, NY) to remove smaller cell fragments. The homogenate was centrifuged for 6 min at 4 °C once at 600 × g and then two more times at 700 × g, with the pellet being discarded between each step. This served to remove any large cell wall fragments as well as non-lysed cells as determined by light microscopy. Nuclei were pelleted at 2750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The remaining supernatant was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to produce the “lysed cell supernatant.” The nuclei-enriched pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of nuclei isolation buffer. To selectively lyse any remaining chloroplasts or mitochondria, 10% Triton X-100 was slowly added to a final concentration of 0.2%. After 5 min of incubation on ice, the suspension was centrifuged at 2750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was washed by resuspension in 3 ml of nuclei isolation buffer and centrifuged at 2750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. This produced a “nuclei-enriched pellet” with a volume of ~30 μl. Qualitative purity was gauged by resuspending this pellet in 200 μl of nuclei isolation buffer, counterstaining with 1 μg ml–1 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; Molecular Probes) for 10 min on ice, and visualizing by differential interference contrast and fluorescence light microscopy (Zeiss Axioskop 2 equipped with a standard DAPI filter set). Immunoblot Analysis—Samples were prepared for electrophoresis by suspending the nuclei-enriched pellet in 200 μl of 1× sample buffer (62.6 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 3.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mg ml–1 bromphenol blue, and 0.2 mg ml–1 pyronin Y) or combining 200 μl of the lysed cell supernatant with 100 μlof3× sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 15 min, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and then analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously (27Saslowsky D. Winkel-Shirley B. Plant J. 2001; 27: 37-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using affinity-purified rabbit anti-CHS at a 1:800 dilution, affinity-purified chicken anti-CHI at a 1:400 dilution, mouse anti-histone monoclonal antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) at a 1:700 dilution, or mouse anti-α-tubulin monoclonal DM1A and 611B1 (Sigma) at a 1:500 and 1:1000 dilution, respectively. Typical protein concentrations were 10 mg ml–1 for the nuclei-enriched samples and 3 mg ml–1 for the lysed cell supernatant as determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Localization of Flavonoid End Products—A number of fluorescence microscopy studies have provided evidence for the accumulation of flavonoids in the nuclei of diverse plant species, including Arabidopsis (18Hutzler P.

To confirm these findings in Arabidopsis seedlings under the growth conditions used in our laboratory, intact 4-day-old La-er plants were stained with the flavonoid-specific dye DPBA, which displays an emission intensity 1–2 orders of magnitude greater when bound to flavonols or dihydroflavonols than to other flavonoids (39Murphy A.

Optical sectioning by CLSM revealed intense staining in the elongation zone and root tip of wild-type seedlings (Fig. 1a), as previously reported (27Saslowsky D. Winkel-Shirley B. Plant J. 2001; 27: 37-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Murphy A. Peer W.A. Taiz L. Planta. 2000; 211: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and detected only autofluorescence in tt5(86) seedlings, which carry a mutation in the second enzyme of the flavonoid pathway (Fig. 1b) (41Shirley B.W. Hanley S. Goodman H.M. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 333-347PubMed Google Scholar). Optical sections through DPBA-stained wild-type epidermal (Fig. 1c) and cortex cells (Fig. 1d) showed fluorescence emanating from nuclei throughout the elongation zone and root tip. Fig. 1e illustrates, at higher magnification, DPBA fluorescence in nuclei as well as cell walls and/or plasmalemma and intracellular membranes, similar to previous reports (28Buer C.S. Muday G.K. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1191-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 31Peer W.A. Brown D.E. Tague B.W. Muday G.K. Taiz L. Murphy A.S. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 536-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). No obvious nuclear-specific fluorescence was observed in the hypocotyl/root transition zone, although this is likely to be masked by the high levels of endogenous fluorescence in this region (data not shown). It is not possible to distinguish fluorescence from kaempferol versus quercetin (520 and 543 nm emission, respectively) using CLSM; however, it was previously shown that there is a higher kaempferol/quercetin ratio in the elongation zone and root tip as compared with the hypocotyl/root transition zone (27Saslowsky D. Winkel-Shirley B. Plant J. 2001; 27: 37-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Peer W.A. Brown D.E. Tague B.W. Muday G.K. Taiz L. Murphy A.S. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 536-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). DPBA staining in the absence of 0.005% Triton X-100 yielded similar but less intense results, and no fluorescence was detected in this region in tt5(86) seedlings when imaged with the parameters used to acquire Fig. 1e (data not shown). It should also be noted that the optical thickness of the images shown in Fig. 1e is 1.5 μm, well below the ~10-μm diameter of nuclei in these cells; thus, the fluorescence is clearly intranuclear, not perinuclear. Immunolocalization of CHS and CHI in Root Cells—To determine whether a link could be established between the nuclear localization of flavonoid end products and the distribution of the flavonoid biosynthetic machinery, co-immunolocalization of CHS and CHI was performed. These enzymes catalyze the first and second committed reactions in the flavonoid pathway, respectively (for a schematic of the pathway, see Ref. 1Winkel-Shirley B. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (2567) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence CLSM with affinity-purified rabbit anti-CHS and chicken anti-CHI preparations (Fig. 2a) showed co-localization of these enzymes within nuclei of epidermal and cortex cells of the wild-type root tip, as well as in the cytoplasm as previously reported (27Saslowsky D. Winkel-Shirley B. Plant J. 2001; 27: 37-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As with DPBA staining (Fig. 1), the fluorescence emanated from within the nucleus and not from perinuclear ER. These signals were highly specific for CHS and CHI because no fluorescence was detected in CHS (tt4(UV118a)) or CHI (tt5(86)) mutants immunolabeled with anti-CHS or anti-CHI antibodies, respectively (27Saslowsky D. Winkel-Shirley B. Plant J. 2001; 27: 37-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The signals were also not due to bleed-through from the DAPI channel because no fluorescence was detected in the fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine channels for the nuclei of tt4(UV118a) control samples (Fig. 2b). Wild-type seedlings co-labeled with antibodies against CHI and the ER-resident protein BiP (an HSP70) showed that, unlike CHI, BiP is excluded from elongation zone nuclei and exhibits a subcellular distribution consistent with ER localization (Fig. 2c). Together, these results point to specific localization not only of flavonoid end products but also of at least part of the biosynthetic machinery to nuclei of root tip epidermal and cortex cells. To examine this phenomenon at higher resolution, immunotransmission electron microscopy was performed. Employing an indirect immunogold detection methodology, CHS and CHI were again found to co-localize within nuclei of root tip cells (Fig. 3). Although some of the cellular ultrastructure was sacrificed to favor epitope preservation, it is still possible to detect concentric sheets of perinuclear ER as well as the grainy, electron-dense nucleus. Consistent with the immunofluorescence experiments, labeling for both CHS and CHI was observed throughout the cytoplasm and also within the nucleus and at perinuclear ER. Once again, tt4(UV118a) and tt5(86) mutants failed to exhibit any labeling with affinity-purified anti-CHS or anti-CHI antibodies, respectively, and no labeling was observed in other organelles such as mitochondria (27Saslowsky D. Winkel-Shirley B. Plant J. 2001; 27: 37-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Vivo Localization of CHS and CHI—To examine the subcellular distribution of CHS and CHI in living seedlings, transgenic plants expressing these enzymes fused to the N or C terminus of mGFP5 were produced. Plants harboring a control construct expressing mGFP5 alone displayed fluorescence primarily in the cytoplasm of epidermal and cortex cells in the elongation zone and root tip (Fig. 4a). In contrast, fusion of CHI to the C terminus of mGFP5 (mGFP5-CHI) resulted in accumulation of high levels of GFP fluorescence in the nucleus in several independent lines (Fig. 4b). This was also observed in the epidermal cells of the cotyledon, in which localization to the both the ER and nuclei were clearly visible (Fig. 4c). Similar results were observed with a construct in which CHS was fused to the N terminus of mGFP5 (CHS-mGFP5) (Fig. 4d) and for lines expressing CHI-mGFP5 or mGFP5-CHS, although fluorescence was less intense (data not shown). The combined size of CHI and mGFP5 is 54 kDa, larger than what is believed to pass the nuclear pore complex by passive diffusion (42Keminer O. Peters R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 217-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), whereas for CHS and mGFP5, it is even larger (70 kDa). Therefore, this experiment provides further evidence that CHS and CHI are actively sequestered in nuclei of the root tip and elongation zone cells. Detection of CHS and CHI in Isolated Nuclei—As a biochemical complement to the fluorescence microscopy data, we enriched for nuclei from macerated seedlings and assessed the presence of CHS and CHI by immunoblot analysis. Although high levels of CHS and CHI protein were found in the crude cellular lysate, a substantial proportion of each enzyme co-purified with the enriched nuclear fraction (Fig. 5, top two panels). The nuclear marker protein histone H1 was detected exclusively in the nuclei-enriched fraction, whereas the cytosolic marker α-tubulin showed only a very small proportion co-fractionating with nuclei (Fig. 5, bottom two panels), much less than the amount seen for CHS and CHI. α-Tubulin served as a suitable “soluble” cytosolic protein marker for these experiments because most of the steps in the nuclear enrichment protocol were on ice or at 4 °C, conditions that depolymerize microtubules into tubulin monomers (71Moskalewski S. Thyberg J. Friberg U. Cell Tissue Res. 1980; 210: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Additionally, the centriole is comprised mainly of γ-tubulin, which is not immunoreactive with the monoclonal α-tubulin antibody used in this study. It is unlikely that the CHS and CHI in the nuclei-enriched fraction are due to contamination from other organelles or membrane fragments due to the detergent treatment step employed in these experiments, which serves to selectively lyse chloroplasts and mitochondria. It should be noted that this analysis is not quantitative because it is not possible to recover all nuclei (or all protein, for that matter) from intact organisms. Our finding that at least two of the enzymes of flavonoid metabolism are located not only in the cytoplasm but also in the nuclei of some cells, while surprising, is not without precedent. There are, in fact, a growing number of metabolic enzymes for which dual cytoplasmic/nuclear localization has been observed, both in plants and in other organisms. A number of these enzymes are proposed to have distinct functions in these two locations. For example, mammalian Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein controls actin polymerization at the cell periphery but acts as a transcriptional regulator in the nucleus (43Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42515-42523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In yeast, glucokinase has been shown move to the nucleus and alter gene expression in response to different environmental conditions (44Herrero P. Martinez-Campa C. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Mammalian phospholipid scramblase 1 has a postulated role in the redistribution of phospholipids at the plasma membrane and an undetermined function in the nucleus involving interaction with DNA (45Ben-Efraim I. Zhou Q. Wiedmer T. Gerace L. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3518-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similarly, the glycolytic enzymes phosphoglycerate kinase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase have been proposed to function as the primer recognition protein for DNA polymerase-α and as a uracil glycosylase, respectively, in plant and animal nuclei (46Bryant J.A. Brice D.C. Fitchett P.N. Anderson L.E. J. Exp. Bot. 2000; 51: 1945-1947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Wang X. Sirover M.A. Anderson L.E. Arch. Biochem.

Interestingly, both the cytoplasmic and plastid forms of pea phosphoglycerate kinase are found in the nucleus, indicating that dual distribution can also involve other organelles (50Anderson L.E.

https://openalex.org/W2082036925,"Smad4 mediates signaling by the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily of cytokines. Smad signaling is negatively regulated by inhibitory (I) Smads and ubiquitin-mediated processes. Known mechanisms of proteasomal degradation of Smads depend on the direct interaction of specific E3 ligases with Smads. Alternatively, I-Smads elicit degradation of the TGF-β receptor by recruiting the WW and HECT domain E3 ligases, Smurfs, WWP1, or NEDD4–2. We describe an equivalent mechanism of degradation of Smad4 by the above E3 ligases, via formation of ternary complexes between Smad4 and Smurfs, mediated by R-Smads (Smad2) or I-Smads (Smad6/7), acting as adaptors. Smurfs, which otherwise cannot directly bind to Smad4, mediated poly-ubiquitination of Smad4 in the presence of Smad6 or Smad7. Smad4 co-localized with Smad7 and Smurf1 primarily in the cytoplasm and in peripheral cell protrusions. Smad2 or Smad7 mutants defective in Smad4 interaction failed to induce Smurf1-mediated down-regulation of Smad4. A Smad4 mutant defective in Smad2 or Smad7 interaction could not be effectively down-regulated by Smurf1. We propose that Smad4 is targeted for degradation by multiple ubiquitin ligases that can simultaneously act on R-Smads and signaling receptors. Such mechanisms of down-regulation of TGF-β signaling may be critical for proper physiological response to this pathway.

Upon binding of TGF-β to cell surface complexes of type I and type II receptor serine/threonine kinases, the type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor, which further phosphorylates the receptor-regulated (R-) Smads, Smad2 and Smad3 (3Shi Y. Massagué J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4866) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated R-Smads oligomerize with the common mediator (Co) Smad4 and accumulate in the nucleus where they regulate gene expression. Alternatively, TGF-β signals via different intracellular effectors, including protein or lipid kinases and small GTPases (1Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar). A third class of Smad proteins, the inhibitory (I) Smads, Smad6 and Smad7, mediate negative control of TGF-β pathways (2Miyazono K. Suzuki H. Imamura T. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 3Shi Y. Massagué J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4866) Google Scholar). TGF-β family members induce nuclear Smad complexes that activate transcription of the Smad6 and Smad7 genes, thus creating a negative regulatory feedback loop. The best-documented mechanism of negative regulation of Smad proteins is via their proteasomal degradation after ubiquitination (2Miyazono K. Suzuki H. Imamura T. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 3Shi Y. Massagué J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4866) Google Scholar). Such mechanisms either maintain low steady-state Smad levels or alternatively lead to shutdown of the activated Smad pathway after proper nuclear signaling. The bone morphogenetic protein-specific R-Smads, Smad1 and Smad5, are targeted by the WW and HECT domain E3 ligase Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor (Smurf) 1, whereas Smad1 can also be ubiquitinated via carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) (4Li L.

Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The TGF-β-activated R-Smad, Smad2, can be ubiquitinated by the second Smurf family member, Smurf2 (9Lin X. Liang M. Feng X-H.

A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). A second WW-HECT domain E3 ligase, Tiul1/WWP1, forms complexes with Smad2 after TGF-β stimulation via the Smad2-interacting transcriptional co-repressor TGF-β-induced factor, and leads to Smad2 poly-ubiquitination and down-regulation of TGF-β signaling (11Seo S.R. Lallemand F. Ferrand N. Pessah M. L'Hoste S. Camonis J. Atfi A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3780-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Similar to WWP1, another E3 ligase that contains WW and HECT domains, NEDD4–2, interacts with Smad2 and induces its poly-ubiquitination and degradation (12Kuratomi G. Komuro A. Goto K. Shinozaki M. Miyazawa K. Miyazono K. Imamura T. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In contrast, Smad3 is down-regulated by the Roc1·SCF ubiquitin ligase complex (13Fukuchi M. Imamura T. Chiba T. Ebisawa T. Kawabata M. Tanaka K. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1431-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, Smurf-mediated down-regulation of the Smad pathway has also been observed (14Liang Y.Y. Lin X. Liang M.

Emerging evidence suggests that ubiquitination of Smad proteins could also serve alternative functions. The E3 ligase Itch induces Smad2 poly-ubiquitination, which then positively modulates phosphorylation of Smad2 by the TGF-β type I receptor (16Bai Y. Yang C. Hu K. Elly C. Liu Y-C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 825-831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This example increases the complexity of physiological effects Smad ubiquitination can offer to TGF-β superfamily signaling. Wild type Smad4 can be proteasomally degraded after poly-ubiquitination by the E3 ligase complexes of Jab1, SCFβ-TrCP1, or CHIP (4Li L. Xin H. Xu X. Huang M. Zhang X. Chen Y. Zhang S. Fu X.Y.

Both mono-ubiquitination and sumoylation of Smad4 lead to stabilization of the protein and enhanced TGF-β signaling. However, Smad4 sumoylation can also lead to inactivation of nuclear Smad signaling in a gene-specific manner (24Long J. Wang G. He D. Liu F. Biochem.

Ubiquitin-mediated regulation of TGF-β pathways becomes even more complex when one encounters the function of I-Smads (reviewed in Refs. 3Shi Y. Massagué J.

During the inhibitory feedback mechanism, I-Smads recruit the E3 ligases Smurf1, Smurf2, WWP1/Tiul1, or NEDD4–2 and bind to TGF-β receptor complexes leading to their degradation (11Seo S.R.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6914-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In zebrafish, the E3 ligase Dapper2 mediates lysosomal degradation of nodal receptors, although the contribution of I-Smads to this mechanism remains unexplored (38Zhang L. Zhou H. Su Y. Sun Z. Zhang H. Zhang Y. Ning Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Science. 2004; 306: 114-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). I-Smads can also recruit Smurf1 to bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the one hand, and to R-Smads, like Smad1 and Smad5, on the other hand, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation (39Murakami G. Watabe T. Takaoka K. Miyazono K. Imamura T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2809-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Thus, I-Smads play the role of adaptor proteins that bind directly to E3 ligases and mediate their association with substrates, i.e. receptors or R-Smads. The I-Smad level is not necessarily affected by the associating E3 ligase. However, under certain conditions, I-Smads can also be targeted for proteasomal degradation either by Smurfs themselves or by additional E3 ligases such as Arkadia or signalosome components such as Jab1/CSN5 (40Grönroos E.

In the present study, we examined the role of I-Smads as adaptors that mediate recruitment of Smurf E3 ligases to components of the TGF-β pathway to regulate their protein levels. We also analyzed effects of two additional E3 ligases, structurally and functionally related to Smurfs, WWP1 and NEDD4–2. We concentrated on the Co-Smad, Smad4, because this protein is known to make complexes with R-Smads but cannot directly interact with Smurf members. The study originated by observing that ectopic expression of I-Smads or Smurf1 could lead to dramatic down-regulation of Smad4. We therefore establish the formation of ternary complexes between Smad4, I-Smads and Smurfs, which result in poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Smad4. Thus, Smurf E3 ligases (but also WWP1 and NEDD4–2) can act at all levels of the TGF-β signaling pathway, mediating degradation of receptors, R-Smads, I-Smads, and of the unique Co-Smad, as established for the first time here. Cell Culture, Adenoviruses, Plasmids, and Antibodies—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 and HEK-293T cells were obtained and cultured according to protocols from the American Type Culture Collection. The human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT was a gift from N. Fusenig, Heidelberg. The adenoviral vector expressing human Smurf1 epitope-tagged with FLAG at its N terminus (AdX-Smurf1) was constructed using the BD Clontech Ad-X kit after subcloning of the FLAG-tagged cDNA of human Smurf1 from pcDNA3 to the adenoviral backbone vector using the manufacturer's protocol.

Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2 and M5) antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, mouse monoclonal anti-HA from Roche Applied Science, rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP from Molecular Probes, and mouse monoclonal anti-Smad4 from BD Transduction Laboratories.

Cell Transfections and Infections—Transient transfections of cells using calcium phosphate co-precipitation were performed as previously described (25Morén A. Hellman U. Inada Y. Imamura T.

Cells were transfected directly on plastic tissue culture dishes for biochemical assays or on glass coverslips coated with collagen (Vitrogel, Cohesion) for immunofluorescence assays. Cell monolayers were infected with the multiplicity of infection specified in the figure legends as described before (43Kurisaki K. Kurisaki A. Valcourt U. Terentiev A.A. Pardali K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Ericsson J. Moustakas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4494-4510Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and protein analysis was performed 24 h post-infection. Analysis of Smad4 Protein Expression—Transiently transfected, infected, or intact cell monolayers were lysed in solubilization buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After Bradford analysis of total protein levels, the lysates were adjusted prior to subsequent immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation. Endogenous Smad4 was directly immunoblotted using the mouse anti-Smad4 antibody. Transfected FLAG-tagged Smad4 was detected by direct immunoblotting of cell lysates with anti-FLAG M2 antibody. All immunoblotted proteins were detected by ECL. Ubiquitination Assays—HEK-293T cells were transfected with 6myc-Smad4 and HA-ubiquitin in the absence or presence of Smad6, Smad7, and Smurfs as explained in the figure legends. Forty-eight hours after transfection cells were lysed in solubilization buffer and sonicated for 5 s. Smad4 was immunoprecipitated with anti-myc (9E10); after four washes with solubilization buffer, the immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody for ubiquitin. Alternatively, cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA and immunoblotted with anti-myc (9E10). For Smad4 ubiquitination analysis after proteasomal inhibition, transfected HEK-293T cells were treated with 50 μm MG-132 inhibitor (Calbiochem) for 6 h. All control cell treatments included equal volumes of Me2SO, the solvent of MG-132. Smad4/I-Smad/Smurf Complex Formation Assays—Association of transfected FLAG- or 6myc- or GFP-Smad4, with FLAG-Smad2 and its phosphorylation mutant, FLAG-Smad6 and its deletion mutants, or FLAG-Smad7 and its deletion mutants and 6myc-Smurf1(CS) mutant, was monitored by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Transfected HEK-293T cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody as described above, prior to immunoblotting with anti-myc or anti-GFP antibodies and ECL detection. GST Pull-down—GST fusion proteins (2.5 ng) were mixed with a normalized amount of FLAG-tagged protein expressing cell lysates from transfected HEK-293T cells in solubilization buffer with protease inhibitors. Before washing, the GST beads were transferred into clean tubes, and the pull-down was washed three times in solubilization buffer and once in high salt buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100). Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG for Smad proteins. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Transiently transfected cell mono-layers at ∼70% confluency were analyzed by immunofluorescence 48 h post-transfection. Cells were processed with anti-FLAG (M2) or anti-myc (9E10) primary antibodies, followed by anti-mouse-tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) secondary antibody (DAKO) and 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining of nuclei, as described before (49Kowanetz M.

Smad4 Is Down-regulated by Smurf1 in the Presence of I- or R-Smads—We screened a number of known E3 ligases for their ability to induce down-regulation of wild type Smad4 after ectopic expression in transfected HEK-293T cells. 2A. Morén, T. Imamura, K. Miyazono, C.-H. Heldin, and A. Moustakas, unpublished results. Among the E3 ligases examined were the two members of the Smurf family, Smurf1 and Smurf2 (Fig. 1A). Smurfs have been previously shown to interact directly with both R-Smads and I-Smads (8Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H.

Cell. 2003; 14: 2809-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The interaction is mediated via specific proline-tyrosine (PPXY) motifs located in the linker domains of R-Smads and I-Smads. Such motifs are not present in the linker or other domains of Smad4 and thus preclude the direct interaction of Smad4 with the WW domains of Smurfs (35Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12477-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). However, because Smad4 forms heteromeric complexes with R-Smads after receptor phosphorylation, we reasoned that an R-Smad might mediate complex formation between Smurfs and Smad4. Alternatively, because the interactions between Smad proteins are mediated via their highly conserved C-terminal Mad homology (MH) 2 domains, we also reasoned that I-Smads, which also contain conserved MH2 domains, might mediate the Smurf-Smad4 interaction. Based on all these reasons, we co-transfected R-Smads or I-Smads together with Smurf1 or Smurf2 and scored for their effects on the protein levels of wild type Smad4. Fig. 1B shows that, although cotransfection of Smad7 alone did not alter the levels of wild type Smad4, and co-transfection of Smurf1 only weakly down-regulated wild type Smad4, the combination of these proteins induced a strong decrease in Smad4 levels. The same effect was observed when Smad2 was co-transfected with Smurf1, and the effect was even stronger when both Smad2 and Smad7 were co-expressed with Smurf1. Under these conditions of transient transfection we could always observe the previously established down-regulation of Smad7 or Smad2 by the co-expressed Smurf1 (Fig. 1B). Dose-response experiments showed that, with higher levels of Smad7 co-expressed with Smurf1, higher degrees of Smad4 down-regulation could be observed (Fig. 1C). We then asked whether stimulation of TGF-β signaling by co-expression of the point-mutated, constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor (activin receptor-like kinase-5(TD), ALK5(TD)) could influence the fate of Smad4. We could not measure any appreciable effect of ALK5(TD) co-expression on Smad4 levels either in the absence or presence of co-transfected Smurf1 (Fig. 1D). We also examined whether Smad6, the second I-Smad of the TGF-β superfamily pathways, could play similar roles as Smad7 with respect to the protein fate of Smad4. Indeed, although coexpression of Smad4 with Smad6 or Smad7 led to weak down-regulation of Smad4, we observed a dramatic down-regulation of Smad4 when Smurf1 was also expressed in the cells (Fig. 1E). Under these transfection conditions, the effect of Smad6 was stronger compared with the effect of Smad7, and both I-Smads were completely degraded when co-expressed with Smurf1. To confirm that the above effects of Smad7 and Smurf1 on transfected Smad4 could apply to the endogenous protein, we constructed an adenoviral vector expressing FLAG-tagged Smurf1 and also made use of another adenovirus expressing FLAG-tagged Smad7 (43Kurisaki K. Kurisaki A. Valcourt U. Terentiev A.A. Pardali K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Ericsson J. Moustakas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4494-4510Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Infection of human HaCaT keratinocytes with each adenoviral vector and immunoblotting for endogenous Smad4 revealed that the combination of Smurf1 together with Smad7 led to measurable down-regulation of Smad4, which correlated with an equivalent down-regulation of Smurf1, presumably due to its established proteasomal degradation (Fig. 2A). Infection with Smurf1 or Smad7 viruses alone, led to weak but detectable down-regulation of endogenous Smad4. The same result was obtained after infection of HEK-293T cells with different doses of each adenoviral vector and immunoblotting for endogenous Smad4 (Fig. 2B). The negati"

Current treatments for these diseases are not effective. In the present study we investigate the effect of thiadiazolidinone derivatives, which have been recently suggested to play a role in neurodegenerative disorders. We have found that thiadiazolidinones are potent neuroprotector compounds. Thiadiazolidinones inhibited inflammatory activation of cultured brain astrocytes and microglia by diminishing lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor α, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, and inducible cyclooxygenase type 2 expression. In addition, thiadiazolidinones inhibited tumor necrosis factor-α and nitric oxide production and, concomitantly, protected cortical neurons from cell death induced by the cell-free supernatant from activated microglia. The neuroprotective effects of thiadiazolidinones are completely inhibited by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ antagonist GW9662. In contrast the glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitor LiCl did not show any effect. These findings suggest that thiadiazolidinones potently attenuate lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation and reduces neuronal death by a mechanism dependent of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ activation.

Inflammatory activation of neuronal and glial cells is believed to contribute to cell death and damage during neurological disease. One of the hallmarks of neurodegenerative and inflammatory pathologies is the increased number of activated astrocytes and microglia in response to the pathological stimulus (1Sheng J.G. Mrak R.E.

Thiadiazolidinones (TDZDs) are small heterocyclic thiadiazolidinones, which were synthesized following a pathway that is based on the reactivity of N-alkyl-S-(N′-(chlorocarbonyl)amino) isothiocarbamoyl chlorides with isocyanates (9Ottman G.

TDZDs have been postulated that could be of potential therapeutic use for the treatment of Alzheimer disease and other important unmet pathologies as diabetes type II, cancer, and chronic inflammatory processes (12Dorronsoro I.

The somehow chemical structure-related derivatives to TDZDs, and recently FDA approved thiazolidinediones, such as rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, and troglitazone, are known agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) (16Lehmann J.M.

The PPARγ receptor subtype seems to play a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation. It has been recently shown that PPARγ ligands, including thiazolidinediones, have potent anti-inflammatory effects, such as the suppression of TNF-α and IL-1β, inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2) (19Jiang C.

Of relevance to central nervous system disease is that PPARγ agonists have been demonstrated to have similar anti-inflammatory effects on astrocytes and microglial cells (review in Ref. 26Kielian T. Drew P.D. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 71: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate a potent anti-inflammatory effect of two TDZD compounds, NP00111 and NP01138 (see Fig. 1), in primary cultures of cortical neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. Our results indicate that both compounds act broadly to inhibit the production of proinflammatory and neurotoxic products elaborated by LPS-stimulated astrocytes and microglial cells. Concomitantly, TDZDs also exert a neuroprotective effect in primary cultures of cortical neurons treated with cell-free supernatant from LPS-stimulated microglia. Our results suggest that the effects of TDZDs are dependent on PPARγ activation, as the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 abolished them. The capacity of TDZDs to suppress the expression of inflammatory cytokines and their protective action on neurons suggests that these agents may be of value in the treatment of Alzheimer disease or other inflammatory diseases. Primary Cell Cultures—Primary cortical neuronal cultures were prepared from the cerebral cortex of embryonic day 18 rats, according to published protocols (27Chowen J.A. Torres-Aleman I. Garcia-Segura L.M. Neuroendocrinology. 1992; 56: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After removal of the meninges, the cerebral cortex was dissected and dissociated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). After washing, cells were plated on poly-lysine (20 μg/ml; Sigma)- and gelatin (250 μg/ml; Sigma)-coated plates or coverslips, and the cultures were maintained in Neurobasal medium with B-27 supplements. In these conditions, the purity of the neuronal population was >98%, as determined by immunofluorescence analysis using anti-β-tubulin and anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 antibodies. All experiments were carried out with 7-day-old cultures. Astrocytes were prepared from neonatal (P2) rat cerebral cortex. Briefly, after removal of the meninges the cerebral cortex was dissected, dissociated, and incubated with 0.25% trypsin, EDTA at 37 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen), and the cells were plated on non-coated flasks and maintained in Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 15 days the flasks were agitated on an orbital shaker for 12 h at 250 rpm at 37 °C, and the non-adherent oligodendrocytes and microglial cells were removed. After 7 days the flasks were agitated again to remove any remaining microglia cells and then trypsinized and expanded at a 1:5 ratio in complete medium. In these conditions, the purity of the astrocytes population was >95%, as determined by immunofluorescence analysis using anti-OX-42 to detect microglial cells, anti-CNPase to detect oligodendrocyte contamination, and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein to identify astrocytes. Primary microglial cells were prepared from 15-day-old mixed glial cultures, as described above. Briefly, 15-day-old mixed glial cultures were agitated on an orbital shaker for 12 h at 250 rpm at 37 °C. The supernatant was collected, centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min, and the cellular pellet containing the microglial cells resuspended in HAMS/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and seeded at a density of 2–4 × 105 cells/cm2 on uncoated plates. Cells were allowed to adhere for 2 h, and the medium was removed to eliminate non-adherent oligodendrocytes, and new fresh medium containing 10 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was added. The purity of microglia obtained by this procedure was >98% as determined by immunofluorescence with the OX-42 antibody. Treatment of Glial and Neuronal Cultures—TDZDs (50 μm) were added to the culture medium 1 h before exposure to LPS (10 μg/ml), and cells were incubated for 24 h before tissue culture medium was collected, and the cells were evaluated for cytokine, iNOS, or COX-2 expression. In the case of neuronal cultures, conditioned medium from control and LPS-treated microglia was subsequently transferred to cortical neuron cell cultures, which were then incubated for an additional 24 h before cells were collected and assayed for neuronal apoptotic cell death and expression of cytokines. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal antibodies to β-tubulin, MAP2, and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein were from Sigma. Mouse anti-OX-42 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Serotec (Duseldorf, Germany). Monoclonal anti-CNPase was from Sternberger (Baltimore, MD), and polyclonal anti-IL-6, anti-TNF-α, anti-COX-2, and anti-iNOS antibodies were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, CA). Immunocytochemistry—Neurons were stained with an antibody against β-tubulin, a marker for microtubules. Microglia were visualized by staining for the CR3 complement receptor with monoclonal antibody OX-42, and astrocytes were stained with an antibody against anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein, an intermediate filament protein whose synthesis is restricted to astrocytes. At the end of the treatment period the cultures, grown on glass coverslips in 24-well cell culture plates, were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde at 25 °C, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 37 °C. After a 1-h incubation with the corresponding primary antibody, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with an Alexa-labeled secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) for 45 min at 37 °C. Subcellular localization was determined using a TCS SP2 laser scanning spectral confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems). The images were obtained using a series of 0.5 μm (depth)-spaced cell fluorescent slices (z axis). A quantitative analysis of labeled cells was undertaken using the image analySIS software (Soft Imaging System Corp., Münster, Germany). Areas to be counted were traced at low power, and at least three different counting fields were selected at random. Measurement of Apoptosis—To calculate the extent of apoptotic cell death, cortical neuronal cultures were treated or not with NP00111 or NP01138, incubated with glutamate (100 μm), staurosporine (50 nm), or cell-free supernatant from LPS-stimulated microglia, and phosphatidylserine exposure on the surface of apoptotic cells was detected by confocal microscopy after staining with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria). TNF-α Assay—TNF-α secreted in astrocytes and microglial cultures was measured by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using rat monoclonal anti-rat TNF-α antibody as the capture antibody and horseradish peroxidase polyclonal anti-rat TNF-α as the detection antibody (R&D Systems). Nitrite Determinations—The production of NO was monitored by measuring the content of nitrite, one of the end products of NO oxidation, by a procedure based on the diazotidation of nitrite by sulfanilic acid (Griess reaction). Twenty-four hours after the incubation of astrocytes and microglia cells with LPS or neuronal cultures with conditioned medium from LPS-treated microglia, in the absence or presence of TDZDs, 50 μl of sample aliquots were mixed with 50 μl of Griess reagent in 96-well plates and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. The absorbance at 550 nm was measured on a microplate reader. Transient Transfections—Murine hippocampal neuronal cell line HT22 was propagated and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 40 μg/ml gentamicin, and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Semiconfluent cultures were transfected with the reporter plasmid pPPRE-tk-luc, containing three PPARγ consensus binding sites upstream of a minimal promoter, together with PPARγ and RXRα expression vectors, using Transfast (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Typically, cells received 0.2 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.2 μg of PPARγ, and 50 ng of RXRα and were harvested 24 h after treatment with rosiglitazone (30 μm), NP00111 (50 μm), NP01138 (50 μm), and/or 9-cis retinoic acid (9-cis-RA, 1 μm), for determination of luciferase and β-galactosidase (to determine transfection efficiency) activities. Each transient transfection experiment was repeated at least three times in triplicate. Statistical Determinations—The data shown are the means ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. Statistical comparisons for significance between cells with different treatments were performed using the Student's t test, with p ≤ 0.05. NP00111 and NP01138 Inhibit Inflammatory Activation of Cultured Glial Cells—The potential anti-inflammatory activity of TDZDs was first tested by evaluating the production of inflammatory mediators from cultured astrocytes and microglial cells. First, we performed a dose-response curve of nitrite production (an indirect quantification of NO generation) by astrocytes and microglia cells. Astrocytes and microglia were incubated with different concentrations of TDZDs for 1 h, and then cells were cultured for another 24 h with LPS. As shown in Fig. 2, NP00111 and NP01138 dose dependently inhibited the production of nitrite (Fig. 2A) and the expression of COX-2 (Fig. 2B) induced by LPS stimulation. The effects of TDZDs were not caused by a loss of cell viability, as the 24-h exposure of astrocytes and microglial cells to NP00111 or NP01138 did not significantly alter cell viability (data not shown). The suppressive effects of both TDZDs were stronger at higher concentrations (50 μm), and, therefore, we used this concentration henceforth. We then analyzed more thoroughly the effects of TDZDs on LPS-stimulated primary cultures of astrocytes. When primary astrocytes were stimulated with LPS we observed once more a significant induction of nitrite production and also of TNF-α levels in the culture medium (2.0- and 4.0-fold, respectively), which was totally inhibited by NP00111 and NP01138 treatment (Fig. 3A). To further study the inhibitory effect of NP00111 and NP01138 on astrocyte activation, we next examined whether these compounds affected the LPS-induced intracellular accumulation of TNF-α and IL-6 (another proinflammatory cytokine). In addition, we also studied the accumulation of inducible COX-2 and iNOS. The enzyme iNOS is responsible for the generation of NO (28Lee P. Lee J. Kim S. Lee M.S. Yagita H. Kim S.Y. Kim H. Suk K. Brain. Res. 2001; 892: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and overexpression of COX-2 in activated microglia and astrocytes appears central to many neuroinflammatory conditions. We studied this by immunofluorescence analysis followed by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, the protein levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were clearly increased after LPS treatment of astrocytes, and treatment of the cultures with NP00111 or NP01138 completely abrogated this effect. In addition, in basal conditions, COX-2 and iNOS protein levels were barely detectable in astrocyte cultures, and their content was significantly induced after LPS treatment. The addition of NP00111 and NP01138 drastically inhibited LPS-induced COX-2 and iNOS expression. A similar cellular density is present in all microphotographs, as assessed by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with LPS-activated microglia. Microglia cultures treated with LPS showed an increase in the secreted levels of nitrite and TNF-α (3.0- and 4.2-fold respectively, compared with basal levels) (Fig. 4A), and, again, a complete inhibition in nitrite and TNF-α levels was observed in microglia cultures treated with either NP00111 or NP01138. Also, addition of TDZD compounds to the culture medium of microglial cells strongly inhibited the LPS-induced expression of the two cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α, as well as COX-2 and iNOS intracellular levels (Fig. 4, B and C). A similar cellular density is present in all microphotographs, as assessed by DAPI staining (data not shown). Altogether these results suggest that NP00111 and NP01138 inhibit inflammatory activation of cultured glial cells. NP00111 and NP01138 Protect from Inflammation-induced Neurodegeneration—We next investigated the effect of NP00111 and NP01138 on neuronal cell death induced by cell-free supernatant from LPS-stimulated microglia (SP). Rat embryonic cortical neurons were stimulated with supernatant from LPS-activated microglia in the presence or absence of TDZD compounds. The treatment of cultures with cell-free supernatants from LPS-stimulated microglia resulted in a significant induction in the number of Annexin V-positive cells compared with the control cultures (Fig. 5). The addition of NP00111 or NP01138 to neuronal cultures treated with conditioned medium from LPS-activated microglial cells suppressed neuronal cell death, suggesting that TDZDs could mediate their neuroprotective effects by blocking the effects of activated microglial-derived cytotoxic factors. Neurodegeneration induced by conditioned medium from LPS-activated microglia was associated with an increase in neuronal expression of TNF-α, IL-6, iNOS, and COX-2 (Fig. 6, A and B) in a manner similar to the one observed in glial cells treated with LPS. In addition, as observed in astrocytes and microglia, the TDZD compounds NP00111 and NP01138 completely blocked the induction of these genes in neuronal cultures. A similar cellular density is present in all microphotographs, as assessed by DAPI staining (data not shown). In line with these results, and as shown for glial cells, the release of nitrite to the culture medium was significantly increase after incubation of the neurons with supernatant from LPS-activated microglia (1.9-fold compared with basal values), and this increase was completely abolished in cultures treated with both TDZDs (Fig. 6C). NP00111 and NP01138 Protect Neurons from Apoptotic and Excitotoxic Stress—We next analyzed whether the neurodegeneration induced by other insults could also be prevented by TDZD compounds. To this end, we treated cortical neurons with 50 nm staurosporine (apoptotic stimulus) or 100 μm glutamate (excitotoxic insult) and determined apoptosis by Annexin V staining. As shown in Fig. 7, both stimuli elicited an induction in the number of apoptotic cells, similar to those found when an inflammatory stimulus was used. The addition of NP00111 or NP01138 protected neuronal cultures from both staurosporine-induced apoptosis and glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. These observations indicate that the protective role of the TDZDs is not restricted to a specific insult. Dependence of TDZDs Effects on PPARγ Activation—The structural similarities between NP00111 and NP01138 and the antidiabetic thiazolidinediones, such as rosiglitazone (Fig. 1) prompted us to analyze a possible involvement of the nuclear receptor PPARγ in the actions of these compounds. Thiazolidinediones are known ligands of PPARγ (16Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar), whose activation has been shown to play a key role in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation (29Klappacher G.W. Glass C.K. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2002; 13: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37731-37734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). This fact suggests the possibility that PPARγ activation could be involved in the mediation of the effects of these TDZDs in neural cells. We first tested this hypothesis in transient transfection experiments by using a reporter construct containing three consensus PPARγ response elements (pPPRE-tk-luc). As a positive control we used rosiglitazone, a well known high affinity ligand of PPARγ. In HT22 cells transfected with pPPRE-tk-luc and expression vectors for PPARγ and its partner RXRα, a significant stimulation of luciferase activity was observed after treatment with NP00111 and NP01138 (Fig. 8). This increase was similar or even higher (in the case of NP01138) to the one observed for rosiglitazone. These results demonstrate that these compounds are able to activate a reporter construct containing PPARγ consensus response elements. It has been shown that the PPARγ receptor activates transcription acting as a permissive PPARγ/RXR heterodimer (review in Ref. 31Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). This kind of nuclear receptor heterodimers can be activated by ligands of either RXR or its partner receptor and are synergistically activated in the presence of both ligands. Therefore, we next analyzed the response of the PPRE construct to the RXR ligand 9-cis-RA alone or in combination with rosiglitazone, NP00111, or NP01138. Fig. 8 shows that treatment of HT22 cells with 9-cis-RA resulted in a significant increase (1.5-fold) in promoter activity. Moreover, when the cells were incubated with 9-cis-RA together with rosiglitazone, NP00111, or NP01138, a larger activation of the PPRE reporter construct was observed. These data further suggest that the effects of the TDZDs could be mediated by activation of PPARγ. In view of the data shown above, we next analyzed whether activation of PPARγ is involved in the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of the TDZDs. Because TDZDs have also been described as GSK-3β inhibitors and it has been postulated that could be of potential therapeutic use for the treatment of Alzheimer disease, we also tested the effect of LiCl, an inhibitor of GSK-3β, on neuronal cell death induced by conditioned medium form activated microglia and proinflammatory activity. To this end, neuronal cultures were pretreated with the selective PPARγ antagonist GW9662 (32Giri S. Rattan R. Singh A.K. Singh I. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5196-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 33Varley C.L. Stahlschmidt J. Lee W.C. Holder J. Diggle C. Selby P.J. Trejdosiewicz L.K. Southgate J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 34Zhang C. Baker D.L. Yasuda S. Makarova N. Balazs L. Johnson L.R. Marathe G.K. McIntyre T.M. Xu Y. Prestwich G.D. Byun H.S. Bittman R. Tigyi G. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) before exposure to NP00111 and NP01138 and the cell-free supernatant from LPS-activated microglia. Other neuronal cultures were pretreated with LiCl prior to stimulation with the conditioned media. As shown in Fig. 9, A and B, GW9662 suppressed both, the blocking effect of TDZDs on COX-2 induction and their neuroprotective effects in cultures of cortical neurons. Treatment of neuronal cultures with the GSK-3β inhibitor LiCl (Fig. 9, B and C) did not have any effect upon the increase in Annexin V-positive cells elicited by treatment with conditioned medium from microglia. The induction in COX-2 levels was also not altered by incubation of neuronal cultures with LiCl. These results suggest an involvement of the nuclear receptor PPARγ in the neuroprotective action of both compounds. Finally, we analyzed whether the action of NP00111 and NP01138 on glial cells was also dependent on PPARγ activation. Astrocytes and microglia cultures were then treated with GW9662 or LiCl, and nitrite production was measured after LPS stimulation. As can be seen in Fig. 10, the nitrite levels in the culture medium of astrocytes and microglia stimulated with LPS were very similar to those found in control cultures. On the other hand, incubation of these cultures with the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 significantly blocked the inhibitory effect of both TDZDs on nitrite production after LPS stimulation. These data strongly suggest that NP00111 and NP01138 are acting through activation of the PPARγ receptor and not through their inhibition of GSK-3β activity. In the present work, we have demonstrated that NP00111 and NP01138, two thiadiazolidinone compounds, suppress inflammatory activation of astrocytes and microglia in vitro and protect cortical neurons from cell death and that these effects could be mediated by a mechanism apparently dependent on PPARγ activation. Inflammation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of several brain disorders and neural injury (35Barone F.C. Feuerstein G.Z. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1999; 19: 819-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) and develops as a consequence of activation of astrocytes and microglial cells (36del Zoppo G. Ginis I. Hallenbeck J.M. Iadecola C. Wang X. Feuerstein G.Z. Brain Pathol. 2000; 10: 95-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Inflammatory cells generate potentially damaging nitric oxide, oxygen free radicals, proteases, arachidonic acid derivatives, and cytokines, which could be mediators of the so-called secondary damage (35Barone F.C. Feuerstein G.Z. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1999; 19: 819-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Augmented activation of microglia and increased levels of inflammatory compounds have been localized at the sites of neurodegeneration in several disorders like Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis, AIDS-associated dementia, and posttraumatic lesions. Stimulated astrocytes are also an important cellular source of inflammatory mediators in the central nervous system, and the proliferation of astrocytes is frequently observed after brain injury (37Aschner M. Neurotoxicology. 1998; 19: 269-281PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that NP00111 and NP01138 are strongly anti-inflammatory against LPS-induced responses in rat primary astrocytes and microglia. Our results demonstrate that NP00111 and NP01138 inhibit NO production and TNF-α release from LPS-activated astrocyte and microglia cultures. In addition, these TDZDs completely blocked intracellular accumulation of cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, and the expression of iNOS and the proinflammatory gene COX-2, in response to LPS. Hence, these results suggest that these compounds could be of therapeutic value in those brain diseases and brain damage where inflammation processes are involved. We have also shown that NP00111 and NP01138 not only prevent the inflammatory response by glial cells but also have a neuroprotective activity in primary cortical neurons. These compounds protect cortical neurons from apoptosis induced by cell-free medium from LPS-activated microglial cultures. In addition, TDZDs protected cortical neurons against staurosporine-induced apoptosis and glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, suggesting that these compounds are potent neuroprotective agents against a wide variety of neuronal insults. Neuroprotection by TDZDs was coincident with a decrease in cytokine, COX-2, and iNOS expression and NO production. Accumulating data indicate that, in addition to glial cells, neurons can express iNOS (38Heneka M.T. Loschmann P.A. Gleichmann M. Weller M. Schulz J.B. Wullner U. Klockgether T. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 39Minc-Golomb D. Yadid G. Tsarfaty I. Resau J.H. Schwartz J.P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1504-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 40Sato I. Kim Y. Himi T. Murota S. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 184: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whose production of NO can be neurotoxic (41Dawson V.L. Brahmbhatt H.P. Mong J.A. Dawson T.M. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1425-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 42Skaper S.D. Facci L. Leon A. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although a role for COX-2 in healthy cells is not clear, under pathological conditions, the induction of COX-2 in neurons has been well demonstrated, and this induction correlates with apoptosis. COX-2 is rapidly induced in hippocampal and cortical neurons following an electroconvulsive seizure (43Yamagata K. Andreasson K.I. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1993; 11: 371-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). COX-2 is also induced in models of cerebral ischemia, and there is a direct correlation between the extent of COX-2 mRNA induction and the severity of subsequent tissue damage (44Collaco-Moraes Y. Aspey B. Harrison M. de Belleroche J. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1996; 16: 1366-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). TDZDs were first described as GSK-3β inhibitors and were postulated that could be of potential therapeutic use for the treatment of Alzheimer disease and other important unmet pathologies as diabetes type II, cancer, and chronic inflammatory processes (12Dorronsoro I. Castro A. Martinez A. Exp. Opin. Ther. Pat. 2002; 12: 1539-1544Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). So far, in vivo studies have been only performed using the tet/GSK-3β transgenic model (45Lucas J.J. Hernandez F. Gomez-Ramos P. Moran M.A. Hen R. Avila J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) confirming the potential role of TDZDs as therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer disease. However, the results presented here indicate that the effects of two TDZDs, the NP00111 and NP01138 compounds, on neuroprotection and inhibition of glial activation by LPS stimulation are mediated by activation of the PPARγ nuclear receptor. In fact, we show that NP00111 and NP01138 can activate a reporter construct containing consensus PPARγ binding sites and that this activation is further enhanced by 9-cis-RA, a behavior characteristic of a classical PPARγ/RXR permissive heterodimer. Moreover, the neuroprotective effects of these TDZDs are suppressed by GW9662, a specific antagonist of PPARγ. Altogether, these results suggest that the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of NP00111 and NP01138 could be mediated through PPARγ activation. In line with these observations, there are a number of reports showing inhibitory effects of different PPARγ ligands on the production of microglia-derived proinflammatory factors (review in Ref. 26Kielian T. Drew P.D. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 71: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Petrova et al. (46Petrova T.V. Akama K.T. Van Eldik L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4668-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) were the first to report that 15-deoxy-Δ-12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15dPG-J2), a potent ligand of PPARγ, strongly inhibited LPS-induced iNOS and subsequent NO production in the mouse microglial cell line BV-2. Subsequent studies by Bernardo et al. (22Bernardo A. Levi G. Minghetti L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) demonstrated that 15dPG-J2 and ciclitazone attenuated TNF-α and NO production in primary cultures of microglia stimulated with LPS. It has been also revealed that a variety of PPARγ agonists, including the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indomethacin and ibuprofen, the thiazolidinediones troglitazone and ciclitazone, and 15dPG-J2, inhibited β-amyloid stimulation of neurotoxic molecules by microglia. However, and in contrast with the results presented here, the direct application of these agonists to cortical neurons did not significantly improved neuron survival, indicating that the agonists indirectly protect neurons through effects on microglia (47Combs C.K. Johnson D.E. Karlo J.C. Cannady S.B. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 558-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, and in agreement with our results, a direct neuroprotective effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and 15dPG-J2 has also been shown in cerebellar granule neurons (48Uryu S. Harada J. Hisamoto M. Oda T. Brain Res. 2002; 924: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Lastly, there is in vivo evidence suggesting that 15dPG-J2 and pioglitazone can reduce the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (49Diab A. Deng C. Smith J.D. Hussain R.Z. Phanavanh B. Lovett-Racke A.E. Drew P.D. Racke M.K. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2508-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 50Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Gavrilyuk V. Brosnan C.F. Whitacre C.C.

Our results extend these studies and present new potential ligands of PPARγ as robust agents against neural injury. Collectively, our results indicate that TDZDs can be very effective neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory compounds in neuronal cells through, at least in part, activation of the nuclear receptor PPARγ. Our study suggests possible therapeutic uses of TDZDs in certain brain disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson, and Alzheimer diseases, where inflammatory responses play a major role."
https://openalex.org/W1995453538,"Transgenic and gene knock-out studies demonstrated that the mouse Forkhead Box m1 (Foxm1 or Foxm1b) transcription factor (previously called HFH-11B, Trident, Win, or MPP2) is essential for hepatocyte entry into mitosis during liver development, regeneration, and liver cancer. Targeted deletion of Foxm1 gene in mice produces an embryonic lethal phenotype due to severe abnormalities in the development of liver and heart. In this study, we show for the first time that <i>Foxm1</i><sup>–/–</sup> lungs exhibit severe hypertrophy of arteriolar smooth muscle cells and defects in the formation of peripheral pulmonary capillaries as evidenced by significant reduction in platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 staining of the distal lung. Consistent with these findings, significant reduction in proliferation of the embryonic <i>Foxm1</i><sup>–/–</sup> lung mesenchyme was found, yet proliferation levels were normal in the Foxm1-deficient epithelial cells. Severe abnormalities of the lung vasculature in <i>Foxm1</i><sup>–/–</sup> embryos were associated with diminished expression of the transforming growth factor β receptor II, a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 17 (ADAM-17), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, Polo-like kinase 1, Aurora B kinase, laminin α4 (Lama4), and the Forkhead Box f1 transcription factor. Cotransfection studies demonstrated that Foxm1 stimulates transcription of the Lama4 promoter, and this stimulation requires the Foxm1 binding sites located between –1174 and –1145 bp of the mouse Lama4 promoter. In summary, development of mouse lungs depends on the Foxm1 transcription factor, which regulates expression of genes essential for mesenchyme proliferation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and vasculogenesis."

Here we have investigated the roles of lesion bypass DNA polymerases polκ and polη in the BPDE-induced S-phase checkpoint. BPDE treatment induced the re-localization of an ectopically expressed green fluorescent protein-polκ fusion protein to nuclear foci containing sites of active DNA synthesis in human lung carcinoma H1299 cells. In contrast, a similarly expressed yellow fluorescent protein-polη fusion protein showed a constitutive nuclear focal distribution at replication forks (in the same cells) that was unchanged in response to BPDE. BPDE-induced formation of green fluorescent protein-polκ nuclear foci was temporally coincident with checkpoint-mediated S-phase arrest. Unlike “wild-type” cells, Polk-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) failed to recover from BPDE-induced S-phase arrest, while exhibiting normal recovery from S-phase arrest induced by ionizing radiation and hydroxyurea. XPV fibroblasts lacking polη showed a normal S-phase checkpoint response to BPDE (but failed to recover from the UV light-induced S-phase checkpoint), in sharp contrast to Polk-/- MEFs. The persistent S-phase arrest in BPDE-treated Polk-/- cells was associated with increased levels of histone γH2AX (a marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)) and activation of the DSB-responsive kinases ATM and Chk2. These data suggest that in the absence of polκ, replication forks stall at sites of damage and collapse and generate DSBs. Therefore, we conclude that the trans-lesion synthesis enzyme polκ is specifically required for normal recovery from the BPDE-induced S-phase checkpoint.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) 1The abbreviations used are: B[a]P, benzo[a]pyrene; BPDE, benzo-[a]pyrene-dihydrodiol epoxide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; MEFs, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; pol, polymerase; DSB, double-strand break; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; RFC, replication factor C; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; HDFs, human dermal fibroblasts; TLS, trans-lesion synthesis; XPV, xeroderma pigmentosum-variant; CMV, cytomegalovirus; WT, wild type. are ubiquitous environmental pollutants that elicit DNA damage, mutagenesis, and carcinogenesis (1Baum E.J. Gelboin H.V. Polycyclic Hydrocarbons and Cancer: Environment, Chemistry and Metabolism. Academic Press, New York1978: 45-70Google Scholar). The mechanism of B[a]P-induced carcinogenesis has been studied extensively and is well understood (4Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). B[a]P and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons undergo intracellular oxidation reactions that generate reactive metabolites such as B[a]P-dihydrodiol epoxide (BPDE). BPDE is the “ultimate carcinogen” that results from B[a]P metabolism and forms a covalent linkage mainly with the exocyclic amino group of deoxyguanosine to form a bulky hydrophobic adduct (5Falck J. Petrini J.H. Williams B.R. Lukas J. Bartek J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Error-prone replication of adducted DNA templates during S-phase can generate mutations. Potentially, mutations that activate oncogenes or inactivate tumor-suppressor genes can contribute to multistep carcinogenesis (2Hemminki K. Koskinen M. Rajaniemi H. Zhao C. Regul. Toxicol. Pharmacol. 2000; 32: 264-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 3Hemminki K. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2007-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA is continuously exposed to genotoxic insults from both endogenous and exogenous sources. Therefore, cells have evolved various mechanisms to minimize the detrimental effects of DNA damage. Cell cycle checkpoints are signal transduction mechanisms that respond to DNA damage by exerting negative controls over cell cycle progression (4Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). The cell cycle delays triggered by checkpoints enable integration of DNA repair with cell cycle progression following acquisition of DNA damage. Cell cycle checkpoint pathways can arrest cells at the G1/S transition, within S-phase (termed the “S-phase checkpoint” or “intra-S-phase checkpoint”), and at G2/M. It is widely hypothesized that cell cycle checkpoints are important tumor-suppressive mechanisms that contribute to the maintenance of genomic stability. Consistent with this hypothesis, individuals with congenital defects in checkpoint genes (e.g. p53, CHK2, and ATM) show increased propensity to tumorigenesis. Many components of cell cycle checkpoint signaling cascades have been identified. It is now clear that partially separable checkpoint pathways respond to different forms of DNA damage. For example, DNA double strand breaks (DSB) activate the proximal ATM kinase that signals through the downstream kinase Chk2 and other effectors (5Falck J. Petrini J.H. Williams B.R. Lukas J. Bartek J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In contrast, bulky DNA lesions (such as UV light-induced pyrimidine dimers or BPDE adducts) or replication stress (resulting from depletion of nucleotide pools) elicits a checkpoint pathway mediated by the ATM-related kinase ATR and its downstream effector kinase Chk1 (6Chen Y. Sanchez Y. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which DNA damage activates ATM is poorly understood but might involve direct interactions between ATM and damaged chromatin (7Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). In contrast, activation of ATR involves its recruitment to RPA-coated single-stranded DNA via the ATR-interacting protein ATRIP (also known as Rad26) (8Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 9Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar). Additional key mammalian DNA damage-response factors required for Chk1 activation are Rad17 and Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (which form a heterotrimeric complex termed “9-1-1”) (10Rauen M. Burtelow M.A. Dufault V.M. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29767-29771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Roos-Mattjus P. Vroman B.T. Burtelow M.A. Rauen M. Eapen A.K. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43809-43812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Rad17 resembles the replication factor C (RFC) I subunit and similarly forms a complex with RFC subunits II–V. The RFC I–V complex is responsible for loading the PCNA sliding clamp onto DNA during the elongation step of DNA synthesis. Each of the 9-1-1 subunits bears similarity with PCNA, and analogously, the 9-1-1 complex is thought to form a “clamp” that associates with DNA (12Parrilla-Castellar E.R. Arlander S.J. Karnitz L. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The association of 9-1-1 with damaged DNA is regulated by the concerted actions of Rad17 and RFC subunits II–V (12Parrilla-Castellar E.R. Arlander S.J. Karnitz L. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Although 9-1-1 and ATR/ATRIP are recruited to chromatin via separate mechanisms (13Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), both events are required for Chk1 activation and checkpoint signaling. When activated, Chk1 contributes to cell cycle arrest in S-phase and G2/M. The Chk1-mediated G2 arrest is mediated via negative regulation of the Cdc25C protein phosphatase (14Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Chk1-mediated S-phase arrest is less clear but might involve degradation of the Cdc25A protein phosphatase (15Mailand N. Falck J. Lukas C. Syljuasen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 16Sorensen C.S. Syljuasen R.G. Falck J. Schroeder T. Ronnstrand L. Khanna K.K. Zhou B.B. Bartek J. Lukas J.

Gottesman M. Gautier J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). S-phase checkpoints are considered to be important for coordinating DNA synthesis with DNA repair after acquisition of DNA damage during S-phase (18Bartek J. Lukas C. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 792-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Replicative DNA polymerases do not copy damaged DNA templates efficiently or accurately. Therefore, cells use the following two mechanisms to replicate loci containing DNA damage: 1) recombinational repair using the undamaged sister chromatid DNA as a template for the sequence opposite the lesion; 2) specialized DNA polymerases can be used to replicate past lesions in a process termed trans-lesion synthesis (TLS). Recombinational repair is an error-free mechanism (19Cox M.M. Mutat. Res. 2002; 510: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In contrast, because of the low fidelity of TLS DNA polymerases, replicative bypass of lesions is an inherently error-prone process (21Kunz B.A. Straffon A.F. Vonarx E.J. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Baynton K. Fuchs R.P. Trends Biochem.

Nohmi T. Prakash L. Prakash S. Todo T. Walker G.C. Wang Z. Woodgate R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 7-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Indeed, TLS is considered to be the reason for mutagenesis and carcinogenesis in response to DNA lesions. Major TLS DNA polymerases in mammalian cells are polκ, polη, polι, and Rev1 (the “Y” family polymerases) and polζ (a “B” family polymerase comprising the catalytic Rev3 subunit and the noncatalytic Rev7 protein). polη was the first mammalian TLS polymerase identified (24Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N. Yokoi M. Yuasa M. Araki M. Iwai S. Takio K. Hanaoka F. Nature. 1999; 399: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). polη is encoded by the XPV gene, which is defective in xeroderma pigmentosum-variant patients. The role of mammalian polη (and of its Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue Rad30) in TLS has been studied extensively. polη is unique among eukaryotic DNA polymerases in its ability to replicate through a cis-syn thymine-thymine dimer (the species generated by UV radiation). Studies in vitro and in vivo, in yeast and mammalian systems, indicate that polη promotes error-free DNA trans-lesion synthesis in a manner that is stimulated by PCNA and regulated by the Rad6/Rad18 epitasis pathways (25Kannouche P.L. Wing J. Lehmann A.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 26Watanabe K. Tateishi S. Kawasuji M. Tsurimoto T. Inoue H. Yamaizumi M. EMBO. J. 2004; 23: 3886-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Genes encoding the Y family enzyme DNA polymerase κ (polκ) were originally identified as human and murine homologues of Escherichia coli DinB (now termed polIV) (27Ogi T. Kato T.J. Kato T. Ohmori H. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Unlike human polη, human polκ and E. coli polIV are unable to bypass UV light-induced DNA lesions. However, both polκ and polIV are able to bypass benzo[a]pyrene-adducted guanine, efficiently inserting the correct “C” opposite the bulky lesion (28Ohmori H. Ohashi E. Ogi T. Adv. Protein Chem. 2004; 69: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for polκ in cellular responses to B[a]P-induced genotoxicity, polκ-deficient mutant mouse embryonic stem cells are highly sensitive to B[a]P, showing an elevated mutation frequency and its spectrum different from that in the parental cell (29Ogi T. Shinkai Y. Tanaka K. Ohmori H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15548-15553Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Bergoglio et al. (30Bergoglio V. Bavoux C. Verbiest V. Hoffmann J.S. Cazaux C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4413-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) reported that hydroxyurea and UV light irradiation can elicit recruitment of polκ to nuclear foci, suggesting a possible role for polκ in responses to genotoxins and replication stress. Like polη, polκ interacts physically with PCNA, and its DNA synthesis activity is stimulated by PCNA and RFC in vitro (31Haracska L. Unk I. Johnson R.E. Phillips B.B. Hurwitz J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is good evidence that Y family polymerases play key roles in the regulation of DNA synthesis after acquisition of DNA damage. However, thus far, S-phase checkpoint pathways and TLS processes have been studied completely separately, and the relationships between the two cellular processes remain totally unknown. In this study we have tested roles for TLS polymerases in the S-phase checkpoint elicited by BPDE. Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated that the ATR/9-1-1/Chk1 pathway mediates S-phase arrest in response to BPDE adducts (32Guo N. Faller D.V. Vaziri C. Cell Growth & Differ. 2002; 13: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar, 33Weiss R.S. Leder P. Vaziri C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 791-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because of results from other laboratories demonstrating roles for polκ in replicative bypass of BPDE adducts in vitro and cell survival after B[a]P challenge, we tested a potential role for polκ in the BPDE-induced intra-S-phase checkpoint. The results presented here demonstrate that polκ is recruited to sites of ongoing DNA synthesis after acquisition of BPDE damage. Furthermore, we show that polκ is required for a normal S-phase checkpoint in response to BPDE adducts (and UV light-induced lesions) but not S-phase checkpoints because of DSBs or replication stress. In contrast, polη is dispensable for the BPDE-induced checkpoint, yet is required for a normal checkpoint response to UV lesions. Adenovirus Construction—cDNAs encoding GFP-polκ and YFP-polη were subcloned into pAC-CMV to generate pAC-GFP-polκ and pAC-YFP-polη, respectively. The resulting shuttle vectors were co-transfected into 293T cells with the pJM17 plasmid to generate recombinant adenovirus as described previously (32Guo N. Faller D.V. Vaziri C. Cell Growth & Differ. 2002; 13: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Human lung carcinoma H1299 cells, Polk+/+, and Polk-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and xeroderma pigmentosum-variant CRL1162 fibroblasts or CRL1162 + XPV (XPV cells reconstituted with polη) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml) and penicillin (100 units/ml). Genotoxin Treatments—BPDE (NCI carcinogen repository) was dissolved in anhydrous Me2SO and added directly to the growth medium as a 1000× stock to give final concentrations of 100 or 600 nm. For hydroxyurea treatment, hydroxyurea was dissolved in water and added directly to the growth medium as a 1000× stock to give a final concentration of 1 μm. For UVC treatment, the growth medium was removed from the cells and replaced with PBS. The plates were transferred to a UV cross-linker (Stratagene) and then irradiated. The UVC dose delivered to the cells was confirmed with a UV radiometer (UVP, Inc.). The cells were then re-fed with complete growth medium and returned to the incubator. For IR treatment, cells were placed in PBS, irradiated with a cesium source, then re-fed with complete growth medium, and returned to the incubator. In some experiments, cells were incubated in medium containing 5 mm caffeine (Sigma) for 1 h before genotoxin treatment. Clonogenic Survival Assays—For colony survival assays, cells were grown to 80% confluence, treated with genotoxins (as described above), and then split into replicate 10-cm plates at a density of 1000 cells/plate. Plates were re-fed every 3 days. After 10 days, colonies on the plates were fixed in methanol, stained with crystal violet, and counted. DNA Synthesis Assays—[3H]Thymidine incorporation assays were performed as described previously (32Guo N. Faller D.V. Vaziri C. Cell Growth & Differ. 2002; 13: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar, 33Weiss R.S. Leder P. Vaziri C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 791-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were split into 12-well plates and grown to 60% confluence. After genotoxin treatments, replicate wells were given [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min. At the end of the labeling period, the [3H]thymidine-containing medium was aspirated, and the monolayers were fixed by addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid. The fixed cells were washed three times with 5% trichloroacetic acid to remove unincorporated [3H]thymidine. The trichloroacetic acid-fixed cells were solubilized in 0.3 n NaOH. A 300-μl aliquot of the NaOH-solubilized material was transferred to a scintillation vial and neutralized by addition of 100 μl of glacial acetic acid. After addition of 5 ml of Ecoscint scintillation fluid, [3H]thymidine was measured by scintillation counting. FACS Analysis—Cells were split into 60-mm plates and grown to 60% confluence. Cells were pulsed with BrdUrd for 1 h to label the S-phase population. The resulting cultures were washed three times with 5 ml of complete medium to remove unincorporated BrdUrd. Genotoxin treatments were as described above. Labeling and FACS analyses were performed as described previously (34Vaziri C. Saxena S. Jeon Y. Lee C. Murata K. Machida Y. Wagle N. Hwang D.S. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). At various times after genotoxin treatment, cells were trypsinized, recovered by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 s), and fixed in 35% EtOH in PBS for 1 h overnight. Fixed nuclei were recovered by centrifugation and incubated in 2 n HCl for 20 min to denature the DNA. Acid-treated cells were neutralized by washing in 0.1 m borax, pH 8.5, and then rinsed in PBS. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of antibody labeling solution comprising 30 μl of PBS with 0.5% Tween 20 and 0.5% BSA plus 20 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated BrdUrd antibody (Pharmingen). The cells were incubated for 30 min in the dark with frequent mixing. Labeled cells were resuspended and washed in 1 ml of PBS to remove free antibody. Washed nuclei were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 8 μg of RNase A and 50 μg of propidium iodide. The nuclear suspensions were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min prior to FACS analysis (on a BD Bioscience instrument with Cellquest software). Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were split into 4-well chamber slides, grown to 50% confluence, and then infected with adenovirus carrying GFP-polκ or YFP-polη. 20 h after infection, cells were treated with genotoxins for various times. To visualize GFP-polκ or YFP-polη fluorescence, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After washing the slides with PBS, cells were DAPI-stained and mounted with Vectashield solution (Vector Laboratories). For some experiments, sites of ongoing DNA synthesis were labeled by incubation in 35 μm BrdUrd-containing medium for 20 min, immediately prior to genotoxin treatment. To detect incorporated BrdUrd, the fixed cells were treated with 2 n HCl (to denature the DNA) after fixation. After neutralization and washing in PBS, cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a mouse monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (Serotec) diluted 1:10 in 1% BSA/PBST. The slides were washed three times with 1% BSA/PBST and then incubated for 1 h with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:300 in 1% BSA/PBST. After washing (three times with 1% BSA/PBST), the slides were DAPI-stained and mounted with Vectashield solution (Vector Laboratories). Slides were imaged and analyzed using a Delta Vision Image Restoration Microscopy System (dv1301421, Applied Precision). In some experiments cell populations were scored for constitutive and genotoxin-induced foci using a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescent microscope. In these studies, 500 cells were counted for each experimental condition. Immunoblotting—Total cell lysates were prepared as described previously (32Guo N. Faller D.V. Vaziri C. Cell Growth & Differ. 2002; 13: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar) in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl,1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). In some experiments, whole nuclei were prepared using CSK buffer as described by Hanaoka and co-workers (35Izumi M. Yanagi K. Mizuno T. Yokoi M. Kawasaki Y. Moon K.Y. Hurwitz J. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4769-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Total cell extracts or nuclear protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed using the following antibodies: rabbit anti-Chk1 (FL-476, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-Chk2 (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal anti-PCNA (sc-56, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-phospho-Chk1 Ser-345 (catalog number 2341, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-phospho-Chk2 Thr-68 (catalog number 2661, Cell Signaling), mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-ATM Ser-1981 (catalog number 4526, Cell Signaling), and mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-H2AX (catalog number 05-636, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Reproducibility—All data shown are representative of experiments that were repeated at least three times in replicate. BPDE Induces Formation of GFP-polκ Nuclear Foci at Sites of Ongoing DNA Synthesis—Other workers have shown (30Bergoglio V. Bavoux C. Verbiest V. Hoffmann J.S. Cazaux C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4413-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 36Ogi T. Kannouche P. Lehmann A.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that a fusion protein of polκ with GFP is recruited to discrete nuclear foci (presumably representing sites of DNA damage) in response to genotoxins. However, the effect of BPDE on the subcellular distribution of polκ has not been studied in detail. Therefore, we investigated GFP-polκ localization during the BPDE-induced S-phase checkpoint response. For expression of GFP-polκ in cultured cells, we generated a recombinant adenovirus vector (designated AdGFP-polκ). We chose human lung carcinoma H1299 cells for our studies of GFP-polκ distribution because we have characterized S-phase regulation extensively in this cell line (32Guo N. Faller D.V. Vaziri C. Cell Growth & Differ. 2002; 13: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar, 34Vaziri C. Saxena S. Jeon Y. Lee C. Murata K. Machida Y. Wagle N. Hwang D.S. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). More importantly, we have shown that H1299 cells contain an intact BPDE-induced S-phase checkpoint pathway (32Guo N. Faller D.V. Vaziri C. Cell Growth & Differ. 2002; 13: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar). Exponentially growing H1299 cells were infected with AdGFP-polκ at a multiplicity of infection of 5 per cell, which results in 100% transduction efficiency under our standard experimental conditions. 18 h after infection of H1299 cells with AdGFP-polκ, the GFP-polκ fusion protein displayed a diffuse nuclear distribution. A representative GFP-polκ-expressing H1299 cell is shown in the upper left panel of Fig. 1a. Next we tested the effect of BPDE treatment on polκ localization. AdGFP-polκ-expressing cells were treated with 100 nm BPDE for 2 or 20 h. At 2 h after treatment with 100 nm BPDE, H1299 cells undergo a transient inhibition of DNA synthesis (Fig. 1b). The BPDE-induced delay in S-phase results from inhibition of initiation of DNA synthesis at late-firing origins (37Kaufmann W.K. Smith B.J. Cordeiro-Stone M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 824: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 38Cordeiro-Stone M. Smith B.J. Kaufmann W.K. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1775-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and is termed the intra-S-phase checkpoint. 6–8 h after treatment with 100 nm BPDE, cells recover from the checkpoint-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis (Fig. 1b). Concomitant with activation of the BPDE-induced checkpoint, we observed an increase in the formation of nuclear GFP-polκ foci. A representative cell containing GFP-polκ foci is shown in Fig. 1a (middle left panel). Approximately 50% of the cells contained GFP-polκ foci 2 h after treatment with 100 nm BPDE (Fig. 1c). The nuclear GFP-polκ foci resulting from 100 nm BPDE were induced transiently. 20 h after 100 nm BPDE treatment, a time point after the cells recover from the BPDE-induced S-phase checkpoint (Fig. 1b), few GFP-polκ foci were evident. Therefore, there is a good temporal correlation between checkpoint-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis and recruitment of GFP-polκ to sites of damage. Doses of 600 nm BPDE or higher induce an irreversible block to DNA synthesis (Fig. 1b). Inhibition of DNA synthesis by high doses of BPDE (∼600 nm) resulted from inhibition of origin firing (initiation) and chain elongation (37Kaufmann W.K. Smith B.J. Cordeiro-Stone M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 824: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 38Cordeiro-Stone M. Smith B.J. Kaufmann W.K. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1775-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast with the checkpoint-mediated inhibition of initiation, the block to elongation was not considered a checkpoint response but instead resulted from direct physical blocks to DNA replication at sites of damage. Treatment of GFP-polκ-expressing H1299 cells with 600 nm BPDE resulted in more numerous and intense nuclear foci than were induced by 100 nm BPDE. Moreover, foci induced by 600 nm BPDE were present for at least 20 h, concomitant with BPDE-induced replication blocks (Fig. 1, a, right panels, and c). As indicated in Fig. 1c, GFP-polκ foci were detected in ∼50% of the genotoxin-treated cells 2 h after acquisition of DNA damage. In exponentially growing cultures of H1299 cells, ∼50% of the population was actively synthesizing DNA, as shown by BrdUrd labeling and FACScan analysis (Fig. 2a). Therefore, it appeared likely that the cells containing BPDE-induced polκ foci represented those actively synthesizing DNA. To identify S-phase sub-populations of GFP-polκ-expressing cells, the cultures were pulse-labeled in the presence of BrdUrd for 1 h immediately prior to treatment with genotoxins. After genotoxin treatment, BrdUrd incorporated into S-phase nuclei was visualized using Cy3-coupled secondary antibodies (Fig. 2b). In these experiments, BPDE-induced GFP-polκ nuclear foci were only ever detected in BrdUrd-positive cells (Fig. 2b), thereby demonstrating that nuclear polκ focus formation occurs in S-phase. Moreover, GFP-polκ foci localized adjacent to sites that were pre-labeled with BrdUrd, (i.e. replication foci), suggesting that nuclear polκ foci represent sites where active replication forks encounter BPDE adducts.

Oxysterols through liver X receptor (LXR) activation regulate cholesterol efflux, whereas the non-sterol mevalonate metabolite, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), was recently demonstrated to inhibit ABCA1 expression directly, through antagonism of LXR and indirectly through enhanced RhoA geranylgeranylation. We used HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) to test the hypothesis that reduced synthesis of mevalonate metabolites would enhance cholesterol efflux and attenuate foam cell formation. Preincubation of THP-1 macrophages with atorvastatin, dose dependently (1–10 μm) stimulated cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein AI (apoAI, 10–60%, p < 0.05) and high density lipoprotein (HDL3) (2–50%, p < 0.05), despite a significant decrease in cholesterol synthesis (2–90%). Atorvastatin also increased ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA abundance (30 and 35%, p < 0.05). Addition of mevalonate, GGPP or farnesyl pyrophosphate completely blocked the statin-induced increase in ABCA1 expression and apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux. A role for RhoA was established, because two inhibitors of Rho protein activity, a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor and C3 exoenzyme, increased cholesterol efflux to apoAI (20–35%, p < 0.05), and macrophage expression of dominant-negative RhoA enhanced cholesterol efflux to apoAI (20%, p < 0.05). In addition, atorvastatin increased the RhoA levels in the cytosol fraction and decreased the membrane localization of RhoA. Atorvastatin treatment activated peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ and increased LXR-mediated gene expression suggesting that atorvastatin induces cholesterol efflux through a molecular cascade involving inhibition of RhoA signaling, leading to increased peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ activity, enhanced LXR activation, increased ABCA1 expression, and cholesterol efflux. Finally, statin treatment inhibited cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages challenged with atherogenic hypertriglyceridemic very low density lipoproteins indicating that statins can regulate foam cell formation.

Finally, statin treatment inhibited cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages challenged with atherogenic hypertriglyceridemic very low density lipoproteins indicating that statins can regulate foam cell formation. Arterial macrophages are faced with the task of internalizing and metabolizing atherogenic lipoproteins, an event that challenges cellular cholesterol homeostasis (1Ross R. N. Engl. J.

Med. 2002; 8: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Cholesterol homeostasis is maintained through the coordinated regulation of pathways mediating cholesterol uptake, storage, de novo synthesis, and efflux, and it is likely the dysregulation of these signals that promotes foam cell formation (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar, 3Li A.C. Glass C.K. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 4von Eckardstein A.

Med. 2002; 80: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A major source of endogenous ligands for these receptors are fatty acid derivatives and oxysterols derived from the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (7Rowe A.H. Argmann C.A. Edwards J.Y. Sawyez C.G. Morand O.H. Hegele R.A. Huff M.W. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or lipoprotein cholesterol (8Dussault I. Forman B.M.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). This pathway also yields non-sterol mevalonate metabolites involved in isoprenoid synthesis that have until recently mainly been associated with the regulation of cell cycle control and cytoskeleton organization (9Edwards P.A. Ericsson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, isoprenoid intermediates have been shown to affect PPARα, PPARγ, and LXRα activation (10Wilcox L.J. Borradaile N.M. Huff M.W. Cardiovasc.

A. 1997; 94: 10588-10593Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), suggesting they may have a role in the regulation of lipid homeostasis and potentially macrophage foam cell formation. The committed step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoids is catalyzed by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which promotes the deacylation of HMG-CoA to mevalonate (see Fig. 1) (9Edwards P.A. Ericsson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 15Istvan E.S. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2001; 292: 1160-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). This pathway produces numerous bioactive signaling molecules including oxysterols, farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), which regulate transcriptional and posttranscriptional events that affect various biological processes (9Edwards P.A. Ericsson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Oxysterols regulate the concentration of cellular sterols by activating LXR (16Ory D.S. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 660-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and by controlling the activities of HMG-CoA reductase and the sterol-sensing transcription factors, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1 and SREBP-2. Oxysterols are hypothesized to regulate the latter two activities by causing influx of plasma membrane cholesterol into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. In turn this facilitates the interaction of HMG-CoA reductase or the SREBP cleavage activating protein (SCAP) with the Insig proteins (17Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 18Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Interaction with Insig is required for the cholesterol-regulated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase, whereas interaction of Insig with SCAP retains the SCAP·SREBP complex within the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing activation of SREBPs to their active processed forms. FPP is the major branch point in the mevalonate pathway and in addition to cholesterol is incorporated into prenylated proteins. Members of the Ras and Rho GTPase family are major substrates for posttranslational modification by farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, respectively (9Edwards P.A. Ericsson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 19Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), a process essential for their proper membrane localization and activation (20Sinensky M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). GTPases function as molecular switches, cycling between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound state thereby mediating cellular responses through their association with numerous effector molecules including kinases (10Wilcox L.J. Borradaile N.M. Huff M.W. Cardiovasc. Drug Rev. 1999; 17: 160-178Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that HMG-CoA reductase inhibition, through reduced RhoA activation, resulted in decreased phosphorylation and enhanced the activity of PPARα (11Martin G. Duez H. Blanquart C. Berezowski V. Poulain P. Fruchart J.C. Najib-Fruchart J. Glineur C. Staels B. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Because PPARγ is also negatively regulated through phosphorylation (21Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), we predicted that RhoA could also modulate PPARγ activation and the expression of PPARγ target genes. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the non-sterol mevalonate intermediate, GGPP, can directly antagonize LXR activity as well as indirectly inhibit expression of LXR-responsive genes, by reducing Rho protein activation (14Forman B.M. Ruan B. Chen J. Schroepfer G.J.J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10588-10593Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 22Meiner V.L. Tam C. Gunn M.D. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Lipid. Res. 1997; 38: 1928-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, mevalonate metabolites derived from the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway may represent an additional endogenous mechanism for regulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (14Forman B.M. Ruan B. Chen J. Schroepfer G.J.J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10588-10593Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 22Meiner V.L. Tam C. Gunn M.D. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Lipid. Res. 1997; 38: 1928-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) through modulation of PPARγ- and LXR-responsive genes. Key targets of PPARγ and LXRα activation are the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins, ABCA1 and ABCG1 (3Li A.C. Glass C.K. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 23Chinetti G. Lestavel S. Bocher V. Remaley A.T. Neve B. Torra I.P. Teissier E. Minnich A. Jaye M. Duverger N. Brewer H.B.

Edwards P.A. Curtiss L.K. Evans R.M. Tontonoz P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). ABCA1 controls the rate-limiting step in cellular cholesterol and phospholipid efflux to apoA1 (25Oram J.F. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2002; 13: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and ABCG1 facilitates cholesterol efflux from macrophages to HDL (26Wang N. Lan D. Chen W. Matsuura F. Tall A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9774-9779Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Net cholesteryl ester (CE) deposition in macrophages depends on the competing processes of lipoprotein uptake and cholesterol efflux. The integral role of ABCA1 in foam cell formation is exemplified by the loss-of-function mutations causing Tangier disease, characterized by a significant accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages (reviewed in Ref. 27Tall A.R. Costet P. Wang N. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression is up-regulated by agonists of PPARγ and LXRα through a transcriptional cascade ultimately dependent on the activation of LXRα (23Chinetti G. Lestavel S. Bocher V. Remaley A.T. Neve B. Torra I.P. Teissier E. Minnich A. Jaye M. Duverger N. Brewer H.B. Fruchart J.C. Clavey V. Staels B. Nat.

Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). We recently reported that PPARγ agonists blocked macrophage foam cell formation induced by oxidized lipoproteins through enhanced ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux in an LXR-dependent manner (28Argmann C.A. Sawyez C.G. McNeil C.J. Hegele R.A. Huff M.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Statins are competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase that decrease cholesterol biosynthesis and are widely used for cholesterol-lowering therapy and prevention of atherosclerosis-related events (15Istvan E.S. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2001; 292: 1160-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). A number of pleiotropic effects or properties of statins independent of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol-lowering, have been identified in vascular cells which include: improved endothelial function; enhanced plaque stability; decreased oxidative stress and inflammation; and inhibition of thrombogenic responses in the vascular wall (reviewed in Ref. 29Takemoto M. Liao J.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1712-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Some of these effects have been associated with the ability of statins to decrease isoprenoid synthesis and subsequent prenylation of small GTP-binding proteins such as Rho and Ras (29Takemoto M. Liao J.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1712-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 30Liao J.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In the present study we used HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to test the hypothesis that non-sterol derivatives arising from mevalonate biotransformation play a role in macrophage cholesterol efflux. Treatment of macrophages with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin, significantly enhanced mRNA expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 and increased cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) and HDL3. These results occurred despite the statin-induced inhibition of endogenous cholesterol synthesis. The effects of atorvastatin were completely reversible by the addition of exogenous mevalonate and the non-sterol intermediate GGPP. Furthermore, inhibitors of farnesylation and geranylgeranylation each mimicked the effect of statins, supporting the concept that non-sterol mevalonate metabolites, specifically the isoprenoid intermediates, can regulate macrophage cholesterol efflux. The mechanism for these effects was, in part, because of reduced RhoA activation, leading to the activation of LXR. Increased PPARγ activity contributed to the enhanced LXR activity. Furthermore, in macrophages challenged with native atherogenic hypertriglyceridemic (HTG) very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), CE accumulation was significantly reduced by incubation with atorvastatin. Therefore, statin-induced inhibition of non-sterol mevalonate intermediates can decrease macrophage foam cell formation through up-regulation of cholesterol efflux. Lipoproteins—Subjects were recruited from the Outpatient Lipid Clinic at the London Health Sciences Centre, University Campus, London, Ontario. These studies were approved by the University of Western Ontario Health Sciences Standing Committee on Human Research. Large very low density lipoprotein (Sf20–400) were isolated from plasma of type IV hypertriglyceridemic subjects (HTG-VLDL), whereas low density (Sf0–12) and high density lipoproteins (HDL3) were isolated from normal subjects by sequential ultracentrifugation as previously described (31Whitman S.C.

S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—This study used the human macrophage-like cell line THP-1 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD), human liver cell line HepG2 (ATCC) (35Wilcox L.J. Borradaile N.M. de Dreu L.E. Huff M.W. J.

Wolfe B.M. Huff M.W. J. Lipid. Res. 1998; 39: 1008-1020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). THP-1 cells were differentiated using phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate at 300 nm for a total of 7 days. For each experiment, the appropriate concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, concentration did not exceed 0.5%), were added to cells. Atorvastatin (sodium salt of the open acid form) was provided by Pfizer and simvastatin (sodium salt of the open acid form) was provided by Merck. Cholesterol Synthesis—THP-1 macrophages were preincubated for 19 h with increasing doses of atorvastatin (1–10 μm) in RPMI (10% fetal bovine serum) prior to a 5-h incubation of cells in the absence or presence of atorvastatin and 1 μCi of [1-14C]acetic acid (Amersham Biosciences) in RPMI (5% LPDS (36Evans A.J. Sawyez C.G. Wolfe B.M. Connelly P.W. Maguire G.F. Huff M.W. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 703-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The incorporation of [1-14C]acetic acid into cholesterol was determined following separation of lipids by thin layer chromatography, as described elsewhere (37Evans A.J. Sawyez C.G. Wolfe B.M. Huff M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10743-10751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol Efflux Assay—Efflux of cholesterol from cholesterolloaded cells was determined as described previously (38Argmann C.A. Van Den Diepstraten C.H. Sawyez C.G. Edwards J.Y. Hegele R.A. Wolfe B.M. Huff M.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 2011-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In brief, THP-1 macrophages were converted to foam cells by incubation with acetylated LDL and [1α,2α-3H]cholesterol (1 μCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences) for 24 h. The foam cells were subsequently washed, and a statin (atorvastatin or simvastatin) was added to cells in medium containing 0.2% FAF-BSA for 16 h. Cells were then incubated with fresh medium in the presence or absence of statin and containing either 0.2% FAF-BSA only or supplemented with human apoAI (Sigma, 10 μg/ml) or HDL3 (100 μg protein/ml) for an additional 24 h. The medium was then centrifuged, and the amount of radioactivity was determined. Cholesterol efflux was expressed as the percentage of counts in the medium versus total [3H]cholesterol counts (medium plus cell). In some experiments, cholesterol efflux was determined in cells that had been preincubated for 16 h with the following compounds prior to a 24 h co-incubation of the compound and acceptor. These included mevalonate (100 μm, Sigma), FPP (5 or 10 μm, Biomol Research Laboratories Inc.), GGPP (5 or 10 μm, Biomol Research Laboratories), farnesyl transferase inhibitor (10 μm, Calbiochem, added only in presence of acceptor), geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor (GGTI, 10 μm, Calbiochem), C3 exoenzyme (10 μg/ml, Calbiochem), the ROCKI/II inhibitor (Y27632, 10 μm, Calbiochem), the PPARγ antagonist, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (39Wright H.M.

Mevalonate, FPP, and GGPP were tested both in the absence and presence of atorvastatin, whereas the Rho protein inhibitors were only tested in the absence of a statin. All of the nuclear hormone receptor antagonists used were tested in the absence and presence of a statin, which were added 30 min prior to the addition of the statin. mRNA Abundance—THP-1 macrophages were seeded at 3.0 × 107 cells/100-mm plate (Falcon Scientific) in RPMI 1640 (10% fetal bovine serum and phorbol dibutyrate, 300 nm). All cells were treated for 24 h in medium supplemented with 5% LPDS in the absence or presence of indicated compound. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and mRNA abundance was measured as described previously (28Argmann C.A. Sawyez C.G. McNeil C.J. Hegele R.A. Huff M.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotides (5 pmol) were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. An oligonucleotide of interest and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase oligonucleotide were simultaneously hybridized to total RNA (20 μg) from either control or treated cells and incubated for 16 h. DNA·RNA hybrids were digested with S1 nuclease, precipitated, and separated by denaturing PAGE (19%). Bands were visualized using a PhosphorImager and quantified using Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Analysis of RhoA Cellular Localization—THP-1 macrophages (100-mm dishes) were incubated in the absence or presence of atorvastatin for 24 h (5% LPDS). Cells were scraped into 500 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (octylphenoxy)polyethoxyethanol) containing aprotinin (100 units/ml), ALLN (2 μg/ml), leupeptin (0.1 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm), pepstatin (5 μg/ml), and benzamidine (250 μg/ml) and homogenized by 15 passes through a 25-gauge needle. The postnuclear supernatant was obtained by centrifugation (500 g, 4 °C, 10 min). The postnuclear fraction was further spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min (4 °C, Beckman TLA 120.2 rotor) to obtain a pellet of the cell membrane fraction and cytosol fraction in the supernatant. The pellet was suspended in membrane resuspension buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% SDS) containing the protease inhibitors. Protein from the cytosol and membrane (20–100 μg) fractions were mixed with SDS loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked (16 h, 4 °C) with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline. Membranes were incubated with a monoclonal antibody for RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), followed by incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Santa Cruz). RhoA was detected using BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate (Roche Diagnostics). Quantification analysis of the developed films was performed using an imaging densitometer (GS-700, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Transient Transfection—The coding sequence for human RhoA T19N (Guthrie cDNA Resource Center, Sayre, PA) with the mutation T19N that confers a dominant-negative phenotype, was cloned into a pIRES2-EGFP vector (BD Biosciences Clontech) in the multiple cloning sites with EcoRI and SalI. The fragment encoding RhoT19N-IRES-EGFP was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of pLNCX2 vector (Clontech) using XhoI and NotI restriction sites. The construct was isolated and sequence verified using an ABI 377 prism automated DNA sequencer. Lipofectamine reagents (Invitrogen) and the manufacturer's protocol were used for transient transfections. THP-1 cells were plated at 4.0 × 106 cells/well in 35-mm wells (Falcon Scientific) in RPMI 1640 (10% fetal bovine serum, PDB, antibiotics). THP-1 cells were allowed to differentiate for 4 days prior to transfection with either pLNCX2-EGFP or pLNCX2-EGFP-RhoAT19N (1 μg of plasmid DNA:4 μl of Lipofectamine reagent). After 24 h, the medium was removed, cells were converted to foam cells, and cholesterol efflux was assayed as described above. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression was visualized using fluorescence microscopy as an indication of the transfection efficiency and transgene expression in cells. EGFP expression was observed within 48 h posttransfection and continued 5 days posttransfection. PPARγ Phosphorylation—Duplicate wells of THP-1 macrophages were incubated for 24 h with atorvastatin in 5% LPDS. Cells were scraped into lysis buffer (1.25%, w/w, (octylphenoxy)polyethoxyethanol, 1.25%, w/v, sodium deoxycholate, 0.0125 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, and 100 units/ml aprotinin) containing the phosphatase inhibitors sodium vanadate (0.2 mm) and sodium fluoride (50 mm). Cells were disrupted with five passages through an 18-gauge needle, incubated for 30 min on ice, and then centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C (10,000 rpm). Protein from the whole cell extract (600 μg at a concentration of 1 μg/μl in phosphate-buffered saline) was incubated with 30 μl of the PPARγ Affinity Sorbent gel slurry (Cayman Chemical) for 16 h, 4 °C. Beads were precipitated by brief centrifugation, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline prior to resuspension in SDS loading buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by 12% PAGE and transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked (16 h, 4 °C) with 5% (w/v) BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline, and incubated 16 h with an affinity purified anti-human PPARγ antibody (WAK-Chemie, Steinbach, Germany) followed by a 1 h incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz). PPARγ was detected using BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate. Quantification analysis of the developed films was performed using an imaging densitometer (GS-700). To determine the extent of serine phosphorylation of PPARγ, aliquots of whole cell extract (500 μg), were immunoprecipitated with anti-PPAR"
https://openalex.org/W2039884825,"Gaucher disease is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the lysosomal enzyme acid-β-glucosidase (GlcCerase). We recently determined the x-ray structure of GlcCerase to 2.0 Å resolution (Dvir, H., Harel, M., McCarthy, A. A., Toker, L., Silman, I., Futerman, A. H., and Sussman, J. L. (2003) EMBO Rep.4, 704–709) and have now solved the structure of Glc-Cerase conjugated with an irreversible inhibitor, conduritol-B-epoxide (CBE). The crystal structure reveals that binding of CBE to the active site does not induce a global conformational change in GlcCerase and confirms that Glu340 is the catalytic nucleophile. However, only one of two alternative conformations of a pair of flexible loops (residues 345–349 and 394–399) located at the entrance to the active site in native GlcCerase is observed in the GlcCerase-CBE structure, a conformation in which the active site is accessible to CBE. Analysis of the dynamics of these two alternative conformations suggests that the two loops act as a lid at the entrance to the active site. This possibility is supported by a cluster of mutations in loop 394–399 that cause Gaucher disease by reducing catalytic activity. Moreover, in silico mutational analysis demonstrates that all these mutations stabilize the conformation that limits access to the active site, thus providing a mechanistic explanation of how mutations in this loop result in Gaucher disease.

Putting a Lid on Gaucher Disease Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 280Issue 25PreviewGaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder that is caused by mutations in the enzyme acid-β-glucosidase (GlcCerase). These mutations result in the intracellular accumulation of the enzyme's lipid substrate, glucosylceramide, by reducing either the enzyme's activity or its concentration. Previously, Dvir et al.

These mutations diminish GlcCerase activity either by reducing enzyme activity or by reducing the lysosomal enzyme concentration. Enzyme activity is reduced in mutations that affect the turnover number, substrate affinity, or activator binding (4Grace M.E. Newman K.M. Scheinker V. Berg-Fussman A. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2283-2291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysosomal enzyme concentration is reduced by mutations that compromise folding in the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in proteasomal degradation of the protein (5Sawkar A.R. Cheng W.C. Beutler E. Wong C.H. Balch W.E. Kelly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2002; 99: 15428-15433Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). We recently solved the three-dimensional structure of recombinant GlcCerase (Cerezyme®), the enzyme used in enzyme replacement therapy in Gaucher disease (6Dvir H. Harel M. McCarthy A.A. Toker L. Silman I. Futerman A.H. Sussman J.L. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The structure comprises three non-contiguous domains, with the catalytic site located in domain III (residues 76–381 and 416–430), a (β/α)8 (TIM) barrel. The function of the two non-catalytic domains is not known, but mutations that cause Gaucher disease are found in all three domains. To determine whether substrate or inhibitor binding can induce conformational change(s) in GlcCerase, and to try to gain insight into possible roles of the non-catalytic domains, we have now determined the crystal structure of a conjugate of GlcCerase with an irreversible inhibitor, conduritol-B-epoxide (1,2-anhydro-myo-inositol; CBE) (7Legler G. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1990; 48: 319-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Binding of CBE did not induce a global conformational change in the structure of Glc-Cerase but permitted us to assign a role to two surface loops found at the entrance to the active site and to suggest how mutations in one of these loops might reduce catalytic activity, thus leading to Gaucher disease. Materials—Cerezyme® was obtained from patient leftovers. CBE was from Biomol (Plymouth, PA), and N-glycosidase F was from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany). N-(6-(7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)hexanoyl-d-erythro-glucosylsphingosine (C6-NBD-Glc-Cer) was prepared as described (8Meivar-Levy I. Horowitz M. Futerman A.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—Cerezyme® was crystallized after partial deglycosylation using N-glycosidase F (6Dvir H. Harel M. McCarthy A.A. Toker L. Silman I. Futerman A.H. Sussman J.L. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), which is capable of cleaving all types of asparagine bound N-glycans (9Tarentino A.L. Gomez C.M. Plummer Jr., T.H.

McCarthy A.A. Toker L. Silman I. Futerman A.H. Sussman J.L. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). GlcCerase-CBE crystals were obtained by soaking native GlcCerase crystals overnight at 19 °C in mother liquor (1 m (NH4)2SO4, 170 mm guanidinium HCl, 20 mm KCl, 100 mm acetate, pH 4.6) containing 1 mm CBE. The crystals were cryoprotected with a gradient of 5–25% glycerol. Data were collected “in-house” at 100 K on an R-AXIS IV++ imaging plate system mounted on an RU300 x-ray generator operating at 50 kV and 90 mA. Data were processed using XDS and XSCALE (11Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar). Reflections were converted using XDSCONV to a format suitable for CNS, and a list of randomly generated test reflections was inherited from a master list for the native orthorhombic crystal form of GlcCerase (6Dvir H.

After a round of simulated annealing, Fo – Fc and 2Fo – Fc maps were used to fit the CBE molecule, two carbohydrate moieties, and 10 sulfate molecules. XtalView (13McRee D.E. J. Struct.

The chemical model of cyclohexitol was built using CS Chem3D Pro (version 5.0), and energy minimization was performed on the inhibitor model using the molecular dynamics utilities of CS Chem3D Pro (www.camsoft.com). These models were used to generate suitable topology and parameter files for CNS using the PRODRG2 server (14Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4360) Google Scholar) prior to map fitting. 2-Fold non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were applied in all the refinement cycles. As the map phases improved with subsequent simulated annealing and individual B-refinements, additional water molecules were added. The model was further refined by positional maximum likelihood minimization and by individual B-factor refinement. The results are summarized in Table II. Figs. 2, 5, and 6 were generated using PyMOL (www.pymol.org). Side chain modeling for the in silico mutational analysis was performed using program O (15Jones T.A. J. Appl.

Upon redissolving in the GlcCerase reaction buffer, GlcCerase crystals were fully active, but crystals into which CBE had been soaked were devoid of catalytic activity (Fig. 1). X-ray data for the GlcCerase-CBE complex were collected (Table I) and refined to 2.4 Å resolution (Table II). From the initial Fo – Fc and the 2Fo – Fc maps, it is apparent that CBE binds only to Glu340 (Fig. 2) and not to any other residues, including Asp443 and Asp445 (17Dinur T. Osiecki K.M. Legler G. Gatt S. Desnick R.J. Grabowski G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1986; 83: 1660-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The proposed reaction mechanism (7Legler G. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1990; 48: 319-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen of CBE by the catalytic acid/base, followed by nucleophilic attack at C1 of the cyclohexitol ring, causing diaxial opening of the epoxide and formation of a nucleophile-cyclohexitol ester bond (Fig. 3). The crystal structure supports this mechanism, since the distance between C1 of the cyclohexitol and Glu340Oε2 is 1.43 Å, confirming Glu340 as the active-site nucleophile (Fig. 2). Moreover, the distance between the epoxide oxygen of CBE, oriented similarly to the cyclohexitol ring, and Glu235Oε, is within hydrogen-bonding distance, consistent with the role of Glu235 as the acid/base catalyst (18Henrissat B. Callebaut I. Fabrega S. Lehn P. Mornon J.P. Davies G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1995; 92: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2b). Additional residues in proximity to the cyclohexitol in Glc-Cerase (Fig. 4a) were compared with those found in a plant β-d-glucan glucohydrolase (19Hrmova M. Varghese J.N. De Gori R. Smith B.J. Driguez H. Fincher G.B. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4b), a member of the same glycohydrolase family. In contrast to the chair conformation adopted by the cyclohexitol upon binding to a plant β-d-glucan glucohydrolase (19Hrmova M. Varghese J.N. De Gori R. Smith B.J. Driguez H. Fincher G.B. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the cyclohexitol is found in a boat conformation in GlcCerase, with hydrogen bonds to Asn234Oδ1 and Nδ2, Glu340Oε1, Trp179Nε1, and Asp127Oδ1 and Oδ2 (Fig. 4a). The boat conformation is stabilized by tight hydrogen-bonding interactions between C4-OH of the cyclohexitol and Asp127 and between C3-OH and Asp127 and Trp179. Characterization of a Lid at the Entrance to the Active Site— Superimposition of the native GlcCerase structure on that of GlcCerase-CBE revealed an root mean square deviation of only ~0.32 Å, demonstrating that GlcCerase does not undergo a global structural change upon binding CBE. However, examination of the root mean square deviations of individual residues revealed a significant difference between native GlcCerase and GlcCerase-CBE with respect to the conformation of two loops, Ser345–Glu349 (loop 1) and Val394–Asp399 (loop 2). In native GlcCerase, the two molecules in the asymmetric unit display two alternative conformations (6Dvir H. Harel M. McCarthy A.A. Toker L. Silman I. Futerman A.H. Sussman J.L. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) for both of these loops (Fig. 5a). In loop 2, a major conformational difference is seen in the positions of Asn396 and Phe397 in the two asymmetric units (Fig. 5c), and in loop 1 a more modest difference is seen in the conformations of Lys346 and Glu349 (Fig. 5b). In contrast, the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the GlcCerase-CBE crystals adopt only one of these two conformations. Interestingly, the two loops are located on the surface of GlcCerase at the entrance to the active site. In the conformation adopted in the GlcCerase-CBE structure, Asn396 and Phe397 are positioned such that access to the active site is not restricted (Fig. 6a). However, in the other alternative conformation, which is displayed only in the native GlcCerase structure, the side chains of Asn396 and Phe397 swing over and block the entrance to the active site (Fig. 6b), suggesting that this loop serves as a lid regulating access to the active site in GlcCerase. Thus, these two loops allow GlcCerase to exist in either an open (Fig. 6a) or closed (Fig. 6b) conformation, depending on the orientation of the loops. The movies in supplemental Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate the dynamics of the movement of these two loops (29Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Biopolymers. 2003; 68: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Analysis of the distribution of mutant forms of GlcCerase that cause Gaucher disease reveals a cluster of mutations in loop 2, including V394L (2Beutler E. Grabowski G.A. Scriver C.R. Sly W.S.

In silico analysis of these mutants is consistent with either destabilization of the open conformation or stabilization of the closed conformation (Table III), thus limiting substrate access to the active site. For instance, V394L, one of the six most common mutations in Gaucher disease (2Beutler E. Grabowski G.A. Scriver C.R. Sly W.S. Childs B. Beaudet A.L. Valle D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3635-3668Google Scholar), results in enhanced hydrophobic interactions of Leu394 with Trp393 and Phe246 in the closed conformation; conversely, this same mutation destabilizes the open conformation, since the larger side chain cannot interact with the aromatic side chains of Trp393 and Phe246. Likewise, R395P destabilizes the open conformation due to the loss of a stabilizing salt bridge with Glu388. N396T results in additional hydrogen bonding between Thr396 and the carbonyl oxygens of residues Glu388 and Gly389 in the closed conformation but in reduced H-bonding with Asp127 in the open conformation. Thus, the structure of GlcCerase complexed to CBE gives insight into the mechanism by which catalytic activity is reduced by mutations in this newly identified lid that controls access to the active site.Table IIIIn silico mutational analysis of loop Val394–Asp399MutationClosed conformationOpen conformationV394LVal394Contacts with Phe246 and Trp393Contacts with Phe246 and Trp393Leu394Contacts with Pro245, Phe246, Arg395, and Trp393Contact with Pro245R395PArg395No interactionSalt bridge to Glu388Pro395No interactionNo interactionN396TAsn396No H-bondH-bond to Asp127Thr396H-bonds to Glu388(O) and Gly389(O)H-bond to Asp127V398LVal398Contacts with Phe128 and Phe397Contact with Phe128Leu398Contact with Phe397No interactionV398FVal398Contacts with Phe128 and Phe397Contact with Phe128Phe398Contact with Phe397No interactionD399NAsp399Salt bridge to Arg359 and H-bonds to Gln414(N), Arg353(O), and Ser400(N)Salt bridge to Arg359H-bond to Gln414(N), Ser400(N), and Arg353(N)Asn399H-bonds to Met416(Sδ), Val343(O), and Ser400(N)H-bonds to Ser400(N) and Gln414 Open table in a new tab In the current study we have solved the x-ray structure of GlcCerase covalently bound to CBE. Using this structure, we confirmed earlier assignments, based on electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, that Glu340 is the nucleophile and Glu235 is the acid/base catalyst (25Miao S. McCarter J.D. Grace M.E. Grabowski G.A. Aebersold R. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10975-10978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since catalytic activity was completely inhibited by binding of the cyclohexitol to Glu340, and since we saw no binding to any other residues, we can also exclude the possibility that the inhibitory effect of CBE on GlcCerase activity is due to binding to Asp443 and Asp445, as proposed earlier (17Dinur T. Osiecki K.M. Legler G. Gatt S. Desnick R.J. Grabowski G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1986; 83: 1660-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). There are no global structural changes between the Glc-Cerase-CBE structure and that of native GlcCerase, suggesting that binding of inhibitors to the active site, and presumably also binding of the lipid substrate, does not induce a major conformational change. This also serves as proof of concept that the GlcCerase structure can be used as a starting point for designing structure-based drugs aimed at restoring the activity of defective GlcCerase (3Futerman A.H. Sussman J.L. Horowitz M. Silman I. Zimran A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 147-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Important among these are the small molecular weight chaperones that, upon binding to the active site, restore trafficking of improperly folded GlcCerase out of the endoplasmic reticulum and through the secretory pathway to lysosomes, thereby restoring normal, or near-normal, lysosomal GlcCerase levels (5Sawkar A.R. Cheng W.C. Beutler E. Wong C.H. Balch W.E. Kelly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2002; 99: 15428-15433Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 26Fan J.Q. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 355-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Although there are no global structural changes, we did detect a significant structural change in two surface loops at the entrance to the active site that appear to act as a lid controlling access to the active site. Interestingly, a lid has also been detected in a number of glycosyltransferases (27Qasba P.K. Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 53-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In the glycosyltransferases, one or two flexible loops near the substrate binding site undergo a marked conformational change from an open to a closed conformation upon binding the donor substrate. The flexibility of these loops is crucial for the catalytic activity of the glycosyltransferases (27Qasba P.K. Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 53-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In GlcCerase, the role of one of the two surface loops in governing access to the active site is supported by the reduced affinity of GlcCerase for CBE in various GlcCerase mutations, such as V394L (4Grace M.E. Newman K.M. Scheinker V. Berg-Fussman A. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2283-2291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), R395P, and N396T (20Amaral O. Marcao A. Sa Miranda M. Desnick R.J. Grace M.E. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 8: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), although V394L also displays reduced thermostability and reduced stability at low pH (4Grace M.E. Newman K.M. Scheinker V. Berg-Fussman A. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2283-2291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), implying a disruption of structural integrity that may result in rapid lysosomal degradation. Thus, loop mutations may both decrease the catalytic activity of GlcCerase and reduce its lysosomal enzyme concentration. Unfortunately, sufficient amounts of GlcCerase mutated in residues in these loops are not available for crystallization studies, but in silico mutational analysis is entirely consistent with the lid being in the closed conformation in the mutated proteins, which would prevent access of GlcCer to the active site. The discovery of a lid regulating access to the GlcCerase active site provides the first mechanistic insight into how GlcCerase mutations result in reduced catalytic activity and as a consequence cause Gaucher disease.

VacA cytotoxic activity requires assembly of VacA monomers into oligomeric structures, formation of anion-selective membrane channels, and entry of VacA into host cells. In this study, we analyzed the functional properties of recombinant VacA fragments corresponding to two putative VacA domains (designated p33 and p55). Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that these two domains can interact with each other to form protein complexes. In comparison to the individual VacA domains, a mixture of the p33 and p55 proteins exhibited markedly enhanced binding to the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. Furthermore, internalization of the VacA domains was detected when cells were incubated with the p33/p55 mixture but not when the p33 and p55 proteins were tested individually. Incubation of cells with the p33/p55 mixture resulted in cell vacuolation, whereas the individual domains lacked detectable cytotoxic activity. Interestingly, sequential addition of p55 followed by p33 resulted in VacA internalization and cell vacuolation, whereas sequential addition in the reverse order was ineffective. These results indicate that both the p33 and p55 domains contribute to the binding and internalization of VacA and that both domains are required for vacuolating cytotoxic activity. Reconstitution of toxin activity from two separate domains, as described here for VacA, has rarely been described for pore-forming bacterial toxins, which suggests that VacA is a pore-forming toxin with unique structural properties.

In contrast, we demonstrate that when combined, the p33 and p55 domains form p33·p55 protein complexes and complement each other to permit VacA internalization into cells and reconstitution of vacuolating cytotoxic activity. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Escherichia coli DH5α was used for plasmid propagation and was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on LB agar at 37 °C. For expression of recombinant proteins, expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain JM109 (DE3) (Promega), which encodes an isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible copy of the RNA polymerase gene from bacteriophage T7. Transformants were grown in Terrific broth (Invitrogen) supplemented with 25 μg of kanamycin/ml (TB-KAN). H. pylori wild-type strain 60190 (American Type Culture Collection 49503; Manassas, VA) and strain VT330 (encoding a c-Myc-tagged VacA protein) (48McClain M.S. Cao P. Iwamoto H. Vinion-Dubiel A.D. Szabo G. Shao Z. Cover T.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6499-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) were grown on Trypticase soy agar plates containing 5% sheep blood at 37 °C in ambient air containing 5% CO2. H. pylori liquid cultures were grown in sulfite-free brucella broth supplemented with 0.5% activated charcoal (49Hawrylik S.J. Wasilko D.J. Haskell S.L. Gootz T.D. Lee S.E. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1994; 32: 790-792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of VacA from H. pylori—VacA was purified in an oligomeric form from culture supernatants of H. pylori, as described previously (28Cover T.L. Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In all experiments, purified VacA preparations from H. pylori were acid-activated before the addition of VacA to the cells, as described previously (40McClain M.S. Schraw W. Ricci V. Boquet P. Cover T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 50de Bernard M. Papini E. de Filippis V. Gottardi E. Telford J. Manetti R. Fontana A. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23937-23940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—VacA-expressing plasmids were constructed by cloning vacA sequences from H. pylori strain 60190 into pET-41b (Novagen) using procedures similar to those described previously (51McClain M.S. Cover T.L. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2266-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A vacA sequence encoding the VacA p33 domain (amino acids 1–312 of the mature, secreted H. pylori VacA toxin) with a His6 tag at the carboxyl terminus (p33His) was PCR-amplified from the pMM592 plasmid (51McClain M.S. Cover T.L. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2266-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) using primers BA9146, 5′-CCCACTAGTAAGAGGAGACGCCATGTTTTTTACAACCGTG-3′, and OP6228, 5′-CCCCTGCAGCT AGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTTTAGCACCACTTTGAGAAGG-3′. The PCR product was digested with SpeI and SalI and ligated into XbaI- and SalI-digested pET-41b (conferring kanamycin resistance) (Novagen). We also generated a plasmid that encoded a VacA p33 domain with two tags (c-Myc and His6), each at the carboxyl terminus of the protein (p33Myc-His). A vacA sequence encoding the p55 domain (amino acids 312–821 of the mature, secreted H. pylori VacA toxin) with a c-Myc tag (p55Myc) at the amino terminus was PCR-amplified from H. pylori VT330 genomic DNA using primers OP6229, 5′-CCCACTAGTAAGAGGAGACGCCATGGCAAACGCCGCACAGG-3′ and AND515a, 5′-CCCCGTCGACTTAAGCGTAGCTAGCGAAACGCG-3′. Also, a vacA sequence encoding the p55 domain with a His6 tag at the amino terminus was generated using primers AND7265, 5′-CCCACTAGTAAGAGGAGACGCCATGCATCACCATCACCATCACAAAAACGACAAACAAGAGAGC-3′ and the AND515a primer. PCR products were digested and cloned into pET-41b, as described above. The use of these primers resulted in a modification of the ribosomal binding site of pET-41b and encoded a methionine at the amino terminus of each VacA protein. The entire vacA fragment in each plasmid was analyzed by nucleotide sequence analysis to verify that no unintended mutations had been introduced. Expression of Recombinant VacA Proteins—VacA expression plasmids were transformed into the E. coli expression strain JM109 (DE3), and transformants were then inoculated into TB-KAN and grown at 37 °C overnight with shaking. These cultures were diluted 1:100 into TB-KAN and incubated at 37 °C until they reached an absorbance (A600) of 0.5. Cultures were then induced with a final isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside concentration of 0.5 mm and incubated at 25 °C for 16–18 h (p55 proteins) or at 37 °C for 2 h (p33 proteins). These varying conditions for isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction were selected to optimize expression and activity of the two different VacA domains. E. coli soluble extracts were generated as described previously with minor modifications (51McClain M.S. Cover T.L. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2266-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 ml of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced cultures were pelleted, washed in 0.9% NaCl, and resuspended in a solution (1 ml) that contained 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors (Complete Mini; Roche Applied Science), and 20,000 units of ReadyLyse lysozyme (Epicenter)/ml. Bacterial cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with periodic mixing, after which a solution (3 ml) containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 2.67 mm MgCl2, and 74 units of Omnicleave Nuclease (Epicenter)/ml was added. The samples were then mixed briefly, subjected to four successive rounds of freezing (in a dry ice methanol bath) and thawing at 37 °C, and then the insoluble debris was pelleted. The E. coli soluble extracts containing the VacA proteins were collected and stored at –20 °C until use. Immunoblot Analysis of Recombinant VacA—Proteins in E. coli soluble extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted using a polyclonal anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a monoclonal anti-c-Myc (9E10) antibody, or a polyclonal anti-VacA serum (958) (12Schraw W. Li Y. McClain M.S. van der Goot F.G. Cover T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34642-34650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). Signals were generated by the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham Biosciences) and detected using x-ray film. In experiments requiring the use of multiple recombinant VacA proteins, the relative concentrations of recombinant VacA in different E. coli soluble extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-His antibody, and the extracts were then normalized such that the relative molar concentrations of VacA in different preparations were approximately equivalent. Cell Culture and Vacuolating Assay—HeLa cells were grown in minimal essential medium (modified Eagle's medium containing Earle's salts) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. AZ-521 cells, a human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line (Culture Collection of Health Science Research Resources Bank, Japan Health Sciences Foundation) were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mm non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen). AGS human gastric epithelial cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL 1739) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For vacuolating assays, the cells were seeded at 1.2 × 104 cells/well into 96-well plates 24 h prior to each experiment. E. coli soluble extracts, containing recombinant VacA proteins, were normalized as described above and were added to fetal bovine serum-free tissue culture medium overlying the cells (supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamicin and 10 mm ammonium chloride) for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated in fetal bovine serum-free tissue culture medium, containing 10 mm ammonium chloride and gentamicin, for 4–6 h at 37 °C. For the p33/p55 complementation assays, E. coli soluble extracts were mixed and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C prior to addition to the medium overlying the cells. Purified VacA from H. pylori culture supernatant was routinely acid-activated prior to testing in cell culture assays (40McClain M.S. Schraw W. Ricci V. Boquet P. Cover T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 50de Bernard M. Papini E. de Filippis V. Gottardi E. Telford J. Manetti R. Fontana A. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23937-23940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), whereas E. coli soluble extracts were not acid-activated (51McClain M.S. Cover T.L. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2266-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). After incubation, cell vacuolation was examined by inverted light microscopy and quantified by a neutral red uptake assay (52Cover T.L. Puryear W. Pérez-Pérez G.I. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1264-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neutral red uptake data are presented as A540 values (mean ± S.D.). Immunoprecipitation of VacA Complexes—E. coli soluble extracts containing different recombinant VacA proteins were normalized as described above. Normalized soluble extracts were then mixed and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. VacA complexes were immunoprecipitated with an anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (2 μg/ml antibody 9E10) and protein G-coated beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) (48McClain M.S. Cao P. Iwamoto H. Vinion-Dubiel A.D. Szabo G. Shao Z. Cover T.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6499-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To analyze interactions between p33, p55, and p33/p55 mixture with full-length VacA, normalized soluble extracts were mixed with acid-activated c-Myc-tagged VacA (Myc-VacA) purified from H. pylori culture supernatant (2 μg/ml) for 1 h at 25 °C, and the proteins were immunoprecipitated as described above. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-His (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody or anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10), followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad), as described above. Analysis of VacA Binding and Internalization into Mammalian Cells—To analyze interactions of VacA with the surface of cells, E. coli soluble extracts, containing recombinant VacA proteins, were added to HeLa cells grown on cover glasses in 6-well plates for 1 h at 4 °C or 37 °C. VacA interactions with mammalian cells were then analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence (12Schraw W. Li Y. McClain M.S. van der Goot F.G. Cover T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34642-34650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 41Li Y. Wandinger-Ness A. Goldenring J.R. Cover T.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1946-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. Fixed cells were incubated with an anti-c-Myc antibody (1:500) or with an anti-VacA polyclonal antiserum that recognizes the p55 domain for 1 h at 25 °C. The cells were then washed and incubated with a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (1: 500) for 1 h at 25 °C. To analyze VacA internalization into host cells, E. coli soluble extracts containing single recombinant VacA proteins or mixtures of recombinant VacA proteins were incubated with HeLa cells for 1 h at 37 °C. Afterward, medium containing unbound proteins was removed, and the cells were incubated in fresh tissue culture medium (without fetal bovine serum or ammonium chloride) for 16 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed with TBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, and permeabilized with 100% methanol for 30 min at –20 °C (41Li Y. Wandinger-Ness A. Goldenring J.R. Cover T.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1946-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with the anti-VacA polyclonal antiserum or the anti-c-Myc antibody, followed by a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody. After immunolabeling, cover glasses were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, mounted on slides with Aqua-Polymount (Polysciences, Warrington, PA), and viewed with a LSM 510 confocal laser scanning inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss). For immunoblot analysis of VacA interactions with cells, HeLa cells were seeded into a 96-well plate and incubated with E. coli soluble extracts, as describ"
https://openalex.org/W1970247177,"A novel angucycline metabolite, 2,3-dehydro-UWM6, was identified in a jadH mutant of Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230. Both UWM6 and 2,3-dehydro-UWM6 could be converted to jadomycin A or B by a ketosynthase α (jadA) mutant of S. venezuelae. These angucycline intermediates were also converted to jadomycin A by transformant of the heterologous host Streptomyces lividans expressing the jadFGH oxygenases in vivo and by its cell-free extracts in vitro; thus the three gene products JadFGH are implicated in catalysis of the post-polyketide synthase biosynthetic reactions converting UWM6 to jadomycin aglycone. Genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that JadH possesses dehydrase activity, not previously associated with polyketide-modifying oxygenase. Since the formation of aromatic polyketides often requires multiple dehydration steps, bifunctionality of oxygenases modifying aromatic polyketides may be a general phenomenon.

Since the formation of aromatic polyketides often requires multiple dehydration steps, bifunctionality of oxygenases modifying aromatic polyketides may be a general phenomenon. Polyketides, a large structurally diverse group of secondary metabolites, are produced in bacteria, fungi and plants by polyketide synthase (PKS) 1The abbreviations used are: PKS, polyketide synthase; LC-MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy. complexes (1Hopwood D.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2465-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 2Shen B. Top. Curr. Chem. 2000; 209: 1-51Crossref Google Scholar). The remarkable diversity of polyketides is to a great extent due to post-PKS modifications that determine the ultimate structures of polyketide metabolites formed. Prominent among the tailoring enzymes responsible for post-PKS modifications are oxidoreductases and group transferases (3Rawlings B.J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1999; 16: 425-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 4Hutchinson C.R. Fujii I. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 201-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 5Rix U. Fischer C.

The atypical angucycline antibiotic jadomycin B (1) and its aglycone jadomycin A (2) are produced in cultures of Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230 grown under stress conditions in a medium containing isoleucine (6Han L. Yang K.Q. Ramalingam E. Mosher R.H. Vining L.C. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 3379-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7Yang K.Q. Han L. Ayer S.W. Vining L.C. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The angucycline origin of jadomycins was verified by accumulation of a well known antibiotic rabelomycin (3) in the jadF disruption mutant VS655 (7Yang K.Q. Han L. Ayer S.W. Vining L.C. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and by production of UWM6 (4) in Streptomyces lividans transformed with the jad PKS gene cluster (i.e. jadABCDEIJ) (8Kulowski K. Pienkowski E.W. Han L. Yang K.Q. Vining L.C. Hutchinson C.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1786-1794Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). One unique feature of the jadomycin family is its nitrogen-containing pentacyclic benz[b]oxazolophenanthridine ring, formed via a hitherto uncharacterized oxidative cleavage between C-5 and C-6 of ring B in an angucyclic polyketide intermediate. The phenanthridine ring system is plausibly derived by condensation of an amino acid with the postulated acid/aldehyde intermediate (5), formed during angucyclic ring opening (7Yang K.Q. Han L. Ayer S.W. Vining L.C. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Ayer S.W. McInnes A.G. Thibault P. Walter J.A. Doull J.L. Parnell T. Vining L.C. Tetrahedron Lett. 1991; 32: 6301-6304Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Strengthening this possibility is the formation of jadomycin analogues when different amino acids are supplied as precursors (10Doull J.L. Singh A.K. Hoare M. Ayer S.W. J. Ind. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Rix U. Zheng J.T. Remsing L.L. Greenwell L. Yang K.Q. Rohr J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 4496-4497Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Until now, the only oxygenase gene identified in the jad biosynthetic cluster (Fig. 1a)is jadF, which is implicated in oxidative ring cleavage and displays strong sequence homologies with FAD- and NADPH-dependent monooxygenases (7Yang K.Q. Han L. Ayer S.W. Vining L.C. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Sequence analyses suggest that the two genes, jadG and jadH, immediately downstream of jadF also encode oxygenases. JadG resembles anthrone oxygenases such as ActVA-orf6 and TcmH, while JadH strongly resembles JadF in its amino acid sequence. Consequently, JadF and JadH are potential candidates for participation in oxidative ring B cleavage (7Yang K.Q. Han L. Ayer S.W. Vining L.C. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12, McVey, J. (1998) Characterization of the Downstream Genes for Jadomycin B Biosynthesis in Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230. M.Sc. dissertation, Dalhousie University, CanadaGoogle Scholar). In this work, we further investigated the functions of JadF, JadG and JadH by product profile analyses of their mutants, enzymatic assay and in vivo/in vitro bioconversion experiments. We demonstrate the requirement for the co-presence of JadF, JadG and JadH to completely convert UWM6 to jadomycin A and established JadH as a bifunctional oxygenase/dehydrase. S. venezuelae ISP5230 and the derived strains VS655 (jadF mutant) and VS662a (jadR2 mutant) have been described previously (7Yang K.Q. Han L. Ayer S.W. Vining L.C.

Escherichia coli ET12567 has been described by MacNeil et al. (14MacNeil D.J. Gewain K.M. Rudy C.L. Dezeny G. Gibbons P.H. MacNeil T. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar); other E. coli strains were from commercial sources; S. lividans TK24 was described by Hopwood et al. (15Hopwood D.A. Kieser T. Wright H.M. Bibb M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1982; 129: 2257-2269Google Scholar). Plasmid pWHM1238, described in Kulowski et al. (1999), was kindly provided by Dr. Ben Shen (8Kulowski K.

(2000), was kindly provided by Dr. Udo Wehmeier (16Doumith M. Weingarten P. Wehmeier U.F. Salah-Bey K. Benhamou B. Capdevila C. Michel J.M. Piepersberg W. Raynal M.C. Mol. Gen.

Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and Pfu DNA polymerase were purchased from Promega or Takara. Competent E. coli cells were prepared and transformed by standard procedures (17Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Laboratory, NY2001Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated from E. coli by the alkaline method (17Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Laboratory, NY2001Google Scholar). Cultures of S. venezuelae strains used for DNA extraction were grown in MYME medium (13Yang K.Q. Han L. Vining L.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6111-6117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 30 °C for 36 h; genomic DNA was isolated as described by Kieser et al. (18Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000Google Scholar). DNA was manipulated by standard procedures (17Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Laboratory, NY2001Google Scholar). Protoplasts of S. venezuelae were prepared and transformed as described previously (7Yang K.Q. Han L. Ayer S.W. Vining L.C. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). pJV69A was constructed by inserting a 7.2-kb XhoI fragment (with intact jadDFGHK and partial jadL) into pBluescript II KS(+). The jadFGH portion of pJV69A was re-sequenced; its revised sequence was deposited in GenBank™ (accession number AY773079). Related proteins were searched with BLASTP (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), and selected sequences were aligned with ClustalX (ftp-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/ClustalX/) (19Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). Disruption of jadH—To facilitate inactivation of this gene, a 6.0-kb BamHI fragment of S. venezuelae DNA containing jadFGHK was cloned in pHJL400, furnishing pJV77A. Construction of the jadH disruption plasmid involved removing an EcoRI/MluI fragment from pJV77A. The remaining fragment, consisting of the vector plus a 3.8-kb BamHI/MluI insert, was blunt-ended by treatment with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and religated to generate pJV91. Digestion of pJV91 with NcoI (internal to jadH) and ligation of the linear product to an apramycin resistance gene with NcoI ends yielded the two recombinant plasmids, pJV92A and pJV92B, which carried the apramycin resistance gene in opposite orientations. When both plasmids were introduced into S. venezuelae, only pJV92B gave transformants (VS667). Selection for an apramycin-resistant and thiostrepton-sensitive phenotype gave the jadH mutant VS668 (Fig. 2). In-frame Deletion of jadA—Two 1.5-kb fragments flanking jadA were obtained by PCR using primer pairs P1 and P2. For the fragment upstream of jadA, P1F (5′-CCCAAGCTTGCAGTGCCTGGCCGACCA-3′, HindIII) and P1R (5′-GGAATTCCATATGTCACGCGTTCGCCTCCCA-3′, NdeI) were used; for the fragment downstream of jadA, P2F (5′-GGAATTCCATATGAGCGCGTCCGTGGTG-3′, NdeI) and P2R (5′-CGGAATTCAGGCGGCGGCGACGGC-3′, EcoRI) were used. After digestion with appropriate enzymes, the two fragments were inserted into HindIII/EcoRI-digested pHJL400 to generate pHK400A. The latter was used to transform protoplasts of VS662a. Transformants were propagated on MYM (maltase, yeast extract, and malt extract; Ref. 6Han L. Yang K.Q. Ramalingam E. Mosher R.H. Vining L.C. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 3379-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) agar without thiostrepton selection for three generations; colonies from spores collected after non-selective propagation were picked for sensitivity to thiostrepton and examined for loss of jadomycin B production in cultures grown under conditions supporting biosynthesis of the antibiotic. The non-producing mutant was designated CH56. Evidence that the loss of jadomycin production in CH56 correlated with deletion of jadA was investigated by PCR using primers P3F (5′-GGCCACCCGCTTCTACAAC-3′) and P3R (5′-CGAAGGTGGAGCCGTATCC-3′) (Fig. 3). For mutants with disruptions in jadH, the genomic DNA was completely digested with PstI, fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a positively charged nylon membranes. The probe was a 552-bp KpnI/PshAI fragment from pJV69A labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP by the random priming method (Fig. 2). The genomic DNA from jadA deletion mutants was digested with XhoI and a 561-bp PstI/EcoRI fragment from pWHM1238 was labeled as a probe. Hybridization of probes with DNA fragments on the nylon membrane was detected by the chromogenic method using procedures described by Roche Diagnostics (Fig. 3). Filtered cultures of VS668 grown in d-galactose-l-isoleucine liquid medium containing 25 μg/ml apramycin as described by Doull et al. (10Doull J.L. Singh A.K. Hoare M. Ayer S.W. J. Ind.

Microbiology. 1996; 142: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was excised by SacI digestion, and the purified fragment was ligated into the SacI site of pUC19 to yield plasmid pUC19-jadF, in which the transcriptional direction of jadF is opposite to that of lacZ. pUC19-jadF was digested with EcoRI and XbaI to re-excise the insert, which was then cloned into EcoRI/XbaI-digested expression vector pUWL201 (16Doumith M. Weingarten P. Wehmeier U.F. Salah-Bey K. Benhamou B. Capdevila C. Michel J.M. Piepersberg W. Raynal M.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 264: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) to create pUWL201+jadF. Two fragments, 6.3 kb (KpnI) and 0.5 kb (PstI/KpnI) from pUWL201+jadF were ligated with a 4.9-kb (PstI/KpnI) fragment of pJV69A to generate pUWL2014, in which jadFGH is positioned downstream of the “ermE up” promoter of pUWL201. Introduction of pUWL2014 into S. lividans TK24 by standard procedures gave the transformant LC2014 (18Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000Google Scholar). Rabelomycin was isolated from a culture of VS655 as described previously (7Yang K.Q. Han L. Ayer S.W. Vining L.C. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 2,3-Dehydro-UWM6 was isolated from S. venezuelae mutant VS668 as described above. To obtain UWM6, S. lividans TK24 was transformed with pUWL1238. From cultures of the transformant (LC1238) grown as described earlier, UWM6 was obtained (8Kulowski K. Pienkowski E.W. Han L. Yang K.Q. Vining L.C. Hutchinson C.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1786-1794Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar); however, UWM6 was unstable and was partially converted to rabelomycin. LC1238 culture extracts used here as the substrate for bioconversion and enzyme assays were shown by HPLC to consist mainly of UWM6. CH56 —The in-frame deletion jadA mutant was cultured for jadomycin production by the procedure described by Doull et al. (10Doull J.L. Singh A.K. Hoare M. Ayer S.W. J. Ind. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) except that the culture medium was supplemented with 25 μg/ml apramycin. Putative substrates (UWM6, 2,3-dehydro-UWM6, and rabelomycin) were added to the cultures at the time (6 h after inoculation) they were stressed with 6% (v/v) ethanol. After another 24 h, the cultures were extracted with ethyl acetate and the extracts were evaporated in vacuo. The residues were analyzed by TLC, HPLC, and liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). LC2014 —seed cultures of LC2014 (containing jadFGH in pUWL2014) and LC2010 (containing pUWL201) were grown at 30 °C, 220 rpm for 24 h in YEME (18Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000Google Scholar) supplemented with thiostrepton (10 μg/ml). Mycelium was collected by centrifugation (3000 × g, 10 min) and transferred to d-galactose-l-isoleucine medium supplemented with UWM6 or 2,3-dehydro-UWM6. The cultures were incubated for 24 h and extracted with ethyl acetate. Cultures of LC2010 treated similarly to LC2014 served as controls. LC2014 was cultured in YEME with thiostrepton (10 μg/ml) at 30 °C, 220 rpm for 3 days. After the culture was harvested and diluted appropriately with sterilized water, mycelia were collected by centrifugation (3000 × g, 10 min) and washed with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10% glycerol twice. Then the mycelia were resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol) and kept on ice for 30 min. Cells were disrupted by sonication for 16 × 5 s pulses, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g) at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was fractionated by a 10-kDa ultrafiltration centrifugation tube and concentrated to about 1 ml. Protein concentration was monitored by Bradford dye-binding method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (2 ml) containing 1 mg of cell-free extracts protein, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, and 9.5), 40 μm FAD, 500 μm NADPH, 500 μm substrates (UWM6 or 2,3-dehydro-UWM6), and 5 mm isoleucine were incubated with gentle shaking at 30 °C for 6 h. The reactions were terminated by addition of 80 μl of 1 n HCl, and then the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. Cell-free extract of LC2010 was prepared with the same procedure as LC2014 and used as control. Plasmid pJV60 (containing jadF) was used as template for constructing the jadF overexpression plasmid (pRCR2). Plasmid pJV455 (containing jadFGH), constructed by inserting a 5.8-kb PstI fragment from pJV69A to pBluescript II SK(+), was used as template for constructing the jadH overexpression plasmids (pLMG1). The fragments containing jadF or jadH were generated by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase. For pRCR2, the primers 5′-GCCGAGGGATCCCGCTCATATGACGGAGCC-3′ (jadF forward, BamHI) and 5′-TCGAAGAGGTTGAATTCGGTCAGGTAGCCG-3′ (jadF reverse, EcoRI) were used; for pLMG1, the primers 5′-GCGCTCGCTGCAGTGAGCGCCGTGACCACCACC-3′ (jadH forward, PstI), and 5′-CCGCCGGAGAATTCGTCGTGGTCGTCACCGGGC-3′ (jadH reverse, EcoRI) were used. The genes jadF (1539 bp) and jadH (1626 bp) were inserted into the pRSETb overexpression vector, which contains the T7 promoter and an N-terminal His6-tag encoding sequence. Successful construction of the overexpression systems was confirmed by DNA sequencing and restriction analysis. Strains of E. coli BL21(DE3)plysS transformed with pRCR2 and pLMG1 were cultured at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol. When cultures had grown to A600 0.5-0.6, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm; growth was continued at 18-20 °C for up to 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min). The pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl (pH 8.0)) and kept on ice for 0.5 h before sonication (6 × 10 s). Protamine sulfate was added to the lysate, and the insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 0.5 h). The supernatant comprising His6-tagged proteins was loaded on a column of Sepharose-based TALON metal (Co2+) affinity resin previously treated with equilibration buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl (pH 7.0)). The column was washed with 20 volumes of equilibration buffer before purified proteins were recovered with elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 150 mm imidazole (pH 7.0)). Purified proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE, and their concentrations were estimated by the Bradford dye-binding method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). The monitoring of eluates by SDS-PAGE showed that two proteins of ∼54 and 57 kDa had been produced (Fig. 4a). Both of the two proteins were also identified by tryptic digestion and subsequent peptide matching of the fragments observed by electrospray ionization-MS with the data base sequence of the proteins. Reaction mixtures (1 ml) containing freshly purified oxygenase (1 μm), 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), FAD (4 μm), NADPH (1 μm), and substrate (400 μm) were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. Reactions were terminated by adding 40 μl of 1 n HCl (to pH 4.0) and then extracted with ethyl acetate. As controls, mixtures of all components except the substrate were treated in the same way. TLC was used as described earlier (7Yang K.Q. Han L. Ayer S.W. Vining L.C. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Jadomycins A and B, UWM6, 2,3-dehydro-UWM6, and rabelomycin were monitored by HPLC on a Waters 717 system with a Waters 2487 dual λ UV detector and an inertsil ODS-3 column (GL sciences, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm). The elution solvents were: water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent B). The percentage of solvent B (flow rate: 1.0 ml/min) changed linearly from 50 to 100% between 0 and 20 min, stayed at 100% for 3 min, and then decreased to 50% between 23 and 23.5 min. For LC-MS analysis, an Agilent 1100 system was used, maintaining the parameters described above for HPLC and for the electrospray ionization-MS component using Finnigan LCQ DecaXP ion trap mass spectrometry (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA) with a spray voltage of 4.5 kv and a heated transfer capillary temperature set to 275 °C. The mass spectrometer scanned from m/z = 100-600 in positive/negative ion mode. The amino acid sequences of JadF and JadH are similar (45.8% identity) and resemble those of other FAD-dependent aromatic hydroxylases, e.g. UrdE (44.7% identity with JadF and 54.9% identity with JadH) (7Yang K.Q.

For example, MtmOIV, postulated to be a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (22Prado L. Fernández E. Weiβbach U. Blanco G. Quirós L.M. Braña A.F. Méndez C. Rohr J. Salas J.A. Chem.

The oxygenase CmmOIV (39.0% identity with JadF and 37.5% with JadH) is suggested to function like MtmOIV in the gene cluster for biosynthesis of the aureolic acid polyketide chromomycin (24Menéndez N. Nur-e-Alam M. Bra[caron]na A.F. Rohr J. Salas J.A. Méndez C. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the oxygenase GrhO6 (35.3% identical to JadF and 36.4% to JadH) is postulated to catalyze ring cleavage in the rubromycin-like polyketide, griseorhodin (25Li A. Piel J. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Three motifs conserved in FAD- and NAD(P)H-dependent monooxygenases are found in JadF and JadH: a dinucleotide binding motif characterized by a Rossmann fold (GxGxxG/A) interacting with the adenosine of FAD (26Wieregna R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 27Vallon O. Proteins. 2000; 38: 95-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), a GD motif responsible for binding the FAD flavin moiety (28Eggink G. Engel H. Vriend G. Terpstra P. Witholt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and a DG motif involved in both FAD and NAD(P)H binding (Fig. 1) (29Eppink M.H.M. Schreuder H.A. Van Berkel W.J.H. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The overall sequence of JadG is consistent with a protein constructed from two halves (amino acids 1-112 and 113-225) sharing a high degree (22.8%) of sequence identity and implying an evolution event via gene duplication. The two halves are each similar to anthrone oxygenases such as ActVA-Orf6 (17.5 and 32.8% amino acid identity) (30Kendrew S.G. Hopwood D.A. Marsh E.N.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4305-4310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federici L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and TcmH (21.9 and 32.2% amino acid identity) (32Shen B. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6656-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting that JadG catalyzes similar monooxygenation in jadomycin biosynthesis. Replacement of the expected hybridization signal at 5.3 kb in wild-type S. venezuelae genomic DNA with the signal at 6.4 kb in DNA from the insertionally inactivated apramycin-resistant and thiostrepton-sensitive transformant were consistent with disruption of jadH in VS668 (Fig. 2b). Growth of the transformant under conditions promoting jadomycin production by the wild-type resulted in excretion of a yellow compound with RF 0.69 (TLC) and retention time 6.733 min (HPLC). Extraction, purification, and structure analysis of the metabolite suggested that it was 2,3-dehydro-UWM6 (6) (20Rix U. Wang C. Chen Y. Lipata F.M. Remsing Rix L.L. Greenwell L.M. Vining L.C. Yang K. Rohr J. ChemBioChem. 2005; 6: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To facilitate the choice of appropriate substrates for bioconversion experiments, a jadA in-frame deletion mutant (CH56) was constructed by deleting a 1.2-kb internal fragment from the jadA sequence in VS662a, a strain in which the regulation of jadomycin biosynthesis has been disturbed by inserting an apramycin resistance cassette into the jadR2 repressor gene (13Yang K.Q. Han L. Vining L.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6111-6117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phenotypically, the jadR2 mutant (VS662a) differs from the wild type in producing jadomycin B without external stimulation and in producing twice the yield of the wild type when stressed with ethanol. Since S. venezuelae strains derived from VS662a should potentially be more efficient than the wild-type in bioconversion assays, VS662a protoplasts transformed with pHK400A were screened for a thiostrepton-resistant phenotype. The strains selected were propagated for three generations on MYM agar. Of 24 thiostrepton-sensitive strains examined under growth conditions supporting jadomycin B production, 13 still produced this product, while 11 had lost the ability. PCR examination of the 11 clones proved jadA deletion occurred (Fig. 3b). The deletion of jadA was also verified by Southern blotting (Fig. 3c). One of the 11 mutants was chosen and designated CH56. HPLC analysis showed no jadomycin B production by CH56 in the first 24 h after ethanol treatment, but a small amount (about 3% of that in VS662a) was detected when the fermentation was prolonged to 48 h. The “leakage” phenomenon may be explained by a partial complementation of the jadA function by another ketosynthase α gene in S. venezuelae ISP5230. CH56 —UWM6, 2,3-dehydro-UWM6, and rabelomycin were tested as substrates for bioconversion by incubation with the culture of CH56 (jadA in-frame deletion mutant) and examination of the broths for recognizable products. HPLC analysis of the incubation mixture showed that 2,3-dehydro-UWM6 disappeared rapidly, and two new peaks, corresponding to jadomycin B and jadomycin A, appeared in a ratio similar to that in wild-type S. venezuelae ISP5230 (the titer of jadomycin A was 5-15% that of jadomycin B). The identities of the peaks (confirmed by LC-MS) indicated that 2,3-dehydro-UWM6 was efficiently converted to jadomycins. During incubation of UWM6 with strain CH56, the substrate peak disappeared completely, giving rabelomycin and small amounts of jadomycins A and B. The ratio between jadomycins A and B was also similar to that in wild-type S. venezuelae ISP5230. The low efficiency of this bioconversion might be due to the instability of the substrate, which is converted to rabelomycin by spontaneous dehydration and oxygenation (8Kulowski K. Pienkowski E.W. Han L. Yang K.Q. Vining L.C. Hutchinson C.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1786-1794Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, no jadomycins were detected when rabelomycin was the substrate, although the amount of rabelomycin decreased (Table I).Table IBioconversion assays in vivo and in vitroStrain/EnzymeSubstrateMain productsIn vivo/In vitroCH56UWM6Jadomycin A/BIn vivoCH562,3-Dehydro-UWM6Jadomycin A/BIn vivoCH56RabelomycinUnidentified productIn vivoLC2014UWM6Jadomycin A and rabelomycinIn vivoLC20142,3-Dehydro-UWM6Jadomycin AIn vivoLC2014UWM6Jadomycin A and rabelomycinIn vitroLC20142,3-Dehydro-UWM6Jadomycin A and dehydrorabelomycinIn vitroJadHUWM6RabelomycinIn vitroJadH2,3-Dehydro-UWM6DehydrorabelomycinIn vitroJadHrabelomycinRabelomycinIn vitro Open table in a new tab LC2014 —To elucidate the combined functions of JadFGH, UWM6 and 2,3-dehydro-UWM6 were used as substrates for conversion by LC2014 (jadFGH expressed).

This protein is a class II cholesterol oxidases, with the FAD cofactor covalently linked to the enzyme through the His69 residue. In this work, unfolding of wild-type cholesterol oxidase was compared with that of a H69A mutant, which does not covalently bind the flavin cofactor. The two protein forms do not show significant differences in their overall topology, but the urea-induced unfolding of the H69A mutant occurred at significant lower urea concentrations than wild-type (∼3 versus ∼5 m, respectively), and the mutant protein had a melting temperature ∼10–15 °C lower than wild-type in thermal denaturation experiments. The different sensitivity of the various spectroscopic features used to monitor protein unfolding indicated that in both proteins a two-step (three-state) process occurs. The presence of an intermediate was more evident for the H69A mutant at 2 m urea, where catalytic activity and tertiary structure were lost, and new hydrophobic patches were exposed on the protein surface, resulting in protein aggregation. Comparative analysis of the changes occurring upon urea and thermal treatment of the wild-type and H69A protein showed a good correlation between protein instability and the elimination of the covalent link between the flavin and the protein. This covalent bond represents a structural device to modify the flavin redox potentials and stabilize the tertiary structure of cholesterol oxidase, thus pointing to a specific meaning of the flavin binding mode in enzymes that carry out the same reaction in pathogenic versus non-pathogenic bacteria.

This covalent bond represents a structural device to modify the flavin redox potentials and stabilize the tertiary structure of cholesterol oxidase, thus pointing to a specific meaning of the flavin binding mode in enzymes that carry out the same reaction in pathogenic versus non-pathogenic bacteria. Bacterial cholesterol oxidase (CO, EC 1.1.3.6) is a monomeric bifunctional FAD-containing flavoenzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 3β-hydroxysteroids and the isomerization of the intermediate, Δ5–6-ene-3β-ketosteroid (cholest-5-en-3-one) to produce Δ3–4-ene-3β-ketosteroid (cholest-4-en-3-one). Bacteria that produce CO can be classified into two classes: non-pathogenic (e.g. Streptomyces and fast-growing Mycobacteria; these bacteria utilize cholesterol as their carbon source) and pathogenic bacteria (e.g. Rhodococcus equi and slow-growing Mycobacteria). Pathogenic bacteria require CO for infection of the host macrophage probably because of its ability to alter the physical structure of the membrane by converting cholesterol into cholest-4-en-3-one. The crystal structure of COs belonging to two distinct structural classes (1Sampson N.S. Vrielink A. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have been solved by the Vrielink laboratory (2Vrielink A. Lloyd L.F. Blow D.M. J. Mol.

Microbiol. 2003; 41: 3241-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have their cofactor tightly but non-covalently bound to the enzyme. A second CO from Brevibacterium sterolicum classified as type II, is completely different. In this enzyme the cofactor is covalently linked to the protein via a bond between the 8-methyl group of the isoalloxazine ring and the ND1 atom of His69. Although COs of class I and II share the same catalytic activity, they show no sequence homology, differ in the flavin binding mode, and have significant differences in their redox and kinetic properties (6Gadda G. Wels G. Pollegioni L. Zucchelli S. Ambrosius D. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 7Pollegioni L. Wels G. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Many proteins use tightly bound cofactors to perform their biological functions, and up to now some 30 flavoenzymes have been reported to contain flavin covalently linked to a histidine, cysteine, or tyrosine side chain (8Mewies M. McIntire W.S. Scrutton N.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 9Edmondson D.E. Newton-Vinson P. Antioxidants & Redox Signaling. 2001; 3: 789-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The redox properties of the flavin are modulated through a specific protein microenvironment, to suit the particular requirements of the redox reaction. Previous studies on the C406A mutant of monoamine oxidase suggested that covalent flavin binding markedly improves the structural stability of the enzyme (9Edmondson D.E. Newton-Vinson P. Antioxidants & Redox Signaling. 2001; 3: 789-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 10Nandigama R.K. Edmondson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20527-20532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The covalent CO we studied here belongs to the family of vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (11Fraaije M.W. Van Berkel W.J. Benen J.A. Visser J. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 206-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), which contains a fold proposed to favor covalent flavinylation. To elucidate the function of covalent flavin linkage in this CO, we studied a mutant in which the His69 → Ala exchange prevents formation of the histidyl-FAD bond (the numbering refers to the mature protein, and this residue corresponds to His121 in the full-length enzyme) (12Motteran L. Pilone M.S. Molla G. Ghisla S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18024-18030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The mutant retains catalytic activity and carries out also the isomerization step of the intermediate cholest-5-en-3-one to the final product, but the non-covalent flavin binding results in a 35-fold decrease in turnover rate and in a much lower flavin midpoint redox potential (–204 mV, compared with –101 mV for wild-type). We concluded that the flavin 8α-linkage to a (N1)histidine is a pivotal factor in the modulation of the redox properties of this CO to increase its oxidative power (12Motteran L. Pilone M.S. Molla G. Ghisla S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18024-18030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In view of the biotechnological applications, there is considerable interest in this flavoenzyme. CO is widely used for determining serum cholesterol levels in the diagnosis of arteriosclerosis and other lipid disorders (13MacLachlan J. Wotherspoon A.T. Ansell R.O. Brooks C.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 72: 169-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Also, CO is a potent larvicidal and has been developed as an insecticide against Coeloptera (14Corbin D.R. Grebenok R.J.

Furthermore, CO homologues are secreted by life-threatening pathogens (R. equi, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobaterium leprae) that have been proposed to play a role in the lysis of macrophages and leukocytes leading to the characteristic lesions found in infected humans and animals (15Navas J. Gonzalez-Zorn B. Ladron N. Garrido P. Vazquez-Boland J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In particular, R. equi is an opportunistic pathogen in humans, causing tuberculosis-like lung infections in severely immunocompromised patients, such as human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals. As these enzymes are unique to bacteria, they represent a potential target for a new class of antibiotics. In the framework of a project devoted to the analysis of flavoenzyme structure and function, we are using CO from B. sterolicum as a model for protein folding and coenzyme binding studies. The cDNA coding for the protein has been synthesized and can be efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli, 1L. Pollegioni, unpublished results. the structure of the wild-type enzyme is known (4Coulombe R. Yue K.Q. Ghisla S. Vrielink A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30435-30441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and that of the H69A mutant has been recently completed. 2A. Vrielink, personal communication. In this paper we dissect the contribution of the covalent link of the flavin cofactor on the stability and folding process of CO. Materials and Enzymes—Cholesterol and Thesit® (dodecyl poly(ethylene glycol ether)n, n = 9–10) were purchased from Roche Diagnostics. All other reagents were of the highest commercially available purity. Wild-type and H69A recombinant COs were obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Enzyme concentration was determined using the known extinction coefficients (16.1 and 13.4 mm–1 cm–1 for H69A and wild-type CO, respectively, at 445 nm) (12Motteran L. Pilone M.S. Molla G. Ghisla S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18024-18030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Enzymatic Activity—Cholesterol oxidase activity was assayed monitoring H2O2 production at 440 nm (ϵ440 = 13 mm–1 cm–1) in an enzyme-coupled assay with 10 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase and 16 mg/ml o-dianisidine as previously described (6Gadda G. Wels G. Pollegioni L. Zucchelli S. Ambrosius D. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 7Pollegioni L. Wels G. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was assayed in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1% (v/v) Thesit and 1% (v/v) propan-2-ol, at 25 °C. The effect of urea on enzyme activity was determined using the same spectrophotometric assay on protein samples previously incubated at 15 °C for 60–90 min in the presence of various denaturant concentrations. Absorption and Fluorescence Measurements—UV visible absorption spectra were recorded with a Jasco V-560 spectrophotometer in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. Flavin and protein fluorescence measurements at fixed temperatures were performed in a Jasco FP-750 instrument equipped with a thermostatted cell holder using a 1-ml cell. Tryptophan emission spectra were taken from 300 to 400 nm using excitation wavelengths of 280 or 298 nm. Flavin emission spectra were recorded from 475 to 600 nm using an excitation wavelength of 450 nm; 10-nm band widths were used for excitation and emission, respectively. Steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed at 15 °C in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 0.1 mg/ml protein concentration. All spectra were corrected by subtracting the emission of the buffer. Temperature-ramp experiments were performed using a software-driven, Peltier-based temperature controller, which allowed reproduction at the same temperature gradient (0.5 °C/min) used in circular dichroism and calorimetric studies. Fixed wavelength measurements were taken at 340 and 526 nm for tryptophan and flavin fluorescence, respectively. Circular dicroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a J-810 Jasco spectropolarimeter, also equipped with a software-driven Peltier-based temperature controller, and analyzed by means of Jasco software. Cell path was 1 cm for measurements above 250 nm, and 0.1 cm for measurements in the 190–250 nm region. Limited Proteolysis—Wild-type and H69A COs (0.37 mg/ml) were incubated at 25 °C in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, with 10 or 1% (w/w) trypsin in the presence of an urea concentration at which the inferred folding intermediate is formed (4 and 2 m for wild-type and mutant CO, respectively). For electrophoretic analysis, protein samples (7 μg) taken at various times after the addition of trypsin were diluted in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and boiled for 3 min. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, and the intensity of the protein bands were determined by densitometric analysis using Image Master 1D software (Amersham Biosciences). Kinetic data for protein fragment formation/degradation were fitted to either a single or a double exponential decay equation using KaleidaGraph™ (Sinergy Software). Size-exclusion chromatography of intact and proteolyzed COs was performed at room temperature on a Superdex 200 column using the Δkta chromatographic system (Amersham Biosciences), at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The eluant was 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.3 m potassium chloride. The column was calibrated with suitable standard proteins. N-terminal sequencing of proteolytic fragments was performed in an automated protein sequencer (Procise 492, Applied Biosystem). Calorimetry—Calorimetric measurements were carried out on 23 μm (1.5 mg/ml) protein in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, or in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. A third generation Setaram Micro-DSC apparatus was used, which is suitable for diluted solutions of biological macromolecules in the temperature range from –20 to 120 °C. Scan rates of 0.5 and 0.1 °C/min were used. Data were analyzed by means of the THESEUS software (16Barone G. Del Vecchio P. Fessas D. Giancola C. Graziano G. J. Therm. Anal. 1992; 38: 2779-2790Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The excess molar heat capacity <ΔCp> or CPE(T), i.e. the difference between the apparent molar heat capacity Cp(T) of the sample and the molar heat capacity of the “native state,” Cp,N(T), was recorded across the scanned temperature range. Cp,N(T) was obtained according to published procedures (17Freire E. Biltonen R.L. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 463-479Crossref Scopus (375) Google Scholar) by linear regression of experimental Cp(T) data in the pre-denaturation region (namely, for T < Ti, where Ti is the highest temperature at which only the native protein is present). The overall calorimetric denaturation enthalpy ΔdH was determined by integration of CPE(T) across the denaturation (Ti ÷ Tf) range, where Tf is the final temperature of the denaturation process, taking into account that the baseline has a sigmoidal trend across the same temperature range. Such a trend can be obtained by assigning a weight factor equal to the ratio incremental area/total area, drawn from the above integration, and iterating the overall process until convergence (16Barone G. Del Vecchio P. Fessas D. Giancola C. Graziano G. J. Therm. Anal. 1992; 38: 2779-2790Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As a first step of the iteration procedure, a straight line passing through Cp(Ti) and Cp(Tf) was used as the tentative baseline. All the thermograms reported in this paper were accordingly scaled. Because of the presence of aggregation phenomena, the heat capacity drop ΔdCp, which corresponds to the Cp change on passing from native to the denatured state across the signal was affected by a rather large error and was therefore not taken into account. The procedures described above leveled off any uncertainty about ΔdCp and allowed a reliable evaluation of CPE(T) and of the corresponding enthalpy. The theoretical models used to fit the experimental data were tested through the non-linear Levenberg-Marquardt method (18Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, Great Britain1989Google Scholar). Equilibrium Unfolding-Refolding and ANS 3The abbreviation used is: ANS, 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate. Binding Experiments— The unfolding equilibrium of CO was determined by following the changes in flavin and protein fluorescence, as well as in near- and far-UV CD signals, as detailed above. To establish the time required to reach equilibrium, the fluorescence intensity was measured as a function of time until no further changes are observed (60–90 min at 15 °C). Each point in urea denaturation curves was determined on individual samples, prepared by mixing appropriate volumes of a concentrated protein stock, 8 m urea in buffer, and 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5 or 8.5. ANS binding experiments were carried out at 15 °C and at 0.1 mg/ml protein concentration. For unfolding experiments, protein samples were incubated for 60 min at 15 °C in buffer containing different concentrations of urea, and ANS was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. ANS fluorescence emission spectra were recorded in the 450–600 nm range using an excitation wavelength of 370 nm. To investigate the refolding reaction, wild-type and H69A COs were incubated at various fixed concentrations of urea for 60 min at 15 °C and then were refolded by 10-fold dilution in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, at 15 °C. The refolding yield was measured by monitoring protein and flavin fluorescence (using the values for the native and fully denatured enzymes as reference), and by the recovery of enzymatic activity with respect to the untreated protein (12Motteran L. Pilone M.S. Molla G. Ghisla S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18024-18030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—In all cases, the unfolding curves were analyzed using a two-state mechanism. At first, unfolding curves for the N ↔ U transition were normalized to the apparent fraction of the unfolded form, FU, using the following equation (19Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 69-282Google Scholar), FU=(Y−YN)/(YU−YN)(Eq. 1) Y is the observed variable parameter, and YN and YU are the corresponding values for the native and fully unfolded conformations, respectively. The difference in free energy between the folded and the unfolded state, ΔG, was calculated by the following equation, ΔG=−RT InK=−RT In[FU/(1−FU)](Eq. 2) K is the equilibrium constant, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The data were analyzed assuming the free energy of unfolding or refolding, ΔG, to be linearly dependent on the urea concentration (denoted here by C) (20Pace C.N. Trends Biotechnol. 1990; 8: 93-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), ΔG=ΔGw−mC=m(Cm−C)(Eq. 3) ΔGw and ΔG represent the free energy of unfolding or refolding in the absence and presence of urea, respectively; Cm is the midpoint concentration of urea required for unfolding or refolding; m stands for the slope of the unfolding or refolding curve at Cm. A least-squares curve fitting analysis was used to calculate the values of ΔGw, m, and Cm by a software routine. Recombinant wild-type and H69A COs were purified as holoenzymes showing significant differences in their visible absorbance spectra because of the different binding mode of the flavin cofactor (12Motteran L. Pilone M.S. Molla G. Ghisla S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18024-18030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In particular, in addition to the main band at ∼445 nm (extinction coefficients of 16.1 and 13.4 mm–1 cm–1 for H69A and wild-type CO, respectively), the mutant CO shows a shoulder at ∼395 nm and lacks the band in the near-UV typical of the wild-type enzyme. Some other spectral properties related to protein folding also distinguish the two CO forms. Tryptophan fluorescence (following excitation at 280 nm) shows an emission maximum at 331 and 335 nm for wild-type and H69A CO, respectively, with a higher intensity for H69A than for wild-type CO, indicating a different relevance of quenching interactions between tryptophans and nearby side chains in the two proteins. The emission fluorescence of the FAD cofactor (following excitation at 450 nm) is also different for the two CO forms. The emission maximum is observed at 512 and 524 nm for wild-type and H69A CO, respectively, and the intensity of flavin fluorescence is 7-fold higher for the mutant protein. The lower fluorescence of the wild-type protein at pH 7.5 with respect to the H69A mutant may ensue from deprotonation of the 8α-histidylflavin, which results in a marked diminution in observed flavin fluorescence (21Kearney E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 865-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22De Francesco R. Edmondson D.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and occurs in the pKa range 5.4–6.2, depending on the source of CO used (22De Francesco R. Edmondson D.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). For both proteins, unfolding by urea is accompanied by an increase in both flavin and tryptophan fluorescence. Only tryptophan fluorescence had similar values in the two fully unfolded proteins (see below). Of course, unfolded wild-type CO does not release the flavin cofactor, which is covalently linked to His69, and thus the flavin fluorescence in the unfolded protein does not correspond to that of the free flavin, as is the case instead for the fully unfolded H69A mutant. Flavin fluorescence is indeed ∼12-fold lower in unfolded wild-type CO with respect to that of the fully unfolded mutant. Far-UV CD spectra of wild-type and H69A CO did not reveal any major difference in the features related to the secondary structure of the two proteins, whereas some minor differences are evident in the near-UV CD spectra (e.g. higher ellipticity at 285 nm for the H69A mutant and at 253 nm for the wild-type CO, respectively) pointing to a slight alteration of the tertiary structure in the mutant protein, as also indicated by the protein fluorescence data discussed above. Following the addition of ≥7 m urea, the signals observed in the far- and near-UV CD spectra of both wild-type and H69A CO were abolished. The stability of wild-type and H69A CO toward chaotropes was studied by equilibrium unfolding measurements by following different spectroscopic signals and the catalytic activity after equilibration in the presence of increasing urea concentration. Protein Fluorescence—The intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan residues was used as probe of the protein unfolding. Because in CO there are 19 tryptophans, the overall changes in fluorescence are indicative of global changes in protein structure. At increasing urea concentrations, the two CO forms showed a different increase in the intensity of the protein emission that was anyway complete at 7 m urea (Fig. 1A). Addition of urea also caused the emission maximum of tryptophan fluorescence to shift from 331 nm for wild-type and 335 nm for H69A CO to 354 nm at 7–8 m urea, a change that for both enzyme forms anticipated the change in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1A). The observed fluorescence red shift is considered a marker of the transfer of tryptophan side chains to a more polar environment upon protein unfolding (23Burstein E.A. Vedenkina N.S. Ivkova M.N. Photochem. Photobiol. 1973; 18: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Plots of changes in the intensity of protein fluorescence at equilibrium as a function of the urea concentration apparently suggest a simple two-state transition (Fig. 1A). The free energy of unfolding, ΔG, was calculated according to Equation 2. The free energy of unfolding in the absence of the denaturant (ΔGw) can be obtained by extrapolation of ΔG to 0 denaturant concentration using Equation 3 (see Table I). For both COs, changes in the wavelength of emission maximum at increasing urea concentrations were different from those of protein fluorescence intensity, and occurred at lower urea concentrations (Cm of 3.0 and 1.9 m for wild-type and H69A CO, respectively). This indicates that the overall urea-induced denaturation of CO might be a more complex process, pointing to the presence of possible unfolding intermediates.Table IComparison of thermodynamic parameters for urea-induced unfolding of wild-type and H69A COs at 15 °C, monitored by measurement of protein and flavin fluorescence (excitation (Exc) at 280 and 450 nm, respectively) and by CD at 291 and 220 nmWild-typeH69AFluorescenceCDFluorescenceCDExc. 280 nmExc. 450 nmNearFarExc. 280 nmExc. 450 nmNearFarΔGw (kJ/mol)16.112.523.327.06.45.715.610.6m (kJ)3.32.74.24.92.11.64.53.0YN812.96.4-27.51001511.1-29.7YU31515.9-0.7-6.5337185-0.2-6.8ΔY23413.0-7.121.0237170-11.322.9Cm (M)4.9 (3.0)-4.1aValues determined from the loss of catalytic activity.4.85.55.53.1 (1.9)-1.7aValues determined from the loss of catalytic activity.3.53.33.5pH 8.5bValues determined at pH 8.5.5.5 (4.1)3.0 (1.6)a Values determined from the loss of catalytic activity.b Values determined at pH 8.5. Open table in a new tab Flavin Fluorescence—Increasing urea concentrations had a different effects on flavin fluorescence in the two proteins. Flavin fluorescence of the H69A mutant at increasing urea concentrations paralleled the increase observed for protein fluorescence (see Fig. 1, A and B, and Table I), and attained values similar to that of the free flavin at ∼7 m urea. All together, both protein and flavin fluorescence are indicative of a two-state process for both proteins, and do not provide direct evidence for an unfolding intermediate. The effect of increasing urea concentrations on the protein and flavin fluorescence signals of wild-type and H69A CO was also investigated at pH 8.5, where the native enzymes retain their catalytic activity in full. As reported in Table I, the increase in pH resulted in a shift of the unfolding curve toward higher Cm values (relative increase, 0.6–1.1 m) for wild-type CO, whereas unfolding of the H69A mutant was affected to a much more limited extent (relative increase, 0.1–0.3 m). CD Spectra—When urea-induced loss of secondary structural elements was monitored by following the changes in ellipticity at 220 nm (Fig. 2A), the CD signal of wild-type and H69A CO showed a different sensitivity to the chaotrope. Loss of the 220-nm signal started at a concentration of urea >1.5 m for the mutant protein, but only at ≥4.0 m urea for wild-type. Addition of urea also has a different effect on the tertiary structure of wild-type and H69A CO, as shown by the change in CD signals at 291 nm in Fig. 2B. In both cases, a two-state transition was observed, giving Cm values close to those observed in protein and flavin fluorescence studies (Table I). Thus, the observed transitions correspond to loss of the secondary and tertiary structures and reflect a disruption of the overall protein structure because of conversion of the folded protein into an unfolded state. Such a transition was observed at significantly lower denaturant concentrations for mutant than for wild-type CO. ANS Fluorescence—The hydrophobic fluorescent probe ANS was used to probe the exposition of buried hydrophobic regions in CO at increasing urea concentrations. Binding of this probe to solvent-accessible clusters of non-polar side chains in proteins results in a marked increase in its fluorescence, and is accompanied by a blue-shift in its emission fluorescence spectrum. The steady-state fluorescence intensity of ANS significantly increased in the presence of both CO forms in their native state, reaching similar values, indicating that similar hydrophobic patches are exposed in both proteins in native conditions. The exposition of hydrophobic regions upon loosening of the protein tertiary structure during the unfolding process was investigated by following the binding of ANS to the two CO forms at increasing urea concentrations. At first, both proteins were titrated with ANS in the presence of various urea concentrations, allowing determination of the change in fluorescence emission intensity at saturating ANS concentration (ΔF), the apparent Kd for ANS binding, and the ratio between these two parameters (ΔF/Kd) (24Caldinelli L. Iametti S. Barbiroli A. Bonomi F. Piubelli L. Ferranti P. Picariello G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol.

Increases in THBS1 expression have been liked to disease states including tumor progression, atherosclerosis, and arthritis. The present study focuses on the effects of thrombin activation of the G-protein-coupled, protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) on THBS1 gene expression in the microvascular endothelium. Thrombin-induced changes in gene expression were characterized by microarray analysis of ∼11,000 different human genes in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1).

THBS1 is important not only in cancer progression but also in inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (12Vallejo A.N. Mugge L.O. Klimiuk P.A. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2947-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions basal THBS1 expression is negligible. However, increased THBS1 expression has been linked to pathophysiological states such as atherosclerotic lesions (13Wight T.N. Raugi G.J. Mumby S.M. Bornstein P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1985; 33: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), vascular smooth muscle cell hyperplasia (14Raugi G.J. Mullen J.S. Bark D.H. Okada T. Mayberg M.R. Am. J.

Pathol. 1992; 140: 357-364PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which THBS1 is up-regulated in disease states, however, is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that thrombin, a key player involved in coagulation, inflammation, and wound healing as well as in disease states such as atherosclerosis, can regulate THBS1 expression in endothelial cells. Thrombin activates a unique class of G-protein-coupled receptors called protease-activated receptors (PARs) by binding to and cleaving the amino-terminal exodomain of the receptor to unmask a new terminus that functions as a tethered ligand, binding intramolecularly to the body of the receptor (16Vu T.K.

However, differences between endothelial cell types in cellular function and signaling are evident. For example, macro- and microvascular endothelial cells show heterogeneity and differences both in their signaling activities and protein expression (30Lidington E.A. Moyes D.L. McCormack A.M.

To study changes in transcription that result from thrombin simulation in microvascular endothelial cells, we have chosen to conduct studies in the human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line (HMEC-1). HMEC-1 maintain a similar phenotype to non-transformed HMECs (34Unger R.E. Krump-Konvalinkova V. Peters K. Kirkpatrick C.J. Microvasc.

Our experiments on microvascular endothelial cells address the possible roles of THBS1 in processes involving these cells such as neoangiogenesis in cancer and wound healing or tissue repair after or coincidental with inflammation. Here we report the effects of thrombin on THBS1 gene expression in HMEC-1 using a microarray-based approach. We found THBS1 to be up-regulated both in mRNA and secreted protein levels in response to thrombin. Additionally, thrombin-induced up-regulation of THBS1 was pertussis toxin-sensitive, indicating a Gi/o signaling component. Inhibition of protein kinase C also inhibited thrombin-induced THBS1 expression, implicating a Gq-mediated signaling component. This pathway demonstrates a potential mechanism by which THBS1 may be up-regulated at sites of vascular injury and in disease states. Reagents—All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. α-Thrombin, bisindolylmaleimide I hydrochloride (Bis I), pertussis toxin, and Y-27632 were purchased from Calbiochem. The agonist peptide TFLLRNKPDK (TK) was purchased from GL Biochem (Shanghai) Ltd. Endothelial Cell Culture—In the present studies a human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line that was transformed using SV-40 was used (HMEC-1; obtained from Dr. E. Ades (Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA)). The cells were maintained in MCDB 131 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin (5000 units/ml; 5000 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (500 μg/ml), epidermal growth factor (0.01 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm) in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/ml and subcultured after detachment with 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA. All of the studies utilized cell passages 15–20. Primary cultures of HUVECs were grown in medium 199 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, endothelial mitogen, penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin B, and heparin. Passage 2-3 HUVECs were plated in 48-well plates and used after confluent. HMEC-1 Treatment and RNA Isolation—Cells were grown to 95% confluence, switched to serum-free medium containing 0.03% bovine serum albumin, and incubated for 3 h. Cells were then treated with either 86 nm (10 units/ml) human thrombin or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS)) (control samples) and incubated for additional 90 min or 6 or 12 h. Afterward, cell monolayers were rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS followed by the addition of the lysis buffer (RLT buffer from RNAeasy Midi kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA), cell scraping, disruption, and homogenization. Total RNA enriched in mRNA was isolated using the RNAeasy Midi kit following the manufacturer's protocol. Only RNA samples with an A260/280 ratio > 1.8 and no visible degradation by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining were used for microarray hybridizations and real-time (RT)-PCR. Synthesis of Fluorescent cDNA and Hybridization to Microarray Slides—Microarray analyses were performed by the Vanderbilt Microarray Shared Resource on a fee-for-service basis. Briefly, 30 μg of total RNA from both control and thrombin-treated samples were reverse-transcribed using SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), incorporating Cy5-dUTP into the control sample cDNA and Cy3-dUTP into the thrombin-treated sample cDNA. The labeled cDNA probes were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The purified cDNA was then mixed with a hybridization buffer containing 10 μg of poly(A) RNA, 25% formamide, 5× SSC (0.75 m NaCl and 0.075 m sodium citrate), and 0.1% SDS, denaturated and hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C on a 11,000 human cDNA microarray. The cDNAs imprinted in these arrays are available from Research Genetics. For detailed information about the microarray used in these experiments and the genes represented in the array refer to array.mc.vanderbilt.edu. After hybridization, slides were washed sequentially for 5 min each in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1× SSC, and 0.1× SSC. After drying, slides were immediately scanned for fluorescence emission from each spot on the array at 532 and 635 nm for Cy3 and Cy5, respectively. Normalization—Fluorescent intensities in each channel, Cy5 and Cy3, for each spot were quantified using GenPix Pro 5.0 from Axon Instrument, Inc. (Union City, CA). The resulting data were then normalized, filtered, and analyzed using GeneSpring 6.1, Silicon Genetics (Redwood City, CA). Experiments were normalized to a signal ratio, and two-color normalizations automatically displayed all measurements per spot-intensity-dependent (Lowess) if more than 100 genes per region divided by control channel if fewer than 100 genes per region. The cutoff used was 10 in raw data or 20% of data used for smoothing. Filtering—To determine statistically significant data points from the 11,409 genes tested, the data set was filtered using a t test p value test performed by GeneSpring (Silicon Genetics). GeneSpring correlated the t test values with Student's t distribution chart with n – 1 degrees of freedom to yield a significance value (p value). Data were then filtered by the p values to include only data that had a p value ≤0.005; this displayed only the normalized mean gene intensities that differed from 1. Any coincidental data that could have passed the first filtration was removed by using a multiple testing correction based on Bonferroni's inequality. This statistical correction helped to further limit the chance of false positives to be no more than p value ≤0.005 by multiplying each nominal p value by N (the total number of genes). Clustering—A k-means clustering algorithm provided by the Gene-Spring software was implemented to divide the genes of interest into groups based on their expression patterns. The k-means clusters were constructed so that the average behavior in each group was distinct from any of the other groups. Analyzing the time series experiment this way, unique classes of genes that were up-regulated in a time-dependent manner were identified. The k-means clustering algorithm utilized by GeneSpring first divided the genes of interest into a user-defined number (k) of equal-sized groups based on the order in the selected gene list. Four clusters were chosen. Next, the program created centroids (in expression space) at the average location of each group of genes. Choosing to proceed through 1000 iterations, the genes were reassigned to the group with the closest centroid. The standard correlation algorithm was chosen for the similarity measure. After all of the genes had been reassigned, the location of the centroids was recalculated, and the process was repeated until the maximum number of iterations had been reached. Promoter Analysis—The Genomatix software Suite (Munich, Germany) was used to predict and analyze promoter regions. Gene2Promoter was used to extract promoter regions for the corresponding genes of each cluster. Common frameworks were then found using the GEMS Launcher task “definition of common framework” using the complete vertebrate matrix library. FrameWoker runs with different quorum constraint parameters were performed; 40 or 30% of input sequences had to contain the framework. ElDorado using “Annotation and Analysis” was subsequently used to analyze the promoter regions of MYC, EGR1 since they did not fall into a common framework. Literature Mining—Genomatix Bibliosphere was used to mine the literature for co-citations between each of the 65 genes from the filtered list. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Universal RT reagents and SYBR Green PCR Master mix were purchased from ABI (Branchburg, NJ). Total RNA (1.0 μg) was reverse-transcribed using random hexamers with Universal RT. Reagents were incubated for 10 min at room temperature then 30 min at 42 °C followed by 5 min at 99 °C and 5 min at 55 °C. SYBR Green PCR Master mix was used on an i-Cycler instrument (Bio-Rad) to amplify human cDNAs as well as the cDNA for glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as the internal control. All primers used for real-time semiquantitative PCR were designed using Beacon Designer II (Premierbiosoft). Semiquantitative RT-PCR reactions were carried out in a total volume of 50.0 μl containing 5 μlof cDNA with the following thermocycling steps: 95 °C for 8.5 min, then 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 61.5 °C for 1 min, and 95 °C for 2.0 min then 55 °C for 2 min followed by melting curve data collection with 201 cycles of 0.2 °C/8 s temperature escalation and analysis. Specificity and sensitivity of PCR assays were tested with amplification of target cDNAs in serially diluted total RNA samples. Amplicon signals for each target cDNA strongly correlated with serial dilutions of each RNA sample. Data analysis and calculations were done following the 2–ΔΔCT method (35Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123424) Google Scholar). Each sample was assayed in duplicate. Primer concentration and annealing temperature were optimized for highly specific and reproducible detection of SERPINE1, tissue plasminogen activator (PLAT), THBS1, PAR-1, PAR-2, MYC, EGR1 β-actin, and GAPDH RNA by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Primers—Primers used for semiquantitative real time PCR were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA): SER-PINE1 antisense, 5′-AAT GTT GGT GAG GGC AGA GAG-3′, and SERPINE1 sense, 5′-CAT TAC TAC GAC ATC CTG GAA CTG-3′; PLAT antisense, 5′-GGT CTG GAG AAG TCT GTA GAG-3′, and PLAT sense, 5′-CCT AGA CTG GAT TCG TGA CAA-3′; THBS1 antisense, 5′-CTG ATC TGG GTT GTG GTT GTA-3′, and THBS1 sense, 5′-CCT GTG ATG ATG ACG ATG A-3′; PAR-1 sense, 5′-ACC CGC AGA AGT CAG GAG A-3′, and PAR-1 antisense, 5′-GCC GCA CAG ACT GAA GCA-3′; PAR-2 sense, 5′-ACT CCA GGA AGA AGG CAA ACA-3′, and PAR-2 antisense, 5′-TGG TCT GCT TCA CGA CAT ACA-3′; MYC sense, 5′-GCC CAC TGG TCC TCA AGA G-3′, and MYC antisense, 5′-CGG TTG TTG CTG ATC TGT CTC-3′; EGR1 sense, 5′-AGG ACA GGA GGA GGA GAT GG-3′, and EGR1 antisense, 5′-GGA AGT GGG CAG AAA GGA TTG-3′; β-actin sense, 5′-GCA AGC AGG AGT ATG ACG AGT-3′, and β-actin antisense, 5′-AAG AAA GGG TGT AAC GCA ACT AAG 3′; GAPDH antisense, 5′-CGC CCA ATA CGA CCA AAT3′, and GAPDH sense, 5′-AGT CAG CCG CAT CTT CTT3′. ELISA Assay of THBS1 in HMEC-1 Culture Medium—The 96-well plates were coated with THBS1 (0.1 μg/ml) purified from human platelets (Hematologic Technologies, Inc., Essex Junction, VT) overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed twice with PBS containing 0.02% NaN3 and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 3 h at room temperature. After the plates were washed twice with PBS containing 0.02% NaN3, 100 μl of ELISA buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.02% NaN3) containing rabbit anti-human THBS1 polyclonal antibodies (1:1,000 dilution) (Athens Research and Technology, Athens, GA) and either various concentrations (0.01–5 μg/ml) of purified human THBS1 (standard curve) or cell culture medium was added to each well and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Then the plates were washed twice with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 0.02% NaN3 and an additional 2 times with PBS containing 0.02% NaN3. Phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1:1,000 dilution) (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) diluted in ELISA buffer were added and allowed to incubate for 3 h at room temperature. The plates were then washed as above, and the substrate solution (pNPP Microwell Substrate System; Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories) was added and incubated for 1–3 min until a yellow color developed. The reaction was stopped by the addition 5% EDTA. Absorbance at 410 nm was determined on a plate reader (Molecular Device, Union City, CA). Each ELISA was carried out in triplicate and repeated at least two additional times. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Transendothelial Electrical Resistance—In vitro barrier dysfunction was monitored by electric cell-substrate impedance sensor (36Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Del Vecchio P.J. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Gold electrodes were purchased from Applied BioPhysics (Troy, NY). Wells were coated in 0.1% gelatin before being wetted by culture media. After treatment, cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well and allowed to recover 24 h. The small and larger counter electrodes were connected to a phase-sensitive lock-in amplifier. A constant current of 1 μA was applied by a 1 V, 4000 Hz AC signal connected serially to 1 megaohm resistor between the small and large counter electrodes. The voltage between the small electrode and the large counter electrode was monitored by a lock-in amplifier, stored, and processed by a personal computer. The same computer controlled the output of the amplifier and switched the measurement to different electrodes in the course of the experiment. Before the experiments the monolayers were serumstarved 18 h. Cells were pretreated with a sufficient concentration of Y-27632 (25 μm) for complete inhibition of Rho kinase (ROCK) for 3 h before stimulation by 10 nm thrombin. Pretreatment did not affect monolayer absolute resistance. [32P] ADP Ribosylation—Complete ribosylation of Gαi/o by pertussis toxin was determined as previously described (37McCarthy S.A. Bicknell R.

Briefly, cells were grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes and treated with 0.1 μg/ml pertussis toxin (PTX) for 3.0 h. Plasma membranes were isolated and subjected to a second round of ADP-ribosylation in vitro in the presence of radiolabeled nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ([32P] NAD) Amersham Biosciences to determine the amount of toxin substrate remaining. After two rinses with phosphate-buffered saline, membranes were harvested in ice-cold TE buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysate was homogenized by titration seven times through a 25-gauge needle. Cellular debris was removed by low speed centrifugation (500 × g for 10 min). Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes, and membranes were precipitated by centrifugation (40,000 × g for 60 min). Membranes were resuspended in 120 μl of TE buffer, and total protein was determined using BCA protein assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocols. PTX was activated by incubation in 25 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37 °C. 40 μg of purified membranes was incubated with 5 μg/ml PTX in reaction buffer (2.5 μm NAD, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 10 mm thymidine, 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and 25 μCi/ml [32P]NAD) in a total volume of 200 μl. Reactions were allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 60 min. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 20 μl of ice-cold 100% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Membranes were precipitated by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 20 min) and resuspended in 15 μl of 4× Laemmli loading buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Thrombin Consistently Up-regulates the Expression THBS1 and Other Genes in HMEC-1—To identify candidate genes whose expression is modulated by thrombin stimulation in microvascular endothelial cells, analyses using a microarray were performed. The cDNA library used to make the microarray, developed by Research Genetics, consists of ∼11,000 different human genes. HMEC-1 cultures were stimulated with a saturating concentration of thrombin, 86 nm (10 units/ml). Total RNA was then isolated from treated and control cells at 1.5, 6, and 12 h after thrombin stimulation. Control and treated cDNAs were simultaneously hybridized to the microchip. The raw data obtained was then quantified, normalized, and filtered according to criteria outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Of the ∼11,000 genes analyzed, only 65, including THBS1, showed consistent and statistically meaningful differences in expression when cells were treated by thrombin. Fig. 1A is a heat-map representation of the expression patterns of the 65 candidate genes (for a complete list of the genes, accession numbers and numeric -fold increases see the supplemental data) All 65 genes identified were up-regulated at each point of the time course. There were no statistically meaningful genes whose expression was suppressed. Each gene was then clustered into four groups according to expression profiles using a k-means clustering algorithm. Fig. 1B is an expression time-course of the average of all members of each cluster, revealing the general trend of the cluster. Cluster-1 consisted of 32 different genes including: PLAT, natural killer cell transcript 4 (NK4) (40Martin T.A. Mansel R.E. Jiang W.G. J. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W1989123847,"Shiga-like toxin I (Slt-I) is a ribosome-inactivating protein that undergoes retrograde transport to the endoplasmic reticulum to exert its cytotoxic effect on eukaryotic cells. Its catalytically active A1 domain subsequently migrates from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen to the cytoplasm. To study this final retrotranslocation event, a suicide assay was developed based on the cytoplasmic expression and ER-targeting of the cytotoxic Slt-I A1 fragment in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Expression of the Slt-I A1 domain (residues 1–251) with and without an ER-targeting sequence was lethal to the host and demonstrated that this domain can efficiently migrate from the ER compartment to the cytosol. Deletion analyses revealed that residues 1–239 represent the minimal A1 segment displaying full enzymatic activity. This fragment, however, accumulates in the ER lumen when directed to this compartment. The addition of residues 240–251 restores the translocation property of the A1 chain in yeast. However, single mutations within this region do not significantly alter this function in the context of the 251-residue long A1 domain or affect the toxicity of the resulting Slt-I variants toward Vero cells in the context of the holotoxin. Since this mechanism of retrotranslocation is common to other protein toxins lacking a peptide motif similar in sequence to residues 240–251, the present results suggest that the ER export mechanism may involve the recognition of a more universal structural element, such as a misfolded or altered peptide domain localized at the C terminus of the A1 chain (residues 240–251) rather than a unique ER export signal sequence.

Sandvig K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10817-10821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The A1 domain remains associated with the A2/B subunits complex by virtue of a disulfide bond between cysteines 242 and 261. This disulfide bond is ultimately reduced in the ER lumen, liberating the enzymatic A1 domain that is subsequently retrotranslocated to the cytosol. The N-glycosidase activity of the A1 fragment depurinates a single adenosine residue at position 4324 in the 28 S rRNA inhibiting protein synthesis and subsequently leading to cell death (9Endo Y. Tsurugi K. Yutsudo T. Takeda Y. Ogasawara T. Igarashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the catalytic domain of Slt-I and other ERTs is exported from the ER lumen to the cytosol remains poorly defined. Proteolysis of the Slt-I A chain to an A1 fragment is a required event for toxicity to occur in mammalian cells (10Lea N. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 999-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Proteolysis exposes a hydrophobic peptide present in the A chain of Slt-I and other ERTs, an event that may facilitate its interaction with ER-resident proteins or the ER membrane (11Menikh A. Saleh M.T. Gariepy J. Boggs J.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15865-15872Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Saleh M.T. Ferguson J. Boggs J.M. Gariepy J.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2836-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, studying the role of this region in retrotranslocation in isolation of other processes of retrograde traffic and processing remains challenging in the context of cell-based assays. Yeast represents an attractive model for analyzing how the enzymatic A1 domain of Slt-I is able to escape from the lumen in the ER and kill the host cell. We report the development of a suicide assay in yeast where the fully active enzymatic A1 fragment of Slt-I is rapidly targeted to the ER before it can accumulate in the cytosol. The ability of the Slt-I A1 fragment to subsequently retrotranslocate to the cytosol from the ER is lethal to the host and was the basis of a screen to define a region of the toxin involved in this relocation process. This yeast assay was used to identify a C-terminal region of the Slt-I A1 fragment involved in retrotranslocation. Plasmids and Strains—pRSATT was created by amplifying two regions of the GAL1 promoter from pRS854 and cutting them into the multiple cloning site of pRS316. The first region was created with a sense primer (STATA2, GAG AGA GAA TTC tac gct taa ctg ctc att gc) complementary to the sequence upstream of the GAL4 repeats and an antisense primer (ATATA2, GAG AGA GGA TCC GAG AGA GCA TGC gtt aat aga tca aaa atc atc gct tcg ctg) complementary to the sequence around the TATA element of the GAL1 promoter. This construct resulted in a product with an upstream EcoRI cloning site (underlined) and a downstream BamHI site (with a nested SphI site, both underlined), which was cloned into pRS316 between EcoRI and BamHI (creating an intermediate vector). The second region was created with a sense primer (SsphI, GAG AGA GCA TGC gta aat gca aaa act gca taa cca c) complementary to the TATA region of the GAL1 promoter and an antisense primer (AbamHI, GAG AGA GGA TCC ggg gtt ttt tct cct tga cg) complementary to the -1 region of the GAL1 promoter. The resulting product incorporated an upstream SphI site and a downstream BamHI site (both underlined) and was subsequently cloned into the intermediate vector containing the first fragment between SphI and BamHI. The final vector pRSATT-ER was created by cloning an ER-targeting sequence into the BamHI site of pRSATT. The sequence was created by gene synthesis from two complementary primers (fER, GAG AGA AGA TCT atg atg aag aaa aac aat gcg tta gca cta gcg ctt gcc ctt gcg cta gca ctg gct ttg gcc ctg gcc and rER, GAG AGA GGA TCC cgc gtt ggc ggt gcc tag cgc aag tgc aag cgc tag tgc taa cgc taa ggc cag ggc caa agc cag) with BglII and BamHI sites, respectively (both underlined). The primers were annealed and extended in a PCR reaction and subcloned into pBLUESCRIPT. The insert was then cut out with BglII and BamHI and cloned into the BamHI site of pRSATT. DNA cloning was carried out in the Escherichia coli strain DH5 [F-.80dlacZ M15 (lacZYA-argF) U169 deoR recA1 endA1 hsdR17 (rK-, mk+) supE44- thi-1 gyrA96 relA1). The wild-type yeast strain W303a was provided by James Friesen (Banting and Best Department of Medical Research, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada). RSY1293 and 1295 strains were obtained from Randy Schekman (Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California at Berkeley). Construction of Yeast Expression Vectors Encoding Slt-I A—Cassettes encoding portions of the Slt-I A chain coding sequence were cloned into pRSATT and pRSATT-ER between BamHI and SacI. These cassettes were all generated by PCR using the sense primer P1 in combination with the antisense primers (D1 through D13). The primers and corresponding products are shown in Table I. The overexpression plasmids (for the immunoprecipitation experiments) were created by cloning the wild-type Gal1 promoter into pRS416 between EcoRI and BamHI (creating pRS416Gal). The BglII-BamHI insert (coding for the ER-targeting sequence used to make pRSATT-ER) was then cloned into the BamHI site of pRS416Gal creating pRS416GalER. Cassettes coding for N-terminally myc-tagged and catalytically inactive (DT) A1 variants were generated by PCR using the sense primer P2 in combination with D1 and D6 (1–251 and 1–239 fragments, respectively) and cloned into pRS416Gal and pRS416GalER between BamHI and SacI. Thirty cycles of amplification (denature 94 °C, 30 s; anneal 58 °C, 30 s; extension 72 °C, 1 min) were carried out with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences thermal cycler and Pwo polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The PCR products and vectors were cut with BamHI and SacI (Roche Applied Science) and cloned using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs).Table IPrimers used in this study to construct expression vectorsProductSenseP1GAG AGA GGA TCC ATG aag gaa ttt acc tta gacP2GAG AGA GGA TCC ATG gag caa aag ctc att tct gaa gag gac ttg aag gaa ttt acc tta gacmyc-taggedAntisenseD1GAG AGA GAG CTC TCA CTA tct ggc aac tcg cga tgcAC SacI 251 TAG TGAD2GAG AGA GAG CTC TCA CTA atg gtg atg aca att cag tat taa tgc cac gct tccAC SacI 245 TAG TGAD3GAG AGA GAG CTC TCA CTA aca att cag tat taa tgc cac gct tccAC SacI 242 TAG TGAD4GAG AGA GAG CTC TCA CTA att cag tat taa tgc cac gct tccAC SacI 241 TAG TGAD5GAG AGA GAG CTC TCA CTA cag tat taa tgc cac gct tccAC SacI 240 TAG TGAD6GAG AGA GAG CTC TCA CTA tat taa tgc cac gct tcc cagAC SacI 239 TAG TGAD7GAG AGA GAG CTC TCA CTA taa tgc cac gct tcc cagAC SacI 238 TAG TGAD8GAG AGA GAG CTC TCA CTA agc tat taa tgc cac gct tcc cag aat tgcAC SacI L240A 240D9GAG AGA GAG CTC TCA CTA att tat taa tgc cac gct tcc cag aat tgcAC SacI L240N 240D10GAG AGA GAG CTC TCA CTA acg tat taa tgc cac gct tcc cag aat tgcAC SacI L240R 240D11GAG AGA GAG CTC TCA CTA gtc tat taa tgc cac gct tcc cag aat tgcAC SacI L240D 240D12GAG AGA GAG CTC TCA CTA tct ggc aac tcg cga tgc atg gtg atg aca att agc tat taa tgc cac gct tcc cag aat tgcAC SacI L240A 251D13GAG AGA GAG CTC TCA CTA tct ggc aac tcg cga tgc atg gtg atg aca att att tat taa tgc cac gct tcc cag aat tgcAC SacI L240N 251D14GAG AGA GAG CTC TCA CTA tct ggc aac tcg cga tgc atg gtg atg aca att acg tat taa tgc cac gct tcc cag aat tgcAC SacI L240R 251D15GAG AGA GAG CTC TCA CTA tct ggc aac tcg cga tgc atg gtg atg aca att gtc tat taa tgc cac gct tcc cag aat tgcAC SacI L240D 251 Open table in a new tab mRNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription-PCR, and Amplification— Total RNA was recovered from 107 yeast cells grown at 30 °C in SC-uracil medium made with 2% galactose. Cells were harvested in mid-log phase and RNA purified with the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. RT-PCR was performed with the 1st Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR of cDNA was performed with primers P and D6 for 40 cycles. Steady-state Determination of Slt-I A1 Levels in the Cytosol and ER—Twenty-five (25) ml cultures of W303a yeast cells transformed with pRS416, pRS416Gal mycDT1–251, pRS416GalER mycDT1–251, pRS416Gal mycDT1–239, and pRS416GalER mycDT1–239 were grown to an A600 of 0.8. The cells were washed once in buffer 1 (100 mm Tris, pH 9.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol) and then resuspended in 1 ml of spheroplasting buffer (20 mm Tris pH 7.5, 1 m sorbitol, 2 μg/ml zymolyase 100-T, in SC-uracil 2% galactose broth) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Spheroplasts were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 50 mm potassium acetate, 200 mm sorbitol, 2 mm EDTA, with protease inhibitors). Spheroplasts were lysed in a Dounce homogenizer on ice. The lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g in a TLA-100 ultracentrifuge to pellet ER membranes. The remaining cytosolic components in the supernatant were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed in acetone and resuspended in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate) prior to immunoprecipitation with a mouse anti-myc monoclonal antibody at 70 μg/ml (9E10, kind gift from Bill Balch, The Scripps Research Institute). Briefly, the ER membrane pellet was washed once with lysis buffer and resuspended in 1 ml RIPA buffer. Immune complexes formed overnight at 4 °C were captured on protein-G-Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed once with PBS and then boiled in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. A1 constructs were detected by Western blot analysis using rabbit anti-Slt-I A chain polyclonal antibodies (Molecular Templates Inc., Toronto). Yeast Transformation and Growth Properties (Spot Assay)—Yeast cells were transformed according to the lithium-acetate method (14Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five-ml overnight cultures were grown at 30 °C of selective media supplemented with 2% glucose. These cultures were then pelleted and washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Samples were then diluted to an A600 of 1.0 and serially diluted (10×). Each dilution was then spotted (10 μl) on SD-Ura plates supplemented with 2% galactose. The plates were incubated at 24, 30, or 37 °C for 72 h. Recombinant His8-tagged Protein Expression, Purification, and Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate Assay—Constructs coding for the Slt-I A1 fragments 1–238, 1–239, and 1–251 were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET22b (Novagen) and the fragments expressed as N-terminal His-tag fusion proteins. Constructs coding for Slt-I holotoxins (wild-type and DETOX) were cloned into the pECHE10a vector (Molecular Templates Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada), expressed with a His8-tag at the N terminus of their A chain and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). The enzymatic activity of these molecules was tested in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate assay (TNT assay kit, Promega) using the expression of luciferase as a measure of protein synthesis. The loss of relative light units is related to the ribosome-inactivating activity of Slt-I A chains. Cytotoxicity Assay on Vero Cells—The toxicity of wild-type Slt-I and the variant Slt-I (L240D) toward Vero cells were measured using the sulforhodamine B dye binding assay (15Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8824) Google Scholar). Fifty-thousand Vero cells in 200 μl of α-minimal essential medium were cultured in wells of 96-well plates and exposed to a range of toxin concentrations prepared in PBS for a 1-h period. The toxin-containing solutions were subsequently diluted with the appropriate medium containing fetal calf serum, and the treated cells were cultured for another 48 h. The medium was removed and the remaining adherent cells were fixed with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, air-dried, and stained with 0.4% sulforhodamine B (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) dissolved in 1% (v/v) acetic acid in water. The excess dye was washed away, and the remaining bound sulforhodamine B dye was extracted from the cells with 10 mm Tris base. The absorbance of the dye was read at 540 nm using a plate reader. Each point in the cytotoxicity curves represents the average of experiments performed in triplicate. Circular Dichroism Experiments—CD spectra were recorded on an Aviv 62A DS circular dichroism spectrometer using a 0.5-cm path length rectangular cuvette with a 2-ml sample volume. Protein samples (16.9 μm) of N-terminal His-tagged Slt-I A1 fragments 1–238, 1–239, and 1–251 were prepared in sample buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 100 mm NaCl). Wavelength scans were recorded from 300 to 195 nm, with a 1-nm spectral bandwidth (1 nm between points) and an averaging time of 8 s. Triplicate spectra were recorded for each protein sample. Expression of the Slt-I A1 Fragment in Yeast—Two yeast expression vectors were constructed to study the retrotranslocation of the A1 fragment of Shiga-like toxin 1 (Fig. 1A). The first vector, termed pRSATT, was constructed to express Slt-I A1 chain variants directly into the cytosol under the control of an attenuated Gal1 promoter (16Selleck S.B. Majors J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5399-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The second vector, pRSATT-ER, was designed such that Slt-I A1 variants would be expressed with an N-terminal ER-targeting sequence (17Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) to ensure the concomitant synthesis and translocation of the nascent A1 chains into the ER lumen. Folded A1 mutant chains unable to retrotranslocate from the ER (or another compartment of the secretory pathway) back to the cytosol would result in a survival phenotype. A comparison of toxicity levels observed for cloned Slt-I A1 variants expressed from pRSATT and pRSATT-ER was the basis of a method to delimit region(s) of the A1 chain involved in retrotranslocation (Fig. 1B). Identification of a Retrotranslocative C-terminal Peptide in the Slt-I A Chain—We hypothesized that distinct peptide domains mediated cytotoxicity and retrotranslocation and that a minimum cytotoxic fragment of the Slt-I A1 fragment would not retain its ability to escape from the ER lumen. A series of cassettes coding for the wild-type Slt-I A1 fragment (residues 1–251) and C-terminally truncated variants were created and cloned into pRSATT and pRSATT-ER. The expression of the 1–251 Slt-I A1 fragment from pRSATT was lethal to the host (Fig. 2A; fragment 1–251). Slt-I A1 fragments truncated at their C terminus also remained lethal to the host until residue 239 was deleted (Fig. 2A; fragments 1–238 and 1–239). The viability of yeast cells transformed with the pRSATT vector coding for residues 1–238 was indistinguishable from that observed in yeast transformed with the empty vector (pRSATT only) and in yeast expressing a catalytically inactive E167A/R170A double mutant termed DETOX (Fig. 2A). Wild-type Slt-I holotoxin and its detoxified variant as well as Slt-I A1 fragments coding for either residues 1–238, 1–239, or the entire A chain were then separately expressed in bacteria, purified, and subsequently tested to confirm their ability to inactivate ribosomes in vitro (N-glycosidase activity) in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TNT) assay (Fig. 2C). As expected, the enzymatic activities of the A chain and of the 1–239 fragment were comparable with that of the wild-type Slt-I toxin, while the 1–238 fragment and the DETOX form of the toxin had no detectable catalytic activity (Fig. 2C). Genes coding for Slt-I A1 1–251 and 1–239 were then cloned into pRSATT-ER to determine whether the deleted C-terminal region (residues 240–251) was essential for routing the A1 fragment from the ER lumen to the cytosol. Both Slt-I A1 1–251 and 1–239 were equally toxic when expressed into the cytosol of yeast cells (Fig. 2B), while only the 1–251 construct remained toxic to cells when expressed with an N-terminal signal sequence (Fig. 2B, fragment ER 1–251). A survival phenotype was observed from the ER-routed A1 1–239 variant implying that the truncated protein was unable to relocate back to the cytosol from the ER lumen or any other compartments along the secretory pathway or was simply secreted by the yeast cells (Fig. 2B; fragment ER 1–239). In view of the extreme toxicity of ribosome-inactivating proteins (18Yamaizumi M. Mekada E. Uchida T. Okada Y. Cell. 1978; 15: 245-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) such as Slt-I, yeast vectors harboring a strongly attenuated Gal1 promoter were used in this study to minimize the expression of Slt-I A1 and thus avoid overwhelming the ER import pathway. As a result of this experimental constraint, cytotoxic A1 variants could not be detected by conventional biochemical techniques (Western blot, immunoprecipitation, microscopy) when expressed from the attenuated promoter. Three sets of experiments were then performed to confirm that the Slt-I A1 fragment is translocated into the ER lumen and that the survival of yeast cells expressing the ER-targeted 1–239 fragment was not due to the lack of toxin production. First, the expression of messenger RNAs was confirmed using RT PCR for all A1 mutants targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum and leading to a survival phenotype in yeast (Fig. 3A). Second, catalytically inactive forms (E167A/R170A) of the A1 chain variants 1–251 and 1–239 were constructed and overexpressed in yeast cells to monitor their distribution within cellular compartments. More specifically, myc-tagged versions of the 1–251 and 1–239 fragments were cloned into a high copy number vector (pRS416) and expressed under the control of the wild-type Gal1 promoter, with and without the ER signal sequence. W303a yeast cells were then transformed with these vectors and grown in galactose to induce the expression of the toxin variants. The yeast cells were fractionated into cytosolic and ER fractions, and the myc-tagged protein was immunoprecipitated from each fraction. Immunoprecipitated material was then separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blots were performed using anti-Slt-I A chain polyclonal antibodies. As expected, 1–251 and 1–239 toxin fragments were recovered from the cytosol but not from ER fractions of yeast cells expressing the 1–251 and 1–239 toxin fragments lacking the ER signal sequence (∼29-kDa band; Fig. 3B). Similarly, toxin was only recovered from the cytosol of yeast cells expressing the 1–251 fragment fused to the ER signal sequence (∼33-kDa band; Fig. 3B). In this case, a larger molecular mass band (∼33 kDa band; 1–251 fragment with ER signal sequence) is observed in the cytosol as expected from the cytoplasmic overexpression of this construct as well as a dominant cleaved A1 chain band (∼29 kDa band) corresponding to the mass of fragment 1–251 lacking the ER signal sequence. These results suggest that the A1 chain has been directed into the ER and then rerouted to the cytosol after removal of the signal sequence. Finally, the fragment expressing residues 1–239 fused to the signal-cleaved ER signal sequence was predominantly found in the ER fraction of yeast cells (∼29-kDa band) suggesting that it accumulated there after translocation and signal cleavage. Predictably, some of the overexpressed ER signal-containing version of the 1–239 fragment (∼33 kDa band) was also observed in its unprocessed form the cytosolic fraction. Last, a genetic approach was devised to confirm that the survival phenotype of yeast expressing the ER-targeted 1–239 fragment was due to ER import and not due to a lack of enzymatic activity. Our strategy was based on the use of a cold-sensitive yeast strain, which expresses a mutant form of Sec61p that conditionally limits ER import. The strain RSY1295 is non-viable at 17 °C but propagates in the temperature range from 23 to 37 °C where the disruption in ER import is not so severe as to prevent cell growth (19Pilon M. Schekman R. Romisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 20Pilon M. Romisch K. Quach D. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3455-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Transforming RSY1295 with the vector expressing ER-targeted 1–239 (ER 1–239; Fig. 3C) and growing this particular strain at a temperature causing a partial blockage of ER import should lead to a reduction in yeast viability due to the accumulation of newly synthesized toxic 1–239 fragments directly into the cytosol. At the permissive temperature for ER import (30 °C), RSY1295 displayed the expected sensitivity to cytosolically expressed DETOX, 1–251 and 1–239, and ER-targeted 1–251 and 1–239 (Fig. 3C; DETOX, 1–251, 1–239, ER 1–251, and ER 1–239) as was seen for the isogenic wild-type RSY1293 strain transformed with the same vectors. However, at 37 °C, RSY1295 was 2 orders of magnitude more sensitive to the ER-targeted 1–239 than RSY1293 (Fig. 3C, ER 1–239). The same effect was observed, albeit to a lesser extent, at 24 °C (Fig. 3C) indicating that the toxic A1 fragment 1–239 with the N-terminal ER-targeting sequence was produced but poorly shuttled to the ER lumen, thereby resulting in ribosome inactivation. Similar results were obtained for all non-retrotranslocative A1 mutants expressed in the cold-sensitive RSY1295 yeast strain (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that A1 chains fused to the ER signal sequence are produced as enzymatically active molecules and targeted to the ER lumen. Furthermore, the data indicate that the 1–251 fragment of the Slt-I A chain efficiently retrotranslocates from the ER, while the 1–239 fragment accumulates there. Delimiting the Retrotranslocative Peptide of the Slt-I A1 Fragment—Progressively longer versions of the Slt-I A1 fragment were cloned into pRSATT-ER and expressed in yeast to determine the minimal peptide segment within the region 240–251 necessary to facilitate the retrotranslocation of the A1 chain from the ER lumen to the cytosol. The addition of Leu240 to the C terminus of 1–239 had a dramatic effect on retrotranslocation, restoring toxicity to nearly that of the wild type A1 domain (Fig. 4A, ER 1–240 and ER 1–251). The additions of Asn241 and Cys242 appear to partly mask the retrotranslocative potential of Leu240, while the addition of the three consecutive histidines from residues 243 to 245 restored retrotranslocation to the same level observed for 1–251 (Fig. 4A, ER 1–241, ER 1–242, and ER 1–245). The toxicity of all lengths tested was indistinguishable from wild type when expressed from pRSATT (data not shown). Substitution of Leucine for Aspartic Acid at Position 240 in the 1–240 and 1–251 Slt-I A1 Fragment Results in a Reduction in Retrotranslocative Potential—The addition of Leu240 to the 1–239 fragment of the Slt-I A chain restored most of its retrotranslocative potential. To determine whether this effect was due to the presence of a specific amino acid at position 240 or simply a chain length effect, leucine 240 was replaced in the 1–240 Slt-I A1 fragment with alanine, asparagine, arginine, and aspartic acid and tested for cytotoxicity when expressed and routed to the ER using the pRSATT-ER vector. The toxicity of these ER-targeted variants was reduced (Fig. 4B) in relation to the ER-targeted 1–240 and 1–251 fragments (Fig. 4B). Full-length Slt-I A1 mutants (1–251) were then constructed to determine whether mutations at position 240 were blocking retrotranslocation specifically because of their location at the C terminus of the peptide. Leucine at position 240 was replaced either with alanine,"
https://openalex.org/W2119205288,"α-Crystallin, composed of two subunits, αA and αB, has been shown to function as a molecular chaperone that prevents aggregation of other proteins under stress conditions. The exposed hydrophobic surfaces of α-crystallins have been implicated in this process, but their exact role has not been elucidated. In this study, we quantify the hydrophobic surfaces of αA- and αB-crystallins by isothermal titration calorimetry using 8-anilino-1-napthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) as a hydrophobic probe and analyze its correlation to the chaperone potential of αA- and αB-crystallins under various conditions. Two ANS binding sites, one with low and another with high affinity, were clearly detected, with αB showing a higher number of sites than αA at 30 °C. In agreement with the higher number of hydrophobic sites, αB-crystallin demonstrated higher chaperone activity than αA at this temperature. Thermodynamic analysis of ANS binding to αA- and αB-crystallins indicates that high affinity binding is driven by both enthalpy and entropy changes, with entropy dominating the low affinity binding. Interestingly, although the number of ANS binding sites was similar for αA and αB at 15 °C, αA was more potent than αB in preventing aggregation of the insulin B-chain. Although there was no change in the number of high affinity binding sites of αA and αB for ANS upon preheating, there was an increase in the number of low affinity sites of αA and αB. Preheated αA, in contrast to αB, exhibited remarkably enhanced chaperone activity. Our results indicate that although hydrophobicity appears to be a factor in determining the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallins, it does not quantitatively correlate with the chaperone function of α-crystallins. α-Crystallin, composed of two subunits, αA and αB, has been shown to function as a molecular chaperone that prevents aggregation of other proteins under stress conditions.

Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). α-Crystallin, a member of the sHSP group, constitutes a major portion of the eye lens cytoplasm. Its concentration in the lens fiber cells can make up to 50% of the total protein that exists as a polydisperse aggregate (2de Jong W.W. Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 3Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Jaenicke R. Lubsen N.H. Slingsby C. Tardieu A. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

Although the average size of α-crystallin is ∼700 kDa, its size can range from 360 to >1000 kDa depending on the source, the purification protocols employed, and the presence of posttranslational modifications (2de Jong W.W. Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 3Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Jaenicke R. Lubsen N.H. Slingsby C. Tardieu A. Prog.

Lenticular α-crystallin is a hetero-oligomer with two subunits, αA and αB, mostly present in a stoichiometry of 3:1. αA and αB are 20 kDa each and share ∼60% sequence identity (3Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W.

Apart from their presence in the lens, α-crystallins are also found in many non-lenticular tissues. For example, αB-crystallin is expressed in the heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and brain (5Bhat S.P. Prog. Drug Res. 2003; 60: 205-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Increased levels of αB-crystallin have been observed in many neurodegenerative disorders and tumors (5Bhat S.P. Prog. Drug Res. 2003; 60: 205-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Klemenz R. Frohli E. Aoyama A. Hoffman S. Simpson R.J. Mortiz R.L. Shafer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 803-812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike αB-crystallin, αA-crystallin appears to be largely lens-specific. Both homopolymers and heteropolymers of α-crystallin exhibit chaper-one-like activity similar to that of other sHSPs (4Horwitz J. Exp. Eye. Res. 2003; 76: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 5Bhat S.P. Prog. Drug Res. 2003; 60: 205-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Klemenz R. Frohli E. Aoyama A. Hoffman S.

Several studies have demonstrated that α-crystallin suppresses protein aggregation, protecting them from heat, chemicals, and UV light irradiation (4Horwitz J. Exp. Eye. Res. 2003; 76: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 5Bhat S.P. Prog. Drug Res. 2003; 60: 205-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Klemenz R. Frohli E. Aoyama A. Hoffman S.

Hence, in addition to providing refractive properties to the eye lens, α-crystallin is instrumental in maintaining transparency of the eye lens with its chaperone-like activity (4Horwitz J. Exp. Eye. Res. 2003; 76: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 5Bhat S.P. Prog. Drug Res. 2003; 60: 205-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Klemenz R. Frohli E. Aoyama A. Hoffman S.

Res. 2003; 76: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 5Bhat S.P. Prog. Drug Res. 2003; 60: 205-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Whereas αA-crystallin knock-out mice develop cataracts, αB knock-out mice show degeneration of specific skeletal muscles with no symptoms of cataracts (8Brady J.P. Garland D. Duglas-Tabor Y.

Likewise, αA-crystallin is more effective than αB-crystallin in conferring protection against UVA light stress-induced apoptosis in lens epithelial cells (10Andley U.P. Song Z. Wawrousek E.F.

Primary cultures of αB–/– lens epithelial cells showed genome instability and hyperproliferation, suggesting that αB-crystallin regulates cell division through the stabilization of cytoskeleton filaments (10Andley U.P.

Regarding the ability of αA- and αB-crystallins to act as chaperones, different studies have reported conflicting results (14Reddy G.B. Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4565-4570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 15Datta S.A. Rao C.M. J. Biol.

Protein Chem. 2002; 21: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). At this point, it is not clear whether the apparent differences in tissue specificity and distinct physiological demands/necessities of αA- and αB-crystallins have differentially influenced their chaperone ability and other structural properties. Although the mechanism of chaperone function is not completely understood, the ability of α-crystallin to specifically recognize aggregation-prone non-native proteins and prevent their subsequent insolubilization is well established (3Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W.

Numerous studies implicate surface-exposed hydrophobic sites on α-crystallin and other sHSPs in binding to partially unfolded proteins (14Reddy G.B. Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol.

The finding that increased exposure of hydrophobic surfaces on structurally perturbed α-crystallin is associated with increased chaperone-like function substantiates the role of hydrophobicity in the chaperone function of sHSP (14Reddy G.B. Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4565-4570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 15Datta S.A. Rao C.M. J. Biol.

However, enhanced chaperone-like activity with an increase in temperature was not similarly associated with increased hydrophobicity with recombinant αA- and αB-crystallins (14Reddy G.B. Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4565-4570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 16van Boekel M.A. de Lange F. de Grip W.J. de Jong W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). αA- and αB-crystallins differ not only in their hydrophobic character with temperature but also in their secondary and tertiary structure, molecular size, and other physicochemical properties (14Reddy G.B. Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4565-4570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 15Datta S.A. Rao C.M. J. Biol.

Acta. 1999; 1434: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This makes an exact correlation between hydrophobicity and chaperone activity difficult to establish. Historically, hydrophobicity has been measured qualitatively and quantitatively by spectroscopic methods like fluorescence and equilibrium dialysis, mostly by using two common fluorescent dyes, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) and bis-ANS (19Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar G.S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Sharma K.K. Kumar G.S. Murphy A.S. Kester K. J. Biol.

In such cases, indirect methods such as van't Hoff analysis for obtaining thermodynamic parameters to elucidate ANS binding are often limited. For instance, one study reported a stoichiometry of one ANS binding site per 24 subunits (22Stevens A. Augusteyn R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas others have reported one ANS or bis-ANS binding site per subunit of α-crystallin (14Reddy G.B. Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4565-4570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 19Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar G.S. Kester K. J. Biol.

More sensitive and accurate methods are needed to resolve such ambiguities. High sensitivity isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is one such method for quantifying the hydrophobic sites and measuring the thermodynamic parameters directly and accurately. In the present study, we have employed ITC to determine the number of binding sites and the thermodynamics of ANS binding to αA- and αB-crystallins. We correlate hydrophobicity and chaperone activity of αA- and αB-crystallins at different temperatures to get greater insight into the role of hydrophobicity in the chaperone-like function of α-crystallin. Materials—ANS, β-mercaptoethanol, acrylamide, bis-acrylamide, bovine serum albumin, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, DTT, and insulin were obtained from Sigma. Sephacryl 300 HR and MonoQ were from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were procured from local companies. Purification of Recombinant αA- and αB-crystallins—Bacterial (BL21) cells containing expression vectors (pET23d) of human αA- and αB-crystallins were a generous gift from Dr. J. Mark Petrash (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Proteins from 1-liter cultures were extracted and purified according to the procedures described previously (14Reddy G.B. Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4565-4570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, αA- and αB-crystallins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells containing the respective vectors by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and purified using MonoQ anion exchange and Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration columns. The purity/homogeneity of αA and αB was found to be 99% as analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Concentrations of αA and αB were calculated using molar extinction coefficients, (ϵ280) of 16,500 and 19,000 m–1 cm–1, respectively. Chaperone Activity Assay—The chaperone activities of αA-crystallin and αB-crystallin were assessed by measuring each one's ability to prevent the aggregation of insulin denatured by the reduction of disulfide bonds. The aggregation assay was performed essentially as described previously (14Reddy G.B. Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4565-4570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Apparent absorption at 400 nm due to DTT-induced aggregation of insulin was monitored as a function of time in the absence and presence of αA- and αB-crystallins using a Cary100 UV-visible spectrophotometer. For a chaperone assay performed in the presence of ANS, αA- and αB-crystallins were preincubated with saturating amounts of ANS under specific conditions as showned in Table III, and excess ANS was removed by dialysis.Table IIIPercentage loss of chaperone activity of αA- and αB-crystallin (native and preheated) in the presence of ANS at 15 and 30 °CαAαB15 °C30 °C15 °C30 °CNative42446265Preheated60545563 Open table in a new tab Isothermal Titration Calorimetric Studies—Titration calorimetric measurements were performed using a VP-ITC calorimeter (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA) as described previously (25Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). In brief, 4–8-μl aliquots of ANS solution (10 mm) were added via a 300-μl syringe with constant stirring at 310 rpm to the sample cell containing 1.4 ml of αA- or αB-crystallin (50 μm), and heat changes accompanying these additions were recorded. An interval of 3 min between injections was chosen for the baseline to stabilize. The protein samples were extensively dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.01% NaN3), before titration. ANS was solubilized in the final dialysate buffer. The titration of ANS solution with buffer alone gave negligible values for the heat of dilution, which were subtracted from the actual titration data. The data so obtained were fitted using a non-linear least squares minimization method for determining the binding stoichiometry (N), binding constant (Kb), and change in enthalpy (ΔHb) using Origin software (Microcal Inc.), and the two-site model provided the best fit for the data. The change in entropy (ΔS) was calculated from ΔG = ΔH – TΔS. Despite the presence of a wealth of literature on the dependence of the chaperone function of α-crystallin on its surface hydrophobicity, a deterministic role of hydrophobicity in quantitative terms remains unresolved. There are numerous instances where hydrophobicity could not be directly correlated to the chaperone-like activity of αA- and αB-crystallins. For instance, replacement of Phe-71 with Gly in αA-crystallin results in loss of chaperone activity despite an increase in surface hydrophobicity with no significant alterations in structure (26Santhoshkumar P. Sharma K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47094-47099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In another study, calf lens αA-crystallin was found to be more hydrophobic but showed lower chaperone activity than αB-crystallin at room temperature (18Bhattacharyya J. Srinivas V. Sharma K.K. J. Protein Chem. 2002; 21: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In vitro modification of bovine α-crystallin with methylglyoxal enhanced the chaperone-like activity, particularly in aggregation assays, although hydrophobicity showed a decrease (27Kumar M.S. Reddy P.Y. Kumar P.A. Surolia I. Reddy G.B. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Moreover, apparent differences in the temperature-dependent behavior of αA- and αB-crystallins with respect to chaperone activity, hydrophobicity, and oligomeric size necessitate a critical evaluation of the role of hydrophobicity in αA-crystallin and αB-crystallin function. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Studies—The polydisperse nature of α-crystallin may complicate the quantification of hydrophobicity by spectroscopic methods. ITC is sensitive and appropriate because it measures the heat change directly, independent of the state of the protein. ANS binding to αA- and αB-crystallins was characterized by using ITC at 15 and 30 °C. Figs. 1 and 2 show the typical titration calorimetry profiles that resulted from the addition of 8-μl aliquots of 10 mm ANS to αA- and αB-crystallins along with the normalized integrated titration data. The results exhibit a monotonic decrease in the exothermic heat of binding with successive injections until saturation is achieved. The data best fitted to nonlinear least squares were provided by means of the two-site binding model. Stoichiometry (N) and thermodynamic parameters (changes in enthalpy (ΔH), free energy (ΔG), and entropy (ΔS)) for the binding of ANS to αA- and αB-crystallins at 15 and 30 °C are listed in Table I. Both αA-crystallin and αB-crystallin showed two sets of binding sites for ANS, low affinity and high affinity, based on the binding constants. Thermodynamic parameters for the binding of ANS to αA- and αB-crystallins indicate that high affinity binding is driven by both enthalpy and entropy changes, whereas the entropy change is dominant for low affinity binding. These data suggest that hydrophobic forces are dominant in the ANS binding to α-crystallin. The fact that αA- and αB-crystallin have two sets of binding sites is in agreement with the studies of Stevens and Augusteyn, who suggested two kinds of interactions for the binding of ANS to α-crystallin (22Stevens A. Augusteyn R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, binding of destabilized mutants of T4 lysozyme to α-crystallin was demonstrated to be biphasic (28Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40557-40566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Calorimetric titration profile for the binding of ANS to native αB-crystallin at 30 °C.

Stoichiometries of higher and lower affinity sites were greater in αB as compared with those in αA at 30 °C (Table I). This supports the view that αB is more hydrophobic than αA. At a low temperature (15 °C), αA crystallin showed an increase in the number of high affinity ANS binding sites but a decrease in the number of low affinity binding sites. Although, both αA and αB displayed similar binding stoichiometry for ANS at 15 °C, their binding constants differed particularly for low affinity sites (K2), which probably hints that low affinity sites may influence the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallins under different conditions. Chaperone-like Activity Studies—We assessed the chaperone activity of αA-crystallin and αB-crystallin by analyzing the ability of the two to suppress the aggregation of the insulin B-chain at 15 and 30 °C and compared it to their hydrophobic nature as deduced by ITC. Fig. 3, A and B show the suppression of insulin B-chain aggregation by αA-crystallin and αB-crystallin, respectively, at 15 and 30 °C. At 30 °C, αB-crystallin showed higher chaperone activity than αA crystallin (Fig. 3B) and was associated with a greater number of ANS binding sites (both high and low affinity) as compared with αA (Table I). In contrast, at 15 °C αA showed greater protection than αB crystallin (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, ANS binding sites were found to be similar in number for both αA and αB, though K2 was higher for αA at 15 °C. At higher temperatures (above 40 °C), αA has been reported to be more protective than αB (14Reddy G.B. Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4565-4570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 15Datta S.A. Rao C.M. J. Biol.

Acta. 1999; 1434: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that at extreme temperatures (both low and high) αA acts as a better chaperone than αB in preventing the aggregation of insulin. The results of the present study indicate that the relative chaperone activities of αA and αB are not correlated with the number of hydrophobic sites at low temperature, as αA and αB have similar number of binding sites (both high and low affinity) (Table I). Also, the diminished ability of αA-crystallin and αB-crystallin to prevent the insulin aggregation at 15 °C as compared with that at 30 °C is not directly related to the number of hydrophobic sites, as αA showed one high affinity binding site per subunit at 30 °C but 3–4 sites at 15 °C. Temperature-dependent Changes in Hydrophobicity and Chaperone Activity—Although, the increase in chaperone function with temperature was thought to be associated with the exposure of additional hydrophobic sites (21Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 29Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23559-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), it was later shown that only the αA polymer displayed an increased hydrophobic surface due to structural reorganization upon heating followed by cooling, but αB did not (14Reddy G.B. Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4565-4570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Here, we studied the binding of ANS to αA- and αB-crystallins by ITC at 15 °C after preheating the samples at 58 °C. The data indicated that whereas there was no change in the number of high affinity sites for ANS in both αA and αB, there was an increase in the number of low affinity sites in both αA and αB (Fig. 4 and Table II). To assess how the above changes in hydrophobicity are quantitatively associated with the chaperone activity, we estimated the chaperone activity of preheated αA-crystallin and αB-crystallin at 15 °C. As shown in Fig. 5A, preheated αA displayed remarkably enhanced (5×) chaperone activity than the unheated one. In contrast to αA, αB did not show such an enhanced chaperone activity with preheating (Fig. 5A). Thus, the increased chaperone activity of preheated αA cannot be explained by changes in its hydrophobic character. Interestingly, preheated αA showed significantly higher chaperone ability than αB at 30 °C (Fig. 5B), whereas unheated αA displayed lower chaperone activity compared with unheated αB (Fig. 3B). Apart from the increased and/or reorganized hydrophobic surfaces, the increased chaperone-like activity of preheated α-crystallin over unheated protein has been mainly attributed to its increased aggregate size (30Burgio M.R. Kim C.J. Dow C.C. Koretz J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), Furthermore, the increase in size was observed with preheated αA-crystallin but not with αB-crystallin (31Burgio M.R. Bennett P.M. Koretz J.F. Mol. Vis. 2001; 7: 228-233PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the aggregate size of α-crystallin may play an important role in the chaperone activity of αA- and αB-crystallins.Table IICalorimetric data of ANS binding to preheated αA- and αB-crystallins at 15 °CParametersαAαBN13.4 ± 0.263.9 ± 0.18K1 (m-1) × 10-51.4 ± 0.543.6 ± 1.1ΔG1 (kcal/mol)-6.8 ± 0.95-7.3 ± 0.56ΔH1 (kcal/mol)-731 ± 85.4-713 ± 34.1ΔS1 (cal/mol/K)21.1 ± 5.3523 ± 3.65N216.2 ± 1.6314.9 ± 0.71K2 (m-1)8238 ± 26451000 ± 23ΔG2 (kcal/mol)-5.1 ± 1.61-5.3 ± 1.12ΔH2 (kcal/mol)-223 ± 45.1-299 ± 30.2ΔS2 (cal/mol/K)17.1 ± 2.5317.4 ± 3.02 Open table in a new tab Fig. 5Chaperone activity of native and preheated αA- and αB-crystallins studied at 15 (panel A) and 30 °C (panel B).

Kaur H. Kumar G.S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 32Smulders R.H. de Jong W.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used this approach to ascertain the enhanced chaperone function to that of increased hydrophobicity. It is believed that the enhanced chaperone activity may be due to the increased and reorganized hydrophobic sites. If this notion were true, we would expect a greater loss in chaperone activity with prior ANS binding under the conditions, which enhance chaperone activity. However, the results of the present study are not in agreement with the above assumption. For instance, the percent decrease in chaperone activity due to ANS binding was more for αB than for αA at 15 °C (Table III), but αB displayed lower chaperone activity than αA at this temperature (Fig. 3A). However, at 30 °C the loss in activity due to ANS binding appeared to go hand in hand with chaperone activity of αA and αB (Table III and Fig. 3B). The hydrophobicity and chaperone activity paradox appears to be more striking with the preheated crystallins. The percentage loss of chaperone activity due to ANS binding was similar with preheated αA and αB irrespective of the assay temperatures, 15 and 30 °C (Table III). However, the enhanced chaperone potential was remarkable with preheated αA as compared with αB (Fig. 5). These findings, taken together, indicate that the correlation between hydrophobicity as assessed by the binding of hydrophobic dyes (both quantitatively and qualitatively) and chaperone activity may often be coincidental rather than a true indication of their function. Furthermore, these results suggest that factors other than hydrophobicity could play a role in the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin. Liao et al. reported that in addition to surface hydrophobicity, structural stability plays a major role in the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallins (33Liao J.H. Lee J.S. Chiou S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 854-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the oligomeric size of sHSP (30Burgio M.R. Kim C.J. Dow C.C. Koretz J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2001; 66: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) have also been proposed to play an important role. Further studies would be required to delineate the contribution of these factors in α-crystallin chaperone activity. In summary, the data presented in this study provide the stoichiometry and the affinity of ANS binding sites of native and preheated recombinant αA-crystallin and αB-crystallin in quantitative terms vis-à-vis their contribution to chaperone activity. Together, the ITC data and the data on chaperone activity (both in the absence and presence of ANS) suggest that there is no direct quantitative correlation between hydrophobicity and chaperone-like activity. Furthermore, this approach may be employed to establish the role of hydrophobicity in the chaperone activity of other sHSPs. We thank Profs. A. Surolia and R.

Lipid-anchored streptavidin conjugates could be incorporated into Jurkat or other mammalian cell surfaces by inserting biotinylated phosphatidylethanolamine-polyethyleneglycols (PE-PEGs) and subsequently binding streptavidin to the cell-incorporated PE-PEGs.

Remarkably, however, antibody-mediated cross-linking of either dipalmitoyl- or dilinoleoyl-PE-PEG-anchored streptavidin conjugates in Jurkat cells induced elevation of cytoplasmic calcium levels and tyrosine phosphorylation of the scaf-folding protein linker of T-cell activation in a manner similar to that observed upon cross-linking of endogenous CD59 or ganglioside GM1. The amplitude of the cross-linking-stimulated elevation of cytoplasmic calcium moreover showed an essentially identical dependence on the level of incorporated streptavidin conjugate for either type of lipid anchor. Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that PE-PEG-streptavidin conjugates with saturated versus polyunsaturated anchors showed very similar surface distributions vis à vis GM1 or CD59 under conditions where one or both species were cross-linked. These results indicate that cross-linking of diverse proteins anchored only to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane can induce activation of Jurkat T-cell-signaling responses, but they appear to contradict previous suggestions that this phenomenon rests specifically on the association of such species with lipid rafts.

Difficulties in assessing the role of rafts in such processes arise in part from the fact that available approaches to study and to modulate the behavior of rafts in biological membranes remain limited. Antibody-mediated cross-linking of raft-associated molecules such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; CTB, cholera toxin B subunit; di16:0-, di18:2-PE, dipalmitoyl, dilinoleoylphosphatidylethanolamine; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GM1, ganglioside GM1; Indo-1, acetoxymethyl ester, 4-(6-carboxy-2-indolyl)-4′-methyl-2,2′-(ethylenedioxy)dianiline-N,N-N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (tetrakis(acetoxymethyl) ester); LAT, linker of activation of T-cells; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PEG, polyethyleneglycol. -anchored proteins and ganglioside GM1 in T-lymphocyte cell lines induces intracellular signaling events (e.g. elevation of cytoplasmic calcium and phosphorylation of specific proteins) that are similar to those observed in the early stages of T-cell activation mediated by the T-cell receptor (8Janes P.W.

Immunol. 1999; 29: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Such findings have been interpreted to suggest that aggregation and/or growth of rafts within the plasma membrane surface may play a key facilitating or triggering role in T-cell receptor-mediated T-cell signaling. It has been suggested that lateral aggregation/expansion of rafts in the T-cell membrane may locally concentrate key signaling molecules within such domains and favor exclusion of species that normally antagonize the activation process (for review, see Ref. 12Dykstra M. Cherukuri A. Sohn H.W. Tzeng S.J. Pierce S.K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 457-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In this picture, the ability of GM1 and GPI-anchored proteins to induce intracellular signaling processes upon antibody-mediated cross-linking rests on their association with lipid rafts and on their consequent ability to induce raft redistribution and/or growth when cross-linked. Cross-linking or otherwise manipulating endogenous raft-associated molecules to perturb raft organization entails the inherent potential complication that the behavior of these molecules may be influenced by specific interactions with other membrane components as much as by their physical association with rafts per se. In this study we have used a novel approach to introduce into mammalian cells artificial lipid-anchored streptavidin conjugates whose protein component is foreign to the recipient cells and whose lipid anchor can be constructed to carry acyl chains that confer either an affinity for ordered lipid domains or a strong tendency to avoid such domains. We have used lipid-anchored streptavidin conjugates with different lipid anchors to assess previous proposals that the ability of GPI-anchored proteins and ganglioside GM1, when cross-linked by antibodies, to activate intracellular signaling events similar to those during T-cell receptor-mediated cell activation rests specifically on their association with lipid rafts. Comparison of the behavior in cell membranes of exogenously incorporated lipid-anchored species that differ minimally in their overall structure but greatly in their raft-associating tendencies offers an attractive new strategy to investigate the role of raft association in various aspects of the behavior of endogenous membrane components such as GPI-anchored proteins and glycosphingolipids.

Synthesis and Cellular Incorporation of PE-PEG-Biotin—α, ϵ-Diamino-PEG-1450 (20Shahinian S. Silvius J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) was reacted in 99:1 methylene chloride/diisopropylethylamine with 1 mol eq of biotin succinimidyl ester under argon for 2 h at 25 °C, then purified by ion-exchange chromatography on SP-Sephadex C50 (Amersham Biosciences), eluting the desired mono-derivatized product with 10 mm NaCl. The lyophilized product was reacted with a 5-fold excess of succinic anhydride in a 1:1 (v/v) methanol, 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.5, and purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography on silica gel 60A plates (Whatman) in 50:20:10:10:5 methylene chloride/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water. The resulting succinylated and biotinylated PEG was reacted with 1, 2, 2, and 3 eq, respectively, of phosphatidylethanolamine, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylethylamine, and N-hydroxysuccinimide under argon for 16 h at 25 °C in 10:1 methylene chloride/dimethylformamide, and the PE-PEG-biotin product was purified by preparative TLC in 70:20:1.5:1.5 methylene chloride/methanol/water/ammonium hydroxide. PE-PEG-biotin stock solutions in methylene chloride/methanol were standardized by phosphorus determination as described previously (21Lowry R.R. Tinsley I.J. Lipids. 1974; 9: 491-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). For incorporation of biotinylated PE-PEGs into cells, aliquots of PE-PEG-biotin were dried under nitrogen and then under high vacuum, redissolved in a small volume (<1% of final aqueous volume) of dimethylformamide, mixed with 290 mm sucrose, 1 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and bath-sonicated for 1 min at room temperature. Jurkat cells (7.5 × 107 cells/ml) were incubated with PE-PEG-biotin at the indicated final concentrations in sucrose/HEPES for 1 min at 37 °C, then centrifuged, twice resuspended, and centrifuged in serum-free medium and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated with 30 μg/ml unlabeled streptavidin or (for microscopy) 15 μg/ml Texas Red-labeled streptavidin and again twice centrifuged from serum-free medium to remove unbound streptavidin. PE-PEG-anchored streptavidin was incorporated into COS-7 cells (grown to 70–80% confluency on coverslips or in culture dishes) in a similar manner using serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in place of RPMI and carrying out all incubations and washes on adherent cells. Low Temperature Detergent Fractionation—All reagents and solutions were chilled to 0 °C, and all procedures were conducted on ice. Pelleted cells (1 × 108 cells) were lysed in 2 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin. After incubation for 10 min the lysate was transferred to a SW41 ultracentrifuge tube, mixed with 2 ml of 80% sucrose in the buffer, and overlaid with 5 ml of 35% and 2.5 ml of 5% sucrose in the same buffer. The samples were centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 16–20 h at 4 °C, and fractions were collected from the gradients and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Cytoplasmic Calcium Measurements—For fluorescence monitoring of cytoplasmic calcium levels, Jurkat cells were loaded with 2 μm Indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) in serum-free medium for 30 min at 37 °C, then washed and incubated further for 30 min. To appropriately pretreated cell samples (6 × 106 cells/ml), the following antibodies were added at 37 °C to induce cross-linking of cell surface components while monitoring Indo-1 fluorescence: anti-CD3 antibody OKT3, anti-CTB antiserum (1:250) to cells preincubated with varying amounts of CTB for 10 min at 37 °C, mouse anti-human CD59 at varying concentrations to cells preincubated with mouse anti-human CD59 (10 μg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C, or anti-streptavidin antiserum (1:250) to cells preincubated with varying concentrations of PE-PEG-biotin followed by streptavidin as described above. Fluorescence measurements were carried out in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B luminescence spectrometer with a stirred and thermostatted sample holder, continuously recording the ratio of fluorescence emission intensities at 480 versus 405 nm with excitation set at 355 nm. Tyrosine Phosphorylation Analyses—For analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by CD3 cross-linking in Jurkat cells, cell suspensions (1.5 × 107 cells/ml) in serum-free medium were preincubated on ice with 1 μg/ml mouse anti-human CD3 OKT3 antibody (60 min) followed by the addition of goat anti-mouse IgG (50 μg/ml) and rapid warming to 37 °C to initiate cell activation. GM1 cross-linking was carried out by preincubating cells with 4 μg/ml CTB for 60 min on ice, warming to 37 °C, and adding 1:100 anti-CTB antiserum. Cell-anchored streptavidin was cross-linked by adding 1:100 anti-streptavidin anti-serum at 37 °C to cells incorporating PE-PEG-streptavidin conjugates. CD59 cross-linking was carried out by pretreating cells with mouse anti-CD59 (20 μg/ml) at 0 °C for 1 h, then adding goat anti-mouse antibody (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C. At various times after the indicated final additions of antibody, 250-μl aliquots were removed, pelleted, and immediately lysed on ice in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaF, 10 sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm each of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, MgCl2, and sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.5, and containing 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin. Samples of solubilized cell lysates (20 μg protein/sample) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Up-state). All immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Confocal Imaging—Jurkat cells (3 × 106 cells/ml), pretreated where indicated to incorporate di16:0- or di18:2PE-PEGs, were chilled to 4 °C and incubated for 20 min in serum-free medium with various combinations of 15 μg/ml Texas Red-streptavidin, 4 μg/ml CTB-FITC, and/or 10 μg/ml anti-CD59 antibody. Cross-linking of these components, where indicated, was carried out by further incubating the cells with anti-streptavidin antiserum (1:100 dilution), anti-cholera toxin antiserum (1:100), or FITC- or rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (50 μg/ml) for 20 min. Cells were then washed, adsorbed to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, and imaged live using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope under a 63× objective. We and others have previously shown that long chain diacyl-PE-PEGs, when initially dispersed in pure form in aqueous media, can rapidly integrate into lipid bilayers, with which they remain tightly associated thereafter (22Silvius J.R. Zuckermann M.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3153-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23Fenske D.B. Palmer L.R. Chen T. Wong K.F. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys.

These findings led us to explore the strategy illustrated in Fig. 1 to incorporate artificial lipid-anchored streptavidin conjugates, whose lipid anchor structures and properties can be systematically varied, into the surface membranes of living mammalian cells. In this approach, cells are first incubated for short times with a dispersion of a PE-PEG-biotin in an iso-osmotic but low ionic strength medium (which promotes formation of optically clear, presumably micellar (25Johnsson M. Edwards K. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 3839-3847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) suspensions of PE-PEG-biotin species with a variety of acyl chains). After washing and a 1-h post-incubation in serum-free medium, the cells are incubated in the cold with streptavidin, then washed to remove unbound protein. As shown in Fig. 2A, under these conditions immunoblotting detects streptavidin bound to Jurkat cells only when the cells have been pretreated with PE-PEG-biotin. The amount of bound streptavidin increases steadily with the amount of PE-PEG-biotin added to the cells. PE-PEG-streptavidin conjugates with a variety of acyl chains can be incorporated into cell surfaces in this manner, although the level of conjugate incorporated (for cells treated with a fixed concentration of different PE-PEG-biotin species) varies to some extent with the acyl chain composition of the biotinylated PE-PEG (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Incorporation of lipid-anchored streptavidin conjugates into Jurkat cells.A, anti-streptavidin immunoblot of cells incubated with the indicated concentrations of di-16:0PE-PEG-biotin and followed by 30 μg/ml streptavidin. B, anti-streptavidin immunoblot of cell samples incubated with different PE-PEG-biotin species (4 μm) and subsequently with streptavidin. PE-PEG-biotin acyl chain compositions are indicated as follows: 16:0/18:1, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl; di16:0, dipalmitoyl; di-18:1, dioleoyl; di16:1, dipalmitoleoyl (di-[cis-9′-hexadecenoyl]); di18:2, dilinoleoyl; di-phyt., diphytanoyl (di-[3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-hexadecanoyl]). C, confocal microscopic image of cells incorporating di16:0PE-PEG-anchored Texas Red-streptavidin. Other experimental conditions were as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Quantitation of the amount of streptavidin bound in cells treated as just described, carried out by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of solubilized cell samples alongside known amounts of streptavidin, indicated that cells treated with 0.5–8 μm di16: 0PE-PEG-biotin or 0.25–4 μm di18:2PE-PEG-biotin followed by streptavidin (30 μg/ml) incorporated from 5 × 105 to 6 × 106 molecules of streptavidin/cell depending on the concentration of PE-PEG-biotin used. In analogous experiments we determined that cells treated with CTB under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures” bound 3–4 × 106 molecules of monomeric CTB (6–8 × 105 molecules of CTB pentamer, with each monomer potentially binding one GM1 molecule) per cell. The levels of lipid-anchored streptavidin conjugates incorporated into the cells under our experimental conditions are, thus, comparable with the levels of endogenous GM1. In agreement with the immunoblotting results just described, cells pretreated with PE-PEG-biotin show readily observable surface fluorescence by confocal microscopy after incubation with Texas Red-labeled streptavidin and subsequent washing (Fig. 2C), whereas cells incubated with labeled streptavidin without prior treatment with PE-PEG-biotin showed no detectable fluorescence (not shown). The lipid-anchored streptavidin shows a uniform distribution on the cell surface, both for conjugates with disaturated lipid anchors (as shown in Fig. 2C) and for conjugates with unsaturated anchors (not shown). Similar results were obtained with 3T3-L1 and COS-7 cells in monolayer culture (not shown). To investigate whether disaturated long chain PE-PEG-streptavidin conjugates, once integrated into cellular membranes, could also incorporate into “raft” domains, we examined the distributions of cell-incorporated (saturated) di16:0PE- or (tetraunsaturated) di18:2PE-PEG-streptavidin conjugates on sucrose density gradients after low temperature cell solubilization with Triton X-100. Replicate aliquots of Jurkat cells were treated with either di16:0PE-PEG-biotin or di18:2PE-PEG-biotin followed by streptavidin as described above. Two additional aliquots of cells were labeled with CTB, a GM1-binding protein that is widely used as a raft marker in these cells (8Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J.

Samples of cells labeled with either lipid-PEG-streptavidin conjugate were combined with CTB-treated cells and incubated at 0 °C with Triton X-100 (1%), then loaded under sucrose gradients and centrifuged at 4 °C to separate a low density raft fraction from the bulk of cellular protein, which remains near the bottom of the gradient (26Fra A.M.

Fractions from the gradient were analyzed by Western blotting for streptavidin or CTB or for transferrin receptor as a non-raft marker (30Montixi C. Langlet C Anne-Marie Bernard A.-M. Thimonier J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 6771-6778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Results from a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 3A. A substantial proportion of the di16:0PE-PEG-streptavidin conjugate localizes to low density fractions, as does the CTB-GM1 complex. By contrast, the di18:2PE-PEG-streptavidin conjugate is entirely found in higher density fractions enriched in the transferrin receptor. The fractionation behavior of the di-18:2-streptavidin conjugate was not altered when the cell-incorporated conjugates were cross-linked with anti-streptavidin before detergent fractionation (not shown). A marked difference in the distributions of the di16:0PE- and di18:2PE-PEG-streptavidin conjugates was also observed when 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 3B) or COS-7 cells (not shown) incorporating these markers were fractionated by cold Triton treatment and gradient centrifugation. The divergent fractionation behavior observed for the di16:0PE- and di18:2PE-PEG-streptavidin complexes in the above experiments is in accord with the differing physical properties of their lipid anchors and indicates that remodeling of the lipid moieties must be minimal over the time scale of the experiments described in the remainder of the “Results” section. When PE-PEG-streptavidin conjugates incorporated into sonicated liquid-disordered 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine vesicles were added to Jurkat cells (under which condition incorporation of the conjugates into cellular membranes is expected to be negligible (22Silvius J.R. Zuckermann M.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3153-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar)), no di16:0PE-PEG-streptavidin conjugate was detected in low density fractions upon subsequent cold Triton X-100 treatment and gradient centrifugation as described above (Fig. 3A, bottom blot). This result indicates that the behavior of the di16:0PE conjugate in the above fractionation experiments genuinely reflects the distribution of this species in cellular membranes before Triton addition rather than a redistribution occurring after the addition of detergent. This conclusion agrees with those reported previously (33Schroeder R. London E. Brown D Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) for saturated lipids in model membrane systems containing coexisting liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domains. Cytoplasmic Calcium Measurements—Antibody-mediated cross-linking of either the T-cell receptor complex (using anti-CD3 antibodies) or GM1-bound CTB in Jurkat cells has been reported to trigger intracellular signaling processes mimicking early events in T-cell activation induced by MHCII-mediated antigen presentation (8Janes P.W.

On the basis of detergent fractionation and fluorescence-microscopic experiments which suggest that both the T-cell receptor and CTB-bound GM1 are associated with lipid rafts under these conditions (8Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 30Montixi C. Langlet C Anne-Marie Bernard A.-M. Thimonier J. Dubois C. Wurbel M.-A. Chauvin J.-P.

We therefore examined whether anti(streptavidin)-mediated cross-linking of the cell membrane-inserted PE-PEG-streptavidin conjugates could stimulate these same signaling events, and if so, whether the efficiency of such stimulation was affected by the acyl chain composition o"

Several reports suggest that GATA-1 plays multiple roles in survival, proliferation, and differentiation of erythroid cells. However, little is known about the relationship between the level of GATA-1 expression and its nature of multifunction to affect erythroid cell fate. To address this issue, we developed in vitro embryonic stem (ES) culture system by using OP9 stromal cells (OP9/ES cell co-culture system), and cultured the mutant (GATA-1.05 and GATA-1-null) and wild type (WT)ES cells, respectively. By using this OP9/ES cell co-culture system, primitive and definitive erythroid cells were developed individually, and we examined how expression level of GATA-1 affects the development of erythroid cells. GATA-1.05 ES-derived definitive erythroid cells were immature with the appearance of proerythroblasts, and highly proliferated, compared with WT and GATA-1-null ES-derived erythroid cells. Extensive studies of cell cycle kinetics revealed that the GATA-1.05 proerythroblasts accumulated in S phase and expressed lower levels of p16INK4A than WT ES cell-derived proerythroblasts. We concluded that GATA-1 must achieve a critical threshold activity to achieve selective activation of specific target genes, thereby influencing the developmental decision of an erythroid progenitor cell to undergo apoptosis, proliferation, or terminal differentiation.

We concluded that GATA-1 must achieve a critical threshold activity to achieve selective activation of specific target genes, thereby influencing the developmental decision of an erythroid progenitor cell to undergo apoptosis, proliferation, or terminal differentiation. Transcription factor GATA-1 recognizes conserved GATA motifs ((T/A)GATA(A/G)) in the regulatory regions of many genes encoding erythroid-restricted proteins, such as globins, heme biosynthetic enzymes, membrane proteins, and transcription factors (1Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ferreira R. Ohneda K. Yamamoto M. Philipsen S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1215-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). To analyze the in vivo function(s) of GATA-1, GATA-1-deficient mice were generated (3Fujiwara Y. Browne C.P. Cunniff K. Goff S.C. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12355-12358Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Disruption of primitive erythropoiesis caused GATA-1 homozygous null mutant embryos to die by embryonic day (E) 1The abbreviations used are: E, embryonic day; FBS, fetal bovine serum; ES, embryonic stem; WT, wild type; Epo, erythropoietin; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR; CFU, colony forming unit; FACS, fluorescent activating cell sorter; Rb, retinoblastoma. 1The abbreviations used are: E, embryonic day; FBS, fetal bovine serum; ES, embryonic stem; WT, wild type; Epo, erythropoietin; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR; CFU, colony forming unit; FACS, fluorescent activating cell sorter; Rb, retinoblastoma. 11.5, demonstrating that GATA-1 is required for primitive erythropoiesis. This early demise precluded the possibility of analyzing the role of GATA-1 in definitive erythropoiesis. To experimentally circumvent this impediment, chimeric mice were derived using GATA-1-/- ES cells, and this confirmed that the null mutant cells did not contribute to the mature definitive erythroid pool (4Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.F. D'Agati V. Orkin S.H. Costantini F. Nature. 1991; 349: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Thus, GATA-1 is required for the terminal differentiation of both primitive and definitive erythroid progenitors.We previously utilized an erythroid promoter-specific loss-of-function (knockdown) strategy to generate a GATA-1 hypomorphic (GATA-1.05) allele (5Takahashi S. Komeno T. Suwabe N. Yoh K. Nakajima O. Nishimura S. Kuroha T. Nagasawa T. Yamamoto M. Blood. 1998; 92: 434-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GATA-1 gene is X-linked, and in GATA-1 hemizygous hypomorphic males (GATA-1.05/Y), GATA-1 mRNA was detected at ∼5% of the normal levels. Hence, we termed these mice GATA-1.05 (6Takahashi S. Onodera K. Motohashi H. Suwabe N. Hayashi N. Yanai N. Nabesima Y. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12611-12615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). GATA-1.05/Y embryos exhibited a defective maturation of primitive erythroid cells and died by E12.5 (6Takahashi S. Onodera K. Motohashi H. Suwabe N. Hayashi N. Yanai N. Nabesima Y. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12611-12615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which, like GATA-1-/- embryos, precluded the analysis of the function of GATA-1 in definitive erythropoiesis.Impaired primitive and definitive erythropoiesis in both GATA-1-null and hypomorphic mutant embryos resulted in the generation of extremely limited numbers of erythroid progenitors that could be used for further cytological and molecular analyses. Additionally, we suspected that defective erythropoiesis in the mutant embryos could cause secondary growth retardation, which would in turn affect later hematopoietic development. Under such circumstances where cell-autonomous as well as non-cell-autonomous deficiencies could contribute to the phenotype, it becomes difficult to determine conclusively in vivo how different quantitative levels of GATA-1 may affect the developmental decisions available to an erythroid progenitor cell.The generation of homogenous erythroid populations from ES cells (7Leonard M. Brice M. Engel J.D. Papayannopoulou T. Blood. 1993; 82: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is a useful experimental tool for analyzing the definitive erythroid population in instances where gene-targeted mutation leads to embryonic death prior to the onset of definitive erythropoiesis. In a two-step ES cell in vitro differentiation method, the ES cells are cultured in methylcellulose medium containing stem cell factor and erythropoietin (Epo) (7Leonard M. Brice M. Engel J.D. Papayannopoulou T. Blood. 1993; 82: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, if ES cells are co-cultured with OP9 stromal cells, they differentiate into a hematopoietic cell population that consists of erythrocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, megakaryocytes, and lymphoid cells (8Nakano T. Kodama H. Honjo T. Science. 1994; 265: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Nakano et al. (9Nakano T. Kodama H. Honjo T. Science. 1996; 272: 722-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) developed the ES/OP9 cell co-culture system, in which two waves of erythroid (primitive and definitive) cell production were detected after either 6 or 14 days of induction, respectively. Consequently, the ES/OP9 cell co-culture system reflects not only primitive, but also definitive, erythropoiesis in vivo and is a useful tool for dissecting in vitro the functional role of any molecule of interest during erythroid development.Here, we report that both differentiation and apoptosis are inhibited in GATA-1.05-definitive erythroid cells. Although GATA-1-/--definitive erythroid cells are similarly arrested in differentiation, they, unlike the GATA-1.05 cells, preferentially undergo apoptosis. Hence, we propose that although normal levels of GATA-1 promote terminal differentiation, the low level of intracellular GATA-1 is insufficient to block continuous progenitor proliferation but is sufficient to prevent apoptosis. In contrast, the complete absence of GATA-1 favors an apoptotic response. In this way, graded levels of transcription factor GATA-1 modulate multiple facets of erythroid cell physiology, including survival, proliferation, and differentiation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—E14 ES cells were maintained on embryonic fibroblast cells and kept undifferentiated in the presence of recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor (1000 units/ml, ESGRO, Chemicon International). OP9 cells were cultured as described previously (8Nakano T. Kodama H. Honjo T. Science. 1994; 265: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). After the harvest of ES cells from OP9 feeder cells by trypsinization, 7 × 103 cells were plated onto subconfluent OP9 cells grown in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS, mouse vascular endothelial growth factor (10 ng/ml, Peprotech), and human bone morphogenic protein-4 (5 ng/ml, R&D systems). After 4 days of co-culture, ES cells were trypsinized and replated onto fresh OP9 cells in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS, Epo (2 units/ml; generous gift from Chugai Pharmaceutical), and stem cell factor (50 ng/ml, generous gift from Kirin Brewer Co.).Non-adherent cells observed on day 6 and day 11 were analyzed as primitive and definitive erythroid cells, respectively. To isolate erythroid cells, floating cells were incubated with biotinylated c-Kit (2B8), CD11b (Mac-1, M1/70), and Gr-1 (RB6-8C5) antibodies for 30 min on ice. After washing twice with washing buffer (2% FBS in phosphate-buffered saline), cells were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated Dynabeads (M-280, Dynal Biotech) for 20 min on ice. Subsequently, cells were washed once with washing buffer, and non-adherent cells attached to the magnet (VarioMACS, Miltenyi Biotec) were collected for further experiments.On day 11 of differentiation, adherent cells were examined in CFU-OP9 colony formation assay. After washing the OP9/ES cell co-culture dish with phosphate-buffered saline, adherent cells were trypsinized and resuspended in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated for 1 h to eliminate stromal cells. Non-adherent cells were collected and cultured with OP9 cells for 4–6 days in α-minimal essential medium, 10% FBS in the presence of Epo (2 units/ml) and stem cell factor (50 ng/ml). Cobblestone-like colonies, termed CFU-OP9, developed on OP9 cells and were scored.Flow Cytometry—Cultured ES cells and mouse fetal liver cells (E12.5–E14.5) were harvested and incubated in washing buffer containing Fc block (CD16/CD32; 1:200, BD Pharmingen) for 15 min on ice. Subsequently, cells were washed twice with washing buffer and incubated for 30 min on ice with fluorescence-conjugated antibodies. Then, cells were washed twice and analyzed using FACSCalibur and Vantage (BD Biosciences). The following antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen and used for analyses: allophycocyanin-conjugated c-Kit antibody (2B8), phycoerythrin-conjugated TER119 antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated CD71 antibody (C2), and allophycocyanin-conjugated CD44 antibody (IM7). DNA content analysis was performed as described previously (10Zhang H.S. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 97: 53-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Floating cells were gently harvested from ES/OP9 cell co-culture on day 11, and cells were fixed in 70% ethanol. Then, cells were treated with 50-μg/ml propidium iodide and 100-units/ml RNase A. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using ModFit LT software (Verity Software House).Semiquantitative RT-PCR Assay—Primitive and definitive erythroid cells co-cultured on OP9 stromal cells were harvested, and total RNA was isolated by RNAeasy mini-kit (Qiagen). cDNAs were synthesized using a RT-PCR kit (Clontech) in a 20-μl reaction containing 1 μg of total RNA. An aliquot (1 μl) of synthesized cDNA was amplified in a total volume of 20 μl containing 150 μm dNTP, 0.2 units of Taq polymerase, and 0.12 μg of each pair of primers. The PCR profile consisted of 26–36 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were electrophoretically separated on a 2% agarose gel.

Murine GATA-1 and p16INK4A cDNAs were independently ligated into the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of MSCV-IRES-EGFP. Phoenix-Eco packaging cells were maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. Phoenix-Eco cells at 80% confluency on 6-cm dishes were transfected with 1 μg of DNA using the FuGENE transfection kit (Roche Applied Science). Retroviral supernatant was collected after 72 h and added to NIH3T3 cells to titrate the virus in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). After 4 days, FACS analysis for enhanced green fluorescent protein fluorescence was performed to measure the virus titer. Titers of viruses used in this study were >1 × 107 infectious particles/ml.To establish retroviral packaging cell lines, supernatant from transfected Phoenix-Eco cells was harvested and used to infect PT67 cells (Clontech) in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. After 2–4 days, the brightest green fluorescent protein-expressing cells were sorted using a FACS Vantage and expanded in culture. The expression of GATA-1 and p16INK4A in NIH3T3 cells infected with viral supernatants was confirmed by RT-PCR. Floating cells were removed from 11-day ES/OP9 co-culture, and adherent cells on OP9 stromal cells were trypsinized. After a 1-h incubation on the dish to remove stromal cells, non-adherent cells were replated onto fresh OP9 cells and co-cultured in the presence of the viral supernatant with 4 μg/ml Polybrene for 2 days. The cultures were kept for an additional 4 days in fresh α-minimal essential medium, 10% FBS containing Epo and stem cell factor. The number of colonies that developed on OP9 stromal cells was scored. Floating cells were harvested and cytospin samples were stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa to verify the differentiation stage of erythroid cells.RESULTSDefinitive Erythroid Differentiation of GATA-1.05 and GATA-1-null ES Cells—We previously reported that differentiation in GATA-1.05/Y primitive and definitive erythroid cells was blocked at different stages thereby implicating different requirements for GATA-1 levels during erythroid development in distinct hematopoietic organs, such as the yolk sac and fetal liver (6Takahashi S.

However, there is no clear molecular explanation for how varied GATA-1 levels might differentially affect the development of the primitive and definitive erythroid lineages. To address this question, ES cells carrying WT, GATA-1.05, and GATA-1-null alleles were separately co-cultured with OP9 feeder cells, and the resultant differentiated primitive and definitive erythroid cells were harvested for further analyses.Morphological and gene expression analyses confirmed that ES cells cultured on an OP9 feeder layer differentiated into primitive and definitive erythroid cells from days 6–8 and 11–14, respectively (11Suwabe N. Takahashi S. Nakano T. Yamamoto M. Blood. 1998; 92: 4108-4118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, WT, GATA-1.05, and GATA-1-null ES cells were cultured on OP9 cells for 11 days, and the non-adherent fractions were then subjected to flow cytometric analyses using anti-c-Kit and TER-119 antibodies (Fig. 1, A and B). Mature definitive erythroid cells (c-Kit-TER-119+) were largely absent from GATA-1.05 and GATA-1-null, but not from WT, ES cell cultures (Fig. 1A). In contrast, immature erythroid progenitors (c-Kit+TER-119+) were more abundant in both GATA-1 mutant (GATA-1.05 and GATA-1-null) cultures than in WT cells. Interestingly, the anti-c-Kit signal was ∼10-fold higher in TER-119+GATA-1.05 cells than in WT and GATA-1-null cell equivalents. In addition, GATA-1-null ES cell cultures generated the lowest number of non-adherent erythroid cells (Fig. 1C), hinting at the possibility of reduced proliferation and/or exceptionally high cell death in the null mutant cells (below).We previously reported that the adherent cells in the OP9 co-culture displayed numerous immature hematopoietic cell characteristics based on RT-PCR expression analyses and on morphology of the recovered colonies in methylcellulose medium (11Suwabe N. Takahashi S. Nakano T. Yamamoto M. Blood. 1998; 92: 4108-4118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the number of adherent cells and CFU-OP9 colonies derived from GATA-1.05 ES cells was the highest among the three ES cell types (Fig. 1, D and E), perhaps as a consequence of differentiation arrest and/or increased proliferation in the c-Kit+TER-119+ immature erythroid cells in GATA-1.05 co-cultures.Collectively, we concluded that under conditions that promote erythroid differentiation both varieties of GATA-1 mutant ES cells, which express either no or a small amount of GATA-1 protein, produce predominantly immature proerythroblasts and few mature cells. Furthermore, cells with abnormally high proliferative potential are recovered from GATA-1.05 ES/OP9 cell cultures.Elevated Apoptosis in GATA-1-null Erythroid Cells—May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining revealed that WT ES cells after 6 days in co-culture contained primitive erythroid cells with orthochromatic cytoplasm and large nuclei, whereas immature blast cells with large, prominent nuclei and polychromatic cytoplasm were present in cultures that developed from both kinds of GATA-1 mutant ES cells (Fig. 2, A–C). Uptake of trypan blue dye (indicating dead or dying cells) and nuclear fragmentation (apoptotic intermediates) were most frequently observed in the GATA-1-null ES cell culture (Fig. 2, D and F).Fig. 2Cytological comparison of erythroid cells differentiated from WT or mutant GATA-1 ES cells. Primitive (A–F) and definitive (G–L) erythroid cells harvested on day 6 and 11, respectively, were subjected to May-Grünwald-Giemsa (A–C and G–I), propidium iodide (D–F and J–L), and trypan-blue dye staining. WT primitive erythroid cells with orthochromatic cytoplasm and large nuclei (A) were observed, whereas immature primitive erythroid cells were seen in GATA-1 mutant ES cell cultures (B and C). WT definitive erythroid cells at various differentiation stages (G) were observed, whereas more blast-like cells were seen in GATA-1 mutant ES cell cultures (H and I). Morphologically, these cells appeared to be proerythroblasts. Numerous cells with nuclear fragmentation (black arrow) were noticed in GATA-1-null erythroid cells (I). Propidium iodide staining indicated significantly more apoptotic cells with nuclear fragmentation in 6-day and 11-day (F and L, white arrowhead) GATA-1-null ES cell culture than in WT (D) and GATA-1.05 (E) cultures. #, p < 0.05; *, p < 0.01. Scale bar represents 25 μm. Cells were also stained with trypan-blue solution, and the frequency of dead and dying cells was scored. The number represented (mean ± S.D.) was obtained from four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)WT ES cells, after 11 days in co-culture, contained definitive erythroid cells at various differentiation stages, whereas immature blast cells with large, prominent nuclei were the dominant species recovered in both of the GATA-1 mutant ES cell cultures (Fig. 2, G–I). Using benzidine staining to distinguish terminally differentiated erythroid cells, we noted that the benzidine-positive population was significantly reduced in both GATA-1 mutant, but not in GATA-1+/+ ES cell cultures (WT, 48.7 ± 14.9%; GATA-1.05, 8.1 ± 1.8%; GATA-1-null, 0.4 ± 0.1%). Furthermore, at day 11 of differentiation both trypan blue dye uptake and nuclear fragmentation were observed at the highest frequency in the GATA-1-null ES cell culture (Fig. 2, J–L), indicating unusually high apoptotic activity in GATA-1-/- erythroid progenitors.Taken together, these data indicate that although the low GATA-1 level (5% in the GATA-1.05 mutant cells) is sufficient to avert apoptosis, higher GATA-1 expression levels are necessary to induce terminal erythroid maturation. This observation is consistent with the previous report that GATA-1 could act as a survival factor in committed erythroid cells (12Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9623-9627Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), although the GATA-1 expression level was not determined in that study. Given the intriguing differences observed in ES cells that express graded levels of GATA-1 when exposed to differentiation stimuli, we investigated the activity of candidate GATA-1 target genes during erythroid proliferation versus differentiation.Bcl-xL Is Highly Expressed in GATA-1.05 ES Cell-derived Definitive Erythroid Progenitors—It has been reported that Epo cooperates with GATA-1 to stimulate Bcl-xL gene expression and to maintain erythroid survival, and that Bcl-xL is essential for normal erythroid differentiation (13Gregory T. Yu C. Ma A. Orkin S.H. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 87-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Bcl-xL seems to be a critical downstream effector of GATA-1- and/or Epo-mediated signals. We therefore investigated the expression of several Bcl-2 family members, including Bcl-xL, in primitive and definitive erythroid populations recovered from ES/OP9 cultures (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Expression profiles of genes involved in apoptosis in erythroid cells expressing varying GATA-1 levels. Total RNA isolated from primitive and definitive erythroid cells harvested from day 6 and day 11, respectively, of co-culture was analyzed by RT-PCR (lower (A) and higher PCR cycles (B)). Compared with WT-definitive erythroid cells, Bcl-xL expression was undetected in GATA-1-null (G1-null)-definitive erythroid cells, but was higher in the GATA-1.05 (G1.05) cell equivalents. HPRT, hypoxanthine quanine phosphoribosyl transferase; ddw, deionized distilled water.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although Bcl-2 mRNA was absent in GATA-1-null primitive erythroid cells, it was present at similar levels in definitive erythroid cells differentiated from all three types of ES cells. Bcl-xL expression was not detected in primitive erythroid cells (at day 6) from both GATA-1 mutant ES cell cultures. Bcl-xL expression was also not found in GATA-1-null definitive erythroid cells. Remarkably, however, a slightly higher than normal Bcl-xL mRNA level was observed in GATA-1.05 definitive erythroid cells. These findings strongly suggest that Bcl-xL, but not Bcl-2, is important for cell survival during definitive erythroid differentiation and that low levels of GATA-1 may be adequate for inducing ROM, expression to protect against apoptosis.In contrast, the expression of apoptotic inducers, such as Bax, remained constant during primitive and definitive erythroid differentiation. The stabilization and accumulation of the tumor suppressor protein, p53, has also been shown to contribute to apoptosis. We therefore examined p53 accumulation in GATA-1-mutant erythroid cells. Lower p53 expression was detected in primitive erythroid cells from both GATA-1.05 and GATA-1-null cells compared with WT cells, underscoring the possibility that the apoptosis observed in primitive erythroid GATA-1-null cells is independent of p53, as reported previously (12Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9623-9627Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar).Erythroid Cells Derived from GATA-1 Mutant ES Cells Accumulate in S Phase—It has been reported that forced expression of GATA-1 alters the length of cell cycle segments (14Whyatt D.J. Karis A. Harkes I.C. Verkerk A. Gillemans N. Elefanty A.G. Vairo G. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and that especially high levels of GATA-1 were found to lengthen S phase in NIH3T3 cells (15Dubart A. Romeo P.H. Vainchenker W. Dumenil D. Blood. 1996; 87: 3711-3721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Cullen et al. (16Cullen M.E. Patient R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2464-2469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) showed that GATA-1 activity in mouse erythroleukemia cells was low in G1 phase, peaked in mid-S phase, and then diminished again in G2/M phase and showed that the accumulation patterns of GATA-1 protein and mRNA mirrored one another throughout the cell cycle. It is therefore tempting to speculate that GATA-1 may directly regulate the cell cycle and/or that its expression may be tightly regulated during erythroid differentiation.To determine how the expression level of GATA-1 affects the cell cycle during erythroid maturation, flow cytometric analysis of ES cell-derived hematopoietic cells was initiated. Definitive erythroid cells were collected on day 11 postinduction (Fig. 4A). Although mature definitive erythroid cells from differentiating WT ES cells accumulated in G0/G1 phase, immature definitive erythroid cells in both GATA-1 mutant ES cell cultures accumulated in S phase. These results are consistent with the previous data (Fig. 1, A and B), in which c-Kit+TER-119+ immature cells were found to be more abundant in GATA-1 mutant ES cell cultures, whereas mature definitive erythroid cells (c-Kit-TER-119+) were more abundant in control cultures.Fig. 4Accelerated cell cycle progression in the definitive erythroid cells correlate with reduced GATA-1 level.A, cell cycle distribution of the definitive erythroid cells expressing different levels of GATA-1.

Cyclin D2 mRNA did not vary significantly among definitive erythroid cells recovered from all three ES cell types. Cyclin D-dependent kinases collaborate with cyclin E-Cdk2 to phosphorylate Rb and its family members, p107 and p130, inactivating their growth inhibitory functions and facilitating S phase entry (17Sherr C.J.

Cells inside of domes compared with those outside domes, or with monolayers not exposed to dexamethasone, differed by higher surfactant production, an increased cytokeratin expression, and the localization of claudin-4 proteins to the plasma membrane. In patch clamp studies, amiloride-blockable sodium currents were detected exclusively in cells inside domes, whereas in cells outside of domes, sodium crossed the membrane through La3+-sensitive nonspecific cation channels. Cells grown on permeable support without dexamethasone expressed amiloride-sensitive currents only after tight electrical coupling was achieved (transepithelial electrical resistance (Rt) > 1 kilohm).

In the absence of dexamethasone, neither change in gene expression nor cell uplifting was observed.

The posttranslational acetylation of Nα-protein termini is a common occurrence in eukaryotic proteins where between 50 and 90% of proteins are Nα-acetylated (1Polevoda B. Sherman F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 595-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). However, in prokaryotes, Nα-protein acetylation is limited to four known examples. The early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is Nα-acetylated, and its acetylation has been shown to alter its interaction with the 10-kDa culture filtrate protein (CFP10) (2Okkels L.M. Muller E.C. Schmid M. Rosenkrands I. Kaufmann S.H. Andersen P. Jungblut P.R. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 2954-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The three other examples are the prokaryotic ribosomal proteins S18, S5, and L12, which are Nα-acetylated by the Rim proteins, RimI, RimJ, and RimL, respectively (3Tanaka S. Matsushita Y. Yoshikawa A. Isono K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 217: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4Yoshikawa A. Isono S. Sheback A. Isono K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 209: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). L12 and its Nα-acetylated derivative, L7, have garnered the most interest because of its interesting physical and biological properties. L12 lacks tryptophan, tyrosine, cysteine, and histidine residues and is the most acidic Escherichia coli ribosomal protein (5Terhorst C. Wittmann-Liebold B. Moller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The dimeric L12/L7 complex is the only protein found in more than one copy in the ribosome (6Subramanian A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 95: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and is the only ribosomal protein that has no direct contact with rRNA, instead interacting indirectly via formation of a complex with the L10 protein (7Pettersson I. Hardy S.J. Liljas A. FEBS Lett. 1976; 64: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, the efficiency of protein translation is correlated with the number of L12/L7 dimers bound with maximum efficiency occurring at a ratio of two dimers per ribosome (8Pettersson I. Kurland C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4007-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Griaznova O. Traut R.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4075-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This is due to the interaction of the C-terminal domains of L12/L7 with both elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G and the promotion of GTP hydrolysis by these two elongation factors (10Mohr D. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12520-12528Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11Gudkov A.T. Bubunenko M.G. Biochimie (Paris). 1989; 71: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Finally, whereas S18 and S5 are always found in their Nα-acetylated form, the relative proportions of L12 and L7 are correlated with the rate of growth and the cell cycle (12Ramagopal S. Subramanian A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2136-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Kalpaxis D.L. Karahalios P. Papapetropoulou M.

Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36479-36482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), no known function has been ascribed to the acetylation of prokaryotic ribosomal proteins. Knock-out mutants lacking a functional RimL, RimI, or RimJ exhibit no distinguishable phenotype compared with wild type (16Isono K. Isono S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 177: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17Cumberlidge A.G. Isono K. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 169-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Isono S. Isono K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 183: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the L12/L7 ratio has not been found to affect ribosomal function (19Lockwood A.H. Maitra U. Brot N. Weissbach H. J.

Questions continue to be raised concerning the physiological target(s) of the Rim proteins, their cellular effect, and how they catalyze the acetyltransferase reaction. In particular, the posttranslational Nα-acetylation of dimeric L12 requires a different arrangement of monomers in RimL compared with that observed for eukaryotic histone acetyltransferases (22Vetting M.W. de Carvalho L.P.S. Yu M. Hegde S.S. Magnet S. Roderick S.L. Blanchard J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar).

All of the experiments were performed with a mixture of L12/L7 containing at least 60% L12. The ratio was determined by MALDI-TOF, assuming equivalent ionization of the two forms, that reported L12 concentrations have been corrected for the presence of L7.Cloning and Expression of rimLWT, rimLC134A, and L12—The rimL gene was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from S. typhimurium strain MM1278 and cloned into pET-28a(+) (Novagen), which produced RimL fused to an N-terminal thrombin-cleavable hexahistidine tag. Thrombin cleavage of the gene product leaves three additional non-native amino acids, glycine, serine, and histidine, at the N terminus of RimLST. The L12 gene, also from S. typhimurium strain MM1278 (L12ST), was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA and cloned into pET-23a(+), which produced a C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged version of L12. The QuikChange kit (Stratagene) was used for the mutagenesis of C134 with pET-28a(+)::rimL as the template. All of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. BL21(DE3) cells harboring pET-28a(+)::rimL or pET-28a(+)::rimLC134A were grown in LB media at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.5 was reached and induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 4 h, cells were harvested and stored at –20 °C. BL21(DE3) cells harboring pET23a(+)::L12 were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.3 and induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.5 mm. Cells were harvested after 1 h and frozen at –20 °C.Protein Purification—Frozen cells containing wild type RimLST were thawed and resuspended in 20 mm triethanolamine (TEA), pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, and 50 mm imidazole (buffer A). Protease inhibitor mixture Complete (Roche Applied Science), 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma), and 0.1 mg/ml DNase (Roche Applied Science) were added, and the cell suspension was stirred for 30 min. Cells were lysed by sonication and clarified by centrifugation for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickelnitrilotriacetic acid column (Novagen) preequilibrated with buffer A and washed until no further protein was eluting. Bound proteins were eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration to 250 mm using a 400-ml linear gradient (1 ml/min). Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm TEA, pH 7.8, and 100 mm (NH4)2SO4. Protein used for enzyme assays was made 50% in glycerol and stored at –20 °C. Purification of RimLC134A and L12 followed a similar protocol with minor modifications. L12/L7 preparations are known to be unstable, undergoing spontaneous proteolysis after several weeks (23Liljas A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1982; 40: 161-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), so all of the experiments described here were performed with freshly purified L12ST.Demonstration of L12 Acetylase Activity—A typical reaction consisted of 120 μm [14C]Ac-CoA, 40 μm RimLST, 160 μm L12ST, and 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, in a final volume of 20 μl. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 and 12 h at 25 °C. Samples were boiled in 0.1% SDS containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol in loading buffer dye for 1 min. Protein separation and analysis were performed by SDS-PAGE with PhastGel 10–15% gradient gels. After electrophoresis, gels were stained, air-dried, wrapped in plastic film, and exposed for 24 h in an ImagePlate cassette and quantitated using ImageQuant software provided by the manufacturer. The time dependence of the acetylation of L12ST by RimLST was performed in a similar manner with reactions containing 100 μm [14C]Ac-CoA, 1 μm RimLST, 200 μm L12ST, and 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, incubated at 25 °C.MALDI-TOF of RimL—Determination of the acetylation state of RimLST and complex formation with CoA was performed by MALDI-TOF spectrometry using an Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE mass spectrometer (Laboratory for Macromolecular Analysis and Proteomics-AECOM). Reactions consisted of 5 μg of RimLST incubated at 25 °C for 12 h with or without 0.1 mm Ac-CoA in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, in a 20-microliter volume. One sample of each reaction was subjected to cleavage with 25 ng of thrombin and 50 mm CaCl2. Reactions were analyzed by MALDI-TOF.Kinetic Assays—Kinetic studies were conducted at 25 °C in a UVIKON XL equipped with a constant temperature-circulating water bath and thermospacers. A typical reaction contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 μm Ac-CoA, 45 μm 4,4′-dithiodipyridine (4,4′-DTP), and 40 nm RimLWT or RimLC134A in a final volume of 1 ml. The reaction rate was measured by following the increase in the absorbance at 324 nm resulting from the reaction of CoA with 4,4′-DTP (ϵm = 19,800 m–1 cm–1 at 324 nm). There is no detectable reaction of 4,4′-DTP with RimLST or L12ST at the concentrations used in this work. Discontinuous and continuous assays using 4,4′-DTP yielded similar initial reaction rates, so continuous assays were chosen to monitor L12ST acetylation. Reactions were started by the addition of RimL after a 1-min preincubation at 25 °C. Initial velocity data were analyzed by Lineweaver-Burke plots.Dynamic light scattering was measured with a DynaPro MS/X dynamic light-scattering instrument (Protein Solutions) with samples of thrombin-cleaved RimLST at 15 mg/ml in 20 mm TEA, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm (NH4)2SO4.Crystallization—All four RimLST crystal forms were obtained by vapor diffusion under oil (Silicon-FISHER) by combining 3 μl of RimLST (in 20 mm TEA, pH 8.0, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4) with 3 μl of various precipitants and incubating at 18 °C. For crystal form 2 and the two CoA binary complexes, the protein was first treated with thrombin to remove the hexahistidine tag and further purified on a Q-Sepharose column. Crystal form 1, which retained the hexahistidine tag and was utilized for heavy atom phasing, grew from solutions containing 0.8–1.2 m sodium malonate, pH 7.8, with RimLST at 8 mg/ml. A second apostructure was obtained from crystals that grew from solutions containing 15–25% polyethylene glycol 3350, 200 mm NaCl, and RimLST at 15 mg/ml. The tetragonal binary complex (form 3) crystallized in 40–50% PEE 797 (pentaerythritiol ethoxylate), 0.2 m (NH4)2SO4, 5 mm Ac-CoA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and RimLST at 50 mg/ml, whereas the monoclinic binary complex (form 4) crystallized in 40–50% PEP 426 (pentaerythritiol propoxylate), 0.2 m KCl, 5 mm TCEP (tri(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride), 5 mm Ac-CoA, and RimLST at 20 mg/ml.Data Collection—Prior to data collection, all of the samples were vitrified by immersion into liquid nitrogen and then mounted in the cryostream. Crystal forms 1 and 2 were cryoprotected by including 25% trehalose or 20% isopropyl alcohol, respectively, in the mother liquor, whereas in the binary CoA complexes, the pentaerythritiols acted as cryoprotectants. All of the x-ray data sets were collected on a MSC R-Axis IV++ image plate detector using CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU-H3R x-ray generator and processed using DENZO/SCALEPACK (24Otwinowski Z.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of RimLST was determined by SIRAS (single isomorphous replacement) utilizing quick-soak derivatization (25Sun P.D. Radaev S. Kattah M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A single crystal of RimLST (form 1) was soaked in the cryoprotectant mother liquor supplemented with 40 mm mercuric acetate for 10 min and then back-soaked in the same solution without mercuric acetate for 10 s prior to vitrification. The program SOLVE/RESOLVE (26Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) was used to locate the four mercury binding sites and to calculate the SIRAS phases to 2.4 Å. The figure of merit after SOLVE was 0.479 (0.535 at 2.4–2.5 Å), rising to 0.658 (0.822 at 2.4–2.5 Å) after density modification. The SIRAS SOLVE/RESOLVE map was of sufficient quality for the program MAID (27Levitt D.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) to autobuild ∼60% structure, whereas manual rebuilding resulted in an initial model that was ∼85% complete. The second apostructure and two binary complexes were determined by molecular replacement as implemented in AmoRe (28Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). All of the model building and refinement were carried out using the programs O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M.

Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe thrombin-cleavable N-terminal His6 tag construction used to facilitate the purification of RimLST adds 20 amino acids to the native N terminus (MGSSHHHHHHSS-GLVPRGSH-RimLST). MALDI-TOF analysis of the recombinant purified RimLST exhibited a mass of 22,679.0 Da corresponding to the demethionylated N-terminally His-tagged RimLST (predicted mass: 22,637.6 Da) with one acetyl modification (+42 Da). Thrombin cleavage resulted in a RimLST derivative with a mass of 20,883.0 Da, which corresponds to the expected mass of RimLST minus the 17 N-terminal residues lost due to thrombin cleavage (20,886.8 Da). This finding suggests that the acetylated residue was located within the N-terminal 17 residues. The Rim proteins have substrates with either a serine or alanine as the penultimate residue, and it is likely that the recombinant RimLST has catalyzed autoacetylation at the N-terminal glycine after demethionylation. When thrombin-cleaved RimLST was incubated with Ac-CoA, the mass of the protein was unchanged (20,884.0 Da), indicating that GSH-RimLST does not autoacetylate the less exposed N-terminal glycine residue. Autoacetylation of this particular tag by other Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) family members, including the (6′)-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase from Salmonella enterica (AAC(6′)-Iy), has been previously documented (33Vetting M.W. Magnet S. Nieves E. Roderick S.L. Blanchard J.S. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 565-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly, incubation of either the tagged or thrombin-cleaved forms with Ac-CoA resulted in additional higher masses (23,444.0 and 21,654.4 Da, respectively), representing 10–15% protein sample. The size difference suggests a tight complex between RimLST and CoA (+767.6 Da) and is consistent with the Km determined for Ac-CoA and/or a possible covalent complex between RimLST and CoA as observed in one of the crystal structures (see below).In E. coli and Salmonella, the ratio of L12/L7 was found to vary with growth where the proportion as L12 was highest during logarithmic growth (12Ramagopal S. Subramanian A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2136-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Kalpaxis D.L. Karahalios P. Papapetropoulou M. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 14Abshire K.Z. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3744-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To generate L12 substrate, cells expressing L12ST were harvested early during logarithmic growth where L12 was greater than 70% total L12/L7.RimLST readily acetylates purified L12ST followed by incubation with [14C]Ac-CoA (Supplemental Figs. 1–3) with the majority of L12 converted to L7 within the first 10 min. Using 4,4′-DTP to react with the product CoASH (ϵ = 19,800 m–1 cm–1 at 324 nm), we were able to spectrophotometrically determine the Km values for Ac-CoA (<0.5 μm) and L12ST (1.0 ± 0.2 μm) and a Vmax of 21 ± 1 min–1. The activity is highly time-dependent, and activity is lost after 2–3 min under the conditions of the continuous spectrophotometric assay (Supplemental Figs. 1–3).General Fold—The three-dimensional structure of RimLST was solved by isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering from a single mercury derivative collected on a home source. The structure of RimLST was determined in two apocrystal forms and subsequently in two CoA binary-complex crystal forms. The relatively compact 179 amino acid RimLST monomer exhibits the GNAT fold with the topology β0, β1, α1, α2, β2, β3, β4, α3, β5, α4, β6, and β7 (Fig. 1A). The β-strands pack into a predominately antiparallel β-sheet with the order β0, β1, β2, β3, β4, β5, β7, and β6. The sheet exhibits a V-like appearance due to the splaying of the only parallel-interacting strands β4 and β5. The α1 and α2 helices lie on one side of this central β-sheet with α3 and α4 helices on the other side.Dimerization—Evidence from dynamic light scattering, ultracentrifugation, and gel filtration experiments suggests that RimLST exists as a homodimer in solution (data not shown). An identical monomer-monomer contact was observed in all four crystal forms, despite their unique crystallographic packing arrangements, suggesting that this is the physiological dimer (Fig. 1B). At the dimer interface, the outermost strand (β6) from each monomer interacts in an antiparallel fashion to form a continuous β-sheet that contains at its center the β5-β7-β6-β6′-β7′-β5′ strands. This dimer interface is predominately formed by polar interactions, and a combined surface area of 2238 Å2 is buried upon its formation. Dimerization through C-terminal strands to form a continuous β-sheet across the dimer is common in prokaryotic GNAT enzymes (34Burk D.L. Ghuman N. Wybenga-Groot L.E. Berghuis A.M. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 426-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The construction of the RimLST dimer generates a rectangular trough 30-Å long, 13-Å wide, and 15–20-Å deep at the dimer 2-fold. Strands β5-β7 and β5′-β7′ generate the floor of the trough with β2-β4 and α1-α2 as the long edges and the loops between β6 and β7, β3 and β4, and α1 and α2, which contain two 310 helices (310a, 310b), as the short edges. This trough provides a surface to which the protein substrate might bind and react with Ac-CoA, located in opposite corners at the bottom of the trough. The surface of the trough is lined with a mixture of both polar and aliphatic residues consistent with the nature of the protein substrate with which it must interact. Overall, the surface of RimLST has a mixture of positive and negative electrostatic regions, although there are three fully or partially exposed acidic side chains within the trough (Asp-40, Glu-88, and Glu-160), which give the trough a slight electronegative propensity.A structural similarity search using the secondary structure matching algorithm (35Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar) yielded matches to several GNAT family members. The highest scoring was the Bacillus subtilis protein YdaF (PDB code 1NSL). Interestingly, the entire dimer of YdaF and RimLST could be superimposed with an r.m.s.d. of 1.9 Å over 324 common Cα atoms. As such, YdaF and RimLST have a similar dimer interface and active site trough. YdaF has been proposed to be the B. subtilis homologue of RimL based on comparative sequence analysis (36Brunzelle J.S. Wu R. Korolev S.V. Collart F.R. Joachimiak A. Anderson W.F. Proteins. 2004; 57: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), although it only exhibits 23% sequence identity with RimLST. In addition, the acetyl-transferase activity of YdaF has not been demonstrated. Our structural superposition suggests that YdaF may indeed be the B. subtilis RimL acetyltransferase.Interaction of RimLST with CoA—Despite cocrystallizing the protein with Ac-CoA, the two binary complex crystal forms do not exhibit electron density for the acetyl group, suggesting that the high energy thioester bond is hydrolyzed over the lifetime of the experiments. The interactions between CoA and RimLST are similar to those that have been observed in a number of GNAT family members (22Vetting M.W. de Carvalho L.P.S. Yu M. Hegde S.S. Magnet S. Roderick S.L. Blanchard J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The adenosine moiety, while clearly visible in the electron density, is located on the back surface of the molecule away from the trough and does not interact substantially with the protein. In contrast, the pyrophosphate and pantetheine moieties of CoA form 15 direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds with RimLST in addition to several van der Waals contacts (Fig. 2A). The pyrophosphate oxygens interact with the β4-α3 loop (“P-loop”) through a number of backbone amides and a conserved water molecule. The splaying of the β4 and β5 strands is used to coordinate the pantetheine arm of CoA, which forms an anti-parallel strandstrand-like interaction with β4.Fig. 2Interaction of RimLST with CoA.A, illustration of the polar and hydrophobic interactions of CoA with RimLST. B, 2Fo – Fc electron density map contoured at 1σ showing the disulfide bond between CoA and Cys-134 in crystal form 3. C, interaction between CoA (brown carbons) and RimLST in crystal form 4. A model of the interaction of the Ac-CoA acetyl moiety (black carbons) is also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A comparison of the apoforms and CoA-bound forms indicates that RimLST undergoes a conformational change upon binding cofactor. Apocrystal forms 1 and 2 exhibited no electron density for residues 43–45 and 32–50, respectively. Upon binding CoA, the loop connecting α1 and α2 becomes ordered (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, in crystal form 1 where a portion of this flexible loop is ordered and binds a chloride ion, residues 39–41 are located within the active site pocket with the side chain of Asp-40 hydrogen bonded to the backbone amide of Tyr-98. This interaction is similar to that made with the acetyl group of AcCoA (see below). Upon binding CoA (form 4), residues 39–41 flip outward and form a 310 helix. This conformational change creates interactions of hydrophobic residues Trp-34, Leu-35, and Leu-39 with the pantetheine arm of CoA. A similar arrangement of hydrophobic residues is seen in the corresponding loop of the B. subtilis protein YdaF in which Trp-36 and Leu-38 are blocking access to Ac-CoA in the apo-structure (36Brunzelle J.S. Wu R. Korolev S.V. Collart F.R. Joachimiak A. Anderson W.F. Proteins. 2004; 57: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).In addition to these localized conformational changes, more global changes are observed upon the binding of CoA. There is an increase in the splaying of β4 from β5 and therefore a global movement between the N- and C-terminal halves of the molecule. A superposition of the monomers of the apostructure (form 1) and the binary complex (form 4) yields a r.m.s.d. of 1.0 Å over 164 similar atoms. These changes are especially apparent when the six central β-strands (β5-β5′) are used as the superpositional unit. Although the C-terminal residues exhibit a r.m.s.d. of 0.57 Å (98 common Cαs), the N-terminal residues exhibit a r.m.s.d. of 2.4 Å (228 common Cαs). Some of the largest deviations occur in the position of α1 and α2, which border the CoA and L12 binding site. The global movement within the first 100 residues and the ordering of the mobile loop between α1 and α2 change the relative positions and composition of residues that line the trough and therefore will affect protein substrate binding. It can be envisioned that changes in the structure may be used to provide a measure of cooperativity in which the binding of Ac-CoA enhances the binding of the second substrate, the primary amine. Such cooperativity has been observed in other GNAT proteins, especially sheep serotonin acetyltransferase (37Hickman A.B. N"

Herein, we identify and characterize an association between actopaxin and the serine/threonine kinase testicular protein kinase 1 (TESK1), a ubiquitously expressed protein previously reported to regulate cellular spreading and focal adhesion formation via phosphorylation of cofilin. The interaction between actopaxin and TESK1 is direct and the binding sites were mapped to the carboxyl terminus of both proteins. The association between actopaxin and TESK1 is negatively regulated by adhesion to fibronectin, and a phosphomimetic actopaxin mutant that promotes cell spreading also exhibits impaired binding to TESK1. Binding of actopaxin to TESK1 inhibits TESK1 kinase activity in vitro. Expression of the carboxyl terminus of actopaxin has previously been reported to retard cell spreading. This effect was reversed following overexpression of TESK1 and was found to be dependent on an inability of actopaxin carboxyl terminus expressing cells to promote cofilin phosphorylation upon matrix adhesion and caused by retention of TESK1 by this actopaxin mutant. Thus, the association between actopaxin and TESK1, which is likely regulated by phosphorylation of actopaxin, regulates TESK1 activity and subsequent cellular spreading on fibronectin.

Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). Activated Rho family members interact with numerous effectors, including the p21-associated kinase (PAK), the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP), and the Rho-associated kinase (ROCK).

Closely related to the LIM family of kinases are TESK1 and TESK2 (testicular protein kinases), which were originally identified in testicular cells but have since been found to be ubiquitously expressed (2Toshima J.

Phosphorylation on serine 3, which is reversed by the serine phosphatases slingshot and chronophin, has been shown to decrease cofilin activity by interfering with its ability to bind F-actin (9Bamburg J.R.

Affixin, the β-isoform of the parvin family, has been found to bind the putative Rac/Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor PIX suggesting the possibility of this interaction for actopaxin as well (23Rosenberger G. Jantke I. Gal A. Kutsche K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The associations between actopaxin, ILK, and paxillin constitute an evolutionarily conserved integrin-actin linkage important in muscle cytoarchitecture and contribute to the regulation of cellular spreading and adhesion in mesenchymal cells (18Nikolopoulos S.N.

Recent evidence suggests that Erk-dependent phosphorylation of the actopaxin amino terminus regulates cellular spreading and motility via modulation of Rho family signaling (27Clarke D.M. Brown M.C. LaLonde D.P. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human placenta library using actopaxin as bait and identified TESK1 as a direct binding partner. We have established that an association between actopaxin and TESK1 negatively regulates TESK1 kinase activity and thus phosphorylation of cofilin. Furthermore, this association is negatively modulated by adhesion to fibronectin, most likely through phosphorylation of the amino terminus of actopaxin. Consequently, the association between TESK1 and actopaxin provides a mechanism for the regulation of cell spreading and potentially cell migration via modulation of cofilin activity. Antibodies and Materials—Human plasma fibronectin was purchased from Sigma or BD Biosciences. Monoclonal antibody to the Xpress tag was purchased from Invitrogen. α-Actinin and MOPC monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and ILK monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. The 9E10 anti-Myc monclonal antibody developed by J. M. Bishop was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD and maintained by The University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA. Omni-probe (directed against region of Xpress epitope tag) and GFP polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibody to cofilin phosphorylated upon serine 3 was provided by Dr. James Bamburg (Colorado State University) (28Meberg P.J. Ono S. Minamide L.S. Takahashi M. Bamburg J.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 172-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The MoBiTec Grow'n'Glow Two-Hybrid System (MoBiTec, Goettingen, Germany) based on the Brent LexA Interaction Trap System was used to identify proteins that interact with actopaxin. Full-length rat actopaxin and the “nonspecific” protein bait, mouse p53 (aa 72–390), were cloned into pEG202 (His3 selectable marker) as a COOH-terminal fusion to LexA. To moderate the inherent transactivation potential of full-length actopaxin, we utilized the low sensitivity Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EGY188 that contains two copies of the LexA operator upstream of the LEU2 reporter integrated in the genome. A GFP reporter plasmid (pGNG1) with a URA3 selectable marker was used in place of a β-galactosidase reporter, allowing for simple screening by UV transillumination. A human placenta cDNA library in pJG4-5 (TRP1 selectable marker), fused to the activation domain B42, was employed in the screen. Plasmids were sequentially transformed by lithium acetate, into EGY188. Positive pJG4-5 library/prey plasmids were isolated, and a directed interaction of the positive, isolated library/prey with nonspecific protein bait, p53, was performed. A directed interaction with actopaxin plasmid was also performed to confirm the association. True positive clones were sequenced at the BioResource Center of Cornell University (Ithaca, NY). Plasmids—To generate full-length human TESK1, PCR primer pairs were synthesized representing the 5′ and 3′ termini of the published TESK1 coding sequence incorporating EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites. A human heart cDNA library (Clontech) was used for PCR amplification. The product obtained was identical to that reported previously, except that nucleotides 31–111, representing amino acids 11–37, were absent. Notably this stretch of coding sequence represents human exon 2 suggesting the existence of a new TESK1 splice isoform. Full-length rat TESK1 and TESK2 Myc-tagged constructs were generously provided by Dr. Kensaku Mizuno (Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan) (2Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Takeuchi K. Mori R. Mizuno K. J.

A pGEX-4T TESK1 carboxyl-terminal (aa 529–626) fusion protein was generated for use in precipitation assays. A construct encoding TESK1 1–528 with an amino-terminal GFP tag was created via PCR amplification. Actopaxin constructs were as described previously (18Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J.

GFP-XAC (Xenopus actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin), hereafter referred to as GFP-cofilin, constructs were provided by Dr. James Bamburg (Colorado State University) (30Bernstein B.W. Painter W.B.

Cell Culture and Transfections—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals). Transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to manufacturer's protocols. Binding Assays—GST binding assays were performed essentially as described previously (18Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For in vivo binding experiments, cells were lysed in co-immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm NaVO4, and 1 mm NaF). Lysates were centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and then Xpress-actopaxin was precipitated using Omni-probe antibody (anti-epitope tag of Xpress-actopaxin) and protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitated proteins were subsequently solubilized in sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. In Vitro Kinase Assays—Kinase assays were performed essentially as described previously (3Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). HeLa cells expressing Myc-TESK1 were lysed in kinase immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), incubated on ice, and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. The resulting supernatant was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with protein A/G beads and either control antibody (MOPC) or 9E10 anti-Myc antibody. Immune complexes were then washed three times in wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and twice in reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2). Immunoprecipitated Myc-TESK1 was then resuspended in reaction buffer and incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the presence of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μg of focal adhesion kinase (MBP), and various GST-actopaxin constructs as indicated. The reaction was terminated by boiling in sample buffer and the samples resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel, followed by Coomassie Blue staining and autoradiography. Phosphorylation levels were quantitated with a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Respreadings and Immunofluorescence—These assays were performed as described previously (27Clarke D.M.

Area values obtained were compared with GFP-expressing control cells in the same experiment and further normalized against attached, unspread cells to quantitate comparative spreading capacities. For phosphocofilin staining, coverslips were fixed in cytoskeletal stabilization buffer (3.7% formaldehyde, 0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm MES, pH 6.1, 3 mm MgCl2, 138 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA) for 15 min, then processed as described (27Clarke D.M.

Actopaxin Interacts with TESK1 in Vitro—To identify actopaxin-binding proteins, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed with full-length rat actopaxin fused to LexA as a bait. Ten positive clones were isolated from the screening of 1 × 106 recombinant colonies. To confirm the observed interactions, selected clones were subjected to an additional round of screening using either p53 as a nonspecific protein bait or actopaxin. Two of the plasmids that were positive for actopaxin binding and at the same time negative for p53 association encoded sequence representing the serine/threonine kinase testicular protein kinase 1 (TESK1) (data not shown). One plasmid insert contained DNA encoding aa 529–626, comprising the carboxyl terminus of TESK1, as well as 80 nucleotides from the 3′-untranslated region. The second plasmid contained aa 544–626 and 74 nucleotides from the 3′-untranslated region. It is notable that the principal difference between TESK1 and its family member TESK2 is the presence of this proline-rich carboxyl terminus extension within TESK1 (5Rosok O. Pedeutour F. Ree A.H. Aasheim H.C. Genomics. 1999; 61: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An association between actopaxin and TESK1 was first confirmed using GST binding assays. These studies were restricted to the analysis of exogenous TESK1 due to the lack of an available antibody to the endogenous form. Myc-tagged TESK1 and TESK2 were expressed in HeLa cells and actopaxin binding tested using GST-actopaxin fusion proteins. TESK1 was found to specifically bind full-length GST-actopaxin (Fig. 1A). In contrast, GST-actopaxin did not precipitate TESK2, consistent with the absence of the carboxyl-terminal extension of TESK1 in this isoform (Fig. 1A). The binding of ILK served as a positive control. Additional GST pull-down assays established the carboxyl-terminal actopaxin amino acids 223–372 as the binding region for TESK1 (Fig. 1, B and C). This region of actopaxin consists of a portion of the intra-CH linker domain and the second CH domain. It also contains the binding sites for paxillin and ILK (18Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 22Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1568-1575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid screen identified the carboxyl-terminal 98 residues of TESK1 as the site of interaction with actopaxin. A construct was created consisting of this portion of TESK1 (529–626) fused to the carboxyl terminus of GFP. Pull-down assays confirmed the binding of GFP-TESK1 529–626 to GST-actopaxin (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, a GST fusion construct of this region of TESK1 was created to verify binding with actopaxin. GST binding assays performed using HeLa cell lysates demonstrated binding of endogenous actopaxin to GST-TESK1 529–626, while the GST-paxillin LD4 motif served as a positive control for actopaxin binding, as reported previously (Fig. 2B) (18Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that ILK and actopaxin are obligate binding partners (32Fukuda T. Chen K. Shi X. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51324-51333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, ILK was not present in the GST-TESK1 precipitate, indicating that TESK1 can bind a pool of actopaxin that is not concurrently bound to ILK (Fig. 2B). Conversely, the presence of ILK and actopaxin in the LD4 pull-down shows that existing actopaxin/ILK associations were not disrupted in these lysates as paxillin LD4 only binds ILK indirectly through actopaxin (22Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1568-1575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 33Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23499-23505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Actopaxin and TESK1 Interact in Vivo—The association between TESK1 and actopaxin was demonstrated in vivo using co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Epitope-tagged versions of these proteins were co-expressed in HeLa cells and immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal antibody (Omni-probe) to the epitope-tag of actopaxin. Myc-TESK1, but not FAK, was co-immunoprecipitated with full-length Xpress-actopaxin (Fig. 3A). Consistent with the GST pull-down assays, TESK1 co-immunoprecipitated with the carboxyl terminus of actopaxin (aa 223–372) (Fig. 3B). FAK served as a negative control, while ILK binding to the actopaxin carboxyl terminus was used as a positive control (Fig. 3B). These data demonstrate that actopaxin and TESK1 are associated in asynchronously growing cells. The Association between TESK1 and Actopaxin Is Negatively Regulated during Adhesion to Fibronectin—Cell attachment and spreading on the ECM leads to the activation of integrins and, in turn, Rho GTPases and is a widely accepted model for lamellipodia extension associated with cell migration. To determine whether the interaction between TESK1 and actopaxin might be modulated during cell spreading, we performed co-immunoprecipitations of co-transfected proteins in HeLa cells that were growing asynchronously in culture versus cells that had been actively spreading upon 10 μg/ml fibronectin for 90 min. Actopaxin precipitated Myc-TESK1 less efficiently in spreading cells than unstimulated cells (Fig. 4A). Adhesion-dependent phosphorylation of actopaxin affects cell spreading and migration. This post-translational modification of actopaxin may exert its effects by altering its association with various binding partners. To test whether this is the case for TESK1, HeLa cells were co-transfected with Myc-TESK1 and either wild type or phosphomimetic (S4/8D) Xpress-actopaxin constructs (27Clarke D.M. Brown M.C. LaLonde D.P. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations using an antibody to the actopaxin epitope-tag showed that the phosphomimetic S4/8D Xpress-actopaxin failed to precipitate Myc-TESK1, while the wild-type Xpress-actopaxin displayed robust binding (Fig. 4B). The specificity of this result was confirmed by the observation that ILK was precipitated by both Xpress-actopaxin constructs (Fig. 4B). As the sites of actopaxin phosphorylation are on the amino terminus of the protein, while the carboxyl terminus mediates TESK1 binding, the actopaxin phosphorylation-dependent abrogation of TESK1 binding may involve allosteric regulation between the amino and carboxyl terminus of actopaxin. Thus, we next co-transfected Myc-TESK1 with either full-length (aa 1–372) or carboxyl-terminal (aa 223–372) Xpress-actopaxin constructs. Notably, the carboxyl terminus of actopaxin contains the TESK1 binding site but lacks the phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1B). Both populations of cells were placed in suspension and then were allowed to adhere to 10 μg/ml fibronectin for 90 min, followed by immunoprecipitations of the actopaxin constructs. Binding of TESK1 to the carboxyl terminus of actopaxin was retained, while full-length actopaxin displayed a diminished association upon adhesion (Fig. 4C). In contrast, both Xpress-actopaxin constructs were able to precipitate ILK (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that an adhesion-dependent modification of the actopaxin amino terminus, such as phosphorylation, serves to regulate TESK1 binding to the carboxyl terminus of actopaxin. Actopaxin Binding Inhibits TESK1 Kinase Activity—Cell adhesion stimulates TESK1 kinase activity (3Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), which inversely correlates with actopaxin binding. Thus, we tested whether actopaxin binding affected TESK1 kinase activity, as has been observed previously for the associations between TESK1 and 14-3-3β and Sprouty4 (7Tsumura Y. Toshima J. Leeksma O.C. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Biochem. J. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 8Toshima J.Y. Toshima J. Watanabe T. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43471-43481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Myc-TESK1 was immunoprecipitated, and in vitro kinase assays were performed in the presence of GST-actopaxin fusion proteins using MBP as a substrate. The ability of Myc-TESK1 to phosphorylate MBP was reduced by ∼40–50% in the presence of both full-length (aa 1–372) and carboxyl-terminal (aa 223–372) GST-actopaxin fusion proteins as compared with GST alone (Fig. 5A,B). Both of these actopaxin fusion proteins bind TESK1 (Fig. 1B). Conversely, a GST fusion protein consisting of the amino terminus (aa 1–222) of actopaxin, which does not bind TESK1, failed to inhibit TESK1 kinase activity (Fig. 1B and Fig. 5, A and B). Therefore, Myc-TESK1 kinase activity is reduced by interaction with actopaxin. Interestingly, the difference in activity of TESK1 in the presence versus the absence of actopaxin that we observed is equivalent to the relative changes in TESK1 activity that occurred upon adhesion to fibronectin (3Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), with a near doubling of kinase activity. A low level of phosphorylation of the actopaxin amino terminus (aa 1–222) and full-length GST fusion proteins was also observed in these assays, suggesting TESK1 kinase activity may, in turn, regulate actopaxin function in vivo via direct phosphorylation (Fig. 5C). Expression of the Carboxyl Terminus of Actopaxin Inhibits Adhesion-dependent Cofilin Phosphorylation—Since the carboxyl terminus of actopaxin retains binding to TESK1 during adhesion and inhibits its kinase activity in vitro, this mutant can be used as a tool to evaluate the effects on cell function of alteration of the physiologic association between TESK1 and actopaxin. Specifically, we evaluated how introduction of this mutant influenced phosphorylation of the TESK1 substrate cofilin during cell spreading on fibronectin. HeLa cells were co-transfected with GFP-cofilin and either Xpress-actopaxin 223–372 or Xpress-β-galactosidase, as a control, and respread on 10 μg/ml fibronectin-coated culture dishes. Lysates were collected in suspension and at 30, 60, and 120 min post-respreading. Phospho-GFP cofilin levels were then measured by Western blotting with an antibody specific for phosphorylation on serine 3, the site phosphorylated by TESK1 that inactivates cofilin. Phosphoserine 3 GFP cofilin levels are diminished in the Xpress-actopaxin 223–372-expressing cells during spreading on fibronectin (Fig. 6A). This assay was repeated following the co-transfection of Myc-TESK1 to determine whether the observed deficit of cofilin phosphorylation could be rescued. Indeed, introduction of TESK1 was found to rescue the cofilin phosphorylation defect observed in the Xpress-actopaxin 223–372 cells at the 90-min time point (Fig. 6B, lanes 4 and 5). TESK1 Rescues the Spreading Defect in Cells Expressing the Actopaxin Carboxyl Terminus—The importance of the TESK1/actopaxin association in regulating cell morphology was examined by evaluating effects on cell spreading.

https://openalex.org/W2002549181,"Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I (Top1p) has important functions in DNA replication, transcription, and recombination. This enzyme also constitutes the cellular target of camptothecin (CPT), which induces S-phase-dependent cytotoxicity. To define cellular pathways that regulate cell sensitivity to Top1p-induced DNA lesions, we described a yeast genetic screen for conditional tah (top1T722A-hypersensitive) mutants with enhanced sensitivity to low levels of the CPT mimetic mutant top1T722A (Reid, R.

R., Guo, H., Thimmaiah, P., Benedetti, P., and Bjornsti, M. A. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 21271-21281). Here we report that tah mutant ubc9-10 harbors a hypomorphic allele of UBC9, which encodes the essential SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) E2-conjugating enzyme. The same conditional ubc9P123L mutant was also isolated in an independent screen for enhanced sensitivity to a distinct Top1p poison, Top1N726Hp. The ubc9-10 mutant exhibited a decrease in global protein sumoylation and increased sensitivity to a wide range of DNA-damaging agents independent of Top1p. Deletion of the Ulp2 SUMO protease failed to restore ubc9-10 cell resistance to Top1p poisons or hydroxyurea yet adversely affected wild-type TOP1 cell genetic stability and sensitivity to hydroxyurea. Moreover, although mutation of different consensus SUMO sites in the N terminus and linker region of yeast Top1p failed to recapitulate ubc9-10 mutant phenotypes, they revealed distinct and subtle effects on cell sensitivity to CPT. These results provide insights into the complexities of SUMO conjugation and the confounding effects of SUMO modification on Top1p function and cell sensitivity to genotoxic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1983501707,"Classic models of receptor desensitization and internalization have been largely based on the behavior of Family A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The glucagon-like peptide-2 receptor (GLP-2R) is a member of the Family B glucagon-secretin GPCR family, which exhibit significant sequence and structural differences from the Family A receptors in their intracellular and extracellular domains. To identify structural motifs that regulate GLP-2R signaling and cell surface receptor expression, we analyzed the functional properties of a series of mutant GLP-2Rs. The majority of the C-terminal receptor tail was dispensable for GLP-2-induced cAMP accumulation, ERK1/2 activation, and endocytosis in transfected cells. However, progressive truncation of the C terminus reduced cell surface receptor expression, altered agonist-induced GLP-2R trafficking, and abrogated protein kinase A-mediated heterologous receptor desensitization. Elimination of the distal 21 amino acids of the receptor was sufficient to promote constitutive receptor internalization and prevent agonist-induced recruitment of β-arrestin-2. Site-directed mutagenesis identified specific amino acid residues within the distal GLP-2R C terminus that mediate the stable association with β-arrestin-2. Surprisingly, although the truncated mutant receptors failed to interact with β-arrestin-2, they underwent homologous desensitization and subsequent resensitization with kinetics similar to that observed with the wild-type GLP-2R. Our data suggest that, although the GLP-2R C terminus is not required for coupling to cellular machinery regulating signaling or desensitization, it may serve as a sorting signal for intracellular trafficking. Taken together with the previously demonstrated clathrin and dynamin-independent, lipid-raft-dependent pathways for internalization, our data suggest that GLP-2 receptor signaling has evolved unique structural and functional mechanisms for control of receptor trafficking, desensitization, and resensitization.

The cytoprotective effects of GLP-2, demonstrated in rodent models of intestinal injury (for review, see Ref. 11Estall J.L. Drucker D.J. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 3708-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), have generated interest in the use of long-acting GLP-2 analogs for the treatment of human intestinal disease. Because long-acting GPCR agonists promote persistent receptor activation, concerns have been raised regarding possible down-regulation of receptor signaling. The mechanisms regulating GPCR desensitization, down-regulation, and intracellular trafficking have been extensively characterized for members of the Family A rhodopsin-like GPCRs (for review, see Ref. 12Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar), but few studies have addressed whether these cellular processes are conserved for the structurally distinct Family B GPCRs. Furthermore, existing reports suggest that this family of GPCRs, which includes the highly homologous glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptors (13Mayo K.E. Miller L.J. Bataille D. Dalle S. Goke B. Thorens B. Drucker D.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 167-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), may have evolved distinct mechanisms to regulate receptor signaling at the cellular level (14Walker J.K. Premont R.T. Barak L.S.

In this study, we attempted to delineate the mechanisms regulating GLP-2R desensitization and identify structural motifs within C-terminal GLP-2R domains that link the receptor to downstream signaling pathways and direct interaction of the receptor with intracellular sorting machinery. It is generally accepted that intracellular GPCR domains, most prominently the C terminus and 3rd intracellular loop, regulate receptor desensitization, endocytosis, and intracellular fate by facilitating association of the receptor with various cellular proteins. Receptor activation promotes phosphorylation of these intracellular domains, by either second messenger kinases or G-protein receptor kinases. G-protein receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation facilitates β-arrestin binding, promoting uncoupling of the receptor from G-proteins and endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits (for more detailed review, see Ref. 12Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the GLP-2R undergoes rapid and persistent ligand-induced (homologous) desensitization accompanied by clathrin- and dynamin-independent, lipid-raft-dependent receptor endocytosis (17Estall J.L. Yusta B. Drucker D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3673-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Internalized GLP-2Rs are then rapidly trafficked out of lipid-raft-derived endosomes, where they converge on the early endosomal and perinuclear recycling compartments. Identification of this alternative trafficking pathway led us to hypothesize that unique structural domains within the GLP-2R may be responsible for directing the receptor through this intracellular fate. Moreover, these structural domains may be conserved for other members of the GPCR superfamily. To address our hypothesis, we used mutagenesis to identify regions within the GLP-2R C terminus that regulate receptor coupling to downstream signaling pathways or ligand-induced receptor trafficking. Our study demonstrates that the GLP-2R C terminus, which modulates the stable association with β-arrestin-2, is dispensable for G-protein-coupled signaling, homologous desensitization, and receptor endocytosis. However, the GLP-2R C terminus is required for retention of un-liganded receptor on the plasma membrane and may direct intracellular trafficking of internalized receptors. Taken together, our data suggest that this intracellular domain and its interacting proteins likely govern alternative, currently unidentified, functions in the regulation of GLP-2R activity.

The pcDNA3.1-human GLP-2R (GLP-2R) plasmid was a gift from NPS Pharmaceuticals (Salt Lake City, UT). The wild-type (WT) FLAG epitope-tagged human GLP-2R (FLAG-GLP-2R) cDNA was generated as previously described (17Estall J.L. Yusta B. Drucker D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3673-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The expression vectors encoding GFP-tagged rat β-arrestin-2 (β-arrestin-2-GFP) and untagged wild-type rat β-arrestin-2 were kind gifts from Dr. M. G. Caron (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC) and Dr. S. Ferguson (Robarts Research Institute, London, Ontario, Canada), respectively. Generation of Mutant GLP-2R Constructs—The truncated mutant human GLP2R receptor cDNAs were generated by PCR with primers that introduced a stop codon and an XhoI site following the codons encoding amino acids 553 (WT), 503 (Δ504), 469 (Δ470), 449 (Δ450), or 443 (Δ444), utilizing pcDNA3.1-hGLP2R as a template. To generate the Δ4445A mutant, five alanine residues were introduced 3′ to amino acid 443, followed by a stop codon. Single and multiple point mutant GLP-2Rs were also generated by PCR. The PCR products were cloned into the FLAG-tagged-hGLP2R (pcDNA3.1) plasmid previously described (17Estall J.L. Yusta B. Drucker D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3673-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (see Supplementary Material for details and primer sequences). The authenticity of the WT and mutant FLAG-GLP-2R cDNAs was verified by automated sequencing (Core Molecular Biology Facility, York University, Ontario, Canada). Cell Culture—Baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK-21), human colon cancer epithelial cells (DLD-1), and human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 100 units of penicillin/100 μg of streptomycin and either 10% (BHK and HeLa) or 5% (DLD-1) FBS. DLD-1 cells stably expressing either the WT or mutant GLP-2Rs were generated following transfection of linearized WT or mutant GLP-2R constructs using FuGENE™ (Roche Diagnostics) and selection with 1.2 mg/ml G418. Pools of DLD-1 clones, stably expressing the aforementioned plasmids, were used for further experimental analysis and maintained in media supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml G418. Transient transfections of BHK, DLD-1, or HeLa cells were carried out using FuGENE™ according to the manufacturer's protocol. Measurement of Cell Surface and Total Cellular GLP-2 Receptor Levels—To assess levels of cell surface receptor, cells transiently transfected with either WT or mutant FLAG-GLP-2R cDNA constructs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min at 4 °C. Fixed cells were incubated at room temperature with FLAG (M1) antibody (1:2000) diluted in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1 mm CaCl2 for 1 h, washed, and then incubated with anti-mouse-HRP (1:1000) in DMEM (10% FBS/1 mm CaCl2) for 1 h. Cell-associated horseradish peroxidase activity was quantified by incubation at room temperature with 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (1 mg/ml) in 0.1 m sodium citrate, 0.1 m Na2HPO4, pH 4.0, and 1 μl of 30% H2O2/ml. The reaction was stopped with 0.5% SDS/0.1% sodium azide, and the absorbance of the HRP reaction product was measured at 405 nm. HRP background absorbance from cells transfected with either untagged receptor cDNA or pcDNA3.1 was subtracted to determine final absorbance values. To assess receptor internalization, transfected cells were incubated with agonist for the indicated periods of time prior to fixation. For assessment of cell surface receptor recovery following internalization, cells were incubated with agonist for 20 min at 37 °C, washed briefly with warm PBS, and then re-incubated in DMEM supplemented with serum for 30–120 min at 37 °C prior to fixation. To measure levels of total cellular FLAG-GLP-2R, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature following fixation and prior to incubation with the anti-FLAG (M1) antibody. Measurement of Total cAMP Accumulation—24 h following transfection, cells were stimulated with 0–100 nm GLP-2 diluted in media containing 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 10 min at 37 °C. Ice-cold ethanol was added to each well (final concentration of 77%) to stop the reaction. Following an overnight incubation at –20 °C, the cAMP content of the ethanol extracts was measured by radioimmuno-assay (Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—BHK cells, grown in chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, Int., Naperville, IL) and transiently transfected with WT or mutant FLAG-GLP-2Rs, were incubated at 4 °C with anti-FLAG (M1) antibody (1:350) for 1 h in DMEM buffered with 25 mm HEPES (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 mm CaCl2. After washing with PBS plus 1 mm CaCl2, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in the absence (control) or presence of 10 nm GLP-2 diluted in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1 mm CaCl2, to induce receptor endocytosis, and immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde plus 1 mm CaCl2 at 4 °C for 30 min. Following permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100/1 mm CaCl2 and blocking with 10% horse serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.02% azide in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6/136 mm NaCl) for 1 h at room temperature, the cells were incubated at room temperature with donkey anti-mouse-Cy3 (1:1000) antibody diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin/1 mm CaCl2 in TBS. The slides were mounted using anti-fade mounting media (DAKO Diagnostics Canada Inc., Ontario, Canada), and visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with a 63× oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). For co-localization of FLAG-GLP-2R and β-arrestin-2-GFP, cells were transiently co-transfected with β-arrestin-2-GFP and either WT or mutant FLAG-GLP-2Rs prior to treatment and staining. Due to the lower cell surface receptor levels of the truncated GLP-2R mutants, detector gain was increased to visualize and document immunofluorescence associated with the labeled mutant receptors. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis of FLAG-GLP-2R— BHK cells transfected with untagged wild-type β-arrestin-2 and either WT or mutant FLAG-GLP-2R constructs were washed twice with PBS and treated for 0–60 min with 10 nm GLP-2 in serum-free DMEM buffered with 25 mm HEPES. Cellular proteins were then cross-linked for 30 min at room temperature while rocking following the addition of freshly prepared dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) dissolved in Me2SO (1.25 mm final concentration). Plates were placed on ice and washed twice for 5 min with cold media supplemented with 10% FBS. Following two washes with ice-cold PBS, cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, protease inhibitor mixture, phosphatase inhibitor mixture, 5 mm NaF, and 500 μm sodium orthovanadate (radioimmune precipitation assay buffer). The protein concentration of cleared lysates was determined using the BCA Protein assay kit (Pierce). 500 μg of each lysate was pre-cleared for 1 h with anti-mouse agarose beads linked to 1 μg of nonspecific mouse IgG and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-mouse agarose beads linked to 2 μg of anti-FLAG (M2) antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and treated with 10× reducing sample buffer for 1 h at 37 °C prior to resolving by SDS-PAGE and transfer to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). In parallel, 40 μg of each whole cell lysate was resolved to assess β-arrestin-2 expression levels. Blots were blocked in 5% milk in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and incubated at room temperature with anti-β-arrestin (1:1000). Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-FLAG (M1) (1:1000) to monitor the levels of precipitated WT and mutant receptors. Desensitization Protocol and Determination of Intracellular cAMP Content—To induce desensitization, stably transfected cells were incubated with DMEM containing 10 nm GLP-2, 20 μm forskolin, or vehicle (PBS), as indicated, for 20 min. Following a brief wash with warm PBS, the cells were allowed to recover in DMEM containing 5% FBS for the indicated periods of time. The cells were then re-stimulated with media containing 100 nm GLP-2 and 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by a quick wash with PBS at 4 °C followed by the addition of cAMP extraction buffer (77% EtOH in DMEM containing 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine). The cAMP concentration in the ethanol extracts was assessed by radioimmunoassay as described above. To assess the effect of PKA inhibition on GLP-2R desensitization, cells were incubated in media containing 10 μm H-89 for 30 min prior to and throughout pretreatment and recovery periods. Assessment of ERK1/2 Activation—HeLa cells transiently transfected with WT or mutant GLP-2R receptors were serum-starved overnight prior to stimulation with vehicle or 20 nm GLP-2 for 0–60 min, as indicated. Cells were lysed on ice in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, containing 1% Triton X-100, protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails, and 500 μm sodium orthovanadate. 20 μg of each cleared lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Following blocking for 1 h at room temperature in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS containing 0.02% Tween 20, blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-phospho-p42/p44 ERK1/2 antibody (1:1000) diluted in blocking buffer. A primary antibody against Hsp90 (1:2000) was used as a loading control. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and ECL. To assess the roles of Gαi/o subunit activation and PKC in GLP-2R-dependent ERK1/2 activation, cells were preincubated with either 200 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 24 h or 1 μm Ro-31-8425 (Ro) for 1 h prior to and during stimulation with GLP-2. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was assessed by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni multiple comparison post-hoc test using GraphPad Prism 3.03 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). The GLP-2R C Terminus Modulates Cell Surface Receptor Expression, But Not Adenylyl Cyclase Activation—Multiple protein domains and structural motifs within the C-terminal domains of GPCRs have been implicated in the control of receptor expression and signaling. To identify domains within the GLP-2R that regulate receptor signaling, trafficking, and desensitization, we constructed a series of mutant FLAG-tagged GLP-2Rs with progressively shorter C-terminal tails (Fig. 1). To assess the effects of C-terminal truncation on cell surface receptor expression and activation of second messenger signaling pathways, we transiently expressed either the FLAG-tagged wild-type (WT) or mutant GLP-2 receptors in baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHKs). Basal cell surface receptor expression was significantly decreased for all mutant receptors as assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 2A). The mutant receptor lacking the entire predicted C terminus (Δ444) was not detected on the cell surface; however, six C-terminal amino acids (Δ450) or replacement of the C-terminal tail with five alanine residues (Δ4445A) was sufficient to restore detectable cell surface receptor expression (Fig. 2A, inset). The decrease in cell surface expression was not simply attributable to deficient cellular expression of the mutant receptor protein, because similar total cellular levels of WT and mutant GLP-2 receptor proteins were detected following cell permeabilization (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Progressive truncation of the hGLP2R C terminus results in decreased cell surface receptor expression, but enhanced GLP-2-induced cAMP production.A, BHK cells transiently transfected with the same amount of FLAG-tagged wild-type (WT) or truncated mutant GLP-2Rs cDNAs were assayed for cell surface receptor expression (A) or total cellular receptor levels (B) using an HRP-linked immunosorbent assay, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The inset in A illustrates the low, but detectable, cell surface expression of the Δ450 and Δ4445A receptor mutants. Data are mean ± S.D. (n = 3) and are representative of four independent experiments. Statistical comparisons demonstrating detectable cell surface expression (*, p < 0.05; ***, p < 0.001) are relative to the Δ444 mutant whose cell surface receptor expression was indistinguishable from the background HRP signal. Cell surface receptor levels for each truncated mutant GLP-2R were also compared with that of the WT GLP-2R (###, p < 0.001). C, BHK cells transiently transfected with either WT or mutant GLP-2Rs were treated with 0–100 nm GLP-2 for 10 min and assayed for total cAMP accumulation following treatment. Data (mean ± S.D., n = 3) were fit to sigmoidal dose-response curves using GraphPad Prism 3.03 and are representative of three independent experiments. D, BHK cells were transiently transfected with eight times less of WT than truncated mutant GLP-2R cDNAs to achieve similar levels of cell surface receptor expression as was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The ratio of maximal cAMP production (100 nm GLP-2, 10 min) to cell surface receptor expression was calculated for each receptor construct and expressed relative to the WT GLP-2R ratio. Data are mean ± S.D. (n = 3) and are representative of four independent experiments. Statistical comparisons are relative to the WT receptor ratio (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the functional importance of the GLP-2R C-terminal sequences for signal transduction, we assessed GLP-2-stimulated cAMP accumulation for both wild type and mutant receptors. Surprisingly, cAMP accumulation following agonist stimulation of BHK cells transfected with the Δ533, Δ504, or Δ470 mutants was only modestly decreased compared with the WT receptor (Fig. 2C). The severely truncated Δ450 mutant exhibited a small, yet detectable GLP-2-induced cAMP response, whereas the Δ4445A and the Δ444 mutants did not activate adenylyl cyclase. Taken together with data in Fig. 2A, detectable cell surface expression is not dependent on the identity of amino acids in the proximal GLP-2R C terminus, but a small number of receptor-specific amino acids within this region are necessary for Gαs coupling. To directly compare the magnitude of receptor signaling, cells were transfected to express approximately equal levels of cell surface wild-type or mutant GLP-2Rs. When the maximal cAMP response for each mutant GLP-2R was expressed relative to the cell surface receptor density (Fig. 2D), progressive deletion of the GLP-2R C-terminal tail appears to paradoxically enhance receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase. These observations suggest that, although the majority of the GLP-2R C terminus is dispensable for activation of Gαs, sequences within the distal region may act in part to constrain maximal levels of receptor signaling. Truncation of the GLP-2R C Terminus Promotes Agonist-independent Receptor Endocytosis—The C-terminal tail of GPCRs may serve to ensure proper localization and/or stabilization of peptide hormone-activated GPCRs on the plasma membrane (18Iida-Klein A.

To determine whether the decreased cell surface expression of mutant GLP-2Rs lacking portions of the C-terminal tail was due to differences in cellular localization and/or trafficking, BHK cells transiently transfected with either FLAG-tagged WT or mutant receptors were prelabeled with anti-FLAG antibody (M1), as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and next incubated in media alone (vehicle) or with 10 nm GLP-2 for 60 min at 37 °C. Receptor-antibody complexes were visualized by confocal microscopy. Because intact cells were labeled with FLAG-antibody prior to stimulation, detected immunofluorescence represented receptor that was initially on the cell surface. Basal cell surface expression for the Δ450 and Δ4445A GLP-2R mutant receptors was difficult to monitor, hence subsequent experiments were performed using only the Δ533-, Δ504-, a"

The structure, biosynthesis, and function of GPI anchors and related molecules have been extensively reviewed (1Ferguson M.A.J. J.

The basic conserved GPI core of NH2CH2CH2PO4H-6Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1– 4GlcNα1– 6-d-myo-inositol-1-HPO4-lipid is often further decorated with additional ethanol-amine phosphate and carbohydrate groups in a species- and tissue-specific manner. Biosynthesis of GPI, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, is initiated by the transfer of Glc-NAc from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol (PI) to generate N-acetyl-d-glucosaminylphosphatidylinositol (GlcNAc-PI). In the second step of the pathway, GlcNAc-PI is de-N-acetylated by N-acetyl-d-glucosaminylphosphatidylinositol deacetylase (EC 3.1.1.69, GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase) to give d-glucosaminylphosphatidylinositol (GlcN-PI) (7Doering T.L. Masterson W.J. Englund P.T. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11168-11173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). De-N-acetylation is a prerequisite for subsequent mannosylation of GlcN-PI that leads to mature GPI anchor precursors (8Sharma D.K. Smith T.K. Crossman A. Brimacombe J.S. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). GPI-anchored proteins are particularly abundant in protozoan parasites such as Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness in humans and the related disease Nagana in cattle (1Ferguson M.A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sleeping sickness is invariably fatal if untreated and affect upwards of 300,000 people each year. Current drugs are highly toxic and difficult to administer, leaving an urgent need for new therapeutic agents. Blood stream form T. brucei cells express ∼5 × 106 GPI-anchored variant surface glycoprotein homodimers that form a dense surface coat, protecting the parasite from the complement pathway of the host and undergoing antigenic variation to evade specific immune responses (9Cross G.A.M.

Mammalian and trypanosomal GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylases have a single pass N-terminal transmembrane domain with the majority of the protein found on the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (14Nakamura N.

T. brucei GPI12 has been partially purified from T. brucei membranes after detergent solubilization (15Milne K.G. Field R.A. Masterson W.J. Cottaz S. Brimacombe J.S. Ferguson M.J. J. Biol.

Ohishi K. Maeda Y. Nakamura N. Kinoshita T. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 185-192PubMed Google Scholar). The specificities of GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase enzymes from T. brucei and HeLa cells have been examined in vitro using substrate analogues (8Sharma D.K. Smith T.K. Crossman A. Brimacombe J.S.

No structural data are available, and the active site and mechanism of action have yet to be determined. The crystal structures of two proteins with limited homology to the GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylases have recently been reported (21Handa N. Terada T. Kamewari Y. Hamana H. Tame J.R.H. Park S-Y.

The crystal structure of MshB, a zinc-dependent d-N-acetylglucosamine α1-O-1-d-myo-inositol de-N-acetylase involved in mycothiol synthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, revealed an unusual HPDD zinc binding motif in the proposed active site (22Maynes J.T.

This motif is conserved in the GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylases, despite the low level of overall sequence identity with MshB. The protein TT1542 from Thermus thermophilus of unknown function has 23% sequence identity to MshB and also contains the HPDD motif. The crystal structure of TT1542 revealed a tertiary structure similar to MshB, but no metal ion was observed in the putative active site (21Handa N. Terada T. Kamewari Y. Hamana H. Tame J.R.H.

Here, we report that mammalian and trypanosomal Glc-NAc-PI de-N-acetylases are zinc metalloenzymes and identify the active site residues by site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling. A putative mechanism of action is proposed. Materials—[9,10-3H]Myristic acid (40.2 Ci/mmol), UDP-[6-3H]Glc-NAc (UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, 20 Ci/mmol), and En3Hance™ were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. High performance liquid chromatography-grade solvents were purchased from BDH, and all of the other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Semi-synthetic and Synthetic Substrates—The synthesis of d-GlcNα1– 6-d-myo-inositol-1-HPO4-octadecyl (GlcN-I-P-C18) has been described by Crossman et al. (24Crossman A. Patterson M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Smith T.K. Brimacombe J.S. Carbohydr. Res. 2002; 337: 2049-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The formation of semi-synthetic [3H]myristate-labeled GlcNAc-PI was conducted as described by Milne et al. (15Milne K.G. Field R.A. Masterson W.J. Cottaz S. Brimacombe J.S. Ferguson M.J. J. Biol.

Ferguson M.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6476-6482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The identity and purity of the synthetic substrates were assessed by negative ion electrospray-mass spectrometry (ES-MS), and the concentration of stock solutions was determined by measurement of the inositol content by selected ion-monitoring gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (26Ferguson M.A.J. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 349-383Google Scholar). High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography—Glycolipid standards and samples were applied to 10-cm aluminum-backed Silica Gel 60 and developed with chloroform/methanol/13 m ammonia/1 m ammonium acetate/water (180/140/9/9/23, v/v). Dried HPTLC plates were sprayed with En3Hance, and radiolabeled components were visualized by fluorography at –70 °C using Kodak X-Omat AR-5 film with an intensifying screen. Typanosome Cell-free System Assays—Bloodstream form T. brucei (variant MITat1.4) were isolated, and membranes (cell-free system) were prepared as described previously and stored at –80 °C (27Masterson W.J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.W. Cell. 1989; 62: 73-80Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Trypanosome membranes (2 × 107 cell equivalents/assay) were washed twice in 10 ml of modified incorporation buffer (0.1 m NaHEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Me2SO, with or without inhibitor, was added to 1% v/v, and the membranes were sonicated briefly and incubated on ice for 10 min. The treated membranes were washed, resuspended in 2× incorporation buffer (with or without inhibitor) with 10 mm dithiothreitol, and added to dry UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (1 μCi) and sonicated briefly and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Glycolipid products were recovered by extraction into a chloroform/methanol/water mixture (10:10:3), evaporated to dryness, partitioned between butan-1-ol and water (28Guther M.L.S. Masterson W.J. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18694-18701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and analyzed by HPTLC. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Rat PIG-L-FLAG was PCR-amplified from the plasmid pMEEB-PIG-L-FLAG (14Nakamura N. Inoue N. Wantanabe R. Takahashi M. Takeda J. Stevens V.L. Kinoshita T. J. Biol.

The PCR fragment was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) with HindIII and NotI to give the plasmid pcDNA-rPIG-L-WT. The plasmid pLew100-TbGPI12-myc, which contains a TbGPI12 insert with a silenced internal HindIII site, has been described previously (11Chang T. Milne K.G. Guther M.L.S. Smith T.K. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50176-50182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Point mutations of rPIG-L-FLAG and TbGPI12 were made using mutagenic synthetic oligonucleotide primers 2Details of the mutagenic primers are contained in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2. in the QuikChange procedure (Stratagene) with mutations screened by sequencing of the insert. Successful mutations of rPIG-L-FLAG were PCR-amplified using a 5′ primer (5′-ATAGTATAAGCTTCCGGCTATGGAAGTGGTGGGT-3′) incorporating a HindIII site (italics) and a 3′ primer (5′-AATTAATGGATCCCGTTCCTTGTCATCGTCGTC-3′) incorporating a BamHI site (italics). The PCR fragment was subcloned into pEGFP-N1 with HindIII and BamHI to give the plasmid pEGFP-rPIG-L. Successful mutations of TbGPI12 were PCR-amplified using a 5′ primer (5′-AATTTAAAGCTTGCTATGCATGTTGCTTTG-3′) incorporating a HindIII site (italics) and a 3′ primer (5′-AATTAATGGATCCCGTCCCTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCTCGCGACAGGTCC-3′) incorporating a BamHI site (italics) and a C-terminal FLAG tag (underlined). The PCR fragment was subcloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) with HindIII and BamHI to give the plasmid pEGFP-TbGPI12. Functional Complementation—The reporter cell line CHO-K1 M2S2, defective in PIG-L and stably transfected to express human-CD55 and -CD59, has been described by Nakamura et al. (14Nakamura N. Inoue N. Wantanabe R. Takahashi M. Takeda J. Stevens V.L. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15834-15840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 M2S2 cells and their transfectants were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin and streptomycin, and 0.2 mg/ml G418 at 37 °C with 5% CO2, 100% humidity. For transient transfections, cells were grown to 60–70% confluence in 6-well plates, and the contents of one well were used per transfection. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and trypsin-EDTA-treated for 15 min, washed with Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 20 mm NaHEPES, and resuspended in 0.8 ml of the same solution (∼2 × 106 cells/ml). The cells were transferred to 4-mm cuvettes containing 20 μg of the appropriate plasmid in distilled water and electroporated at 260 V, 950 microfarads (Bio-Rad gene-pulser). Immediately after transfection, 0.8 ml of fetal calf serum was added and the contents of the cuvette were transferred into 2 ml of culture medium in a 6-well plate and cultured for 72 h. Cells were detached with 0.5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline, washed three times in 0.25% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with mouse anti-CD55 (100 μg/ml) for 0.5 h, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.25% w/v bovine serum albumin, and then incubated with an anti-mouse-phycoerythrin (PE) conjugate (STAR12A, Serotec) for 30 min. Cells were washed additionally three times in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.25% w/v bovine serum albumin before flow cytometry analysis in FACS-Calibur instrument (BD Biosciences). Expression of rPIG-L—The QuikChange procedure (Stratagene) was used to create a silent mutation that removed the internal XhoI site in rPIG-L using the primers 5′-CCACCTCTACACCGTCTTTTCGAGATACATGAGCGT-3′ and 5′-ACGCTCATGTATCTCGAAAAGACGGTGTAGAGGTGG-3′ (mutation in boldface) to give the plasmid pMEEB-rPIG-L-FLAG-sXho. The DNA encoding residues 24–252 of rPIG-L was amplified by PCR from pMEEB-rPIG-L-FLAG-sXho using a 5′ primer (5′-AAACCCATGGATAAGGTTTTAGATTCAGCGGAACGAAT-3′) that incorporated an NcoI site (italics) and a six-residue N-terminal sequence (MDKVLD, underlined) and a 3′ primer (5′-TTTTCTCGAGTGCGTAATCAGGGACGTCATAAGGGTAGCCGAGCAACTGCAGC-3′) that incorporated a C-terminal HA tag (GYPYDVPDYA, underlined) and a XhoI site (italics). The PCR fragment was subcloned into pET-Blue-2 (Novagen) with NcoI and XhoI to give the plasmid pETB-eN-rPIGL-HA, which incorporated a hexahistidine tag to the C terminus of the open reading frame. E. coli Tuner™ (Novagen) transformed with pETB-eN-rPIGL-HA were grown in Luria-Bertani medium with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at 37 °C until A600 = 0.5, induced with 200 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and cultured for an additional 16 h at 21 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.06% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 10% glycerol (v/v)) per liter, and incubated with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) on ice for 20 min. Cells were lysed at 30,000 p.s.i. (OneShot, Constant Cell Disruption Systems), the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and then insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.4 μm membrane, applied to a 1-ml column precharged with Ni2+ (Hi-Trap Chelating HP, Amersham Biosciences), washed with buffer A, eluted with a gradient of 0–250 mm imidazole in buffer A (BioCad Sprint), and collected in 1-ml fractions. Fractions containing eN-rPIG-L-HA were identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-HA mouse primary and an anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary-antibody detected by chemiluminescence. Pooled fractions were concentrated and washed in buffer A in a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off spin-concentration device (Vivascience) repeatedly to remove imidazole. The concentration of eN-rPIG-L-HA was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using a calculated ϵ = 3.803 × 104 cm–1 M–1. Radioactive De-N-acetylase Assay—[9,10-3H]Myristate-labeled Glc-NAc-PI (0.2 nCi, 50 fmol) was dried under a nitrogen stream, and 2× incorporation buffer (20 μl), distilled H2O (10 μl), and buffer A (10 μl) with or without 100 ng of recombinant protein were added. The solution was briefly vortexed, sonicated for 5 s, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Glycolipids were partitioned into butan-1-ol and the solvents were removed in vacuo, and the products were analyzed by HPTLC and fluorography. ES-MS-MS De-N-acetylase Assay—All of the buffers and solutions were treated with Chelex100 (sodium form) to remove divalent cations prior to use. The recombinant protein eN-rPIG-L-HA (500 ng/μl) was incubated with 1.0 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (1,10-PO) in buffer A for 0.5 h at 37 °C. Treated eN-rPIG-L-HA (1 μl) was added to GlcN-I-P-C18 (1 nmol) in incorporation buffer (39 μl) with or without 10 μm divalent metal cations. The solution was briefly vortexed, sonicated for 5 s, and incubated at 37 °C for 0.5 h. The mixture was diluted with 5% propan-1-ol (1 ml), the glycolipids were bound to C8 resin (100-mg Isolute cartridge), washed (5% propan-1-ol, 5 mm NH4OAc), and eluted (60% propanol, 5 mm NH4OAc), and the products were analyzed directly by ES-MS-MS on a Micromass Quattro Ultima triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in parent ion-scanning mode (parents of m/z 233). The m/z 233 fragment ion, [inositol-1,2-cyclic phosphate-H2O], is common to both the GlcNAc-I-P-C18 substrate and the GlcN-I-P-C18 product. The ratio of the integrals for the m/z 714 [GlcNAc-I-P-C18-H] and m/z 672 [GlcN-I-P-C18-H] parent ions was used to calculate the percentage of substrate conversion to product in a given sample. Molecular Modeling—A structural model of rPIG-L was constructed using homology modeling with WHAT IF (29Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). The structure of M. tuberculosis MshB (Protein Data Bank entry 1Q7T (23McCarthy A.A. Paterson N.A. Knijff R. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1131-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)) was used as the template structure. No attempt was made to model the large insertions in the rPIG-L sequence (Fig. 8). Rotamers of conserved residues were left unchanged. All of the other residues were initially mutated to alanines. Rotamers were then modeled using the WHAT IF backbone-dependent rotamer libraries. At each position, rotamer quality was checked by hydrogen bonding, van der Waals bumps, and packing quality. The coordinates for the zinc ion and a water molecule coordinated by the zinc ion were obtained by superposition with the apoMshB structure (Protein Data Bank entry 1Q74 (22Maynes J.T. Garen C.

Pictures were made with PyMol (30DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar) and GRASP (31Nicholls A. Sharp K. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281Crossref PubMed Scopus (5316) Google Scholar). Typanosome Cell-free System Assays—The trypanosome cell-free system converts UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc to [6-3H]GlcNAc-PI, which is de-N-acetylated by TbGPI12 to give [6-3H]GlcN-PI, which may then be partially converted to Manα1– 4GlcN-PI and later GPI intermediates at the expense of traces of endogenous Dol-P-Man in the cell-free system membrane (Fig. 1A, blank) (32Guther M.L.S. Ferguson M.A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3080-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the metal dependence of TbGPI12, we examined the ability of the trypanosome cell-free system to de-N-acetylate GlcNAc-PI in the presence of divalent metal cation-chelating agents. 1,10-PO chelates Zn2+, Ni2+ » Mn2+, Mg2+, whereas the isomeric 1,7-phenanthroline (1,7-PO) is unable to chelate metal ions, and 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid has affinity for a broad range of divalent metal cations (33Auld D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 228-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Prewashing the cell-free system to remove any loosely associated divalent metal ion did not affect the de-N-acetlyase activity. However, preincubation of the cell-free system with 1,10-PO or pyridinedicarboxylic acid inhibits de-N-acetylation, whereas the non-chelating 1,7-PO has no effect (Fig. 1A). Inhibition by 1,10-PO occurs in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1B), suggesting the presence of a strongly bound metal ion that is essential for TbGPI12 activity. Expression of Soluble rPIG-L—Truncation of the N-terminal transmembrane domain of rPIG-L at residues 7, 14, and 21–27 failed to produce soluble recombinant rPIG-L in E. coli. A BLAST search with rPIG-L revealed a hypothetical E. coli protein YAIS with reasonable homology to rPIG-L 3The alignment of rat PIG-L and E. coli YAIS is contained in Supplemental Fig. S2. but lacking the transmembrane domain. A pET vector pETB-eN-rPIG-L-HA was constructed, coding for a 28-kDa fusion protein eN-rPIG-L-HA comprising residues 1–6 of E. coli YAIS followed by residues 26–252 of rPIG-L and C-terminal HA and hexahistidine tags. The expression in E. coli and purification by metal ion affinity chromatography produced soluble eN-rPIG-L-HA (Fig. 2A). The identity of the protein was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-HA (Fig. 2B) and by tryptic peptide mass fingerprinting. 4Details of the tryptic peptide mass fingerprinting of eN-rPIG-L-HA is contained in Supplemental Table S3. Metal Ion Dependence of Soluble rPIG-L—Initial assessment of the activity of eN-rPIG-L-HA by measuring the de-N-acetylation of [H3]myristate-labeled GlcNAc-PI confirmed that the fusion protein retained activity for its natural substrate (Fig. 2C, lane 3). To provide quantitative data and enable higher substrate concentrations to be used, a ES-MS-MS technique was devised to monitor the de-N-acetylation of the synthetic substrate GlcNAc-I-P-C18 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Although GlcNAc-I-P-C18 has been reported to be a poorer substrate than GlcNAc-PI in the HeLa cell-free system where the enzyme is membrane-bound (34Smith T.K. Crossman A. Paterson M.J. Borissow C.N. Brimacombe J.S. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37147-37153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), a specific activity of 2.3 μmol/mg/h was recorded. This figure compares favorably with the previously reported specific activity of 390 pmol/mg/h for the de-N-acetylation of GlcNAc-PI by partially purified TbGPI12 from T. brucei (15Milne K.G. Field R.A. Masterson W.J. Cottaz S. Brimacombe J.S. Ferguson M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16403-16408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of eN-rPIG-L-HA was inhibited by the presence of micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ (IC50 35 μm), a feature previously observed for several Zn2+ metalloenzymes (35Larson K.S. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9620-9625Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 36Jackman J.E. Raetz C.R.H. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 38: 1902-1911Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Incubation of eN-rPIG-L-HA with 1,10-PO produced a loss of de-N-acetylase activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, such that treatment with 2.5 mm 1,10-PO for 1 h at 37 °C was sufficient to completely remove all activity. Attempts were made to restore activity to the metal-free inactive protein (apo-eN-rPIG-L-HA) by reconstitution with a variety of metal ions without success. However, under less harsh conditions where partially active apo-eN-rPIG-L-HA was obtained, the activity could be increased by the addition of divalent metal cations. Furthermore, the lower the activity of the apo-eN-rPIG-L-HA sample, the less the activity could be restored. As an example, treatment of eN-rPIG-L-HA with 1.0 mm 1,10-PO for 30 min at 37 °C produced a 83% loss in activity that could be partially restored (to a maximum of 28%) by the subsequent addition of metal ions (10 μm) with restoration occurring in the order Zn2+,Cu2+ > Ni2+ > Co2+ > Mg2+ (Fig. 3). The addition of 10 μm of the same metal ions to untreated eN-rPIG-L-HA had a negligible effect on its de-N-acetylase activity (with the exception of zinc, which showed 40% inhibition). These results indicate that apo-eN-rPIG-L-HA is unstable, probably under-going irreversible misfolding. The amount of de-N-acetylase activity that can be reconstituted appears to be a balance between the rate of metal ion stripping and the instability of apo-eN-rPIG-L-HA. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Sequence alignment of the Glc-NAc-PI de-N-acetylase enzymes from T. brucei and Rattus norvegicus with MshB from M. tuberculosis revealed a number of conserved residues, despite their low level of sequence identity (Fig. 4). Many, but not all, of these residues are also completely conserved in putative GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase homologues that are identified in a number of sequenced eukaryotic genomes (see Fig. 4, consensus line). The sequence alignment was used to construct a homology model of the rPIG-L active site (Fig. 8). The sequence alignment and model show that a large proportion of the conserved residues are found in the proposed active site, including the putative zinc-binding residues and catalytic base (22Maynes J.T.

https://openalex.org/W2076677161,"Human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein levels rapidly increase upon exposure to methotrexate, a potent inhibitor of this enzyme. A model to explain this increase proposes that DHFR inhibits its own translation by binding to its cognate mRNA and that methotrexate disrupts the DHFR protein-mRNA complex allowing its translation to resume. In the present study, Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking DHFR were transfected with wild type and mutants of human DHFR to identify amino acids that are essential for increases in DHFR in response to methotrexate. Glu-30, Leu-22, and Ser-118 were involved in the up-regulation of DHFR protein levels by methotrexate and certain other antifolates. Cells transfected with E30A, L22R, and S118A mutants that did not respond to methotrexate up-regulation had higher basal levels of DHFR, consistent with the model, i.e. lack of feedback regulation of these enzymes. Although cells containing the S118A mutant enzyme had higher levels of DHFR and had catalytic activity similar to that of wild type DHFR, they had the same sensitivity to the cytotoxicity of methotrexate, as were cells with wild type DHFR. This finding provides evidence that the adaptive up-regulation of DHFR by methotrexate contributes to the decreased sensitivity to this drug. Based on these observations, a new model is proposed whereby DHFR exists in two conformations, one bound to DHFR mRNA and the other bound to NADPH. The mutants that are not up-regulated by methotrexate are unable to bind their cognate mRNA.

(5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.5.1.3), utilizing NADPH as a cofactor, catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. Tetrahydrofolate and its derivatives are essential cofactors in the synthesis of thymidylate, purines, and some amino acids (1Blakley R.L. Blakley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. 1. John Wiley and Sons, New York1984: 191-253Google Scholar). Inhibition of DHFR results in a depletion of the reduced folate pools, inhibition of DNA synthesis, and cell death. Therefore, DHFR has proven to be an important target in cancer therapy. Methotrexate (MTX), a tight binding inhibitor of DHFR, is used to treat patients with leukemia and solid tumors in addition to a variety of other nonmalignant diseases (2Bertino J.R. Kamen B.A. Romanini A. Holland J.F. Bast Jr, R.C. Morton D.L. Frei III, E. Kufe D.W. Weichselbaum R.R. Cancer Medicine. 2. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore1997: 907-922Google Scholar, 3Chu E. Allegra C.J. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L. Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy: Principles and Practice. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 109-148Google Scholar). In patients with leukemia, DHFR activity increases ∼6-fold within 24 h in blast cells upon treatment with MTX (4Bertino J.R. Donohue D.R. Gabrio B.W. Silber R. Alenty A. Meyer M. Huennekens F.M. Nature. 1962; 193: 140-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Following this initial report, several in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that DHFR protein levels rapidly increase, or are “induced” in response to MTX treatment, associated with MTX bound to the protein (5Bertino J.R.

The increase in DHFR protein levels seen upon exposure to MTX was unaffected by the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D but was blocked by the translational inhibitor cycloheximide indicating that this increase was not due to increased transcription (7Hillcoat B.L. Swett V. Bertino J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 1632-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for a translational role in the up-regulation response came from studies showing that DHFR mRNA levels remain the same in the presence or absence of MTX (9Bastow K. Prabhu R. Cheng Y.C. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10Cowan K.H. Goldsmith M.E. Ricciardone M.D. Levine R. Rubalcaba E. Jolivet J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 30: 69-76PubMed Google Scholar). Although it was suggested initially that MTX protected DHFR from degradation (8Bertino J.R. Cashmore A.R. Hillcoat B.L. Cancer Res. 1970; 30: 2372-2378PubMed Google Scholar), later studies showed that the half-life of DHFR protein was unaltered in the presence of MTX (10Cowan K.H. Goldsmith M.E. Ricciardone M.D. Levine R. Rubalcaba E. Jolivet J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 30: 69-76PubMed Google Scholar, 11Domin B.A. Grill S.P. Bastow K.F. Cheng Y.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 21: 478-482PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, having ruled out transcriptional as well as mRNA stability changes and MTX protection of enzyme degradation as causing the rapid increase in DHFR upon exposure to MTX, our laboratory and others (12Ercikan E.A.

Allegra C.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4756-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) began to explore the role of a translational mechanism in the induction. In vitro translation assays demonstrate that addition of exogenous DHFR to its own mRNA inhibits its translation, and UV cross-linking assays show that DHFR can bind its own RNA. Further analysis localized the DHFR/RNA interaction to a 100-bp region within the coding region (14Ercikan-Abali E.A. Banerjee D. Waltham M.C. Skacel N. Scotto K.W. Bertino J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12317-12322Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Based on these experiments, a model has been proposed to explain elevated DHFR protein levels, namely that human DHFR protein can bind to its cognate mRNA and thereby inhibit its own translation. The addition of the inhibitor MTX produces a conformational change on its binding to DHFR, disrupting the DHFR protein-mRNA complex and enabling translation to resume (15Appleman J.R. Prendergast N.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2227-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This mechanism allows DHFR protein levels to respond rapidly to changes in substrate concentration in the cellular milieu. By utilizing this translational mechanism, we showed that it is possible to modulate cellular levels of heterologous proteins fused to DHFR both in vitro and in vivo (17Mayer-Kuckuk P. Banerjee D. Malhotra S. Doubrovin M. Iwamoto M. Akhurst T. Balatoni J. Bornmann W. Finn R. Larson S. Fong Y. Gelovani Tjuvajev J. Blasberg R. Bertino J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3400-3405Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MTX or trimetrexate treatment increased the cellular levels of the fusion proteins DHFR-EGFP and DHFR-herpes simplex V1-thymidine kinase (HSV1-TK). The up-regulation of the DHFR-HSV1-TK fusion protein by MTX increased the sensitivity to a suicide drug, e.g. ganciclovir, and enhanced imaging signals in vivo using positron emission tomography with [124I]2′-fluoro-2′-deoxy-5-iodouracil-β-d-arabinofuranoside (17Mayer-Kuckuk P. Banerjee D. Malhotra S. Doubrovin M. Iwamoto M. Akhurst T. Balatoni J. Bornmann W. Finn R. Larson S. Fong Y. Gelovani Tjuvajev J. Blasberg R. Bertino J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3400-3405Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). There have been no reports identifying the amino acids in DHFR that are associated with the rapid induction of DHFR in response to MTX, although investigations have sought to identify critical amino acid residues on human DHFR protein that mediate RNA recognition (18Tai N. Ding Y. Schmitz J.C. Chu E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4481-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19McPherson J.P. Sauerbrey A. Meehl M. Russo A. Skacel N. Bertino J.R. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1999; 40 (abstr.): 676Google Scholar). Tai et al. (18Tai N. Ding Y. Schmitz J.C. Chu E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4481-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), using site-directed mutagenesis, RNA gel mobility shift assays, and RNA nitrocellulose filter binding assays, investigated the ability of variant His-tagged DHFRs to bind to DHFR mRNA. They identified the only cysteine residue in DHFR, Cys-6, as being essential for RNA recognition. Mutations at Ile-7, Arg-28, and Phe-34 greatly reduced mRNA binding activity. Whether these residues are important for the up-regulation of DHFR by impairing MTX binding to DHFR protein to relieve the translational inhibition was not shown. To address this question, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to identify the specific amino acids in the DHFR protein that are involved in the up-regulation of DHFR and have also used antifolates that differ in their mode of binding to the active site of DHFR to determine structure activity in relation to the up-regulation of DHFR. We reasoned that antifolates with diverse structures would affect the translational up-regulation of DHFR differently, providing additional information on the active site amino acids involved. We used a mammalian cell culture system to functionally identify amino acids essential for the MTX-induced increase in cellular DHFR. Of the mutants that were generated and tested for induction upon MTX treatment, we report that three DHFR mutants, E30A, S118A, and L22R, demonstrated little to no detectable changes in DHFR protein levels in response to MTX exposure. We also analyzed the response of these mutants to the antifolates trimetrexate, raltitrexed, and pemetrexed. When transfectants containing wt DHFR-EGFP were exposed to each of the four antifolates, significant increases in cellular DHFR-EGFP fusion protein levels were observed. The response of variants E30A, S118A, and L22R to all four antifolates was significantly reduced. In contrast, although cells transfected with Cys-6 mutants were induced by MTX and trimetrexate, they were not induced by raltitrexed and pemetrexed treatment. Materials—CMRL 1066 medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), dialyzed FBS (dFBS), G418 sulfate (Geneticin), penicillin, streptomycin, and trypsin were purchased from Invitrogen. F-12 medium without hypoxanthine, glycine, and thymidine was obtained from SKI media laboratory (Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute, New York, NY). The pEGFPN3 vector was from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) and the pcDNA3 vector was from Invitrogen. The QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA) or BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). ECL reagents were supplied by Amersham Biosciences. The antibody to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was from Roche Applied Science. The anti-α-tubulin antibody was obtained from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to human DHFR was custom produced by Research Genetics/Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Raltitrexed (D1694, Tomudex®) was a gift from Astra Zeneca (Wilmington, DE), and pemetrexed (Alimta®) was a gift from Lilly. Cloning cylinders were obtained from Specialty Media (Phillipsburg, NJ). Aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and sodium orthovanadate were obtained from Sigma. Tissue Culture and Transfections—The Chinese hamster ovary cell line DG44, deleted for both alleles of DHFR, was a gift of Dr. L. Chasin (Columbia University, New York, NY) (20Urlaub G. Mitchell P.J. Kas E. Chasin L.A. Funanage V.L. Myoda T.T. Hamlin J. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Parental DG44 cells were maintained in CMRL 1066 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All transfections were performed using DOTAP transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Parental DG44 cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/10-cm dish. When the cells reached 10–15% confluency, they were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA plus 70 μl of DOTAP reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fresh medium was supplied 24 h post-transfection. Selection in 750 μg/ml G418 sulfate for plasmids containing the neomycin resistance gene began 48 h later. A control experiment using everything but plasmid DNA was concurrently performed with each transfection. Approximately 14 days later, individual clones were isolated by ring cylinders and expanded into stable resistant cell lines. At the same time, pooled batches were harvested and expanded into stable lines. Neither cells used as control (only DOTAP reagent) for transfection nor parental DG44 cells survived the G418 selection. For selection based on the requirement for catalytically functional DHFR, hereafter termed F-12 selection, the protocol was modified as follows. Three days post-transfection, the medium was changed to F-12 without hypoxanthine, glycine, thymidine (F-12 w/o HGT) supplemented with 10% dFBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. During F-12 selection, after two passages, the cells were replated at a seeding density of 1:20 in 10-cm plates. The cells remained under F-12 selection for 5 weeks, at which time individual clones formed and batches could be harvested. Neither cells used as control (only DOTAP reagent) for transfection nor parental DG44 cells survived the G418 selection. Preparation of Cell Lysates—Cells were harvested by 2-min trypsinization and collected by centrifugation (800 × g) for 5 min. Cell pellets were washed twice in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in ice-cold RIPA buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μl/ml aprotinin (Sigma), and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. After a 30-min incubation on ice, cells were sonicated three times at 10-s bursts using a VibraCell sonicator (30% output; VibraCell, Danbury, CT). Following sonication, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added and cells were incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and used immediately or stored at –70 °C. Western Blotting—Protein samples were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Transfer was performed by standard electro-blotting protocols onto nitrocellulose membranes. Equal loading was determined using Ponceau S and anti-α-tubulin antibody. Immunoblots were incubated with either anti-EGFP or anti-α-tubulin antibodies at room temperature for 1 h using phosphate-buffered saline-T buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk powder. The blots were washed at room temperature and incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse IgG according to standard protocols. When probing with the rabbit anti-human DHFR polyclonal antibody, both primary and secondary phosphate-buffered saline-T contained 5% FBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk powder. Secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG was used to detect blots probed with rabbit anti-human DHFR polyclonal antibody. Chemiluminescence was used to visualize bands by following the manufacturer's instructions (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences). The blots were stripped and reprobed according to the protocol included with the ECL kit. The data were analyzed using the Kodak Image Station 2000MM Multimodal Imaging System (IS2000MM) (Rochester, NY). Cloning—The coding sequence for wild type DHFR (564 nucleotides) was amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and the following primers: forward primer, 5′-GGCGGCAAGCTTATGGTTGGTTCGCTAAACTGC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCCGCCGGATCCATCATTCTTCTCATACTTC-3′. The product was gel-isolated, digested with HindIII and BamHI, and ligated into the pEGPN3 mammalian expression vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) at the HindIII and BamHI sites using a Rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequencing was confirmed by the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School DNA Core Facility in Piscataway, NJ. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The DHFR-EGFP fusion vector, generated as described above, served as the template in subsequent QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis reactions to create the majority of variants used in this study. Mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol included in the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene). Briefly, each 50-μl reaction contained 10 ng of double-stranded DNA template (pEGPN3-DHFR), 125 ng of sense mutagenic primer, 125 ng of antisense mutagenic primer, 1 μl of dNTP mix, and 5 μlof10× manufacturer's reaction buffer to which 1 μlof PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (2.5 units/μl) was added. Thermocycling was performed in the GeneAmp 9600 (PerkinElmer/Cetus, Norwalk, CT) thermocycler according to the following parameters: T1, 95 °C for 30 s, (1 cycle) followed by T1, 95 °C for 30 s; T2, 55 °C for 1 min; and T3, 68 °C for 12 min. (16 cycles). Following the cycling, the reaction was cooled on ice. To digest the parental (nonmutated) template strain, 1 μl of DpnI restriction enzyme (10 units/μl) was incubated with the reaction for 1 h at 37 °C. One μl of the digested reaction mix containing the mutated plasmid was transformed into XL-1 Blue Supercompetent cells according to standard protocols. Clones were isolated, and each variant was sequenced by UMDNJ-RWJMS DNA Core Facility in Piscataway, NJ, to confirm the presence of the specific mutation.

The medium was changed with fresh medium with or without MTX for 24–48 h. Fluorescent images of randomly selected areas were taken with a Nikon fluorescence microscope. Cytotoxicity Assay—Cytotoxicity to antifolates was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) assay according to the Cell-Titer 96 Aqueous One solution protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). One thousand cells were plated in 96 wells and grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS. After 2 days, the medium was changed with the same medium containing the antifolates at various concentrations, and the cells were incubated for 96 h. After 96 h of incubation, the MTS assay was performed and the absorbancy in each well determined at 490 nm using a plate reader. The wells with cells without antifolates and with medium with no cells were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. All experimental points were set up in replicate wells, and all experiments were repeated at least three times. Cell Viability Assay—Cell viability was assessed by two methods. For the crystal violet-staining assays, 200 cells of each transfectant were plated into 34-mm culture plates. The following day, the medium was removed from adhered cells and replaced with fresh medium containing dFBS and no HGT. After 2 weeks of incubation, the plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 0.4% formaldehyde, and stained with 0.2% crystal violet. The viability of the transfectants was also measured using the MTS assay described above. Briefly, after plating 1000 cells/well in 96-well plates, the cells were allowed to adhere for a day in complete medium (CMRL 1066 plus 10% FBS). The following day, the medium was changed to selection medium (F-12 with 10% dFBS and no HGT). 96 h later, the viability of the cells was determined using MTS assay. The results were compared with the controls in which the medium was not changed to the selection medium duration of the experiment. Enzyme Characterization—Enzyme kinetic studies were determined spectrophotometrically. Conversion of NADPH and dihydrofolate to NADP+ and tetrahydrofolate was determined from initial velocity measurements of DHFR as described previously (21Ercikan-Abali E.A. Mineishi S. Yong T. Nakahara S. Waltham M.C. Banerjee D. Chen W. Sadelain M. Bertino J.R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4142-4145PubMed Google Scholar). Apparent IC50 values were determined from the steady state inhibition reaction rates as described previously (21Ercikan-Abali E.A. Mineishi S. Yong T. Nakahara S. Waltham M.C. Banerjee D. Chen W. Sadelain M. Bertino J.R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4142-4145PubMed Google Scholar) using 100 μm substrate and cofactor and variable concentrations of inhibitor. The initial velocity of each DHFR mutant enzyme was set to be the same, and the concentration at which 50% of the activity was inhibited was taken as the apparent IC50. Cloning and Purification of GST-DHFR Fusion Proteins—GST-DHFR fusion proteins were cloned into the GST Gene Fusion system using pGEX4t-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences AB). The variants of GST-DHFR fusion proteins were expressed and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's manual. The GST portion of the protein was then cleaved using biotinylated thrombin. The residual thrombin and GST were removed using streptavidinagarose and the glutathione-Sepharose 4B, respectively. The purity of the proteins was determined using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—EGFP and hamster β-actin mRNA levels were examined by quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR. Following total RNA purification using TRIzol (Invitrogen), cDNA was made from 500 ng of the purified total RNA using the SuperScript First-Strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A 1:8 dilution of the resulting cDNA was used for all real-time reverse transcription-PCR experiments. Real-time PCR was conducted using the ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The PCR primers and probes were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). They are as follows: EGFP forward primer, 5′-CTACCCCGACCACATGAAGC-3′; EGFP reverse primer, 5′-TGCGCTCCTGGACGTAGC-3′; EGFP probe, 5′-56-FAM/TCTTCAAGTCCGCCATGCCCG/36-TAMph-3′; hamster β-actin forward primer, 5′-TGAACCGTATCTGCCCACCT-3′; hamster β-actin reverse primer, 5′-GCCACCAAGGCATGATCG-3′; hamster β-actin probe, 5′-56-FAM/ACACAAGGTCGGGAGCCAAACGC/36-TAMTph-3′. Briefly, each 25-μl reaction contained 200 ng of each primer and Taqman Universal PCR Master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The cycling conditions for all genes were: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of at 94 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Each sample was run using eight different wells of the 96-well plate, and each experiment was repeated three times. In Vitro Transcription and Translation Assay—DHFR-EGFP constructs were generated with PCR using a primer at the 5′-end of the T7 promoter. After phenol chloroform extraction and precipitation of the PCR products using 90% ethanol, in vitro transcription was performed using T7 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The integrity and the size of the RNA were verified using gel electrophoresis, and the concentration and the purity of RNA samples were determined by reading the absorbance at λ = 260 nm and taking the ratio of λ = 260 nm to λ = 280 nm, respectively. The nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was used to translate the in vitro transcribed RNA samples. 7.5 pmol of each transcript, 23 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 40 units of rRNAsin inhibitor, 1 mm amino acid mixture (which lacked methionine), 5 μl of [35S]methionine, and an aliquot of nuclease-free water to a final volume of 55 μl were added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The cell-free translation products were run on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed for visualization. Establishment of a Mammalian Cell Culture System to Study Changes in DHFR Protein Levels upon MTX Exposure—Previous studies have shown that, when DG44 cells are transfected with the coding sequence of wild type human DHFR alone (wt DHFR), significant increases in DHFR protein levels are detected upon exposure to 1 μm MTX for 24 h and 48 h (22Abali E. Leonardo L. Skacel N. Banerjee D. Bertino J. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 2003; 114 (abstr.): 601Google Scholar). In this study, we expressed DHFR as a fusion partner with EGFP, because the detection of DHFR protein with human DHFR antibody in this cell line had a high background. Prior work from our laboratory showed that a retroviral vector expressing an L22F/F31S double mutant DHFR-EGFP fusion protein is functionally active in both human and mouse cell lines (17Mayer-Kuckuk P. Banerjee D. Malhotra S. Doubrovin M. Iwamoto M. Akhurst T. Balatoni J. Bornmann W. Finn R. Larson S. Fong Y. Gelovani Tjuvajev J. Blasberg R. Bertino J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3400-3405Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expected that a wt human DHFR-EGFP fusion protein would have activity in a hamster cell line and be a useful tool for subsequent studies using site-directed mutagenesis and fluorescence microscopy. A construct containing wt human DHFR-EGFP and the neomycin-resistant gene was transfected into DG44 cells, and cells resistant to G418 were selected. Three individual cell lines established from clones isolated from transfectants containing wt DHFR-EGFP demonstrated increased fusion protein levels upon exposure to MTX (Fig. 1A). The levels of DHFR-EGFP fusion protein increased in response to MTX comparable with cells transfected with wt human DHFR alone (Fig. 1D). Moreover, an increase in green fluorescence could be detected in cells expressing DHFR-EGFP following MTX treatment at 24 h (Fig. 1C). There w"

Through a comprehensive differential display screening of oncogenic ras target genes, we have shown that the α1 chain of type I collagen (col1a1) is markedly down-regulated by the ras oncogene through the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Although ras-transformed cells are no longer able to produce and secrete endogenous collagen, they can still adhere to exogenous collagen, suggesting that the cells express a collagen binding factor(s) on the cell surface. When the region of col1a1 encompassing the C-terminal glycine repeat and C-prodomain (amino acids 1000–1453) was affinity-labeled with human placental alkaline phosphatase, the secreted trimeric fusion protein could bind to the surface of Ras-transformed cells. Using biochemical purification followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry analysis, we identified this collagen binding factor as Endo180 (uPARAP, CD280), a member of the mannose receptor family. Ectopic expression of Endo180 in CosE5 cells followed by in situ staining and quantitative binding assays confirmed that Endo180 indeed recognizes and binds to placental alkaline phosphatase. The interaction between Endo180 and the C-terminal region of type I collagen appears to play an important role in cell-matrix adhesion.

The interaction between Endo180 and the C-terminal region of type I collagen appears to play an important role in cell-matrix adhesion. The ras proto-oncogenes are important mediators of cell growth and differentiation and are frequently mutated in human cancer. Approximately 90% of pancreatic and 50% of colorectal cancers have been shown to carry an oncogenic mutation in one of the ras family members (1Kiaris H. Ergazaki M. Spandidos D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 788-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These proto-oncogenes are guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that cycle between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound state. When activated, Ras proteins function by transducing a number of extracellular signals into the nucleus of a cell via downstream effectors and signaling cascades, subsequently activating transcription factors, such as AP-1 and Ets (2Johnson R. Spiegelman B. Hanahan D. Wisdom R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4504-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 3Langer S.J. Bortner D.M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5355-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), that control the expression of various genes (4Malumbres M. Pellicer A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 887-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Oncogenic mutations in the Ras proteins lock them in the active GTP-bound state (5Adjei A.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1062-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), resulting in constitutive Ras activation and thus permanent stimulation of the numerous downstream effectors and signaling pathways that regulate various transcription factors. These transcription factors, in turn, control the expression of a number of genes that are responsible for such cellular changes as increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (6Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3772) Google Scholar). Oncogenic Ras also regulates the expression of genes that promote various phenotypic changes associated with morphological transformation in culture, although the mechanisms involved in this process remain obscure (7Egan S.E. McClarty G.A. Jarolim L. Wright J.A. Spiro I. Hager G. Greenberg A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Many of the genes whose expression is controlled by the ras oncogenes are yet to be elucidated, although some target genes, such as transin/stromelysin-1 (8Matrisian L.M. Glaichenhaus N. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), MMP-1 (9Schonthal A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ponta H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24436-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have been identified. However, these genes fail to account for the complex phenotype of cell transformation. Ras-transformed fibroblast cells, compared with parental fibroblast cells, appear very disorganized as a result of both altered cell-matrix interactions and lost contact inhibition, which is one of the hallmarks of cell transformation (15Levine E.M. Becker Y. Boone C.W. Eagle H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 53: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 16Bishop J.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 235-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). In addition, oncogenic ras-mediated transformation results in increased cellular proliferation and enables transformed cells to form colonies in soft agar and tumors in mice (17Hahn W.C. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 18Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2695) Google Scholar). Identifying and characterizing the biological functions of additional ras target genes should help to shed light on our understanding of how the ras oncogenes regulate cell transformation and tumorigenesis. In a search for ras target genes that mediate the complex phenotype of transformation, we completed a comprehensive differential display (DD) 1The abbreviations used are: DD, differential display; CBF, collagen-specific binding factor; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thioglucoside; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AP, alkaline phosphatase; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; MPE, membrane protein extract; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MAP, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; WCE, whole cell extract; DDR, discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: DD, differential display; CBF, collagen-specific binding factor; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thioglucoside; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AP, alkaline phosphatase; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; MPE, membrane protein extract; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MAP, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; WCE, whole cell extract; DDR, discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase. screen (19Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4694) Google Scholar) to compare the gene expression profiles between nontransformed rat embryonic fibroblast cells and a derivative of the same cells that were constitutively transformed by oncogenic h-ras (14Zhang R. Tan Z. Liang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24436-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here we show that the expression of col1a1 was essentially abrogated by oncogenic ras through the MAP kinase pathway. However, Ras-transformed cells still retained the ability to bind and respond to exogenous type I collagen. Using a defined sequence of soluble col1a1 that spanned the C-terminal region of the protein, we have biochemically identified this collagen-specific binding factor (CBF) as Endo180 (uPARAP, CD280) on the surface of parental and Ras-transformed rodent embryonic fibroblast cells. We showed that the interaction of Endo180 with the C-terminal region of type I collagen plays a prominent role in cell-matrix adhesion. Cell Lines and Culture—Rat-1 embryonic fibroblast cells and the Rat-1(Ras) h-ras-transformed derivative have been previously described (12Liang P. Averboukh L. Zhu W. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12515-12519Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Rat-1:iRas cells, which are a derivative of the Rat-1 cells, were grown in the presence of 200 μg/ml Hygromycin B (Roche Applied Science). When these cells reached 80% confluence, they were treated with 5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thioglucoside (IPTG; Invitrogen) to induce expression of oncogenic h-ras, essentially as described (20McCarthy S.A. Samuels M.L. Pritchard C.A. Abraham J.A. McMahon M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). RIE rat intestinal epithelial cells are spontaneously immortalized, diploid, nontransformed cells and were obtained from Dr. R. Coffey. RIE(h-Ras) and RIE(k-Ras) derivatives were established by stably transfecting RIE cells with mutant h-ras and k-ras (12V), respectively (21Gangarosa L.M. Sizemore N. Graves-Deal R. Oldham S.M. Der C.J. Coffey R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18926-18931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). CosE5 cells, developed from clonally purified COS1 cells, and 293T cells were obtained from GenHunter Corp (Nashville, TN). All of the above cell lines were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 10% CO2. Phoenix (amphoteric) packaging cells were provided by Dr. A. Reynolds and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For adhesion assays, tissue culture plates (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were coated with rat tail type I collagen (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA) using the thin coating procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, type I collagen was diluted to 50 μg/ml in 0.02 m acetic acid (EMD Chemicals) and applied to the tissue culture plates for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The plates then were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cells were grown on the plates until they reached confluence. Differential Display—DD was carried out essentially as previously described (19Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4694) Google Scholar). Total RNA was purified from Rat-1 and Rat-1(Ras) cells that had been grown in the absence or presence of 50 μm PD98059 (Calbiochem) for 24 h, using the RNApure Reagent (GenHunter), following the manufacturer's instructions. DNase I treatment of RNA prior to DD was carried out using the MessageClean kit (GenHunter Corp.). DD-PCR were completed using 160 combinations of one-base anchored oligo(dT) primers and rationally designed arbitrary 13-mers from the RNAimage kit (GenHunter Corp.), representing about 60% gene coverage (22Yang S. Liang P. Mol. Biotechnol. 2004; 27: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). cDNAs that were generated from the 3′ termini of the mRNAs were separated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Bands representing cDNAs of interest were excised from the gel, cloned into the PCR-TRAP cloning vector (GenHunter Corp.), and sequenced using the Sequenase kit from U.S. Biochemical Corp. Northern Blotting—Northern blot analysis was completed as previously described (23Stein S. Liang P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1274-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In summary, 10 μg of total RNA was denatured, separated on a 1% agarose gel with 3% formaldehyde, transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized using either a 208-bp cDNA probe of col1a1 obtained by differential display or a 5.5-kb cDNA probe of Endo180 obtained from IMAGE clone 7099211. Both probes were radioactively labeled with [α-32P]dATP by random priming with the HotPrime DNA labeling kit (GenHunter) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After hybridization, the membranes were washed, and bands were visualized by autoradiography at –80 °C. Development of a Secreted Human Placental Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) Collagen Fusion Construct—A 1.5-kb cDNA fragment encoding the C-terminal glycine repeat region and prodomain (amino acids 1000–1453) of rat col1a1 (accession number Z78279) was amplified by PCR using cloned α1(I) collagen cDNA as a template (PCR primers 5′-AGATCTGGTCGTGAGGGATCCCC-3′ and 5′-TCTAGAGTTGGGGGAAAGTGGGC-3′). The fragment was inserted into the BglII and XbaI sites of the APtag4 vector (GenHunter) to allow for in-frame fusion to the C terminus of secreted human placental AP (24Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Cell Transfection—The APtag4 vector and AP-Coll recombinant plasmid expressing secreted AP alone and AP-Coll, respectively, were stably co-transfected with the pBabe-puro plasmid (GenHunter) into 293T cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were selected in 10 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) to obtain stable clones that were clonally purified. Conditioned medium containing AP and AP-Coll was collected for binding assays. CosE5 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells in 6-well plates. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were transiently transfected with either pcDNA3 vector alone or the pcDNA3-Endo180 expression vector, which has been previously described (25Sheikh H. Yarwood H. Ashworth A. Isacke C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, quantitative or in situ receptor binding assays (described below) were carried out in duplicate. Quantitative and in Situ AP and AP-Coll Binding Assays—Quantitative and in situ receptor binding assays were completed as previously described (14Zhang R. Tan Z. Liang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24436-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), using the secreted AP and AP-Coll conditioned medium produced from stably transfected 293T cells. Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well on a 6-well tissue culture plate and grown until ∼80% confluent. Quantitative or in situ receptor binding assays then were performed in duplicate by incubating the cells with 1 ml/well of either secreted AP or AP-Coll conditioned medium containing equivalent AP activity units for 90 min at 37 °C. AP assay reagent A and AP assay reagent S (GenHunter) were used to measure the AP binding activity for the quantitative and in situ receptor binding assays, respectively. Slot Blot and Ligand Affinity Binding—Slot blot binding assays were performed on Rat-1 and Rat-1(Ras) whole cell extract (WCE) that had been prepared in cell lysis buffer A (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Briefly, the samples were either heated for 5 min at 100 °C or were not heated and then were applied to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF; Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) membrane via a slot blot apparatus. The membrane was probed with secreted AP or AP-Coll and stained with AP substrate S. Binding assays also were performed by transferring protein extract to a PVDF membrane after subjecting the extract to nonreducing SDS-PAGE (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). The membrane then was probed with secreted AP or AP-Coll, followed by either staining with AP substrate S to visualize the AP binding activity or additionally probing the membrane first with anti-AP monoclonal antibody (Seradyn, Ramsey, MN) and then with anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) and visualizing the proteins with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences), following the manufacturer's protocol. FACS Analysis—To perform FACS analysis, AP and AP-Coll conditioned medium was concentrated to 15 μg/ml using an Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter device with a molecular mass cut-off of 30 kDa (Millipore). Rat-1 and Rat-1(Ras) cells were washed with PBS and detached from tissue culture plates by exposure to 0.25% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) for 1 min at room temperature, and 3 × 105 cells were incubated for 90 min at room temperature with 15 μg/ml secreted AP or AP-Coll. Cells then were washed with PBS and probed with 20 μg/ml mouse anti-AP monoclonal antibody for 1 h, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse Ig antibody for another 1 h. Flow cytometry analysis then was performed using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). This assay was performed twice in triplicate. Competition Adhesion Assays—Rat-1 and Rat-1(Ras) cells were detached from tissue culture plates with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and washed in PBS, and 1 × 105 cells/sample were incubated with 293T-conditioned medium alone, 5 μg/ml secreted AP, or 5 μg/ml secreted AP-Coll for 90 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. The cells then were inoculated onto 96-well tissue culture plates that had been precoated with 50 μg/ml of rat tail type I collagen, 5 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma), or 100 μg/ml matrigel (BD Biosciences) in PBS overnight at 4 °C. After 90 min, unattached cells were removed from the wells, and adherent cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, and then stained with crystal violet (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ). Attached cells were lysed with 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, and the absorbance was read at A595. Biochemical Purification of the AP-Coll-specific Binding Protein—All steps of the following procedure were performed on ice. Rat-1 and Rat-1(Ras) membrane protein extract (MPE) was prepared by washing the cells with PBS and lysing the cells with lysis buffer B (15 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were scraped from the tissue culture plates, and the solution was pulled up and down through a 21-gauge needle syringe five times to fragment the cells. A quick spin at low speed was completed to remove large cellular debris, and the remaining supernatant was layered onto a 60% sucrose solution and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 35,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Solubilized MPE was resuspended in cell lysis buffer B containing 0.1% Triton X-100 using a 26-gauge needle syringe, incubated with agitation at 4 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at high speed for 2 min. The supernatant then was used in fast performance liquid chromatography to isolate the CBF. Rat-1 MPE was applied to a ResourceQ anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been pre-equilibrated with 5 column volumes of lysis buffer B plus 0.1% Triton X-100. Unbound proteins were eluted with the same buffer, whereas bound proteins were eluted as 0.5-ml fractions by a 20-ml linear salt gradient from 0.0 to 0.5 m of NaCl with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Eluate fractions were applied to a PVDF membrane via a slot blot apparatus, as previously described here, and the membrane was probed with secreted AP or AP-Coll conditioned medium. The fraction containing the highest level of AP-Coll-specific binding activity as well as WCE and MPE was applied to a nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was probed with secreted AP or AP-Coll and stained with AP substrate S. An AP-Coll-specific binding protein was identified at ∼180 kDa in all three lanes. Alternatively, the nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel was stained with Colloidal Blue (Invitrogen) for 4 h at room temperature and destained overnight. A band with the same electrophoretic motility as the AP-Coll-specific binding protein was found in the fraction of interest. In-gel Protein Digestion and Mass Spectrometry of Peptides—Proteins from the fraction of interest were separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and visualized using the Colloidal Blue staining kit. An ∼180-kDa band was excised from the gel, cut into cubes, equilibrated in 50 mm NH4HCO3, reduced with dithiothreitol (3 mm in 50 mm NH4HCO3, 37 °C for 15 min), and alkylated with iodoacetamide (6 mm in 50 mm NH4HCO3 for 15 min). The gel cubes were then dehydrated with acetonitrile and rehydrated with 15 μl of 20 mm NH4HCO3 containing 0.01 μg/μl modified trypsin (Promega). Trypsin digestion was carried out for ∼2 h at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted with 60% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, dried by vacuum centrifugation, and reconstituted in 5 μl of 60% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. A small aliquot (0.4 μl) was applied to a target plate and overlaid with 0.4 μl of a α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry was carried out using a Voyager 4700 mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) operated in reflectron mode. For intact peptide mass analysis, the mass spectra were calibrated to within 50 ppm using trypsin autolytic peptides present in the sample (m/z = 842.51 and 2211.09 daltons). Peptide ion masses (M + H) and MS/MS fragmentation data on specific ions were collectively used for data base interrogation against the NCBInr data base using GPS Explorer software (Applied Biosystems) running the MASCOT algorithm. This search generated an unambiguous match to gi|5174485 human mannose receptor, C type 2, also known as gi|4835878 human endocytic receptor Endo180 (Mowse score = 97 with partial oxidation of methionine and complete carbamidomethylation of cysteine). Matched ions included m/z = 907.45, 1190.60, 1356.78, 1596.67, 1714.84, 1728.71, 1733.77, and 1870.88. Fragmentation spectra generated from the parent ions at m/z = 907.45 (225WGFCPIK231), 1356.78 (125TLGDQLSLLLGAR137), 1596.67 (1097SCTEETHGFICQK1109), 1714.84 (548LCTDHGSQLVTITNR562), and 1733.77 (476DSLEDCVTIWGPEGR490) validated the predicted amino acid sequences. A rat homolog was not present in the NCBInr data base, which most likely explains ion signals present in the MALDI-TOF MS (and corresponding MS/MS fragmentation spectra) that do not yield significant matches (data not shown). Western Blot Analysis—AP and AP-Coll conditioned medium and WCE, cytoplasmic protein extract, and MPE from various cells were used in immunoblotting assays. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad). Aliquots (20–50 μg) were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing (+β-mercaptoethanol) or nonreducing (–β-mercaptoethanol) conditions. For Western blot analysis, proteins were blotted onto a PVDF membrane, blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (J. T. Baker Inc.), and probed with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were used in this study: anti-Ras antibody (Oncogene Science, Long Island, NY), AP-monoclonal antibody (Seradyn) and AP-polyclonal antibody (GenHunter), Endo180 monoclonal antibody A5/158 (25Sheikh H. Yarwood H. Ashworth A. Isacke C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and polyclonal anti-Endo180 antiserum (26Isacke C.M. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Trowbridge I.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2606-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that have been described previously, and actin antibody A2066 (Sigma). Blots then were incubated for at least 1 h at room temperature with the following secondary antibodies: anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase Amersham Biosciences). Reactive proteins were visualized with an ECL kit following the manufacturer's protocol. Deglycosylation of Endo180—Deglycosylation of asparagine-linked (N-linked) and serine/threonine-linked (O-linked) carbohydrates from Rat-1 and Rat-1(Ras) MPE was completed with endoglycanase F and endo-o-glycosidase (Prozyme, San Leandro, CA), respectively, following the manufacturer's recommended procedure (27Tan J.C. Braun S. Rong H. DiGiacomo R. Dolphin E. Baldwin S. Narula S.K. Zavodny P.J. Chou C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12906-12911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The MPE then was loaded onto a nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and probed with Endo180 polyclonal antiserum to visualize deglycosylation. RNA Interference—The small interfering RNA (siRNA) vector pSuperRetro was a gift from Dr. R. Agami. The pSuperRetro-Endo180 plasmid was designed according to Brummelkamp et al. (28Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3963) Google Scholar, 29Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Briefly, to establish pSuperRetro-Endo180, the following sequences from rodent Endo180 cDNA were subcloned into pSuperRetro that had been digested with BlgII and HindIII: oligonucleotides 5′-CCCGATGTCTTCCTCATCT-3′ and 5′-CGTGCAAACAATGCATCGA-3′. The constructs were confirmed by sequencing (GenHunter). Retroviral infection was performed by transfecting the recombinant plasmids into Phoenix packaging cells using FuGENE 6, following the manufacturer's recommended procedure. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the medium containing the retrovirus was collected, filtered, treated with polybrene (4 μg/ml), and transferred to Rat-1 and Rat-1(Ras) target cells. Infected cells were selected with puromycin (10 μg/ml), and clones were isolated using a cloning ring. Quantitative and in situ cell surface staining assays then were performed with the clones, as described previously. cDNA Cloning and Sequencing—The full-length nucleotide sequence of murine Endo180 was used to BLAST search for rat sequences in the NCBI rat expressed sequence tag data base. One matching expressed sequence tag clone was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) (IMAGE number 7099211), and the entire coding region was sequenced by primer walking (GenHunter). The protein sequences of human, mouse, and rat Endo180 were aligned with MultiAlign. Down-regulation of col1a1 Collagen by the ras Oncogenes through the MAP Kinase Pathway—To identify genes controlled by the ras oncogenes, we performed DD to compare the gene expression profiles of Rat-1 embryonic fibroblast cells and the Rat-1(Ras) h-ras-transformed derivative (12Liang P. Averboukh L. Zhu W. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12515-12519Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in the absence or presence of PD98059, an inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase (MEK), to rule out cell line-specific gene expression (30Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Two types of genes were sought, those that were expressed in both the nontransformed Rat-1 cells and in the Rat-1(Ras) cells treated with PD98059 and those expressed only in the transformed cells in the absence of PD98059. The α1 chain of type I collagen (col1a1) was identified as a gene expressed in the Rat-1 cells but greatly down-regulated in the Ras-transformed cells (Fig. 1A). Expression of col1a1 was up-regulated when the Rat-1(Ras) cells were treated with PD98059, suggesting that col1a1 is a gene whose expression is controlled by oncogenic ras through the MAP kinase pathway. Northern blot analysis using a 208-bp cDNA probe of col1a1 confirmed the regulation of this gene by the ras oncogene through the MAP kinase pathway. Expression of col1a1 was apparent 4 h after the Rat-1(Ras) cells were treated with PD98059, whereas the MEK inhibitor had little effect on α1(I) collagen expression in the parental Rat-1 cells (Fig. 1B). To determine whether regulation of col1a1 expression by the ras oncogene was specific to fibroblast cells, rat intestinal epithelial (RIE) cells and the oncogenic h-Ras-transformed RIE(h-ras) derivative were analyzed by Northern blot. Both Rat-1 and RIE cells expressed high levels of col1a1, whereas expres"

Following autophosphorylation at tyrosine 397, FAK binds the Src homology 2 domains of Src and phosphoinositide 3-kinase, among several other possible binding partners. To further investigate the role of phosphorylated FAK in cell migration in situ, peptides comprising residues 391–406 of human FAK with caged phosphotyrosine 397 were synthesized. Although the caged phosphopeptides were stable to phosphatase activity, the free phosphopeptides showed a half-life of ∼10–15 min in cell lysates. Migrating NBT-II cells (a rat bladder tumor cell line) were microinjected with the caged FAK peptide and locally photoactivated using a focused laser beam. The photoactivation of caged FAK peptide in 8-μm diameter spots over the cell body led to the temporary arrest of the leading edge migration within ∼1 min of irradiation. In contrast, cell body migration was not inhibited. Microinjection of a non-caged phosphorylated tyrosine 397 FAK peptide into migrating NBT-II cells also led to lamellar arrest; however, this approach lacks the temporal control afforded by the caged phosphopeptides. Photoactivation of related phosphotyrosine peptides with altered sequences did not result in transient lamellar arrest. We hypothesize that the phosphorylated FAK peptide competes with the endogenous FAK for binding to FAK effectors including, but not limited to, Src and phosphoinositide 3-kinase, causing spatiotemporal misregulation and subsequent lamellar arrest.

Focal adhesions are cell-surface specializations that connect the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton. Transmembrane integrins and associated cytoskeletal proteins, including talin, vinculin, α-actinin, and filamin, perform this function within the focal adhesion (1Sastry S.K. Burridge K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 2Zamir E. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3583-3590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, focal adhesions contain numerous regulatory molecules, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), 1The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; SH2, Src homology 2; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; pTyr, phosphotyrosine; cpTyr, caged pTyr; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HBTU, O-benzotriazolyl-N-N-N′-N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate; HOBt, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole; MS(ESI), mass spectrometry (electrospray ionization); DIEA, N,N-diisopropylethylamine; DMF, N,N-dimethylformamide; Ahx, aminohexanoic acid; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; Rh, rhodamine. which is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase. Cell binding to the extracellular matrix clusters integrins, which, in turn, stimulates phosphorylation of FAK on tyrosine 397; this creates docking sites where SH2 domain-containing proteins, such as Src, can bind. In this way, FAK links integrin receptors to intracellular signaling events related to cell migration and survival. The importance of FAK in cell migration was demonstrated when FAK null fibroblasts showed reduced migration compared with wild type cells generated from the same stage of mouse embryos (3Ilic D.

The migration defect could be rescued by expression of wild type FAK (4Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Fry D.W. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4806-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 5Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of FAK in Chinese hamster ovary cells also resulted in increased migration (6Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither re-expression of mutated FAK (Y397F) in the FAK null cells nor overexpression of Y397F in Chinese hamster ovary cells enhanced migration. Upon phosphorylation, the region containing tyrosine 397 may bind to the SH2 domains of Src (7Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

The defect in the stimulation of migration exhibited by Y397F is presumably because of a resultant inability to recruit one or more of these binding partners. FAK phosphopeptides have been synthesized to test interactions of phosphotyrosine 397 (pTyr397 FAK) with the SH2 domains of Src (17Thomas J.W. Ellis B. Boerner R.J. Knight W.B. White G.C. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 577-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and PI3K, respectively (11Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.L. J. Biol.

Peptides containing the pTyr397 FAK region of FAK might therefore be useful for probing FAK function in migrating cells. In the present work, we investigated the role of pTyr397 FAK within FAK by introducing photoactivatable caged phosphopeptides containing Tyr397 and the surrounding sequence into migrating cells. A caged compound includes a photocleavable protecting group that masks an essential functionality. In this context, a peptide or protein is prepared by covalently linking a photolabile protecting group to a limited number of critical functional groups in the biomolecule (18Humphrey D. Rajfur Z. Imperiali B. Marriott G. Roy P. Jacobson K. Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Live Cell Imaging: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2005: 159-176Google Scholar). The caged peptides can be introduced into the cells by microinjection. Upon removal of the caging moiety by photolysis, the bioactive form of the peptide or protein is produced within the cell (19Kaplan J.H. Forbush III, B. Hoffman J.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1929-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 20Park C-H. Givens R.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2453-2463Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Photoactivation of caged proteins/peptides thus offers insights into cellular dynamics not achievable using genetic methods: perturbations that can be controlled temporally and, in some cases, spatially are followed with subsequent observations of altered cell behavior. However, thus far, there are few studies using caged peptides and proteins to study cell migration (21Walker J.W. Gilbert S.H. Drummond R.M. Yamada M. Sreekumar R. Carraway R.E. Ikebe M. Fay F.S.

Science. 2004; 304: 743-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that photoactivation of a caged phosphotyrosine peptide (cpTyr397FAK), based on the sequence of FAK from residues Val391 to Thr406 surrounding the autophosphorylation site at Tyr397, alters cell migration by temporarily halting lamellar extension. The effect on migration is specific for the pTyr397FAK sequence because similar peptides containing phosphotyrosine but with altered surrounding residues fail to alter cell migration upon uncaging. The time scale of temporary inhibition of migration is consistent with the time to dephosphorylate the pTyr397FAK peptide in cell lysates. We speculate that the phenotype is related to perturbation of FAK-effector interactions including, but not limited to, Src and PI3K. Peptides containing tyrosine (Tyr), free phosphotyrosine (pTyr), and caged phosphotyrosine (cpTyr) were synthesized using standard Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis protocols, purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and confirmed as the desired products by mass spectrometry. The caged phosphotyrosine residue was incorporated into the peptide sequence using a new building block for solid phase synthesis (25Rothman D.M. Vazquez M.E. Vogel E.M. Imperiali B. J. Org. Chem. 2003; 68: 6795-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All peptide synthesis reagents were purchased from Applied Biosystems or Novabiochem, and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Molecular Probes. High performance liquid chromatography was performed using a Waters 600E HPLC fitted with a Waters 600 automated control module and a Waters 2487 dual wavelength absorbance detector recording at 228 and 280 nm. For analytical HPLC a Beckman Ultrasphere C18, 5 μm, 4.6 × 150-mm reverse phase column was used. For preparative separations a YMC-pack, C18, 250 × 20-mm reverse phase column was used. The standard gradient for analytical and preparatory HPLC used was 93:7–0:100 over 35 min (water:acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed on a PerSeptive Biosystems Mariner Biospectrometry Workstation (turbo ion source). Peptide Synthesis—Peptide synthesis was made using standard solid phase peptide synthesis protocols on a 0.05-mmol scale using a 0.21 mmol/g loading PAL-PEG-PS solid support. Amino acids were purchased from Novabiochem as protected Fmoc amino acids with the standard side chain protecting scheme: Fmoc-Ala-OH, Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH, Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH, Fmoc-Glu(OtBu)-OH, Fmoc-Ile-OH, Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-Thr(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH, and Fmoc-Val-OH. Phosphotyrosine was introduced as the monobenzyl ester Fmoc-Tyr(PO(OBzl)OH)-OH. Amino acids were manually coupled in 4-fold excess using a mixture of O-benzotriazolyl-N-N-N′-N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) in DMF as activating agents. Each amino acid was activated for 2 min with the HBTU/HOBt mixture and DIEA in DMF before being added to the resin. Amide coupling reactions were conducted for 1 h and monitored using the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid TNBS test (26Hancock W.S. Battersby J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Deprotection of the base-labile Fmoc protecting group was accomplished by treating the resin with 20% piperidine in DMF solution for 15 min. Acetylation was accomplished by treating the resin with acetic anhydride and DIEA in DMF. Peptides were cleaved from the resin, and side chain protecting groups were simultaneously removed by treatment with the following cleavage mixture: 50 μl of dichloromethane, 25 μl of triisopropyl silane, 25 μl of water, and 950 μl of trifluoroacetic acid (1 ml of mixture/50 mg of resin) for 2 h at room temperature. All peptides were precipitated with diethyl ether (4 °C) and further purified by HPLC. Operations involving the caged phosphotyrosine peptides were performed in the dark. Detailed Protocol for a Typical Coupling—Piperidine (3 ml, 20% in DMF) was added to 0.05 mmol FmocHN-AEIIDEEDT in solid support, and nitrogen was passed through the mixture for 15 min. The resin was then filtered and washed with DMF (3 × 3 ml × 3 min), and the TNBS test was run with a small resin sample to confirm that the deprotection was successful. In a separate vessel, Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH (79 mg, 0.2 mmol) was dissolved in HOBt/HBTU solution (1 ml 0.2 m HBTU, 0.2 m HOBt in DMF), and DIEA (1.5 ml of 0.195 m solution in DMF) was added. The resulting mixture was activated for 2 min and then added to the resin. Nitrogen was passed through the resin suspension for 1 h, at which time the TNBS test of a small resin sample was negative. The resin was washed with DMF (3 × 3 ml × 3 min) and subjected to the subsequent deprotection/coupling cycles in a similar manner. Acetylation—A 500-μl aliquot of acetic anhydride and DIEA (3 ml, 0.195 m in DMF) were added to the resin-bound free amino-terminal peptide. Nitrogen was passed through the mixture for 15 min. The resin was filtered and washed with DMF (3 × 3 ml × 3 min) and CH2Cl2 (2 × 3 ml × 3 min) and dried under vacuum before cleavage. Cleavage—A 0.05-mmol sample of resin-bound peptide was dried overnight and placed in a 50-ml flask. To this, 5 ml of the cleavage mixture (250 μl of CH2Cl2, 125 μl of water, 125 μl of tri-isopropylsilane, trifluoroacetic acid to 5 ml) was added, and the resulting mixture was shaken for 2 h, the resin was filtered, and the trifluoroacetic acid filtrate was concentrated under an argon stream to a volume of 2 ml and added over ice-cold ethyl ether (40 ml). After 5 min, the peptide was centrifuged and washed again with 40 ml of cold ether. The solid residue was dried under argon, redissolved in acetonitrile/water 1:1 (5 ml), and purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC. The pooled fractions were lyophilized and redissolved in deionized water. In some cases, addition of a small amount of base (0.05% NaHCO3) was necessary to solubilize the peptides. The identity of the final peptide products was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Coupling with Rhodamine—For rhodamine coupling, a 0.015-mmol aliquot of free amine-containing peptide on solid support was washed with DMF (3 × 3 ml × 3 min) and filtered. The resin was then suspended in DMF (500 μl) and DIEA (50 μl, 0.3 mmol, 20 eq), and to this mixture was added 5 (and 6)-carboxy)-X-rhodamine, succinimidyl ester (12 mg, 0.02 mmol). The resulting mixture was stirred in the dark overnight. The resin was filtered, washed with DMF (3 × 3 ml × 3 min), iPrOH (2 × 3 ml × 3 min), and dichloromethane (3 × 3 ml × 3 min), dried under vacuum, and stored at 4 °C. Peptide Characterization—Peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC, and concentrations of stock solutions were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. When bright chromophores were present (rhodamine), then the reported extinction coefficients for those chromophores were used for calculating the concentrations by spectrophotometry. cpTyr397FAK sequence: Ac-VSETDD-cpY-AEIIDEEDT-CONH2, C86H125N18O42P, Mass.: 2112.8, MS(ESI); 1057.9 ([MH2]2+ (100); 720.3, [MHNa2]3+ (8)), ϵ (m–1, cm–1) 5332 (267 nm). pTyr397FAK sequence: Ac-VSETDD-pY-AEIIDEEDT-CONH2, C78H118N17O40P, Mass.: 1963.7, MS(ESI); 1057.9, [MH2]2+ (100). ϵ (m–1, cm–1) 350 (264 nm).

Lifetime of pYFAK after Uncaging—A 25-ml sample of NBT-II cell culture was centrifuged; the pellet was then treated with 250 μl of 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline solution and gently mixed with a micropipette. The resulting mixture was transferred to a 1-ml tube and centrifuged at high speed (13,000 rpm) for 8 min. An 80-μl aliquot of the supernatant was added to 5.6 μl of Rh-Ahx-pYFAK stock solution (30.5 μm) to give a final peptide concentration of 2 μm. The resulting mixture was incubated at 25 °C, and 3-μl aliquots were taken consecutively at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min and diluted in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5. Each sample was kept frozen at –78 °C until injected into the HPLC for analysis. As a control, an 80-μl aliquot of lysate was treated for 5 min with 400 μm pervanadate to inactivate tyrosine phosphatases, and then 5.6 μl of stock Rh-Ahx-pYFAK solution was added to the lysate and the peptide was incubated at room temperature. For analysis, 3-μl aliquots were taken at 10 and 20 min and added to 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5. Each sample was kept frozen at –78 °C until injection onto the HPLC for analysis. 160 μl of NBT-II cell lysate (from 20 ml of culture) was incubated with Flu-pYFAK (final concentration 2 μm). GST·Src SH2 and GST·PI3K C-terminal SH2 Expression and Purification—Src and PI3K SH2 domains were expressed and purified as GST fusion proteins essentially following reported procedures (27Smith D.B. Johnson K. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). In summary, plasmids encoding the GST fusion proteins were transformed into bacteria Escherichia coli DH5-competent cells; Invitrogen). Bacteria were grown to mid-log phase, induced at 37 °C for 3–4 h with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and lysed by treatment with lysozyme (1 mg/ml, 30 min) followed by sonication (phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.4, with 100 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), 30 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and fusion proteins were purified by binding to glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted from the beads (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm reduced glutathione, pH 8) and concentrated by centrifugation through a cellulose membrane (10 kDa molecular mass cutoff; Millipore). Proteins were quantified by Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) relative to a bovine serum albumin standard. All fusion proteins were analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot analysis with anti-GST antibodies. Kd Values for Peptide Binding to SH2 Domains of Src and PI3K—All experiments were performed using a VP-ITC instrument from Microcal Inc. Peptides and proteins were dialyzed extensively against the same buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) using a 500-Da molecular mass cutoff cellulose membrane (Spectrum Laboratories Inc.). Initial experiments using lower pH resulted in precipitation of the protein and/or peptide during the titration. In a typical titration, peptides (1–3 mm concentration) were added over 25 injections (5 μl) to purified GST·SH2 proteins (200–400 μm) that were present in the isothermal calorimeter cell at 25 °C. This temperature was chosen to minimize the contributions of ligand-induced refolding of the protein while maintaining a physiologically relevant temperature of operation. In every titration the concentration of the reactants was sufficient to result in saturation of the titration curve. Cell Culture—For the movement of NBT-II cells, suspension culture Petri dishes (35 mm) were coated by incubating with 10 μg/ml collagen (rat tail type I) for 30 min. NBT-II cells (American Type Culture Collection) were treated with trypsin and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, plated at low density on the dishes, and cultured for 12 h at 37 °C. Competitive Binding Assay in Cell Lysates—As previously described, chicken embryo cells were isolated from day 9 embryos and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 4% fetal bovine serum + 1% chick serum (28Reynolds A.B. Roesel D.J. Kanner S.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). FAK was expressed in chicken embryo cells using the replication-competent, avian retroviral vector called RCAS, and cells were transfected as previously described (28Reynolds A.B. Roesel D.J. Kanner S.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 29Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (30Thomas J.W. Cooley M.A. Broome J.M. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Lombardo C.R. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36684-36692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described (30Thomas J.W. Cooley M.A. Broome J.M.

The protein concentration of lysates was determined by using the bicinchonic acid assay (Pierce). The expression of GST fusion proteins (Src or PI3K SH2 domains) was induced by using 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. E. coli were harvested, lysed by sonication, and the fusion proteins purified by using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) as previously described (30Thomas J.W. Cooley M.A. Broome J.M. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Lombardo C.R. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36684-36692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). GST pulldowns were performed from 0.2 mg of lysate from chicken embryo cells expressing FAK. Lysates were precleared with 10 μg of GST. The supernatant was then incubated with 10 μg of fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads either with or without peptides at increasing concentrations for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in sample buffer (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) and analyzed by Western blotting with polyclonal antiserum BC4 to recognize FAK. Western blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies and processed for enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Microinjection—Microinjection of peptides into cells was performed with a semiautomatic Eppendorf InjectMan NI 2/Femtojet system. Original Eppendorf Femtotip needles were loaded with 1.5–2 μl of injection solution. The base pressure of the system was adjusted (by visual assessment of the fluorescent marker outflow from the microinjection needle in the 20–100 hectopascal range) to keep a constant low outflow of the loaded solute into cell medium. Similarly, because of the increasing viscosity of the loaded solution, the injection pressure was adjusted to achieve a similar brightness of co-loaded fluorescent marker in microinjected cells (50 to up to 1200 hectopascal in some cases). After setting up the vertical limit position of the microneedle, each cell was automatically injected with peptide solution by InjectMan with preset speed of the microinjection needle movement. The velocity of the microneedle movement varied from 45 to 130 μm/s. The procedure was repeated to obtain the desired number of microinjected cells. Cells microinjected with caged phosphopeptides were allowed to recover in the tissue culture incubator for 30 min. During microinjection and subsequent time lapse microscopy, cells were maintained at 37 °C and CO2 was flushed over the dish. To distinguish between microinjected and non-microinjected cells, a tracer (either rhodamine-labeled peptide or rhodamine-dextran) was co-loaded with the peptides at a final concentration range <10% of that of biological test peptide. We evaluated the consistency of microinjected volumes when different caged peptides were introduced. NBT-II cells, seeded on glass or plastic surface, were microinjected with either cpTyr397FAK or Ala395cpTyr397FAK peptides together with fluorescent marker (rhodamine dextran) as described above. Cells were left in the incubator for 1 h and then placed in an environmental chamber on the microscope stage. From phase contrast and epifluorescence images of cells loaded with rhodamine dextran, the area of cells of interest was manually outlined and the average value of fluorescence of the outlined area was determined using Metamorph imaging software routines. The mean value (arbitrary units) of single cell average fluorescence was 105 ± 27 for cpTyr397FAK (269 cells) and 97 ± 28 for Ala395cpTyr397FAK (143 cells). The results indicated that constant volumes of the solutions containing cpTyr397FAK or Ala395cpTyr397FAK peptides could be microinjected. Photoactivation—For uncaging of caged FAK phosphopeptides, UV light from an Argon ion laser (Spectra Physics), with multiline optics covering a 333.6–363.8-nm range, was focused onto a ∼8-μm-diameter spot on the specimen using a ×20 Nikon objective. For all experiments, the estimated power of the laser beam after passing through the objective was 67 microwatts (measured by a power meter) and the duration of illumination was 100 ms. Concentration Estimates of Microinjected and Uncaged Peptide— Estimates for the concentration of the microinjected peptides as well as uncaged peptide are given in Table I. Using the Eppendorf Injectman, we estimate that 20–200 fl of peptide is microinjected into each cell. If the average cell volume of NBT-II cells is 1.5 pl, an additional 1–10% (32Yeh R.H. Yan X. Cammer M. Bresnick A.R. Lawrence D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11527-11532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) of the total cell volume is added by microinjection. To estimate the concentrations of peptide after uncaging, a quantum efficiency of uncaging for these peptides of 0.3 was used based on characterization of a paxillin peptide with the same caging moiety (33Rothman D.M. Vazquez M.E. Vogel E.M. Imperiali B. Org. Lett. 2002; 4: 2865-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Table IEstimated concentration of microinjected and uncaged"

Oxidation products, such as kynurenines, react with proteins to form yellow-brown pigments and cause covalent cross-linking. We generated a monoclonal antibody against 3-hydroxykynurenine (3OHKYN)-modified keyhole limpet hemocyanin and characterized it using 3OHKYN-modified amino acids and proteins. This monoclonal antibody reacted with 3OHKYN-modified Nα-acetyl lysine, Nα-acetyl histidine, Nα-acetyl arginine, and Nα-acetyl cysteine. Among the several tryptophan oxidation products tested, 3OHKYN produced the highest concentration of antigen when reacted with human lens proteins. A major antigen from the reaction of 3OHKYN and Nα-acetyl lysine was purified by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography, which was characterized by spectroscopy and identified as 2-amino-3-hydroxyl-α-((5S)-5-acetamino-5-carboxypentyl amino)-γ-oxo-benzene butanoic acid. Enzyme-digested cataractous lens proteins displayed 3OHKYN-derived modifications. Immunohistochemistry revealed 3OHKYN modifications in proteins associated with the lens fiber cell plasma membrane. The low molecular products (<10,000 Da) isolated from normal lenses after reaction with glucosidase followed by incubation with proteins generated 3OHKYN-derived products. Human lens epithelial cells incubated with 3OHKYN showed intense immunoreactivity. We also investigated the effect of glycation on tryptophan oxidation and kynurenine-mediated modification of lens proteins. The results showed that glycation products failed to oxidize tryptophan or generate kynurenine modifications in proteins. Our studies indicate that 3OHKYN modifies lens proteins independent of glycation to form products that may contribute to protein aggregation and browning during cataract formation.

Our studies indicate that 3OHKYN modifies lens proteins independent of glycation to form products that may contribute to protein aggregation and browning during cataract formation. Crystallins are the major proteins of the lens, and they constitute 90% of the soluble proteins. A number of physicochemical changes occur in lens proteins during aging, and during cataract formation, similar changes occur at an exaggerated rate. The most striking changes in these proteins include yellowing and browning of proteins, intra- and intermolecular cross-linking, and cross-linking with fiber cell membrane proteins (1Bron A.J. Vrensen G.F. Koretz J. Maraini G. Harding J.J. Ophthalmologica. 2000; 214: 86-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 2Spector A. Isr. J. Med.

Metabolism. 2000; 49: 9-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and may thus synergistically contribute to the observed lens protein modifications in aging and cataract formation. Oxidative modifications within the lens may occur either on proteins or on protein-free constituents. Protein-free tryptophan in the lens undergoes both enzymatic (12Goldstein L.E. Leopold M.C. Huang X. Atwood C.S. Saunders A.J. Hartshorn M. Lim J.T. Faget K.Y. Muffat J.A. Scarpa R.C. Chylack Jr., L.T. Bowden E.F. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I.

The next enzymatic steps produce kynurenine (KYN), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3OHKYN), 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, quinolinic acid, and nicotinic acid (12Goldstein L.E. Leopold M.C. Huang X. Atwood C.S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7266-7275Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The kynurenines within the lens become enzymatically glycosylated to O-β-glucosides. Quantification of these products in the human lens shows that 3-hydroxykynurenine O-β-d-glucoside (3OHKYNG) is the most abundant form followed by 4-(2-amino-3-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxabutanoic acid O-β-d-glucoside, l-kynurenine, and 3-hydroxykynurenine (14Taylor L.M. Aquilina A.J. Jamie J.F. Truscott R.J. Exp. Eye Res. 2002; 75: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The kynurenine products produced from protein-free tryptophan readily pass through cell membranes and could thus diffuse through the cortex of the lens. Kynurenines are unstable at physiological pH; they undergo side chain deamination to produce α, β unsaturated ketoalkenes (15Vazquez S. Garner B. Sheil M.M. Truscott R.J. Free Radic. Res. 2000; 32: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Kynurenine levels decrease in the lens with age (16Bova L.M. Sweeney M.H. Jamie J.F. Truscott R.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 200-205PubMed Google Scholar) and cataract formation (17Streete I.M. Jamie J.F. Truscott R.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 4091-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which may be due to their reaction with lens proteins. Kynurenines react with nucleophilic amino acids, such as cysteine, histidine, and lysine in lens proteins (18Garner B. Shaw D.C. Lindner R.A. Carver J.A. Truscott R.J. Biochim. Biophys.

One of the products of the reaction of 3OHKYNG with lens GSH is glutathionyl-3-hydroxykynurenine glucoside (21Garner B. Vazquez S. Griffith R. Lindner R.A. Carver J.A. Truscott R.J. J. Biol.

Another recent study confirmed specific histidine modification in αB-crystallin that was incubated with KYN; modification of histidine 83 was thought to affect its chaperone function (24Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 1107-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Other crystallins appear to be modified by kynurenines as well (25Aquilina J.A. Carver J.A. Truscott R.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11455-11464Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that kynurenines are responsible, in part, for protein cross-linking during aging and cataract formation. Kynurenines also play a role in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated crystallin modification. For example, kynurenines such as 3OHKYN that contain a hydroxyl group can generate ROS through transition metal reduction reactions (12Goldstein L.E. Leopold M.C. Huang X. Atwood C.S. Saunders A.J. Hartshorn M. Lim J.T. Faget K.Y. Muffat J.A. Scarpa R.C. Chylack Jr., L.T. Bowden E.F. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7266-7275Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Such reactions are implicated in cross-linking of crystallins. Because kynurenine-modified crystallins can generate ROS through photochemical reactions (26Parker N.R. Jamie J.F. Davies M.J.

In this reaction, sugars, ascorbate, and dicarbonyl compounds react with amino groups of lysine and arginine residues on proteins through the formation of ketoamine adducts on proteins (10Baynes J.W.

Ernahrungswiss. 1991; 30: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These adducts can produce ROS during their modification to advanced glycation end products (11Brownlee M.

We reasoned that glycation-derived ROS might induce the oxidation of tryptophan and contribute to lens protein modification by kynurenines. The present study was conducted to understand the role of 3OHKYN in lens protein modification and to determine the effect of glycation on tryptophan oxidation. Using a novel monoclonal antibody raised against 3OHKYN-modified keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), we demonstrate that 3OH-KYN-derived products are present in human cataractous lenses, provide structure of a major antigenic product, and show that glycation products do not influence tryptophan oxidation and kynurenine-mediated modification of proteins. Incubation of Proteins with 3OHKYN—Bovine serum albumin (BSA) or ribonuclease A (RNase A) at 10 mg/ml in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were incubated under sterile conditions in the dark with 25 mm 3OHKYN for 3 days at 37 °C. The incubation mixture was stirred after every 24 h, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4. The incubated material was then dialyzed against 4 liters of PBS for 48 h at 4 °C. Production of a Monoclonal Antibody against 3OHKYN-derived Modification—KLH at 10 mg/ml in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was incubated with 25 mm 3OHKYN for 3 days followed by dialysis against 4 liters of PBS for 48 h at 4 °C. The antibody was prepared according to the method of Oya et al. (31Oya T. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Miyata S. Maeda S. Osawa T. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18492-18502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were initially immunized by intraperitoneal injection with 30 μg of 3OHKYN-modified KLH followed by three booster intraperitoneal injections with 20 μg of the modified protein. After the final booster injection, spleen cells were collected and fused with P3/U1 murine myeloma cells using polyethylene glycol. The hybridomas were cultured in hypoxantine/aminopterin/thymidine selection medium. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to screen culture supernatants of hybridomas. Microplate wells were coated by incubation for 16 h at 4 °C with one of the following (1 μg/well) in 0.05 m sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.7): unmodified BSA, unmodified RNase A, 3OHKYN-modified BSA, or 3OHKYN-modified RNase A. The wells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and blocked with 300 μl of 5% nonfat dry milk (NFDM) in PBST for 2 h at room temperature. The wells were then washed three times with PBST and incubated with 50 μl of hybridoma supernatant for 2 h at room temperature in a humid chamber. Following incubation, the wells were washed three times with PBST and incubated with 50 μl of either goat anti-mouse IgG (1:15,000 dilution in PBST) or goat anti-mouse IgM (1:2,500 dilution in PBST) antibody for 1 h as described above. The wells were finally washed three times with PBST and incubated with 100 μl of 3,3′,5′,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Sigma). The enzyme reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 2 n H2SO4, and absorption of the chromophore was measured at 450 nm in a Dynex MRX 5000 Microplate Reader. An IgG antibody producing hybridoma with high specificity against 3OHKYN-modified proteins was expanded. We then purified the antibody from the culture medium on a protein G-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and stored aliquots at –20 °C. The monoclonal antibody was determined to be of IgG1k subclass. Modification of Human Lens Proteins and Nα-Acetyl Amino Acids by Tryptophan Oxidation Products—Water-soluble proteins (WS-HLP) were extracted from human lenses by homogenizing each lens in 2.0 ml of PBS followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed against 4 liters of PBS for 24 h at 4 °C. Samples of this material (5 mg/ml) were then incubated at 37 °C for 7 days in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with one of the following: Trp, 3OHKYN, anthranilic acid (AA) (all from Sigma), KYN (Fluka), or NFK. NFK was synthesized according to Simat and Steinhart (32Simat T.J. Steinhart H. J. Agric Food Chem. 1998; 46: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We also used benzoic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA) (Sigma) for incubations to test the specificity of the antibody. Trp and its oxidation products were used at 10 times the molar concentration of lysine in lens proteins. After incubation, the mixtures were dialyzed extensively against PBS for 48 h at 4 °C with a change of dialysis medium after 24 h. Nα-Acetyl lysine, Nα-acetyl arginine, Nα-acetyl histidine, and Nα-acetyl cysteine (all from Sigma) were incubated independently with either tryptophan or tryptophan oxidation products at a 5:1 molar ratio for 7 days at 37 °C as described above. Purification of Antigen from the Reaction Mixture of Nα-Acetyl Lysine and 3OHKYN—Nα-acetyl lysine (59 mm) was incubated with 3OHKYN (9.9 mm) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 7 days under sterile conditions. A sample (250 μl) of the reaction mixture was loaded on semipreparative reversed phase HPLC on a C18 reversed phase column (VYDAC, 218TP1010, 10 μm, 10 × 25 cm, Separations Group, Hesperia, CA). A linear gradient was established with solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and solvent B (50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water). The following program was applied: 0–5 min, 0% B; 5–50 min, 40% B; 50–60 min, 100% B; 60–68 min, 100% B; and 68–78 min, 0% B with a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. We used an online UV detector (Jasco Corp., Tokyo, Japan, Model UV-970) to monitor the column effluent for absorbance at 365 nm. Four major fractions were collected and dried in a Savant SpeedVac concentrator (Savant Instruments, Hicksville, NY) and resuspended in 200 μl of water. Each fraction (17 μl/well) was tested in a competitive ELISA for immunoreactivity against the antibody (ELISA procedure described below). The material eluted at ∼30 min had the strongest reaction with the antibody in this assay. To obtain a higher amount of pure antigen, we modified the HPLC method (described above) so that the reaction mixture of Nα-acetyl lysine and 3OHKYN was first passed through a Sep-Pak Light C18 cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA). After the application of the sample, the cartridge was sequentially eluted with stepwise gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluate from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water was collected, dried in a Savant SpeedVac concentrator, and finally suspended in water. This material was then purified with the same semipreparative reversed phase HPLC that we used previously for the crude mixture. A linear gradient of solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and solvent B (50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) was used. The program was slightly altered to improve separation of the compound: 0–5 min, 0% B; 5–50 min, 25% B; 50–80 min, 100% B; and 80–88 min, 0% B. The flow rate was 2.0 ml/min. The antigen peak now eluted at around 36 min. We collected this peak from 10 injections of 500 μl of each and pooled. This pooled sample was dried, suspended in water, and reinjected to the same column under same HPLC conditions. A single homogeneous peak at Rt = ∼36 min was obtained by this procedure. This material was lyophilized, and the product was characterized by spectroscopy. One-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer. Samples were dissolved in D2O for 1H-13C correlation experiments (heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC), heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC)). Fast atom bombardment-mass spectroscopy analyses were done in the Mass Spectrometry Facility at Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI in a JEOL HX-110 double focusing mass spectrometer. UV-visible spectra were recorded using Amersham Biosciences Spectra Max 190 spectrometer. Treatment of 3OHKYN with Ninhydrin—The procedure was as described by Miyata and Monnier (33Miyata S. Monnier V. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 89: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). 40 mm 3OHKYN was incubated with 10 mm ninhydrin in 300 μl of ethanol/acetic acid, pH 5.0, for 10 min at 65 °C. 25 mml-lysine was then added and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The mixture was dried on a Savant SpeedVac concentrator, dissolved in 200 μl of water, and analyzed by an ELISA outlined below. A control experiment in which l-lysine was used in the place of 3OHKYN was run simultaneously. Preparation of Protein-free Filtrate from Human Lenses—Four normal lenses from donors of 30–50 years of age were each homogenized in 2 ml of water and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was filtered through a Centricon YM-10 filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the filtrate was lyophilized and reconstituted in 100 μl of water. Incubation of Proteins with Human Lens Protein-free Filtrate—One half of the protein-free filtrate was digested with β-glucosidase (Sigma) to obtain 3OHKYN from its glucoside form. For this step, we used a 1% enzyme solution in 0.04 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.6) and incubated the material for 2 h at 37 °C. The sample was then filtered through a Centricon YM-10 filter to remove the enzyme. The digested and non-digested protein-free filtrates were incubated for 5 days at 37 °C with 1.0 mg of either RNase A or WS-HLP (see above) in 1.0 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The incubated samples were then dialyzed against 2 liters of PBS at 4 °C. Finally, 30 μg of modified protein in 50 μl of PBS/well was tested for antigen using a competitive ELISA (see below). ELISA—Microplate wells were coated with 3OHKYN-modified RNase A in 0.05 m carbonate buffer (pH 9.7) at a concentration of 1 μg/50 μl, incubated at 4 °C overnight, and then washed three times with PBST. Before use in the assay, the wells were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 300 μl of 5% NFDM in PBST and washed three times with PBST. The monoclonal antibody (1:200 diluted in 1% NFDM/PBS for proteins modified Trp oxidation products and 1:60 diluted for amino acids modified by 3OHKYN) was preincubated with the competitor for 2 h at 37 °C and then dispensed into specified wells and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. The washed plates were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, diluted 1:15,000) for 1 h at 37 °C as described earlier. The enzyme reaction was assessed by the addition of 100 μl of 3,3′,5′,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) followed by the addition of 50 μlof2 n H2SO4 and measurement of chromophore absorbance at 450 nm. Results were expressed as the ratio: B/B0, where B is the absorbance in the presence of competitor, and B0 is the absorbance in the absence of competitor. Western Blotting—WS-HLP from cataractous and normal lenses were digested with proteinase K (2% w/w in PBS) for 30 min at 37 °C, aliquots of the digest corresponding to 20 μg of protein were separated on 18% reducing gels, and the proteins were transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore). Comparable gels were stained with BioSafe Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad). The membranes were then blocked with 5% NFDM in PBS for 2 h and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:20 dilution of the anti-KLH-3OHKYN (10.3 μg/ml) monoclonal antibody. After washing five times for 10 min with PBST, the membranes were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Promega Corp.) diluted 1:15,000. After repeated washing (five times for 10 min with PBST), the membranes were treated with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) for 5 min and exposed to x-ray film (Pierce, CL-XPosure Film). Proteins modified by Trp oxidation products were similarly subjected to Western blotting, except that 12% gels were used and 2 μg of protein/lane was loaded. Immunostaining—HLE-B3 cells (from Dr. Usha Andley, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) (between passages 13 and 19) were cultured in chamber slides with minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. The cells were washed twice with PBS and treated with MEM containing 0 (control), 20, 50, 100, or 200 μm 3OHKYN in the absence of fetal bovine serum for 24 h. The treated cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at –20 °C for 15 min. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at –20 °C for 5 min and then washed five times with PBS to remove the detergent. Next, the slides were blocked with 3% NFDM/1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature and washed twice for 5 min each time with PBS. The slides were incubated with the anti-KLH-3OHKYN antibody (10.3 μg/ml, diluted in 0.1% BSA) or non-immune mouse IgG diluted to the same concentration for 1 h at room temperature and washed twice for 5 min each time. In some experiments, we preincubated the antibody for 1 h at 37 °C with 3OHKYN-modified RNase A (0.2 mg/ml). All slides were incubated with secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG) conjugated with Oregon Green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The secondary antibody was diluted in 0.1% BSA/PBS and applied to the slides for 1 h at room temperature. After this incubation, all slides were washed twice for 5 min with PBS and then developed by incubation for 20 min at room temperature with Texas Red-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) diluted in 0.1% BSA/PBS and washed as described above. Finally, all slides were incubated with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes, diluted in PBS) for 1 min and washed twice for 5 min with PBS. After mounting, the slides were observed with an Olympus System (Model BX60) fluorescence microscope, and images were acquired with an attached digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc. Spot RT Slider) connected to a Macintosh computer using Spot RT Slider software, version 3.5.5. Immunohistochemistry—Cataractous and age-matched normal lenses from donors between the ages of 65 and 70 years were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5-μm sections. Following dehydration, heat-induced epitope retrieval was done in 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0), and the sections were treated with 3.0% hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous peroxidases. The sections were blocked with 1.5% normal horse serum and incubated for 2 h either with the anti-KLH-3OHKYN antibody (10.3 μg/ml) diluted in PBS or with non-immune mouse IgG, diluted to the same protein concentration as the primary antibody. For adsorption experiments, the antibody was preincubated overnight at 4 °C with 3OHKYN-modified RNase A in PBS (0.4 mg/ml). After washing, the slides were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) followed by ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories). They were stained initially with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, counterstained with hematoxylin, and then permanently mounted. Incubation of Nα-Acetyl Tryptophan with Ribated Lysine-Sepharose-4B—To determine whether glycation could catalyze the oxidation of tryptophan, we incubated Nα-acetyl-tryptophan with ribated lysine-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). 1 g of lysine-Sepharose was washed thoroughly with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 1 mm diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid and then incubated at 37 °C for 2 days with 500 mm ribose in the same buffer. The tubes were bubbled with argon for 15 min and sealed before incubation. The ribose-treated gel was extensively washed with PBS to remove unbound ribose. Finally, 250-mg samples of either modified or unmodified (control) gel were incubated at 37 °C with 5.0 mmNα-acetyl tryptophan in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 3, 7, and 10 days. Aliquots were subjected to C18 reversed phase HPLC using a gradient program consisting of solvents A (water with 0.01 m heptafluorobutyric acid) and B (70% acetonitrile in water and 0.01 m heptafluorobutyric acid). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of B from 5 to 50 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and the column effluent was monitored for fluorescence at excitation/emission wavelengths of 290/320 nm. Nα-Acetyl tryptophan eluted at Rt = ∼22 min. We also incubated Nα-acetyl tryptophan during glycation; ribose (6.7 mm), lysine (0.6 mm), arginine (0.6 mm), and Nα-acetyl tryptophan (13.2 mm) were incubated for 5 days at 37 °C in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).

Most TFPI in vivo associates with caveolae in endothelial cells (EC). The mechanism of this association and the anticoagulant role of caveolar TFPI are not yet known. Here we show that expression of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in 293 cells keeps TFPI exposed on the plasmalemma surface, decreases the membrane lateral mobility of TFPI, and increases the TFPI-dependent inhibition of TF-FVIIa. Caveolae-associated TFPI supports the co-localization of the quaternary complex with caveolae. To investigate the significance of these observations for EC we used RNA interference to deplete the cells of Cav-1. Functional assays and fluorescence microscopy revealed that the inhibitory properties of TFPI were diminished in EC lacking Cav-1, apparently through deficient assembly of the quaternary complex. These findings demonstrate that caveolae regulate the inhibition by cell-bound TFPI of the active protease production by the extrinsic pathway of coagulation.

Assembly of TF with factor VIIa (FVIIa) on cell surfaces initiates limited proteolysis of factors IX and X (FX), leading to thrombin generation.

TFPI is a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor, which binds FVIIa via Kunitz-1 and FXa via Kunitz-2. Formation of the TF-FVIIa-FXa-TFPI complex provides sustained repression of the TF pathway (8Broze Jr., G.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Higuchi D.A. Girard J.J. Miletich J.P. Blood. 1988; 71: 335-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TFPI was first described as a soluble plasma protein that binds through its C terminus to yet uncharacterized anionic sites on the cell surface. Nevertheless, the majority of TFPI circulating in plasma is C-terminal truncated and bound to plasma lipoproteins, and as such, has significantly less inhibitory activity than the full-length TFPI (9Nordfang O.

TFPI in vivo is mainly produced by endothelial cells (EC), has an intact C terminus, and associates with the plasma membrane through mechanisms that are not fully identified (3Crawley J. Lupu F.

These findings suggest that cell-bound TFPI, particularly the lipid raft-associated pool, plays a critical role in regulating cell surface FVIIa-TF and FXa activity. Lipid rafts are domains rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids that can exist by themselves or as caveolae. Caveolae are small (50–80 nm) plasma membrane invaginations that have a protein “coat” composed of caveolin family members. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is an integral membrane protein and the principal component of caveolae (19Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). The role of Cav-1 in caveolae formation was confirmed in Cav-1-deficient cells, which lack morphologically identifiable caveolae (20Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30745-30748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of Cav-1 in these cells induces caveolae formation (21Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Caveolae are multifunctional organelles in which Cav-1 plays a direct role in various events, such as membrane trafficking and cellular signal transduction (reviewed in Ref. 22Krajewska W.M. Maslowska I. Cell Mol. Biol. Lett. 2004; 9: 195-220PubMed Google Scholar). We reported previously that TFPI is localized in caveolae in EC both in vitro and in vivo (3Crawley J. Lupu F. Westmuckett A.D. Severs N.J. Kakkar V.V. Lupu C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1362-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10Lupu C. Goodwin C.A. Westmuckett A.D. Emeis J.J. Scully M.F. Kakkar V.V. Lupu F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2964-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The mechanism of TFPI association with caveolae and the anticoagulant role of caveolar TFPI are not yet known. We report here that Cav-1 regulates the distribution and function of TFPI in HEK293, a cell system where we controlled the expression of Cav-1 and TFPI by transfection. We show for the first time that caveolae keep TFPI associated with the cell surface and enhance the anticoagulant activity of the inhibitor. Furthermore, using RNA interference (RNAi) to deplete HUVEC and EA.hy926 cells of Cav-1, we show that EC which lacks Cav-1 displayed several-fold enhanced procoagulant activity. In conclusion, we identified Cav-1 as an active regulator of TFPI-dependent inhibition of TF-FVIIa activity, which adds the hemostatic function as a novel dimension to the biological significance of caveolae.

Res. 1998; 83: 1264-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We transfected 293 cells with pEGFP-C2/TFPI(C), pSVzeo-Cav1-HPC4ep, or co-transfected with both vectors using PolyFect (Qiagen; efficiency ∼50–70%). Parallel assays were run on non-transfected or sham-transfected cells. We selected 293 cell clones that stably expressed EGFP-TFPI, Cav1-HPC4ep, or both chimeras (characterization and selection of the clones detailed under supplemental materials). Freeze-fracture EM—Freeze-fracture EM was performed as described (28Simionescu N. Lupu F. Simionescu M. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1592-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) on wild-type and Cav-1 expressing cells. Proteolytic Activity of Cell Surface TF-FVIIa—Confluent monolayers in 24-well plates were tested with a two-stage chromogenic assay (12Lupu C. Poulsen E. Roquefeuil S. Westmuckett A.D. Kakkar V.V. Lupu F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2251-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16Sevinsky J.R. Rao L.V. Ruf W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). 50 μg/ml cycloheximide was added to prevent de novo protein synthesis. To de-encrypt TF and expose anionic phospholipids the cells were briefly incubated with 1 μm ionomycin. Several concentrations of FVIIa (0.2, 10, or 50 nm) were added for 30 min at room temperature, and then excess FX was added (5, 200, and 500 nm, respectively). Samples were taken during a 30-min incubation time at 37 °C, and quenched in ice-cold 50 mm Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 8.8, containing 25 mm EDTA and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. FXa generated was determined from the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate S-2765. In antibody-blocking experiments, 50 μg/ml anti-TFPI IgG or 100 μg/ml of the anti-TF mAb 5B7 were included during the incubation with FVIIa. Determination of TFPI Activity by Functional Assay—The activity of cell surface TFPI was measured with a modification of a two-stage chromogenic assay in which we estimated the residual capability of TF-FVIIa pre-formed mixtures to activate FX after incubation with TFPI-exposed cells. The original assay (10Lupu C. Goodwin C.A. Westmuckett A.D. Emeis J.J. Scully M.F. Kakkar V.V. Lupu F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2964-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 12Lupu C. Poulsen E. Roquefeuil S. Westmuckett A.D. Kakkar V.V. Lupu F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2251-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) made use of 0.4 nm FVIIa and 1:320 dilution of thromboplastin made from one vial reconstituted with 1 ml of 50 mm TBS, pH 7.35. Here, TF-FVIIa complexes were pre-formed by mixing up several combinations of thromboplastin dilutions and FVIIa concentrations for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 15 mm CaCl2. Each mixture was tested for the linearity and the rates of FXa generation, first in the absence of any TFPI, and then in the presence of serially diluted normal human plasma. Three mixtures containing (nm FVIIa + thromboplastin dilution) 0.2 + 1:700, 10 + 1:15, and 50 + 1:3 were chosen. TFPI-bearing monolayers were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with each pre-formed TF-FVIIa complex, either alone or in the presence of 50 μg/ml anti-TFPI IgG (to block the available TFPI). The supernatants were removed and any unbound TF-FVIIa present was tested for activation of FX (added as 10 times excess over FVIIa) by using S-2765. The activity of TFPI was extrapolated from standard curves constructed with serial dilutions of normal human plasma, which was assigned a TFPI functional potency of 1 unit/ml. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Cell monolayers were scraped in ice-cold 0.1 m TBS, pH 7.8, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3. The cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 and 60 mmn-octyl-β-d-glucopyrannoside in TBS plus inhibitors for 30 min at 37 °C. After brief centrifugation, aliquots of lysates containing 50 μg of total protein were precipitated with 40% trichloroacetic acid on ice and resolved by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE® MES 4–12% polyacrylamide gradient gel, Invitrogen). After electrotransfer, the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked for 1 h with 10% FCS and 0.5% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated for 1 h with primary antibody diluted in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20, washed with 0.3% bovine serum albumin and 3% Tween 20 in PBS, and then incubated for 1 h with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase. The blots were developed with the DAB substrate kit for horseradish peroxidase or Vector Red AP substrate kit I (Vector Labs). Triton X-114 Cell Extraction—Cell monolayers on ice were scraped in ice-cold 0.1 m TBS, pH 8.1, plus inhibitors, and lysed in pre-condensed 1% Triton X-114 in the same buffer by incubating for 1 h on ice with repeated mixing. Debris was removed by centrifugation and phase separation was induced for 5 min at 37 °C, followed by brief centrifugation to separate detergent and aqueous phases. The same buffer lacking detergent was added and the extraction repeated once before the separated phases were assayed or frozen down. In some experiments cells were treated with 1 unit/ml phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (Glyko) for 1 h at room temperature before extraction with Triton X-114. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence was carried out as described (10Lupu C. Goodwin C.A. Westmuckett A.D. Emeis J.J. Scully M.F. Kakkar V.V. Lupu F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2964-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The effect produced by FVIIa/FX on the distribution of TF, TFPI, and Cav-1 was studied in cells fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS (1 h at room temperature) at the end of the FX activation assay. Intracellular immunostaining was achieved on cells permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Images were collected using a Nikon Eclipse inverted microscope equipped with a confocal Nikon C1 system, using a computer-controlled 488-nm argon laser to excite EGFP, and a helium-neon laser whose green line (543-nm) excites Cy3 and red line (633-nm) excites Cy5 or TO-PRO (nuclear stain). Samples mounted with Vectashield (Vector) were observed with a PlanApochromat oil-immersion objective (×60, NA: 1.4). Images were processed using MetaMorph (Universal Imaging). The overlap was quantified using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems), by determining the % of protein A that co-localizes with protein B (29Pelkmans L. Kartenbeck J. Helenius A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). A-channel minus B-channel gave the non-overlapping A elements. Their intensity was subtracted from the total A-channel, and the resulting overlap signal was expressed as mean % of the total signal for each channel. Triple co-localization was analyzed similarly. Fluorescence intensity measurements were performed on a minimum of 50 cells/group, randomly chosen from at least five pictures for each experimental condition. Experiments were repeated three to four times. Statistical significance of the differences between groups was determined by t test (Microsoft Excel), and the differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Descriptive statistics (median values and range) and correlation analysis were performed with InStat (Macintosh). Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP)—For live cell recordings, 293 cells stably expressing EGFP-TFPI, Cav1-HPC4ep, or both, were grown on coverslips and mounted in a perfusion chamber at 37 °C (Bioptech FCS2). The chamber was installed on the stage of the inverted microscope equipped with a temperature controlled ×63 oil immersion objective. The chamber was perfused with phenol red-free culture medium at 37 °C. Bleaching in 3–5 spots in regions of interest was performed at 37 °C with the 488-nm laser line at full power and full transmission for 2 s. Observation of fluorescence recovery over time was done at full laser power and 1% transmission, to avoid significant photobleaching. Image J software (public domain) was used to measure pixel intensities in regions of interest, and to correct for overall bleaching by comparison with areas not exposed to the full power of the laser. The % recovery (recovery values ÷ mean of pre-bleach values × 100) shows how much fluorescence returns to the area out of the amount of fluorescence before photobleaching. Depletion of Cav-1 in EA.hy926 and HUVEC by RNAi—Post-transcriptional silencing of the Cav-1 expression was achieved with two duplex RNA oligonucleotides (Dharmacon Research), each composed of 21 bases of sequence that is conserved in Cav-1 from several mammalian species (30Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8160) Google Scholar). The sense strands of the duplexes were 5′-CCUgAUUgAgAUUCAgUgCdTdT-3′ and 5′-gAgAAgCAAgUgUACgAcgdTdT-3′ (31Nichols B.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). EC were seeded on coverslips to reach ∼60% confluence on the following day. Silencing (si) RNA duplexes (25 nm final concentration) mixed with TransIT-TKO (Mirus) in Opti-MEM I were added to the cells in complete medium without antibiotics. Cells were incubated for 2–3 days and analyzed by confocal microscopy after immunostaining. Controls were as described under supplemental materials. Supplemental Data—Details of the following protocols are available: construction and expression of pEGFP-C2/TFPI(C) and pSVZeo-Cav1-HPC4ep, primers, and conditions for reverse transcriptase-PCR, characterization, and selection of 293 cell clones, and RNAi experimental controls. Fig. S1 demonstrates that EGFP-TFPI has distribution and function similar to natural TFPI, therefore is a reliable marker for endogenous TFPI. Fig. S2 displays immunofluorescence characterization of the chimeras expressed in 293 cells. Fig. S3 details the testing and selection of 293 clones. Results of the RNAi controls are illustrated in Figs. S4 and S5 and demonstrate that the effects induced by Cav-1 siRNA transfection of EC on TFPI distribution and activity are because of the silencing of Cav-1 expression. EGFP-TFPI Is a Reliable Marker for Endogenous TFPI— Using EA.hy926, we compared the expression and activity of EGFP-TFPI (a chimera with EGFP fused at the N terminus of TFPI) with the properties of native TFPI. Western blotting showed a protein with molecular mass ∼65,000 Da immunoreactive with both anti-GFP and anti-TFPI IgGs, which were absent from native (N) and cells expressing EGFP only (GFP) (Fig. S1, A). The distribution and properties of native and chimerical TFPI were similar. Fluorescence imaging showed that 98% of EGFP-TFPI overlapped the anti-TFPI IgG staining (Fig. S1, B, a, d, and e), indicating that the EGFP signal originated from the chimera and not from EGFP alone. Both EGFP-TFPI and native TFPI co-localized with endogenous Cav-1 (b, c, and f). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for TFPI antigen confirmed that EC overexpressing EGFP-TFPI synthesized and secreted two times more TFPI than native cells (Fig. S1, C, a). TFPI-mediated inhibition of exogenously added TF-FVIIa was similarly increased (Fig. S1, C, b). EGFP-TFPI matched the Triton X-114 partition properties of native TFPI, a finding that suggests direct or indirect glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchoring. Enzymatic cleavage of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor with phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (10Lupu C. Goodwin C.A. Westmuckett A.D. Emeis J.J. Scully M.F. Kakkar V.V. Lupu F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2964-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11Ott I. Miyagi Y. Miyazaki K. Heeb M.J. Mueller B.M. Rao L.V. Ruf W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 874-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Zhang J. Piro O. Lu L. Broze Jr., G.J. Circulation. 2003; 108: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) substantially reduced TFPI partitioning into the detergent phase of Triton X-114 (Fig. S1, C, c). Taken together, these data establish that EGFP-TFPI is a valid fluorescent indicator of native TFPI, and can be used to study the distribution and function of TFPI in live as well as in fixed cells. Analysis of the Expression of EGFP-TFPI and Cav1-HPC4ep in 293 Cells—In HEK293 transiently expressing Cav1-HPC4ep (a chimera where the small HPC4 epitope was fused to the C terminus of Cav-1), immunostaining with mAb HPC4 (24Stearns D.J. Kurosawa S. Sims P.J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 826-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed the typical distribution of native Cav-1 (Fig. S2, a–c). In cells expressing EGFP-TFPI 99% of the chimera overlapped the immunolabeled TFPI, showing that no cleaved EGFP was present (Fig. S2, d–f). Co-localization of each protein with its tag exceeded 90% (Fig. S2). Five stable cell clones were selected for each experimental condition. The cell clones were re-named: “TFPI” (express EGFP-TFPI only); “Cav” (cells express Cav1-HPC4ep alone); and “TFPI + Cav” (express both proteins). As detailed in Fig. S3, the total level of TFPI was not significantly different between TFPI cells and TFPI + Cav cells (panel A). Although the constitutive secretion of TFPI was significantly decreased in the presence of Cav-1. The capability of TFPI cells to prevent endogenous TF-dependent FX activation was significantly diminished as compared with TFPI + Cav cells (Fig. S3, B). Native (wild type, wt) cells were also tested, either quiescent or after transfection with pEGFP-C2. There was no significant variation in TFPI distribution or function between these two conditions; therefore we used wt cells in all subsequent experiments. Wt and Cav cells expressed very low levels of TFPI mRNA, whereas TFPI cells and TFPI + Cav cells expressed mRNA for both TFPI and EGFP-TFPI (Fig. 1A, semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR). Lysates of TFPI cells and TFPI + Cav cells displayed a protein band of ∼65 kDa that was immunoreactive with both anti-GFP and anti-TFPI IgGs, but was absent from wt cells (Fig. 1B). Cav cells and TFPI + Cav cell lysates contain a protein that was immunoreactive with anti-Cav-1 IgG (band at ∼20 kDa), present only as trace in lanes “wt” and “T.” The equivalent band appeared in EA.hy926 lysates used as positive control (lane EA). Immunofluorescence confirmed that wt cells contained very low levels of TFPI and Cav-1 (Fig. 1C, a and b), and that EGFP-TFPI largely co-localized with Cav-1 (j-l). Similar to TFPI in EC, EGFP-TFPI in 293 cells partitioned predominantly in the detergent phase of Triton X-114 (Fig. 1D). The equivalent of the 1:3 ratio between the water-soluble and detergent-soluble TFPI normally found in EC was achieved in 293 cells only in the presence of Cav-1 (Fig. 1D). The total amount of TFPI was not significantly different among the TFPI cells and TFPI + Cav cells. Cav-1 Expression in 293 Cells Induces Formation of Caveolae—We used freeze-fracture EM to analyze the formation of invaginations/caveolae in wt and Cav cells. In wt cells (Fig. 2a) the external leaflet of the membrane displayed a smooth aspect, hence lack of caveolae. Cav cells exhibited pits with dimensions and aspect typical of caveolae (Fig. 2b), thus confirming that expression of Cav-1 in deficient cells induced invagination of caveo"
