https://openalex.org/W1983801525,"In rat models of drug relapse and craving, cue-induced cocaine seeking progressively increases after withdrawal from the drug. This 'incubation of cocaine craving' is partially mediated by time-dependent adaptations at glutamatergic synapses in nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, the circuit-level adaptations mediating this plasticity remain elusive. We studied silent synapses, often regarded as immature synapses that express stable NMDA receptors with AMPA receptors being either absent or labile, in the projection from the basolateral amygdala to the NAc in incubation of cocaine craving. Silent synapses were detected in this projection during early withdrawal from cocaine. As the withdrawal period progressed, these silent synapses became unsilenced, a process that involved synaptic insertion of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs). In vivo optogenetic stimulation-induced downregulation of CP-AMPARs at amygdala-to-NAc synapses, which re-silenced some of the previously silent synapses after prolonged withdrawal, decreased incubation of cocaine craving. Our findings indicate that silent synapse-based reorganization of the amygdala-to-NAc projection is critical for persistent cocaine craving and relapse after withdrawal."

Recently, TREM2 variants have been shown to be linked to late onset Alzheimer disease. Here, we demonstrate that TREM2 undergoes sequential proteolytic processing by ectodomain shedding and intramembrane proteolysis. The C-terminal fragment (CTF) of TREM2 generated by ectodomain shedding is cleaved by γ-secretase. Importantly, pharmacologic and genetic γ-secretase inhibition resulted in accumulation of TREM2 CTF at the plasma membrane that also interacts with the signaling adaptor protein DAP12. Thus, the accumulated TREM2 CTF thereby might limit the interaction of DAP12 with the functional full-length receptor, resulting in decreased DAP12 phosphorylation and impaired metabolism of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Together, these data demonstrate γ-secretase-mediated intramembranous proteolysis of TREM2 and functionally link two Alzheimer disease-associated proteins in one signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2049075153,"In this study, two strains of Aspergillus sp. and Lysinibacillus sp. with remarkable abilities to degrade low-density polyethylene (LDPE) were isolated from landfill soils in Tehran using enrichment culture and screening procedures. The biodegradation process was performed for 126 days in soil using UV- and non-UV-irradiated pure LDPE films without pro-oxidant additives in the presence and absence of mixed cultures of selected microorganisms. The process was monitored by measuring the microbial population, the biomass carbon, pH and respiration in the soil, and the mechanical properties of the films. The carbon dioxide measurements in the soil showed that the biodegradation in the un-inoculated treatments were slow and were about 7.6% and 8.6% of the mineralisation measured for the non-UV-irradiated and UV-irradiated LDPE, respectively, after 126 days. In contrast, in the presence of the selected microorganisms, biodegradation was much more efficient and the percentages of biodegradation were 29.5% and 15.8% for the UV-irradiated and non-UV-irradiated films, respectively. The percentage decrease in the carbonyl index was higher for the UV-irradiated LDPE when the biodegradation was performed in soil inoculated with the selected microorganisms. The percentage elongation of the films decreased during the biodegradation process. The Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to determine structural, morphological and surface changes on polyethylene. These analyses showed that the selected microorganisms could modify and colonise both types of polyethylene. This study also confirmed the ability of these isolates to utilise virgin polyethylene without pro-oxidant additives and oxidation pretreatment, as the carbon source."
https://openalex.org/W2006732097,"Proper perception of the extracellular insoluble cellulose is key to initiating the rapid synthesis of cellulases by cellulolytic Trichoderma reesei. Uptake of soluble oligosaccharides derived from cellulose hydrolysis represents a potential point of control in the induced cascade. In this study, we identified a major facilitator superfamily sugar transporter Stp1 capable of transporting cellobiose by reconstructing a cellobiose assimilation system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The absence of Stp1 in T. reesei resulted in differential cellulolytic response to Avicel versus cellobiose. Transcriptional profiling revealed a different expression profile in the Δstp1 strain from that of wild-type strain in response to Avicel and demonstrated that Stp1 somehow repressed induction of the bulk of major cellulase and hemicellulose genes. Two other putative major facilitator superfamily sugar transporters were, however, up-regulated in the profiling. Deletion of one of them identified Crt1 that was required for growth and enzymatic activity on cellulose or lactose, but was not required for growth or hemicellulase activity on xylan. The essential role of Crt1 in cellulase induction did not seem to rely on its transporting activity because the overall uptake of cellobiose or sophorose by T. reesei was not compromised in the absence of Crt1. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that orthologs of Crt1 exist in the genomes of many filamentous ascomycete fungi capable of degrading cellulose. These data thus shed new light on the mechanism by which T. reesei senses and transmits the cellulose signal and offers potential strategies for strain improvement."

MicroRNAs are fundamental post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. The function of the miR-29 (a/b/c) family in cells of the osteoclast lineage is not well understood. In primary cultures of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages, inhibition of miR-29a, -29b, or -29c diminished formation of TRAP (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive) multinucleated osteoclasts, and the osteoclasts were smaller. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that all miR-29 family members increased during osteoclast differentiation, in concert with mRNAs for the osteoclast markers Trap (Acp5) and cathepsin K. Similar regulation was observed in the monocytic cell line RAW264.7. In stably transduced RAW264.7 cell lines expressing an inducible miR-29 competitive inhibitor (sponge construct), miR-29 knockdown impaired osteoclastic commitment and migration of pre-osteoclasts. However, miR-29 knockdown did not affect cell viability, actin ring formation, or apoptosis in mature osteoclasts. To better understand how miR-29 regulates osteoclast function, we validated miR-29 target genes using Luciferase 3′-UTR reporter assays and specific miR-29 inhibitors. We demonstrated that miR-29 negatively regulates RNAs critical for cytoskeletal organization, including Cdc42 (cell division control protein 42) and Srgap2 (SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase-activating protein 2). Moreover, miR-29 targets RNAs associated with the macrophage lineage: Gpr85 (G protein-coupled receptor 85), Nfia (nuclear factor I/A), and Cd93. In addition, Calcr (calcitonin receptor), which regulates osteoclast survival and resorption, is a novel miR-29 target. Thus, miR-29 is a positive regulator of osteoclast formation and targets RNAs important for cytoskeletal organization, commitment, and osteoclast function.

A prenyltransferase enzyme, UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing 1 (UBIAD1), is involved in this conversion. There is evidence that UBIAD1 has a weak side chain cleavage activity for phylloquinone but a strong prenylation activity for menadione (vitamin K3), which has long been postulated as an intermediate in this conversion. Further evidence indicates that when intravenously administered in mice phylloquinone can enter into tissues but is not converted further to menaquinone-4. These findings raise the question whether phylloquinone is absorbed and delivered to tissues in its original form and converted to menaquinone-4 or whether it is converted to menadione in the intestine followed by delivery of menadione to tissues and subsequent conversion to menaquinone-4. To answer this question, we conducted cannulation experiments using stable isotope tracer technology in rats. We confirmed that the second pathway is correct on the basis of structural assignments and measurements of phylloquinone-derived menadione using high resolution MS analysis and a bioassay using recombinant UBIAD1 protein. Furthermore, high resolution MS and 1H NMR analyses of the product generated from the incubation of menadione with recombinant UBIAD1 revealed that the hydroquinone, but not the quinone form of menadione, was an intermediate of the conversion. Taken together, these results provide unequivocal evidence that menadione is a catabolic product of oral phylloquinone and a major source of tissue menaquinone-4.

An enzyme, UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing 1 (UBIAD1), catalyzes this conversion (2Nakagawa K. Hirota Y. Sawada N. Yuge N. Watanabe M. Uchino Y. Okuda N. Shimomura Y. Suhara Y. Okano T.

It has been shown that UBIAD1 has a weak side chain cleavage activity for PK, but it has a strong prenylation activity for vitamin K3 (menadione (MD)). MD has long been postulated as an intermediate or a catabolic product of PK in this conversion process (2Nakagawa K. Hirota Y. Sawada N. Yuge N. Watanabe M. Uchino Y. Okuda N. Shimomura Y. Suhara Y.

UBIAD1 is accordingly believed to generate MK-4 by the prenylation of MD in tissues, although it is not known whether UBIAD1 generates MD from PK in tissues. Thijssen et al. (7Thijssen H.H. Vervoort L.M. Schurgers L.J. Shearer M.J. Menadione is a metabolite of oral vitamin K.Br. J. Nutr. 2006; 95: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) reported that orally administered, but not subcutaneously injected, PK in humans was catabolized to MD and excreted in the form of conjugates in urine. Recently, Al Rajabi et al. (8Al Rajabi A. Booth S.L. Peterson J.W. Choi S.W. Suttie J.W. Shea M.K. Miao B. Grusak M.A. Fu X.

Nutr. 2012; 142: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) reported that deuterium-labeled PK-derived MD existed in the serum and urine of the rats fed a diet containing deuterium-labeled PK. These results suggest that PK generates MD in the course of intestinal absorption. To identify the locations where release of MD from PK occurs and where MD is converted to MK-4, it is necessary to identify PK-derived MD in the mesenteric lymph and/or portal vein of rats who are orally administered PK and to demonstrate a relationship between the concentrations of MD in the lymph and/or portal vein and concentrations of MK-4 in tissues. vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) vitamin K2 (menaquinone-4) UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing 1 vitamin K3 (menadione) inferior vena cava portal vein thoracic lymph duct bile duct recombinant human UBIAD1 geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate atmospheric pressure chemical ionization high resolution. In the present study, we conducted cannulation experiments in rats at four sites, including catheterization into the inferior vena cava (IVC), portal vein (PV), thoracic lymph duct (TLD), and bile duct (BD), to identify and measure deuterium-labeled PK (PK-d7)-derived MD in the lymph and blood of rats orally administered PK-d7. Unlike PK and MK-4, accurate measurement of MD in biological fluids by physicochemical means is difficult because of its high volatility. Thus, we developed a novel method for the measurement of MD (putative MD-d7) using rhUBIAD1 as a source of converting enzyme and deuterium-labeled geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP-d5) as a source of the side chain in the final product (putative MK-4-d12). In this method, MD-d7 in the lymph and serum was converted to MK-4-d12, which was quantitatively detected by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (APCI-LC-MS/MS). We also examined the time course changes in serum PK and MD concentrations after oral administration of PK to healthy adult volunteers. Furthermore, to elucidate the conversion mechanism of PK to MK-4, we sought to identify the chemical structure of the product by high resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) and 1H NMR after incubation of MD-d3 with rhUBIAD1 in the presence of GGPP. Here, we demonstrate unequivocally that tissue MK-4 mainly originated from MD released from oral PK during intestinal absorption and was delivered to tissues through the mesenteric lymphatic system. Furthermore, we were able to observe time course changes in the serum concentrations of PK, MK-4, and MD in healthy adult volunteers orally administered PK that were similar to those observed in rat cannulation experiments. During the geranylgeranylation of MD to MK-4, the hydroquinone, but not the quinone form of MD, was the substrate for UBIAD1. PK and MK-4 were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Deuterium-labeled MD (MD-d3 and MD-d8) were purchased from C/D/N Isotopes Inc. (Quebec, Canada). PK capsules (Kaywan; 20 mg of PK/capsule) were purchased from Eisai Co., Ltd. (Japan).

Culture media and antibiotics were purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Deuterium-labeled chloroform (CDCl3; 99.8%; NMR analytical grade) was obtained from EURISO-TOP (Gif-Sur-Yvette, France). Organic solvents of HPLC grade were purchased from Nacalai Tesque. Forty-two female C57BL/6 mice aged 9 weeks and three male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 8 weeks were obtained from Japan SLC Inc. (Hamamatsu, Japan). They were fed a commercially available normal laboratory chow (F-2 diet, Oriental Yeast Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for 1 week prior to the experiments. The mice were housed in groups of four, whereas the rats were individually housed in stainless steel wire cages with a 12-h light-dark cycle under controlled environmental conditions (temperature, 20 ± 2 °C; humidity, 50 ± 5%). The animals were allowed ad libitum access to diet and water for 1 week prior to the experiments. The protocols for the experiments were approved by the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Kobe Pharmaceutical University. Sixteen male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 8 weeks (body weight, 350–400 g) were obtained from Japan SLC Inc. They were fed a commercially available normal laboratory chow (Labo MR Stock, NOSAN Corp., Yokohama, Japan) for 1 week prior to the experiments. They were individually housed in polypropylene cages with a 12-h light-dark cycle under controlled environmental conditions (temperature, 24 ± 2 °C; humidity, 50 ± 10%) and allowed ad libitum access to diet and water for 1 week prior to experiments.

At 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after oral administration of PK-d7 as a single dose of 10 μmol/kg of body weight, blood was withdrawn by heart puncture under light diethyl ether anesthesia, and plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. Immediately after death, the intestine, liver, and cerebrum were excised, immersed and rinsed in ice-cold saline, and stored at −70 °C until analysis. The tissue concentrations of PK-d7, MK-4-d7, and their respective epoxides were measured as reported previously (1Okano T. Shimomura Y. Yamane M. Suhara Y. Kamao M. Sugiura M. Nakagawa K.

In brief, the tissues were thoroughly pulverized in anhydrous sodium sulfate (1:10, w/v) and transferred into brown glass tubes fitted with a Teflon-lined screw cap. Following the addition of 0.1 ml of ethanol containing [18O]PK and [18O]MK-4 as internal standards, 0.9 ml of ethanol, and 9 ml of acetone, the homogenates were thoroughly mixed using a Vortex mixer for 3 min and allowed to stand for 5 min. This procedure was repeated three times. The resulting mixture was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the upper layer was transferred into small brown glass tubes and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in 2 ml of water and 6 ml of hexane, thoroughly mixed, and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The upper layer was loaded onto a Sep-Pak Vac Silica cartridge column (Waters) and eluted with 5 ml of hexane to remove concomitants. The vitamin K-containing fraction was then eluted with 5 ml of hexane/diethyl ether (97:3). The eluate was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residue was dissolved in 60 μl of methanol. An aliquot of this solution was subjected to APCI-LC-MS/MS. HPLC analyses were performed using a Shimadzu HPLC system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) consisting of a binary pump (LC-10AD liquid chromatograph), automatic solvent degasser (DGU-14A degasser), and autosampler (SIL-10AD autoinjector). Separations were performed on a reversed-phase C18 analytical column (Capcell PAK C18 UG120, 5 μm, 4.6-mm inner diameter × 250 mm; Shiseido, Tokyo, Japan) with a solvent system consisting of isocratic solvent A (25 min) and then a linear gradient from 0 to 50% ethanol (50 min). Solvent A contained methanol, 0.1% acetic acid aqueous (95:5, v/v) and was delivered at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The column was maintained at 35 °C using a column oven (CTO-10AC column oven). The HPLC system was controlled by a SCL-10A System Controller (Shimadzu). Acetic acid functioned as an ion pair reagent during reversed-phase HPLC and facilitated the formation of protonated vitamin K [M + H] in the positive ion mode with APCI. The autosampler was maintained at 25 °C. MS was performed using an API3000-LC-MS/MS system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) equipped with an APCI electrospray interface. All MS data were collected in the positive ion mode. The following settings were used: corona discharge needle voltage, 5.5 kV; vaporizer temperature, 400 °C; sheath gas (high purity nitrogen) pressure, 50 p.s.i.; auxiliary gas, none; and transfer capillary temperature, 220 °C. The electron multiplier voltage was set at 850 eV. Identification and quantification were based on MS/MS using a multiple reaction monitoring mode. The range for the parent scan was 400–500 atomic mass units. Multiple reaction monitoring transitions, collision energy, retention time, and the corresponding segment used for each analyte were as follows: MK-4: precursor ion, m/z 445.4; collision energy, 31 V; product ion(s), m/z 187.2; retention time, 20.8 min; MK-4-epoxide: precursor ion, m/z 461.3; collision energy, 31 V; product ion(s), m/z 161.0; retention time, 14.6 min; MK-4-d7: precursor ion, m/z 452.3; collision energy, 31 V; product ion(s), m/z 194.2; retention time, 19.6 min; MK-4-d7 epoxide: precursor ion, m/z 468.4; collision energy, 31 V; product ion(s), m/z 168.4; retention time, 14.3 min; [18O]MK-4: precursor ion, m/z 449.3; collision energy, 29 V; product ion(s), m/z 191.2; retention time, 20.1 min; PK-d7: precursor ion, m/z 458.5; collision energy, 35 V; product ion(s), m/z 194.3; retention time, 38.3 min; PK-d7 epoxide: precursor ion, m/z 474.5; collision energy, 25 V; product ion(s), m/z 168.3; retention time, 26.7 min; and [18O]PK: precursor ion, m/z 455.4; collision energy, 35 V; product ion(s), m/z 191.3; retention time, 39.0 min. Calibration using internal standardization was performed using linear regression at five different concentrations: 12.5, 50, 200, 800, and 1,600 ng/ml. Immediately after death by exsanguination under light diethyl ether anesthesia, small and large intestinal luminal contents from three male Sprague-Dawley rats were collected and separately combined in amounts of ∼3 and 6 g, respectively, avoiding contamination with intestinal villous cells, and 0.3 g of each was transferred into a tube and suspended in 0.6 ml of Plusgrow II culture medium (pH 7.0). Approximately 0.9 ml of Plusgrow II culture medium alone was used as a control. After addition of 100 μl of a solution containing 218.8 nmol of PK-d7 dissolved in 10% ethanol, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in water, the resulting solution was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and PK-d7, MK-4-d7, and their respective epoxides were measured using the APCI-LC-MS/MS method described above. Cannulation experiments were conducted at The Bio Technical Center, Japan SLC Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). Sixteen Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups of four rats, and each group was used for IVC, PV, TLD, or BD cannulation. All cannulation techniques were based on previous reports (12Yang J. Maarek J.M. Holschneider D.P. In vivo quantitative assessment of catheter patency in rats.Lab.

For IVC, the rats were cannulated through the external jugular vein. The right jugular vein was separated from the surrounding neck musculature, and the cephalad end of the external jugular vein was tied. A polyurethane catheter (outside diameter, 0.64 mm; inside diameter, 0.30 mm; Bio Research Center Corp., Nagoya, Japan) was caudally advanced to 3.5 cm into the superior vena cava close to the right atrium. The catheter was subcutaneously tunneled and exteriorized at the back between the shoulder blades. Except when collecting blood samples, the distal end of the tubing was sealed with a stainless steel plug. For PV, a 0.5–1-cm segment of portal vein was teased free from the mesentery, and the same type of polyurethane catheter (as used in IVC) was inserted into the portal vein by sliding along the underside of the guide needle. The cannula was subcutaneously tunneled and exteriorized at the back between the shoulder blades. For TLD, the thoracic duct was located and separated from the psoas muscle and dorsal aorta. The same type of polyurethane catheter (as used in IVC) was inserted into the thoracic lymph duct. The cannula was exteriorized at the abdomen and inserted into the collection vessel. For BD, the common bile duct was cannulated at both the hepatic and ileal ends using a continuous 20-cm length of tube. The intact bile cannula was exteriorized at the abdomen and inserted into the collection vessel. After these surgical procedures, the rats were monitored until they regained full consciousness. There was a 1-h period of recovery and stabilization with continuous blood, lymph, and bile collection before initiation of the study. In one TLD-cannulated rat, it proved difficult to collect the lymph continuously; therefore, we decided not to use this rat for further cannulation experiments. Thus, there were three rats in the TLD group. After confirming that the cannulated rats had regained full consciousness and stabilization, they were orally administered PK-d7 dissolved in a solution containing 10% ethanol, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in water as a single dose of 10 μmol/kg body of weight. All the cannulated rats were kept in Ballman cages during collection of lymph, blood, and bile samples. Lymph and bile samples were continuously collected at 1-h intervals, and blood samples (200 μl) were collected hourly from the cannulated rats for 1 h before administering PK-d7 (one sample as a control) and for 0–6 h after administering PK-d7 (six samples). Volumes of lymph and bile were then measured. After collection of the samples, whole blood was withdrawn by heart puncture under light diethyl ether anesthesia, and plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. The small intestine, liver, and heart were also excised, immersed and rinsed in ice-cold saline, and stored at −70 °C until analysis. PK-d7, MK-4-d7, and their respective epoxides in the intestine, liver, and heart of the cannulated rats orally administered PK-d7 were measured by APCI-LC-MS/MS as described above. For the serum, lymph, and bile assays, 20–80-μl aliquots were diluted to 500 μl with deionized water, and the measurements were performed using APCI-LC-MS/MS as described for the tissues. PK-d7-derived MD in the serum, lymph, and bile was measured by our novel method. In brief, 20 μl of serum, lymph, or bile was placed in a brown glass tube fitted with a Teflon-lined screw cap followed by the addition of 965 μl of buffered saline containing 1 mm DTT, 10 μl of rhUBIAD1 solution (described in detail later), and 5 μl of a solution containing GGPP-d5 (5 × 10−3 m) and incubation at 37 °C for 3 h. After incubation, the putative reaction product (MK-4-d12) was measured by APCI-LC-MS/MS under the same conditions as described above except for the following different parameters: precursor ion, m/z 457.2; collision energy, 33 V; product ion(s), m/z 194.2; and retention time, 19.5 min. rhUBIAD1 was expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells as described previously (2Nakagawa K. Hirota Y. Sawada N. Yuge N. Watanabe M. Uchino Y. Okuda N. Shimomura Y. Suhara Y. Okano T. Identification of UBIAD1 as a novel human menaquinone-4 biosynthetic enzyme.Nature. 2010; 468: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In brief, cDNA for the UBIAD1 coding region was cloned into pIEx/Bac-1 (Merck) in Sf9 cells using Insect GeneJuiceTM (Merck). A recombinant baculovirus was generated using the BacMagic system (Merck) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sf9 cells were grown at 28 °C in a tissue culture flask in Grace's insect medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS. To achieve the expression of UBIAD1, cell cultures (2 × 106 cells/ml) were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 followed by a 72-h expression period. Microsomes were prepared from the UBIAD1 baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and suspended in a solution containing 0.5% N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid, 0.2% phosphatidylcholine, and 20% glycerol in PBS (pH 7.4) at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. Because MD is sensitive to light, all procedures were performed under dark conditions. Lymph was collected for 3–4 h from the TLD-cannulated rats after administration of PK-d7, and lipids were extracted from a 0.5-ml aliquot using 10 ml of acetone/ethanol (9:1) solution. The lipid extract was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was evaporated under reduced pressure after addition of 50 μl of a 50% ethylene glycol solution for protection against vaporization. The resulting residue was then re-extracted using 8 ml of hexane/water (3:1). After centrifugation, the resulting residue was dissolved in 100 μl of methanol and used for HR-MS analysis. MS was performed on an Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK), which was operated in the positive ion mode. A heated electrospray source was used for analyses at the following settings: sheath gas, 40 arbitrary units; auxiliary gas, 10 arbitrary units; capillary temperature, 325 °C; capillary voltage, 35 V; and spray voltage, 5.0 kV. The instrument was operated in full scan mode from m/z 100 to 1,000 at 100,000 resolving power with a data acquisition rate of 10.0 Hz. The mass spectrometer was mass-calibrated just prior to starting the sequence of injections. Because MK-4 is sensitive to light, all procedures were performed under dark conditions. MD-d3 (2 × 10−4 m) was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h with rhUBIAD1 (10 μg as protein weight of the microsomes prepared from UBIAD1 baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells) in the presence of GGPP (2 × 10−4 m) and DTT (1 mm) in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8). After incubation, the lipids were extracted using 10 ml of acetone/ethanol (9:1) solution. The extract was centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was evaporated under reduced pressure. This procedure was repeated 1,200 times. All residues were then combined and re-extracted using 8 ml of hexane/water (3:1). After centrifugation of the mixture, the hexane layer was loaded onto a Sep-Pak Vac Silica cartridge column, which was prewashed with 10 ml of hexane, and eluted with 5 ml of hexane/diethyl ether (97:3). The eluate was evaporated under reduced pressure, dissolved in 100 μl of methanol, and then purified using a Shimadzu HPLC system consisting of a C-R8A Chromatopac, SPD-20A UV spectrophotometric detector, and LC-20A liquid chromatograph (Shimadzu). Separations were performed using a reversed-phase C18 column (Capcell PAK C18 UG120, 5 μm, 4.6-mm inner diameter × 250 mm; Shiseido) with a mobile phase containing methanol/ethanol (95:5). This mobile phase was passed through the column at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Samples with a peak corresponding to authentic MK-4 were collected, evaporated to dryness, and then redissolved in the mobile phase. After further purification of the combined samples using the same HPLC system, the samples were sufficiently pure for 1H NMR and HR-MS analyses. The residues were redissolved in 2 ml of hexane, evaporated under reduced pressure, and then dissolved in 60 μl of CDCl3 in a nanoprobe for 1H NMR spectrometry. The 500-MHz 1H NMR spectra of authentic MK-4-d3 and the product were measured on a Varian VNS-500 (proton, 500 MHz). After 1H NMR analysis, the sample was evaporated under reduced pressure, dissolved in 100 μl of methanol, and used for HR-MS analysis. MS was performed on an Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), which was operated in the positive ion mode. Blood samples were collected hourly from six healthy adult volunteers (four males and two females; 29–63 years old) for 1 h before a single oral ingestion of PK capsules (two capsules; 40 mg of PK) and for 0–6 h after ingestion of PK. Concentrations of PK, MK-4, and MD in serum were measured using APCI-LC-MS/MS as described above. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Kyoto Women's University, and all participants provided written informed consent. IEC-6 cells were obtained from Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan) and cultured at a density of 5 × 106 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture plates in low glucose DMEM with 10% FCS at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere for 3 days. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with PK-d7 (1 μm) at 37 °C for 24 h. The cells were collected, the lipids were extracted using 3 ml of hexane/diethyl ether (97:3), and the amount of MK-4-d7 and its epoxide was measured using APCI-LC-MS/MS as described above. Following oral administration of PK-d7 as a single dose of 10 μmol/kg of body weight in mice, PK-d7 and its epoxide were found in all tissues examined and exhibited similar tissue time-distribution patterns, although their concentrations varied greatly among the tissues (Fig. 1). Tissue concentrations of PK-d7 and its epoxide reached a maximum at 3 h postadministration and rapidly decreased thereafter in the intestine and liver and gradually in the cerebrum. MK-4-d7 and its epoxide converted from oral PK-d7 were also found i"
https://openalex.org/W2171828768,"It has been reported that Mitofusin2 (Mfn2) inhibits cell proliferation when overexpressed. We wanted to study the role of endogenous Mfn2 in cell proliferation, along with the structural features of Mfn2 that influence its mitochondrial localization and control of cell proliferation. Mfn2-knockdown clones of a B-cell lymphoma cell line BJAB exhibited an increased rate of cell proliferation. A 2-fold increase in cell proliferation was also observed in Mfn2-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells as compared with the control wild-type cells, and the proliferative advantage of the knockout MEF cells was blocked on reintroduction of the Mfn2 gene. Mfn2 exerts its antiproliferative effect by acting as an effector molecule of Ras, resulting in the inhibition of the Ras-Raf-ERK signaling pathway. Furthermore, both the N-terminal (aa 1-264) and the C-terminal (aa 265-757) fragments of Mfn2 blocked cell proliferation through distinct mechanisms: the N-terminal-mediated inhibition was due to its interaction with Raf-1, whereas the C-terminal fragment of Mfn2 inhibited cell proliferation by interacting with Ras. The inhibition of proliferation by the N-terminal fragment was independent of its mitochondrial localization. Collectively, our data provide new insights regarding the role of Mfn2 in controlling cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2072927032,"It has been suggested that posterior insular regions code lower-level sensory information and anterior regions code higher-level stimulus significance relative to the body's homeostatic needs. However, here the authors report that the caudal, but not rostral, insula response to food images was directly related to the body's homeostatic state. Prevailing theories hold that the insula is functionally organized along its caudal-to-rostral axis, with posterior regions coding lower-level sensory information and anterior regions coding higher-level stimulus significance relative to the body's homeostatic needs. Contrary to predictions of this model, the response of the taste-sensitive region of the caudal, but not rostral, insula to food images was directly related to the body's homeostatic state as indexed by levels of peripheral glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1975825616,"Introduction Inflammatory complications following ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis (UC) are common and thought to arise through mechanisms similar to de novo onset inflammatory bowel disease. The aim of this study was to determine whether specific organisms in the tissue-associated microbiota are associated with inflammatory pouch complications. Methods Patients having previously undergone IPAA were recruited from Mount Sinai Hospital. Clinical and demographic information were collected and a pouchoscopy with biopsy of both the pouch and afferent limb was performed. Patients were classified based on post-surgical phenotype into four outcome groups: familial adenomatous polyposis controls (FAP), no pouchitis, pouchitis, and Crohn’s disease-like (CDL). Pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA V1-V3 hypervariable region, and quantitative PCR for bacteria of interest, were used to identify organisms present in the afferent limb and pouch. Associations with outcomes were evaluated using exact and non-parametric tests of significance. Results Analysis at the phylum level indicated that Bacteroidetes were detected significantly less frequently (P<0.0001) in the inflammatory outcome groups (pouchitis and CDL) compared to both FAP and no pouchitis. Conversely, Proteobacteria were detected more frequently in the inflammatory groups (P=0.01). At the genus level, organisms associated with outcome were detected less frequently among the inflammatory groups compared to those without inflammation. Several of these organisms, including Bacteroides (P<0.0001), Parabacteroides (P≤2.2x10-3), Blautia (P≤3.0x10-3) and Sutterella (P≤2.5x10-3), were associated with outcome in both the pouch and afferent limb. These associations remained significant even following adjustment for antibiotic use, smoking, country of birth and gender. Individuals with quiescent disease receiving antibiotic therapy displayed similar reductions in these organisms as those with active pouch inflammation. Conclusions Specific genera are associated with inflammation of the ileal pouch, with a reduction of typically ubiquitous organisms characterizing the inflammatory phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1981787943,"In this study, the authors recorded from the cerebellum while monkeys experienced an illusory perception of self-motion, and found that the neurons encoded the erroneous linear acceleration. Their findings provide evidence that the cerebellum might be involved in the implementation of internal models, as previously hypothesized by theorists. A combination of theory and behavioral findings support a role for internal models in the resolution of sensory ambiguities and sensorimotor processing. Although the cerebellum has been proposed as a candidate for implementation of internal models, concrete evidence from neural responses is lacking. Using unnatural motion stimuli, which induce incorrect self-motion perception and eye movements, we explored the neural correlates of an internal model that has been proposed to compensate for Einstein's equivalence principle and generate neural estimates of linear acceleration and gravity. We found that caudal cerebellar vermis Purkinje cells and cerebellar nuclei neurons selective for actual linear acceleration also encoded erroneous linear acceleration, as would be expected from the internal model hypothesis, even when no actual linear acceleration occurred. These findings provide strong evidence that the cerebellum might be involved in the implementation of internal models that mimic physical principles to interpret sensory signals, as previously hypothesized."

https://openalex.org/W2040571941,"Induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) expression is often implicated in clinically relevant drug-drug interactions (DDI), as metabolism catalyzed by this enzyme is the dominant route of elimination for many drugs. Although several DDI models have been proposed, none have comprehensively considered the effects of enzyme transcription/translation dynamics on induction-based DDI. Rifampicin is a well-known CYP3A4 inducer, and is commonly used as a positive control for evaluating the CYP3A4 induction potential of test compounds. Herein, we report the compilation of in vitro induction data for CYP3A4 by rifampicin in human hepatocytes, and the transcription/translation model developed for this enzyme using an extended least squares method that can account for inherent inter-individual variability. We also developed physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for the CYP3A4 inducer and CYP3A4 substrates. Finally, we demonstrated that rifampicin-induced DDI can be predicted with reasonable accuracy, and that a static model can be used to simulate DDI once the blood concentration of the inducer reaches a steady state following repeated dosing. This dynamic PBPK-based DDI model was implemented on a new multi-hierarchical physiology simulation platform named PhysioDesigner."

It is known that these responses depend on select transcription factors (e.g. OxyR, SoxR, PerR), which are able to specifically sense particular oxidants, often through the oxidation state of conserved cysteine residues. These regulators control the expression of genes that contribute directly to ROS detoxification or to the repair of ROS-mediated damage. The ability of redox-sensitive regulators to distinguish among different oxidants is a key factor in redox signaling (17.Winterbourn C.C. Hampton M.B.

Redox reactions and microbial killing in the neutrophil phagosome.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2013; 18: 642-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). It therefore appears that to successfully combat RCS, organisms require a multifaceted stress response system, regulated by a diverse set of redox-sensitive regulators. Here we report the discovery of RclR (formerly known as YkgD), a highly RCS-specific transcriptional activator in E. coli. In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate that RclR relies on the reversible oxidation of conserved redox-sensitive cysteine residues to control the expression of three genes essential for bacterial survival of reactive chlorine stress (rclA, rclB, and rclC; formerly ykgC, ykgI, and ykgB, respectively). Deletion of any one of these genes, whose RCS-mediated transcriptional up-regulation is among the most pronounced in E. coli, dramatically increases RCS stress sensitivity. These results suggest that we have identified an important member of the RCS stress response system in bacteria.

The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), modified to use only a single primer and 35 cycles of amplification, was used to mutate pRCLR1 with primers [11], [12], [13], or [14] to yield plasmids pRCLR8, pRCLR9, pRCLR14, and pRCLR15, containing rclR alleles encoding RclRC21A, RclRC89A, RclRH42A, and RclRH75A, respectively. The same method was used to mutate pRCLR8 with primer [12], yielding plasmid pRCLR12, containing an rclR allele encoding RclRC21A,C89A. For purification of RclR wild-type and mutant proteins, the rclR sequence was codon-optimized for expression in E. coli (GenScript, Inc.), yielding an rclRopt. allele encoding the wild-type RclR amino acid sequence. The rclRopt. allele was then cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of plasmid pET-15b (Novagen) to yield plasmid pRCLR7. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), modified to use only a single primer and 35 cycles of amplification, was used to mutate pRCLR7 with primer [15], [16], [17], or [18] to yield plasmid pRCLR10, pRCLR11, pRCLR16, or pRCLR17. These plasmids contained rclRopt. alleles encoding RclRC21A, RclRC89A, RclRH42A, and RclRH75A, respectively. HOCl survival assays were performed as described previously (20.Gray M.J. Wholey W.Y.

E. coli was grown in MOPS medium with shaking at 37 °C to an A600 = 0.4–0.5. Then, potential RclR inducers were added as indicated. For plasmid-containing strains, media contained ampicillin and 1 mm arabinose. Samples (0.5 ml) were collected by centrifugation (1 min at 16,100 × g) immediately before and at indicated time points after addition of the respective stressors. RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR analyses were performed as described previously (20.Gray M.J. Wholey W.Y. Parker B.W. Kim M. Jakob U. NemR is a bleach-sensing transcription factor.J. Biol.

Primers used in RT-PCRs were: rrsD, [19] and [20]; rclR, [21] and [22]; rclA, [23] and [24]; rclB, [25] and [26]; rclC, [27] and [28]; nemR, [29] and [30]. Student's t test was used to determine whether the means of log-transformed expression values differed significantly from each other. N-terminally His6-tagged RclR variants were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen). Cultures were grown in LB with shaking at 37 °C to an A600 = 0.6–0.8 and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, then incubated at 20 °C for 20 h. Cultures were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 20 min, resuspended in 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) plus EDTA-free Complete Mini protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by three passages through a French press at 1200 psi. Lysates were spun down for 60 min at 20,000 rpm at 4 °C, passed through a 0.8-μm filter, then applied to a nickel-loaded HiTrap Chelating HP affinity column (GE Healthcare). RclR was purified using an ÄKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) with a 17-column volume linear gradient to 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m imidazole, 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4). Fractions containing pure RclR were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. EMSAs were performed as described previously (20.Gray M.J. Wholey W.Y. Parker B.W. Kim M. Jakob U. NemR is a bleach-sensing transcription factor.J. Biol.

PrclRA, the 225-bp intergenic region between rclA and rclR, was amplified using primers [31] and [32]. PnemR was prepared as described previously (20.Gray M.J. Wholey W.Y. Parker B.W. Kim M. Jakob U.

RclR protein variants were exchanged into 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) using Bio-Spin P-30 (Bio-Rad) gel filtration columns and centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C to remove aggregates. RclR proteins were then incubated with the indicated oxidants at 37 °C for 15 min. To remove the oxidants, RclR was applied to a Bio-Spin P-30 column, equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 10% glycerol (pH 6.8) and centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. PrclRA DNA (0.1 pmol) was incubated with 0–10.0 pmol of RclR protein in 10-μl reactions for 30 min at 37 °C, separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels in Tris borate/EDTA buffer for 90 min at 100 V, and stained with ethidium bromide; band intensity was quantified using ImageJ 1.44o (37.Schneider C.A. Rasband W.S. Eliceiri K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (34981) Google Scholar). Student's t test was used to determine whether mean band intensity values differed significantly from each other. For reduction and re-reduction, samples were incubated in 1 mm DTT at 37 °C for 15 min immediately before incubation with PrclRA. Metal-free reagents were prepared by incubation with 50 mg l−1 Chelex 100 (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cysteine thiols in 8 μm reduced N-chlorotaurine-oxidized or H2O2-oxidized RclR were determined under denaturing conditions (50 mm sodium phosphate, 6 m guanidinium HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.5)) using Ellman's reagent (5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB)) (38.Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Reassessment of Ellman's reagent.Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). For H2O2-oxidized samples, excess H2O2 was removed by addition of 1 unit of bovine catalase (Sigma) and incubation at 37 °C for 15 min before addition of DTNB. Addition of catalase itself resulted in no detectable thiols under these conditions (data not shown). The sulfenic acid-specific probes NBD-chloride and dimedone were used as described previously to examine reduced and N-chlorotaurine-oxidized RclR, RclRC21A, and RclRC89A (39.Poole L.B.

Metal content of purified wild-type RclR was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-high resolution mass spectrometry at the Keck Elemental Geochemistry Laboratory, Department of Geological Sciences (University of Michigan).

This study focused on the actin cytoskeletal rearrangement as a modulator of METH-induced redistribution of tight junction protein occludin in brain endothelial cells. Exposure to METH resulted in a shift of occludin localization from plasma membranes to endosomes. These changes were accompanied by activation of the actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex, which stimulates actin polymerization by promoting actin nucleation. In addition, METH-induced coronin-1b phosphorylation diminishes the inhibitory effect of nonphosphorylated coronin-1b on actin nucleation. Blocking actin nucleation with CK-666, a specific inhibitor of the Arp2/3 complex, protected against METH-induced occludin internalization and increased transendothelial monocyte migration. Importantly, treatment with CK-666 attenuated a decrease in occludin levels in brain microvessels and BBB permeability of METH-injected mice. These findings indicate that actin cytoskeletal dynamics is detrimental to METH-induced BBB dysfunction by increasing internalization of occludin.

https://openalex.org/W2139806108,"A major limitation of exogenous vitamin D3 administration for the treatment of prostate cancer is the marginal, if any, clinical efficacy. We dissected the basis for the resistance to the vitamin D3 antitumor properties and specifically examined the effect of its major catabolic enzyme, CYP24A1, in prostate cancer. Local CYP24A1 expression levels and the effect of selective modulation were analyzed using tissue microarrays from needle core biopsy specimens and xenograft-bearing mouse models. CYP24A1 mRNA was elevated in malignant human prostate tissues compared to benign lesions. High CYP24A1 protein levels were seen in poorly differentiated and highly advanced stages of prostate cancer and correlated with parallel increase in the tumor proliferation rate. The use of CYP24A1 RNAi enhanced the cytostatic effects of vitamin D3 in human prostate cancer cells. Remarkably, subcutaneous and orthotopic xenografts of prostate cancer cells harboring CYP24A1 shRNA resulted in a drastic reduction in tumor volume when mice were subjected to vitamin D3 supplementation. CYP24A1 may be a predictive marker of vitamin D3 clinical efficacy in patients with advanced prostate cancer. For those with up-regulated CYP24A1, combination therapy with RNAi targeting CYP24A1 could be considered to improve clinical responsiveness to vitamin D3."
https://openalex.org/W2030992915,"Although tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has shown efficacy in a phase 2 clinical trial, development of resistance to TRAIL by tumor cells is a major roadblock. We investigated whether azadirone, a limonoidal tetranortriterpene, can sensitize human tumor cells to TRAIL. Results indicate that azadirone sensitized cancer cells to TRAIL. The limonoid induced expression of death receptor (DR) 5 and DR4 but did not affect expression of decoy receptors in cancer cells. The induction of DRs was mediated through activation of ERK and through up-regulation of a transcription factor CCAAT enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) as silencing of these signaling molecules abrogated the effect of azadirone. These effects of azadirone were cancer cell-specific. The CHOP binding site on the DR5 gene was required for induction of DR5 by azadirone. Up-regulation of DRs was mediated through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as ROS scavengers reduced the effect of azadirone on ERK activation, CHOP up-regulation, DR induction, and TRAIL sensitization. The induction of DRs by this limonoid was independent of p53, but sensitization to TRAIL was p53-dependent. The limonoid down-regulated the expression of cell survival proteins and up-regulated the proapoptotic proteins. The combination of azadirone with TRAIL was found to be additive at concentrations lower than IC50, whereas at higher concentrations, the combination was synergistic. Overall, this study indicates that azadirone can sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL through ROS-ERK-CHOP-mediated up-regulation of DR5 and DR4 signaling, down-regulation of cell survival proteins, and up-regulation of proapoptotic proteins.Background: Elimination of TRAIL resistance by therapeutic agents is an attractive strategy for cancer therapy.Results: Azadirone can sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL through up-regulation of DR5 and DR4 signaling, down-regulation of cell survival proteins, and up-regulation of proapoptotic proteins.Conclusion: Azadirone can enhance the efficacy of TRAIL against cancer cells.Significance: Combinations of azadirone and TRAIL are an effective approach for cancer therapy.

In most mammals, the tapasin gene appears to have little sequence diversity and few alleles and is located distal to several classical MHC I loci, so tapasin appears to function in a universal way to assist MHC I peptide loading. In contrast, the chicken tapasin gene is tightly linked to the single dominantly expressed MHC I locus and is highly polymorphic and moderately diverse in sequence. Therefore, tapasin-assisted loading of MHC I in chickens may occur in a haplotype-specific way, via the co-evolution of chicken tapasin and MHC I. Here we demonstrate a mechanistic basis for this co-evolution, revealing differences in the ability of two chicken MHC I alleles to bind and release peptides in the presence or absence of tapasin, where, as in mammals, efficient self-loading is negatively correlated with tapasin-assisted loading. We found that a polymorphic residue in the MHC I α3 domain thought to bind tapasin influenced both tapasin function and intrinsic peptide binding properties. Differences were also evident between the MHC alleles in their interactions with tapasin. Last, we show that a mismatched combination of tapasin and MHC alleles exhibit significantly impaired MHC I maturation in vivo and that polymorphic MHC residues thought to contact tapasin influence maturation efficiency. Collectively, this supports the possibility that tapasin and BF2 proteins have co-evolved, resulting in allele-specific peptide loading in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1967229546,"Metastasis is the leading cause of death in patients with breast, lung, and head and neck cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying metastases in these cancers remain unclear. We found that the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2)-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway is commonly activated in diverse metastatic human cancer cells, leading to up-regulation of a CREB transcription target Fascin-1. We also observed that the protein expression patterns of RSK2 and Fascin-1 correlate in primary human tumor tissue samples from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients. Moreover, knockdown of RSK2 disrupts filopodia formation and bundling in highly invasive cancer cells, leading to attenuated cancer cell invasion in vitro and tumor metastasis in vivo, whereas expression of Fascin-1 significantly rescues these phenotypes. Furthermore, targeting RSK2 with the small molecule RSK inhibitor FMK-MEA effectively attenuated the invasive and metastatic potential of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Taken together, our findings for the first time link RSK2-CREB signaling to filopodia formation and bundling through the up-regulation of Fascin-1, providing a proinvasive and prometastatic advantage to human cancers. Therefore, protein effectors of the RSK2-CREB-Fascin-1 pathway represent promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the clinical prognosis and treatment of metastatic human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2063592404,"The aggregation of Aβ-peptide (Aβ) is widely considered to be the critical step in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Small, soluble Aβ oligomers have been shown to be more neurotoxic than large, insoluble aggregates and fibrils. Recent studies suggest that biometal ions, including Zn(II), may play an important role in the aggregation process. Experimentally determining the details of the binding process is complicated by the kinetic lability of zinc. To study the dynamic nature of the zinc-bound Aβ complexes and the potential mechanisms by which Zn(II) affects Aβ oligomerization we have performed atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Zn(Aβ) and Zn(Aβ)2. The models were based on NMR data and predicted coordination environments from previous density functional theory calculations. When modeled as 4-coordinate covalently bound Zn(Aβ) n complexes (where n = 1 or 2), zinc imposes conformational changes in the surrounding Aβ residues. Moreover, zinc reduces the helix content and increases the random coil content of the full peptide. Although zinc binds at the N-terminus of Aβ, β-sheet formation is observed exclusively at the C-terminus in the Zn(Aβ) and most of the Zn(Aβ)2 complexes. Furthermore, initial binding to zinc promotes the formation of intra-chain salt-bridges, while subsequent dissociation promotes the formation of inter-chain salt-bridges. These results suggest that Zn-binding to Aβ accelerates the aggregation of Aβ by unfolding the helical structure in Aβ peptide and stabilizing the formation of vital salt-bridges within and between Aβ peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2076985358,"During eukaryotic translation, peptides/proteins are created using L-amino acids. However, a D-amino acid-containing peptide (DAACP) can be produced through post-translational modification via an isomerase enzyme. General approaches to identify novel DAACPs and investigate their function, particularly in specific neural circuits, are lacking. This is primarily due to the difficulty in characterizing this modification and due to the limited information on neural circuits in most species. We describe a multipronged approach to overcome these limitations using the sea slug Aplysia californica. Based on bioinformatics and homology to known DAACPs in the land snail Achatina fulica, we targeted two predicted peptides in Aplysia, GFFD, similar to achatin-I (GdFAD versus GFAD, where dF stands for D-phenylalanine), and YAEFLa, identical to fulyal (YdAEFLa versus YAEFLa), using stereoselective analytical methods, i.e. MALDI MS fragmentation analysis and LC-MS/MS. Although YAEFLa in Aplysia was detected only in an all L-form, we found that both GFFD and GdFFD were present in the Aplysia CNS. In situ hybridization and immunolabeling of GFFD/GdFFD-positive neurons and fibers suggested that GFFD/GdFFD might act as an extrinsic modulator of the feeding circuit. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that GdFFD induced robust activity in the feeding circuit and elicited egestive motor patterns. In contrast, the peptide consisting of all L-amino acids, GFFD, was not bioactive. Our data indicate that the modification of an L-amino acid-containing neuropeptide to a DAACP is essential for peptide bioactivity in a motor circuit, and thus it provides a functional significance to this modification."

The limb region 1 (LMBR1) domain containing 1 gene (lmbrd1) encodes the LMBD1 protein that possesses 9 putative transmembrane domains. LMBD1 has been suggested to be involved in the lysosome in aiding the export of cobalamin. In this study, we determined that LMBD1 plays a regulatory role in the plasma membrane. A micro-positron emission tomography analysis showed that a single-allele knock-out of lmbrd1 increased the 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in murine hearts. In addition, the knockdown of lmbrd1 resulted in an up-regulated signaling of the insulin receptor (IR) and its downstream signaling molecule, Akt. Confocal and live total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy showed that LMBD1 co-localized and co-internalized with clathrin and the IR, but not with the transferrin receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2145118300,"Our previous work has shown that Akt3 is required for mitochondrial biogenesis in primary human endothelial cells (ECs) and in Akt3-null mice; Akt3 affects subcellular localization of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1 (PGC-1α), the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. The purpose of this study is to determine the mechanism by which Akt3 controls the subcellular distribution of PGC-1α and to explore the effect on mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover during angiogenesis. Here we use standard biochemical analyses and Akt3-knockdown strategies to show that Akt3 controls the stabilization of chromosome maintenance region-1 (CRM-1), the major nuclear export receptor. Site-directed mutagenesis and association analyses show that PGC-1α nuclear export is CRM-1 dependent. Akt3 knockdown and CRM-1 overexpression cause 3-fold reductions in PGC-1α target gene expression, compared to control levels. Akt3 inhibition causes autophagy, as measured by autophagosome formation, in a CRM-1-dependent, Akt1/mTOR-independent pathway. In vivo, Akt3-null and heterozygous mice show dose-dependent decreases in angiogenesis compared to wild-type littermates (~5- and 2.5-fold decreases, respectively), as assessed by Matrigel plug assays. This correlates with an ~1.5-fold decrease in mitochondrial Cox IV expression. Our studies suggest that Akt3 is a regulator of mitochondrial dynamics in the vasculature via regulation of CRM-1-dependent nuclear export."
https://openalex.org/W2034699053,"All viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) have a conserved structural element termed motif D. Studies of the RdRp from poliovirus (PV) have shown that a conformational change of motif D leads to efficient and faithful nucleotide addition by bringing Lys-359 into the active site where it serves as a general acid. The RdRp of the Sabin I vaccine strain has Thr-362 changed to Ile. Such a drastic change so close to Lys-359 might alter RdRp function and contribute in some way to the attenuated phenotype of Sabin type I. Here we present our characterization of the T362I RdRp.

Using NMR, we show that this change in nucleotide incorporation fidelity correlates with a change in the structural dynamics of motif D. A recombinant PV expressing the T362I RdRp exhibits normal growth properties in cell culture but expresses a mutator phenotype in cells. For example, the T362I-containing PV is more sensitive to the mutagenic activity of ribavirin than wild-type PV. Interestingly, the T362I change was sufficient to cause a statistically significant reduction in viral virulence.

A better understanding of the fidelity determinants of RdRps would thus provide a framework for rational vaccine design.

One particularly noteworthy substitution is the T362I substitution that is encoded by the RdRp from the Sabin type I strain of PV. The T362I substitution may interfere with the structural dynamics of the motif D loop to disrupt RdRp catalytic function and may play a role in the attenuation of the Sabin vaccine. In this article we demonstrate that the T362I substitution lowers RdRp fidelity by altering the conformational dynamics of motif D and other active-site regions for more efficient nucleotide misincorporation. The decrease in RdRp fidelity induced by the T362I substitution likely contributes to the reduced virulence of the strain carrying this genetic change. These studies highlight motif D as a potential, rational target for modifying viral RdRps to produce attenuated viruses for use as vaccine candidates.

Enzyme assays were conducted at 30 °C in reaction buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 60 μm ZnCl2. Immediately before the reaction, RNA oligonucleotides were reannealed, and concentrated RdRps were diluted to the required concentration by reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 60 μm ZnCl2). The volume of enzyme added into any reactions was never above 110 of the total volume. For stopped flow experiments, the RdRp-RNA binary complexes were formed by incubating RdRp (0.5 μm) with sym/sub RNA (0.25 μm duplex) for 2 min at room temperature. Experiments were initiated by rapidly mixing RdRp-RNA binary complexes in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 60 μm ZnCl2 with the equal volume of NTP solution in the same buffer. The utilized RNA templates sym/subU and sym/subUA were substituted with 2-aminopurine and pyrrolo-cytosine at the 5′ side of the template RNA respectively. These fluorescent bases create fluorescence changes to monitor the chain elongation reaction. For 2-aminopurine-modified sym/sub-U RNA, excitation and emission wavelengths were 313 and 370 nm, respectively. For pyrrolo-cytosine-modified sym/sub-UA RNA, the excitation and emission wavelengths were 350 and 450 nm, respectively. For benchtop assays, the RdRp-RNA binary complexes were formed through incubating RdRp (0.5 μm) with RNA (0.25 μm duplex) for 3 min at room temperature followed by 2 min at 30 °C. The RNA template was 32P end-labeled. After initiation, the reaction was quenched by adding an equal volume of quench buffer (50 mm EDTA, 85% formamide, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol). The quenched samples were analyzed by denaturing PAGE, and products were quantitated by phosphorimaging as previously described (40.Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E.

Because there is no structure available for the T362I variant, the initial structural model of T362I RdRp was constructed based on the WT PV RdRp (Protein Data Bank code 1RA6) by substituting Thr-362 with an Ile residue using the TLEAP module of the AMBER package (43.Case D.A.

Initial minimization of the modeled structure was done in multiple steps using SANDER; all subsequent steps of the MD simulation were carried out using PMEMD. The solvated system was heated stepwise from 0 to 300 K with an increment of 50 K over a period of 10 ps under constant volume and temperature conditions (NVT) followed by 200 ps of NVT simulation. Finally, the simulation was switched to constant pressure and temperature dynamics for the remainder of the MD simulation.

Mice were bred and housed in standard ventilated caging for all experiments. Protocols for animal studies were approved by The Pennsylvania State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). All experiments were performed in accordance to guidelines and regulations overseen by the IACUC. Viral stocks were generated in serum-free media and harvested, and genome copies were quantitated by quantitative PCR performed by the Genomics Core Facility of The Pennsylvania State University. 4–6-Week-old outbred (ICR) mice transgenic for the PV receptor (cPVR) were infected with PV at the indicated genome copy by intraperitoneal injection in 3 ml of serum-free media. Mice were observed for 10 days for signs of disease and were euthanized upon showing dual limb paralysis or paralysis such that their ability to obtain food and water was compromised; this was in accordance with approval by the IACUC at The Pennsylvania State University. The T362I substitution as derived from the PV Sabin I vaccine strain is located in the motif D loop of the palm subdomain (Fig. 1A).

This antigen was highly conserved among Apicomplexan parasites, including other Eimeria spp., Toxoplasma, Neospora, and Cryptosporidium. In the present study, we identified the apical cytoskeletal antigen of Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) and further characterized this antigen in C. parvum to assess its potential as a target molecule against cryptosporidiosis. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that the reactivity of 6D-12-G10 with C. parvum sporozoites was similar to those of anti-β- and anti-γ-tubulins antibodies. Immunoelectron microscopy with the 6D-12-G10 mAb detected the antigen both on the sporozoite surface and underneath the inner membrane at the apical region of zoites. The 6D-12-G10 mAb significantly inhibited in vitro host cell invasion by C. parvum.

https://openalex.org/W2052779131,"Diverse, distantly-related eukaryotic lineages have adapted to low-oxygen environments, and possess mitochondrion-related organelles that have lost the capacity to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. A subset of these organelles, hydrogenosomes, has acquired a set of characteristic ATP generation enzymes commonly found in anaerobic bacteria. The recipient of these enzymes could not have survived prior to their acquisition had it not still possessed the electron transport chain present in the ancestral mitochondrion. In the divergence of modern hydrogenosomes from mitochondria, a transitional organelle must therefore have existed that possessed both an electron transport chain and an anaerobic ATP generation pathway. Here, we report a modern analog of this organelle in the habitually aerobic opportunistic pathogen, Acanthamoeba castellanii. This organism possesses a complete set of enzymes comprising a hydrogenosome-like ATP generation pathway, each of which is predicted to be targeted to mitochondria. We have experimentally confirmed the mitochondrial localizations of key components of this pathway using tandem mass spectrometry. This evidence is the first supported by localization and proteome data of a mitochondrion possessing both an electron transport chain and hydrogenosome-like energy metabolism enzymes. Our work provides insight into the first steps that might have occurred in the course of the emergence of modern hydrogenosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1981422886,"Background Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among men. Multiple evidence suggests that a population of tumor-initiating, or cancer stem cells (CSCs) is responsible for cancer development and exceptional drug resistance, representing a highly important therapeutic target. The present study evaluated CSC-specific alterations induced by new-generation taxoid SBT-1214 and a novel polyenolic zinc-binding curcuminoid, CMC2.24, in prostate CSCs. Principal Findings The CD133high/CD44high phenotype was isolated from spontaneously immortalized patient-derived PPT2 cells and highly metastatic PC3MM2 cells. Weekly treatment of the NOD/SCID mice bearing PPT2- and PC3MM3-induced tumors with the SBT-1214 led to dramatic suppression of tumor growth. Four of six PPT2 and 3 of 6 PC3MM2 tumors have shown the absence of viable cells in residual tumors. In vitro, SBT-1214 (100nM-1µM; for 72 hr) induced about 60% cell death in CD133high/CD44+/high cells cultured on collagen I in stem cell medium (in contrast, the same doses of paclitaxel increased proliferation of these cells). The cytotoxic effects were increased when SBT-1214 was combined with the CMC2.24. A stem cell-specific PCR array assay revealed that this drug combination mediated massive inhibition of multiple constitutively up-regulated stem cell-related genes, including key pluripotency transcription factors. Importantly, this drug combination induced expression of p21 and p53, which were absent in CD133high/CD44high cells. Viable cells that survived this treatment regimen were no longer able to induce secondary spheroids, exhibited significant morphological abnormalities and died in 2-5 days. Conclusions We report here that the SBT-1214 alone, or in combination with CMC2.24, possesses significant activity against prostate CD133high/CD44+/high tumor-initiating cells. This drug combination efficiently inhibits expression of the majority of stem cell-related genes and pluripotency transcription factors. In addition, it induces a previously absent expression of p21 and p53 (“gene wake-up”), which can potentially reverse drug resistance by increasing sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs."

We selected two genes (VGF and PGP9.5) for further QMSP analysis in a larger independent validation (IV) set with available clinical data. Biologic relevance of VGF gene was also evaluated.PH frequency for PGP9.5 and VGF were 85% (316/372) and 43% (158/366) respectively in the IV set of samples while no PH was observed in controls. In 372 OC cases with available follow up, PGP9.5 and VGF PH were correlated with better patient survival [Hazard Ratios (HR) for overall survival (OS) were 0.59 (95% Confidence Intervals (CI) = 0.42-0.84, p = 0.004), and 0.73 (95%CI = 0.55-0.97, p = 0.028) respectively, and for disease specific survival (DSS) were 0.57 (95%CI 0.39-0.82, p = 0.003) and 0.72 (95%CI 0.54-0.96, p = 0.027). In multivariate analysis, VGF PH remained an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR 0.61, 95%CI 0.43-0.86, p<0.005) and DSS (HR 0.58, 95%CI 0.41-0.83, p<0.003). Furthermore, PGP9.5 PH was significantly correlated with lower grade, early stage tumors, and with absence of residual disease. Forced expression of VGF in OC cell lines inhibited cell growth.Our results indicate that VGF and PGP9.5 PH are potential biomarkers for ovarian carcinoma. Confirmatory cohorts with longitudinal follow-up are required in future studies to define the clinical impact of VGF and PGP9.5 PH before clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W2026596636,"Cellobiohydrolases (CBHs) are typically major components of natural enzyme cocktails for biomass degradation. Their active sites are enclosed in a tunnel, enabling processive hydrolysis of cellulose chains. Glycoside hydrolase Family 6 (GH6) CBHs act from nonreducing ends by an inverting mechanism and are present in many cellulolytic fungi and bacteria. The bacterial Thermobifida fusca Cel6B (TfuCel6B) exhibits a longer and more enclosed active site tunnel than its fungal counterparts. Here, we determine the structures of two TfuCel6B mutants co-crystallized with cellobiose, D274A (catalytic acid), and the double mutant D226A/S232A, which targets the putative catalytic base and a conserved serine that binds the nucleophilic water. The ligand binding and the structure of the active site are retained when compared with the wild type structure, supporting the hypothesis that these residues are directly involved in catalysis. One structure exhibits crystallographic waters that enable construction of a model of the α-anomer product after hydrolysis. Interestingly, the product sites of TfuCel6B are completely enclosed by an ""exit loop"" not present in fungal GH6 CBHs and by an extended ""bottom loop"". From the structures, we hypothesize that either of the loops enclosing the product subsites in the TfuCel6B active site tunnel must open substantially for product release. With simulation, we demonstrate that both loops can readily open to allow product release with equal probability in solution or when the enzyme is engaged on cellulose. Overall, this study reveals new structural details of GH6 CBHs likely important for functional differences among enzymes from this important family."
https://openalex.org/W2092454807,"In the HPTN 052 study, transmission between HIV-discordant couples was reduced by 96% when the HIV-infected partner received suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). We examined two transmission events where the newly infected partner was diagnosed after the HIV-infected partner (index) initiated therapy. We evaluated the sequence complexity of the viral populations and antibody reactivity in the newly infected partner to estimate the dates of transmission to the newly infected partners. In both cases, transmission most likely occurred significantly before HIV-1 diagnosis of the newly infected partner, and either just before the initiation of therapy or before viral replication was adequately suppressed by therapy of the index. This study further strengthens the conclusion about the efficacy of blocking transmission by treating the infected partner of discordant couples. However, this study does not rule out the potential for HIV-1 transmission to occur shortly after initiation of ART, and this should be recognized when antiretroviral therapy is used for HIV-1 prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2070098827,"The Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein (SCF) complex is one of the most well characterized types of ubiquitin ligase (E3), with the E3 activity of the complex being regulated in part at the level of complex formation. Fbxl3 is an F-box protein that is responsible for the ubiquitylation and consequent degradation of cryptochromes (Crys) and thus regulates oscillation of the circadian clock. Here we show that formation of the SCF(Fbxl3) complex is regulated by substrate binding in vivo. Fbxl3 did not associate with Skp1 and Cul1 to a substantial extent in transfected mammalian cells. Unexpectedly, however, formation of the SCF(Fbxl3) complex was markedly promoted by forced expression of its substrate Cry1 in these cells. A mutant form of Fbxl3 that does not bind to Cry1 was unable to form an SCF complex, suggesting that interaction of Cry1 with Fbxl3 is essential for formation of SCF(Fbxl3). In contrast, recombinant Fbxl3 associated with recombinant Skp1 and Cul1 in vitro even in the absence of recombinant Cry1. Domain-swap analysis revealed that the COOH-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain of Fbxl3 attenuates the interaction of Skp1, suggesting that a yet unknown protein associated with the COOH-terminal domain of Fbxl3 and inhibited SCF complex formation. Our results thus provide important insight into the regulation of both SCF ubiquitin ligase activity and circadian rhythmicity."

https://openalex.org/W2122526288,"Transcription factor doses are of importance for normal and malignant B-lymphocyte development; however, the understanding of underlying mechanisms and functional consequences of reduced transcription factor levels is limited. We have analyzed progenitor and B-lineage compartments in mice carrying heterozygote mutations in the E2a, Ebf1, or Pax5 gene. Although lymphoid progenitors from Ebf1 or Pax5 heterozygote mice were specified and lineage-restricted in a manner comparable with Wt progenitors, this process was severely impaired in E2a heterozygote mutant mice. This defect was not significantly enhanced upon combined deletion of E2a with Ebf1 or Pax5. Analysis of the pre-B-cell compartment in Ebf1 heterozygote mice revealed a reduction in cell numbers. These cells expressed Pax5 and other B-lineage-associated genes, and global gene expression analysis suggested that the reduction of the pre-B-cell compartment was a result of impaired pre-B-cell expansion. This idea was supported by a reduction in IL2Rα-expressing late pre-B-cells as well as by cell cycle analysis and by the finding that the complexity of the VDJ rearrangement patterns was comparable in Wt and Ebf1+/− pre-B-cells, although the number of progenitors was reduced. Heterozygote deletion of Ebf1 resulted in impaired response to IL7 in vitro and reduced expression levels of pre-BCR on the cell surface, providing possible explanations for the observed stage-specific reduction in cellular expansion. Thus, transcription factor doses are critical for specification as well as expansion of B-lymphoid progenitors, providing increased insight into the molecular regulation of B-cell development.

This idea was supported by a reduction in IL2Rα-expressing late pre-B-cells as well as by cell cycle analysis and by the finding that the complexity of the VDJ rearrangement patterns was comparable in Wt and Ebf1+/− pre-B-cells, although the number of progenitors was reduced. Heterozygote deletion of Ebf1 resulted in impaired response to IL7 in vitro and reduced expression levels of pre-BCR on the cell surface, providing possible explanations for the observed stage-specific reduction in cellular expansion. Thus, transcription factor doses are critical for specification as well as expansion of B-lymphoid progenitors, providing increased insight into the molecular regulation of B-cell development. The development of mature B-lymphocytes from multipotent progenitors in the bone marrow (BM) 2The abbreviations used are: BMbone marrow7-AAD7-aminoactinomycin DNKnatural killerLMPPlymphoid-primed multipotent progenitorCLPcommon lymphoid progenitors. depends on an orchestrated transcription factor network.

The formation of the earliest B-cell committed progenitors is dependent on the transcription factor EBF1 (5Lin H. Grosschedl R.

Commitment to B-lineage development is associated with the expression of the transcription factor PAX5, known to be of critical importance for restriction of alternative cell fates (11Xie H. Ye M.

Busslinger M. Commitment to the B-lymphoid lineage depends on the transcription factor Pax5.Nature. 1999; 401: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to what is observed in the absence of EBF1 and E2A proteins, lack of PAX5 has a modest effect on the transcription of B-lineage genes in the earliest progenitors (14Urbánek P.

Although the role of lineage specific transcription factor networks in development has been rather well established, the direct link between these regulatory cues and human leukemia is now becoming an area of intense investigation. This is because detailed mapping of genetic changes in human B-cell malignancies has revealed that mutations in genes encoding key regulatory proteins, such as PAX5, EBF1, and E2a encoded proteins, can be found in a large fraction of the pediatric B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (17Mullighan C.G. Goorha S. Radtke I. Miller C.B. Coustan-Smith E. Dalton J.D. Girtman K. Mathew S. Ma J. Pounds S.B. Su X. Pui C.H. Relling M.V. Evans W.E. Shurtleff S.A. Downing J.R. Genome-wide analysis of genetic alterations in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.Nature. 2007; 446: 758-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). These mutations appear to be heterozygous, and thus it has been suggested that the impact of these mutations depends on a reduction of functional transcription factor dose, an idea supported by the finding that leukemia formation is enhanced in mice expressing a constitutively active STAT5 protein in combination with the loss of one functional allele of either Pax5 or Ebf1 (18Heltemes-Harris L.M. Willette M.J. Ramsey L.B. Qiu Y.H. Neeley E.S. Zhang N. Thomas D.A. Koeuth T. Baechler E.C. Kornblau S.M. Farrar M.A. Ebf1 or Pax5 haploinsufficiency synergizes with STAT5 activation to initiate acute lymphoblastic leukemia.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 1135-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Furthermore, low levels of PAX5 expression in hematopoietic progenitors result in an expansion of cells expressing a combination of myeloid and lymphoid genes similar to what can be observed in biphenotypic leukemia (19Simmons S. Knoll M. Drewell C. Wolf I. Mollenkopf H.J. Bouquet C. Melchers F. Biphenotypic B-lymphoid/myeloid cells expressing low levels of Pax5. Potential targets of BAL development.Blood. 2012; 120: 3688-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Functional transcription factor dose is also of crucial importance in normal B-cell development, where reduced levels of E-proteins (E2A, HEB, and E2-2) (20Zhuang Y. Cheng P. Weintraub H. B-lymphocyte development is regulated by the combined dosage of three basic helix-loop-helix genes, E2AE2-2HEB.Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) or loss of one allele of Ebf1 alone or in combination with E2a or Runx1 results in disturbed B-cell development (5Lin H. Grosschedl R. Failure of B-cell differentiation in mice lacking the transcription factor EBF.Nature. 1995; 376: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 21Lukin K. Fields S. Lopez D.

Hence, transcription factor dose is of critical importance for malignant transformation in leukemia as well as normal B-cell differentiation, creating a link between development and disease. We here report an analysis of B-cell development in mice carrying heterozygote mutations in critical transcription factors. Although E2a gene dosage is important for B-cell specification, the loss of one allele of Ebf1 instead appears to be of importance for the normal expansion of already committed progenitor cells. We believe that our findings have implications not only for normal B-cell development but also for the molecular understanding of leukemia formation. Pax5+/− (14Urbánek P. Wang Z.Q. Fetka I.

Bone marrows and spleens were harvested from mice aged 7–13 weeks. Adoptive transfers were performed as described previously (16Zandi S. Ahsberg J. Tsapogas P. Stjernberg J. Qian H. Sigvardsson M.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 15871-15876Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Animal procedures were performed with consent from the local ethics committee at Linköping University (Linköping, Sweden). For analysis and cell sorting of progenitor bone marrow cells, CD16/CD32 (FC)-blocked (Clone 93, eBioscience) cells were stained with antibodies against lineage markers CD11b (M1/70), GR1 (RB6-8C5), TER119 (Ter119), CD3 (17A2, BD Pharmingen), CD11c (N418), NK1.1 (PK136), CD19 (1D3), and CD45R/B220 (RA3-6B2). Further staining with KIT (2B8), SCA-1 (E13-161.7), IL7R (A7R34), FLT3 (A2F10), Ly6D (49-H4, BD Pharmingen), and propidium iodide (Invitrogen). All antibodies were purchased from BioLegend unless stated otherwise. For progenitor isolation, bone marrow cells were subjected to magnet-activated cell sorting column enrichment of KIT+ cells using anti-CD117 immunomagnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec) prior to antibody staining. Analysis and cell sorting were performed on a BD FACSAriaTM cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Gates were set according to fluorescence minus one controls. For population analysis, equal cell numbers of FC-blocked cells were stained with the following antibody combinations: progenitors, as stated above without column enrichment; B-cells, lineage markers CD11b (M1/70), GR1 (RB6–8C5), TER119 (Ter119), CD3 (17A2), CD11c (N418), and NK1.1 (PK136) and further with CD19 (ID3), CD45R/B220 (RA3–6B2), CD43 (S7), IgM (RMM-1), and IgD (11-26, eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Dead cells were excluded with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD; Sigma), and analysis was performed with a BD FACSCantoII analyzer (BD Biosciences). Cells stained for lineage, CD19, CD43, IL2Rα (CD25), and IgM were fixated and permeabilized with the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences) and further stained with Ki-67 antibody (BD Biosciences) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen). Gates for Ki-67 staining were based on isotype control antibody. All gates were set according to fluorescence minus one controls. Analysis was performed on a FACS Aria Special Order SystemTM (BD Biosciences). For evaluation of NK- and T-cell potential, cells were deposited (using FACSAria) directly into 96-well plates containing preplated (2000 cells/well) stroma cells. T-cultures (on OP9Delta stroma layers) were supplemented with 10 ng/ml KIT ligand, 10 ng/ml Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L), and 10 ng/ml interleukin-7. NK cultures (on OP9 stroma layers) were supplemented with the same cytokines as the OP9Delta cultures, with the addition of 20 ng/ml interleukin-15 and 40 ng/ml interleukin-2. All cytokines were acquired from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Cultures were substituted with fresh cytokines after 7 days. OptiMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 25 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml Gentamicin, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol was used for maintaining the OP9/OP9Delta stroma cell lines (26Schmitt T.M.

Cocultures were evaluated by FACS staining with CD19 (ID3), NK1.1 (PK136), CD11c (N418), and 7-AAD for NK OP9 cocultures and CD19 (ID3), CD90.2/Thy1.2 (53-2.1), CD3 (17A2), and 7-AAD for T OP9Delta cocultures. All cocultures were analyzed at day 14 with a BD FACSCantoII analyzer (BD Biosciences). We have modified a previously described method to evaluate myeloid potential (27Mansson R. Zandi S. Anderson K.

In brief, cells were directly sorted to a concentration of 1 cell/20 μl of medium OptiMEM (supplemented as above) and 25 ng/ml KIT ligand, 25 ng/ml FLT3L, 25 ng/ml murine thrombopoietin/megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor, 10 ng/ml interleukin-3, 25 ng/ml murine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and 25 ng/ml murine granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and 20 μl of cell suspension were plated into each well (Nunc Minitrays). Wells were scored after 5 days (using an inverted light microscope) to estimate clonal growth and clone size. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of sorted cells was performed as described previously (27Mansson R. Zandi S. Anderson K. Martensson I.L. Jacobsen S.E. Bryder D. Sigvardsson M.

Primers 1 and 4 constitute the outer primer pair, whereas primers 2 and 3 constitute the inner nested primer pair. Cells were sorted directly to RLT buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol, and RNA was extracted from purified adult BM subsets as described previously (28Åhsberg J. Tsapogas P. Qian H. Zetterblad J. Zandi S.

RNA was labeled and amplified according to the AffymetrixTM GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual and hybridized against Affymetrix gene expression array chip mouse genome 430 2.0. Chips were scanned using a GeneChipTM Scanner 3000 (GEO accession no. GSE51385). Probe level expression values were calculated using RMAexpress, and further analysis was done using dChip (29Li C.

Amplification of rearranged DNA segments was based on the use of degenerated heavy chain variable segment (VH-gene) family primers (30Schlissel M.S. Corcoran L.M. Baltimore D. Virus-transformed pre-B cells show ordered activation but not inactivation of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and transcription.J. Exp.

The sorted cells (total number of CD43low/negIgM− pre-B-cells from one femur) were lysed and transferred directly to the PCR, at a density of 50,000 cells/50 μl of PCR. After the primary PCR of 15 cycles using biotinylated J-primers, the products were purified on streptavidin-coated beads, and the obtained products were then subjected to a second PCR using the same heavy chain variable segment but nested J-primers at a density of 200,000 input cells/50 μl of PCR (pooled from the primary PCR). The secondary PCRs were pooled and gel-purified and used for construction of single indexed libraries for high throughput sequencing analysis, using an Illumina True Seq kit. Sequencing was performed using a MiSeq benchtop sequencer and a 500-cycle kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Biotinylated Primers were as follows: J4AS1, AGACCTGGAGAGGCCATTCTTACC; J3AS1, GAATGGGAGAAGTTAGGACTCACC; J2AS1, GAATAGAAGAGAGAGGTTGTAAGG; J1AS1, CAGCTTACCTGAGGAGACGGTGACC.

The script used for data analysis is distributed upon request. For the generation of tamoxifen-inducible cell lines, Ebf1-deficient BM cells (5Lin H. Grosschedl R. Failure of B-cell differentiation in mice lacking the transcription factor EBF.Nature. 1995; 376: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) were transduced with retroviruses encoding either an EBF1-estrogen receptor fusion protein (EBF1-ER) (31Gao H.

The transduced progenitors were expanded in tamoxifen (0.5 μm)-supplemented medium as CD19+ cells on OP9 stroma cells. In order to understand the developmental disruptions observed in mice carrying heterozygote mutations in crucial B-lineage transcription factors, we analyzed the formation of early progenitors in Pax5+/−, E2a+/−, and Ebf1+/− as well as in Ebf1+/−E2a+/− transheterozygote mice. We were unable to detect any significant impact of heterozygote loss of either Pax5, E2a, or Ebf1 on the earliest lineage negative Lin−SCA-1highKIThigh (LSK) cells (Fig. 1A), whereas we confirmed an important role for E2a dose in the formation of the FLT3highLSK, lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor (LMPP) compartment (32Dias S.

The relative frequency of Ly6D+ cells was not significantly changed in E2a+/− mice; however, the loss of one allele of Ebf1 resulted in an increase of this population (Fig. 1B). In order to investigate the impact of transcription factor dose on early B-lymphoid progenitors, we analyzed the pro-B-cell (Lin−B220+CD19+CD43highIgM−) compartment in mice carrying heterozygote mutations in the Ebf1 and/or E2a genes (Fig. 2A). Although this population was comparable with Wt in mice lacking one allele of Ebf1 (Ebf1+/−), it was reduced in mice lacking one allele of E2a (E2a+/−). Mice carrying combined heterozygote mutations of the E2a and either the Ebf1 or Pax5 (Pax5+/−) genes did not display any reduction in cell numbers as compared with E2a+/− mice. The reduction of pro-B-cell numbers in the E2a+/− mice suggested that reduced E2a dose results in a developmental disruption at an early progenitor stage, before the expression of CD19 on the cell surface. Within the Ly6D+ compartment, it is possible to detect cells with an activated B-lineage transcriptional program reflected in the expression of the surrogate light chain gene Lambda5 (λ5, Igll1) (27Mansson R.

https://openalex.org/W2029355070,"Fibril formation of β2-microglobulin and associated inflammation occur in patients on long term dialysis. We show that the plasma protein haptoglobin prevents the fatty acid-promoted de novo fibril formation of β2-microglobulin even at substoichiometric concentration. The fibrils are cytotoxic, and haptoglobin abolishes the cytotoxicity by preventing fibril formation. Haptoglobin does not alleviate the cytotoxicity of preformed fibrils. Fibrillar β2-microglobulin is resistant to lysosomal degradation. However, the species of β2-microglobulin populated in the presence of haptoglobin is susceptible to degradation. We observed that haptoglobin interacts with oligomeric prefibrillar species of β2-microglobulin but not with monomeric or fibrillar β2-microglobulin that may underlie the molecular mechanism. 1,1'-Bis(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5'-disulfonic acid cross-linking to haptoglobin significantly compromises its chaperone activity, suggesting the involvement of hydrophobic surfaces. Haptoglobin is an acute phase protein whose level increases severalfold during inflammation, where local acidosis can occur. Our data show that haptoglobin prevents fibril formation of β2-microglobulin under conditions of physiological acidosis (between pH 5.5 and 6.5) but with relatively decreased efficiency. However, compromise in its chaperone activity under these conditions is more than compensated by its increased level of expression under inflammation. Erythrolysis is known to release hemoglobin into the plasma. Haptoglobin forms a 1:1 (mol/mol) complex with hemoglobin. This complex, like haptoglobin, interacts with the prefibrillar species of β2-microglobulin, preventing its fibril formation and the associated cytotoxicity and resistance to intracellular degradation. Thus, our study demonstrates that haptoglobin is a potential extracellular chaperone for β2-microglobulin even in moderately acidic conditions relevant during inflammation, with promising therapeutic implications in β2-microglobulin amyloid-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2134839440,"The abundance of high-dimensional measurements in the form of gene expression and mass spectroscopy calls for models to elucidate the underlying biological system. For widely studied organisms like yeast, it is possible to incorporate prior knowledge from a variety of databases, an approach used in several recent studies. However if such information is not available for a particular organism these methods fall short. In this paper we propose a statistical method that is applicable to a dataset consisting of Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS) and gene expression (DNA microarray) measurements from the same samples, to identify genes controlling the production of metabolites. Due to the high dimensionality of both LC-MS and DNA microarray data, dimension reduction and variable selection are key elements of the analysis. Our proposed approach starts by identifying the basis functions (“building blocks”) that constitute the output from a mass spectrometry experiment. Subsequently, the weights of these basis functions are related to the observations from the corresponding gene expression data in order to identify which genes are associated with specific patterns seen in the metabolite data. The modeling framework is extremely flexible as well as computationally fast and can accommodate treatment effects and other variables related to the experimental design. We demonstrate that within the proposed framework, genes regulating the production of specific metabolites can be identified correctly unless the variation in the noise is more than twice that of the signal."

Their apoptotic activities have been suggested to be associated with the up-regulation of molecules implicated in pro-apoptotic cascades such as p53, p21Waf1, and p27Kip1. Moreover, the blocking of NF-κB nuclear translocation via the stabilization of IκB is an important mechanism of PI-induced apoptosis. However, we found that long-term incubation with PIs (PS-341 or MG132) increased NF-κB-regulated gene expression such as COX-2, cIAP2, XIAP, and IL-8 in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which was mediated by phosphorylation of IκBα and its subsequent degradation via the alternative route, lysosome.

https://openalex.org/W1984872700,"The hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN) channels are pacemaker channels whose currents contribute to rhythmic activity in the heart and brain. HCN channels open in response to hyperpolarizing voltages, and the binding of cAMP to their cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) facilitates channel opening. Here, we report that, like cAMP, the flavonoid fisetin potentiates HCN2 channel gating. Fisetin sped HCN2 activation and shifted the conductance-voltage relationship to more depolarizing potentials with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 1.8 μM. When applied together, fisetin and cAMP regulated HCN2 gating in a nonadditive fashion. Fisetin did not potentiate HCN2 channels lacking their CNBD, and two independent fluorescence-based binding assays reported that fisetin bound to the purified CNBD. These data suggest that the CNBD mediates the fisetin potentiation of HCN2 channels. Moreover, binding assays suggest that fisetin and cAMP partially compete for binding to the CNBD. NMR experiments demonstrated that fisetin binds within the cAMP-binding pocket, interacting with some of the same residues as cAMP. Together, these data indicate that fisetin is a partial agonist for HCN2 channels."

Apoptosis is triggered either by intrinsic signaling pathways that depend on release of pro-apoptotic factors from the mitochondria in response to various cellular stresses or through binding of extracellular ligands to death receptors on the cell surface. These ligands include the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), 4The abbreviations used are: TRAILTNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligandTRAIL-RTRAIL receptorFADDFas-associated death domainDISCdeath-inducing signaling complexEGFREGF receptorPEphycoerythrin. a member of the TNF superfamily that initiates apoptosis by activating two cognate receptors, TRAIL-R1 (DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (DR5). Due to the unique ability of TRAIL to trigger apoptosis in various types of cancer cells while sparing normal cells, therapeutic agonistic agents are being evaluated in clinical trials. Innate or acquired resistance has, however, hampered clinical success; hence, understanding what determines TRAIL receptor signaling outcome and mechanisms of TRAIL resistance is of vital importance for developing effective therapeutics. One proposed mechanism of TRAIL resistance is constitutive endocytosis and subsequent reduced surface expression of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2, which has been reported to reduce TRAIL sensitivity in breast and colon cancers (1Gonzalvez F.

We here show for the first time that the Ack1 tyrosine kinase is a key regulator of TRAIL receptor membrane compartmentalization that promotes TRAIL-induced receptor accumulation in lipid rafts and activation of pro-apoptotic signaling. MCF10A cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 5% horse serum (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml EGF, 0.5 mg/ml hydrocortisone, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin and 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma). HeLa and HEK-293 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. NCI-H460 cells were cultured in RPMI 1460 medium with 10% FBS. EGF and FITC-conjugated annexin V (Miltenyi Biotech), nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen), HybondTM-P PVDF (Millipore), HaltTM phosphatase/protease inhibitor and Streptavidin Plus UltraLink resin (Pierce), and lapatinib (LC Laboratories) were obtained from the indicated manufacturers. All other reagents were from Sigma. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-Ack1 (clone A11, sc-28336, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-phospho-Ack1 (Tyr-284, 09-142, Millipore); anti-caspase-8 (clone 1-1-37, MAB4708, Millipore); anti-caveolin-1 (610406, BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-α-tubulin (homemade); and anti-caspase-3 (9662), anti-cleaved caspase-8 (Asp-391, 9496), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp-175, 9661), anti-FADD (2782), anti-GAPDH, and anti-phospho-EGFR (Tyr-1068, 2234) (Cell Signaling Technology). Anti-TRAIL-R1 (1139) and anti-TRAIL-R2 (2019) (ProSci Inc.); phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-TRAIL-R1 (clone DJR1), PE-conjugated anti-TRAIL-R2 (clone DJR2), and PE-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1 isotype control (eBioscience); and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit (The Jackson Laboratory) secondary antibodies were used. Alexa 594-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody was used for immunofluorescence (The Jackson Laboratory). Cells were transfected with RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 12 nm siRNA for all cell lines except NCI-H460, which was transfected twice with 30 nm siRNA. Ack1a (siRNA ID 103419), Ack1b (siRNA ID s19850), and non-targeting control (siRNA ID AM4636) siRNAs were obtained from Applied Biosciences. The Ack1b oligonucleotide was used for Ack1 knockdown unless stated otherwise. Experiments were performed 48–72 h post-transfection. H460 cells were transfected with full-length Ack1 (WT) or kinase-dead Ack1 (mutant K158A) cloned in a pcDNA-DEST40 expression vector using JetPRIME transfection reagent (Polyplus Transfection) according to the supplier's recommendations. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the supplier's recommendations. A kinase-dead Ack1 mutant (K158A, a472g;a473c) was generated using primer 3′-GGTGAGTGTGGCTGTGGCGTGCCTGAAGC-5′. The construct for generating recombinant human TRAIL was a kind gift from Dr. Marion MacFarlane (University of Leicester) and generated as described previously (36Harper N. MacFarlane M. Recombinant TRAIL and TRAIL receptor analysis.Methods Enzymol. 2008; 446: 293-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, TRAIL residues 95–281 was cloned into the expression vector pET28b containing in-frame N-terminal His6 and T7 tags. The pET28b-TRAIL construct was transformed into BL21(DE3)RIL cells for propagation. Expression of recombinant TRAIL was induced by 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 27 °C. Induced bacterial pellets were lysed in Triton lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm PMSF) for 30 min on ice and sonicated. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 3220 × g for 45 min at 4 °C and supplemented with 20 mm imidazole. His-TRAIL was batch-purified by absorption onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads for 1.5 h at 4 °C. After washing, TRAIL was eluted from the beads by the addition of elution buffer (300 mm NaCl and 100 mm imidazole dissolved in PBS). Cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer (120 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 3% SDS, 15% glycerol, 0.03% bromphenol blue, and 75 mm DTT) and run on a 7.5–12.5% polyacrylamide gel at 100 V. Proteins were transferred onto HybondTM-P PVDF membranes at 100 V for 60–90 min. Membranes were blocked in 4% milk or 5% BSA dissolved in TBS/Tween. The protein bands were visualized using ECLTM or ECL PlusTM reagent and Hyperfilm® ECL (GE Healthcare). MCF10A cells were treated with 30 units/ml TRAIL for 2 h. Cells were trypsinized and washed twice with annexin V binding buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1.8 mm CaCl2). 10 μl of FITC-conjugated annexin V was added and incubated for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with annexin V binding buffer, and 1 mg/ml propidium iodide solution was added immediately prior to analysis by flow cytometry. Summit software was used to analyze the data. 10,000 events/sample were collected, and three independent experiments were performed. Cell surface expression of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 was analyzed as described previously (36Harper N. MacFarlane M. Recombinant TRAIL and TRAIL receptor analysis.Methods Enzymol. 2008; 446: 293-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, MCF10A cells were trypsinized, washed once with cell culture medium, and left to recover for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells (2.5 × 105) were pelleted and blocked in 40–45 μl of normal goat serum on ice for 5 min. 10 μl of PE-conjugated TRAIL-R1 (clone DJR1), 5 μl of PE-conjugated TRAIL-R2 (clone DJR2), or 10 μl of PE-conjugated mouse IgG1 isotype control was added to the cells for 1 h on ice in the dark. Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. The mean fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 575 nm. 10,000 events/sample were collected, and three independent experiments were performed. Lipid rafts were isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation and ultracentrifugation. One 15-cm dish with cells was used per sample. Cells were treated with 30 units/ml TRAIL for 1 h, washed once with PBS, and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with 1 mm vanadate, 1 mm NaF, and HaltTM phosphatase/protease inhibitor). 50-μl aliquots of the lysate were taken as the input control. The lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min, homogenized with 10 strokes of a tissue grinder, and mixed with 1 ml of 85% (w/v) sucrose (dissolved in lysis buffer without Triton X-100). The lysate and sucrose mixture was transferred to the bottom of a precooled 14-ml open top thin-wall ultracentrifuge tube (Beckman Instruments) and carefully overlaid with 7.5 ml of 35% sucrose and 3.5 ml of 5% sucrose. The samples were centrifuged at 38,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C in a swing-out SW 40 rotor in an Beckman Optima L-100 XP centrifuge. 1-ml fractions were carefully collected from the top to bottom of the tube and resuspended 1:1 with 3× SDS sample buffer. Samples were then subjected to Western blotting. Fractionation was performed with the subcellular proteome extraction kit (Calbiochem) according to the supplier's protocol. TRAIL receptor clustering was analyzed by SDS-PAGE with lysates without reducing agent. Cells were treated with 30 units/ml TRAIL for 15 min or 1 h, washed with PBS, and lysed in cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with HaltTM phosphatase/protease inhibitor, 1 mm vanadate, and 1 mm NaF). The lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. The cleared lysate was divided in two aliquots and diluted 1:1 with 3× SDS sample buffer with or without 150 mm DTT. The samples with DTT were incubated at 95 °C for 3 min, whereas the nonreduced samples were kept on ice before loading. NCI-H460 cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 s and then blocked in 5% goat serum in TBS/Tween. Primary and secondary antibodies and FITC-conjugated cholera toxin were diluted in blocking buffer. Images were taken with Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope and processed using Zeiss ZEN 2011 software. Cells was treated with 30 units/ml biotinylated TRAIL for 30 min at 37 °C, collected, and lysed for 30 min on ice in Triton lysis buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm vanadate, Complete protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm NaF). 50-μl aliquots of the lysates were taken as input samples. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. To analyze total TRAIL receptor levels, 3 units/ml biotinylated TRAIL was instead added to the cleared lysate, allowing TRAIL to bind all receptors in the cells. One sample without any addition of TRAIL was used as a negative control for the immunoprecipitation. TRAIL receptors with bound biotinylated TRAIL were precipitated with streptavidin-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended in 60 μl of SDS sample buffer, incubated at 95 °C for 3 min, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 s. The supernatant was subject to Western blotting and blotted for proteins of interest. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis was inhibited in MCF10A cells by pretreatment with 10 μg/ml chlorpromazine hydrochloride (dissolved in Me2SO) for 1 h prior to treatment with 30 units/ml TRAIL for 2 h. Me2SO alone was added to the non-treated samples. H460 cells were treated with the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine for 16 h at a final concentration of 50 or 100 μm prior to TRAIL treatment for 90 min. MCF10A cells were pretreated with 1 μm lapatinib and incubated for 1 h prior to treatment with 30 units/ml TRAIL. MCF10A cells were pretreated for 6 h with 50 mg/ml methyl β-cyclodextrin or 2 μg/ml nystatin (Sigma) in starvation medium (no serum or EGF) and then treated for 3 h with 3 units/ml TRAIL. MCF10A or HEK-293T cells were pretreated with 10 μm AIM-100 for 2 h to inhibit Ack1. We (37Hopkins S. Linderoth E. Hantschel O. Suarez-Henriques P. Pilia G. Kendrick H. Smalley M.J. Superti-Furga G.

We therefore asked whether Ack1 also plays a role in apoptotic signaling in response to different cellular stresses or pro-apoptotic ligands. Strikingly, siRNA-mediated depletion of Ack1 in MCF10A breast epithelial cells largely abolished TRAIL-induced apoptosis as shown by cell surface binding of annexin V (Fig. 1A). Quantification of annexin V-positive cells following 3 h of TRAIL treatment revealed a 72% decrease in the number of apoptotic cells after RNAi-mediated knockdown of Ack1 (Fig. 1, B and B′). To confirm the specificity of the siRNA, we transfected the MCF10A cells with two independent siRNA oligonucleotides that effectively r"

LILRA3 is a soluble receptor of unknown functions but is predicted to act as a broad antagonist to other membrane-bound LILRs. Functions of LILRA3 are unclear primarily because of the lack of high quality functional recombinant protein and insufficient knowledge regarding its ligand(s). Here, we expressed and characterized recombinant LILRA3 (rLILRA3) proteins produced in 293T cells, Escherichia coli, and Pichia pastoris. We found that the purified rLILRA3 produced in the mammalian system was the same size as a 70-kDa native macrophage LILRA3. This is 20 kDa larger than the calculated size, suggesting significant post-translational modifications. In contrast, rLILRA3 produced in E. coli was similar in size to the unprocessed protein, but yeast-produced protein was 2–4 times larger than the unprocessed protein. Treatment with peptide-N-glycosidase F reduced the size of the mammalian cell- and yeast-produced rLILRA3 to 50 kDa, suggesting that most modifications are due to glycosylation. Consistent with this, mass spectrometric analysis of the mammalian rLILRA3 revealed canonical N-glycosylation at the predicted Asn140, Asn281, Asn302, Asn341, and Asn431 sites.

A3 belongs to a family of highly homologous activating and inhibitory receptors that are primarily co-expressed on monomyeloid leukocytes and are increasingly recognized to regulate innate immune responses (1Brown D. Trowsdale J. Allen R. The LILR family: modulators of innate and adaptive immune pathways in health and disease.Tissue Antigens. 2004; 64: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Activating LILRs (LILRAs) have a short cytoplasmic tail that links to the intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs of the common γ chain of Fc receptors and transduces activating signals via protein tyrosine kinases (2Nakajima H. Samaridis J. Angman L. Colonna M. Human myeloid cells express an activating ILT receptor (ILT1) that associates with Fc receptor γ-chain.J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5-8PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibitory LILRs (LILRB) have a long cytoplasmic tail that contains two to four immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs that recruit SH2-containing inhibitory phosphatases such as SHP-1 (3Cosman D.

Co-engagement by shared ligands may regulate the threshold and amplitude of leukocyte activation. LILRA3 is a soluble protein with unknown function but bears close sequence homology to the extracellular domains of activating LILRA1 and LILRA2 and thus may act as a soluble antagonist (4Torkar M.

We showed previously that LILRA3 is abundantly present in normal serum and is significantly increased in sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (6An H. Chandra V. Piraino B. Borges L. Geczy C.

We proposed that LILRA3 may antagonize the effects of LILRA2, which is increased in highly inflamed synovial tissue (7Tedla N. An H. Borges L. Vollmer-Conna U. Bryant K. Geczy C. McNeil H.P.

Interestingly, absence of a functional allele due to a natural gene deletion (4Torkar M. Haude A. Milne S. Beck S. Trowsdale J. Wilson M.J.

Consistent with this, LILRA3 is strongly up-regulated by the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and down-regulated by proinflammatory cytokine TNFα (6An H. Chandra V. Piraino B. Borges L. Geczy C. McNeil H.P. Bryant K. Tedla N.

However, the exact in vivo and in vitro functions of LILRA3 are poorly established primarily due to inadequate knowledge about its ligand(s). The major impediments for comprehensive identification of high affinity LILR ligand(s) and understanding functions in vivo are the lack of properly folded and post-translationally modified, full-length recombinant LILR proteins and absence of robust protocols capable of simultaneously identifying ligands and/or co-ligands. The former is particularly relevant because LILRs are predicted to be highly glycosylated and have multiple disulfide bonds; thus, recombinant LILRs produced in non-eukaryotic cells are likely to be unsuitable for functional assays. leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor recombinant LILRA3 peptide-N-glycosidase activating LILR inhibitory LILR alkaline phosphatase tag recombinant APtag peripheral blood mononuclear cell natural killer analysis of variance. In this study, we produced high quality, properly folded, full-length rLILRA3 protein with or without C-terminal a placental alkaline phosphatase tag in a mammalian system using 293T cells. More importantly, rLILRA3 protein produced in 293T cells was successfully used to screen specific binding of this protein to various cell types. We show for the first time that LILRA3 strongly and specifically bound onto the surface of the monocytic cell line U937 and primary peripheral blood monocytes, suggesting expression of LILRA3 ligand(s) on these cells. Moreover, treatment of primary monocytes with purified mammalian recombinant LILRA3 significantly suppressed LPS-mediated TNFα production, indicating functional interaction of LILRA3 with its yet uncharacterized ligand. By contrast, full-length rLILRA3 produced in bacteria or yeast had poor binding and failed to suppress LPS-induced activation of monocytes. This variability in binding and function might be due to the optimal post-translational modification of the rLILRA3 produced in 293T cells. Indeed, rLILRA3 protein produced in 293T cells showed five N-glycosylation sites that likely have contributed to its superior ability to functionally bind to its potential ligand(s). Consistent with this finding, pretreatment of cells with β-lactose partially abrogated binding of rLILRA3 to the surface of monocytes. Taken together, recombinant LILRA3 that can be used for screening and identification of its ligand(s) and characterization of functions is best produced in higher eukaryote expression systems. Full-length LILRA3 cDNA was amplified from PBMC mRNA and inserted into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). This was used for further subcloning into mammalian (pAPtag-5, GenHunter), bacterial (pET30/LIC, Novagen), and yeast (pPICZβ, Invitrogen) expression vectors. In brief, a full-length LILRA3 without signal peptide was reamplified using 5′-AAGCTTTAAGGACCCACGTGCAGGCAGG-3′ forward primer and 5′-AAGCTTCCCACTCACCAGCCTTGGAGTC-3′ reverse primer containing HindIII restriction sites. This was inserted into HindIII-digested pAPtag-5 (GenHunter) vector to generate mammalian rLILRA3 protein with heat-resistant placental alkaline phosphatase and His6 tags on its C terminus (rLILRA3-APtag-His). Mammalian rLILRA3-His protein without APtag was generated by introduction of a new His6 sequence and a stop codon using 5′-CCGAAGCTTTAAGGACCCACGT-3′ forward primer and 5′-GGCCTCGAGTCAATGATGATGATGATGATGCTCACCAGCCTTGGAG-3′ reverse primer and directionally subcloned to pAPtag-5 vector, linearized with HindIII and XhoI. To generate rLILRA3-His protein in Escherichia coli, rLILRA3 without signal peptide was amplified using 5′-GACGACGACAAGACCAGGACCCACGTG-3′ forward primer and 5′-GAGGAGAAGCCCGGTCACCAGCCTTGG-3′ reverse primer and ligated into pET30 EK/LIC expression vector (Novagen). rLILRA3-His was produced in yeast after subcloning LILRA3 without signal peptide from pPIC9k vector using 5′-CCGCTCGAGAAAAGAGGGCCCCTCCCCAAGCCC-3′ forward primer and 5′-CCACTCGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAACTGAGCTCCGG-3′ reverse primer and inserted into pPICZβ expression vector at the XhoI cloning site. See supplemental Fig. 1 for illustration of the recombinant proteins. The LILRA3 with or without APtag in pAPtag-5 vector alone was stably transfected into the 293T cell line using Lipofectamine LTX reagent (Invitrogen), cultured in DMEM +10% FBS, and selected with 300 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). During each weekly passage, secreted recombinant LILRA3-APtag-His and APtag-His alone were detected in culture supernatants using a simple alkaline phosphatase activity assay as described (11Flanagan J.G. Leder P. The kit ligand: a cell surface molecule altered in steel mutant fibroblasts.Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Secreted fusion proteins were further confirmed by Western blotting 15 μl of culture supernatants using mouse anti-human placental alkaline phosphatase mAb (GenHunter). Production of rLILRA3-His without APtag protein was detected in culture supernatants by Western blotting using mouse anti-human LILRA3 mAb (Abcam). Cells that produced a high level of recombinant LILRA3 proteins were gradually adapted to DMEM containing 1% FBS, and selection was maintained with 30 μg/ml Zeocin. Cells were then grown to confluence in 1 liter of the serum-minimized medium, recombinant protein-containing culture supernatants were collected, and debris was removed by high speed centrifugation at 330 × g for 30 min at 4 °C followed by filtration with 0.22-μm filters. Culture supernatants were then buffer-exchanged and concentrated to 150 ml in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole) using an Amicon ultrafiltration system with a 30-kDa-cutoff membrane (Millipore). Buffer-exchanged proteins were loaded onto 1 ml of cobalt-immobilized metal affinity resin (Clontech) and connected to a BioLogic DuoFlow FPLC (Bio-Rad). The column was then stringently washed at a flow rate of 2 ml/min with 20 bed volumes of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (wash buffer) containing 10 mm imidazole for the APtag-His column or wash buffer containing 20 mm imidazole for rLILRA3-APtag-His and rLILRA3-His columns. Finally proteins were stepwise eluted with 5 × 2-ml fractions of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl elution buffers containing 50, 150, and 300 mm imidazole. rLILRA3-APtag-His and rAPtag-His proteins in each eluted fraction were quantitated by comparing placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity using AP standards (Sigma), and the purified rLILRA3 without APtag was quantitated using a standard BCA assay (Pierce). Proteins were further quality-controlled by silver staining of SDS-PAGE and Western blots, and their identities were verified by mass spectrometry. Fractions that contained a high concentration of high quality proteins were pooled, dialyzed into sterile LPS-minimized TBS (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), and requantitated. The resulting estimates of specific activity for the dialyzed rLILRA3-APtag-His and rAPtag-His proteins were 960 and 1500 units/mg, respectively. The concentration of the dialyzed rLILRA3 protein without APtag-His was 0.4 μg/ml. Totals of 750, 1000, and 400 μg of rLILRA3-APtag-His, rAPtag-His, and rLILRA3-His, respectively, were produced from 1 liter of culture supernatants. These proteins were stable at 4 °C for several months. LILRA3 in pET30 EK/LIC in BL21-DE3 with 50 μg/ml kanamycin selection was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when it reached optimal growth (A600 of 0.7–1.0). After overnight culture, the solubilization and refolding of the recombinant protein from E. coli inclusion bodies were custom optimized by Protein'eXpert (Grenoble, France). In brief, the bacterial cell pellet from 1 liter of culture was lysed by sonication and washed twice with cold TBS, and the inclusion body was solubilized in 40 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 500 mm NaCl, 6 m guanidine, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol overnight at 4 °C. Solubilized protein was separated by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and dialyzed three times against 1 liter of buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 500 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, 1 mm glycine, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) each time using a 10,000-dalton-cutoff membrane (Pierce). After dialysis, Sarkosyl was added to a final concentration of 0.3%, and the solution was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C, sonicated five times, and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 20 min. The soluble fraction was then loaded overnight at 4 °C onto 1-ml cobalt-containing metal affinity resin (Clontech) connected to an FPLC (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with buffer A containing 0.3% Sarkosyl and eluted with TBS buffer containing 150 mm imidazole (5 × 5 ml). Fractions of the eluted proteins with high purity and concentration were pooled (20 ml), dialyzed three times over 12 h against 1 liter of cold buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 m urea, 25 mm CaCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Brij35), and finally centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 20 min, and the soluble fraction was collected. This was then refolded by gradual dialysis into four changes (1 liter each) of cold 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT over a period of 18 h and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 45 min to remove aggregated protein. The refolded soluble protein was quality-controlled by HPLC and quantitated using the BCA assay. Up to 15 mg of refolded protein was produced from 1 liter of bacterial culture. To prevent oxidation and aggregation, protein was stored under argon gas at −80 °C in small aliquots in silicon-coated sealed vials at 1.3 mg/ml. LILRA3 in pPICZα-B vector was linearized with the restriction enzyme PmeI and transfected to P. pastoris (X33) by electroporation. Yeast strains showing single crossover recombination were selected to grow on minimal dextrose medium, and transformants showing a Mut+ phenotype were picked and cultured on minimal methanol agar plates. An rLILRA3-expressing colony was selected and grown in BMGY agar (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 1.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 4 × 10−5% (w/v) biotin, 1% (v/v) glycerol, 200 μg/ml Zeocin) at 30 °C until a 1:10 diluted culture had an A600 of 1.6–2.0. The culture medium was changed to BMMY broth (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 4 × 10−5% (w/v) biotin) and cultured at 30 °C for 24 h. Cells were then induced with 0.5% (v/v) methanol every 24 h until a total of 96 h. The induced culture supernatant was harvested by removing cells with centrifugation at 3000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and filtration using 0.22-μm-cutoff filter. The filtrate was then diluted 1:1 with binding buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm imidazole and loaded onto a nickel-MAC cartridge column (Novagen) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (ÄKTA purifier, GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 40 bed volume of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm imidazole and eluted with 10 ml of elusion buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm sodium chloride, 250 mm imidazole). Approximately 250 μg of protein was produced from 1 liter of yeast culture. The protein was stored at 4 °C and used for up to 1 month. To determine the extent of LILRA3 glycosylation, the mammalian cell- and yeast-produced recombinant proteins were treated with PNGase F according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). In brief, 2 μl of 10× glycoprotein denaturing buffer was added to 2.5 μg of protein in 20 μl of buffer and incubated at 95 °C for 10 min. 3 μl of G7 reaction buffer, 3 μl of Nonidet P-40, and 1 μl (500 units/μl) of PNGase F were then added to each reaction mixture, and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Changes in the deglycosylated rLILRA3 size and isoelectric focusing were determined by Western blotting of membranes from one- and two dimensional SDS-PAGE gels, respectively, and mass spectrometry. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from two healthy subjects were suspended at 5 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen), and 10% autologous sera and seeded onto 6-well Costar® plates. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 for 2 h, and non-adherent cells were removed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The adherent cells were then cultured in 3 ml of medium supplemented with 25 ng/ml GM-CSF (Invitrogen) for 3 days before washing twice in PBS and culturing for another 3 days in culture medium without GM-SCF but containing a 1:1000 dilution of brefeldin A solution (BioLegend, San Diego, CA). Cells were then washed twice with PBS, lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium fluoride, protease inhibitors), and stored at −80 °C until used for Western blotting to detect native LILRA3. For one-dimensional gels, 10 μg of purified recombinant proteins or in vitro derived primary human macrophage (∼1 × 104 cells) lysates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions before and after treatment with PNGase. Gels were either silver-stained or transferred onto PVDF membranes for Western blotting. In brief, PVDF membranes were rinsed with TBS and blocked in 5% skim milk in TBS for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then probed with a 1 μg/ml concentration of either mouse anti-LILRA3 mAb (clone 2E9, Abnova) or rabbit anti-AP antibody (GenHunter) for 2 h at room temperature and washed 4 × 5 min with TBS + 0.1% Tween 20. This was followed by incubation of membranes with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad) for 1.5 h at room temperature, 3 × 5-min washes, development with ECL reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and imaging with ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare). For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, PNGase F-treated and -untreated rLILRA3 proteins were precipitated with 20% acetone for 1 h at −20 °C. The precipitated proteins were air-dried for 10 min and rehydrated overnight at room temperature with IPG buffer (8 m urea, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, 10 mm DTT). The next day, 2% ampholyte was added to the rehydrated mixture. Isoelectric focusing of the denatured samples was determined by running a 13-cm pH 3–10 Immobiline dry strip (GE Healthcare) for a total of 9350 V. After focusing, the strips were equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS containing 2% DTT for 10 min. The reduced proteins were alkylated by incubation in the same buffer containing 2.5% iodoacetamide and electrophoretically separated by layering the strips onto 10% polyacrylamide gels, and resolved proteins were visualized by silver staining. In brief, 10 μg of purified rLILRA3-His from 293T cells was deglycosylated, separated under reducing conditions by 10% SDS-PAGE, and silver-stained. Specific bands were then excised, reduced, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and dehydrated with acetonitrile. In-gel proteins were digested with 2 ng/μl trypsin, 6 ng/μl chymotrypsin, or 6 ng/μl Glu-C. Treated gel bands were incubated in 1% formic acid and 3 × 100 μl of acetonitrile at room temperature. Pooled supernatants from each digest were dried. The dried residues were resuspended in 15 μl of 0.05% heptafluorobutyric anhydride and 1% formic acid and injected into a fritless Nano column (75 μm × 10 cm) of an Ultimate 3000 HPLC and autosampler system (Dionex, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Peptides were then eluted using a linear gradient from mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in H2O) to mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile) over 35 min at a flow rate of 0.3 μl/min. Positive ions of tryptic digests were generated by electrospray, and a survey scan (m/z 350–1750) was acquired in the Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance cell of an LTQ-FT Ultra mass analyzer (Thermo Electron, Bremen, Germany). For chymotrypsin and Glu-C digests, an Orbitrap mass analyzer (Thermo Electron, Bremen, Germany) was used. Peak lists of MS/MS data were generated using Mascot Daemon/extract_msn (Matrix Science, London, UK), interrogated using Mascot version 2.1 (Matrix Science), and searched against Homo sapiens proteins in the Swiss-Prot protein database (version 80). Precursor tolerances were 4.0 ppm, and product ion tolerances were ±0.4 Da. Modifications accounted for were acrylamide (Cys), carbamidomethyl (Cys), deamidation (Asn or Gln), and oxidation (Met) with a maximum of one missed cleavage permitted. Enzyme specificity was trypsin and semitrypsin for tryptic digests, V8-DE and no enzyme for Glu-C digests, and chymotrypsin and no enzyme for chymotryptic digests. Acceptable cutoff scores for individual MS/MS spectra were set to 20. Comparisons of experimental and theoretical tandem mass spectra were automatically performed by Mascot and verified manually. PNGase F-treated and -untreated E. coli-produced rLILRA3 and PNGase F-untreated 293T rLILRA3-His proteins were used as negative controls. The N-glycosylation analysis tool NetNGlyc-1.0 retrieved April 17, 2013 5R. Gupta, E. Jung, and S.

To assay for rLILRA3-APtag-His binding, over 25 cell lines from different lineage and peripheral blood leukocyte subsets were initially screened using 100 nm purified protein or control rAPtag-His. We consistently found specific high affinity binding to U937 cells and peripheral blood monocytes. The U937 cells were used for subsequent kinetic studies, competition experiments, and in situ staining. In brief, cell lines were cultured in their suitable media containing 10% FBS, and primary mononuclear leukocytes were purified by density gradient centrifugation followed by negative selection of monocytes, T cells, B cells, and NK cells using magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech, Germany) (6An H.

Cells were washed twice with PBS and once with HBHA buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma) containing 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 0.1% NaN3, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) and transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes at 5 × 106/ml of HBHA containing 100 nm rLILRA3-APtag-His or rAPtag-His control. Cells were incubated for 90 min at room temperature followed by four washes with 1.5 ml of cold HBHA and centrifugation at 200 × g at 4 °C for 5 min and aspiration of supernatant. Cell pellets were lysed with 400 μl of 1% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Lysates were then vortexed vigorously, the nuclei were spun out, and soluble lysates were collected. After heat inactivation of endogenous phosphatases at ∼65 °C for 15 min, the soluble lysates were assayed in duplicate for alkaline phosphatase activity as described (11Flanagan J.G. Leder P. The kit ligand: a cell surface molecule altered in steel mutant fibroblasts.Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). For competition assays, 5 × 106 U937 cells in 1 ml of HBHA buffer were preincubated with increasing concentrations (0–300 nm) of untagged purified recombinant LILRA3 proteins for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were spun at 200 × g for 5 min, unbound protein was aspirated, and cells were washed one time with cold HBHA buffer. Each cell pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of HBHA buffer, and binding to an optimal concentration of rLILRA3-APtag-His (30 nm) was performed as described above. To determine whether glycosylation contributes for ligand binding, U937 cells were preincubated with 0.1–0.2 m β-lactose or control sucrose or NaCl (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by a brief wash with cold HBHA buffer and binding to 30 nm rLILRA3-APtag-His or rAPtag-His control performed as described (14Fermino M.L.

Substitution of a small C-terminal segment in the second intracellular loop or the Phe223 residue in transmembrane helix 1 of α6 with the corresponding α3 segment or residue was found to enhance α6β4 functionality in tsA201 cells significantly, in part due to increased cell surface expression of the receptors. The gain-of-function effects of these substitutions appeared to be additive since incorporation of both α3 elements into α6 resulted in assembly of α6β4* receptors exhibiting robust functional responses to acetylcholine. The pharmacological properties exhibited by α6β4β3 receptors comprising one of these novel α6/α3 chimeras in oocytes were found to be in good agreement with those from previous studies of α6* nAChRs formed from other surrogate α6 subunits or concatenated subunits and studies of other heteromeric nAChRs.

https://openalex.org/W2072232286,"Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis, is subject to metabolic regulation. The human muscle isozyme is significantly more sensitive towards the allosteric inhibitor, AMP, than the liver isoform. Here we report crystal structures and kinetic studies for wild-type human muscle Fru-1,6-Pase, the AMP-bound (1.6 Å), and product-bound complexes of the Q32R mutant, which was firstly introduced by an error in the cloning. Our high-resolution structure reveals for the first time that the higher sensitivity of the muscle isozyme towards AMP originates from an additional water-mediated, H-bonded network established between AMP and the binding pocket. Also present in our structures are a metaphosphate molecule, alternate conformations of Glu97 coordinating Mg2+, and possible metal migration during catalysis. Although the individual subunit is similar to previously reported Fru-1,6-Pase structures, the tetrameric assembly of all these structures deviates from the canonical R- or T-states, representing novel tetrameric assemblies. Intriguingly, the concentration of AMP required for 50% inhibition of the Q32R mutant is increased 19-fold, and the cooperativity of both AMP and Mg2+ is abolished or decreased. These structures demonstrate the Q32R mutation affects the conformations of both N-terminal residues and the dynamic loop 52–72. Also importantly, structural comparison indicates that this mutation in helix α2 is detrimental to the R-to-T conversion as evidenced by the absence of quaternary structural changes upon AMP binding, providing direct evidence for the critical role of helix α2 in the allosteric signal transduction."

Previous studies have focused on p35-Cdk5, and little is known regarding p39-Cdk5. The lack of functional understanding of p39-Cdk5 is due, in part, to the labile property of p39-Cdk5, which dissociates and loses kinase activity in nonionic detergent conditions. Here we investigated the structural basis for the instability of p39-Cdk5. p39 and p35 contain N-terminal p10 regions and C-terminal Cdk5 activation domains (AD). Although p35 and p39 show higher homology in the C-terminal AD than the N-terminal region, the difference in stability is derived from the C-terminal AD. Based on the crystal structures of the p25 (p35 C-terminal region including AD)-Cdk5 complex, we simulated the three-dimensional structure of the p39 AD-Cdk5 complex and found differences in the hydrogen bond network between Cdk5 and its activators. Three amino acids of p35, Asp-259, Asn-266, and Ser-270, which are involved in hydrogen bond formation with Cdk5, are changed to Gln, Gln, and Pro in p39.

https://openalex.org/W2124984475,"The critically endangered Central American River Turtle (Dermatemys mawii) is the only remaining member of the Dermatemydidae family, yet little is known about its population structuring. In a previous study of mitochondrial (mt) DNA in the species, three main lineages were described. One lineage (Central) was dominant across most of the range, while two other lineages were restricted to Papaloapan (PAP; isolated by the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Sierra de Santa Marta) or the south-eastern part of the range (1D). Here we provide data from seven polymorphic microsatellite loci and the R35 intron to re-evaluate these findings using DNA from the nuclear genome. Based on a slightly expanded data set of a total of 253 samples from the same localities, we find that mtDNA and nuclear DNA markers yield a highly congruent picture of the evolutionary history and population structuring of D. mawii. While resolution provided by the R35 intron (sequenced for a subset of the samples) was very limited, the microsatellite data revealed pronounced population structuring. Within the Grijalva-Usumacinta drainage basin, however, many populations separated by more than 300 kilometers showed signals of high gene flow. Across the entire range, neither mitochondrial nor nuclear DNA show a significant isolation-by-distance pattern, but both genomes highlight that the D. mawii population in the Papaloapan basin is genetically distinctive. Further, both marker systems detect unique genomic signals in four individuals with mtDNA clade 1D sampled on the southeast edge of the Grijalva-Usumacinta basin. These individuals may represent a separate cryptic taxon that is likely impacted by recent admixture."
https://openalex.org/W2023740599,"Our previous study suggested that the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) interacts with Snail1, which affects genomic instability, sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, and migration of tumor cells by reciprocal regulation between DNA-PKcs and Snail1. Here, we further investigate that a peptide containing 7-amino acid sequences (amino acids 15-21) of Snail1 (KPNYSEL, SP) inhibits the endogenous interaction between DNA-PKcs and Snail1 through primary interaction with DNA-PKcs. SP restored the inhibited DNA-PKcs repair activity and downstream pathways. On the other hand, DNA-PKcs-mediated phosphorylation of Snail1 was inhibited by SP, which resulted in decreased Snail1 stability and Snail1 functions. However, these phenomena were only shown in p53 wild-type cells, not in p53-defective cells. From these results, it is suggested that interfering with the protein interaction between DNA-PKcs and Snail1 might be an effective strategy for sensitizing cancer cells and inhibiting tumor migration, especially in both Snail1-overexpressing and DNA-PKcs-overexpressing cancer cells with functional p53."

Proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, which are produced at inflamed joints, further promote OCG and resorptive activity (4Takayanagi H. New developments in osteoimmunology.Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2012; 8: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Such crosstalk between immune cells and OCs highlights the need for a therapeutic treatment capable of reducing inflammation and preventing bone erosion. osteoclast osteoclastogenesis bone marrow macrophage phospholipase C γ2 receptor activator of NF-κB RANK ligand Src homology tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase adenovirus. PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 molecules are critical regulators of innate and adaptive immune responses and are activated during OC differentiation. These enzymes convert phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into two second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, leading to activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate/calcium and diacylglycerol-dependent pathways downstream of RANK, integrins, and a variety of immune receptors (5Faccio R. Cremasco V. PLCγ2: where bone and immune cells find their common ground.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2010; 1192: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For example, in vitro studies of T lymphocytes demonstrate that PLCγ1 is a critical modulator of T cell receptor responses (6Koretzky G.A. Myung P.S.

PLCγ2 expression is confined to cells of hematopoietic lineage, including B lymphocytes, natural killer cells, mast cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and OCs (10Coggeshall K.M. McHugh J.C.

Plcγ2−/− mice have increased bone mass (osteopetrosis) due to reduced differentiation of BMMs into OCs (15Mao D. Epple H. Uthgenannt B. Novack D.V. Faccio R. PLCγ2 regulates osteoclastogenesis via its interaction with ITAM proteins and GAB2.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 2869-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Additionally, Plcγ2−/− mice are protected from serum transfer-induced arthritis and antigen-induced arthritis due to functional defects in neutrophils and dendritic cells, respectively (13Cremasco V. Benasciutti E. Cella M. Kisseleva M. Croke M. Faccio R.

Therefore, PLCγ2 is a promising target for therapeutic design in the context of inflammatory osteolysis. However, due to its high homology with the more ubiquitously expressed PLCγ1, it is necessary to find inhibitors that can selectively block PLCγ2 activation. PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 are unique from other PLC molecules because they contain two tandem SH2 motifs and an SH3 adaptor motif. Initial studies suggested that these adaptor motifs harbor an intrinsic regulatory function of the catalytic activity of the protein (16Homma Y. Takenawa T. Inhibitory effect of src homology (SH) 2/SH3 fragments of phospholipase C-γ on the catalytic activity of phospholipase C isoforms. Identification of a novel phospholipase C inhibitor region.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21844-21849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), exposing the catalytic domain upon PLCγ1/2 phosphorylation (17Carpenter G. Ji Q. Phospholipase C-γ as a signal-transducing element.Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, it is now established that these SH2 and SH3 motifs can also mediate protein-protein binding via homeodomain interactions (17Carpenter G. Ji Q. Phospholipase C-γ as a signal-transducing element.Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Considering that the catalytic domains of PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 are over 90% homologous, whereas their adaptor motifs are less than 60% homologous, the latter regions are a potential target for specific inhibition. The scaffolding function of PLCγ2, in addition to its catalytic activity, is required for OC formation. Cells with a point mutation in the SH2 domain of PLCγ2 are incapable of in vitro OCG despite intact catalytic function (18Epple H. Cremasco V. Zhang K. Mao D. Longmore G.D. Faccio R. Phospholipase Cγ2 modulates integrin signaling in the osteoclast by affecting the localization and activation of Src kinase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 3610-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that the scaffolding function of endogenous PLCγ2 could be disrupted through a dominant-negative effect by a molecule encompassing the adaptor domains of PLCγ2. We report that a molecule composed of the tandem SH2 motifs of PLCγ2 is able to abrogate OCG in vitro and in vivo by disrupting protein interactions between RANK and Gab2. This approach may represent a novel method of targeting PLCγ2 to prevent inflammatory bone loss. The SH2 or SH3 domains of PLCγ2 were cloned into the blasticidin-resistant pMX retroviral vector and fused with HA. To generate retrovirus, PLAT-E cells were transfected with expression vector by using a TransIT transfection reagent (Mirus Bio). Viral supernatants were collected on days 2 and 3 after transfection and immediately used to transduce freshly isolated BMMs. After 24 h, medium containing 1 μg/ml blasticidin was added to cells for 48 h to select for expressing cells. Bone marrow was isolated from long bones of 6–8-week-old C57BL/6 mice and cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and glutamine (α-10 medium), with 0.1 volume of CMG14-12 cell-conditioned medium as a source of M-CSF (19Takeshita S. Kaji K. Kudo A. Identification and characterization of the new osteoclast progenitor with macrophage phenotypes being able to differentiate into mature osteoclasts.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) to obtain BMMs. To form OCs, BMMs were cultured in α-10 medium with 100 ng/ml glutathione S-transferase-receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (GST-RANKL) and 0.01 volume of CMG14-12 for 5 days. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) using a commercial kit (Sigma 387-A). BMMs were cultured with 100 ng/ml RANKL and 0.01 volume of CMG14-12 for 0, 2, or 4 days. Adherent cells were harvested in TRIzol. Total RNA was isolated by chloroform extraction followed by purification with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using SuperScript II according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For real-time PCR, SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) and primers specific for murine NFATc1, TRAP, cathepsin K, calcitonin receptor, and GAPDH were used as follows: NFATc1, 5′-CCCGTCACATTCTGGTCCAT-3′ and 5′-CAAGTAACCGTGTAGCTGCACAA-3′; TRAP, 5′-CAGCTCCCTAGAAGATGGATTCAT-3′ and 5′-GTCAGGAGTGGGAGCCATATG-3′; cathepsin K, 5′-ATGTGGGTGTTCAAGTTTCTGC-3′ and 5′-CCACAAGATTCTGGGGACTC-3′; calcitonin receptor, 5′-CAAGAACCTTAGCTGCCAGAG-3′ and 5′-CAAGCACGCGGACAATGTTG-3′; and GAPDH 5′-TGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGA-3′ and 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGA-3′). Ct values were normalized to GAPDH internal control. Data are expressed as the relative -fold change when compared with the expression in BMMs transduced with pMX empty vector control at day 0. Analysis of bone resorption was completed as described previously (18Epple H. Cremasco V. Zhang K. Mao D. Longmore G.D. Faccio R. Phospholipase Cγ2 modulates integrin signaling in the osteoclast by affecting the localization and activation of Src kinase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 3610-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, BMMs were plated on bovine bone slices and cultured with 0.01 CMG14-12 and 100 ng/ml GST-RANKL for 10 days. Fresh medium was added every 2 days. Cells were removed from the bone surface by using mechanical force and 2 n NaOH. Bone slices were stained with 20 μg/ml peroxidase-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin for 30 min (Sigma) followed by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (0.52 mg/ml in PBS containing 0.1% H2O2) for 15 min. Bone resorption pits were visualized with a light microscope and quantified using Image J software (National Institutes of Health; rsbweb.nih.gov/ij). Cells were harvested in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitors and clarified by centrifugation. The protein concentration of each sample was determined using bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Bio-Rad), and 1 mg of protein from each sample was used for immunoprecipitation. Samples were incubated with anti-PLCγ2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-Gab2 antibody (Millipore) overnight at 4 °C and with protein G-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitates were used for Western blotting. For RANKL and M-CSF stimulation, pre-OCs were starved for 4 h in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 2% FBS and then stimulated with RANKL (100 ng/ml) or M-CSF (100 ng/ml) minimum Eagle's medium for the indicated times. Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer supplemented with HALT protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Pierce). To obtain nuclear extracts from RANKL-treated cells, tissue culture plates were washed with H2O, and the adherent cells were lysed with hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors) followed by the addition of 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected (cytosolic fraction), whereas the pellets (nuclear fraction) were suspended in high salt buffer (hypotonic buffer plus 400 mm NaCl). For vitronectin stimulation, pre-OCs were washed with PBS and lifted with 10% trypsin/EDTA in PBS. Cells were replated on tissue culture plates coated with vitronectin for the indicated length of time and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer supplemented with HALT protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. The protein concentration of cell lysates or nuclear extracts was determined using bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Bio-Rad). An equivalent amount of protein for each sample was mixed with 5× loading buffer (312.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 50% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoethanol), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were probed with antibodies as indicated. Antibodies specific to the phosphorylated forms of PLCγ1, PLCγ2, ERK, JNK, c-Jun, Iκ-Bα, and Src (Tyr-416) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies against p65, NFATc1, PLCγ2, TRAF6, RANK, lamin B, and Sp1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The monoclonal antibody against β-actin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Polyclonal Gab2 antibody was purchased from Millipore. WT C57Bl/6 mice were treated with 100 μg of RANKL and 107 PFU of adenovirus containing LacZ (Ad-LacZ control) or SH2(N+C) (Ad-SH2(N+C)) by subcutaneous injections over the calvaria daily for 5 days. Mice were sacrificed on day 6, and the calvaria were collected for histological analysis. The calvaria were preserved in 10% buffered formalin overnight (16 h) and decalcified with 14% EDTA for 4 days. Paraffin-embedded sections were stained for TRAP to visualize OCs (Sigma). WT C57Bl/6 mice were treated with 30 μg of LPS and 107 PFU of adenovirus containing Ad-LacZ or Ad-SH2(N+C) by subcutaneous injections over the calvaria at day 0 followed by 107 PFU of Ad-LacZ or Ad-SH2(N+C) on days 1, 3, and 5. Mice were sacrificed on day 6, and the calvaria were processed for histological analysis as described above. Paraffin-embedded sections were stained for TRAP to visualize OCs (Sigma). All mice used in these experiments were housed in the animal care unit of the Washington University School of Medicine, where they were maintained according to guidelines of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. All animal experimentation was approved by the Animal Studies Committee of the Washington University School of Medicine. To design an efficient strategy to specifically oppose endogenous PLCγ2 activity in the context of pathological bone loss, we focused on the protein modular domains as the catalytic motif is highly homologous to PLCγ1. Retroviral constructs harboring the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains alone or in combination (N+C), the SH3 domain, or encompassing both SH2 and SH3 regions were generated (Fig. 1A). These constructs were transduced into WT BMMs that also express endogenous PLCγ2. Expression of the indicated domains was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 1B). BMMs were treated with RANKL and M-CSF, and differentiation to mature OCs was evaluated by TRAP staining. RANKL and M-CSF induced differentiation of precursor cells into OCs in all groups, except in the presence of the SH2(N+C) and partially in SH2(N+C)+SH3-expressing cells. Ectopic expression of SH2(N+C) significantly impaired OC development (number of TRAP+ cells in SH2(N+C), 1.3 ± 0.88 versus empty vector, 153.3 ± 8.99, p < 0.0001). A 52% inhibition of OCG was observed in WT cells expressing SH2(N+C)+SH3, whereas the differentiation of cells expressing a single SH2 (either SH2-N or SH2-C) or the SH3 motif alone was similar to cells infected with the empty vector (pMX; Fig. 1, C and D). Consistent with its inhibitory effect on OC formation, BMMs that were transduced with SH2(N+C) and grown on cow bone slices in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF for 7 days formed fewer resorptive pits when compared with pMX-transduced controls (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2SH2(N+C) blocks bone resorption. WT BMMs were transduced with pMX empty vector or SH2(N+C) and cultured on tissue culture plastic (A) or cow bone slices (B) in the presence of 100 ng/ml RANKL and 10 ng/ml M-CSF.

C, the surface area of resorbed bone was quantified as the percentage of total bone surface area. Error bars indicate mean ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further understand which stage of OC differentiation was blocked by the expression of SH2(N+C), real-time PCR was used to quantify expression of the early osteoclastogenic marker TRAP and the master transcription regulator of OCG NFATc1, the functional OC protease cathepsin K, and the calcitonin receptor expressed by mature OCs (Fig. 3). WT cells transduced with empty vector alone showed an up-regulation for all conventional markers of OCG during 4 days of culture in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF. In contrast, expression of OC differentiation markers was dramatically reduced in WT cells expressing SH2(N+C), indicating that this molecule targets signaling pathways involved early in the OC differentiation process. To understand how SH2(N+C) inhibits OCG in vitro, we analyzed activation of signaling pathways downstream of RANK/RANKL stimulation, M-CSF/c-Fms stimulation, or vitronectin/αVβ3 integrin ligation. WT day 2 pre-OCs expressing SH2(N+C) or vector control were stimulated with 100 ng/ml RANKL for 0–60 min, as indicated. Pre-OCs expressing SH2(N+C) failed to activate downstream RANK signals, as assayed by Western blot for phosphorylation of PLCγ2, Iκ-Bα, and p38 and up-regulation of c-Fos and NFATc1 (Fig. 4A). Activation of JNK was unaffected (not shown). Furthermore, nuclear translocation of NFATc1 and phosphorylated c-Jun was inhibited by SH2(N+C) expression (Fig. 4B). In contrast, when pre-OCs were stimulated with 100 ng/ml M-CSF over the indicated time course, cells expressing SH2(N+C) induced phosphorylation of the downstream molecules AKT and ERK equivalent to cells expressing the vector alone (Fig. 4C). Phosphorylation of Pyk2, c-Src, and Iκ-Bα was decreased in SH2(N+C)-expressing pre-OCs plated on vitronectin (Fig. 4D). All together, these results indicate that SH2(N+C) primarily inhibits the RANKL- and integrin-mediated signaling pathways, which are integral to OC differentiation. To understand the mechanism by which SH2(N+C) interferes with the RANKL signaling cascade, a co-immunoprecipitation assay of cell lysates from RANKL-stimulated pre-OCs was performed. Following RANKL binding to its receptor RANK, the signaling adaptor Gab2 is recruited to the RANK complex (20Wada T. Nakashima T. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Gasser J. Hara H. Schett G. Penninger J.M. The molecular scaffold Gab2 is a crucial component of RANK signaling and osteoclastogenesis.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Gab2 associates with PLCγ2 to stimulate phosphorylation of Iκ-Bα leading to OCG (15Mao D. Epple H. Uthgenannt B. Novack D.V. Faccio R. PLCγ2 regulates osteoclastogenesis via its interaction with ITAM proteins and GAB2.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 2869-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 20Wada T. Nakashima T. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Gasser J. Hara H. Schett G. Penninger J.M. The molecular scaffold Gab2 is a crucial component of RANK signaling and osteoclastogenesis.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). SH2(N+C) dampened the association of PLCγ2 with Gab2 when compared with pre-OCs expressing vector only (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, SH2(N+C) also impaired the association of RANK with Gab2 but did not affect recruitment of TRAF6 to Gab2 (Fig. 5B). Thus, SH2(N+C) inhibits RANK signaling cascades by impeding protein scaffolding at the receptor. Finally, the potential efficacy of targeting PLCγ2 adaptor motifs to inhibit bone erosion was examined in vivo, using two established models of OCG. To facilitate these studies, adenoviral vectors were generated to express SH2(N+C) or β-galactosidase (LacZ) as a control. LacZ expression after one intra-articular injection of 107 PFU was confirmed by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining (data not shown). In the first model, 100 μg of RANKL and 107 PFU of Ad-SH2(N+C) or Ad-LacZ were administered to WT mice by subcutaneous injections over the calvaria daily for 5 days. Mice were sacrificed on day 6, and calvaria were prepared for histological examination to assess the number of TRAP+ OCs. WT mice receiving SH2(N+C) adenovirus displayed significantly fewer OCs when compared with LacZ-expressing controls (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, the effect of SH2(N+C) in the context of inflammatory bone loss was examined using an established model of OCG initiated by a single LPS injection over the calvaria. 30 μg of LPS and 107 PFU of SH2(N+C) or control LacZ adenovirus were injected over the calvaria at day 0 followed by 107 PFU of SH2(N+C) or control LacZ adenovirus every other day for 5 days. Mice were sacrificed on day 6, and calvaria were examined by histology. WT mice receiving SH2(N+C) adenovirus developed half the number of TRAP-positive OC when compared with LacZ-expressing controls (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that PLCγ2 can be specifically targeted in vivo by a dominant-negative effect of the SH2(N+C), and that this approach can abrogate inflammatory-induced OC formation. Inhibitors that block the catalytic activity of PLC proteins, such as ET-18-OCH3 and U73122, have been used to establish the function of PLCs and the importance of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol in various cellular contexts. However, the major limitation of these inhibitors is lack of specificity. Using a genetic model consisting of Plcγ2-deficient mice, we previously showed that PLCγ2 is required for the maintenance of basal bone mass and for protection from inflammatory arthritis (13Cremasco V. Benasciutti E. Cella M. Kisseleva M. Croke M. Faccio R.

Invest. 2006; 116: 2869-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, the goal of the current study was to identify a specific approach to target endogenous PLCγ2 function. We report that ectopic expression of the tandem SH2 domains of PLCγ2 phenocopies the intrinsic OC deficit of Plcγ2−/− mice (15Mao D. Epple H. Uthgenannt B. Novack D.V. Faccio R. PLCγ2 regulates osteoclastogenesis via its interaction with ITAM proteins and GAB2.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 2869-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) by disrupting the protein association between RANK and Gab2. This approach is a novel method of targeting endogenous PLCγ2 function to negate pathological bone loss. PLCγ2 is important for both OC differentiation and bone resorption. We previously proposed that in the context of OCG, PLCγ2 serves a dual purpose both as an active lipase, leading to expression of the master osteoclastogenic transcription factor NFATc1, and as a critical scaffolding molecule facilitating NF-κB and AP-1 induction. Point mutations in the SH2 domains of PLCγ2 (R564K/R672K) render BMMs unable to differentiate to OCs despite intact catalytic activity (18Epple H. Cremasco V. Zhang K. Mao D. Longmore G.D. Faccio R. Phospholipase Cγ2 modulates integrin signaling in the osteoclast by affecting the localization and activation of Src kinase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 3610-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the overall effect of the SH2(N+C) was inhibition of the RANK signaling cascade and suppression of OCG. Our observations support an independent scaffolding function of PLCγ2 in which the SH2 motifs of PLCγ2 mediate the association between RANK and Gab2. Our results suggest that ectopic expression of SH2(N+C) exerts a dominant-negative effect on formation of this complex by sequestering Gab2 and thus impairing its binding to the receptor RANK. These observations are consistent with modeling of intracellular RANK receptor interactions (21Taguchi Y. Gohda J. Koga T. Takayanagi H. Inoue J. A unique domain in RANK is required for Gab2 and PLCγ2 binding to establish osteoclastogenic signals.Genes Cells. 2009; 14: 1331-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Taguchi Y. Kiga Y.

Metab. 2012; 30: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). During the first hour of RANKL stimulation (early activation phase), PLCγ2 is recruited to RANK, and Gab2 binds weakly to the recruited PLCγ2 without interacting directly with RANK (21Taguchi Y. Gohda J. Koga T. Takayanagi H. Inoue J. A unique domain in RANK is required for Gab2 and PLCγ2 binding to establish osteoclastogenic signals.Genes Cells. 2009; 14: 1331-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Following prolonged RANKL stimulation (beyond 24 h), Gab2 may bind to the hepatic control region (HCR) of RANK and recruit TRAF6 (21Taguchi Y. Gohda J. Koga T. Takayanagi H. Inoue J. A unique domain in RANK is required for Gab2 and PLCγ2 binding to establish osteoclastogenic signals.Genes Cells. 2009; 14: 1331-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Taguchi Y. Kiga Y.

Thus, it is hypothesized that the scaffolding function of PLCγ2 is critical in the early phase, whereas its catalytic activity may modulate signaling during the early and late phases of RANKL stimulation (21Taguchi Y. Gohda J. Koga T. Takayanagi H. Inoue J.

Gab2 belongs to a family of adaptor molecules that mediate signals downstream of a diverse set of receptors for molecules such as growth factors, antigens, cytokines, Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, and the RANK receptor. Gab2-deficient mice exhibit impaired OCG and a net increase in bone mass. Gab2 is also necessary for the differentiation of human progenitor cells into OCs (20Wada T. Nakashima T. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Gasser J. Hara H. Schett G. Penninger J.M. The molecular scaffold Gab2 is a crucial component of RANK signaling and osteoclastogenesis.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In vitro, BMMs from Gab2-deficient mice do not form mature OCs due to an inherent defect that correlates with reduced RANKL-mediated activation of NF-κB, Akt, and JNK. Similarly, ectopic expression of SH2(N+C) primarily affects RANKL signaling in OCs, without altering downstream signals from the M-CSF receptor, thus implying a good level of specificity for this type of targeted approach. Because a Gab2-PLCg2 complex is likely to form in response to various stimuli, inhibitory effects of SH2(N+C) in other contexts are possible and warrant further investigation. In contrast to SH2(N+C), the anti-osteoclastic effects of molecules encompassing each single SH2 domain or the entire adaptor motif of PLCγ2, consisting of the two SH2 domains along with the SH3 motif, were very minimal. It is likely that targeting only one SH2 domain is not sufficient to sequester adaptor molecules from forming a complex with RANK. However, it was surprising to find that a larger fragment encompassing the entire adaptor region of PLCγ2 had less effect than SH2(N+C) molecule. Initial models of PLCγ1, and perhaps PLCγ2, function suggested that, at the three-dimensional structural level, the entire adaptor region (SH2(N+C)+SH3) forms a cap that regulates exposure of the catalytic domain to its substrate (17Carpenter G. Ji Q. Phospholipase C-γ as a signal-transducing element.Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Indeed, overexpression of SH2(N+C)+SH3 was shown to block phospholipase activity of cell lysates in vitro (16Homma Y. Takenawa T. Inhibitory effect of src homology (SH) 2/SH3 fragments of phospholipase C-γ on the catalytic activity of phospholipase C isoforms. Identification of a novel phospholipase C inhibitor region.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21844-21849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, this region exerted a dominant-negative effect to reduce PLCγ1 enzyme activity in prostate tumor cells and resulted in reduced tumor invasiveness (23Turner T. Epps-Fung M.V. Kassis J. Wells A. Molecular inhibition of phospholipase Cγ signaling abrogates DU-145 prostate tumor cell invasion.Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 2275-2282PubMed Google Scholar). Although these previous studies clearly demonstrate that the entire adaptor region modulates catalytic activity, they do not clarify whether or not this region also mediates protein-protein binding. In OCs, the incomplete inhibition of OCG by SH2(N+C)+SH3 supports the hypothesis that SH2(N+C)+SH3 is not fully capable of blocking PLCγ2 catalytic activity. SH2(N+C) anti-osteoclastogenic effects are also observed in vivo using two models of bone loss, consisting of RANKL or LPS supracalvarial injections. Although RANKL directly stimulates the differentiation of monocytes into OCs, LPS-induced bone loss is secondary to immune activation. In vivo immune phenotypes caused by genetic alterations of Plcγ2 have been described. We and others (12Ombrello M.J. Remmers E.F. Sun G. Freeman A.F. Datta S. Torabi-Parizi P. Subramanian N.

In humans, a dominantly inherited disease called PLAID (PLCγ2-associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation) is caused by mutant alleles of PLCγ2 in which small, in-frame genomic deletions eliminate part or all of the C-terminal SH2 domain of PLCγ2. Immune cells from these patients displayed functional deregulation, with increased activation in response to some stimuli and decreased activation in other circumstances (12Ombrello M.J. Remmers E.F.

Although we did not directly test the effects of SH2(N+C) on immune cell activation or function, it is possible that SH2(N+C) may also modulate inflammatory responses involved in LPS-mediated bone loss in addition to directly targeting the OCs. Further studies are needed to examine potential anti-inflammatory effects of SH2(N+C). In conclusion, the results reported here provide strong evidence that PLCγ2 adaptor function can be targeted in vitro and in vivo to suppress OCG and bone erosion.

Peptides containing the motif interact with the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex; however, the mechanism by which the motif exerts its immunosuppressive activity is yet to be determined. Recent studies showed that interactions between protein domains in the membrane milieu are not always sterically controlled. Therefore, we utilized the unique membrane leniency toward association between d- and l-stereoisomers to investigate the detailed mechanism by which ISLAD CM inhibits T-cell activation. We show that a d-enantiomer of ISLAD CM (termed ISLAD d-CM) inhibited the proliferation of murine myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-(35–55)-specific line T-cells to the same extent as the l-motif form. Moreover, the d- and l-forms preferentially bound spleen-derived T-cells over B-cells by 13-fold. Furthermore, both forms of ISLAD CM co-localized with the TCR on activated T-cells and interacted with the transmembrane domain of the TCR. FRET experiments revealed the importance of basic residues for the interaction between ISLAD CM forms and the TCR transmembrane domain. Ex vivo studies demonstrated that ISLAD d-CM administration inhibited the proliferation (72%) and proinflammatory cytokine secretion of pathogenic MOG(35–55)-specific T-cells. This study provides insights into the immunosuppressive mechanism of gp41 and demonstrates that chirality-independent interactions in the membrane can take place in diverse biological systems.

During the life cycle of the virus, it is able to both hyperactivate and down-regulate the T-cell response at different stages. This is accomplished by several virulent proteins, such as Nef and Tat, which enable HIV-1 to evade the immune response (8Wu Y. Marsh J.W.

HIV-1 Env is composed of surface and transmembrane subunits. The surface subunit, gp120, is responsible for the recognition of CD4 and co-receptors. The transmembrane subunit, the gp41 fusion protein, is responsible for merging the viral membrane with that of its target T-cell (16Finzi A. Xiang S.H. Pacheco B. Wang L. Haight J. Kassa A. Danek B.

Cell. 2010; 37: 656-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The ectodomain of gp41 consists of several regions, including a transmembrane domain (TMD), a C-terminal heptad repeat, a loop, an N-terminal heptad repeat, and a fusion peptide. The ability of gp41 to mediate fusion is facilitated by the interaction between the C- and N-terminal heptad repeats, which form a six-helix bundle structure (17Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S.

Recently, we showed that a peptide derived from this region is a potent inhibitor of T-cell activation both in vitro and in vivo (30Ashkenazi A. Faingold O. Kaushansky N. Ben-Nun A. Shai Y. A highly conserved sequence associated with the HIV gp41 loop region is an immunomodulator of antigen-specific T cells in mice.Blood. 2013; 121: 2244-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This peptide, termed immunosuppressive loop-associated determinant (ISLAD), contains a highly conserved core motif (CM) of Trp repeat and acidic (Asp and Glu) residues and interacts with the TCR complex (30Ashkenazi A.

A highly conserved sequence associated with the HIV gp41 loop region is an immunomodulator of antigen-specific T cells in mice.Blood. 2013; 121: 2244-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which ISLAD exerts its immunosuppressive effect on T-cells is yet to be determined. We hypothesized that the interaction of ISLAD with the TCR complex takes place in the membrane, taking into account the membrane-binding capacity of the motif (30Ashkenazi A. Faingold O. Kaushansky N. Ben-Nun A. Shai Y.

Membrane interactions between the TMDs of the TCR complex are fundamental for the initiation of T-cell activation signals (31Manolios N. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D.

Importantly, recent studies suggested that interactions within the membrane can be chirality-independent for several cell membrane proteins (33Gerber D. Shai Y.

Therefore, we investigated the immunosuppressive mechanism of the ISLAD motif (ISLAD l-CM) and its d-enantiomer form (ISLAD d-CM) with an opposite chirality (see Table 1). Our results demonstrate that the d-enantiomer of ISLAD CM interacts with the TCR complex in the membrane and inhibits T-cell activation in vitro and ex vivo.

Synthesis of the antibacterial peptide cecropin A(1–33).Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5020-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). All peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC to >95% homogeneity. The molecular weight of the peptides was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The addition of 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) fluoride (Molecular Probes) to the N terminus of selected peptides was performed in dimethylformamide for 1 h. The addition of rhodamine N-hydroxysuccinimide (Rho; Molecular Probes) to the N terminus of selected peptides was performed in dimethylformamide containing 2% N,N-diisopropylethylamine for 24 h. Murine MOG(35–55)-specific line T-cells (referred to hereafter as mMOG(35–55) T-cells) were plated onto round 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2.5% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Each of the 96 wells had a final volume of 200 μl and contained 20 × 103 T-cells and 5 × 105 irradiated (25 gray) syngeneic spleen cells as APCs, without or with 1–5 μg/ml MOG(35–55). In addition, the relevant HIV peptide was added. To exclude interaction between the examined peptides and the MOG(35–55) antigen, we initially added the MOG(35–55) antigen to the APCs in a test tube, and in a second test tube, we added the examined peptides to the T-cells. After 1 h, the APCs were mixed with the T-cells and co-incubated for 48 h in a 96-well flat bottom plate. The T-cells were pulsed with 1 μCi [3H]thymidine (specific activity of 5.0 Ci/mmol), and after overnight incubation, [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured using a Matrix 96 direct β-counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Mice were subcutaneously immunized with 150 μg of MOG(35–55) peptide emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant containing 150 μg of M. tuberculosis H37Ra with or without 0.5 mg/kg HIV peptides. Ten days post-immunization, draining lymph nodes were removed and cultured in triplicate in the absence or presence of antigen as described previously (39Ben-Nun A. Kerlero de Rosbo N. Kaushansky N.

Anatomy of T cell autoimmunity to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG): prime role of MOG44F in selection and control of MOG-reactive T cells in H-2b mice.Eur. J. Immunol. 2006; 36: 478-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The cultures were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. [3H]Thymidine (1 mCi/well) was added for an additional 16 h of incubation, and the cultures were then harvested and counted using the β-counter. Proinflammatory cytokine analysis of IFNγ and IL-17 was performed by ELISA 24 h after cell activation according to standard protocols from Pharmingen as described previously (40Kaushansky N. Zilkha-Falb R. Hemo R. Lassman H. Eisenstein M. Sas A. Ben-Nun A. Pathogenic T cells in MOBP-induced murine EAE are predominantly focused to recognition of MOBP21F and MOBP27P epitopic residues.Eur.

Splenocytes derived from C57BL mice were treated for red blood cell lysis, washed, and incubated for 20 min (room temperature) with 0.15 μm rhodamine-conjugated peptides. Thereafter, the splenocytes were washed and stained with antibodies according to the BioLegend protocols. Fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies (phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse CD3 and B220) were purchased from BioLegend. Cells were analyzed on Cytomics FC 500 system (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed using Beckman Coulter software. Activated mMOG(35–55) T-cells (5 × 104) were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and washed with PBS. The cells were then treated with 10% FCS in PBS at room temperature to block unspecific binding. After 30 min, the cells were washed, and rabbit anti-TCRα polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added (1:100) in 2% FCS in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. This was followed by the addition of FITC-labeled rat anti-rabbit antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 40 min at room temperature. The rhodamine-labeled fluorescent peptide was added during the last 10 min of incubation at a final concentration 1 μm. The cells were then washed with PBS and deposited onto a glass slide. The labeled cell samples were observed under an Olympus FV1000 fluorescence confocal microscope, and confocal slices were obtained. Jurkat T-cells (4 × 106) were incubated overnight at 37 °C in the presence of 1 μm rhodamine-labeled peptides. The cells were washed then with PBS and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, and after 10 min, a 125 mm glycine solution was added to stop the reaction. Formaldehyde is a well known cross-linking agent used in the characterization of protein-protein interactions. It was used to increase specificity because only closely associated proteins can be cross-linked due to the small size of formaldehyde. The cells were lysed for 30 min on ice in 300 μl of lysis buffer, followed by a sonication step. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C. The proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and proteins bound to the fluorescently labeled peptide were detected using the Typhoon 9400 variable mode imager (Amersham Biosciences). Excitation was set at 532 nm, and fluorescence emission was collected using a TAMRA filter (580 ± 30 nm) at 100 μm resolution and 600 V. The protein loading amount was confirmed by Western blotting for actin. Jurkat T-cells (4 × 106) were incubated overnight at 37 °C in the presence of 10 μm rhodamine-labeled peptides, cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, and lysed. The lysate was then incubated overnight with anti-TCRα antibody (1 μg) following 2 h of incubation with Protein G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The beads were washed then with lysis buffer and boiled for 10 min; the protein supernatant was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. The presence of co-immunoprecipitated peptide was detected using the Typhoon 9400 variable mode imager. Aliquots of 2.5 × 104 mMOG(35–55) T-cells were distributed onto a 96-well plate in the presence of the peptides (40 μm) for 4 h. Wells in the last two columns served as a blank (medium only) and a 100% survival control (cells and medium only). After incubation, the XTT (2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) reaction solution (50:1 benzenesulfonic acid hydrate and N-methyl dibenzopyrazine methyl sulfate) was added for an additional 2 h. Optical density was read at a 450-nm wavelength in an ELISA plate reader. The percentage of toxicity was calculated relative to the control (2.5 × 104 cells in medium with no peptide added). CD spectroscopy measurements were performed using an Applied Photophysics spectropolarimeter. The spectra were scanned using a thermostatic quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 mm. Wavelength scans were performed at 25 °C; the average recording time was 15 s in 1-nm steps at a wavelength range of 190–260 nm. Peptides were scanned at a concentration of 100 μm in a membrane mimetic environment of 1% lysophosphatidylcholine in HEPES solution (Sigma). Peptides interacting with membranes were analyzed and quantified using the fluorescence anisotropy of their intrinsic Trp residue in the presence of large unilamellar vesicle (LUV) model membranes. The LUVs were composed of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol (9:1) as described previously (41Cohen T. Pevsner-Fischer M. Cohen N. Cohen I.R. Shai Y. Characterization of the interacting domain of the HIV-1 fusion peptide with the transmembrane domain of the T-cell receptor.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4826-4833Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 280 and 350 nm, respectively, and 1 μm peptide (in 400 μl of PBS) was titrated successively with 13.3 mm membrane solution. Because Trp is known to change its emission in a hydrophobic environment, a change in its emission represents the amount of peptide bound to membranes. The system reached binding equilibrium (Fmax) at a certain lipid/peptide ratio, allowing us to calculate the affinity constant from the relations between the equilibrium level of Trp emission and the lipid concentration using a steady-state affinity model. The affinity constants were then determined by nonlinear least-squares analysis. The nonlinear least-squares fitting was done using Equation 1, Y(x)=Ka×X×Fmax1+Ka×X(Eq. 1) where X is the lipid concentration, Y(x) is the fluorescence emission, Fmax is the maximum difference in the emission of Trp-containing peptide before and after the addition of lipids (it represents the maximum amount of peptides bound to a lipid), and Ka is the affinity constant. The FRET experiments were performed using the NBD- and Rho-labeled peptides as energy donors and energy acceptors, respectively. Fluorescence spectra were obtained at room temperature, with excitation set at 467 nm (10-nm slit) and emission scan at 500–600 nm (10-nm slits). An NBD-labeled peptide was added first from a stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide at a final concentration of 0.1 μm and a maximum of 0.25% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide to a dispersion of phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol (9:1) LUVs (200 μm) in PBS. This was followed by the addition of the Rho-labeled peptide (stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide) in several sequential doses. Fluorescence spectra were obtained before and after the addition of the Rho-labeled peptide. The fluorescence values were corrected by subtracting the corresponding blank (buffer with the same vesicle concentration). ISLAD CM is conserved within all clades of HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus fusion proteins (30Ashkenazi A. Faingold O. Kaushansky N. Ben-Nun A. Shai Y.

https://openalex.org/W2025997294,"Spatial networks, in which nodes and edges are embedded in space, play a vital role in the study of complex systems. For example, many social networks attach geo-location information to each user, allowing the study of not only topological interactions between users, but spatial interactions as well. The defining property of spatial networks is that edge distances are associated with a cost, which may subtly influence the topology of the network. However, the cost function over distance is rarely known, thus developing a model of connections in spatial networks is a difficult task. In this paper, we introduce a novel model for capturing the interaction between spatial effects and network structure. Our approach represents a unique combination of ideas from latent variable statistical models and spatial network modeling. In contrast to previous work, we view the ability to form long/short-distance connections to be dependent on the individual nodes involved. For example, a node's specific surroundings (e.g. network structure and node density) may make it more likely to form a long distance link than other nodes with the same degree. To capture this information, we attach a latent variable to each node which represents a node's spatial reach. These variables are inferred from the network structure using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We experimentally evaluate our proposed model on 4 different types of real-world spatial networks (e.g. transportation, biological, infrastructure, and social). We apply our model to the task of link prediction and achieve up to a 35% improvement over previous approaches in terms of the area under the ROC curve. Additionally, we show that our model is particularly helpful for predicting links between nodes with low degrees. In these cases, we see much larger improvements over previous models."
https://openalex.org/W2045806095,"Basophils co-express FcεRIα and CD49b, the α-2 chain of integrin-type receptor VLA-2 (α2β1), which recognizes type-1 collagen as a major natural ligand. The physiological relevance of this integrin for interactions with extracellular bone marrow matrix remains unknown. Herein, we examined the expression of several receptors of this family by bone marrow-derived basophils sorted either ex-vivo or after culture with IL-3. Having established that both populations display CD49d, CD49e and CD49f (α-4, α-5 and α-6 integrins subunits, respectively), we addressed receptor functions by measuring migration, adhesion, proliferation and survival after interacting with matched natural ligands. Type I collagen, laminin and fibronectin promoted basophil migration/adhesion, the former being the most effective. None of these ligands affected basophil viability and expansion. Interactions between basophils and extracellular matrix are likely to play a role in situ, as supported by confocal 3D cell imaging of femoral bone marrow sections, which revealed basophils exclusively in type-1 collagen-enriched niches that contained likewise laminin and fibronectin. This is the first evidence for a structure/function relationship between basophils and extracellular matrix proteins inside the mouse bone marrow."

I was very excited by the new research horizons opened by these developments. With Alex’s arrival, our labs started working together on the next challenges — testing the function of these newly identified genes in mouse development and finding more ways to identify other key developmental genes. We knew the answer must lie with ESCs. In 1981, Martin Evans and Matt Kaufman in Cambridge and Gail Martin in San Francisco had separately isolated pluripotent stem cells directly from the mouse blastocyst. Allan Bradley and Liz Robertson, in Martin Evans’s lab, and Achim Gossler in Rolf Kemler’s lab then provided proof-of-principle studies demonstrating that any genetic alteration introduced into these cells in culture could be transmitted through the germ line in chimaeras. Alex introduced ESC concepts to Toronto from San Francisco. When Achim Gossler joined my lab as a post-doc and brought germline-competent ESCs, we had the starting material for a major assault on gene functional analysis in the mouse. But how should we attack the problem? We knew about the promise of targeted mutagenesis by homologous recombination, developed in mammalian cells by Mario Capecchi and Oliver Smithies, but it had only been demonstrated to work in ESCs for genes such as Hprt, where one could select for mutation or correction of the gene. Would it be efficient enough to work for non-selectable genes such as engrailed? We pondered instead a random retroviral insertional approach, followed by a pooled polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect mutations in genes of interest. Achim and I also started to plan an enhancer trap approach, similarly to that developed in Drosophila melanogaster, to identify novel genes by expression of their associated enhancers in ESC chimaeras. However, when we heard from Oliver Smithies that he was developing a PCR-based approach to detect targeted mutations in non-selectable genes in ESCs, we abandoned the random insertional approach and put all our efforts into targeted mutagenesis with engrailed2 as the first target. We were fortunate to have Bill Skarnes join Alex’s lab as a graduate student at that time. He developed the targeting vector for En2, which was at the same time developed into a gene trap reporter vector, using the En2 splice acceptor to trap upstream exons in a lacZ fusion that would also disrupt the gene. Alex and I started the targeting experiments, picking portions of hundreds of individual neomycin-resistant colonies and assaying for targeted integrations using PCR. We began without a PCR machine — moving tubes by hand from waterbath to water-bath. Hints of success spurred us to purchase the second PCR machine ever sold in Canada, and, as they say, the rest is history. We published one of the first reports of successful targeting of a non-selectable gene in ESCs in Nature in 1989, and reported approaches for enhancer and gene-trap screens in ESCs in Science in the same year. The field of mammalian genetics was very rapidly transformed as more and more ways of manipulating the mouse germ line were developed by different groups. But it was a special time for me in Toronto, working in a great group of talented people, all with our own personalities and quirks, but all bringing our unique skills to make a successful team. The efforts of the International Knockout Mouse Consortium have made knockout mouse ESCs available off the shelf for almost the entire mouse genome, relegating the generation of a targeted mutation to supplementary material in most papers. And it seems that classical targeted mutagenesis in ESCs may be rapidly superseded by exciting new genome editing tools. Mammalian genetics moves on and new horizons await."
