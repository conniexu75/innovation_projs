Viruses are the most numerous biological entities on Earth with an estimated population size of 1031 particles (Brüssow and Hendrix, 2002Brüssow H. Hendrix R.W. Phage genomics: small is beautiful.Cell. 2002; 108: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Bacteriophages (or phages; viruses that infect bacteria and archaea) profoundly influence microbial communities by functioning as vectors of horizontal gene transfer (Jain et al., 1999Jain R. Rivera M.C. Lake J.A. Horizontal gene transfer among genomes: the complexity hypothesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Brockhurst M.A. Ecological and Evolutionary Benefits of Temperate Phage: What Does or Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Stronger.BioEssays. 2017; 39: 1700112Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and promoting dynamic co-evolutionary interactions (Betts et al., 2014Betts A. Kaltz O. Hochberg M.E. Contrasted coevolutionary dynamics between a bacterial pathogen and its bacteriophages.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 11109-11114Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For decades, the discovery of phages occurred at a slow pace. However, with the advent of high-throughput metagenomics, it became possible to uncover an unparalleled amount of novel phage diversity (Al-Shayeb et al., 2020Al-Shayeb B. Sachdeva R. Chen L.-X. Ward F. Munk P. Devoto A. Castelle C.J. Olm M.R. Bouma-Gregson K.

A surprising finding was that the majority of phage sequences uncovered by metagenomics could not be classified into any known viral taxonomy laid out by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) (e.g., species, genus, family) (Simmonds et al., 2017Simmonds P. Adams M.J. Benkő M. Breitbart M. Brister J.R. Carstens E.B. Davison A.J. Delwart E. Gorbalenya A.E. Harrach B. et al.Consensus statement: Virus taxonomy in the age of metagenomics.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2017; 15: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), prompting many researchers to organize phage predictions from metagenomic datasets into grouping schemes based solely on genomic features (Bin Jang et al., 2019Bin Jang H. Bolduc B. Zablocki O. Kuhn J.H. Roux S. Adriaenssens E.M. Brister J.R. Kropinski A.M. Krupovic M. Lavigne R. et al.Taxonomic assignment of uncultivated prokaryotic virus genomes is enabled by gene-sharing networks.Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The impact of phages on different ecosystems is beginning to be uncovered, with phages found in the oceans already being referred to as “puppet masters” due to their significant impact on oceanic biogeochemistry (Breitbart et al., 2018Breitbart M. Bonnain C. Malki K. Sawaya N.A. Phage puppet masters of the marine microbial realm.Nat. Microbiol. 2018; 3: 754-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Given the impact of the gut microbiome composition and function on human health, there is a growing focus on phages that inhabit the gut ecosystem (Clooney et al., 2019Clooney A.G. Sutton T.D.S. Shkoporov A.N. Holohan R.K. Daly K.M. O’Regan O. Ryan F.J. Draper L.A. Plevy S.E. Ross R.P. Hill C.

Lal S.K. The Human Gut Microbiome - A Potential Controller of Wellness and Disease.Front. Microbiol. 2018; 9: 1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The first metagenomic studies revealed that the majority (81%–93%) of the viral gut diversity is novel (Manrique et al., 2016Manrique P. Bolduc B. Walk S.T. van der Oost J. de Vos W.M. Young M.J. Healthy human gut phageome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: 10400-10405Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar; Reyes et al., 2010Reyes A. Haynes M. Hanson N. Angly F.E. Heath A.C. Rohwer F. Gordon J.I. Viruses in the faecal microbiota of monozygotic twins and their mothers.Nature. 2010; 466: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), but gut phage host assignment and host range remain largely uncharacterized. An exception has been p-crAssphage, a phage discovered in 2014 by computational analysis of metagenomic reads and found in >50% of western human gut microbiomes (Dutilh et al., 2014Dutilh B.E. Cassman N. McNair K. Sanchez S.E. Silva G.G.Z. Boling L. Barr J.J. Speth D.R. Seguritan V. Aziz R.K. et al.A highly abundant bacteriophage discovered in the unknown sequences of human faecal metagenomes.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Analyses of predicted phage sequences from gut metagenomes have yielded fascinating insights into phage biology, such as the presence of sticky domains (which could facilitate adherence of phage to the intestinal mucus; Barr et al., 2013Barr J.J. Auro R. Furlan M. Whiteson K.L. Erb M.L. Pogliano J. Stotland A. Wolkowicz R. Cutting A.S. Doran K.S. et al.Bacteriophage adhering to mucus provide a non-host-derived immunity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 10771-10776Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), reverse transcriptases that promote gene hypervariation (Minot et al., 2012Minot S. Grunberg S. Wu G.D. Lewis J.D. Bushman F.D. Hypervariable loci in the human gut virome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 3962-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and proteins with ankyrin domains that could aid bacterial hosts in immune evasion (Jahn et al., 2019Jahn M.T. Arkhipova K. Markert S.M. Stigloher C. Lachnit T. Pita L. Kupczok A. Ribes M. Stengel S.T.

Previous analyses have focused on bulk viral fragments with limited resolution to characterize individual phage genomes or link specific phages to a bacterial host species (Minot et al., 2012Minot S. Grunberg S. Wu G.D. Lewis J.D. Bushman F.D. Hypervariable loci in the human gut virome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 3962-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). More recently, human gut metagenomes have been mined to compile a more comprehensive list of gut phage genomes (Gregory et al., 2019Gregory A.C. Zablocki O. Howell A. Bolduc B. Sullivan M.B. The human gut virome database.bioRxiv. 2019; https://doi.org/10.1101/655910Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar; Paez-Espino et al., 2019Paez-Espino D. Roux S. Chen I.A. Palaniappan K. Ratner A. Chu K.

Llabrés M. et al.IMG/VR v.2.0: an integrated data management and analysis system for cultivated and environmental viral genomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: D678-D686Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), providing new fundamental insights into the viral diversity and functions present in the human gut microbiome. Nevertheless, the limited number (<700) of metagenomes used to construct these databases (GVD and gut phage fraction from IMG/VR), and the fragment size of their predictions (median size <15 kb as opposed to ∼50 kb for an average Caudovirales phage genome commonly found in the human gut), suggests that the majority of gut phage diversity remains uncharacterized and incomplete. Indeed, a recent report estimated that IMG/VR, which contains viral sequences from a wide range of environments, showed that only 1.9% of the predictions were complete, and 2.5% were classified as high quality (>90% complete) (Nayfach et al., 2020Nayfach S. Camargo A.P. Eloe-Fadrosh E. Roux S. Kyrpides N. CheckV: assessing the quality of metagenome-assembled viral genomes.BioRxiv. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.06.081778Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). A comprehensive resource of longer and complete reference phage genomes is required to enable genome-resolved metagenomics for gut phage studies across human populations. Here, we introduce the Gut Phage Database (GPD), a highly curated database containing 142,809 non-redundant phage genomes derived from the analysis of 28,060 globally distributed metagenomic samples. Importantly, the GPD includes over 40,000 high-quality genomes with a median size of 47.68 kb. We use GPD to gain insight into the biology, host range, and global epidemiology of human gut phages. We uncover 280 globally distributed viral clusters, including 1 viral clade (Gubaphage) with reminiscent features to p-crAssphage. Given the high quality of the reference genomes, the database size, and the sequence diversity harbored by the GPD, this resource will greatly improve the characterization of individual human gut bacteriophages at a global or local scale. In order to obtain a comprehensive view of human gut phage diversity, we analyzed 28,060 public human gut metagenomes and 2,898 bacterial isolate genomes cultured from the human gut (Figure 1A). To identify viral sequences among human gut metagenomes, we screened over 45 million assembled contigs with VirFinder (Ren et al., 2017Ren J. Ahlgren N.A. Lu Y.Y. Fuhrman J.A. Sun F. VirFinder: a novel k-mer based tool for identifying viral sequences from assembled metagenomic data.Microbiome. 2017; 5: 69Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which relies on k-mer signatures to discriminate viral from bacterial contigs, and VirSorter (Roux et al., 2015Roux S. Enault F. Hurwitz B.L. Sullivan M.B. VirSorter: mining viral signal from microbial genomic data.PeerJ. 2015; 3: e985Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), which exploits sequence similarity to known phage and other viral-like features such as guanine cytosine (GC) skew. Because obtaining high-quality genomes was essential for our downstream analyses, we used conservative settings (see STAR methods for further details) for both tools and retained only predictions that were at least 10 kb long. To further improve the quality of the dataset, we devised a machine-learning approach to filter out contaminant mobile genetic elements (MGEs) (Figure S1A). We identified predictions carrying machinery from type IV secretion systems, suggesting contamination by conjugative mobile elements, such as plasmids or integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). We used a feedforward neural network to discriminate phages from ICEs by exploiting differences in gene density, fraction of hypothetical proteins, and k-mer composition signatures (see STAR methods). The classifier was trained with experimental sequences of phages and ICEs and showed an excellent performance in an independent test set (area under the curve [AUC] > 0.97) (Figure S1B) of human gut mobile genetic elements. Next, we dereplicated the final set of filtered sequences at a 95% average nucleotide identity (ANI) threshold (over a 75% aligned fraction) obtaining a database of 142,809 gut phage sequences, henceforth referred to as the GPD. We estimated the level of completeness of each viral genome with CheckV (Nayfach et al., 2020Nayfach S. Camargo A.P. Eloe-Fadrosh E. Roux S. Kyrpides N. CheckV: assessing the quality of metagenome-assembled viral genomes.BioRxiv. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.06.081778Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). This tool infers the expected genome length of a viral prediction based on the average amino acid identity to a database of complete viral genomes from NCBI and environmental samples. In total, 13,429 (9.4%) of the viral genomes were classified as complete, 27,999 (19.6%) as high quality, and 101,381 (70.99%) as genome fragments (<90% complete). This classification scheme is consistent with the Minimum Information about an Uncultivated Virus Genome standards (Roux et al., 2019Roux S. Adriaenssens E.M. Dutilh B.E. Koonin E.V. Kropinski A.M. Krupovic M. Kuhn J.H. Lavigne R. Brister J.R. Varsani A. et al.Minimum Information about an Uncultivated Virus Genome (MIUViG).Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The median genome completeness of all genomes stored in the GPD was estimated to be 63.5% (interquartile range, IQR = 34.68%–95.31%) (Figure S1C). Estimation of non-viral DNA by CheckV showed that 73.5% of GPD predictions had no contamination whereas 84.13% had a predicted contamination <10% (Figure S2D). In comparison to other human gut phage databases (Gregory et al., 2019Gregory A.C. Zablocki O. Howell A. Bolduc B. Sullivan M.B. The human gut virome database.bioRxiv. 2019; https://doi.org/10.1101/655910Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar; Paez-Espino et al., 2019Paez-Espino D. Roux S. Chen I.A. Palaniappan K. Ratner A. Chu K. Huntemann M. Reddy T.B.K. Pons J.C. Llabrés M. et al.IMG/VR v.2.0: an integrated data management and analysis system for cultivated and environmental viral genomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: D678-D686Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), GPD had the largest median genome size with ∼31 kb, followed by IMG/VR and GVD with 15 kb and 11 kb, respectively (Figure S1E). In order to assess the viral diversity of the GPD at high taxonomic levels, we used a graph-based clustering approach to group genetically related phages. Merging GPD with the RefSeq phages and 2 other human gut phage databases (GVD and gut phage fraction of IMG/VR) resulted in the generation of 21,012 non-singleton viral clusters (VCs) with at least 1 GPD prediction (GPD VCs). A VC corresponds to a viral population sharing approximately 90% sequence identity over ∼75% aligned fraction (see STAR methods for further details). Benchmarking against the RefSeq phages (Brister et al., 2015Brister J.R. Ako-Adjei D. Bao Y. Blinkova O. NCBI viral genomes resource.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D571-D577Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) revealed that the boundaries of GPD VCs were equivalent to a subgenus level, as 99.73% of all VCs were contained within the genus level. Strikingly, less than 1% (171 out of 21,012) of the GPD VCs overlap with the RefSeq phages. Phages from these 171 VCs mainly infect Escherichia, Enterobacter, Staphylococcus, and Klebsiella genera, reflecting the bias of the RefSeq database toward well-known clinically important and traditionally cultured bacteria. Consistent with previous reports of phage predictions from metagenomic datasets (Hoyles et al., 2014Hoyles L. McCartney A.L. Neve H. Gibson G.R. Sanderson J.D. Heller K.J. van Sinderen D. Characterization of virus-like particles associated with the human faecal and caecal microbiota.Res. Microbiol. 2014; 165: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we were not able to confidently assign a family to the majority (∼80%) of GPD VCs, whereas the rest corresponded mainly to the Podoviridae, Siphoviridae, and Myoviridae families (Figure S1E). These 3 viral families belong to the Caudovirales order (phages characterized by having tails and icosahedral capsids) and were previously reported to be enriched in human feces (Hoyles et al., 2014Hoyles L. McCartney A.L. Neve H. Gibson G.R. Sanderson J.D. Heller K.J. van Sinderen D. Characterization of virus-like particles associated with the human faecal and caecal microbiota.Res. Microbiol. 2014; 165: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar; Roux et al., 2012Roux S. Krupovic M. Poulet A. Debroas D. Enault F. Evolution and diversity of the Microviridae viral family through a collection of 81 new complete genomes assembled from virome reads.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e40418Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For comparison purposes, we also considered VCs without GPD predictions (Figure 1C). Analysis of VCs composed from only GPD and IMG/VR genomes showed 3,699 overlaps, whereas we found 3,206 VCs composed of only GPD and GVD genomes. Moreover, GPD harbored the highest number of unique VCs with 12,731 clusters. On the other hand, 1,099 VCs and 113 VCs were unique to IMG/VR and GVD, respectively. In addition, 1,205 VCs were shared by the 3 databases. Interestingly, the number of VCs with an assigned phage taxon was lower in the VCs that were unique to GPD as opposed to those shared with GVD and IMG/VR (18.74% versus 27.8%) (p = 1.96 × 10−9, χ2 test). Thus, GPD considerably expanded the previously unknown gut phage diversity in the human gut. This phage diversity expansion is likely driven by the high number of gut metagenomes mined and their global distribution, which allows the retrieval of rarer gut phage clades. In addition, GPD provides an unparalleled opportunity to explore the functions encoded by human gut phages. After clustering the whole proteome of GPD into 202,192 protein clusters, we found that top functions corresponded to DNA binding proteins, integrases, methylases, peptidases, and tape measure proteins; however, the majority of phage proteins (47.46%) could not be assigned a function. The GPD creates a unique opportunity to assign specific phage to bacterial host species providing a phylogenetic framework to study gut bacteria-phage biology. Accordingly, we inferred the most likely bacterial hosts for each phage prediction with a comprehensive collection of 2,898 high-quality human gut bacterial isolate genomes (Forster et al., 2019Forster S.C. Kumar N. Anonye B.O. Almeida A. Viciani E. Stares M.D. Dunn M. Mkandawire T.T. Zhu A. Shao Y. et al.A human gut bacterial genome and culture collection for improved metagenomic analyses.Nat.

Dai Y. et al.1,520 reference genomes from cultivated human gut bacteria enable functional microbiome analyses.Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). By screening for the presence of CRISPR spacers targeting phages and by linking the prophages to their assemblies of origin (Edwards et al., 2016Edwards R.A. McNair K. Faust K. Raes J. Dutilh B.E. Computational approaches to predict bacteriophage-host relationships.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2016; 40: 258-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), we assigned 40,932 GPD phages (28.66% of all predictions) to 2,157 host strains. This corresponded to at least 1 phage for 74.43% of all cultured human gut bacteria. In addition, co-occurrence analysis between a phage and its predicted genera host revealed that they were found in the same metagenomic sample 92% of the time. We then analyzed whether there was any preference for phage infection across 4 common human gut bacterial phyla (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteriota) (Figure S2A). At the phylum level, we detected significant lower phage prevalence in Actinobacteriota, with 58.79% infected isolates in comparison with at least 70% for the other phyla. We then measured viral diversity (measured by the number of VCs per isolate) within each phylum. This analysis revealed that the Firmicutes harbor a significantly higher viral diversity (Figure S2B), with an average of 3.13 VCs per isolate while also harboring 60% of the total VCs assigned across all phyla. Interestingly, the Firmicutes diversity was unevenly distributed as most of the viral diversity originated from the Negativicutes and Clostridia classes, with an average of 4.88 VCs and 3.9 VCs per isolate, respectively, in contrast with the Bacilli (0.99 VC per isolate), and none for Bacilli A and Desulfitobacteriia classes. Analysis at the bacterial genus level across all phyla revealed that Lachnospira, Roseburia, Agathobacter, Prevotella, and Blautia A contain the highest number of VCs per isolate (Figure 2A). With the exception of Prevotella, which belongs to the Gram-negative Prevotellaceae family, these genera are members of the Gram-positive Lachnospiraceae family of Firmicutes associated with butyrate-producing spore-formers. In contrast, the lowest viral diversity per isolate was detected among Helicobacter, and the lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus H, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus D, and Pediococcus. Thus, we observe a wide distribution of phage abundance and prevalence across human gut bacteria, even within the same phylum. Horizontal transfer of genes between bacteria via transduction is a major driver of gene flow in bacterial communities (Chen et al., 2018Chen J. Quiles-Puchalt N. Chiang Y.N. Bacigalupe R. Fillol-Salom A. Chee M.S.J. Fitzgerald J.R. Penadés J.R. Genome hypermobility by lateral transduction.Science. 2018; 362: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Host tropism of bacteriophage is believed to be limited by phylogenetic barriers, with most phages being usually restricted to a single host bacterial species (Ackermann, 1998Ackermann H.W. Tailed bacteriophages: the order caudovirales.Adv. Virus Res. 1998; 51: 135-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this has not been investigated at large scale across the human gut bacteria. Host assignment at different bacterial taxonomic ranks revealed that the majority of VCs were restricted to infect a single species (64.51%) (Figure S2C). We also found many VCs with broader host ranges such as those restricted to a single genus (22.39%), family (10.79%), order (1.86%), class (0.26%), and phylum (0.13%). Our findings are in line with a recent survey of the host range of gut phages by meta3C proximity ligation (6,651 unique host-phage pairs) which found that ∼69% of gut phages were restricted to a single species (Marbouty et al., 2020Marbouty M. Thierry A. Koszul R. Phages - bacteria interactions network of the healthy human gut.bioRxiv. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.093716Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Visualization of very broad range VCs (i.e., those not restricted to a single genus) reveals the large-scale connectivity between phylogenetically distinct bacterial species that fuels bacteria adaptation and evolution (Figure 2B). In general, the higher the viral diversity per bacterial genus, the higher the number of phages with broad host range (Figure S2D). Surprisingly, 2 VCs (VC_269 and VC_644) had a host range that spanned 2 bacterial phyla. VC_269 was predicted to infect Faecalibacterium prausnitzii C (Firmicutes) and 2 Bifidobacterium spp. (Actinobacteriota), whereas VC_644 had a host range that included 5 Bacteroides spp. (Bacteroidota) and Blautia A wexlerae (Firmicutes). We predicted VC_269 to be a Myoviridae phage; on the other hand, we could not assign a taxonomy rank to VC_644. The presence of integrases in both VCs suggest that these are temperate phages. We hypothesize that additional phages infecting both Actinobacteriota and Firmicutes might be more common, because recent evidence supports a shared ancestry between phages that infect both Actinobacteria (Streptomyces) and Firmicutes (Faecalibacterium) (Koert et al., 2019Koert M. Mattson C. Caruso S. Erill I. Evidence for shared ancestry between Actinobacteria and Firmicutes bacteriophages.bioRxiv. 2019; https://doi.org/10.1101/842583Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Taken together, we reveal that approximately one third of gut phage have a broad host range not limited to a single host species. Our analysis provides a comprehensive blueprint of phage-mediated gene flow networks in human gut microbiome. The gut phageome can be defined as the aggregate of phages that inhabit the gut (Manrique et al., 2016Manrique P. Bolduc B. Walk S.T. van der Oost J. de Vos W.M. Young M.J. Healthy human gut phageome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: 10400-10405Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We performed the most comprehensive phageome profiling of the human gut by read mapping 28,060 metagenomes against the GPD. These metagenomic datasets used to generate the GPD were sampled from 28 different countries across the 6 major continents (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania). Our initial analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between sample sequencing depth and the number of viral genomes detected for samples with <50 million reads. Therefore, we focused further analysis on a dataset of 3,011 deeply sequenced (> 50 million reads) metagenome samples spanning all continents and 23 countries (Figure S3A). We observed clear separation of the North American, European, and Asian phageomes from African and South American samples when we computed the inter-sample Jaccard distance (Figure 3A) (p = 0.001, PERMANOVA test). Interestingly, these phageome patterns are associated with important differences in human lifestyles. Country-wise, samples derived from Africa and South America were mainly sampled from Peru, Tanzania, and Madagascar. Specifically, Peruvian and Tanzanian samples originate from hunter-gatherer communities whereas Malagasy samples come from rural communities with non-Western lifestyles. Oceania was a special case because it had a similar fraction of samples belonging to both groups. However, when we stratified by country, we revealed that all Fijian samples clustered with the rural group, whereas Australian samples segregated with the urbanized cluster. Fiji samples were derived from rural agrarian communities. These observations support the hypothesis that lifestyle, particularly urbanization, could drive differences in the gut phageomes across different human populations. We reasoned that the bacterial composition of an individual’s microbiome would shape the gut phageome. Prevotellaceae bacteria are more abundant and prevalent in individuals living a rural/traditional lifestyle, whereas Bacteroides are more abundant and prevalent in individuals living an urban/western lifestyle (Wu et al., 2011Wu G.D. Chen J. Hoffmann C. Bittinger K. Chen Y.-Y. Keilbaugh S.A. Bewtra M. Knights D. Walters W.A. Knight R. et al.Linking long-term dietary patterns with gut microbial enterotypes.Science. 2011; 334: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar). By harnessing the host assignment data for each phage, we found a significantly higher proportion of VCs assigned to the Prevotellaceae family from African, South American, and Fijian metagenome samples than to those of North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia (p = 0.0, χ2 test) (Figure 3B). Conversely, the Bacteroides phages were significantly more prevalent in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia gut microbiomes (p = 1.72 × 10−208, χ2 test). Given the correlation between microbiome enterotypes and phageome types, driven by the intimate connection between phages and their bacterial hosts, we provide evidence that human lifestyle is associated with global variation of gut phageomes, most likely mediated by differences in the host gut microbiome. If the gut phageome is predominantly shaped by the bacterial composition, we would expect to observe strong correlation between the prevalence of VCs with that of their bacterial hosts. A clear example is the crAss-like family of gut phages, which can be divided into 10 phage genera (Guerin et al., 2018Guerin E. Shkoporov A. Stockdale S.R. Clooney A.G. Ryan F.J. Sutton T.D.S.

We discovered that the transmembrane domain of tyrosine kinase receptor 2 (TRKB), the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor that promotes neuronal plasticity and antidepressant responses, has a cholesterol-sensing function that mediates synaptic effects of cholesterol. We then found that both typical and fast-acting antidepressants directly bind to TRKB, thereby facilitating synaptic localization of TRKB and its activation by BDNF. Extensive computational approaches including atomistic molecular dynamics simulations revealed a binding site at the transmembrane region of TRKB dimers. Mutation of the TRKB antidepressant-binding motif impaired cellular, behavioral, and plasticity-promoting responses to antidepressants in vitro and in vivo. We suggest that binding to TRKB and allosteric facilitation of BDNF signaling is the common mechanism for antidepressant action, which may explain why typical antidepressants act slowly and how molecular effects of antidepressants are translated into clinical mood recovery.

We suggest that binding to TRKB and allosteric facilitation of BDNF signaling is the common mechanism for antidepressant action, which may explain why typical antidepressants act slowly and how molecular effects of antidepressants are translated into clinical mood recovery. Several targets for antidepressant (AD) drug action have been identified, but it is not clear how binding to these targets translates into clinical effects. Typical ADs such as tricyclic ADs (TCA), serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), increase the synaptic levels of monoamines by inhibiting their reuptake or metabolism, but it is unclear why their clinical effects are delayed, while the effects on monoamines are fast (Belmaker and Agam, 2008Belmaker R.H.

The rapid AD effect of ketamine (KET) is attributed to inhibition of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (Abdallah et al., 2015Abdallah C.G. Sanacora G. Duman R.S. Krystal J.H.

However, 2R,6R-hydroxynorketamine (R,R-HNK), a KET metabolite with AD-like activity, exhibits low affinity to NMDA receptors, which has called the role of NMDA receptors in the KET action into question (Zanos et al., 2016Zanos P.

Essentially all ADs, including KET and R,R-HNK, increase the expression and signaling of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) through neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor 2 (TRKB) (Autry and Monteggia, 2012Autry A.E.

The effects of SSRIs and KET on BDNF signaling have been considered to be indirect, through the inhibition of serotonin transporter (5HTT) and NMDA receptors, respectively. BDNF mimics the effects of ADs in rodents and inhibiting TRKB signaling prevents their behavioral effects (Duman and Monteggia, 2006Duman R.S. Monteggia L.M.

TRKB signaling is bidirectionally linked to brain cholesterol (CHOL) metabolism. BDNF promotes production of CHOL in neurons (Suzuki et al., 2007Suzuki S. Kiyosue K. Hazama S. Ogura A. Kashihara M.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1205-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). CHOL is essential for neuronal maturation and proper synaptic transmission (Martin et al., 2014Martin M.G. Ahmed T. Korovaichuk A. Venero C. Menchón S.A. Salas I. Munck S. Herreras O. Balschun D. Dotti C.G. Constitutive hippocampal cholesterol loss underlies poor cognition in old rodents.EMBO Mol.

CNS synaptogenesis promoted by glia-derived cholesterol.Science. 2001; 294: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar), but it does not pass the blood-brain barrier, therefore, neurons are dependent on CHOL synthesized by astrocytes and transported through an ApoE-mediated mechanism (Pfrieger and Ungerer, 2011Pfrieger F.W. Ungerer N. Cholesterol metabolism in neurons and astrocytes.Prog. Lipid Res. 2011; 50: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Synaptic CHOL levels are low during the embryonic and early postnatal life but strongly increase during the 3rd postnatal week in mice (Suzuki et al., 2004Suzuki S. Numakawa T. Shimazu K. Koshimizu H. Hara T. Hatanaka H. Mei L. Lu B. Kojima M. BDNF-induced recruitment of TrkB receptor into neuronal lipid rafts: roles in synaptic modulation.J.

Cell. 2016; 27: 3480-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which coincides with the increase in BDNF expression and appearance of ADs effects on TRKB (Di Lieto et al., 2012Di Lieto A.

The responsiveness of TrkB to BDNF and antidepressant drugs is differentially regulated during mouse development.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e32869Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Many ADs interact with phospholipids and accumulate in CHOL-rich membrane domains, such as lipid rafts (Erb et al., 2016Erb S.J. Schappi J.M. Rasenick M.M.

NMDAR-independent, cAMP-dependent antidepressant actions of ketamine.Mol. Psychiatry. 2019; 24: 1833-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These data prompted us to investigate the potential interactions between TRKB, CHOL, and ADs. We found that the TRKB transmembrane domain (TMD) senses changes in the cell membrane CHOL levels, and we elucidated its mechanism. Furthermore, we found that different AD drugs directly bind to a site formed by a dimer of TRKB TMDs, thereby facilitating cell surface expression of TRKB and promoting BDNF signaling. These data suggest that direct binding to TRKB and promotion of BDNF-mediated plasticity is a mechanism of action for AD drugs. CHOL is known to promote neuronal maturation and plasticity, but how it exerts these effects is unclear (Mauch et al., 2001Mauch D.H. Nägler K. Schumacher S. Göritz C. Müller E.C. Otto A. Pfrieger F.W. CNS synaptogenesis promoted by glia-derived cholesterol.Science. 2001; 294: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar; Pfrieger and Ungerer, 2011Pfrieger F.W. Ungerer N. Cholesterol metabolism in neurons and astrocytes.Prog. Lipid Res. 2011; 50: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). CHOL is proposed to interact with proteins through the so-called CHOL-recognition and alignment consensus (CRAC) domain or its inverted version CARC (Fantini et al., 2019Fantini J. Epand R.M. Barrantes F.J. Cholesterol-Recognition Motifs in Membrane Proteins.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2019; 1135: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We identified a CARC motif in the TRKB transmembrane (TM) region. This sequence is specific to TRKB and is not present in other TRK receptors (Figure 1A), suggesting that CHOL might directly interact with TRKB. Indeed, addition of CHOL at 20 μM to the culture media enhanced TRKB phosphorylation (pTRKB) by BDNF (10 ng/mL) in primary cortical neurons (Figure 1B). However, at higher concentrations (50–100 μM), CHOL suppressed the effects of BDNF (Figure 1B). CHOL promoted the interaction of TRKB, but not of TRKA, with phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) (Figures S1A–S1E), a critical mediator of TRKB intracellular signaling (Minichiello et al., 2002Minichiello L.

Mechanism of TrkB-mediated hippocampal long-term potentiation.Neuron. 2002; 36: 121-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and this effect was blocked by beta-cyclodextrin (βCDX), a CHOL-sequestering agent, at a dose that counteracts CHOL effects (Figures 1C and S1F). Microscale thermophoresis (MST) (Jerabek-Willemsen et al., 2014Jerabek-Willemsen M. André T. Wanner R. Roth H.M. Duhr S. Baaske P. Breitsprecher D.

We found that CHOL treatment increased cell surface translocation of TRKB (Figure S1C). The effects of BDNF on TRKB-PLC-γ1 interaction (Figure 1D) and on the neurite branching in cultured neurons (Figures S1G–S1K) were prevented by a CHOL synthesis inhibitor pravastatin (1 μM/3 days), as reported previously (Suzuki et al., 2004Suzuki S.

At 2 μM for 5 days, pravastatin reduced neuronal survival that was rescued by CHOL (20 μM), but not by BDNF (Figures S1L and S1M). Mutation of TRKB tyrosine 433, a predicted key residue in the CARC motif (Fantini and Barrantes, 2013Fantini J. Barrantes F.J.

Split luciferase protein complementation assay (Merezhko et al., 2020Merezhko M. Pakarinen E. Uronen R.-L. Huttunen H.J. Live-cell monitoring of protein localization to membrane rafts using protein-fragment complementation.Biosci.

Furthermore, BDNF-induced translocation of TRKB.Y433F to lipid rafts (Figure S2F) and its interaction with the raft-restricted FYN (Pereira and Chao, 2007Pereira D.B. Chao M.V. The tyrosine kinase Fyn determines the localization of TrkB receptors in lipid rafts.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was reduced when compared to the wild-type TRKB (Figure S2E). These data indicate that the Y433 in the TRKB CARC domain is important for BDNF-induced translocation of TRKB to lipid-raft regions on the neuronal surface, thereby promoting BDNF signaling. We next used atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the organization of TRKB TMD dimers (Table S1). Using a docking algorithm, we modeled five TMD dimer structures to initiate MD simulations, which showed that only one of them is stable in a phosphatidylcholine bilayer with 20–40 mol % CHOL. The stable structure features a cross-like conformation, where the two TMD helices interact at 439AXXXG443 (Figures 1G–1I), a GXXXG-like dimerization motif (Figure 1G) (Li et al., 2012Li E.

A similar cross-like conformation was proposed for the EGF receptor, where the distance between the C-termini of TMDs determines EGF signaling (Arkhipov et al., 2013Arkhipov A. Shan Y. Das R.

The average distance between the C termini of TRKB TMDs at CHOL concentrations of 0, 20, and 40 mol% was 19.4 Å, 14.3 Å, and 12.4 Å, respectively (Figure S3A). Additional simulations revealed that the conformation of TRKB TMD dimers is sensitive to CHOL. As the fixed-length hydrophobic TMD helices reduce their tilt to match the thicker membrane at higher CHOL concentration, the stable cross-like dimer conformation seen at 20 mol% CHOL switched to a more parallel conformation at 40 mol% (Figures 1H and 1I). The Y433F mutation induced a 40° rotation of the TMD helices relative to each other (Figure 1J). This compromises the contact at the 439AXXXG443 motif and reduces the C-terminal distance of the TMDs (Figures S3A and S3B). In TRKA, which has no CARC or GXXXG-like domains, different CHOL concentrations did not influence the TMD dimer conformation (Figure S3C). These findings are consistent with our experimental data showing an optimal CHOL concentration for TKRB function (Figure 1B), which is compromised as the TMD helices are separated at the C terminus at low CHOL concentration and adopt an unstable parallel TM orientation at high CHOL concentration (Figure S3A). Essentially all ADs promote TRKB signaling in rodents and this signaling is required for their behavioral effects (Castrén and Antila, 2017Castrén E. Antila H.

Many AD drugs are cationic amphipathic molecules that interact with phospholipids and accumulate at the lipid rafts (Chen et al., 2012Chen J. Korostyshevsky D. Lee S. Perlstein E.O.

We found that fluoxetine (FLX) and KET enhanced pTRKB at Y816 (Figure 2A) and FLX increased the surface expression of TRKB in primary cortical neurons (Figure 1F). FLX, imipramine, KET, and R,R-HNK increased TRKB interaction with PLC-γ1 and their effects were blocked by βCDX (Figures 1C and S1N–S1Q), which indicates that CHOL modulates AD-induced TRKB signaling. FLX partially rescued the reduction in BDNF-induced pTRKB response observed under high-CHOL (Figure 2B), suggesting that ADs promote TRKB signaling particularly in synaptic-like membranes rich in CHOL. We then tested if ADs directly bind to TRKB. First, we found that biotinylated FLX binds to immunoprecipitated TRKB with a low μM affinity (Kd = 2.42 μM) (Figure 2C), but not to TRKA or lysates from non-transfected cells (Figures S4L and S4M). Although the affinity of FLX to serotonin transporter (5HTT) is much higher than that to TRKB, micromolar affinity corresponds well to the concentrations of ADs reached in the human brain during chronic treatment (Bolo et al., 2000Bolo N.R.

Thus, WAMs may represent a potentially protective response required to clear degenerated myelin accumulating during white matter aging and disease. White matter is composed of mostly myelinated axons that connect neurons from different brain regions into functional circuits. The light appearance of white matter results from the high lipid content of myelin, a multilamellar membrane structure that coats axons and constitutes almost half of the dry weight of white matter (Stadelmann et al., 2019Stadelmann C.

Long thought to be a passive part of the brain, it is now clear that dynamic, experience-dependent generation of white matter myelin content by oligodendrocytes affects learning and brain function (McKenzie et al., 2014McKenzie I.A.

In humans, white matter volume reaches its peak at around 40–50 years of age, after which it declines continuously (Sowell et al., 2003Sowell E.R. Peterson B.S. Thompson P.M. Welcome S.E. Henkenius A.L. Toga A.W. Mapping cortical change across the human life span.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). White matter aging is not only associated with tissue shrinkage but also frequently with focal lesions seen upon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as hyperintensities related to cognitive impairment and increased risk of stroke and dementia (Prins and Scheltens, 2015Prins N.D. Scheltens P. White matter hyperintensities, cognitive impairment and dementia: an update.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2015; 11: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy studies performed in non-human primates have revealed that major pathological alterations that occur during aging are found in white but not gray matter (Peters, 2002Peters A. The effects of normal aging on myelin and nerve fibers: a review.J. Neurocytol. 2002; 31: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), consisting of myelin outfolding, splitting, and accumulation of multilamellar fragments (Peters, 2002Peters A.

Neurosci. 2016; 19: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). A better understanding of such age-related white matter pathology and its associated cellular responses is essential because aging is a major risk factor for the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. One cell population that responds to aging is microglia, long-lived, self-renewing cells with phagocytic scavenging and immune surveillance functions (Grabert et al., 2016Grabert K. Michoel T.

Gene expression studies have shown that aged microglia develop a more inflammatory phenotype, particularly in white matter (Poliani et al., 2015Poliani P.L. Wang Y. Fontana E. Robinette M.L.

Age-dependent increase in inflammatory status of microglia is often referred to as primed or sensitized, but the nature of this response is only partially understood (Perry and Holmes, 2014Perry V.H.

This work has established that microglia undergo a relatively stereotypical conversion into disease-associated microglia (DAM) with a microglia-neurodegenerative (MGnD) or activated response microglia (ARM) phenotype (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017Keren-Shaul H.

This conversion is dependent on TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) activity, which increases phagocytosis and lipid metabolism. DAMs have the potential to restrict pathology by enhancing clearance of misfolded and aggregated proteins that commonly accumulate in neurodegenerative diseases, but to what extent DAMs/MGnD/ARMs are also generated during normal aging is under debate (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017Keren-Shaul H.

Because aging-induced damage to the brain involves degeneration of myelinated nerve fibers, not characterized by protein aggregates but by release of lipid-rich, tightly compacted, and difficult-to-digest myelin debris, we hypothesized that microglial responses should differ between aged gray and white matter. To characterize this microglial response, we combined genetic perturbation, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), immunohistochemistry, and functional assays to comprehensively characterize microglial responses that occur in aged white matter. To characterize this microglial response, we took advantage of scRNA-seq, a powerful and sensitive technique to reveal transcriptomic cell-to-cell variation of microglia in the normal and diseased brain (Hammond et al., 2019Hammond T.R.

To avoid isolation artifacts, we established an automated dissociation protocol for microglia that inhibits ex vivo transcription by addition of actinomycin D (ActD) (Wu et al., 2017Wu Y.E. Pan L.

Using scRNA-seq, we tested the effect of ActD addition, which was able to prevent significant induction of four genes (Jun, Lars2, Gm23935, and CT010467.1) and of average expression of immediate-early genes known to respond to brain dissociation (Wu et al., 2017Wu Y.E.

Using this optimized protocol, we dissociated gray matter from the frontal cortex and white matter tracts from the corpus callosum as well as the optical tracts and the medial lemniscus from wild-type aged mice (18–20 months old; Figure 1A). To compare aging and neurodegeneration effects on microglia, we also isolated microglia from a transgenic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) mouse model that expresses five human familial AD gene mutations (5×FAD) (Oakley et al., 2006Oakley H.

After eliminating low-quality SS2 libraries, we included 1,038 microglia from 16 mice. Analysis of sorting data showed that aged wild-type white matter immune cells had significantly increased levels of CD45+ and CD11b+ labeling compared with gray matter, which was not observed in aged Trem2−/− animals (Figures S1D–S1F). Based on known immune cell markers, we identified 847 high-quality SS2 scRNA-seq microglia from aged mice and cells expressing markers for granulocytes, perivascular macrophages, and oligodendrocytes, which were excluded from downstream analyses (Figures S1I and S1J). Next we analyzed the transcriptomes of single cells using unsupervised uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis, a dimension reduction method, which separated aged white matter from aged gray matter microglia (Figure S1K). This white matter microglia-specific cluster was defined by a specific gene signature (STAR methods; Figure S1K; Table S2). Using this white matter microglia gene signature, we distinguished four distinct populations: two white matter-specific clusters, which we called white matter associated microglia (WAMs) and activated microglia, and two additional clusters found in gray and white matter, which we called homeostatic microglia 1 and 2 (Figures 1B–1E; Figure S2A; Table S2). Comparing wild-type with Trem2−/− mice revealed that WAMs and activated microglia are TREM2 dependent (Figure 1E; Figure S2A). WAMs are characterized by downregulation of homeostatic genes (set 4 genes; Figure 1C; Figure S3A), such as purinergic receptor (P2ry12 and P2ry13) and checkpoint genes (Csfr1r, Cx3cr1, Hexb, and Tmem119) and by upregulation of DAM-associated genes (set 1 genes; Figure 1C; Figure S2A), such as lipid metabolism and phagosome-related genes (ApoE, Cst7, Bm2, Lyz2, Cd63, and Clec7a), cathepsins (Ctsb, Ctss, and Ctsz), and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-related genes (H2-D1 and H2-K1). Activated microglia are marked by upregulation of genes encoding many metabolic genes, mostly ribosomal subunits and mitochondrial genes (set 2 genes), many of which are part of the microglial response to aging (Ximerakis et al., 2019Ximerakis M. Lipnick S.L. Innes B.T. Simmons S.K. Adiconis X. Dionne D. Mayweather B.A. Nguyen L. Niziolek Z. Ozek C. et al.Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of the aging mouse brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2019; 22: 1696-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (set 2 genes; Figures 1C and 1D; Figure S2A). Homeostatic microglia 1 and 2 were detected in white and gray matter and differed from WAMs by higher expression of homeostatic genes such as Tmem119, Csf1r, Cx3cr1, Hexb, and Tmem119 (set 4 genes; Figure 1C; Figure S2A) and lower expression of genes linked to the DAM signature, such as ApoE, Cst7, Bm2, Lyz2, Cd63, Clec7a, Ctsb, Ctss, Ctsz, H2-D1, and H2-K1 (set 1 genes; Figure 1C; Figure S2A). To validate our results, we performed droplet-based scRNA-seq (Drop-seq) on 24-month-old mice (21,197 high-quality cells from 17 mice used in five Drop-seq runs; Figures 2A and 2B ; Figures S2B and S2C; Table S1, tab “Current Study-10X”). We partitioned cells into major cell types (Figure 2B), revealing the white and gray matter cellular landscapes (Figure 2C). The distribution of ciliated and secretary ependymal cells between white and gray matter validated our microdissection because these cells were located on the corpus callosum surface. Using the white matter signature genes, we again identified a continuous range of microglia that reproduced the four microglia clusters of the SS2 scRNA-seq dataset (Figure 2D). The gene expression profiles of all four microglia clusters were very similar in both scRNA-seq datasets. None of the 5,991 microglia from the frontal cortex were identified as WAMs, validating allocation of WAMs to aged white matter (Figures 2E–2G). The activated microglia population was enriched in white matter but was also detected in gray matter. The difference in activated microglia distribution in the SS2 and Drop-seq datasets might be due to the different age points analyzed (18–20 versus 24 months) or the higher cell number in the Drop-seq dataset (Figure 2G). Using the Drop-seq dataset, we compared activated microglia with WAMs (Figures 2H and 2I) and identified 428 transcripts that were differentially expressed (Figure 2H). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of the upregulated genes showed that ribosomes were the top enriched pathway in activated microglia. The most enriched pathway in WAMs was hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) signaling, lysosomal, and cholesterol pathways (Figure 2I). To address whether the WAM signature is aging dependent, we isolated microglia and other myeloid cells from the corpus callosum (white matter) and frontal cortex (gray matter) of 4- and 21-month-old wild-type mice using CD11b microbeads and performed bulk RNA-seq analysis. Pathway analysis showed that genes involved in immune cell function were among the most upregulated pathways in aged white matter (Figure S2E). Microglia in aging gray matter did not show these changes in immune cell function but instead exhibited alterations in pathways involved in ion channel activity (Figure S2F). When comparing the genes expressed differentially in aged white matter compared with young white matter or aged gray matter CD11b+ cells, 39 transcripts were identified that overlapped with WAM signature genes, such as Lgals3, Spp1, Cst7, Lpl, Clec7a, Itgax, and ApoE (Figures S2G and S2H; Table S3), suggesting that WAM marker genes increase with aging in the white matter. Because recent scRNA-seq studies have analyzed microglia during normal brain aging without reporting WAMs, we re-analyzed these existing datasets (Hammond et al., 2019Hammond T.R. Dufort C.

We identified microglia with gene expression patterns nearly identical to WAMs (Figure 3A).

We targeted the shared IL-12Rβ1/p40 interface to design a panel of IL-12 partial agonists that preserved interferon gamma (IFNγ) induction by CD8+ T cells but impaired cytokine production from natural killer (NK) cells in vitro. These cell-biased properties were recapitulated in vivo, where IL-12 partial agonists elicited anti-tumor immunity to MC-38 murine adenocarcinoma absent the NK-cell-mediated toxicity seen with wild-type IL-12. Thus, the structural mechanism of receptor sharing used by IL-12 family cytokines provides a protein interface blueprint for tuning this cytokine axis for therapeutics."

This prevalent stress response was detected in published datasets across a range of tissues, demonstrating high conservation but also a significant degree of data distortion in single-cell reference atlases. Using quiescent muscle stem cells as a paradigm of cell activation following injury, we captured early cell activation following muscle injury and found that an essential ERK1/2 primary proliferation signal precedes initiation of the Notch-regulated myogenic program. This study defines initial events in response to tissue perturbation and identifies a broadly conserved transcriptional stress response that acts in parallel with cell-specific adaptive alterations."

The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was also recognized as having a bat origin because MERS-CoV and two MERS-CoV-related viruses from bats could utilize human or bat dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for cell entry (14Raj V.S.

Therefore, in this study, we systemically evaluated the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect nonsusceptible HEK293T cells utilizing ACE2 proteins from nine different animal species and humans to determine its possible origin and to further explore its cross-species transmission. Our findings provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is able to engage the ACE2 receptor of different species, which poses a very large challenge to determine the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 for the control and prevention of coronaviruses in the future. Furthermore, we found a natural isoform of ACE2 in Macaca mulatta (rhesus monkey; RhACE2) with the Y217N mutation, which was resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this amino acid residue is a novel critical determinant of the ability of ACE2 to mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry. To investigate which animal ACE2 proteins could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry, we synthesized full-length cDNA fragments of ACE2 from 11 animal species as well as from humans. These species were R. sinicus (Chinese rufous horseshoe bat), Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (greater horseshoe bat), Felis catus (domestic cat), Capra hircus (goat), Canis lupus familiaris (dog), Sus scrofa (wild pig), Manis javanica (Malayan pangolin), Gallus gallus (red junglefowl), Notechis scutatus (mainland tiger snake), Mus musculus (house mouse), M. mulatta (rhesus monkey), and Homo sapiens (human). Synthesized cDNA fragments were then subcloned into the pCAGGS-HA vector for expression in eukaryotic cells. The origins and GenBank accession numbers of these ACE2 molecules are listed in the Table 1. We first compared the nucleotide sequence of the ACE2 coding region of these 11 animals with that of humans. The sequence similarities of these ACE2 cDNAs are exhibited in the Table 1. Among these sequences, the sequence of RhACE2 was the most similar to that of human ACE2 (hACE2), and in contrast, the sequence of mainland tiger snake ACE2 was the least similar (Fig. 1A). It has been reported that two virus-binding hotspots, K31 and K353 in hACE2, are critical for SARS-CoV infection (17Li F.

In this study, we found that K31 was not conserved in ACE2 of all 11 animal species observed in this study.

Open table in a new tab Next, we tested whether ACE2 of the 11 animal species was able to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry to nonsusceptible HEK 293T cell lines. Different ACE2 proteins were expressed in HEK 293T cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Plasmids expressing hACE2 and mouse ACE2 were applied as the positive and negative controls of the entry assay, respectively. The infection ratio varied according to the ACE2 protein expressed (Fig. 1C). As expected, hACE2 supported SARS-CoV-2 entry, whereas mouse ACE2 did not (Fig. 1C). One previous study indicated that the SARS-CoV outbreak 17 years ago originated from Rhinolophus affinis (intermediate horseshoe bat) (12Ge X.Y. Li J.L. Yang X.L. Chmura A.A. Zhu G. Epstein J.H.

Zhu Y. et al.Isolation and characterization of a bat SARS-like coronavirus that uses the ACE2 receptor.Nature. 2013; 503: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). A recent study further demonstrated that ACE2 of R. sinicus (Chinese rufous horseshoe bat) allowed both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV entry (1Zhou P. Yang X.L. Wang X.G. Hu B. Zhang L. Zhang W. Si H.R. Zhu Y. Li B. Huang C.L. Chen H.D. Chen J. Luo Y. Guo H. Jiang R.D. et al.A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin.Nature. 2020; 579: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (13521) Google Scholar). In this study, we were not able to synthesize the ACE2 cDNA of R. affinis due to the absence of its sequence. Therefore, we synthesized the ACE2 cDNA of R. sinicus and R. ferrumequinum (greater horseshoe bat) to test whether ACE2 of other bat species was responsible for the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, we found that the ACE2 of R. ferrumequinum did not support SARS-CoV-2 entry but R. sinicus did (Fig. 1C), suggesting that not all species of bat are sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A recent study indicated that SARS-CoV-2 did not replicate and shed in dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks but replicated fairly well in ferrets and replicated effectively in cats (6Shi J. Wen Z. Zhong G. Yang H. Wang C. Huang B. Liu R. He X. Shuai L. Sun Z. Zhao Y. Liu P. Liang L. Cui P. Wang J. et al.Susceptibility of ferrets, cats, dogs, and other domesticated animals to SARS-coronavirus 2.Science. 2020; 368: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Our study demonstrated that cat ACE2 supported viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1C). Although pigs, dogs, and chickens are not sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we know little about the molecular mechanisms and role of receptor avidity in resistance. Our data demonstrated that the ACE2 protein of dogs and pigs supported SARS-CoV-2 entry similar to that of cats. There is a debate regarding if SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats or pangolins (1Zhou P.

Probable pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 associated with the COVID-19 outbreak.Curr. Biol. 2020; 30: 1346-1351.e2Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that bat ACE2 mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry (1Zhou P. Yang X.L. Wang X.G. Hu B. Zhang L. Zhang W. Si H.R. Zhu Y. Li B. Huang C.L. Chen H.D. Chen J. Luo Y. Guo H. Jiang R.D. et al.A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin.Nature. 2020; 579: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (13521) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expressed ACE2 in M. javanica (Malayan pangolins) and tested its role in conferring susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrated that pangolin ACE2 could mediate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1C). Finally, we demonstrated that ACE2 of N. scutatus (mainland tiger snake) could not support SARS-CoV-2 entry as previously predicted (19Ji W. Wang W. Zhao X. Zai J. Li X. Cross-species transmission of the newly identified coronavirus 2019-nCoV.J. Med. Virol. 2020; 92: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Snakes may not be the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2. Old world monkeys (M. mulatta (rhesus monkey) and Macaca fascicularis (crab-eating macaque)) were used as experimental animal models for SARS-CoV-2 infection (20Lu S. Zhao Y. Yu W. Yang Y. Gao J. Wang J. Kuang D. Yang M. Yang J. Ma C. Xu J. Qian X. Li H. Zhao S. Li J. et al.Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 infections among 3 species of non-human primates.bioRxiv. 2020; Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that RhACE2 in our study did not support SARS-CoV-2 entry, as expected (Fig. 1C). By investigating the monkey ACE2 sequence, we found that the ACE2 isoform of rhesus monkey cloned in our study contained two natural variations (R192G and Y217N) (Fig. 2A). When we reverted the Y217N mutation to N217Y (wild-type sequence of ACE2) in RhACE2, RhACE2 with N217Y had the ability to support SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 2B). We noticed that Y217 was conserved in the other species investigated in this study (data not shown), which suggests that residue Y217 is a key residue for SARS-CoV-2 entry. To further confirm this hypothesis, we constructed hACE2 with the Y217N mutation and found that this mutation completely blocked SARS-CoV-2 entry, as expected (Fig. 2B). Potential asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation may influence virus and receptor binding; however, when we analyzed the sequence, we found that ACE2 N217 was not a potential N-linked glycosylation site (N-X-T/S motif). We further constructed an RhACE2 with the N217Q mutation, and this mutation did not facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry (Fig. 2B). This further demonstrated that the ability of N217 blocking viral entry is not due to N-linked glycosylation of this residue. A previous study indicated that the natural mutation of Y217N in RhACE2 dramatically alters RhACE2 expression and reduces the efficiency of SARS-CoV entry (21Chen Y. Liu L. Wei Q. Zhu H. Jiang H. Tu X. Qin C. Chen Z. Rhesus angiotensin converting enzyme 2 supports entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in Chinese macaques.Virology. 2008; 381: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the current study, we illustrated that both hACE2 and RhACE2 Y217N expressed as well as the corresponding wild-type ACE2 proteins (Fig. 2C). Next, we used the RBD as a probe to examine receptor-binding ability by using IFA. We performed an RBD binding assay and found that wild-type hACE2 potently bound the RBD, as expected (Fig. 3A); however, hACE2 Y217N, RhACE2 Y217N, and RhACE2 Y217Q almost lost the ability to bind the RBD (Fig. 3A). Receptor-binding ability was further confirmed and quantified by western blotting (Fig. 3B). Since the conformation of a recombinant RBD may not completely reflect its native conformation within an entire envelope glycoprotein, we also investigated ACE2 binding with more relevant systems of the full-length S (spike) protein, and we obtained a similar result as for the RBD (Fig. 3, C and D). The above data demonstrated that the Y217 residue of ACE2 significantly reduced the binding ability of the RBD and spike protein. To test whether position 217 of ACE2 influenced its RBD binding activities is due to N217 disrupting the interaction between ACE2 and RBD, we used homology-based structural modeling to analyze the effects of residue substitutions at position 217. Structural models of Y217N were generated based on the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 complex (22Lan J. Ge J. Yu J. Shan S. Zhou H. Fan S. Zhang Q. Shi X. Wang Q. Zhang L. Wang X.

Aihara H. Geng Q. Auerbach A. Li F. Structural basis of receptor recognition by SARS-CoV-2.Nature. 2020; 581: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar). We found that position 217 was not located at the interaction domain with RBD; furthermore, the predicted model of residue substitutions at position 217 seemed to have no influence on the interaction between ACE2 and RBD (Fig. 4). Overall, structural modeling analysis demonstrated that the substitutions at position 217 in ACE2 did not influence its corresponding receptor activities. To enter into cells, viruses need to first interact with the corresponding receptor at the cell surface; therefore, we tested the possibility that ACE2 Y217N fails to mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry due to a change in the cell surface localization of ACE2 induced by the Y217N mutation. To test this hypothesis, HEK 293T cells were first transfected with the indicated plasmids. Forty-eight hours later, the transfected cells were detached from the plate and then stained with a FITC-labeled anti-ACE2 antibody. We found that both wild-type hACE2 and RhACE2 Y217N were strongly positive for FITC, whereas the other mutants were weakly positive (Fig. 5A). To confirm that this difference was not due to transfection efficacy, the transfected cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 and then stained with ACE2. The results indicated that all cells transfected with different ACE2 molecules were labeled with FITC at a high level (Fig. 5B).This demonstrated that RhACE2 Y217N failed to mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry, mainly due to its cell surface localization. The spike (S) protein features of coronaviruses and lysosomal proteases of hosts determine the tropism of coronaviruses (24Zheng Y. Shang J. Yang Y. Liu C. Wan Y. Geng Q. Wang M. Baric R. Li F. Lysosomal proteases are a determinant of coronavirus tropism.J. Virol. 2018; 92: e01504-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To date, the bat coronavirus RaTG13 in R. affinis (intermediate horseshoe bat) from Yunnan Province exhibits the highest sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2 (1Zhou P. Yang X.L. Wang X.G. Hu B. Zhang L.

In this study, we found that ACE2 of R. ferrumequinum (greater horseshoe bat) failed to mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry, whereas ACE2 of R. sinicus (Chinese rufous horseshoe bat) facilitated SARS-CoV-2 entry to nonsusceptible cells. In fact, in contrast to genetically homologous hACE2, bat ACE2 proteins have great genetic diversity (13Hou Y. Peng C. Yu M. Li Y. Han Z. Li F. Wang L.F. Shi Z.

A number of ACE2 molecules isolated from different bat species failed to mediate SARS-CoV entry (13Hou Y. Peng C. Yu M. Li Y. Han Z. Li F. Wang L.F. Shi Z.

These results suggest that analysis of the receptor-conferred susceptibility to virus entry is important before investigating the origin of SARS-CoV-2.

Here we demonstrate that during a mouse visual attention task, ACA neurons projecting to the visual cortex (VIS; ACAVIS neurons) are recruited selectively by recent errors. Optogenetic manipulations of this pathway collectively support the model that rhythmic modulation of ACAVIS neurons in anticipation of visual stimuli is crucial for adjusting performance following errors. 30-Hz optogenetic stimulation of ACAVIS neurons in anesthetized mice recapitulates the increased gamma and reduced theta VIS oscillatory changes that are associated with endogenous post-error performance during behavior and subsequently increased visually evoked spiking, a hallmark feature of visual attention. This frontal sensory neural circuit links error monitoring with implementing adjustments of attention to guide behavioral adaptation, pointing to a circuit-based mechanism for promoting cognitive control."

It is unclear if immune responses facilitate lipid breakdown and release from adipocytes via lipolysis in a separate way from hormones or adrenergic signals. We found that an ancient component of ER stress, inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1), discriminates inflammation-induced adipocyte lipolysis versus lipolysis from adrenergic or hormonal stimuli. Our data show that inhibiting IRE1 kinase activity was sufficient to block adipocyte-autonomous lipolysis from multiple inflammatory ligands, including bacterial components, certain cytokines, and thapsigargin-induced ER stress. IRE1-mediated lipolysis was specific for inflammatory triggers since IRE1 kinase activity was dispensable for isoproterenol and cAMP-induced lipolysis in adipocytes and mouse adipose tissue. IRE1 RNase activity was not associated with inflammation-induced adipocyte lipolysis. Inhibiting IRE1 kinase activity blocked NF-κB activation, interleukin-6 secretion, and adipocyte-autonomous lipolysis from inflammatory ligands. Inflammation-induced lipolysis mediated by IRE1 occurred independently from changes in insulin signaling in adipocytes, suggesting that inflammation can promote IRE1-mediated lipolysis independent of adipocyte insulin resistance. We found no role for canonical unfolded protein responses or ABL kinases in linking ER stress to IRE1-mediated lipolysis. Adiponectin-Cre-mediated IRE1 knockout in mice showed that adipocyte IRE1 was required for inflammatory ligand-induced lipolysis in adipose tissue explants and that adipocyte IRE1 was required for approximately half of the increase in blood triglycerides after a bacterial endotoxin-mediated inflammatory stimulus in vivo. Together, our results show that IRE1 propagates an inflammation-specific lipolytic program independent from hormonal or adrenergic regulation.

Some consequences of obesity are underpinned by compartmentalized immune responses in tissues that participate in metabolic regulation (3McPhee J.B. Schertzer J.D.

For example, inflammation of metabolic tissues can manifest as insulin resistance (8Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. Obesity and insulin resistance.J. Clin.

Excessive lipolysis can result in the accumulation of ectopic lipids in the liver and skeletal muscles, which can subsequently contribute to systemic insulin resistance (25Olefsky J.M. Fat Talks, liver and muscle Listen.Cell. 2008; 134: 914-916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Increased lipolysis during obesity is often formulated in terms of adipocyte insulin resistance. However, inflammation-induced lipolysis can occur independently of changes in insulin action (17Zu L. He J. Jiang H. Xu C. Pu S. Xu G. Bacterial endotoxin stimulates adipose lipolysis via Toll-like receptor 4 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway.J. Biol.

Biochem. 2003; 89: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). More importantly, it is unclear if certain cellular triggers are specific to inflammation-induced lipolysis compared with adrenergic control of lipolysis, which governs adipocyte metabolism and lipid flux via catecholamines and other hormones. We hypothesized that only inflammation engaged ancient endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses to provoke lipolysis, independently of adrenergic or hormonal influence on lipolysis, including insulin resistance. Seminal work discovered how components of the ER stress response link inflammation to defects in glucose and lipid metabolism (27Ozcan U. Cao Q. Yilmaz E. Lee A.-H. Iwakoshi N.N. Ozdelen E. Tuncman G. Görgün C. Glimcher L.H. Hotamisligil G.S.

Endoplasmic reticulum stress and the inflammatory Basis of metabolic disease.Cell. 2010; 140: 900-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). For example, nitrosylation of inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1) can compromise the unfolded protein response (UPR) and promote insulin resistance in obese mice (29Yang L. Calay E.S. Fan J. Arduini A. Kunz R.C. Gygi S.P. Yalcin A. Fu S. Hotamisligil G.S. METABOLISM. S-Nitrosylation links obesity-associated inflammation to endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction.Science. 2015; 349: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). ER stress components include IRE1, activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK). Much of the work on metabolic disease and ER stress has focussed on the UPR aspects of these components. For example, IRE1 can integrate stress signals from changes in cellular metabolism and nutrient levels coincident with overload of misfolded proteins (30Huang S. Xing Y. Liu Y. Emerging roles for the ER stress sensor IRE1 in metabolic regulation and disease.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 18726-18741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We questioned whether ER stress could propagate stress from inflammatory cues into a lipolytic program in adipocytes and whether the UPR or other kinases were involved. There is evidence that ER stress can promote adipocyte lipolysis coincident with elevated cAMP and activation of protein kinase A (PKA) (31Deng J. Liu S. Zou L. Xu C. Geng B. Xu G. Lipolysis response to endoplasmic reticulum stress in adipose cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 6240-6249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Further, ER stress can engage extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)2 to promote hormone sensitive lipase (HSL)-mediated lipolysis (31Deng J. Liu S. Zou L. Xu C. Geng B. Xu G. Lipolysis response to endoplasmic reticulum stress in adipose cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 6240-6249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, it is not known if inflammation uses a specific component of ER stress or a specific kinase to propagate lipolysis. Inflammatory triggers of lipolysis may engage an ER stress component, since bacterial LPS and PGN engage ERK2 and other kinases to promote lipolysis in adipocytes (17Zu L. He J. Jiang H. Xu C. Pu S. Xu G. Bacterial endotoxin stimulates adipose lipolysis via Toll-like receptor 4 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5915-5926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Chi W. Dao D. Lau T.C. Henriksbo B.D. Cavallari J.F. Foley K.P. Schertzer J.D. Bacterial peptidoglycan stimulates adipocyte lipolysis via NOD1.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e97675Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has also shown that ERK2 promoted serine 247 phosphorylation and activation of the Beta3 adrenoreceptor and increased adipocyte lipolysis during obesity (32Hong S. Song W. Zushin P.-J.H. Liu B. Jedrychowski M.P. Mina A.I. Deng Z. Cabarkapa D. Hall J.A. Palmer C.J. Aliakbarian H. Szpyt J. Gygi S.P. Tavakkoli A. Lynch L. et al.Phosphorylation of Beta-3 adrenergic receptor at serine 247 by ERK MAP kinase drives lipolysis in obese adipocytes.Mol. Metab. 2018; 12: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This seminal work showed that adrenergic stimuli engaged an ERK2-mediated stress response to promote lipolysis (32Hong S. Song W. Zushin P.-J.H. Liu B. Jedrychowski M.P. Mina A.I. Deng Z. Cabarkapa D. Hall J.A. Palmer C.J. Aliakbarian H. Szpyt J. Gygi S.P. Tavakkoli A.

Metab. 2018; 12: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, kinases can communicate with adrenergic responses to promote lipolysis. However, it is not clear if inflammatory triggers of lipolysis, such as bacteria or cytokines, require a specific kinase linked to the ER stress response to promote lipolysis. This is relevant to metabolic disease since there are links between ER stress, inflammation, and increased lipolysis during obesity. We sought to define if a kinase inherent to ER stress components discriminates immune versus hormonal regulation of lipolysis. It is known that knockdown of IRE1 mitigates fasting-induced lipolysis in C. elegans (33Jo H. Shim J. Lee J.H. Lee J. Kim J.B. IRE-1 and HSP-4 contribute to Energy Homeostasis via fasting-induced lipases in <em>C. elegans</em>.Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 440-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here, we report that IRE1 was necessary for inflammation-induced lipolysis in adipocytes. We then questioned whether lipolysis was linked to the kinase activity of IRE1 or the canonical ER stress response regulated by IRE1. IRE1 is well known to promote endoribonuclease (RNase) cleavage of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA resulting in spliced XBP1 in response to luminal overload of unfolded proteins (34Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. XBP1 mRNA is induced by ATF6 and spliced by IRE1 in response to ER stress to Produce a highly active transcription factor.Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). Spliced XBP1 tips the balance away from lipogenesis toward lipolysis by augmenting macrolipophagy in the liver (35Herrema H. Zhou Y. Zhang D. Lee J. Salazar Hernandez M.A. Shulman G.I. Ozcan U. XBP1s is an anti-lipogenic protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 17394-17404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Little is known about IRE1 in adipose tissue lipolysis or a potential independent role for IRE1 kinase activity in lipid metabolism. There is a growing interest in the kinase activity of IRE1 in linking inflammation and metabolism and as a therapeutic target (30Huang S. Xing Y. Liu Y. Emerging roles for the ER stress sensor IRE1 in metabolic regulation and disease.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 18726-18741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 36Harnoss J.M. Le Thomas A. Shemorry A. Marsters S.A. Lawrence D.A. Lu M. Chen Y.-C.A. Qing J.

Sci. 2019; 116: 16420-16429Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The kinase and RNase activities of IRE1 can have opposing roles in ER stress responses to specific stressors such as viral replication (37Su A. Wang H. Li Y. Wang X. Chen D. Wu Z. Opposite roles of RNase and kinase activities of inositol-requiring Enzyme 1 (IRE1) on HSV-1 replication.Viruses. 2017; 9: 235Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We tested if IRE1 propagated inflammation-rated metabolic dysfunction in adipocytes and determined if the UPR-RNase activity or kinase activity of IRE1 transmitted inflammation or adrenergic-specific signals into increased lipolysis in adipose tissue. We found that IRE1 kinase activity regulates inflammation-specific lipolysis without engaging canonical ER stress signaling involving IRE1 RNase. Inflammatory triggers of adipocyte lipolysis engage IRE1 kinase in a response that is separate from adrenergic or hormonal triggers of lipolysis. To determine if ER stress propagated adipocyte lipolysis from an inflammatory stimulus, differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with or without 10 μg/ml NOD1 ligand (FK565) and increasing concentrations of the chemical chaperons TUDCA or 4-PBA (Fig. 1, A and B). We have previously determined the dose–response relationship of FK565 on lipolysis (18Chi W. Dao D. Lau T.C. Henriksbo B.D. Cavallari J.F. Foley K.P. Schertzer J.D. Bacterial peptidoglycan stimulates adipocyte lipolysis via NOD1.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e97675Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). FK565, a synthetic mimetic of bacterial cell wall PGN typical of Gram-negative bacteria, stimulated an approximately fivefold increase in glycerol release rate, which was dose-dependently inhibited by TUDCA and 4-PBA (Fig. 1, A and B). These results indicate that some aspect of ER stress participates in bacterial cell wall stimulated adipocyte lipolysis. We next examined if ER stress was required for induction of lipolysis with multiple inflammatory ligands compared with lipolysis caused by the adrenergic stimulus, isoproterenol. We used the inflammatory stimuli PGN (FK565 10 μg/L = NOD1 activation), LPS (500 ng/ml = TLR4 activation), TNF (10 ng/ml = paracrine cytokine), or thapsigargin (1 μM = ER stress activation), all of which increased the glycerol release rate in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The increased lipolysis from all of these stimuli was blocked by 1 mg/ml TUDCA (Fig. 1C). However, glycerol release induced by the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (2 μM) was not altered by TUDCA (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that ER stress may discriminate lipolysis from inflammation compared with catecholamines. We next tested the sensitivity of FK565, thapsigargin, and isoproterenol stimulated lipolysis to ATGL inhibition using Atglistatin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Inhibition of ATGL with Atglistatin blocked lipolysis induced by each of these ligands, confirming that glycerol release marked canonical activation of an ATGL-sensitive lipolytic program in adipocytes (Fig. 1D). IRE1 has been shown to link ER stress to NOD1/2-mediated immune responses (38Keestra-Gounder A.M. Byndloss M.X. Seyffert N. Young B.M. Chávez-Arroyo A. Tsai A.Y. Cevallos S.A. Winter M.G. Pham O.H. Tiffany C.R. de Jong M.F. Kerrinnes T. Ravindran R. Luciw P.A.

LRRK2 enhances Nod1/2-mediated inflammatory cytokine production by promoting Rip2 phosphorylation.Protein Cell. 2017; 8: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We examined if IRE1 was the component of ER stress required for lipolysis stimulated by multiple inflammatory factors compared with adrenergic/hormonal pathways. Glycerol release was measured in 3T3-L1 cells treated with KirA6, an IRE1 kinase inhibitor (which also attenuates RNase activity), or one of two IRE1 RNase inhibitors, KirA8 and 4μ8C (Fig. 2, A–C). KirA6 dose-dependently lowered PGN-mediated lipolysis, where 1 μM KirA6 blocked an increase in lipolysis (Fig. 2A). KirA8 and 4μ8C did not lower glycerol release (Fig. 2, B and C). We also confirmed that 10 μM KirA8 blocked the RNase activity of IRE1 evinced by lower levels of spliced XBP1 in adipocytes treated with thapsigargin (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that IRE1 kinase activity (but not RNase activity) propagates inflammation-induced adipocyte lipolysis from a bacterial cell wall component. To test the role of IRE1 in mediating lipolysis induced by other inflammatory ligands, differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were treated with or without the IRE1 inhibitor KirA6 (1 μM) for 1 h before treatment with the inflammatory stimuli PGN, LPS, TNF, or thapsigargin. KirA6 completely blocked lipolysis stimulated by each of these inflammatory stimuli (Fig. 2E). In contrast, KirA6 did not inhibit lipolysis stimulated by the hormonal stimulus isoproterenol (2 μM) (Fig. 2E). We also confirmed that KirA6 did not change 8-Br-cAMP-induced lipolysis in adipocytes (Fig. 2F). These data demonstrate that IRE1 kinase activity is required for inflammatory, but not adrenergic-cAMP-stimulated, lipolysis in adipocytes. We next examined IRE1 phosphorylation at Serine-724 (to biomark kinase activity) and transcript levels of key UPR intermediates (that are regulated by RNase activity). Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with PGN or thapsigargin for 3 h increased the levels of phosphorylated IRE1 (S724) relative to total levels of IRE1 (tIRE1) in 3T3 adipocytes, an effect that was inhibited by 1 μM KirA6 (Fig. 2, G and H). After this same 3-h treatment, thapsigargin, but not PGN or isoproterenol, increased the expression of BiP, CHOP, and sXBP1 (Fig. 2, I–K). These data show that neither bacterial ligand (i.e., PGN) nor adrenergic stimulus (isoproterenol) increases ER stress markers typical of the UPR in adipocytes. Further, the increase in expression of BiP and CHOP induced by thapsigargin was sensitive to KirA6, whereas higher levels of spliced XBP1 (sXBP1), a key target of IRE1 RNase activity, were not affected by KirA6. These data support the concept that IRE1 kinase activity rather than RNase activity regulates lipolysis induced by inflammatory, but not hormonal, stimuli, independent of canonical UPR signaling in adipocytes. We next measured glycerol release in mouse-derived epididymal adipose tissue explants. Adipose tissue from wild-type (WT) C57Bl6/J mice showed that PGN (10 μg/ml) and isoproterenol (2 μM) increased glycerol release, but only the increased lipolysis caused by PGN was inhibited by KirA6 (Fig. 3, A and B). KirA6 did not alter isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis in adipose tissue (Fig. 3B). We then tested if the canonical UPR was involved in ER stress or IRE1-related lipolysis using Grp78+/- and WT littermate mice. We found that neither TUDCA nor KirA6 altered glycerol release in adipose tissue explants derived from Grp78+/- mice, which had comparable lipolysis to WT mice (Fig. 3C). These data support our observations in 3T3-L1 adipocytes that IRE1 regulates lipolysis induced by inflammation independent of canonical UPR signaling and that IRE1 does not alter lipolysis from adrenergic stimuli in adipose tissue. Finally, we generated mice with adipocyte-specific knockout of IRE1 (Ern1 gene), where protein levels of IRE1 were lower/absent in adipocytes from epididymal white adipose tissue (epiWAT), but not in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), liver, or muscle from these mice (Fig. 3D). Adipose tissue explants from these IRE1 adipocyte-specific knockout mice (AKO) had lower glycerol release in response to thapsigargin or LPS when compared with floxed control littermate mice (Fig. 3, E and F). This data reinforces our findings using chemical inhibitors of IRE1 (i.e., KirA6) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and provides direct genetic evidence that IRE1 mediates lipolysis induced by inflammatory or bacterial ligands in mouse adipose tissue. Finally, we tested the requirement for adipocyte IRE1 to regulate lipolysis after an inflammatory stress in vivo. We measured the time course of changes in serum lipids after LPS injection in AKO mice and floxed control littermate mice. Importantly, AKO mice and floxed control littermate mice have similar body mass and adipose mass (Fig. 3G). AKO mice and floxed control littermate had similar basal serum triglycerides and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) before LPS injection (Fig. 3H). We found that LPS injection increased the level of triglycerides in the blood in floxed control littermate mice (Fig. 3H). However, the LPS-induced increase in triglycerides was ∼50% lower 6 h after LPS injection in AKO mice (Fig. 3H). LPS injection increased the level of serum NEFA to similar levels in both AKO and floxed control littermate mice (Fig. 3H). These data show that adipocyte-specific IRE1 deletion did not change fat mass or blood lipids in the absence of inflammation, but adipocyte-specific IRE1"
https://openalex.org/W3129850565,"O-GlcNAcylation is an essential post-translational modification that has been implicated in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. O-GlcNAcase (OGA), the sole enzyme catalyzing the removal of O-GlcNAc from proteins, has emerged as a potential drug target. OGA consists of an N-terminal OGA catalytic domain and a C-terminal pseudo histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain with unknown function. To investigate phenotypes specific to loss of OGA catalytic activity and dissect the role of the HAT domain, we generated a constitutive knock-in mouse line, carrying a mutation of a catalytic aspartic acid to alanine. These mice showed perinatal lethality and abnormal embryonic growth with skewed Mendelian ratios after day E18.5. We observed tissue-specific changes in O-GlcNAc homeostasis regulation to compensate for loss of OGA activity. Using X-ray microcomputed tomography on late gestation embryos, we identified defects in the kidney, brain, liver, and stomach. Taken together, our data suggest that developmental defects during gestation may arise upon prolonged OGA inhibition specifically because of loss of OGA catalytic activity and independent of the function of the HAT domain."

Patients and methods We recruited 23 malignant patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive COVID-19, also, 19 COVID-19 non-malignant patients, and 20 healthy volunteers were also enrolled for comparison. Blood samples were collected from patients and healthy donors into 5 mL vacutainer tube containing 3.5% buffered sodium citrate solution for measurement of total microparticles (TMPs), platelet microparticles (PMPs), endothelial microparticles (EMPs), CD62 activated platelets, and CD41 platelet marker. Results COVID-19 malignant patients had significantly lower hemoglobin and platelets compared to COVID non-malignant ones, while they had significantly higher C-reactive protein, LDH, AST, Albunim, creatinine, and prognostic index (PI) compared to COVID-19 non-malignant patients. significant accumulations of TMPs, PMPs, EMPs, and activated platelets in COVID-19 affected patients compared to healthy controls. TMPs, and EMPs were significantly accumulated in COVID-19 malignant compared to COVID-19 non-malignant patients with no significant difference in PMPs between both. Conclusion Circulating MPs and activated platelets may be promising novel prognostic biomarkers capable of identifying potentially severe COVID-19 patients who require immediate care especially in cancer patients."

However, the lack of YARS2 mutation animal model makes us difficult to elucidate the pathophysiology underlying YARS2 deficiency. To explore this system, we generated YARS2 knockout (KO) HeLa cells and zebrafish using CRISPR/Cas9 technology.

In particular, all 19 mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (mt-aaRSs) were synthesized in the cytosol and subsequently imported into mitochondria. These mt-aaRSs are a group of enzymes that catalyze a two-step reaction where they first activate the cognate amino acid with ATP to form an aminoacyl-adenylate, then subsequently transfer the aminoacyl group of the aminoacyl-adenylate to the bound tRNA for protein synthesis (8Sissler M.

Strikingly, cell lines carrying the YARS2 mutations exhibited marked reductions in the nucleus-encoding mitochondrial proteins: NDUFS3 and NDUFB8 [subunits of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I)] and COX10 [subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV)] (24Riley L.G.

These implied that YARS2 may play an important role in the biogenesis of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system (1Wallace D.C. Mitochondrial genetic medicine.Nat. Genet. 2018; 50: 1642-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing approach in HeLa cells to produce the targeted deletion in YARS2 gene. To further confirm the defects of YARS2 knockout (KO) (YARS2KO) in the HeLa cells, we transferred a plasmid carrying the full-length YARS2 cDNA into the YARS2KO HeLa cells. The YARS2KO cell lines were assessed for the effects of YARS2 mutations on the biogenesis of OXPHOS, by western blot analysis using the subunits of OXPHOS and activity of respiratory chain complexes. To examine whether YARS2 interacts with the OXPHOS, we performed the immunoprecipitation assay using FLAG and HA antibodies in mitochondria of HeLa cell lines. To investigate whether defects in yars2 caused the visual impairment in vivo, we investigated the yars2 knockout zebrafish produced by genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. To gain overall information on how the YARS2 deficiency affected the mitochondrial functions, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing approach to produce the targeted deletion in YARS2 gene in the HeLa cells. As a result, an allele, YARS2del14bp, was generated by introducing a 14 bp deletion in the exon 1 of YARS2 (homozygous cells were described as YARS2KO and wild type as WT). The 14 bp deletion resulted in a frameshift from codon 10, the introduction of a premature stop at codon 25 (p.Pro25∗), and truncated protein with 24 amino acids (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1). This allele was confirmed by Sanger sequencing, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) with digested with BstNI (Fig. S1) and western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). Defects in tRNA aminoacylation of tRNATyr were assessed by using electrophoresis in an acid polyacrylamide/urea gel system to separate uncharged tRNA species from the corresponding charged tRNA, electroblotting and hybridizing with DIG-labeled probes specific for tRNATyr, tRNALeu(UUR), and tRNAThr. As shown in Figure 1C, the slower migrating band (upper band) in WT cells represents the charged tRNA, and the faster migrating band (lower band) represents uncharged tRNA. However, only one lower band in the tRNATyrs but two bands of tRNALeu(UUR) and tRNAThr were detected in the YARS2KO cells, indicating that the ablation of YARS2 led to the complete loss of aminoacylation of tRNATyr but did not affect the aminoacylation of tRNALeu(UUR) and tRNAThr. To further distinguish nonaminoacylated tRNA from aminoacylated tRNA, samples of tRNAs were deacylated after heating for 10 min at 60 °C (pH 8.3) and then run in parallel. As shown in Figure 1C, the deacylated samples gave only one band (uncharged tRNA) in both mutant and control cell lines. To further confirm the ablation of YARS2 in HeLa cells, we transferred a plasmid carrying the full-length YARS2 cDNA into the YARS2KO cells. Indeed, the overexpression of YARS2 reversed the deficient aminoacylation of tRNATyr in the YARS2KO cells. To assess the effect of YARS2 mutation on the OXPHOS biogenesis, we carried out the western blotting analysis to examine the levels in 17 subunits of OXPHOS complexes in YARS2KO and WT cells using TOM20 as a loading control. These subunits included four mtDNA-encoding polypeptides (ND6, CYTB, CO2, and ATP8), 13 nucleus-encoding proteins: NDUFS1, NDUFS3, NDUFA9, and NDUFB8 (subunits of complex I), SDHA and SDHB [subunits of succinate dehydrogenase (complex II)], UQCRC1 and UQCRC2 [subunits of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (complex III)], COX5A, COX10, and COX16 (subunits of complex IV), and ATP5C and ATP5F1 [subunits of H+-ATPase (complex V)] (1Wallace D.C. Mitochondrial genetic medicine.Nat. Genet. 2018; 50: 1642-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2, A and C, the various decreases in the levels of 13 mitochondrial proteins (but not of SDHA, COX10, ATP5C, and ATP5F1) were observed in the YARS2KO cells, as compared with the WT cells. As shown in Figure 2B, the levels of ND6, CYTB, CO2, and ATP8 in the YARS2KO cells were 71%, 58%, 23%, and 59%, with an average of 53%, relative to the mean values measured in the WT cells. As shown in the Figure 2D, the levels of NDUFS1, NDUFS3, NDUFA9, NDUFB8, SDHA, SDHB, UQCRC1, UQCRC2, COX5A, COX10, COX16, ATP5C, and ATP5F1 in YARS2KO cells were 50%, 40%, 42%, 30%, 118%, 48%, 78%, 47%, 80%, 115%, 48%, 95%, and 103%, relative to the mean values measured in the WT cells, respectively. Notably, the average levels in the subunits of complexes I, II, III, IV, and V in the YARS2KO cells were 47%, 82%, 60%, 66%, and 85% of average values measured in the WT HeLa cells, respectively (Fig. 2E). However, the overexpression of YARS2 elevated the levels of these subunits.Figure 3Analysis of stability and activity of OXPHOS complexes. A, assembly and stability of OXPHOS complexes.

Participation in exercises during pregnancy in low-middle income countries is constrained. The objective of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice of antenatal exercises among Ethiopian women during pregnancy, and also to examine the barriers to prenatal physical activity. Methods A descriptive hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted and 349 pregnant women receiving prenatal care at the ante-natal care clinic, University of Gondar comprehensive specialized hospital were recruited. Data were obtained on maternal characteristics, knowledge, attitude, practice, and barriers towards antenatal exercise (ANEx) by interview method. Results Among 349 pregnant women, 138 (39.5%) and 193 (55.3%) had adequate knowledge, a positive attitude, and good practice respectively. Overall, 108 (30.9) of the respondents practiced antenatal exercise, while only 41 (37.9%) of those pregnant women had a good practice. Brisk walking (90.7%), relaxation (38.9%), and breathing exercise (36.1%) were most practice ANEx, while pelvic floor 6 (5.6%) and 3 (2.8%) yoga were the least practiced. Enhancing post-natal recovery (71%) and vaginal bleeding (64.5) were perceived as benefits and contraindication of ANEx. More than half of the pregnant women (53.6) reported that ANEx is not appropriate for Ethiopian culture. Knowledge, attitude, and practice of ANEx among pregnant women are significantly associated with higher education, government employees, pre-pregnancy exercise, and being advised on ANEx before. Women with adequate knowledge are more likely to have a good practice (AOR 4.53, 95%CI: 1.64, 15.3). Conclusion The findings of this study suggest that knowledge concerning antenatal exercise is low and their attitude is reasonably favorable. However, very few Ethiopian pregnant practices ANEx according to recommended guidelines during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3130930066,"Efficient enzymatic saccharification of cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars can enable production of bioproducts like ethanol. Native crystalline cellulose, or cellulose I, is inefficiently processed via enzymatic hydrolysis but can be converted into the structurally distinct cellulose III allomorph that is processed via cellulase cocktails derived from Trichoderma reesei up to 20-fold faster. However, characterization of individual cellulases from T. reesei, like the processive exocellulase Cel7A, shows reduced binding and activity at low enzyme loadings toward cellulose III. To clarify this discrepancy, we monitored the single-molecule initial binding commitment and subsequent processive motility of Cel7A enzymes and associated carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) on cellulose using optical tweezers force spectroscopy. We confirmed a 48% lower initial binding commitment and 32% slower processive motility of Cel7A on cellulose III, which we hypothesized derives from reduced binding affinity of the Cel7A binding domain CBM1. Classical CBM–cellulose pull-down assays, depending on the adsorption model fitted, predicted between 1.2- and 7-fold reduction in CBM1 binding affinity for cellulose III. Force spectroscopy measurements of CBM1–cellulose interactions, along with molecular dynamics simulations, indicated that previous interpretations of classical binding assay results using multisite adsorption models may have complicated analysis, and instead suggest simpler single-site models should be used. These findings were corroborated by binding analysis of other type-A CBMs (CBM2a, CBM3a, CBM5, CBM10, and CBM64) on both cellulose allomorphs. Finally, we discuss how complementary analytical tools are critical to gain insight into the complex mechanisms of insoluble polysaccharides hydrolysis by cellulolytic enzymes and associated carbohydrate-binding proteins."

The widely distributed 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferases (MSTs) are implicated in the generation of persulfidated molecules and H2S biogenesis through transfer of a sulfane sulfur atom from a suitable donor to an acceptor. Arabidopsis has two MSTs, named STR1 and STR2, but they are poorly characterized. To learn more about these enzymes, we conducted a series of biochemical experiments including a variety of possible reducing systems.

Using the redox-sensitive GFP (roGFP2) as a model acceptor protein, we showed that the persulfide-forming MSTs catalyze roGFP2 oxidation and more generally trans-persulfidation reactions. However, a preferential interaction with the thioredoxin system and glutathione was observed in case of competition between these sulfur acceptors. Moreover, we observed that MSTs are sensitive to overoxidation but are protected from an irreversible inactivation by their persulfide intermediate and subsequent reactivation by thioredoxins or glutathione.

An ever-growing body of evidence indicates that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays a role in cellular signaling as other gaseous molecules such as nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). Signaling by H2S is proposed to occur via the posttranslational modification (PTM) of critical cysteine residues (RSH) to persulfides (RSSH), called persulfidation, resulting in a cysteine whose thiol group is covalently bound to sulfur (sulfane sulfur) (1Hanaoka K.

Oxidized thiol species such as sulfenic acids (RSOH), but not reduced thiols, are the direct targets of H2S reactivity (2Francoleon N.E. Carrington S.J. Fukuto J.M.

Cysteine persulfides have been found in free cysteine, small molecule peptides, as well as in proteins (5Millikin R. Bianco C.L. White C. Saund S.S. Henriquez S. Sosa V. Akaike T. Kumagai Y. Soeda S.

Med. 2016; 97: 136-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that prokaryotic and mammalian cysteinyl-tRNA synthetases (CARSs) have a crucial role in the synthesis of cysteine persulfides (Cys-SSH) (6Akaike T. Ida T. Wei F.-Y.

Pharmacol. 2019; 176: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) thus representing one of the numerous pathways contributing to the formation of persulfides. In plants, H2S is associated with various physiological functions ranging from responses to abiotic and biotic stresses, plant development (seed germination, root development, leaf senescence), photosynthesis, and autophagy to stomatal movement (8Gotor C. García I. Aroca Á. Laureano-Marín A.M. Arenas-Alfonseca L. Jurado-Flores A. Moreno I. Romero L.C. Signaling by hydrogen sulfide and cyanide through post-translational modification.J. Exp. Bot. 2019; 70: 4251-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Three distinct enzymatic pathways producing H2S have been identified. Sulfide is primarily produced in chloroplasts through the action of sulfite reductase during the reductive assimilation of sulfate. It is then incorporated into the amino acid skeleton of O-acetylserine to form cysteine, the biosynthesis of which can occur in the cytosol, plastids, and mitochondria (9Takahashi H. Kopriva S.

Plant Biol. 2011; 62: 157-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Another pathway of H2S biogenesis is the conversion of cyanide and cysteine into β-cyanoalanine and H2S, which is catalyzed by the β-cyanoalanine synthase CAS-C1 in mitochondria (8Gotor C. García I. Aroca Á. Laureano-Marín A.M. Arenas-Alfonseca L. Jurado-Flores A. Moreno I. Romero L.C. Signaling by hydrogen sulfide and cyanide through post-translational modification.J. Exp.

Three Arabidopsis genes encoding proteins with differential activities for cysteine synthase and β-cyanoalanine synthase.Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, the L-cysteine desulfhydrase 1 (DES1) degrades cysteine into H2S, ammonia, and pyruvate (11Álvarez C. Calo L. Romero L.C. García I. Gotor C. An acetylserine(thiol)lyase homolog with cysteine desulfhydrase activity regulates cysteine homeostasis in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2010; 152: 656-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 12Álvarez C.

Cysteine-generated sulfide in the cytosol negatively regulates autophagy and modulates the transcriptional profile in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2012; 24: 4621-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Up to now, the links between the H2S-producing enzymes and the cellular persulfidation state have not been clearly identified in plants. Although des1 mutant plants display a reduced sulfide production (30% decrease under steady-state growth conditions) (11Álvarez C. Calo L. Romero L.C. García I. Gotor C. An acetylserine(thiol)lyase homolog with cysteine desulfhydrase activity regulates cysteine homeostasis in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2010; 152: 656-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and are affected in several physiological pathways (senescence, autophagy, stomatal closure, and immunity), the number of persulfidated proteins in wildtype (WT) and des1 plants (2015 and 2130, respectively) is similar and with a high overlap of 85% (13Aroca A. Benito J.M. Gotor C. Romero L.C. Persulfidation proteome reveals the regulation of protein function by hydrogen sulfide in diverse biological processes in Arabidopsis.J. Exp. Bot. 2017; 68: 4915-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In des1 mutants, the persulfidation level of only 47 proteins, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and abscisic acid receptors, was decreased underlying a limited role of DES1 in protein persulfidation. Hence, other factors/pathways promoting protein persulfidation in plants remain to be identified. In mammals, H2S is generated primarily by three different enzymes: cystathionine beta-synthase, cystathionine gamma-lyase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST) (14Rose P. Moore P.K.

Alvarez B. Banerjee R. Chemical biology of H2S signaling through persulfidation.Chem. Rev. 2018; 118: 1253-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). MSTs belong to the sulfurtransferase (STR) family, which are characterized by the presence of a rhodanese (Rhd) domain (16Bordo D. Bork P. The rhodanese/Cdc25 phosphatase superfamily.EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 17Moseler A. Selles B. Rouhier N. Couturier J. Novel insights into the diversity of the sulfurtransferase family in photosynthetic organisms with emphasis on oak.New Phytol. 2020; 226: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Owing to the conserved catalytic cysteine present in the rhodanese domain, STRs are implicated in sulfur/persulfide trafficking through their ability to catalyze the transfer of a sulfur atom to nucleophilic acceptors. The MST isoforms are characterized by the presence of two Rhd domains with only the C-terminal one possessing the catalytic cysteine in a characteristic CG[S/T]GVT signature (17Moseler A. Selles B. Rouhier N. Couturier J. Novel insights into the diversity of the sulfurtransferase family in photosynthetic organisms with emphasis on oak.New Phytol. 2020; 226: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In mammals, MSTs are found in both the cytosol and mitochondria. In rat liver, the specific MST activity is 3-fold higher in mitochondria than in the cytosol (18Nagahara N. Ito T. Kitamura H. Nishino T.

Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In mice, the mitochondrial MST contributes to H2S metabolism and sulfide signaling by releasing H2S in the presence of a reductant such as a thioredoxin (TRX) (19Shibuya N. Tanaka M. Yoshida M. Ogasawara Y. Togawa T. Ishii K. Kimura H. 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase produces hydrogen sulfide and bound sulfane sulfur in the brain.Antioxid.

Thioredoxin and dihydrolipoic acid are required for 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase to produce hydrogen sulfide.Biochem. J. 2011; 439: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the production of polysulfides H2S2 and H2S3 by MST has been reported in the absence of reductant (21Kimura Y. Toyofuku Y. Koike S. Shibuya N. Nagahara N. Lefer D. Ogasawara Y. Kimura H. Identification of H2S3 and H2S produced by 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase in the brain.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 14774Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), whereas Cys-SSH and glutathione persulfide (GSSH) were observed in the presence of physiological concentrations of cysteine and GSH (22Kimura Y. Koike S. Shibuya N. Lefer D. Ogasawara Y. Kimura H. 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase produces potential redox regulators cysteine- and glutathione-persulfide (Cys-SSH and GSSH) together with signaling molecules H2S2, H2S3 and H2S.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 10459Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed in Escherichia coli with the involvement of the MST ortholog, SseA, in the production of reactive sulfane sulfur and notably GSSH and GSSSH (23Li K. Xin Y. Xuan G. Zhao R. Liu H. Xia Y. Xun L. Escherichia coli uses separate enzymes to produce H2S and reactive sulfane sulfur from L-cysteine.Front. Microbiol. 2019; 10: 298Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). From a physiological point of view, the levels of total persulfidated species in the brain of MST-KO mice are less than 50% of those in the brain of WT mice indicating that mitochondrial MST is indeed an important factor in promoting protein persulfidation (21Kimura Y. Toyofuku Y. Koike S. Shibuya N. Nagahara N. Lefer D. Ogasawara Y. Kimura H. Identification of H2S3 and H2S produced by 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase in the brain.Sci.

Rep. 2017; 7: 10459Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The biochemical characterization of human MSTs has confirmed that TRXs are physiological persulfide acceptors contributing to the generation of H2S and thus TRXs can be considered as regulators of protein persulfide levels in the cells (24Yadav P.K. Vitvitsky V. Carballal S. Seravalli J. Banerjee R. Thioredoxin regulates human mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase at physiologically relevant concentrations.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 6299-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although good evidence for the function of MSTs in sulfur transfer or H2S synthesis has been gained in bacteria and vertebrates over the last decade, their function in plants is just being elucidated. Plants possess at least one MST isoform, but Arabidopsis thaliana has two MSTs, named STR1 and STR2, which are located in mitochondria and cytosol, respectively (25Bauer M. Dietrich C. Nowak K. Sierralta W.D. Papenbrock J. Intracellular localization of Arabidopsis sulfurtransferases.Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 916-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Nakamura T. Yamaguchi Y. Sano H. Plant mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferases.Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5621-5630Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, the MSTs are suggested to be multifunctional enzymes involved in cysteine catabolism and sulfide production and possibly in cyanide detoxification as shown in vitro (27Krüßel L. Junemann J. Wirtz M. Birke H. Thornton J.D. Browning L.W. Poschet G. Hell R. Balk J. Braun H.-P. Hildebrandt T.M.

Characterization of two sulfurtransferase isozymes from Arabidopsis thaliana.Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5571-5579Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Regarding the MST role in cysteine degradation in mitochondria, STR1 converts 3-MP, formed by the action of a yet unknown cysteine aminotransferase on cysteine, to pyruvate resulting in the formation of an enzyme-bound persulfide (Fig. S1). It is suggested that STR1 persulfide is then transferred to GSH (28Höfler S. Lorenz C. Busch T. Brinkkötter M. Tohge T. Fernie A.R. Braun H.-P. Hildebrandt T.M. Dealing with the sulfur part of cysteine: Four enzymatic steps degrade L-cysteine to pyruvate and thiosulfate in Arabidopsis mitochondria.Physiol. Plant. 2016; 157: 352-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In accordance with their catalytic mechanism, both Arabidopsis MSTs were isolated as persulfidated proteins from leaf extracts (13Aroca A. Benito J.M. Gotor C. Romero L.C. Persulfidation proteome reveals the regulation of protein function by hydrogen sulfide in diverse biological processes in Arabidopsis.J. Exp. Bot. 2017; 68: 4915-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition to these functions, an interaction of both MSTs was observed with TRXs through bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), but no further investigation of the implication of these two systems in H2S biosynthesis and protein persulfidation has been performed (31Henne M. König N. Triulzi T. Baroni S. Forlani F. Scheibe R. Papenbrock J. Sulfurtransferase and thioredoxin specifically interact as demonstrated by bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis and biochemical tests.FEBS Open Bio. 2015; 5: 832-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the kinetics of H2S biosynthesis and of low-molecular-weight persulfide production from 3-MP catalyzed by recombinant Arabidopsis STR1 and STR2 since a fine characterization of their enzymatic properties was not achieved so far. This 3-MP conversion constitutes an efficient H2S biogenesis system in the presence of the major cellular reductants (TRX, GRX). Other trans-persulfidation reactions, not necessarily releasing H2S, have been observed with GSH, Cys, or the model acceptor protein roGFP2, suggesting that MSTs could participate in the trafficking of sulfane sulfur and/or in protein oxidation. These results advance our understanding of the roles of these two MSTs. The observed partnership with physiological sulfur acceptors such as TRXs, GRXs, and GSH will help mapping sulfur transfer events across interconnected pathways and designing adequate strategies for studying H2S biogenesis in planta. To analyze the functional facets of Arabidopsis MSTs, the corresponding recombinant proteins were purified after heterologous expression in E. coli with a production yield for STR1 of 20 mg and for STR2 of 4 mg of protein from 1 l bacterial culture. Different sulfur-containing compounds were tested as substrates to examine which sulfur donor is preferentially used by STR1 and STR2 in vitro. The protein activity was quantified by measuring the DTT-released H2S through the formation of methylene blue (Fig. S2) (32Hartle M.D. Pluth M.D. A practical guide to working with H2S at the interface of chemistry and biology.Chem. Soc. Rev. 2016; 45: 6108-6117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data obtained clearly indicated that 3-MP was the preferred sulfur donor that leads to H2S production (Fig. 1A). Only a very low activity was observed with thiosulfate as sulfur donor (Fig. 1A), although it was shown previously that STR1 possessed a thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase activity (33Burow M. Kessler D. Papenbrock J. Enzymatic activity of the Arabidopsis sulfurtransferase resides in the C-terminal domain but is boosted by the N-terminal domain and the linker peptide in the full- length enzyme.Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). No activity was measured in the presence of cysteine. The interaction of 3-MP with both STR1 and STR2 was then evaluated using fluorescence measurements. Indeed, some non-plant MSTs exhibit quenched intrinsic fluorescence after forming the intermediate persulfide, owing to the location of a tryptophan residue close to the active site (34Colnaghi R. Cassinelli G. Drummond M. Forlani F. Pagani S.

Radon C. Leimkühler S. Characterization and interaction studies of two isoforms of the dual localized 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase TUM1 from humans.J. Biol.

Unraveling the mechanism of cysteine persulfide formation catalyzed by 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferases.ACS Catal. 2018; 8: 2049-2059Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Similar to E. coli SseA or human TUM1, STR1 and STR2 display intrinsic fluorescence with a maximum at 336 nm when excited at 270 nm (Fig. S3A). The fluorescence emission spectra of either Arabidopsis MSTs did not change following the addition of pyruvate but showed a strong decrease after addition of 3-MP (Fig. S3, B–D). Thus, we analyzed the fluorescence changes as a function of 3-MP concentration to determine the STR dissociation constant for 3-MP. Kd values of 1.3 ± 0.9 and 0.7 ± 0.3 μM were obtained for STR1 and STR2, respectively (Fig. 1B). In addition, STR1 C333S and STR2 C298S variants, in which the catalytically important cysteine residue present in the 6-amino acid CGTGVT signature was substituted for a serine, were generated. The intrinsic fluorescence of both variants also decreased after addition of 3-MP but not as strongly as in STR1 and STR2 indicating that the binding of 3-MP already led to fluorescence quenching, not only persulfide formation (Fig. S3, B–D). Then we examined whether MSTs are able to transfer a persulfide from 3-MP to an acceptor protein. Therefore, we used the redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein (roGFP2) as a model acceptor protein to analyze protein trans-persulfidation in vitro based on a previous work in which it was observed that roGFP2 can be oxidized through the activity of MSTs using 3-MP as sulfur donor in living cells (37Ezeriņa D. Takano Y. Hanaoka K. Urano Y. Dick T.P. N-acetyl cysteine functions as a fast-acting antioxidant by triggering intracellular H2S and sulfane sulfur production.Cell Chem. Biol. 2018; 25: 447-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Considering that 3-MP alone does not trigger roGFP2 oxidation and that the reaction between 3-MP and MSTs leads to the persulfidation of the MST catalytic cysteine, it is likely that this persulfide group is then transferred to one of the Cys of the reduced roGFP2 and that the second Cys of roGFP2 reduces the persulfide, yielding H2S and an oxidized roGFP2 (Fig. 2A). The resulting intramolecular disulfide bridge of roGFP2 changes the steric arrangement of the beta barrel surface and in turn the optical characteristics of the chromophore enabling a direct readout of roGFP2 oxidation. Addition of 3-MP to the MST and roGFP2 mix led indeed to an efficient oxidation of roGFP2, whereas no oxidation was observed in the absence of MST or using variants mutated for the conserved active site Cys of the MST (STR1 C333S and STR2 C298S) (Fig. 2, B and C). Altogether, these findings indicate that STR1 and STR2 form persulfides on the catalytic cysteine after treatment with 3-MP, which is the canonical substrate in vitro and is able to transfer the persulfide to an acceptor. Earlier it was suggested that STR1 plays a role in cysteine degradation by transferring a persulfide from 3-MP to GSH (28Höfler S. Lorenz C. Busch T. Brinkkötter M. Tohge T. Fernie A.R. Braun H.-P. Hildebrandt T.M. Dealing with the sulfur part of cysteine: Four enzymatic steps degrade L-cysteine to pyruvate and thiosulfate in Arabidopsis mitochondria.Physiol. Plant. 2016; 157: 352-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and in addition, it was reported through BiFC that STR1 and STR2 interact with the mitochondrial TRXo1 or cytosolic TRXh1, respectively (31Henne M. König N. Triulzi T. Baroni S. Forlani F. Scheibe R. Papenbrock J. Sulfurtransferase and thioredoxin specifically interact as demonstrated by bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis and biochemical tests.FEBS Open Bio. 2015; 5: 832-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These results prompted us to investigate the interaction of the MSTs with a larger panel of physiologically relevant sulfane sulfur acceptors, GSH and cysteine, and also TRX or GRX reducing systems and to determine the steady-state kinetic parameters associated with H2S generation (Table 1). In all cases, a hyperbolic relationship between the rate of reaction and the concentration of acceptor was obtained (Fig. S4, A–E). Catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) ranging from 5.2 × 105 to 8.7 × 106 M−1 s−1 have been measured in the presence of the TRX or GRX reducing systems for both STR1 and STR2, which are 10- to 100-fold higher than the values obtained with GSH or cysteine (Table 1). The apparent Km values for the two mitochondrial TRXo1 and TRXo2 as well as the cytosolic TRXh1 were in the low micromolar range ranging from 1.3 to 5.3 μM. Similar apparent Km values around 3 μM were recently estimated for the human MPST1 and MPST2 with the cytosolic thioredoxin TXN (24Yadav P.K. Vitvitsky V. Carballal S. Seravalli J. Banerjee R. Thioredoxin regulates human mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase at physiologically relevant concentrations.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 6299-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, the apparent Km values of STR1 or STR2 for GSH, 200 or 350 μM respectively, differ considerably from the value of 28 mM obtained for human MPST2 (38Yadav P.K. Yamada K. Chiku T. Koutmos M. Banerjee R. Structure and kinetic analysis of H2S production by human mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 20002-20013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Of interest, apparent Km values of 0.7 to 4.6 μM were measured for GRXs (GRXC1 and C4) using both STRs indicating that MST activity can be also coupled to these reductases. Similar steady-state kinetic parameters were determined for STR1 using TRXo1, GRXC1, or GSH by following the NADPH consumption instead of measuring the methylene blue formation (Fig. S5). Finally, the apparent Km values for 3-MP were estimated at saturating concentrations of each acceptor using mitochondrial TRXo1 and TRXo2 for STR1 and the cytosolic TRXh1 for STR2 and ranged from ∼290 to ∼460 μM (Table 2, Fig. S4F). Altogether, these results show that both Arabidopsis MST isoforms have globally similar kinetic constants for each substrate or reducing system tested. The apparent affinities indicate that all these interactions may be physiologically relevant and point for the first time to a possible role of GRXs. Moreover, GSH may have an important role as an acceptor of persulfides from plant MSTs, unlike human MPST.Table 1Kinetic parameters of 3-MP sulfurtransferase activity of Arabidopsis STR1 and STR2 using distinct sulfur acceptorsAcceptorSTR1STR2Km (μM)kcat (s−1)kcat/Km (M−1 s−1)Km (μM)kcat (s−1)kcat/Km (M−1 s−1)TRXo15.3 ± 1.06.81.3 × 106nananaTRXo21.3 ± 0.23.62.8 × 106nananaTRXh1nanana1.4 ± 0.21.41.0 × 106GRXC41.1 ± 0.14.64.2 × 1064.6 ± 0.62.45.2 × 105GRXC10.7 ± 0.16.18.7 × 1061.43 ± 0.33.12.2 × 106GSH200 ± 205.32.7 × 104350 ± 102.36.6 × 103Cysteine2200 ± 4003.91.7 × 1031300 ± 701.51.2 × 103na, not analyzed.Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by varying the acceptor concentration at a saturating concentration of 3-MP (n = 3; means ± SD).

The fungal protein Sgt2, and its human homolog SGTA, is the entry point for clients to the guided entry of tail-anchored protein (GET) pathway, which targets endoplasmic reticulum-bound TA IMPs. Consisting of three structurally independent domains, the C terminus of Sgt2 binds to the hydrophobic transmembrane domain (TMD) of clients. However, the exact binding interface within Sgt2 and molecular details that underlie its binding mechanism and client preference are not known. Here, we reveal the mechanism of Sgt2 binding to hydrophobic clients, including TA IMPs. Through sequence analysis, biophysical characterization, and a series of capture assays, we establish that the Sgt2 C-terminal domain is flexible but conserved and sufficient for client binding. A molecular model for this domain reveals a helical hand forming a hydrophobic groove approximately 15 Å long that is consistent with our observed higher affinity for client TMDs with a hydrophobic face and a minimal length of 11 residues. This work places Sgt2 into a broader family of TPR-containing cochaperone proteins, demonstrating structural and sequence-based similarities to the DP domains in the yeast Hsp90 and Hsp70 coordinating protein, Sti1."
https://openalex.org/W3131078169,"Introduction Despite the increasingly wider availability of contraceptives and the high levels of unmet need for family planning in rural Ethiopia, contraceptive utilization among young married women is low. Studies on associated factors in Ethiopia so far have been focused on individual factors with little emphasis on socio-cultural factors. This study aimed to assess the association between contraceptive utilization and socio-cultural factors among young married women in Eastern Ethiopia. Methods A community-based survey was conducted among young married women aged 14–24 years. A total of 3039 women were interviewed by trained data collectors using a structured questionnaire. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) was used to identify factors associated with contraceptive utilization using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results The current contraceptive prevalence rate was 14.1% (95% CI: 12.8–15.5). Perceived social approval (AOR = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.60–2.30) and perception of friends’ contraceptive practice (AOR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.20–1.54) were significantly and positively associated with contraceptive utilization. On the contrary, increased score of belief in contraceptive myths was significantly and negatively associated with contraceptive use ( AOR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.49–0.73). Moreover, recent exposure to family planning information (AOR = 1.67; 95% CI: 1.22–2.28), ever-mother (AOR = 9.68; 95% CI: 4.47–20.90), and secondary and above education level (AOR = 1.90; 95% CI: 1.38–2.70) were significantly associated with higher odds of contraceptive utilization. Conclusion Only about one-in-seven young married women were using contraceptive methods. Socio-cultural factors significantly influence young married women’s contraceptive utilization. Interventions to address social norms and pervasive myths and misconceptions could increase the use of contraceptive methods in young married women."
https://openalex.org/W3132499039,"The pathological characteristics of osteoarthritis are cartilage matrix degradation, chondrocytes apoptosis, and low-grade inflammation of the joint. Recent studies have shown that blood vessels grow from the subchondral bone to the articular cartilage. However, the relationship among inflammation, angiogenesis, and chondrocyte apoptosis is still unclear. We found that chondrocytes could secrete chemokines and VEGF to promote the migration of vascular endothelial cells in response to TNF-α stimulation. The invasion of blood vessels leads to increased oxygen tension in the local environment, which increased the expression of SETD7 in chondrocytes by activating the JAK-STAT5 pathway. The bond of phosphorylated STAT5 and the specific locus in the promoter of SETD7 directly increased the transcription of SETD7. On the one hand, SETD7-regulated chemokine expression by forming a positive loop; on the other hand, SETD7-mediated chondrocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the nuclear localization of HIF-1α. In this study, we discovered a novel function of chondrocytes as mediators of inflammation and angiogenesis. Our study demonstrates that SETD7 is a potential molecular target to prevent OA development and progression."

In this study, PBMCs were collected from 17 human participants vaccinated with the split-inactivated influenza virus vaccine during the 2016–2017 influenza season. A combination of Immune Repertoire Capture (IRC TM ) technology and IgG sequencing was performed on ~7,800 plasmablast (PB) cells and preferential IgG heavy-light chain pairings were investigated. In some participants, a single expanded clonotype accounted for ~22% of their PB BCR repertoire. Approximately 60% (10/17) of participants experienced convergent evolution, possessing public PBs that were elicited independently in multiple participants. Binding profiles of one private and three public PBs confirmed they were all subtype-specific, cross-reactive hemagglutinin (HA) head-directed antibodies. Collectively, this high-resolution antibody repertoire analysis demonstrated the impact evolution can have on BCRs in response to influenza virus vaccination, which can guide future universal influenza prophylactic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3131153493,"Mental fatigue is a common problem associated with neurological disorders. Until now, there has not been a method to assess mental fatigue on a continuous scale. Camera-based eye-typing is commonly used for communication by people with severe neurological disorders. We designed a working memory-based eye-typing experiment with 18 healthy participants, and obtained eye-tracking and typing performance data in addition to their subjective scores on perceived effort for every sentence typed and mental fatigue, to create a model of mental fatigue for eye-typing. The features of the model were the eye-based blink frequency, eye height and baseline-related pupil diameter. We predicted subjective ratings of mental fatigue on a six-point Likert scale, using random forest regression, with 22% lower mean absolute error than using simulations. When additionally including task difficulty (i.e. the difficulty of the sentences typed) as a feature, the variance explained by the model increased by 9%. This indicates that task difficulty plays an important role in modelling mental fatigue. The results demonstrate the feasibility of objective and non-intrusive measurement of fatigue on a continuous scale."
https://openalex.org/W3132527932,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine implicated in proinflammatory as well as regenerative processes and acts via receptor complexes consisting of the ubiquitously expressed, signal-transducing receptor gp130 and the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). The IL-6R is expressed only on hepatocytes and subsets of leukocytes, where it mediates specificity of the receptor complex to IL-6 as the subunit gp130 is shared with all other members of the IL-6 cytokine family such as IL-11 or IL-27. The amount of IL-6R at the cell surface thus determines the responsiveness of the cell to the cytokine and might therefore be decisive in the development of inflammatory disorders. However, how the expression levels of IL-6R and gp130 at the cell surface are controlled is largely unknown. Here, we show that IL-6R and gp130 are constitutively internalized independent of IL-6. This process depends on dynamin and clathrin and is temporally controlled by motifs within the intracellular region of gp130 and IL-6R. IL-6 binding and internalization of the receptors is a prerequisite for activation of the Jak/STAT signaling cascade. Targeting of gp130, but not of the IL-6R, to the lysosome for degradation depends on stimulation with IL-6. Furthermore, we show that after internalization and activation of signaling, both the IL-6R and gp130 are recycled back to the cell surface, a process that is enhanced by IL-6.

The cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is implicated in mucosal immunity and the hepatic acute-phase response (1Hunter C.A. Jones S.A. IL-6 as a keystone cytokine in health and disease.Nat. Immunol. 2015; 16: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is involved in the development of sepsis, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, making IL-6 an attractive therapeutic target (2Jones S.A. Scheller J. Rose-John S.

The monoclonal antibody tocilizumab, which prevents binding of IL-6 to its IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in more than 160 countries (3Garbers C.

Binding of IL-6 to the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) and the subsequent recruitment of a gp130 homodimer lead to activation of intracellular signaling cascades, most importantly the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak/STAT) pathway (5Lütticken C.

Besides negative feedback inhibitors, e.g., SOCS3, internalization of transmembrane receptors is an important regulatory cellular process, which not only regulates the amount of protein on the cell surface, but can also be critical for signal termination. This has been described e.g., for receptor tyrosine kinases such as the endothelial growth factor receptor (7Thiel S. Sommer U. Kortylewski M. Haan C. Behrmann I. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. Termination of IL-6-induced STAT activation is independent of receptor internalization but requires de novo protein synthesis.FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but is not the case for the IL-6 signaling complex. Internalization routes can be divided into clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent pathways (8Le Roy C. Wrana J.L. Clathrin- and non-clathrin-mediated endocytic regulation of cell signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Internalized receptors are either degraded intracellularly or recycled back to the cell surface. At present, there are only few data available on the internalization of gp130 and the IL-6R and the intracellular fate of the two receptors (reviewed in (9Cendrowski J. Maminska A. Miaczynska M. Endocytic regulation of cytokine receptor signaling.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2016; 32: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10Hermanns H.M. Wohlfahrt J. Mais C. Hergovits S. Jahn D. Geier A. Endocytosis of pro-inflammatory cytokine receptors and its relevance for signal transduction.Biol. Chem. 2016; 397: 695-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar)). An early study showed rapid clearance of IL-6 and a reduction of binding sites on the cell surface, suggesting ligand-induced internalization that was independent of the intracellular domain (ICD) of the IL-6R, as an ICD-deficient mutant of the IL-6R showed no internalization defect (11Dittrich E. Rose-John S. Gerhartz C. Mullberg J. Stoyan T. Yasukawa K. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. Identification of a region within the cytoplasmic domain of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) signal transducer gp130 important for ligand-induced endocytosis of the IL-6 receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19014-19020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the ICD of the IL-6R contains sorting signals that are responsible for transport of the receptor to the basolateral membrane of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Mutation of the membrane-proximal tyrosine-based motif (Y408SLG) or the di-leucine-like motif (L427I) disrupts this differential sorting and leads to a localization of the IL-6R mainly at the apical membrane (12Martens A.S. Bode J.G. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. The cytoplasmic domain of the interleukin-6 receptor gp80 mediates its basolateral sorting in polarized madin-darby canine kidney cells.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3593-3602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor subunit gp130 has also been shown to be sorted to the basolateral membrane in polarized cells because of a di-leucine motif in its ICD (13Doumanov J.A. Daubrawa M. Unden H. Graeve L. Identification of a basolateral sorting signal within the cytoplasmic domain of the interleukin-6 signal transducer gp130.Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 1140-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the view that IL-6 binding is a prerequisite for endocytosis of its receptors. However, Thiel et al. showed constitutive and ligand-independent internalization of gp130 (14Thiel S. Dahmen H. Martens A. Müller-Newen G. Constitutive internalization and association with adaptor protein-2 of the interleukin-6 signal transducer gp130.FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Whether the IL-6R is also constitutively endocytosed and whether its endocytosis occurs in complex with gp130 are questions that have not been addressed so far. Furthermore, several findings suggest that internalization is not only a mechanism that terminates IL-6 signaling, but is rather required for gp130 signaling. A mutant variant of this receptor found in inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas is constitutively active and activates STAT3 in the absence of the ligand (15Rebouissou S. Amessou M. Couchy G. Poussin K. Imbeaud S. Pilati C. Izard T. Balabaud C. Bioulac-Sage P. Zucman-Rossi J.

Chem. 2012; 287: 13743-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). When HepG2 cells were transfected with this variant and treated with dynasore, an inhibitor of dynamin, phosphorylation of STAT3 was reduced, indicating that the constitutive signal transduction was localized to endosomes (17Schmidt-Arras D. Müller M. Stevanovic M. Horn S. Schütt A. Bergmann J. Wilkens R. Lickert A. Rose-John S. Oncogenic deletion mutants of gp130 signal from intracellular compartments.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 127: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, coexpression of this gp130 variant and dominant-negative dynamin in HEK293 cells did not reduce STAT3 phosphorylation although cell surface levels of gp130 were increased due to impaired clathrin-mediated endocytosis (18Rinis N. Kuster A. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Mohr A. Muller-Newen G. Intracellular signaling prevents effective blockade of oncogenic gp130 mutants by neutralizing antibodies.Cell Commun. Signal. 2014; 12: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the IL-6R and gp130 are internalized constitutively and independently of IL-6. Both receptors are internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is a prerequisite for IL-6-mediated signal transduction. We further show that the internalized receptors are either degraded within the lysosome or recycled back to the cell surface, the latter of which is enhanced in the presence of IL-6. IL-6 is a potent proinflammatory cytokine that exerts its actions through a receptor complex containing the α-receptor IL-6R and the signal-transducing receptor gp130. While gp130 is ubiquitously expressed and is also a receptor for all other cytokines of the IL-6 family, the surface expression of the α-receptor renders cells specifically responsive to IL-6. Thus, IL-6R expression has to be tightly regulated to control excessive inflammatory responses that might be harmful to the tissue (19Wolf J. Rose-John S. Garbers C. Interleukin-6 and its receptors: A highly regulated and dynamic system.Cytokine. 2014; 70: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We and others have previously shown that the amount of IL-6R on the cell surface is controlled by limited proteolysis by different proteases, among them the metalloprotease ADAM17 (20Riethmueller S. Somasundaram P. Ehlers J.C. Hung C.-W.W. Flynn C.M. Lokau J. Agthe M. Düsterhöft S. Zhu Y. Grötzinger J. Lorenzen I. Koudelka T. Yamamoto K. Pickhinke U.

Immunol. 1993; 23: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Accordingly, activation of ADAM17 by the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) reduced IL-6R cell-surface levels on the monocytic cell line THP-1 as judged by flow cytometry (Fig. 1A and (22Schumacher N. Meyer D. Mauermann A. von der Heyde J. Wolf J. Schwarz J. Knittler K. Murphy G. Michalek M. Garbers C. Bartsch J.W.W. Guo S. Schacher B. Eickholz P. Chalaris A. et al.Shedding of endogenous interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) is Governed by A Disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) proteases while a Full-length IL-6R Isoform Localizes to Circulating Microvesicles.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 26059-26071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)). Besides proteolysis, cytokine receptors are often also regulated by internalization. In order to determine a contribution of internalization to the cell-surface amounts of the IL-6R, we stained THP-1 cells with a specific antibody for the IL-6R and incubated the cells for different time periods at 37 °C. The used antibody recognizes an epitope located within the D1 domain of the IL-6R and does not interfere with IL-6 signaling or proteolytic cleavage of the IL-6R. We then visualized the IL-6R at the cell surface with a secondary antibody coupled to a fluorescent dye. As shown in Figure 1B (left panel), IL-6R levels were reduced over time, indicating a constitutive process. Inhibition of proteolysis with the broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor marimastat (Fig. 1B, right panel) did not significantly prevent IL-6R reduction on the cell surface (Fig. 1C), although sIL-6R in the cell culture supernatant was reduced after 90 min and 120 min of treatment with marimastat (Fig. 1D). We concluded from these experiments that constitutive internalization and proteolysis act simultaneously in THP-1 cells to regulate the amount of IL-6R at the cell surface, but that proteolysis is not the dominant mechanism. To further analyze the role of internalization and characterize the involved pathways, we incubated THP-1 cells with the inhibitors Dyngo-4a and Pit-Stop2, thereby specifically blocking dynamin and clathrin, respectively, or treated cells with the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as control. All experiments were done in the presence of marimastat to avoid simultaneous proteolytic cleavage. As before, we observed a constitutive decline of the IL-6R over time, and the cell surface amount was halved after 60 min (Fig. 2A). Blockade of dynamin by Dyngo-4a significantly prevented a decrease of IL-6R on the cell surface (Fig. 2A), and the same was true for the clathrin inhibitor Pit-Stop2 (Fig. 2A). Importantly, the internalization process appeared to be completely independent of the presence or absence of the ligand IL-6 (Fig. 2B and S1, A–C). In addition, we furthermore analyzed the internalization of the β-receptor gp130 in the same experimental setup. Like the IL-6R, gp130 was constitutively internalized (Fig. 2C). In agreement with the data obtained for the IL-6R, the addition of both Dyngo-4a and PitStop2 significantly prevented gp130 internalization (Fig. 2C), and no influence of IL-6 on this process was observable (Fig. 2D and S1, D–F). These data show that both the IL-6R and gp130 are constitutively internalized from the plasma membrane in a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent manner, which is in agreement with a recent report (23Monhasery N. Moll J. Cuman C. Franke M. Lamertz L. Nitz R. Gorg B. Häussinger D. Lokau J. Floss D.M. Piekorz R. Dimitriadis E. Garbers C. Scheller J. Transcytosis of IL-11 and apical redirection of gp130 is mediated by IL-11alpha receptor.Cell Rep. 2016; 16: 1067-1081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Having shown that the internalization of the IL-6R requires clathrin and dynamin, we sought to determine whether IL-6R proteolysis by ADAM17 is also dependent on these proteins. Activation of ADAM17-mediated proteolysis by the phorbol ester PMA resulted in significantly increased sIL-6R levels compared with the DMSO control (Fig. 3A). Indeed, preincubation of the cells with Pit-Stop2 was able to abolish PMA-induced sIL-6R generation (Fig. 3A). A similar experiment using the dynamin inhibitor Dyngo-4a showed strong and significant reduction of sIL-6R generation compared with PMA treatment alone and no PMA-induced induction when Dyngo-4a is used (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, treatment with Dyngo-4a either alone or in combination with PMA reduced sIL-6R below the unstimulated control. Because this constitutive cleavage of the IL-6R is mediated by ADAM10 (24Garbers C. Jänner N. Chalaris A. Moss M.L. Floss D.M. Meyer D. Koch-Nolte F. Rose-John S. Scheller J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38829-38839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), these results suggest that inhibition of dynamin also interferes with IL-6R cleavage by ADAM10. In conclusion, our results show that clathrin and dynamin are not only crucial for endocytosis of the IL-6R, but also required for IL-6R proteolysis by ADAM17. The IL-6R itself contains internalization motifs in its intracellular domain that have been shown to be crucial for correct sorting of the receptor (12Martens A.S. Bode J.G. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3593-3602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, internalization from the plasma membrane of an IL-6R that lacks its ICD occurs in the presence of gp130 (11Dittrich E. Rose-John S. Gerhartz C. Mullberg J. Stoyan T. Yasukawa K. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. Identification of a region within the cytoplasmic domain of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) signal transducer gp130 important for ligand-induced endocytosis of the IL-6 receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19014-19020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the question whether the IL-6R can also be internalized independently of gp130 and if this depends on the presence of its ligand IL-6. In order to analyze the influence of gp130 on IL-6R internalization, we retrovirally transduced Ba/F3 cells with the IL-6R alone, with the IL-6R in combination with gp130, or with an IL-6R variant whose ICD was replaced with the ICD of gp130 (Fig. 4A). These cells were subjected to an internalization assay in the presence or absence of IL-6. We observed constitutive internalization of the IL-6R when gp130 was coexpressed (Ba/F3-gp130-IL-6R cells), and consistent with our data from THP-1 cells with endogenous IL-6R, IL-6 had no significant influence on IL-6R internalization (Fig. 4B). In cells lacking gp130 (Ba/F3-IL-6R), the IL-6R was also internalized constitutively irrespective of the ligand, but the IL-6R internalization appeared slower compared with the Ba/F3-gp130-IL-6R cells (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the chimeric IL-6R variant (Ba/F3-IL-6 R/gp130-ICD) closely resembled the internalization kinetics of the Ba/F3-gp130-IL-6R, but not of the Ba/F3-IL-6R cells (Fig. 4D). We concluded from these data that the IL-6R can be internalized without the presence of gp130, but that the ICD of gp130 accelerates the turnover of the IL-6R. To further decipher the role of IL-6R inherent internalization motifs, we either removed the ICD of the IL-6R (termed IL-6RΔICD) or mutated the tyrosine residue at position 408 (termed IL-6R-Y/A) or the leucine/isoleucine residues at positions 427/428 (termed IL-6R-LI/AA) and generated stably transduced Ba/F3-gp130 cell lines (Fig. 4E). Afterwards, we performed a similar internalization assay with these three cell lines. As shown in Figure 4, F–H, addition of IL-6 had no influence on IL-6R internalization in all three cell lines. Interestingly, however, IL-6R internalization was decreased in all cell lines, suggesting a regulatory role for the two motifs and the intracellular region as a whole (Fig. 4, F–H). Because all generated cell lines are derived from individual clones, a more detailed comparison of the cell lines is not permissible. Collectively, the data shown argue against ligand-induced internalization of IL-6 R/gp130 and favor constitutive internalization of both receptors. Furthermore, the IL-6R can be internalized in the absence of gp130, although gp130 and especially its ICD enhance IL-6R internalization. As we could show that the inhibition of clathrin and dynamin prevented IL-6R internalization, we next sought to analyze the consequences on IL-6 signal transduction. Therefore, we analyzed STAT3 phosphorylation by Western blot in THP-1 cells that were stimulated for different time periods with IL-6 and pretreated with Dyngo-4a (blocking dynamin), Pit-Stop2 (blocking clathrin), or DMSO as a control (Fig. 5, A and B). In cells pretreated with DMSO only, IL-6 stimulation induced a strong phosphorylation of STAT3 after 15 min that was almost abrogated after 60 min. In contrast, when cells were pretreated with Dyngo-4a, STAT3 phosphorylation after IL-6 stimulation was detectable, but strongly reduced compared with the control (Fig. 5A). The treatment with Pit-Stop2 before IL-6 stimulation prevented any subsequent phosphorylation of STAT3 within the time period of 120 min (Fig. 5B). However, both inhibitors slightly reduced total STAT3 levels, which might contribute to the reduction in STAT3 phosphorylation. In a further approach we transfected HeLa cells with the C-terminal part of AP180, which is a dominant-negative form of this clathrin-binding protein (DN-AP180). This variant still binds to clathrin but leads to its mislocalization and thereby impedes the formation of clathrin-coated pits (26Zhao X. Greener T. Al-Hasani H. Cushman S.W. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. Expression of auxilin or AP180 inhibits endocytosis by mislocalizing clathrin: Evidence for formation of nascent pits containing AP1 or AP2 but not clathrin.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 353-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In line with our previous results, overexpression of DN-AP180 led to a strongly reduced STAT3 activation upon IL-6 stimulation in comparison with GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 5C). In addition to clathrin-mediated endocytosis, endophilin-mediated endocytosis, which is completely independent of clathrin, has recently been described (27Boucrot E. Ferreira A.P.A. Almeida-Souza L. Debard S. Vallis Y. Howard G. Bertot L. Sauvonnet N. McMahon H.T. Endophilin marks and controls a clathrin-independent endocytic pathway.Nature. 2015; 517: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 28Renard H.-F. Simunovic M. Lemière J. Boucrot E. Garcia-Castillo M. Arumugam S. Chambon V. Lamaze C. Wunder C. Kenworthy A.K. Schmidt A.A. McMahon H.T. Sykes C. Bassereau P. Johannes L. Endophilin-A2 functions in membrane scission in clathrin-independent endocytosis.Nature. 2015; 517: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Hence, we investigated whether this pathway had any influence on IL-6-mediated signaling. Therefore, we overexpressed the BAR domains of endophilin A1, A2, and A3 lacking their N-terminal amphipathic helix, which proved to be efficient inhibitors for the endophilin-dependent internalization (27Boucrot E. Ferreira A.P.A. Almeida-Souza L. Debard S. Vallis Y. Howard G. Bertot L. Sauvonnet N. McMahon H.T. Endophilin marks and controls a clathrin-independent endocytic pathway.Nature. 2015; 517: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). We expressed these constructs transiently in HeLa cells, stimulated them with IL-6, and analyzed STAT3 phosphorylation via Western blot (Fig. 5, D–F). We could not detect a major difference in STAT3 activation in these cells compared with GFP-expressing cells, although STAT3 phosphorylation appeared slightly enhanced when one of the endophilin constructs was overexpressed. However, our results exclude a major role for endophilin-mediated endocytosis in IL-6 signaling. Thus, we concluded that internalization of the IL-6 R/gp130 complex is necessary for STAT3 activation, but that this is not dependent on endophilin, but on clathrin- and dynamin-dependent mechanisms. Following internalization, receptors are directed from the early endosomes to lysosomes for degradation or to recycling endosomes to be redirected to the plasma membrane. In order to analyze the intracellular fate of the IL-6R and gp130, we did a pulse-chase experiment to analyze a possible targeting of both receptors to lysosomes following internalization. For this purpose, we labeled surface IL-6R on overexpressing HeLa cells with an antibody at 4 °C and shifted the cells afterward to 37 °C in the presence or absence of IL-6 for different periods of time. After fixation and permeabilization, localization of the receptor to lysosomes was detected by adding a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody and analyzing colocalization with the lysosome-associated marker protein 2 (LAMP-2). We could clearly detect colocalization of the internalized IL-6R with LAMP-2, indicating targeting of the receptor to lysosomes after endocytosis (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, the amount of lysosomal IL-6R increased over time, but was not affected by the presence of IL-6 (Fig. 6B). Thus, ligand binding did not induce lysosomal degradation, indicating that the IL-6R was constitutively directed to lysosomes. In addition, we also analyzed lysosomal targeting of gp130 following stimulation with IL-6 (Fig. 6C). As for the IL-6R, colocalization of gp130 with LAMP-2 increased over time (Fig. 6D). However, the process was accelerated when the cells were stimulated with IL-6, and significantly more gp130 colocalized with LAMP-2. There was an increase of gp130/LAMP-2 colocalization already 15 min after addition of cytokine. These results suggest that the IL-6/IL-6 R/gp130 complex is disassembled following endocytosis, and the two receptor subunits are differentially targeted to lysosomal degradation. Having analyzed the trafficking of the IL-6 signaling complex to lysosomes, we next wanted to examine whether IL-6R and gp130 were recycled back to the cell surface. For this purpose, we adapted a procedure from the Kveiborg lab (29Stautz D. Leyme A. Grandal M.V. Albrechtsen R. van Deurs B. Wewer U. Kveiborg M. Cell-surface metalloprotease ADAM12 is internalized by a clathrin- and Grb2-dependent mechanism.Traffic. 2012; 13: 1532-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and stained IL-6R-transfected HeLa cells with a specific antibody against the IL-6R at 37 °C for 1 h to allow internalization of the IL-6R–antibody complexes. The remaining antibody bound to the cell surface was then removed by stripping with an acidic buffer before AlexaFlour488-conjugated secondary antibody was applied for 1 h at 37 °C to stain recycled receptor molecules that reappeared on the surface of the cells. As negative control, only secondary but not primary antibody was applied. To confirm the performance of the stripping buffer (strip control), cells were stained with secondary antibody after stripping at 4 °C to impede recycling. When cells were not stimulated with IL-6, only few cells showed fluorescent staining at the cell-surface (Fig. 7B, upper panels). In contrast, stimulation of the cells with IL-6 increased IL-6R recycling as indicated by an increase of AlexaFlour488-positive cells compared with unstimulated cells (Fig. 7A, lower panels), and quantification revealed a statistically significant increase in IL-6R recycling when cells were stimulated with IL-6 (Fig. 7B). Importantly, due to the absence of signal at the cell surface in the strip control cells, we ensured that IL-6R detected at the cell surface indeed underwent internalization and recycling. These results suggest that recycling of the IL-6R, in contrast to internalization, was increased in the presence of the ligand. In order to further verify this observation, we did immunofluorescence stainings in HeLa cells of the IL-6R and Rab11, a marker for recycling endosomes (30Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. Rab11 regulates recycling through the pericentriolar recycling endosome.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). In accordance with our previous results, stimulation of the cells with IL-6 led to a statistically significant increase of colocalization of both proteins at 15, 30, and 60 min (Fig. 7, C and D). In analogy to the IL-6R, gp130 has previously been shown to be ligand-independently and constitutively internalized ("

https://openalex.org/W3131282537,"Renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) is a pathological process that fibrotic components are excessively deposited in the renal interstitial space due to kidney injury, resulting in impaired renal function and chronic kidney disease. The molecular mechanisms controlling renal fibrosis are not fully understood. In this present study, we identified Nuclear protein 1 (Nupr1), a transcription factor also called p8, as a novel regulator promoting renal fibrosis. Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) time-dependently induced Nupr1 mRNA and protein expression in mouse kidneys while causing renal damage and fibrosis. Nupr1 deficiency (Nupr1−/−) attenuated the renal tubule dilatation, tubular epithelial cell atrophy, and interstitial collagen accumulation caused by UUO. Consistently, Nupr1−/− significantly decreased the expression of type I collagen, myofibroblast markers smooth muscle α-actin (α-SMA), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP-1), and vimentin in mouse kidney that were upregulated by UUO. These results suggest that Nupr1 protein was essential for fibroblast activation and/or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during renal fibrogenesis. Indeed, Nupr1 was indispensable for TGF-β-induced myofibroblast activation of kidney interstitial NRK-49F fibroblasts, multipotent mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells, and the EMT of kidney epithelial NRK-52E cells. It appears that Nupr1 mediated TGF-β-induced α-SMA expression and collagen synthesis by initiating Smad3 signaling pathway. Importantly, trifluoperazine (TFP), a Nupr1 inhibitor, alleviated UUO-induced renal fibrosis. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Nupr1 promotes renal fibrosis by activating myofibroblast transformation from both fibroblasts and tubular epithelial cells."

Mammalian DAT has been observed to form oligomers, although the mechanisms of oligomerization and its role in DAT activity and trafficking remain largely unknown. We discovered a series of small molecule compounds that stabilize trimers and induce high-order oligomers of DAT and concomitantly promote its clathrin-independent endocytosis. Using a combination of chemical cross-linking, fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy, antibody-uptake endocytosis assay, live-cell lattice light sheet microscopy, ligand binding and substrate transport kinetics analyses, and molecular modeling and simulations, we investigated molecular basis of DAT oligomerization and endocytosis induced by these compounds. Our study showed that small molecule–induced DAT oligomerization and endocytosis are favored by the inward-facing DAT conformation and involve interactions of four hydrophobic residues at the interface between transmembrane (TM) helices TM4 and TM9. Surprisingly, a corresponding quadruple DAT mutant displays altered dopamine transport kinetics and increased cocaine-analog binding. The latter is shown to originate from an increased preference for outward-facing conformation and inward-to-outward transition. Taken together, our results demonstrate a direct coupling between conformational dynamics of DAT, functional activity of the transporter, and its oligomerization leading to endocytosis.

The plasma membrane dopamine transporter (DAT) regulates dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in the central nervous system by mediating the reuptake of DA following its release by dopaminergic neurons (1Giros B. el Mestikawy S.

The molecular mechanism of substrate transport by neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) family members has been extensively studied using biochemical, structural, and computational approaches. Our current understanding is an alternating access mechanism where binding of the substrate and Na+ ions to the extracellular (EC) vestibule of DAT in the outward-facing (OF) state triggers the transition to an occluded intermediate followed by an inward-facing (IF) state. The IF state, in turn, allows for the release of substrate and cations to the intracellular (IC) medium; and the transport cycle is completed by the return of DAT to its OF state (13Navratna V.

Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms mediating and regulating DAT oligomerization and their relation to substrate transport properties and IC trafficking remain largely unknown. We recently showed that furopyrimidine AIM-100, an inhibitor of the cytoplasmic activated CDC42 tyrosine kinase (ACK1/TNK2), induced dramatic oligomerization and clustering in cellular membranes of human DAT stably expressed in various cultured cells and endogenous mouse DAT (25Sorkina T.

It was proposed that oligomerization and clustering promoted DAT clathrin-independent and dynamin-independent endocytosis, which did not require ACK1 activity. However, ACK1 has been proposed to regulate constitutive DAT endocytosis (27Wu S. Bellve K.D. Fogarty K.E. Melikian H.E. Ack1 is a dopamine transporter endocytic brake that rescues a trafficking-dysregulated ADHD coding variant.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, the involvement of ACK1, if any, remained unclear as it might be conceivable that AIM-100–induced accumulation of DAT in endosomes resulted from a combination of ACK1-dependent and ACK1-independent effects. To eliminate the confounding effect of ACK1 and analyze ACK1-independent mechanisms that underlie DAT endocytosis, we searched for AIM-100–like (AL) compounds that induce DAT oligomerization and endocytosis but do not inhibit ACK1. Our analysis using these small molecules and DAT mutagenesis revealed the key role of the preferred conformational state and dynamics of DAT as well as selected amino acids in TM helices TM4 and TM9 in augmenting oligomerization and promoting endocytosis. The results expose a striking coupling between intramolecular conformational dynamics, intermolecular association, and endocytosis events and suggest novel strategies for modulating DAT activity. Treatment of cells with AIM-100 induces DAT oligomerization, detected by SDS-PAGE as a robust accumulation of high molecular mass SDS-resistant species and promotes DAT clustering in the plasma membrane and endocytosis (25Sorkina T.

These compounds were structurally similar to AIM-100 with or without the two phenyl groups attached to a central scaffold, with a variable third side chain or with di-phenyl-modified central scaffold, including the DA reuptake inhibitor, GBR12935 (Figs. 1A and S1). Among ALs, AL3, 4 and 8 caused the largest redistribution of the YFP-HA-DAT immunoreactivity—from monomeric ∼90 to 100 kDa (M-DAT) to ∼270 to 300 kDa and additional larger species (Fig. 1B), even though the extent of oligomerization was typically smaller than that induced by AIM-100. We will refer to the 270 to 300 kDa SDS-resistant species as a trimer (T-DAT), notwithstanding that it could be an oligomer of a different stoichiometry in intact cells. A small amount of the same trimer species was detected in lysates of vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 1B). Importantly, chemical cross-linking with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) in untreated or vehicle-treated cells significantly increased the fraction of YFP-HA-DAT trimers (Fig. 1C). Likewise, BS3 amplified AL-induced increase in DAT trimerization and high-order oligomerization (example with AL3 is shown; Fig. 1C). Cross-linking did not result in the appearance of a band, corresponding to YFP-HA-DAT dimer, indicating that the 270 to 300 kDa species is a minimal BS3-cross-linkable constitutive oligomer that can be stabilized by ALs. AL3 and AL4 are highly similar to AIM-100 with furopyrimidine as the central scaffold, whereas AL8 has a different scaffold—triazine (Fig. 1A). Triazine-based AL9 that lacks the pyridyl sidechain (Fig. 1A) was ineffective and used as the negative control to AL8 (Fig. 1B). The effects on DAT oligomerization were studied at concentrations of AL3, AL4, and AL8 of 10 to 40 μM. For consistency with previous work (25Sorkina T. Ma S. Larsen M.B. Watkins S.C. Sorkin A. Small molecule induced oligomerization, clustering and clathrin-independent endocytosis of the dopamine transporter.Elife. 2018; 7: e32293Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we adopted concentrations of 20 to 40 μM for all ALs in subsequent experiments. However, AL3, AL4, and AL8 as well as AIM-100 are poorly soluble in aqueous liquids (see Fig. S1). As a result, they had effects of variable strengths on DAT and may be equally effective at lower concentrations. AL3 and AL4 significantly increased oligomerization of endogenous HA-DAT in mouse striatal synaptosomes isolated from HA-DAT knock-in mice (31Rao A. Richards T.L. Simmons D. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. Epitope-tagged dopamine transporter knock-in mice reveal rapid endocytic trafficking and filopodia targeting of the transporter in dopaminergic axons.FASEB J. 2012; 26: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D; left panel). The minimal SDS-resistant oligomer was ∼200 kDa, which precisely corresponds to a trimer of the 65 kDa monomeric HA-DAT. AL8 did not induce significant DAT oligomerization in synaptosomes that were routinely prepared and maintained in the glucose-supplemented Krebs-Ring buffer (KRHG) (Fig. 1D; left panel) but increased the fraction of HA-DAT oligomers by 35% (SD = 5%) in the presence of 1:1 mixture of KRHG and F12 medium (Fig. 1D, right panel). Given the metal-binding properties of AL8 (32Bellam R. Raju G.G. Anipindi N.R. Jaganyi D. Kinetics and mechanism of base hydrolysis of tris(3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazine)iron(II) in aqueous and micellar media.Transit. Metal Chem. 2016; 41: 271-278Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), it is possible that the presence of metals in F12 medium was necessary for its effect on DAT. Direct fluorescence microscopy imaging of YFP-HA-DAT showed that a 2-h treatment of cells with AL3 and AL4 strongly induced the endocytosis of YFP-HA-DAT (Fig. 2A). The accumulation of YFP-HA-DAT in vesicular compartments was accompanied by a reduction in its levels at the filopodium-like plasma membrane protrusions and ruffles (Fig. 2A). AL8 had a less pronounced effect on the appearance of YFP-containing vesicles, which were typically dimmer (apparent smaller size) as compared with those vesicles in cells treated with AIM-100 or AL3/4 (Fig. 2A). However, an accumulation of YFP-HA-DAT in vesicles induced by AL8 was evident when images were compared with those of cells treated with AL9 that had no visible effect on YFP-HA-DAT localization. Vesicular YFP-HA-DAT was significantly co-localized with early endosomal antigen EEA.1, a marker of early endosomes, in cells treated with AIM-100, AL3, AL4, or AL8 but not in cells treated with vehicle or AL9 (Figs. 2B and S2). Cell-surface biotinylation assays confirmed robust AIM-100/AL-induced DAT endocytosis manifested by downregulation of the plasma membrane YFP-HA-DAT (Fig. 2, C and D). Notably, monomeric ∼70-kD (iM-DAT) and putative trimeric ∼200-kD (iT-DAT) species of immature YFP-HA-DAT were detected only in lysates but not in the plasma membrane fraction (“NeuAv”; Fig. 2B), indicating that both these species were of IC (endoplasmic reticulum) origin. Prompted by observations of AL-induced oligomerization and endocytosis, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy to demonstrate the effect of ALs on DAT oligomerization in single living cells. Constitutive and AIM-100–induced oligomerization of DAT had been previously demonstrated by live-cell FRET microscopy (18Sorkina T. Doolen S. Galperin E. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 28274-28283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 25Sorkina T. Ma S. Larsen M.B. Watkins S.C. Sorkin A. Small molecule induced oligomerization, clustering and clathrin-independent endocytosis of the dopamine transporter.Elife. 2018; 7: e32293Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We used the same method of sensitized FRET measurements in cells co-expressing CFP-DAT and YFP-DAT treated with ALs. The intensity of FRET from CFP to YFP was found to be significantly higher in the plasma membrane clusters and endosomes in AL3-, AL4-, and AL8-treated cells compared with that in vehicle-treated cells, where FRET measurements were taken in the regions of DAT accumulation, such as filopodia, ruffles, and cell–cell contacts. (Fig. 2, E and F). An increased FRET in AL-treated cells is indicative of the close proximity (<5 nm) of multiple DAT molecules, in support of AL-induced DAT oligomerization in living cells. AL3, AL4, and AL8 did not cause any detectable SDS-resistant oligomerization and endocytosis of norepinephrine (NET) and serotonin transporters (SERT) (Fig. S3). This type of selectivity against DAT and not against other NSS family members is a feature shared with AIM-100 (25Sorkina T. Ma S. Larsen M.B. Watkins S.C. Sorkin A. Small molecule induced oligomerization, clustering and clathrin-independent endocytosis of the dopamine transporter.Elife. 2018; 7: e32293Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, to test whether ALs affect constitutive or stimuli-induced clathrin-mediated and clathrin-independent endocytosis of other cargoes, we used PAE cells stably expressing high level of GFP-tagged epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-GFP) (33Carter R.E. Sorkin A. Endocytosis of functional epidermal growth factor receptor- green fluorescent protein chimera.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35000-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). When stimulated with saturating ligand concentrations, EGFR has been shown to internalize via a clathrin-independent pathway (34Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Clathrin-independent endocytosis of ubiquitinated cargos.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Fig. S4 demonstrates that ALs did not increase endocytosis of EGFR-GFP over its basal constitutive level and did not alter the clathrin-independent endocytosis of EGFR-GFP stimulated by 100 ng/ml EGF. In the same cells, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, assessed by imaging of the uptake of fluorescent transferrin, was also not affected by ALs (Fig. S4). Importantly, unlike AIM-100, AL3, AL4, and AL8 did not inhibit the kinase activity of ACK1, as measured by probing the tyrosine autophosphorylation of ACK1 in HeLa cells in which ACK1 was activated upon cell stimulation with EGF (Fig. 2G). These data confirm that the effects of AIM-100 and ALs on DAT oligomerization and endocytic trafficking are independent of ACK1 activity. AIM-100–induced DAT oligomerization and endocytosis were shown to be inhibited by the DAT antagonist, cocaine (25Sorkina T. Ma S. Larsen M.B. Watkins S.C. Sorkin A. Small molecule induced oligomerization, clustering and clathrin-independent endocytosis of the dopamine transporter.Elife. 2018; 7: e32293Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here, we show that all effects of AL3, AL4, and AL8 on DAT were also inhibited by cocaine (Fig. 3). The inhibition of DAT oligomerization by cocaine was partial but significant in all experiments (Fig. 3, A and B). Cocaine strongly blocked small molecule–induced endocytosis measured using the HA antibody uptake assay (Fig. 3, C and D). Notably, the accumulation of YFP-HA-DAT in endosomes induced by 20 μM AL8 was statistically significant but much smaller than that in cells treated with AL3 or AL4 (Fig. 3D), although further increase in DAT endocytosis was observed at high AL8 concentrations (40 μM). Because AL8 had a weaker effect on DAT endocytosis, we classify it as “partially effective” (Fig. S1). Altogether, the data in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and their supplements demonstrate the DAT-specific and cocaine-sensitive effects of ALs on the oligomerization and endocytosis of recombinant human YFP-HA-DAT and endogenous mouse HA-DAT and confirm that these effects are not associated with the inhibition ACK1. To determine which DAT residues play a dominant role in the AIM-100/AL-induced oligomerization and endocytosis, we conducted site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Our recent study pointed to the involvement of TM4 and TM9, the latter containing a putative leucine heptad or “zipper” motif, in the AIM-100–induced stabilization of DAT trimer (26Cheng M.H. Ponzoni L. Sorkina T. Lee J.Y. Zhang S. Sorkin A. Bahar I. Trimerization of dopamine transporter triggered by AIM-100 binding: Molecular mechanism and effect of mutations.Neuropharmacology. 2019; 161: 107676Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Alanine-substitution of multiple TM9 leucine residues revealed that the L459 A mutation impaired AIM-100/AL-induced endocytosis when the mutant was transiently expressed. However, this effect was not statistically significant in cells stably expressing this mutant. Recent studies by Navratna et al. revealed that the mutation of I248 (TM4) to an aromatic residue resulted in a π-stacking interaction between F/Y248 and F457 of TM9 (35Navratna V. Tosh D.K. Jacobson K.A. Gouaux E. Thermostabilization and purification of the human dopamine transporter (hDAT) in an inhibitor and allosteric ligand bound conformation.PLoS One. 2018; 13: e0200085Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The TM4–TM9 association prompted us to test the effects of the I248Y substitution. The I248Y mutant of YFP-HA-DAT displayed a partially reduced response to AIM-100 and ALs, although this reduction was again not statistically significant. Encouraged by the trends observed with I248Y and L459A mutants and because the AIM-100/AL-effects are unique to DAT, we generated a quadruple mutant where we replaced four TM4 and TM9 residues by their SERT counterparts: I248F, V249T, L458F, and L459G. This mutant will be shortly referred to as the “TM4-9” mutant (Fig. 4A). We hypothesized that the introduction of SERT-like residues, including two phenylalanines, into TM4 and TM9 of DAT could rewire the interactions between these helices, such that AIM-100/AL binding and/or AIM-100/AL-induced DAT oligomerization might be impeded. In support of this hypothesis, we observed a substantial decrease in the fraction of oligomers (T-DAT) induced by AIM-100 and ALs in the TM4-9 mutant compared with that in the WT YFP-HA-DAT (Fig. 4, B and C). Moreover, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy demonstrated only a minimal, if any, AIM-100 induced clustering of the TM4-9 mutant at the cell surface (Fig. S5). Interestingly, the constitutive oligomerization of the TM4-9 mutant (∼270–300 kDa species) was slightly increased compared with WT YFP-HA-DAT (Fig. 4, B and C). In parallel with the decrease in AIM-100/AL-induced oligomerization, AIM-100 and ALs did not induce significant endocytosis of the TM4-9 mutant as observed on the images of direct YFP fluorescence and using the antibody uptake internalization assay (Figs. 4, D, E and S6). By contrast, endocytosis triggered by phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) was similar in WT YFP-HA-DAT and TM4-9 mutant expressing cells (Fig. 4, D and E), demonstrating that this mutant was otherwise capable of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (36Sorkina T. Hoover B.R. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. Constitutive and protein kinase C-induced internalization of the dopamine transporter is mediated by a clathrin-dependent mechanism.Traffic. 2005; 6: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Overall, the data in Figure 4 and its supplements showed that residues I248/V249 in TM4 and L458/L459 in TM9 are involved in the oligomerization and clathrin-independent endocytosis of DAT induced by AIM-100 and ALs. The above experiments showed that cocaine binding and quadruple mutations had similar effects, both suppressing the oligomerization and internalization of DAT, which would be otherwise induced by AIM-100 or ALs. This observation suggests that both had a comparable effect on the molecular structure and mechanics, resulting in similar observables. To understand the mechanistic basis of the observed phenomena at the molecular level, we examined the change in the conformational dynamics of the quadruple mutant compared with that of WT DAT by carrying"

Dysregulation of glucose metabolism is a common feature of most cancer cells (1Pavlova N.N. Thompson C.B. The emerging hallmarks of cancer metabolism.Cell Metab. 2016; 23: 27-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). The elevated glycolytic flux in cancer cells has two origins: adaptation to hypoxia (anaerobic glycolysis) and adaptation to high proliferation rates (aerobic glycolysis, also known as the “Warburg effect”) (2Otto Warburg B. Wind F. Negelein N. The metabolism of tumours in the body.J. Gen. Physiol. 1927; 8: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (2248) Google Scholar). This higher glycolytic flux provides cancer cells with the energy and biomass essential for the sustainment of their anabolic growth. At the end of the glycolytic pathway stands the reduction of pyruvate to lactate catalyzed by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) family. While lactate has long been considered as a mere byproduct of glycolysis, it is now regarded as a potential purpose of accelerated glycolysis in cancer, in the light of the numerous benefits it provides to tumor growth (3San-Millán I. Brooks G.A. Reexamining cancer metabolism: Lactate production for carcinogenesis could be the purpose and explanation of the Warburg effect.Carcinogenesis. 2017; 38: 119-133PubMed Google Scholar).

Lactate metabolism further establishes a metabolic symbiosis between oxidative cancer cells that use lactate preferentially to glucose as a fuel and glycolytic cancer cells that rapidly convert glucose to lactate (13Sonveaux P. Végran F. Schroeder T. Wergin M.C. Verrax J. Rabbani Z.N. De Saedeleer C.J. Kennedy K.M. Diepart C. Jordan B.F. Kelley M.J. Gallez B. Wahl M.L. Feron O. Dewhirst M.W. Targeting lactate-fueled respiration selectively kills hypoxic tumor cells in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3930-3942PubMed Google Scholar). Lactate oxidation to pyruvate by LDHs further promotes lysosomal acidification and autophagy (14Brisson L. Bański P. Sboarina M. Dethier C. Danhier P. Fontenille M.-J. Van Hée V.F. Vazeille T. Tardy M. Falces J. Bouzin C. Porporato P.E. Frédérick R. Michiels C.

LDHs are key enzymes at the core of this adaptive metabolism as they catalyze the terminal reaction of lactate biosynthesis with the interconversion of pyruvate and NADH to lactate and NAD+. LDHs function as obligate tetramers constituted by the homoassociation or heteroassociation of two isoenzymes, LDH-H (lactate dehydrogenase heart isozyme; encoded by the LDHB gene) and LDH-M (lactate dehydrogenase muscle isozyme; encoded by the LDHA gene) (15Payen V.L. Mina E. Van Hée V.F. Porporato P.E. Sonveaux P. Monocarboxylate transporters in cancer.Mol. Metab. 2020; 33: 48-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These two isoenzymes show very high homology and identity (16Thabault L. Brisson L. Brustenga C. Gache S.A.M. Kozlova A. Spillier Q. Liberelle M. Benyahia Z. Messens J. Copetti T. Sonveaux P.

The two LDH homotetramers, lactate dehydrogenase heart isozyme homotetramer (LDH-1) (LDH-H4) and lactate dehydrogenase muscle isozyme homotetramer (LDH-5) (LDH-M4), are the most extensively studied forms of LDH and constitute appealing targets for cancer therapy (17Rani R.

Intense efforts were initially devoted to selective LDH-5 inhibition because of its broad implication in cancer pathogenesis (19Xie H. Hanai J.I. Ren J.G. Kats L. Burgess K. Bhargava P. Signoretti S. Billiard J. Duffy K.J. Grant A. Wang X. Lorkiewicz P.K. Schatzman S. Bousamra M.

However, more recent reports about the implications of LDH-1 in cancer pathogenesis shed light on LDH-1 inhibition. First, LDH-1 was reported to interact with lysosomal vesicular ATPase, thus regulating autophagy, and is essential for metabolic reprogramming through p53 and Ras mutations (14Brisson L. Bański P. Sboarina M. Dethier C. Danhier P. Fontenille M.-J. Van Hée V.F. Vazeille T. Tardy M. Falces J. Bouzin C. Porporato P.E. Frédérick R. Michiels C.

Second, the LDHB gene was identified to be essential for triple-negative breast cancer (22McCleland M.L. Adler A.S. Shang Y. Hunsaker T. Truong T. Peterson D. Torres E. Li L. Haley B. Stephan J.P. Belvin M. Hatzivassiliou G. Blackwood E.M. Corson L. Evangelista M. et al.An integrated genomic screen identifies LDHB as an essential gene for triple-negative breast cancer.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 5812-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been shown that one LDH isoenzyme can compensate for the genetic disruption of the other in order to sustain the Warburg phenotype (23Ždralević M. Vučetić M. Daher B. Marchiq I. Parks S.K. Pouysségur J. Disrupting the ‘Warburg effect’ re-routes cancer cells to OXPHOS offering a vulnerability point via ‘ferroptosis’-induced cell death.Adv. Biol. Regul. 2018; 68: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Altogether, these studies support the idea that dual LDH inhibitors could bring an additional therapeutic value over selective isoenzyme inhibition. The therapeutic interest for LDH inhibition prompted the development of potent, dual or selective, active-site LDH inhibitors (24Dragovich P.S. Fauber B.P. Boggs J. Chen J. Corson L.B. Ding C.Z.

In fact, LDHs are usually recognized as poorly druggable targets, and different reasons can account for this. First, LDH active-site inhibitors face a challenge in achieving selectivity over other dehydrogenases, notably because of a common NAD-binding domain. For instance, gossypol derivatives, which are among the first LDH inhibitors reported (20Le A. Cooper C.R. Gouw A.M. Dinavahi R. Maitra A. Deck L.M. Royer R.E. Vander Jagt D.L. Semenza G.L. Dang C.V. Inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase A induces oxidative stress and inhibits tumor progression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gossypol prototype of inhibitors targeted to dinucleotide folds.Curr. Med. Chem. 2000; 7: 479-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Second, the LDH catalytic site presents nonoptimal physicochemical properties with high solvent exposure and hydrophilicity, leading to challenging absorption, distribution, metabolization, and excretion properties for most LDH active-site inhibitors (27Kohlmann A. Zech S.G. Li F. Zhou T. Squillace R.M. Commodore L. Greenfield M.T. Lu X. Miller D.P. Huang W.S. Qi J. Thomas R.M. Wang Y. Zhang S.

Tucker J.A. et al.Design and synthesis of novel lactate dehydrogenase A inhibitors by fragment-based lead generation.J. Med. Chem. 2012; 55: 3285-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Finally, an inherent difficulty in achieving therapeutic LDH inhibition stems from its high intracellular concentration; LDHs are indeed highly concentrated in cancer cells, with protein concentrations reported in the micromolar range (29Billiard J. Dennison J.B. Briand J. Annan R.S. Chai D. Colón M. Dodson C.S. Gilbert S.A. Greshock J. Jing J. Lu H. McSurdy-Freed J.E. Orband-Miller L.A. Mills G.B. Quinn C.J. et al.Quinoline 3-sulfonamides inhibit lactate dehydrogenase A and reverse aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells.Cancer Metab. 2013; 1: 19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This high cellular concentration often hampers the observation of cell-based inhibition below that micromolar threshold, even for the more potent nanomolar inhibitors reaching micromolar concentrations in tumors (29Billiard J. Dennison J.B. Briand J. Annan R.S. Chai D. Colón M. Dodson C.S. Gilbert S.A. Greshock J. Jing J. Lu H. McSurdy-Freed J.E. Orband-Miller L.A. Mills G.B.

These different challenges to LDH inhibition called for developing new strategies to target this enzymatic family of high therapeutic potential. To this end, tool compounds able to target the LDH oligomeric interface instead of its active site have been recently developed (16Thabault L. Brisson L. Brustenga C. Gache S.A.M. Kozlova A.

Jang S.B. et al.Machilin a inhibits tumor growth and macrophage M2 polarization through the reduction of lactic acid.Cancers (Basel). 2019; 11: 963Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Targeting a protein oligomeric state is still an underexplored strategy that can provide several benefits over active-site targeting and could thus overcome the existing difficulties encountered with LDH orthosteric inhibitors. Targeting LDH self-assembly could indeed lead to the identification of new and potentially more druggable allosteric sites (16Thabault L. Brisson L. Brustenga C. Gache S.A.M. Kozlova A. Spillier Q. Liberelle M. Benyahia Z. Messens J. Copetti T. Sonveaux P. Frédérick R. Interrogating the lactate dehydrogenase tetramerization site using (stapled) peptides.J. Med. Chem. 2020; 63: 4628-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, as LDH subunits can form homotetramers and heterotetramers, the tetrameric interface is shared between the two different isoenzymes. Targeting LDH tetrameric interface can thus yield to molecules disrupting both LDH-1 and LDH-5, which is in line with the current pan-LDH inhibition strategy (16Thabault L. Brisson L. Brustenga C. Gache S.A.M. Kozlova A. Spillier Q. Liberelle M. Benyahia Z. Messens J. Copetti T. Sonveaux P. Frédérick R. Interrogating the lactate dehydrogenase tetramerization site using (stapled) peptides.J. Med. Chem. 2020; 63: 4628-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Moreover, disruptors of protein self-assembly can induce protein misfolding and degradation (38Qi J. Dong Z. Liu J. Peery R.C. Zhang S. Liu J.Y. Zhang J.T. Effective targeting of the survivin dimerization interface with small-molecule inhibitors.Cancer Res. 2016; 76: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 39Gunderwala A.Y. Nimbvikar A.A. Cope N.J. Li Z. Wang Z. Development of allosteric BRAF peptide inhibitors targeting the dimer interface of BRAF.ACS Chem. Biol. 2019; 14: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, targeting the LDH oligomeric state could reduce its intracellular concentration, leading to substoichiometric inhibition, hence higher efficacy. To this end, we previously developed and characterized a dimeric model of LDH-H by truncating its N-terminal tetramerization domain (LDH-H truncated [LDH-Htr]) (16Thabault L. Brisson L. Brustenga C. Gache S.A.M. Kozlova A. Spillier Q. Liberelle M. Benyahia Z. Messens J. Copetti T. Sonveaux P. Frédérick R. Interrogating the lactate dehydrogenase tetramerization site using (stapled) peptides.J. Med. Chem. 2020; 63: 4628-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This model allows to study the LDH tetrameric interface and previously led to the identification of a first allosteric site involving the N-terminal residues. The present study reports on the existence of a second allosteric site, based on which we developed a new family of peptidic ligands functioning as LDH destabilizers. LDH quaternary state is a “dimer of dimers” (Fig. 1A) (40Schmidt R.K. Gready J.E. Molecular dynamics simulations of L-lactate dehydrogenase: Conformation of a mobile loop and influence of the tetrameric protein environment.J. Mol. Model. 1999; 5: 153-168Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 41Jaenicke R. Vogel W. Rudolph R. Dimeric intermediates in the dissociation of lactic dehydrogenase.Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). According to X-ray structures, three different subunit orientations could account for LDH dimeric conformation. We have indeed previously found that LDH N-terminal domain truncation leads to dimers (LDH-Htr) (Fig. 1A) (16Thabault L. Brisson L. Brustenga C. Gache S.A.M. Kozlova A. Spillier Q. Liberelle M. Benyahia Z. Messens J. Copetti T. Sonveaux P. Frédérick R. Interrogating the lactate dehydrogenase tetramerization site using (stapled) peptides.J. Med. Chem. 2020; 63: 4628-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous studies (35Jafary F. Ganjalikhany M.R. Moradi A. Hemati M. Jafari S. Novel peptide inhibitors for lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA): A survey to inhibit LDHA activity via disruption of protein-protein interaction.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), only the association of dimers A to C and B to D in a tetramer can explain the role of this N-terminal domain in the stabilization of the tetrameric state (Fig. 1A). Based on this hypothesis, we first mapped the interactions made by one subunit with an LDH dimer (A–C or B–D) using the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE; Chemical Computing Group [ChemComp]) software (42Molecular Operating Environment (MOE), 2019.01; Chemical Computing Group ULC, 1010 Sherbooke St. West, Suite #910, Montreal, QC, Canada, H3A 2R7, 2021.Google Scholar). Mapping these contact points highlighted two clusters: A (A1 and A2) and B (B1 and B2) (Fig. 1B). Clusters A1 and A2 corresponded to the LDH N-terminal tetramerization domain (Fig. 1C) and to its related tetramerization site, respectively, which were previously investigated (16Thabault L. Brisson L. Brustenga C. Gache S.A.M. Kozlova A. Spillier Q. Liberelle M. Benyahia Z. Messens J. Copetti T. Sonveaux P. Frédérick R. Interrogating the lactate dehydrogenase tetramerization site using (stapled) peptides.J. Med. Chem. 2020; 63: 4628-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Clusters B1 and B2 matched with a 22-amino acid α-helix and its interacting site, which to our knowledge were never reported before. Interestingly, the sequence corresponding to cluster B1 was highly conserved among vertebrates (Fig. S1). Overall, clusters A1 and B1 corresponded to continuous epitopes interacting with discontinuous oligomerization sites A2 and B2. Next, we aimed to confirm this interaction model and the anticipated symmetry axis of LDH dimers using our model of dimeric LDH (LDH-Htr) (16Thabault L. Brisson L. Brustenga C. Gache S.A.M. Kozlova A. Spillier Q. Liberelle M. Benyahia Z. Messens J. Copetti T. Sonveaux P. Frédérick R. Interrogating the lactate dehydrogenase tetramerization site using (stapled) peptides.J. Med. Chem. 2020; 63: 4628-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). According to the interaction map, LDH-Htr lacks cluster A1 but still possesses clusters A2, B1, and B2. We thus reasoned that LDH-Htr might still be able to self-interact at high concentrations via cluster B. Comparison between LDH-Htr and LDH-1 elution profiles by size-exclusion chromatography indeed suggested that LDH-Htr could be in an equilibrium between tetramers and dimers (16Thabault L. Brisson L. Brustenga C. Gache S.A.M. Kozlova A. Spillier Q. Liberelle M. Benyahia Z. Messens J. Copetti T. Sonveaux P. Frédérick R. Interrogating the lactate dehydrogenase tetramerization site using (stapled) peptides.J. Med. Chem. 2020; 63: 4628-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Consistently, the evaluation of LDH-Htr self-interaction by microscale thermophoresis (MST) revealed that the dimeric protein interacts with itself at high concentrations (Fig. 2A; Kd = 1.25 μM [0.96–1.62 μM]). According to our model, this interaction can only be the result of LDH-Htr forming dimers of dimers through cluster B. Monitoring this interaction using MST hence provided valuable information on the overall potency of cluster B. We then evaluated whether LDH-Htr self-association could stabilize the protein complex, as the oligomerization of a protein often results in its stabilization (43Thabault L. Liberelle M. Frédérick R. Targeting proteins self-association in drug design.Drug Discov. Today. 2021; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2021.01.028Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). LDH-Htr denaturation profile was evaluated using nanoscale differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) and revealed that the protein exhibited a concentration-dependent destabilization (Fig. 2B) and conformational change (Fig. 2C). We also evaluated LDH-Htr oligomeric state using mass photometry (MP). MP is a recent technique that allows for single-molecule detection and mass measurement in solution based on light scattering (44Young G. Hundt N. Cole D. Fineberg A. Andrecka J. Tyler A. Olerinyova A. Ansari A. Marklund E.G. Collier M.P. Chandler S.A. Tkachenko O. Allen J. Crispin M. Billington N. et al.Quantitative mass imaging of single biological macromolecules.Science. 2018; 360: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). MP analysis of LDH-Htr revealed an equilibrium between dimers and tetramers in solution (Fig. 2D). Altogether, these results demonstrated that the truncation of the LDH N-terminal domain does not entirely prevent the protein from forming tetramers. This ability of the truncated dimers to interact and form weak tetramers validated our in silico model and provided valuable information about this new tetrameric interface. We then set out to further"
https://openalex.org/W3131735488,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is initiated by dystrophin deficiency, but downstream pathophysiological pathways such as membrane instability, NFĸB activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and induction of TGFβ fibrosis pathways are thought to drive the disability. Dystrophin replacement strategies are hopeful for addressing upstream dystrophin deficiency; however, all methods to date use semi-functional dystrophin proteins that are likely to trigger downstream pathways. Thus, combination therapies that can target multiple downstream pathways are important in treating DMD, even for dystrophin-replacement strategies. We sought to define blood pharmacodynamic biomarkers of drug response in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy using a series of repurposed drugs. Four-week-old mdx mice were treated for four weeks with four different drugs singly and in combination: vehicle, prednisolone, vamorolone, rituximab, β-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) (11 treatment groups; n = 6/group). Blood was collected via cardiac puncture at study termination, and proteomic profiling was carried out using SOMAscan aptamer panels (1,310 proteins assayed). Prednisolone was tested alone and in combination with other drugs. It was found to have a good concordance of prednisolone-responsive biomarkers (56 increased by prednisolone, 39 decreased) focused on NFκB and TGFβ cascades. Vamorolone shared 45 (80%) of increased biomarkers and 13 (33%) of decreased biomarkers with prednisolone. Comparison of published human corticosteroid-responsive biomarkers to our mdx data showed 14% (3/22) concordance between mouse and human. Rituximab showed fewer drug-associated biomarkers, with the most significant being human IgG. On the other hand, BAIBA treatment (high and low dose) showed a drug-associated increase in 40 serum proteins and decreased 5 serum proteins. Our results suggest that a biomarker approach could be employed for assessing drug combinations in both mouse and human studies."
https://openalex.org/W3132712574,"Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ) populations have experienced widespread declines in abundance and abrupt shifts toward younger and smaller adults returning to spawn in rivers. The causal agents underpinning these shifts are largely unknown. Here we investigate the potential role of late-stage marine mortality, defined as occurring after the first winter at sea, in driving this species’ changing age structure. Simulations using a stage-based life cycle model that included additional mortality during after the first winter at sea better reflected observed changes in the age structure of a well-studied and representative population of Chinook salmon from the Yukon River drainage, compared with a model estimating environmentally-driven variation in age-specific survival alone. Although the specific agents of late-stage mortality are not known, our finding is consistent with work reporting predation by salmon sharks ( Lamna ditropis ) and marine mammals including killer whales ( Orcinus orca ). Taken as a whole, this work suggests that Pacific salmon mortality after the first winter at sea is likely to be higher than previously thought and highlights the need to investigate selective sources of mortality, such as predation, as major contributors to rapidly changing age structure of spawning adult Chinook salmon."
https://openalex.org/W3133395283,"Gorham-Stout disease (GSD) is a very rare disease characterized by increased bone erosion with angiomatous proliferation. The mechanisms underlying this disorder have not been deeply investigated. Due to its rarity, no guidelines are currently available for treatment and management of GSD. We recently evaluated the cellular alterations of the bone remodeling in patients showing that osteoclast precursors displayed increased ability to differentiate into osteoclasts and that affected osteoclasts resorb bone more actively than control cells. Moreover, osteoblasts isolated from a patient showed a defective ability to form mineralized nodules. In this paper, we investigated the molecular pathways involved in the cellular defects of GSD bone cells. For this study, we recruited nine patients and performed miRNome analysis of bone cells. Between the 178 miRNAs robustly expressed in GSD osteoclasts, significant modulation of three miRNAs (miR-1246, miR-1-3p, and miR-137-3p) involved in the regulation of osteoclast formation and activity or in the angiomatous proliferation was found in patients' cells. Interestingly, miR-1246 was also up-regulated in serum exosomes from patients. Analysis of miRNAs from patient osteoblasts suggested alteration of miR-204a-5p, miR-615-3p and miR-378a-3p regulating osteoblast function and differentiation. The resulting miRNA pattern may help to understand better the mechanisms involved in GSD and to identify new potential therapeutic targets for this rare disease."
https://openalex.org/W3118019486,"The increasing prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) caused nosocomial infections generate significant comorbidity and can cause death among patients. Current treatment options are limited. These infections pose great difficulties for infection control and clinical treatment. To identify the antimicrobial resistance, carbapenemases and genetic relatedness of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood, a total of 50 nonrepetitive CSF isolates and 44 blood isolates were collected. The resistance phenotypes were determined, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to examine the mechanisms of carbapenem resistance. Finally, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was conducted to determine the genetic relatedness of these isolates. It was observed that 88 of the 94 collected isolates were resistant to imipenem or meropenem. Among them, the bla OXA-23 gene was the most prevalent carbapenemase gene, with an observed detection rate of 91.5% (86/94), followed by the bla OXA-24 gene with a 2.1% detection rate (2/94). Among all carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) observations, isolates with the bla OXA-23 gene were resistant to both imipenem and meropenem. Interestingly, isolates positive for the bla OXA-24 gene but negative for the bla OXA-23 gene showed an imipenem-sensitive but meropenem-resistant phenotype. The MLST analysis identified 21 different sequence types (STs), with ST195, ST540 and ST208 most frequently detected (25.5%, 12.8% and 11.7%, respectively). 80 of the 94 isolates (85.1%) were clustered into CC92 which showed a carbapenem resistance phenotype (except AB13). Five novel STs were detected, and most of them belong to CRAB. In conclusion, these findings provide additional observations and epidemiological data of CSF and blood A . baumannii strains, which may improve future infection-control measures and aid in potential clinical treatments in hospitals and other clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W3133317948,"While details remain unclear, initiation of woven bone mineralization is believed to be mediated by collagen and potentially nucleated by bone sialoprotein (BSP). Interestingly, our recent publication showed that BSP and type XI collagen form complexes in mineralizing osteoblastic cultures.

An alternate splice variant “6a” sequence was not similarly co-localized. BSP and Col11a1 co-purify upon ion-exchange chromatography or immunoprecipitation. Binding of the Col11a1 “6b” exonal sequence to bone sialoprotein was demonstrated with overlapping peptides. Peptide 3, containing three unique lysine-triplet sequences, displayed the greatest binding to osteoblastic cultures; peptides containing fewer lysine triplet motifs or derived from the “6a” exon yielded dramatically lower binding. Similar results were obtained with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-conjugated peptides and western blots containing extracts from osteoblastic cultures. Mass spectroscopic mapping demonstrated that FAM-peptide 3 bound to 90 kDa BSP and its 18 to 60 kDa fragments, as well as to 110 kDa nucleolin.

Bone is a unique mineralized tissue which supports the body’s organs and muscles yet remains vital throughout an organism’s lifetime. Osteoblasts synthesize osteoid, the extracellular collagenous matrix of bone and direct the deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals within it during bone formation. Type I collagen is the main organic component of bone osteoid. However, it is also enriched with phosphoproteins, glycosaminoglycans, and presumptive nucleators of mineralization (1Bilezikian J.

It has long been hypothesized that certain structural interactions are required to induce bone mineralization in vivo. Two basic types of bone are known, e.g., cortical and trabecular.

With respect to collagen-mediated mineralization, Glimcher and Veis hypothesized that a phosphoprotein nucleator bound near the gap region of fibrillar type I collagen mediates initial nucleation and deposition of mineral crystals (5Glimcher M.J.

While the identity of this hypothetical phosphoprotein has never been identified, bone sialoprotein represents a candidate based on a large body of circumstantial evidence, e.g., its mineral nucleation capacity, phosphoprotein nature, large number of calcium binding sites, and its tight temporal and spatial tissue localization to mineralizing bone during development and in healing fractures (3Goldberg H.A.

As a means to investigate vesicle-mediated mineralization, we have studied biomineralization foci. Biomineralization foci (BMF) is discrete spherical extracellular structure produced by mineralizing osteoblastic cells in culture and in vivo within which initial mineral crystals are deposited inside membrane limited vesicles (12Gorski J.P.

We have used the UMR106-01 rat osteoblastic cell line because the mineralization process within individual BMF in each culture is synchronized and occurs rapidly within 24 h after addition of phosphate to the cells (14Wang C.

Our general hypothesis is that the protein composition of BMF is unique and reflects its functional capacity to produce hydroxyapatite crystals under cellular control. To test this hypothesis, we have focused our studies on defining the temporal sequence of events which precede mineral crystal deposition within BMF (14Wang C. Wang Y. Huffman N.T. Cui C. Yao X.

For example, Raman confocal spectroscopic analysis of BMF at different times revealed that hydroxyapatite formation within individual BMF complexes is a multistep process. Specifically, changes in protein-derived signals at 1004 and 1660 cm−1 were found to reflect events which precede or accompany mineral crystal production because they can be blocked by protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF) (14Wang C.

To test the concept that the protein composition of BMF is uniquely evolved for a role in mineral crystal formation, we isolated mineralized BMF with laser capture confocal microscopy (15Huffman N.T.

Consistent with this hypothesis, the results showed that the phosphoproteins bone sialoprotein and bone acidic glycoprotein-75 are preferentially localized to these structures. Furthermore, we showed that bone sialoprotein (BSP) is physically enriched on or in vesicles within biomineralization foci before mineral crystal formation (12Gorski J.P. Wang A. Lovitch D. Law D.

Interestingly, expression of these phosphoproteins temporally precedes mineral crystal formation and spatially demarks matrix sites in vivo and in vitro to which mineral crystals will be subsequently deposited. Recently, we have also demonstrated that BSP forms complexes with type XI collagen which can be immunoprecipitated from extracts of UMR106-01 osteoblastic cultures (16Gorski J.P.

As a result, initial, small diameter type I fibrils observable in normal and pathologic cornea, bone, and cartilage are heterotypic structures representing hybrid structures composed of type I and type V/XI collagens (25Birk D.E.

Importantly, these models place the retained N-terminal domain of the α1 chain of collagen type V/XI at the gap region on the fibril surface (28Vaughan-Thomas A. Young R.D. Phillips A.C. Duance V.C.

The structure of the large N-terminal domain (NTD) domain of the Col11a1 chain is composed of a common shared N-propeptide (Npp) domain and a variable region (VR) domain subject to alternative exon splicing. Depending upon the tissue type and developmental stage, at least seven sequence variants are expressed with different combinations of the VR domain exons 6a, 6b, 7, and 8. It is noteworthy that four unique triplet lysine repeat sequences comprise structural motifs that are encoded within the “6b” exon. Because expression of the “6b” exon is restricted to bone, we hypothesized that these unique positively charged motifs present an extracellular binding site for acidic matrix phosphoproteins such as bone sialoprotein in bone. Thus, the goal of this project was to determine whether bone sialoprotein and Col11a1 interact specifically within the extracellular matrix and in/on osteoblastic cells in culture and in developing bone. We have shown previously that biomineralization foci are extracellular sites within osteoblastic cultures and in healing bone fracture tissue in which initial calcium hydroxyapatite crystals are deposited (12Gorski J.P.

In a continuing effort to identify proteins which play a role in the mineralization process, we used laser capture microdissection to specifically isolate alizarin red–stained mineralized biomineralization foci (Fig. 1, A–C). Biomineralization foci (Fig. 1C) were preferentially separated from the cell layer (Fig. 1B). Isolated BMF (Fig. 1C) [(2000–3000)/preparation (∼60–80 μg protein)] were then dissociated in denaturing media and precipitated with acetone. Resultant samples were reduced and alkylated, split into equal parts, digested with trypsin, and double digested with trypsin/Glu-C protease and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis as described in Methods. Results of statistically significant peptide assignments based on these mass spectroscopic analyses are listed in Table 1. Interestingly, these assignments included bone sialoprotein, as well as the NTD of the Col11a1 chain. The NTD is an unusual extension preceding the collagenous, glycine-enriched, minor helix which, in contrast to other short-lived collagen propeptides, is at least partially retained within tissues. The NTD is composed of a shared Npp sequence (encoded by exons 1–5) and a variable VR sequence (encoded by exons 6a, 6b, 7, 8, and 9) (Fig. 2) (30Warner L.R. Blasick C.M. Brown R.J. Oxford J.T. Expression, purification, and refolding of recombinant collagen alpha1(XI) amino terminal domain splice variants.Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 52: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The two peptide sequences identified by LC-MS/MS are common to all seven alternatively spliced variants of Col11a1 NTD as part of the Npp region (Table 1 and Fig. 2).Table 1LC-MS/MS identification of peptides from two extracellular matrix proteins present in laser capture purified BMF from mineralizing UMR106-01 culturesProtein (Mascot score)UniProt Acc.#Peptides (position)Posttranslational modificationsIons score/ExpectEnz.Bone sialoprotein (458)P13839AEDSEENGVFK (28-38)KSSTVEYGEEYEQIGNEYNTAYETYDENNGEPR (257-289)S4(phospho)N8(deamidated)N19(deamidated)N29(deamidated)T4(phospho)57/1.2e-4TrypSSTVEYGEEYEQIGNEYNTAYETYDENNGEPR (258-289)N18(deamidated)N28(deamidated)82/4.5e-7TrypSSTVEYGEEYEQIGNEYNTAYETYDENNGEPR (258-289)N18(deamidated)N28(deamidated)90/6.1e-8TrypLAALQLPK (131-138)T3(phospho)(unmodified)51/6.3e-4TRYP/GluCCollagen alpha1 (XI) (343)Q61245RVSGSNEPNPVEEGFTEEYLTGEDYDVQR (322-350)N6(deamidated)107/1.5e-9TrypGVDGRDSDLLVDGDLGEYDFYEYK (362-385)Q28(deamidated)(unmodified)52/3.9e-4TrypBMF, biomineralization foci. Open table in a new tab BMF, biomineralization foci. To confirm that these proteins are localized to mineralization foci, extracts of laser captured BMF were compared by Western blotting with the same amount of protein/lane from extracts of total mineralized or unmineralized osteoblastic cell layer fractions. Under these conditions, a higher density band in BMF samples will reflect a quantitative enrichment. The results indicate that, on a relative basis, BSP protein is specifically enriched (∼10×) in the laser captured BMF as compared with the starting cell layer (Fig. 1D). When the type XI NTD “6b” or “8” specific epitopes were also probed, the former was also found to be enriched in the BMF sample as a 60 kDa fragment band while much lower amounts were evident in the +CL and −CL total extracts (Fig. 1D, middle panel). In contrast, epitope “8” (referring to exon 8) was not detectable in the BMF pool but was evident in both the +CL and −CL total extracts as a 110 kDa band. Finally, as a control, dentin matrix 1 was also probed to determine whether all acidic matrix phosphoproteins are localized to the laser captured mineralized biomineralization foci. Expression of dentin matrix protein1 is known to be increased upon exposure to beta-glycerolphosphate, which is added to +CL cultures to induce mineralization (Huffman and Gorski, unpublished result). However, it is evident that dentin matrix protein1, while strongly expressed as a monomeric band at 75 kDa within the cell layer of mineralized osteoblastic cultures, is not localized within BMF (Fig. 1D, right panel). In view of the co-localization of BSP and the 60 kDa “6b” containing NTD domain of type XI collagen within biomineralization foci, we then asked whether these two proteins may interact with each other. We have showed previously that the contents of mineralized biomineralization foci can be selectively extracted from UMR106-01 cultures with 50 mM EDTA, pH 7.5 (15Huffman N.T. Keightley J.A. Chaoying C. Midura R.J. Lovitch D. Veno P.A. Dallas S.L. Gorski J.P.

Chem. 2007; 282: 26002-26013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To further analyze the binding capacity of BSP for the Col11a1 NTD domain, we subjected these EDTA extracts to anion-exchange chromatography at pH 5.2. Under these conditions, it is predicted that cationic proteins like the 60 kDa NTD fragment would not bind to the resin and should be eluted directly. Data representative of triplicate runs are depicted in Figure 3A, where following sample application, proteins were eluted with a gradient of from 0.05 to 0.6 M NaCl followed by final step gradient with 2 M NaCl as a limit solvent. Column flow was monitored continuously for protein absorbance (214 and 280 nm) and conductivity, and equal aliquots of individual fractions were subjected to dot blotting with anti-BSP or Col11a1 NTD “6b” epitope specific antibodies (Fig. 3B). As evidenced by the UV-absorbance tracings, the majority of proteins in the EDTA extract eluted at about 0.2 M NaCl during the salt gradient. A sharp peak was also observed to elute with the 2 M NaCl step gradient (Fig. 3A). Dot immunoblotting of each fraction revealed several interesting points (Fig. 3B). BSP and “6b” epitope immunoreactivity both eluted predominantly with the 2 M NaCl step gradient. Based on staining, >80% of the “6b” immunoreactive 60 kDa fragment was found to co-elute with BSP in fractions #91 to 95 (compare Fig. 3, A and B). This conclusion is confirmed by Western blotting after fractions #91 to 95 were pooled for further analysis. Specifically, the pooled 2M NaCl fractions contain both full length BSP (90 kDa) and a 60 kDa Col11a1 “6b” immunoreactive NTD fragment (Fig. 3C). Maackia amurensis agglutinin lectin staining, which is restricted to BSP, also confirms its enrichment in the 2.0 M NaCl peak (Fig. 3C). Taken together, results in Figure 3 indicate that full length BSP is able to bind tightly to the Col11a1 NTD domain, e.g., resisting dissociation in high salt concentrations (>0.6 M NaCl). To quantitatively evaluate the relative sequence specificity of the BSP/Col11a1 NTD binding interaction, we carried out direct binding studies with a series of peptides representing parts of the variable region of the alternatively spliced NTD sequence. An inherent limitation associated with peptide studies is that they may not faithfully reproduce their native conformations. We focused our attention on exon 6 because the “6b” epitope was localized to BMF extracts along with BSP (Fig. 1D) and contained four lysine triplet sequences which appear to be a unique motif restricted to Col11a1 based on NCBI protein BLAST searches (Gorski, data not shown). Specifically, we tested three overlapping peptides derived from the 51-residue “6b” exon sequence (peptides 3, 4, and 5) and compared them with two “6a” exon-derived peptides which are themselves enriched in acidic amino acid residues (peptides 1 and 2) (Fig. 2 and Table 2). “6a” and “6b” represent competing choices during alternative splicing of the NTD domain and are not expressed in the same NTD domain. Peptides tested were each N-terminally conjugated with biotin to facilitate fluorescent detection.Table 2List of Col11a1 chain NTD-derived peptides used in binding studies (N terminally conjugated with FAM or biotin)PEPTIDE 1: biotin- or FAM-N-YAPEDIIEYDYEYGETDYK (6a derived peptide)PEPTIDE 2: biotin- or FAM-N-EAESVTEMPTVTEETVAQTE (6a derived peptide)PEPTIDE 3: biotin- or FAM-N-KKKSNYTKKKRTLATNSKKKSKM (6b derived peptide)biotin- or FAM-N-KKKSNYTKKKRTLATNSKKK (both versions gave similar results)PEPTIDE 4: biotin- or FAM-N-STTPKSEKFASKKKKRNQASAKAK (6b derived peptide)PEPTIDE 5: biotin- or FAM-N-KKKSKMSTTPKSEKFASKKKKR (6b derived peptide) Open table in a new tab UMR106-01 osteoblastic cells were grown to confluence under serum depleted conditions in multiwell plates under mineralizing (with β-glycerolphosphate [BGP]) or nonmineralizing conditions (without BGP) and binding studies carried out with monolayer cultures fixed at different times after addition of mineralization inducer BGP.

Recently, CD200 is considered as a relatively consistent marker in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We retrospectively assessed CD200 expression in 252 patients with B chronic lymphoproliferative disorders with four-color flow cytometry. CD200 expression estimation included the proportion of positive cells (≥30%) and the mean fluorescence intensity ratio. Additionally, we have incorporated CD200 into Matutes score, also replaced FMC7 and CD79b in an attempt to improve the score discriminative power. Of 252 patients enrolled, 199(79%) patients were classified as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and 53 (21%) as other B-chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. All chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases and 20 of 53 (37.7%) of other B-chronic lymphoproliferative disorders demonstrated high CD200 expression (≥30%). Further, CD200 (≥30%) revealed a higher accuracy in comparison to other markers in Matutes score (range: 51%–92.5%). Also, CD200 addition to the Matutes score has correctly recognized all 199 chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases including 10 atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases. As for non-CLL cases, 20 of 53 attained a higher score, yet keeping the original diagnosis. Moreover, CD200 enhanced the diagnostic accuracy of Matutes score to 100%, and when included in a simplified 4-markers score, showed an accuracy of 99.8% compared to 99.4% of Matutes score. In conclusion, CD200 is an accurate diagnostic marker for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and can refine the modified Matutes score accuracy when added with other markers."

This is the first NRPS R domain structure to be determined together with the upstream PCP domain and is also the first structure of an archaeal NRPS to be reported. The structure reveals that a novel helix–turn–helix motif, found in NRPS R domains but not in other short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family members, plays a major role in the interface between the PCP and R domains. The information derived from the described PCP–R interface will aid in gaining further mechanistic insights into the peptide termination reaction catalyzed by the R domain and may have implications in engineering NRPSs to synthesize novel peptide products. Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multimodular enzymes that function as molecular assembly lines to synthesize a wide range of structurally and functionally diverse peptides (1Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Modular peptide synthetases involved in nonribosomal peptide synthesis.Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Nonribosomal peptides include a large array of natural products, including siderophores, toxins, and antibacterial and insecticidal agents (2Süssmuth R.D. Mainz A. Nonribosomal peptide synthesis—principles and prospects.Angew. Chem. Int. Edition. 2017; 56: 3770-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). A large number of nonribosomal peptides have been used as antimicrobial, antifungal, antitumor, or immunosuppressant drugs (2Süssmuth R.D. Mainz A. Nonribosomal peptide synthesis—principles and prospects.Angew. Chem. Int. Edition. 2017; 56: 3770-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Nonribosomal peptides are produced predominantly by bacteria and fungi and are rare in archaea (2Süssmuth R.D. Mainz A. Nonribosomal peptide synthesis—principles and prospects.Angew. Chem. Int. Edition. 2017; 56: 3770-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 3Wang H. Fewer D.P. Holm L. Rouhiainen L. Sivonen K.

A. 2014; 111: 9259-9264Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar); only three NRPS gene clusters belonging to classes Methanomicrobia and Methanobacteria were detected in the 128 archaeal genomes analyzed by Wang and co-workers (3Wang H. Fewer D.P. Holm L. Rouhiainen L. Sivonen K. Atlas of nonribosomal peptide and polyketide biosynthetic pathways reveals common occurrence of nonmodular enzymes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: 9259-9264Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A minimal NRPS module consists of an adenylation (A) domain, a peptide carrier protein (PCP) domain, and a condensation (C) domain (1Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Modular peptide synthetases involved in nonribosomal peptide synthesis.Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). In addition, the final module possesses a termination domain at its C-terminal end that catalyzes release of the peptide product. Reductase (R) domains are one of the two main types of termination domains employed by NRPSs, the other one being thioesterase (TE) domains. The growing peptide chain is shuttled across the NRPS while covalently tethered to a 4′-phosphopantetheine (Ppant) arm that is post-translationally added to a conserved serine residue in the PCP domain. The termination domain releases the completed peptide product from its covalent tether to the terminal PCP domain (2Süssmuth R.D. Mainz A. Nonribosomal peptide synthesis—principles and prospects.Angew. Chem. Int. Edition. 2017; 56: 3770-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 4Hur G.H. Vickery C.R. Burkart M.D. Explorations of catalytic domains in non-ribosomal peptide synthetase enzymology.Nat. Product Rep. 2012; 29: 1074-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Termination reactions catalyzed by TE domains result in offloading the peptide product by hydrolysis of the thioester bond between the peptide and Ppant. R domains, on the other hand, catalyze NAD(P)H-dependent 2e− or 4e− reductive release of the peptides (5Du L. Lou L. PKS and NRPS release mechanisms.Nat. Product Rep. 2010; 27: 255-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1A). The products released by R domains can be alcohols (6Barajas J.F. Phelan R.M. Schaub A.J. Kliewer J.T.

R domains are members of the NAD(P)H-dependent short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily (25Kavanagh K.L. Jörnvall H. Persson B. Oppermann U.

Classification and nomenclature of the superfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs).Chemi. Biol. Interact. 2013; 202: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Members of this superfamily are widespread in all kingdoms of life, with archaea having the lowest number of characterized SDRs (25Kavanagh K.L. Jörnvall H. Persson B. Oppermann U. Medium- and short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase gene and protein families: The SDR superfamily: Functional and structural diversity within a family of metabolic and regulatory enzymes.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3895-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Although the overall sequence identity of proteins in this superfamily is low (20–30%), all their tertiary structures possess the conserved and cofactor-binding Rossmann fold (26Persson B. Kallberg Y. Classification and nomenclature of the superfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs).Chemi. Biol. Interact. 2013; 202: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). NRPS R domains are further subclassified as “extended” SDRs, in contrast to “classical” SDRs, as they possess an additional C-terminal subdomain of about 100 residues (26Persson B. Kallberg Y. Classification and nomenclature of the superfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs).Chemi. Biol. Interact. 2013; 202: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the last decade, several R domains have been structurally and functionally characterized (6Barajas J.F. Phelan R.M. Schaub A.J. Kliewer J.T. Kelly P.J. Jackson D.R. Luo R. Keasling J.D. Tsai S.-C.

Structural studies on the R domain (Mtb-R) of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis NRPS that produces an unknown peptide (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID: 4DQV and 4U5Q) have provided insights into the intradomain interactions that regulate NADPH binding and the subsequent two-step (4e−) reduction of the product to an alcohol via an aldehyde intermediate (27Chhabra A.

The terminal R domain (MxaA-R) of the NRPS module of the myxalamid biosynthetic pathway (PDB ID: 4U7W) from Stigmatella aurantiaca Sga15 is the only “NADPH-bound” NRPS R domain structure to be reported to date (6Barajas J.F. Phelan R.M. Schaub A.J. Kliewer J.T. Kelly P.J. Jackson D.R. Luo R. Keasling J.D. Tsai S.-C.

Biol. 2015; 22: 1018-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The structure of the R domain (AusA-R) of a dimodular NRPS (PDB ID: 4F6C) from the aureusimine biosynthetic cluster in Staphylococcus aureus strain Mu50 is the only aldehyde-producing NRPS R domain structure to be reported to date (8Wyatt M.A. Mok M.C.Y. Junop M. Magarvey N.A. Heterologous expression and structural characterisation of a pyrazinone natural product assembly line.ChemBioChem. 2012; 13: 2408-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the same article, Wyatt and co-workers (8Wyatt M.A. Mok M.C.Y. Junop M. Magarvey N.A. Heterologous expression and structural characterisation of a pyrazinone natural product assembly line.ChemBioChem. 2012; 13: 2408-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) also reported the structure of a protein construct (AusA-PCP–R) containing both the upstream PCP and the R domain (PDB ID: 4F6L). However, electron density was visible only for the R domain, likely because of the positional disorder of the PCP domain. One crucial yet underexplored mechanism during peptide termination by NRPS R domains is the interaction of the R domain with the upstream PCP domain. Some insights have been provided into the interdomain interactions between the PCP and R domains in the recently reported didomain structures (CAR–PCP–R) of carboxylic acid reductases (CARs) from Nocardia iowensis and Segniliparus rugosus (PDB ID: 5MSV, 5MSP, and 5MSR) (20Gahloth D. Dunstan M.S. Quaglia D. Klumbys E. Lockhart-Cairns M.P. Hill A.M. Derrington S.R. Scrutton N.S. Turner N.J. Leys D. Structures of carboxylic acid reductase reveal domain dynamics underlying catalysis.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). CARs are made up of an A domain, a PCP domain, and an R domain, which is analogous to the architecture of an NRPS termination module. These enzymes accept carboxylic acids as their substrates and catalyze their NADPH-assisted reduction to aldehydes, which is a similar activity to the R domain–containing NRPS enzymes. In this study, we report the crystal structures of the Ppant-modified and unmodified PCP–R didomain (351-PCP–R) of the terminal module of the NRPS Mru_0351 from Methanobrevibacter ruminantium M1, one of the prevalent species of methanogenic archaea found in ruminants (28Janssen P.H. Kirs M. Structure of the archaeal community of the rumen.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 3619-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Mru_0351 is one of the two NRPSs discovered in M. ruminantium (29Leahy S.C. Kelly W.J. Altermann E. Ronimus R.S. Yeoman C.J. Pacheco D.M. Li D. Kong Z. McTavish S. Sang C. Lambie S.C. Janssen P.H. Dey D. Attwood G.T. The genome sequence of the rumen methanogen Methanobrevibacter ruminantium reveals new possibilities for controlling ruminant methane emissions.PLoS One. 2010; 5e8926Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the products of which are still unknown. Therefore, identification and functional characterization of the peptide product of Mru_0351 will further our understanding of methanogen biology and will have implications in developing novel methane mitigation strategies. As a step toward understanding the peptide production mechanism, we have determined the structure of the Mru_0351 PCP–R didomain that is involved in release of the mature peptide product. This is the first structure of an NRPS R domain to be determined in association with its preceding PCP domain and also the first structure of an archaeal NRPS to be reported. In contrast to the CAR–PCP–R structure, the Ppant-modified 351-PCP–R adopts a previously unobserved conformation, thereby providing further insights into the PCP–R interdomain interactions. Furthermore, we have identified a helix–turn–helix (HTH) motif, found in NRPS R domains but not in other SDR family members, that mediates the interface between the PCP and R domains. The unmodified and Ppant-modified structures of 351-PCP–R were determined to resolutions of 2.65 and 1.95 Å, respectively. The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the PDB with codes 6VTZ (unmodified) and 6VTJ (Ppant modified). Structural alignment of the unmodified and Ppant-modified structures using secondary structure matching (30Krissinel E.B. Henrick K. Secondary-structure matching (SSM), a new tool for fast protein structure alignment in three dimensions.Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref Scopus (3073) Google Scholar) resulted in an overall RMSD value of 0.45 Å, showing that the modification did not induce any significant change in the overall protein structure. The 351-PCP–R domain can be structurally divided into a cofactor-binding N-terminal subdomain and a substrate-binding C-terminal subdomain (Fig. 1), as is the case for other previously determined NRPS R domain structures. No electron density was visible for the PCP domain (residues V3701–S3778) in the unmodified structure, likely because of positional disorder, similar to the disordered PCP domain that has been reported in the crystal structure of the AusA-PCP–R (8Wyatt M.A. Mok M.C.Y. Junop M. Magarvey N.A. Heterologous expression and structural characterisation of a pyrazinone natural product assembly line.ChemBioChem. 2012; 13: 2408-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, electron density was visible for the PCP domain in our Ppant-modified structure, showing that the PCP domain makes contact both with the C-terminal R subdomain and with a key loop in the NADPH-binding pocket of the N-terminal subdomain, previously defined as the “gating” loop by Kinatukara and co-workers (31Kinatukara P. Patel K.D. Haque A.S. Singh R. Gokhale R.S. Sankaranarayananan R. Structural insights into the regulation of NADPH binding to reductase domains of nonribosomal peptide synthetases: A concerted loop movement model.J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 194: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The PCP domain itself is a four-helix bundle, like all previously determined PCP domain structures (Fig. 1B). Eight residues in the Ppant-modified structure belonging to the PCP domain–R domain linker were not modeled because of weak electron density. Ppant can be seen covalently attached to the conserved serine residue in the active site of the PCP domain (Fig. 1), but our model is pruned to atom N41 because of weak electron density beyond this atom (Fig. S2). The N-terminal R subdomain harbors the conserved and cofactor-binding Rossmann fold consisting of a β-sheet made of seven parallel β-strands (in the order 3-2-1-4-5-6-7) flanked by α-helices on either side (Fig. 2A). This fold is present in all members of the SDR superfamily. The Rossmann fold contains a glycine-rich conserved motif: T–G–A–T–G–F–L–G (residues T3828 to G3835 in 351-PCP–R), which is important in maintaining the structure of the central β-sheet and in cofactor binding (25Kavanagh K.L. Jörnvall H. Persson B. Oppermann U.

Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3895-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Another characteristic feature of the SDR superfamily is the presence of the triad of catalytic residues Y–T/S–K, which are present at positions Y3988, S3991, and K3992 in 351-PCP–R (Fig. 2A). The N-terminal residues of the subdomain (L3789–N3824 in 351-PCP–R), which are immediately downstream of the disordered PCP–R linker, wrap around the core of the R domain, tracing a path similar to that seen in AusA-R and AusA-PCP–R (8Wyatt M.A. Mok M.C.Y.

Heterologous expression and structural characterisation of a pyrazinone natural product assembly line.ChemBioChem. 2012; 13: 2408-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) but different to that seen in other R domain structures (6Barajas J.F.

The C-terminal R subdomain comprises six α-helices and two β-strands and harbors the putative substrate-binding pocket (6Barajas J.F. Phelan R.M. Schaub A.J. Kliewer J.T. Kelly P.J. Jackson D.R.

A. 2012; 109: 5681-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the details of the substrate-binding site of NRPS R domains remain unknown, as there are no reported structures determined in complex with their substrates. The C-terminal subdomain shows more variability in tertiary structure than the N-terminal subdomain, as seen from the higher RMSD values in comparisons with other R domain structures (Table S1). The C-terminal subdomain is also typically less conserved in sequence than the N-terminal subdomain, when compared with other R domains (Table S1). Both the unmodified and Ppant-modified 351-PCP–R proteins were crystallized in the absence of the NADPH cofactor. Despite significant efforts, crystals of 351-PCP–R could not be obtained by cocrystallization with NADPH. Examination of the NADPH-binding pocket revealed the presence of small patches of positive difference density in the Ppant-modified 351-PCP–R structure but not in the unmodified structure (Fig. 3A). This could be due to partial occupancy from NADPH or could be unidentified small molecules that have occupied the pocket during crystallization or protein purification, although the density did not match any molecules known to be present during crystallization or purification. Previous investigations of the gating loop in Mtb-R structures have proposed that the gating loop is flexible and able to occupy the NADPH-binding pocket resulting in an “inactive” R domain conformation (27Chhabra A.

https://openalex.org/W3130158813,"This work is motivated by the recent worldwide pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). When an epidemiological disease is prevalent, estimating the case fatality rate, the proportion of deaths out of the total cases, accurately and quickly is important as the case fatality rate is one of the crucial indicators of the risk of a disease. In this work, we propose an alternative estimator of the case fatality rate that provides more accurate estimate during an outbreak by reducing the downward bias (underestimation) of the naive CFR, the proportion of deaths out of confirmed cases at each time point, which is the most commonly used estimator due to the simplicity. The proposed estimator is designed to achieve the availability of real-time update by using the commonly reported quantities, the numbers of confirmed, cured, deceased cases, in the computation. To enhance the accuracy, the proposed estimator adapts a stratification, which allows the estimator to use information from heterogeneous strata separately. By the COVID-19 cases of China, South Korea and the United States, we numerically show the proposed stratification-based estimator plays a role of providing an early warning about the severity of a epidemiological disease that estimates the final case fatality rate accurately and shows faster convergence to the final case fatality rate."
https://openalex.org/W3130632492,"Purpose To analyse corneal power based on a large optical coherence tomography dataset using raytracing, and to evaluate corneal power with respect to the corneal front apex plane for different definitions of best focus. Methods A large OCT dataset (10,218 eyes of 8,430 patients) from the Casia 2 (Tomey, Japan) was post-processed in MATLAB (MathWorks, USA). Using radius of curvature, corneal front and back surface asphericity, central corneal thickness, and pupil size (aperture) a bundle of rays was traced through the cornea. Various best focus definitions were tested: a) minimum wavefront error, b) root mean squared ray scatter, c) mean absolute ray scatter, and d) total spot diameter. All 4 target optimisation criteria were tested with each best focus plane. With the best-fit keratometer index the difference of corneal power and keratometric power was evaluated using a multivariate linear model. Results The mean corneal powers for a/b/c/d were 43.02±1.61/42.92±1.58/42.91±1.58/42.94±1.59 dpt respectively. The root mean squared deviations of corneal power from keratometric power (n K = 1.3317/1.3309/1.3308/1.3311 for a/b/c/d) were 0.308/0.185/0.171/0.209 dpt. With the multivariate linear model the respective RMS error was reduced to 0.110/0.052/0.043/0.065 dpt (R² = 0.872/0.921/0.935/0.904). Conclusions Raytracing improves on linear Gaussian optics by considering the asphericity of both refracting surfaces and using Snell’s law of refraction in preference to paraxial simplifications. However, there is no unique definition of best focus, and therefore the calculated corneal power varies depending on the definition of best focus. The multivariate linear model enabled more precise estimation of corneal power compared to the simple keratometer equation."
https://openalex.org/W3131648158,"More than 1.3 million people lose their lives every year in traffic accidents. Improving road safety requires designing better vehicles and investigating drivers’ abilities more closely. Driving simulators are constantly being used for this purpose, but the question which often arises as to their validity tends to be a barrier to developments in this field. Here we studied the validity of a simulator, defined as how closely users’ behavior under simulated conditions resembles their behavior on the road, based on the concept of drivers’ feeling of presence. For this purpose, the driving behavior, physiological state and declarative data of 41 drivers were tested in the Sherpa2 simulator and in a real vehicle on a track while driving at a constant speed. During each trial, drivers had to cope with an unexpected hazardous event (a one-meter diameter gym ball crossing the road right in front of the vehicle), which occurred twice. During the speed-maintenance task, the simulator showed absolute validity, in terms of the driving and physiological parameters recorded. During the first hazardous event, the physiological parameters showed that the level of arousal (Low Heart Rate/High Heart Rate ratio x10) increased up to the end of the drive. On the other hand, the drivers’ behavioral (braking) responses were 20% more frequent in the simulator than in the real vehicle, and the physiological state parameters showed that stress reactions occurred only in the real vehicle (+5 beats per minute, +2 breaths per minute and the phasic skin conductance increased by 2). In the subjects’ declarative data, several feeling of presence sub-scales were lower under simulated conditions. These results suggest that the validity of motion based simulators for testing drivers coping with hazards needs to be questioned."
https://openalex.org/W3132251122,"Defects in protein O-mannosylation lead to severe congenital muscular dystrophies collectively known as α-dystroglycanopathy. A hallmark of these diseases is the loss of the O-mannose-bound matriglycan on α-dystroglycan, which reduces cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Mutations in protein O-mannose β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (POMGNT1), which is crucial for the elongation of O-mannosyl glycans, have mainly been associated with muscle–eye–brain (MEB) disease. In addition to defects in cell–extracellular matrix adhesion, aberrant cell–cell adhesion has occasionally been observed in response to defects in POMGNT1. However, specific molecular consequences of POMGNT1 deficiency on cell–cell adhesion are largely unknown. We used POMGNT1 knockout HEK293T cells and fibroblasts from an MEB patient to gain deeper insight into the molecular changes in POMGNT1 deficiency. Biochemical and molecular biological techniques combined with proteomics, glycoproteomics, and glycomics revealed that a lack of POMGNT1 activity strengthens cell–cell adhesion. We demonstrate that the altered intrinsic adhesion properties are due to an increased abundance of N-cadherin (N-Cdh). In addition, site-specific changes in the N-glycan structures in the extracellular domain of N-Cdh were detected, which positively impact on homotypic interactions. Moreover, in POMGNT1-deficient cells, ERK1/2 and p38 signaling pathways are activated and transcriptional changes that are comparable with the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) are triggered, defining a possible molecular mechanism underlying the observed phenotype. Our study indicates that changes in cadherin-mediated cell–cell adhesion and other EMT-related processes may contribute to the complex clinical symptoms of MEB or α-dystroglycanopathy in general and suggests that the impact of changes in O-mannosylation on N-glycosylation has been underestimated.

The modification of proteins by glycosylation is a ubiquitous feature of all living organisms (1Corfield A.P. Berry M. Glycan variation and evolution in the eukaryotes.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2015; 40: 351-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Protein-linked glycans are involved in a multitude of cellular processes ranging from monitoring the folding state of glycoproteins to cell adhesion and migration (2Moremen K.W. Tiemeyer M. Nairn A.V. Vertebrate protein glycosylation: Diversity, synthesis and function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 448-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Among the different types of glycosylation, N-glycosylation and O-mannosylation are evolutionary conserved from bacteria to mammals. In humans, changes in those essential protein modifications inter alia can modulate immune responses, promote cancer cell metastasis, and underlie the pathophysiology of severe congenital disorders (3Pereira M.S. Alves I. Vicente M. Campar A. Silva M.C. Padrão N.A. Pinto V. Fernandes Â. Dias A.M. Pinho S.S. Glycans as key checkpoints of T cell activity and function.Front.

Pediatr. 2011; 23: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Both modifications initiate at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the target polypeptides and the donor saccharides are synthesized and eventually covalently linked (2Moremen K.W. Tiemeyer M. Nairn A.V. Vertebrate protein glycosylation: Diversity, synthesis and function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 448-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Only properly glycosylated and folded proteins can leave the ER and travel through the Golgi apparatus to reach their final cellular destinations. On their way, N-linked and O-mannosyl glycans can be further modified, which leads to diverse species- or even cell-type-specific glycans (2Moremen K.W. Tiemeyer M. Nairn A.V. Vertebrate protein glycosylation: Diversity, synthesis and function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 448-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). In the case of N-glycosylation, the dolichol-pyrophosphate-linked oligosaccharide Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 is assembled at the ER membrane and the glycan moiety is transferred en bloc to Asn residues of the consensus sequon Asn-X-Ser/Thr/Cys (X: proline is excluded). This way, the vast majority of proteins that enter the secretory pathway are N-glycosylated including many cell surface receptors and cell adhesion molecules (6Zielinska D.F. Gnad F. Wisniewski J. Mann M. Precision mapping of an in vivo N-glycoproteome reveals rigid topological and sequence constraints.Cell. 2010; 141: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Protein-linked carbohydrate moieties are then further processed and finally extended in the Golgi through the concerted action of diverse specific glycosyltransferases resulting in three distinct types of N-glycans: high-mannose, complex-, and hybrid-type, which contain the common core Man3GlcNAc2-Asn (2Moremen K.W. Tiemeyer M. Nairn A.V. Vertebrate protein glycosylation: Diversity, synthesis and function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 448-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The diverse glycan structures and glycosylation patterns on cell surface molecules are highly dynamic and can be differentially regulated both during development and in certain pathological conditions, often associated with the acquisition of altered cellular properties (4Pinho S.S. Reis C.A. Glycosylation in cancer: Mechanisms and clinical implications.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2015; 15: 540-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). Classically, O-mannosylation is initiated by the conserved PMT family of protein O-mannosyltransferases (POMT1 and POMT2 in mammals), which catalyze the transfer of mannose from dolichol-phosphate-linked mannose to Ser and Thr residues of nascent proteins (7Neubert P. Strahl S. Protein O-mannosylation in the early secretory pathway.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2016; 41: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Three different core structures can be built on the protein-linked mannose (8Endo T. Mammalian O-mannosyl glycans: Biochemistry and glycopathology.Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B Phys. Biol. Sci. 2019; 95: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Linear core m1 and branched core m2 glycans, which share the common inner core GlcNAc-β1,2-Man-Ser/Thr, are initiated in the cis Golgi by the addition of a GlcNAc residue by the protein O-mannose β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (POMGNT1), and are further extended while proteins travel through the Golgi to the cell surface. In contrast, core m3 glycans are already elongated in the ER (GalNAc-β1,3-GlcNAc-β1,4-(phosphate-6)-Man-Ser/Thr) and then further modified in the Golgi by the sequential action of numerous glycosyltransferases including the ribulose-5-phosphate transferase fukutin (FKTN). The resulting complex polysaccharide structure, known as “matriglycan,” is so far only found on α-dystroglycan (α-DG), a central member of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex family in peripheral membranes and enables its interaction with extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as laminin (9Yoshida-Moriguchi T. Campbell K.P. Matriglycan: A novel polysaccharide that links dystroglycan to the basement membrane.Glycobiology. 2015; 25: 702-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Defects in this complex biosynthetic pathway lead to the loss of the matriglycan on α-DG and consequently impair interactions between α-DG and, e.g., laminin, which interferes with the formation of basement membranes (9Yoshida-Moriguchi T. Campbell K.P. Matriglycan: A novel polysaccharide that links dystroglycan to the basement membrane.Glycobiology. 2015; 25: 702-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This defect has been recognized as a major patho-mechanism of severe congenital muscular dystrophies with neuronal migration defects, known as α-dystroglycanopathy (OMIM 236670; 253280; 253800; 606612; 607155; 608840) (10Endo T. Glycobiology of α-dystroglycan and muscular dystrophy.J. Biochem. 2014; 157: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The glycosyltransferase POMGNT1 has a key role in the elongation of O-mannosyl glycans (11Yoshida A. Kobayashi K. Manya H. Taniguchi K. Kano H. Mizuno M. Inazu T. Mitsuhashi H. Takahashi S.

Cell. 2001; 1: 717-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). In its absence, not only core m1 and m2 structures are missing, also formation of the matriglycan fails, since POMGNT1 recruits FKTN to maturing core m3 structures (12Xiong H. Kobayashi K. Tachikawa M. Manya H. Takeda S. Chiyonobu T. Fujikake N. Wang F. Nishimoto A. Morris G.E. Nagai Y. Kanagawa M. Endo T. Toda T.

A. 2016; 113: 9280-9285Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The great majority of mutations in POMGNT1 have been linked to muscle–eye–brain disease (MEB; OMIM 253280), a congenital muscular dystrophy in humans, which is characterized by additional brain malformations and structural anomalies in the eye (11Yoshida A.

Cell. 2001; 1: 717-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). In the murine model, knockout of POMGNT1 is viable with multiple developmental defects, similar to the clinical picture of human MEB patients (14Liu J. Ball S.L. Yang Y. Mei P. Zhang L. Shi H. Kaminski H.J. Lemmon V.P. Hu H. A genetic model for muscle-eye-brain disease in mice lacking protein O-mannose 1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (POMGnT1).Mech.

Neurol. 2007; 501: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The pathology of MEB suggests a functional role for POMGNT1 in control of cell adhesion and migration. For example, in the transgenic POMGNT1-based MEB mouse model, impaired cell–ECM adhesion results in disruption of basement membranes and overmigration of neurons during development of the cerebral cortex (15Hu H. Yang Y. Eade A. Xiong Y. Qi Y. Breaches of the pial basement membrane and disappearance of the glia limitans during development underlie the cortical lamination defect in the mouse model of muscle-eye-brain disease.J. Comp.

Xiong Y. Qi Y.

Neurol. 2007; 501: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition to its important role during mammalian development, POMGNT1 has recently been linked to the progression of glioblastoma, fatal primary brain tumors with survival time of 12–15 months, as well as the resistance of glioblastoma cells to the chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide (16Lan J. Guo P. Lin Y. Mao Q. Guo L. Ge J. Li X. Jiang J. Lin X. Qiu Y.

Rep. 2017; 38: 2911-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Strikingly, in glioblastoma models, increased cell–cell adhesion has been observed when POMGNT1 is missing (16Lan J. Guo P. Lin Y. Mao Q. Guo L. Ge J. Li X. Jiang J. Lin X. Qiu Y. Role of glycosyltransferase PomGnT1 in glioblastoma progression.Neuro Oncol. 2015; 17: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, molecular reasons for the different consequences of POMGNT1 deficiency are just emerging. Very recently, glyco-engineered human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells turned out to be especially useful for the characterization of known, as well as the identification of new glycosylation pathways (18Larsen I.S.B. Narimatsu Y. Joshi H.J. Siukstaite L. Harrison O.J. Brasch J. Goodman K.M. Hansen L. Shapiro L. Honig B. Vakhrushev S.Y. Clausen H. Halim A.

Cell Proteomics. 2019; 18: 1396-1409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the present work, we took advantage of a gene-targeted POMGNT1 knockout in HEK293T cells to study the consequences of POMGNT1 deficiency. The combination of glyco(proteo)mics with classic biochemistry, molecular and cell biology resulted in the discovery that cell–cell adhesion mediated by neuronal cadherin (N-Cdh) is affected and defined a possible molecular mechanism underlying the observed phenotype. Similar effects in MEB patient-derived fibroblasts confirmed the validity of the HEK293T model to study molecular effects of O-mannosylation deficiencies. To gain insight into functional implications of POMGNT1 deficiency, we generated a gene-targeted knockout in HEK293T cells (ΔPOMGnT1) as detailed in Experimental procedures and Figure S1. The loss of POMGNT1 activity was confirmed by the O-mannosylation status of the endogenous substrate α-DG using the matriglycan-directed antibody IIH6. Whereas the O-linked matriglycan is absent in POMGNT1-depleted cells, reintroduction of human POMGNT1 rescued O-mannosylation of α-DG verifying the specificity of the system (Fig. 1A). General characterization of the morphology of POMGNT1 knockout cells by confocal microscopy revealed that POMGNT1-deficient cells appear more rounded and stronger aggregated compared with wild-type (WT) cells, which show extensive spreading and even distribution. This phenotype is also reverted upon reintroduction of POMGNT1 (Fig. 1B). To further characterize molecular events responsible for the morphological differences, we analyzed cell–matrix and cell–cell adhesion. As expected, POMGNT1-deficient cells adhere to laminin, a major ECM component and interactor of the α-DG matriglycan, to a significantly lower extent when compared with WT cells (Fig. 2A). Intriguingly, when confluent monolayers of WT cells were incubated with WT and knockout cells, respectively, cell–cell adhesion of ΔPOMGnT1 cells turned out to be significantly increased. The same result is observed using a monolayer of ΔPOMGnT1 cells (Fig. 2B). Since cell–matrix and cell–cell interactions are major opposing forces balancing cellular migration, we further took advantage of xCELLigence real-time cell analysis that allows live monitoring of cell proliferation and cell migration. ΔPOMGnT1 cells proliferate slower than WT cells with slopes of 0.07 and 0.09, respectively (Fig. S2, A and B). In agreement with increased cell–cell adhesion, the migration rate of ΔPOMGnT1 cells is reduced by a factor of 3 (Figs. 2C and S2D). Taken together, the POMGNT1 knockout HEK293T cell model revealed that cell–cell adhesion increases, whereas cell–matrix interactions and cell migration are negatively affected when O-mannosyl glycans are not further elongated. In order to identify determinants that underlie the observed phenotype in ΔPOMGnT1 cells, we performed label-free quantitative proteomics of whole-cell lysates from WT and ΔPOMGnT1 HEK293T cells. Five independent replicates were analyzed, and homoscedasticity and normal distribution were confirmed (Fig. S3, A and B, Tables S1–S3). Altogether, 86 out of 437 proteins with differential abundance in POMGNT1-deficient cells could be identified (Fig. 3A and S3D, Table S4). Interestingly, gene ontology term functional annotation of proteins with a significant regulation revealed enrichment for proteins under the molecular function term of ""cadherin binding involved in cell-cell adhesion"" (Figs. 3A and S3D, Table S4), pointing to an impact of POMGNT1 deficiency on cadherin-mediated cell–cell adhesion. In addition, the protein N-Cdh was found to be more abundant by a factor of ∼2.7 in ΔPOMGnT1 cells (Fig. 3A). This result was also confirmed by western blot (Fig. 3, B and C) and correlated well with increased mRNA levels of N-Cdh (Fig. 3D). The observed difference in the increase of N-Cdh abundance in proteomics (∼2.7-fold) and western blot analysis (∼1.4-fold) is most likely due to the different detection principles that could be influenced by changes in N-Cdh glycosylation (see below). To investigate the general validity of our findings, we took advantage of skin fibroblasts derived from an MEB patient who presented characteristic symptoms such as mental retardation and blindness due to variant c.535_751del (p.Asp179Argfs∗11) in the POMGNT1 gene (NM_017739.4). In accordance with our HEK293T model, protein and mRNA abundance of N-Cdh in MEB patient-derived fibroblasts showed increased values compared with fibroblasts from two healthy donors (Fig. 3, E–G). Cadherins are major players in the formation of cellular junctions (20Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Cadherins as modulators of cellular phenotype.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 207-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). These membrane-anchored cell surface glycoproteins mediate cell–cell adhesion through homotypic interactions of their conserved extracellular domains. Thus, to determine whether elevated cell–cell adhesion observed in POMGNT1-deficient cells is directly linked to the increased abundance of N-Cdh, we performed cell–cell adhesion assays in presence of either N-Cdh blocking or IgG-directed antibodies. As shown in Figure 4, ΔPOMGnT1 cells show increased adhesion to WT and other ΔPOMGnT1 cells in the IgG-treated controls. This increase, however, is diminished upon incubation with an N-Cdh targeting antibody, demonstrating N-Cdh as a key molecular driver for increased cell–cell adhesion in the established ΔPOMGnT1 HEK293T cell model. N-Cdh is highly N-glycosylated and N-linked glycans affect its adhesive properties by modulating its homomeric interactions in cis and in trans (21Guo H.B. Johnson H. Randolph M. Pierce M. Regulation of homotypic cell-cell adhesion by branched N-glycosylation of N-cadherin extracellular EC2 and EC3 domains.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 34986-34997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Langer M.D. Guo H. Shashikanth N. Pierce J.M. Leckband D.E. N-glycosylation alters cadherin-mediated intercellular binding kinetics.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 2478-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether an altered N-glycosylation, as an indirect effect of POMGNT1 deficiency, could contribute to increased N-Cdh-mediated cell–cell adhesion. We performed comprehensive N-glycomics and N-glycoproteomics on N-Cdh. For that purpose, the extracellular domain (EC) of N-Cdh was recombinantly expressed and purified from WT and ΔPOMGnT1 cells (detailed in Experimental procedures; Fig. S4). N-glycomics analysis by multiplexed capillary gel electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection (xCGE-LIF) revealed that total abundance of fully galactosylated and sialylated (α2,6- and α2,3-NeuNAc) N-glycan structures is remarkably decreased on N-Cdh derived from ΔPOMGnT1 cells when compared with WT (Fig. 5A, normalized intensity of peaks 2, 4, 9, and 10; Fig. S5 and Table S5). In accordance, the abundance of nongalactosylated N-glycan structures is increased (Fig. 5A, normalized intensity of peaks 6 and 7). Moreover, fully galactosylated multiantennary N-glycans (Fig. 5A, normalized intensity of peak A3+F) are reduced on ΔPOMGnT1-derived N-Cdh, and a nongalactosylated complex-type N-glycan with a bisecting GlcNAc (GlcNAc(5)Man(3)+Fuc(1)) represents the dominating N-glycan structure. In order to gain even deeper insights, an exploratory site-specific approach was taken to comprehensively map glycosylation sites and the corresponding N-glycoforms of N-Cdh. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)-enriched tryptic and proteinase K-generated N-Cdh N-glycopeptides were analyzed by nano-reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled online to an electrospray ionization orbitrap tandem mass spectrometer (nano-RP-LC-ESI-OT MS/MS) (for details see Experimental procedures). All eight potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn190, 273, 325, 402, 572, 622, 651, 692) of N-Cdh were identified (Fig. 5B, indicated as red ribbons, and Table S6). With the exception of Asn651, which predominantly carries a high-mannose-type N-glycan, all sites feature complex-type N-glycans. Characterization of the N-glycan microheterogeneity based on intact N-glycopeptides revealed differences in relative abundance of the major N-glycoform at each site on N-Cdh derived from ΔPOMGnT1 compared with WT cells (Fig. 5C). All N-glycosylation sites (except for Asn651 and Asn692, which are both located at the stem region of the molecule) feature nongalactosylated complex-type N-glycans with a bisecting GlcNAc (GlcNAc(5)Man(3)±Fuc(1)) as the dominating composition on N-Cdh from ΔPOMGnT1 cells. Comparative and site-specific N-glycoproteomics of quantitative changes in the N-glycan microheterogeneity revealed a significant decrease in galactosylation (−27% on average) and sialylation (−16% on average) throughout the vast majority of N-glycosylation sites (only exception are Asn190 and Asn651) (Fig. 5C). This decrease in galactosylation and sialylation is associated with a significant increase of nongalactosylated N-glycan compositions that feature a bisecting GlcNAc (Fig. 5, B and C). The site-specific relative changes of N-glycan traits on N-Cdh are shown in detail in Supporting information SI1–SI3 (Figs S6–S13 and Tables S7–S17). Overall, N-glycosylation of N-Cdh in ΔPOMGnT1 cells exhibits a reduction in the degree of galactosylation and sialylation with nongalactosylated complex-type N-glycans with a bisecting GlcNAc dominating. To identify glycosyltransferases that could be responsible for the observed changes in the N-glycan profile of N-Cdh, we next measured the transcript levels of genes encoding for major glycosyltransferases of N-glycan processing using the nCounter technology (23Geiss G.K. Bumgarner R.E. Birditt B. Dahl T. Dowidar N. Dunaway D.L. Fell H.P. Ferree S. George R.D. Grogan T. James J.J. Maysuria M. Mitton J.D. Oliveri P. Osborn J.L. et al.Direct multiplexed measurement of gene expression with color-coded probe pairs.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Mild reduction in the mRNA levels of the Golgi GlcNAc-transferases MGAT1 (by ∼21%), MGAT2 (by ∼13%), and MGAT5 (by ∼21%) was observed in ΔPOMGnT1 cells. Furthermore, a decrease in transcript levels of β1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 B4GALT1 (by ∼22%) as well as sialyltransferases ST6GAL1 (by ∼64%) and ST3GAL3 (by ∼69%) was detected (Table S18). Basal transcription levels of sialyltransferases are very low and close to the detection limit of the applied nCounter technology (Table S18). Therefore, we aimed to validate our results by qRT-PCR analysis including other α2,3-sialyltransferases that could contribute to the modification of N-Cdh (24Qi F. Isaji T. Duan C. Yang J. Wang Y. Fukuda T. Gu J. ST3GAL3, ST3GAL4, and ST3GAL6 differ in their regulation of biological functions via the specificities for the α2,3-sialylation of target proteins.FASEB J. 2020; 34: 881-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 5D, a significant reduction in B4GALT1 (by ∼31%) and ST6GAL1 (by ∼33%) mRNA was confirmed in ΔPOMGnT1 cells, explaining the limited occurrence of respective N-glycans on N-Cdh in ΔPOMGnT1 cells. The changes in the mRNA levels of α2,3-sialyltransferases were found to be less consistent, possibly due to the limiting amount of transcripts. For ST3GAL3 transcript levels, no significantly change could be detected, whereas ST3GAL4 transcripts were reduced (by ∼31%). The mRNA amount of ST3GAL6 was increased (by ∼50%). In view of the partial substrate specificities of α2,3-sialyltransferases, the latter might indicate even more complex compensatory reactions (24Qi F. Isaji T. Duan C. Yang J. Wang Y. Fukuda T. Gu J. ST3GAL3, ST3GAL4, and ST3GAL6 differ in their regulation of biological functions via the specificities for the α2,3-sialylation of target proteins.FASEB J. 2020; 34: 881-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In summary, our data demonstrate that in POMGNT1-deficient cells, the N-glycan profile of N-Cdh is changed and that the observed alterations correlate to a great extent with transcriptional changes of respective N-glycan modifying enzymes. In addition to N-glycans, N-Cdh carries nonelongated O-linked mannose residues (25Winterhalter P.R. Lommel M. Ruppert T. Strahl S.

The O-mannose glycoproteome of N-Cdh revealed 15 O-mannose glycosylation sites—four of which have not been reported before (Table S6 and Supporting information SI4: Figs S14 and S15).

We evaluated patterns of respiratory health services utilization in early childhood among children born preterm (PTB), small and large for gestational age at term (SGA and LGA, respectively), and appropriate-for-gestational age at term. Materials and methods We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using administrative health data of all singleton live births in Alberta, Canada between 2005–2010. Data on hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits from birth to 5 years were collected for asthma, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, croup, influenza, pneumonia, and other acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections (other URTI and other LRTI, respectively). Adjusted rate ratios were estimated for respiratory ED visits and hospitalizations for adverse birth outcomes using the appropriate-for-gestational age at term group as reference. Age-specific trajectories of total respiratory health services utilization rates for each group were estimated in Poisson models. Results A total of 293,764 episodes of respiratory care from 206,994 children were analyzed. Very PTB children had the highest rates of health services use for all respiratory conditions, particularly for asthma, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis hospitalizations. Moderate/late PTB children also had elevated ED visits and hospitalizations for all respiratory conditions. Children born SGA showed high rates of ED visits for other LRTI, and of hospitalizations for bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and other URTI. Children born LGA had high rates of croup and other URTI ED visits, and of bronchiolitis and bronchiolitis hospitalizations. Age-specific trajectories showed a decreasing trend in the rates of total respiratory health service utilization from birth to five years of age for all groups studied. Children born PTB and LGA at term significantly required more respiratory health services over time compared to the reference group. Conclusion Patterns of paediatric respiratory health services utilization vary according to gestational age and fetal growth."
https://openalex.org/W3133247164,"Early electroencephalographic studies that focused on finding brain correlates of psychic events led to the discovery of the P300. Since then, the P300 has become the focus of many basic and clinical neuroscience studies. However, despite its wide applications, the underlying function of the P300 is not yet clearly understood. One line of research among the many studies that have attempted to elucidate the underlying subroutine of the P300 in the brain has suggested that the physiological function of the P300 is related to inhibition. While some intracranial, behavioral, and event-related potential studies have provided support for this theory, little is known about the inhibitory mechanism. In this study, using alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) and effective connectivity, based on the causal (one-way directed) relationship between alpha ERD and P300 sources, we demonstrated that P300’s associated inhibition is implemented at a higher information processing stage in a localized brain region. We discuss how inhibition as the primary function of the P300 is not inconsistent with ’resource allocation’ and ’working memory updating’ theories about its cognitive function. In light of our findings regarding the scope and information processing stage of inhibition of the P300, we reconcile the inhibitory account of the P300 with working memory updating theory. Finally, based on the compensatory behavior of alpha ERD at the time of suppression of the P300, we propose two distinct yet complementary working memory mechanisms (inhibition and desynchronizing excitation) that render target perception possible."
https://openalex.org/W3132940016,"Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is a regenerative procedure used to treat focal articular cartilage defects in knee joints. However, age has been considered as a limiting factor and ACI is not recommended for patients older than 40-50 years of age. One reason for this may be due to the reduced capacity of aged chondrocytes in generating new cartilage. Currently, the underlying mechanism contributing to aging-associated functional decline in chondrocytes is not clear and no proven approach exists to reverse chondrocyte aging. Given that chondrocytes in healthy hyaline cartilage typically display a spherical shape, believed to be essential for chondrocyte phenotype stability, we hypothesize that maintaining aged chondrocytes in a suspension culture that forces the cells to adopt a round morphology may help to rejuvenate them to a younger state, thus, leading to enhanced cartilage regeneration. Chondrocytes isolated from aged donors displayed reduced proliferation potential and impaired capacity in generating hyaline cartilage, compared to cells isolated from young donors, indicated by increased hypertrophy and cellular senescence. To test our hypothesis, the old chondrocytes were seeded as a suspension onto an agarose-based substratum, where they maintained a round morphology. After the 3-day suspension culture, aged chondrocytes displayed enhanced replicative capacity, compared to those grown adherent to tissue culture plastic. Moreover, chondrocytes subjected to suspension culture formed new cartilage in vitro with higher quality and quantity, with enhanced cartilage matrix deposition, concomitant with lower levels of hypertrophy and cellular senescence markers. Mechanistic analysis suggested the involvement of the RhoA and ERK1/2 signaling pathways in the rejuvenation process. In summary, our study presents a robust and straightforward method to enhance the function of aged human chondrocytes, which can be conveniently used to generate a large number of high-quality chondrocytes for ACI application in the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W3132345874,"Introduction Multi-drug-resistant organisms (MDRO) are usually managed by separating the infected patients to protect others from colonization and infection. Isolation precautions are associated with negative experiences by patients and their relatives, while hospital staff experience a heavier workload and their own emotional reactions. Methods In 2018, 35 participants (nurses, physicians, pharmacists) in an antimicrobial-stewardship program participated in facilitated discussion groups working on the emotional impact of MDRO. Deductive codings were done by four coders focusing on the five basic emotions described by Paul Ekmans. Results All five emotions revealed four to 11 codes forming several subthemes: Anger is expressed because of incompetence, workflow-impairment and lack of knowledge. Anxiety is provoked by inadequate knowledge, guilt, isolation, bad prognoses, and media-related effects. Enjoyment is seldom. Sadness is experienced in terms of helplessness and second-victim effects. Disgust is attributed to shame and bad associations, but on the other hand MDROs seem to be part of everyday life. Deductive coding yielded additional codes for bioethics and the Calgary Family Assessment Method. Conclusion MDRO are perceived to have severe impact on emotions and may affect bioethical and family psychological issues. Thus, further work should concentrate on these findings to generate a holistic view of MDRO on human life and social systems."

The objectives of this study were to assess changes in BMPs during fracture and their correlations to Fracture’s healing. Methods Case-Control hospital–based study conducted from January 2018 to January 2019. Demographic data, anthropometric measurements, and blood samples were collected from patients and controls (18–65 years old). Plasma concentrations of selected BMPs and vitamin D were measured using quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). SPSS version 25 was used to calculate frequencies, Pearson correlation tests, chi-square and unpaired t-test. Results Sixty-five patients with fractures and Sixty-five controls were studied. Means of plasma concentrations were (TGFβ1 = 21.07 ng/ml ±8.49 and 19.8 ng/ml ±7.2) (BMP-2 = 76.3 pg/ml ± 156.6 and 55.5 ng/ml ± 127.9) (BMP-7 = 13.02 pg/ml ±43.5 and 64.6pg/ml ±250) (BMP-10 = 8.14 pg/ml ±12.7 and 5.48 pg/ml ±11.3) (Vitamin D mean was 24.94 ng/ml ±13.2 and 26.2 ng/ml ±11.6) in patients and controls, respectively. Forty-five subjects were enrolled into follow up study: 30 males, 15 females. Healing time mean was 4.13± 2.6 months. No significant correlation between BMP-2/BMP-7 with healing time. Conclusions BMP-7 was significantly lowers in the plasma of patients that controls (P = 0.042). Low Vitamin D was observed among Sudanese participants."
https://openalex.org/W3129582999,"The receptor for Colony Stimulating Factor 1 (CSF1), c-fms, is highly expressed on mature osteoclasts suggesting a role for this cytokine in regulating the function of these cells. Consistent with this idea, in vitro studies have documented a variety of effects of CSF1 in mature osteoclasts. To better define the role of CSF1 in these cells, we conditionally deleted c-fms in osteoclasts (c-fms-OC-/-) by crossing c-fmsflox/flox mice with mice expressing Cre under the control of the cathepsin K promoter. The c-fms-OC-/- mice were of normal weight and had normal tooth eruption. However, when quantified by DXA, bone mass was significantly higher in the spine and femur of female knock out mice and in the femurs of male knock out mice. MicroCT analyses of femurs showed that female c-fms-OC-/- mice had significantly increased trabecular bone mass with a similar trend in males and both sexes demonstrated significantly increased trabecular number and reduced trabecular spacing. Histomorphometric analysis of the femoral trabecular bone compartment demonstrated a trend towards increased numbers of osteoclasts, +26% in Noc/BPm and +22% in OcS/BS in the k/o animals but this change was not significant. However, when the cellular volume of osteoclasts was quantified, the c-fms-OC-/- cells were found to be significantly smaller than controls. Mature osteoclasts show a marked spreading response when exposed to CSF1 in a non-gradient fashion. However, osteoclasts freshly isolated from c-fms-OC-/- mice had a near complete abrogation of this response. C-fms-OC-/- mice treated with (1-34)hPTH 80 ng/kg/d in single daily subcutaneous doses for 29 days showed an attenuated anabolic response in trabecular bone compared to wild-type animals. Taken together, these data indicate an important non-redundant role for c-fms in regulating mature osteoclast function in vivo."

Eukaryotic symbionts such as fungi have been isolated from Anopheles , but whether they are stably associated with mosquitoes and transmitted transstadially across mosquito life stages or to subsequent generations remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that a Leptosphaerulina sp. fungus isolated from the midgut of An . gambiae can be stably associated with An . gambiae host and that it imposes low fitness cost when re-introduced through co-feeding. This fungus is transstadially transmitted across An . gambiae developmental stages and to their progeny.

The microbes colonize all parts of the body and are especially abundant in the gastrointestinal tract, where they constitute the gut microbiome. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster turned out to be an exquisite model organism to functionally test the importance of an intact gut microbiome. Still, however, fundamental questions remain unanswered. For example, it is unknown whether a fine-tuned regionalization of the gut microbiome exists and how such a spatial organization could be established. In order to pave the way for answering this question, we generated an optimized and adapted fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) protocol. We focused on the detection of the two major Drosophila gut microbiome constituting bacteria genera: Acetobacter and Lactobacillus . FISH allows to detect the bacteria in situ and thus to investigate their spatial localization in respect to the host as well as to other microbiome members.

https://openalex.org/W3131707355,"Birt–Hogg–Dubé (BHD) syndrome is a multiorgan disorder caused by inactivation of the folliculin (FLCN) protein. Previously, we identified FLCN as a binding protein of Rab11A, a key regulator of the endocytic recycling pathway. This finding implies that the abnormal localization of specific proteins whose transport requires the FLCN-Rab11A complex may contribute to BHD. Here, we used human kidney-derived HEK293 cells as a model, and we report that FLCN promotes the binding of Rab11A with transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is required for iron uptake through continuous trafficking between the cell surface and the cytoplasm. Loss of FLCN attenuated the Rab11A–TfR1 interaction, resulting in delayed recycling transport of TfR1. This delay caused an iron deficiency condition that induced hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) activity, which was reversed by iron supplementation. In a Drosophila model of BHD syndrome, we further demonstrated that the phenotype of BHD mutant larvae was substantially rescued by an iron-rich diet.

It has thus been speculated that FLCN regulates these two pathways through varied mechanisms, depending on the specific cellular and tissue contexts. FLCN is conserved from yeast to humans, implying that it necessarily regulates certain fundamental cellular processes. Consistent with this hypothesis, emerging evidence has revealed important roles of FLCN during vesicular trafficking, which is a highly conserved process in eukaryotic cells. Indeed, before FLCN was initially identified in humans and subsequently linked to BHD, the Kaiser group had identified a group of yeast genes governing the movement of the amino acid permease Gap1p from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane (14Roberg K.J.

Kaiser C.A. Control of amino-acid permease sorting in the late secretory pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by SEC13, LST4, LST7, and LST8.Genetics. 1997; 147: 1569-1584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the precise mechanisms remained unknown. In 2012, a structural study uncovered a differentially expressed in normal cells and neoplasia (DENN) domain in the FLCN C terminus (22Nookala R.K. Langemeyer L. Pacitto A. Ochoa-Montaño B. Donaldson J.C. Blaszczyk B.K. Chirgadze D.Y. Barr F.A. Bazan J.F. Blundell T.L. Crystal structure of folliculin reveals a hidDENN function in genetically inherited renal cancer.Open Biol. 2012; 2: 120071Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because some DENN-containing proteins are activators of Rab proteins (Rabs), which are key regulators of vesicular trafficking, FLCN has been suspected to regulate protein transport via Rabs (22Nookala R.K. Langemeyer L. Pacitto A. Ochoa-Montaño B. Donaldson J.C. Blaszczyk B.K. Chirgadze D.Y. Barr F.A. Bazan J.F. Blundell T.L. Crystal structure of folliculin reveals a hidDENN function in genetically inherited renal cancer.Open Biol. 2012; 2: 120071Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Shortly after this discovery, two studies demonstrated that FLCN regulates the intracellular transport of EGFR. In one study (23Zheng J. Duan B. Sun S. Cui J. Du J. Zhang Y. Folliculin interacts with Rab35 to regulate EGF-induced EGFR degradation.Front. Pharmacol. 2017; 8: 688Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), FLCN was found to promote the movement of EGFR from early endosomes to the cell surface by acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) of Rab35; in the other study, FLCN was found to be a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) of Rab7 and to prevent the transport of EGFR from early to late endosomes (24Laviolette L.A. Mermoud J. Calvo I.A. Olson N. Boukhali M. Steinlein O.K. Roider E. Sattler E.C. Huang D. Teh B.T. Motamedi M. Haas W. Iliopoulos O. Negative regulation of EGFR signalling by the human folliculin tumour suppressor protein.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15866Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). At almost the same time, our group found that the amino acid permease PAT1 (also called slc36A1) is a cargo protein of FLCN (9Wu X. Zhao L. Chen Z. Ji X. Qiao X. Jin Y. Liu W. FLCN maintains the leucine level in lysosome to stimulate mTORC1.PLoS One. 2016; 11e0157100Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that FLCN promotes the localization of PAT1 on the plasma membrane and inhibits its localization on lysosomes through the Rab11A-mediated pathway (25Zhao L. Ji X. Zhang X. Li L. Jin Y. Liu W. FLCN is a novel Rab11A-interacting protein that is involved in the Rab11A-mediated recycling transport.J. Cell Sci. 2018; 131jcs218792Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This relocalization of PAT1 helps cells to acquire amino acids from the environment while maintaining a robust lysosomal amino acid pool that stimulates mTOR. This function of FLCN seems to be conserved in yeast (14Roberg K.J. Bickel S. Rowley N. Kaiser C.A. Control of amino-acid permease sorting in the late secretory pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by SEC13, LST4, LST7, and LST8.Genetics. 1997; 147: 1569-1584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), fly (26Liu W. Chen Z. Ma Y. Wu X. Jin Y. Hou S. Genetic characterization of the Drosophila Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome gene.PLoS One. 2013; 8e65869Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and human cells (25Zhao L. Ji X. Zhang X. Li L. Jin Y. Liu W. FLCN is a novel Rab11A-interacting protein that is involved in the Rab11A-mediated recycling transport.J. Cell Sci. 2018; 131jcs218792Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Regarding the underlying mechanism, we did not find clear GEF or GAP activity of FLCN toward Rab11A. Instead, we found that FLCN promotes the binding of PAT1 to Rab11A in a dose-dependent manner (25Zhao L. Ji X. Zhang X. Li L. Jin Y. Liu W. FLCN is a novel Rab11A-interacting protein that is involved in the Rab11A-mediated recycling transport.J. Cell Sci. 2018; 131jcs218792Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Through a similar mechanism, FLCN has been found to promote the interaction between Rab34 and its effector, RILP, during the positioning of lysosomes (27Starling G.P. Yip Y.Y. Sanger A. Morton P.E. Eden E.R. Dodding M.P. Folliculin directs the formation of a Rab34–RILP complex to control the nutrient-dependent dynamic distribution of lysosomes.EMBO Rep. 2016; 17: e201541382-e201541841Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, one appealing hypothesis is that the diversified BHD phenotypes might be due to the abnormal localization of specific FLCN substrates. In the current study, we identified transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1, or CD71) as a new substrate of FLCN and thus linked FLCN to iron metabolism. Iron is an essential nutrient for many biological processes, such as oxygen delivery and storage, DNA metabolism, and energy production. Both iron deficiency and iron overload can cause pathological changes (28Muckenthaler M.U. Rivella S. Hentze M.W. Galy B. A red carpet for iron metabolism.Cell. 2017; 168: 344-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). TfR1 is a ubiquitously expressed membrane protein. Most mammalian cells obtain iron from plasma via TfR1. Most Fe3+ ions in the plasma are loaded on transferrin (Tf), a ferric iron carrier produced mainly in the liver. The Tf-Fe3+ complex (called holo-Tf) binds to TfR1 and then enters the cell through membrane invagination. Once Fe3+ is released inside the cell, free Tf-TfR1 is sent back to the cell surface for another round of iron uptake. Blocking the cellular trafficking of TfR1 inhibits iron uptake and causes iron deficiency disorders (29Lim J.E. Jin O. Bennett C. Morgan K. Wang F. Trenor 3rd C.C. Fleming M.D. Andrews N.C. A mutation in Sec15l1 causes anemia in hemoglobin deficit (hbd) mice.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1270-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 30Chen C. Garcia-Santos D. Ishikawa Y. Seguin A. Li L.

Dalton A.J. et al.Snx3 regulates recycling of the transferrin receptor and iron assimilation.Cell Metab. 2013; 17: 343-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). On the other hand, high iron can be toxic by generating deleterious reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, cells have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to control the iron pool (31Kawabata H. Transferrin and transferrin receptors update.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2019; 133: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The promoter region of the TfR1 gene contains a hypoxia response element (HRE). Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family transcription factors bind this HRE and directly activate TfR1 transcription (32Bianchi L. Tacchini L. Cairo G. HIF-1-mediated activation of transferrin receptor gene transcription by iron chelation.Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4223-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Via a feedback mechanism, iron deficiency can stabilize the HIF protein by inactivating prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), which utilize iron as a cofactor to target HIF for degradation (33Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Desferrioxamine induces erythropoietin gene expression and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 DNA-binding activity: Implications for models of hypoxia signal transduction.Blood. 1993; 82: 3610-3615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 3’ noncoding region of TfR1 mRNA forms stem-loop structures called iron-responsive elements (IREs). Iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) bind these IREs and prevent degradation of the mRNA (34Owen D. Kühn L.C. Noncoding 3’ sequences of the transferrin receptor gene are required for mRNA regulation by iron.EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A robust iron pool increases iron–sulfur cluster production. The binding of IPRs with iron–sulfur clusters either converts IRP1 into a functional aconitase, which translocates to mitochondria to catalyze respiratory chain reactions, or directs IRP2 for degradation (35Anderson C.P. Shen M. Eisenstein R.S. Leibold EA Mammalian iron metabolism and its control by iron regulatory proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 1468-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 36Kühn L.C. Iron regulatory proteins and their role in controlling iron metabolism.Metallomics. 2015; 7: 232-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TfR1 can be regulated at the protein level. The TfR1 protein is constantly degraded in lysosomes (37Matsui T. Itoh T. Fukuda M. Small GTPase Rab12 regulates constitutive degradation of transferrin receptor.Traffic. 2011; 12: 1432-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 38Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Gillooly D.J.

Membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) 8 mediates the ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of the transferrin receptor.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 2798-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Depletion of iron by iron chelators such as desferrioxamine (DFO) increases the TfR1 protein level, but the mechanism is not fully understood (40Tong X. Kawabata H. Koeffler H.P. Iron deficiency can upregulate expression of transferrin receptor at both the mRNA and protein level.Br. J. Haematol. 2002; 116: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here, we report that FLCN regulates TfR1 transport through the Rab11A-mediated pathway. Loss of FLCN delays the recycling of TfR1 and decreases the iron pool. These findings provide new insights for deciphering the mechanisms underlying BHD syndrome. In a previous study, we carried out coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays and discovered that FLCN promotes the binding of PAT1 to Rab11A (25Zhao L. Ji X. Zhang X. Li L. Jin Y. Liu W. FLCN is a novel Rab11A-interacting protein that is involved in the Rab11A-mediated recycling transport.J. Cell Sci. 2018; 131jcs218792Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To determine whether FLCN specifically regulates PAT1, we also examined TfR1, which is continuously transported by Rab11A. Surprisingly, we found that FLCN also bound to TfR1, and loss of FLCN decreased the TfR1-Rab11A interaction (Fig. 6D in (25Zhao L. Ji X. Zhang X. Li L. Jin Y. Liu W. FLCN is a novel Rab11A-interacting protein that is involved in the Rab11A-mediated recycling transport.J. Cell Sci. 2018; 131jcs218792Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar)). However, these data were obtained in cells with GFP-Rab11A overexpression. To eliminate the potential artifacts caused by GFP-Rab11A, we repeated these assays in normal HEK293 cells using a monoclonal anti-TfR1 antibody for the precipitation experiment. Under steady-state conditions, TfR1 showed little interaction with endogenous Rab11A or FLCN (Fig. 1A), probably because under physiological conditions, only a small amount of TfR1 is transported by Rab11A and FLCN. Then, we decided to induce iron deficiency before the assay, based on the following two considerations. First, low iron levels can increase TfR1 expression (31Kawabata H. Transferrin and transferrin receptors update.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2019; 133: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); thus, co-IP would be easier to perform under these conditions. Second, we speculated that low iron levels may stimulate iron uptake by enhancing the TfR1-Rab11A interaction. To decrease the iron pool, we incubated cells with DFO, which is a clinically used iron chelator (41Chaston T.B. Richardson D.R. Iron chelators for the treatment of iron overload disease: Relationship between structure, redox activity, and toxicity.Am. J. Hematol. 2003; 73: 200-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We detected both Rab11A and FLCN in the TfR1 precipitates from cells treated with 100 μM DFO for 12 h. Moreover, the amount of TfR1-bound Rab11A was decreased in FLCN−/− cells (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that FLCN promotes the TfR1-Rab11A interaction, particularly under the iron-deficient conditions. FLCN has been found to bind to different Rabs via its C-terminal DENN domain (23Zheng J. Duan B. Sun S. Cui J. Du J. Zhang Y. Folliculin interacts with Rab35 to regulate EGF-induced EGFR degradation.Front. Pharmacol. 2017; 8: 688Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 24Laviolette L.A. Mermoud J. Calvo I.A. Olson N. Boukhali M. Steinlein O.K. Roider E. Sattler E.C. Huang D. Teh B.T. Motamedi M. Haas W. Iliopoulos O. Negative regulation of EGFR signalling by the human folliculin tumour suppressor protein.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15866Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Zhao L. Ji X. Zhang X. Li L. Jin Y. Liu W. FLCN is a novel Rab11A-interacting protein that is involved in the Rab11A-mediated recycling transport.J. Cell Sci. 2018; 131jcs218792Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 27Starling G.P. Yip Y.Y. Sanger A. Morton P.E. Eden E.R. Dodding M.P. Folliculin directs the formation of a Rab34–RILP complex to control the nutrient-dependent dynamic distribution of lysosomes.EMBO Rep. 2016; 17: e201541382-e201541841Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that FLCN might bind to TfR1 via a region other than its DENN domain. To test this hypothesis, we constructed plasmids expressing different forms of FLCN proteins, including wild-type FLCN (1–579), the N-terminal region (1–340), and the DENN domain (341–579), fused to a C-terminal HA tag. To exclude the influence of endogenous FLCN, we transfected these plasmids into FLCN−/− cells. Twenty-four hours after plasmid transfection, the cells were deprived of iron by incubation with 100 μM DFO for 12 h. The cell lysates were precipitated with an anti-HA antibody, followed by western blot (WB) analysis. As anticipated, both FLCN and its N-terminal region bound to TfR1; however, there was only a weak interaction between TfR1 and the FLCN DENN domain (Fig. 1C). We used a fluorescence conjugated transferrin (FITC-Tf) to monitor the trafficking of TfR1. Cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml FITC-Tf on ice for 20 min. At low temperatures, Tf still bound to TfR1 on the cell surface, but endocytosis was terminated. After the unbound FITC-Tf was washed away, the cells were transferred to 37 °C to reinitiate endocytosis. When the cells were transferred to 37 °C for 5 min, we observed similar levels of FITC-Tf in both wild-type and FLCN−/− cells. In addition, FITC-Tf translocated to an intracellular location very similar to the perinuclear recycling center (PRC, arrows in Fig. 2A), where Rab11A normally accumulates (42Grant B.D. Donaldson J.G. Pathways and mechanisms of endocytic recycling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 43Stenmark H. Rab GTPases as coordinators of vesicle traffic.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). This finding implies that FLCN has little influence on the translocation of TfR1 from the cell surface into the cell. After membrane trafficking was reinitiated by incubation at 37 °C for 50 min, the level of FITC-Tf was markedly decreased in wild-type cells (Fig. 2A), but a substantial amount of FITC-Tf was retained in FLCN−/− cells (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that loss of FLCN delayed the recycling of TfR1. To examine the uptake rate of Tf-bound iron, we employed a recently developed method using calcein-AM, a membrane-permeable, fluorescent iron probe whose fluorescence is quenched by binding with iron. Cells were first stained with 0.4 μM calcein-AM for 10 min and then incubated with 10 μg/ml holo-Tf for 3 h. After holo-Tf enters the cells and releases the Tf-bound iron, the intracellular calcein-AM signal decreases. The calcein signal can be measured by flow cytometric analysis, and the reduction in the signal after incubation with holo-Tf (representing the quenchable iron pool, QIP) correlates with the amount of holo-Tf taken up by the cells (44Riedelberger M. Kuchler K. Analyzing the quenchable iron pool in murine macrophages by flow cytometry.Bio-protocol. 2020; 10e3552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results revealed that the QIP was decreased in FLCN−/− cells, indicating reduced uptake of holo-Tf (Fig. 2C). We carried out a colorimetric ferrozine-based assay to measure the total cellular iron concentration directly. Compared with wild-type cells, FLCN−/− cells exhibited a trend of reduced total iron levels (Fig. 3A), although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.136, based on three repeated experiments). We used calcein-AM staining to assess the labile iron pool. FLCN−/− cells had stronger calcein signals than wild-type cells, suggesting that the labile iron pool was decreased by FLCN loss (Fig. 3B). When the iron pool is depleted, the cellular ferritin is degraded to release stored iron. Indeed, the level of FTH, a component of the ferritin protein complex, was decreased in FLCN−/− cells (Fig. 3C). In response to iron deficiency, the expression of iron assimilation genes, including TfR1 and the ferrous iron (Fe2+) transporter, also called divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1, or SLC11A2), increases. These increases can be achieved through multiple mechanisms, including transcriptional activation by HIF (32Bianchi L. Tacchini L. Cairo G. HIF-1-mediated activation of transferrin receptor gene transcription by iron chelation.Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4223-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 45Wang D. Wang L.H. Zhao Y. Lu Y.P. Zhu L.

Kühn L.C. Noncoding 3’ sequences of the transferrin receptor gene are required for mRNA regulation by iron.EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels of these genes can be used as indicators of the iron status. We performed real-time PCR (RT-PCR) to measure mRNA levels. A control assay showed that deprivation of iron by DFO chelation increased the expression of both TfR1 and DMT1 (Fig. 3D). Importantly, loss of FLCN produced a similar result but to a lesser extent than DFO treatment, suggesting that FLCN deficiency is less potent than DFO in decreasing the iron pool. Consistent with previous reports that FLCN inhibits the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α (12Yan M. Audet-Walsh É. Manteghi S. Dufour C.R. Walker B. Baba M. St-Pierre J. Giguère V. Pause A.
