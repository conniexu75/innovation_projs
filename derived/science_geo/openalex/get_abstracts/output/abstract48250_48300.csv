https://openalex.org/W1567197932,"Carbohydrate binding properties of a new plant lectin isolated from elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.) (SNA) bark were studied using the techniques of quantitative precipitation, hapten inhibition, and equilibrium dialysis. Purified SNA precipitates highly sialylated glycoproteins such as fetuin, orosomucoid, and ovine submaxillary mucin, but not their asialo derivatives. Hapten inhibition experiments showed that both D-Gal and D-GalNAc are weak inhibitors of SNA-glycophorin precipitation, but neither New5Ac nor Neu5Gc is an inhibitor. A series of oligosaccharides which contain the terminal Neu5Ac(alpha 2-6)Gal sequence showed an extremely high inhibitory potency (1,600-10,000 times more inhibitory than Gal). On the other hand, oligosaccharides with the Neu5Ac(alpha 2-3)Gal linkage were only 30-80 times more inhibitory than Gal, thus showing a marked preference for the 2,6-linked isomer. Hapten inhibition with Gal and its epimers suggested that the equatorial OH at C-3 and the axial OH at C-4 of the D-pyranose ring are strict requirements for binding. Conversion of the Neu5Ac residue to its 7-carbon analogue by selective periodate oxidation of its glyceryl side chain, followed by NaBH4 reduction, completely destroyed the ability of fetuin and orosomucoid to precipitate with SNA. Moreover, the same treatment of Neu5Ac(alpha 2-3)lactitol also abolished its ability to inhibit the precipitation reaction, suggesting that the glyceryl side chain of NBu5Ac (especially the C-8 and/or C-9 portion) is an important determinant for SNA. The increased inhibitory potency of various glycosides with beta-linked nonpolar aglycons suggested the presence of a hydrophibic interacting region adjacent to the carbohydrate binding site. The results of equilibrium dialysis using [3H] Neu5Ac(alpha 2-6)lactitol as ligand showed the presence of two equivalent, noninteracting carbohydrate binding sites in this tetrameric glycoprotein lectin (Ka = 3.9 X 10(5) M-1)."

https://openalex.org/W1952906612,"The ryanodine receptor has been purified from junctional terminal cisternae of fast skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The ryanodine receptor was solubilized with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) and stabilized by addition of phospholipids. The solubilized receptor showed the same [3H]ryanodine binding properties as the original SR vesicles in terms of affinity, Ca2+ dependence, and salt dependence. Purification of the ryanodine receptor was performed by sequential column chromatography on heparin-agarose and hydroxylapatite in the presence of CHAPS. The purified receptor bound 393 +/- 65 pmol of ryanodine/mg of protein (mean +/- S.E., n = 5). The purified receptor showed three bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Mr of 360,000, 330,000, and 175,000. Densitometry indicates that these are present in the ratio of 2/1/1, suggesting a monomer Mr of 1.225 X 10(6) and supported by gel exclusion chromatography in CHAPS. Electron microscopy of the purified preparation showed the square shape of 210 A characteristic of and comparable in size and shape to the feet structures of junctional terminal cisternae of SR, indicating that ryanodine binds directly to the feet structures. From the ryanodine binding data, the stoichiometry between ryanodine binding sites to the number of feet structures is estimated to be about 2. Since the ryanodine receptor is coupled to Ca2+ gating, the present finding suggests that the ryanodine receptor and Ca2+ release channel represent a functional unit, the structural unit being the foot structure which, in situ, is junctionally associated with the transverse tubules. It is across this triad junction that the signal for Ca2+ release is expressed. Thus, the foot structure appears to directly respond to the signal from transverse tubules, causing the release of Ca2+ from the junctional face membrane of the terminal cisternae of SR."

https://openalex.org/W2019962781,"By means of a thermodynamic perturbation method implemented with molecular dynamics, the relative free energy of binding was calculated for the enzyme thermolysin complexed with a pair of phosphonamidate and phosphonate ester inhibitors. The calculated difference in free energy of binding was 4.21 +/- 0.54 kilocalories per mole. This compares well with the experimental value of 4.1 kilocalories per mole. The method is general and can be used to determine a change or ""mutation"" in any system that can be suitably represented. It is likely to prove useful for protein and drug design."

https://openalex.org/W2056449122,"In recent years, a number of authors1–3 have suggested several geometric principles for the design of nature reserves based upon the hypothesis that nature reserves are analogous to land-bridge islands. Land-bridge islands are islands that were formerly connected to the mainland and were created by a rise in the level of the ocean. Land-bridge islands are considered supersaturated with species in that the ratio of island to mainland species numbers is higher than expected from the area of the island. As a result, the rate of extinction should exceed the rate of colonization on a land-bridge island, resulting in a loss of species that is suggested to be related to the size and degree of isolation of the island4If nature reserves are considered to be similar to land-bridge islands, because most are slowly becoming isolated from their surroundings by habitat disturbance outside the reserves4–8, several predictions follow. First, the total number of extinctions should exceed the total number of colonizations within a reserve; second, the number of extinctions should be inversely related to reserve size; and third, the number of extinctions should be directly related to reserve age. I report here that the natural post-establishment loss of mammalian species in 14 western North American national parks is consistent with these predictions of the land-bridge island hypothesis and that all but the largest western North American national parks are too small to retain an intact mammalian fauna."
https://openalex.org/W1510737016,"The carbohydrate binding specificity of Datura stramonium agglutinin was studied by analyzing the behavior of a variety of complex-type oligosaccharides on a D. Stramonium agglutinin-Sepharose column. Oligosaccharides which contain Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc-beta 1----4(Gal beta 1----GlcNAc beta 1----2)Man units are retarded in the column so long as the pentasaccharide unit is not substituted by other sugars. Oligosaccharides which contain unsubstituted Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6(Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----2)Man groups and those in which there is at least one Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc repeating unit present on an outer chain bind to the column and are eluted with buffer containing N-acetylglucosamine oligomers. Binding was not affected by the inner core portion of complex oligosaccharides nor by the presence of a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residue. With these principles in mind, the column can be used as an effective tool for the analysis of complex-type, asparagine-linked sugar chains."

https://openalex.org/W1221386567,"An enzymatic system has been isolated that catalyzes dihydroxylation of phthalate to form 1,2-dihydroxy-4,5-dicarboxy-3,5-cyclohexadiene with consumption of NADH and O2. This system is comprised of two proteins: a flavo-iron-sulfur protein with NADH-dependent oxidoreductase activity and a nonheme iron protein with oxygenase activity. Phthalate oxygenase is a large (approximately 217 kDa) protein composed of apparently identical 48-kDa monomers. The active enzyme has one Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] center and one mononuclear iron/monomer. Removal of the mononuclear iron by incubation with EDTA or with o-phenanthroline inhibits oxygenation; ferrous ion completely restores activity. No other metals are effective. Phthalate oxygenase is specific for phthalate or other closely related compounds. However, only phthalate is tightly coupled to NADH oxidation and O2 consumption with a stoichiometry of 1:1:1. Phthalate oxygenase is chemically competent to oxygenate phthalate when artificially supplied with reducing equivalents and O2. Phthalate oxygenase reductase is required, however, for efficient catalytic activity. The reductase is a monomeric 34-kDa flavo-iron-sulfur protein containing FMN and a plant-ferredoxin-type [2Fe-2S] center in a 1:1 ratio. Phthalate oxygenase reductase is specific for NADH but can pass electrons to a variety of acceptors, including: phthalate oxygenase, cytochrome c, ferricyanide, and dichlorophenolindophenol. This system is similar to other bacterial oxygenase systems involved in aromatic degradation including: benzoate dioxygenase, toluene dioxygenase, benzene dioxygenase, and 4-methoxybenzoate demethoxylase. However, phthalate oxygenase can be isolated in large quantities and is more stable than most other such systems."

https://openalex.org/W1637473005,"Incubation of horseradish peroxidase with phenylhydrazine and H2O2 markedly depresses the catalytic activity and the intensity, but not position, of the Soret band. Approximately 11-13 mol of phenylhydrazine and 25 mol of H2O2 are required per mol of enzyme to minimize the chromophore intensity. The enzyme retains some activity after such treatment, but this activity is eliminated if the enzyme is isolated and reincubated with phenylhydrazine. The prosthetic heme of the enzyme does not react with phenylhydrazine to give a sigma-bonded phenyl-iron complex, as it does in other hemoproteins, but is converted instead to the delta-mesophenyl and 8-hydroxymethyl derivatives. The loss of activity is due more to protein than heme modification, however. The inactivated enzyme reacts with H2O2 to give a spectroscopically detectable Compound I. The results imply that substrates interact with the heme edge rather than with the activated oxygen of Compounds I and II and specifically identify the region around the delta-meso-carbon and 8-methyl group as the exposed sector of the heme. Horseradish peroxidase, in contrast to cytochrome P-450, generally does not catalyze oxygen-transfer reactions. The present results indicate that oxygen-transfer reactions do not occur because the activated oxygen and the substrate are physically separated by a protein-imposed barrier in horseradish peroxidase."
https://openalex.org/W2009035150,"Yeast RNA polymerases A and C share an approximately equal to 40 kd subunit. We have identified, sequenced, and mutagenized in vitro the AC40 subunit gene. The RPC40 gene is unique in the yeast genome and is required for cell viability. This gene contains an open reading frame encoding a 37.6 kd protein having no significant homology with bacterial RNA polymerase subunits. The promoter region contains a 19 bp sequence also present in the largest subunit of RNA polymerase C. It also contains a well-conserved RPG box, a sequence found in the promoter region of many genes encoding the translational apparatus. A novel, plasmid-shuffling method was developed to isolate a large number of RPC40 ts mutants. One of these, ts4, was shown to be defective in the synthesis of RNA polymerases A and C at the restrictive temperature. In contrast, RNA polymerase B was made normally."

https://openalex.org/W2031787227,"This and two accompanying reports describe the intrinsic binding energy derived from a single hydrogen bond between an inhibitor and an enzyme. The results were obtained by comparing matched pairs of inhibitors of the zinc endopeptidase thermolysin that bind to the enzyme in an essentially identical manner but differ in the presence or absence of a specific hydrogen bond. This report describes five phosphorus-containing analogs of the peptides carbobenzoxy-Gly-Leu-X, in which the Gly-Leu peptide linkage is replaced with a phosphonate ester (-PO2(-)-O-). Values for the inhibition constants of these inhibitors show a direct relation with those of the corresponding phosphonamidate analogs (-PO2(-)-NH- in place of the Gly-Leu peptide moiety), which have been characterized previously as transition state analogs. However, each phosphonate ester is bound about 840 times more weakly than the analogous phosphonamidate, reflecting the loss of 4.0 +/- 0.1 kilocalories per mole in binding energy. From these results and the crystallographic analysis in the next report, it can be inferred that the value of 4.0 kilocalories per mole represents the intrinsic binding energy arising from a highly specific hydrogen binding interaction."

https://openalex.org/W1982778762,"In seven right-handed adults, the brain electrical patterns before accurate performance differed from the patterns before inaccurate performance. Activity overlying the left frontal cortex and the motor and parietal cortices contralateral to the performing hand preceded accurate left- or right-hand performance. Additional strong activity overlying midline motor and premotor cortices preceded left-hand performance. These measurements suggest that brief, spatially distributed neural activity patterns, or ""preparatory sets,"" in distinct cognitive, somesthetic-motor, and integrative motor areas of the human brain may be essential precursors of accurate visuomotor performance."

Chromosomal segregation, replication, and transcription were then examined. We found that the cells arrested in mitosis, with a cell division cycle (cdc) phenotype. Chromatin structure and nuclear segregation were disrupted. A full round of DNA replication took place after the repression of histone H2B mRNA synthesis. Active transcription and the induction of new transcripts also continued in the arrested cells."

https://openalex.org/W2093751310,The mode of binding to thermolysin of the ester analog Cbz-GlyP-(O)-Leu-Leu has been determined by x-ray crystallography and shown to be virtually identical (maximum difference 0.2 angstrom) with the corresponding peptide analog Cbz-GlyP-(NH)-Leu-Leu. The two inhibitors provide a matched pair of enzyme-inhibitor complexes that differ by 4.1 kilocalories per mole in intrinsic binding energy but are essentially identical except for the presence or absence of a specific hydrogen bond.

https://openalex.org/W1606335631,"Carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage is a well-characterized experimental model for studying liver fibrosis. We used this model to examine alpha 1(I), alpha 1(III), and alpha 1(IV) procollagen mRNA levels during the development of liver fibrosis. Rats were given 0.5 ml of carbon tetrachloride/kg of body weight for 1-6 weeks. The liver tissue was assayed for collagen content by measuring total hydroxyproline content. Specific increases in procollagen mRNAs were assayed by slot blot hybridization. There was a significant increase in hydroxyproline content of liver tissue following 3 weeks of carbon tetrachloride treatment. The increase in tissue collagen content correlated with an increase in alpha 1(I) procollagen mRNA levels. At 5 and 6 weeks of treatment, there was an increase in alpha 1(III) procollagen mRNA levels. alpha 1(IV) procollagen levels increased slightly with five injections of carbon tetrachloride treatment. These results suggest that specific increases in procollagen mRNAs in liver fibrosis parallel, but do not precede, increases in tissue collagen content."
https://openalex.org/W1491706945,"cDNA clones for the P-450(M-1) mRNA, which exhibits a male-specific expression in rat livers, were isolated by using synthetic oligonucleotides as the probes. Sequence analysis of the cDNAs showed that P-450(M-1) mRNA contains 1,853 nucleotides in addition to a poly(A) chain, and a single open reading frame of 1,500 nucleotides encodes a polypeptide of 500 amino acids with a Mr = 57,187. The predicted NH2-terminal sequence of 30 amino acids agrees well with that of the purified protein determined by Edman degradation, and the predicted primary structure included all the partial sequences of six internal peptides of P-450(M-1) obtained by the proteolytic digestion and a conserved amino acid sequence containing a putative heme-binding cysteine, proximate to the COOH terminus of the molecules. P-450(M-1) showed relatively high sequence similarity with P-450b (Fujii-Kuriyama, Y., Mizukami, Y., Kawajiri, K., Sogawa, K., and Muramatsu, M. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 2793-2797) (52% similarity), P-450-3b (Ozols, J., Heinemann, F. S., and Johnson, E. F. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 5427-5434) (64%), P-450-1 (Tukey, R. H., Okino, S., Barnes, H., Griffin, K. J., and Johnson, E. F. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 13347-13354) (74%), P-450PBc1 (Leighton, J. K., DeBrunner-Vossbrinck, B. A., and Kemper, B. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 4598-4603) (71%), while its sequence similarity with 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible P-450c and P-450d is rather low. Consequently, P-450(M-1) could be structurally classified into the phenobarbital-inducible type of P-450 gene family. RNA blot analysis using a synthetic oligonucleotide specific for P-450(M-1) revealed that P-450(M-1) mRNA was expressed exclusively in the livers of mature male rats in a sex-specific manner, but not in other tissues so far examined."
https://openalex.org/W1499940856,"We have determined the structure of the human U1 snRNA promoter by microinjection of several mutant U1 templates into Xenopus laevis oocytes. These deletion templates were assayed for their ability to express mature U1 RNA and for their ability to compete for limiting transcription factors. We have mapped five separate regions, called promoter elements A, B, C, D, and E. Element A, located between positions -8 and -50, stimulates transcription 3- to 5-fold increases the accuracy of initiation; element B (between -50 and -80) fixes the site of initiation and stimulates transcription greater than 100-fold; element C (upstream of -129) increases the efficiency of element B 3- to 5-fold; element D (between -191 and -231) is an orientation-independent and partially position-independent enhancer responsible for a 100-fold stimulation of transcription; element E (between -335 and -393) increases the ability to compete with other snRNA genes 4-fold. All five promoter elements are required for effective competition with the wild-type U1 promoter suggesting that binding of transcription factor(s) to the complex is cooperative. The U1 RNA and some mRNA gene transcription complexes appear to share one or more transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1580075072,"The binding of cations to ATP-G-actin has been assessed by measuring the kinetics of the increase in fluorescence of N-acetyl-N'-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine-labeled actin. Ca2+ and Mg2+ compete for a single high-affinity site on ATP-G-actin with KD values of 1.5-15 nM for Ca2+ and 0.1-1 microM for Mg2+, i.e. with affinities 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than previously reported (Frieden, C., Lieberman, D., and Gilbert, H. R. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8991-8993). As proposed by Frieden (Frieden, C. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 2882-2886), the Mg-actin complex undergoes a slow isomerization (Kis = 0.03-0.1) to a higher affinity state (K'D = 4-40 nM). The replacement of Ca2+ by Mg2+ at this high-affinity site causes a slow 10% increase in fluorescence that is 90% complete in about 200 s at saturating concentrations of Mg2+. Independently, Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ bind to low-affinity sites (KD values of 0.15 mM for Ca2+ and Mg2+ and 10 mM for K+) which causes a rapid 6-8% increase in fluorescence (complete in less than 5 s). We propose that the activation step that converts Ca-G-actin to a polymerizable species upon addition of Mg2+ is the binding of Mg2+ to the low-affinity sites and not the replacement of Ca2+ by Mg2+ at the high-affinity site."

Infection with a murine retrovirus (J-3) containing an avian v-myc rapidly induced plasmacytomas in pristane-primed BALB/cAn mice. Only 17% of the induced plasmacytomas that were karyotyped showed the characteristic chromosomal translocations involving the c-myc locus. Instead, all of the translocation-negative tumors demonstrated characteristic J-3 virus integration sites that were actively transcribed. Thus, the high levels of v-myc expression have replaced the requirement for chromosomal translocation in plasmacytomagenesis and accelerated the process of transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1591411915,"The gene encoding the bacteriocuprein superoxide dismutase from Photobacterium leiognathi, American Type Culture Collection strain 25521, was cloned in a pUC12 vector and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence predicted a 22-residue leader peptide amino-terminal to the known bacteriocuprein sequence. The expected precursor bacteriocuprein was directly identified in the in vitro translation products of the cloned gene by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and automated Edman degradation. Enzymatically active bacteriocuprein that lacked the leader peptide was identified in sonic extracts of Escherichia coli hosts containing the cloned gene. A single transcript of 580 nucleotides was observed in blots of total P. leiognathi RNA, and a unique site of transcriptional initiation was identified by primer extension analysis. P. leiognathi bacteriocuprein is the first bacteriocuprein whose gene has been isolated and sequenced and the first copper-zinc superoxide dismutase in which a leader peptide has been found. The presence of a leader peptide suggests that the bacteriocuprein is localized in the membrane or periplasm, in contrast to the eukaryotic copper-zinc superoxide dismutases, which are cytoplasmic enzymes. Such a difference in intracellular location could be important for understanding the presence and function of the uncommon, bacteriocuprein superoxide dismutase in P. leiognathi."
https://openalex.org/W2028582426,"Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) have specific vector-vertebrate host cycles in nature. The molecular basis of restriction of virus replication to a very limited number of vector species is unknown, but the present study suggests that viral attachment proteins are important determinants of vector-virus interactions. The principal vector of La Crosse (LAC) virus is the mosquito Aedes triseriatus, and LAC virus efficiently infects the mosquito when ingested. However, a variant (V22) of LAC virus, which was selected by growing the virus in the presence of a monoclonal antibody, was markedly restricted in its ability to infect Ae. triseriatus when it was ingested. Only 15% of the mosquitoes that ingested V22 became infected and 5% of these developed disseminated infections. In contrast, 89% of the mosquitoes that ingested LAC became infected and 74% developed disseminated infections. When V22 was passed three times in mosquitoes by feeding, a revertant virus, V22M3, was obtained that infected 85% of Ae. triseriatus ingesting this virus. In addition, V22M3 regained the antigenic phenotype and fusion capability of the parent LAC virus. These results suggest that the specificity of LAC virus-vector interactions is markedly influenced by the efficiency of the fusion function of the G1 envelope glycoprotein operating at the midgut level in the arthropod vector."

https://openalex.org/W1579067160,"Many murine cells express two mRNAs with markedly different sizes (2.0 and 3.1 kilobases (kb)) that hybridize with cDNA probes for cytosolic malic enzyme ((S)-malate NADP+ oxidoreductase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating, EC 1.1.1.40). A series of overlapping cDNA clones corresponding to 3129 nucleotides of malic enzyme mRNA was isolated and sequenced to determine the relationship between the two mRNAs and establish the primary structure of mouse malic enzyme. The larger mRNA has an open reading frame of 1716 nucleotides followed by a 3' untranslated region of 1348 nucleotides. The sequence of an exceptionally G/C-rich (88%) portion (65 nucleotides) of the 5' noncoding region was also established. An uncommon poly A addition signal (AUUAAA) is used during the processing of the 3.1-kb mRNA. The 2.0-kb mRNA results from the utilization of another poly A addition signal that truncates the 3' noncoding sequence by approximately 1 kb. The mRNA coding sequence indicates that the malic enzyme subunit contains 572 amino acid residues and has a Mr of 64,000. Two putative components of an NADP-binding domain are located between residues 100 and 165. During the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes both the rate of synthesis and relative mRNA concentration for malic enzyme and another lipogenic enzyme, ATP-citrate lyase, are coordinately increased 5-7-fold. However, as preadipocytes approach confluence, the mRNA levels for both lipogenic enzymes transiently increase 3-4-fold, whereas the rates of synthesis of the two proteins are only slightly elevated. Thus, lipogenic enzyme expression is controlled at a pretranslational level during adipogenesis, but the accumulation of the same enzymes may also be subject to translational control in the fibroblast-like preadipocytes. In contrast, mRNA coding for a third enzyme required for lipogenesis, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, is not detected in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, but rapidly accumulates during adipocyte development."
https://openalex.org/W206678391,"The level of inositol phosphates was measured in rat hepatocytes treated with 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (menadione) or tert-butyl hydroperoxide, which cause Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores and an increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration. Although neither agent produced any apparent changes in the resting level of inositol phosphates, pretreatment of hepatocytes with either menadione or tert-butyl hydroperoxide, as well as with several sulfhydryl reagents, markedly inhibited the increase in inositol phosphates induced by both hormonal and nonhormonal stimuli. Addition of dithiothreitol to menadione- or tert-butyl hydroperoxide-treated hepatocytes reversed this inhibition and reestablished responsiveness to extracellular stimuli. Our findings suggest that the inhibition of the inositol phosphate response by menadione and tert-butyl hydroperoxide occurs through the modification of critical sulfhydryl group(s) and that the alterations in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis occurring during the metabolism of menadione and tert-butyl hydroperoxide in hepatocytes are not mediated by inositol phosphates."

https://openalex.org/W194350719,"Dopamine beta-hydroxylase is present in the bovine adrenal medulla in two forms: soluble and membrane-bound. In a previous study, it was shown that the tetrameric, soluble form of the enzyme undergoes dissociation into two identical dimeric subunits and that this subunit dissociation is dependent on pH and ADP binding (Dhawan, S., Hensley, P., Osborne, J. C., Jr., and Fleming, P. J. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7680-7684). Here we report the effect of pH and ADP on the dissociation of the membranous form of dopamine beta-hydroxylase into two nonidentical subunits. Negative stain electron microscopy of purified membranous hydroxylase showed largely tetrameric species together with occasional dimeric species. The tetrameric images of membranous hydroxylase were similar to, but clearly different from, previously published negative stain images of soluble hydroxylase (Duong, L. T., Fleming, P. J., and Ornberg, R. L. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2393-2398). Quantitative binding of ADP to the membranous hydroxylase revealed the existence of two binding sites per dimeric subunit. ADP binding and low pH both promote dissociation of a hydrophilic, catalytically active subunit from the membranous enzyme reconstituted onto phospholipid vesicles. Kinetic analyses of reconstituted membranous hydroxylase activity were consistent with the existence of tetrameric and dimeric catalytic species in equilibrium. All of the hydrophilic subunits of the purified soluble hydroxylase bind to the hydrophobic subunits of the reconstituted membranous hydroxylase. We propose that, in the chromaffin granules, the soluble hydroxylase subunits are in equilibrium association with the membrane-bound hydroxylase subunits and that the hydrophilic subunits of both soluble and membranous hydroxylase are identical."
https://openalex.org/W1502287851,"In Reuber rat hepatoma cells (R-Y121B), alkaline phosphatase activity increased without de novo enzyme synthesis (Sorimachi, K., and Yasumura, Y. (1986) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 885, 272-281). The enzyme was partially purified by butanol extraction from the particulate fractions. The incubation of the extracted alkaline phosphatase with the cytosol fraction induced a large increase in enzyme activity (5-10-fold of control). The dialyzed cytosol was more effective than the undialyzed cytosol during an early period of incubation at 37 degrees C. This difference between the dialyzed and the undialyzed cytosol fractions was due to endogenous Na+. For maximal activation of the enzyme, both Mg2+ above 1 mM and Zn2+ at low concentrations (below 0.01 mM) were needed, although Zn2+ at high concentrations (above 0.1 mM) showed an inhibitory effect. Zn2+ and Mg2+ alone slightly increased alkaline phosphatase activity. This activation of the enzyme was temperature dependent and was not observed at 0 or 4 degrees C. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate showed that the increase in alkaline phosphatase activity did not involve the fragmentation of the enzyme and that 65Zn2+ bound to it during enzyme activation with 65Zn2+ and Mg2+. The cytosol fraction not only supplied Zn2+ to the nascent enzyme but also increased the maximal enzyme activity more than did direct addition of metal ions. Ferritin and metallothionein contributed to the activation of alkaline phosphatase with the metal ions. Since the binding of Zn2+ and Mg2+ to the nascent alkaline phosphatase is disturbed in Reuber rat hepatoma cells (R-Y121B), the apoenzyme is accumulated inside the cells. The binding of Zn2+ and Mg2+ to the apoenzyme readily takes place in the cell homogenates accompanied by an increase in catalytic activity without new enzyme synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1505742720,"The interaction between rat mammary gland thioesterase II and fatty acid synthetase has been studied by a variety of physicochemical techniques. Pyrene-labeled thioesterase II does not exhibit increased fluorescence anisotropy when mixed with fatty acid synthetase, suggesting that the enzymes do not readily form a complex. Nevertheless, the functional interaction between the enzymes can be easily demonstrated by observing the hydrolysis, by unmodified thioesterase II, of acyl chains from their thioester linkage to the 4-phosphopantetheine of the fatty acid synthetase. This hydrolytic reaction is not inhibited even in the presence of a large excess of fatty acid synthetase with vacant 4'-phosphopantetheine thiols, indicating that interaction occurs only between thioesterase and fatty acid synthetase species which carry acyl chains on the 4'-phosphopantetheine thiols. A novel model system was devised which allowed us to explore the nature of the physical interaction between the two enzymes under conditions where the synthetase was actively engaged in acyl chain assembly. Fatty acid synthetase was treated with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride to inhibit its resident thioesterase activity, immobilized via a specific antibody to a column of Sepharose 4B, and exposed to the substrates required for acyl-enzyme assembly. When thioesterase II was introduced to the column, it passed through unretarded even though it efficiently catalyzed hydrolysis of the immobilized S-acyl synthetase en route. These results indicate that the two enzymes associate when an acyl chain is present on the synthetase and that they dissociate rapidly following completion of the catalytic process. Thus, the mammary system differs from that of the avian uropygial gland in which the two enzymes associate to form a stable complex even in the absence of substrates."

https://openalex.org/W190593492,"Rabbit secretory components exist in two forms which differ in apparent mass by about 25 kDa. Each of these two forms were reduced, carboxymethylated, and extensively digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and characterized by NH2- and COOH-terminal sequence determination and/or amino acid analysis. They were aligned with the protein sequence predicted from the cDNA nucleotide sequence encoding the rabbit poly(Ig) receptor (Mostov, K. E., Friedlander, M., and Blobel, G. (1984) Nature 308, 37-43). All peptides belonging to the fourth and fifth domains except one (positions 488-496) were accounted for in both forms. In addition, limited tryptic proteolysis of the native low Mr secretory components produced the intact 18-kDa NH2-terminal domain (positions 1-117) and the 30-kDa fragment encompassing the fourth and fifth domains. These results suggest that the smaller polypeptide derives from the larger secretory component form by the deletion of the second and third domains."
https://openalex.org/W2129732030,"Accounting for the enormous diversity of the immune response has been the underlying question of immunology since Paul Ehrlich first addressed it in 1900. The problem has at least two facets: the genetic organization and the nature of the cells that carry out the immune response. The last decade has seen remarkable progress toward the understanding of both these questions, and attention is now being focused on the combined problem, viz., what are the characteristics of the cell populations that house this genetic apparatus, and do the interactions of the cells with each other play a role in the nature of the immune repertoire? The most recent in a series of papers from Rajewsky’s laboratory (Siekevitz et al., Cell, this issue) provides a good vantage point from which to survey the trends of the work leading to the clarification of the problem. Generating the Diversity of the Immune Repertoire The specificity of an individual antibody molecule, and thus the diversity of the specificities of the population of antibodies, is generated through the reorganization of a series of germ-line-encoded V region gene segments in one specialized type of somatic cell, the lymphocyte. These germ-line segments consist of V (variable) and J (joining) segments for light chains and V, D (diversity), and J segments for heavy chains (see Tonegawa, Nature 302, 575-581, 1983). A good estimate is that there are 300 V,, 4 J,, 2 Vh, and 3 Jh segments encoding light chains in the mouse. Thus there would be approximately lo3 VL regions available through somatic generation ([2 x 3) + [300 x 41). Similarly, there are 200 VH, 12 D, and 4 JH gene segments for heavy chains, which allows the generation of approximately IO4 VH. The combination of one heavy and one light chain per antigen-combining site gives the system approximately 10’ possible antigencombining sites. In this manner several hundred gene segments can give rise to ca. 10’ different specificities. But we know that there is additional diversity generated at the junctions of the recombining segments, and it is becoming increasingly clear that somatic mutation introduces a very large factor of diversity. A ball-park estimate that would probably offend the fewest people is that the repertoire consists of lOlo different specificities. These gene rearrangements occur in lymphocytes during lymphopoiesis, so that the immune repertoire, as expressed in the lymphocytes, is generated stochasticallyi.e., totally independent of antigen. That the existence of the repertoire precedes the introduction of antigen was predicted in the clonal selection theory of Burnet and has been a basic paradigm of cellular immunology for two decades. According to the clonal selection theory, each lymphocyte displays its encoded immunoglobulin product Minireview"
https://openalex.org/W2169479016,"Iodination of bovine thyrotropin (TSH) using a lactoperoxidase-catalyzed labeling method at pH 5.6 results in modification of both the alpha- and beta-subunits. In particular, 3 of the 5 tyrosine residues of the alpha-subunit and 9 of the 11 tyrosine residues in the beta-subunit are accessible to surface iodination. However, the reactivity of these tyrosine residues in bovine TSH toward iodination under these enzyme-catalyzed conditions follows the order alpha-Tyr-21 much greater than alpha-Tyr-92, -93, approximately equal to beta-Tyr-45, -54 greater than beta-Tyr-74 greater than beta-Tyr-18 approximately equal to beta-Tyr-112 greater than beta-Tyr-104 approximately equal to beta-Tyr-92 greater than beta-Tyr-7 greater than beta-Tyr-77. From reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography tryptic mapping, leucyl aminopeptidase M digestion, and microsequence analysis, it is clear that diiodination of the tyrosine residues is not favored for the beta-subunit with the exception of beta-Tyr-7, whereas diiodination was observed with alpha-Tyr-21 and alpha-Tyr-92/93. These data on iodination sites are evaluated in terms of the known receptor binding features of iodinated bovine TSH preparations as well as in terms of the surface accessibility of these specific residues as predicted from topographical algorithms based on an analysis of hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of the subunits. The results provide an explanation for the anomalously low bound/total tracer ratio frequently observed in radioreceptor assay procedures for TSH and suggest a basis for further evaluation of the determinant loops associated with the hormone specificity of the beta-subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2098733772,"The Japanese Pogada Tree (Sophora japonica) contains at least four distinct lectins distributed among seeds, bark, and leaf tissues of the plant. All of these lectins are N-acetylgalactosamine-specific, have molecular weights of about 130,000, are glycoproteins and possess substantial sequence homology. However, they are products of distinct genes. We have crystallized Sophora lectins from bark, seeds, and two different lectins from leaves. Multiple crystal forms of each variety have been obtained by vapor diffusion with polyethylene glycol 4,000 solutions, and five of the crystal forms have been characterized by X-ray diffraction. The data demonstrates that at least in the case of leaf lectin II, the tetrameric molecule contains at least one exact dyad axis. Several of the crystals appear suitable for high resolution structure analysis."

https://openalex.org/W1536114821,"A novel procedure for immobilization of enzymatically active fatty acid synthetase is presented. The enzyme is coupled to a Sepharose 4B matrix containing covalently attached antibodies which recognize, and bind specifically to, the thioesterase domain of this polyfunctional enzyme. A continuous flow system is described for assay of the immobilized enzyme. Fatty acid synthetase activity apparently is not limited by movement of substrates through the Nernst diffusion layer surrounding the matrix particles, since normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics are observed and reaction rates are independent of flow rate. The Km values for acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, the pH/activity profile, and the reaction products are essentially the same as for the freely soluble enzyme, although the specific activity is lower by about 55%. The preparation and characterization of immobilized subunits of the enzyme could provide a valuable approach for studying the role of structural and functional subunit interactions in the enzyme. In addition, the immobilized enzyme offers a model for studying the properties of this enzyme in a highly structured environment such as might exist in vivo, permitting study of both physical and functional interactions of fatty acid synthetase with other lipogenic enzymes."
