https://openalex.org/W2561902849,"The interplay between magnetic fields and interacting particles can lead to exotic phases of matter that exhibit topological order and high degrees of spatial entanglement. Although these phases were discovered in a solid-state setting, recent innovations in systems of ultracold neutral atoms-uncharged atoms that do not naturally experience a Lorentz force-allow the synthesis of artificial magnetic, or gauge, fields. This experimental platform holds promise for exploring exotic physics in fractional quantum Hall systems, owing to the microscopic control and precision that is achievable in cold-atom systems. However, so far these experiments have mostly explored the regime of weak interactions, which precludes access to correlated many-body states. Here, through microscopic atomic control and detection, we demonstrate the controlled incorporation of strong interactions into a two-body system with a chiral band structure. We observe and explain the way in which interparticle interactions induce chirality in the propagation dynamics of particles in a ladder-like, real-space lattice governed by the interacting Harper-Hofstadter model, which describes lattice-confined, coherently mobile particles in the presence of a magnetic field. We use a bottom-up strategy to prepare interacting chiral quantum states, thus circumventing the challenges of a top-down approach that begins with a many-body system, the size of which can hinder the preparation of controlled states. Our experimental platform combines all of the necessary components for investigating highly entangled topological states, and our observations provide a benchmark for future experiments in the fractional quantum Hall regime."
https://openalex.org/W2687532560,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychiatric disease with devastating physical consequences, with a pathophysiological mechanism still to be elucidated. Metagenomic studies on anorexia nervosa have revealed profound gut microbiome perturbations as a possible environmental factor involved in the disease. In this study we performed a comprehensive analysis integrating data on gut microbiota with clinical, anthropometric and psychological traits to gain new insight in the pathophysiology of AN. Fifteen AN women were compared with fifteen age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. AN diet was characterized by a significant lower energy intake, but macronutrient analysis highlighted a restriction only in fats and carbohydrates consumption. Next generation sequencing showed that AN intestinal microbiota was significantly affected at every taxonomic level, showing a significant increase of Enterobacteriaceae, and of the archeon Methanobrevibacter smithii compared with healthy controls. On the contrary, the genera Roseburia, Ruminococcus and Clostridium, were depleted, in line with the observed reduction in AN of total short chain fatty acids, butyrate, and propionate. Butyrate concentrations inversely correlated with anxiety levels, whereas propionate directly correlated with insulin levels and with the relative abundance of Roseburia inulinivorans, a known propionate producer. BMI represented the best predictive value for gut dysbiosis and metabolic alterations, showing a negative correlation with Bacteroides uniformis (microbiota), with alanine aminotransferase (liver function), and with psychopathological scores (obsession-compulsion, anxiety, and depression), and a positive correlation with white blood cells count. In conclusion, our findings corroborate the hypothesis that the gut dysbiosis could take part in the AN neurobiology, in particular in sustaining the persistence of alterations that eventually result in relapses after renourishment and psychological therapy, but causality still needs to be proven."

https://openalex.org/W2718800259,"At redshift z = 2, when the Universe was just three billion years old, half of the most massive galaxies were extremely compact and had already exhausted their fuel for star formation(1-4). It is believed that they were formed in intense nuclear starbursts and that they ultimately grew into the most massive local elliptical galaxies seen today, through mergers with minor companions(5,6), but validating this picture requires higher-resolution observations of their centres than is currently possible. Magnification from gravitational lensing offers an opportunity to resolve the inner regions of galaxies(7). Here we report an analysis of the stellar populations and kinematics of a lensed z = 2.1478 compact galaxy, which surprisingly turns out to be a fast-spinning, rotationally supported disk galaxy. Its stars must have formed in a disk, rather than in a merger-driven nuclear starburst(8). The galaxy was probably fed by streams of cold gas, which were able to penetrate the hot halo gas until they were cut off by shock heating from the dark matter halo(9). This result confirms previous indirect indications(10-13) that the first galaxies to cease star formation must have gone through major changes not just in their structure, but also in their kinematics, to evolve into present-day elliptical galaxies."
https://openalex.org/W2719956794,"To characterize the microbiological, molecular and epidemiological data of an outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in a tertiary-care hospital in Mexico.From September 2014 to July 2015, all CRE clinical isolates recovered during an outbreak in the Hospital Civil ""Fray Antonio Alcalde"" in Jalisco, Mexico were screened for antimicrobial susceptibility, carbapenemase production, carbapenemase-encoding genes, and plasmid profiles. Horizontal transfer of imipenem resistance; and clonal diversity by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST); as well as biofilm production and the presence of 14 virulence genes were analyzed in selected isolates.Fifty-two carbapenem-resistant isolates corresponding to 5 species were detected, i.e., Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 46), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 3), Escherichia coli (n = 1), Providencia rettgeri (n = 1) and Citrobacter freundii (n = 1) with carbapenemase encoding genes blaNDM-1 (n = 48), blaVIM (n = 3), blaIMP (n = 1) and blaKPC (n = 1) detected in these isolates. The blaNDM-1 gene was detected in plasmids from 130- to 170-kb in K. pneumoniae (n = 46); E. cloacae (n = 3), E. coli (n = 1) and P. rettgeri (n = 1). The transfer of plasmids harboring the blaNDM-1 gene was obtained in eight transconjugants. One plasmid restriction pattern was detected, with the blaNDM-1 identified in different restriction fragments. Predominant clone A of K. pneumoniae isolates archived 28/46 (60%) isolates and belongs to ST392. Besides, ST307, ST309, ST846, ST2399, and ST2400 were detected for K. pneumoniae; as well as E. cloacae ST182 and E. coli ST10. The fimA and uge genes were more likely to be identified in K. pneumoniae carbapenem-susceptible isolates (p = <0.001) and biofilm production was more liable to be observed in carbapenem-resistant isolates (p = <0.05).Four Enterobacteriaceae species harboring the blaNDM-1 gene were detected in a nosocomial outbreak in Mexico; horizontal transfer and strain transmission were demonstrated for the blaNDM-1 gene. Given the variation in the size of the plasmid harboring blaNDM-1, complex rearrangements must also be occurring."
https://openalex.org/W2660675868,"The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mediates viral entry into target cells. Cleavage and activation of SARS S by a host cell protease is essential for infectious viral entry and the responsible enzymes are potential targets for antiviral intervention. The type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 cleaves and activates SARS S in cell culture and potentially also in the infected host. Here, we investigated which determinants in SARS S control cleavage and activation by TMPRSS2. We found that SARS S residue R667, a previously identified trypsin cleavage site, is also required for S protein cleavage by TMPRSS2. The cleavage fragments produced by trypsin and TMPRSS2 differed in their decoration with N-glycans, suggesting that these proteases cleave different SARS S glycoforms. Although R667 was required for SARS S cleavage by TMPRSS2, this residue was dispensable for TMPRSS2-mediated S protein activation. Conversely, residue R797, previously reported to be required for SARS S activation by trypsin, was dispensable for S protein cleavage but required for S protein activation by TMPRSS2. Collectively, these results show that different residues in SARS S control cleavage and activation by TMPRSS2, suggesting that these processes are more complex than initially appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2661835989,"The availability of spatially referenced environmental data and species occurrence records in online databases enable practitioners to easily generate species distribution models (SDMs) for a broad array of taxa. Such databases often include occurrence records of unknown reliability, yet little information is available on the influence of data quality on SDMs generated for rare, elusive, and cryptic species that are prone to misidentification in the field. We investigated this question for the fisher (Pekania pennanti), a forest carnivore of conservation concern in the Pacific States that is often confused with the more common Pacific marten (Martes caurina). Fisher occurrence records supported by physical evidence (verifiable records) were available from a limited area, whereas occurrence records of unknown quality (unscreened records) were available from throughout the fisher's historical range. We reserved 20% of the verifiable records to use as a test sample for both models and generated SDMs with each dataset using Maxent. The verifiable model performed substantially better than the unscreened model based on multiple metrics including AUCtest values (0.78 and 0.62, respectively), evaluation of training and test gains, and statistical tests of how well each model predicted test localities. In addition, the verifiable model was consistent with our knowledge of the fisher's habitat relations and potential distribution, whereas the unscreened model indicated a much broader area of high-quality habitat (indices > 0.5) that included large expanses of high-elevation habitat that fishers do not occupy. Because Pacific martens remain relatively common in upper elevation habitats in the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada, the SDM based on unscreened records likely reflects primarily a conflation of marten and fisher habitat. Consequently, accurate identifications are far more important than the spatial extent of occurrence records for generating reliable SDMs for the fisher in this region. We strongly recommend that practitioners avoid using anecdotal occurrence records to build SDMs but, if such data are used, the validity of resulting models should be tested with verifiable occurrence records."
https://openalex.org/W2660423122,"Rotaviruses of species A (RVA) are a common cause of diarrhoea in children and the young of various other mammals and birds worldwide. To investigate possible interspecies transmission of RVAs, whole genomes of 18 human and 6 domestic animal RVA strains identified in Uganda between 2012 and 2014 were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform. The backbone of the human RVA strains had either a Wa- or a DS-1-like genetic constellation. One human strain was a Wa-like mono-reassortant containing a DS-1-like VP2 gene of possible animal origin. All eleven genes of one bovine RVA strain were closely related to those of human RVAs. One caprine strain had a mixed genotype backbone, suggesting that it emerged from multiple reassortment events involving different host species. The porcine RVA strains had mixed genotype backbones with possible multiple reassortant events with strains of human and bovine origin.Overall, whole genome characterisation of rotaviruses found in domestic animals in Uganda strongly suggested the presence of human-to animal RVA transmission, with concomitant circulation of multi-reassortant strains potentially derived from complex interspecies transmission events. However, whole genome data from the human RVA strains causing moderate and severe diarrhoea in under-fives in Uganda indicated that they were primarily transmitted from person-to-person."
https://openalex.org/W2719931193,"M1 and M2 activated macrophages (Mϕs) have different roles in inflammation. Because pathogens may first encounter resting cells, we investigated lipid mediator profiles prior to full activation. Human monocytes were differentiated with granulocyte Mϕ colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or Mϕ colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), which are known to prime toward M1 or M2 phenotypes, respectively. Lipid mediators released during resting conditions and produced in response to bacterial stimuli (LPS/N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine or peptidoglycan) were quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In resting conditions, both Mϕ phenotypes released primarily proresolving lipid mediators (prostaglandin E2 metabolite, lipoxin A4, and 18-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid). A striking shift toward proinflammatory eicosanoids was observed when the same cells were exposed (30 min) to bacterial stimuli: M-CSF Mϕs produced considerably more 5-lipoxygenase products, particularly leukotriene C4, potentially linked to M2 functions in asthma. Prostaglandins were formed by both Mϕ types. In the M-CSF cells, there was also an enhanced release of arachidonic acid and activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 However, GM-CSF cells expressed higher levels of 5-lipoxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, and in ionophore incubations these cells also produced the highest levels of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. In summary, GM-CSF and M-CSF Mϕs displayed similar proresolving lipid mediator formation in resting conditions but shifted toward different proinflammatory eicosanoids upon bacterial stimuli. This demonstrates that preference for specific eicosanoid pathways is primed by CSFs before full M1/M2 activation.-Lukic, A., Larssen, P., Fauland, A., Samuelsson, B., Wheelock, C. E., Gabrielsson, S., Radmark, O. GM-CSF- and M-CSF-primed macrophages present similar resolving but distinct inflammatory lipid mediator signatures."
https://openalex.org/W2650870900,"Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) enable imaging of in vivo brain cell activity with high sensitivity and specificity. In contrast to viral infection or in utero electroporation, indicator expression in transgenic reporter lines is induced noninvasively, reliably, and homogenously. Recently, Cre/tTA-dependent reporter mice were introduced, which provide high-level expression of green fluorescent GECIs in a cell-type-specific and inducible manner when crossed with Cre and tTA driver mice. Here, we generated and characterized the first red-shifted GECI reporter line of this type using R-CaMP1.07, a red fluorescent indicator that is efficiently two-photon excited above 1000 nm. By crossing the new R-CaMP1.07 reporter line to Cre lines driving layer-specific expression in neocortex we demonstrate its high fidelity for reporting action potential firing in vivo, long-term stability over months, and versatile use for functional imaging of excitatory neurons across all cortical layers, especially in the previously difficult to access layers 4 and 6."
https://openalex.org/W2655319527,"In the present study, we examined the eye movement behaviour of children and adults looking at five Van Gogh paintings in the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam. The goal of the study was to determine the role of top-down and bottom-up attentional processes in the first stages of participants’ aesthetic experience. Bottom-up processes were quantified by determining a salience map for each painting. Top-down processing was manipulated by first allowing participants to view the paintings freely, then providing background information about each painting, and then allowing them to view the paintings a second time. The salience analysis showed differences between the eye movement behaviour of children and adults, and differences between the two phases. In the children, the first five fixations during the free viewing phase were strongly related to visually salient features of the paintings—indicating a strong role for bottom-up factors. In the second phase, after children had received background information, top-down factors played a more prominent role. By contrast, adults’ observed patterns were similar in both phases, indicating that bottom-up processes did not play a major role when they viewed the paintings. In the second phase, children and adults both spent more time looking at regions that were mentioned in the background information. This effect was greater for adults than for children, confirming the notion that adults, when viewing paintings, rely much more on top-down processing than children."

ERMES functions in lipid exchange between the ER and mitochondria, protein import into mitochondria, and maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and genome. Here, we report that ERMES is also required for iron homeostasis. Loss of ERMES components activates an Aft1-dependent iron deficiency response even in iron-replete conditions, leading to accumulation of excess iron inside the cell. This function is independent of known ERMES roles in calcium regulation, phospholipid biosynthesis, or effects on mitochondrial morphology.

Different types of membrane-bound organelles compartmentalize eukaryotic cells, and each organelle performs specific functions critical to the cell's survival. Organelles can increase the efficiency of biochemical reactions by concentrating biomolecules within them and confine potentially harmful metabolites and proteins to protect the rest of the cell. However, the compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells also creates the need for communication between different organelles. Such communication is critical for cells to maintain homeostasis, link various biological processes, or respond to stress. A mechanism for interorganelle interaction is establishment of physical links that enable exchange of metabolites between different organelles.

Orthologues of the defining components of the yeast ERMES complex have not been found in metazoans, suggesting that the functions of ERMES may be achieved through other mechanisms in higher eukaryotes. Iron is an essential element for almost all living organisms and participates in a wide variety of biological processes as a critical cofactor for numerous enzymes and proteins. However, iron can also be toxic due to its ability to generate reactive oxygen species in aerobic conditions. Cells therefore maintain an iron quota that is determined by its utility versus toxicity. In yeast, cells acquire iron through non-reductive siderophore–iron transporters as well as reductive uptake systems that includes a family of ferric reductases and low- and high-affinity iron transporters (25.Philpott C.C. Iron uptake in fungi: a system for every source.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In iron-limited conditions, the major iron-dependent transcription factor activator of ferrous transport protein 1 (Aft1p) shuttles and accumulates in the nucleus to activate a transcriptional program for both iron uptake and acclimation to iron-limited metabolism (26.Yamaguchi-Iwai Y.

Cell. 2008; 7: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The mRNA-binding protein cysteine-three histidine 2 (Cth2p) is also activated to post-transcriptionally regulate many genes related to iron homeostasis through mediating RNA degradation, which is functionally similar to apoaconitase iron regulatory proteins 1 and 2 in vertebrate cells (29.Müllner E.W.

A specific mRNA binding factor regulates the iron-dependent stability of cytoplasmic transferrin receptor mRNA.Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 30.Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Coordinated remodeling of cellular metabolism during iron deficiency through targeted mRNA degradation.Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Interestingly, disruption of iron–sulfur (Fe–S) cluster assembly, which occurs in the mitochondrial matrix, triggers the iron deficiency response. For instance, cells lacking yeast frataxin homolog 1 (Yfh1p), a mitochondrial component of the iron–sulfur cluster assembly pathway, activate the Aft1-dependent transcriptional program and accumulate excess iron in the mitochondria (31.Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Regulation of mitochondrial iron accumulation by Yfh1p, a putative homolog of frataxin.Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Considering that iron–sulfur cluster biosynthesis occurs in mitochondria and impaired mitochondrial iron–sulfur biosynthesis activates the iron deficiency response, we investigated whether iron homeostasis is perturbed in ERMES mutants. Here, we show that the loss of ER–mitochondria junctions induces an Aft1p-dependent iron deficiency response, leading to iron accumulation in the cell and mitochondria. Genetic disruption of the iron regulatory system exacerbated the respiration defect by ERMES deficiency. Furthermore, a dominant mutation in Vps13p suppressed the iron deficiency response and the iron accumulation phenotype of the ERMES mutants. Our findings indicate that ER–mitochondrial junctions are required for proper iron usage by the cell, expanding the functional repertoire of this important protein complex. We first performed genome-wide gene expression analysis using mRNA sequencing in the wild-type (WT) and ERMES subunit deletion mmm1Δ and mdm34Δ strains. To determine whether loss of ERMES induces the iron deficiency response, we examined the genes that comprise the iron regulon including the master transcription factors Aft1p and Aft2p, siderophore–iron transporters Aft1 regulon 1 and 2 and FITs, ferric reductases, and high-affinity iron transporters. The iron regulon genes are up-regulated in mmm1Δ and mdm34Δ strains compared with WT, which is similar to when WT cells are grown in iron-poor medium through treatment of cells with bathophenanthroline disulfonate (BPS), a strong iron chelator (Fig. 1B). Analysis of all the iron homeostasis genes annotated in the Saccharomyces Genome Database (n = 28 genes) revealed that the median expression level of iron homeostasis genes is significantly higher in mmm1Δ and mdm34Δ strains as well as in BPS-treated WT cell compared with WT cells grown in rich medium (Fig. 1, C and D). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the up-regulated genes in both mmm1Δ and mdm34Δ strains confirmed significant enrichment for iron transport-related genes (Fig. 1E), which is similar to the enrichment of GO terms of the induced genes with BPS treatment (data not shown). The transcriptional response to iron deficiency also involves activation of genes such as CTH2, which is involved in mediating the metabolic acclimation to iron deficiency by sparing iron use, and genes involved in iron-independent pathways such as glutamate dehydrogenase GDH3 (30.Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J.

Cooperation of two mRNA-binding proteins drives metabolic adaptation to iron deficiency.Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These genes are up-regulated in both mmm1Δ and mdm34Δ strains as well as in BPS-treated WT cells (Fig. 1F). The iron deficiency response also involves the repression of iron-dependent pathways including especially abundant iron–sulfur-containing proteins such as glutamate synthase GLT1, isopropylmalate isomerase LEU1, biotin synthase BIO2, and electron transport chain genes such as succinate dehydrogenases to spare iron. These genes are also down-regulated in mmm1Δ and mdm34Δ strains as well as in BPS-treated WT cells (Fig. 1F). GO analysis of the co-down-regulated genes in mmm1Δ and mdm34Δ strains revealed enrichment in electron transport chain genes (Fig. 1G), which is similar to WT cells grown in iron-depleted condition, but also significant enrichment in genes that function in protein translation (Fig. 1G). To determine whether the iron deficiency response in ERMES mutants causes iron accumulation, we collected cells in the log phase of growth and divided the same batch of cells to measure the total cellular and mitochondrial iron levels in WT, mmm1Δ, mdm34Δ, and yfh1Δ as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 1H, iron is significantly accumulated in the mmm1Δ and mdm34Δ with ∼3–4-fold more intracellular iron than WT. The yfh1Δ strain also contained more intracellular iron as expected. However, unlike the yfh1Δ strain that preferentially accumulates iron in the mitochondria, we did not find preferential accumulation of iron in mitochondria isolated from mmm1Δ and mdm34Δ (Fig. 1I). Thus, iron accumulates equally in the cell and the mitochondria of ERMES mutants, distinguishing them from the yfh1Δ strain. Iron accumulation in the ERMES mutants is dependent on the high-affinity iron uptake system because deleting FET3, which encodes an oxidoreductase required for high-affinity iron uptake, in mmm1Δ (mmm1Δfet3Δ) prevented the accumulation of iron (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, whereas mmm1Δ has a longer doubling time compared with WT, inhibition of iron uptake in mmm1Δ by deletion of FET3 (mmm1Δfet3Δ) exacerbates the growth defect (Fig. 2B). This suggests that ERMES mutants induce the iron deficiency response likely due to an inability to fully utilize intracellular iron and depend on the extra iron to meet their demands. Taken together, our transcriptome and iron measurement analyses indicate that when cells lose the junctions between ER and mitochondria the iron deficiency response is induced, causing intracellular iron overload. The ERMES mutants have defects in mtDNA maintenance and cannot grow in non-fermentative conditions (6.Berger K.H. Sogo L.F. Yaffe M.P.

Because iron deficiency causes diminished respiration (34.Shakoury-Elizeh M. Protchenko O. Berger A. Cox J. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Prinz W.A. Bard M. Philpott C.C. Metabolic response to iron deficiency in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14823-14833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether the role of ERMES in maintaining iron homeostasis complements the iron regulon to ensure proper cellular respiration. We replaced the promoter of MMM1 with the GAL1 promoter (pGAL-MMM1) to enable inducible MMM1 expression and analysis of genetic interactions. Growth in the presence of glucose, which represses the expression of MMM1, resulted in a slight growth defect. As expected, pGAL-MMM1 cells showed a respiratory defect when grown on non-fermentable carbon sources such as ethanol and glycerol (YPEG), which repress MMM1 expression (Fig. 3A). Longer incubation on YPEG (3 days) allows for growth of pGAL-MMM1 cells likely due to leaky expression of MMM1. Importantly, deletion of ATX1, a cytosolic copper chaperone that is required for effective iron uptake (35.Lin S.J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. A role for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATX1 gene in copper trafficking and iron transport.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 36.Cankorur-Cetinkaya A. Eraslan S. Kirdar B. Transcriptomic response of yeast cells to ATX1 deletion under different copper levels.BMC Genomics. 2016; 17: 489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), causes a moderate respiratory defect. However, the respiratory defect is much more severe when atx1Δ is combined with MMM1 shutoff (Fig. 3A). Thus, the impairments of ERMES and iron uptake exhibit a synthetic growth defect on non-fermentable carbon sources. This is even the case when iron distribution inside the cell is disrupted. When we combined shutoff of MMM1 with constitutive overexpression of a mitochondrial iron transporter, mitochondrial RNA splicing 3 (Mrs3p), which significantly increased cellular and mitochondrial iron content (supplemental Fig. S1A), or the vacuolar iron importer Ccc1p by replacing their promoters with the high-expressing glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase isozyme 3 (TDH3) promoter (37.Bitter G.A. Egan K.M. Expression of heterologous genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae from vectors utilizing the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter.Gene. 1984; 32: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the respiratory defect of the double mutants was much more severe than MMM1 shutoff alone (Fig. 3B). However, deletions of MRS3, MRS4, or both mitochondrial iron transporters had no effect on the respiratory deficiency of the MMM1 shutoff strain (supplemental Fig. S1B). Altogether, these findings further confirm that ERMES and a working iron uptake and distribution system function complementarily to ensure optimal respiratory growth. We next reasoned that further increases in intracellular iron levels may rescue the respiratory defect of the MMM1 shutoff strain. We therefore engineered a strain harboring a constitutively active Aft1 (Aft1-1up) by introducing a previously described mutation, aft1-C291F (26.Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. AFT1: a mediator of iron regulated transcriptional control in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, strains carrying the Aft1-1up allele also exacerbated the respiration defect in MMM1 shutoff (Fig. 3C). Altogether, these data suggest that disruption of ERMES causes a defect in intracellular iron usage that extends beyond simply the levels of iron. Too little or too much iron, both of which can be problematic (see “Discussion”), have adverse effects when the function of ERMES is impaired. Dominant mutations in VPS13 suppress the phenotypic consequences of ERMES deficiency including respiration defects, although the mechanism of suppression is unknown (18.Lang A.B. John Peter A.T. Walter P. Kornmann B. ER-mitochondrial junctions can be bypassed by dominant mutations in the endosomal protein Vps13.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 210: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To determine whether a VPS13 dominant mutation (vps13-D716H) can also suppress the iron deficiency response and iron accumulation in ERMES mutants, we deleted the MMM1 gene in a vps13-D716H strain and determined gene expression and intracellular iron levels. As shown in Fig. 4A, the vps13-D716H point mutation suppressed the growth defect of mmm1Δ on both YPD (glycolytic) and YPEG (respiratory) plates. Global gene expression analysis in medium with glucose revealed that the median expression of iron regulon genes, which were up-regulated in mmm1Δ, was lower in vps13-D716H mmm1Δ double mutants (Fig. 4B). However, the vps13-D716H mmm1Δ does not fully restore the expression of certain iron uptake genes such as FIT2 and FIT3 to levels observed in WT or vps13-D716H itself (Fig. 4C). More interestingly, the genes required for respiration have higher expression in vps133-D716H mmm1Δ compared wi"

Here, we compared hunting and meat-eating behaviour in two adjacent chimpanzee communities (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) of Budongo Forest, Uganda: the Waibira and Sonso communities. We observed consistent between-group differences in prey-species preferences and in post-hunting behaviour. Sonso chimpanzees show a strong prey preference for Guereza colobus monkeys (Colobus guereza occidentalis; 74.9% hunts), and hunt regularly (1-2 times a month) but with large year-to-year and month-to-month variation. Waibira chimpanzee prey preferences are distributed across primate and duiker species, and resemble those described in an early study of Sonso hunting. Waibira chimpanzees (which include ex-Sonso immigrants) have been observed to feed on red duiker (Cephalophus natalensis; 25%, 9/36 hunts), a species Sonso has never been recorded to feed on (18 years data, 27 years observations), despite no apparent differences in prey distribution; and show less rank-related harassment of meat possessors. We discuss the two most likely and probably interrelated explanations for the observed intergroup variation in chimpanzee hunting behaviour, that is, long-term disruption of complex group-level behaviour due to human presence and possible socially transmitted differences in prey preferences."

The aim of this study was to compare, sCD163 and sCD14 levels in HCV-infected patients undergoing direct acting antiviral (DAA)-containing regimens with or without interferon (IFN).sCD163, sCD14 and CXCL10 were longitudinally measured by ELISA in 159 plasma samples from 25 HCV-infected patients undergoing IFN-based treatment plus telaprevir or boceprevir and 28 HCV infected subjects treated with DAA IFN-free regimens. Twenty-five healthy donors (HD) were included as controls.At baseline CXCL10, sCD163 and sCD14 levels were higher in HCV-infected patients than in HD. CXCL10 and sCD163 levels were significantly decreased in responder (R) patients who achieved sustained virological response (SVR), with both IFN-based and IFN-free regimens, while they were persistently elevated in non-responders (NR) patients who stopped IFN-based treatments because of failure or adverse events. Conversely, sCD14 levels were apparently unchanged during therapy, but at the end of treatment the levels reached normal ranges. Comparing the two regimens, the extent of CXCL10 reduction was more pronounced in patients undergoing DAA IFN-free therapies, whereas sCD163 and sCD14 reduction was similar in the two groups. Interestingly, only in IFN-based regimens baseline sCD163 levels were significantly higher in NR than in R patients, while in the IFN-free treatment group also patients with high sCD163 plasma levels obtained SVR. At the end of therapy, even if the biomarkers were largely decreased, their levels remained significantly higher compared to HD. Only in the early fibrosis stages, sCD163 values tended to normalize.These results indicate that IFN-free regimens including newer DAA induce an early and marked decrease in circulating inflammatory biomarkers. However, the full normalization of biomarkers was not obtained, especially in patients with advanced fibrosis, thus underlying the need for a treatment in the early stages of HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2658409203,"Although several studies have documented challenges related to inadequate adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and high loss to follow-up (LTFU) among Option B+ women, there is limited understanding of why these challenges occur and how to address them. This qualitative study examines women’s experiences with ART adherence and retention in care. Between July and October 2015, in-depth interviews were conducted with 39 pregnant and lactating women who initiated ART at Bwaila Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi. Study participants included 14 in care and 25 out of care women, according to facility records. Data were analyzed using an inductive, open-coding approach to thematic analysis. Ten of the respondents (7 out of care, 3 in-care) had stopped and re-started treatment before the interview date. One of the most important factors influencing adherence and retention was the strength of women’s support systems. In contrast to women in-care, most out-of-care women lacked emotional and financial support from male partners, received minimal counseling from providers at initiation, lacked designated guardians to assist with medication refills or clinic appointments, and were highly mobile. Mobility led to difficulties in accessing treatment in new settings. The most common reasons women re-started treatment following interruptions were due to providers’ counseling and encouragement and the mother’s desire to be healthy. Improved counseling at initiation, active follow-up counseling, women’s economic empowerment interventions, promotion of peer counseling schemes and meaningful engagement of male partners can help in addressing the identified barriers and promoting sustained retention of Option B+ women."

Methods Consecutive patients from the Groningen Leeuwarden AS (GLAS) cohort starting TNF-α inhibitors with spinal radiographs at least available at baseline and 6 years of follow-up were included. Radiographs were scored using mSASSS by two independent readers. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to explore the associations between baseline characteristics and spinal radiographic progression. The course of radiographic progression in patients with and without risk factors for poor radiographic outcome was investigated using different time models (linear and non-linear). Single linear imputation was used in case of missing radiographic data at the intermediate (2 or 4 years) follow-up visits. Results 80 AS patients were included with mean baseline mSASSS 8.7±13.3. Baseline syndesmophytes, male gender, older age, longer symptom duration, smoking, and higher BMI were significantly associated with more radiographic damage over time. GEE analysis in patients with these risk factors revealed that radiographic progression followed a non-linear course with mean mSASSS progression rates reducing from max. 2.8 units over 0–2 years to min. 0.9 units over 4–6 years. The GEE model revealed a linear course with overall very low progression (≤1 mSASSS units/2yrs) in patients without risk factors. Complete case analysis in 53 patients showed similar results. Conclusion AS patients at risk of poor radiographic outcome showed the highest but diminishing spinal radiographic progression during long-term treatment with TNF-α inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W2639434630,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) regulates various physiological processes, including neuronal activity, vascular tone, inflammation, and energy metabolism. Moreover, H2S elicits cytoprotective effects against stressors in various cellular models of injury. However, the mechanism of the signaling pathways mediating the cytoprotective functions of H2S is not well understood. We previously uncovered a heme-dependent metabolic switch for transient induction of H2S production in the trans-sulfuration pathway. Here, we demonstrate that increased endogenous H2S production or its exogenous administration modulates major components of the integrated stress response promoting a metabolic state primed for stress response. We show that H2S transiently increases phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) resulting in inhibition of general protein synthesis. The H2S-induced increase in eIF2α phosphorylation was mediated at least in part by inhibition of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1c) via persulfidation at Cys-127. Overexpression of a PP1c cysteine mutant (C127S-PP1c) abrogated the H2S effect on eIF2α phosphorylation. Our data support a model in which H2S exerts its cytoprotective effect on ISR signaling by inducing a transient adaptive reprogramming of global mRNA translation. Although a transient increase in endogenous H2S production provides cytoprotection, its chronic increase such as in cystathionine β-synthase deficiency may pose a problem."

However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the increased ERBB2 expression in the TAMR cells remain poorly understood. Herein, we reported that the ERBB2 expression is regulated at the post-transcriptional level by miR26a/b and the RNA-binding protein human antigen R (HuR), both of which associate with the 3′-UTR of the ERBB2 transcripts. We demonstrated that miR26a/b inhibits the translation of ERBB2 mRNA, whereas HuR enhances the stability of the ERBB2 mRNA. In TAMR ER+ breast cancer cells with elevated ERBB2 expression, we observed a decrease in the level of miR26a/b and an increase in the level of HuR.

However, the underlying mechanisms leading to increased expression of ERBB2 in TAMR breast cancer remain poorly understood. The post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression involves the regulation of mRNA stability and translation by non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), and RNA-binding proteins (18.Filipowicz W. Bhattacharyya S.N. Sonenberg N. Mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs: are the answers in sight?.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (4152) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence has established the importance of miRNAs in the initiation, promotion, and progression of various human cancers (19.Esquela-Kerscher A. Slack F.J.

The dysregulation of miRNAs has been demonstrated to contribute to breast cancer development and progression through promoting cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis (5.Osborne C.K. Schiff R.

In particular, several studies have reported the down-regulation of miR-26a and/or miR-26b in breast cancer, thus implicating them as tumor suppressor miRNAs (21.Liu X.X. Li X.J. Zhang B. Liang Y.J.

Human antigen R (HuR) is an RNA-binding protein that belongs to the Hu/ELAV family (29.Kotta-Loizou I. Vasilopoulos S.N. Coutts R.H. Theocharis S. Current evidence and future perspectives on HuR and breast cancer development, prognosis, and treatment.Neoplasia. 2016; 18: 674-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It selectively binds to AU-rich regions in the 3′-UTR of mRNAs and serves to increase the stability of the transcripts (30.Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. HuR and mRNA stability.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence has supported the critical roles of HuR in breast cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and drug resistance through its modulation of the stability of relevant transcripts (29.Kotta-Loizou I. Vasilopoulos S.N. Coutts R.H. Theocharis S. Current evidence and future perspectives on HuR and breast cancer development, prognosis, and treatment.Neoplasia. 2016; 18: 674-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Importantly, the elevated expression of HuR has been reported to contribute to tamoxifen resistance (31.Hostetter C. Licata L.A. Witkiewicz A. Costantino C.L. Yeo C.J. Brody J.R. Keen J.C.

In addition, alternative polyadenylation (APA) of the mRNA 3′-UTR also plays an important role in post-transcriptional regulation (33.Mayr C. Bartel D.P. Widespread shortening of 3′UTRs by alternative cleavage and polyadenylation activates oncogenes in cancer cells.Cell. 2009; 138: 673-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Approximately 70% of human genes are characterized by multiple poly(A) sites that produce distinct transcript isoforms with variable 3′-UTR (34.Di Giammartino D.C. Nishida K. Manley J.L.

Herein, we report that ERBB2 is post-transcriptionally up-regulated in TAMR breast cancer cells, which is attributable to the decreased expression of miR-26a/b and increased expression of HuR. Forced expression of miR-26a/b and/or depletion of HuR, which decreased ERBB2 expression, enhanced the response of the TAMR breast cancer cells to tamoxifen. We further elucidated a novel mechanism leading to up-regulated HuR expression in TAMR breast cancer cells, in which higher levels of CSTF2 mediate increased production of an HuR mRNA isoform with a shorter 3′-UTR through APA, thus resulting in higher HuR protein expression. ER+ breast cancer cells (MCF7 and T47D) with acquired tamoxifen resistance were generated by chronic treatment with tamoxifen (Fig. 1A) (41.Jin K. Park S. Teo W.W. Korangath P. Cho S.S. Yoshida T.

These TAMR cells exhibited elevated ERBB2 protein (Fig. 1B) and mRNA levels (Fig. 1C), which is consistent with existing literature implicating increased ERBB2 expression and the ERBB2–ERα cross-talk as a key mechanism in driving tamoxifen resistance in ER+ breast cancer (3.Ring A.

Teo W.W. Korangath P. Cho S.S. Yoshida T. Győrffy B. Goswami C.P. Nakshatri H. Cruz L.A. Zhou W. Ji H. Su Y. Ekram M. Wu Z. et al.HOXB7 Is an ERα cofactor in the activation of HER2 and multiple ER target genes leading to endocrine resistance.Cancer Discov. 2015; 5: 944-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine whether the increased expression of ERBB2 in TAMR breast cancer also occurs in a post-transcriptional manner, we analyzed the ERBB2 3′-UTR–driven luciferase reporter gene activities in the control and TAMR MCF7 and T47D cells. The full-length 3′-UTR of ERBB2 was cloned downstream of the Renilla luciferase gene in the psiCHECK2 vector, and the resulting luciferase reporter constructs were transfected into the cells. The TAMR MCF7 and T47D cells exhibited increased ERBB2 3′-UTR–driven luciferase reporter gene activities as compared with the respective control cells (Fig. 1D). Hence, post-transcriptional regulation at the ERBB2 3′-UTR results in increased ERBB2 expression in TAMR ER+ breast cancer cells. We went on to determine whether ERBB2 is regulated post-transcriptionally by miRNAs targeting its 3′-UTR. We have previously demonstrated that miR-26a and miR-26b are repressed by estrogen, leading to increased estrogen-stimulated cell proliferation in ERα+ breast cancer cells (25.Tan S. Ding K. Li R. Zhang W. Li G. Kong X. Qian P. Lobie P.E. Zhu T. Identification of miR-26 as a key mediator of estrogen stimulated cell proliferation by targeting CHD1, GREB1 and KPNA2.Breast Cancer Res. 2014; 16: R40Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, low levels of miR-26 have previously been reported to be associated with tamoxifen resistance (45.Egeland N.G. Lunde S. Jonsdottir K. Lende T.H. Cronin-Fenton D. Gilje B. Janssen E.A. Søiland H. The role of microRNAs as predictors of response to tamoxifen treatment in breast cancer patients.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015; 16: 24243-24275Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In our MCF7/TAMR and T47D/TAMR cells, the levels of miR-26a/b were significantly decreased as compared with their respective control cells (Fig. 2A). The forced expression of miR-26a/b decreased ERBB2 protein levels in MCF7/TAMR and T47D/TAMR cells (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the forced expression of miR-26a/b in the TAMR cells decreased the protein levels of enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which is a validated target of miR-26 (46.Wong C.F. Tellam R.L. MicroRNA-26a targets the histone methyltransferase Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 during myogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9836-9843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and was thus chosen as a positive control (Fig. 2B). Despite the observed miR-26a/b-mediated decrease in ERBB2 protein levels, the forced expression of miR-26a/b did not significantly decrease ERBB2 mRNA levels in MCF7/TAMR and T47D/TAMR cells (supplemental Fig. S1A). This suggests that ERBB2 expression is down-regulated post-transcriptionally by miR-26a/b. To determine whether ERBB2 mRNA is a direct target of miR-26a/b, we first performed bioinformatics analysis. A putative miR-26 binding site in the 3′-UTR of the ERBB2 transcript was predicted by RNAhybrid (47.Krüger J. Rehmsmeier M. RNAhybrid: microRNA target prediction easy, fast and flexible.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W451-W454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). To further study whether miR-26a/b regulates ERBB2 expression through this predicted miR-26a/b binding site in the ERBB2 3′-UTR, we introduced mutations into this site (Fig. 2C) and compared the luciferase reporter activities controlled by either the wild-type or mutant ERBB2 3′-UTR in the presence of miR-26a/b. The forced expression of miR-26a/b markedly reduced the activity of the luciferase reporter gene fused to wild-type ERBB2 3′-UTR by >50% but did not affect the luciferase reporter activity when the predicted miR-26a/b target site in the ERBB2 3′-UTR was mutated (Fig. 2D). In addition, to verify the direct interaction of miR-26 and ERBB2 mRNA, we performed an RNA pulldown assay using biotin-labeled miR-26a or miR-26b (Fig. 2E). ERBB2 and EZH2 (positive control) mRNAs were both markedly enriched in the pulldown fractions of biotin–miR-26a or biotin–miR-26b, but not in the pulldown fraction of control scrambled miRNA (Fig. 2F). The association of biotinylated miR-26a/b with the ERBB2 and EZH2 mRNAs was specific, because biotin–miR-26 did not result in the pulldown of nonspecific mRNAs encoding ARTEMIN and TFF1 (trefoil factor 1), which are not miR-26a/b targets (Fig. 2F). In addition, the levels of total ERBB2, EZH2, ARTEMIN, and TFF1 mRNAs were not altered with the transfection of biotinylated miR-26a/b or scrambled miRNA (Fig. 2G), suggesting that the enrichment of ERBB2 and EZH2 mRNAs in the biotinylated miR-26 pulldown assay was due to interaction of these mRNAs with miR-26 rather than an increase in the total levels of these mRNAs in the cells. These data collectively suggest that miR-26a/b acting at the 3′-UTR of ERBB2, reduces ERBB2 expression principally by inhibiting its translation. Interestingly, upon transfection of anti-miR-26a/b (antisense oligonucleotides) into MCF7 cells, the ERBB2 protein level was only slightly increased as compared with a dramatically increased EZH2 protein level (supplemental Fig. S1B). Hence, the reduction in miR-26a/b levels is probably not the only mechanism responsible for the elevated ERBB2 expression in TAMR breast cancer cells. HuR was previously shown to associate with ERBB2 3′-UTR and increase ERBB2 transcript stability (14.Mehta A. Trotta C.R. Peltz S.W.

We also evaluated procedure-related major and minor complications.Technical success was achieved in 291 (97.3%) fiducial marker implantations. The mean distance between the tumor and the marker was 3.1 cm (S.D., 2.1 cm; range, 0-9.5 cm). Of 101 patients, 72 lesions (71.3%, 2.2 ± 1.0 cm; range, 0-3.0 cm) had fiducial markers located in an ideal location. The ideal location of fiducials was more common in visible lesions than in poorly conspicuous lesions (90.2% vs. 52.0%, P < 0.001). Seventeen markers (5.8%) developed beam-hardening artifacts obscuring the tumor margins. There were no major complications, although 12 patients (11.9%) developed minor complications.US-guided implantation of fiducial markers in the liver is an effective and safe procedure with only rare complications."

Methods We analyzed data from 300 mothers whose neighbor participated in a nutrition BCC intervention and 600 mothers whose neighbor participated in an intervention that did not include BCC. We constructed measures capturing mothers’ knowledge of infant and young child nutrition (IYCN) and measures of food consumption by children 6-24m. The effect on these outcomes of exposure to a neighbor receiving a nutrition BCC intervention was estimated using ordinary least squares and probit regressions. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Study ID: NCT02237144). Results Having a neighboring mother participate in a nutrition BCC intervention increased non-participant mothers’ IYCN knowledge by 0.17 SD (translating to 0.3 more correct answers). They were 14.1 percentage points more likely to feed their 6-24m children legumes and nuts; 11.6 percentage points more likely to feed these children vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables; and 10.0 percentage points more likely to feed these children eggs. Children of non-participant mothers who had a neighboring mother participate in a nutrition BCC intervention were 13.8 percentage points more likely to meet World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for minimum diet diversity, 11.9 percentage points more likely to meet WHO guidelines for minimum acceptable diet, and 10.3 percentage points more likely to meet WHO guidelines for minimum meal frequency for children who continue to be breastfed after age 6m. Children aged 0-6m of non-participant mothers who are neighbors of mothers receiving BCC were 7.1 percentage points less likely to have ever consumed water-based liquids. Conclusions Studies of nutrition BCC that do not account for information spillovers to non-participants may underestimate its benefits in terms of IYCN knowledge and practice."

For example, constitutive p38 MAPK activation in cardiomyocytes induces pathological features, including myocyte hypertrophy, apoptosis, contractile dysfunction, and fetal gene expression. However, the physiological function of cardiomyocyte p38 MAPK activity in beneficial compensatory vascular remodeling is unclear. This report investigated the functional role and the underlying mechanisms of cardiomyocyte p38 MAPK activity in cardiac remodeling induced by chronic stress. Using both in vitro and in vivo model systems, we found that p38 MAPK activity is required for hypoxia-induced pro-angiogenic activity from cardiomyocytes and that p38 MAPK activation in cardiomyocyte is sufficient to promote paracrine signaling-mediated, pro-angiogenic activity. We further demonstrate that VEGF is a paracrine factor responsible for the p38 MAPK-mediated pro-angiogenic activity from cardiomyocytes and that p38 MAPK pathway activation is sufficient for inducing VEGF secretion from cardiomyocytes in an Sp1-dependent manner. More significantly, cardiomyocyte-specific inactivation of p38α in mouse heart impaired compensatory angiogenesis after pressure overload and promoted early onset of heart failure. In summary, p38αMAPK has a critical role in the cross-talk between cardiomyocytes and vasculature by regulating stress-induced VEGF expression and secretion in cardiomyocytes.

We conclude that as part of a stress-induced signaling pathway, p38 MAPK activity significantly contributes to both pathological and compensatory remodeling in the heart. In response to mechanical stress or loss of myocytes due to pathological injury, a network of stress-signaling pathways is activated in the myocardium, including stress-activated MAP kinase p38. In previous studies from both in vitro and in vivo, activated p38 MAPK activity in cardiomyocytes was shown to induce many aspects of pathological remodeling in heart, including hypertrophy, myocyte death, loss of contractility, interstitial fibrosis, fetal genes, and proinflammatory gene induction. Constitutive activation of the p38 pathway in mouse heart was associated with lethal cardiomyopathy, whereas inhibiting p38 MAPK activity attenuated myocardial injury to ischemia/reperfusion injury or ameliorated the onset of heart failure in experimental animals. These studies laid down the mechanistic foundation for a human clinic trial for ischemic heart failure by targeted inhibition of p38 kinase. However, p38 MAPK activity was also reported to be reduced in end-stage heart failure, and genetic inactivation of p38α in mouse heart actually accelerated the progression of heart failure under chronic stress. These observations seemingly contradict to the previous notion that the functional consequence of p38 MAPK activation in heart is largely pathological without a significant beneficial effect. It is known that both adaptive and maladaptive remodeling occur in stressed heart. In addition to interstitial fibrosis, fetal gene induction, and myocyte hypertrophy, changes in the coronary and capillary network of the heart is also a major part of the remodeling process. In the heart, adequate perfusion is required to maintain cardiac function. Therefore, cardiac vascular function is constantly regulated by cross-communication between myocytes and endothelium. As in other organs, the cardiac vascular function can be regulated in an acute fashion by vasoconstriction or vasodilation (1.Westerhof N. Boer C. Lamberts R.R. Sipkema P. Cross-talk between cardiac muscle and coronary vasculature.Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 1263-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) or more gradually through the growth of new vessels and angiogenesis under chronic conditions (2.Khurana R. Simons M. Martin J.F.

Furthermore, they have also shown that a reduction in capillary density plays a critical role in the transition from a compensated hypertrophy to a decompensated state of heart failure. Indeed, therapeutic angiogenesis in the heart has been the focus of a number of investigations with significant potential (2.Khurana R. Simons M. Martin J.F. Zachary I.C. Role of angiogenesis in cardiovascular disease: a critical appraisal.Circulation. 2005; 112: 1813-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis is a complex process that requires coordinated action from multiple cytokines secreted from both the surrounding tissues and the vascular cells themselves (7.Carmeliet P. Mechanisms of angiogenesis and arteriogenesis.Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar, 8.Semenza G.L. Vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and arteriogenesis: mechanisms of blood vessel formation and remodeling.J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 840-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These cytokines act in either a paracrine or autocrine manner upon endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and pericytes. Although the cytokines and their effect on vascular cells are well studied, the signaling pathways that promote angiogenic cytokine production for paracrine signaling, particularly in stressed cardiomyocytes, are not well understood. In this report we employed both in vitro and in vivo model systems to interrogate the function of p38α, the dominant isoform in mouse heart, in the context of stress response in heart. We found that p38 MAPK activation in cardiomyocytes was sufficient and necessary for the induction of a pro-angiogenic activity secreted from the stressed cardiomyocytes. We further demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was responsible for the pro-angiogenic paracrine activity induced by p38 MAPK in cardiomyocyte. VEGF was induced in stressed myocytes or intact hearts in a p38-dependent manner, and VEGF mRNA levels and its secretion was induced by p38 activation via Sp1 transcription factor in cardiomyocytes. Most relevantly, we found that the cardiomyocyte-specific inactivation of p38α led to a blunted angiogenesis after mechanical overload in intact heart associated with an accelerated progression to heart failure. Therefore, we have uncovered an unexpected beneficial role for the cardiomyocyte p38α activity in promoting cardiac angiogenesis by regulating VEGF induction in response to stress. This finding offers a mechanistic basis for the contradicting functions of stress signaling during cardiac remodeling and demonstrates a complex cell-cell communication network regulated by p38 MAPK pathway that has both beneficial and pathological consequences in a stressed heart. One of the most potent inducers of angiogenesis among different cell types is hypoxia. In neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVMs) 5The abbreviations used are: NRVMneonatal rat ventricular myocyteTACtransverse aortic constrictionCKOcardiac-specific knock-outPEphenylephrineVE-CADvascular endothelial cadherinDNdominant negativeAdvadenovirusbis-tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolPAEporcine aortic endothelialHUVEChuman microvascular endothelial cell. cultures (with >90% pure for cardiomyocytes; see Fig. 1, 4 h of hypoxia robustly induced p38 MAPK activation, as demonstrated by phospho-p38/total p38 (Fig. 2A). The conditioned media from the hypoxia-treated NRVMs promoted vascular tube formation compared to untreated cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, pretreatment with 2 μm SB202190, a p38 specific inhibitor in NRVMs, significantly reduced this hypoxia-induced pro-angiogenic activity (Fig. 2B). To test whether the p38 MAPK activity induced during hypoxia is sufficient to promote pro-angiogenic paracrine activity from myocytes, NRVMs were transfected with Adv-MKK3bE, an upstream kinase with specific activity for p38 MAPK without a significant impact on ERK or Akt activities (Fig. 3A) (9.Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross Jr., J. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. Cardiac muscle cell hypertrophy and apoptosis induced by distinct members of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase family.J. Biol.

The conditioned media from the p38-activated NRVMs were applied to porcine aortic endothelial cells to measure the pro-angiogenic ability as described (10.Lee S. Jilani S.M. Nikolova G.V. Carpizo D.

Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The conditioned media from the MKK3bE-expressing NRVMs had a potent pro-angiogenic activity (2.1-fold over control) similar to that observed from the hypoxia-treated NRVMs (Fig. 3, B and C). Co-expressing p38α dominant negative (DN) mutant in NRVMs significantly reduced MKK3b(E)-induced paracrine activity for endothelial cell growth (Fig. 3, B and C). These results suggest that cardiomyocyte p38α activity is both necessary and sufficient for stress-induced pro-angiogenic paracrine activity from cardiomyocytes.Figure 2p38 MAPK-mediated paracrine pro-angiogenic activity from cardiomyocytes.

To investigate the molecular basis of p38 MAPK-mediated pro-angiogenic paracrine activity in cardiomyocytes, we investigated the impact of p38 MAPK activation on pro-angiogenic factor VEGF in cardiomyocytes. As shown in Fig. 4A, activation of p38 MAPK led to a significant increase (3.9-fold) in VEGF mRNA levels in myocytes. The induction level was significantly reduced with the co-expression of p38α DN (Fig. 4A) or pretreatment with p38 inhibitor SB202190 (Fig. 4B). ERK and AKT are both implicated in VEFG regulation (11.Shiojima I. Walsh K. Regulation of cardiac growth and coronary angiogenesis by the Akt/PKB signaling pathway.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3347-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 12.Pagès G. Milanini J. Richard D.E.

However, co-expression of p38α DN with MKK3b(E) in NRVMs actually increased the basal phospho-Akt levels modestly (Fig. 3A) but reduced VEGF mRNA induction. Similarly, inhibiting ERK activity with U0126 did not significantly affect MKK3b(E)-induced VEGF expression (Fig. 4C). Therefore, specific activation of p38α is sufficient to induce VEGF mRNA levels in myocytes. Reflecting what was seen at the mRNA level, myocytes expressing MKK3b(E) showed an increase in total intracellular VEGF protein levels (Fig. 4D), whereas co-expressing with p38α DN reduced it. Finally, the conditioned media collected over a 24-h incubation period from the NRVMs treated with Adv-MKK3b(E) had significantly higher concentrations of VEGF than those from cells treated with Adv-LacZ (2.3-fold, 3.7-fold, and 4.8-fold at 48, 72, and 96 h post-infection, respectively) or Adv-p38α-DN (2.3-fold, 3.6-fold, and 2.5-fold at 48, 72, and 96 h post-infection, respectively) (Fig. 4E). Furthermore, co-expressing p38α DN and MKK3b(E) resulted in a significant decrease in VEGF induction in the conditioned media (23.2% and 23.9% reduction at 48 and 72 h post infection, respectively), and the same trend remained at the 96-h time point where the decrease (31.0%) had p = 0.084 (Fig. 4E). Because p38 activation in cardiomyocytes can lead to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (13.Hoshijima M. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Chien K.R. Brown J.H.

In contrast, phenylephrine (PE)-treated NRVMs showed significant hypertrophy in size and induction of ANF gene expression (Fig. 4, G–I) associated with sustained changes in MAP kinases and AKT signaling (Fig. 4, J and K). These results indicate that p38 MAPK activity in cardiomyocytes is both sufficient and necessary for VEGF expression and secretion. VEGF induction is not a direct consequence of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy but, rather, a specific downstream event of p38-mediated stress response.Figure 4p38 MAPK induced VEGF expression and secretion in cardiomyocytes.

PAE-VEGFR2 cells treated with media from MKK3b(E)-expressing myocytes showed a significant level of phospho-VEGFR2 compared with the other treatment groups (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, treatment of the NRVMs media with an anti-VEGF antibody before application in the in vitro angiogenesis assay blocked the pro-angiogenic effect significantly (decreased 62.4%, Fig. 5, B and C). This result indicates that VEGF induction is essential to p38 MAPK-mediated pro-angiogenic paracrine activity from cardiomyocytes. It is reported that SP1, HIF1α, siPGC1α, COX2, GATA4, and MEF2c are potential downstream targets of p38 MAPK, and SP-1, HIF-1α, COX-2, GATA-4, and MEF-2c are also implicated in VEGF regulation in different cell types. Using siRNAs specific for these genes, we tested their specific contribution to p38 MAPK-mediated VEGF induction in cardiomyocytes. As shown in Fig. 6, A–F, siRNA treatments specifically knocked down SP1 (79.5%), HIF1α (85.8%), PGC1α (62.5%), COX2 (69.7%), GATA4 (61.6%), and MEF2c (67.3%) expression when compared with samples treated with nonspecific siRNA in cultured NRVMs 24 h before infection with adenovirus. VEGF mRNA was measured 48 h after MKK3bE expression. As shown in Fig. 6G, knocking down SP1 reduced MKK3bE-mediated induction of VEGF expression, whereas knocking down other genes did not (Fig. 6, H–L). Although HIF1α knockdown resulted in a modest 12.6% decrease in VEGF expression, this change did not reach a significant level (p = 0.092). Therefore, p38-mediated VEGF induction is mediated at least in part by SP1-dependent transcription. To investigate the role p38α MAPK plays in myocyte-endothelial cell cross-talk in vivo, we examined whether or not the loss of p38α would affect the angiogenic response in the intact heart both at baseline and after pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Cardiac-specific knock-out (CKO) of p38α was accomplished by cardiac-specific cre/loxP-mediated recombination (15.Engel F.B. Schebesta M. Duong M.T. Lu G. Ren S. Madwed J.B. Jiang H. Wang Y.

Similar to what was reported earlier (16.Nishida K. Yamaguchi O. Hirotani S. Hikoso S. Higuchi Y. Watanabe T. Takeda T. Osuka S. Morita T. Kondoh G. Uno Y. Kashiwase K. Taniike M. Nakai A.

In agreement with earlier reports, we observed that p38α CKO hearts developed an accelerated progression to heart failure after TAC without a significant impact on hypertrophy (Fig. 8, A–C). As shown in Fig. 9, cross-sectional areas measured from WGA-stained sections showed no significant differences between p38α CKO and wild-type (WT) hearts 28 days after TAC (Fig. 9, A and B). We also measured the fibrotic area and found no significant difference between p38α CKO and WT hearts 28 days after TAC (Fig. 9, C and D). The capillary density in the myocardium showed no significant difference between p38α CKO and WT hearts at baseline (Fig. 10, A and B), and the observed ratio of capillary/myocyte in the ventricle was in good agreement with other studies (17.Hsieh P.C.

U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5780-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). After 28 days of TAC, capillary density in p38α WT controls was significantly increased by ∼2.5-fold. However, this increase was significantly blunted in the p38α CKO hearts (Fig. 10, A and B). Quantitative mRNA analysis showed vascular marker genes such as vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-CAD) and CD31 were significant induced the WT hearts, and this induction was also blunted in the p38α CKO hearts at 28 days post-TAC (Fig. 10C). However, at 28 days post-TAC, VEGF expression was also not induced in the p38α CKO heart after TAC (Fig. 10D). All these results suggest that loss of myocyte-specific p38α MAPK signaling blunts the chronic stress-induced angiogenic response in vivo. These data suggest that cardiomyocyte p38α activity has a beneficial role in compensatory vascular remodeling in heart.Figure 9Impact of p38α inactivation on cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis under pressure overload.

VEGF expression is induced through p38 MAPK/SP1 pathway in cardiomyocytes and is shown to be responsible for this pro-angiogenic paracrine activity. Loss of p38α activity from adult cardiomyocytes impairs stress-induced angiogenesis and vascular remodeling in intact heart, leading to accelerated heart failure after pressure overload. Therefore, all these data provide the first in vitro and in vivo evidence that a pathologically related stress-response pathway, p38 MAPK, also has an important beneficial role in compensatory vascular remodeling by mediating the cross-talk between cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells via a VEGF-dependent paracrine signaling mechanism. Previous studies in a number of cell types, including myocytes, have shown the importance of p38 MAPK signaling in inflammatory cytokine production. Our study provides direct evidence that the p38 MAPK pathway also plays a critical role in angiogenesis by inducing a potent paracrine factor VEGF from cardiomyocytes. This observation is consistent with similar observations in other cell types, including breast cancer cells (19.Isowa S. Shimo T. Ibaragi S. Kurio N. Okui T. Matsubara K. Hassan N.M. Kishimoto K.

Low dopamine levels and death of the dopaminergic neurons are hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD), where α-synuclein is also a key player. TH is highly regulated, notably by phosphorylation of several Ser/Thr residues in the N-terminal tail. However, the functional role of TH phosphorylation at the Ser-31 site (THSer(P)-31) remains unclear. Here, we report that THSer(P)-31 co-distributes with the Golgi complex and synaptic-like vesicles in rat and human dopaminergic cells. We also found that the TH microsomal fraction content decreases after inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and ERK1/2. The cellular distribution of an overexpressed phospho-null mutant, TH1-S31A, was restricted to the soma of neuroblastoma cells, with decreased association with the microsomal fraction, whereas a phospho-mimic mutant, TH1-S31E, was distributed throughout the soma and neurites. TH1-S31E associated with vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) and α-synuclein in neuroblastoma cells, and endogenous THSer(P)-31 was detected in VMAT2– and α-synuclein–immunoprecipitated mouse brain samples. Microtubule disruption or co-transfection with α-synuclein A53T, a PD-associated mutation, caused TH1-S31E accumulation in the cell soma. Our results indicate that Ser-31 phosphorylation may regulate TH subcellular localization by enabling its transport along microtubules, notably toward the projection terminals. These findings disclose a new mechanism of TH regulation by phosphorylation and reveal its interaction with key players in PD, opening up new research avenues for better understanding dopamine synthesis in physiological and pathological states.

A key enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamine neurotransmitters is tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which catalyzes the hydroxylation of l-tyrosine into l-DOPA (l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine), the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of dopamine (DA). DA is then pumped and loaded into vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) (9.Cartier E.A. Parra L.A. Baust T.B. Quiroz M. Salazar G. Faundez V. Egaña L. Torres G.E.

Rat TH is homologous to the TH1 human isoform, the most abundant isoform in humans together with TH2. TH activity is controlled by catecholamine feedback inhibition and phosphorylation of its N-terminal residues 8, 19, 31, and 40 (THSer(P)-8, THSer(P)-19, THSer(P)-31, and THSer(P)-40) by different kinases (12.Haycock J.W.

Chem. 2004; 279: 54487-54493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and it may increase TH activity regardless of THSer(P)-40 under depolarizing conditions (16.Harada K. Wu J. Haycock J.W. Goldstein M. Regulation of l-DOPA biosynthesis by site-specific phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase in AtT-20 cells expressing wild-type and serine 40-substituted enzyme.J.

In the terminal fields of the central nervous system, there is a greater DA and l-DOPA content, coinciding with greater THSer(P)-31 compared with somatodendritic compartments, whereas no consistent differences in THSer(P)-40 have been reported (23.Salvatore M.F. Pruett B.S.

Aging reveals a role for nigral tyrosine hydroxylase Ser31 phosphorylation in locomotor activity generation.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Under experimental PD conditions, THSer(P)-31 stoichiometry is decreased in the striatum but increased in the substantia nigra; this pattern is also shown by DA per remaining TH; however, total amounts of TH and of THSer(P)-40 decreased in both brain areas (27.Salvatore M.F. Ser31 tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation parallels differences in dopamine recovery in nigrostriatal pathway following 6-OHDA lesion.J. Neurochem. 2014; 129: 548-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, THSer(P)-31 may affect TH activity within the range of phosphorylation stoichiometries normally seen in the central nervous system and be independent of Ser-40 phosphorylation differences. Despite the body of results, the physiological role of Ser-31 phosphorylation is still not fully understood. TH is characterized as a largely soluble and cytoplasmic tetrameric protein; however, its physiological association with membranes (28.Kuczenski R.T. Mandell A.J. Regulatory properties of soluble and particulate rat brain tyrosine hydroxylase.J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3114-3122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has recently been proven to involve binding to partners, such as VMAT2 (9.Cartier E.A. Parra L.A. Baust T.B. Quiroz M.

In this work, we investigated the functional role of Ser-31 phosphorylation, and our results indicate the association of THSer(P)-31 with the GC and the vesicular transport pathway, through VMAT2 and α-synuclein (α-syn). α-Syn is a synaptic vesicle associated-protein and a culprit in the development of PD (30.Polymeropoulos M.H.

TH and α-syn are known to interact (31.Perez R.G. Waymire J.C. Lin E. Liu J.J. Guo F. Zigmond M.J. A role for α-synuclein in the regulation of dopamine biosynthesis.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3090-3099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the association of both proteins at synaptic vesicles and coordinated microtubular transport is presented here for the first time. Furthermore, our results position THSer(P)-31 at sites and processes disturbed in PD and other neurodegenerative disorders, such as loss of vesicle integrity, defective vesicle trafficking, and GC fragmentation, and may contribute to explain the early loss of striatal TH and DA that characterize PD (32.Obeso J.A.

The cellular distribution of the different phosphorylated forms of TH at Ser-19, Ser-31, and Ser-40 was investigated by immunofluorescence using specific antibodies. These antibodies have been used in previous studies (26.Salvatore M.F. Pruett B.S. Spann S.L. Dempsey C.

Western blots of HEK293 cell extracts expressing either recombinant human V5-TH1-WT or the corresponding phospho-null (Ser → Ala) and phospho-mimicking (Ser → Glu) mutations for Ser(P)-19, Ser(P)-31, and Ser(P)-40, show low reactivity for the corresponding Ser → Ala protein for the three antibodies (Fig. 1, A–C). THSer(P)-31 and THSer(P)-40 antibodies react both with the WT form (Fig. 1, B and C), phosphorylated at the corresponding site, and also with the phospho-mimicking mutants, whereas the THSer(P)-19 antibody only reacts with Ser-19–phosphorylated WT (Fig. 1A). In undifferentiated PC12Adh (from ATCC) cells permeabilized with Triton X-100, THSer(P)-19 showed a nuclear distribution, and THSer(P)-31 as well as THSer(P)-40 showed a cytosolic distribution (data not shown), consistent with recent results (34.Nakashima A.

To preserve TH interaction with partner proteins, we used saponin, a mild permeabilization agent, which allowed us to visualize THSer(P)-31 as punctate structures enriched in the perinuclear region, notably observed in the immense majority of PC12* cells (Fig. 1D).

This distribution was clearly distinct from total TH, THSer(P)-19, and THSer(P)-40 (Fig. 1E, top panels), and these signals were not affected by the R/S inhibition of Cdk5 and ERK1/2 (Fig. 1E, bottom panels). Moreover, in 45% of PC12Adh cells (n = 130) and 35% of iCell DopaNeurons (human dopaminergic pluripotent cells) (n = 50), the perinuclear enrichment was also observed (Fig. 1, F and G). Because stimulation with NGF increases THSer(P)-31 (24.Mitchell J.P. Hardie D.G. Vulliet P.R.

Interestingly, NGF treatment led to a punctate THSer(P)-31 signal throughout the cell soma and neurites of PC12* (Fig. 1H), similar to the distribution of THSer(P)-31 in PC12Adh and iCell DopaNeurons (Fig. 1, F and G). It is well established that PC12 can give rise to specific phenotypes as described previously in depth (39.Koike T. Takashima A.

Hardie D.G. Vulliet P.R. Site-specific phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase after KCl depolarization and nerve growth factor treatment of PC12 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22358-22364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). THSer(P)-31 signal in PC12* resembled a GC pattern, and its co-detection with the GC marker GM130 showed co-distribution in PC12Adh, iCell DopaNeurons, and PC12* cells (Fig. 2, A–C). Moreover, disassembly of the GC with brefeldin A abolished the THSer(P)-31 signal (Fig. 2C). To further investigate the punctate signal, we co-detected THSer(P)-31 and synaptic-like vesicle marker synaptotagmin I (sytI), which showed a certain signal overlapping in NGF-stimulated and unstimulated PC12Adh (Fig. 2D). Similarly, THSer(P)-31 in iCell DopaNeurons also co-distributed with sytI (Fig. 2E). Notably, fluorescence signals of immunolabeled VMAT2 and THSer(P)-31 highly overlapped in iCell DopaNeurons (Fig. 2E). Our results thus indicate that THSer(P)-31 associates with synaptic-like vesicles in rat PC12Adh cells and in a human dopaminergic neuronal model. To determine whether the association of TH to vesicles is dependent on phosphorylation at Ser-31, we treated cell cultures with Cdk5 and ERK1/2 kinase inhibitors (combined roscovitine and SL327 treatment) and isolated the microsomal fractions (enriched in endoplasmic reticulum, GC, endosomes, and vesicles among other membranous cellular structures). We compared total TH levels of treated versus untreated cells to determine whether inhibition of phosphorylation at Ser-31 caused a decrease in the amount of total TH present in the microsomal fraction. Our results show that the treatment led to a large decrease of total TH in the microsomal fractions of PC12* (Fig. 3A), suggesting that phosphorylation at Ser-31 is needed for TH to associate with vesicles. Actually, a strong decrease of the signal from THSer(P)-31 was also observed in the microsomal fraction (Fig. 3A) in agreement with Ref. 25.Moy L.Y. Tsai L.H. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 phosphorylates serine 31 of tyrosine hydroxylase and regulates its stability.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54487-54493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar and confirming that the treatment led to the inhibition of phosphorylation at Ser-31. However, to rule out the possibility that the decreased observed was due an impairment of vesicle biogenesis caused by the kinase inhibition, we tested the effect of the treatment on different microsomal markers. Specifically, we treated PC12Adh cells with or without roscovitine and SL327 and detected GC marker (GM130), endoplasmic reticulum marker (SPC25), endosome markers (clathrin and transferrin receptor), and dopamine-containing vesicle marker (VMAT2). The treatment did not lead to decreases in the signal of any of these markers (Fig. 3B). To further confirm the role of THSer(P)-31 in this vesicle association, we performed Western blotting of cell fraction of neuroblastoma cells expressing V5-TH1-S31A and V5-TH1-S31E, which showed that V5-TH1-S31A was decreased in the microsomal fraction by 20% when compared with the wild type, whereas V5-TH1-S31E was increased by 20% (Fig. 3C). To rule out possible artifacts, we also treated V5-TH1-S31E–transfected cells with the kinase inhibitors, and then we compared the amounts of V5-TH1-S31E in the microsomal fractions, without finding significant differences (Fig. 3D). These results reinforce the specificity of the Ser-31 phosphorylation for TH vesicle association. However, compared with the large effect of the chemical inhibition of Ser-31 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A), the effect of the phospho-null mutation was less pronounced. This may be explained by hetero-oligomerization of recombinant and endogenous monomers, as has been shown in other cases (42.Alvarez D. Callejo M. Shoucri R. Boyer L. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Analysis of the cruciform binding activity of recombinant 14-3-3ζ-MBP fusion protein, its heterodimerization profile with endogenous 14-3-3 isoforms, and effect on mammalian DNA replication in vitro.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7205-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 43.van Rijn R.M.

Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 604-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which would lead to a vesicular interaction of oligomers formed of phospho-null and THSer(P)-31 subunits. The phospho-variant data are consistent with the results from the chemical inhibition of Cdk5 and ERK1/2 and rule out the possibility that the observed effect would be due to either nonspecific effects of Cdk5 and ERK1/2 on other proteins directly or indirectly involved in THSer(P)-31 association with vesicles. Again, these results show that TH needs to be phosphorylated at Ser-31 to bind to vesicles. Because TH is able to interact with negatively charged membranes (44.Halskau Jr., Ø. Ying M. Baumann A. Kleppe R. Rodriguez-Larrea D. Almås B. Haavik J. Martinez A. Three-way interaction between 14-3-3 proteins, the N-terminal region of tyrosine hydroxylase, and negatively charged membranes.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32758-32769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we investigated whether phosphorylation at Ser-31 enhances this association. To study the binding of TH to membranes, we used chromaffin vesicle membranes that had been previously trypsinized to remove any proteins that could be potential partners. Surface plasmon resonance studies using purified recombinant, non-phosphorylated human TH1 showed a certain degree of interaction with membranes (Fig. 4A), as expected (44.Halskau Jr., Ø. Ying M. Bauman"

Developing new malaria diagnostic tools that are sensitive enough to detect low-level infections, user friendly, cost effective and capable of performing large scale diagnosis, remains critical. We have designed novel self-quenching photo-induced electron transfer (PET) fluorogenic primers for the detection of P. ovale by real-time PCR. In our study, a total of 173 clinical samples, consisting of different malaria species, were utilized to test this novel PET-PCR primer. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated using nested-PCR as the reference test. The novel primer set demonstrated a sensitivity of 97.5% and a specificity of 99.2% (95% CI 85.2–99.8% and 95.2–99.9% respectively). Furthermore, the limit of detection for P. ovale was found to be 1 parasite/μl. The PET-PCR assay is a new molecular diagnostic tool with comparable performance to other commonly used PCR methods. It is relatively easy to perform, and amiable to large scale malaria surveillance studies and malaria control and elimination programs. Further field validation of this novel primer will be helpful to ascertain the utility for large scale malaria screening programs."
https://openalex.org/W2677142372,"Cordyceps sensu lato is a genus of arthropod-pathogenic fungi, which have been used traditionally as medicinal in Asia. Within the genus, Ophiocordyceps sinensis is the most coveted and expensive species in China. Nevertheless, harvesting wild specimens has become a challenge given that natural populations of the fungus are decreasing and because large-scale culture of it has not yet been achieved. The worldwide demand for products derived from cultivable fungal species with medicinal properties has increased recently. In this study, we propose a new species, Cordyceps nidus, which parasitizes underground nests of trapdoor spiders. This species is phylogenetically related to Cordyceps militaris, Cordyceps pruinosa, and a sibling species of Cordyceps caloceroides. It is found in tropical rainforests from Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador. We also investigated the medicinal potential of this fungus based on its biochemical properties when grown on four different culture media. The metabolic profile particularly that of nucleosides, in polar and non-polar extracts was determined by UPLC, and then correlated to their antimicrobial activity and total phenolic content. The metabolome showed a high and significant dependency on the substrate used for fungal growth. The mass intensities of nucleosides and derivative compounds were higher in natural culture media in comparison to artificial culture media. Among these compounds, cordycepin was the predominant, showing the potential use of this species as an alternative to O. sinensis. Furthermore, methanol fractions showed antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria, and less than 3.00 mg of gallic acid equivalents per g of dried extract were obtained when assessing its total phenolic content by modified Folin-Ciocalteu method. The presence of polyphenols opens the possibility of further exploring the antioxidant capacity and the conditions that may enhance this characteristic. The metabolic composition and biochemical activity indicate potential use of C. nidus in pharmaceutical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2690315019,"The β-secretase (BACE1) initiates processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into Aβ peptides, which have been implicated as central players in the pathology of Alzheimer disease. BACE1 has been described as a copper-binding protein and its oligomeric state as being monomeric, dimeric, and/or multimeric, but the native cellular stoichiometry has remained elusive. Here, by using single-molecule fluorescence and in vitro cross-linking experiments with photo-activatable unnatural amino acids, we show that full-length BACE1, independently of its subcellular localization, exists as trimers in human cells. We found that trimerization requires the BACE1 transmembrane sequences (TMSs) and cytoplasmic domains, with residues Ala463 and Cys466 buried within the trimer interface of the sulfur-rich core of the TMSs. Our 3D model predicts that the sulfur-rich core of the trimeric BACE1 TMS is accessible to metal ions, but copper ions did not trigger trimerization. The results of functional assays of endogenous BACE1 suggest that it has a role in intracellular copper compartmentalization by transferring cytosolic copper to intracellular compartments, while leaving the overall cellular copper concentration unaltered. Adding to existing physiological models, our results provide novel insight into the atypical interactions between copper and BACE1 and into its non-enzymatic activities. In conclusion, therapeutic Alzheimer disease prevention strategies aimed at decreasing BACE1 protein levels should be regarded with caution, because adverse effects in copper homeostasis may occur."

We argue that this process could be supported and hastened using data collected via online social networks. In this work we investigate the relationships between the online traces left behind by users of a large US online food community and the prevalence of obesity in 47 states and 311 counties in the US. Using data associated with the recipes bookmarked over an 9-year period by 144,839 users of the Allrecipes.com food website residing throughout the US, several hierarchical regression models are created to (i) shed light on these relations and (ii) establish their magnitude. The results of our analysis provide strong evidence that bookmarking activities on recipes in online food communities can provide a signal allowing food and health related issues, such as obesity to be better understood and monitored. We discover that higher fat and sugar content in bookmarked recipes is associated with higher rates of obesity. The dataset is complicated, but strong temporal and geographical trends are identifiable. We show the importance of accounting for these trends in the modeling process."
https://openalex.org/W2652825108,"Ebola virus and Marburg virus are members of the Filovirdae family and causative agents of hemorrhagic fever with high fatality rates in humans. Filovirus virulence is partially attributed to the VP35 protein, a well-characterized inhibitor of the RIG-I-like receptor pathway that triggers the antiviral interferon (IFN) response. Prior work demonstrates the ability of VP35 to block potent RIG-I activators, such as Sendai virus (SeV), and this IFN-antagonist activity is directly correlated with its ability to bind RNA. Several structural studies demonstrate that VP35 binds short synthetic dsRNAs; yet, there are no data that identify viral immunostimulatory RNAs (isRNA) or host RNAs bound to VP35 in cells. Utilizing a SeV infection model, we demonstrate that both viral isRNA and host RNAs are bound to Ebola and Marburg VP35s in cells. By deep sequencing the purified VP35-bound RNA, we identified the SeV copy-back defective interfering (DI) RNA, previously identified as a robust RIG-I activator, as the isRNA bound by multiple filovirus VP35 proteins, including the VP35 protein from the West African outbreak strain (Makona EBOV). Moreover, RNAs isolated from a VP35 RNA-binding mutant were not immunostimulatory and did not include the SeV DI RNA. Strikingly, an analysis of host RNAs bound by wild-type, but not mutant, VP35 revealed that select host RNAs are preferentially bound by VP35 in cell culture. Taken together, these data support a model in which VP35 sequesters isRNA in virus-infected cells to avert RIG-I like receptor (RLR) activation."

https://openalex.org/W2637383459,"FCRL4 is an immunoregulatory receptor that belongs to the Fc receptor-like (FCRL) family. In healthy individuals, FCRL4 is specifically expressed by memory B cells (MBCs) localized in sub-epithelial regions of lymphoid tissues. Expansion of FCRL4+ B cells has been observed in blood and other tissues in various infectious and autoimmune disorders. Currently, the mechanisms involved in pathological FCRL4+ B cell generation are actively studied, but they remain elusive. As in vivo FCRL4+ cells are difficult to access and to isolate, here we developed a culture system to generate in vitro FCRL4+ B cells from purified MBCs upon stimulation with soluble CD40 ligand and/or CpG DNA to mimic T-cell dependent and/or T-cell independent activation, respectively. After 4 days of stimulation, FCRL4+ B cells represented 17% of all generated cells. Transcriptomic and phenotypic analyses of in vitro generated FCRL4+ cells demonstrated that they were closely related to FCRL4+ tonsillar MBCs. They strongly expressed inhibitory receptor genes, as observed in exhausted FCRL4+ MBCs from blood samples of HIV-infected individuals with high viremia. In agreement, cell cycle genes were significantly downregulated and the number of cell divisions was two-fold lower in in vitro generated FCRL4+ than FCRL4- cells. Finally, due to their reduced proliferation and differentiation potential, FCRL4+ cells were less prone to differentiate into plasma cells, differently from FCRL4- cells. Our in vitro model could be of major interest for studying the biology of normal and pathological FCRL4+ cells."

Inhibition of STAT3 signaling has shown a striking ability to inhibit cancer cell growth and therefore, STAT3 has become a promising target for anti-cancer drug development. The aim of this study was to identify novel inhibitors of STAT-dependent gene transcription. A cellular reporter-based system for monitoring STAT3 transcriptional activity was developed which was suitable for high-throughput screening (Z’ = 0,8). This system was used to screen a library of 28,000 compounds (the ENAMINE Drug-Like Diversity Set). Following counter-screenings and toxicity studies, we identified four hit compounds that were subjected to detailed biological characterization. Of the four hits, KI16 stood out as the most promising compound, inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation and transcriptional activity in response to IL6 stimulation. In silico docking studies showed that KI16 had favorable interactions with the STAT3 SH2 domain, however, no inhibitory activity could be observed in the STAT3 fluorescence polarization assay. KI16 inhibited cell viability preferentially in STAT3-dependent cell lines. Taken together, using a targeted, cell-based approach, novel inhibitors of STAT-driven transcriptional activity were discovered which are interesting leads to pursue further for the development of anti-cancer therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2717724849,"Introduction This research paper aims to assess factors reported by parents associated with the successful transition of children with complex additional support requirements that have undergone a transition between school environments from 8 European Union member states. Methods Quantitative data were collected from 306 parents within education systems from 8 EU member states (Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and the UK). The data were derived from an online questionnaire and consisted of 41 questions. Information was collected on: parental involvement in their child’s transition, child involvement in transition, child autonomy, school ethos, professionals’ involvement in transition and integrated working, such as, joint assessment, cooperation and coordination between agencies. Survey questions that were designed on a Likert-scale were included in the Principal Components Analysis (PCA), additional survey questions, along with the results from the PCA, were used to build a logistic regression model. Results Four principal components were identified accounting for 48.86% of the variability in the data. Principal component 1 (PC1), ‘child inclusive ethos,’ contains 16.17% of the variation. Principal component 2 (PC2), which represents child autonomy and involvement, is responsible for 8.52% of the total variation. Principal component 3 (PC3) contains questions relating to parental involvement and contributed to 12.26% of the overall variation. Principal component 4 (PC4), which involves transition planning and coordination, contributed to 11.91% of the overall variation. Finally, the principal components were included in a logistic regression to evaluate the relationship between inclusion and a successful transition, as well as whether other factors that may have influenced transition. All four principal components were significantly associated with a successful transition, with PC1 being having the most effect (OR: 4.04, CI: 2.43–7.18, p<0.0001). Discussion To support a child with complex additional support requirements through transition from special school to mainstream, governments and professionals need to ensure children with additional support requirements and their parents are at the centre of all decisions that affect them. It is important that professionals recognise the educational, psychological, social and cultural contexts of a child with additional support requirements and their families which will provide a holistic approach and remove barriers for learning."
https://openalex.org/W2647462917,"Background We recently reported a novel observation that many patients with equal resting supine right ventricular(RV) and pulmonary artery(PA) systolic pressures develop an RV outflow tract(RVOT) pressure gradient during upright exercise. The current work details the characteristics of patients who develop such an RVOT gradient. Methods We studied 294 patients (59.7±15.5 years-old, 49% male) referred for clinical invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing, who did not have a resting RVOT pressure gradient defined by the simultaneously measured peak-to-peak difference between RV and PA systolic pressures. Results The magnitude of RVOT gradient did not correspond to clinical or hemodynamic findings suggestive of right heart failure; rather, higher gradients were associated with favorable exercise findings. The presence of a high peak RVOT gradient (90th percentile, ≥33mmHg) was associated with male sex (70 vs. 46%, p = 0.01), younger age (43.6±17.7 vs. 61.8±13.9 years, p<0.001), lower peak right atrial pressure (5 [3–7] vs. 8 [4–12]mmHg, p<0.001), higher peak heart rate (159±19 vs. 124±26 beats per minute, p<0.001), and higher peak cardiac index (8.3±2.3 vs. 5.7±1.9 L/min/m2, p<0.001). These associations persisted when treating peak RVOT as a continuous variable and after age and sex adjustment. At peak exercise, patients with a high exercise RVOT gradient had both higher RV systolic pressure (78±11 vs. 66±17 mmHg, p<0.001) and lower PA systolic pressure (34±8 vs. 50±19 mmHg, p<0.001). Conclusions Development of a systolic RV-PA pressure gradient during upright exercise is not associated with an adverse hemodynamic exercise response and may represent a normal physiologic finding in aerobically fit young people."
https://openalex.org/W2660320799,"Cetaceans are remarkable for exhibiting group-specific behavioral traditions or cultures in several behavioral domains (e.g., calls, behavioral tactics), and the question of whether they can be acquired socially, for example through imitative processes, remains open. Here we used a ""Do as other does"" paradigm to experimentally study the ability of a beluga to imitate familiar intransitive (body-oriented) actions demonstrated by a conspecific. The participant was first trained to copy three familiar behaviors on command (training phase) and then was tested for her ability to generalize the learned ""Do as the other does"" command to a different set of three familiar behaviors (testing phase). We found that the beluga (1) was capable of learning the copy command signal ""Do what-the-other-does""; (2) exhibited high matching accuracy for trained behaviors (mean = 84% of correct performance) after making the first successful copy on command; (3) copied successfully the new set of three familiar generalization behaviors that were untrained to the copy command (range of first copy = 12 to 35 trials); and (4) deployed a high level of matching accuracy (mean = 83%) after making the first copy of an untrained behavior on command. This is the first evidence of contextual imitation of intransitive (body-oriented) movements in the beluga and adds to the reported findings on production imitation of sounds in this species and production imitation of sounds and motor actions in several cetaceans, especially dolphins and killer whales. Collectively these findings highlight the notion that cetaceans have a natural propensity at skillfully and proficiently matching the sounds and body movements demonstrated by conspecifics, a fitness-enhancing propensity in the context of cooperative hunting and anti-predatory defense tactics, and of alliance formation strategies that have been documented in these species' natural habitats. Future work should determine if the beluga can also imitate novel motor actions."
https://openalex.org/W2655778519,"Objectives The tumor suppressor p53 plays a crucial role in the development of osteosarcoma. The primary objective of this study is to develop and optimize lipid based nanoparticle formulations that can carry siRNA and effectively silence mutant p53 in 318–1, a murine osteosarcoma cell line. Methods The nanoparticles were composed of a mixture of two lipids (cholesterol and DOTAP) and either PLGA or PLGA-PEG and prepared by using an EmulsiFlex-B3 high pressure homogenizer. A series of studies that include using different nanoparticles, different amount of siRNAs, cell numbers, incubation time, transfection media volume, and storage temperature was performed to optimize the gene silencing efficiency. Key findings Replacement of lipids by PLGA or PLGA-PEG decreased the particle size and overall cytotoxicity. Among all lipid-polymer nanoformulations, nanoparticles with 10% PLGA showed highest mutant p53 knockdown efficiency while maintaining higher cell viability when a nanoparticle to siRNA ratio equal to 6.8:0.66 and 75 nM siRNA was used. With long term storage the mutant p53 knockdown efficiency decreased to a greater extent. Conclusions This study warrants a future evaluation of this formulation for gene silencing efficiency of mutant p53 in tissue culture and animal models for the treatment of osteosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2628812989,"The nucleolus has long been considered to be a pure ribosome factory. However, over the last two decades it became clear that the nucleolus is involved in numerous other functions besides ribosome biogenesis. Our experiments indicate that the activity of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription monitors the integrity of the DNA and influences the response to nucleolar stress as well as the rate of survival. Cells with a repressed ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription activity showed an increased and prolonged p53 stabilisation after UVC-irradiation. Furthermore, p53 stabilisation after inhibition and especially after UVC-irradiation might be due to abrogation of the HDM2-p53 degradation pathway by ribosomal proteins (RPs). Apoptosis mediated by highly activated p53 is a typical hallmark of Cockayne syndrome cells and transcriptional abnormalities and the following activation of the RP-HDM2-p53 pathway would be a possible explanation."

We show that J'(r) displays a valley shape in the presence of clusters of molecules, and the characteristics of the valley reliably report the clustering features in the data. Most importantly, the position of the J'(r) valley ([Formula: see text]) depends exclusively on the density of clustering molecules (ρc).

We here analyzed the susceptibility of GT1-7 cells to scrapie prions by exposure to infected mouse brains at different passages, following interspecies transmission. Wild-type mice challenged with a natural sheep scrapie case (Kanagawa) exhibited heterogeneity of transmitted scrapie prions in early passages, and this mixed population converged upon one with a short incubation period (S-type) following subsequent passages. However, when GT1-7 cells were challenged with these heterologous samples, L-type prions became dominant. This study demonstrated that the susceptibility of GT1-7 cells to L-type prions was at least 105 times higher than that to S-type prions and that L-type prion-specific biological characteristics remained unchanged after serial passages in GT1-7 cells. This suggests that a GT1-7 cell culture model would be more useful for the economical and stable amplification of L-type prions at the laboratory level. Furthermore, this cell culture model might be used to selectively propagate L-type scrapie prions from a mixed prion population."

https://openalex.org/W2695767164,"In optical DNA mapping technologies sequence-specific intensity variations (DNA barcodes) along stretched and stained DNA molecules are produced. These “fingerprints” of the underlying DNA sequence have a resolution of the order one kilobasepairs and the stretching of the DNA molecules are performed by surface adsorption or nano-channel setups. A post-processing challenge for nano-channel based methods, due to local and global random movement of the DNA molecule during imaging, is how to align different time frames in order to produce reproducible time-averaged DNA barcodes. The current solutions to this challenge are computationally rather slow. With high-throughput applications in mind, we here introduce a parameter-free method for filtering a single time frame noisy barcode (snap-shot optical map), measured in a fraction of a second. By using only a single time frame barcode we circumvent the need for post-processing alignment. We demonstrate that our method is successful at providing filtered barcodes which are less noisy and more similar to time averaged barcodes. The method is based on the application of a low-pass filter on a single noisy barcode using the width of the Point Spread Function of the system as a unique, and known, filtering parameter. We find that after applying our method, the Pearson correlation coefficient (a real number in the range from -1 to 1) between the single time-frame barcode and the time average of the aligned kymograph increases significantly, roughly by 0.2 on average. By comparing to a database of more than 3000 theoretical plasmid barcodes we show that the capabilities to identify plasmids is improved by filtering single time-frame barcodes compared to the unfiltered analogues. Since snap-shot experiments and computational time using our method both are less than a second, this study opens up for high throughput optical DNA mapping with improved reproducibility."
https://openalex.org/W2640900643,"Mutations in the human genes PRESENILIN1 (PSEN1), PRESENILIN2 (PSEN2) and AMYLOID BETA A4 PRECURSOR PROTEIN (APP) have been identified in familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). The length of mitochondrion-endoplasmic reticulum (M-ER) appositions is increased in Psen1-/-/Psen2-/- double knockout murine embryonic fibroblasts and in fibroblasts from AD-affected individuals. Development of an easily accessible, genetically manipulable, in vivo system for studying M-ER appositions would be valuable so we attempted to manipulate M-ER apposition length in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. We injected fertilized zebrafish eggs with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) that inhibit expression of zebrafish familial AD gene orthologues psen1 and psen2. Furthermore, we treated zebrafish embryos with DAPT (a highly specific γ-secretase inhibitor) or with sodium azide (to mimic partially hypoxic conditions). We then analyzed M-ER apposition in an identified, presumably proliferative neural cell type using electron microscopy. Our analysis showed no significant differences in M-ER apposition lengths at 48 hours post fertilization (hpf) between psen1 & psen2 MO co-injected embryos, embryos treated with DAPT, or sodium azide, and control embryos. Instead, the distribution of M-ER apposition lengths into different length classes was close to identical. However, this indicates that it is feasible to reproducibly measure M-ER size distributions in zebrafish embryos. While our observations differ from those of murine and human studies, this may be due to differences in cellular differentiation and metabolic state, cell age, or species-specific responses. In particular, by focusing on a presumably proliferative embryonic cell type, we may have selected a cell heavily already reliant on anaerobic glycolysis and less responsive to factors affecting M-ER apposition. Future examination of more differentiated, more secretory cell types may reveal measurable responses of M-ER apposition to environmental and genetic manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W2704207604,"Neurons at primary visual cortex (V1) in humans and other species are edge filters organized in orientation maps. In these maps, neurons with similar orientation preference are clustered together in iso-orientation domains. These maps have two fundamental properties: (1) retinotopy, i.e. correspondence between displacements at the image space and displacements at the cortical surface, and (2) a trade-off between good coverage of the visual field with all orientations and continuity of iso-orientation domains in the cortical space. There is an active debate on the origin of these locally continuous maps. While most of the existing descriptions take purely geometric/mechanistic approaches which disregard the network function, a clear exception to this trend in the literature is the original approach of Hyvärinen and Hoyer based on infomax and Topographic Independent Component Analysis (TICA). Although TICA successfully addresses a number of other properties of V1 simple and complex cells, in this work we question the validity of the orientation maps obtained from TICA. We argue that the maps predicted by TICA can be analyzed in the retinal space, and when doing so, it is apparent that they lack the required continuity and retinotopy. Here we show that in the orientation maps reported in the TICA literature it is easy to find examples of violation of the continuity between similarly tuned mechanisms in the retinal space, which suggest a random scrambling incompatible with the maps in primates. The new experiments in the retinal space presented here confirm this guess: TICA basis vectors actually follow a random salt-and-pepper organization back in the image space. Therefore, the interesting clusters found in the TICA topology cannot be interpreted as the actual cortical orientation maps found in cats, primates or humans. In conclusion, Topographic ICA does not reproduce cortical orientation maps."
https://openalex.org/W2714773962,"Experimental research has shown that pairs of stimuli which are congruent and assumed to 'go together' are recalled more effectively than an item presented in isolation. Will this multisensory memory benefit occur when stimuli are richer and longer, in an ecological setting? In the present study, we focused on an everyday situation of audio-visual learning and manipulated the relationship between audio guide tracks and viewed portraits in the galleries of the Tate Britain. By varying the gender and narrative style of the voice-over, we examined how the perceived congruency and assumed unity of the audio guide track with painted portraits affected subsequent recall. We show that tracks perceived as best matching the viewed portraits led to greater recall of both sensory and linguistic content. We provide the first evidence that manipulating crossmodal congruence and unity assumptions can effectively impact memory in a multisensory ecological setting, even in the absence of precise temporal alignment between sensory cues."

https://openalex.org/W2723971739,"Background Routine physical examinations might be of value in HIV-infected patients, but the yield is unknown. We determined the diagnoses that would have been missed without performing annual routine physical examinations in HIV-infected patients with stable disease. Methods Data were collected from the medical records of 299 HIV-1-infected patients with CD4 count >350 cells/mm3 if not using combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), or CD4 count >100 cells/mm3 and undetectable viral load if using cART. We defined the diagnoses that would have been missed without performing routine physical examinations on annual check-ups in 2010. Exclusion criteria were hepatitis B/C co-infection, start/ switch of cART < 24 weeks, pregnancy, and transgenderism. Results 215 patients (72%) had positive findings: lipodystrophy (30%), lymphadenopathy (16%) and hypertension (8.4%) were the most common. Two-thirds of all findings were not new or were based on complaints indicating a physical examination even if not routinely scheduled. For 24 patients (8.0%) the routine physical examination led to the finding of a new diagnosis: six—all men who have sex with men (MSM)—had a concurrent sexually transmitted infection, eight had hypertension, and ten others had a large variety of diagnoses. A total atrioventricular block with bradycardia was the most clinically relevant finding. Conclusions Annual physical examinations of HIV-infected patients with stable disease brought few new diagnoses that would have been missed without performing a routine examination. Our results suggest that standard assessments could be restricted to six-monthly measuring blood pressure in all patients and annually performing anogenital and digital rectal examination on MSM."
