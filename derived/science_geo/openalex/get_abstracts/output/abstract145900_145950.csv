https://openalex.org/W2111251212,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine, whose plasma levels are elevated in inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis. We have previously reported that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) ligands (fibrates) lower elevated plasma concentrations of IL-6 in patients with atherosclerosis and inhibit IL-1-stimulated IL-6 secretion by human aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC). Here, we show that aortic explants isolated from PPARα-null mice display an exacerbated response to inflammatory stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as demonstrated by increased IL-6 secretion. Furthermore, fibrate treatment represses IL-6 mRNA levels in LPS-stimulated aortas of PPARα wild-type, but not of PPARα-null mice, demonstrating a role for PPARα in this fibrate action. In human aortic SMC, fibrates inhibit IL-1-induced IL-6 gene expression. Furthermore, activation of PPARα represses both c-Jun- and p65-induced transcription of the human IL-6 promoter. Transcriptional interference between PPARα and both c-Jun and p65 occurs reciprocally, since c-Jun and p65 also inhibit PPARα-mediated activation of a PPAR response element-driven promoter. This transcriptional interference occurs independent of the promoter context as demonstrated by cotransfection experiments using PPARα, p65, and c-Jun Gal4 chimeras. Overexpression of the transcriptional coactivator cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) does not relieve PPARα-mediated transcriptional repression of p65 and c-Jun. Finally, glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments demonstrate that PPARα physically interacts with c-Jun, p65, and CBP. Altogether these data indicate that fibrates inhibit the vascular inflammatory response via PPARα by interfering with the NF-κB and AP-1 transactivation capacity involving direct protein-protein interaction with p65 and c-Jun.

Atherosclerosis is a complex vascular disease characterized by endothelial injury, monocyte infiltration in the subendothelial space, followed by differentiation into macrophages followed by cholesterol deposition.

The presence of macrophages, T lymphocytes, as well as numerous cytokines in the atherosclerotic lesion suggests an important immunological component in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (1Ross R.

IL-6 controls macrophage and T cell activation, SMC proliferation, and migration and is a major regulator of the acute phase response (5Castell J.V. Gomez-Lechon M.J. David M. Andus T. Geiger T.

PPARs regulate gene expression by binding with their heterodimeric partner retinoid X receptor to specific PPAR-response elements (PPREs) (9Tugwood J.D. Issemann I. Anderson R.G. Bundell K.R.

Fatty acid derivatives and eicosanoids were identified as natural ligands for PPARs (10Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar), which mediates the lipid-lowering activity of these drugs (15Staels B. Dallongeville J. Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Leitersdorf E. Fruchart J.C. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2088-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Several indirect observations suggest that fibrates may also exert a direct anti-atherogenic activity at the level of the vascular wall, which occurs independently of their lipid-lowering activity. First, treatment of cholesterol-fed rabbits with the PPARα ligand fenofibrate decreases atherosclerotic plaque formation in the thoracic aorta, in the absence of any lowering of plasma lipid levels (16Saitoh K. Mori T. Kasai H. Nagayama T. Tsuchiya A. Ohbayashi S. Folia Pharmacol. Jpn. 1995; 106: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Second, in a number of intervention trials, such as BECAIT and LOCAT, fibrate treatment slows the progression of coronary atherosclerosis without significantly affecting plasma atherogenic lipoprotein concentrations (17Frick H. Syvänne M. Nieminen S. Kauma H. Majahalme S. Virtanen V. Kesäniemi A. Pasternack A. Taskinen M.R. Circulation. 1997; 96: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 18Ruotolo G.

(11Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vasquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar) showed that absence of PPARα expression in mice prolonged the inflammatory response. We and others (19Staels B. Koenig W.

Although much is known about gene activation by PPARs acting via PPREs, less information exists about the mechanisms of negative gene modulation by PPARs. Recently, PPARs have been suggested to exert anti-inflammatory activities by antagonizing the AP-1, NF-κB, and STAT pathways in macrophages and SMC (19Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M.

To address the physiological role of PPARα in the regulation of the inflammatory response at the level of the vascular wall, studies were performed using PPARα-null mice as a model. Our results demonstrate, using IL-6 secretion as an inflammatory marker, that aortas from PPARα-null mice display an exacerbated inflammatory response to LPS. We next carried out experiments to characterize the molecular mechanisms implicated in the down-modulation of IL-6 gene promoter activity by PPARα activators. Human aortic SMC (Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR) were cultured in SMC basal medium containing 5% SMC growth supplement (Cascade Biologics). Cells from passages 5 to 8 were used for the experiments. COS-1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Wy-14643 was from Chemsyn, Lenexa, KS; fenofibric acid from Laboratoires Fournier, Dijon, France; IL-1β from Genzyme, Cambridge, MD; and LPS from Sigma, Saint Quentin, France. RNA preparation and Northern blot hybridizations were performed as described previously (23Staels B. van Tol A. Andreu T. Auwerx J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 286-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human IL-6 (24De Bosscher K. Schmitz M.L. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13504-13509Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and 36B4 cDNA fragments were used as probes. Male PPARα −/− (F6 homozygotes; SV/129 genetic background; 10 weeks old) (25Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar) and male PPARα +/+ (SV/129 genetic background; 10 weeks old) were sacrificed by pentobarbital injection. The descending aorta was quickly dissected, excised, and cut into two segments, which were cultured in standard medium with or without LPS (10 μg/ml) for 24 h. IL-6 concentrations were measured as described previously (26Belmin J. Bernard C. Corman B. Merval R. Esposito B. Tedgui A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: 2288-2293PubMed Google Scholar) and normalized to cellular DNA content determined by a fluorimetric assay (27Hinegardner R.T. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 39: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). The pRSV-p65, p(κB)3-luc+ (Stratagene), p(AP-1)3-luc+ (Stratagene), pSG5-hPPARα, and PPRE-containing reporter plasmids (J6-TK-Luc) were described previously (19Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R.

The truncated form of hPPARα (pSG5-hPPARαΔLBD) lacking the PPARα ligand binding domain was constructed by PCR as described previously. 2Gervois, P., Torra, I.

The c-Jun and c-Fos expression plasmids under the control of the RSV promoter were provided by Drs. Bakiri and Yaniv (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). The wild-type human IL-6 promoter construct p1168hu.IL6P-luc+ and the corresponding mutants of the NF-κB or AP-1 response elements, as well as the plasmid p(GAL4)250hu.IL6P-luc+, containing two sites for the yeast transcription factor Gal4 in front of the IL-6 promoter TATA box containing minimal promoter, have been described previously (28Vanden Berghe W.

The expression plasmids pGal4, pGal4-p65, and pGal4-c-Jun containing the DNA-binding domain of the yeast Gal4 protein either alone or fused to the full-length p65 or c-Jun polypeptides were kindly provided by Dr. Schmitz (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany) (29Schmitz M.L.

The plasmid pGal5-TK-pGL3 was obtained by inserting five copies of the Gal4 DNA binding site in front of the thymidine kinase promoter of the pTK-pGL3 plasmid. The plasmid pGal4-hPPARα was constructed by PCR-amplifying the hPPARα DEF domains (aa 166–467) using pSG5-hPPARα as template. The resulting PCR product was cloned in pBD-Gal4 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the chimera subsequently subcloned into the pCDNA3 vector. pGal4p65286–551 (24De Bosscher K. Schmitz M.L.

Hek293T cells and COS-1 cells, grown to 50–60% confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique with reporter and expression plasmids, as stated in the figure's legend. Phosphoglycerate kinase-β-galactosidase expression plasmid was cotransfected as a control for transfection efficiency. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by using corresponding empty vector mock DNA. For Hek293T cells, 16 h post-transfection, medium was refreshed and, where necessary, supplemented with Wy-14643 (10 μm) or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO). After 24 h, cells were collected and the luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (19Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Pineda-Torra I. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Nature. 1998; 393: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). For COS-1 transfection, after 5 h cells were refed with DMEM supplemented with 0.2% FCS and Wy-14643 (10 μm) or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO). 48 h later, the COS-1 cells were collected and also subjected to luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. All experiments were repeated at least three times. GST pull-down assays were performed as described elsewhere (33Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Briefly, approximately 0.5 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was incubated with 4–8 μl (according to expression efficiency) of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled protein in the presence of 100 μm Wy-14643 dissolved in Me2SO or Me2SO alone in a total volume of 200 μl of incubation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm pefabloc, 0.15 IU/ml aprotinin) and rotated at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the beads were washed four times for 15 min with incubation buffer without bovine serum albumin, resuspended in 30 μl of 1 × Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. After drying, gels were exposed to a phosphorimager (Image Quant) screen. In order to provide genetic evidence for a role of PPARα in the vascular inflammatory response, basal and LPS-stimulated IL-6 production by aortic segments from PPARα −/− and +/+ mice were compared. In the absence of LPS stimulation, basal IL-6 secretion was similar in aortas of both groups of mice (Fig.1 A). LPS stimulation resulted in a significant increase of IL-6 production (approximately 3-fold) in wild-type mice aortas, in agreement with previous observations (26Belmin J. Bernard C. Corman B. Merval R. Esposito B. Tedgui A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: 2288-2293PubMed Google Scholar). However, this increase was much greater in aortas isolated from the PPARα −/− mice (12-fold, p < 0.03). These observations indicate that PPARα deficiency results in an increased vascular inflammatory response, as assessed by enhanced IL-6 secretion. Next, the influence of treatment with the PPARα-agonist fenofibrate on the inflammatory response was analyzed in aortas of PPARα −/− and +/+ mice. In the absence of LPS stimulation, basal IL-6 mRNA levels were very low (data not shown) and became only detectable after LPS injection. In LPS-injected PPARα +/+ mice, treatment with fenofibrate decreased significantly IL-6 mRNA levels in aortas, whereas fenofibrate did not have any effect in PPARα −/− mice (Fig.1 B). These data indicate that the anti-inflammatory properties of fenofibrate are PPARα-dependent and that PPARα controls the vascular inflammatory response at the gene expression level in vivo. Next, it was determined whether PPARα activation inhibits the induction of IL-6 mRNA levels by inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β in human aortic SMC. As expected, stimulation of SMC with IL-1β resulted in a severalfold increase of IL-6 mRNA (Fig. 2). This induction was, however, inhibited in the presence of Wy-14643. These data indicate that PPARα activation inhibits IL-6 gene induction by inflammatory cytokines in vitro. Next, it was studied whether PPARα interferes with IL-6 gene expression at the transcriptional level. Several regulatory elements such as an AP-1, a C/EBP, an NF-κB, and a multiple response element, have been identified in the human IL-6 promoter (34Akira S. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 1-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), of which the AP-1 and NF-κB response elements have been shown to mediate the IL-6 response to inflammatory stimuli such as IL-1β (35Munoz C. Pascual-Salcedo D. Castellanos M.C. Alfranca A. Aragones J. Vara A. Redondo J.M. Landazuri M.O. Blood. 1996; 88: 3482-3490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether PPARα interferes with the transcriptional activation of the IL-6 promoter by the transcription factors AP-1 and/or NF-κB, transient cotransfection experiments were performed. Because of the inability to transfect primary cultured human aortic SMC, COS-1 cells were used for these transient transfection experiments. Cotransfection of the p65 NF-κB subunit resulted in a strong activation of wild-type IL-6 promoter activity (11-fold) (Fig. 3 A). Cotransfection of human PPARα alone did not influence basal IL-6 promoter activity. However, the activation of the IL-6 promoter by p65 was significantly (p = 0.007) decreased in the presence of PPARα activated by Wy-14643. As expected, p65 cotransfection did not activate a promoter construct mutated in the NF-κB site, nor a construct containing only the IL-6 promoter TATA box region in front of the luciferase gene (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, p65 induction of the IL-6 promoter mutated in the AP-1 site was less pronounced as compared with the wild-type promoter, suggesting functional interaction between the NF-κB and AP-1 sites. However, similarly as the wild-type, cotransfection of PPARα in the presence of its ligand was able to repress p65-mediated induction (p = 0.031) of the IL-6 promoter mutated in the AP-1 site (Fig. 3 A). Cotransfection of c-Jun and c-Fos also strongly activated the wild-type human IL-6 promoter (Fig. 3 B). This induction was reduced by PPARα cotransfection (p = 0.042) in the presence of Wy-14643. As expected, the IL-6 promoter mutated on the AP-1 site as well as the minimal IL-6 promoter were not activated by c-Jun/c-Fos. Similarly as for p65 activation on the AP-1 site mutated promoter, the NF-κB site-mutated promoter was less inducible by c-Jun/c-Fos than the wild-type promoter, but PPARα was able to repress the induction by c-Jun/c-Fos (p = 0.039). However, PPARα cotransfection did not result in a significant inhibition of the basal activity of the NF-κB site mutated promoter. Taken together, these data indicate that PPARα represses IL-6 promoter activation by interfering negatively with the AP-1 and NF-κB transcriptional activities. Next, it was investigated whether PPARα could interfere with AP-1 and NF-κB transactivation independently of the promoter context. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of PPARα on the transcriptional activation of a Gal4-dependent reporter, activated by the p65 or c-Jun chimeras (Fig.4). As a control, PPARα did not influence transcriptional activity of the Gal4 DBD alone. Transfection of the chimera containing the NF-κB p65 subunit led to a strong transcriptional activation (almost 20-fold) of the reporter construct. This induction was significantly reduced (−60%) by PPARα cotransfection in the presence of Wy-14643. Cotransfection of the c-Jun chimera resulted in a less pronounced induction of promoter activity (6-fold), but an almost complete repression (-74%) of c-Jun-mediated transactivation was observed in the presence of cotransfected PPARα in the presence of its ligand. These results indicate that PPARα interferes negatively with the c-Jun as well as with the NF-κB transactivation capacities in a manner independent of the promoter context. In order to determine whether the transcriptional cross-talk between PPARα, NF-κB, and AP-1 activities occurs in a reciprocal manner, transfection assays were performed to test the effect of p65 and c-Jun on a PPAR-dependent PPRE-driven promoter. In the absence of cotransfected PPARα, the PPRE-driven reporter was slightly activated by addition of Wy-14643 (Fig. 5). As expected, cotransfection of PPARα significantly induced the reporter activity in the presence of Wy-14643 (3.5-fold). Cotransfection of increasing amounts of p65 (Fig. 5 A) or c-Jun (Fig.5 B) expression vectors led to a dose-dependent inhibition of PPARα-induced reporter activity without affecting basal promoter activity. This result indicates the existence of a bidirectional antagonism between PPARα, c-Jun, and NF-κB activities. In order to delineate which domains of PPARα are involved in the transcriptional cross-talk with AP-1 and NF-κB, transfection experiments were performed using a chimera containing the PPARα C-terminal amino acids (LBD) fused to the Gal4 DBD (amino acids 1–147) in the presence or absence of c-Jun or p65 (Fig.6, A and B). Neither treatment with Wy-14643 nor cotransfection of p65 and c-Jun exerted a major effect on the reporter activity in the absence of cotransfected Gal4-LBD (Fig. 6, A and B). However, in the presence of the latter, Wy-14643 strongly activated (10-fold) the Gal4-responsive promoter. This induction was significantly repressed by p65 (Fig. 6 A), whereas cotransfection of c-Jun had almost no effect (Fig. 6 B). When the influence of a recently identified, natural truncated form of PPARα, which lacks the entire LBD and only contains amino acids 1–170 of the wild-type PPARα, was tested on Gal4-p65 driven transactivation (Fig. 6C), a significant, but less pronounced, repression (−20%) of p65 transactivation was observed when compared with the wild-type form (−60%). By contrast, the truncated form of PPARα was able to repress c-Jun transactivation to a similar extent as the wild-type PPARα (−60%) (Fig. 6 D). Taken together these data indicate that transrepression of NF-κB by PPARα involves mainly the C-terminal domains of the receptor, whereas transrepression of c-Jun implicates the N terminus. Since it was reported that competition for common coactivators could be a mechanism of gene repression by nuclear receptors (36Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C.

As expected, cotransfection of p65 or c-Jun strongly induced a minimal promoter driven by multiple NF-κB (Fig.7 A) or AP-1 (Fig.7 B) response elements, respectively (lane 5). PPARα cotransfection in the presence of Wy-14643 resulted in a significant reduction of both p65 and c-Jun reporter transactivation (lane 6). To assess the effect of the co-integrator CBP, increasing amounts of CBP (0.1, 0.2, 0.3 μg) expression vector were cotransfected. Increasing CBP concentrations stepwise enhanced the c-Jun or p65-mediated transcriptional activation (lanes 7,8, and 9), which could again be repressed in the presence of activated PPARα (lanes 10 and 11). These results indicate that the PPARα-mediated repression of both p65 and c-Jun transcriptional activities occurs in a CBP-independent manner. To determine whether PPARα interacts physically with p65, c-Jun, and CBP, GST pull-down experiments were performed (Fig.8). Interaction of PPARα protein with the p65 Rel homology domain (aa 12–317) could be detected, whereas the C-terminal transactivation domain of p65 (aa 286–551) did not bind to PPARα (Fig. 8 A). Furthermore, PPARα also interacted with the JNK-responsive part of c-Jun (aa 1–79) (Fig. 8 B). This interaction occurs via the N-terminal DBD containing part of PPARα, since the C-terminal deletion mutant of PPARα also binds to c-Jun (Fig. 8 C), in agreement with the results fr"

In its inactive state, NF-κB is constitutively present in the cytoplasm as a p50-p65 heterodimer bound to its inhibitory protein IκB. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), activate NF-κB by stimulating the activity of the IκB kinases (IKKs) which phosphorylate IκBα on serine residues 32 and 36, targeting it for rapid degradation by the 26 S proteasome. This enables the release and nuclear translocation of the NF-κB complex and activation of gene transcription. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a pleiotropic cytokine that controls inflammatory processes by suppressing the production of proinflammatory cytokines which are known to be transcriptionally controlled by NF-κB. Conflicting data exists on the effects of IL-10 on TNF- and LPS-induced NF-κB activity in human monocytes and the molecular mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. In this study, we show that IL-10 functions to block NF-κB activity at two levels: 1) through the suppression of IKK activity and 2) through the inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding activity. This is the first evidence of an anti-inflammatory protein inhibiting IKK activity and demonstrates that IKK is a logical target for blocking inflammatory diseases.

Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 383-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Some molecular mechanisms of monocyte deactivation by IL-10 have been described. IL-10 was found to inhibit protein-tyrosine kinase activation induced by LPS binding to the CD14 receptor and to consequently block the downstream Ras signaling pathway (23Geng Y. Gulbins E. Altman A. Lotz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8602-8606Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Moreover, IL-10 has been shown to interfere with protein-tyrosine kinase-dependent CD40 signaling controlling IL-1β synthesis in monocytes (24Poe J.C. Wagner Jr., D.H. Miller R.W. Stout R.D. Suttles J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 846-852PubMed Google Scholar). Many of the proinflammatory cytokines and costimulatory proteins demonstrated to be suppressed by IL-10 are known to be regulated by the transcription factor NF-κB (25Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NF-κB also has a role in IL-10 gene expression (26Mori N. Prager D. Eur. J. Haematol. 1997; 59: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Classical NF-κB, a heterodimer composed of p50 and p65 subunits, is a potent activator of gene expression (25Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 27Finco T. Baldwin A. Immunity. 1995; 3: 263-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 28Schmitz M. dos Santos Silva M. Baeuerle P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). NF-κB resides in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex bound to the inhibitor protein IκB (27Finco T. Baldwin A. Immunity. 1995; 3: 263-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In response to a variety of extracellular stimuli, such as IL-1β, TNF, LPS, or phorbol esters, IκB proteins are rapidly phosphorylated by the recently identified IκB kinase (IKK) complex. IKK-induced phosphorylation of IκB occurs on residues Ser32 and Ser36 for IκBα and on Ser19 and Ser23 for IκBβ (25Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 29DiDonato J. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D. Zandi E. Karin M.

Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar) which targets these inhibitory proteins for rapid polyubiquitination and degradation through the 26 S proteasome (31Finco T.S. Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11884-11888Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). This results in liberation of NF-κB from IκB and subsequent translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus where it regulates gene transcription. The recent identification of the kinases responsible for IκB phosphorylation is a critical step for understanding the mechanisms of NF-κB activation. The cytokine-responsive IκB kinase complex is composed of stoichiometric amounts of IKK-α and IKK-β and the recently discovered IKKγ/NEMO (32Rothwarf D. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). IKKγ preferentially interacts with IKKβ and is required for the activation of the IKK complex (29DiDonato J. Hayakawa M.

Further evidence that IKKα and IKKβ are required for the functional IKK complex is supported by experiments which demonstrate that the overexpression of IKKα or IKKβ activated an NF-κB-dependent reporter, whereas dominant negative mutants of IKKα or IKKβ inhibited TNF- or IL-1-induced NF-κB activation (29DiDonato J.

Although IL-10 has been found to inhibit the activity of NF-κB in monocytes/macrophages and T cells, results from different groups have been variable as to whether the block occurs at the level of IκB (37Wang P.

Furthermore, no molecular mechanisms have been elucidated which may control NF-κB activity in response to IL-10. Our data provides evidence that IL-10 inhibits TNF-induced NF-κB activity by blocking TNF-induced IKK activity, thus inhibiting degradation of IκB and the subsequent NF-κB nuclear translocation. Additionally, a second mechanism appears to be functional: IL-10 signaling blocks the ability of translocated NF-κB to bind to DNA. The human monocytic cell lines THP-1 (TIB202) and U937 (CRL-1593) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 containing l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Life Technologies). Media for THP-1 cells was additionally supplemented with HEPES (pH 7.8) to a final concentration of 20 mm and with 2-mercaptoethanol (Life Technologies, Inc.) to a final concentration of 5.5 × 10−5m. The human intestinal epithelial cell line HT-29 (HTB 38) was obtained from ATCC and was cultured at 37 °C in McCoy's 5A Media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Recombinant human TNF was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Recombinant human IL-10 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Stock solutions were found to have less than 0.1 ng of endotoxin/1 μg of cytokine as determined by the LAL method. LPS (fromEscherichia coli Serotype 055:B5) was purchased from Sigma. Cells were grown to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and stimulated with TNF or LPS, in the presence or absence of IL-10. After the indicated time periods, cells were harvested and processed for electrophoretic mobility shift assays, Western blot analysis, or IκB kinase assays. Nuclear extracts for EMSAs were prepared as described previously (41Cheshire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6746-6754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 0.05% of Nonidet P-40 was used to extract nuclei. 8 μg of extract were incubated for 20 min in a total of 20 μl containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) with 4–6 × 104 cpm of a32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe containing a κB site from the class I MHC promoter (5′-CAGGGCTGGGGATTCCCCATCTCCACAGTTTCACTTC-3′). The final buffer concentration was 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol. Complexes were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in Tris glycine buffer (25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA) at 25 mA for 2–3 h at room temperature. Dried gels were exposed on film for 15–48 h. For supershift analysis, antibodies against specific NF-κB subunits were added to the nuclear extract and incubated for 15 min prior to the addition of poly(dI-dC) and labeled oligonucleotide probe. The following antibodies were used for supershift analysis: p65 (Rockland, Boyertown, PA), p50 (NLS, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and c-Rel (C, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For transient transfections of THP-1 cells, cells were divided the day prior to transfection. THP-1 cells were transiently transfected with the 3xκB luciferase reporter plasmid, containing three copies of the MHC class I NF-κB consensus site or were transfected with a mutant 3xκB (mut3xκB) luciferase reporter, which is no longer transcriptionally activated by NF-κB. On the day of transfection, cells were collected and washed with ×1 phosphate-buffered saline. A total of 5 μg of plasmid DNA was incubated in a total volume of 500 μl of suspension Tris-buffered saline containing 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.6 mmNa2HPO4, 0.7 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2. 500 μl of suspension Tris-buffered saline were combined with 500 μl of diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-dextran) (Sigma) to a final concentration of 100 mg/ml. This mixture was added to the pelleted cells that were carefully resuspended and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with suspension Tris-buffered saline and medium and were resuspended in 10 ml of complete medium. After a period of 48 h, IL-10 was added 60 min prior to stimulation with TNF for an additional 5 h. Cell extracts were prepared and luciferase activity was monitored as described previously (41Cheshire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6746-6754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HT-29 cells were transfected with SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Quiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) as recommended by the manufacturer. Total RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy Mini Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). RNA samples were fractionated on an agarose gel and transferred overnight onto a nylon filter. The next day RNA was cross-linked with a UV cross-linker (Stratagene, La Jolla, Ca). For detection of IκBα and IL-8 mRNAs, blots were hybridized in QuickHyb buffer supplemented with 100 μg of salmon sperm DNA as recommended by the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All probes were generated with a random primed labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products Inc.). DNA products were purified over micro-Sephadex G-50 columns (Life Technologies), boiled, and added to the hybridization mixture. Washes were performed twice in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature, followed by two washes in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 65 °C. Membranes were then exposed to film overnight. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (41Cheshire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6746-6754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Blocking was performed in 5% nonfat dry milk, 1 × TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 125m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 1 × TBST and incubations proceeded for 30 min at room temperature. Washes were performed in 1 × TBST for 5 min and repeated 3 times. Specific proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibodies for IκBα (C-21), IκBβ (C-20), IκBε (M-121), and p50 (NLS) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibody for p65 was obtained from Rockland. Cells were treated with TNF for various times without or with prior incubation with IL-10. Whole cell extracts were immunoprecipated with an antibody against IKK-β (gift of Dr. F. Mercurio, Signal Pharmaceutics) and the immunoprecipitates subjected to an IKK activity assay (36Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennet B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar), using GST-IκBα(1–54) WT (4 μg) or a mutated form of IκBα(S32T,S36T) as substrates. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and gels were dyed with Gelcode Blue stain (Pierce Inc.) for equal loading control. Bands were quantitated on a PhosphorImager System (Storm 840; Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnydale, CA.). To investigate whether the anti-inflammatory effects of IL-10 are mediated through the ability of this cytokine to inhibit NF-κB, we chose to use the human monocytic cell lines THP-1 and U973 and the human intestinal epithelial cell line HT-29 as in vitro models. To elucidate whether IL-10 induced a similar effect in THP-1, U937, and HT-29 cells as previously demonstrated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (7Wang P. Wu P. Anthes J. Siegel M. Egan R. Billah M. Blood. 1994; 83: 2678-2683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cells were stimulated with TNF or LPS in either the presence or absence of human recombinant IL-10. Stimulation with TNF or LPS for 8 h led to an increase in IL-8 production in THP-1, U937, and HT-29 cells, which was inhibited by the addition of IL-10 (data not shown). Since it has been well established that TNF up-regulates IL-8 transcription through an NF-κB-dependent mechanism (42Stein B. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7191-7198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether IL-10 inhibited transcriptional activation of NF-κB. THP-1 and HT-29 cells were transiently transfected with the 3xκB luciferase reporter plasmid, containing three copies of the MHC class I NF-κB consensus site. To ensure that luciferase activities were specific for NF-κB-dependent transcription, experiments were also performed in parallel using the mutant 3xκB (mut 3xκB) luciferase reporter, which is not transcriptionally activated by NF-κB (43Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Chen Z. Maniatis T. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11259-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with TNF in either the presence or absence of IL-10, harvested 5 h following addition of TNF, and assayed for NF-κB-dependent transcription. As shown in Fig. 1 A, TNF induced the transcriptional activity of NF-κB approximately 20-fold in THP-1 cells (left panel) and approximately 35-fold in HT-29 cells (right panel). However, pretreatment with IL-10 strongly inhibited the TNF-induced NF-κB activity in both THP-1 and HT-29 cells (Fig. 1 A). The ability of IL-10 to modulate NF-κB transcriptional activity was specific, since transfection experiments were normalized to the mut 3xκB luciferase reporter (Fig. 1 A, left and right panels). Since IL-10 repressed an NF-κB responsive reporter in transient transfection assays, we wanted to determine whether IL-10 would also block the ability of TNF to up-regulate NF-κB responsive gene expression. To experimentally address this question, Northern blot analysis for IκBα and IL-8 (both NF-κB-regulated genes) was performed. Total RNA was prepared from THP-1 cells that had been treated with TNF alone, with TNF plus IL-10, or with TNF plus the NF-κB inhibitor MG 132 (55Jobin C. Hellerbrand C. Licato L.L. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. Gut. 1998; 42: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). TNF-treated cells displayed a strong increase in both IκBα and IL-8 gene expression (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 2, upper and middle panels). However, IκBα and IL-8 mRNA levels were suppressed approximately 60% in cells that had been pretreated by IL-10 and subsequently stimulated with TNF (Fig. 1 B, lane 5, upper and middle panels). As predicted, pretreatment with the NF-κB inhibitor MG 132 suppressed TNF-induced IκBα and IL-8 mRNA levels almost completely (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 3, upper and middle panels). These results indicate that IL-10 is capable of inhibiting TNF-induced expression of two endogenous, NF-κB-regulated genes. To assess whether IL-10 inhibited NF-κB-dependent transcription through the suppression of DNA binding, EMSAs were performed. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells treated with TNF or LPS in the presence or absence of IL-10 and nuclear proteins were analyzed for their ability to recognize a 32P-labeled NF-κB consensus site. Analysis of nuclear extracts from TNF- or LPS-stimulated cells demonstrated an increase in NF-κB DNA binding activity as compared with nuclear extracts from unstimulated cells (Fig. 1 C, compare lane 1 to 3, left, middle, andright panels). Pretreatment with IL-10 inhibited TNF- and LPS-induced DNA binding in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 C, lanes 4–6, left and middle panels). IL-10 induced its effects on NF-κB DNA binding by specifically affecting the p65/p50 heterodimer complex, as determined by antibody supershift experiments (data not shown). Even though IL-10 blocked both TNF- and LPS-induced NF-κB DNA binding, the ability of IL-10 to inhibit NF-κB was greater in response to TNF than in response to LPS. Importantly, IL-10 inhibited TNF-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity to a similar level in both THP-1 and U937 cells (Fig. 1 C and data not shown). Although we observed a similar inhibitory effect on NF-κB DNA binding activity in HT-29 cells following TNF stimulation, this effect was not as dramatic as observed for monocytic cells (Fig.1 C). The primary level of control of NF-κB is through its interaction with the inhibitor protein IκB. Thus, one mechanism to explain the ability of IL-10 to inhibit NF-κB activity is by the ability of this anti-inflammatory cytokine to inhibit nuclear translocation of NF-κB by blocking IκBα degradation in response to TNF stimulation. To experimentally address this question, THP-1 cells were stimulated with TNF for 15 min in either the presence or absence of IL-10, cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were isolated, and Western blot analysis was performed to determine whether IL-10 addition effected nuclear translocation of the p65 protein. As shown in Fig. 1 D, p65 was predominantly cytoplasmically localized in unstimulated cells (Fig. 1 D, lanes 1 and 2) and in cells treated with IL-10 alone (lanes 3 and 4). Cells stimulated with TNF (15 min) demonstrated an increase in nuclear translocation of p65 (lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, cells pretreated with IL-10 and then stimulated with TNF for 15 min demonstrated a reduction in nuclear p65 (Fig. 1 D, compare lanes 7 and 8 with lanes 5 and 6). To further elucidate if the IL-10-induced block of p65 nuclear translocation was caused by the ability of this cytokine to interfere with TNF-induced degradation of IκBα, cytoplasmic extracts of cells stimulated with TNF for various times in the absence or presence of IL-10 were subjected to Western blot analysis. Immunoblot analysis for IκBα demonstrated that treatment with TNF resulted in a time-dependent degradation of IκBα. In contrast, pretreatment with IL-10 prevented IκBα degradation up to 15 min following the addition of TNF (Fig.2 A). However, IL-10 failed to prevent TNF-induced degradation of IκBα 30 min post-stimulation (Fig. 2 A, lane 11). The fact that IκBα reaccumulates following degradation is not explained by the inability of IL-10 to block NF-κB activation since IL-10 blocks the induction of IκBα mRNA (see Fig. 1 B). Differences in IκBα protein levels observed in TNF and IL-10 treated cells were not due to differences in protein loading since immunoblot analysis demonstrated similar levels of p50 expression (Fig. 2 A). These results indicate that single dose pretreatment with IL-10 transiently blocks IκBα degradation in response to TNF stimulation (see “Discussion”). Since TNF-mediated activation of NF-κB has been shown to require the IKK-induced phosphorylation of IκBα (29DiDonato J. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D. Zandi E. Karin M.

In order to measure TNF-induced IKK activity, IKK was immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts and used in an in vitro kinase assay to measure the ability of IKK to phosphorylate a GST-IκBα substrate containing serine residues 32 and 36. The specificity of the IKK assay was determined by the inability to phosphorylate a GST-IκBα S32T/S36T mutant in which serine residues 32 and 36 have been converted to threonine residues. As shown in Fig.2 B, TNF addition induced IKK activity in a time-dependent fashion in U937 cells. Maximum IKK activity in response to TNF addition was observed within 10 min, and was greatly diminished within 30 min post-TNF stimulation. However, TNF-induced IKK activity was inhibited by IL-10, with peak effects at 5 and 10 min post-TNF stimulation (Fig. 2 B). Note that the quantification of relative IKK activity shown in Fig. 2 B is derived from comparison to time T0' and is not a direct comparison of IKK activity between the two experimental conditions at a particular time point. The ability of TNF to induce IKK activity was specific for serine residues 32 and 36, since the GST-IκBα S32T/S36T mutant could not be phosphorylated in the kinase assays (Fig. 2 B). Although similar kinetics of TNF-induced IKK activity were seen in both THP-1 and U937 cells (Fig. 2, B, C, and D), the inhibitory effects of IL-10 in THP-1 cells (Fig. 2"

O-GlcNAc is an abundant intracellular posttranslational modification consisting of a single N-acetylglucosamineO-linked to serine/threonine residues. Unlike other carbohydrate modifications, O-GlcNAc is not further modified and is found almost exclusively in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Since it was first described in lymphocytes (1Torres C.R. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3308-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) O-GlcNAc has been found on an ever increasing number of proteins, including RNA polymerase II and its transcription factors, nuclear pore proteins, tumor suppressor proteins, intermediate filaments, viral proteins, and oncoproteins (reviewed in Refs. 2Hart G.W.

O-GlcNAc is an abundant and dynamic modification exhibiting properties more like phosphorylation than typical N- and O-linked glycosylation (2Hart G.W. Kreppel L.K. Comer F.C. Arnold C.S. Snow D.S.

The O-GlcNAc modification (termedO-GlcNAcylation) has been suggested to play a direct role in regulating a number of cellular functions including protein synthesis (6Datta B. Ray M.K. Chakrabarti D.

In our laboratory, we have purified and characterized both a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:peptideN-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase (O-GlcNAc transferase) (12Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2563-2568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) specific for the attachment of O-GlcNAc to proteins and a solubleN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase) (13Dong D.L.-Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) specific for the removal ofO-GlcNAc from proteins. These enzymes may work together to regulate the attachment and removal of O-GlcNAc in response to cellular signals in much the same way that kinases and phosphatases regulate protein phosphorylation. Although significant progress has been made in our understanding of the distribution of O-GlcNAc in the cell, little is known about how the attachment of O-GlcNAc to proteins is regulated. The problem is significant because numerous proteins areO-GlcNAcylated, many at more then one site. A further complexity is added by the lack of a canonical consensus site for the attachment of O-GlcNAc to proteins (4Snow D.M. Hart G.W. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 181: 43-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. Fukuda M. Hindsgaul O. Molecular and Cellular Glycobiology: Frontiers in Molecular Biology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). Additionally, theO-GlcNAc modification turns over more rapidly then the protein backbone (14Chou C.-F. Smith A.J. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3901-3906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Roquemore E.P. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Hart G.W.

Thus the cell must regulate not only which proteins to modify withO-GlcNAc but also which site(s) on a protein to modify in response to specific cellular signals. The gene encoding the catalytic subunit of an O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) 1The abbreviations used are:OGTO-GlcNAc transferaseTPRtetratricopeptide repeatPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was recently cloned and characterized from rat (18Kreppel L.K.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9316-9324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The protein (p110) encoded by this gene represents a novel glycosyltransferase that has a unique cellular distribution and shares no sequence or structural similarity to any previously described secretory glycosyltransferase (20Field M.C. Wainwright L.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene encoding OGT is found in all higher eukaryotes examined and has been highly conserved throughout evolution. It is modified by O-GlcNAc and tyrosine phosphorylation, which may play a role in the regulation of the OGT. Further examination of the protein sequence indicate that p110 can be divided into two distinct domains, the amino-terminal half of the protein containing multiple tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) and the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein representing a novel polypeptide believed to contain the catalytic portion of the enzyme. TPRs are found in a large number of proteins of diverse function and play a role in modulating a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle (22Hirano T. Kinoshita N. Morikawa K. Yanagida M.

Thus, the TPR domain of p110 may represent a protein interaction domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions that regulate enzymatic activity. O-GlcNAc transferase tetratricopeptide repeat polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis In this paper, we begin to address the question of how the cell regulates the attachment of O-GlcNAc by further characterizing the p110 subunit of the OGT cloned from rat liver. Using the insect cell baculovirus system to overexpress p110, we show that it is the catalytic subunit of the enzyme and that different portions of the TPR domain are required for multimerization of the OGT and for enzymatic activity. We also find that recombinant p110 contains the same posttranslational modifications as p110 purified from rat. Kinetic studies suggest that OGT functions through a random bi-bi kinetic mechanism and that the protein has three distinct binding constants for the UDP-GlcNAc sugar donor. In addition we find that binding of UDP-GlcNAc is regulated by multimerization of the enzyme. These data suggest that multimerization and the intracellular concentration as well as binding of UDP-GlcNAc are among the mechanisms regulating OGT activity in vivo. Peptides were synthesized on a Perseptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA) automated peptide synthesizer and purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Prepacked Superose 12 PC 3.2/30, and Hi-Trap Chelating columns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Uridine diphospho-N-acetyl[6-3H]glucosamine (50 Ci/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine was from Oxford Glycosystems (Oxford, UK). Ultrafree Centrifugal Filter Devices were from Millipore Inc. All other reagents were of the highest quality available. Restriction endonuclease digestions and ligations were carried out as described (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). Plasmids were isolated using Wizard Prep Kits (Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. Sequence information of the various fusion clones was obtained by automated DNA sequencing on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 373A automated DNA sequencer. The 5′-untranslated region of the previously cloned full-length cDNA fragment (18Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) was removed by digestion withBsaHI and replaced with a linker adaptor (CGCGATCCGCGATGG), which adds a BamHI linker upstream of the restored ATG. The full coding region was excised by digestion with BamHI andHindIII and ligated into pBlueBacHis A (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid (pLK59) was recombined in vivo into baculovirus using the Bac-N-Blue Transfection kit (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's protocol resulting in the viral strain VLK59. Five oligonucleotides were synthesized (GGATCCGCAATTGAGACGCAACCAAACTTT = Δ3 forward, GGATCCGCTATAGAACTGCAGCCTCATTTC=Δ6 forward, GGATCCGCCATAAGAATCAGTCCTACATT =Δ9 forward, GGATCCCCTGATGCTTATTGTAACTTGGCT = Δ11 forward, and GTGTACCCATTCATATTGACAAGG = TPR domain reverse), and polymerase chain reaction was carried out in 50-μl reactions containing 2 ηg of plasmid pLK36, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 200 μm dNTPs, 0.8 μm each primer, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). The DNA was amplified in a DNA Thermal Cycler (MJ Research Inc.) for 30 cycles using a denaturation temperature of 92 °C (1 min), an annealing temperature of 63 °C (2 min), and an elongation temperature of 72 °C (2 min). The polymerase chain reaction products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) gel purified using a silica suspension (32Boyle J.S. Lew A.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction fragments were double digested withBamHI and BsrBI or BglI andBsrBI and ligated into pLK59 that had been prepared by double digesting with BamHI and BsrBI and gel purifying the large fragment containing the vector and carboxyl-terminal portion of the p110 protein. The resulting plasmids (pLK72, pLK73, pLK74, and pLK75) were used to prepare recombinant baculovirus as described above resulting in viral strains VLK72, VLK73, VLK74, and VLK75, respectively. High Five (Invitrogen) insect cells were grown in TNH-FH medium, which consists of Graces's insect medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, to midlog (∼5 × 105 cells/ml) and infected at an multiplicity of infection of 5–10 plaque-forming units/cell and incubated for 40–48 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and cell pellets were frozen at −20 °C. Infected cell pellets were resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl) and lysed by sonication (2 × 30 s pulses power 3.5 with a 550 Sonic Dismembrator; Fisher Scientific). Lysates were spun for 30 min at 30,000 × g, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and loaded at a flow rate of 1 ml/min onto a 1-ml Hi-Trap chelating column precharged with NiSO4 as per the manufacturer's instructions and pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with ∼20 column volumes buffer A, followed by a 10-ml wash at 5% buffer B and then eluted with a 25-min linear gradient 5–100% buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 100 mmimidazole) at 1 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml) were collected throughout the separation were assayed for activity as described below. The fractions were also examined by SDS-PAGE followed by visualization with Coomassie G-250 staining (33Neuhoff V. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar) or by Western blot analysis (see below). The most pure active fractions were pooled and concentrated using an ultra-free 15 concentrator as per manufacturer's directions. Buffer was exchanged by resuspending the concentrate in 12 ml of buffer F (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and concentrating again. The concentrate was removed, and the concentrator was rinsed with 0.5 ml of buffer. The pooled concentrate (∼600 μl) was brought to 40% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol and stored at −20 °C. Activity assays were performed as described previously (34Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Because the nickel affinity purified enzyme is concentrated in a salt-free buffer, the enzyme is assayed directly without desalting. For the assays described here the enzyme was diluted 1:25 with cold desalt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 20% glycerol, 0.02% NaN3) just prior to use, and the reactions were started with the addition of 25 μl of the diluted enzyme mix. In addition to the previously described peptide substrate YSDSPSTST (9-mer peptide), an additional peptide PGGSTPVSSANMM (CKII peptide) was used for kinetic analysis. A number of other peptides were also used (see Fig.6 A). All peptides were used at a final concentration of 3 mm unless otherwise noted. The peptides were eluted from the SP-Sephadex (SP-C25–120, Sigma) with 1 ml of 1 m NaCl. When noted the peptides were cleaned up after the reaction on a Sep-pak C18 cartridge (Waters Corp.) as follows: cartridge was washed with 10 ml of methanol, 10 ml of 50 mm formic acid, the reaction was then loaded onto the cartridge, and the cartridge was washed with 10 ml of 50 mm formic acid, 10 ml of 50 mmformic acid containing 0.5 m NaCl, and 10 ml of distilled H2O. The peptides were eluted from the cartridge directly into scintillation vials with 2 × 1.5 ml of methanol. Units are defined as micromoles of GlcNAc transferred per min. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Purified rabbit polyclonal IgG AL-25 (1:5000) (18Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

Detection of the horseradish peroxidase activity was by enhanced chemiluminescence and fluorography as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nickel affinity purified recombinant enzyme (described above) was probed for terminal GlcNAc using Galβ(1–4)galactosyl-transferase and UDP-[3H]galactose as described (35Roquemore E.P. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The labeled protein was brought to 1 ml with RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.15, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% NaDOC) and incubated with AL-25 IgG (18Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) on ice for 3 h. The IgGs were then precipitated with protein A-Sepharose CL4-B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resin was washed extensively in RIPA buffer followed by a wash in 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8. The resin was then resuspended to equivalent volumes in either SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on a 7.5% SDS-acrylamide gel, and proteins tagged with [3H]galactose were detected by fluorography of the gel treated with 1 m sodium salicylate. A portion (50 μl) of the nickel affinity purified recombinant enzyme was further concentrated by centrifugation in an Ultrafree-0.5 concentrator and exchanged into buffer F containing either 150 mm NaCl or 1 m NaCl. The concentrate was then loaded onto a Superose 12 column using a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Smart fast protein liquid chromatography system equilibrated in buffer F containing either 150 mm NaCl or 1 m NaCl using a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Smart fast protein liquid chromatography system, and the protein was eluted at 15 μl/min. The absorbance at 280 nm was followed, and 25-μl fractions were collected that were assayed for activity, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by visualization with Coomassie G-250 staining (33Neuhoff V. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar) or by Western blot analysis (see above). In separate runs standards were loaded onto the column to calculate the apparent molecular weight values. The Km values for both the CKII and 9-mer peptides were performed at 2.5 μm UDP-GlcNAc, and concentrations of peptide were varied from 5 μm to 15 mm, and the Km values were determined by Eadie-Scatchard analysis (data not shown). Further kinetic studies were performed using only the CKII peptide. To determine theKm for UDP-GlcNAc across the full spectrum of concentrations from 0.05 μm to 4.8 mm, similar analysis were performed using the CKII peptide at 3 mm final concentration. The UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc was cold diluted from 50 Ci/mmol to either 0.2 Ci/mmol for the lower concentration of UDP-GlcNAc or to 0.02 Ci/mmol at the higher concentrations of UDP-GlcNAc. Addition kinetic studies were performed to obtain the true Km, Vmax, and Kd values for both UDP-GlcNAc (at low concentrations) and the CKII peptide. In these studies one substrate was varied while the other was held constant. The UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc was cold diluted from 50 Ci/mmol to 2 Ci/mmol for these studies. The Km andVmax values were then determined with the aid of the computer program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software) that uses a linear regression method. The Vmax andKm numbers were then reploted as both reciprocal and double reciprocal plots to give the true Vmaxand Km numbers as well as the Kd values and the constant α. All assays were performed in duplicate, and each experiment was performed at least twice. Photolabeling studies on the OGT purified from rat liver cytosol (34Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the p110 subunit was the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. To confirm this hypothesis a His6 tag was added to the amino-terminal end of the p110 cDNA, and the tagged p110 subunit (His-p110) was overexpressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system (see “Experimental Procedures”). The His-tagged protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography. A typical purification is shown in Fig. 1. The purification of a band at 117 kDa (the size of the p110 subunit with the addition of the His6 tag) can be followed by Coomassie R-250 staining (asterisk in Fig. 1 A). The purified band at 117 kDa is recognized by the anti-OGT antibody, AL-25 (Fig. 1 B), confirming the identity of the 117-kDa protein as the p110 subunit of the OGT and demonstrating that the highly related p78 subunit is not present. OGT activity co-purifies with the 117-kDa band (Fig. 1 C), demonstrating that the p110 subunit of the enzyme is the catalytic subunit of the enzyme and is active in the absence of the p78 subunit. A typical purification yielded ∼150–300 μg of total protein giving a 5000–8000-fold purification. Note that the band visible in Fig. 1 A at ∼70 kDa is an unrelated protein that is not recognized by the AL-25 antibody. This 70-kDa band is also purified from mock or wild type baculovirus-infected cells and has no OGT activity (data not shown), indicating that it is not an insect cell OGT and that it interacts directly with the nickel affinity column and not with the His-p110 protein. The specific activity (1.23 nmol/min/mg) of the purified His-p110 is comparable with OGT purified from liver (1.11 nmol/min/mg), and theKm for the YSDSPSTST (9-mer) peptide is the same (10 mm) for both enzymes. In addition the recombinant p110, like the liver OGT, exists as a trimer (described below) and bears the same posttranslational modifications present on liver purified OGT (described below). These data indicate that the His-p110 subunit expressed and purified from insect cells is a good model for studying the mechanism(s) regulating OGT activity. OGT purified from liver is a heterotrimer composed of two p110 subunits and one highly related p78 subunit with an apparent molecular weight of 340 kDa (34Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent molecular weight of His-p110 was determined by gel filtration chromatography at both physiological salt concentrations (150 mm) and high salt concentrations (1 m). At both salt concentrations the apparent molecular weight was ∼360 kDa, indicating that the His-p110 is a homotrimer and that the subunits are tightly associated. The absorbance at A280 and activity profiles at 1 m NaCl are shown in Fig.2 A. Although the homotrimer is not found in liver it may represent the subunit composition of native OGT in tissues that do not contain the p78 subunit (18Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Note that the contaminating 70-kDa band separates from the His-p110 under these conditions and that no other protein co-migrates with the His-p110 protein by G-250 Coomassie staining (data not shown). The amino-terminal half of the p110 subunit contains 11 tandem TPRs (18Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). TPRs are involved in modulating specific protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the TPR domain of p110 is responsible for the subunit interactions. To address this possibility and to determine whether the TPR domain is required for OGT activity, a series of amino-terminal deletion constructs removing 3, 6, 9, or all 11 TPRs were made. These constructs (referred to as pΔ3 pΔ6, pΔ9, and pΔ11 respectively) were expressed in insects cells and purified as described for the His-p110 construct (data not shown). The specific activity and size of each construct was determined as described above (summarized in Fig. 3). The specific activities of pΔ3 and pΔ6 were similar (1.17 and 1.06 nmol/min/mg, respectively) to His-p110 (1.23 nmol/min/mg) indicating that only five TPRs are required for activity. pΔ9 and pΔ11 had no detectable activity (<0.002 nmol/min/mg); however, neither of the inactive constructs were expressed well in our system, and the large amounts of degraded protein present indicate that these truncated proteins are unstable and may not be folded correctly. Further studies were done only on the pΔ9 protein as it was slightly more stable then the pΔ11 protein. pΔ3 runs as a trimer (apparent molecular weight, ∼290 kDa) at physiological salt concentrations (Fig. 2 B). However, at high salt concentrations (1 m NaCl) pΔ3 runs as a dimer (apparent molecular weight, ∼175) (indicated by theasterisk in Fig. 2 B), indicating that the full complement of TPRs play a role in stabilizing subunit interactions. Interestingly both the active pΔ6 and the inactive pΔ9 are monomers (apparent molecular weights, ∼90 and ∼70 kDa, respectively) at both high salt (data not shown) and at physiological salt concentrations (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, trimerization is not necessary for OGT activity in our standard assay. The purified p110 is modified by both tyrosine phosphorylation and byO-GlcNAc. We wanted to examine the posttranslational modification state of the His-p110 as well as several of the deletion constructs. Western blot analysis of the nickel affinity purified proteins using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody shows that both the His-p110 and pΔ6 but not the inactive pΔ9 are immunoreactive. This reactivity is blocked by the addition of 10 mmphosphotyrosine (Fig. 4 A) but not 10 mm tyrosine (data not shown). Similar experiments using antibodies against phosphoserine and phosphothreonine showed no immunoreactivity (data not shown). Densitometry analysis indicates that His-p110 and pΔ6 are phosphorylated to a similar degree (data not shown); however, exact quantitation of the modification is not possible using this methodology. We also probed these proteins with galactosyltransferase (see “Experimental Procedures”). Galactosyltransferase is a specific probe for terminal GlcNAc resides (35Roquemore E.P. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 36Haltiwanger R.S. Hart G.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 14: 175-187PubMed Google Scholar) that is commonly used to detect O-GlcNAc by covalently labeling the GlcNAc with UDP-[3H]galactose. Following the galactosyltransferase labeling the proteins were further purified by immuoprecipitation with the AL-25 antibody. All three recombinant proteins are labeled with [3H]galactose (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–3), indicating that they are modified by GlcNAc. The level ofO-GlcNAc modification detected here is substoichiometric with approximately 0.1 O-GlcNAc residue/protein molecule for each construct examined. However, exact quantitation of theO-GlcNAc modification is complicated by many factors including the ability of the modification during purification and accessibility to the galactosyltransferase (35Roquemore E.P. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to keep in mind that this value reflects a lower limit and the exact level of O-GlcNAcylation may be somewhat higher. It was previously reported that the Km for UDP-GlcNAc of the purified liver enzyme was 0.5 μm. However, these studies were conducted using UDP-GlcNAc concentrations only in the low micromolar range (0.05 μm to 10 μm) and used the 9-mer acceptor peptide, which do"
https://openalex.org/W2140811295,"Expression of the pleiotropic cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 can be stimulated by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the microbial alkaloid staurosporine (STS). In this report, the transcriptional mechanisms were thoroughly investigated. Whereas transcription factors binding to the activator protein-1-, cAMP-responsive element-, and CAAT enhancer-binding protein-responsive sequences are necessary for gene activation by STS, nuclear factor (NF)-κB alone is responsible and sufficient for inducibility by TNF, which reveals distinct signaling pathways for both compounds. At the cofactor level, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) or p300 potentiate basal and induced IL-6 promoter activation via multiple protein-protein interactions with all transcription factors bound to the promoter DNA. However, the strongest promoter activation relies on the p65 NF-κB subunit, which specifically engages CBP/p300 for maximal transcriptional stimulation by its histone acetyltransferase activity. Moreover, treatment of chromatin-integrated promoter constructions with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A exclusively potentiates TNF-dependent (i.e. NF-κB-mediated) gene activation, while basal or STS-stimulated IL-6 promoter activity remains completely unchanged. Similar observations were recorded with other natural NF-κB-driven promoters, namely IL-8 and endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM). We conclude that, within an “enhanceosome-like” structure, NF-κB is the central mediator of TNF-induced IL-6 gene expression, involving CBP/p300 and requiring histone acetyltransferase activity.

Among its many functions, IL-6 plays an active role in immunological responses, bone metabolism, reproduction, inflammation, neoplasia, and aging. Overexpression of IL-6 has been implicated in the pathology of a number of diseases including multiple myeloma, rheumatoid arthritis, Castleman's disease, psoriasis, Alzheimer's disease, and postmenopausal osteoporosis. The cellular and molecular biology of IL-6 has been explored by a variety of approaches (1Gadient R.A. Otten U.H. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 52: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In view of its pleiotropic functions, studies on the regulation of IL-6 gene expression may be of prior importance. The characterization of the IL-6 promoter revealed a complex control region that can be triggered by multiple activation pathways (2Dendorfer U. Oettgen P. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4443-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 3Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Boone E. De Bosscher K. Schmitz M.L. Fiers W. Haegeman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). In the case of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), the main transcriptional activator for IL-6 gene induction is the nuclear factor NF-κB, which is typically a dimer between p50 and the transactivating subunit p65 (RelA). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB resides in the cytoplasm, bound to its inhibitor IκB. After cell stimulation, NF-κB is released from IκB and migrates into the nucleus, where it induces gene expression after DNA binding (4May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Access of NF-κB complexes is partially blocked by the constitutive occupancy of the IL-6-κB site by the recombination signal sequence-binding protein (RBP)-Jκ, which is involved in the constitutive repression of the IL-6 gene under normal physiological conditions (5Plaisance S. Vanden Berghe W. Boone E. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3733-3743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of IL-6 gene expression by NF-κB is probably the most important pathway. For maximum response, additional factors are also required, the most important being activator protein (AP)-1, cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and CAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) (6Keller E.T. Wanagat J. Ershler W.B. Frontiers Biosci. 1996; 1: d340-d357Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 7Koj A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1317: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). AP-1 is formed by the dimerization of Fos and Jun family members through a leucine zipper structural motif and becomes activated by mitogenic stimuli, oncoproteins, cytokines, and UV light. Another dimeric transcription factor is CREB, which binds to cAMP-responsive elements and is involved in cAMP-signaling pathways. The C/EBP family of transcription factors is involved in the expression of both acute phase cytokine genes and cytokine-inducible acute-phase proteins. interleukin activator protein cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein CAAT enhancer-binding protein cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein histone acetyltransferase histone deacetylase recombination signal sequence-binding protein steroid receptor coactivator staurosporine tumor necrosis factor trichostatin A wild-type bovine serum albumin base pair(s) electrophoretic mobility shift assay phosphate-buffered saline nuclear factor Transcription is a multistep process with many potential levels of control.

The cofactors CREB-binding protein (CBP), p300, and steroid receptor coactivator (SRC)-1 have indeed received much attention due to their promiscuous interactions with a wide range of transcription factors, such as AP-1, CREB, C/EBP, and NF-κB (10Gerritsen M.E.

In addition to their bridging function between upstream DNA-binding proteins and the basal transcription complex, some cofactors also appear to play a role in chromatin remodeling via their intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) or deacetylase (HDAC) activity (16Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 17Berger S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We have already reported on the essential role of NF-κB to trigger IL-6 gene activation in response to TNF in the mouse fibrosarcoma cell line L929sA (3Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Boone E.

In addition, we showed that staurosporine (STS) sensitizes tumor cells to TNF cytotoxicity and markedly potentiates TNF-induced IL-6 production (18Beyaert R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Heyninck K. Boone E. De Valck D. Schulze-Osthoff K. Haegeman G. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2623-2630PubMed Google Scholar). In the present paper, we further studied the transcriptional mechanisms of TNF- and STS-mediated IL-6 gene activation. We focused on the functional interaction between TNF- or STS-responsive DNA-bound factors and the cofactor CBP/p300 in the IL-6 promoter context. The relation between cofactor-dependent HAT activity and IL-6 promoter stimulation was further explored with a HAT-defective p300 variant and with the potent HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). Finally, we also extend our observations to other NF-κB-containing promoters. Murine fibrosarcoma L929sA cells and human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum, 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. 24 h before induction, cells were seeded in multiwell dishes such that they were confluent at the time of the experiment.

Transient transfection of HEK293T cells was performed with Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, approximately 5 × 104 exponentially growing HEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates 24 h before transfection. After appropriate mixing of Fugene with the DNA plasmids of interest, transfection mixtures (containing a total amount of 500 ng of DNA) were added to each well and left on the cells for 24 h, after which medium was refreshed and cells were further used in induction experiments 60 h after transfection. Total amounts of expression vectors were kept constant in all set-ups by using an empty vector DNA. All experiments were carried out at least in triplicate. L929sA cells were seeded in dishes at 5 × 105 cells/dish at day −1. After appropriate induction, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested with a rubber policeman and pelleted in 15 ml PBS by centrifugation for 5 min at 1100 × g. Lysate preparation and EMSAs were performed essentially as described previously (5Plaisance S. Vanden Berghe W. Boone E. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3733-3743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding sequences for appropriate EMSAs comprised the oligonucleotides 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′ (AP-1), 5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′ (CREB), 5′-TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCA-3′ (C/EBP), and 5′-AGCTATGTGGGATTTTCCCATGAGC-3′ (NF-κB). For competition assays, extracts were incubated with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled over labeled oligonucleotide. For supershift analysis, anti-p50, anti-p65, anti-CREB, anti-C/EBPβ, anti-C/EBPδ, anti-c-Fos, and anti-c-Jun antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were added to the extracts 15 min before addition of the probe. The immunoprecipitation conditions were essentially as described previously (10Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). 3 × 105 cells were seeded in six-well plates on day 1. 40 h after transfection of the various expression plasmids, 150 μg of protein from cell lysate was incubated with 5 μg/ml anti-p65 antibody or an irrelevant antibody as control (anti-X-press; Invitrogen) in a final reaction volume of 800 μl. After immunoprecipitation, 20 μg of protein was supplemented with Laemmli buffer and loaded on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis. Following blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes, samples were subjected to Western analysis with anti-CBP antibody and, after stripping, with anti-p65 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown on coverslips for 48 h. Serum-deprived cells (24 h in 0.5% serum) were stimulated for 2 h, after which cells were washed with pBSA and fixed for 1 min in 95% methanol, 5% acetic acid at room temperature. Following fixation, cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated for 1 h in PBS + 8% BSA. Incubations with primary antisera started overnight at 4 °C, using rabbit polyclonal anti-acetylated histone-4 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) diluted up to 10 μg/ml in pBSA + 1% BSA. Coverslips were washed twice in pBSA for 5 min, after which cells were incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG biotin-conjugated antibody at 1/100 in PBS, 1% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with pBSA, marker IgG (streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate 1/100 dilution in pBSA + 10% BSA) was added for 1 h. Coverslips were finally washed three times for 15 min, after which cells were examined under a fluorescent microscope. Images were recorded using a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope coupled to a CCD video camera. Captured images were processed by MacProbe 3.4 video software. Cell lysates were assayed for luciferase and galactosidase reporter gene activities as described previously (3Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Boone E. De Bosscher K. Schmitz M.L. Fiers W. Haegeman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). All promoter activities are expressed as “induction factor,” i.e. the ratio of expression levels recorded either under induced and noninduced conditions, or under transfected and mock-transfected conditions. The supernatant of L929sA cells was tested for the presence of secreted IL-6 in response to TNF or STS or to their combination. Elevated levels of IL-6 protein were detected after TNF or STS treatment; a synergistic effect was observed after TNF + STS treatment (Fig.1 A). To verify whether the increase in IL-6 protein levels was due to transcriptional regulation at the promoter level, the IL-6 promoter reporter gene p1168hu.IL6P-luc+ and the internal control plasmid pPGKβGeobpA were stably transfected in L929sA cells. The resulting stable cell pool was identically treated, and the lysates were assayed for corresponding reporter gene activity (Fig. 1 B). Enhanced luciferase expression levels were measured in response to TNF or STS alone; they increased synergistically after a combined treatment, thus mimicking endogenous IL-6 gene regulation. This shows that the necessary and appropriate regulatory elements for IL-6 promoter activation are present in the 1168-bp promoter fragment used. However, the stronger TNF response at the IL-6 protein level as compared with that obtained with the IL-6 promoter-driven reporter gene may be explained by a combination of transcriptional effects (3Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Boone E. De Bosscher K. Schmitz M.L. Fiers W. Haegeman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) and posttranscriptional events (27Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E39-E40Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The specificity of the observed regulatory effects is further demonstrated by the internal control, which remained unaffected by the different stimulating agents used. EMSAs with L929sA cell extracts showed constitutive binding complexes for AP-1-, CRE-, and C/EBP-specific probes, irrespective of any stimulation with TNF or STS. The specificity of these complexes was further demonstrated by competition and/or supershift analysis (Fig. 2). On the other hand, TNF activated a specific doublet of NF-κB complexes, but the amount of constitutively binding factor RBP-Jκ remained unchanged. However, no quantitative alterations of the complexes involved were observed after treatment with STS. Similar results were obtained in HEK293T cells (data not shown). Since (reversible) phosphorylation of the transcription factors may have important implications in functionality and transactivation capacity (28Calkhoven C.F. Ab G. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we further focused on reporter gene analysis. After transfection of various IL-6 promoter mutants in L929sA cells, the resulting stable pools were assayed for their responsivity to TNF and STS (Fig. 3). After truncation of the IL-6 promoter from the 5′ end, a fairly decreased inducibility by STS is observed in the 234-bp promoter lacking the AP-1 site, as compared with the full-size fragment; moreover, the inducibility by STS is completely lost in the 110- and 50-bp IL-6 promoter variants, in which the three upstream sequence elements for AP-1, CREB and C/EBP are lacking (Fig. 3, STS). The inducibility by TNF, however, remains fairly similar for the different deletion variants, except for p50hu.IL6P-luc+, in which the NF-κB motif is absent (Fig. 3, TNF). These results clearly point at different activation mechanisms after stimulation of the IL-6 promoter by TNF or STS. In order to further characterize the contribution of defined sequence elements, different point-mutated IL-6 promoter variants were also tested for their responsivity to TNF or STS. As far as TNF treatment is concerned, only the specific mutation affecting the NF-κB motif abolished TNF inducibility (Fig. 3, TNF); however, the same mutation had no effect at all on activation by STS (Fig. 3, STS). It appears that regulatory elements other than the NF-κB motif are involved in the responsivity to STS, since single mutations of the AP-1, CREB, or C/EBP elements partially affect the inducibility by STS and point at a redundancy in the activation mechanism. Treatment with TNF + STS confirmed the observations made with TNF and STS alone, and resulted in a superposition of both separate profiles; mutations in the AP-1, CRE, C/EBP, or NF-κB motif all drastically affect the synergistic effect of TNF + STS (Fig. 3, TNF + STS). Additional evidence for the specific role of NF-κB in TNF inducibility and of AP-1 or CREB in responsivity to STS was obtained from reporter gene variants containing multimerized synthetic responsive sequences for AP-1, CREB, or NF-κB in front of an unresponsive minimal promoter. Whereas the NF-κB reporter construct exclusively responds to TNF and not to STS, the CRE and AP-1 reporter constructs respond to STS but not to TNF (Fig.4). Since interaction of CBP, p300, and SRC-1 with various IL-6 promoter-binding factors has already been demonstrated, we tested the functional implication of the p50 and p65 NF-κB subunits together with CBP, p300, or SRC-1 in activating 1168hu.IL6P-luc+ (Fig.5 A). To avoid interference of signaling cascades with the expression levels of transgenes controlled by cytomegalovirus- or Rous sarcoma virus-driven promoters (29Bruening W. Giasson B. Mushynski W. Durham H.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), experiments were performed in the absence of TNF or STS. As a matter of fact, transcription factor interactions with CBP can be achieved in the absence of appropriate stimuli, since transient transfection by itself enhances constitutive kinase activities (30Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). While basal IL-6 promoter activity is clearly induced after overexpression of p65, overexpression of p50 does not affect the promoter activity. This is in complete agreement with the presence and absence of transactivation domains in the p65 and p50 subunits, respectively. Furthermore, we detected a synergistic promoter activation of 20–30-fold after cotransfection of p65 with p300 or CBP, but a very weak activation only with p50. On the other hand, SRC-1 cotransfection marginally enhanced basal IL-6 promoter activity with p50, but not with p65. It may be noted that IL-6 promoter stimulation with p300 or CBP alone, i.e. in the absence of p65, also enhances reporter gene activity (3–5-fold), since AP-1, CREB, and C/EBP are constitutively bound to their corresponding responsive elements and have been shown to also interact with CBP/p300. Extra supply of the AP-1 subunit c-Jun (in addition to the endogenous amounts of c-Jun present) under transfection conditions identical to those used for p65 does not further enhance basal or CBP-stimulated IL-6 promoter activity. This experiment demonstrates a potent and specific role for p65 in coactivator effects with CBP/p300 within the IL-6 promoter context and to their strong cooperative activity in transcriptional stimulation. To assess the physical interaction between p65 and CBP, cells transfected with pRSV-p65 and/or pCMV-CBP were subjected to coimmunoprecipitation analysis with anti-p65 antibody, followed by Western analysis with anti-CBP (Fig. 5 B). p65 is able to trap CBP from the cell lysate (lane 5), which suggests a strong and distinct interaction between these two factors. Membranes were subsequently stripped and reprobed with anti-p65 antibody to verify equal amounts of immunoprecipitated p65 protein (data not shown). We further analyzed the relative contribution of CBP interactions with AP-1, C/EBP, CREB, or NF-κB in basal or p65-driven IL-6 gene expression. Mutation of the AP-1- or CREB-responsive elements clearly shows a decreased CBP-mediated effect on basal promoter activity, while mutations in the C/EBP or NF-κB elements are less pronounced (Fig.6). Consequently, a further reduction of CBP effects is observed in the double mutants AP-1-CRE or CRE-C/EBP. The role of CBP interactions in the activated state of the IL-6 promoter was also analyzed. Mimicking NF-κB activation by overexpression of p65 consistently increased the IL-6 promoter activity, whereas mutation of the NF-κB motif abolished the induction (none of the other mutations affected p65-mediated transactivation). Coexpression of p65 and CBP resulted in a strong synergistic up-regulation of IL-6 promoter activity with the wt promoter and the different promoter variants; this was not the case for the NF-κB mutant, where the synergistic effect is totally absent and where the induction level is similar to the promoter activity in the presence of CBP alone. Since promoter activation after coexpression of CBP and p65 also includes CBP effects with the constitutively bound factors, the various mutations in the AP-1, CRE, and/or C/EBP motifs correspondingly reduce the level of promoter activation; the synergism, however, between p65 and CBP (i.e. the activity of cotransfected CBP and p65 versus CBP alone) remains constant (5-fold). These data suggest that CBP is settled in the IL-6 promoter complex by multiple protein-protein interactions with different transcription factors bound constitutively or activated by external stimuli. Several characterized transcriptional adaptors and cofactors, including CBP/p300, have been recognized to be HATs. Since we sh"

Indeed, the similarities in overall structure and receptor binding indicate that VEGF-D and VEGF-C form a subfamily within the vascular endothelial growth factors.

The degree of processing of VEGF-C serves to modulate the receptor specificity of the protein, e.g. the fully processed form binds VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 whereas partially processed forms bind only VEGFR-3. Likewise, we have shown previously that a recombinant form of VEGF-D, consisting only of the VHD, is capable of binding and activating both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 (3Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Mäkinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). However, it was not known if VEGF-D is proteolytically processed to give rise to a form consisting only of the VHD. In this study we demonstrate that VEGF-D is proteolytically processed to generate the bioactive VHD region. The fully processed form of VEGF-D consists only of the VHD and exists predominantly in the form of a non-covalent dimer. This material has greatly increased affinity for VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 when compared with the full-length VEGF-D. In addition, analysis of the distribution of VEGF-D mRNA by in situ hybridization demonstrated that the VEGF-D gene is strongly expressed in lung during mouse embryonic development. We were able to identify processed forms of VEGF-D in embryonic mouse lung, indicating that VEGF-D protein is processed in vivo. 293EBNA cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 mml-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin (supplements) in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2. Ba/F3 cells transfected with the VEGFR-2/Epo receptor chimera were maintained in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 mml-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 10% (v/v) WEHI-3D conditioned medium (a source of interleukin-3), and 1 mg/ml G418 in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2. A polyclonal antiserum, designated A2, was raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide comprising human VEGF-D residues 190–205 in the VHD (KCLPTAPRHPYSIIRR) (Fig. 1). The numbering used is as defined previously (3Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Mäkinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). The human VEGF-D cDNA used in this study has been described elsewhere (3Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Mäkinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). DNA fragments encoding various derivatives of VEGF-D were generated from this cDNA by PCR with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and were subsequently cloned into pEFBOS-S-FLAG or pEFBOS-I-FLAG expression vectors (kindly supplied by Clare MacFarlane, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia) in order to generate VEGF-D polypeptides, which were tagged with the FLAG octapeptide (IBI/Kodak, New Haven, CT). The constructs were designed to encode the VHD with FLAG at the N terminus (VEGF-DΔNΔC-FLAG), the full-length VEGF-D with an N-terminal FLAG sequence (VEGF-D-FULL-N-FLAG), the full-length VEGF-D with a C-terminal FLAG sequence (VEGF-D-FULL-C-FLAG), and a derivative with the C-terminal polypeptide extension removed and replaced with FLAG (VEGF-DΔC-FLAG) (see Fig. 1). The construct for VEGF-DΔNΔC-FLAG, previously designated as VEGF-DΔNΔC, has been described in detail elsewhere (3Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Mäkinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). In the construct for VEGF-D-FULL-N-FLAG, DNA encoding the VEGF-D signal sequence for protein secretion had been deleted and substituted with DNA encoding the IL-3 signal sequence, followed by the FLAG octapeptide and two amino acids (Thr-Arg) immediately upstream and in the same reading frame as DNA encoding residues 24–354 of VEGF-D. In the construct for VEGF-D-FULL-C-FLAG, DNA for the endogenous VEGF-D signal sequence was retained; however, the “Kozak” consensus sequence for translation initiation had been optimized, which necessitated insertion of three amino acids (Ala-Arg-Leu) immediately after the initiation codon of VEGF-D. This construct also encoded the amino acids Ala-Arg-Gln, followed by the FLAG peptide sequence at the C terminus of the protein. The construct for VEGF-DΔC-FLAG encoded an N-terminal region identical to that of VEGF-D-FULL-C-FLAG, but the region encoding the C-terminal extension of VEGF-D (i.e.C-terminal to the VHD) had been deleted and replaced with DNA encoding the amino acids N-T-R-Q followed by an in-frame FLAG peptide, the two residues Thr-Arg, and two stop codons. Thus the sequence encoded immediately after Ile at position 202 of VEGF-D was N-T-R-Q-D-Y-K-D-D-D-D-K-T-R-STOP-STOP. Plasmid constructs were extensively sequenced to ensure no unwanted mutations were introduced. The expression cassettes were excised from all of the above plasmids with XbaI and inserted at the XbaI site of the expression vector pAPEX-3 (kindly supplied by Steve Squinto, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, New Haven, CT) for transfection into 293EBNA cells. 293EBNA cells were transfected using the CaPO4 method or with Fugene according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannhiem, Germany). Colonies were selected in 100 μg/ml hygromycin in supplemented DMEM. Expressing clones were identified by immunoprecipitation of biosynthetically labeled conditioned medium using M2 gel and analysis by SDS-PAGE. Samples containing purified VEGF-D derivatives and lysates prepared from cells in culture and from the lungs of mouse embryos essentially as described elsewhere (28Stacker S.A. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 648-655PubMed Google Scholar) were combined 1:1 with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, and resolved by SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). For reduction, samples were either treated with 2%-β-mercaptoethanol or in some instances with dithiothreitol and acetylated with iodoacetamide (IAA). Some immunoprecipitates were treated with 200 mm IAA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, for 2 h at 22 °C prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions. For Western blotting, the proteins were transferred to membrane and probed with M2 according to the manufacturer's instructions or probed with anti-rabbit Ig-horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) and developed using chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 293EBNA cells expressing VEGF-D-FULL-N-FLAG were grown to 50% confluence, washed, and incubated in medium deficient in Cys-/Met- for 30 min. Cells were then labeled for 30 min in medium containing [35S]Cys/Met at 0.25 mCi/ml. After this period the labeled cells were chased in cold medium containing 15 mg/ml cysteine and 15 mg/ml methionine for 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, 360, or 1440 min (24 h). After these time periods, the supernatants were removed from the flasks and the cellular monolayers washed twice with cold PBS. The monolayers were then lysed according to previously described methods (28Stacker S.A. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 648-655PubMed Google Scholar). The supernatants and cleared lysates were then immunoprecipitated with the A2 VEGF-D-specific antiserum and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed six times, boiled in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. VEGF-D derivatives were purified from the conditioned medium of stably transfected 293EBNA cells by affinity chromatography on M2 (anti-FLAG) gel (IBI/Kodak, New Haven, CT), with elution using the FLAG peptide, according to the manufacturer. The FLAG peptide was removed using a centrifugal concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA). In some instances proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) prior to sequencing, according to methods already described (30Ji H. Moritz R.L. Reid G.E. Ritter G. Catimel B. Nice E. Heath J.K. White S.J. Welt S. Old L.J. Burgess A.W. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). N-terminal amino acid sequencing of affinity-purified protein was carried out using a Hewlett-Packard Protein Sequencer, model G1000A (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Size exclusion chromatography was carried out by loading affinity-purified protein onto a TSKG2000SW (7.5 × 60 mm, inner diameter) column (LKB, Bromma, Sweden). The column was equilibrated with PBS. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min and 1-min fractions collected. The protein elution was monitored at 215 nm. Apparent molecular weights were determined using a calibration curve constructed from known proteins: bovine serum albumin dimer, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and trypsin inhibitor (Sigma Aldrich Pty Ltd, Australia). A bioassay was established in which Ba/F3 cells (IL-3-dependent) were stably transfected with a chimeric molecule containing the extracellular domain of mouse VEGFR-2 and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the mouse erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) (3Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Mäkinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Expression of the VEGFR-2-EpoR chimeric receptor allows the cells to survive and proliferate in the presence of ligands for VEGFR-2; in the absence of IL-3. Cells expressing the VEGFR-2-EpoR chimeric receptor (VEGFR-2 bioassay cells) were washed three times in PBS, and once in medium lacking the 10% WEHI-3D conditioned medium supplement to remove residual IL-3. Cells (103) were aliquoted into microwell plates (Nunc, Denmark) containing dilutions of either WEHI-3D conditioned medium (as source of IL-3) or VEGF-DΔNΔC-FLAG, cultured for 72 h and viable cells were then counted. The binding of VEGF-D derivatives to soluble forms of VEGF receptors was assessed using Ig fusion proteins consisting of the extracellular domains of human VEGFR-2 (VEGFR-2-Ig, Y. Gunji, Haartman Institute, Helsinki, Finland) or VEGFR-3 (VEGFR-3-Ig, K. Pajusola, Biotechnology Institute, Helsinki, Finland) and the Fc portion of human IgG1. 293EBNA cells expressing VEGF-D derivatives were labeled with [35S]Cys/Met for 4 h and the conditioned medium was immunoprecipitated with the Ig fusion proteins, eluted in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, and resolved by SDS-PAGE as described previously (3Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Mäkinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Purified extracellular domains of VEGFR-2 (mouse VEGFR-2-FLAG) 2Stacker, S. A., Vitali, A., Caesar, C., Domagala, T., Groenen, L. C., Nice, E., Achen, M. G., and Wilks, A. F. (1999) J. Biol. Chem., in press.and human VEGFR-3 (VEGFR-3-Ig) were coupled to the carboxymethylated dextran layer of a sensor chip using standard amine coupling chemistry for analysis of the binding kinetics using a BIAcore 2000 optical biosensor (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) (31Nice E.C. Catimel B. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The residual activated ester groups were blocked by treatment with 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5, followed by washing with 10 mmdiethylamine to remove non-covalently bound material. Samples for analysis were diluted in HBS running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20). The integrity of the bound VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 was assessed by binding of purified VEGF and VEGF-DΔNΔC-FLAG. Data was analyzed using BIAevaluation 3.0 (BIACORE, Uppsala, Sweden) assuming a 1:1 Langmuirian model. Biosynthetically labeled VEGF-DΔNΔC-FLAG was cross-linked according to a previously described method (27Joukov V. Sorsa T. Kumar V. Jeltsch M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao Y. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3898-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293EBNA cells expressing VEGF-DΔNΔC-FLAG were metabolically labeled with [35S]Cys/Met as described above, and the secreted proteins were collected in medium lacking serum. Half of the sample was supplemented with 1 mm2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (DSS) and allowed to cross-link at room temperature for 1 h. As control, the other half of the sample was treated in the same way, but in the absence of DSS. VEGF-DΔNΔC-FLAG was immunoprecipitated from the samples using the A2 VEGF-D-specific antiserum and protein A-Sepharose, washed, and eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were then analyzed under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE. In situ hybridization was carried out as described elsewhere (32Lints T.J. Hartley L. Parsons L.M. Harvey R.P. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 205: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. RNA probes were prepared by in vitrotranscription using a combination of 35S-UTP and35S-CTP (1250 Ci/mmol). Prior to hybridization, tissue sections were pretreated with proteinase K (2–40 μg/ml, optimized for embryonic age) for 30 min at room temperature, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and treated with 0.25% (v/v) acetic anhydride in 0.1m triethylammonium hydrochloride, pH 8.0, for 10 min. The sections were incubated with a standard hybridization buffer containing 6 × 104 cpm/μl RNA probe in humidified chambers at 52 °C for 16–18 h. For autoradiographic detection, the slides were exposed to Kodak NTB-2 nuclear emulsion at 4 °C for 3 weeks, developed in Kodak D-19, and counterstained with Weigert's iron hematoxylin. The two non-overlapping antisense RNA probes were homologous to the regions of mouse VEGF-D cDNA encoding from amino acid residues 1–85 (probe A) and 199–317 (probe B) using the amino acid numbering as published elsewhere (1Orlandini M. Marconcini L. Ferruzzi R. Oliviero S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11675-11680Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In addition to encoding the N-terminal 85 amino acids of VEGF-D, probe A also contained 80 nucleotides of the 5′-untranslated region immediately upstream from the translation start codon. Specificity of hybridization was confirmed using sense RNA probes. The observation that the VHD of VEGF-D is sufficient to bind and activate VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 suggested that the primary translation product of VEGF-D, which contains long N- and C-terminal extensions in addition to the VHD, may be post-translationally processed (3Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Mäkinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). In order to investigate this possibility four plasmid constructs, VEGF-D-FULL-N-FLAG, VEGF-D-FULL-C-FLAG, VEGF-DΔC-FLAG, and VEGF-DΔNΔC-FLAG (Fig. 1), were stably transfected into 293EBNA cells, a cell line that is capable of proteolytically processing VEGF-C (27Joukov V. Sorsa T. Kumar V. Jeltsch M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao Y. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3898-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Analysis of the conditioned medium from 293EBNA cells expressing VEGF-D-FULL-N-FLAG by affinity purification with M2 gel (anti-FLAG) and SDS-PAGE allowed specific analysis of only those VEGF-D polypeptides containing the FLAG octapeptide or of derivatives bound covalently or non-covalently to the FLAG-tagged polypeptides (Fig. 1). Analysis of the purified proteins under reducing conditions by silver staining revealed a species ofMr ∼53,000, the expected size of unprocessed VEGF-D, as well as polypeptides of ∼31,000 and ∼29,000 (Fig.2 A). This result is consistent with proteolytic cleavage events occurring near the C terminus of the VHD. According to such a model, the Mr ∼53,000 polypeptide would represent unprocessed VEGF-D and theMr ∼31,000 polypeptide would consist of the N-terminal propeptide and the VHD (i.e. lacking the C-terminal propeptide). The expected size of a polypeptide consisting of the N-terminal propeptide and the VHD is indeed ofMr ∼31,000 because the VHD, which is glycosylated, was shown previously to be of Mr∼21,000 (3Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Mäkinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar) and the expected size of the FLAG-tagged N-terminal propeptide is of Mr ∼10,000. If processing of VEGF-D involves cleavage at the N terminus as well as the C terminus of the VHD, cells expressing VEGF-D-FULL-N-FLAG should also produce aMr ∼10,000 FLAG-tagged polypeptide consisting only of the N-terminal extension. Although a Mr∼10,000 polypeptide was not detected among the VEGF-D derivatives secreted by these cells as assessed by silver staining (Fig.2 A), it was clearly detected by Western blot analysis of the same material using M2 antibody (Fig. 2 B). TheMr ∼29,000 polypeptide detected by silver staining was not detected in the same sample by Western blot with M2 an"

These transporters presumably assist in keeping the glutamate concentration low in the extracellular fluid of brain. Recently, Na+-dependent glutamate transport was described on the abluminal membrane of the blood-brain barrier. To determine whether the above-mentioned transporters participate in glutamate transport of the blood-brain barrier, total RNA was extracted from bovine cerebral capillaries. cDNA for EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3 was observed, indicating that mRNA was present. Western blot analysis demonstrated all three transporters were expressed on abluminal membranes, but none was detectable on luminal membranes of the blood-brain barrier. Measurement of transport kinetics demonstrated voltage dependence, K+-dependence, and an apparentKm of 14 μm (aggregate of the three transporters) at a transmembrane potential of −61 mV. Inhibition of glutamate transport was observed using inhibitors specific for EAAT2 (kainic acid and dihydrokainic acid) and EAAT3 (cysteine). The relative activity of the three transporters was found to be approximately 1:3:6 for EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3, respectively.

When its concentration in the extracellular fluid becomes elevated, glutamate can be toxic to neurons (1Choi D.W. Maulucci-Gedde M. Kriegstein A.R. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 357-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has been associated with serious brain damage (2Castillo J. Davalos A. Naveiro J. Noya M. Stroke. 1996; 27: 1060-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Therefore, the concentration of glutamate in the extracellular fluid is kept low (1–3 μmol/liter) (3Shaw P.J. Forrest V. Ince P.G. Richardson J.P. Wastell H.J. Neurodegeneration. 1995; 4: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 4Tossman U. Jonsson G. Ungerstedt U. Acta Physiol.

Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 259-294Google Scholar). A possible mechanism to maintain the low concentration in the extracellular fluid has been postulated with the finding of active glutamate transport into neurons (6Velaz-Faircloth M. McGraw T.S.

Schielke J. Welty D. Neuron. 1996; 16: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2116) Google Scholar). The role of the blood-brain barrier in this control mechanism has not yet been delineated. A major function of the blood-brain barrier is to regulate the movement of nutrients and other molecules into and out of the brain (9Brightman M.W. Reese T.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 40: 648-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1823) Google Scholar). The tight junctions connecting endothelial cells of the capillaries make most substances impermeant (9Brightman M.W. Reese T.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 40: 648-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1823) Google Scholar, 10Reese T.S. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 34: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). Therefore, only lipid-soluble substances or substances with a transport mechanism can traverse the barrier. Mechanisms may exist on the blood-brain barrier to control the influx of glutamate and possibly aid in its efflux due to its excitotoxic properties at high concentrations. Evidence of such a mechanism was first described in the mid-1970s when Oldendorf and Szabo (11Oldendorf W.H. Szabo J. Am. J. Physiol. 1976; 230: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) showed glutamate transport by the blood-brain barrier in vivo. Later, Drewes et al. (12Drewes L.R. Conway W.P. Gilboe D.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 233: E320-E325PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated a net efflux of glutamate from isolated perfused dog brains. This efflux was against a concentration gradient, suggesting that an energy-dependent transport system mediated the efflux (13Pardridge W.M.P. Filer L.J.J. Kare M.R. Garattini S. Reynolds W.A. Wurtman R.J. Glutamic acid: Advances in Biochemistry and Physiology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1979: 125-137Google Scholar). In 1985, Hutchison et al. (14Hutchison H.T. Eisenberg H.M. Haber B. Exp. Neurol. 1985; 87: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) performed glutamate transport studies on isolated microvessels. These studies showed a high affinity Na+-dependent glutamate transporter on the abluminal membrane of the blood-brain barrier. In addition to active transport on the abluminal membrane, facilitative transport of glutamate has been described across the luminal membrane (15Benrabh H. Lefauconnier J.M. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 210: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Lee W.J. Hawkins R.A. Viña J.R. Peterson D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1101-C1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), possibly to allow glutamate to move into endothelial cells or out to blood. The accumulation of this data led to two questions. What are the characteristics of the carrier(s) responsible for the high affinity glutamate transport across the blood-brain barrier, and is there more than one transporter present and active? To date, two Na+-dependent glutamate transporters have been isolated and cloned from rat brain, GLAST1(17) and GLT-1 (18Pines G. Danbolt N.C. Bjoras M. Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Eide L. Koepsell H. Storm-Mathisen J. Seeberg E. Kanner B.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar), and one transporter has been cloned from rabbit brain, EAAC1 (7Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Homologues of each of these transporters have recently been found in human brain (19Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): EAAT1 (GLAST), EAAT2 (GLT-1), and EAAT3 (EAAC1). In addition, EAAT4 (20Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) and EAAT5 (21Arriza J.L. Eliasof S. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4155-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) have been isolated and cloned from human cerebellum and retina, respectively. We focused our studies of blood-brain barrier glutamate transporters on EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3 due to their ubiquitous location in the brain. The purpose of the current experiments was to determine the Na+-dependent glutamate transporters on the blood-brain barrier and their kinetic characteristics. The results indicate that the blood-brain barrier contains at least three Na+-dependent glutamate carriers with different activities that, combined, show a high affinity for glutamate transport. Therefore, the blood-brain barrier could be the site of an important control mechanism for maintaining nontoxic levels of glutamate. l-[2,3,4-3H]Glutamic acid (60 Ci/mmol) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Glutamic acid, cysteine, valinomycin, kainic acid, dihydrokainic acid, and collagenase Type IA were bought from Sigma. The Bio-Rad protein assay was purchased from Bio-Rad. Membrane vesicles from brain endothelial cells were prepared as described previously (22Sánchez del Pino M.M. Hawkins R.A. Peterson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25951-25957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated microvessels from bovine cerebral cortices were digested with collagenase Type IA (180 units collagenase/ml) and homogenized, and the released membranes were separated into five fractions at the interfaces of a discontinuous Ficoll gradient (0, 2, 5, 10, and 20%) (22Sánchez del Pino M.M.

These membrane fractions are referred to as F1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, with the remaining pellet as F5. The amount of abluminal and luminal membrane in each fraction was determined by the activities of two markers: system A transport of N-(methylamino)isobutyric acid for abluminal membrane and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase for luminal membrane. The percentage of luminal membrane in each fraction was: F1, 80%; F2, 57%; F3, 31%; F4, 26%; F5, 29%. Brain microvessels were isolated (22Sánchez del Pino M.M. Hawkins R.A. Peterson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25951-25957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), digested with collagenase, suspended in freezing buffer (280 mm sucrose, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and stored at −80 °C. A single-step method of RNA isolation was used on the microvessels (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar). The RT-PCR reactions were conducted in one step with TitanTM One Tube RT-PCR, following the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). EAAT1 expression levels were determined using the following primers (5′ to 3′), CCTGCCATGTATACAGTGAC and ATTGTGGTGAATGAGCCACT; primers for EAAT2, GAAAAAACCCATTCTCCTTTTT and CCGACTGGGAGGACGAATC; primers for EAAT3, GGGACAGATTCTGGTGGATT and GTGATCCTCTTGTCCAC; primers to MAP-2a, CTAGATCCACTAATGCCAGT and TTAGCACACCAGTCTTGAAG; and for glutamine synthetase, CAGCTGTAAGCGTATAATGG and TGGTACTGGTGCCTCTTGCT. To amplify the S26 ribosomal protein RNA, the following primers were used: CAGCAGGTCTGAATCGTGGT and AATTCGCTGCACGAACTGCG. Reverse transcription and amplification conditions were 50 °C for 30 min and 94 °C for 2 min. For EAAT2, EAAT3, MAP-2a, glutamine synthetase, and S26 ribosomal protein RNA, the procedure was 10 cycles of denaturation (94 °C for 30 s), annealing (51 °C for 30 s), and extension (68 °C for 1 min) and 15 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 51 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min plus 1 s per cycle with a final extension of 68 °C for 7 min. For EAAT1 mRNA, the procedure was 10 cycles of denaturation (94 °C for 30 s), annealing (54 °C for 30 s), and extension (68 °C for 1 min) and 20 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min plus 1 s per cycle with a final extension of 68 °C for 7 min. The resulting PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through a 1.2% agarose gel in TBE (0.45 mTris, 0.45 m boric acid, 0.01 m EDTA) and stained with ethidium bromide. The expected sizes for the PCR products were 26S RNA (253 bp), EAAT1 (242 bp), EAAT2 (150 bp), EAAT3 (370 bp), MAP-2a (640 bp), and glutamine synthetase (500 bp). The identity of the PCR products was determined by sequencing of the cDNAs in an ABI 373 automatic sequencer using the Taq Dye DeoxyTM terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer). Membrane proteins were separated on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell). For detection of EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3 proteins, blots were incubated in blocking solution (5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature with shaking. After three washes with a Tris buffer (TTBS: 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% ((v/v) Tween 20), blots were incubated with primary antibodies in TTBS for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. Blots were washed again with TTBS and incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase for 1 h. After 1 h, blots were washed and developed. Polyclonal (rabbit) anti-EAAT2 was purchased from Affinity BioReagents, Inc. (Golden, CO). Anti-EAAT1 antibody was generously supplied by Dr. Wilhelm Stoffel, Laboratory of Molecular Neuroscience, University of Cologne, Germany; the antigen used to generate this antibody (AS12) was a peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 24–40 of rat EAAT1. Polyclonal (rabbit) anti-EAAT3 was generously supplied by Dr. Donald Novak, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainsville, FL. Experiments to determine kinetics and activity of glutamate transport were performed with a rapid filtration method (25Sánchez del Pino M.M. Peterson D.R. Hawkins R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14913-14918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles were centrifuged at 37,500 ×g for 25 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in 1 of 4 solutions, pH 7.4: 1) 100 mm KCl, 90 mm mannitol, 10 mm HEPES, and 12.5 μg of valinomycin/mg of protein; 2) same as solution 1 with no valinomycin; 3) 25 mm KCl, 240 mm mannitol, 10 mm HEPES, and 12.5 μg of valinomycin/mg of protein; 4) 290 mm mannitol, 10 mm HEPES. Vesicles were allowed to equilibrate overnight at 4 °C. The final concentration of protein was between 2.5 and 5 mg of protein/ml. The membrane vesicle suspension was divided into 5-μl aliquots; one was reserved to determine the protein concentration. Aliquots were preincubated at 37 °C for 1 min before initiation of the experiment. Reaction media containing radiolabeled glutamate with or without inhibitors was added at an amount necessary for the desired dilution. The concentration of NaCl at the start of the experiments was always 100 mm, with the amount of mannitol varying to keep osmolarity constant and HEPES as a buffer. Reaction times were 10 s except for time course studies. Reactions were stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold stopping solution (190 mm NaCl and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and rapidly filtering on a 0.45-μm Gelman Metricel filter (Ann Arbor, MI) under vacuum. The filtered membranes were immediately washed 4 times by 1-ml aliquots of stopping solution, after which the filters were counted by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. To control for binding or trapping of the radiolabeled substrate, uptake of radiolabeled glutamate was measured in the presence of a saturating dose of unlabeled glutamate in the reaction mix. Experiments were performed at −61 mV with membranes from fraction 3 unless otherwise stated. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein microassay, with bovine serum albumin as the standard, based on the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar). Curves were fit by Sigma Plot (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and data were analyzed with StatView (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) using Fisher's least significant difference. Values were considered significant at p < 0.05. cDNA (from RT-PCR) was separated by electrophoresis. Specific probes identified the Na+-dependent glutamate transporters EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3 (Fig. 1). The results indicated the three transporters were expressed by brain microvessels. DNA sequencing of the bands demonstrated greater than 95% homology in each compared with other species (EAAT1 (17Storck T. Schulte S. Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10955-10959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar), EAAT2 (18Pines G. Danbolt N.C. Bjoras M. Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Eide L. Koepsell H. Storm-Mathisen J. Seeberg E. Kanner B.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar), EAAT3 (6Velaz-Faircloth M. McGraw T.S. Alandro M.S. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Kilberg M.S. Anderson K.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C67-C75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,7Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar)). To determine the location of EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3, membrane proteins (25 μg/lane) from the five fractions were electrophoresed and immunoblotted with specific antibodies (Fig.2). Fractions 1 and 2 were enriched in luminal membrane (80% and 57%, respectively), whereas fractions 3, 4, and 5 were enriched in abluminal membrane (69, 74, and 71%, respectively). Protein for the three transporters was found only in fractions 3, 4, and 5, indicating an abluminal location. The presence of astrocytes or neurons could contaminate the microvessel preparation, thereby skewing the results. To test this, markers were used to assess the purity of the preparation (glutamine synthetase for astrocytes (27Martinez-Hernandez A. Bell K.P. Norenberg M.D. Science. 1977; 195: 1356-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar) and microtubule-associated protein (MAP-2a) for neurons (28Kandel E.R. Schwartz J.H. Jessell T.M. Principles of Neural Science. 3rd Ed. Appleton & Lange, East Norwalk, CT1991: 49-65Google Scholar)). mRNA for glutamine synthetase and MAP-2a was manifest in whole brain extract (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and3) but not in cerebral microvessels (lanes 2 and4). Thus, there was no detectable contamination by astrocytes or neurons in the microvessel preparation. Preliminary experiments measured glutamate uptake in the presence and absence of Na+ (choline was used as an inert ion). Glutamate transport in the absence of Na+ was 50–70% less than in the presence of Na+ (data not included). Once Na+dependence was established, all further experiments were done in the presence of Na+ using a saturating concentration of glutamate to determine the base line. Glutamate transport has been shown to be voltage-dependent (29Brew H. Attwell D. Nature. 1987; 327: 707-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Therefore, to assess the voltage sensitivity of blood-brain barrier glutamate transport, uptake over time at different transmembrane potentials was measured. The initial rate was measured as the change in glutamate uptake between 0 and 15 s. Valinomycin, a potassium-specific ionophore, was used to make the vesicles permeable to K+, and different concentration gradients of KCl created the desired potentials (18.4, 0, −18.4, −42.6, −80.7, −100.3 mV), according to the Nernst equation (30Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 11-15Google Scholar), as follows.EK=61log[Kout][Kin](at37°C)(Eq. 1) The initial rate increased as transmembrane potential became more negative (Fig. 4). The following equation was used to fit the curve.y=a1+exp−x−xok(Eq. 2) where a is the maximal initial rate (1.6 ± 0.3), xo is the midpoint (−10.8 ± 15), andk is the steepness of the curve (−33.3 ± 16). Oncek was determined, the net charge (z) associated with glutamate transport was calculated (30Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 11-15Google Scholar) as follows. k=RTzF(Eq. 3) At 37 °C, RT/F (R is the gas constant, 8.315 J·K−1·mol−1, Tis the temperature in Kelvin, and F is Faraday's constant, 9.648 × 104 C·mol−1) is 26.73 mV. Solving for z, a net charge of 0.8 is obtained, indicating a net movement of one positive charge. Barbour et al. (31Barbour B. Brew H. Attwell D. Nature. 1988; 335: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) showed a dependence of glutamate transport on intracellular potassium. To determine if the blood-brain barrier glutamate transporter was dependent on K+, Na+-dependent glutamate uptake was measured with and without intravesicular K+. Vesicles with K+ showed a 56.5% greater uptake than vesicles without K+. This increased transport was compared with uptake with a −61-mV transmembrane potential (obtained by valinomycin and intravesicular KCl). Glutamate uptake with a −61-mV transmembrane potential was 20% greater than intravesicular K+ alone (data not shown). A range of glutamate concentrations (0.2 μm to 1 mm) was used to determine the kinetics of glutamate uptake. The results, plotted in Eadie-Hofstee fashion (Fig. 5), showed aKm of 14 ± 4 μm (asymptotic standard error) and a Vmax of 151 ± 20 pmol·mg−1·min−1. To determine the activity of the three Na+-dependent glutamate transporters, inhibitors (1 mm) for EAAT2 (kainic acid and dihydrokainic acid (19Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and EAAT3 (cysteine (32Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 493: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar)) were used (Fig.6). Arriza et al. (19Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported Ki values for kainic acid (17 μm) and dihydrokainic acid (9 μm) (19Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Zerangue and Kavanaugh (32Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 493: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) reported that 1 mm cysteine “completely” inhibited glutamate transport by EAAT3. Using 1 mm each of inhibitors and assuming the concentration of substrate was negligible, near complete (>98%) inhibition of glutamate transport was expected according to the following formula%Inhibition=[I]Ki·1+[S]Km+[I](Eq. 4) where S is substrate and I is inhibitor. Cysteine inhibited 58 ± 5% (S.E.), kainic acid inhibited 24 ± 6%, dihydrokainic acid inhibited 37 ± 8% of glutamate uptake. Assuming complete and specific inhibition by each blocking agent, the ratio of activities of EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3 was approximately 1:3:6. The purpose of these experiments was to determine whether Na+-dependent glutamate carriers exist on the blood-brain barrier. Our results established that mRNA for three glutamate transporters, EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3, was present in brain endothelial cells and that each transporter protein existed on the abluminal membrane of the blood-brain barrier. Examination of transporter characteristics revealed voltage dependence and K+ sensitivity of glutamate transport in abluminal vesicles, a high affinity for glutamate transport (combined activity), and an approximate ratio of activity of 1:3:6 for EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3, respectively. Previously, we had identified low affinity glutamate transport across the abluminal membrane of the blood-brain barrier (Km 6.8 mm (16Lee W.J. Hawkins R.A. Viña J.R. Peterson D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1101-C1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Other laboratories had reported high affinity glutamate transport with an apparentKm in the μm range (14Hutchison H.T. Eisenberg H.M. Haber B. Exp. Neurol. 1985; 87: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, voltage dependence of glutamate uptake had been shown by Brew and Attwell (29Brew H. Attwell D. Nature. 1987; 327: 707-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reexamined glutamate transport and affinity in the presence of varying transmembrane potentials and observed an increase in initial rate as the transmembrane potential was made more negative, as well as an apparent Km in the μm range. Reports of K+ dependence of glutamate transport (31Barbour B. Brew H. Attwell D. Nature. 1988; 335: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) prompted us to question whether our observations were of voltage dependence or of K+sensitivity. Our results corroborated a voltage dependence as well as a K+ sensitivity of blood-brain barrier glutamate transport. The number of Na+ ions transported with glutamate is still the source of controversy. Some suggest at least two Na+molecules translocated with a glutamate molecule (29Brew H. Attwell D. Nature. 1987; 327: 707-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 33Stallcup W.B. Bulloch K. Baetge E.E. J. Neurochem. 1979; 32: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 34Bouvier M. Szatkowski M. Amato A. Attwell D. Nature. 1992; 360: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), whereas others report three Na+ molecules/glutamate (35Wadiche J.I. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 36Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 37Levy L.M. Warr O. Attwell D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9620-9628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our calculations of a net charge of 0.8 support at least two Na+ ions per glutamate. Once high affinity glutamate transport was observed, the next question was which of the three transporters was active. ReportedKm values for EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3 are very similar (19Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it would be difficult to determine the activity of the transporters on the basis of kinetics alone. Because of this, we relied on the known pharmacology of the transporters by using inhibitors for EAAT2 (dihydrokainic acid and kainic acid) and EAAT3 (cysteine). Relative activity obtained was approximately 1:3:6 for EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3. A possible explanation for the different percent inhibition of dihydrokainic acid versus kainic acid is the finding of partial inhibition of glutamate transport through a cortical neuronal transporter by dihydrokainic acid (38Wang G.J. Chung H.J. Schnuer J. Pratt K. Zable A.C. Kavanaugh M.P. Rosenberg P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). With the current observations of three active transporters for glutamate on the abluminal membrane combined with work previously published (16Lee W.J. Hawkins R.A. Viña J.R. Peterson D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1101-C1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a general scheme of glutamate-glutamine interactions including the roles of astrocytes and neurons can be deduced (Fig.7). Extracellular glutamate is transported into astrocytes, neurons, and endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier by at least three Na+-dependent transporters. Once in astrocytes, glutamate is converted to glutamine and released into the extracellular space. Glutamate transported into neurons can be stored for future release during synaptic transmission. Glutamate transported into endothelial cells combined with catabolism of glutamine to glutamate by glutaminase (16Lee W.J. Hawkins R.A. Viña J.R. Peterson D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1101-C1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 7) transiently increases intracellular glutamate concentration. When the concentration of glutamate in endothelial cells becomes greater than the concentration in plasma (0.1 mm (39Bradbury M. The Concept of a Blood-Brain Barrier. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1979Google Scholar)), glutamate is facilitatively transported across the luminal membrane into blood (15Benrabh H. Lefauconnier J.M. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 210: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,16Lee W.J. Hawkins R.A. Viña J.R. Peterson D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1101-C1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the flux of glutamate from blood into endothelial cells is possible via facilitative carriers (Fig. 7), but movement of glutamate from the cells to brain would be difficult due to the steep Na+ gradient that exists between extracellular fluid and endothelial cells (39Bradbury M. The Concept of a Blood-Brain Barrier. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1979Google Scholar). The absence of facilitative carriers on the abluminal membrane (16Lee W.J. Hawkins R.A. Viña J.R. Peterson D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1101-C1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) further prevents movement of glutamate into the brain from the cells. Therefore, the blood-brain barrier not only restricts net glutamate entry into the central nervous system but also expels it, providing a possible explanation for why glutamate is not observed entering the brain in vivo (40Hawkins R.A. DeJoseph M.R. Hawkins P.A. Cell Tissue Res. 1995; 281: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Astrocytes, containing two Na+-dependent glutamate transporters, are in close apposition with neurons (shown diagrammatically in Fig. 7), providing a milieu for termination of glutamate transmission (8Rothstein J. Dykes-Hoberg M. Pardo C. Bristol L. Jin L. Kuncl R. Kanai Y. Hediger M. Wang Y. Schielke J. Welty D. Neuron. 1996; 16: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2116) Google Scholar). The role of the blood-brain barrier is not as obvious unless certain pathological states are considered, such as transient ischemia or hypoxia. In these conditions, nerve cells and astrocytes depolarize, causing glutamate transporters to run “backward” (41Nicholls D. Attwell D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 462-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 42Szatkowski M. Barbour B. Attwell D. Nature. 1990; 348: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), increasing the glutamate concentration in extracellular fluid. In addition, as cellular metabolism slows, intracellular acidosis occurs. This acidosis exacerbates the reversal of the astrocyte transporters (43Gemba T. Oshima T. Ninomiya M. Neuroscience. 1994; 63: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), further increasing the glutamate concentration in extracellular fluid to near toxic levels. The transporters present on the blood-brain barrier would then be in a position to remove glutamate from the extracellular fluid (Fig. 7), maintaining nontoxic levels. Other members of the glutamate transporter family may also exist. Recently, homologues of EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT5 have been cloned (sEAAT1, sEAAT2A, sEAAT2B, sEAAT5A, and sEAAT5B (44Eliasof S. Arriza J. Leighton B. Amara S. Kavanaugh M. Vision Res. 1998; 38: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). In the case of the blood-brain barrier, we only examined EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3, and whether other transporters are present has to be determined. However, the three transporters accounted for the glutamate transport activity detected by our technique. In conclusion, at least three Na+-dependent glutamate transporters exist on the abluminal membrane of the blood-brain barrier with two possible functions: to restrict glutamate entry to the brain and to remove glutamate from the extracellular fluid in conjunction with facilitative transporters on the luminal membrane. This net transport out of brain provides a possible protective mechanism against glutamate neurotoxicity. We thank Drs. Simpson, Vannucci, and Sukowski for perusal of the manuscript and many helpful comments."

The −1602 to −1534 distal region (bcl-2j) of the promoter was E2-responsive; however, in gel mobility shift assays, the estrogen receptor α (ERα) did not bind [32P]bcl-2j, whereas Sp1 protein formed a retarded band complex. Further analysis demonstrated that the upstream region (−1603 to −1579) of the bcl-2 gene promoter contained two GC/GA-rich sites at −1601 (5′-GGGCTGG-3′) and −1588 (3′-GGAGGG-5′) that bound Sp1 protein. Subsequent studies confirmed that transactivation by E2 was dependent on ERα/Sp1 interactions with both GC-rich sites, and this was confirmed byin vitro footprinting. In contrast, a 21-base pair E2-responsive downstream region (−1578 to −1534) did not bind Sp1 or ERα protein; however, analysis of a complex binding pattern with nuclear extracts showed that ATF-1 and CREB-1 bound to this motif. These data coupled with results of transient transfection studies demonstrated that transcriptional activation by E2 of the −1578 to −1534 region of the bcl-2 gene promoter was dependent on induction of cAMP and subsequent activation through a cAMP response element. Thus, hormone regulation of bcl-2 gene expression in breast cancer cells involves multiple enhancer elements and E2-mediated transactivation does not require direct binding of the estrogen receptor with promoter DNA. bcl-2 gene expression is induced by 17β-estradiol (E2) in T47D and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, and the mechanism of E2 responsiveness was further investigated by analysis of the bcl-2 gene promoter.

Human breast cancer cell lines have been extensively used as models for understanding the role of bcl-2 in development and growth of breast tumors and their response to chemotherapeutic drugs. Several lines of evidence suggest that resistance of breast cancer cells to treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs is linked to bcl-2 expression in these cells (23Teixeira C. Reed J.C. Pratt M.A.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3902-3907PubMed Google Scholar, 24Piche A. Grim J. Rancourt C. Gomez-Navarro J. Reed J.C. Curiel D.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2134-2140PubMed Google Scholar, 25Adam L. Crepin M.

For example, intracellular expression of single chain antibodies to bcl-2 in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells decreased bcl-2 levels and increased the sensitivity of these cells to drug-induced cytotoxicity (24Piche A. Grim J. Rancourt C. Gomez-Navarro J. Reed J.C. Curiel D.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2134-2140PubMed Google Scholar). It was also shown that stable overexpression of bcl-xs, a dominant negative inhibitor of bcl-2, also increased the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to growth inhibitory effects of the chemotherapeutic agents VP-16 and taxol (7Cleary M.L. Sklar J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7439-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Expression of bcl-2 and drug resistance of breast cancer cells is also hormone-dependent (23Teixeira C. Reed J.C. Pratt M.A.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3902-3907PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wang T.T.Y.

A 70-bp distal promoter fragment (−1603 to −1534) was identified as estrogen-responsive, and this region of the promoter did not contain perfect or imperfect estrogen-responsive elements (EREs). Further analysis identified fragments of 25 (−1603 to −1579) and 21 (−1554 to −1534) bp that were estrogen-responsive. The more distal G-rich sequence bound Sp1 protein at two sites, and transcriptional activation by E2 was associated with ERα/Sp1 interactions withcis-genomic Sp1 binding sites. In contrast, the E2-responsive 21-bp sequence contained a cAMP response element (CRE) that bound ATF-1 and CREB-1, and transactivation was associated with induction of cAMP by E2. Thus, transcriptional activation of bcl-2 by E2 in MCF-7 and T47D cells involves at least three different distalcis-genomic elements and does not require direct binding of ERα to the bcl-2 gene promoter. 17β-estradiol base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase minimal essential medium polymerase chain reaction estrogen receptor cAMP-responsive element estrogen-responsive element MCF-7 and T47D cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). Cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM) with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 g of glucose, and 6 μg of insulin per liter (for MCF-7 cells) or α-MEM for T47D cells. Media for these cells were supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum plus 10 ml/liter antibiotic-antimycotic solution. Cells were grown in 150-cm2 culture flasks in an air:carbon dioxide (95:5) atmosphere at 37 °C. After reaching confluence, cultures were trypsinized and washed once with culture medium. Cells were passed into fresh culture flasks at the ratio of 1:2. Sp1, Sp3, ATF-1, CREB-1, CREB-2, CREM-1, and ERα antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Open table in a new tab The mutant CREB inhibitory expression plasmid (KCREB) and protein kinase A expression plasmid (pPKA) were kindly provided by Drs. Elaine Lewis and Richard Maurer, Oregon Health Science Center (Portland, OR). The plasmid bcl-2 promoter-CAT constructs pbcl-2a, pbcl2b, and pbcl-2c have been described previously (32Miyashita T. Harigai M. Hanada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3131-3135PubMed Google Scholar). pbcl-2d was constructed in this laboratory by deletion of 1.2 kb (XhoI/SstI) (see Fig. 2) from pbcl-2b. Plasmids pbcl-2e, pbcl-2f, pbcl-2g, pbcl-2h, and pbcl-2i were created by PCR extension technique. All the forward primers contained aHindIII site and the reverse primers contained aKpnI site. R120 and F120 primers were used to obtain the pbcl-2h insert; R and F1, R and F2, and R and F3 primers were used to obtain inserts for pbcl-2g, pbcl-2f, and pbcl-2e, respectively. The insert sequences are given below.R120:5′­GCG AAG CTT GAG CTC CCG CCG CG­3′F120:5′­GCG GGT ACC CTC TCC GTG GCC CCG­3′R:5′­GCG AAG CTT GAG CCC CGG CAC CTT C­3′F1:5′­GCG GGT ACC GAC AGC CCC GAC TCC C­3′F2:5′­GCG GGT ACC AAA CCG GTC GGC TGT G­3′F3:5′­GCG GGT ACC TCG GGC TGG CTC AGA G­3′SEQUENCES 1–6 Fragments were amplified with Vent DNA polymerase and the plasmid p18–21 as a template. After gel purification, the PCR products were digested with HindIII and KphI and then subcloned into pucSV9CAT. The oligonucleotides from the human bcl-2 promoter listed above were cloned into the pBLCAT2 at the HindIII andBamHI sites to give pbcl-2j, bcl-2k, bcl-2km1, bcl-2km2, bcl-2km3, bcl-2l, pbcl-2m, mt1-pbcl-2m, mt2-pbcl-2m, mt3-pbcl-2m, and mt4-pbcl-2m plasmids, respectively. pPac/Sp1 (provided by Dr. R. Tjian, University of California, Berkeley) was digested with XhoI, and the phosphate group was removed by treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. After being treated with 10 nm EDTA and heated at 80 °C for 15 min, the reaction was extracted with phenol/chloroform (two times) and the vector was separated from the Sp1 insert by electrophoresis and gel extraction. hER was released from the hER expression plasmid by digestion with EcoRI. The hER fragment was filled by dATP and dTTP, and an XhoI linker was ligated to the blunted hER fragment. After digestion withXhoI, the hER fragment was ligated to the pPac vector, which was treated with XhoI and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase as described above. All ligation products were transformed into DH5α-competent Escherichia coli cells, plasmids were isolated, and correct clonings and orientation were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing using Sequitherm cycle sequencing kit from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI). Plasmid preparations for transfections were carried out using a Qiagen Plasmid Mega Kit. Cells were plated in 100-mm culture dishes, grown to 60% confluence, and transfected by the calcium phosphate method (33Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar) with various amounts of the appropriate plasmids. For each 100-mm dish, 5–10 μg of plasmid was mixed with 500 μl of 2× HBC (NaCl 1.636%, Hepes 1.188%, Na2HPO4 0.02%, pH 7.05–7.12) and 62 μl of CaCl2 (2 m) to give a final volume of 1 ml with distilled water. The mixture of DNA and CaCl2 was added into 2× HBS dropwise with gentle vortexing and allowed to settle at 20 °C for 30 min. DNA was added to the medium dropwise, and formation of fine particles was determined microscopically. After adding DNA, cells were grown for 6 h and then shocked with 20% glycerol for 90 s. Medium was then changed, and cells were treated with appropriate chemicals for 24–48 h. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped from the plates. Cell lysates were prepared in 0.3 ml of 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) by three freeze-thaw-sonication cycles (3 min/each). After centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min, the supernatant was incubated at 56 °C for 7 min to remove endogenous deacetylase activity and protein (100–150 μg) was incubated in a reaction mixture containing 0.25 mTris, pH 7.5, 1 mm acetyl-CoA, 0.2 mCi of [14C]chloramphenicol at 37 °C for various times. After incubation, acetylated metabolites were isolated by extraction with ethyl acetate and separated by thin layer chromatography in chloroform:methanol (95:5). The plate was air-dried, and radioactive metabolites were quantified using a Betascope 603 Blot analyzer (IntelliGenetics, Mountain View, CA). Cells were cotransfected with 2.0 μg of a β-galactosidase-LacZ plasmid (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the results were used to normalize CAT activities in various treatment groups. Cells were grown at room temperature in T-150 flasks in Schneider's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min) and 0.5× antibiotic/antimycotic solution. Two ml of cells/well were pipetted to six-well plates, and after incubation for 24 h at room temperature, cells were transfected with 0.5 ml of transfection mixture containing 1 μg of pbcl-2k reporter plasmid, 1 μg of β-galactosidase, 250 μl of 2× HBS, 25 μl of 2.5 mCaCl2, with different amounts of pPac/Sp1 or pPac/hER plasmids. The empty vector, pPac, was used to make the total amount of plasmid 4.1 μg/incubation. After incubation for 20 h at room temperature, cells were treated with 10−8m E2 or solvent carrier (ethanol) for about 48 h and harvested by scraping. Data are combined from two separate experiments using the same experimental protocols, and transfection efficiency was normalized with β-galactosidase activity as described above. Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate/acid phenol extraction method (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar); 200 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed using murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase obtained from Perkin Elmer. The first strand cDNA was directly amplified by 28 PCR cycles using a Taq polymerase; 10 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP was used to label the primer (forward) for each quantitation. The PCR cycle procedure was 95 °C for 45 s, 68 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s for 28 cycles, followed by 72 °C for 10 min. After PCR, products were separated by 6% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. β-Actin mRNA also was amplified to normalize bcl-2 mRNA levels. Primer size of bcl-2 mRNA was 385 bp; sequence was as follows.Forward:5′­ACT TGT GGC CCA GAT AGG CAC CCA G­3′Reverse:5′­CGA CTT CGC CGA GAT GTC CAG CCA G­3′SEQUENCE 7 Nuclear extracts were prepared from MCF-7 cells treated with Me2SO (0.1% v/v) or 10 nm E2 for 4 h utilizing cells maintained in serum-free medium for 3 days. Oligonucleotides were annealed and labeled at the 5′ end using T4-polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed by incubating 5–40 ng of pure Sp1 protein in 25 μl of 1× binding buffer (6% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmEDTA,0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), 0.1 mg/ml BSA. After incubation for 10 min at 4 °C, 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (50,000 cpm) was added to the reaction mixture in the presence of 1 μg of poly[d(I-C)] and incubated for an additional 15 min at 25 °C. Excess unlabeled DNA was added 5 min before adding32P-labeled oligonucleotides. The following procedure was used for ERα enhanced Sp1 binding studies. (a) 200–800 fmol of pure hER protein in 1× binding buffer containing 40 mm E2 and BSA were added and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C; (b) 5–20 ng of Sp1 protein was added to the mixture and incubated on ice for 5 min; (c)32P-labeled oligonucleotides (50,000 cpm) were added to the reaction mixture in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI)-(dC), and the mixture was incubated for an additional 15 min at 20 °C. Nuclear extracts from control (Me2SO) or E2-treated cells were incubated for 15 min at 0 °C in HEGD (2 mm Hepes, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol (v/v), pH 7.6) buffer with 1 mg of poly(dI)-(dC) to bind nonspecific DNA-binding proteins, and 200–500-fold excess of unlabeled wild-type or mutant oligonucleotide competitors for the competition experiments. Following addition of 32P-labeled DNA, the mixture (final volume: 20 ml) was incubated for an additional 20 min at 20 °C. For experiments using saturation concentrations of Sp1 protein (10–30 ng) alone or in combination with 200 fmol of ERα protein, the ERα and Sp1 proteins were added simultaneously (early addition) or ERα was added 5 min after the radiolabeled probe (late addition). For gel supershift experiments, antibodies were added after standard gel mobility shift assay procedure and reactions were further incubated for 20–30 min at 20 °C. Samples were loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide-bisacrylamide ratio, 30:0.8) and run in 1× TBE buffer (0.09 m Tris, 0.09 boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at 200 V at 4 °C. Protein-DNA binding was visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by densitometry using the Molecular Dynamics Zero-D software package (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and a Sharp JX-330 scanner (Mahwah, NJ) and subjected to autoradiography using Kodak X-Omat film for appropriate time at −80 °C. SssI is a CpG methylase that converts the 5′ cytosine to a 5-methylcytosine. Because the DNA is not sheared or digested, this method is highly sensitive for footprinting weak interactions that require a longer or more complex binding sequence (35Kladde M.P. Simpson R.T. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 214-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 36Kladde M.P. Xu M. Simpson R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6290-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Since 5-methylcytosines are resistant to deamination, they are readily detected after PCR amplification with deamination specific primers. Higher resolution is attained by sequencing with the deamination primer that contains the G to A transition and using ddGTP to detect residual guanine residues paired to the 5-methylcytosines. Fifty μg of pbcl-2b containing a 1.6-kb promoter fragment from the human bcl-2 gene was restricted with XhoI and diluted to a concentration of 10 ng/μl. One μl of diluted plasmid was then incubated with increasing concentrations of recombinant human Sp1 protein alone, human ER protein alone, or Sp1 protein plus increasing concentrations of ERα protein. Reactions were carried out in 1× NS binding buffer (0.02 m HEPES, 0.1 m KCl, 0.005m MgCl2, 0.004 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 50 mm S-adenosylmethionine) in a volume of 25 μl. The protein-DNA binding reactions were incubated on ice for 5 min, and then equilibrated to room temperature for 10 min; 2 μl of 1:2 dilution of purified SssI (New England Biolabs) was then added to the equilibrated reactions, which were then incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. After 15 min at 75 °C, 10 μl of freshly made deamination denaturation buffer (0.9 n NaOH, 25 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA) was added. Following 5 min at 98 °C, 200 μl of a saturated solution of sodium metabisulfite was added and the samples were processed as described (35Kladde M.P. Simpson R.T. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 214-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 36Kladde M.P. Xu M. Simpson R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6290-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The primers used to amplify from the purified deaminated plasmid DNA were bcl-2 B1 (5′-TCCACAAACCTAAACAAAAAACC-3′) and bcl-2 B2 (5′-GGTGTTTGTTTTTTTATTTTATTTTTTG-3′). PCR products were purified and cleaned up using the Wizard PCR prep kit from Promega Corp. Purified PCR products were sequenced with radiolabeled bcl-2B1 primer in the presence of a 5 μm solution of dATP, dCTP, and dTTP using 50 μm ddGTP as the stop nucleotide. Sequitherm 10× buffer and Sequitherm thermostable DNA polymerase (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI) were used for the sequencing reactions. Sequencing reactions were run on 6% polyacrylamide-urea sequencing gels. The dried gels were exposed to a phosphor screen for 12 h and analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics Storm instrument. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. for at least three independent (replicate) experiments for each treatment group. Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance and Student's t test, and the levels of probability are noted for each experiment. Fig. 1 Asummarizes the effects of E2 on bcl-2 mRNA levels in MCF-7 and T47D cells, and these data are comparable to those previously reported (23Teixeira C. Reed J.C. Pratt M.A.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3902-3907PubMed Google Scholar,29Wang T.T.Y. Phang J.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2487-2489PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kandouz M. Siromachkova M. Jacob D. Chretien Marquet B.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis of the 7.0-kb fragment from the bcl-2 gene promoter (Fig. 1B) focused on the −3.0 kb region utilizing transient transfection studies in T47D cells. These plasmids contained bcl-2 gene promoter inserts in pUCSVO-CAT containing an SV40 early-region promoter 5′ of the HindIII site (32Miyashita T. Harigai M. Hanada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3131-3135PubMed Google Scholar), and the construct was readily transfected into T47D but not MCF-7 cells due to poor conversion in these cells. Results obtained for pbcl-2a–pbcl-2d showed that treatment with E2 resulted in a 3.4–6.9-fold increase in CAT activity and E2 responsiveness was retained in a promoter region from −1647 to −1293. Further analysis of a series of constructs containingbcl-2 gene promoter inserts from within the −1647/−1289 region (pbcl-2d–pbcl2i; Fig. 1 C) indicated that hormone responsiveness was localized within a minimal 70-bp sequence from −1603 to −1534. Synthetic oligonucleotides within −1603/−1534 region of thebcl-2 gene promoter were cloned into pBLCAT3, transiently transfected into MCF-7 cells, and treated with 10 nm E2 or Me2SO. The results (Fig.2 A) indicate that E2 responsiveness of the 71-bp construct (pcbl-2j) is associated with a 25-bp upstream (pbcl-2k) and a 21-bp downstream (pbcl-2m) region of the bcl-2 gene promoter. The −1603 to −1579 region of thebcl-2 gene promoter contains two G-rich sequences at −1601 (5′-GGGCTGG-3′) and −1588 (GGAGGG) and the role of these sites in E2 responsiveness was further investigated using pbcl-2k and constructs containing mutations at one or both G-rich sites (pbcl-2km1, pbcl-2km2 and pbcl-2km3). The resulting plasmids were transiently transfected into MCF-7 and T47D cells (Fig. 2, A and B), and the results showed that E2 significantly induced CAT activity with wild-type or single-site mutant constructs (pbcl-2k, pbcl-2km1 and pbcl-2km2), whereas no significant induction was observed with the double mutant (pbcl-2km3). The E2-responsive 70-bp sequence (−1603 to −1534) contains at least two G-rich regions; therefore, binding of Sp1 protein was investigated in gel mobility shift assays. The results illustrated in Fig.3 A show that purified recombinant Sp1 protein binds to a consensus [32P]Sp1 oligonucleotide to form a retarded band (lane 1). Similar results were obtained for the 70-bp bcl-2j (−1603 to −1534) oligonucleotide (lane 3) and G-rich 25-bp bcl-2k (−1603 to −1579) sequence (lane 5) but not for the downstream"
https://openalex.org/W2093558312,"We have isolated a cDNA from human placenta, which, when expressed heterologously in mammalian cells, mediates the transport of the water-soluble vitamin thiamine. The cDNA codes for a protein of 497 amino acids containing 12 putative transmembrane domains. Northern blot analysis indicates that this transporter is widely expressed in human tissues. When expressed in HeLa cells, the cDNA induces the transport of thiamine (Kt= 2.5 ± 0.6 μm) in a Na+-independent manner. The cDNA-mediated transport of thiamine is stimulated by an outwardly directed H+ gradient. Substrate specificity assays indicate that the transporter is specific to thiamine. Even though thiamine is an organic cation, the cDNA-induced thiamine transport is not inhibited by other organic cations. Similarly, thiamine is not a substrate for the known members of mammalian organic cation transporter family. The thiamine transporter gene, located on human chromosome 1q24, consists of 6 exons and is most likely the gene defective in the metabolic disorder, thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia. At the level of amino acid sequence, the thiamine transporter is most closely related to the reduced-folate transporter and thus represents the second member of the folate transporter family.

It is an essential nutrient, and its requirement in the developing fetus is met by the transplacental transport from maternal circulation to fetal circulation. The concentration of thiamine is more than 10-fold higher in fetal umbilical vein plasma compared with that present in maternal plasma (2Zempleni J. Link G. Kübler W. Int. J. Vitam. Nutr.

The underlying mechanism of transplacental transport of thiamine has been investigated usingin vitro perfusion techniques (3Dancis J. Wilson D. Hoskins I.A. Levitz M. Am. J. Obstet.

Thiamine is an organic cation. Depending on the pH of the solution, thiamine can exist either as a monovalent or bivalent cation (6Komai T. Shindo H. J. Nutr. Sci.

Physiol. 1988; 255: G85-G92PubMed Google Scholar) are known to express specific organic cation/H+ antiport systems that are capable of transporting both endogenous as well as exogenous organic cations. The presence of an outwardly directed proton gradient was shown to induce concentrative thiamine accumulation in brush border membrane vesicles isolated from human term placenta, suggesting a possible role of an organic cation/H+ antiport system in the uptake of thiamine into the placenta (5Grassl S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Consistent with such an uptake mechanism, the thiamine uptake into placental brush border membrane vesicles was abolished in the presence of proton ionophores and unaffected by the presence of an inside-negative membrane potential. Existence of a similar uptake mechanism for thiamine has also been described in intestine (8Loforenza U. Orsenigo M.N. Rindi G. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 161: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and erythrocytes (10Casirola D. Patrini C. Ferrari G. Rindi G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 118: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the molecular cloning of a cDNA from human placenta which, when expressed in mammalian cells, induces the uptake of thiamine. This thiamine transporter (ThT1)1 shares significant homology (40% identity) with the reduced-folate transporter (RFC or FOLT) previously cloned from human placenta (18Prasad P.D. Ramamoorthy S. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Northern analysis indicates that the ThT1-specific transcript (∼3.8 kb in size) is widely expressed in human tissues. The human gene of ThT1 (∼22 kb), which has already been sequenced as a part of the Human Genome Project, maps to chromosome 1q24 and consists of 6 exons and 5 introns as determined by comparison of sequences of tht1 gene and ThT1 cDNA. SuperScript Plasmid System for cDNA cloning, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Lipofectin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.

The original reports on the cloning of rOCT3 (21Kekuda R. Prasad P.D. Wu X. Wang H. Fei Y.J. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15971-15979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and rOCTN2 (22Seth P. Wu X. Huang W. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. FASEB J. 1999; 13 (Abstr.

Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) was obtained by screening a rat liver cDNA library using rOCT3 as the probe. The cDNA for rOCTN1 was obtained by screening a rat placental cDNA library using hOCTN1 as the probe (24Tamai I. Yabuuchi H. Nezu J. Sai Y. Oku A. Shimane M. Tsuji A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Previous studies from our laboratory have led to the cloning of the RFC from human placenta (18Prasad P.D. Ramamoorthy S. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Blast search of the GenBank peptide sequence data base using the amino acid sequence of human RFC showed that a sequence entry of a RFC-like protein has been submitted to the data base (accession CAA15926). This protein, as per the GenBank entry, is 468 amino acids long, truncated at the N terminus lacking the initiator methionine and shared 39% identity and 55% similarity with human RFC. The amino acid sequence of the RFC-like protein was derived by GENSCAN prediction from the nucleotide sequence of a genomic clone isolated from a genomic library of human chromosome 1 (nucleotide sequence data base accession no.AL021068, submitted by C. Bird, Sanger Center Chromosome 1 Mapping Group). Neither the complete amino acid sequence of the protein nor its function was known. In order to get the full-length cDNA of the RFC-like protein, we generated a cDNA probe specific to the protein by RT-PCR and screened a human placental cDNA library. The RT-PCR was done using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from human term placenta and the primers 5′-GCCACCAGAAAGTCACAAGTT-3′ (upstream primer) and 5′-CAGGAGAGAAAAGAGAGATA-3′ (downstream primer). The upper primer had an additional three nucleotides (underlined) added at the 5′ end to ensure primer pair compatibility. The expected size of the RT-PCR product was 656 bp, comprising the region coding for Gln126 to Leu343 of the RFC-like protein. The identity of the product obtained was confirmed by sequencing before using it as the probe in library screening. The screening of the placental cDNA library was done by colony screening of the plasmid cDNA library grown on Nitropure transfer membranes as described previously (25Wang H. Huang W. Fei Y.J. Xia H. Yang-Feng T.L. Leibach F.H. Devoe L.D. Ganapathy V. Prasad P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14875-14883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The cDNA probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming using the Ready-to-Go oligolabeling kit. Positive clones were identified and the colonies purified by secondary screening. The size of the cDNA inserts of the positive clones was determined by restriction digestion using EcoRI/BamHI to release the insert from the vector followed by size fractionation by agarose gel electrophoresis. A single clone with the largest insert size was selected for further characterization. Both sense and antisense strands of the cDNA were sequenced by primer walking. Sequencing by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination chemistry was performed by Taq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing using an automated Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems 377 Prism DNA sequencer. The sequence was analyzed using the BCM Search Launcher server (26Smith R.F. Wiese B.A. Wojzynski M.K. Davison D.B. Worley K.C. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 454-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and NCBI server. Tissue distribution of the ThT1-specific transcript was determined by Northern analysis. A hybridization-ready, commercially available human multiple tissue blot (CLONTECH). The blot was probed sequentially with ThT1 cDNA and then with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA under high stringency conditions. The cloned cDNA was functionally expressed in HeLa cells by vaccinia virus expression system as described previously (25Wang H. Huang W. Fei Y.J. Xia H. Yang-Feng T.L. Leibach F.H. Devoe L.D.

Subconfluent HeLa cells grown on 24-well plates were first infected with the recombinant (VTF7–3) vaccinia virus encoding T7 RNA polymerase and then transfected with 1 μg of the plasmid carrying the full-length cDNA using Lipofectin. In most experiments, transport measurements were made at 37 °C with a 10-min incubation using [3H]thiamine in the absence of Na+ at pH 8.0. The composition of the transport buffer was 25 mmTris/Hepes, pH 8.0, supplemented with 140 mm NMDG chloride, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm glucose. When the influence of Na+ on thiamine uptake was investigated, NMDG chloride in the transport buffer was replaced with NaCl. When the influence of pH on transport was investigated, transport buffers of different pH were prepared by varying the concentration of Tris, Hepes, and Mes. Transport was terminated by aspiration of the uptake buffer followed by two rapid washes with 2 ml of ice-cold transport buffer. The cells were then solubilized with 0.5 ml of 1% SDS in 0.2n NaOH and transferred to vials for quantitation of the radioactivity associated with the cells. Endogenous transport was always measured in parallel in cells transfected with empty vector (pSPORT) and subtracted from the corresponding transport values measured in cells transfected with vector cDNA to obtain the cDNA-specific uptake of the vitamin. Uptake measurements were made either in duplicate or triplicate, and each experiment was repeated two to three times with separate transfections. Results are given as means ± S.E. of these replicate values. Kinetic analyses were carried out by nonlinear as well as linear regression methods using the commercially available computer program SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The cloned cDNA (ThT1, for thiamine transporter; GenBank accession no. AF160812) is 3530 bp long and has an open reading frame of 1494 bp including the termination codon. The open reading frame is flanked by a 96-bp-long 5′-noncoding sequence and a 1941-bp-long 3′-noncoding sequence. The open reading frame encodes a 497-amino acid protein (Fig. 1 A) with a molecular mass of 55.4 kDa and a pI of 6.35. Hydropathy analysis of the primary amino acid sequence using the Kyte-Doolittle method (28Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) with a window size of 17–24 amino acids per transmembrane helix predicts a topographical model with 12 putative transmembrane domains (Fig.1 B). The strongly preferred model for the arrangement of the transmembrane domains across the membrane is the one with both the N terminus and the C terminus toward the inside. There are two potential sites for N-linked glycosylation at positions 63 and 314 in putative extracellular domains. The primary amino acid sequence also displays three sites (Ser8, Thr22, and Ser291) with consensus sequence for protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation in putative intracellular domains. Interestingly, a 17-amino acid residue sequence, which is a signature of G-protein-coupled receptors (29Attwood T.K. Eliopoulos E.E. Findlay J.B. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 98: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), is also present in the amino acid sequence of ThT1 (amino acid residues 407–423). A comparison of the amino acid sequence of human ThT1 with the protein sequences in the SwissProt sequence data base confirmed that ThT1 is identical to RFC-like protein, however, with an additional 29 amino acids at the N terminus. The closest relative of ThT1 is RFC1 (18Prasad P.D. Ramamoorthy S. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the reduced-folate transporter, with a sequence identity of 40% and similarity of 55% at the amino acid level. A comparison of amino acid sequence of ThT1 and RFC1 is presented in Fig. 1 A. Thus, ThT1 is the second member of the folate transporter family to be cloned. The expression of ThT1 in human tissues was investigated by Northern analysis using a commercially available multiple tissue blot containing size-fractionated poly(A+) RNA obtained from several tissues of human origin. The ThT1-specific hybridization signal (3.8 kb in size) was widely distributed in human tissues (Fig.2). The intensity of the hybridization signal obtained was especially high in skeletal muscle, followed by placenta, heart, liver, and kidney. The functional expression of the clone was done in HeLa cells by transient transfection followed by vaccinia virus-induced expression of the cDNA. Since the cloned transporter showed significant homology to RFC1, we first investigated the ability of the cloned transporter to transport folate and its analogs. The uptake of [3H]5-methyltetrahydrofolate, [3H]folic acid, and [3H]methotrexate was studied in cells transfected with either empty vector or ThT1 cDNA in the presence (Fig. 3 A) or absence (Fig.3 B) of Na+. These studies showed that none of these compounds was a transportable substrate for ThT1. We then tested the ability of ThT1 to transport several water-soluble vitamins like riboflavin, ascorbic acid, and thiamine. Of these substrates tested, only the uptake of thiamine was ∼2-fold higher in ThT1 cDNA-transfected cells in comparison to vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3). Removal of Na+ from the transport buffer did not abolish the transport activity, demonstrating that the transport activity mediated by ThT1 is Na+-independent. Subsequent experiments involving the characterization of the transport function of ThT1 were done in the absence of Na+. The transport of thiamine in placental and intestinal brush border membrane vesicles was stimulated by an inside-out proton gradient (5Grassl S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,8Loforenza U. Orsenigo M.N. Rindi G. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 161: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of extracellular pH on thiamine transport in vector- and cDNA-transfected cells (Fig.4 A). The uptake of thiamine at pH 8.0 was almost 3-fold higher than the uptake at pH 6.0. The process of thiamine uptake displayed a distinct pH optimum at about pH 8.0. Increasing the pH from 6.0 to 8.0 stimulated thiamine uptake, but further increase in pH above 8.0 inhibited the uptake. The endogenous thiamine transport measured in empty vector-transfected cells was much less compared with uptake in cells transfected with ThT1, and this endogenous uptake was similarly influenced by pH. The pH optimum of the endogenous transport, however, was not 8.0, and the uptake kept increasing even when the pH was increased to 8.5. Thiamine is an organic cation. Recently, a number of organic cation transporters have been cloned and functionally characterized (30Koepsell H. Gorboulev V. Arndt P. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The members of the organic cation transporter family accept a variety of organic cations as substrates. It was therefore of interest to see if any of these organic cation transporters is capable of transporting thiamine. We expressed all of the known members of the organic cation transporter family (OCT1, OCT2, OCT3, OCTN1, and OCTN2) in HeLa cells and compared the ability of these transporters to mediate the transport of thiamine and TEA, a prototypical organic cation substrate for these transporters. Although all of the organic cation transporters were functionally expressed, as seen by the increased TEA uptake in cDNA-transfected cells compared with vector-transfected cells, none of them, except OCT3, showed significant transport of thiamine (TableI).Table IThiamine and TEA transport in HeLa cells expressing the various members of the organic cation transporter familycDNAThiamine transportTEA transportpmol/106 cells/10 minpSPORT11.2 ± 0.07 (100)14.0 ± 0.17 (100)OCT112.9 ± 0.05 (115)58.7 ± 2.67 (419)OCT211.9 ± 0.59 (106)138.5 ± 9.07 (989)OCT316.9 ± 0.53 (151)173.7 ± 5.58 (1241)OCTN111.3 ± 0.14 (101)27.5 ± 0.58 (196)OCTN212.2 ± 0.18 (109)85.2 ± 1.99 (609)HeLa cells were transfected with either pSPORT or with various organic cation transporter cDNAs. Functional expression was done using the vaccinia virus expression system.

Values in parentheses represent percentage of the corresponding control uptake measured in cells transfected with pSPORT vector alone. The substrate specificity of ThT1 was evaluated by directly measuring the uptake of structurally diverse organic cations as well as by assessing the ability of these organic cations to inhibit the ThT1-mediated [3H]thiamine uptake. First, the uptake of radiolabeled choline, TEA, MPP, cimetidine, and thiamine was compared in cells expressing ThT1 and control cells transfected with empty vector. All these compounds are organic cations and are known to be transported via organic cation/H+ antiport process in several tissues. However, there was no difference in the transport of TEA, choline, MPP, and cimetidine between control cells and ThT1-expressing cells (data not shown). Under identical conditions, the transport of thiamine was higher in ThT1-expressing cells than in control cells as expected. Next, the ability of various organic cations (1 mm) to inhibit the ThT1-mediated thiamine transport was investigated. Only unlabeled thiamine (1 mm) was able to inhibit the transport of [3H]thiamine (TableII). Other organic cations (guanidine, cimetidine, and choline) failed to inhibit thiamine uptake. These results provide confirmatory evidence that, unlike other organic cation transporters, ThT1 is very specific for thiamine. The transport process mediated by ThT1 was saturable with a Kt of 2.5 ± 0.6 μm for thiamine (Fig. 4 B).Table IISubstrate specificity of ThT1InhibitorThiamine transportpSPORTcDNAcDNA specific (% control)pmol/106 cells/10 minControl17.9 ± 1.038.7 ± 2.020.8 (100)Thiamine6.9 ± 0.69.3 ± 0.12.4 (12)Guanidine17.0 ± 1.741.2 ± 1.424.2 (116)Cimetidine15.6 ± 0.635.8 ± 1.420.2 (97)Choline17.2 ± 2.541.4 ± 4.724.2 (116)HeLa cells were transfected with either pSPORT alone or ThT1 cDNA.

Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of ThT1 cDNA with the nucleotide sequence from which the amino acid sequence of RFC-like protein was derived indicated that the human gene coding for ThT1 has been sequenced in its entirety as a part of the Human Genome Project. The gene (∼22 kb) maps to chromosome 1q24. A comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the tht1 gene and ThT1 cDNA has enabled us to deduce the exon-intron organization of the gene (Fig.5). The gene consists of 6 exons and 5 introns. All exon-intron boundaries conform to consensus donor-acceptor sequences (gt/ag) for RNA splicing. An autosomal recessive disorder called thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia has been described (31Rogers L.E. Porter F.S. Sidbury J, B.J. J. Pediatr. 1969; 74: 494-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and the defect in this syndrome has been localized to chromosome 1, band 1q23.3 (32Neufeld E.J. Mandel H. Raz T.

Fibroblasts from these patients lack the high affinity transport system for thiamine. The ability of these cells to transport thiamine can be restored by transfecting the cells with the yeast thiamine transporter gene, THI10 (33Stagg A.R. Fleming J.C. Baker M.A. Sakamoto M. Cohen N. Neufeld E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that, the primary abnormality in thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia is the absence of a functional high affinity thiamine transporter and that the tht1 gene is most likely defective in these patients. Although both ThT1 and THI10 are thiamine transporters and THI10 is able to functionally correct thiamine transport defect, a comparison of the amino acid sequences of the two proteins by Blast search showed no significant homology between the two proteins. In summary, we have cloned a human thiamine transporter from the placenta. Its transport function is Na+-independent. Structurally this transporter is related to the reduced-folate transporter whose transport function is also Na+-independent. Thus, ThT1 represents the second member of the folate transporter gene family. It is to be noted, however, that the substrate for ThT1 is an organic cation whereas the substrate for RFC1 is an organic anion. Even though both transporters are pH-dependent, the function of ThT1 is stimulated by an outward-directed H+ gradient, whereas the function of RFC1is known to be stimulated by an inward-directed H+gradient (34Kumar C.K. Nguyen T.T. Gonzales F.B. Said H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C289-C294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transport mechanism of these two transporters with respect to the involvement of H+ appears to be different. Transporters for other water-soluble vitamins have been previously identified and functionally characterized. The multivitamin transporter SMVT is specific for biotin and pantothenate and its transport function is obligatorily dependent on Na+ (25Wang H. Huang W. Fei Y.J. Xia H. Yang-Feng T.L. Leibach F.H.

Devoe L.D. Ganapathy V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 366: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Two different transporters (SVCT1 and SVCT2) have been identified for the transport of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in mammalian cells, and both of them are obligatorily dependent on Na+ for their function (37Tsukaguchi H. Tokui T. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Chen X.Z. Wang Y. Brubaker R.F. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to the differences in substrate selectivity, the vitamin transporters also appear to differ in Na+dependence."

H., Bassuk, J. A., Hugo, C., Reed, M. J., Eng, E., Gordon, K. L., Pippin, J., Alpers, C. E., Couser, W. G., Sage, E. H., and Johnson, R. J. (1997) Am. J. Pathol. 148, 1153–1167). A potential mechanism by which SPARC controls both cell cycle and matrix production has been attributed to its regulation of a pleiotropic growth factor. In this study we used primary mesangial cell cultures from wild-type mice and from mice with a targeted disruption of the SPARCgene. SPARC-null cells displayed diminished expression of collagen type I mRNA and protein, relative to wild-type cells, by the criteria of immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, and the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The SPARC-null cells also showed significantly decreased steady-state levels of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) mRNA and secreted TGF-β1 protein. Addition of recombinant SPARC to SPARC-null cells restored the expression of collagen type I mRNA to 70% and TGF-β1 mRNA to 100% of wild-type levels. We conclude that SPARC regulates the expression of collagen type I and TGF-β1 in kidney mesangial cells. Since increased mitosis and matrix deposition by mesangial cells are characteristics of glomerulopathies, we propose that SPARC is one of the factors that maintains the balance between cell proliferation and matrix production in the glomerulus.

SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), a matricellular glycoprotein also known as BM-40, osteonectin, or 43-kDa protein, modulates the interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix through its regulation of cell adhesion and binding of growth factors (1Lane T.F.

Akai Y. Fujii Y. Dohi Y. Matsumura N. Dohi K. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1994; 97: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A multifunctional growth factor that belongs to a family of proteins, TGF-β1 functions in various physiological processes such as growth, differentiation, proliferation, tissue remodeling, and wound healing (16Pepper M.S. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Although specific receptors have been found on nearly all mammalian cells, the effects of TGF-β1 differ according to cell type, growth conditions, and concentration of growth factor (17Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3998) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 has been implicated in development and in the remodeling of tissues that takes place during adult life (18Frank R. Adelmann-Grill B.C. Herrmann K. Haustein U.F. Petri J.B. Heckmann M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 36-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), although its effects on proliferation and differentiation can be stimulatory or inhibitory (19Floege J. Topley N. Resch K. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1991; 17: 673-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 mediates the formation of extracellular matrix via its stimulation of the synthesis of components such as collagen type I. Moreover, it inhibits the degradation of extracellular matrix by suppression of matrix metalloproteinases and induction of tissue inhibitors of these enzymes (20Poncelet A.C. Schnaper H.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F458-F466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of publications have identified TGF-β1 as a critical factor in kidney diseases such as glomerulosclerosis (21Gilbert R.E. Wilkinson-Berka J.L. Johnson D.W. Cox A. Soulis T. Wu L.-L. Kelly D.J. Jerums G. Pollock C.A. Cooper M.E.

Hishida A. Gold L.I. Border W.A. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 461-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that TGF-β1 augments the accumulation of glomerular matrix through its induction of collagen type I (23Kagami S. Kuhara T. Yasutomo K. Okada K. Loster K. Reutter W. Kuroda Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The most abundant fibrillar collagen expressed by a variety of cell types, collagen type I maintains the structural integrity of tissues such as bone, skin, organ capsules, and blood vessels (24Iruela-Arispe M.L.

Numerous studies have shown that collagen synthesis and deposition are regulated by TGF-β1 (28Grande J.P. Melder D.C. Zinsmeister A.R. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1997; 130: 476-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and by alterations in cell-extracellular matrix interactions that are accompanied by reorganization of the cytoskeletal network (29Varedi M. Ghahary A. Scott P.G. Tredget E.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 172: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Under pathological conditions, changes in regulatory pathways occur that can lead to the elevated expression of collagen type I (30Lenz O. Striker L.J. Jacot T.A. Elliot S.J. Killen P.D. Striker G.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 2040-2047PubMed Google Scholar), with eventual fibrosis or sclerosis and impaired organ function. Thus, it is critical to understand the different factors involved in the regulation of this predominant collagen. To investigate the function of SPARC in the regulation of collagen type I and TGF-β1, we chose a model in which we could study interactions among SPARC, collagen type I, and TGF-β1 in primary mesangial cell cultures from wild-type and SPARC-null mice. We present evidence that SPARC regulates the expression of both collagen type I and TGF-β1 in mouse mesangial cells. SPARC-null cells exhibited a significantly diminished expression of collagen type I and TGF-β1. After treatment of these cells with recombinant human (rh) SPARC, the levels of collagen type I and TGF-β1 were restored to 70% and 100%, respectively, of those produced by wild-type cells. Furthermore, we show that SPARC exhibits some of its effects on collagen type I expression via a TGF-β1-dependent pathway. Since TGF-β1 can induce the expression of SPARC under certain conditions (26Lloyd C.M. Minto A.W. Dorf M.E. Proudfoot A. Wells T.N. Salant D.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1371-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), it is likely that SPARC and TGF-β1 participate in a reciprocal, positive autocrine feedback loop that is especially prominent in mesangial cells. 129/SvJ × C57BL/6J wild-type and SPARC-null mice (31Norose K. Clark J.I. Syed N.A. Basu A. Heber-Katz E. Sage E.H. Howe C.C. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 2674-2680PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in a specific pathogen-free facility. Mice were euthanized at 3–6 months of age, and the kidneys were removed. The method for the preparation of primary mesangial cells is based on a partial collagenase digestion of isolated glomeruli (32Radeke H.H. Resch K. Clin. Invest. 1992; 70: 825-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The cortex was removed and was kept in sterile ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 120 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, and 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5). The following procedures were performed on ice. 1) The cortex was minced finely with a scalpel, and the homogenate was passed over sieves with meshes of 180 and 106 μm. 2) The next sieve, with a mesh of 45 μm, retained 98% of the glomeruli, which were washed 3 times with sterile PBS. 3) The glomeruli were digested for 15–25 min at 37 °C in a solution of collagenase (Worthington) (50 mg of collagenase type CLS 4, 184 units/ml, dissolved in 50 ml of PBS). The suspension was shaken every 3–5 min, and the digestion was stopped when thread-like collagen-containing fibers began to form on the glomeruli. The glomeruli were washed 2 times (4 °C, 150 ×g) in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (55%), F-12 Nutrient Mixture (20%) (Life Technologies, Inc.), fetal bovine serum (20%) (Summit Biotechnologies, Stoughton, MA), trace elements (1%) (Biofluids, Inc., Rockville, MD),l-glutamine (2 mm), transferrin (5 μg/ml), insulin (125 units/ml), penicillin G, (500 units/ml), streptomycin sulfate (500 units/ml), and amphotericin B (2 μg/ml) (Sigma)), placed in small culture flasks in 2 ml, and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. After 10–14 days, the preparation was checked microscopically. All cell populations except the mesangial cells were marked on the outside of the flask and were subsequently scraped off. For passages 0–3, the mesangial cells were grown to confluence in 50% fresh growth medium and 50% sterile-filtered conditioned medium. In these enriched populations of mesangial cells, there were no macrophages, endothelial- or epithelial-like cells, or fibroblasts, according to morphological criteria. In contrast to other glomerular cells, mesangial cells exhibited immunofluorescent staining for myosin, α-smooth muscle actin, desmin, vimentin, fibronectin, collagen type IV, and major histocompatibility complex class I antigen. The absence of von Willebrand factor and cytokeratins 18 and 19 indicated that endothelial and epithelial cell contamination was minimal. Furthermore, the use of mesangial cells after passage 3 essentially eliminates contamination by macrophages and endothelial cells, as these cell types do not survive multiple passaging under the culture conditions described above. Experiments were performed on five independent preparations of mesangial cells isolated from pools of 8 kidneys each. All experiments were repeated three times if not stated otherwise. Mesangial cells were detached in a solution of trypsin/EDTA (0.125%/0.010%, w/v) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and were replated at a split ratio of 1:3. The cells were used between passages 3 and 8. For the TGF-β1 assays, wild-type and SPARC-null cells were grown to 80% confluence in growth medium, as described above. The cells were washed 2 times with PBS and were changed into fresh growth medium for 96 h. To measure the amounts of TGF-β1 protein in the conditioned culture media of wild-type and SPARC-null cells, we used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (R & D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The assay was repeated five times. For the mRNA preparation, wild-type and SPARC-null cells were grown to 80% confluence in growth medium. Total cellular RNA was prepared from mesangial cells by a modified method (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63231) Google Scholar) that incorporated TRI-reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH). To increase the purity of the RNA samples, we added an additional step with 4m LiCl to eliminate residual contaminating polysaccharides, a DNase digestion step to eliminate DNA, and an additional precipitation of the RNA with ethanol. For preparation of cellular protein, wild-type and SPARC-null cells were grown to 80% confluence in growth medium. The insoluble (extracellular matrix proteins and membranes) and soluble cellular protein fractions were prepared either with the TRI-reagent or by dissolution of the cells in 1% SDS. The protein concentrations of the cell fractions were determined by the Bradford protein assay (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217450) Google Scholar). rhSPARC was prepared in SF9 cells by the use of the baculovirus protein expression system (35Bradshaw A.D. Francki A. Motamed K. Howe C.C. Sage E.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and was collected in serum-free medium. rhSPARC was isolated by anion-exchange chromatography and was identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and immunoblotting with a specific monoclonal anti-SPARC antibody (Haemotological Technologies, Essex Junction, VT). 2A. D. Bradshaw, J. A. Bassuk, and E. H. Sage, manuscript in preparation. The rhSPARC had activity similar to that of recombinant SPARC expressed inEscherichia coli (36Bassuk J.A. Baneyx F. Vernon R.B. Funk S.E. Sage E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 8-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and to SPARC synthesized by cultured mammalian cells (37Funk S.E. Sage E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2648-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), as measured by inhibition of proliferation and spreading (35Bradshaw A.D. Francki A. Motamed K. Howe C.C. Sage E.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). RT-PCR reactions containing 1 μg of total RNA were performed with the Access RT-PCR SystemTM (Promega) with oligonucleotide primers complementary to mouse β-tubulin, mouse ribosomal protein (rp) S6, mouse SPARC, mouse collagen α1(I) and α2(I), mouse collagen α1 (III), mouse collagen α1 (IV) and α2 (IV), mouse collagen α1 (VIII) and α2 (VIII), mouse fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), PDGF-A and -B chain, and TGF-β1. The primers were designed according to the Entrez nucleotide query program to retrieve the appropriate cDNAs from GenBankTM and the Primer selection TM 3 oligonucleotide search program. Furthermore, with the Amplify 1.2 program, the primer pairs were tested for “cross-annealing” such that up to three primer pairs could be used together in one PCR reaction (38Goswami P.C. Albee L.D. Spitz D.R. Ridnour L.A. Cell Proliferation. 1997; 30: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To establish conditions that allow comparison of the amounts of cDNA produced by RT-PCR, we varied the number of cycles from 24 to 40. For an internal standard, we either amplified β-tubulin mRNA or rpS6 mRNA, two ubiquitously expressed genes. After electrophoresis of 1/10 of the PCR reaction (5 μl), the bands (stained with ethidium bromide (EtBr), 0.5 μg/ml) became visible after 22 PCR cycles, and the staining reached saturation after 28 cycles. Therefore, a cycle number of 24 was chosen to compare the different levels of expression of the various mRNAs and to avoid saturation of the PCR DNA product and EtBr staining. The amounts of β-tubulin or rpS6 appeared to be unchanged between wild-type and SPARC-null cells. For quantification, values obtained from scanning densitometry of the cDNA bands generated from the respective mRNAs were normalized to the β-tubulin or rpS6 band. Since the β-tubulin/rpS6 and the other cDNAs were synthesized in the same tube, a direct comparison of the levels of expression is reasonable. Amplification of the newly synthesized first strand cDNA was performed in a Thermolyne Temptronic Thermal CyclerTM. Equivalent aliquots of each amplification reaction were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml EtBr in 0.04 mTris acetate, 0.001 m EDTA, pH 7.6. The gels were subjected to electrophoresis for 3 h at 100 V and were subsequently photographed. Primary mesangial cell cultures from wild-type and SPARC-null mice were grown to 80% confluence in the presence of 50 μg/ml sodium ascorbate for the final 24 h, and protein was prepared as described above. Equal amounts of protein per lane were resolved by SDS-PAGE (7% gels) under reducing conditions and were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, which were subsequently blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) in PBS. The blots were incubated with antibodies against collagen I (guinea pig anti-rat collagen I that cross-reacts with mouse collagen type I) (24Iruela-Arispe M.L. Vernon R.B. Wu H. Jaenisch R. Sage E.H. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) for 1 h. Immunoreactivity was detected by incubation of the blot with goat anti-guinea pig IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For assessment of differences in protein loading, the blot was incubated with rabbit anti-human α-enolase IgG (gift from Dr. E. Plow, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH) that cross-reacts with mouse α-enolase, followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. For metabolic labeling, the mesangial cells were grown to 80% confluence and were incubated with sodium ascorbate (50 μg/ml) for 24 h. Cultures were subsequently incubated in fresh growth medium containing 50 μCi/ml l-[2,3,4,5-3H]proline (100 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). After 18 h, media containing radiolabeled proteins were removed and mixed with a proteinase inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), centrifuged to remove cell debris, and dialyzed against 0.1 n acetic acid to remove unincorporated isotope. Incorporation of [3H]proline was measured in a scintillation counter, prior to lyophilization of the supernatants. The proteins were resuspended in collagenase buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2) to reflect equal amounts of cpm/ml. Aliquots of the supernatants were digested for 16 h with bacterial collagenase (Worthington). Equal volumes of supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8% gels), stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R, and incubated in EnhanceTM(NEN Life Science Products) prior to fluorography. Primary mesangial cell cultures from wild-type and SPARC-null mice were plated on glass coverslips, incubated with sodium ascorbate (50 μg/ml) for 24 h, and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Paraformaldehyde was removed by three 5-min washes each with PBS. The coverslips were incubated for 30 min in 2% normal goat serum to block nonspecific binding and 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) to solubilize the cell membranes. Subsequently, the cells were incubated for 1 h with antibodies against collagen type I. After three rinses in PBS, the coverslips were incubated for 30 min with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG. Immunoreactivity was visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon, Inc., Garden City, NY). To determine whether the effects of exogenous SPARC were exerted through a TGF-β1-dependent pathway, we cultured cells as described above and treated them with or without the following: (i) anti-TGF-β1-blocking antibodies (polyclonal goat anti-human IgG, R & D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) at a final concentration of 30 μg/ml; (ii) rhSPARC (30 μg/ml, 0.9 μm); (iii) rhTGF-β1 (1, 5, and 10 ng/ml); and (iv) either rhSPARC or rhTGF-β1 together with anti-TGF-β1-blocking antibodies for 0–6 h. As a control we used an irrelevant polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector). Total RNA was prepared as described above, and the levels of mouse α1(I) and mouse TGF-β1 mRNA were determined. All immunocytochemistry slides, autoradiograms, immunoblots, and agarose gels were photographed and converted to digital computer files with a UMAX S-6E scannerTM and Adobe Photoshop softwareTM. Files were processed and analyzed by NIH Image softwareTM and are presented as composite figures. SPARC has been implicated as a modulator of interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix. It is known to bind to growth factors and to matricellular proteins as well as to matrix proteins. Alterations in cell-matrix interactions usually occur during wound healing, tissue remodeling, and fibrosis (29Varedi M. Ghahary A. Scott P.G. Tredget E.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 172: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Since SPARC (14Pichler R.H. Bassuk J.A. Hugo C. Reed M.J. Eng E. Gordon K.L. Pippin J. Alpers C.E. Couser W.G. Sage E.H.

Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 461-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) were among the proteins shown to be augmented during mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, we examined the effect of SPARC on the expression of collagen type I and TGF-β1 in mesangial cells cultured from wild-type and SPARC-null mice. The following results were observed in five independent preparations of mesangial cells isolated from pools of eight kidneys each. The experiments were performed four times with all five preparations. Means ± S.D. were calculated for all experiments. One of the first observations we made was that SPARC-null mesangial cells proliferated faster and exhibited a more rounded, cobblestone-like cell shape in comparison to their wild-type counterparts (35Bradshaw A.D. Francki A. Motamed K. Howe C.C. Sage E.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Confluent monolayers of SPARC-null mesangial cells displayed very few of the hillocks (localized accumulations of extracellular matrix) that typify mesangial cell cultures. Mesangial cells also produced diminished levels of collagen type I, as shown in Fig. 1. Wild-type cells incubated with anti-collagen type I antibody exhibited a typical granular staining pattern throughout the cytoplasm (A), whereas SPARC-null cells showed significantly less staining for collagen type I (B). Immunoreactivity with an irrelevant antibody or the secondary antibody alone was negative (data not shown). The amount of procollagen type I secreted by the SPARC-null cells was also considerably diminished, relative to levels produced by wild-type cells (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and3). Digestion of the secreted protein with collagenase (Fig.2, lanes 2 and 4) prior to SDS-PAGE confirmed the identity of these bands as procollagen and its processed α chains. Under the conditions used for SDS-PAGE, the α1(I) and the α2(I) chains comigrated in our metabolic labeling and immunoblotting experiments. Collagen type I mRNA was detectable in mesangial cells by RT-PCR. The initial amounts of reverse-transcribed mRNAs for α1(I) were significantly lower in the SPARC-null cells (lane 2) in comparison with those in wild-type cells (lane 1) (Fig.3 A). By scanning densitometry with β-tubulin or rpS6 as an internal control, we found consistently diminished levels of α1(I) mRNA relative to that of wild-type cells, with a mean value of 44 ± 3%, a decrease of 2.2-fold (Table I). Similar decreases in α2(I) mRNA were seen in SPARC-null cells by RT-PCR. Relative to wild-type cells, levels of α2(I) mRNA in SPARC-null cells were diminished by 53 ± 4% (1.9-fold). Since the changes in expression of α2(I) were quantitatively similar to those of the α1(I) chain, only the latter has been shown.Table IExpression of collagen type I mRNA in wild-type and SPARC-null mesangial cellsWild-typeSPARC-null1.

https://openalex.org/W2031037573,"The proline-rich domain of synaptojanin 1, a synaptic protein with phosphatidylinositol phosphatase activity, binds to amphiphysin and to a family of recently discovered proteins known as the SH3p4/8/13, the SH3-GL, or the endophilin family. These interactions are mediated by SH3 domains and are believed to play a regulatory role in synaptic vesicle recycling. We have precisely mapped the target peptides on human synaptojanin that are recognized by the SH3 domains of endophilins and amphiphysin and proven that they are distinct. By a combination of different approaches, selection of phage displayed peptide libraries, substitution analyses of peptides synthesized on cellulose membranes, and a peptide scan spanning a 252-residue long synaptojanin fragment, we have concluded that amphiphysin binds to two sites, PIRPSR and PTIPPR, whereas endophilin has a distinct preferred binding site, PKRPPPPR. The comparison of the results obtained by phage display and substitution analysis permitted the identification of proline and arginine at positions 4 and 6 in the PIRPSR and PTIPPR target sequence as the major determinants of the recognition specificity mediated by the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1. More complex is the structural rationalization of the preferred endophilin ligands where SH3 binding cannot be easily interpreted in the framework of the “classical” type I or type II SH3 binding models.

Given the relatively low specificity of peptide recognition mediated by SH3 domains, it is not clear whether all these interactions, which are identified in vitro, are of functional significance. A second question that arises is whether SH3 domains bind rather unspecifically to many sites along the PRD or rather form specific complexes by binding to unique and distinct sites. proline-rich domains glutathione S-transferase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay phosphate-buffered saline polymerase chain reaction synaptojanin proline-rich domains glutathione S-transferase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay phosphate-buffered saline polymerase chain reaction synaptojanin Dynamin, synaptojanin, and synapsin, three proteins that are concentrated in the pre-synaptic region of nerve terminals, bear proline-rich regions that bind to diverse SH3-containing proteins. Synapsin I is the main synaptic ligand of the SH3 domain of the adapter protein Grb2 in vitro (2McPherson P.S. Czernik A.J. Chilcote T.J. Onofri F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. Schlessinger J. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6486-6490Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Recently it has been reported that the same proline-rich D region of synapsin I interacts with c-Src and stimulates its tyrosine kinase activity (5Onofri F. Giovedi S. Vaccaro P. Czernik A.J. Valtorta F. De Camilli P. Greengard P. Benfenati F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12168-12173Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of these interactions is not clear yet. In contrast, strong evidence supports the notion that disruption of the interaction between amphiphysin and the PRD of dynamin impairs synaptic vesicle endocytosis (6Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Dynamin is a GTPase that forms a collar at the neck of forming endocytic vesicles and participates in the fission process that results in the formation of free vesicles (7Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Several other SH3-containing proteins have been shown to bind to dynamin in vitro (1Gout I. Dhand R.

This protein was initially discovered as it binds to the SH3 domains of Grb2 (2McPherson P.S. Czernik A.J. Chilcote T.J. Onofri F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. Schlessinger J. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6486-6490Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and was subsequently characterized as an inositol 5-phosphatase that dephosphorylates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate at the 5 position of the inositol ring (11McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). A direct involvement of synaptojanin in vesicle endocytosis has not been demonstrated. However, its localization, and the recognition that phosphate metabolism is implicated in a variety of membrane trafficking events (12De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), has steered considerable interest in its potential role in endocytosis. Confirming this notion, the disruption of three synaptojanin orthologous yeast genes, singly and in pairs, resulted in mutant strains with abnormal vacuolar and plasma membrane morphology as well as increased sensitivity to osmotic stress and defects in endocytosis (13Srinivasan S.

Camilli P.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3347-3356PubMed Google Scholar). Finally the carboxyl terminus of synaptojanin binds to the SH3 domains of amphiphysins (isoforms 1 and 2), an eterodimeric protein with an established role in endocytosis (6Shupliakov O. Low P.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5273-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Recently, another SH3-containing protein of 40 kDa was found to bind to synaptojanin in overlay assays or in the yeast 2-hybrid system (3de Heuvel E. Bell A.W. Ramjaun A.R. Wong K. Sossin W.S. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8710-8716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 18Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). This 40-kDa protein is a member of a family of three very homologous proteins that were originally identified in a mouse expression library (19Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and independently cloned by a degenerate oligonucleotide amplification approach from human brain cDNA (20Giachino C. Lantelme E. Lanzetti L. Saccone S. Bella Valle G. Migone N. Genomics. 1997; 41: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The members of this family were named SH3p4, SH3p8, and SH3p16 in mouse and GL2, GL1, and GL3 in man. Recently, Micheva et al. (22Micheva K.D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) have proposed to rename SH3p4/GL2 into endophilin, based on its affinity for several endocytic proteins. Here, for sake of clarity, we will refer to all three members of this family as endophilins while maintaining the SH3-GL numbering. Thus endophilins 1, 2, and 3 correspond to SH3-GL1/SH3p3, SH3-GL2/SH3p4, and SH3-GL3/SH3p13, respectively. The three members of the endophilin family bind to synaptojanin isoform 1 but not to isoform 2 (21Nemoto Y. Arribas M. Haffner C. DeCamilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30817-30821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Endophilin 2 has been more extensively characterized because of its prominent localization in the central nervous system (18Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 20Giachino C. Lantelme E. Lanzetti L. Saccone S. Bella Valle G. Migone N. Genomics. 1997; 41: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The suggestion that the SH3-mediated binding of amphiphysin and endophilin 2 to synaptojanin 1 is of physiological significance is reinforced by the observation that the three proteins form two distinct complexes that can be immunoprecipitated from brain extracts (22Micheva K.D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Amphiphysin is found in a complex with synaptojanin 1 and dynamin, whereas endophilin 2 can be immunoprecipitated with synaptojanin 1. In this work we describe the recognition specificity of the SH3 domains of amphiphysin 1 and endophilins and the mapping of their binding sites on the synaptojanin 1 PRD. Library construction and panning were performed as described (23Felici F. Castagnoli L. Musacchio A. Jappelli R. Cesareni G. J. Mol.

Briefly, 2–20 μg of GST-SH3 fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B gel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were incubated with 1010 infectious particles from a nonapeptide library. After washing 10 times with PBS, 0.5% Tween 20, the bound phage was eluted with 100 mmglycine HCl, pH 2.2. After three selection cycles, the binding of isolated clones was confirmed by ELISA. Microtiter wells were coated with 109 particles of a clonal phage stock and incubated with 0.2 μg of GST-SH3 fusion protein. The wells were then washed 10 times with PBS, 0.1 Tween 20, and bound protein was detected with anti-GST goat primary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a secondary anti-goat monoclonal alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Sigma). Clones with strong SH3 binding activity were selected for further analysis. The sequence of the peptides displayed by positive clones were determined by manual and automatic (ABI PRISM 310 Perkin-Elmer) sequencing of phage single-stranded DNA using universal M13–40 primer. An endophilin 1 clone from a human fetal brain cDNA library (20Giachino C. Lantelme E. Lanzetti L. Saccone S. Bella Valle G. Migone N. Genomics. 1997; 41: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was used as template in PCR to generate endophilin 1-SH3 coding fragment (residues 302–368) with the forward primer 5′-AGGGATCCATGGCGCCCCTGGACCAG-3′ (GL1-F12) and the reverse primer 5′-GGGAATTCTGCCGGCCAGTGTGGACG-3′ (GL1-R16). Similarly an endophilin 2 clone was used as template to generate an endophilin 2-SH3 coding fragment (residues 286–352) with the forward primer 5′-AGGGATCCGGTGTCCAAATGGATCAGC (GL2-F8) and with the reverse primer 5′-GGGAATTCGAGCCAGCCAGCATAACATC (GL2-R7). Finally EST 22353 clone was used as template to generate endophilin 3-SH3 fusion (residues 281–347) using the forward primer 5′-AGGGATCCAACATTCCCATGGACCAG-3′(GL3-F10) and the reverse primer 5′-GGTGTGAATTCATTTCAGTTACGA-3′ (GL3-R2). All the endophilin-SH3 coding fragments were cloned in frame into BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as suggested by the producers. A λgt10 cDNA expression library from human fetal brain was used as a template in PCR with Super Taq DNA polymerase (HT Biotechnology LTD) to generate the amphiphysin I-SH3 GST fusion (residues 620–695). The amphiphysin SH3 domain coding sequence was amplified with the forward primer 5′-CTCAGGGATCCCCTCCTGGCTTTCTCTAC (Af) and the reverse primer 5′-CTTGTGAATTCAATCTAAGCGTCGGGTGAAG (Ar). The synaptojanin DNA fragment encoding the proline-rich carboxyl-terminal region called F1 (residues 1058–1119) was isolated, by PCR amplification, from a human brain cDNA library. The fragment was amplified with the forward primer 5′-CTACAGGATCCGAGGGTCCTGTACCT (F1-f) and the reverse primer 5′-GTGGGGGAATTCGGCGTGTGGGAGGGGCGA (F1-r). Synaptojanin mutants of the fragment F1 called F1-a1m and F1-e2m were obtained by PCR amplification with mutagenic oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides utilized to mutagenize the putative amphiphysin ad endophilin targets were CGAGGGTCCTGTACCTTCACTTCCCATCCCACCAAGCCCAGCACCGTCA (a1m-f) and GGCGTGTGGGAGGGGCGACAGGGCGGGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGGGGCTCCAAG (e2m-r) respectively. The synaptojanin DNA fragment encoding the proline-rich carboxyl-terminal region F2 (residues 1110–1222) was isolated by PCR from a human brain cDNA library. The fragment was amplified with the forward primer 5′-AAGAGAGGATCCCCACCCCGCCCGGTCGCC (F2-f) and with the reverse primer 5′-GCTTTTGAATTCAGGAGTCAGTCTTCCAGCA (F2-r). Synaptojanin mutant of the fragment F2, F2-a2m, was obtained using the U.S.E. Mutagenic Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-CCAGCAGGAGGAGGACTCGTCGGTCTGGC. The synaptojanin DNA fragment encoding the region F3 (residues 1212–1302) was isolated by PCR from a human brain cDNA library with the forward primer 5′-CACAGGGATCCGCGCGGGCATCTGCTGGA (F3-f) and with the reverse primer 5′-ACTTGGAATTCTGAGGAAGCTTCTGAAGG (F3-r). All synaptojanin fragment were cloned in frame intoBamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rat synaptosomal extracts (25Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Strips were blocked overnight at 4 °C in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% dry milk (blocking solution) and then incubated with 10 μg/ml of the indicated fusion domain in blocking solution for 4 h at room temperature. The Immobilon-P filters were then washed in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and the bound proteins were detected with anti-GST primary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a secondary anti-goat monoclonal alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Sigma). In the binding assay different amounts of the indicated fusion domains were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto Immobilon-P membranes that were incubated in blocking solution for 5 h at 4 °C. The filters were then incubated with 10 μg/ml hybrid GST proteins phosphorylated with bovine heart protein kinase (Sigma). Peptides bound to continuous cellulose membrane supports were prepared by automated spot synthesis (Abimed, Langenfeld, Germany; Software LISA, Jerini BioTools GmbH, Berlin, Germany) using Whatman 50 cellulose membrane (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) as described previously in detail (26Frank R.

In order to determine the recognition specificity of the human amphiphysin and endophilins SH3 domains, we used these domains to select peptide ligands from a peptide repertoire displayed by fusion to the major capsid protein of filamentous f1 phage. The SH3 domains of amphiphysin 1 and endophilins 1, 2, and 3 were produced by cloning their coding sequence into a GST fusion expression vector, and the affinity purified domains were used to pan a nonapeptide library (23Felici F.

After three selection cycles, 20 single clones, derived from each of the four panning experiments, were tested by phage ELISA, and the amino acid sequence of the peptides displayed by the positive ones (approximately 50%) were derived from the DNA sequence of the gene VIII insert. In Fig. 1 we have aligned the peptide sequences, obtained from each selection experiment, to maximize peptide homology. Endophilins 1 and 2 selected a limited number of peptides that were found repeatedly and whose amino acid sequence can be represented by the consensus P+RPPXpr, where the residues in capital letters are always found at the corresponding position in each selected peptide, + represents either Lys or Arg, andX any amino acid. The SH3 domain of endophilin 3 is more tolerant in the second position of the consensus, where other residues aside from Arg and Lys can be accepted. The P+RPPXpr motif is always preceded either by a positively charged residue or by the phenylalanine that in the PVIII phage coat protein immediately precedes the inserted peptide. The SH3 domain of amphiphysin, in contrast, selects peptides that conform to the consensus RPXR. Since the amino acid sequences of these peptides can be aligned without shifting their frame, it is possible that flanking residues in the pVIII coding sequence may be important in the binding process. To confirm their recognition specificity, we tested the four domains, plus the SH3 of the MYO3 yeast protein as a control, by phage ELISA against a panel of phage clones whose sequences were considered representative of the consensus in Fig. 1. As illustrated in Fig.2, phages displaying peptides containing the PKRPP or PRRPP motifs were recognized by the three SH3 of the endophilins but not from the ones of amphiphysin 1 or the control MYO3p. In contrast, peptides containing a single positively charged residue, PPRPP or PQRPP, only reacted with endophilin 3. Finally, peptides conforming to the consensus derived from the amphiphysin 1 panning experiment predominantly bound to the amphiphysin SH3. In order to confirm the results obtained by phage display, we performed a competition experiment in which overlay binding of endophilin 2 SH3 was carried out in the presence of 100 μm of the biotinylated peptide GSGSPKRPPLPRS. In these conditions the dynamin and synaptojanin signals (3de Heuvel E. Bell A.W. Ramjaun A.R. Wong K. Sossin W.S. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8710-8716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) are reduced by approximately 70% and completely disappear when the peptide is tetramerized with streptavidin (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and4). No reduction in signal is observed when a tetramerized peptide specific for the Abl SH3 domain (GSGSAPTYPPPLPP) is used for competition (lane 5). Similar results are obtained by competing with a phage displayed peptide (lanes 6–8). Inspection of the synaptojanin sequence revealed two putative targets, in the carboxyl-terminal PRD, that match the endophilin 2 and amphiphysin recognition consensus P+RPPXpr and RPXR. To verify, with a phage independent approach, the SH3 binding ability of these sequences and to identify the residues that are essential for binding, we have synthesized peptides on a cellulose membrane representing all possible single amino acid substitution analogs (30Kramer A. Keitel T. Winkler K. Stocklein W. Hohne W. Schneider-Mergener J. Cell. 1997; 91: 799-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) of the synaptojanin-derived peptides LPIRPSRAPSR (Syn1064–1074) and LEPKRPPPPRP (Syn1103–1113) (where boldface indicates the residues that match the consensus deduced from the results of the phage display experiments). The 460 matrix-bound peptides generated by this approach were then probed with the SH3 domains of amphiphysin 1 and endophilin 2 cross-linked to horseradish peroxidase (Fig. 4). As predicted, the amphiphysin SH3 domain binds efficiently to peptide Syn1064–1074 while there is hardly any binding to peptide Syn1103–1113 (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, the intensity of the binding signal is sensitive to substitutions in the RPXR motif, confirming the phage display analysis. The proline and the second arginine in the motif are absolutely required, whereas the first arginine tolerates substitutions with isoleucine, proline, or valine. The first proline of the canonical SH3 recognition motif PXXP can also be substituted with large hydrophobic residues (Phe, Ile, Leu, Met, and Val) with minimal variations in binding signal. Most of the single amino acid substitutions of peptide LEPKRPPPPRP do not react with the amphiphysin SH3 domain. Interestingly the most reactive spot corresponds to a peptide that, as a result of mutagenesis, contains an RPXR motif (LEPKRPPRPRP. Surprisingly, and somewhat in contrast with the phage ELISA experiment, the endophilin 2 SH3 domain binds with higher affinity to peptide Syn1064–1074 than to peptide Syn1103–1113(Fig. 4 B). The substitution analysis reveals that peptide 2 does not bind to the endophilin SH3 because of the negatively charged residue that precedes the PKRPP motif. Whenever the Glu at position 2 is changed into a residue with either a positive or a hydrophobic side chain, binding is restored. This is in accord with the results of the phage display experiment that indicated that positive residues and Phe are preferred at that position (see Fig. 1). When a 5-fold higher membrane-bound peptide concentration is used in a similar experiment, a stronger signal is obtained, and residues that are important for recognition specificity are revealed (Fig. 4 C). Cys and negatively charged residues are hardly admitted at any position. Consistent with the phage display results, the residues in the PKRPPXPR motif do not tolerate the vast majority of substitutions. The endophilin SH3 binds to peptide Syn1064–1074 only marginally less efficiently than the amphiphysin SH3. Binding, however, is less specific and displays a different sensitivity to amino acid substitutions. Substitution of the first Arg of the RPXR motif severely affects binding, whereas the second Arg tolerates hydrophobic side chains. The remaining peptide residues are rather tolerant as long as Cys, Asp, Glu, or Tyr are avoided. According to the substitution analysis, the peptide LEPKRPPPPRP is a suboptimal ligand for the endophilin SH3 domain. In order to identify alternative sequences in synaptojanin that may be involved in endophilin and amphiphysin SH3 binding, we synthesized 126 overlapping undecapeptides spanning the entire carboxyl-terminal region of human synaptojanin (Fig. 5). In agreement with the phage display experiment, the amphiphysin SH3 reacts with cellulose-bound peptides containing the sequence LPIRPSR (region A1) that exactly matches the RPXR consensus. Two more regions, containing thePTIPPRA (region A2) and PPQPPPRSR (region A3) sequences, showed significant binding in agreement with the substitution experiment that indicated that the first arginine in the motif could be substituted with isoleucine or proline. More complex is the binding pattern obtained with the endophilin SH3. We identified three main regions as putative ligands of this domain. Regions E1 and E3 overlap sequences that were already mapped as amphiphysin targets (A1 and A3), whereas region E2 probably including two binding motifs, encompasses the endophilin binding consensus PKRPP, and extends approximately 15 amino acids beyond. The likely biological significance of these SH3 target sites is supported by the observation that their sequences and binding properties are conserved in the rat synaptojanin (not shown). To confirm the mapping of SH3 targets obtained with the Pep-Scan experiment, we expressed three different fragments of the synaptojanin carboxyl terminus, as fusion to GST. Fragment 1 (F1) contains targets A1 (E1) and E2, fragment 2 (F2) E2′ and A2, and fragment 3 (F3) A3 (E3) (Fig.6 A). Fig. 6 Breports the results of an overlay experiment where the three fragments were transferred to nitrocellulose filters and probed with32P-labeled chimeric GST-SH3 proteins. Both the amphiphysin and endophilin SH3 bind to fragment F1. F2 binds to amphiphysin and to a lesser degree to endophilin. Interestingly the endophilin SH3 binds to the degradation products of the GST-F2 protein as efficiently as to the full-length protein, whereas the amphiphysin SH3 only binds to the non-degraded protein. This suggests that the first domain binds to the NH2-terminal side of the F2 fragment, whereas the latter binds to a peptide target that is close to the COOH-terminal side. Finally fragment F3 contains a target site for amphiphysin only. These results are in agreement with the Pep-Scan experiment that suggested that synaptojanin contains multiple binding sites for the amphiphysin and endophilin SH3s. At the same time, they contribute to rank the affinities of the putative peptide targets in a larger protein context: A1 ≈ A2 > A3 and E1 + E2 > E2′ ≫ E3. To map precisely the SH3 target peptides, predicted by the phage display and Pep-Scan experiments, in this larger protein context, we expressed fusion proteins containing fragments of synaptojanin mutated in the strongest putative binding sites, A1 (E1), E2, and A2 (Fig.6 C). The endophilin SH3 binds to the synaptojanin fragment carrying a mutation in the A1(E1) site as efficiently as the wild type fragment, whereas most of the affinity is lost when the two positively charged residues in the PKRPPP motif are changed into Pro (e2m). In contrast, amphiphysin recognition of the F1 fragment is almost abolished when the LPIRPSR motif in the A1 site is changed into LPIPPSP (a1m). Finally the binding of the amphiphysin SH3 to the F2 fragment is dependent on the PTIPPR peptide (A2) identified by Pep-Scan since binding is abolished when the sequence is changed into PTSPPP (a2m). In contrast to the Pep-Scan analysis, this last experiment suggests that, in a larger protein context, the peptide PKRPPXPR is the major target of the endophilin 2-SH3. To exclude artifacts due to the technical approach, we confirmed this conclusion by analyzing the binding of the endophilin SH3 (cross-linked to tos"

Nearly all of the effectors known to interact with activated Eph receptors are well characterized signaling proteins that contain SH2 domains.

Saltiel A.R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30154-30157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Src-like adaptor protein is the only novel protein identified because of its interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of an Eph receptor (17Pandey A. Duan H. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19201-19204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Src-like adaptor protein consists of an Src homology 2 (SH2)2 and an SH3 domain but does not have a catalytic domain, and its function is unknown. To further characterize the signaling pathways activated downstream of Eph receptors, we have searched for proteins that interact with autophosphorylated sequence motifs of Eph receptors. We employed the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a mouse embryo cDNA library using the phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain of EphB2 (18Pasquale E.B. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 523-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) as the bait (12Zisch A.H. Kalo M.S. Chong L.D. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2657-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,19Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Two of the isolated clones encoded a protein fragment that was distantly related to the SH2 domains of known proteins. Using expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases and RT-PCR, we obtained a full-length sequence for this novel protein, which we have designated SHEP1 (forSH2 domain-containing Eph receptor-bindingprotein 1). The structural features of SHEP1 suggest that this protein may be an important signaling intermediate downstream of the Eph receptors. Screening of the GenBankTM EST data base using the BLAST algorithm with the partial SHEP1 sequence isolated from the two-hybrid screen retrieved partially overlapping clones containing additional sequences. Further rounds of EST data base searches and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplifications of several murine tissues with the sense primer AGCGGCCGCCCTGGTACCATGGACGCATC (containing aNotI site, underlined) and the antisense primer GAGGACCTTGTCGAACTTCT yielded the entire coding sequence of SHEP1. The L40 yeast strain was co-transformed with LexA-EphB2 cytoplasmic domain constructs (12Zisch A.H. Kalo M.S. Chong L.D. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2657-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and a VP16-SHEP1 SH2 domain construct. Co-transformants were first selected on uracil, leucine, tryptophan-deficient medium and replated to test for interaction by growth assay on histidine-deficient medium. The 293T human embryonal kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C. Superfect (Qiagen)-mediated transfections were carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 24–48 h post-transfection. A GST fusion protein of the SHEP1 SH2 domain (aa 167–324) was expressed in bacteria and purified on glutathione-agarose for injection into rabbits. The immune serum was affinity-purified on a GST-SHEP1 SH2 domain column and then absorbed on a GST-ShcB SH2 domain column to eliminate cross-reacting antibodies. A fusion protein of the extracellular region of the EphB2 receptor and the Fc portion of human IgG1 heavy chain (20Shao H. Lou L. Pandey A. Pasquale E.B. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26606-26609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the antigen to produce anti-EphB2 antibodies and for affinity purification. The anti-EphB2 antibodies were absorbed on a human Fc column (Cappel). Transiently transfected 293T cells and adult mouse spleen were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and sodium orthovanadate. Extracts were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose (for immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies) or with staphylococcus A (for immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies) and then immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody bound to protein G-Sepharose or anti-EphB2 or anti-SHEP1 polyclonal antibodies bound to staphylococcus A. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore Corp.), and probed with peroxidase-conjugated PY20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Transduction Laboratories), anti-Myc 9E10 antibody followed by a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody, or polyclonal antibodies followed by peroxidase-conjugated protein A. Detection was with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST fusion proteins of the SHEP1 SH2 domain (aa 167–324), the SHEP1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain (aa 474–854), or GST alone were expressed in bacteria and purified on glutathione-agarose beads. Transiently transfected 293T cells were lysed in Brij 96 buffer (1% Brij 96, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture) for the SH2 domain binding assay or lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Brij 96 replaced with 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) for the GEF domain binding assay. Cell extracts were precleared with GST for 30 min at 4 °C followed by incubation with the appropriate GST fusion protein for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins that bound to the beads were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane followed by immunoblotting with anti-EphB2 and EphA4 polyclonal (21Soans C. Holash J.A. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3353-3361PubMed Google Scholar) antibodies, anti-Flag polyclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or the anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody. This assay was performed essentially as described (22Debant A. Serra-Pages C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified GST-GTPase fusion proteins were incubated for 30 min at RT with 3H-labeled GDP in exchange buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Reactions were then quenched with stop exchange buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and diluted with reaction stop buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm GTPγS). Purified GST fusion proteins of the GEF domains of SHEP1, yeast CDC25, or GST as a control were added to aliquots of the GDP-loaded proteins. The reactions were stopped at the times indicated by filtration through a nitrocellulose filter (Millipore) and washing with stop buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2). Filters were air-dried, and the amount of radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. The cytoplasmic domain of the EphB2 receptor tyrosine kinase expressed as a LexA fusion protein was used to screen a VP16 mouse embryo library. The kinase domain of EphB2 is highly active in yeast, resulting in tyrosine autophosphorylation on several residues (12Zisch A.H. Kalo M.S. Chong L.D. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2657-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a large proportion of the clones isolated from the screen encoded the SH2 domains of known signaling molecules. Two identical clones corresponding to a partial sequence of a novel SH2 domain were also isolated (schematically shown in Fig.1 B). We designated the novel protein SHEP1. Screening of EST data bases with the novel SHEP1 sequence revealed a number of mouse (Fig. 1 B) and human (not shown) SHEP1 sequences as well as sequences corresponding to a second closely related protein, which we designated SHEP2 (not shown). The SHEP1 cDNA encodes an 854-amino acid protein (Fig. 1 A). A stop codon in frame with the initial methionine is present in the 5′-untranslated sequence (not shown), indicating that the entire coding sequence was identified. A phylogenetic tree (Fig.2 A) illustrates the relationship between the SHEP1 SH2 domain and other previously known SH2 domains. The program ProfileScan (23Bairoch A. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) also indicated the presence of a weak but significant homology between the carboxyl-terminal portion of SHEP1 and CDC25-like Ras GEF domains (24Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). The SHEP1 sequences corresponding to the three structurally conserved regions (SCRs) characteristic of GEF domains are highlighted in Fig. 1 A. Additional sequence similarities are present throughout the GEF domain. The relationship between the GEF domain of SHEP1 and other previously known GEF domains is illustrated in the phylogenetic tree shown in Fig. 2 B. The SHEP1 GEF domain is somewhat divergent from those previously identified, as indicated by the longer branch connecting SHEP1 to the tree. A notable feature of SHEP1 in the region between the SH2 domain and the GEF domain is the high proportion of prolines (13% of the amino acids) and serines (21% of the amino acids) (Fig. 1 A). The proline residues form five PXXP motifs, which conform to the consensus sequence of SH3 domain binding sites (25Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). This proline/serine-rich region also contains many potential sites of phosphorylation by proline-directed kinases, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (26Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Finally, five tyrosines are present in the serine/proline-rich region of SHEP1, and four are in the amino-terminal segment that precedes the SH2 domain (Fig. 1 A). If phosphorylated, these tyrosines may create binding sites for SH2 or phosphotyrosine-binding domains (27Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). When SHEP1 was identified, its sequence was not closely related to that of any other known protein. While this work was in progress, sequences closely related to SHEP1 were submitted to GenBankTM, which showed that SHEP1 is part of a family of proteins. The SHEP1 family includes HrSH2 (GenBankTM accession number AB010891), a protein of unknown function isolated from the tunicateHalocynthia roretzi, and BCAR3 (breastcancer anti-estrogen resistance gene 3; GenBankTM accession number U92715), a protein isolated based on its ability to confer tamoxifen resistance to estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells (28van Agthoven T. van Agthoven T.L. Dekker A. van der Spek P.J. Vreede L. Dorssers L.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2799-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). BCAR3 is the same protein that we had designated SHEP2. The SHEP1 EST clones (Fig. 1 B) were obtained from a wide variety of embryonic and adult tissues, and by RT-PCR we found that SHEP1 transcripts are present in adult brain, spleen, and thymus as well as embryonic brain (Fig. 3 A). Hence, SHEP1 mRNA has widespread expression, suggesting that SHEP1 functions in a number of embryonic and adult tissues. To study the SHEP1 protein, we generated a polyclonal antibody to amino acids 167–324 of SHEP1. With this antibody, we immunoprecipitated a single 130-kDa protein from adult mouse spleen and from 293T cells transfected with full-length SHEP1 cDNA (Fig. 3 B). Notably, the apparent size of the SHEP1 protein determined by SDS-PAGE is substantially larger than the size of 94 kDa calculated based on the amino acid sequence, suggesting that the mature protein may be post-translationally modified. To further characterize the binding of SHEP1 to Eph receptors, we incubated an immobilized GST fusion protein of the SH2 domain of SHEP1 with extracts of 293T cells expressing tyrosine-phosphorylated EphB2 or EphA4 (12Zisch A.H. Kalo M.S. Chong L.D. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2657-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting showed that the Eph receptors bind the SH2 domain of SHEP1 (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that SHEP1 interacts with full-length Eph receptors belonging to both the A and the B subclass (29Flanagan J.G. Gale N.W. Hunter T. Pasquale E.B. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1997; 90: 403-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Two-hybrid analysis with LexA-EphB2 fusion proteins showed that the SHEP1 SH2 domain interacts with wild-type, phosphorylated EphB2 but not with a kinase-inactive, unphosphorylated mutant (K662R) (12Zisch A.H. Kalo M.S. Chong L.D. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2657-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Mutation of tyrosine 605 in the juxtamembrane domain of EphB2 to glutamic acid (Y605E) or phenylalanine (Y605F) also abrogated binding. This result indicates that this tyrosine is required for binding of the SHEP1 SH2 domain. Mutation of tyrosine 611 to phenylalanine (Y611F), a mutation that severely impairs kinase activity and autophosphorylation (12Zisch A.H. Kalo M.S. Chong L.D. Pasquale E.B.

Binding, however, was preserved when tyrosine 611 was mutated to glutamic acid (Y611E), a mutation that does not impair kinase activity and autophosphorylation. 3Zisch, A. H., Pazzagli, C., Freeman, A. L., Schneller, M., Hadman, M., Smith, J. W., Ruoslahti, E., and Pasquale, E. B., Oncogene, in press. This indicates that juxtamembrane tyrosine 611 is not required for binding of the SHEP1 SH2 domain. Finally, no binding of SHEP1 to EphB2 was observed when both tyrosines 605 and 611 were mutated to phenylalanine (Y605F/Y611F) or to glutamic acid (Y605E/Y611E). The association of SHEP1 with EphB2 was further verified by co-immunoprecipitation. EphB2 and a Myc-tagged SHEP1 construct containing the SH2 domain were co-transfected in 293T cells, and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with either anti-Myc antibodies or anti-EphB2 antibodies. Probing by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed the presence of EphB2 in the SHEP1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5). Conversely, tyrosine-phosphorylated SHEP1 was detected in the EphB2 immunoprecipitates. Probing with anti-Myc antibodies revealed that SHEP1 expressed in the absence of EphB2 had a lower apparent molecular weight than SHEP1 co-expressed with EphB2. These results suggest that EphB2 causes SHEP1 phosphorylation, probably on multiple residues. The presence of both an SH2 and a GEF domain in SHEP1 suggests a novel signaling pathway linked to small Ras superfamily GTPases. GEF domains typically bind and activate small GTPases closely related to Ras (24Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, 30Quilliam L.A. Khosravi-Far R. Huff S.Y. Der C.J. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Because other results have revealed a connection between EphB2 and R-Ras,1 we hypothesized that SHEP1 may bind R-Ras and serve as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for this GTPase. R-Ras is a member of the Ras family that has been shown to regulate integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesion downstream of EphB2 (31Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar).1 No exchange factor specific for R-Ras has been reported (32Gotoh T. Niino Y. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18602-18607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33Huff S.Y. Quilliam L.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine whether SHEP1 binds to R-Ras, we incubated a GST fusion protein containing the GEF domain of SHEP1 with extracts of cells transfected with FLAG-tagged constructs of the small Ras family GTPases Ha-Ras, R-Ras, RalA, and Rap1A. Probing the bound proteins with anti-Flag antibodies revealed the presence of substantial levels of R-Ras and Rap1A associated with GST-SHEP1 (Fig.6 A). Proteins containing CDC25-like GEF domains have been shown to have highest affinity for the nucleotide-free state of the GTPases. The SHEP1 GEF domain also exhibited this preference, since wild type R-Ras bound to a much greater extent than the constitutively active, GTP-bound R-Ras38V mutant (Fig. 6 B). Guanine nucleotide exchange factors catalyze the release of GDP from Ras family GTPases, and the GDP is then replaced by GTP, which is abundant in the cytoplasm (24Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). In in vitro exchange assays, the GST fusion protein containing the GEF domain of SHEP1 did not detectably promote the release of 3H-labeled GDP from GST fusions of Ha-Ras and R-Ras (Fig. 6 C). As shown before (32Gotoh T. Niino Y. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18602-18607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), GST-CDC25 efficiently promoted 3H-labeled GDP release from Ha-Ras. GST-CDC25 also promoted a slow release of the labeled nucleotide from R-Ras, showing that the GST-R-Ras fusion protein was competent to bind and release GDP. Exchange assays using RalA and Rap1A yielded results similar to those obtained with R-Ras (not shown). Therefore, the GEF domain of SHEP1 binds R-Ras and Rap1A without promoting GDP/GTP exchange, at least under the conditions of ourin vitro experiments. We report here the isolation of a novel protein, designated SHEP1, that contains an SH2 domain in its N-terminal region, a proline/serine-rich central region, and a C-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain. SHEP1 associates with Eph receptors via its SH2 domain in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Co-expression of activated EphB2 receptor and SHEP1 results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the latter, although it is not known if SHEP1 is a direct or indirect target of EphB2. The C-terminal portion of SHEP1, which contains the GEF domain, preferentially binds to the small Ras family GTPases R-Ras and Rap1A, although no exchange activity was observed. Proteins containing SH2 domains and proteins containing GEF domains are two major classes of proteins that regulate normal cellular signals and can transform cells (34Hunter T. Cell. 1997; 88: 333-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). However, typically SH2 and GEF domains do not occur in the same polypeptide (24Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, 25Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D.

BioEssays. 1995; 17: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The only exception, in addition to SHEP family proteins, are the proto-oncogenes Vav and Vav2, which are related to each other (35Collins T.L. Deckert M. Altman A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 221-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the role of Vav in signaling is likely to be distinct from that of SHEP1. The SH2 domain of Vav, which is located in the carboxyl-terminal part of the protein, is only distantly related to that of SHEP1 (Fig. 2 A). The GEF domain of Vav is a Dbl homology domain rather than a CDC25-like domain. In addition, Vav contains an array of other protein and lipid interaction domains (35Collins T.L. Deckert M. Altman A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 221-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the characterization of Vav as being required in early embryogenesis (36Zmuidzinas A.

Biol. 1998; 8: 1289-1299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) has confirmed the expectation that proteins containing both SH2 and GEF domains should have a crucial importance in development and cell transformation. This is further supported by the recent work of van Agthoven et al. (28van Agthoven T. van Agthoven T.L. Dekker A. van der Spek P.J. Vreede L. Dorssers L.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2799-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), who demonstrate that aberrant expression of the BCAR3/SHEP2 protein in breast cancer cells results in a bypass of estrogen dependence for proliferation, thereby inducing resistance to the anti-estrogen drug tamoxifen. BCAR3/SHEP2 may thus stimulate an alternate growth pathway and/or promote cell survival. The high degree of homology (46% amino acid identity) of BCAR3/SHEP2 with SHEP1 suggests that these two proteins may function in similar pathways involving small Ras GTPases. Although our assays have not shown a GTP exchange activity for the GEF domain of SHEP1, this may be due to a shortcoming in our understanding of the regulation of SHEP1 catalytic activity. It has been demonstrated that many GEF proteins have negatively regulating regions outside the catalytic domain (41Baouz S. Jacquet E. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6671-6676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 42Corbalan-Garcia S. Margarit S.M. Galron D. Yang S.S. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1998; 18: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In particular, both Vav and the Rap1A exchange factor, C3G, are activated by phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues outside the catalytic region (44Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 45Ichiba T. Hashimoto Y. Nakaya M. Kuraishi Y. Tanaka S. Kurata T. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14376-14381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Since SHEP1 contains many potential target tyrosines and is heavily phosphorylated when co-expressed with activated EphB2, such a regulatory mechanism may control the GTP exchange activity of SHEP1 in vivo. It is also possible that R-Ras and Rap1A, although readily bound by SHEP1, are not its physiological targets. Recent studies of GTPase·GEF complexes have highlighted the structural motifs essential for catalytic activity (46Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 47Cherfils J. Menetrey J. Mathieu M. Le Bras G. Robineau S. Beraud-Dufour S. Antonny B. Chardin P. Nature. 1998; 392: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 48Mossessova E. Gulbis J.M. Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 92: 415-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Most GEF proteins contain a stabilizing SCR0/Ras effector motif region that seems to be absent in SHEP1. The co-crystal of SOS/Ras has shown that a protruding helical hairpin formed in part by the SCR3 region (see Fig. 1 A) plays an important role in the nucleotide exchange mechanism (46Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The SHEP1 GEF domain is divergent from other GEF proteins in this region, perhaps indicating that either the mechanism of action of SHEP1 is different or that the target may not be a “classical” Ras protein. Alternatively, the ability of SHEP1 to bind R-Ras and Rap1A without activating them suggests the intriguing possibility that SHEP1 is not a functional GEF but rather a competitive inhibitor of nucleotide exchange. Finally, SHEP1 may serve as an adaptor, controlling the subcellular localization of certain Ras family GTPases. In the absence of an activated Eph receptor, the PXXP motifs of SHEP1 may interact with SH3 domains in other proteins. For example, SHEP1 may localize R-Ras to focal contacts, where this small GTPase may maintain integrin activation (31Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), and at other intracellular locations where R-Ras regulates apoptotic signaling pathways (49Wang H.G. Millan J.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Rapp U.R. Beck T. Zha H. Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Following Eph receptor activation, SHEP1 would become associated with Eph receptors through its SH2 domain. Once associated with Eph receptors, SHEP1 and R-Ras would become tyrosine-phosphorylated. Recent work by Zou et al. 1 has indeed shown that EphB2 can mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of R-Ras, which suppresses integrin-mediated cell adhesion. It is unknown whether Rap1A can also be phosphorylated on tyrosine and if such phosphorylation would have similarly negative regulating effects. During the preparation of this manuscript, the partial sequence of human SHEP1 was published as NSP3 (GenBankTM accession number AF124251). Although no functional data were presented for this protein, a new relative, termed NSP1 (GenBankTM accession number AF124249) (36% amino acid identity with SHEP1), was found to be associated with tyrosine kinase receptors of the epidermal growth factor and insulin receptor families (50Lu Y. Brush J. Stewart T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10047-10052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A connection with integrin-mediated adhesion has also been proposed for NSP1, because of its regulated association with p130cas, a docking protein that has been implicated in integrin signaling (51Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13649-13655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 52Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5762-5768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Overexpression of NSP1 in 293 cells also induced the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 and consequently increased the activity of an AP-1-containing promoter. These data are further indication that SHEP1 and the other members of this novel protein family may be important signal transduction intermediates downstream of Eph receptors and other receptor tyrosine kinases in processes such as cell adhesion, cell survival, and embryonic development.

Distinct CKI isoforms may be regulated by differences in subcellular localization, substrate specificity, and modes of regulation. For example, the YCK1 and YCK2 isoforms are membrane-bound in yeast because of carboxyl-terminal prenylation, whereas HRR25 is predominantly nuclear (8Wang X. Hoekstra M.F. DeMaggio A.J. Dhillon N.

CKIε and the related kinase CKIδ phosphorylate N-terminal residues of p53 in vitro and in vivo (16Milne D.M. Palmer R.H. Campbell D.G. Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1361-1369PubMed Google Scholar, 17Knippschild U. Milne D.M. Campbell L.E. DeMaggio A.J. Christenson E. Hoekstra M.F. Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); this activity is enhanced by DNA damaging drugs. CKIα binding to NF-AT4 may be regulated by MEKK1 (7Zhu J. Shibasaki F. Price R. Guillemot J.C. Yano T. Dotsch V. Wagner G. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Cell. 1998; 93: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), whereas a CKIα homolog in Drosophila has been reported to change subcellular localization and activity in response to irradiation (18Santos J.A. Logarinho E. Tapia C. Allende C.C. Allende J.E. Sunkel C.E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1847-1856PubMed Google Scholar). One way the activity, localization, and specificity of CKI isoforms may be regulated is through their diverse carboxyl-terminal domains. CKI family members have a similar primary sequence arrangement consisting of a highly conserved amino-terminal catalytic domain of approximately 283 amino acids and carboxyl-terminal extensions of variable length and sequence. Interestingly, although the kinase domains are highly conserved between species (e.g. human CKIε and yeast HRR25 kinase domains are 64% identical and 81% similar), the carboxyl termini in general have no discernible sequence homology. One exception to this is in mammals, where the 124-amino acid tail of CKIε is 50% identical to the tail of CKIδ. Several lines of evidence suggest the activities of CKIδ and CKIε are regulated by a carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation-dependent autoinhibitory domain (19Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Graves P.R. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21689-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation both inactivates the kinase and leads to the accumulation of up to 8 mol of phosphate/mol of kinase. Removal of the CKIδ or CKIε carboxyl-terminal domain by mutagenesis or proteolysis reactivates the kinases. Furthermore, Graves and Roach (20Graves P.R. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21689-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) showed that transfer of the CKIδ tail to CKIα conferred autoinhibition on that chimeric kinase as well. Interestingly, in vivo, these kinases also autophosphorylate, but this autophosphorylation is rapidly reversed by endogenous protein phosphatases in a futile autophosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle (13Rivers A. Gietzen K.F. Vielhaber E. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15980-15984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The specific function of this futile cycle is not known, but it is potentially a mechanism to regulate either kinase activity or the ability of specific substrates to bind to the kinase. To further study the function of CKIε in vitro andin vivo, we mapped the regulatory autophosphorylation sites on the CKIε carboxyl terminus. Progressive truncation of CKIε eliminated both its autophosphorylation sites and the ability to activate the kinase by dephosphorylating it with protein phosphatase 2A. Potential phosphorylation sites were then identified by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. Mutation of specific residues to alanine produced a recombinant enzyme with 8-fold higher specific activity. Interestingly, none of the identified CKI autophosphorylation sites conform to the consensus sites determined by studies of synthetic peptides.

The immunoprecipitates were eluted from the protein A-agarose and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 9% gel. Results were visualized by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Radiolabeled kinases were isolated in gel slices and subjected to trypsin digestion as described below. As a control, a corresponding region of the gel from the empty vector lanes was excised and processed identically to those for the HA-tagged kinases. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps were generated as described below. The construct used for site-directed mutagenesis was a derivative of pV71 (19Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) that contains the CKIε open reading frame downstream of a hexahistidine tag and an enterokinase cleavage site in the vector pRSET-B (Invitrogen). The modified construct, pKF158, contains a tetracycline resistance gene (tet r) and a point mutant ampicillin resistance gene (amp m). The tetracycline resistance cassette was PCR-amplified from pAlter-1 (Promega) using the primers TET1 (5′-AACATGTCCGGATTCTCATGTTTGACAGCTTATCA) and TET2 (5′-GTGCAGTCCGGAGACTTCCGCGTTTCCAGACTT), each containing engineeredBspEI sites. The PCR product was digested withBspEI and inserted at the same site of pV71 in an orientation such that the direction of transcription was away from the polylinker. The tet r amp rconstruct, pKF152, was then modified by replacing a 1-kilobase pair fragment bordered by AlwNI and ScaI with a similar fragment from pAlter-1 (Promega) containing a nonfunctional ampicillin resistance gene. The pKF158 plasmid was used for both site-directed mutagenesis and overexpression in Escherichia coli. Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted essentially by the Altered Sites method (Promega). Individual primary amp r transformants of E. coli strain 71–18 mutS were screened for either the presence or absence of the restriction site introduced or eliminated with each mutation (see Table I).Table IPrimers used for site-directed mutagenesisMutation namePrimer sequenceaItalics identify sites of mutagenesis.

Clarified lysates in 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmimidazole, 10% glycerol, with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm benzamidine were applied to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate-agarose (Qiagen). Bound protein was eluted from the column with lysis buffer containing 80 mmimidazole. CKIε tagged with the amino-terminal six-histidine tag of pRSET-B (Invitrogen) was used in all assays except where specifically indicated. Untagged CKIε in pET16b (pKF115) was expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli and partially purified on S-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (19Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged and untagged kinase were previously found to behave similarly in protein phosphorylation experiments (19Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of total protein from partially purified CKIε preparations were run on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to supported nitrocellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (19Cegielska A.

The membrane was blocked by incubation in TTBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 3% bovine serum albumin and then probed with affinity-purified polyclonal antibody UT31, added at a 1:1000 dilution in blocking solution as the primary antibody (23Fish K.J.

The proteins of interest that reacted with UT31 were visualized with a secondary detection step of 125I-labeled protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) added at 10 nCi ml−1 of blocking solution. A standard curve of serial dilutions of a single protein preparation was used to determine the relative concentration of all CKIε preparations tested. The results were visualized and quantitated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Kinase reactions were performed in buffer containing 100 or 250 μm ATP, 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, and then the reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described previously (1Cegielska A. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1202-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Cegielska A. Moarefi I. Fanning E. Virshup D.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 269-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All assays were performed at least twice with good interassay reproducibility. All phosphatase reactions were performed for 15 min at 37 °C in 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 7 mm MgCl2, and 200 μg of ml−1 bovine serum albumin and contained 8–12 ng of the catalytic subunit of PP2A unless otherwise noted. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Partially purified CKIε proteins were radiolabeledin vitro or, for Fig. 1, immunoprecipitated from32P-labeled cells. Approximately 20–50 μg of each kinase were treated with 1 μg of PP2Ac for 15 min at 37 °C. Phosphatase activity was blocked by the addition of 200 nmokadaic acid, and the kinase was allowed to re-autophosphorylate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 37 °C. The kinase reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel. Protein was stained briefly with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the gels were dried, and the labeled proteins was visualized by autoradiography. Radiolabeled protein bands were excised and rehydrated in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate digestion buffer. The gel slices were minced, 10 μg of trypsin was added, and digestion was carried out for 20 h at 37 °C. The buffer was removed from the gel slices and Cerenkov-counted to determine recovery of tryptic phosphopeptides. The digest was then lyophilized to dryness. The two-dimensional peptide mapping method of Van Der Geer et al. (26Van Der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press Inc., New York1995: 31-59Google Scholar) was used to separate phosphopeptides of CKIε. Plastic-backed 100-μm cellulose plates were obtained from Sigma. Lyophilized tryptic peptides of CKIε were suspended in 5–10 μl of pH 1.9 electrophoresis buffer and spotted onto a cellulose plate. For maps performed in parallel, equal counts were spotted on each plate. Electrophoresis was carried out at 1300 V for 30 min in pH 1.9 buffer containing 2.2% formic acid, and 7.8% acetic acid. Following electrophoresis, the cellulose plates were allowed to dry completely. Dried plates were subjected to ascending chromatography for 3 h in phosphochromatography buffer containing 37.5% n-butanol, 25% pyridine, and 7.5% acetic acid. Phosphopeptides were visualized by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). CKIε activity is regulatedin vitro by carboxyl-terminal tail autophosphorylation;in vivo the autophosphorylated kinase is rapidly dephosphorylated in a futile cycle of autophosphorylation and dephosphorylation (13Rivers A. Gietzen K.F. Vielhaber E. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15980-15984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To determine whether CKIε was autophosphorylated in vitro and in vivo on the same sites, two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps were prepared from CKIε autophosphorylated in vivo (Fig.1, A and B, panels a–f) and in vitro (Fig.1 B, panel g). In vivoautophosphorylated CKIε was immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells metabolically labeled with H332PO4. The rapid turnover of phosphate on CKIε in vivo autophosphorylation sites (13Rivers A. Gietzen K.F. Vielhaber E. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15980-15984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was blocked by addition of the cell-permeable phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A to selected cells for the last 30 min of labeling. As Fig.1 A, lanes c and f, shows, immunoprecipitated kinase-inactive CKIε (K38R) appears minimally phosphorylated in vivo. Phosphopeptide mapping demonstrates that the kinase-inactive CKIε is phosphorylated predominantly on a single peptide (spot f in Fig. 1 B) and that phosphorylation is not altered substantially by the addition of the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (Fig. 1 B, panels c and f). In vivo, wild-type CKIε is minimally phosphorylated, and on the same peptide f in the absence of calyculin A, with low levels of autophosphorylation on additional peptides i and h (compare Fig.1 B, panels b and c). The addition of calyculin A to transfected cells inhibits a number of endogenous serine/threonine phosphatases and leads to a marked increase in autophosphorylation of CKIε on additional sites (Fig. 1 A, lanes b and e, and peptides d, e, g, and m in Fig.1 B, panel e). The phosphorylation of CKIεin vivo in the presence of calyculin A is primarily autophosphorylation, because the phosphorylation of kinase-inactive CKIε is not increased significantly by the phosphatase inhibitor (compare lanes c and f, Fig. 1 A). Previous studies have established that the autophosphorylation of CKIε in vitro and in vivo is intramolecular (13Rivers A. Gietzen K.F. Vielhaber E. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15980-15984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). CKIε appears to autophosphorylate on the same peptides in vitro as it does in vivo, as the phosphopeptide maps of the kinase labeled either way are very similar (compare panels e and g, Fig. 1 B). In addition, peptide maps prepared from bacterially expressed protein (Fig. 1 B, panel g) demonstrate two additional phosphopeptides, labeled j and k. In vitro labeled protein may contain these extra phosphopeptides because of more extensive autophosphorylationin vitro, or the sites may be phosphorylated in vivo but not detected because they are rapidly dephosphorylated by a cellular phosphatase that is not inhibited by calyculin A. Phosphopeptides a, b, and c appear to be nonspecific, as they appear in the absence of kinase as well (compare Fig. 1 B, panel d withpanels e and f). Because the CKIε in vivo and in vitro autophosphorylation sites appear to be similar, bacterially expressed in vitroautophosphorylated protein was used for phosphopeptide mapping experiments. Autophosphorylated CKIε can be activated up to 20-fold by treatment with active PP2Ac. Previous truncation and domain-swap experiments have indicated that autophosphorylation sites in the carboxyl-terminal tail of CKIε and CKIδ are responsible for this autophosphorylation-dependent autoinhibition (13Rivers A.

To determine the specific regions of CKIε required for phosphorylation-dependent autoinhibition, a series of histidine-tagged carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants of CKIε were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig.2 and TableII). These truncated active kinases were expressed in E. coli and partially purified by metal-chelate chromatography, and CKIε protein levels were normalized by quantitative immunoblot (Fig.3 A). The kinases as purified from E. coli were substantially autophosphorylated and hence autoinhibited (19Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol.

The prominent γδ T cell subset in human blood expresses the Vγ9/Vδ2 TCR and responds to nonpeptide antigens produced by various microbial pathogens, such as mycobacteria. The mycobacterial stimuli for these T cells have been characterized independently by two groups as nonpeptide phosphoesters, collectively referred to as phosphoantigens. On the one hand, isoprenoid-PP such as isopentenyl-PP, dimethylallyl-PP, farnesyl-PP, and geranyl-PP have been characterized as Vγ9/Vδ2 T cell-stimulating ligands in bioactive fractions from mycobacteria (1Tanaka Y.

On the other hand, we have purified from several mycobacterial species a set of four phosphoantigens composed of two pyrophosphates of an unidentified monoester (X, in the so-called TUBag1 and TUBag2) and of the corresponding X-phosphodiesters of γ-UTP (5Poquet Y.

These TUBag compounds have been shown to be active at the nm range (i.e. with bioactivities about 1000-fold higher than that of IPP), thus suggesting that these molecules could account for most of the γδ T cell-stimulating activity recovered from mycobacteria. Poor yields and intrinsic lability of purified TUBag1–4 have considerably slowed the identification of X. However, several biochemical lines of evidence indicated that this mycobacterial X moiety was distinct from prenyl phosphates (5Poquet Y. Constant P. Halary F. Peyrat M.A. Gilleron M. Davodeau F.

Accordingly, a molecular analysis of phosphoantigen recognition has evidenced a pattern of TCR γδ cell reactivity that distinguishes alkyl-PP from mycobacterial phosphoantigens (8Bukowski J.F. Morita C.T. Bloom B.R. Brenner M.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 286-293PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the fine specificity of γδ T cell reactivity to mycobacteria, we have identified the hitherto referred-to X moiety as 3-formyl-1-butyl-PP. The activation of γδ T cells by this non-prenyl phosphoantigen resembling and most likely related to isopentenyl-PP is due to the efficient perception of its aldehyde and PP segments. Hence, the stringent property of human γδ T cells to recognize very rapidly and without major histocompatibility complex restriction low concentrations of phosphoantigens sheds light on their immune role in microbial surveillance.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStructural Analysis of PhosphoantigensTUBag1 and TUBag3 were purified from 20 liters of Mycobacterium fortuitumculture medium using HPLC and HPAEC as described (5Poquet Y.

Ion Trap electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LCQ, Finnigan Thermoquest, Les Ulis, France) was done in negative mode with scanning over a mass range of 100–2000 mass units, and TUBag samples were diluted 1 μg/μl in isopropanol/water (v/v) to which 1% triethylamine had been added and were introduced by continuous infusion at 3 μl/min. MSn was done on the specified main ions with a window of 5 mass units using He collisions with 25% total beam energy. Structural combinations were calculated with Molgen (Molgen Softwares, Bayreuth, Germany). HPAEC and HPLC were coupled to a photodiode array detector (Millenium, Waters) scanning at 1 spectrum/s between λ 200 and 800 nm with a 0.5 nm window. Chemical synthesis of pyrophosphate esters and of UTP-γ-esters was achieved by nucleophilic displacement of tosylated alcohols with pyrophosphate or reaction of the corresponding alcohols with carbodiimide-activated UTP as described (9Belmant C.

The structures of the compounds were checked by MSn, 1H NMR and HPAEC. Chemical treatments of isopentenyl-PP, 2-butanone-1-yl-PP, and 3-formyl-1-butyl-PP (TUBag1) were done as follows. Samples were added to 5 mm NaIO4 (Aldrich) (total volume of 100 μl (pH 7)) for 35 min at room temperature and 25 min at 4 °C, and further neutralization of excess NaIO4 before cell assays was done by the addition of a few drops of glycerol to the sample. Reduction was performed by adding 100 μl of 10 mmNaBH4 (Aldrich) containing 4 mmNH4OH for 40 min at room temperature, followed by neutralization with 5 μl of methanol. Similar conditions were applied with NaBH3CN (10 mm) in phosphate buffer, pH 7.3. KMnO4 was used at 1 mm, pH 7 for 30 min at 4 °C and neutralized by 3 μl of aqueous isopentenol; MnO2 precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation (5 min at 10 °C), and the supernatant was assayed. Aqueous bromine treatment was done according to Belmant et al. (10Belmant C. Bonneville M. Fournié J.J. Peyrat M.A. Nouveaux Composés Phosphoépoxydes, Procédé de Fabrication et Applications. INSERM Patent, Ed. INPI, Paris, France1998Google Scholar) with modification using a 1:10 dilution of a 1.5 mm Br2 aqueous stock solution (15 min at 4 °C, pH 6).Bioassays of Human γδ T Cell ActivationBioactivities of the specified molecules were drawn from the titration of the autocytotoxic response of a Vγ9/Vδ2 T cell clone stimulated by serial dilutions of the phosphoantigens (12Halary F. Peyrat M.A. Champagne E. Lopez-Botet M. Moretta A. Moretta L. Vié H. Fournié J.J. Bonneville M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2812-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The ability of the molecules to trigger selective expansion of Vγ9/Vδ2 peripheral blood lymphocytes in short term culture assays was assessed as described previously (12Halary F. Peyrat M.A. Champagne E. Lopez-Botet M. Moretta A. Moretta L. Vié H. Fournié J.J. Bonneville M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2812-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors were cultured for 8 days with the specified molecules in culture medium supplemented with recombinant human interleukin 2, and the frequency of CD3+ Vδ2+ cells (monoclonal antibodies from Coulter-Immunotech, Marseille, France) was estimated by flow cytometry using a FACScan apparatus (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Polyclonal Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells stimulated by untreated or NaBH4-treated phosphoantigens were analyzed using a microphysiometer (Cytosensor, Molecular Devices, Crawley, UK), with 8 × 105 cells/experiment, a flow (100 μl/min) of low-buffered RPMI (Molecular Devices, Crawley, UK) alone (Fig. 4, control lanes) or containing the specified stimulus (added at a time shown by arrow), and data collection rate of 90 s.RESULTSMolecular Masses of TUBag1 and -3Thirty μg of pure TUBag3 (UTPγ-X) molecule obtained as described (5Poquet Y.

Immunol. 1996; 26: 2344-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were analyzed by Ion Trap electrospray ionization-MS in negative mode (Fig.1 A). The spectrum showed abundant ions at m/z 567 andm/z 589, corresponding to (M-H)− and (M+Na-2H)−, respectively. This result unambiguously indicates a molecular mass of 568 atomic mass units for TUBag3, i.e. 84 atomic mass units above that of UTP. Subsequent negative MS2 from m/z 567 (Fig.1 B) yielded the fragments (UTP-H)−, (UDP-H)−, and (UMP-H)−, demonstrating the UTPγ-X structure formerly assigned to TUBag3 (5Poquet Y. Constant P. Halary F.

Most importantly, this negative MS2 spectrum showed fragments atm/z 261 and m/z 243, corresponding to the (XPP-H)− fragment and its anhydro derivative (XPP-H2O-H)−. Thus, X-OH has a molecular mass of 102, and the PP monoester which corresponds to TUBag1 (6Constant P. Davodeau F. Peyrat M.A. Poquet Y. Puzo G. Bonneville M. Fournié J.J. Science. 1994; 264: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), has a molecular mass of 262 atomic mass units, confirming a recent observation (13De Libero G. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 22-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This conclusion was supported by negative MS3 from m/z 261, which yielded an anhydro fragment (m/z 243) and two diagnostic fragments corresponding to a ketene (CH2=CO) loss (m/z 219) and a PPi fragment (m/z 159, Fig. 1 C). Moreover, these data indicate the presence of a carbonyl group in XPP and establish the structure of the PP monoester. This negative MS3 spectrum from TUBag3 was identical to the negative MS2 spectrum from ions at m/z 261 observed in the negative MS1 spectrum from TUBag1, obtained in similar conditions as in Fig. 1 A (data not shown). No anion was generated from X-OH in these experiments, so this molecule presumably contains few oxygen atoms and no carboxylic group. Furthermore, its even mass indicates either an absence of the N atom or the presence of an even number of N atoms. With a general formula C1–7, Hn, O1–4, N2-or-4, 21,533 isomeric structures correspond to a molecular mass of 102 atomic mass units, among which only 1065 are noncarboxylic with at least one primary alcohol as the phosphorylation site.Figure 1Ion Trap electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of mycobacterial phosphoantigens.

Only carbonyl-containing phosphoesters did so (Fig.2) and presented phosphoantigenic bioactivity for γδ T cell clones, although in the micromolar range, as already found with prenyl-PP (1Tanaka Y. Morita C.T. Tanaka Y. Nieves E. Brenner M.B. Bloom B.R. Nature. 1995; 375: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Since similar results were obtained with the UTP-γ-ester analogues when compared with the mycobacterial X-UTP (TUBag3); these data suggest the presence of a carbonyl group in X. This assumption was confirmed by spectroscopy. First, a Fourier transform infrared spectrum of TUBag1 (5 μg) in water presented a C=O stretching band at 1670 cm−1(versus 1700 cm−1 for a synthetic ketone-PP reference; not shown). Second, based on the weak ε of C=O at λ 260–300 nm in UV (εmax < 30m−1.cm−1), a photodiode array comparison of HPLC-purified TUBag1 to relevant standards (Fig.3) evidenced a weak absorption at λmax between 265 and 268.6 nm. Similar data were obtained with synthetic hydroxyketones standards, whereas conversely, PP, IPP, or pentanol do not absorb in this range. Thus, in agreement with the ketene loss from X-PP observed in the negative MS3fragmentation (Fig. 1 C), X contains a noncarboxylic C=O group whose local charge (−0.3) accounts for its peculiar HPAEC Rt.Figure 2Comparative HPAEC analysis of various alkyl-PP to TUBag1 and TUBag3.

However, synthetic keto-pyrophosphoesters or UTP-γ-esters such as 2-butanone-1-yl-PP, 3-pentanone-1-yl-PP, 4-pentanone-1-yl-PP, or 2-methyl-3-butanone-1yl-(or 2-yl-)-γ-UTP had much weaker (5–80 μm) phosphoantigenic bioactivities. Therefore, we compared the functional group of mycobacterial X-PP to that of a synthetic keto-pyrophosphoester reference by titrating their bioactivities after selective chemical treatments (TableI). The bioactivities of untreated TUBag1 (5 nm), 2-butanone-1-yl-PP (30 μm), and isopentenyl-PP (3 μm) were unaffected by treatment with 5 mm NaIO4, pH 7. On the contrary, TUBag1 (or whole mycobacterial extract), but not IPP (nor any prenyl phosphate), was totally inactivated by reduction with 10 mmNaBH4, as expected for carbonyls (see 2-butanone-1-yl-PP in Table I). Furthermore, bioactivity of TUBag1 (or that of whole mycobacterial extract) was also totally abrogated by oxidation with 1 mm KMnO4, a treatment that did not affect bioactivity of IPP, prenyl phosphates, or 2-butanone-1-yl-PP (Table I). These data clearly demonstrate that mycobacterial phosphoantigens are different from prenyl phosphates. IPP oxidation by KMnO4produced the diol-PP, CH2OH-C(CH3)OH-CH2-CH2-O-PP, with a molecular mass of 280 atomic mass units, an HPAEC Rt identical to that of TUBag1, and a phosphoantigenic bioactivity similar to that of IPP (3–5 μm in autocytotoxic response of a Vγ9/Vδ2 T cell clone, not shown). The bioactivity of KMnO4-oxidized IPP is due to the C3-C4 diol moiety, as this latter was chemically converted by 5 mm NaIO4 into 3-butanone-1-yl-PP (same HPAEC Rt as TUBag1, bioactivity 50–80 μm), an unstable compound prone to β elimination into 1-buten-3-one (HPAEC Rt = 0 min, biologically inactive) and PPi. The low bioactivity of C3-C4 diol suggests that dihydroxylated phosphoantigens are unlikely to be the natural antigens. Thus, TUBag1 contains a primary alcohol (phosphorylation site) and a carbonyl (reduced by NaBH4 and oxidized by KMnO4). TUBag1 does not contain any imine group (C=N), as it was resisted to treatment with 10 mmNaBH3CN at neutral pH (14Borch R.F. Bernstein M.D. Dupont-Durst H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 2897-2904Crossref Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). To check for the presence of HC=O or of enol, TUBag1 and IPP were treated by cold bromine water (0.5 mm, pH 6), which adds double bonds or readily oxidizes aldehydes with α-H. Br2-treated IPP remained bioactive, indicating that this treatment did not degrade the phosphate bonds and that unsaturation was not mandatory for bioactivity. Conversely, the bioactivity of Br2-treated TUBag1 was completely abolished (Table I), implying the presence of an aldehyde that was either oxidized by aqueous Br2 and KMnO4 or reduced by NaBH4 into distinct inactive molecules. In agreement with the above spectroscopic data and MS fragmentation pattern of TUBag1, this conclusion was further supported by a weak positive Schiff staining of concentrated HPLC fractions of TUBag1. Previous data from NMR analysis of TUBag3 (5Poquet Y. Constant P. Halary F. Peyrat M.A. Gilleron M. Davodeau F. Bonneville M. Fournié J.J. Eur. J.

Science. 1994; 264: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) completed this identification. In both 1H spectra from TUBag4 or TUBag3, two primary alcohol protons (-CH2-O-P-) were detected at 4.10 ppm (m) and 4.20 ppm (m), respectively. These protons coupled together (J = 15 Hz) and to two adjacent methylenic (-CH2-CH2-O-P-) protons at 3.47 ppm and 3.57 ppm in TUBag3 and at 3.49 ppm and 3.58 ppm in TUBag4, indicating the presence of a dimethylene group in both antigens. In addition, a well defined 1H-1H coupling was observed in TUBag4 between the protons at 1.26 ppm (3H, J = 7.6 Hz, Me) and 4.10 ppm (1H), which implies a H3C-CH- group, which was confirmed by 1H-13C homonuclear multiple quantum and homonuclear multiple bond correlation spectroscopy experiments (CMe: 22 ppm; CH: 65 or 75 ppm (15Constant P.

Consequently, based on former structural evidence (5Poquet Y. Constant P. Halary F. Peyrat M.A. Gilleron M. Davodeau F. Bonneville M. Fournié J.J. Eur. J.

No fully convincing MS of TUBag2 could be obtained. Nevertheless, its slightly higher Rt on C18 HPLC (6Constant P. Davodeau F. Peyrat M.A. Poquet Y. Puzo G. Bonneville M. Fournié J.J.

Morita C.T. Bloom B.R. Brenner M.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 286-293PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that TUBag2 corresponds to a closely related longer chain homolog of TUBag1 such as 3-formyl-1-pentyl-PP.Structural Determinants of 3-Formyl-1-butyl-PP, Which Affect γδ T Cell ReactivityReactivity of human γδ T cells to phosphoantigens is not strictly selective, because various phosphoesters comprising a linear C2 core as ethyl-PP are stimulatory, although at nearly 103 times higher concentrations (EC50% = 10–30 μm). Since isoamyl-PP (the saturated analogue of IPP) does not activate γδ T cells, the relatively higher bioactivity of isopentenyl-PP (EC50% = 1–3 μm) has been attributed to its prenylic unsaturation (1Tanaka Y. Morita C.T. Tanaka Y. Nieves E. Brenner M.B. Bloom B.R. Nature. 1995; 375: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). This olefin is better recognized than its related C3-C4 diol-PP (see KMnO4-treated IPP in Table I, EC50% = 10 μm) and than the subsequent C3-carbonyl derivative (NaIO4 oxidized C3-C4diol-PP: EC50% = 50–80 μm, data not shown). Similarly, the potent activity of 3-formyl-1-butyl-PP on human γδ T cells (5–10 nm range (5Poquet Y. Constant P. Halary F. Peyrat M.A. Gilleron M. Davodeau F. Bonneville M. Fournié J.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2344-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)) is clearly conferred by its aldehyde group. Although NaBH4 reduction of 3-formyl-1-butyl-PP changed slightly, its topology (increasing the antigen volume from 179 Å3 to 183 Å3 and lowering the local dipolarity at C4 from 2.2 to 1.4 Debye), this subtle structural alteration totally abrogated the bioactivity of this compound (Table I and Fig. 4). Activation of human γδ T cells by mycobacterial ligands such as the purified 3-formyl-1-butyl-PP induced a powerful in vitroexpansion of Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells from peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy donors, whereas the topologically resembling NaBH4-reduced 3-formyl-1-butyl PP did not (Fig. 4, upper panel). T cell proliferation is, however, a late event, usually detected after several days of in vitrocultures stimulated from the beginning of the assay. Hence, the γδ cell unresponsiveness to NaBH4-reduced 3-formyl-1-butyl-PP could possibly reflect the capacity of this compound to inhibit late steps of cell proliferation without actually interfering with its initial recognition by T cells. We assayed whether early steps of γδ T cell activation by TUBag1 were also crucially determined by its aldehyde function.The early responses of polyclonal γδ T cell lines to 3-formyl-1-butyl-PP and to its NaBH4-reduced derivative were compared using a microphysiometer monitoring the acidification rate of culture media (16Nag B.

We recorded a rapid cell response to mycobacterial 3-formyl-1-butyl-PP and found that its aldehyde-to-alcohol reduction abrogated its bioactivity (Fig. 4, lower panel). These experiments confirmed that the γδ T lymphocyte unresponsiveness to reduced antigen is due to abrogation of early events leading to cell activation such as antigen recognition.DISCUSSIONHuman Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells predominate in adult blood but not in thymus (20Parker C.M.

Casorati G. Migone N. Lanzavecchia A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 173: 235-238PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the broad reactivity of Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells to various microbial, viral, and protozoan pathogens arises from their unique ability to specifically recognize a peculiar set of natural nonpeptide-phosphorylated ligands called phosphoantigens (2Tanaka Y.

Because of rapidly expanding use of Bt toxins in pest control, knowledge of the mode of action of Bt toxins is becoming increasingly important for proper deployment of this valuable biopesticide and avoidance of insect resistance (2Tabashnik B.E.

In particular, millions of hectares of transgenic crops that produce Bt toxins from the Cry1 family are being grown in the United States and elsewhere to control lepidopteran pests (3James C. Global Status of Transgenic Crops in 1997.Briefs No. 5. ISAAA, Ithaca, NY1997Google Scholar). After lepidopteran larvae ingest Cry1 proteins, protoxins are solubilized in the alkaline midgut and activated by proteases. The activated toxins bind to specific target sites in the midgut epithelium, creating pores that disrupt the ionic balance of the cell and kill the insect (4Knowles B.H. Adv.

Domain I is composed of a central helix (α5) encased by six other helices (6Grochulski P. Masson L. Borisova S. Pusztai-Carey M. Schwartz J.L. Brousseau R. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 447-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The helical nature of domain I and the ability of Cry proteins to form ion channels (6Grochulski P. Masson L. Borisova S.

Commun. 1990; 169: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) places them in the general class of globular bacterial toxins, like diphtheria toxin and colicin A. After binding, diphtheria toxin and colicin A undergo conformational changes enabling one or more helices to insert into the target cell membrane and form ion channels (11Parker M.W. Pattus F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 391-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A general working hypothesis is that similar post-binding events are essential for toxicity of Cry proteins. Analogies to other toxins such as colicin A spawned two theoretical models for Bt toxin integration into insect cell membranes, a penknife model and an umbrella model (4Knowles B.H. Adv. Insect Physiol. 1994; 24: 275-308Crossref Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 12Parker M.W. Tucker A.D. Tsernoglou D. Pattus F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 126-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence now supports the umbrella model in which an α4-α5 hairpin insertion is followed by spreading of the remaining domain I bundled helices over the membrane. (5Li J.D. Carroll J. Ellar D.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 13Schwartz J.L. Juteau M. Grochulski P. Cygler M. Prefontaine G. Brousseau R. Masson L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This model involves α4-α5 hairpin insertion followed by the subsequent spreading of the remaining domain I bundled helices over the membrane surface (5Li J.D. Carroll J. Ellar D.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Substitution of a glutamine residue in the middle of α4 with a helix-breaking proline destroyed toxicity of Cry4A to Aedes aegypti larvae (1Uawithya P. Tuntitippawan T. Katzenmeier G. Panyim S. Angsuthanasombat C. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 44: 825-832PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in α5 generally decreased toxicity, whereas mutations in α3 and α6 showed little or no effect (1Uawithya P. Tuntitippawan T. Katzenmeier G. Panyim S. Angsuthanasombat C. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 44: 825-832PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wu D. Aronson A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2311-2317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Aronson A.I. Wu D. Zhang C. J.

A. 1998; 95: 12289-12294Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) showed that α5 can span artificial membranes. Cross-linking of domain I helices by disulfide-bridge engineering showed that decreased flexibility of either α4 or α5 blocked their ability to create ion channels in PLBs (13Schwartz J.L. Juteau M.

Brousseau R. Masson L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) proposed a refinement of the umbrella model, in which domain I swings away from domains II and III, followed by α4 and α5 integration into the membrane forming a tetrameric ion channel with a diameter of approximately 6 Å. Although various studies (13Schwartz J.L. Juteau M. Grochulski P. Cygler M. Prefontaine G. Brousseau R. Masson L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Gazit E.

Structure-Function Analysis of Cysteine-Engineered Entomopathogenic Toxins. Humana Press, 1999Google Scholar) suggest that conformational changes involving α4 or α5 of domain I are crucial for membrane integration and ion channel formation, direct evidence of which helices are involved in forming ion channels has not been reported previously. Because charged rings of amino acids are found in gated ion channels for Na+, K+, Ca2+, and cyclic nucleotides (20Montal M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that charged amino acids in α4 play a critical role in ion channel formation and Cry1Aa toxicity. To test this hypothesis, we created and analyzed eight Cry1Aa mutants in which four charged and one polar amino acid in α4 were altered. Using diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) as a target, we tested wild-type Cry1Aa and the mutant proteins for toxicity, binding to brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs), and ion channel formation in PLBs. We also used the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) (21Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) with a charged thiol-specific reagent (22Kenyon G.L. Bruice T.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 407-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) to localize cysteine-engineered amino acids relative to the channel lumen in situ. The results provide direct evidence of the role of α4 in ion channel formation and toxicity. Helix 4 of Cry1Aa is composed of 26 amino acids of which five are charged (see Fig. 1 A). We created nine Cry1Aa mutants at six different amino acid positions (Fig. 1 B) by oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis using the double oligonucleotide method (23Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) (CLONTECH TransformerTMkit, CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) in the expression plasmid pMP39 (24Masson L. Prefontaine G. Peloquin L. Lau P.C.K. Brousseau R. Biochem. J. 1989; 269: 507-512Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). One mutant protein, E128K, was not expressed in sufficient quantities in either Escherichia coli or in B. thuringiensis for bioassays and thus was not included in subsequent analyses. All protoxins were produced as insoluble inclusions inEscherichia coli and purified as described elsewhere (24Masson L. Prefontaine G. Peloquin L. Lau P.C.K. Brousseau R. Biochem. J. 1989; 269: 507-512Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Trypsin activation was performed by incubating 15 mg of protoxin solubilized in 40 mm carbonate buffer, pH 10.5, with 1% (w/v) trypsin for 3 h at room temperature. Activated toxin was centrifuged for 1 h at 200,000 × g to remove lipids. Toxins were purified by fast protein liquid chromatography ion-exchange chromatography using a Mono-Q column and eluting bound toxin with a 50–500 mm NaCl gradient in carbonate buffer, pH 10.5 (24Masson L. Prefontaine G. Peloquin L. Lau P.C.K. Brousseau R. Biochem. J. 1989; 269: 507-512Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Activated toxins were dialyzed against distilled water until precipitated. The precipitate was collected and stored in water at 4 °C. The similar biochemical properties of protoxin alkali solubility and production of a protease resistant 68-kDa toxin was taken as evidence that all mutant protein conformations resembled that of wild-type Cry1Aa toxin. Diamondback moth larvae were reared on cabbage and bioassayed using previously described methods (25Tabashnik B.E. Malvar T. Liu Y.B. Finson N. Borthakur D. Shin B.S. Park S.H. Masson L. de Maagd R.A. Bosch D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 2839-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cry1Aa and eight mutant proteins were tested against third instar larvae of the susceptible LAB-PS strain (26Liu Y.B. Tabashnik B.E. J. Econ. Entomol. 1998; 91: 1032-1037Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The protoxin form of each of the aforementioned proteins as well as the purified, trypsin-activated toxin form of E129K and D136C were tested. Groups of 9 to 11 (usually 10) larvae were allowed to eat cabbage leaf disks dipped in distilled water dilutions of each protein (25Tabashnik B.E. Malvar T. Liu Y.B. Finson N. Borthakur D. Shin B.S. Park S.H. Masson L. de Maagd R.A. Bosch D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 2839-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At least three independent groups of larvae were tested against each protein (minimum sample size = 30). Mortality was recorded after five days and adjusted for mortality of larvae that ate control disks dipped in distilled water only. In all treatments, including distilled water controls, we added a surfactant (0.2% Triton AG98 from Rohm & Haas). To determine whether loss of toxicity of some α4 mutants was caused by altered binding, we tested binding to BBMVs of Cry1Aa (positive control), four non-toxic mutant proteins, and Cry1E (a non-toxic negative control). Fourth instar P. xylostella larvae were frozen at −70 °C. Whole guts were removed from thawed larvae, placed in ice-cold buffer (300 mm mannitol, 5 mm EGTA, and 17 mmTris-base, pH 7.5), and immediately frozen on dry ice. BBMVs were purified from approximately 1000 frozen guts by homogenization and selective magnesium precipitation (27Wolfersberger M. Luethy P. Maurer A. Parenti P. Sacchi F.V. Giordana B. Hanozet G.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 86A: 301-308Crossref Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Final membrane pellets were resuspended by sonication in detergent-free HBS (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) to a 1 mg/ml total protein concentration and stored at −80 °C. All protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumen as a standard. Binding was analyzed with surface plasmon resonance using an optical biosensor (BIAcore 1000, Pharmacia Biosensor). Toxins were immobilized to activated carboxymethylated dextran on CM5 sensor chips by standard amine coupling (29Mazza A. Brousseau R. Tabashnik B. Masson L. Lundahl P. Lundqvist E.G.A. Quantitative analysis of Biospecific Interactions. Harwood Academic Publishers, GMBH, Chur, Switzerland1999: 163-174Google Scholar). Toxins were dissolved as a 0.1 mg/ml stock solution in 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5. With one exception, we used 2300 to 2800 resonance unit (RU) surfaces of immobilized toxins. We used roughly double the amount of D136C to determine whether this increase would alter binding. Because Bt toxin binding is a biphasic event involving receptor binding and membrane integration, we examined both the association and dissociation phases. To examine the association phase, we injected BBMVs (diluted 1:10 with HBS) over these surfaces for a 300-s period at 5 μl/min and recorded the increase in vesicle binding (in RU) over time. These conditions were chosen as they provided essentially surface saturating conditions on the sensor chip. After the initial 300 s, we examined the dissociation phase by injecting buffer (HBS) for 120 s. Information on toxin integration can also be observed during the dissociation phase. Toxins that do not recognize P. xylostella receptors (and are consequently non-toxic) will not integrate into the membrane. On a toxin-immobilized CM5 chip surface, this would cause poor cumulative association (binding) and rapid dissociation as the irreversible component (i.e. membrane integration) of the total BBMV binding would be eliminated. If a toxin binds to a receptor on the BBMV surface and subsequently integrates into the vesicular membrane, an extremely slow rate of dissociation is expected. Binding curves were corrected for mass action by subtracting a control curve composed of injecting BBMVs over 2000 RU of immobilized bovine serum albumin. All injections of P. xylostella BBMVs contained bovine serum albumin (0.01% w/v) as a blocker of nonspecific binding. Surface regeneration conditions were as described previously (30Masson L. Mazza A. Brousseau R. Tabashnik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11887-11896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To determine whether loss of toxicity was caused by loss of ability to form ion channels and to determine the side of helix 4 that faces the lumen of the ion channel, we conducted experiments using the painted bilayer technique (9Schwartz J.L. Garneau L. Savaria D. Masson L. Brousseau R. Rousseau E. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 132: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). PLBs are artificial membranes mimicking the natural phospholipid environment found in the natural membranes of the cells. The membranes were formed from a 7:2:1 lipid mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol painted on a 250-μm circular aperture in a Delrin wall separating two low volume chambers (1.8 mltrans:1 ml cis). All experiments were performed at room temperature in solutions containing 150 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2 and buffered with 10 mmTris, pH 9.5. Single channel currents were recorded with a BC-525C bilayer/patch-clamp amplifier (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Toxin conductances were derived from the slopes of linear regression curves of single channel current data recorded for several voltages applied across the lipid bilayer (9Schwartz J.L. Garneau L. Savaria D. Masson L. Brousseau R. Rousseau E. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 132: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The probability of channels being open (NPo), was obtained by dividing the sum of the total time open of N identical channels by the total recording time interval (31Schwartz J.L. Potvin L. Chen X.J. Brousseau R. Laprade R. Dean D.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3978-3984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conductance data are given as means ± S.E. To determine which side of α4 faces the lumen of the ion channel, we conducted SCAM experiments with D136C and N138C, mutants that have introduced cysteines on opposite sides of α4 (6Grochulski P. Masson L. Borisova S. Pusztai-Carey M. Schwartz J.L. Brousseau R. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 447-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). This powerful method has been used to map the channel-lining residues of several types of cellular ion channels (32Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), including the diphtheria bacterial toxin channel (33Huynh P.D. Cui C. Zhan H.J. Oh K.J. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We exploited the lack of cysteines in wild-type activated Cry1Aa by creating mutants that have introduced cysteines on opposite sides of α4 (6Grochulski P. Masson L. Borisova S. Pusztai-Carey M. Schwartz J.L. Brousseau R. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 447-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). We probed accessibility of these two individually introduced cysteines to MTSES (S67200, Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, Ontario, Canada), a reagent highly selective for cysteines. MTSES is a small molecule capable of passive diffusion into the channel lumen. If the sulfhydryl group of the cysteine is directed toward and exposed within the channel lumen, addition of MTSES should alter the channel conductance in situ by the covalent introduction of a negative charge. A 13 mm stock solution of MTSES was prepared by predissolving the lyophilized reagent in 50 μl of the bath buffer (10 mm, Tris pH 9.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2) immediately before use. After formation of a lipid bilayer, electrical recording was performed for 20 min before protein addition. After injection of 0.1 μmactivated protein near the membrane in the cis chamber, we monitored channel activity for another 20 min by recording step changes in the current required to hold test voltages across the PLB. With the holding potential set at −40 mV, 50 μl of MTSES stock solution were directly added to the cis chamber. Compared with wild-type Cry1Aa, mutant proteins with alterations at the charged amino acid Arg-127 (R127E, R127N) or the polar amino acid Asn-138 (N138C) showed little or no loss of toxicity to P. xylostella larvae (Table I). In contrast, mutant proteins with alterations of charged amino acids at Asp-136 (D136N, D136C), Arg-131, (R131D, R131Q), and Glu-129 (E129K) were not toxic.Table IToxicity of Cry proteins to P. xylostella larvaeMutantaAll mutants tested were protoxins unless otherwise indicated.ConcentrationMortalitybMortality after five days was adjusted for control mortality.R-group changec+ = positive; − = negative; P = polar.μg/ml%Cry1Aa136none109610098R127E111+ to −10100R127N18+ to P10100R131D10+ to −100R131Q10+ to P100E129K103− to +1003E129Kc+ = positive; − = negative; P = polar.100− to +D136N10− to P100D136C102− to P1000D136CdPurified trypsin-activated toxin.100− to PN138C1095P to P10080a All mutants tested were protoxins unless otherwise indicated.b Mortality after five days was adjusted for control mortality.c + = positive; − = negative; P = polar.d Purified trypsin-activated toxin. Open table in a new tab As expected, Cry1Aa bound readily to BBMVs, and the non-toxic protein Cry1E did not (Fig.2 A). Non-toxic mutant proteins E129K and R131D showed patterns of association and dissociation that were virtually identical to those of Cry1Aa (Fig. 2). These results imply that loss of binding was not responsible for the loss of toxicity of these two mutants. Two other non-toxic mutants, D136C and R131Q, showed minor differences in association compared with the patterns observed for Cry1Aa (Fig.2 A). Both D136C and R131Q bound BBMVs at the same initial rate as Cry1Aa, yet their rate of binding decreased sooner than did that of Cry1Aa. Although D136C and R131Q bound slightly lower levels of BBMVs and thus had a lower starting point in the dissociation phase, their rates of dissociation were similar to that of Cry1Aa (Fig.2 B). A doubling of the concentration of D136C produced binding that exceeded that of Cry1Aa (see D136C* in Fig.2 A), yet a 10-fold increase in the concentration of D136C did not restore toxicity to P. xylostella larvae (Table I). The lack of correlation between binding and toxicity across concentrations of Asp-136 supports the idea that loss of binding was not responsible for the loss of toxicity. The ability to form functional ion channels was reduced or absent in four nontoxic mutants tested, but not in the toxic mutant N138C. Cry1Aa, the toxic mutant N138C, and the nontoxic mutant D136C formed ion channels at all voltages tested between −100 and +100 mV (Fig. 3). The conductance of toxic mutant N138C (481.3 ± 7.4 picosiemens, n = 5) did not differ from that of Cry1Aa (519.0 ± 19.9 picosiemens, n = 10), but the nontoxic mutant D136C had a considerably lower conductance (74.5 ± 14.9 pS, n = 4). With E129K, (Fig. 3, bottom trace), channel activity was only observed at high holding potentials (i.e. above 100 mV). Its conductance (16.3 ± 3.3 pS, n = 2) was 3% of that determined for Cry1Aa, and activity lasted only a few minutes. There was no channel activity observed with non-toxic mutant D136N (n = 3). Although toxic mutant N138C partitioned into the membrane as easily as Cry1Aa and had the same conductance, its probability of channels being open (NPo) was 12% compared with 65% for Cry1Aa at −40 mV. NPo for D136C was only 2.0%. In SCAM experiments with D136C and N138C, addition of MTSES caused changes within minutes (Fig. 4). With D136C (Fig. 4, left, bottom), MTSES substantially increased the conductance of the channel (498.7 ± 36.4 pS, n = 4) and its NPo (97%). With N138C, MTSES did not affect channel conductance (495.0 ± 10.4 pS, n = 5, Fig. 4, right, bottom), butNPo increased to almost 77%. MTSES had no effect on PLBs alone or on channels formed by Cry1Aa. Mutant proteins with alteration of three charged residues (Glu-129, Arg-131, and Asp-136) were not toxic, which shows that these three residues of helix 4 directly affect toxicity. Two of these charged residues (Glu-129 and Asp-136) occur on the same side of helix 4 (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, mutants with alteration of a charged residue (Arg-127) or a polar residue (Asn-138) on the opposite side of helix 4 relative to Asp-136 retained full toxicity. The third nontoxic mutant, Arg-131, has an intermediate location between these two groups. Taken together, these results imply that within helix 4, some but not all charged residues are important for toxicity. Further, they suggest that the side of helix 4 containing Glu-129 and Asp-136 is important in toxicity. Our results also suggest that loss of toxicity was caused by severely reduced ability to conduct ions through ion channels rather than disruption of binding or membrane integration. Reduced binding was not seen in two of the four non-toxic mutants examined (E129K and R131D); the other two (R131Q and D136C) showed minor changes in the associative phase only. Further, none of the non-toxic mutants showed major alterations in dissociation rate patterns, which suggests that they readily integrated into the BBMVs. These results differ from those of Chen et al. (34Chen X.J. Curtiss A. Alcantara E. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6412-6419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) who concluded that two domain I mutants, which replaced a polar or a hydrophobic residue with a negatively charged residue, lacked toxicity because of their inability to integrate into BBMVs. The mutations studied by Chen et al.(34Chen X.J. Curtiss A. Alcantara E. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6412-6419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) are not in α4 but rather in the interhelical loop region between α4 and α5 (Y153D) and the N terminus of α3 (A92E). Results using three non-toxic mutants (E129K, D136C, D136N) in PLBs show that alteration of these charged residues either prevented ion channel formation or greatly reduced conductance. Consistent with these results, the non-toxic positively charged mutant R131Q also had a reduced conductance (approximately 250 pS, data not shown). These results suggest that Glu-129 and Asp-136 face the channel lumen and are directly involved in controlling the movement of ions through the channel. Addition in situ of the negatively charged MTSES functional group to the single cysteine introduced in D136C restored conductance to levels approaching that of Cry1Aa, which supports the hypothesis that Asp-136 faces the lumen of the ion channel and is directly involved in ion flow. Moreover, the size of the negatively charged side chain differs between Asp-136 and D136C treated with MTSES, which suggests that it is the negative charge and not the side chain per se that regulates ion flow. Unlike the non-toxic mutants described above, mutant N138C retained both wild-type toxicity and conductance. Thus, we infer that this residue is not directly involved in ion flow. Further, structural models show that Asn-138 is on the side of helix 4 opposite from D136C (Fig. 1 B). MTSES did not affect conductance of N138C, which is not surprising, because conductance of this mutant toxin without MTSES was similar to conductance of Cry1Aa. AlthoughNPo was not correlated with toxicity, MTSES unexpectedly increased NPo for N138C as well as for D136C, suggesting both residues were accessible to MTSES. From a different perspective, if α4 is the only helix lining the channel with the more hydrophobic α5 being anchored into the lipid membrane, Asn-138 would naturally face toward α5 (Fig.1 B), as opposed to the channel lumen. This configuration would account for its insensitivity to both conductance and toxicity changes after mutation but yet remain accessible to the alkylating reagent. Only further experimentation will show if α5 serves solely as a lipid anchor or plays a more direct role in ion flow. A similar topology to that described above has recently been proposed for the members of one of the two classes of tetrameric K+ channels in which each subunit contributes two membrane-spanning helices. These helices are arranged in the membrane such that an inner helix faces the channel lumen while an outer helix faces the lipid environment (35Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5769) Google Scholar). Despite accessibility of N138C to MTSES and considering that conductance (i.e. the rate of ion flow) depends on the residues lining the lumen of the ion channel, the conclusion that Asn-138, unlike Asp-136, does not face the lumen of the ion channel is supported by the toxicity of N138C, the normal conductance of N138C, and the position of this residue in α4. Comparisons with other Cry1 toxins suggest that negatively charged residues are essential in helix 4. A sequence alignment (36Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar) shows that the 12 Cry1 toxins examined have a negatively charged residue in the middle of α4 (Fig. 1) either at position 136 (Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1D, and Cry1E) or two residues further downstream (Cry1B, Cry1C, Cry1F, Cry1G, Cry1H, Cry1J, Cry1K). It is important to note that the crystal structures for Cry1 toxins other than Cry1Aa are unknown, therefore it remains to be determined whether the charged residues of the latter group are oriented on the side of α4 furthest from α5 (like Asp-136). Structural models suggest that in all cases except Cry1H, at least two negatively charged residues occur on the same helical face, as seen in α4 of Cry1Aa. Further experimentation using Cry1H and other toxins should reveal the roles and relative importance of negatively charged residues in different positions in helix 4.

The inserted hairpins of four toxin molecules aggregate so that the hydrophilic faces of four α4 helices form the lumen of the pore. The α4 helices are aligned so that the negatively charged side chains of Glu-129 and Asp-136 extend into the channel lumen forming two concentric rings of negative charges. Our proposed tetrameric structure represents the minimal configuration for a functional Bt ion channel. Channel size increases with time because of further subunit aggregation of toxin molecules with the initial tetramer. In summary, our results provide some new insights into the architecture of Cry toxin ion channels and the ion pathway. A more detailed structure of the channel will require extensive cysteine mutagenesis and thiol-reactive reagent probing of both α4 and α5. As understanding of the mode of action of Bt toxins improves, so too will the ability to design toxins to increase toxicity and to combat evolution of resistance by pests (37Tabashnik B.E. Liu Y.B.

While the roles of cyclin-dependent kinases in phosphorylating and inactivating pRB have been characterized in detail, the roles of protein phosphatases in regulating the G1/S transition are not as well understood. We used cell-permeable inhibitors of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A to assess the contributions of these phosphatases in regulating cyclin-dependent kinase activity and pRB phosphorylation. Treating asynchronously growing Balb/c 3T3 cells with PP2A-selective concentrations of either okadaic acid or calyculin A caused a time- and dose-dependent decrease in pRB phosphorylation. Okadaic acid and calyculin A had no effect on pRB phosphatase activity even though PP2A was completely inhibited. The decrease in pRB phosphorylation correlated with inhibitor-induced suppression of G1cyclin-dependent kinases including CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. The inhibitors also caused decreases in the levels of cyclin D2 and cyclin E, and induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21Cip1 and p27Kip1. The decrease in cyclin-dependent kinase activities were not dependent on induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors since CDK inhibition still occurred in the presence of actinomycin D or cycloheximide. In contrast, selective inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 with tautomycin inhibited pRB phosphatase activity and maintained pRB in a highly phosphorylated state. The results show that protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A, or 2A-like phosphatases, play distinct roles in regulating pRB function.

The active form of pRB binds and inactivates transcription factors, including members of the E2F family, whose target genes are necessary for S phase (1Riley D.J. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H. Annu. Rev.

The activity of pRB is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of serine and threonine residues. pRB is dephosphorylated during mitosis, and the active, hypophosphorylated form inhibits cell cycle progression during early and mid G1 (4Ludlow J.W. Shon J. Pipas J.M. Livingston D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 387-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). pRB accumulates in the inactive, hyperphosphorylated state in late G1 and phosphorylation is maintained during S and G2. Hyperphosphorylation causes dissociation of pRB from E2F, induction of gene transcription, and progression into S phase (5Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). Because of its central role in progression through G1, pRB serves as an important point of integration for numerous signaling pathways that influence the cell cycle (2Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar).pRB is phosphorylated by members of the cyclin-dependent family of serine/threonine kinases whose active forms consist of a catalytic subunit (CDK) complexed with a cyclin partner (2Weinberg R.A.

The major kinases that phosphorylate pRB during G1 include cyclin E-CDK2, cyclin D-CDK4, and cyclin D-CDK6. pRB phosphorylation is initiated in a growth factor-dependent manner by assembly of cyclin D with CDK4. Phosphorylation is then accelerated during late G1 by cyclin E-CDK2 (6Matsuoka M. Kato J.Y. Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7265-7275Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Maintenance of the phosphorylated state during S and G2 is due to the actions of cyclin A- and cyclin B-CDK complexes. Cyclin-CDK complexes phosphorylate multiple proline-directed consensus sites on pRB (7Lees J.A. Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The activities of G1 CDKs are regulated not only by the availability of cyclins, but also by activating (8Morgan D.O.

Inhibitors of G1 CDKs include p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2. Cyclin D-CDKs are also inhibited by a set of specific CDK inhibitors termed INK4 proteins (11Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 1990; 63: 405-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that PP2A plays a role in the G2 to M transition. The G2/M function of PP2A is likely to involve regulation of the activation or activity of the cyclin B-CDC2 protein kinase (27Lee T.H. Solomon M.J. Mumby M.C. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1991; 64: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 28Lee T.H. Turck C. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that PP2A functions in the G1/S transition. Exposure of mammalian cells to the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid causes dephosphorylation of pRB, inhibition of DNA synthesis, and G1 arrest (29Ishida Y. Furukawa Y. DeCaprio J.A. Saito M. Griffin J.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 30Vandré D.D. Wills V.L. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 79-91PubMed Google Scholar, 31Schönthal A.

Since PP2A and PP2A-like phosphatases are more sensitive to okadaic acid than PP1, these results imply that the effects of this toxin in G1 may be due to suppression of PP2A. They also suggest that PP2A activity is required for entry into S phase. The dephosphorylation of pRB in response to okadaic acid is somewhat paradoxical and indicates that an okadaic acid-insensitive phosphatase dephosphorylates pRB. While these results demonstrate that protein phosphatases are intimately involved in the control of the G1/S transition and the dynamic regulation of pRB phosphorylation, the sites of action of individual enzymes are not known.Several toxins are highly specific inhibitors of members of the PPP family of serine/threonine phosphatases (34MacKintosh C. MacKintosh R.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 444-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 35Sheppeck J.E. Gauss C.M. Chamberlin A.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1739-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The differential sensitivities to these inhibitors has provided methods to identify and quantitate the levels of PP1 and PP2A in cell and tissue extracts (36Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Several of these inhibitors including okadaic acid, calyculin A, and tautomycin are membrane-permeable and potently inhibit phosphatase activity in intact cells. Due to their differential affinities for PP1 and PP2A and their distinct permeation properties, these three inhibitors can inhibit PP1 and PP2A in a highly selective manner (37Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We used these inhibitors to identify the roles and potential mechanisms of PP1 and PP2A in regulating pRB phosphorylation. The results demonstrate that both phosphatases are involved in controlling the level of pRB phosphorylation but that they act through distinct mechanisms. PP2A, or a PP2A-like phosphatase, is crucial for activation or maintenance of G1 cyclin-dependent kinase activity, while PP1 directly dephosphorylates pRB.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study show that both PP1 and PP2A are involved in regulation of pRB phosphorylation but that they play very distinct roles in this process. Our data provide further support to the proposal that PP1 is the relevant pRB phosphatase in vivo while PP2A functions to regulate the activities of G1cyclin-dependent kinases. The actions of the two phosphatases were differentiated using inhibitors that selectively suppress either PP1 or PP2A. Assays of PP1 and PP2A activity in lysates from inhibitor-treated cells verified the selectivity of the inhibitors. Okadaic acid has a 4,000-fold lower Kifor PP2A than for PP1 and is the most selective of the inhibitors (44Takai A. Sasaki K. Nagai H. Mieskes G. Isobe M. Isono K. Yasumoto T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Accordingly, concentrations of OA as high as 1 μm caused complete inhibition of PP2A with very little effect on PP1. Calyculin A has less selectivity (9-fold preference for PP2A). Although treating Balb/c 3T3 cells with higher concentrations of CL-A caused inhibition of PP1, we found that a concentration of 50 nm for 3–4 h completely inhibited PP2A but had little or no significant effect on PP1. Tautomycin has an 800-fold lower Ki for PP1 than PP2A. Treating cells with 10 μm TAU was associated with nearly complete inhibition of PP1, while PP2A was reduced to 50% of control values. Although the Ki of TAU for inhibition of PP1 is 0.4 nm in vitro, the weak ability of the drug to permeate cells necessitated the use of high concentrations and long incubation times (37Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Several recently identified members of the PPP family, including PP4, PP5, and PP6, are also inhibited by low concentrations of OA in vitro (49Cohen P.T.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In the absence of information regarding their sensitivities to other inhibitors, our results cannot distinguish between functions of PP2A and these novel PP2A-like phosphatases. It should be noted, however, that these novel enzymes are generally present at much lower levels than PP2A. The effects of OA, CL-A, and TAU on phosphatase activities in Balb/c 3T3 cells are very similar to their effects on PP1 and PP2A in MCF-7 cells (37Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar).The effects of phosphatase inhibitors on Balb/c 3T3 cells support a major role for PP1 in catalyzing dephosphorylation of pRB in intact cells. Selective inhibition of PP2A with either OA or CL-A induced dephosphorylation of pRB, indicating that a pRB phosphatase remains active under these conditions. Consistent with this observation, PP2A selective concentrations of these inhibitors had no effect on pRB phosphatase activity in lysates from treated cells. The pRB phosphatase in lysates from OA- or CL-A-treated cells could be classified as PP1 based on its insensitivity to 5 nm OA. In contrast to PP2A selective drugs, the PP1-selective inhibitor TAU resulted in maintenance of pRB in the highly phosphorylated state and inhibited pRB phosphatase activity. Although TAU was not as selective for PP1 as OA and CL-A were for PP2A in intact cells, the ability of TAU treatment to reduce pRB phosphatase activity was consistent with its classification as PP1. The fact that concentrations of OA and CL-A that completely inhibited PP2A had no effect on pRB phosphatase made it unlikely that PP2A played a significant role in the direct dephosphorylation of pRB.PP1 has been identified as a major activity that dephosphorylates pRB during mitosis (16Ludlow J.W. Glendening C.L. Livingston D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 50Alberts A.S. Thorburn A.M. Shenolikar S. Mumby M.C. Feramisco J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and plays an important role in the G1/S transition. The PP1 catalytic subunit interacts directly with pRB (19Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Biochemical fractionation of mitotic extracts has shown that an active form of pRB phosphatase is a high molecular weight complex composed of the PP1 catalytic subunit and a 110-kDa interacting protein (18Nelson D.A. Krucher N.A. Ludlow J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4528-4535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This oligomeric form of PP1 may be the same as a nuclear PP1 complex identified previously that contains the catalytic subunit complexed to an inhibitory protein termed R111 (51Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The 110-kDa regulatory subunit of the pRB phosphatase may be identical to two homologous PP1 interacting proteins termed PNUTS (52Allen P.B. Kwon Y.G. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4089-4095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and p99 (53Kreivi J.P. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Lyon C.E. Morrice N.A. Cohen P. Lamond A.I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Support for a role of PP1 in regulating the G1/S transition stems from experiments using a constitutively active mutant of PP1. Introduction of this mutant PP1 caused an arrest in late G1 that was dependent on the maintenance of pRB in the active, dephosphorylated state (20Berndt N. Dohadwala M. Liu C.W.Y. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, there is a peak of PP1 activity associated with early G1 (17Dohadwala M., da, C. Hall F.L. Williams R.T. Carbonaro-Hall D.A. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Berndt N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), which could serve to maintain pRB in the dephosphorylated state.Our results indicate that PP2A also plays an important role in the G1/S transition. Selective inhibition of PP2A, or PP2A-like phosphatases, causes decreases in cyclin D2 and cyclin E, induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, and inhibition of CDK4, CDK6, and CDK2 protein kinase activity. These data indicate that PP2A activity is required for the normal regulation of G1 CDKs. Our results are consistent with previous studies in NIH 3T3 cells showing that okadaic acid causes a G1 arrest that correlates with decreased pRB phosphorylation, decreased CDK activity, and a block in cyclin A, CDC2, and CDK2 expression (31Schönthal A. Feramisco J.R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 433-441PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with a role in transcriptional regulation of CDC2, transient expression of the PP2A catalytic subunit can positively regulate CDC2 gene expression (54Jaramillo-Babb V.L. Sugarmans J.L. Scavetta R. Wang S.J. Berndt N. Born T.L. Glass C.K. Schönthal A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5988-5992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the effects of OA may depend on the cell type as OA caused induction rather than repression of cyclin A, cyclin B, and CDC2 in transformed cells (55You J. Bird R.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We show here that PP2A selective concentrations of OA or CL-A cause transcription-dependent up-regulation of p21 and p27. Induction of p21 by OA has been observed previously but it was not clear whether this effect was due to inhibition of PP1 or PP2A (56Zeng Y.X. el-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1557-1564PubMed Google Scholar, 57Sheikh M.S. Garcia M. Zhan Q. Liu Y. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1599-1607PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of inhibiting PP2A on G1 CDKs support the hypothesis that PP2A is a positive regulator of the G1/S transition. The positive role for PP2A at G1/S contrasts with its negative role in the G2/M transition. Both genetic (25Kinoshita N. Yamano H. Niwa H. Yoshida T. Yanagida M.

The contrasting actions of PP2A in G1 and G2/M are likely to be due to the actions of distinct PP2A holoenzymes that are targeted to G1 versus G2/M substrates (22Mayer-Jaekel R.E.

Rev. 1993; 73: 673-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar).Although selective inhibition of PP2A caused the induction of multiple mechanisms that suppress CDK activity, inhibition of cyclin D-CDK4 appeared to be a major component of the reduced pRB phosphorylation. CDK6 was only present at very low levels in Balb/c 3T3 cells and was unlikely to account for a significant portion of the pRB kinase activity. Suppression of cyclin E-CDK2 is also likely to be an important mechanism in the dephosphorylation of pRB caused by PP2A-selective phosphatase inhibitors. However, this mechanism may be secondary to CDK4 inactivation since cyclin E expression is itself responsive to E2F released following pRB phosphorylation (3Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar). In addition to reduction in cyclin D and induction of CDK inhibitors, the reduction in CDK4 kinase activity induced by inhibition of PP2A may involve additional mechanisms. Induction of CDK inhibitors was not necessary since CDK4 was inhibited to the same extent in the presence of actinomycin D or cycloheximide, which completely blocked induction of p21 and p27. The rapid reduction of CDK4 activity was sensitive to concentrations of CL-A (10 nm) that had no effect on the level of cyclin D. In addition, the amount of cyclin D present in immunoprecipitated CDK4 complexes was the same in control cells and cells treated with phosphatase inhibitors. This latter result indicated that even though cyclin D levels decreased, the levels present after drug treatment were still sufficient to form complexes with CDK4. Additional mechanisms are therefore likely to be involved in PP2A-mediated down-regulation of CDK4 activity. PP2A could be necessary for the activity of CDK activating kinase which phosphorylates Thr172 in the activation loop of CDK4 (6Matsuoka M. Kato J.Y. Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7265-7275Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). PP2A could also directly dephosphorylate the activating Thr172phosphorylation site. Other possibilities include changes in inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of CDK4 (9Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Jinno S. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 376: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) or tyrosine dephosphorylation catalyzed by the Cdc25A dual-specificity phosphatase (10Iavarone A. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 387: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein (pRB)1 that regulates the G1/S transition of the cell cycle. The active form of pRB binds and inactivates transcription factors, including members of the E2F family, whose target genes are necessary for S phase (1Riley D.J. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 2Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar, 3Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar). The activity of pRB is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of serine and threonine residues. pRB is dephosphorylated during mitosis, and the active, hypophosphorylated form inhibits cell cycle progression during early and mid G1 (4Ludlow J.W. Shon J. Pipas J.M. Livingston D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 387-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). pRB accumulates in the inactive, hyperphosphorylated state in late G1 and phosphorylation is maintained during S and G2. Hyperphosphorylation causes dissociation of pRB from E2F, induction of gene transcription, and progression into S phase (5Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). Because of its central role in progression through G1, pRB serves as an important point of integration for numerous signaling pathways that influence the cell cycle (2Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar). pRB is phosphorylated by members of the cyclin-dependent family of serine/threonine kinases whose active forms consist of a catalytic subunit (CDK) complexed with a cyclin partner (2Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar, 3Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar). The major kinases that phosphorylate pRB during G1 include cyclin E-CDK2, cyclin D-CDK4, and cyclin D-CDK6. pRB phosphorylation is initiated in a growth factor-dependent manner by assembly of cyclin D with CDK4. Phosphorylation is then accelerated during late G1 by cyclin E-CDK2 (6Matsuoka M. Kato J.Y. Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7265-7275Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Maintenance of the phosphorylated state during S and G2 is due to the actions of cyclin A- and cyclin B-CDK complexes. Cyclin-CDK complexes phosphorylate multiple proline-directed consensus sites on pRB (7Lees J.A. Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The activities of G1 CDKs are regulated not only by the availability of cyclins, but also by activating (8Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar) and inhibitory (9Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Jinno S. Okayama H.

Nature. 1997; 387: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) phosphorylation of the CDK catalytic subunit. CDK activity is down-regulated by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Inhibitors of G1 CDKs include p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2. Cyclin D-CDKs are also inhibited by a set of specific CDK inhibitors termed INK4 proteins (11Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 12Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar, 13Xiong Y. Biochim.

Dephosphorylation of pRB by PP1 is thought to play a critical role in controlling the G1/S transition (14Ludlow J.W. Nelson D.A. Semin.

We showed previously that VIP and PACAP inhibit the production of macrophage-derived tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, nitric oxide, and IL-12. This study examines the molecular mechanisms involved in the VIP/PACAP inhibition of IL-12 production. VIP and PACAP inhibit IL-12 (p40) gene expression by affecting both NF-κB binding and the composition of the Ets-2 binding complex. Both neuropeptides prevent the activation-induced nuclear translocation of the NF-κB components p65 and c-Rel by inhibiting the reduction in cytoplasmic IκBα. Moreover, VIP and PACAP inhibit the synthesis of the interferon responsive factor-1. The decrease in nuclear interferon responsive factor-1 and c-Rel results in alterations of the Ets-2-binding complex. Two transduction pathways, a cAMP-dependent and a cAMP-independent pathway, are involved in the inhibition of IL-12 gene expression and appear to differentially regulate the transcriptional factors involved. Because IL-12 participates in T cell activation and cytolytic T lymphocyte activity and promotes the differentiation of T helper cells into the Th1 subset, the understanding of the mechanisms that affect IL-12 production in normal and pathological conditions could contribute to immune response-based therapies or vaccine designs.

The activated macrophages are widely recognized as cells that play an important role in inflammatory processes, as well as in the initiation, maintenance, and control of specific immune responses. In response to LPS1 and other activating agents, macrophages secrete nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-12, and immunomodulatory cytokines, such as TGFβ1 and IL-10 (1Laskin D.L. Pendino K.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 655-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Because the intensity and duration of an inflammatory process depends on the local balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory factors, the so-called “macrophage deactivating factors” received considerable attention lately (2Kunkel S.L.

Furthermore, we and others have recently demonstrated that VIP and PACAP inhibit IL-12 production in endotoxin-stimulated peritoneal macrophages (20Dewit D. Gourlet P. Amraoui Z. Vertongen P.

Consistent with this latter effect, IL-12 has a pivotal role in the induction of CD4+Th1 cell responses, acting in antagonism to IL-4, the major promoter of the Th2 response (26Manetti R.

In mice, IL-12 plays a decisive role in the protection against intracellular pathogens, including parasites and bacteria (23Trinchieri G. Annu. Rev.

Thus, the understanding of the mechanisms that affect IL-12 production in normal and pathological conditions could contribute to immune response-based therapies or vaccine designs.IL-12 is a unique cytokine because of its heterodimer structure. Bioactive IL-12 (p70) is composed of two disulfide-linked subunits (p35 and p40) encoded by two separate genes. When both subunits are produced within the same cell, they assemble into a biologically active heterodimer (28Gubler U. Chua A.O. Schoenhaunt D.S. Dwyer C.M. McComas W. Motyka R. Nabavi N.

However, although the expression of the p35 gene is constitutive in a wide variety of cells, the p40 gene is highly tissue-regulated, being restricted to phagocytic cells with antigen-presenting capability (29D'Andrea A.

The aim of this study was to understand the molecular mechanisms through which VIP and PACAP inhibit IL-12 production in macrophages stimulated with endotoxin and IFNγ.DISCUSSIONMacrophages are widely recognized as cells that play a central role in the regulation of immune and inflammatory activities, as well as tissue remodeling (1Laskin D.L.

Here we extend these studies to the molecular mechanisms involved in the inhibitory effect of VIP/PACAP on IL-12 production. We focused on the regulation of the 40-kDa IL-12 subunit that is induced by bacterial stimulation in phagocytic cells. Production of IL-12 is maximal when macrophages are primed with IFNγ for 12–18 h prior to LPS stimulation (32Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp.

Our results indicate that VIP/PACAP inhibit IL-12 (p40 and p70) production in murine peritoneal and Raw264.7 macrophages. The inhibitory effect is dose-dependent within a wide range of neuropeptide concentrations (10−7–10−10m), with the maximum effect being observed at 10−8m.Peritoneal macrophages have been previously shown to express VPAC1 and PAC1 mRNA and both high and low affinity VIP/PACAP binding sites (46Delgado M.

Recently we showed that VPAC1 and PAC1 mRNA are expressed constitutively, and VPAC2 expression is induced following LPS stimulation in both peritoneal and Raw 264.7 macrophages (22Delgado M.

Agonist studies indicated that although both VPAC1 and VPAC2 mediate the inhibitory effect on IL-12, the VPAC1 agonist is significantly more efficient (75% inhibition, as compared with 25–35% for the VPAC2 agonist) (22Delgado M. Munoz-Elias E.J. Gomariz R.P. Ganea D. J. Neuroimmunol. 1999; 96: 167-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, the apparent major role of VPAC1 could reflect the balance between VPAC1 and VPAC2 expression. Because VPAC2 is expressed relatively late during macrophage activation (12 and 24 h), VPAC1 is probably the major receptor type present during the early culture period. The role of VPAC1 as a major player in mediating the effect of VIP/PACAP on IL-12 is supported by the fact that a VPAC1 antagonist reverses the inhibitory effect and blocks the effect of VIP/PACAP on both NF-κB and Ets-2 complex binding and that a VPAC1 agonist mimics the effect of VIP/PACAP.An understanding of the events mediating IL-12 secretion is complicated by the fact that the biologically active IL-12 is a p35/p40 heterodimer (28Gubler U. Chua A.O. Schoenhaunt D.S. Dwyer C.M. McComas W. Motyka R. Nabavi N. Wolitzky A.G. Quinn P.M. Familletti P.C. Gately M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To secrete the biologically active heterodimer, mRNAs for both subunits must be expressed, and both proteins must be translated and assembled within the same cell (28Gubler U. Chua A.O. Schoenhaunt D.S. Dwyer C.M. McComas W. Motyka R. Nabavi N. Wolitzky A.G. Quinn P.M. Familletti P.C. Gately M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The p40 gene is transcribed only in IL-12-producing cells, such as macrophages/monocytes, dendritic cells, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and to a lesser degree B cells. In contrast, the expression of p35 mRNA is ubiquitous and constitutive, although free p35 polypeptide chains do not appear to be secreted (29D'Andrea A. Rengaraju M. Valiante N.M. Chehimi J. Kubin M. Aste-Amezaga M. Chan S.H. Kobayashi M. Young D. Nickbarg E. Chizzonite R. Wolf S.F. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1387-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 30Wolf S. Seiburth D. Perussia B. Yetz-Adalpe J. D'Andrea A. Trinchieri G. FASEB J. 1992; 6 (abstr.): 1335Google Scholar). Cells producing the active IL-12 heterodimer also secrete high levels of free p40 polypeptide chains, although their biological role, particularly in humans, is still undefined (reviewed in Refs. 23Trinchieri G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 251-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 24Trinchieri G. Immunol. Res. 1998; 17: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 25Trinchieri G. Int.

These findings raise the question of how the expression of these subunits is cooperatively modulated by either positive or negative regulatory factors.Previous experiments regarding VIP modulation of cytokine expression indicated different molecular mechanisms, i.e.transcriptional regulation for IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and TNFαversus post-transcriptional regulation for IL-4 (10Ganea D.

The present study indicates that the inhibitory effect of VIP and PACAP on IL-12 production occurs at a transcriptional level, reducing the p40 mRNA levels, with no apparent effect on p35 gene expression.The regulation of the IL-12 p40 gene transcription is complex and involves multiple cis-acting elements. Transcriptional regulation by LPS and IFNγ of the IL-12 p40 gene has been shown to involve a “NF-κB half-site” and transcriptional factors from the Rel family (31Murphy T.L. Cleveland M.G. Kulesza P. Magram J. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5258-5267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells the Rel family includes NF-κB1 (p50), RelA (p65), c-Rel, RelB, and NF-κB2 (p50B, p52) (41Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar). NF-κB consists mostly of p50/p65 heterodimers, which are complexed to the inhibitor IκB in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells; stimuli such as LPS and proinflammatory cytokines induce the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB, followed by the release and subsequent nuclear translocation of the p50/p65 heterodimers, which bind to regulatory sequences in a variety of target genes (41Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar). The present study indicates that VIP and PACAP inhibit NF-κB binding to the IL-12 p40 promoter in IFNγ/LPS-stimulated Raw 264.7 cells. Similar to other studies (31Murphy T.L. Cleveland M.G. Kulesza P. Magram J. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5258-5267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the NF-κB complex induced by LPS/IFNγ in macrophages was supershifted by anti-p50, anti-p65, or anti-c-Rel Abs, suggesting that the NF-κB complexes consist of p50/c-Rel and p50/p65 and that VIP and PACAP inhibit their nuclear translocation. We described a similar inhibitory effect of VIP and PACAP on NF-κB binding activity for macrophage TNFα and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (14Delgado M. Munoz-Elias E.J. Gomariz R.P. Ganea D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4685-4696PubMed Google Scholar, 48Delgado M. Munoz-Elias E.J. Kan Y. Gozes I. Fridkin M. Brenneman D.E. Gomariz R.P. Ganea D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31427-31436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In cells treated with VIP/PACAP, the reduced NF-κB binding correlates with increased cytoplasmic IκB, p65, and c-Rel levels and with decreased nuclear p65 and c-Rel levels. It has been previously described that the inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation by other anti-inflammatory agents, such as IL-11, IL-10, TGF-β1, glucocorticoids, and antioxidants, results from an increase in IκB protein levels, a decrease in IκB degradation, and/or phosphorylation (3Trepicchio W.

In the present study, we demonstrate that VIP and PACAP block IFNγ/LPS-induced reduction of IκB levels by inhibiting phosphorylation of IκBα subunit, without affecting mRNA IκBα expression. It remains to be determined whether both neuropeptides mediate their effects also through inhibition of IκB proteolytic degradation.In addition to the κB site, the ets element TTTCCT was identified as a major response region in the p40 promoter in Raw 264.7 cells (32Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 33Ma X. Neurath M. Gri G. Trinchieri G. J. Biol.

This element interacts with the large nuclear complex F1 that binds to the region between −196 and −292 in a complex way, requiring substantial flanking “anchoring” space (32Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 33Ma X. Neurath M. Gri G. Trinchieri G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10389-10395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The induction of the F1 complex appears to correlate closely with the expression of the IL-12 p40 gene in various cell lines and human monocytes (33Ma X. Neurath M. Gri G. Trinchieri G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10389-10395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 34Gri G. Savio D. Trinchieri G. Ma X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6431-6438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). F1 consists of multiple proteins including Ets-2, IRF-1, c-Rel, and a novel 109-kDa protein (GLp109) that is induced by either LPS or IFNγ (33Ma X. Neurath M. Gri G. Trinchieri G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10389-10395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). VIP and PACAP do not change Ets-2 binding. However, supershift experiments indicate that both neuropeptides reduce IRF-1 and c-Rel, without affecting the Ets-2 protein. This suggests that the inhibitory effect of VIP/PACAP on IL-12 p40 gene expression is mediated, at least partially, through a change in the composition of the F1-binding complex. Indeed, the absence of either IRF-1 or c-Rel was reported to dramatically decrease the transcriptional activation of the p40 gene (34Gri G. Savio D. Trinchieri G. Ma X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6431-6438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).The VIP/PACAP-induced lack of c-Rel in the F1 complex could be related to the inhibition of c-Rel nuclear translocation as discussed above. In contrast, the reduced presence of IRF-1 in the F1 complex is probably due to a direct inhibitory effect of VIP/PACAP on IRF-1 gene expression. Unlike NF-κB, IRF-1 is synthesized de novofollowing exposure to IFNγ (55Harada H. Willison K. Sakarkibara J. Miyamoto M. Fujita T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1990; 63: 303-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In macrophages, the IRF-1 gene responds to IFNγ through binding of the GAF complex generated by the Jak1/2-STAT1 pathway (reviewed in Ref. 56Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have recently demonstrated that VIP and PACAP inhibit IRF-1 synthesis in macrophages by inhibiting IFNγ-induced Jak1/2 activation and the subsequent STAT1 phosphorylation through a mechanism that implies an increase in the intracellular cAMP levels. 2M.

Here we demonstrate, based on biochemical kinetic data, that the HCV helicase acts as an oligomer. The increase in the ATPase kcat of the NS3h protein with increasing protein concentration provided evidence for oligomerization. A sharp decrease in the unwinding rate was observed when the wild type NS3h was mixed with the ATPase deficient mutants of NS3h protein. This provided strong support for both mixed oligomer formation and subunit interactions for the HCV helicase. Chemical cross-linking of NS3h protein was an inefficient process, but yielded cross-linked protein oligomers of various sizes. The information currently available for HCV helicase is consistent with the hypothesis that oligomers of NS3h are not stable and the helicase subunits exchange during unwinding.

Bean D.W. George J.W. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 2Lüking A. Stahl U. Schmidt U. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 259-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). A large number of helicases have been identified at the present time, and, based on their amino acid sequence, they have been divided into several superfamilies (3Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Helicases are also classified as DNA or RNA helicases according to their ability to unwind dsDNA, RNA, or mixed duplexes. The RNA helicases cannot be distinguished from the DNA helicases simply from their amino acid sequence. This is because RNA and DNA helicases share conserved amino acid sequence motifs and can belong to the same superfamily. The RNA and DNA helicases also show similarity in their three-dimensional structures. The HCV helicase, for example, can unwind both DNA and RNA duplexes (4Tai C.L. Chi W.K. Chen D.S. Hwang L.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8477-8484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gwack Y. Kim D.W. Han J.H. Choe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and its three-dimensional structure is similar to Escherichia coli DNA helicases such as PcrA and rep (6Korolev S. Yao N. Lohman T.M. Weber P.C. Waksman G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, the structural differences between RNA and DNA helicases are small and most likely confined to the nucleic acid binding site. Nucleic acid unwinding by a helicase involves the processes of translocation and nucleic acid strand separation. Both of these processes are fueled by ATP hydrolysis and must occur simultaneously. Helicases are therefore DNA and RNA motor proteins that couple ATP hydrolysis to nucleic acid unwinding. The mechanism of nucleic acid unwinding is still unclear and a subject of intense study at the present time. Several models describing either strand separation, translocation, or both are currently in discussion (7Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev.

All of these models require multiple DNA or RNA binding sites that bind and release the nucleic acid in response to conformational changes induced by ATP binding and hydrolysis. In principle, the multiple DNA binding sites can be present on a monomer or on separate subunits of an oligomeric helicase. Many helicases function as hexamers or as dimers, in which case multiple DNA binding sites are provided by separate subunits. Recently, suggestions have been made that some helicases may act as monomers (10Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R.

Different mechanisms have been proposed for helicases that unwind DNA as a hexamer or dimer or as a monomer (7Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev.

Therefore, the determination of the active state of the helicase protein is the first step toward understanding the mechanism of unwinding by the helicase. The investigation of the oligomeric state of the HCV helicase is the objective of this work. An estimated 1–2% of the human population world wide is currently infected with HCV making this virus a major human pathogen (14Di Bisceglie A.M. Lancet. 1998; 351: 351-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Because current therapies are not very effective, the development of new drugs has become critical (15Moussalli J. Opolon P. Poynard T. J. Viral Hepat. 1998; 5: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The single-stranded RNA genome of HCV codes for a single open reading frame. The RNA translates into a polypeptide of about 3000 amino acids that is cleaved by the host and viral proteases into 10 proteins. The non-structural protein 3 (NS3) has two activities. The N-terminal domain contains the protease activity and the C-terminal domain contains the helicase activity. The two domains have been expressed as separate polypeptides and shown to retain protease and helicase activities (16Kim D.W. Gwack Y. Han J.H. Choe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A total of three crystal structures of this protein have been reported (10Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R.

In two crystal structures, no significant intersubunit protein-protein interactions were detected (10Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R.

The protein crystals were grown in the absence of magnesium and in the presence of high concentration of salt and/or polyethylene glycol, conditions under which the protein has no ATPase or helicase activity. Therefore, the crystal structures do not provide definitive information on the oligomeric state of the HCV helicase protein. In addition, weak or transient protein-protein interactions can rarely be detected by crystallographic methods. The oligomeric structure of the helicase domain of the NS3 protein has not been examined extensively by biochemical methods. In this study, we employ several biochemical methods to investigate the oligomeric state of the helicase. Our results show that the HCV helicase functions as an oligomer to unwind DNA. MOPS (free acid) and ATP were purchased from Sigma; [α-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]ATP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protein-protein cross-linking, DNA binding, ATPase, and helicase experiments were performed in the reaction buffer containing 20 mm MOPS-NaOH, 5 mm magnesium acetate, pH 7.0. The experiments described in this paper were conducted at room temperature (24 °C), unless indicated otherwise.

The sequence was found to be identical except for one silent base substitution, C4328T. The expression of the protein in BL21(DE3) E. coli was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The bacteria were harvested and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing in the presence of 200 μg/ml egg white lysozyme (Sigma). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 200,000 × gfor 1 h at 4 °C. The viscosity of the supernatant was further decreased by a sonication pulse. The proteins were precipitated with 70% saturated ammonium sulfate, resuspended in a minimal amount of 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, and applied to a 4.6 × 100-mm POROS 20 MC (PerSeptive Biosystems) HPLC column charged with Ni2+. The proteins were eluted from the column with a gradient from 5 to 300 mm imidazole in 20 mmTris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.0. The flow rate was 8 ml/min; the length of the gradient was 6 min; the fractions were collected on ice. The eluted protein was precipitated with 70% saturated ammonium sulfate, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mmdl-dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5, and further purified on either a 1.6 × 22-cm Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column, or on a 4.6 × 150-mm POROS 10 HQ (PerSeptive Biosystems) HPLC column using a NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.5 m. The protein was concentrated with Ultrafree-4/30k (Millipore), and the buffer was exchanged to 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol. The protein was stored at −80 °C. The resulting protein was pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. The extinction coefficient of the NS3h protein ε280 nm= 47,600m−1 cm−1 was calculated by adding ε280 nm of tryptophan residues (5,690m−1 cm−1) and tyrosine residues (1,280 m−1 cm−1). The protein concentration was determined from absorbance at 280 nm in 8m urea. The concentration was comparable to the value from the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA as a standard. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amino acid substitutions were made in conserved motif I (K1236A) and in conserved motif II (D1316A) (Fig. 6). Open reading frames of both mutant plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Both mutants were expressed and purified in the same way as the wt protein. NS3h protein (10 μm) was preincubated in the reaction buffer with or without nucleic acid for 30 min. After homobifunctional cross-linker, 500 μm BS3 (Pierce), was added, the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for various times. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 m Tris-glycine. Cross-linked proteins were resolved by 3–8% gradient SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. The reaction mixture containing the reaction buffer, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, DNA, and NS3h protein was preincubated for 15 min. The reaction was started by adding either 2 or 5 mm ATP containing [α-32P]ATP and stopped with 0.5 m formic acid. The products of the reaction were analyzed by thin layer chromatography on PEI Cellulose F plastic sheets (EM Science) and quantitated with a PhosphorImager 445 SI (Molecular Dynamics). Oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Poly(U) with average length of 290 bases was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The extinction coefficients for each DNA were calculated based on the extinction coefficients of each individual base. Concentration of each DNA was determined spectrophotometrically. The 32P-labeled partially dsDNA substrate shown on Fig. 4 A was prepared from gel-purified oligodeoxynucleotides as described in Ref. 9Ahnert P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32267-32273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar. BA-S 83 nitrocellulose and NA45 DEAE-cellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) were washed in 0.5 m NaOH for 10 min, equilibrated in the reaction buffer, and assembled into a dot-blot apparatus (Life Sciences) with the nitrocellulose membrane on top of the DEAE membrane. Binding reactions containing NS3h protein, radiolabeled partially dsDNA substrate (Fig. 4 A), 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and reaction buffer were incubated for 30 min, and were filtered through the wet membranes followed by the reaction buffer (20Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12478-12487Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). ATP (2 mm) was added to some of binding reaction mixtures 40 s prior to filtering the mixture through the membranes. The amount of radioactivity retained by each membrane was measured using a PhosphorImager. 32P-Labeled partially dsDNA substrate (2 nm) was added to the mixture of wt and/or mutant NS3h protein, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and the reaction buffer. The resulting mixtures were incubated for 30 min, and the helicase reactions were started by addition of 5 mm ATP. The reactions were stopped by adding gel loading buffer containing 1% SDS, 0.2 m EDTA, 5% Ficoll, and 0.05% both bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. The reaction products were resolved on native 10% PAGE. The gels were fixed, dried, and the radioactivity of the bands was quantitated using a PhosphorImager. The C-terminal helicase domain of the HCV NS3 protein was overexpressed in E. coli. The addition of six histidine residues to the C-terminal end of the wt and mutant NS3h proteins allowed use of nickel-chelating HPLC as the first purification step. The proteins were additionally purified by anion-exchange chromatography. The resulting NS3h protein was homogeneous as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1). Since the activities of the NS3h protein was shown to be sensitive to salt concentration (5Gwack Y. Kim D.W. Han J.H. Choe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), precautions were taken to assure that the actual ionic strength of the reaction mixture was within 1 mm of the indicated conditions. The oligomerization of NS3h protein was investigated by protein-protein cross-linking using BS3, which is a homobifunctional water-soluble cross-linking agent with a spacer length of 11 Å. This reagent is reactive with the amino group at the N terminus and the side chain amino groups of the lysine residues in the protein (there are 16 lysine residues in NS3h). In the cross-linking experiments, a constant amount of NS3h protein was mixed with a freshly prepared solution of the cross-linker. The cross-linking reaction with or without an oligonucleotide (dT20) was allowed to proceed for increasing times. The products of the reaction were resolved by the gradient SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). A number of cross-linked oligomeric protein species ranging in size from a dimer to a pentamer and higher were observed. In the absence of DNA, the cross-linked products were predominantly oligomers that were larger than the octamer. In the presence of 5 μmoligo(dT)20, protein dimers were the major accumulated species. The cross-linked dimers formed in the absence or in the presence of DNA were represented by two bands. Without DNA, the intensities of the two bands were nearly identical. However, in the presence of oligo(dT)20, the faster migrating band was more intense. Other factors such as the presence of ATP, its unhydrolyzable analog (AMP-PNP), or magnesium had no detectable effect on the efficiency or the distribution of the cross-linked species (data not shown). The protein-protein cross-linking experiment showed that NS3h protein was capable of forming oligomers, but the NS3h oligomeric state was not of a defined state. NS3h dimers accumulated in the presence of DNA, but higher oligomers were also present. The overall efficiency of cross-linking the NS3h protein was low. Even after prolonged incubation, all the monomers were not converted to cross-linked oligomers. Thus, either the NS3h does not form stable oligomers or the cross-linking of NS3h with the BS3 reagent is not efficient. If NS3h oligomers are more active than the monomers, then the ATPase and helicase activities of the NS3h protein should increase with increasing protein concentration. Increasing NS3h protein concentration should shift the equilibrium toward formation of oligomers. The ATPase activity was measured in the presence of oligo(dT)20 DNA. The apparent Kd for dT20 (70 ± 20 nm) was determined by measuring the ATPase rates at increasing (dT)20 concentrations, at saturating ATP and NS3h protein concentrations. The Km for ATPase was determined to be 120 ± 30 μm. The ATPase activity was then measured at increasing [NS3h] under saturating ATP (2–5 mm) and (dT)20 (4 μm) concentrations. Under these conditions, the ATPase rates correspond to the kcat values. As shown in Fig.3, the ATPase kcatincreased about 100 times as NS3h protein was increased from 5 nm to 1000 nm. This result indicates that the NS3h self-assembles, and the oligomers hydrolyze ATP at a faster rate than the monomers. A similar increase in thekcat was also observed in the presence of poly(U) RNA, or oligodeoxynucleotides of different sequences, or at a higher temperature (37 °C) (data not shown). The helicase activity of NS3h protein was measured using the strand displacement helicase assay with the synthetic DNA substrate shown in Fig. 4 A. To minimize reannealing of ssDNA reaction products, the concentration of the DNA substrate was kept at 2 nm in the reaction. An autoradiogram of a native gel with resolved ssDNA and dsDNA is shown in Fig. 4 B. It demonstrates that the original dsDNA substrate (lane 1) can be efficiently converted into ssDNA by the NS3h protein (lanes 2–5). Minor bands that did not correspond to either ds- or ssDNA were present on the native gels in some of our experiments. These band contributed to about 10% of the radioactivity and most likely represent DNAs with alternative secondary structure. Since a large excess of NS3h protein over the DNA substrate was used in all the experiments, the minor bands did not affect the quality of the data, and they were not used in gel quantitation. The helicase activity of NS3h protein was measured at four different NS3h protein concentrations. The time courses of the helicase reactions are shown on Fig. 5 A. The unwinding kinetics were fit to a single exponential, which provided the unwinding rates. The unwinding rates increased from 0.01 to 0.35 s−1 as NS3h protein was increased from 50 to 1000 nm (Fig. 5 B). An experiment was designed to further investigate the catalytic activity of the NS3h oligomer and to examine cooperative interactions between the NS3h subunits. The experiments consisted of measuring the ATPase and helicase activities of a mixture of wt and the inactive mutants of the NS3h protein. If any of these activities of the wt protein are inhibited by the inactive mutant proteins, it will provide evidence for cooperativity between the NS3h subunits for the ATPase and/or the helicase activity. Two mutants of the NS3h protein with impaired ATPase activity were created by site-directed mutagenesis. It is known that specific amino acids in the helicase conserved motifs I and II play an important role in the ATPase activity of the enzyme (21Heilek G.M. Peterson M.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6264-6266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kim D.W. Kim J. Gwack Y. Han J.H. Choe J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9400-9409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We made the following single amino acid substitutions in the conserved motif I: GSGK(A)STK, K1236A, and in the conserved motif II: D(A)ECH, D1316A (Fig.6) with the intention of preparing an ATPase-defective mutant. As expected, neither of the mutants showed detectable ATPase activity (Table I).Table IProperties of wt and mutant NS3h proteinsNS3h proteinATPase rateApparent Kd of NS3h · DNA fork−ATP+ATP[ADP] × [NS3h]−1 × s−1nmwt11.4 ± 0.04160 ± 15406 ± 80D1316A<0.001160 ± 20260 ± 50K1236A<0.001 Open table in a new tab We compared the DNA binding properties of the wt and the D1316A mutant of the NS3h protein using the nitrocellulose-DEAE membrane binding assay (20Hingorani M.M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 7596-7610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A constant amount of radiolabeled partially dsDNA substrate, shown in Fig.4 A, was mixed with increasing concentration of the wt NS3h or the mutant protein in the presence or in the absence of ATP. The complex was filtered through the NC-DEAE membranes, and the amount of protein-bound DNA species was quantitated. As shown in Fig. 7, the amount of protein-bound DNA species was measured at increasing protein concentration both in the absence and in the presence of ATP. The data were fit to a hyperbolic equation, and the fit provided the apparentKd values for the protein-DNA complexes shown in Table I. The introduced mutation did not affect the equilibrium DNA binding property of the mutant protein. Similar Kdvalues for the wt and the mutant proteins were obtained in the absence of ATP. Somewhat different Kd values were observed in the presence of ATP. The ATPase activity of wt NS3h protein was measured in the presence of increasing amounts of either the D1316A or the K1236A mutant NS3h proteins. The experiment was carried out both in the presence and in the absence of DNA. The ATPase activity of the wt protein was essentially unchanged in the presence of the mutant protein (data not shown). This result does not support or contradict oligomerization of NS3h. It merely shows that each helicase subunit hydrolyses ATP independently from the others. The helicase activity of the wt protein was measured in the presence of increasing mutant protein concentration. Because the concentration of the mixture of proteins was greater than the concentration of the dsDNA substrate, we had to provide equal DNA binding opportunity for both the proteins. To achieve that, the dsDNA substrate was added to the helicase reaction that already contained premixed wt and mutant NS3h proteins. Under these conditions, the chances of each protein binding to the DNA substrate were directly proportional to the protein concentration and inversely proportional to the Kdof the protein-DNA complex. Fig. 8 A shows the unwinding reaction time courses of the reactions that contained a constant amount of the wt NS3h protein and increasing amounts of the D1316A mutant. Each kinetic curve was fit to a single exponential equation. The exponential rates were then plotted against the D1316A mutant concentration (Fig. 8 B). A sharp decrease in the unwinding rate was observed as the wt protein was titrated with increasing concentration of the mutant protein. The amplitude of unwinding showed only a mild decrease (Fig. 8 C). Similar results were observed also with the K1236A mutant protein (data not shown). The inhibition data were analyzed in a quantitative manner to distinguish between inhibition resulting from interacting subunitsversus simple competition for DNA substrate. As shown under “Discussion,” these results provide strong support for interacting subunits in the NS3h oligomer. The process of unwinding double-stranded nucleic acid requires helicases to translocate along the nucleic acid substrate in a unidirectional manner. During translocation the helicase has to bind and release the nucleic acid in a cyclical manner. To translocate processively, the helicase must use at least two nucleic acid binding sites in order to maintain contact with the nucleic acid via one of these binding sites (8Lohman T.M. Thorn K. Vale R.D. Cell. 1998; 93: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This requires that the two nucleic acid binding sites interact and conduct cooperative catalysis. Multiple subunits of an oligomeric helicase can provide the interacting nucleic acid binding sites. Alternatively, domains within a single helicase polypeptide can provide these sites. Thus, in principle, a helicase can act as a monomer or an oligomer as long as interacting DNA binding sites are provided by the structure of the protein. We have investigated the oligomeric structure of the helicase from hepatitis C virus to understand its mechanism of action. The methods that are usually suitable for studying proteins that form stable oligomers such as x-ray crystallography, analytical sedimentation, and gel filtration chromatography did not detect oligomerization of the helicase domain of the HCV NS3 protein (10Kim J.L.

Protein-protein cross-linking studies reported in this paper with a bifunctional cross-linking reagent provided some evidence for oligomerization of the NS3h protein. Upon cross-linking, oligomers ranging in size from dimers to octamers and higher were observed. However, the overall cross-linking efficiency was low, indicating that the oligomers were not stable. The cross-linking efficiency was higher in the presence of the DNA, suggesting that the DNA stimulated some intersubunit contact. However, even in the presence of the DNA, a large proportion of the monomers was not cross-linked. There are two mechanisms by which DNA can increase the protein-protein cross-linking efficiency. On one hand, binding of the NS3h monomer to the DNA may s"

The action of tamoxifen is mediated through estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ), which bind to a variety of responsive elements, to activate transcription. To examine the role of these varied elements in the response to antiestrogens, we studied the activation of a panel of differing promoters, by these compounds, in human breast, bone, and endometrial derived cell lines. No agonistic activity was observed in breast cells, whereas all antiestrogens, particularly tamoxifen, exhibited agonistic effects in uterine cell lines. All antiestrogens studied were agonistic in co-transfections of a collagenase reporter gene and ERβ, but tamoxifen alone was agonistic with ERα in (uterine) HEC-1-A cells. The ERα mediated, agonism of tamoxifen was not observed in primary cultures of human uterine stromal cells, whereas the ERβ-mediated agonism of all selective estrogen receptor modulators was present. This suggests that the two receptors operate by distinct pathways and that the response of cells to antiestrogens is dependent on the ER subtypes expressed.

Estrogens and SERMs bind to the ligand binding domain of the ER, allowing dimerization and binding to a palindromic estrogen response element (ERE) upstream of estrogen-sensitive genes.

In contrast, in the uterus, this compound acts as an estrogen agonist, resulting in cell proliferation and in the long term, a 2–5-fold increase in endometrial tumors (34Rutqvist L.E. Johansson H.

Inst. 1998; 90: 1371-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (4869) Google Scholar). In order to gain further insight into the effects of SERMs on the activation of ERα or ERβ in cells derived from breast or endometrium, a panel of reporter constructs was assembled in which transcription was driven by a range of differing promoters and response elements. These constructs were then studied, in transient transfection assays, in human breast and uterine cell lines. The activities of SERMs were found to vary dramatically both between cell type and promoter construct studied. These results suggest that the effects of SERMs, in vivo, cannot be predicted by their actions on simple elements, such as the ERE, in isolation. The reporter panel consisted of the following: 1) a consensus ERE linked to a thymine kinase promoter (pERE-TK-Luc) (36Norris J.D. Fan D.J. Wagner B.L. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1605-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); 2) a fragment of the complement C3 gene containing three nonconsensus EREs (pC3-Pst-T1-luc) (36Norris J.D. Fan D.J.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The internal control plasmid was the β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCMVβ (CLONTECH). The hERα expression plasmid was pCMV5-hERα (53Wrenn C.K. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24089-24098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the hERβ expression plasmid was pCNX2-hERβ (40Ogawa S. Inoue S. Watanabe T. Hiroi H. Orimo A. Hosoi T. Ouchi Y. Muramatsu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Human breast-derived, MCF-7 (ATCC) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with Glutamax I (Sigma) and 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma). Human osteoblast-derived, MG-63 (ATCC) cells were maintained in Eagle's modified minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented as above. Human uterus-derived, HEC-1-A (ATCC) cells were maintained on McCoy's 5A medium (Sigma) supplemented as detailed above. All cell lines were established to be mycoplasma-free both before and after the study was completed. Primary cell cultures were prepared as described previously (41Vigano P. DiBlasio A. Dell G. Vignali A. Vignali M. Acta Obstr. Gynecol. Scand. 1993; 72: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Life Technologies) supplemented with Glutamax I (Sigma), 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 1× antibiotic/antifungal solution (Sigma), and 7.5% sodium bicarbonate. All media were Phenol Red-free, and all serum estrogen was stripped using dextran-coated charcoal powder (Sigma). All transfections were performed using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a ratio of 1:1.5, DNA:Fugene. Cells were dosed 4 h after transfection and harvested 24 h later. Cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega); β-galactosidase activity was determined using a β-galactosidase assay kit (Promega), and luciferase activity was determined by a luciferase kit (Promega). Total cell proteins were extracted as described previously (42Hess R.A. Gist D.H. Bunick D. Lubahn D.B. Farrell A. Bahr J. Cooke P.S. Greene G.L. J. Androl. 1997; 18: 602-611PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using a protein determination kit (Sigma). Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels using a Mini Protean II (Bio-Rad) gel kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were transferred to Hybond ECL membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Mini-Trans-Blot Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked with 10% defatted milk protein overnight at 4 °C. Blots were then washed with TBS-T20 (TBS plus 0.1% Tween 20) three times for 15 min and two times for 5 min. Blots were probed with primary antibody (ERα, 1:1000 (Novocastra Laboratories NCL-ER-CF11, anti-human, mouse monoclonal to full-length human ERα); ERβ, 1:5000 (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc., 06-629 anti-rat, rabbit polyclonal to amino acids 54–71 of rat ERβ)) in TBS-T20 containing 1% defatted milk protein for 1 h. Filters were washed as before and then incubated with secondary antibody (ERα anti-mouse (Sigma), 1:40,000; ERβ anti-rabbit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 1:40,000) in TBS-T20 for 30 min. Filters were rinsed and washed three times in TBS-20 and then probed with streptavidin 3° antibody (1:2000) in TBS for 20 min before rinsing and washing three times for 5 min in TBS-T20. Detection was then performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Studies on the effects of SERMs have, generally, concentrated on signaling through the consensus ERE, and the effect of these compounds on alternative estrogen signaling pathways has yet to be fully assessed. Stimulation of a panel of six diverse estrogen-responsive reporter constructs (as described under “Materials and Methods”) by 17β-estradiol, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, raloxifene, and faslodex (ICI 182, 780) has been studied. Initially, to validate the transfection system, the activation of the ERE reporter (pERE-TK-Luc) was investigated over a wide range of doses of the above compounds in MCF-7 cells. This cell line has high endogenous levels of both ER subtypes, so these were not co-transfected in this study. As expected, 17β-estradiol was found to be strongly agonistic over a wide range of doses. A strong antagonistic dose response was also observed with all three antiestrogens examined (Fig.1). The trans-activation of the promoter panel was then investigated in the MCF-7 cells. The ERE construct (pERE-TK-Luc) was strongly activated, over control levels, by estradiol, while tamoxifen, raloxifene, and faslodex all exhibited strong antagonistic activity (Fig. 2 a). Faslodex was a particularly strong antagonist, reducing activity to less than 1% of the control. In transfections with the complement C3 reporter (pC3-Pst-T1-Luc), estradiol again acted as an agonist, and both raloxifene and faslodex acted as strong antagonists. However, tamoxifen did not produce a response different to that of the control-treated cells (Fig. 2 b). Previous studies found that in HepG2 cells, transfected with this construct, tamoxifen produced an agonistic response (36Norris J.D. Fan D.J. Wagner B.L. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1605-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Using the collagenase promoter (pCol73-Luc), strong estradiol agonism was observed, while all three SERMs showed no significantly different response to the control treatment (Fig.2 c). A similar response was also observed using the TGFα promoter construct (pXP1-TGF1.1e-Luc) (Fig. 2 d). These results show that, while no agonistic activity of antiestrogens was observed in any promoter context, the degree of antagonism, particularly with respect to tamoxifen, varied considerably. No significant activation of the raloxifene response element (pβ3–499-Luc) or adrenomedullin (p-LCF-1543-Luc) reporters (data not shown) was observed in this cell line with any treatment. Activation of these constructs was found in all other cell lines studied; therefore, it was assumed that tissue-specific properties of the MCF-7 cell line prevented expression, rather than any inherent fault with the reporter constructs. The osteoblast cell line MG-63 has been suggested as a model cell line for bone remodeling and is thought to express negligible levels of ERs. However, in Western blots of these cells, both ERα and ERβ expression could be detected (Fig.3). Since we wished to compare the activity of the ERα with that of ERβ, the presence of these endogenous receptors was a potential problem. To test the ability of the endogenous ERs, expressed in this cell line, to activate the reporter genes, reporter constructs were transfected into this cell line without receptor co-transfection. No estradiol-inducible transcriptional activity could be observed in these experiments (data not shown), and it is therefore assumed that in subsequent experimentstrans-activation is a result solely of the co-transfected ER. In the MG-63 cells, all six of the reporter constructs were responsive to estradiol or antiestrogens in co-transfections with at least one of the two ERs (Fig. 4). In general, estradiol was found to be an agonist for both ERα and ERβ, although the degree of agonism did vary significantly. However, estradiol failed to enhance ERβ activity in the context of the adrenomedullin promoter (p-LCF-1543-Luc) and was a very weak agonist of ERα activity in the context of the ERE promoter (pERE-TK-Luc). The later result suggests that even on a very simple response element such as an ERE the two ER subtypes may have distinct activities. Both raloxifene and faslodex were either found to be antagonists or had no effect relative to control on five of the six promoters studied. In contrast, in transfections of the collagenase promoter (pCol73-Luc) (Fig. 4 c) both compounds were ineffectual with ERα but strong agonists with ERβ. The effects of tamoxifen, while mostly antagonistic, were less predictable, since significant agonistic activity was observed in several promoter contexts. In transfections with the TGFα reporter construct (pXP1-TGF1.1e-Luc) slight tamoxifen agonism was only observed with ERα (Fig. 4 d), but with the TGFβ3 promoter (pβ3–499-Luc) strong agonism was observed with both receptors (Fig. 4 e). This suggests that tamoxifen agonism may be both promoter- and ER subtype-specific. When the adrenomedullin reporter (p-LCF-1543-Luc) was co-transfected with ERα, strong estradiol agonism was observed (Fig. 4 f). Both raloxifene and faslodex displayed antagonistic activities, while tamoxifen had no significant activity. Interestingly, in co-transfections with ERβ there was no significant activity, relative to control, in any treatment group. These results suggest that the agonistic activity of ER ligands is receptor subtype-specific. There have been reports that ERα has been detected in HEC-1-A cells, together with ERE binding activity in cell extracts and estrogen-stimulated growth (43Castro-Rivera E. Safe S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 64: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Western blots found both ERα and ERβ to be present, although at levels much below those seen either in MCF-7 cells (data not shown) or in the uterus (Fig. 3). Despite these low levels of endogenous receptors, no transactivation was detected with any of the six reporter constructs when transfected without additional estrogen receptors (data not shown). The activity of the reporter genes in subsequent co-transfections is therefore taken to be due to the transfected receptor alone rather than to endogenous receptors. Uterine cells have been reported to express low levels of the ERβ mRNA in addition to high levels of ERα (44Kuiper G. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar), but the relative levels of the two proteins remain unknown. This raises the possibility of cells, in this tissue, containing active ERα/β heterodimers. Therefore, to investigate the roles of the two receptors, HEC-1-A cells were co-transfected with ERα, ERβ, or an equimolar ratio of the two. In co-transfections of the ERE promoter construct and ERα, strong estradiol agonism was observed (Fig.5 a). Neither tamoxifen nor raloxifene was significantly different from control, while faslodex was an antagonist. In co-transfections with ERβ, although estradiol remained an agonist, both tamoxifen and raloxifene also became agonistic, while faslodex had no significant effect. This suggests that as with the MG-63 cells (Fig. 4 a), even on a simple promoter, such as the pERE-TK-Luc, the agonism of antiestrogens differs markedly between the two ER subtypes. When the two receptors were co-transfected, in a 1:1 ratio, the pattern of agonism observed closely resembled that of the ERβ transfection rather than that of ERα. In the HEC-1-A (uterine) cell line, co-transfections of the complement C3 reporter (pC3-Pst-T1-Luc) with ERα resulted in strong estradiol agonism. Both raloxifene and faslodex produced a strongly antagonistic effect, while tamoxifen displayed no significant activity (Fig.5 b). These results closely resemble those seen in the MG-63 cells. Co-transfections with ERβ gave very weak expression from this construct. Estradiol agonism was observed, however, and both tamoxifen and raloxifene were found to be strongly antagonistic. Faslodex produced no significant effect relative to control. When the two receptors were coexpressed, the pattern of agonism observed using this reporter construct closely resembled that seen with ERα rather than that seen with ERβ; however, the antagonism of faslodex is not as strong as observed with ERα alone. After co-transfection with ERα and the collagenase reporter construct (pCol73-Luc), estradiol produced a weak agonistic response (Fig.5 c), and tamoxifen gave a stronger agonistic response, while the response to raloxifene or faslodex was not significantly different from control. In co-transfections with ERβ and this reporter some weak estradiol agonism was observed, but all three antiestrogens displayed significantly greater agonism than estradiol. When the two receptors were coexpressed, a pattern of agonism was observed closely resembling that seen with ERβ alone. The strong increase in the agonism of both raloxifene and faslodex in cells expressing ERβ raises the possibility of a population of cells responsive to these compounds in the uterus. Transfections using the TGFα reporter construct (pXP1-TGF1.1e-Luc) produced results very similar to those observed in the bone-derived MG-63 cell line. In ERα co-transfections, estradiol produced a strong agonistic activity, and tamoxifen was weakly agonistic, while both raloxifene and faslodex exhibited an antagonistic response (Fig.5 d). In ERβ co-transfections, estradiol was again agonistic, while all other treatments produced no significant effect. Co-transfection of the two receptors produced a pattern of activity resembling that of ERα; however, the estradiol agonism was weaker than that seen with ERα alone. In the context of the TGFβ3 reporter (pβ3–499-Luc) and ERα, weak agonism was observed with both estradiol and raloxifene, while tamoxifen was strongly agonistic and faslodex gave no significant response (Fig. 5 e). In cells co-transfected with ERβ, estradiol was a strong agonist and faslodex a weak agonist, while all other compounds produced no significant response. Interestingly, when the two receptors were coexpressed, a novel pattern of agonism emerged. Both estradiol and faslodex produced weak but significant agonism (p < 0.005), while both tamoxifen and raloxifene produced a strongly agonistic effect (p < 0.001). Co-transfections using the adrenomedullin promoter (p-LCF-1543-Luc) failed to produce any tamoxifen-specific agonism. Irrespective of receptor context, estradiol produced strong agonism, while all three SERMs produced no significant response (Fig. 5 f). Co-transfection of the receptors together ablated the estradiol response. The lack of tamoxifen-specific response is surprising, since this gene was originally detected as an up-regulated RNA in differential display studies of primary endometrial cell cultures treated with tamoxifen. When the two estrogen receptor isoforms were co-transfected, the response to treatment in some cases resembled that seen with ERα alone (Fig. 5, a and c) and in some cases resembled that with ERβ alone (Fig. 5, b andd), and in some cases a novel effect was produced (Fig. 5, e and f). This suggests that not only is the coexpression of ERβ in this tissue capable of affecting the response of ERα but also that expression may give rise to a novel pattern of responses to SERMs. We attempted to delineate the level of ERβ expression required to produce an agonistic response to raloxifene. The expression of ERβ relative to that of ERα was titrated into a set of co-transfections with the collagenase reporter construct (pCol73-Luc) (Fig.6). In this experiment, raloxifene agonism was found to remain weak up to an approximately equimolar ratio of the two receptors. Increasing ERβ expression further produced a rapid increase in raloxifene agonism and a further increase in the agonism of tamoxifen. These results suggest that in a uterine cell, expressing both receptors, significant raloxifene agonism would only be observed if the predominantly expressed ER subtype were ERβ. Whether such cells exist in vivo is, at present, unknown. One of the most striking differences observed in the above transfections was the different agonistic and antagonistic properties of antiestrogens in transfections with the ERE and the collagenase reporter construct. To investigate these differences, the responses of these two promoters were studied in primary uterine stromal cell cultures. After co-transfection of the ERE reporter together with ERα into these cells, strong estradiol agonism was observed (Fig.7 a). Tamoxifen had no effect, relative to control, while both raloxifene and faslodex were antagonistic. In co-transfections with ERβ, estradiol was again agonistic, while tamoxifen, raloxifene, and faslodex produced no significant effect. These results are very similar to the pattern of agonism observed in the HEC-1-A cells. However, when the collagenase reporter was co-transfected with ERα, the strong tamoxifen agonism, observed in the HEC-1-A cells, was absent (Fig. 7 b). Estradiol had a strongly agonistic effect, while both faslodex and raloxifene had no significant effect, relative to control. When the primary cells were transfected with ERβ, estradiol was found to have weakly agonistic effects, while tamoxifen, raloxifene, and faslodex were all agonistic. This result is very similar to the effects of these compounds in the HEC-1-A transfections. This suggests that the signaling via the ERα and the ERβ may be mechanistically divisible, with an ERβ pathway common to the HEC-1-A and primary cells, while the ERα pathway varies between the two cell types. We have analyzed the responses of a panel of reporter constructs based on both classical EREs and “alternative estrogen-responsive elements” to treatment with estrogens and antiestrogens in a variety of cell lines. Striking differences in the response of this panel were found between the three cell lines studied. In the MCF-7 (breast-derived) cells, no detectable agonist activity of any antiestrogen was found. However, the degree of antagonism did vary between the promoters. In this cell line, no response of the TGFβ3 (pβ3–499-Luc) and adrenomedullin (p-LCF-1543-Luc) promoters, to any treatment, was detected. However, these two constructs contain no inserted strong promoter or enhancer regions and so may not be sensitive enough to respond to treatment in this cell type. The ERE (pERE-TK-Luc) and the complement C3 reporter (pC3-Pst-T1-Luc) constructs are both regulated by EREs and yet were found to possess differing responses to SERM treatment (Figs. 4, a andb, and 5, a and b). In the MCF-7 cells, SERMs were less antagonistic in transfections with the complement C3 than the ERE construct, whereas in the HEC-1-A cells this situation was reversed. The pERE-TK-Luc construct contains a single consensus ERE linked to thymidine kinase promoter, while the complement C3 promoter contains at least two divergent ERE-like elements (36Norris J.D. Fan D.J. Wagner B.L. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1605-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that sequence variation within the ERE (45Driscoll M.D. Sathya G. Muyan M. Klinge C.M. Hilf R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29321-29330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) or flanking sequence (46Anolik J.H. Klinge C.M. Brolly C.L. Bambara R.A. Hilf R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 59: 413-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), bending of DNA (47Nardulli A.M. Grobner C. Cotter D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1064-1076PubMed Google Scholar), and ERE separation (48Sathya G. Li W.Z. Klinge C.M. Anolik J.H. Hilf R. Bambara R.A. Mol Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1994-2003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may all influence ER-ERE interaction. Therefore, superficially similar response elements may have differing responses to SERMs, making the action of the compounds difficult to predict in vivo. The greatest differences in responses to SERMs were observed in transfections containing the collagenase promoter (pCol73-Luc). In the MG-63 cells, co-transfections with ERα resulted in weak tamoxifen agonism, whereas in HEC-1-A cells tamoxifen was more agonistic than estradiol. In co-transfections with ERβ in either cell line, all three antiestrogens were agonistic, while estrogen had little effect. The effects of SERMs in uterine cells agree with previous observations in Ishikawa cells (12Webb P. Lopez G.N. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar). When the two receptor subtypes were coexpressed, all three antiestrogens were, again, agonistic. To investigate this interaction further, we studied the activation of the collagenase reporter by various concentrations of the two receptors, in HEC-1-A cells (Fig. 6). Our results suggest that ERβ expression greater than that of ERα was required to elicit raloxifene and faslodex agonism. The agonism of tamoxifen in AP-1 containing promoter contexts has been proposed as a potential mechanism for this compound's activity in the uterus (12Webb P. Lopez G.N. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This could potentially occur via ERα- or ERβ-mediated pathways. However, ERβ is expressed at low levels in the uterus (44Kuiper G. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar), and neither raloxifene nor faslodex exhibit agonist activity, as observed in the ERβ pathway in vitro. Therefore, if the agonism of tamoxifen, in vivo, is mediated through AP-1 activation, it is via the ERα rather than the ERβ pathway. To investigate the activation of collagenase reporter (pCol73-Luc) in a situation closer to that in vivo, we studied the activation of this construct in primary uterine stromal cells. Activity in co-transfections with ERβ and the collagenase reporter was similar to that seen in the HEC-1-A cells. However, in ERα co-transfections, the tamoxifen agonism, observed in cell lines, was not found. If tamoxifen agonism via AP-1 interaction does occur through an ERα-specific pathway, these results suggest that this response is more sensitive in cell lines than in primary cultured cells. Tamoxifen may therefore only act as an agonist on uterine cells that express a “tamoxifen-sensitive AP-1 phenotype.” Co-transfections of the TGFα reporter (pXP1-TGF1.1e-Luc) produced results similar to those observed using the complement C3 construct. The expression of TGFα has been suggested to be regulated by divergent EREs (37El-Ashry D. Chrysogelos S.A. Lippman M.E. Kern F.G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 59: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and several Sp1 binding sites (17Vyhlidal C. Safe S. Toxicologist. 1998; 42: 160Google Scholar, 49Chen X.R. Wright K.L. Berkowitz E.A. Azizkhan J.C. Ting J.P.Y. Lee D.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3179-3187PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the RARα promoter, also thought to be regulated by ERE-Sp1 interactions (50Elgort M.G. Zou A. Marschke K.B. Allegretto E.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), was found to possess reverse pharmacology when co-transfected with ERβ, in HepG2 cells (51Zou A.H. Marschke K.B. Arnold K.E. Berger E.M. Fitzgerald P. Mais D.E. Allegretto E.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 418-430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We did not detect this effect with ERβ and the TGFα reporter construct in the cell lines studied here. It therefore remains unclear whether the novel response reported with the RARα promoter is unique to that gene or a more common property of ERE/Sp1-containing promoters. The adrenomedullin gene was detected as a tamoxifen-induced mRNA species in uterine cells (39Zhao Y. Hague S. Manek S. Zhang L. Bicknell R. Rees M.C.P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis of the expression of this gene found it to be a novel, endothelial, growth factor expressed in both uterine endometrial and stromal cells. However, a construct based on this promoter (p-LCF-1543-Luc) (38Ishimitsu T. Miyata A. Matsuoka H. Kangawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), although responsive to estradiol, had no response to tamoxifen in any cell type studied, including primary uterine stromal cells (data not shown). Unlike the previous study, we co-transfected ERs into the cells; therefore, it is possible that the tamoxifen agonism is reliant on a particular pattern of ER expression. Interestingly, despite activation in response to estradiol in experiments with either ER singly when the two receptors were co-transfected, no activation was found with any compound studied. This further suggests that the regulation of the expression of this gene is highly dependent on ER isoform expression. If this protein is a tamoxifen-induced growth factor in vivo, then it represents a further possible mechanism of tamoxifen agonism and warrants further study. In transfections of the TGFβ3 (pβ3–499-Luc) construct, we were unable to detect any raloxifene agonist activity with either estrogen receptor subtype, in bone-derived MG-63 cells (Fig. 4 e). This construct (52Lafyatis R. Lechleider R. Kim S.J. Jakowlew S. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19128-19136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has previously been found to be strongly induced by raloxifene, but not estradiol, in MG-63 cells when coexpressed with ERα (21Yang N.N. Bryant H.U. Hardikar S. Sato M. Galvin R.J.S. Glasebrook A.L. Termine J.D. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2075-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The reason for this difference is unclear. In HEC-1-A cells, strong raloxifene agonism was found only after coexpression of both ER subtypes. This suggests that activity from this promoter is strongly dependent on the ER subtype expressed. The mechanism by which the ER interacts with this element is still unknown, but direct binding to the DNA seems unlikely (22Yang N.N. Venugopalan M. Hardikar S. Glasebrook A. Science. 1996; 273: 1222-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Further investigation is required to understand the ER's interaction with this promoter and its role in the activity of raloxifene. To study activity of the promoter panel in cells expressing both ER subtypes, both receptors were co-transfected, in equimolar ratios, into the HEC-1-A cell line. We found that some promoter constructs display a pattern of responses similar to that of ERα alone (i.e.the complement C3 promoter), some display a pattern similar to that of ERβ alone (i.e. ERE and collagenase promoters), and some display novel patterns (i.e. raloxifene response element and adrenomedullin promoters). This suggests that while some promoters bind one homodimer preferentially, heterodimer binding may give rise to novel responses to antiestrogens. Therefore, cells expressing certain combinations of receptors may be particularly vulnerable to the agonistic effect of SERMs. Our results show that antiestrogens, and in particular tamoxifen, are more agonistic in uterine than breast cells. However, the strong tamoxifen agonism, observed with some reporter constructs in uterine cell lines, is not observed in primary cultures of uterine stroma. Co-transfections of the two ER subtypes suggest that signaling occurs via a distinct pathway for each receptor and that the binding specificity of the two homodimers is promoter-specific. Further studies are required to investigate the mechanistic difference in signaling by ERα and ERβ (particularly in the context of AP-1 activation) and the observed difference in these pathways between cell lines and primary cultures.

https://openalex.org/W2028501115,"All proteins of Escherichia coli that covalently bind penicillin have been cloned except for the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 1C. For a detailed understanding of the mode of action of β-lactam antibiotics, cloning of the gene encoding PBP1C was of major importance. Therefore, the structural gene was identified in the E. coli genomic λ library of Kohara and subcloned, and PBP1C was characterized biochemically. PBP1C is a close homologue to the bifunctional transpeptidases/transglycosylases PBP1A and PBP1B and likewise shows murein polymerizing activity, which can be blocked by the transglycosylase inhibitor moenomycin. Covalently linked to activated Sepharose, PBP1C specifically retained PBP1B and the transpeptidases PBP2 and -3 in addition to the murein hydrolase MltA. The specific interaction with these proteins suggests that PBP1C is assembled into a multienzyme complex consisting of both murein polymerases and hydrolases. Overexpression of PBP1C does not support growth of a PBP1Ats/PBP1B double mutant at the restrictive temperature, and PBP1C does not bind to the same variety of penicillin derivatives as PBPs 1A and 1B. Deletion of PBP1C resulted in an altered mode of murein synthesis. It is suggested that PBP1C functions in vivo as a transglycosylase only.

Bacterial Cell Wall. Elsevier, Amsterdam1994: 55-71Google Scholar) with the only exception being PBP1C. This protein, which migrates in PBP assays between PBP1B and PBP2 at an apparent molecular mass of about 70 kDa, has not been studied so far (18Schwarz U. Seeger K. Wengenmayer F. Strecker H. FEMS Microbiol.

In addition to 125I-labeled latamoxef (19Labia R. Baron P. Masson J.M. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1985; 15: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the only radioactive β-lactam currently known to label PBP1C reproducibly is the 125I-labeled Bolton and Hunter derivative of ampicillin (18Schwarz U.

However, because a PBP1Ats/1B double mutant is not viable at the restrictive temperature, wild type levels of PBP1C are unable to substitute for the loss of PBPs 1A and 1B (13Suzuki H. Nishimura Y. Hirota Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This may indicate that PBP1C has a specific function different from 1A and 1B. PBP1C attracted our attention when it turned out to be specifically retained together with PBPs 1B, 2, 3, and thedd-endopeptidases PBP4 and PBP7 by lytic transglycosylases coupled to activated Sepharose (20Vollmer W. von Rechenberg M.

This finding could indicate that PBP1C might play an important role in the formation of a multienzyme complex that has been speculated to combine murein synthases and hydrolases (20Vollmer W. von Rechenberg M.

Here we report on the cloning, purification, and biochemical characterization of PBP1C. In addition, it is shown that a deletion of the gene, although viable, greatly affected the type of murein cross-linkage. The strains and plasmids used in this study are shown in TableI.

The phages were eluted by overlaying each well with 50 μl of SM medium before incubating the plates overnight at 4 °C. Plaques from eluted phages were prepared as described (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and were finally resuspended in 1 ml of SM medium containing one drop of chloroform. Fresh, high titer lysates were obtained according to the procedure described by Henderson et al. (33Henderson T.A. Templin M. Young K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2074-2079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Resuspended plaques of selected members of the phage library (0.4 ml) were added to 75 μl of a fresh overnight culture ofE. coli W3110 grown in LB-maltose medium. Phage adsorption was allowed for 20 min at 37 °C without shaking. LB-maltose medium (3 ml) was added to each tube, and samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a shaking waterbath. Phage lysates were prepared as described (33Henderson T.A. Templin M. Young K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2074-2079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To reduce the background expression of PBPs upon infection ofE. coli with selected members of freshly prepared phage lysates, the PBP4, -5, and -6 triple mutant D456 (25Edwards D.H. Donachie W.D. de Pedro M.A. Höltje J.-V. Löffelhardt W. Bacterial Growth and Lysis: Metabolism and Structure of the Bacterial Sacculus.

Then, 3 ml of culture were added to 0.5 ml of phage lysate. Samples were incubated with shaking for 45 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 2 min, cells were resuspended in 60 μl of ice-cold 100 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.02% NaN3, pH 8.0, prior to storage at −20 °C. Aliquots (20 μl) of each sample were thawed, and PBPs were analyzed as described below. Standard recombinant procedures were performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated according to Birnboim and Doly (34Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9908) Google Scholar), chromosomal DNA was prepared as described by Murray and Thompson (35Murray M.G. Thompson W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (9497) Google Scholar), and transformation with newly constructed plasmids was done following the procedure of Inoue et al. (36Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). Ligations were performed with the rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Labeling of the DNA probe for Southern blot hybridization was done with the DIG-High Prime kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Amplification of the 8-kb DNA fragment (37Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.H. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Ehrlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13517) Google Scholar) covering the entire region between ndk and sseA was accomplished with the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The reaction was performed in a volume of 50 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.2) containing 16 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1.75 mmMgCl2, 350 μm deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, and 2.6 units of Taq and Pwopolymerase enzyme mix with 0.3 μm concentrations of each of the primers NdkH3 (5′-TTTAAGCTTTTTGCTACCGCGTTCGGTTTGA-3′) and SseAH3 (5′-TTTAAGCTTATGTGCGGAAGCGGGGAAGTGT-3′) and 1 μl of Kohara λ phage 429 lysate (approximately 1 × 107 phage particles) as a template. Before cycling, the sample was incubated for 2 min at 93 °C, followed by 10 cycles at 93 °C for 10 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 5 min. Another 22 cycles with increasing elongation times (additional 20 s/cycle) under the same conditions were performed. The final polymerization step was an incubation at 68 °C for 7 min. The HindIII sites introduced by the primer pair NdkH3/SseAH3 at both ends of the PCR product allowed for cloning of the fragment into pBC SK+. To construct a deletion in pbpC, the method of Kulakauskas et al. (38Kulakauskas S. Wikström P.M. Berg D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was followed. The 1-kb long upstream and downstream sequences flanking the gene were amplified by PCR using the following pairs of primers: for the upstream region 1CNa, 5′-TTTGGATCCGCCCGTCAGCAAAAGGCT-3′ and 1CNi, 5′-ATCAGGGACAAAACAGACTAGTCGACCAATCAGCAGATCTTCAG-3′; and for the downstream region 1CCa, 5′-TTTGGATCCCAGATGAACGCTGTTCTT-3′ and 1CCi, 5′-GGCTGAAGATCTGCTGATTGGTCGACTAGTCTGTTTTGTCCCTG-3′. The inner primers 1CNi and 1CCi were designed such that they were complementary to each other over the whole length and that aSalI site was introduced in their central regions (underlined characters). PCRs were performed in 100-μl volumes containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.55), 16 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 200 μm each of the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, 4 units of Taq polymerase (AGS, Heidelberg, Germany), each primer at 300 nm, and 0.5 μl of Kohara λ phage 429 lysate (approximately 5 × 106 phage particles) as a template in a Peltier Thermal Cycler PTC-200 (MJ Research, Watertown, MA). Amplification was accomplished by incubation of the reaction mixture for 2 min at 94 °C and cycling of the temperature 30 times (15 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 43 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C) followed by a final 5-min incubation at 72 °C. The PCR products were purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and eluted in 48 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The purified PCR products were joined in a second PCR to create a single 2-kb fragment. Reaction conditions were as described above with the following exceptions: PCR was performed with 0.3 μmof the outer primers 1CNa and 1CCa and 1 μl each of the purified 1.0-kb PCR products as a template. After an initial denaturation for 2 min at 94 °C, amplification was performed in 30 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 52 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 3 min. The final polymerization step was an incubation at 72 °C for 5 min. The purified DNA was restricted with BamHI and ligated with the linearized pBC SK+ vector to yield plasmid pGS20. A kanamycin resistance cassette from plasmid pUC4K (29Vieira J. Messing J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1982; 19: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3785) Google Scholar) was cloned into the introduced SalI restriction site of pGS20 yielding plasmid pGS33. The deletion of pbpC was transduced with the help of the Kohara λ phage 429 into the chromosome of E. coliMC1061. The deletion mutant in pbpC was named TG57. E. coli TG4 harboring pGS21 was grown in 21 liters of LB medium at 28 °C. To induce expression of PBP1C, 10 μm IPTG was added at an A578 of 0.4 and growth was continued until an A578 of 0.5 was reached. The cells were cooled in an ice bath and harvested by centrifugation (24 g wet weight), resuspended in 189 ml (final volume) of 10 mm Tris-maleate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and DNase I (10 μg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All of the following steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were broken by passage through a French pressure cell at 3,000 p.s.i. Membranes were separated by centrifugation (1 h at 70,000 × g) and extracted twice with 1 m NaCl in 10 mm Tris-maleate, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, pH 6.8. To solubilize membrane proteins, the membranes were treated overnight with 2% (w/v) Triton X-100 in 186 ml of the above mentioned buffer. The solubilized proteins were separated by centrifugation (see above) and dialyzed three times against 5 liters of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, pH 8.0. The Triton X-100 concentration in the dialyzed fraction (217 ml) was adjusted to 1% (w/v) by adding another 155 ml of dialysis buffer. The dialyzed and diluted fraction (372 ml) was applied at a flow rate of 23.7 ml/h onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (33 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the dialysis buffer containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. The flow-through was collected in fractions of 8.7 ml and assayed for PBP1C simply by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (39Lugtenberg B. Meijers J. Peters R. van der Hoek P. van Alphen L. L. FEBS Lett. 1975; 58: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Fractions 3–54 were pooled (388 ml) and dialyzed against 10 mmTris-maleate, pH 6.0, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3. The dialyzed material was applied at a flow rate of 61.6 ml/h onto an S-Sepharose Fast Flow column (33 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was equilibrated with dialysis buffer supplemented with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. The column was washed with 1000 ml of equilibration buffer, and retained proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 14.6 ml/h with a linear gradient (330 ml) from 50 to 400 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris-maleate, pH 6.0, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 0.02% NaN3. Fractions of 8.3 ml were collected. PBP1C eluted in fractions 15–25 between 140 and 240 mm NaCl. The pool of 86 ml was directly loaded with a flow rate of 4.6 ml/h onto an equilibrated Green19-agarose column (5 ml, Sigma). The column was washed with 100 ml of equilibration buffer, and retained proteins were eluted in 7-ml fractions with two salt steps: 26 ml of 400 mm NaCl followed by 112 ml of 2 mNaCl in equilibration buffer. The SDS-PAGE of aliquots of the eluted fraction showed that PBP1C eluted with 2 m NaCl. A summary of the purification procedure is shown in Fig. 4. The comparison of the Coomassie Blue-stained gel with the autoradiography of a PBP assay clearly showed the identity of the purified 70-kDa protein with PBP1C (data not shown). The covalent binding of the ampicillin derivative also proves that the isolated protein was enzymatically active. Purified PBP1C (10 mg) was coupled to 3 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the instructions of the manufacturer and the protocol previously described (40Romeis T. Höltje J.-V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21603-21607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All buffers contained 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. As a control, activated Sepharose was treated identically except that no protein was added resulting in a material (Tris-Sepharose) with all functional groups blocked by Tris. A Triton X-100 membrane extract was prepared from a 2-liter culture of E. coli TG57(ΔpbpC) growing exponentially (A578, 0.5). Briefly, cells were broken in a French press, and membranes were separated by centrifugation (70,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). Membrane proteins were extracted overnight at 6 °C with 10 ml of 10 mm Tris-maleate, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, pH 6.8, containing 2% (w/v) Triton X-100. The solubilized proteins were separated from the membranes by centrifugation (see above), and prior to dialysis, the Triton X-100 concentration was reduced to 1% (w/v) by dilution with dialysis buffer (10 mm Tris-maleate, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, pH 6.8). Chromatography was performed in 3-ml columns as described previously (20Vollmer W. von Rechenberg M. Höltje J.-V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6726-6734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The samples (20 ml each) were applied at a flow rate of 1.1 ml/h onto the PBP1C-Sepharose and Tris-Sepharose columns, respectively, and equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-maleate, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, pH 6.8, containing 50 mm NaCl and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. After washing the columns at 4.5 ml/h with 65 ml of equilibration buffer containing only 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100, elution of the retained proteins was achieved in two steps: first with 150 mm NaCl in equilibration buffer containing 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100 (54 ml) and second with the same buffer but containing 1 m NaCl (54 ml). Aliquots of the applied sample, the flow-through, the wash, and the 150 mm NaCl and 1 m NaCl fractions were analyzed for PBPs or subjected to Western blot analysis. PBPs were analyzed with an 125I-labeled Bolton and Hunter derivative of ampicillin following the protocol established by Schwarz et al. (18Schwarz U. Seeger K. Wengenmayer F. Strecker H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1981; 10: 107-109Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the samples were incubated with 2 μl (about 1 pmol) of the labeled ampicillin derivative for 30 min at 37 °C. The PBP-penicilloyl complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography as described below. The muropeptide structure of isolated murein sacculi was determined according to the procedure described by Glauner (41Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Analysis of the length distribution of the glycan strands of murein sacculi was done as has been described previously (42Harz H. Burgdorf K. Höltje J.-V. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To measure transglycosylase activity in different transformants, two different methods were used. Incorporation of14C-N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetyl-d-[U-14C]glucosamine (271 mCi/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) into SDS-insoluble material was followed either in ether-permeabilized cells (43Kraus W. Höltje J.-V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or with crude membrane preparations (44Schaller K. Höltje J.-V. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 994-1000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration was measured by the bicinchoninic acid method of Smith et al. (45Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed according to the procedure described by Lugtenberg et al.(39Lugtenberg B. Meijers J. Peters R. van der Hoek P. van Alphen L. L. FEBS Lett. 1975; 58: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar) using either 10 (w/v) or 12% (w/v) acrylamide. Autoradiography of125I-labeled PBPs was done with Hyperfilm-MP and two Hyperscreen intensifying screens (both from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −70 °C. Films were exposed for times between several hours and several days depending on the PBP concentrations of the samples. Transfer of proteins onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) was done according to the method of Towbin et al. (46Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Staining with Ponceau S (Sigma) confirmed that aliquot amounts of protein had been transferred to the membrane. For detection of the lytic transglycosylases, specific polyclonal antisera from rabbit were used. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with an alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibody (Promega) as described previously (47Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). The sequence of the pbpC gene has been deposited in GenBank™ under accession number U88571. Because of the apparent molecular mass, but also because of a specific binding to moenomycin (20Vollmer W. von Rechenberg M. Höltje J.-V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6726-6734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), PBP1C was likely to be a bifunctional PBP similar to PBP1A and PBP1B. Homology searches, however, did not reveal the gene for PBP1C in the sequences that were present in the data bases in August 1996. This suggested to us that the gene was likely to map in regions not sequenced or not submitted to the data bases at that time. By using the 125I-labeled Bolton and Hunter derivative of ampicillin to label PBPs, a highly sensitive and rather simple assay for PBP1C was available (18Schwarz U. Seeger K. Wengenmayer F. Strecker H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1981; 10: 107-109Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that allowed screening of DNA libraries. We took advantage of the mapped KoharaE. coli genomic λ phage library (31Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) and decided to screen first all those 185 phages carrying nonsequenced (at that time) regions of the E. coli genome. The DNA sequences for a number of known PBPs were found using the PBP assay. Phage 109 resulted in overexpression of PBP3, phage 116 of PBP1B, phage 168 of PBP5, phage 169 of PBP2, and phage 209 of PBP6. Overproduction of PBP1C, as shown in Fig. 1, was observed with phage 429, which covers the region from 56.7–57.1 min of the E. colichromosome. Phages 428 (data not shown) and 430, carrying the neighboring sequences, did not result in overexpression of PBP1C. Thus, the complete structural gene for PBP1C had to be present on phage 429. The sequence information that was available at that time for the 16-kb E. coli DNA fragment present in phage 429 is shown in Fig. 2 A."

Mass spectrometry analysis indicated similar mannosylation, a complete pattern from 1 up to 9 hexose residues/mole of protein, of the native species from the 3 reference strains. The recombinant antigen expressed in M. smegmatis revealed a different mannosylation pattern: species containing 7 to 9 sugar residues/mole of protein were in the highest proportion, whereas species bearing a low number of sugar residues were almost absent. The 45/47-kDa recombinant antigen expressed in E. coli was devoid of sugar residues. The proteins purified from M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, or BCG have a high capacity to elicit in vivo potent delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions and to stimulate in vitrosensitized T lymphocytes of guinea pigs immunized with living BCG. The recombinant Apa expressed in Mycobacterium smegmatis was 4-fold less potent in vivo in the DTH assay and 10-fold less active in vitro to stimulate sensitized T lymphocytes than the native proteins. The recombinant protein expressed inEscherichia coli was nearly unable to elicit DTH reactionsin vivo or to stimulate T lymphocytes in vitro. Thus the observed biological effects were related to the extent of glycosylation of the antigen.

Thus the observed biological effects were related to the extent of glycosylation of the antigen. The immune protection against tuberculosis can be achieved only by prior vaccination with a living vaccine (1Dubos R.J. Pierce C.H. Schaefer W.B. J. Exp. Med. 1953; 97: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 2Kanaı̈ K. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1996; 19: 181-199Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 3Orme I.M. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 3310-3312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An explanation of this phenomenon could be that living bacilli release protective antigens, which are not present in sufficient amounts in dead bacteria or which are not appropriately presented to T lymphocytes. The T lymphocyte immune response plays a key role to control tuberculosis as is also demonstrated by the high sensitivity of AIDS patients to mycobacterial infections (4Scharer L.L. McAdam J.M. Tuberculosis and AIDS: The Relationship between Mycobacterium TB and the HIV Type 1. Springer Publishing Company, New York1995Google Scholar). Some of the proteins secreted by Mycobacterium tuberculosis during its growth have been proposed as potential immunodominant antigens to be included in a future vaccine (5Andersen P. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2536-2544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Horwitz M.A. Lee B.-W.E. Dillon B.J. Harth G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1530-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) or to improve diagnostic tests. Small quantities of immunogenic proteins detected in mycobacterial culture filtrate slow the growth of bacteria and safety precautions needed to work with virulent bacteria generated serious obstacles in obtaining and/or evaluating these antigens. The development of recombinant DNA systems for efficient expression of mycobacterial genes in Escherichia coli appeared as an attractive alternative for obtaining larger amounts of mycobacterial antigens important for immune responses. However, recent reports on post-translational modifications of mycobacterial antigens such as acylation and glycosylation (7Garbe T. Harris D. Vordermeier M. Lathigra R. Ivanyi J. Young D. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 260-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Herrmann J.L. O'Gaora P. Gallagher A. Thole J.E.R. Young D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3547-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) emphasized the importance of comparing structure and biological properties of native bacterial products to those obtained by recombinant DNA technology. In the present paper, we describe the purification and biochemical characterization of Apa also known as the 45/47-kDa complex, a major immunodominant antigen secreted in vitro by the bacteria of the M. tuberculosis complex (i.e. M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, and BCG). 1The abbreviations used are:BCGBacillus Calmette GuénnNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPVDFpolyvinylidene difluoridePBSphosphate-buffered salineESI-MSelectrospray ionization mass spectrometryMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser deionization time-of-flightDTHdelayed-type hypersensitivityTUtuberculin units The gene apaencoding this antigen in M. tuberculosis has been expressed in Mycobacterium smegmatis and E. coli. The recombinant protein showed significant changes in the mannosylation patterns which were correlated with a lower or no potency to elicitin vivo DTH reactions on guinea pigs immunized with living BCG or stimulate their sensitized T lymphocytes in vitro. Bacillus Calmette Guénn nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polyvinylidene difluoride phosphate-buffered saline electrospray ionization mass spectrometry matrix-assisted laser deionization time-of-flight delayed-type hypersensitivity tuberculin units M. tuberculosis H37Rv virulent strain (14 001 0001), M. bovis AN5 (14 002 003), and M. bovis BCG strain 1173P2 reference strains were obtained from the “Center National de Référence des Mycobactéries” (Institut Pasteur). M. smegmatismc2155::apa harboring the plasmid containing the apa gene from M. tuberculosis(H37Rv) (pLA1) has been previously described (9Laqueyrerie A. Militzer P. Romain F. Eiglmeier K. Cole S. Marchal G. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4003-4010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mycobacterial strains were grown on synthetic Sauton medium at 37 °C (10Romain F. Laqueyrerie A. Militzer P. Pescher P. Chavarot P. Lagranderie M. Auregan G. Gheorghiu M. Marchal G. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 742-750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Culture media, harvested after 6 days (M. smegmatismc2155::apa) and 15 days (M. tuberculosis H37Rv, M. bovis AN5, M. bovisBCG) were filtered through a 0.22-μm filter in a glove box before their handling for biochemical procedures. The M15 E. colihost strain, pQE60 expression vector, and Qiagen REP4 repressor plasmid from the Qiaexpressionist system were purchased from Qiagen Inc. Chatsworth, CA. XL1-Blue E. coli harboring the plasmid pLA34-2 (containing the apa gene) (9Laqueyrerie A. Militzer P. Romain F. Eiglmeier K. Cole S. Marchal G. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4003-4010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and M15 E. coli host strain (harboring pREP4) were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (Difco) at 37 °C. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (25 μg/ml) (Sigma) were added for bacterial and plasmid selection and for the maintenance of pREP4. E. coli plasmid DNA was isolated using the Promega purification protocol. DNA manipulations were performed by standard procedures (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Irwin N. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and New England Biolabs. Restriction fragments and polymerase chain reaction products were purified with a Wizard purification system (Promega). The culture filtrates were extensively washed at 4 °C with 4% butanol in deionized water on a PM-10 Amicon membrane then concentrated about 10-fold and freeze-dried. The crude material from M. tuberculosis, M. bovisAN5, M. bovis BCG, and M. smegmatismc2155::apa (50 mg/ml) was suspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 4% butanol. Samples were centrifuged, at 40,000 × g for 2 h to remove insoluble material then applied on a AcA54 Ultrogel (2 × 87 cm) column equilibrated in the same buffer. The fractions containing the 45/47-kDa species and eluted as a single broad peak were pooled and further purified by ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (DEAE-TSK-5PW, 21.5 × 150 mm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, and 4% butanol, at a flow rate of 6 ml/min (maximum pressure, 55 bars). The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 10 mm to 1 m. The 45/47-kDa species eluted at low salt concentration were concentrated after extensive washes on PM-10 membranes, then chromatographed on a reversed phase Aquapore RP300 C8 column (7 μm particle size, 4.6 × 250 mm; Applied Biosystems Brownlee column) equilibrated with 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.5. The elution was made with an acetonitrile gradient (0–90%) in the same buffer, under a flow rate of 2 ml/min with a maximum pressure of 115 bars. Recombinant Apa was expressed in E. coli by use of the Qiaexpressionist system followed by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) purification (Qiagen), and ion exchange chromatography (Source 15Q-Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). Theapa DNA from M. tuberculosis was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from pLA34-2 (9Laqueyrerie A. Militzer P. Romain F. Eiglmeier K. Cole S. Marchal G. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4003-4010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The apa sequence was modified to create an NcoI site via the forward primer (5′-CATGCCATGGTACAGGTGGACCCCAACTTGACA-3′) and aBamHI site in the reverse sequence (5′-TTAGGATCCGGCCGGTAAGGTCCGCTGCGGTGT-3′) in order to subclone the NcoI-BamHI polymerase chain reaction product into the pQE60 expression vector. The translation product resulted in a decapeptide Gly-Ser-Arg-Ser-6×His extension at the carboxyl terminus of Apa. This construct was introduced into the M15 host strain carrying the plasmid pREP-4, which constitutively expresses the lac repressor ensuring a tight regulation of protein expression. The construct included Apa signal peptide coding sequence, the recombinant species were detected among the periplasmic proteins by immunobloting. A single colony of the transformant was used to inoculate 10 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. After overnight growth, 1 liter of LB broth with appropriate antibiotics was inoculated with the preceding culture and cells were further grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. When the OD600 reached 0.7, 2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were added and the culture incubated for 5 additional hours. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min. The pellet suspended in 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 20% sucrose (80 ml/g wet weight) and 1 mm EDTA was incubated on ice for 10 min with gentle agitation. After centrifugation at 8000 ×g and 4 °C for 20 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet resuspended with the same volume of 5 mmice-cold MgSO4. After centrifugation at 8000 ×g for 20 min, the supernatant containing periplasmic proteins was collected. The sample was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and loaded onto an Ni-NTA-agarose column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 10 volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer + 10 mmimidazole and with 10 volumes of the same buffer + 20 mmimidazole. The recombinant antigen was eluted with 10 mmTris-HCl + 200 mm imidazole. Samples were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, then applied onto a Source 15Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biochem) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 10 to 20 volumes of the buffer, then the recombinant antigen eluted with a 0 to 0.5 m NaCl gradient. Fractions containing recombinant antigen were pooled, dialyzed against deionized water, and lyophilized. Protein fractions were submitted to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore). Twin SDS-PAGE (12.5%) were run, one PVDF sheet being stained with AuroDye™forte (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to detect proteins, the other being prepared for immunoblot analysis. Membranes, treated with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C for 1 h, were washed three times with PBS containing Tween 20 (0.2%), then further incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with either a rabbit immune serum directed against a crude M. tuberculosis culture filtrate, or a rabbit immune serum anti-Apa (1/3000 dilution) (10Romain F. Laqueyrerie A. Militzer P. Pescher P. Chavarot P. Lagranderie M. Auregan G. Gheorghiu M. Marchal G. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 742-750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or a monoclonal antibody supernatant (I10–0.3) (1/1000 dilution) (12Horn C. Pescher P. Romain F. Marchal G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 197: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Antibodies were diluted in PBS containing nonfat dry milk and Tween 20. After 3 washing steps in PBS/Tween, the sheets were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with either an anti-rabbit or an anti-mouse IgG goat antibodies labeled with alkaline phosphatase (Biosys) diluted 1/3000 in PBS/nonfat milk/Tween 20. After incubation for 1.5 h at 37 °C, the PVDF sheets were washed three times in PBS/Tween 20 and revealed with a bromochloroindolyl phosphate-nitro blue tetrazolium substrate (13Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect and measure the concentration of Apa in the crude and partly purified samples as described previously (10Romain F. Laqueyrerie A. Militzer P. Pescher P. Chavarot P. Lagranderie M. Auregan G. Gheorghiu M. Marchal G. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 742-750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, a potent polyclonal rabbit immune serum was obtained against the antigen of the Apa complex by using a classical immunization procedure: an injection of 50 μg of the complex mixed with incomplete Freund adjuvant and an injection of 25 μg 1 month later. The purified antigen complex was immobilized on a plastic surface (100 μl at 1 μg/ml in carbonate buffer). The optimal dilution of rabbit serum (1/8000) was chosen in preliminary experiments as the last dilution of the plateau, just before the beginning of the decreasing slope. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with the fraction to be assayed, the remaining antibodies were measured on a plate coated with purified Apa complex. Known amounts of the Apa complex was included in each assay to determine the 50% value. Phosphatase-labeled antibodies directed against rabbit immunoglobulin G were used to determine the amounts of bound anti-Apa antibodies, resulting in a sensitivity of 2 ng/ml. Amino acid composition was performed using a Beckman autoanalyzer 6300, a known amount of norleucine was included in each sample as an internal control. Amino-terminal sequence was performed by automatic Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 473A Sequencer. These chemical analysis were the basis for the determination of protein concentrations in the different immunological assays. Carbohydrate composition analysis was performed on 20-μg samples of native or recombinant Apa molecules, hydrolyzed for 4 h in Teflon-capped vials in 100 μl of 4 m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C. The hydrolysates, dried under vacuum in a SpeedVac, were dissolved in 100 μl of deionized water. A sample of 10 μl was loaded onto a high pH anion exchange column (CarboPak PA1). The elution was run at 1 ml/min with 20 mm NaOH during 25 min on a Dionex high performance liquid chromatography system equipped with a pulsed amperometric detector. 10-μl samples were injected in triplicate and mannosaccharides were identified in parallel runs by injection of samples with known amount of standard sugars. Mass spectrometry was performed with an API 365 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer-Sciex, Thornill, Canada). Samples (0.15 mg/ml) dissolved in water/methanol/formic acid (50:50:5, v/v/v) were introduced with a syringe pump (5 μl/min) (Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA). The device was equipped with an atmospheric pressure ion source used to sample positive ions produced from a pneumatically assisted electrospray interface. The ionspray probe tip was held at 4.5 kV and the orifice voltage was set at 14 V. The mass spectrometer was scanned continuously fromm/z 900 to 1700 with a scan step of 0.1 and a dwell time per step of 2.0 ms resulting in a scan duration of 16.0 s. Ten scans were averaged for each analysis. Mass calibration of the instrument was accomplished by matching ions of polypropylene glycol to known reference masses stored in the mass calibration table of the mass spectrometer. Data were collected on a Power Macintosh 8600/200 and processed through the Biotoolbox 2.2 software from Sciex. A Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) was used. The instrument was equipped with a nitrogen laser. All experiments were carried out using 300-ns time delay with a grid voltage of 92% of full accelerating voltage and linear mode detection. The mass spectra were mass assigned using external calibration. The molecules were run in sinapinic acid solubilized in a mixture of water/acetonitrile (7:3) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Groups of 10–12 out-bred guinea pigs (Hartley), weighing between 250 and 300 g at the beginning of experiments, were immunized intradermally with a single injection of 107living bacteria (BCG) in 0.2 ml of saline solution. One to six months after immunization, the guinea pigs were checked for their DTH reactivity. The DTH reactions were performed on the flanks of guinea pigs plucked the day before. Four different intradermal injections were performed on each flank. A standard PPD dose (0.25 μg corresponding to 10 tuberculin units (TU)) in 0.1 ml of PBS solution containing Tween 80 (0.05%) was injected intradermally in one site in order to measure the DTH reactivity level of each guinea pig toward an internal control. Dilutions of native proteins purified from M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, or BCG, or recombinant proteins purified fromM. smegmatis::apa or E. coli::apa in 0.1 ml of the saline/Tween solution were injected in the other sites. The areas of induration were measured 24 h later by two independent readers who measured 2 traverse diameters of induration. For each tested material a curve was drawn using classical regression analysis and compared with standard PPD values allowing conversion of the results into conventional TU/mg. Four to five weeks after their immunization with living BCG, guinea pigs were euthanized by carbon dioxide breathing. The lymph nodes draining the sites of BCG injection were collected. Dissociated cells were adjusted at 107 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 (Seromed), supplemented with glutamine, β2-mercaptoethanol (5 × 10−5m) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. A volume of cell suspension (50 μl) was added to 50 μl of culture medium containing crude culture filtrate, native purified Apa, recombinant purified Apa, or control medium alone, in flat-bottom microwell plates (Corning). Plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified air/CO2 incubator during 3 days, and 10 μl of [3H]thymidine solution in RPMI at 50 μCi/ml were added for an overnight period. The labeled cells were harvested onto glass fiber filters for liquid scintillation counting. Results were expressed as mean counts per minute from triplicate culture wells (mean ± 2 S.D.). Mycobacterial Apa from culture filtrates was purified to homogeneity by conventional chromatography (Fig.1). Gel permeation chromatography was used as the first step. Individual fractions were extensively washed, concentrated on a PM-10 membrane and freeze-dried. SDS-PAGE followed by transfer onto PVDF, allowed identification of antigen in each fraction by staining PVDF sheet with antibodies. The concentration of antigen in each fraction was also determined by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The second peak absorbing at 220 nm in Fig.1 A and containing Apa was retained for the next step. Ion exchange chromatography identified three major fractions absorbing at 220 nm (Fig. 1 B). Each fraction was extensively washed, concentrated on a PM-10 membrane, freeze-dried, and subsequently tested. The first fraction, containing Apa, exhibited two bands which interacted with rabbit anti-Apa antibodies after SDS-PAGE and PVDF sheet staining. Further chromatography of this fraction onto a RP300 C8 column eliminated residual contaminants (Fig. 1 C). One fraction absorbing at 220 nm contained the Apa molecules which appear as a doublet of two bands at 45 and 47 kDa, without other contaminating molecules as determined by comparison of twin PVDF sheets stained with AuroDye or with antibodies (Fig.2, lanes 1).Figure 2SDS-PAGE (12%) analysis of purified Apa molecules. The purified samples were analyzed on twin SDS-PAGE, then transferred onto PVDF sheets for staining with Aurodye* (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (A), or with a monoclonal antibody (I10–0.3) (B).

The molecular markers (arrows) are indicated on the left side of each gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The same protocol was used to purify the native antigen from the culture filtrates of M. bovis or BCG. Chromatographic profiles were very similar with those obtained with M. tuberculosis (data not shown). The proteins were analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE and staining with AuroDye or antibodies after transfer on PVDF sheets (Fig. 2 lanes 1–3). Amino acid composition analysis and NH2-terminal sequence (DPEPAPPVPT) confirmed the identity of each sample. No contaminating sequences were found in the samples purified from M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, or BCG culture filtrates. Recombinant molecules from M. smegmatis expressing theapa gene were purified by the methodology used for culture filtrates of M. tuberculosis complex (data not shown). SDS-PAGE analysis, immunoblotting, and the amino acid composition analysis showed that the recombinant proteins were similar to the species isolated from culture filtrates (Fig. 2, lanes 4). However, the NH2-terminal sequence showed two species. The major one (65% of total) was identical to that of the native protein (DPEPAPPVPT). The minor sequence (35% of total) missed the first Asp residue (PEPAPPVPTT). Like in M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, or BCG the products of the single copy apa gene were found as two bands at 45 and 47 kDa. The slight difference observed in the migration of the 47-kDa molecules could be related to the difference in glycosylation pattern (see “Mass Spectrum Analysis”). The recombinant antigen was also expressed in E. coli M15 (pREP4) strain as a fusion protein containing the Gly-Ser-Arg-Ser-His6 decapeptide at its COOH-terminal end, as a tag for affinity purification. The fusion protein was separated from most contaminants on a Ni-NTA column. Some minor contaminants, i.e. a band at 30 kDa, were observed on PVDF sheet after SDS-PAGE of the imidazole eluate. Ion exchange chromatography (SourceTM 15Q Pharmacia) with NaCl gradient removed contaminating proteins and a single band of Apa was detected on PVDF sheet with AuroDye (Fig. 2, lane 5). Only the 47-kDa band was obtained, stained with the monoclonal antibody I10–0.3 (12Horn C. Pescher P. Romain F. Marchal G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 197: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The 45-kDa molecules were present in the periplasmic crude extract. Their absence after the Ni-NTA affinity step was related to the loss of the COOH-terminal part, including the hexahistidine tag. The presence of the tag did not affect the relative mobility of the protein in SDS-PAGE as might be expected for molecules with a percentage of proline under 5–7% (Fig. 2). The amino acid composition of the recombinant protein expressed inE. coli was in agreement with that deduced from the nucleotide sequence, which also included one Gly, one Arg, two Ser, and six His residues belonging to the tag. The NH2-terminal sequence identified two species in equivalent quantities, namely DPEPAPPV and NADPEPAPPV. The origin of the two amino acids (Asn and Ala) at the NH2 terminus of the second sequence was related to the presence of a second consensus site (ATA) recognized by the signal peptidase of E. coli (TableI).Table ISequence of Apa moleculesMHQVDPNLTRRKGRLAALAIAAMASASLVTVAVPATANADPEPAPPVPTTAASPPSTAAAPPAPATPVAPPPPAAANTPNAQPGDPNAAPPPADPNAPPPPVIAPNAPQPVRIDNPVGGFSFALPAGWVESDAAH(F/L)DYGSALLSKTTGDPPFPGQPPPVANDTRIVLGRLDQKLYASAEATDSKAAARLGSDMGEFYMPYPGTRINQETVSLDANGVSGSASYYEVKFSDPSKPNGQIWTGVIGSPAANAPDAGPPQRWFVVWLGTANNPVDKGAAKALAESIRPLVAPPPAPAPAPAEPAPAPAPAGEVAPTPTTPTPQRTLPAGSRSHHHHHHThe signal peptide is indicated in italic.

The purified antigens from M. tuberculosis complex and M. smegmatis::apa were analyzed for sugar composition. A 20-μg sample hydrolyzed with 4 mtrifluoroacetic acid was loaded onto a Carbo Pack PA1 column and eluted with a 10 mm NaOH solution. The concentration of eluted monosaccharides was determined with known references injected with the sample under analysis in parallel runs (TableII).Table IISugar content (mole of monosaccharide/mole of protein) of purified Apa obtained from M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, BCG, or recombinant M. smegmatis::apaSource of ApaMole of monosaccharide/mol of proteinMannoseArabinoseTotalM. tuberculosis9.95 ± 1.604.45 ± 0.3014.40 ± 1.80M. bovis (AN5)7.90 ± 1.100.29 ± 0.028.20 ± 1.20M. bovis(BCG)6.0 ± 1.000.99 ± 0.056.99 ± 1.1M. smegmatis::apa8.65 ± 1.200.51 ± 0.029.16 ± 0.12 Open table in a new tab The Apa purified from the different strains of M. tuberculosis complex were analyzed by ESI-MS giving similar mass spectra (Fig. 3). Mass peaks have been easily assigned assuming that the mass of the unglycosylated protein from M. tuberculosis was 28780 Da and that mannose and arabinose were the only sugars detected during chemical analysis. The purified Apa complexes were mixtures of 10 species from unglycosylated protein to that containing 9 hexose residues covalently bound (molecular mass/mannose unit is 162 Da). No peak indicating a linkage between the protein and arabinose residues was found. If the height of each molecular peak is related to its relative abundance the most frequent molecular species for the native antigen is that containing 7 mannose residues. The difference in molecular masses (34 Da) betweenM. tuberculosis and M. bovis or BCG (Fig. 3) results from the presence of a Phe97 in the M. tuberculosis protein instead of a Leu residue in BCG. The M. tuberculosis Apa glycoprotein structure and their glycoforms were supported by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis. The mass spectrum (Fig. 4) shows three sets of peaks in the mass range between 15 and 60 kDa assigned to double and single charged monomeric and dimeric molecular ions of the 45- and 47-kDa Apa proteins. The analysis of the double (Fig. 4 A) and single charged (Fig. 4 B) of the 47-kDa molecular ions has revealed the presence of 9 glycoforms which differ by one hexose residue.

In the first step, the aminobutyl moiety of the polyamine spermidine is transferred by deoxyhypusine synthase (EC 1.1.1.249) in an NAD+-dependent reaction to the ε-amino group of a specific lysine residue in the eIF5A precursor protein to form deoxyhypusine. In the second step, deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (EC1.14.99.29) catalyzes the hydroxylation of the deoxyhypusine residue to hypusine. Activated eIF5A is the only protein in which the unusual amino acid hypusine has been detected to date (3Cooper H.L. Park M.H. Folk J.E. Safer B. Braverman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Microbiol. 1990; 13: 112-116Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Its amino acid sequence is highly conserved, and the 12 amino acids surrounding the hypusine residue are identical in all eukaryotes studied. Although known for nearly 2 decades, the function of eIF5A is still obscure. Because of its in vitro activity in stimulating methionyl puromycin synthesis (9Kemper W.M. Berry K.W. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5551-5557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), eIF5A was classified as a protein synthesis initiation factor, though subsequent doubts have arisen as to whether initiation of protein synthesis is a major function of this protein (2Park M.H. Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Using a yeast mutant, it was shown that depletion of eIF5A causes an immediate inhibition of cell growth but only a moderate inhibition (30%) of total protein synthesis (10Kang H.A. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3934-3940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is convincing evidence that post-translational hypusine synthesis is required for eIF5A activity and, as a consequence, for eukaryotic cell proliferation. Moreover, it confirms an essential function of spermidine.Deoxyhypusine synthase has been purified from different eukaryotic species (rat testis (11Wolff E.C. Lee Y.B. Chung S.I. Folk J.E. Park M.H.

Witte L. Pelletier S.W. Alkaloids: Chemical and Biological Perspectives. 9. Pergamon Press, Oxford1995: 155-233Google Scholar), we characterized an enzyme whose biochemical and molecular properties greatly resemble those of deoxyhypusine synthase. This enzyme, homospermidine synthase, catalyzes in an NAD+-dependent reaction the transfer of the aminobutyl moiety of spermidine to a primary amino group of putrescine (25Böttcher F. Adolph R.D.

Using primer P4 and the oligo(dT)17primer (each 0.4 μm), the 3′ end cDNA fragment was amplified using the initially produced oligo(dT)-primed cDNA. For the amplification of the 5′ end cDNA fragment, the reverse transcription was performed as described previously but with primer P5. This cDNA was tailed with oligo(dC) and amplified using the rapid amplification of 5′ cDNA ends system (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the primers P6 and P7. The resulting PCR fragments were electrophoretically purified and subcloned using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen).Amplification of Full-length Tobacco Deoxyhypusine Synthase cDNATwo gene-specific primers were generated (Table I), which contained restriction sites for subcloning in addition to the initiation codon (P8 (NdeI)) and the stop codon (P9 (BamHI)).

Ampicillin-resistant transformants were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin for approximately 20 h at 25 °C and, after induction with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, for another 12 h. The harvested cells were frozen at −80 °C, then suspended in purification buffer (50 mm KH2PO4, pH 9.0, 2 mm dithioerythritol, 0.5 mmNAD+, 0.1 mm EDTA) and broken by sonication.Purification of Recombinant Tobacco Deoxyhypusine SynthaseThe supernatant of the sonified cells was applied to a 2.5 × 5.0-cm DEAE-Fractogel column (Merck, Darmstadt) and eluted with a 40-ml linear gradient of 0–0.25 m NaCl in purification buffer at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fractions of 4.0 ml were collected. Fractions containing enzyme activity were pooled, adjusted to a NaCl concentration of 1.5 m, and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1.6 × 12 cm). For elution in 10-ml fractions, a 120-ml linear gradient of 0.6–0 m NaCl in purification buffer that did contain only 5 mm KH2PO4 was used (flow rate 2 ml/min). Enzyme activity eluted with approximately 0 m NaCl and was applied on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Elution was performed using a 50-ml linear gradient of 0–0.5m NaCl with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 2 ml were collected. For determination of the molecular mass of the native protein, 100 μl of the purified enzyme were applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. Fractions of 0.25 ml were collected and assayed for deoxyhypusine synthase activity. The absorbance was monitored continuously at 280 nm.DNA Sequence AnalysisDNA fragments and full-length clones were sequenced using the fluorescence dye terminator technology on ABI Prism sequencers (SeqLab, Göttingen, Germany). The sequences of the fragments obtained by amplification using the degenerated primers and of the 3′ end and 5′ end fragments were verified by sequencing the pETntDHS plasmid, which was amplified independently using the oligo(T) cDNA as template. DNA sequences were analyzed using the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package (version 8, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI).Amplification, Expression, and Purification of Tobacco eIF5A Precursor ProteinUsing sequence information from the eIF5A precursor protein cDNA of N. tabacum (22Chamot D. Kuhlemeier C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), two gene-specific primers, P10 (NdeI) and P11 (XhoI), were generated (Table I). Amplification of the full-length eIF5A precursor protein cDNA was performed using the oligo(T) cDNA as template and Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega). The resulting 494-bp fragment was electrophoretically purified, NdeI/XhoI-digested and ligated intoNdeI/XhoI-linearized pET-23b vector (Novagen), which contains a C-terminal His tag for metal chelate-affinity chromatography. The ligation constructs were transformed into XL1-blue cells (Stratagene), screened with primers P10 and P11 for the correct insert, and purified for sequencing and for transformation of E. coli BL21(DE3) (Stratagene). Resulting transformants were cultured at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin overnight, transferred to fresh medium for an additional 1 h, and then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside and grown for another 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 0.3m NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm imidazole), and sonicated for 5 min. From the supernatant, the His-tagged protein (eifnt) was purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Deoxyhypusine Synthase AssayThe standard 50-μl assay contained 0.1 m glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 9.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40 μm [14C]spermidine (0.06 μCi/assay), 40 μm eifnt precursor protein, 1 mmNAD+, and enzyme. Assays were incubated for 1–60 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of 1 mpotassium phosphate, pH 6.3, with 60 mm spermidine before they were adsorbed to a Whatman no. 3MM paper disc and developed as described elsewhere (14Sasaki K. Abid M.R. Miyazaki M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). If the reaction was stopped at different times for kinetic purposes, the reaction volume was scaled up according to the number of samplings.Homospermidine Synthase AssayStandard assays contained 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40 μm [1,4-14C]putrescine (0.06 μCi/assay), 40 μm spermidine, 1 mm NAD+, and enzyme in 50 μl of 0.1 m glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 9.5. Incubations were done for 1–60 min at 30 °C. Formation of labeled homospermidine was followed quantitatively by radio-TLC or high performance liquid radiochromatography as described previously (25Böttcher F. Adolph R.D. Hartmann T. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 679-689Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Identification of Deoxyhypusine and sym-Homospermidine as Products of the Deoxyhypusine Synthase ReactionReaction mixtures of 1 ml containing spermidine, eifnt (40 μm each), 0.5 mm NAD+, and 25 μg of deoxyhypusine synthase were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. Using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), the unmodified and modified eifnt protein was recovered and hydrolyzed under nitrogen in 6 n HCl at 120 °C for 24 h. Deoxyhypusine was purified using Amberlite CG120 II resin (32Bartig D. Klink F. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 606: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), evaporated to dryness, and derivatized according to Ref. 33Kaiser F.E. Gehrke C.W. Zumwalt R.W. Kuo K.C. J.

The amino groups were derivatized with 3-fluoroacetic acid. GC-MS was performed using a Carlo Erba 5160 gas chromatograph equipped with a 30 m × 0.32-mm fused silica column (DB-1) under the following conditions: injector, 250 °C; split-ratio, 1:20; carrier gas, helium 0.75 bar. The capillary column was directly coupled to a Finnigan MAT 4515 quadrupole mass spectrometer. Electron impact-mass spectra were recorded at 40 eV. For identification ofsym-homospermidine, an aliquot of the enzymatic reaction that contained 40 μm putrescine instead of eifnt was derivatized with methyl chloroformate medium (34Husek P. Huang Z.H. Sweely C.C. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1992; 259: 185-192Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and analyzed by GC-MS.RESULTSCloning and Identification of Tobacco DHSReasoning that the amino acid sequence of plant deoxyhypusine synthase would be similarly conserved as its homologues from other sources, an alignment of deoxyhypusine synthase amino acid sequences from human, yeast, N. crassa, and the archaebacterium M. jannaschii (Fig.1) was used to design and construct the degenerate primers P1–P3 (Fig. 2). With the primer pair P1-P3, a 560 bp fragment could be amplified by reverse transcription-PCR with RNA isolated from a young leaf of N. tabacum. The fragment contained an open reading frame that showed high sequence similarity to deoxyhypusine synthases from other sources. This sequence information was used to generate a gene-specific forward primer (P4) for the amplification of the 3′ end cDNA of the putative deoxyhypusine synthase. The amplification of the cDNA with the primer P4 and the oligo(dT)17 primer resulted in a 900-bp fragment that overlapped with the 3′ end of the 560-bp fragment. To obtain the missing 5′ region of the cDNA by rapid amplification of 5′ cDNA ends, we generated three gene-specific reverse primers, P5, P6, and P7, which were used for the reverse transcription of total tobacco RNA and amplification of the resulting oligo(dC)-tailed cDNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). The resulting 580-bp fragment contained the oligo(dC) tail, a non-coding region of 17 bases, the translation initiation codon, and sequence overlap with the 5′ end of the 560-bp fragment.Figure 2Design of degenerated primers. Figure shows amino acid sequences (boldface letters) and the derived nucleic acid sequence (uppercase letters) that were used for the design of degenerated primers.

This fragment was subcloned into pET-3a vector, sequenced, and used for overexpression of tobacco deoxyhypusine synthase in E. coli BL21(DE3).Sequence Analysis of Deoxyhypusine Synthase cDNAFig.3 shows the complete cDNA sequence of tobacco deoxyhypusine synthase, established from the overlapping DNA-fragments amplified from cDNA, which is identical to that of the subcloned amplification product encoding full-length tobacco deoxyhypusine synthase. It encodes a protein of 379 amino acids with a molecular mass of 42,074 Da and 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of 17 and 383 bp, respectively. The overall amino acid sequence identity between the tobacco deoxyhypusine synthase and the human, yeast, N. crassa, and in M. jannaschii enzymes are 62%, 56%, 61%, and 47%, respectively. Homology is lower at the N terminus than in the other parts of the sequence (Fig. 1). Thus, the first 96 amino acids from the N terminus of the tobacco deoxyhypusine cDNA show only 37% identity to the sequence of human deoxyhypusine synthase. In comparison to the amino acid sequences of the other deoxyhypusine synthases, the tobacco enzyme contains an additional stretch of 9 amino acids (residues 251–259) in an otherwise conserved region.Figure 3Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of tobacco deoxyhypusine synthase (single-letter amino acid code).

In SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the resulting protein showed a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 42.7 kDa (Fig.4). This enzyme preparation was used for all further studies concerning the substrate specificity of the plant enzyme. The molecular mass of the native deoxyhypusine synthase was determined to be approximately 190 kDa by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (data not shown), suggesting that plant deoxyhypusine synthase, like the enzymes from the other sources, is a homotetramer.Figure 4Expression and purification of recombinant tobacco deoxyhypusine synthase.

Using the known sequence (22Chamot D. Kuhlemeier C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the precursor protein of tobacco was cloned into pET-23b and expressed in E. coli with an additional 6xHis tag at the C terminus. Sequence comparison of this clone (named eifnt) with the literature showed one synonymous nucleotide substitution at position 60 (T instead of C). Chemical identity of the reaction products of deoxyhypusine synthase as deoxyhypusine, homospermidine, and diaminopropane were confirmed by GC-MS. The mass spectrum of deoxyhypusine is shown in Fig.5. To prove the specific labeling of the eIF5A precursor protein by deoxyhypusine synthase, a time-course experiment was performed in which enzyme assays containing14C-labeled spermidine were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Intrinsic properties of the underlying DNA sequence, such as flexibility and intrinsic bending, direct the formation of nucleosomes. We have earlier identified genomic nucleosome-positioning sequences with increased in vitroability for nucleosome formation. One group of sequences bearing a 10-base pair consensus repeat sequence of TATAAACGCC had the highest reported nucleosome affinity from genomic material. Here, we report the intrinsic physical properties of this sequence and the structural details of the nucleosome it forms, as analyzed by footprinting techniques. The minor groove is buried toward the histone octamer at the AA steps and facing outwards at the CC steps. By cyclization kinetics, the overall helical repeat of the free DNA sequence was found to be 10.5 base pairs/turn. Our experiments also showed that this sequence is highly flexible, having a J-factor 25-fold higher than that of random sequence DNA. In addition, the data suggest that twist flexibility is an important determinant for translational nucleosome positioning, particularly over the dyad region.

The histone proteins have been highly conserved through evolution and are designed to bind to virtually any DNA sequence within the nucleus. There are, however, several known sequences that show a considerably higher ability to bind the histone octamer compared with bulk DNA.About 90% of the DNA in an eukaryotic cell is complexed with histones to form chromatin fibers. This represents a tremendous obstacle to transcription, replication, and repair machinery that requires access to these DNA regions (1Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1994; 8: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The location of a nucleosome on the DNA sequence is determined by several factors. At the primary level of compaction, the DNA sequence itself is responsible for determining whether or not a nucleosome is positioned due to inherent intrinsic mechanical properties. In vivo, secondary effects, such as the interaction of DNA with non-histone proteins and other ligands, and boundary effects can determine the basic and higher order positioning of nucleosomes in chromatin (2Simpson R.T. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 143-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).Several DNA sequence motifs have been studied in an effort to determine the organization of nucleosome-positioning signals at the level of primary DNA sequence. Travers and co-workers (3Satchwell S.C. Drew H.R. Travers A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 659-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar) investigated the sequence properties of the DNA in a library of nucleosomal DNA from chicken erythrocytes. They found that AA/TT dinucleotides were present where the minor groove was compressed and facing inward toward the histone octamer. Conversely, CG/CC dinucleotides were located where the minor groove was wider and facing outwards. These dinucleotides also showed a preferential distribution of 10–11-bp periodicity, indicating the importance of anisotropic DNA bendability in nucleosome positioning (4Drew H.R. Travers A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 773-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Highly flexible poly(A-T) DNA has been shown to incorporate into nucleosomes more readily than bulk DNA (5Rhodes D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 1805-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This and other work suggest that DNA in the nucleosome is under torsional stress, and consequently, more flexible sequences would be favored to position nucleosomes.Based on these experimental data, an artificial nucleosome-positioning sequence, denoted TG, was constructed (6Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7418-7422Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). This motif contains a 5′-(A/T)3NN(G/C)3NN-3′ sequence repeated 10 times in the TG-5 sequence. TG-5 showed high affinity for binding the histone octamer in vitro, but failed to position a nucleosome in vivo (7Tanaka S. Zatchej M. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1187-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Patterton H.-G. Simpson R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4170-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These results suggest that anisotropic bendability that allows strong rotational positioning is not sufficient to position nucleosomes in vivo.Widom and coworkers (9 and 10) advocate that nucleosome positioning is not a precise mechanism, but rather a thermodynamic equilibrium system. Since nucleosomes are dynamic entities formed under equilibrium conditions, there is always a statistical opportunity that every possible site is occupied at one time or another. However, some sites are preferred over the others as the system evolves toward a minimum in free energy. Occupancy of these sites would be expected to follow a Boltzmann distribution. In an in vitro system, it is possible to create conditions in which no other factors are present that are capable of affecting the free energy of the system. In cells, of course, there are a number of such factors that either passively (DNA secondary structures and DNA-binding proteins) or actively (SWI-SNF, CHRAC, and NURF) redistribute the nucleosomes to various degrees (11Weintraub H. Cell. 1983; 32: 1191-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 12Imbalzano A.N. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 225-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).In a previous study, we selected DNA sequences that form stable nucleosome core particles in vitro from a large pool of mouse genomic nucleosomal DNA (13Widlund H.R. Cao H. Simonsson S. Magnusson E. Simonsson T. Nielsen P.E. Kahn J.D. Crothers D.M. Kubista M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We found that repeats of a 10-bp consensus sequence (5′-TATAAACGCC-3′) had the highest affinity for binding histone octamers (Fig. 1). This motif also contains alternating A/T- and G/C-rich elements in phase with the helical repeat, much like the artificial TG pentamer. It is therefore of particular interest to characterize the intrinsic curvature and flexibility of this DNA as well as the structure of the nucleosome core particle assembled on this sequence. In addition to forming exceedingly stable nucleosome core particles with high affinity, this sequence also contains multiple putative binding sites for the high mobility group I/Y protein (14Solomon M.J. Strauss F. Varhavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The nucleosome-positioning properties of this sequence could also have important ramifications for the binding and activity of the high mobility group I/Y protein on sequences bearing this motif in vivo.RESULTSWe previously selected the TATAAACGCC repeat sequence from a mouse genomic library of DNA associated with nucleosome core particles (13Widlund H.R. Cao H. Simonsson S. Magnusson E. Simonsson T. Nielsen P.E. Kahn J.D. Crothers D.M. Kubista M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This 180-bp sequence has a very high affinity for the histone octamer, ∼350-fold higher than random sequence DNA (16Thåström A. Lowary P.T. Widlund H.R. Cao H. Kubista M. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 213-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar).Intrinsic Curvature and Flexibility of the TATAAACGCC Repeat SequenceTo characterize the nucleosome core particle formed on the TATAAACGCC repeat sequence, we first evaluated the DNA sequence for intrinsic curvature and flexibility. Previously, we reported that this sequence displayed a gel migration anomaly of RL= 1.2, indicating moderate intrinsic curvature of the DNA. We conducted further gel migration assays using TBMg buffer (17Dlakic M. Harrington R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29945-29952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) to more closely mimic physiological conditions. This yielded a gel migration anomaly ofRL = 1.3 (data not shown), indicating that the presence of divalent Mg2+ does not significantly alter the intrinsic curvature of the sequence. Sequence-dependent DNA flexibility has been suggested to play an important role in the positioning of nucleosome core particles. Cyclization kinetics is the method of choice for determining the intrinsic flexibility of a given DNA sequence (Ref. 18Shore D. Langowski J. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar and thoroughly described in Ref. 19Crothers D.M. Drak J. Kahn J.D. Levene S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This method analyzes the equilibrium between monomer DNA molecules and either linear dimer DNA molecules or circularized monomer DNA molecules. A comparison of the rate of forming linear dimer DNA versusthe rate of forming circularized monomer DNA yields the probability of ring closure (J-factor). The probability depends on two mechanical properties of the DNA, the torsional flexibility and the writhe.For our cyclization experiments, we have used a set of PCR-generated DNA molecules (with a total length of ∼180 bp) that have cohesive ends and that differ in length in steps of 2–3 bp over a complete turn of duplex DNA (Fig. 2). Fig.3 A displays a native gel on which the products of a typical cyclization reaction were separated. We found that the TATAAACGCC repeat sequence has an overall helical repeat of 10.5 bp/turn as determined by the cyclization maximum (Fig. 3, A and C). This is in accordance with the expected helical repeat for mixed sequence B-DNA.Figure 2Schematic drawing of the different TATAAACGCC repeat constructs used.

To verify the identity of the cyclized monomer product, we recovered the DNA from one gel and tried to cleave it with BglII and BamHI. We did not observe any cleavage, suggesting that band C is the cyclized monomer. B, plot of [C]/[D] for the individual fragments at the sampled time points. C, J-factors, calculated as follows,J=2M0lim t→0 [C][D],(Eq. 1) for a slow proceeding parallel reaction (34Taylor W.H. Hagerman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), whereM0 = 60 nm. The maximum (400 nm) is found at +9 (construct [+2,+7]), and the minimum between +2 and +4. Note the small amplitude of only 300 nm. The average number of base pairs/turn is calculated as the total fragment length at cyclization maximum (179 bp) divided by an integer number of turns, here being 17 as the only appropriate choice. This yields an average of 10.52 bp/turn.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The J-factors for these fragments yield further information regarding the flexibility of the sequence. The high cyclization probability (J-factor = 400 nm, as shown in Fig. 3 C) is indicative of high intrinsic flexibility for this sequence. This is ∼25-fold higher than the J-factor for mixed sequence DNA of the same length (20Bacolla A. Gellibolian R. Shimizu M. Amirhaeri S. Kang S. Ohshima K. Larson J.E. Harvey S.C. Stollar B.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16783-16792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Moreover, the small amplitude of 300 nm in the J-factor over one helical turn (Fig. 3 C) also suggests that the TATAAACGCC repeat sequence is prone to twist flexibility. This could play a very important role in positioning the sequence with a helical twist of 10.5 bp/turn in a nucleosome core particle, where the average helical twist is 10.2 bp/turn (21Hayes J.J.

This method is well suited for characterizing the translational and rotational positioning of the DNA in the core particle. The location of the pseudodyad axis of the nucleosome, as well as the positioning of the minor groove with respect to the histone octamer at any given point in the sequence, can readily be determined by hydroxyl radical footprinting (21Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7405-7409Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar).Figure 4Nucleosome reconstitution on the TATAAACGCC repeat sequence.

This sequence is capable of positioning a nucleosome core particle with a predominantly unique translational position. The DNA pseudodyad axis of symmetry is easily identified by the altered helical repeat of 10.7 bp/turn for the three helical turns around the histone dyad axis. The rest of the nucleosome core particle has a helical repeat of 10.0 bp/turn. This is in perfect agreement with other well characterized nucleosome core particles with unique transitional positioning (21Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7405-7409Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In addition, the DNA is in a single rotational position about the histone octamer. For the A-rich strand, the AA dinucleotides are positioned where the minor groove faces inward (toward the histone octamer), and the CC dinucleotides are positioned such that the minor groove faces outwards (away from the histone octamer). For the opposite, T-rich strand, the TA dinucleotide steps are located where the minor groove faces inward, and the CG step has the minor groove facing outwards. An offset of 2 bp in the 3′-direction is seen between the two strands, which is typical for minor groove binding. These results are consistent with the expected phasing of A/T- and G/C-rich sequences in the nucleosome core particle (4Drew H.R. Travers A.A. J. Mol.

Furthermore, this rotational setting, with the A/T-rich regions having the minor groove buried toward the histone octamer, restricts the binding of A/T minor groove-recognizing proteins, e.g. the high mobility group I/Y protein (14Solomon M.J. Strauss F. Varhavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Finally, it is also interesting to note that the naked DNA itself shows a cleavage pattern somewhat similar to that of the nucleosome, but less intense, as would be expected for a repeated sequence containing alternating A/T- and G/C-rich regions. Thus, the TATAAACGCC repeat DNA appears to be predisposed to formation of the structure it adopts when complexed with the histone octamer. We have also used MNase footprinting to define the boundaries of the nucleosome and as an independent measure of translational positioning of the core particle. Fig. 6 shows the periodic (every 10 bp) MNase cleavage of the DNA within the central 120 bp of the nucleosome core particle. This periodic cleavage is not observed at the very ends of the nucleosome core particle. This is consistent with the DNA in this region being loosely associated with the histone octamer (21Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7405-7409Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 22Luger K. Mäder A. Richmond R. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6795) Google Scholar). These studies confirm and complement the results of hydroxyl radical footprinting (Fig.7).Figure 5Hydroxyl radical footprinting and densitometric analysis of the dyad region.

Widlund H.R. Cao H. Kubista M. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 213-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Since this is a consensus repeat sequence, we were interested in determining whether the core particle formed with a longer DNA fragment would be positioned over the center of the repeat if flanked by other sequence. We compared the original 180-bp fragment with a longer, 280-bp fragment in translational positioning and overall affinity of binding the histone octamer. Fig. 8 shows the high resolution electrophoretic mobility shift assay for nucleosome core particles reconstituted on the two fragments. Both fragments bind the histone octamer with similar overall affinity (difference Δ(ΔG) = 300 cal/mol as compared with Δ(ΔG) = 4500 cal/mol relative to random sequence DNA). It is evident from Fig. 8 that the longer, 280-bp fragment shows at least six different translational positions in contrast to the predominant single (perhaps two?) translational positions seen for the 180-bp fragment. We have used hydroxyl radical and MNase footprinting to characterize the ensemble of translational positions for the 280-bp fragment. We still found that the dominant translational position is the same as that previously seen for the 180-bp fragment (Fig.9). The ensemble of translational positions also shows the same rotational setting of the DNA about the histone octamer.Figure 8Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of nucleosomes formed on two different length DNA fragments. Shown are the results from the nucleosome reconstitution with the TATAAACGCC repeat sequence. Lane 1, the 280-bp fragment;lane 2, the 183-bp fragment. The affinity (total over all translational positions) for the long fragment is about equal (Δ(ΔG) = 300 cal/mol) to that of the short fragment, as measured by densitometry. In this experiment an additional 1 μg of competitor calf thymus DNA/μl was present.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 9Hydroxyl radical footprinting and densitometry of the nucleosome formed on the 280-bp fragment.

The moderate gel migration anomaly (RL = 1.2–1.3) is probably a reflection of reduced macroscopic curvature caused by the increased flexibility of the DNA fragment. The shorter, 180-bp fragment containing this motif is able to uniquely position a nucleosome core particle as seen by footprinting with hydroxyl radicals and MNase. In the longer, 280-bp fragment, where the central TATAAACGCC repeat is offset by 80 bp with respect to the center of the fragment, we observed multiple translational settings. However, there is a strong preference for the central TATAAACGCC repeat, which is not located at the center of the 280-bp fragment. This goes to further demonstrate the strong nucleosome-positioning properties of this sequence.The TATAAACGCC Repeat Is Highly FlexibleTheJ-factor of 400 nm observed for this sequence compare well with those reported for other highly flexible molecules. Highly flexible sequences, such as CTG and CGG repeats involved in triplet expansion diseases, have J-factors in the range of 200–300 nm (20Bacolla A. Gellibolian R. Shimizu M. Amirhaeri S. Kang S. Ohshima K. Larson J.E. Harvey S.C. Stollar B.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16783-16792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These sequences have also been reported to have high affinity for histone octamers in vitro (13Widlund H.R. Cao H. Simonsson S. Magnusson E. Simonsson T. Nielsen P.E. Kahn J.D. Crothers D.M. Kubista M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 23Wang Y.H. Amirhaeri S. Kang S. Wells R.D. Griffith J.D.

Interestingly, the highly flexible CTG repeat was reported to be favored at the dyad, suggesting that high flexibility, especially in twist, is essential for nucleosome positioning over that region (25Godde J.S. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15222-15229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This can explain the multiple translational positions that we observed for the longer, 280-bp fragment. On this longer fragment, the DNA is able to occupy multiple positions because it is able to adjust the pseudodyad twist at multiple positions.The artificial TG-5 nucleosome-positioning sequence failed to position a nucleosome in vivo (7Tanaka S. Zatchej M. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1187-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This was later reinvestigated using a modified version of TG-5 containing an extra base pair in the center to accommodate the constraints at the dyad (8Patterton H.-G. Simpson R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4170-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, in retrospect, this sequence did not position a nucleosome in vivo because the additional base pair could only partially satisfy the need for overwinding at the dyad axis. Hydroxyl radical footprinting of several nucleosome core particles has shown a distinct overwinding of the DNA to 10.7 bp/turn over the three helical turns at the dyad axis (21Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7405-7409Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The high resolution x-ray crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle also indicated large differences in helical twist over the entire length of nucleosomal DNA (22Luger K. Mäder A. Richmond R. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6795) Google Scholar). In addition, the DNA is severely distorted at ±1.5 helical turns from the dyad axis (22Luger K. Mäder A. Richmond R. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6795) Google Scholar), and particularly this site is predominantly cleaved by the enediyne calicheaminicin γ1I(26Kuduvalli P.N. Townsend C.A. Tullius T.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3899-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This further demonstrates that the DNA around the dyad is overwound and structurally deformed; and therefore, DNA molecules capable of adjusting to these nucleosomal restraints are preferred. Consequently, the CTG and TATAAACGCC repeats would both rank as excellent potential candidates for nucleosome positioning in vivo due to the high degree of twist flexibility allowed for in these sequences.The TATAAACGCC Motif Contains Elements Necessary for a Nucleosome-positioning SequenceIf one were to construct a nucleosome-positioning sequence based on all the information available from studies of naturally occurring and artificial nucleosomal sequences, the TATAAACGCC repeat would certainly qualify as a very good candidate for this purpose. Statistical sequencing of nucleosomal DNA from chicken erythrocytes by Travers and co-workers (4Drew H.R. Travers A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 773-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) and various data base analyses have shown the importance of phased AA and GG dinucleotides to allow bending of the DNA in the nucleosome. Evidence from footprinting studies and x-ray crystallography have indicated the requirement for overwinding, and hence twist flexibility, in the dyad region (21Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7405-"
https://openalex.org/W2084086218,"Alkylation treatment of HeLa cells results in the rapid induction of apoptosis as revealed by DNA laddering and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) into the 29-and 85-kDa fragments (Kumari S. R., Mendoza-Alvarez, H. & Alvarez-Gonzalez, R. (1998)Cancer Res. 58, 5075–5078). Here, we performed a time-course analysis of (i) poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis and degradation as well as (ii) the subnuclear localization of PARP and its fragments by using confocal laser scanning immunofluorescence microscopy. PARP was activated within 15 min post-treatment, as revealed by nuclear immunostaining with antibody 10H (recognizing poly(ADP-ribose)). This was followed by a late, time-dependent, progressive decline of 10H signals that coincide with the time of PARP cleavage. Strikingly, nucleolar immunostaining with antibodies 10H and C-II-10 (recognizing the 85-kDa PARP fragment) was lost by 15 min post-treatment, whereas F-I-23 signals (recognizing the 29-kDa fragment) persisted. We hypothesize that the 85-kDa PARP fragment is translocated, along with covalently bound poly(ADP-ribose), from nucleoli to the nucleoplasm, whereas the 29-kDa fragment is retained, because it binds to DNA strand breaks. Our data (i) provide a link between the known time-dependent bifunctional role of PARP in apoptosis and the subcellular localization of PARP fragments and also (ii) add to the evidence for early proteolytic changes in nucleoli during apoptosis.

Higher eucaryotic organisms have developed a sophisticated signaling system to eliminate nonfunctional cells in a highly coordinated sequence of “suicidal” events. This tightly regulated process is known as “programmed cell death” or “apoptosis” (1Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar, 2Steller H. Science. 1996; 275: 1445-1449Google Scholar, 3Depraetere V. Golstein P. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Superfluous cell populations that undergo apoptosis include genetically damaged and/or aging cells. The death program is executed in three chronologically distinct phases (4Samejima K. Tone S. Kottk T.J. Enari M. Sakahira H. Cooke C.A. Durrieu F. Martins L.M. Nagata S. Kauffman S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). First to occur is “the condemned phase” where a fully reversible sequence of metabolic and cell cycle adaptation(s) take place with mitochondrial components, such as cytochrome c and the bcl-2 gene produced, playing a decisive role. The second phase of “commitment” is irreversible and derives from unleashing a cascade of proteolytic signals emanating from the mitochondrion to the nucleus. Finally, the “execution phase” of apoptosis is manifested by the macromolecular degradation of chromosomal DNA catalyzed by caspase (cysteine-aspartase)-activated death-factor (5Enari H. Sakahira M. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar, 6Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). In this phase, key nuclear proteins are degraded by caspase-3, the main “executioner” of nuclear disassembly (7Jänicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar), and this leads to the disintegration of the nucleus. One of the primary targets for caspase-3 is poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) 1The abbreviations used are:PARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseMNNGN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidinecaspasecysteine-dependent aspartasePBSphosphate-buffered salineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanatePARGpoly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (E.C. 2.4.2.30) (8Kauffman S.H.

Res. 1998; 150: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PARP is a nuclear DNA-binding protein of 1,014 amino acid residues (113 kDa) (11De Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 172-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 12Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Schweiger M. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 131: 4135-4137Google Scholar) that is constitutively expressed in eucaryotes and comprises up to 1% of the total nuclear protein. This enzyme displays a multimodular domain structure that can be dissected into three functionally distinct domains from the amino terminus to the carboxyl terminus (13Kameshita I. Matsuda Z. Taniguchi T. Shizuta Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4770-4776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first module is the “DNA-binding domain” (DBD), a fragment of 46-kDa that contains two zinc fingers, which mediate binding to DNA strands breaks as well as a bipartite nuclear localization signal (14Schreiber V. Molinete M. Boeuf H. de Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The two karyophilic regions of the nuclear localization signal are separated by the DEVD sequence that is cleaved by caspase-3 during apoptosis, resulting in the formation of two proteolytic fragments of PARP, a 29-kDa amino terminus, and an 85-kDa carboxyl terminus. The carboxyl-terminally located 54-kDa domain of PARP represents the NAD+-binding domain with the characteristic “PARP signature,” a highly conserved sequence comprising the catalytically crucial amino acid residue Glu-988 (15Marsischky G.T Wilson B.A. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3247-3254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of PARP is dramatically stimulated by noncovalent contact of the DNA-binding domain with DNA strand breaks and results in the post-translational modification of various “acceptor” proteins, including PARP itself, with poly(ADP-ribose). Finally, in between the DNA-binding domain and the NAD+-binding domain, there is also a 22-kDa “automodification domain” (16Buki K.G. Bauer P.I. Hakam A. Kun E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3370-3377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Müller S. Mennesier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell.

J. 1997; 324: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) of PARP with other chromatin proteins. Recently, a substantial effort has been invested to elucidate the physiological function of the protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation pathway in cellular recovery from DNA damage (11De Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 172-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 20Shall S. Adv. Radiat.

Gerontol. 1998; 33: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In general, it appears that an early enzymatic activation of PARP occurs upon DNA-strand break formation (23Benjamin R.C. Gill D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10502-10508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Durkacz B.W. Omidiji D. Gray D.A. Shall S. Nature. 1980; 283: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). However, when the genetic damage cannot be repaired, the cell decides to trigger apoptosis, which leads to the proteolytic cleavage of PARP (8Kauffman S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lazebnik Y.A. Kauffmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C.

Res. 1998; 150: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These opposite roles played by PARP create a functional paradox where protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (11, 20–22)appears to play an initial “protective role” by facilitating DNA base excision repair (25Althaus F.R. Hikson J. Base Excision Repair of DNA Damage. Springer/Landes Bioscience, Austin, Texas1997: 169-181Google Scholar), although also becoming a pivotal protein target for caspase-3 during apoptotic execution (8Kauffman S.H. Desnoyers S.

To shed light on the biochemical function of PARP in the different stages of apoptosis, we have now performed a detailed time-course study of poly(ADP-ribose) metabolism in HeLa cells as PARP goes from initial enzymatic activation to caspase-3 catalyzed cleavage and concomitant poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) activation following MNNG treatment. By integrating these data with our previous biochemical characterization of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP in MNNG-treated cells (26Kumari S.R. Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5075-5078PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kumari S.R. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Invest. 2000; 18 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we derive a provocative, yet plausible explanation for the bifunctional role of PARP in the chronology of apoptosis. poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine cysteine-dependent aspartase phosphate-buffered saline fluorescein isothiocyanate poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase HeLa cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's minimal Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). MNNG (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) was dissolved in PBS (10 mm solution) and added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 50 μm. Cells were incubated at 37 °C following addition of MNNG and were harvested at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min and in some experiments, 2.5 and 3 h after treatment. Nonconfluent HeLa cell cultures were grown on coverslips for 48–72 h, exposed to 50 μm MNNG for the times indicated above, and fixed for 10 min in ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (28Bürkle A. Chen G. Küpper J.H. Grube K. Zeller W.J. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). After washes in 70, 90, and 96% ethanol, cells were air dried, rehydrated in PBS, and incubated with 5 μg/ml monoclonal antibody 10H (kind gift of M. Miwa and T. Sugimura, Tokyo, Japan) diluted in PBS, 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20 for 30 min at 37 °C. This antibody is specifically directed against poly(ADP-ribose) (29Kawamitsu H. Hoshino H. Okada H. Miwa M. Momoi H. Sugimura T. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3771-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The coverslips were washed 4 times for 5 min each in PBS and subsequently incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:50 in PBS, 5% nondry fat milk, 0.05% Tween 20) for 30 min at 37 °C. After 4 washes in PBS (5 min each) the slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) containing 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and viewed with either a Leica epifluorescent microscope or a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (vide infra). Similar procedures were used with mouse monoclonal antibodies F-I-23 and C-II-10 (kind gift of G. G. Poirier, Quebec, Canada), except that cells were fixed in 5% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, followed by permeabilization in 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS and rinsing in PBS. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 UV confocal laser scanning microscope (Jena, Germany). For fluorescence excitation, an argon ion laser with 488-nm wavelength and an appropriate combination of beam splitter and barrier filter were used. The images were simultaneously taken in the fluorescence confocal mode (depth of focus 700 nm) as well as in the transmitted light mode of the instrument using differential interference contrast according to Nomarski. It should be noted that hundreds of cells were visualized under the confocal microscope for each condition with identical morphology. However, only a small number of cells from three independent experiments were selected to illustrate the results shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4. The dose-dependent accumulation of poly(ADP-ribose) in the nucleus of DNA-damaged cells has previously been visualized as granular immunofluorescence (28Bürkle A. Chen G. Küpper J.H. Grube K. Zeller W.J. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) generated with the antibody 10H, a monoclonal immunoglobulin highly specific for ADP-ribose polymers (29Kawamitsu H. Hoshino H. Okada H. Miwa M. Momoi H. Sugimura T. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3771-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Here, we have followed the time-dependent subnuclear distribution of ADP-ribose polymers synthesized in HeLa cells in response to treatment with the alkylating agent MNNG as well as of PARP and its proteolytic fragments by epifluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Fig. 1 displays the immunofluorescent signal generated with antibody 10H after 15 min of alkylating damage. Fig. 1, top left corner, shows the fluorescent signal generated in conjunction with the FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. The top right corner in Fig. 1represents the same cell shown in the top left corner, under transmitted confocal light according to Nomarski. Fig. 1, bottom left corner, was generated by superimposing the two images described above. This latter presentation form of confocal micrographs was the style that we selected to describe all subsequent experiments (vide infra). Fig. 2(panel a) displays the expected absence of poly(ADP-ribose) in control HeLa cells, because PARP is only activated by DNA-strand breaks (23Benjamin R.C. Gill D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10502-10508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) following DNA damage. Panels b, c, andd illustrate the time-dependent increase in the intensity of the immunofluorescent signal in the nucleus, with a maximum level reached after 15 min (panel d), consistent with previously published results (30Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Althaus F.R Mutat. Res. 1989; 218: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We also observed reproducibly that after 15 min of MNNG treatment, nucleoli did not immunostain for poly(ADP-ribose). Therefore, we next proceeded to evaluate the biological significance of the peculiar karyoplasmic localization of ADP-ribose polymers once proteolysis of PARP had begun (26Kumari S.R. Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5075-5078PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2Time-dependent enzymatic activation of PARP and PARG in the nucleoplasm of HeLa cells following exposure to 50 μm MNNG, as detected with antibody 10H. HeLa cells were treated with MNNG for 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min at 37 °C, fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and subsequently processed with antibody 10H. Panels a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, and j, display the immunofluorescence observed under the confocal microscope after 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min of MNNG treatment, respectively.

Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5075-5078PubMed Google Scholar), we also studied poly(ADP-ribose) catabolism, which is catalyzed mostly by PARG in MNNG-treated HeLa cells between 15 and 180 min of incubation at 37 °C. Fig. 2 also shows that the levels of nucleoplasmic poly(ADP-ribose) steadily decreased between 30 and 180 min post-DNA damage (panels e–j). Interestingly, panels i andj, which do not show detectable levels of poly(ADP-ribose) anymore, also reveal some of the characteristic morphological changes of apoptotic cells. Thus, during the period of incubation in which PARP is proteolytically degraded by caspase-3 during apoptotic execution (26Kumari S.R. Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5075-5078PubMed Google Scholar), there is still poly(ADP-ribose) catabolism going on (panels e–j). Moreover, under the chosen experimental conditions, this time period coincides with genomic DNA fragmentation (27Kumari S.R. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Invest. 2000; 18 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Also, the results described here indicate that there is still ongoing degradation of protein-bound poly(ADP-ribose) at a time when βNAD+ and ATP pools have already been depleted (31Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Eichenberger R. Althaus F.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 1055-1058Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and PARP has been proteolytically cleaved (26Kumari S.R. Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5075-5078PubMed Google Scholar). The highly dynamic nature of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation pathway (synthesis and turnover) in cells with damaged DNA implies the transient existence of protein-bound polymers. Indeed, the half-life of this highly polyanionic, nucleic acid-like molecule, can be very short (less than 1 min) in DNA-damaged cells (30Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Althaus F.R Mutat. Res. 1989; 218: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 32Wielckens K. Schmidt A. George E. Bredehorst R. Hilz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12872-12877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the time-dependent disappearance of the poly(ADP-ribose)-specific 10H antibody fluorescent signal that we observed between 30 and 180 min post-MNNG treatment (Fig. 2, panels e–i) indicates that the intranuclear levels of this polymer dramatically decrease concomitantly with the proteolysis of PARP. For this reason, we can also conclude that the activity of PARG remains mostly active between 30 and 180 min of MNNG treatment. However, it is important to note that our experiments do not completely rule out a possible contribution by phosphodiesterase activity to poly(ADP-ribose) catabolism. Nevertheless, because PARG is the main catabolic enzyme for poly(ADP-ribose) in DNA-damaged cells (30Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Althaus F.R Mutat. Res. 1989; 218: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 32Wielckens K. Schmidt A. George E. Bredehorst R. Hilz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12872-12877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,33Lin W. Ame J.C. Aboul-Ela N. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11895-11901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), our data support the notion that PARG is mostly active during apoptotic execution. Previously, it has been demonstrated that PARP protein functions as the main covalent target for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in cultured cells exposed to alkylating DNA damage (34Adamietz P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Very recently, it has also been observed that the automodification reaction of PARP, at least initially, involves 4 (35Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3948-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) of the 16 Glu residues localized in the automodification domain. Furthermore, it has been shown that, while the 85-kDa proteolytic fragment of PARP specifically interacts with p53 in HeLa cells within 30 min of MNNG treatment (26Kumari S.R. Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5075-5078PubMed Google Scholar), the 29-kDa amino-terminal fragment keeps DNA loose ends together early in apoptosis (36Smulson M.E. Pang Jung M. Dimitchev A. Chasovskikh S. Spoonde A. Simbulan-Rosenthal C. Rosenthal D. Yakovlev A. Dritschilo A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3495-3508PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we next proceeded to monitor the fate of these two proteolytic fragments in HeLa cells after MNNG treatment. We accomplished this goal by using two highly specific monoclonal antibodies, namely, F-I-23 and C-II-10 (37Lamarre D. Talbot B. deMurcia G. Laplante C. Leduc Y. Mazen A. Poirier G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 950: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which recognize the amino-terminal and the carboxyl-terminal apoptotic fragments of PARP, respectively. Figs. 3and 4 display the time-dependent distribution of the immunofluorescent signal generated with these monoclonal antibodies under the confocal microscope. As expected, control cells (panel a of Figs. 3and 4) displayed a homogeneous staining of the nucleus (including all nucleoli) before the enzymatic activation of PARP (compare with Fig. 2, panel a). These results are consistent with the notion that PARP is a constitutive “house-keeping” protein, whereas polymers of ADP-ribose are synthesized only in response to DNA damage (11De Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 172-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 20Shall S. Adv. Radiat. Biol. 1984; 11: 1-69Crossref Google Scholar, 21Berger N.A. Radiat. Res. 1985; 101: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Also shown in the confocal micrographs of Fig. 3 is that throughout the time of incubation (panels b–f), immunofluorescent signals generated with the F-I-23 antibody were visible in all nucleoli. By contrast, the results obtained with the C-II-10 antibody (Fig. 4) showed that the immunofluorescent signal decreased in the nucleoli to undetectable levels while evenly staining over the entire karyoplasm between 15 min (panel b) and 120 min (panels c–f) of MNNG treatment. Strikingly, this disappearance of the 85-kDa fragment of PARP from the nucleoli paralleled the selective karyoplasmic distribution of ADP-ribose polymers (Fig. 2). It should be noted, however, that while the F-I-23 signal immunostained the entire nucleus throughout 2 h of MNNG treatment, a slight decrease in the level of immunofluorescent intensity was noticed, perhaps indicating further proteolytic processing of the 29-kDa fragment late in apoptosis.Figure 4Time-dependent fluctuations in the subnuclear distribution of PARP and its 85-kDa apoptotic fragment in HeLa cells following exposure to 50 μm MNNG, as detected with antibody C-II-10. HeLa cells were treated with MNNG for 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min at 37 °C, fixed, and subsequently processed with C-II-10. Panels a, b, c, d, e, and f display the immunofluorescence observed under the confocal microscope after 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min of incubation with MNNG, respectively. The bar represents 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this paper, we show for the first time in a detailed time-course study, the visualization of poly(ADP-ribose) metabolism as well as the subnuclear distribution of native PARP and its apoptotic fragments following DNA damage with MNNG. We show the specific karyoplasmic and nucleolar staining of the 29- and 85-kDa proteolytic fragments of PARP (Figs. 3 and 4, respectively), as well as the preferential karyoplasmic distribution of protein-bound ADP-ribose polymers coincident with the onset of PARP proteolysis (Fig. 2). The biological significance of our confocal observations is further underlined by a recent report (38Stegh A.H. Schickling O. Ehret A. Scaffidi C. Peterhansel C. Hofmann T.G. Grummt I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5974-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) indicating that apoptotic proteolysis of key nuclear proteins may take place in the nucleolus just before apoptotic execution. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the absence of C-II-10 immunofluorescent staining in nucleoli (Fig. 4) after proteolysis of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated-PARP is due to the fact that the protein-bound ADP-ribose chains direct the transfer of this apoptotic fragment from the nucleolus to the karyoplasm. This interpretation is further substantiated by the following observations: first, it has recently been demonstrated that the auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction of PARP mainly occurs near the amino terminus of the 85-kDa proteolytic fragment (35Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3948-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); and second, no 10H antibody signal (specific for polymeric ADP-ribose) is observed in nucleoli after 15 min of MNNG treatment (Figs. 1 and 2). Our data, together with previous results (26Kumari S.R. Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5075-5078PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated 85-kDa fragment of PARP may be localized to the karyoplasm during apoptotic execution to modulate the activity(ies) of proteins, such as p53 (26Kumari S.R. Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5075-5078PubMed Google Scholar), by either protein-protein interactions and/or noncovalent poly(ADP-ribose)-protein interactions (39Malanga M. Pleschke J.M. Klezkowska H.A. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11839-11843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This interpretation is also supported by data shown in Fig. 3 revealing that F-I-23 immunofluorescence remained evenly distributed over the entire nucleoplasm throughout the 120 min of confocal microscopic observation. Therefore, it also appears that the 29-kDa fragment is not poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated in MNNG-treated HeLa cells. This notion is also fully consistent with our recent biochemical characterization of mono(ADP-ribosyl)ated-PARP (35Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3948-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A second alternative that might also explain the DNA damage-dependent pattern of immunostaining for the apoptotic fragments of PARP and ADP-ribose polymers after 15 min of MNNG treatment is the possibility that, upon cleavage of the DEVD domain by caspase-3 (40Oliver F.J. de la Rubia G. Rolli V. Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. de Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33533-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), the bipartite nuclear localization signal of this protein is irreversibly dissected into putative karyoplasmic- and nucleolar-specific targeting sequences. Further studies with mutants carrying specific deletions in the nuclear localization signal region of PARP need to be performed to test this hypothesis. In conclusion, we describe the rapid and selective disappearance of poly(ADP-ribose) and the 85-kDa fragment of PARP, but not the 29-kDa fragment, from nucleoli of HeLa cells following alkylation damage. In light of the recent results by Stegh et al. (38Stegh A.H. Schickling O. Ehret A. Scaffidi C. Peterhansel C. Hofmann T.G. Grummt I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5974-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), our data underscore the notion that nucleoli are remarkable organelle centers for proteolytic processing of nuclear proteins early in apoptosis. The precise definition of the roles of apoptotic fragments of PARP will significantly enhance our understanding of the dramatic structural and functional changes of the nucleus in the chronology apoptosis.

This substrate diversity is the crucial molecular basis of selective antiviral and suicide gene therapy. The mechanisms of substrate binding of HSV 1 TK were studied by means of site-directed mutagenesis combined with isothermal calorimetric measurements and guided by theoretical calculations and sequence comparison. The results show the link between the exceptionally broad substrate diversity of HSV 1 TK and the presence of structural features such as the residue triad His-58/Met-128/Tyr-172. The mutation of Met-128 into a Phe and the double mutant M128F/Y172F result in mutants that have lost their activity. However, by exchanging His to form the triple mutant H58L/M128F/Y172F, the enzyme regains activity. Strikingly, this triple mutant becomes resistant toward acyclovir. Furthermore, we give evidence for the importance of Glu-225 of the flexible LID region for the catalytic reaction. The data presented give new insights to understand mechanisms ruling substrate diversity and thus are crucial for both the development of new antiviral drugs and engineering of mutant TKs apt to accept novel substrate analogs for gene therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2080378357,"Brain intracellular platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) isoform I is a member of a family of complex enzymes composed of mutually homologous α1 and α2 subunits, both of which account for catalytic activity, and the β subunit. We previously demonstrated that the expression of one catalytic subunit, α1, is developmentally regulated, resulting in a switching of the catalytic complex from α1/α2 to α2/α2 during brain development (Manya, H., Aoki, J., Watanabe, M., Adachi, T., Asou, H., Inoue, Y., Arai, H., and Inoue, K. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 18567–18572). In this study, we explored the biochemical differences in three possible catalytic dimers, α1/α1, α1/α2, and α2/α2. The α2/α2 homodimer exhibited different substrate specificity from the α1/α1homodimer and the α1/α2 heterodimer, both of which showed similar substrate specificity. The α2/α2 homodimer hydrolyzed PAF and 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylethanolamine (AAGPE) most efficiently among 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-phospholipids. In contrast, both α1/α1 and α1/α2hydrolyzed 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid more efficiently than PAF. AAGPE was the poorest substrate for these enzymes. The β subunit bound to all three catalytic dimers but modulated the enzyme activity in a catalytic dimer composition-dependent manner. The β subunit strongly accelerated the enzyme activity of the α2/α2 homodimer but rather suppressed the activity of the α1/α1 homodimer and had little effect on that of the α1/α2heterodimer. The (His149 to Arg) mutant β, which has been recently identified in isolated lissencephaly sequence patients, lost the ability to either associate with the catalytic complexes or modulate their enzyme activity.

Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oligomeric brain PAF-AH contains a dimer of two highly homologous catalytic subunits, α1 and α2, that share 63% amino acid sequence identity but are not related to any other known proteins (2Hattori M.

Recently, the crystal structure of the α1/α1 homodimer was determined (4Ho Y.S. Swenson L. Derewenda L.S. Wei Y. Dauter Z. Hattori M. Adachi T. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Derewenda Z.S. Nature. 1997; 385: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the α1 subunit has a tertiary fold reminiscent of small GTPases such as p21ras and harbors a chymotrypsin-like Ser-Asp-His triad in its active site (4Ho Y.S. Swenson L. Derewenda L.S.

Although the catalytic subunits of PAF acetylhydrolase were first identified as a α1/α2 heterodimer from young adult bovine brain (1Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), recent studies have revealed that the α2/α2 homodimers are present in vivo as well (5Manya H. Aoki J. Watanabe M. Adachi T.

We have demonstrated in a previous study that expression of the α1 polypeptide is restricted to actively migrating neurons at the embryonic and early postnatal stages in rats and that switching of the catalytic dimer from the α1/α2 heterodimer to the α2/α2 homodimers occurs in these cells during brain development (5Manya H.

Although both the α1/α2 heterodimer and the α2/α2 homodimer hydrolyze PAF equallyin vitro, it is essential to elucidate the differences between those catalytic dimers in order to understand the significance of the switching of catalytic subunits and the function of this enzyme. In the present study, we studied the biochemical properties of three possible catalytic dimers, α1/α1, α1/α2, and α2/α2, and their complexes with the β subunit. One striking feature of brain PAF-AH isoform I is that the gene for the β subunit is identical to a causative gene (LIS1) for Miller-Dieker lissencephaly (7Hattori M. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. Nature. 1994; 370: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Miller-Dieker lissencephaly is a genetic brain malformation manifested as a smooth cerebral surface caused by abnormal neuronal migration at early developmental stages. Recent data demonstrated that deletions or mutations of the β/LIS1 gene accounts for approximately 40% of classic lissencephaly (8Pilz D.T. Matsumoto N. Minnerath S. Mills P. Gleeson J.G. Allen K.M.

Point mutations in the β subunit were recently reported in the LIS1 gene from isolated lissencephaly sequence patients (9Lo N.C. Chong C.S. Smith A.C. Dobyns W.B. Carrozzo R. Ledbetter D.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In one case of the mutant β, histidine 149 was replaced with arginine. Although it is assumed that this amino acid substitution may produce a radical change in steric hindrance due to the loss of a imidazolic ring, direct evidence for the functional abnormality of this mutation has not been presented so far. The effect of mutation in the β subunit on the interaction with α subunit was also examined. Recombinant α1 and α2 were expressed either by the E. coli system (3Hattori M. Adachi H. Aoki J. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31345-31352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or the baculovirus system. Recombinant β was expressed by the baculovirus system, since protein was not recovered from soluble fractions of E. coli. The production of recombinant baculoviruses was designed as follows. The coding regions of bovine α1, α2, and β cDNA were inserted into the SalI/NotI sites of pFASTBAC (Life Technologies, Inc.). His149 → Arg mutant β was prepared as follows: two oligonucleotides, 5′-GGGGGGAATTCATGTGTCCTGGCCTCTGGGGGACA-3′ (nucleotide positions 124 of bovine β cDNA (7Hattori M. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. Nature. 1994; 370: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar)) and 5′-GAGCCCCCAGAGCGACACCAATGA-3′ (nucleotide positions 485–508 of bovine β cDNA), were used as primers in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to introduce a mutation. The amplified PCR product and oligonucleotide, CCCCCGGATCCCTACACACAGGCCATTTTCAGGTC (nucleotide positions 1348–1371 of bovine β), were then used as primers for a second PCR. The resulting PCR product was introduced into theSalI/NotI sites of the pFASTBAC plasmid. Recombinant baculoviruses were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bac to Bac System, Life Technologies, Inc.). For infection, Sf9 cells were mixed with the recombinant viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 10 in various combinations of recombinant viruses and incubated at 27 °C for 72 h. The Sf9 cells (4 × 108) infected with each baculovirus were homogenized in 10 ml of SET buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4), and the cell supernatants was recovered by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g. Each recombinant protein was purified using DEAE ion exchange, hydroxyapatite, and anion exchange column chromatographies as follows. All column chromatographies were performed at 4 °C using fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DEAE-ion exchange chromatography was performed essentially as described previously (5Manya H. Aoki J. Watanabe M. Adachi T. Asou H. Inoue Y. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18567-18572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The cell supernatants obtained from the infected Sf9 cells were loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (5 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (flow rate 1 ml/min), which had been equilibrated with buffer A (0.1 m NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–1 m NaCl in buffer A. The active fractions as judged by PAF-AH activity assay were further applied onto hydroxyapatite column (Econo-Pac CHT II, 5 × 50 mm, Bio-Rad) (flow rate 0.8 ml/min), which had been equilibrated with buffer B (1 mmKH2PO4, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8). The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 1–400 mmKH2PO4 in buffer B. Each catalytic dimer was separated by anion exchange column (POROS HQ/M, 4.6 × 100 mm) (Perspective Biosystems, Inc. Framingham, MA.). After the column was first equilibrated with buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4), the active fractions from hydroxyapatite column chromatography which was dialyzed against buffer C were loaded onto the column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in buffer C (flow rate 4 ml/min). For the production of the β protein, the Sf9 cells (4 × 108) infected with β baculovirus were homogenized in 10 ml of SET buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4), and the cell supernatants were recovered by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g. The β protein was purified by DEAE-Sepharose and hydroxyapatite column chromatographies, as described above. PAF-AH assays were performed as described previously (5Manya H. Aoki J. Watanabe M. Adachi T. Asou H. Inoue Y. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18567-18572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), except that the radioactivity of liberated [3H]acetate was counted by a β-counter. A kinetic study was performed using various concentrations of PAF as a substrate of an assay as described previously (2Hattori M. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23150-23155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking was performed as described previously (5Manya H. Aoki J. Watanabe M. Adachi T. Asou H. Inoue Y. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18567-18572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, each sample was dialyzed against 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), cross-linked by adding 10 mm BS3 (Pierce), and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Polyclonal anti-α1, -α2, and β were used to detect cross-linked products, since our monoclonal antibodies failed to react with the BS3-treated polypeptides. 1-O-Alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylethanolamine (AAGPE) and 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid (AAGPA) were prepared according to the method described by Satouchiet al. (10Satouchi K. Pinckard R.N. McManus L.M. Hanahan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4425-4432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using base exchange reaction by phospholipase D (from Actinomadura, Meito Sangyo, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, nonradioactive PAF (C16, 5 mg) mixed with 3H-PAF (87 μCi) was subjected to phospholipase D reaction in the presence of ethanolamine (200 mm for AAGPE). For AAGPA, synthesis nonradioactive PAF (C16, 5 mg) mixed with 3H-PAF (87 μCi) was subjected to phospholipase D reaction in the absence of alcohol. The resulting products were isolated by preparative thin layer chromatography. Activity assays using these PAF analogs were performed as described above, except that 0.05 n HCl was added when liberated acetic acid was separated from the substrate when AAGPA was used. Chemical labeling of catalytic subunits was performed as described previously (3Hattori M. Adachi H. Aoki J. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31345-31352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), except that [14C]DFP (NEN Life Science Products) was used in this study. Briefly, 2 μg of recombinant catalytic subunits was incubated with 0.1 μCi of [14C]DFP for 30 min at room temperature. The incorporation of radiolabeled DFP into the catalytic subunits was detected by SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography. In order to obtain various combinations of catalytic dimers, the α1 and α2 subunits of brain PAF-AH were expressed in the Sf9 cells by infecting the Sf9 cells with recombinant baculoviruses. The expression of catalytic dimers in the cytosol of Sf9 cells infected with both the α1 and α2 viruses was examined with POROS-HQ/M anion exchange column chromatography. Both α1and α2 subunits were detected in a single peak when expressed individually in Sf9 cells (Figs.1, A and B). In contrast, when these two subunits were co-expressed in the cells, three peaks of activity were detected after the column chromatography (Fig.1 C). By immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 C, bottom), we found that the α1 polypeptide was detected in both the first and second peak fractions, and the α2 polypeptide was detected in the second and third peak fractions. These data suggested that the α1/α2 heterodimer and the α1/α1 and α2/α2 homodimers were formed in the Sf9 cells infected with both α1 and α2 viruses. The α1/α2heterodimer was predominantly but not exclusively formed under the present conditions. Dimer formation of the catalytic subunits in each fraction in Fig.1 C was examined by cross-linking studies. Incubation of each activity fraction with the cross-linking agent BS3 yielded similar ∼60-kDa bands. The 60-kDa bands obtained from the first and third peak fractions cross-reacted with the anti-α1 and -α2 antibodies, respectively, and the 60-kDa bands from the second peak fraction cross-reacted with both the anti-α1 and -α2 antibodies (Fig.2). This indicates that these three peak fractions represent the α1/α1, α1/α2, and α2/α2 dimers. By using recombinant proteins, we first examined the substrate specificities of three different catalytic complexes. The substrates used in this study were 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-glycerophospholipids with different head groups. Each recombinant catalytic complex produced in the Sf9 cells was purified to near-homogeneity (see Fig. 4 A) by chromatographies, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 3, the α2/α2 homodimer exhibited different substrate specificity from the α1/α1homodimer and the α1/α2 heterodimer, both of which showed similar substrate specificity to each other. The α2/α2 homodimer hydrolyzed PAF and 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylethanolamine (AAGPE) more efficiently than 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid (AAGPA). In contrast, both α1/α1 and α1/α2 hydrolyzed AAGPA more efficiently than PAF. AAGPE was the poorest substrate for these enzymes. The α2/α2 homodimer hydrolyzed PAF 3–4 times better than the α1/α2 heterodimer and the α1/α1 homodimer. When AAGPE was used as a substrate, change in composition of the catalytic dimer from α1/α2 to α2/α2induced a dramatic increase in the catalytic efficiency. It was demonstrated from these observations that the catalytic complexes of PAF-AH isoform I can hydrolyze PAF analogs with a different head group depending on the composition of the catalytic subunit. Moreover, it was shown that the α1/α2 heterodimer and the α2/α2 homodimer, both of which were detected in vivo, exhibited different substrate specificity.Figure 3Substrate specificities of α1/α1, α1/α2, and α2/α2dimers. The catalytic activities of three possible dimers were examined using PAF, AAGPE, and AAGPA as substrates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 3, the α1/α2 heterodimer exhibited a substrate specificity similar to the α1/α1 homodimer rather than the α2/α2 homodimer, suggesting that catalysis by the α1 subunit dominates in the α1/α2 heterodimer. To test this possibility, we performed an active site labeling study using [14C]DFP, which binds covalently to an active serine residue. When the recombinant α1/α1 and α2/α2 homodimers were incubated with [14C]DFP, both α1 and α2polypeptides were labeled with [14C]DFP (Fig.4). The α1 subunit was preferentially labeled with this reagent when the α1/α2 heterodimer was used. These data are consistent with previous observations that the α1 subunit is preferentially labeled by [3H]DFP in the purified PAF-AH (isoform Ib) from bovine brain (1Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that a serine residue of the α2 subunit catalytic center is shielded to be inactive in the α1/α2heterodimer, although the same residue in the α2/α2 homodimer is catalytically active. Next, we examined whether each catalytic dimer can associate with the β subunit. Each catalytic dimer was prepared by Sf9 cells as described above. The recombinant β subunit also prepared by baculovirus system in Sf9 cells was purified to near-homogeneity by column chromatographies, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each catalytic dimer was incubated with the β subunit on ice for 60 min, and then the mixture was analyzed with hydroxyapatite column chromatography. When each purified catalytic dimer was applied to the column, the activity was eluted as a single peak (Fig. 5, A‒C), respectively, whereas preincubation of the catalytic complexes with the β subunit generated new activity peaks. These peaks contained the respective catalytic subunit and the β subunit (Fig. 5, D‒F), indicating the association of catalytic dimers with the β subunit. We then examined the effect of the β subunit on the enzyme activity of each catalytic dimer. As shown in Fig.6 C, the enzyme activity of the α2/α2 homodimer increased significantly by adding the recombinant β. In the optimum β concentration (5 μg per tube), the enzyme activity of the α2/α2homodimer increased approximately 4-fold. Increasing β to more than 5 μg per tube did not cause a further increase in enzyme activity (data not shown) under the present conditions. In contrast, β slightly suppressed the activity of the α1/α1homodimer (Fig. 6 A) and essentially had no effect on that of the α1/α2 heterodimer (Fig. 6 B). We performed the same experiments using the native β purified from bovine brain instead of the recombinant β, obtaining essentially the same results (data not shown). We also tested the effect of the β subunit on catalytic activity in Sf9 cells. The Sf9 cells were infected with either the α1 baculovirus or the α2 baculovirus with increasing amounts of β baculovirus, and the lysates of the infected cells were examined for protein expression and PAF-AH activity. The PAF-AH activity of the α1/α1 homodimer was decreased in proportion to the increase of the β expression, whereas that of the α2/α2 homodimer was rather increased (data not shown). The levels of α1 and α2 subunit expression were not affected appreciably by the co-expression of the β subunit. These findings also support the idea that the β subunit stimulates the activity of the α2/α2 homodimer but suppresses that of the α1/α1 homodimer. Like wild-type β/LIS1 protein the mutant β could be expressed in Sf9 cells and purified. The mutant β subunit exhibited no effect on the catalytic activity of all the catalytic dimers (data not shown). Unlike the native β subunit, as judged from the failure of inducing a shift of the α dimer peak on a hydroxyapatite column chromatography, the mutant β could not associate with catalytic subunits (Fig.7). Brain PAF-AH (also PAF-AH isoform I) contains two mutually homologous α1 and α2 subunits, both of which can form a respective homodimer and a heterodimer, and in fact, the α1/α2 heterodimer and the α2/α2 homodimer have been detected in vivo (1Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Manya H. Aoki J. Watanabe M. Adachi T. Asou H. Inoue Y. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18567-18572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In rats, α1 expression is restricted in early developing neurons at embryonic stages at which the neural cell migration is most active, and switching of catalytic subunits from the α1/α2 heterodimer to the α2/α2 homodimer occurs during brain development (5Manya H. Aoki J. Watanabe M. Adachi T. Asou H. Inoue Y. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18567-18572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is also well established that the other subunit of PAF-AH isoform I, β, is a product of the causative gene for Miller-Dieker syndrome, which has a defect in neuronal migration during brain development. It was thus essential to delineate the biochemical differences of each catalytic dimer in order to understand the biological role of PAF-AH. In the present study, we have demonstrated that each catalytic dimer exhibited distinct substrate specificity and that their enzyme activity is modulated by the β subunit in catalytic subunit composition-dependent manner. Previously, we showed that PAF-AH isoform I has strict specificity for the acetyl group attached to the sn-2 position of phosphoglyceride as a substrate (11Hattori K. Hattori M. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22308-22313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The essential amino acid residue involved in the recognition of acetyl moiety has also been postulated from crystallographic studies (4Ho Y.S. Swenson L. Derewenda L.S. Wei Y. Dauter Z. Hattori M. Adachi T. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Derewenda Z.S. Nature. 1997; 385: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, it was unknown whether the enzyme may recognize the phospholipid substrate with a different head group. In this study, we demonstrated that the enzyme hydrolyzed the phospholipid substrate with a head group other than choline moiety. 1-O-Alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid (AAGPA) is an intermediate for the production of PAF via the de novo pathway (12Snyder F. Fitzgerald V. Blank M.L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 416: 5-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is synthesized by acetylation of alkylglycerophosphate. Interestingly, the enzyme catalyzing this reaction is enriched in the brain microsomal fractions and, in particular, in the brain nuclear fractions, as compared with the lyso-PAF acetyltransferase (13Baker R.R. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The present data demonstrating that PAF-AH isoform I can hydrolyze AAGPA as well as PAF raises the possibility that the enzyme may regulate the intracellular PAF level by hydrolyzing not only PAF itself but also an intermediate for thede novo PAF synthesis. More interestingly, it is also possible that AAGPA itself may play a role in the cell as a new type of intracellular lipid messenger (14Tokumura A. Yotsumoto T. Hoshikawa T. Tanaka T. Tsukatani H. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the level of which is regulated by PAF-AH isoform I. 1-O-Alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (AAGPE) or alk-1-enylacetylglycerophosphoethanolamine (2-acetyl-plasmalogen) can also be synthesized in vivo. Leeet al. (15Lee T.C. Uemura Y. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19992-20001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated 2-acetyl-plasmalogen is produced in intact HL-60 cells by incubating with PAF after stimulating with calcium ionophore A-23187. They also reported the presence of a unique membrane-associated transacetylase that transfers the acetate group from PAF to lysoplasmalogen with the formation of 2-acetyl-plasmalogen (15Lee T.C. Uemura Y. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19992-20001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the α2/α2 homodimer hydrolyzes AAGPE very efficiently, it is highly possible that 2-acetyl-plasmalogen can be hydrolyzed by the enzyme as well. It has not been reported so far that 2-acetyl-plasmalogen may have a role in the cells. However, if it is a in vivo substrate for PAF-AH isoform I, switching the composition of the catalytic subunit from α1/α2 to α2/α2causes a drastic change in the efficiency of substrate hydrolysis (Fig.3). The substrate specificity and the specific activity of the α1/α2 heterodimer were very similar to the α1/α1 homodimer but not to the α2/α2 homodimer. We previously reported that DFP, a reagent that specifically binds to an active serine residue, reacted preferentially with the α1 subunit in the isoform Ib, suggesting that the catalytic serine residue of the α2 subunit is shielded to be inactive. A crystallographic study of the α1/α1 homodimer revealed that the two active sites are at the bottom of the catalytic gorge, only 12 Å from each other (4Ho Y.S. Swenson L. Derewenda L.S. Wei Y. Dauter Z. Hattori M. Adachi T. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Derewenda Z.S. Nature. 1997; 385: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This proximity suggests that these two active sites do not function independently, since this catalytic gorge is capable of accommodating only one PAF molecule. Thus we speculate that only one active serine residue is enough for catalysis. It is also possible that one active serine out of two in the catalytic gorge of all three dimers are actually shielded to be inactive. A substrate specificity study as well as DFP labeling experiments have demonstrated that catalysis by the α1 subunit may dominate in the α1/α2 heterodimer. We have detected the α1/α2 heterodimer and the α2/α2 homodimer in vivo, but the α1/α1 homodimer has not been detected yet. It is still possible that the α1/α1homodimer exists in vivo, but even the α1/α2 heterodimer can be substituted for the α1/α1 homodimer in terms of substrate specificity. Which amino acid residue(s) is critical for determining the substrate specificity in the catalytic subunits? According to the crystal structure of the α1/α1 homodimer, the amino acid residues Tyr191 and Tyr193 are exposed to the catalytic gorge and possibly recognize a head group of PAF (4Ho Y.S. Swenson L. Derewenda L.S. Wei Y. Dauter Z. Hattori M. Adachi T. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Derewenda Z.S. Nature. 1997; 385: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these Tyr residues of the α1subunit are substituted into Phe192 and Phe194in the α2 subunit (4Ho Y.S. Swenson L. Derewenda L.S. Wei Y. Dauter Z. Hattori M. Adachi T. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Derewenda Z.S. Nature. 1997; 385: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Our preliminary mutation study demonstrated that the exchange of Tyr191 into Phe gives the α1 subunit a substrate specificity similar to that of α2. We previously concluded that the β subunit does not possess a regulatory role on catalytic activity, based on the observation that the β subunit can be dissociated without loss of enzyme activity from the α1·α2·β complex purified from bovine brain (7Hattori M. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. Nature. 1994; 370: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). We demonstrated in the present study that this was true only for the α1/α2 heterodimer. The rate of PAF hydrolysis by the α2/α2homodimer was, however, accelerated about 4 times by the addition of β, whereas the rate of hydrolysis by the α1/α1 was slightly suppressed by it. In the rat brain, composition of the catalytic subunit of PAF-AH changes drastically from the α1/α2 heterodimer to the α2/α2 homodimer during development. These changes in the catalytic subunit from α1/α2 to α2/α2may result in a drastic increase in the PAF-AH activity, since (i) α2/α2 hydrolyzes PAF four times better than α1/α2 does, and (ii) only the enzyme activity of α2/α2 is accelerated by β. Our preliminary study shows that PAF-AH activity in the rat brain is much higher in adulthood than that in embryonic stages, although the expression levels of α2 and β were roughly the same during this period. Change in enzyme activity can be explained by the change in the composition of the catalytic subunit. The change in PAF-AH activity during brain development might regulate PAF content in neural cells. Consistent with this idea, Tokumura et al.(14Tokumura A. Yotsumoto T. Hoshikawa T. Tanaka T. Tsukatani H. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) have reported that PAF content in the young rat brain is higher than that in the adult brain. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the enzyme activity of PAF-AH isoform I is regulated in multiple ways by switching the combination of the catalytic subunit and by manipulating the β subunit. We have also postulated the possibility that some 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-phospholipids other than PAF may be genuine substrates for the enzyme. It is still unclear at present which effect is relevant in vivo and what the in vivosubstrate for this enzyme is. Our next challenge will be to identify the in vivo lipid substrate for this enzyme and its cellular function."

Glutamine 63 is essential for GTP hydrolysis by Rho. Deamidation of glutamine by DNT inhibits the GTPase activity of Rho and renders the Rho protein constitutively active. The same mechanism of Rho activation by deamidation was reported for the cytotoxic necrotizing factor CNF1 from Escherichia coli(14Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C.

Also CNF deamidates Rho at glutamine 63 and causes similar cytotoxic effects such as multinucleation of cells and stress fiber formation. CNF1 and DNT share a region of homology (amino acid residues 1250–1351 of DNT) located at the C termini of the toxins (16Walker K.E. Weiss A.A. Infect.

Recently, it was shown that a C-terminal fragment of CNF1 (ΔCNF), covering the region of homology, causes the typical cytotoxic effects after microinjection and possesses full Rho-deamidating activity in vitro. In addition to deamidase activity, ΔCNF possesses transglutaminase activity. However, this activity is observed only in the presence of high concentrations of primary amines and is apparently lower than the deamidase activity (17Schmidt G. Selzer J. Lerm M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13669-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Here we attempted to identify the region of DNT that harbors the enzyme activity of the toxin and characterized its biological and biochemical activities. We report that ΔDNT covering amino acid residues 1136–1451 possesses full deamidating activity. Cysteine 1292, histidine 1307, and lysine 1310 are essential for enzyme activity. As found for ΔCNF, the active fragment of DNT possesses transglutaminase activity. In contrast to CNF1, ΔDNT exhibits a higher transglutaminase than deamidase activity, indicating that DNT acts preferentially as a transglutaminase. Another difference between ΔCNF and ΔDNT is the nucleotide dependence of the deamidation/transglutamination reaction. Whereas ΔCNF modifies GDP- and GTP-loaded Rho proteins, ΔDNT exclusively accepts GDP-bound RhoA. RhoA and p50RhoGAP (obtained from A. Hall, London) were prepared from their fusion proteins as described. Dansylcadaverine and ethylenediamine were purchased from Sigma. Methanol and chloroform were of analytical grade, and trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile were of high pressure liquid chromatography grade. For production of ΔDNT consisting of amino acid residues 1136–1451, the DNA was amplified from the plasmid DNT 103 (16Walker K.E. Weiss A.A. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3817-3828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction with the following primers: ΔDNT sense, 5′-GGATCCGCTTCCGGCGGGGGGCCG-3′; ΔDNT antisense, 5′-GAATTCTCAGACCGGCGCCGGAAACAA-3′. The PCR product was purified from agarose gel (Jet sorb, Genomed) and amplified in the pCRTMII vector (Invitrogen) by means of TA cloning. From this vector the DNT fragment was cut withBamHI and EcoRI, purified, and ligated into the digested pGEX vector. The proper construct was checked by DNA sequencing. The vector was transformed into BL21 cells by heat shock at 42 °C. Expression of the GST fusion protein in E. coliBL21 cells growing at 37 °C was induced by adding 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration) at OD 0.5. 6 h after induction, cells were collected and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1% Triton X-100) and purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Loaded beads were washed two times in washing buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) and washing buffer B (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) at 4 °C. ΔDNT was eluted from the beads as a GST fusion protein with glutathione (10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for 10 min at room temperature. Mutagenesis of ΔDNT was performed by round circle polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis (Quick changeTM, Stratagene) with the following sense primers and corresponding antisense primers (MWG): C1292S sense, 5′-GGCTCCTTGAGCGGGTCCACGACGATGGTTGGG-3′; C1292A sense, 5′-GGCTCCTTGAGCGGGGCCACGACGATGGTTGGG-3′; H1307A sense, 5′-GGCTACCTGGCCTTCTACGCCACTGGCAAGTCGACC-3′; and K1310A sense, 5′-GCCTTCTACCACACTGGCGCGTCGACCGAACTCGGG-3′. Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing using a dye terminator sequencing kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). Activation of FXIII occurs through thrombin cleavage of the a-chains in the presence of calcium ions. 10 μm human factor XIII a-chains (Centeon) were incubated with 2 μg/μl thrombin for 30 min at room temperature in reaction buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmtriethanolamine, and 8.5 mm CaCl2. Thrombin was then removed by incubation with benzamidine-Sepharose for 10 min at room temperature. The activity of FXIII was tested with fibronectin as a substrate. For qualitative measurement of ammonia a coupled enzymatic reaction was used that was based on the ammonia test combination for food analysis (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). NADH was diluted to give a concentration of 50 μm with triethanolamine buffer containing 2-oxoglutarate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. Ten units of GlDH and RhoA (final concentration 10 μm) were added. After the addition of ΔCNF1 or ΔDNT (each 1 μm), the decrease in NADH fluorescence was monitored in a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B luminescence spectrometer. The emission was measured at 460 nm with excitation at 340 nm. For quantitative analysis of the ammonia release, Rho proteins (200 μm) were incubated with ΔCNF1 (1 μm) or ΔDNT (1 μm) in a reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped at different time points by incubation for 1 min at 95 °C. Denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation, and ammonia produced was measured in the supernatant. Decrease in absorbance was measured following the instructions given for the ammonia test combination for food analysis (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For microinjection, NIH3T3 cells were seeded subconfluently on glass coverslips (CELLocate, Eppendorf) and cultivated for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After serum starvation GST-ΔDNT (2 mg/ml) or buffer was microinjected into NIH3T3 cells with a Microinjector 5242 (Eppendorf). 6 h after microinjection, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 10 min. For actin staining, formaldehyde-fixed cells were intensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidine (1 unit/coverslip) at room temperature for 1 h, washed again, and applied for fluorescence microscopy (as bleaching preservative KAISER'S glycerol gelatin (Merck) was used). Small GTPases were incubated with GST-ΔCNF1 or GST-ΔDNT in the presence of monodansylcadaverine or ethylenediamine (50 mm) in transglutamination buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) for the indicated times at 37 °C. As a control, RhoA was incubated without the toxins but in the presence of a cosubstrate. The molar ratio of toxin:RhoA was 1:20. Labeling of proteins with the fluorescent lysine analog dansylcadaverine was analyzed by fluorescence activity under UV light before staining and drying the gel. Recombinant Rho proteins were modified by ΔCNF1 or transglutaminase in the presence or absence of primary amines. The reaction was stopped by freezing in liquid nitrogen. After thawing the proteins were loaded with [γ-32P]GTP for 5 min at 37 °C in loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol). MgCl2 (12 mm, final concentration) and unlabeled GTP (2 mm, final concentration) were added. For stimulation of GTPase activity by Rho-GAP, 50 nmp50RhoGAP were added to 1 μm Rho, and incubation was for 4 min at 37 °C. GTPase activity was analyzed by filter binding assay as described (15Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). GST-ΔDNT was incubated with different concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 30 min at room temperature. N-ethylmaleimide was than inactivated by adding dithiothreitol in a molar ratio of 10:1 (dithiothreitol:N-ethylmaleimide) for 10 min. For modification of RhoA, the GTPase was incubated withN-ethylmaleimide-treated or -untreated toxin in the presence of 50 mm ethylenediamine in transglutamination buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) for 30 min at 37 °C. The excised gel plugs of Rho A were destained for 1 h at 50 °C in 40% acetonitrile, 60% hydrogen carbonate (50 mm, pH 7.8) to remove Coomassie Blue, gel buffer, SDS, and salts. The plug was subsequently dried in a vacuum centrifuge for 15 min. Thereafter, 30 μl of digestion buffer with trypsin was added, and digestion was carried out for 12 h at 37 °C. 4-Hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid (Aldrich) was recrystallized from hot methanol and stored in the dark. Saturated matrix solution of 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid in a 1:1 solution of acetonitrile/aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was prepared. 2 μl of the proteolytic peptide mixture were mixed with 2 μl of saturated matrix containing marker peptides (5 pmol of human ACTH (18–39) clip (MW 2466, Sigma) and 5 pmol of human angiotensin II (MW 1047, Sigma), respectively) for internal calibration. Using the dried-drop method of matrix crystallization, 1 μl of the sample matrix solution was placed on the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization stainless-steel target and was allowed to air dry several minutes at room temperature resulting in a thin layer of fine granular matrix crystals. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight-mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker Biflex mass spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen laser (l = 337 nm) to desorb and ionize the samples. Mass spectra were recorded in the reflector positive mode in combination with delayed extraction. External calibration was routinely used, and internal calibration with two points that bracketed the mass range of interest was additionally performed to consolidate peptide masses further. The computer program mass spectrometry-digest (Peter Baker and Karl Clauser, UCSF Mass Spectrometry Facility) was used for computer-assisted comparison of the tryptic peptide mapping data with the expected set of peptides. Recently, it was shown that the CNF1 of E. coli activates Rho proteins by deamidating glutamine at position 63 of RhoA or 61 of Rac and Cdc42. Moreover, it has been reported that CNF1 possesses transglutaminase activity. CNF1 and DNT share a region of homology (amino acid residues 1250–1351 of DNT) located at their C termini (16Walker K.E. Weiss A.A. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3817-3828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied whether the C-terminal fragment ΔDNT (amino acid residues 1136–1451 of the holotoxin) is sufficient for the enzyme activity. To analyze the activity of GST-ΔDNT, we constructed the vector pGEX-ΔDNT, expressed the toxin fragment as a GST fusion protein, and purified it by affinity chromatography. Because the fusion toxin exhibited full activity and was not cleavable without degradation of ΔDNT, we used the fusion toxin (which is termed ΔDNT in the text) throughout the entire study. After incubation of RhoA with ΔDNT for 15 min, the GTPase shifted to an apparent higher molecular mass in SDS-PAGE indicating deamidation of Rho (15Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). In the presence of the transglutaminase cosubstrate ethylenediamine, however, RhoA shifted slightly to an apparent lower molecular mass. Recently, we reported that a downward shift of RhoA in SDS-PAGE corresponding to transglutamination was obtained when the GTPase was incubated with ΔCNF and ethylenediamine (17Schmidt G. Selzer J. Lerm M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13669-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed tryptic peptides of ΔDNT-treated RhoA by mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig.2 B, the mass analysis of the tryptic digest of the upper band of ΔDNT-treated RhoA revealed the RhoA peptide Gln52-Arg68 exhibiting a mass shift of one dalton in comparison to untreated RhoA (Fig.2 A). Tryptic digest of the downward shifted band of RhoA resulted in identification of the same peptide (Gln52-Arg68) but with a mass shift of 43 Da as compared with the control protein. This increase in mass indicated the transglutamination of Gln63 by ethylenediamine (Fig.2 C). Also dansylcadaverine, a fluorescent primary amine (18Takagi J. Aoyama T. Ueki S. Ohba H. Saito Y. Lorand L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), served as a cosubstrate for the transglutamination of RhoA by ΔCNF1 (note that also ΔCNF1 was used as the GST fusion protein) and ΔDNT. To compare the transglutamination activity of the toxin fragments, RhoA was incubated with the enzymes in the presence of dansylcadaverine, and the amount of GTPase modified was analyzed in SDS-PAGE under UV light. As shown in Fig.3, RhoA was dansylated by ΔDNT to a larger extent than by ΔCNF. To compare the transglutaminase activities of both toxins in more detail, kinetic studies were performed.Figure 2Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight-mass spectrometry spectra of in gel digestion of modified RhoA. Gel plugs of unmodified Rho A (A) and Rho A modified by GST-ΔDNT in the absence (B) or presence of 20 mm ethylenediamine (C) were excised and destained for 1 h in 40% acetonitrile, 60% hydrogen carbonate (50 mm, pH 7.8). The plugs were subsequently dried in a vacuum centrifuge for 15 min. Thereafter, trypsin digestion was carried out for 12 h at 37 °C. A, the RhoA peptide Gln52-Arg68 (2009 Da) is shown. B, deamidation of Gln63 of Rho A by GST-ΔDNT results in a mass shift of the peptide of 1 Da.

RhoA (20 μm) was incubated with GST-ΔCNF1 (1 μm) or GST-ΔDNT (1 μm) in the presence of dansylcadaverine for 15 min at 37 °C. Labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (5 μg RhoA/lane). Dansylated proteins were visualized by exposure to UV light (shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To compare kinetics of the deamidation and transglutamination reaction of ΔCNF1 and ΔDNT, the time course of ammonia release induced by the toxins was studied. The ammonia release assays were performed with a substrate concentration of 200 μm RhoA and an enzyme (GST-ΔDNT or GST-ΔCNF1) concentration of 1 μm. As shown in Fig.4 A, no difference in the production of ammonia was observed with or without ethylenediamine when RhoA was modified by ΔCNF1. On the contrary, ΔDNT released a higher amount of ammonia in the presence of ethylenediamine than in the absence of the primary amine (Fig. 4 B). A similar result was obtained in the presence of increasing concentrations of ethylenediamine. As shown in Fig.5 A, with ΔDNT the production of ammonia increased in an ethylenediamine concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, the addition of ethylenediamine at increasing concentration had no effect on ammonia production by ΔCNF1. Thus, all these data indicate that ΔDNT is preferentially a transglutaminase. Similarly, blood clotting factor FXIII, which is a mammalian transglutaminase (19Hettasch J.M. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28309-28313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), released a higher amount of ammonia in the presence of the primary amine than in its absence (not shown).Figure 5Production of ammonia and GTPase activity of modified RhoA. Rho proteins (200 μm) were incubated with GST-ΔCNF1 (1 μm) (●) or GST-ΔDNT (1 μm) (▪) in transglutamination buffer in the presence of different concentrations of ethylenediamine at 37 °C. A,production of ammonia. The reaction was stopped after 10 min by heating for 1 min at 95 °C. Denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the ammonia produced was measured in the supernatant.

The reaction was stopped by freezing an aliquot of the proteins in liquid nitrogen. Toxin-treated RhoA was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP. Thereafter, the GTPase activity was stimulated by adding p50GAP.

Shown is the remaining bound radioactivity as percent of loaded radioactivity as mean + S.D. of three independent experiments. ED, ethylenediamine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is known that the activity of mammalian transglutaminases including FXIII is dependent on calcium ions (19Hettasch J.M. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28309-28313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether Ca2+ ions affect the activity of ΔDNT, we measured the ammonia release induced by the toxin fragment in the absence and presence of EGTA. Ammonia release caused by FXIII was dependent on the presence of Ca2+ ions, whereas the presence of EGTA had no (5 mm) or a very small (10 mm) effect on the activity of ΔDNT (not shown). In the presence of EGTA, both ΔDNT and ΔCNF1 modified RhoA by dansylation (not shown). Blood clotting factor FXIII, which modifies various protein substrates such as fibronectin, actin, and casein, transglutaminates three of the five glutamine residues of RhoA, whereas CNF1 is specific for Gln63 of RhoA and Gln61 of Cdc42 and Rac1 (17Schmidt G. Selzer J. Lerm M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13669-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To investigate the specificity of ΔDNT, we incubated RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, the respective Q63E/Q61E mutants, actin, and casein in the presence of dansylcadaverine with ΔDNT for 30 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, transglutaminated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and UV light exposure. As shown in Fig.6, ΔDNT modified the wild-type GTPases RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 but not the Q63E/Q61E mutants, actin, or casein. In contrast, FXIII modified wild-type and mutant GTPases, actin, and casein (not shown). In line with the above observations, no ammonia was released during incubation of the Q63E mutant with the toxins (not shown). To compare kinetics of the deamidation/transglutamination reactions of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 induced by the toxin fragments, we measured ammonia release in a time course. The reactions were performed with a protein substrate concentration of 200 μm, an enzyme concentration of 1 μm and 20 mm ethylenediamine. In Fig.7, the time courses of ΔDNT-induced ammonia release of RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 are shown as the mean of three independent experiments. All Rho proteins exhibited similar kinetics of ammonia release. Similarly, ΔCNF1 did not show major differences in the kinetics of ammonia release between the three GTPases (not shown). Gln63 of RhoA is known to be important for the intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTPase mechanism of the protein (20Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To analyze whether transglutaminated protein is still able to hydrolyze GTP, we measured its p50RhoGAP-stimulated GTPase activity. Fig.5 B illustrates the effects of ΔCNF1 and ΔDNT on the GTPase activity of RhoA in the presence of increasing concentrations of ethylenediamine. Similar as observed for the ammonia release (Fig.5 A), inhibition of the GTPase with ΔCNF1 was independent of the ethylenediamine concentration, whereas the blockade of the GTP hydrolysis with ΔDNT increased with increasing concentration of the primary amine. Thus, inhibition of GTPase activity and ammonia release induced by ΔDNT correlated very well, indicating that the transglutamination inhibits GTPase activity of RhoA. It has been shown by Horiguchi et al. (10Horiguchi Y. Inoue N. Masuda M. Kashimoto T. Katahira J. Sugimoto N. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11623-11626Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that treatment of cells with DNT leads to actin polymerization and stress fiber formation because of activation of RhoA. To investigate whether ΔDNT possesses the same cytotoxic effect in intact cells, we microinjected the toxin fragment as a GST fusion protein into quiescent NIH3T3 cells. The toxin fragment caused formation of stress fibers after 6 h of incubation. However this effect was not as strong as observed with ΔCNF1 (not shown). This may be because of instability of the GST-ΔDNT fusion protein, which significantly decreased in activity after a few days of storage at 4 °C or after incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. Recently, cysteine was identified to be a functionally essential residue in ΔCNF1, which is most likely located in the active site of the enzyme. Like ΔCNF, ΔDNT contains a single cysteine residue in a protein region highly similar to ΔCNF (Fig. 9). According to the findings with CNF, treatment of the toxin fragment with iodoacetamide orN-ethylmaleimide blocked the enzyme activity of ΔDNT (not shown). Exchange of cysteine 1292 with serine or alanine largely decreased or completely inhibited the enzyme activity of ΔDNT, respectively. Moreover the exchange of histidine 1307 with alanine blocked the enzyme activity of ΔDNT in analogy to CNF1 (not shown). A nucleotide binding motif has been described for DNT (not present in CNF) covering residues 1304–1311 (AFYHTGKS) with the consensus (A/G)XXXXGK(S/T) (16Walker K.E. Weiss A.A. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3817-3828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the relevance of this motif for ΔDNT activity, we changed lysine 1310 to alanine. This mutation blocked ΔDNT activity of the toxin fragment as already reported for the holotoxin (11Pullinger G.D. Adams T.E. Mullan P.B. Garrod T.I. Lax A.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4163-4171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We observed differences between the toxins in respect to the nucleotide dependence of the deamidation/transglutamination reactions. Fig.8 shows the dansylation of V14RhoA previously loaded with GDP or GTP and of wild-type RhoA loaded with GDP or GTPγS. Free nucleotide was removed by gel filtration before modification by the toxins. Whereas ΔCNF catalyzed the deamidation reaction independently of the nucleotide bound, ΔDNT accepted GDP-loaded RhoA or GDP-loaded V14RhoA as a substrate but did not modify GTPγS-bound RhoA or GTP-loaded V14RhoA. To test whether the activity of ΔDNT was regulated by nucleotides via a direct interaction, the toxin was pretreated with nucleotides or nucleotides were added to the reaction mixture. In both cases, we were not able to obtain any evidence for an inhibition of ΔDNT activity by a direct interaction of the enzyme with GTPγS (not shown). Recently Horiguchi et al. (10Horiguchi Y. Inoue N. Masuda M. Kashimoto T. Katahira J. Sugimoto N. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11623-11626Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) showed that DNT fromBordetella modifies Rho GTPases by deamidation of Gln63. A similar deamidation of Rho at Gln63was reported for CNF1 from E. coli (14Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 15Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). DNT and CNF share a significant sequence homology in a rather small part of the proteins, suggesting that the deamidase activity is located in this region of the toxins. Therefore, we constructed ΔDNT, which covered this homologous region (Fig. 9). This fragment consisting of amino acid residues 1136–1451 possessed full deamidase activity and typically caused an upward shift of RhoA in SDS-PAGE. This change in migration in SDS-PAGE was not observed with the Q63E mutant of RhoA, confirming that exclusively Gln63was deamidated. Thus, the active fragment ΔDNT exhibited the same biochemical properties as reported for the holotoxin DNT. Moreover, similarly as observed for the holotoxin but to a smaller extent microinjection of GST-DNT caused formation of stress fibers in fibroblasts. Recently, we reported that CNF1 possesses transglutaminase activity and modifies Rho GTPases in the presence of primary amines (17Schmidt G. Selzer J. Lerm M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13669-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the presence of ethylenediamine, transglutamination of RhoA by CNF caused a downward shift of the GTPase in SDS-PAGE. However, this activity of CNF was only observed at high concentrations of the primary amine and occurred slower than deamidation. Similarly as with CNF, we detected a downward shift of RhoA in SDS-PAGE after treatment with ΔDNT in the presence of ethylenediamine. The transglutamination of Rho by ΔDNT was verified by mass spectrometric analysis. To further characterize the enzyme activity of ΔDNT in more detail and to compare it with ΔCNF, we applied an ammonia release assay. Interestingly, we observed that the release of ammonia by ΔDNT was largely dependent on the presence of ethylenediamine. Almost no ammonia was released in the absence of the primary amine. Increasing concentration of ethylenediamine also increased ammonia production. In contrast, CNF-induced ammonia release was hardly changed in the presence and absence of the primary amine. These data suggest that (at least under the conditions used) DNT acts preferentially as a transglutaminase, whereas CNF behaves preferentially as a deamidase. In fact, differences in the activities of CNF and DNT are obvious from studies in intact cells. Treatment of intact cells with CNF causes an upward shift of RhoA in SDS-PAGE indicating a deamidase reaction (15Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 21Oswald E. Sugai M. Labigne A. Wu H.C. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. O'Brien A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3814-3818Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). By contrast, Horiguchi et al. (10Horiguchi Y. Inoue N. Masuda M. Kashimoto T. Katahira J. Sugimoto N. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11623-11626Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) reported that DNT caused a downward shift of Rho after treatment of cells for 1–3 h. Longer incubation of cells with DNT (e.g. for up to 6 h) resulted in an occurrence of an additional upward shift. These data can be interpreted to indicate that DNT causes preferentially a transglutamination reaction also in intact cells. Because we did not succeed in the expression of a recombinant full-length DNT preparation, which was biologically active, we are at present not able to verify this hypothesis. Because deamidation- or transglutamination-induced changes in migration of GTPases in SDS-PAGE are less pronounced with Rac and Cdc42, we used the ammonia release assay to study the substrate specificity of ΔDNT. These data indicated that all Rho GTPases including Rac and Cdc42 are modified by ΔDNT. We did not detect major differences in the ability of the various Rho proteins to serve as substrate for ΔDNT. A similar substrate specificity was recently reported for CNF1 (17Schmidt G. Selzer J. Lerm M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13669-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, we observed differences between ΔCNF1 and ΔDNT in respect to the nucleotide dependence of the deamidation/transglutamination reactions. Whereas ΔCNF1 catalyzed the deamidation reaction with a similar velocity in the presence of GDP or GTPγS-loaded RhoA, ΔDNT accepted GDP-loaded RhoA or GDP-loaded V14RhoA but did not modify GTPγS-bound RhoA or V14RhoA that is not able to hydrolyze GTP. The slight modification of GTPγS-loaded RhoA with ΔDNT and the low modification of V14RhoA GDP may be because of an incomplete exchange of the nucleotides. As binding of nucleotides largely changes the conformation of the switch II region of the GTPases, these findings suggest that the structural requirements for modification by DNT are more restricted. Another possibility would be that free nucleotides interact with the enzyme to alter its activity. In fact, a nucleotide binding motif has been described for DNT but not for CNF covering residues 1304–1311 (AFYHTGKS) with the consensus (A/G)XXXXGK(S/T) (11Pullinger G.D. Adams T.E. Mullan P.B. Garrod T.I. Lax A.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4163-4171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wilk-Blaszczak M.A. Singer W.D. Quill T. Miller B. Frost J.A. Sternweis P.C. Belardetti F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4094-4100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the relevance of this motif for DNT activity, we changed lysine 1310 to alanine. This mutation blocked ΔDNT activity as reported earlier for the holotoxin (11Pullinger G.D. Adams T.E. Mullan P.B. Garrod T.I. Lax A.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4163-4171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of lysine 1310 is not clear because this residue is not present with similar spacing in CNF1. It is conceivable that the loss in activity of the K1310A mutant is caused by structural changes of the toxin not directly involving catalysis, because K1310 is located in the vicinity of the catalytic important residue His1307. Although a putative nucleotide binding motif is present in DNT, we did not obtain evidence for a control of ΔDNT activity by direct interaction of the enzyme with nucleotides. All eukaryotic transglutaminases are characterized by a catalytic cysteine and histidine residue. Recently, we identified cysteine 866 in CNF1 as essential for deamidase and transglutaminase activity (17Schmidt G. Selzer J. Lerm M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13669-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Suggesting that a similar catalytic mechanism is functional in DNT, we changed cysteine 1292 of DNT to serine or alanine. These mutations caused inhibition of the enzyme activity indicating an essential role in catalysis. Thus, as assumed from the amino acid sequence alignment of DNT and CNF1, cysteine 1292 of DNT is functionally equivalent to cysteine 866 of CNF1. In contrast to transglutaminases, like the blood clotting factor FXIII, the activity of ΔDNT or ΔCNF was not dependent on calcium ions. Another Ca2+-independent transglutaminase was recently cloned fromStreptoverticillum (23Kanaji T. Ozaki H. Takao T. Kawajiri H. Ide H. Motoki M. Shimonishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11565-11572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The preferential transglutamination of Rho allowed studies on the GTPase activity of the cross-linked Rho protein. Gln63 of RhoA is essential for the intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTPase mechanism of the protein. Recent crystal structure analysis of Rho and Rho-GAP in a complex with a transition state analogue GDP-AlF4−explains the function of Gln63 in stabilizing the transition state of GTP hydrolysis. To this end, the nitrogen of the carboxamide group of Gln63 is bonded to the main chain carbonyl of Arg85 of Rho-GAP and to one of the fluorides of AlF4− (20Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). If Gln63 is deamidated (e.g. by CNF), this interaction with GAP is not possible resulting in the blockade of GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis (14Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 15Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). After transglutamination of Gln63, however, the pivotal nitrogen residue is still present. Therefore, we were surprised that after transglutamination both intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTPase activity of Rho were blocked. The reason for this inhibition is not entirely clear but may be based on structural changes that are the prerequisite for catalysis of GTP hydrolysis. For example, binding of Rho-GAP and subsequent activation of Rho GTPase activity are accompanied by conformational changes to allow the introduction of the catalytic Arg85 of RhoGAP into Rho (20Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). It is feasible that this interaction is hindered by transglutamination of Gln63. Further studies are underway to analyze the influence of smaller transglutaminase cosubstrates like methylamine on the GAP-stimulated and intrinsic GTPase activity of RhoA after modification with ΔDNT. In summary, we localized the enzyme domain of DNT to a C-terminal fragment covering amino acid residues 1136–1451 with cysteine 1292, histidine 1307, and lysine 1310 as essential residues. This active fragment acts as a deamidase and/or transglutaminase to modify Gln63 of Rho or Gln61 of Rac and Cdc42, respectively, and to activate the GTPases. Kinetic analysis indicates that ΔDNT acts preferentially as a transglutaminase. In contrast to ΔCNF, which effectively modifies Rho proteins in the GDP- and GTP-bound form, GDP-bound Rho proteins are the preferred substrates of ΔDNT.

S., Chernov, M. V., Chumakov, P. M., and Gudkov, A. V. (1998) Nature 391, 295–298). p33ING1belongs to a small family of proteins from human, mouse, and yeast of approximately the same size that show significant similarity to one another within the C-terminal PHD finger domain and also contain an additional N-terminal region with subtle but reliably detectable sequence conservation. Mouse ing1 is transcribed from three differently regulated promoters localized within a 4-kilobase pair region of genomic DNA. The resulting transcripts share a long common region encoded by a common exon and differ in their 5′-exon sequences. Two transcripts are translated into the same protein of 185 amino acids, the mouse equivalent of the human p33ING1, while the third transcript encodes a longer protein that has 94 additional N-terminal amino acids. Overexpression of the longer protein interferes with the accumulation of p53 protein and activation of p53-responsive promoters after DNA damage. Between the two products ofing1, only the longer one forms a complex with p53 detectable by immunoprecipitation. These results indicate that a single gene, ing1, encodes both p53-suppressing and p53-activating proteins that are regulated by alternative promoters. The human ING1 gene encodes nuclear protein p33ING1, previously shown to cooperate with p53 in cell growth control (Garkavtsev, I., Grigorian, I. A., Ossovskaya, V. S., Chernov, M. V., Chumakov, P. M., and Gudkov, A. V.

These results indicate that a single gene, ing1, encodes both p53-suppressing and p53-activating proteins that are regulated by alternative promoters. The ING1 gene was identified as a result of a functional screening of genes, the suppression of which is associated with neoplastic transformation (1Garkavtsev I. Kazarov A. Gudkov A. Riabowol K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Inhibition of ING1expression by antisense RNA promotes anchorage-independent growth in mouse breast epithelial cells, increases the frequency of focus formation in NIH 3T3 cells, and prolongs the life span of diploid human fibroblasts in culture. ING1 expression is up-regulated in senescent human fibroblasts (2Garkavtsev I. Riabowol K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2014-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and ectopic expression ofING1 cDNA leads to G1 arrest or promotes apoptosis in several cell types (3Helbing C.C. Veillette C. Riabowol K. Johnston R.N. Garkavtsev I. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1255-1258PubMed Google Scholar). The accumulated observations indicating ING1 participation in the negative regulation of cell proliferation, control of cellular aging, and apoptosis have defined ING1 as a candidate tumor suppressor gene. We have recently found that the biological effects of ING1and p53 are interrelated and require the activity of both genes. Neither of the two genes can, on its own, cause growth inhibition when the other one is suppressed (4Garkavtsev I. Grigorian I.A. Ossovskaya V.S. Chernov M.V. Chumakov P.M. Gudkov A.V. Nature. 1998; 391: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of transcription from the p21/WAF1 promoter, a key mechanism of p53-mediated growth control, depends on the expression of ING1. A physical association between p33ING1 and p53 proteins is detected by immunoprecipitation. These results indicated that p33ING1 is a component of the p53 signaling pathway and that p33ING1 cooperates with p53 in negative regulation of cell proliferation by modulating p53-dependent transcriptional activation. Despite the apparent importance of ING1 in the control of cell proliferation, our knowledge of expression, regulation, and function of this gene remains incomplete. Moreover, GenBankTM contains two ING1 mRNA sequences differing in their 5′-ends. The origin of these differences is unknown and requires explanation. So far, all of the information about the function of p33ING1 was obtained from in vitroexperiments that involved ectopic expression of ING1cDNA or its suppression by antisense RNA. The analysis of the structure of the ING1 gene and its regulation in vivo are essential steps toward the understanding of its function and involvement in developmental and physiological processes. This is particularly important due to the cooperation between ING1and p53, which suggests that the functioning of the p53 signaling pathway could be dependent on the regulation ofING1 expression. In the present work, we used the mouse ortholog of the humanING1 gene for detailed structural and expression studies, with the goal of subsequently utilizing it as a system for extensive genetic analysis. ing1 was found to be a highly evolutionarily conserved gene with complex regulation, which involves generation of alternative transcripts initiated from different promoters and translated into proteins that differ in structure and expression patterns. Moreover, these proteins have opposite effects on p53-regulated transcription, indicating that ing1 encodes two products with the properties of a putative tumor suppressor and a putative oncogene. Retroviral vector pLXSN, used for the introduction of mouse and human ING1 cDNA in NMuMG, 10(1), and ConA cells, was provided by A. Dusty Miller (5Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-986PubMed Google Scholar). Retroviral vector pLXIG was constructed on the basis of pLXSN vector by substituting SV40 promoter and neo sequences with the internal ribosome entry site of encephalomyocarditis virus (6Jang S.K. Krausslich H.G. Nicklin M.J. Duke G.M. Palmenberg A.C. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2636-2643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by the enhanced green fluorescent protein sequence (7Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar). This vector permits us to translate both the gene of interest (cloned upstream of the internal ribosome entry site) and enhanced green fluorescent protein from a single bicistronic mRNA transcribed from Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat promoter. A cDNA library from senescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts was constructed using SuperScript system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol and cloned into the λ phage λ gt22A vector. Stratagene's 129SVJ mouse genomic library cloned into the λ FIX II vector was used for the isolation of the mouse genomic, ing1-containing clones. Cultures of mouse embryonic fibroblasts were obtained from 10-day-old embryos. 10(1) cell line, a derivative of Balb/c 3T3 cells that spontaneously deleted both p53 alleles (8Harvey D.M. Levine A.J.

It carries thelacZ gene encoding β-galactosidase Escherichia coli under the control of the p53-dependent promoter and therefore allows monitoring p53 transcriptional activation by a routine X-gal staining. All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. For the serum starvation experiments, 10(1) and NMuMG cells were kept with 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 48 h (NMuMG cells) or 36 h (10(1) cells). For the contact inhibition experiments, cells cultures were used 48 h (NMuMG) or 36 h (10(1)) after they became confluent. NMuMG and 10(1) cells were irradiated with 10 grays of γ-radiation and used 24 h after treatment. Mouse embryo fibroblasts were propagated until they reached senescence. Populations of ConA cells, expressing different levels of p37ING1, were generated by transduction with pLXIG vector, carrying p37ING1 cDNA, followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting of cells with different levels of fluorescence. Organs and embryos of FVB/N mice were used for the RNA isolation and preparation of whole body sections of embryos using a cryostatic microtome for histoblot hybridization. cDNA and genomic library screenings were done according to the standard protocols (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

AP1 adaptor-specific sense primer, provided byCLONTECH, and the ing1-specific antisense primer (5′-CCATCTGACTCACGATCTGGATCTTC-3′) were used for PCR. Nested PCR was performed using AP2 adaptor-specific sense primer, provided by CLONTECH, and ing1-specific antisense primer (5′-CTGCGGATCAGGGCCCTCTGGATGC-3′). Precise determination of the 5′- and 3′-ends of the mouse ing1transcripts was done using the Marathon-2 cDNA amplification Kit based on the new SMART PCR cDNA synthesis technology (CLONTECH). It is based on the recently identified ability of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase to add several nucleotides to the 3′ terminus of first-strand cDNA during the reverse transcriptase reaction (12Chenchik A. Zhu Y.Y. Diatchenko L. Li R. Hill J. Siebert P.D. Siebert P.D. Larrick J.W. Gene Cloning and Analysis by RT-PCR. BioTechniques Books, Eaton Publishing Co., Natick, MA1998: 305-319Google Scholar). Briefly, when reverse transcriptase reaches the 5′-end of the mRNA, it switches templates and continues synthesizing the SMART template-switching oligonucleotide. The resulting single-stranded cDNA contains the complete 5′-end of the mRNA as well as the sequence complementary to the template-switching oligonucleotide and is then selectively amplified by PCR. In these experiments, poly(A) RNA preparations isolated from the thymus and testis were used. The following sequences were used for the synthesis of antisense ing1-specific primers: 5′-AGGTGTGGTGGGATCGGCAACGC-3′ (for isoform 1a), 5′-CGCGGGGAGCCAGAGCAGAGAAGGT-3′ (isoform 1c), and 5′-GGCGTGGCCTGTCATTGTCGCTG-3′ (isoform 1b). ing1-specific sense primer 5′-GCGTGCTTCTTGCTACCAT-3′ was used for the PCR amplification of the 3′-end. Sequencing was done using a Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) or done by the University of Chicago Cancer Research Center DNA Sequencing Facility. In all cases, both strands were read using multiple vector-specific or gene-specific primers. Protein sequence data base searches were performed using the gapped BLASTP program and the PSI-BLAST program that iterates the search using profiles constructed from BLAST hits as queries for subsequent iterations (13Altschul S.F.

Multiple sequence alignments were constructed using the Gibbs sampling option of the MACAW program (14Neuwald A.F. Liu J.S. Lawrence C.E.

GenBankTM accession numbers for the described sequences are AF177753–AF177757. Southern, Northern, and Western analyses were done according to standard protocols. IgG1 mouse monoclonal antibody against human recombinant p33ING1 (16Garkavtsev I. Boland D. Mai J. Wilson H. Veillette C. Riabowol K. Hybridoma. 1997; 16: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was used for the detection ofing1-encoded proteins. Anti-p53 monoclonal mouse IgG antibody Ab-1 was obtained from Calbiochem. p21 rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoprecipitation of p53 was carried out using 1 μg of DO-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 1 μg of Ab-1 (Calbiochem) antibodies per 0.5 ml of cell lysate. Cell lysate was obtained by transient transfection of the corresponding vectors by LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) into p53-negative Saos-2 cells. Each transfected plate of cells was lysed in 0.5 ml of modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate with protease inhibitor). Sepharose-protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to pull out the antibody-protein complexes, and pellets were washed four times with modified radioimmune precipitation buffer with 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Pellets were boiled in SDS-loading dye and run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blot was carried out with anti-HA-biotin antibodies, with clone 12CAS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or with anti-p53 biotinylated antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to standard protocols. Whole body sections, 20 μm thick, were prepared from frozen embryos embedded in blocks of Tissue-Tek O.C.T. and stored at −70 °C. Sections were placed on nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) to prepare histoblots as described previously (17Gudkov A.V. Kashkin K.N. Zaitsevskaya T.E. Troyanovsky S.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 44: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Histoblots were hybridized with 33P-labeled RNA probes synthesized using Ambion's MAXIscript in vitrotranscription kit. ing1-specific sense and antisense probes were synthesized on the pBLUESCRIPT plasmid with the fragment ofing1 cDNA corresponding to the PHD finger domain using T3 polymerase for the antisense and T7 polymerase for the sense probe. β-Actin antisense RNA was synthesized using the template provided by Ambion. Histoblots were incubated in prehybridization solution (0.75 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 0.75 mg/ml poly(A), 50% formamide, 0.3 mTris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5× Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 10 mm dithiothreitol) at 42 °C for 1–4 h. Hybridization was carried out for 12–24 h at 42 °C in the same solution containing 1–5 × 107 cpm of probe/ml. After hybridization, histoblots were washed in 4× SSC at room temperature for 20 min, in 2× SSC, 0.04 μg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min, in 2× SSC at 37 °C for 30 min, in 1× SSC at 60 °C for 15–30 min, and finally in 0.1× SSC at 60 °C for 15–30 min and exposed to x-ray film for 2–7 days. In order to isolate the mouse ortholog of theING1 gene, we screened a cDNA library prepared from senescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts, using human ING1 as a probe. The choice of the library was determined by the fact thatING1 is expressed at higher levels in senescent, compared with normal, human fibroblasts (2Garkavtsev I. Riabowol K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2014-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As a result, several clones were isolated, and the two longest were sequenced. The clones were identical to each other and highly similar to human ING1 through most of their length, except for the 5′-ends, which were different and not homologous to the human gene (Fig.1 A). This observation could be an indication of alternative splicing of mouse ing1; however, it could also be potentially explained by cloning artifacts that occurred during the cDNA library preparation. To determine the structure of 5′-end sequences of ing1, we used a 5′-RACE technique for the isolation of cDNA sequences corresponding to the 5′-termini of ing1 mRNA. cDNA was synthesized from mouse spleen and brain mRNA and ligated to synthetic adaptors. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using a sense primer specific for the adaptor and an antisense primer specific for the common part ofing1 located close to the divergent region. Two fragments of different size were subsequently cloned, sequenced, and compared with the clones isolated from the cDNA library. The results of this comparison are schematically presented in Fig. 1 A. One of the 5′-RACE products was identical to one of the previously isolated cDNA clones. Another product revealed the third variant ofing1 cDNA, which again consisted of common and unique regions, with the junction located at exactly the same position as in the other sequences. Fig. 1 A shows schematic alignment of the isolated mouse ing1 cDNA clones and the 5′-RACE products. All variants are identical to each other (and homologous to human ING1) up to the same nucleotide and differ only in their 5′-ends. In order to verify that the observed cDNA structure reflects naturally existing transcripts, we analyzed ing1 mRNA species by Northern hybridization using probes that represent common or specific regions of the isolated cDNAs. As shown in Fig.1 B, the probe for the common region revealed multiple transcripts in RNA isolated from mouse liver, heart, and testis. Probes specific for individual transcripts, however, showed more simple hybridization patterns, which in combination covered the whole set of transcripts found by hybridization with the common probe. These results indicated that the cloned sequences represent the majority of multiple transcripts of ing1 synthesized in the thymus and spleen. Comparison of sequences of individual cDNA clones showed differences in their 5′ regions, suggesting that ing1 has multiple alternative 5′-exons (Fig. 1). To verify this hypothesis, we determined the structure of the mouse ing1 gene. We isolated phage clones carrying sequences homologous to the mouse ing1cDNA by hybridization screening of a mouse genomic library. These clones were mapped by restriction digestion analysis, in combination with Southern blot hybridization, with the probes corresponding to the different ing1 parts. The interpretation of the results obtained is shown in Fig. 2 A. Comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences of ing1 using PCR with different ing1-specific primers (data not shown) as well as with the sequencing data showed that most of the transcribed sequences of the ing1 gene come from a single exon. Alternative 5′-ends are encoded by different exons positioned upstream from the common exon. Comparison of the sequences of cDNA and genomic clones, as well as 5′-RACE products, revealed three isoforms of mouse ing1 that differ from each other only in their 5′-ends, which also indicates that each isoform is most probably expressed from its own promoter. Southern blot hybridization analysis of ing1-related sequences in the mouse genome indicated thating1 is a single gene with no obvious close family members (data not shown). The length of the isolated cDNA clones appeared to be significantly shorter than that of the mRNA species detected by Northern hybridization (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that part of the transcribed sequences were missing from the isolated cDNAs. To determine the exact start sites of ing1 transcription, we used a new procedure called “SMART-based 5′-RACE” as described under “Materials and Methods.” Using this method, we were able to extend the cDNA sequences for the 5′-end of isoform 1b. This exon contains an extremely G/C-rich region that blocked DNA elongation during the original 5′-RACE reaction (Figs. 2 B and 3) and complicated sequencing of the final, long 5′-RACE product. Therefore, the transcription start site of isoform 1b was not precisely identified, since it was estimated based on the size of the 5′-RACE product and the analysis of the genomic sequence. Comparing the 3′-ends of human and mouse ING1 cDNAs showed that although the mouse transcript was flanked by a poly(A) stretch, its 3′-untranslated region was significantly shorter than the human one. Analysis of the genomic clone with the mouse ing1sequence revealed the presence of a long poly(A) stretch that could potentially be used as a primer-binding sequence for reverse transcription initiated from oligo(dT) primers (Fig.3 C). Moreover, the alignment with the 3′-end of the human ING1 cDNA sequence resumes downstream from this genomic poly(A) stretch. The exact end ofing1 transcription in mice was determined using the same method applied for the generation of 5′-sequences. Mouseing1 cDNA was, in fact, found to be longer than was originally thought (Figs. 2 B and 3). Sequence comparison showed that mouse and human ING1 transcripts terminate at the same point and share significant levels of similarity up to the very 3′-ends. Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the three mouse ing1 cDNA isoforms and the promoter regions for all three alternative transcripts are shown in Fig. 3. It was found that ing1 isoforms 1a and 1c have several tightly clustered transcription start sites. Sequences upstream of the initiation sites (putative promoters) lack TATA boxes, but they do contain a sequence corresponding to the loose initiator consensus PyPyAN(T/A)PyPy that includes the transcription start sites (Fig. 3). In both cases, areas upstream from the initiator are extremely GC-rich with multiple Sp1-binding sites. All of these features are typical of TATA-less promoters (18Smale S.T. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, New York1994: 63-80Google Scholar, 19Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Binding sites of inducible factors that are usually present further upstream in the promoter area (e.g. CAAT box, Oct-1 and Oct-2 binding site, NF-κB, or ATF binding site) were not found in these promoters. Transcription ofing1 isoform 1b is estimated to start approximately 30 nucleotides downstream from the TATA-like box. A putative CAAT box is present 60 nucleotides upstream from the TATA-like sequence. Since the transcription initiation sites for isoforms 1a and 1b are only about 200 base pairs apart, there is a possibility that their promoters share some of the regulatory sequences including, for example, a number of Sp1 binding sites located upstream of this area. All three alternative transcripts of mouse ing1 contain the same long open reading frame, although the sizes of the predicted proteins are different. While isoform 1b encodes a protein of 279 amino acids, the other two isoforms are predicted to encode a shorter protein product of 185 amino acids, which lacks 94 N-terminal amino acids. Translation of these two products is expected to start from the initiation codon, which is located at the beginning of the common exon. Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences with that of human p33ING1 (GenBankTM accession number AF044076) revealed high similarity between the mouse and human proteins (89% sequence identity) (Fig. 4). The nonredundant protein sequence data base at NCBI was searched using the ing1-encoded protein sequence as a query, and a highly significant sequence similarity was detected with a human paralog of p33ING1. These included three uncharacterized proteins from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and their homologue from fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (probability of the similarity being observed by chance <10−12). All of these proteins are approximately the same size and contain a C-terminal PHD finger domain (20Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 21Schindler U. Beckmann H. Cashmore A.R. Plant J. 1993; 4: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The sequence conservation in the PHD domain in these six protein sequences is striking. There are 13 invariant residues in addition to the eight metal-chelating cysteines and histidines that are conserved in all PHD fingers (Fig. 4 B). Multiple alignment analysis resulted in the delineation of an additional N-terminal region that is conserved in these proteins (Fig.4 B). This region consists of approximately 100 amino acid residues, includes two distinct conserved motifs, and shows a fairly subtle similarity that was not statistically significant in the context of the screening of the complete data base, except for the conservation between the two human paralogs. However, in the reduced search space defined by the presence of the PHD finger, it was shown that the probability of finding this level of similarity by chance was less than 10−13 for the distal motif and 10−5 for the proximal motif. We analyzed the expression of ing1 mRNA in the organs of adult mice and mouse embryos at different stages of development by Northern blot hybridization. The probe representing the common exon of the ing1 gene revealed multiple mRNA size classes that represent alternative transcripts of ing1 (Fig.5 A). Overall ing1mRNA expression is most abundant in thymus and testis. Much lower levels were detected in the rest of the tissues tested, and they also differed in the content and relative intensity of the hybridizing bands. The same pattern of ing1 mRNA expression was observed in p53-deficient mice, which showed no direct effect by p53 oning1 regulation (data not shown). In embryos, the highest expression was found on the 11th day of development and was characterized by changes in the relative expression of different classes of mRNA transcripts. Patterns of ing1 expression in embryogenesis were also checked by in situ hybridization. We used the histoblotting technique, in which embryonic sections were fixed on a nitrocellulose membrane and then hybridized with the RNA probes corresponding to the common part of the ing1 cDNA. Besides sense and antisense ing1-specific RNA probes, we also used an antisense probe for β-actin, a gene with ubiquitous expression, as an internal standard. Sections were prepared from 10-, 12-, 16-, and 18-day embryos. Results of in situ hybridization are shown in Fig. 5 C. ing1 is uniformly expressed in the whole mouse embryo at all stages of development examined. This is in agreement with the result obtained from the adult mouse tissues, whereing1 is expressed ubiquitously and at similar levels in all organs analyzed. However, in day 10 embryos, higher expression levels were observed in the yolk sac, while at day 16 and 18 of development, higher levels of expression were detected in inner compartments of bones and probably match areas of ongoing ossification. In order to determine patterns of expression of differenting1 transcripts in mouse tissues and during embryogenesis, Northern blots were hybridized with probes corresponding to the alternative start sites of ing1 (Fig. 5, A andB). Isoforms 1b and 1c were expressed ubiquitously in all adult mouse tissues tested, with the highest levels in thymus. Both isoforms were expressed in the embryos at all stages of development analyzed, with the highest levels at day 7 in the case of isoform 1c or day 11 in the case of isoform 1b. Out of all adult tissues analyzed, mRNA for isoform 1a was expressed only in testis and also in the 11-day embryo. While there is no detectable signal with the 1a-specific probe in the 7-day embryo, traces of hybridization could be detected in mRNA from day 15 and day 17 embryos, which indicates an extremely low expression level at these points of mouse embryogenesis. To check whether ing1 expression was proliferation-dependent, we analyzed RNA from two mouse cell lines, NMuMG and 10(1), at different growth conditions by Northern blot hybridization using total ing1 cDNA as a probe. ing1 expression was also compared in senescentversus young, dividing mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Results are shown in Fig. 6 A. In both cell lines, ing1 was expressed at higher levels in dividing compared with quiescent cells (quiescence is induced by serum starvation, contact inhibition, or γ-irradiation). However, in 10(1) cells the difference in expression was specific only for the uppering1 specific band, which corresponds to isoform 1b. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, ing1 was expressed at very low levels without any differences between dividing and senescent cells. ing1 expression in cell lines was also analyzed by Wester"

Although most studies have investigated this interaction by incubating cultured macrophages with monomeric lipoproteins dissolved in media, arterial wall macrophages encounter lipoproteins that are mostly bound to subendothelial extracellular matrix, and these lipoproteins are often aggregated or fused. Herein, we utilize a specialized cell-culture system to study the initial interaction of macrophages with aggregated low density lipoprotein (LDL) bound to extracellular matrix. The aggregated LDL remains extracellular for a relatively prolonged period of time and becomes lodged in invaginations in the surface of the macrophages. As expected, the degradation of the protein moiety of the LDL was very slow. Remarkably, however, hydrolysis of the cholesteryl ester (CE) moiety of the LDL was 3–7-fold higher than that of the protein moiety, in stark contrast to the situation with receptor-mediated endocytosis of acetyl-LDL. Similar results were obtained using another experimental system in which the degradation of aggregated LDL protein was delayed by LDL methylation rather than by retention on matrix. Additional experiments indicated the following properties of this interaction: (a) LDL-CE hydrolysis is catalyzed by lysosomal acid lipase; (b) neither scavenger receptors nor the LDL receptor appear necessary for the excess LDL-CE hydrolysis; and (c) LDL-CE hydrolysis in this system is resistant to cellular potassium depletion, which further distinguishes this process from receptor-mediated endocytosis. In summary, experimental systems specifically designed to mimic thein vivo interaction of arterial wall macrophages with subendothelial lipoproteins have demonstrated an initial period of prolonged cell-surface contact in which CE hydrolysis exceeds protein degradation.

In particular, the usual experimental system involves receptor-mediated endocytosis (9Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Goldstein J.L.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this light, we have established two experimental systems that attempt to mimic certain unique aspects of the early stages of encounter between macrophages and retained and aggregated lipoproteins. Using these systems, we have found that the retained and aggregated lipoproteins remain bound to the external surface of macrophages for an extended period of time and that there is a delay in the degradation of the protein moiety of the lipoproteins. Remarkably, however, CE hydrolysis proceeds at a high rate during this period and markedly exceeds the rate of protein degradation. These events, which differ from those observed with receptor-mediated endocytosis, may more accurately reflect the initial events that occur when macrophages encounter subendothelial lipoproteins in developing atherosclerotic lesions.

The lipoproteins were iodinated with 125I as follows; a solution of lipoproteins diluted to 1–2 mg/ml in 0.3 mborate buffer, pH 9.0 was placed in IODOGEN-coated tubes (Pierce), and 0.5 mCi of Na125I was added. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature with gentle agitation, the solution was transferred to a tube containing 10 μl of 0.1 m sodium bisulfite and then dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl containing 0.3 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The 125I-labeled lipoproteins, which had a specific activity of 250–400 cpm/ng protein, were used within 3 weeks of iodination. Aggregation of native or methylated LDL was induced by vortexing for 1 min at maximum setting (27Khoo J.C. Miller E. McLoughlin P. Steinberg D.

The largest aggregates were removed by centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 30 s. For the experimental system depicted in Fig. 1 A(below), monolayers of endothelial or smooth muscle cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C with DMEM, 0.2% BSA, containing 10 μg of lipoprotein lipase/ml. The cells were then rinsed with PBS and incubated for 18 h with DMEM, 0.2% BSA, containing the indicated lipoproteins. Next, the wells were rinsed five times with warm PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmMgCl2, and 0.2% BSA; the last two of these rinses lasted 15 min each and were followed by a final rinse with warm PBS. Macrophages in DMEM, 0.2% BSA containing 5 μg of 58035/ml (unless indicated) were then added at a density of 1.5 × 106cells/16-mm well. Degradation of 125I-lipoprotein protein (apo-B100) was determined from the 125I cpm of trichloroacetic acid-soluble, non-chloroform-extractable material (i.e. 125I-tyrosine) in the cell-culture medium (52Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). The cell monolayer was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH for the determination of cell-associated 125I-protein. For the assay of [3H]CE or [3H]sphingomyelin hydrolysis, cellular lipids were extracted with 1.5 ml of hexane:isopropenol (3:2 v/v) and separated by TLC, and the radioactivity in [3H]CE and [3H]cholesterol (48Tabas I.

The experimental system was set up on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslip-bottom dishes (48Tabas I. Lim S. Xu X. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fluorescence images were obtained with either a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser scanning confocal unit (Bio-Rad Microscience, Cambridge, MA) (Fig. 3) or a LSM-510 laser scanning unit (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) (Fig. 8) on an Axiovert inverted microscope using a 63×, numeric aperture 1.4 Plan-Apo infinity-corrected objective (Zeiss). For Fig. 3, the illumination sources were the 488- and 514-nm lines from a 25-milliwatt argon laser for CMFDA and DiI, respectively. For CMFDA fluorescence, a 510-nm dichroic mirror and a 515-nm long pass emission filter were used, and for DiI fluorescence, a 580-nm dichroic mirror and a 580-nm long pass emission filter were used. For Fig. 8, a 1.0-milliwatt helium/neon laser emitting at 543 nm was used, and DiI emission was collected using a 560-nm long pass filter. The images were processed with Metamorph (Universal Imaging Co) and Photoshop (Adobe) software.Figure 8Confocal fluorescence microscopy of the initial interaction of a J774 macrophage with DiI-labeled aggregated methylated LDL . J774 macrophages were incubated with DiI-labeled vortex-aggregated methylated LDL (A–C) or SMase-aggregated methylated LDL (D–F) for 20 min and then chased in medium without lipoproteins for 30 min. After viewing typical aggregate-associated cells by confocal fluorescence microscopy (A and D), the dishes were left in place on the heated microscope stage and washed and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 250 μg of trypsin/ml PBS. After acquiring this post-trypsin image of the same respective cells (B and E), the macrophages was exposed to TNBS-quenching (C andF) (see Fig. 3). Note that the orientation of the cell shown in panel D changed after trypsin treatment. In these images, which are projections of Z series, the DiI fluorescence isorange and the rest of the field, which was visualized by Nomarski differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, is shown as green (Metamorph conversion).

In this system, [3H]CE and125I-protein (apo-B100) double-labeled aggregated LDL was added to a monolayer of endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells, which served as the source of extracellular matrix. Because lipoprotein lipase has been implicated in the bridging of lipoproteins to matrix in the subendothelium (53Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 693-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we added this molecule to the endothelial or smooth muscle cell monolayer prior to the addition of the aggregated LDL. After washing away non-bound LDL aggregates, macrophages were added to this system and studied over the first few hours. We have shown previously that, after 24 h, the added macrophages internalize the matrix-bound aggregates and accumulate very large amounts of intracellular CE droplets (31Tabas I. Li Y. Brocia R.W. Wu S.W. Swenson T.L. Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20419-20432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, lipoprotein-125I-apo-B100 degradation by J774 macrophages proceeded at a rate that was relatively slow compared with that reported previously for the degradation of monomeric lipoproteins in solution by these cells (see Ref. 48Tabas I. Lim S. Xu X. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar and below). Remarkably, however, lipoprotein-[3H]CE hydrolysis occurred at a greater rate and to a greater extent than 125I-apo-B100 degradation over the time period examined. Although the absolute values varied somewhat among repeat experiments, the rate and extent of CE hydrolysis was always 3–7-fold greater than that of protein degradation. Similar results were obtained when mouse peritoneal macrophages were used instead of J774 macrophages (Fig. 2 B) and when smooth muscle cells were used as the source of matrix instead of endothelial cells (Fig. 2 C). The morphology of this interaction was investigated by confocal fluorescence microscopy. CMFDA-labeled macrophages were incubated with matrix-bound, DiI-labeled aggregated LDL. As shown in Fig.3 (a, c, ande), the macrophages (green fluorescence) were in intimate contact with the retained and aggregated LDL (redfluorescence). The images in panels b, d, andf were acquired after the addition of TNBS to the cells shown in panels a, c, and e, respectively; TNBS is a cell-impermeant quencher of DiI fluorescence (54Wolf D.E.

https://openalex.org/W2073084063,"Steady-state parameters governing cleavage of pBR322 DNA by EcoRI endonuclease are highly sensitive to ionic environment, with Km andkcat increasing 1,000-fold and 15-fold, respectively, when ionic strength is increased from 0.059 to 0.23m. By contrast, pre-steady-state analysis has shown that recognition, as well as first and second strand cleavage events that occur once the enzyme has arrived at the EcoRI site, are essentially insensitive to ionic strength, and has demonstrated that the rate-limiting step for endonuclease turnover occurs after double-strand cleavage under all conditions tested. Furthermore, processive cleavage of a pBR322 variant bearing two closely spacedEcoRI sites is governed by the same turnover number as hydrolysis of parental pBR322, which contains only a singleEcoRI sequence, ruling out slow release of the enzyme from the cleaved site or a slow conformational change subsequent to double-strand cleavage. We attribute the effects of ionic strength on steady-state parameters to nonspecific endonuclease·DNA interactions, reflecting facilitated diffusion processes, that occur prior toEcoRI sequence recognition and subsequent to DNA cleavage.

Work from several laboratories has indicated that DNA cleavage byEcoRI endonuclease proceeds by the mechanism shown in Fig.1, with double-strand cleavage proceeding via an intermediate species (E·1) containing one single-strand break within the EcoRI sequence (5Modrich P.

Chemical quench experiments have indicated that product release is rate-limiting for turnover on ColE1 and pBR322 plasmid DNAs under one set of experimental conditions (5Modrich P. Zabel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5866-5874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15King K. Benkovic S.J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11807-11815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and facilitated diffusion has been implicated in the paths by which the endonuclease locates anEcoRI sequence and departs from a cleaved site (19Jack W.E. Terry B.J. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4010-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10215-10219Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the effects of reaction parameters that are expected to affect the efficiency of facilitated diffusion have not been examined with respect to catalytic behavior of the enzyme. We have therefore systematically analyzed the kinetics of the endonuclease using steady-state and pre-steady-state methods. This work demonstrates that product release is rate-limiting for turnover at ionic strengths of 0.06–0.23 m and show that, although variation of ionic strength has dramatic effects onKm and kcat, the kinetics of events that occur at the recognition sequence are essentially insensitive to variation of this parameter. We also show that the protein remains associated with the polynucleotide product after cleavage, undergoing facilitated transfer between DNA sites so rapidly that the kcat for processive cleavage of a two-site substrate is the same as that for cleavage of an otherwise identical DNA containing a single EcoRI site. These observations indicate that the steady-state behavior of the enzyme on natural substrates is dominated by nonspecific interactions, reflecting the significance of facilitated diffusion processes in the reaction mechanism. Homogeneous EcoRI endonuclease was prepared as described previously (23Cheng S.-C. Kim R. King K. Kim S.-H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11571-11575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Covalently closed, circular pBR322 and pBR322(RI)2 (Fig. 2; see Ref. 20Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13130-13137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were isolated by published methods (5Modrich P. Zabel D. J. Biol.

PvuII-linearized pBR322 was prepared and 5′-32P-end-labeled as described previously (15King K. Benkovic S.J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11807-11815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jack W.E. Terry B.J. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4010-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Nick translation was used to prepare [32P]pBR322(RI)2. Plasmid DNA was treated with 35 units of ClaI endonuclease at 16 °C in 0.02m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.02 m NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 75 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 30 min to produce molecules bearing a single-strand break at either of the twoClaI sites present on the plasmid. Final DNA preparations contained 75–80% open circles, 20–23% covalently closed circles, and 2–4% linear molecules. These preparations were radiolabeled by nick translation in the presence of [α-32P]dTTP (25Rigby P.W.J. Dieckmann M. Rhodes C. Berg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 113: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (6965) Google Scholar), followed by closure of the single-strand break with T4 DNA ligase. Nucleic acid pellets recovered after phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation were dried briefly in vacuo and resuspended in 0.1 ml of 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.05 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA. DNA was separated from unincorporated radiolabel by gel filtration through Sephacryl S-300 equilibrated in 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.05 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. Two to 10 mol of radiolabeled dTMP were incorporated per mol of plasmid DNA, and ligation efficiencies were 88–92%. To prepare radiolabeled linear pBR322(RI)2 with both EcoRI sites located near one end (Fig. 2), nick-translated [32P]pBR322(RI)2 DNA was digested with HindIII endonuclease according to the manufacturer's instructions. Linear plasmid DNA was recovered after phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation as described above. Reactions under standard EcoRI cleavage conditions were performed at 37 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.05 mNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and DNA as indicated. Effects of NaCl on cleavage were determined in reactions containing 0.02 mTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.025–0.20m NaCl, and 5′-32P-end-labeled DNA as indicated. Cleavage was initiated by addition of 0.05 volume of diluent (5Modrich P. Zabel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5866-5874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing an appropriate amount of EcoRI endonuclease. Reactions were terminated by addition of 0.2 vol 50% (w/v) glycerol, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.05 m EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol, and products were resolved by electrophoresis through 1% agarose gels in a Tris borate buffer system. Bands were visualized by ethidium fluorescence or by autoradiography, excised, and DNA products quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Reactions containing 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.2 mmEDTA, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5′-32P-end-labeled DNA, EcoRI endonuclease, and NaCl as indicated were incubated at 37 °C until equilibrium was attained (7Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Rubin R.A. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9820-9825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage was initiated by adding reaction buffer containing MgCl2 and a 17-fold molar excess of unlabeled pBR322 DNA (relative to [32P]DNA) to yield a final MgCl2concentration of 5 mm. Reactions were terminated and products quantified as described above. Pre-steady-state chemical quench experiments with previously formed endonuclease·DNA complexes were performed by a modification of the previously described procedure (15King K. Benkovic S.J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11807-11815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a RQF-3 quench flow apparatus (KinTek Instruments). Reactant loops and mixing block were maintained at 37 °C by circulating water. Calibration was verified weekly by performing KOH-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate at 25 °C (second order rate constant kOH = 570 m−1 min−1 (26Kirsch J.F. Jencks W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 837-846Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar)). The value for kOH determined with the KinTek instrument was 538 ± 30 m−1 min−1 (one standard deviation, n = 12). Specific EcoRI·DNA complexes were formed by incubating endonuclease and [3H]pBR322 at 37 °C in 0.02m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.025–0.2 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. DNA cleavage was initiated by mixing samples (40 μl) with an equal volume of 0.01m MgCl2 in the same buffer. The final concentration of [3H]pBR322 was 1–10 nm, and final endonuclease concentrations varied between 20 and 200 nm, with higher concentrations of the two components being required to drive specific complex formation at higher ionic strengths. The component concentrations used in each experiment were based on equilibrium affinity constants determined under identical conditions (7Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Rubin R.A. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9820-9825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ensured that >97% of the plasmid DNA was bound specifically by the enzyme. Reactions were quenched by mixing with 0.5 volumes of 0.075m EDTA. Collected samples also contained an additional 140 μl of 0.075 m EDTA delivered by the quench flow apparatus during sample ejection. Quenched samples were collected in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes containing 20 μl of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate and were stored on ice until all time points had been collected. Samples were dried in vacuo, resuspended in 75 μl of 0.01m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.05% bromphenol blue, 5% glycerol (v/v), and reaction products were quantified after agarose gel electrophoresis as described above. Rate constants governing first (k2) and second (k3) strand cleavage events were estimated by nonlinear least squares regression analysis (27Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Ind. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar) using the integrated rate equations for the mechanism shown in Reaction 1 as described previously (15King K. Benkovic S.J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11807-11815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Values fork2 were obtained from fitting data for disappearance of substrate to an exponential decay mechanism. Thesek2 values were used as initial estimates in fitting data for the open circular intermediate and the linear DNA product. The reported values for k3 were obtained from analysis of the appearance of the double-strand cleaved product and did not deviate from those obtained by analysis of the formation and decay of the open circular intermediate by more than 10%. Pre-steady-state experiments were also performed by mixing an endonuclease-MgCl2 solution with [3H]pBR322. Solutions containing 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.025–0.20m NaCl, and 2–20 nm [3H]pBR322 were prewarmed to 37 °C, after which DNA cleavage was initiated by mixing samples (40 μl) with an equal volume of a solution containing 0.01 m MgCl2 and EcoRI endonuclease in the same buffer. Enzyme samples were prepared for each time point by diluting endonuclease to the appropriate concentration using prewarmed reaction buffer immediately prior to the mixing experiment. To ensure that second order effects were not limiting the rate of cleavage, the endonuclease concentration was increased until no further change in reaction rate was observed. Zero time points were obtained by mixing quenching reagent with the reaction mixture before addition ofEcoRI endonuclease, while end points were determined by allowing the reactions to proceed for 30 s, by which time cleavage was complete. Reaction products were resolved on 1% agarose gels and quantified as described above. Steady-state DNA cleavage was assayed at 37 °C. EcoRI endonuclease (0.1 mol of enzyme dimer/mol of plasmid) was added to prewarmed solutions containing 2–5 nm HindIII-linearized [32P]pBR322(RI)2 DNA in 0.02 mTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.05–0.15 m NaCl, 0.2 mmEDTA, and 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min to allow specific complex formation, cleavage was initiated by adding an equal volume of prewarmed buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 20–50 nm unlabeled pBR322(RI)2 DNA (10 mol of unlabeled DNA/mol of radiolabeled DNA). Samples (20 μl) were removed as a function of time and mixed with 5 μl of a reaction quench solution as described above. Reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels in a Tris borate buffer system. Radiolabeled DNA bands were visualized by autoradiography, excised, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting as described above. Specific radioactivities of the reaction products were determined by allowing cleavage to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C, by which time all the substrate was cleaved. The large DNA fragments (4477 and 4528 bp)1 produced by cleavage ofHindIII-linearized pBR322(RI)2 at either or bothEcoRI sites were not resolved from one another or from unreacted substrate under these conditions. However, the amount of substrate consumed during cleavage reactions is equal to the sum of the amounts of 80- and 29-bp fragments produced. Steady-state turnover numbers governing endonucleolytic attack onHindIII-linearized pBR322(RI)2(kcat) were calculated according to the relationship: kcat =Vmax/[Ea], whereVmax was estimated as the initial rate of product formation at substrate concentrations at least 10 times theKm value (Fig. 4). The quantity of active endonuclease ([Ea]) was determined as described previously (7Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Rubin R.A. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9820-9825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and was typically 92%. Initial rates of product formation (Vmax) were calculated as the sum of initial rates of appearance of the 80-bp fragment produced by single site cleavage at the more central EcoRI site (V80) and the 29-bp fragment produced either by single site cleavage at the more terminal EcoRI site or by processive cleavage at both sites (V29; see Fig.2). Vmax values calculated in this manner thus include contributions from both nonprocessive and processive turnovers (see “Results”). Rate constants for generation of the 51-bp DNA fragment by processive cleavage at both EcoRI sites onHindIII-linearized pBR322(RI)2(kproc, see Fig.2) were calculated according to the relationship: kproc =V51/fp[Ea], where kproc is the rate constant for processive turnover, V51 is the initial rate of formation of the 51-bp fragment at concentrations of substrate that were approximately saturating, and fp is the fraction of cleaved DNA molecules undergoing processive cleavage at bothEcoRI sites. The factor fp is an experimentally determined value for the fraction of enzyme molecules that participate in processive cleavage, which is limited to a maximum of 0.5 on linear substrates (20Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13130-13137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Values for fpwere calculated as described by Terry et al. (20Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13130-13137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the following equation,fp=V51/(V80+V29),(Eq. 1) where fp is the fraction of cleaved molecules that have participated in processive events andV51, V80, andV29 are the initial rates of formation of the 51-, 80-, and 29-bp cleavage products. The equilibrium affinity of EcoRI endonuclease for its recognition sequence (7Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Rubin R.A. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Participation of Outside DNA Sequences in the EcoRI Endonuclease Reaction Pathway Ph.D. thesis. Duke University, Durham, NC1983Google Scholar) are highly dependent on ionic strength. Fig. 3 demonstrates that salt concentration also has a dramatic effect on the steady-state parameters that govern cleavage of pBR322 DNA. An increase in the NaCl concentration from 0.025 to 0.2 m (ionic strength of 0.059–0.23 m) results in a 1,000-fold increase in theKm for pBR322 and an increase inkcat of about 15-fold. The endonuclease is thus unusual in the sense that optimal ionic conditions for cleavage are dependent on substrate concentration. This can be seen by considering the effects of ionic strength at the extremes of substrate concentration, i.e. [DNA] → 0 and [DNA] → ∞. At dilute DNA concentrations, where velocity is proportional to thekcat/Km ratio, the rate of cleavage will be highest at low salt concentration becauseKm decreases more rapidly with decreasing ionic strength than does kcat. However, at high DNA concentration where rate is kcat-limited, the cleavage rate will be highest at high ionic strength becausekcat increases with salt concentration. The significance of these effects in terms of mechanism will be considered below. For purposes of pre-steady-state analysis, the mechanism shown in Fig. 1 may be simplified to that shown in Reaction 1.E+S⇌k−1k1E·S→k2E·1→k3E·2(Reaction 1) This simplification is valid for pBR322 because theE·1 intermediate does not dissociate with this DNA (16Rubin R.A. Modrich P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 2991-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,18Langowski J. Urbanke C. Pingoud A. Maass G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3483-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Jack W.E. Participation of Outside DNA Sequences in the EcoRI Endonuclease Reaction Pathway Ph.D. thesis. Duke University, Durham, NC1983Google Scholar). A previous chemical quench flow analysis has indicated that this scheme is an adequate representation of the mechanism (15King K. Benkovic S.J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11807-11815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since this previous study was restricted to analysis of the fate of preformedE·S complexes at a single ionic strength, we have extended this analysis to a range of NaCl concentrations using two mixing protocols. In the first, preformed endonuclease·pBR322 complexes were mixed with a MgCl2 solution, whereas in the alternate protocol DNA was mixed with a solution of endonuclease and MgCl2. The former method bypasses steps occurring prior to specific complex formation, whereas the rate of first strand cleavage in the latter protocol can potentially be limited by enzyme-DNA association, or by other slow steps on the path to specific complex formation. Fig. 4 shows an example of pre-steady-state cleavage of endonuclease·pBR322 complexes formed prior to initiation of DNA cleavage by addition of MgCl2. The fit of the data to a two-step mechanism is excellent, with the only notable deviation occurring late in the reaction and reflecting persistence of a small amount of the open circular intermediate species. 2At high ratios of endonuclease to DNA, we have observed the accumulation of DNA molecules bearing a single-strand break at the EcoRI site that are resistant to further cleavage (data not shown). Production of this species was observed in experiments performed by either mixing protocol, and the fraction of input DNA converted to this species depended on the ratio of enzyme to DNA, but not on the absolute concentrations of either component. At an enzyme dimer to DNA ratio of 250:1, this species accounted for 48% of all cleaved DNA. This probably reflects low level contamination (<1% by weight) of our EcoRI endonuclease preparations withEcoRI methylase, since it has been shown that the endonuclease will catalyze low efficiency introduction of a single-strand break into the unmethylated strand of a hemimethylatedEcoRI site (30Lesser D.R. Kurpiewski M.R. Jen-Jacobson L. Science. 1990; 250: 776-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Since the methylase cofactor, S-adenosylmethionine, copurifies with EcoRI methylase during enzyme isolation (23Cheng S.-C. Kim R. King K. Kim S.-H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11571-11575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), contaminating methylase is able to catalyze methyl transfer under the conditions employed for endonuclease assays. Such contamination is difficult to quantitate because the endonuclease forms high affinity complexes withEcoRI sites under the conditions used for the methylase assay, leading to an underestimate of the amount of methylase present. We have minimized this problem by performing all single turnover DNA cleavage experiments at an endonuclease to DNA ratio of 20:1 or less, conditions that result in accumulation of DNA molecules resistant to second strand cleavage at a level <10% of input DNA. We conclude that double-strand cleavage occurring within previously formed site-specific complexes can be described by the two step mechanism described above. Essentially identical results were obtained when enzyme was mixed with DNA, provided that concentrations of DNA and enzyme were chosen so that association of the endonuclease with the EcoRI site of the plasmid was not rate-limiting. The latter requirement restricted analysis under these mixing conditions to [NaCl] concentrations of 0.025–0.1 m (Table I). Over this concentration range, rate constants for first and second strand cleavage events were found to be independent of mixing protocol (Table I), ruling out a slow first order step necessary to produce a cleavage-competent endonuclease·DNA complex once the enzyme has located the EcoRI site. Furthermore, as summarized in Table I, rate constants governing the two strand cleavage steps are essentially insensitive to [NaCl] in the range of 0.025–0.2m. Increasing ionic strength from 0.059 m to 0.23 m resulted in only a 25% decrease in the rate of first strand cleavage, whereas the rate of second strand cleavage was not significantly affected. In all cases strand cleavage rate constants are much larger than kcat.Table IRate constants for first and second strand cleavage of pBR322 by EcoRI[NaCl]Ionic strengthE·SE + Skcatk2k3k2k3mms−1s−1s−10.0250.0592.7 ± 0.261.6 ± 0.102.5 ± 0.261.6 ± 0.160.0120.050.0862.6 ± 0.201.6 ± 0.142.5 ± 0.101.6 ± 0.140.0140.100.132.5 ± 0.201.6 ± 0.262.4 ± 0.261.5 ± 0.160.0350.150.182.2 ± 0.201.5 ± 0.14NDND0.0770.200.231.9 ± 0.241.4 ± 0.16NDND0.22Pre-steady-state DNA cleavage as a function of NaCl concentration was performed and data analyzed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Reactions were initiated by mixing MgCl2 with previously formed endonuclease·pBR322 complexes (E·S) or by mixing pBR322 with an endonuclease MgCl2 solution (E + S).

Comparison of pre-steady-state and steady-state results suggest that the rate-limiting step for endonuclease turnover occurs subsequent to sequence recognition and chemistry at all ionic strengths tested, predicting occurrence of a pre-steady-state burst of double-strand cleavage due to rapid formation of E·2 prior to the rate-limiting step. This was confirmed (Table II), although the yield was significantly less than 1 mol of double-strand breaks per mol of endonuclease dimer under all conditions tested despite that fact that DNA concentrations used were at least 5 times the Km value in all cases.Table IIPre-steady-state burst during EcoRI cleavage of pBR322Reaction conditionsIonic strengthPre-steady-state burstmmol/mol EoStandard EcoRI buffer0.130.690.025m NaCl0.0590.530.10 mNaCl0.130.640.20 mNaCl0.230.33DNA cleavage was initiated by addition of EcoRI endonuclease to reaction mixtures (see “Materials and Methods”) pre-equilibrated at 37 °C.

Here, we demonstrate that a previously defined arginine-rich nuclear localization signal (NLS) present in Tap acts exclusively via the transportin import factor. Previously, transportin has been shown to mediate the nuclear import of several heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1, by binding to a sequence element termed M9. Although the Tap NLS and the hnRNP A1 M9 element are shown to compete for transportin binding, they show no sequence homology, and the Tap NLS does not conform to the recently defined M9 consensus. The Tap NLS also differs from M9 in that only the latter is able to act as a nuclear export signal. The Tap NLS is therefore the first member of a novel class of transportin-specific NLSs that lack nuclear export signal function.

Although the mechanisms governing the nuclear export of noncoding RNAs are becoming increasingly well understood, the pathway(s) utilized for nuclear export of mRNA molecules has yet to be defined and appears likely to be subject to complex regulation (reviewed in Ref.1Stutz F. Rosbash M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3303-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). At least two possible protein mediators of mRNA export exist.

Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The hnRNPs associate with nuclear pre-mRNAs and mRNAs and a subset of the hnRNPs including hnRNP A1, then accompany mature mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where they are released (3Piñol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 4Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is not passive, in that many hnRNPs contain not only a nuclear localization signal (NLS) but also a nuclear export signal (NES) (5Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 6Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In the case of hnRNP A1, these functions are both encoded within a short sequence element termed M9 (see Fig. 1), and exhaustive analysis has failed to separate NLS from NES function (6Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 7Bogerd H.P. Benson R.E. Truant R. Herold A. Phingbodhipakkiya M. Cullen B.R. J. Biol.

Efforts to define the cellular proteins that mediate M9 NLS function led to the identification of the transportin (Trn) nuclear import factor, a member of the importin β (Imp β) family of nucleocytoplasmic transport factors (8Pollard V.W.

Surprisingly, however, several lines of evidence suggest that M9 NES function is not mediated by Trn, and the nuclear receptor for this NES therefore remains to be defined (7Bogerd H.P. Benson R.E.

Tap has been shown to bind the retroviral constitutive transport element (CTE) RNA target sequence and to mediate the nuclear export of mRNAs bearing the CTE (13Bray M. Prasad S. Dubay J.W. Hunter E.

Several lines of evidence suggest that Tap may also be a critical component of general mRNA export. Thus, microinjection of high levels of CTE RNA into Xenopusoocyte nuclei selectively inhibits all mRNA export, and this inhibition can be rescued by microinjection of recombinant human Tap (14Grüter P.

Genetic analysis in yeast has demonstrated that Mex67p, the yeast homolog of Tap, is critical for the nuclear export of poly(A)+ RNA (19Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. Lührmann R. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Expression in yeast of human Tap together with a second human protein termed p15, which may be a Tap cofactor, rescues both nuclear poly(A)+ RNA export and cell viability in yeast cells lacking Mex67p (20Katahira J. Sträβer Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). It has therefore been proposed that Tap is a critical component of an evolutionarily conserved nuclear mRNA export pathway (20Katahira J. Sträβer Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar).Experimental analysis has led to the identification of several functional domains in Tap (14Grüter P.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). An RNA binding domain, which is necessary and sufficient for specific binding to the CTE RNA target, extends from approximately residues 80 to 372 in the 619-amino acid Tap protein (see Fig. 1) (14Grüter P.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). At the C terminus of Tap is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle domain that is critical for Tap-dependent CTE RNA export (16Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This NLS/NES element, which has been recently shown to directly interact with the FG-repeat domain of nucleoporin Can/Nup214 (20Katahira J. Sträβer Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), may serve to target Tap, together with any bound RNA cargo, to the nuclear pore. Importantly, the Tap NLS/NES has no homology to the hnRNP A1 M9 sequence and does not interact with Trn in our hands (data not shown). Last, Tap also contains an NLS, located between residues 61 and 102 (Fig.1), that contains 10 arginine residues yet lacks any lysine residues (16Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 20Katahira J. Sträβer Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Because lysine is critical for binding to the Importin α (Imp α) nuclear import receptor (21Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), the Tap NLS, despite its overall positive charge, nevertheless appears unlikely to be functionally similar to Imp α-dependent basic NLSs.In this manuscript, we demonstrate that nuclear import of substrates bearing the Tap NLS is independent of both Imp α and Imp β and is instead exclusively mediated by Trn. Although the Tap NLS binds Trn specifically in vitro, this interaction is disrupted by Ran·GTP, as is expected for a functionally relevant import receptor interaction (11Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Although the M9 NLS and the Tap NLS show no sequence homology, they do compete for binding to Trn. However, whereas M9 also functions as an NES, the Tap NLS lacks any detectable NES activity. The Tap NLS is therefore the first example of a novel type of basic NLS that is Trn-dependent.MATERIALS AND METHODSRecombinant Protein Expression and PurificationAll recombinant import factors and import substrates were expressed in bacteria as glutathione S-transferase (GST) or maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins and then purified as described previously (22Truant R. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Bogerd H. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Imp α, Imp β, and Ran were cleaved from their fusion partner during purification whereas Trn was used as an MBP fusion protein. All import substrate proteins were used as GST fusions, and all were labeled with FITC (FLUOS) following the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).In Vitro Nuclear Uptake AssaysPeptide competition assays for nuclear uptake were performed essentially as described previously (23Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R.E. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar) using digitonin-permeabilized coverslip-grown HeLa cells. The SV40 T antigen NLS (T-NLS) peptide, the Imp α IBB peptide, and the HIV-1 Tat NLS peptide have been described (23Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The M9 peptide comprises amino acids 264 to 288 of human hnRNP A1 protein (NH2-GNYNNQSSNFGPMKGGNFGGRSSGP-COOH). The G274A M9 mutant peptide is identical except for the substitution of alanine for the underlined glycine at residue 274 (6Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). All peptides were soluble in PBS and were used at an ∼80-fold molar excess over the FITC-labeled substrate concentration (1 μm) for competition experiments. The cytosol source for the competition assays was rabbit reticulocyte lysate, untreated (Promega), supplemented with an ATP regeneration system and 0.1 mm GTP. All reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min and then fixed on ice with 2% formaldehyde, PBS.Reconstituted nuclear uptake assays used digitonin-permeabilized spinner-grown HeLa cells and were performed essentially as described previously (22Truant R. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Bogerd H. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear uptake reactions contained 2 μm FITC-labeled substrate, 1 μm each import factor as noted (Imp α, Imp β, MBP-Trn, Ran), and an ATP regeneration system with nucleotides. For uptake assays in the absence of nucleotide hydrolysis, residual NTPs were depleted using 20 units/ml hexokinase (Sigma), 1 mm glucose, and 20 μmADP. Nucleotide analogs AMP-PNP and GMP-PNP (Sigma) were used at 1 mm final concentration. After incubation at 25 °C for 20 min, the permeabilized cells were washed with 100 μl of ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 100 μl of cold PBS, spun down onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips in 1 ml of cold 2% formaldehyde, PBS, and then fixed on ice for 20 min. The fixed cells were then treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and inverted onto an 8-μl drop of mounting agent (Flouromount G, Southern Biotechnology). Images were digitally captured with a Leica DMRB fluorescence microscope and converted to grayscale with Adobe Photoshop 4.0 software.Protein Micro-affinity ChromatographyProtein affinity chromatography experiments were conducted as described previously (22Truant R. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Bogerd H. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,23Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the same GST-Tap-N-NLS proteins (unlabeled) used for nuclear uptake assays. Proteins were coupled at 3 mg/ml concentration on Affi-Gel 10 active ester-agarose beads (Bio-Rad) and packed into 10-μl columns in 100-μl borosilicate glass micropipets (Drummond). 2 μg of an import factor protein (Imp α, Imp β, or MBP-Trn) was then loaded in a 50-μl total volume of ACB buffer (50 mmNaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mmdithiothreitol). Column washes were carried out with 50 μl of ACB buffer. Columns were finally eluted (bound fractions) with 50 μl of 500 mm magnesium chloride in ACB buffer. The entire flow-through and bound fractions from each column were mixed with sample-loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10–20% gradient gels (ReadyGel, Bio-Rad) and then Coomassie-stained (R-250, Life Technologies, Inc.). Ran·GTP release assays were carried out using Recombinant RanQ69L, GST-Tap-N-NLS protein, GTP or GDP, and glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), essentially as described elsewhere (7Bogerd H.P.

The resultant PCR DNA fragments were digested with BamHI andXhoI restriction enzymes and ligated intoBamHI-XhoI-digested pβ-Gal/Nab2 (22Truant R. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Bogerd H. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmids express the M9 or Tap-N-NLS fused to the C terminus of β-Gal.Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling AssaysThe heterokaryon assay was carried out essentially as described previously (6Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Human HeLa and mouse NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding β-Gal fused to M9 or the Tap-N-NLS using the FuGene reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), following the manufacturer's protocol. At 36 h post-transfection, HeLa cells were mixed with mouse 3T3 cells in a 2:3 ratio, seeded onto glass coverslips at 5 × 105 cells/coverslip, and further incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were then treated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) for 3 h, fused using 50% polyethylene glycol (PEG 3350, Sigma) for 2.5 min, then incubated for another 2 h at 37 °C in medium containing cycloheximide. Cells were then fixed and permeabilized as described previously (25Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The β-Gal fusion proteins were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence using a primary mouse monoclonal anti-β-Gal antibody (Promega) and a secondary rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Cappel). Hoechst dye 33258 (Sigma) was included at 1 μg/ml with the secondary antibody incubation. Images were digitally captured with a Leica DMRB fluorescence microscope under the 100× objective and visualized using Adobe Photoshop 4.0 software.HeLa cells were maintained and microinjected as described previously (7Bogerd H.P. Benson R.E. Truant R. Herold A. Phingbodhipakkiya M. Cullen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9771-9777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 days before microinjection, HeLa cells were seeded onto CELLocate microgrid coverslips (Eppendorf Scientific) at a density of 2 × 105/35-mm dish. To increase the prevalence of multinucleated cells, cultures were serum-starved overnight and then refed with serum-containing media 4–6 h before injection. A recombinant fusion protein consisting of MBP fused to the M9 NLS/NES was expressed and purified as described previously (22Truant R. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Bogerd H. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). GST-Tap-N-NLS (final concentration in PBS, ∼2 μg/μl) was mixed with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated MBP-M9 (final concentration in PBS, ∼1.5 μg/μl) and then co-injected into either one nucleus of a multinucleated cell or into the cell cytoplasm. After injection, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The GST-Tap-N-NLS fusion protein was detected by indirect immunofluorescence using a polyclonal affinity-purified rabbit anti-GST antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antiserum (Jackson Immunoresearch). The subcellular localization of the injected proteins was visualized as described above.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTransportin Is Necessary and Sufficient to Mediate Tap N-NLS-dependent Nuclear ImportPreviously, we and others demonstrated that the human Tap nuclear RNA export factor contains an NLS, located between residues 61 and 102 of the 619-amino acid Tap protein, that is able to induce the nuclear localization of both a GST and a green fluorescent protein fusion in human cells (16Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar,20Katahira J. Sträβer Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, we examined whether the Tap N-NLS can also mediate the nuclear uptake of recombinant protein substrates in vitro and also whether known peptide binding targets for selected nuclear import factors would be able to competitively inhibit this nuclear uptake when present in excess. The inhibitors chosen were the IBB, which represents the site on Imp α that binds to Imp β (26Görlich D. Henklein P. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1810-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 27Weis K. Ryder U. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1818-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the SV40 T-NLS, which binds to Imp α directly (28Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and the M9 NLS/NES, which binds to Trn (8Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Naklelny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G.

An M9 mutant peptide that differs from M9 at only one residue (Gly-274 to Ala) yet lacks both NLS function and Trn binding ability served as a negative control.Figure 2Competitive nuclear import assays. Nuclear import assays were performed using digitonin-permeabilized, coverslip-grown HeLa cells in the presence of rabbit reticulocyte (Retic) lysate as a source of native nuclear import factors. The FITC-labeled substrate GST fusion proteins analyzed are given at the left. Competitor peptides were added at an ∼80-fold molar excess and are listed at the top of the figure. Nuclear uptake assays were performed at 25 °C for 20 min, and the nuclei were then fixed and analyzed for nuclear import using a fluorescence microscope.

As shown in Fig. 2, panels Athrough D, all four substrates were imported into isolated HeLa cell nuclei in vitro upon addition of reticulocyte lysate as a source of native import factors. The addition of the IBB peptide blocked both SV40 T-NLS function and HIV-1 Tat NLS function but did not affect M9 or Tap N-NLS uptake (panels E toH). The IBB peptide competes the binding of Imp α by Imp β (26Görlich D. Henklein P. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1810-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 27Weis K. Ryder U. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1818-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and, therefore, is expected to block uptake of Imp α-dependent NLSs such as the SV40 T-NLS (28Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Although the Tat NLS directly interacts with Imp β, this is also competed by IBB (23Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).As predicted, an excess of the SV40 T-NLS peptide blocked SV40 T-NLS-dependent nuclear import, presumably by competing for Imp α binding, but did not affect the Tat NLS, which binds Imp β directly (23Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or the M9 NLS, which binds Trn (8Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Naklelny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G.

Finally, the wild-type M9 peptide, which directly binds to Trn (8Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Naklelny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G.

This inhibition was specific in that the M9 peptide did not, as predicted, affect SV40 T-NLS- or HIV-1 Tat NLS-dependent nuclear import, whereas the G274A mutant M9 peptide, which differs at only one residue yet lacks Trn binding (6Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 7Bogerd H.P. Benson R.E. Truant R. Herold A. Phingbodhipakkiya M. Cullen B.R. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), failed to compete (panels Q to T). Based on this result, it appeared that Tap N-NLS function requires binding to Trn at a site that overlaps with the M9 binding site.We next asked whether Trn was not only necessary but also sufficient for Tap N-NLS function. As shown in Fig.3 A, recombinant Trn, when added to a transport buffer containing Ran, ATP, and GTP, was indeed able to mediate the in vitro nuclear uptake of not only a GST-M9 fusion protein but also a similar GST-Tap-N-NLS fusion protein. In contrast, a combination of Imp α and Imp β could mediate the nuclear uptake of a GST-T-NLS fusion but failed to induce the nuclear localization of either Trn-dependent NLS chimera.Figure 3Trn is sufficient for Tap-N-NLS-dependent nuclear import in vitro. A, suspension-grown HeLa cells were permeabilized using digitonin and then pelleted through a sucrose cushion (22Truant R. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Bogerd H. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Reconstituted nuclear import assays were performed in the presence of a buffer containing Ran, an ATP regeneration system, 10 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm GTP. The recombinant transport factors listed at the top were added at a ∼1 μm concentration, whereas the FITC-labeled GST fusion proteins listed at the left were added at an ∼2 μmconcentration. After incubation at 25 °C for 20 min, the permeabilized cells were fixed and analyzed for nuclear import by fluorescence microscopy. B, panel a is identical to panel j in Fig. 3 A. In panel b, no Ran has been added. In panel c, 5 μm Ran Q69L mutant has been added. In panel d, the 0.1 mmGTP has been substituted with 1 mm GMP-PNP. In panel e, the 10 mm ATP has additionally been substituted with 1 mm AMP-PNP, whereas 20 units/ml hexokinase, 1 mm glucose, and 20 μm ADP have been added to deplete any endogenous nucleotide triphosphates (29Englmeier L.

https://openalex.org/W2088228065,"PrPC, the normal isoform of the prion component PrPSc, is a 33–35-kDa glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein expressed in the plasma membrane of many cells and especially in the brain. The specific role of PrPC is unknown, although lately it has been shown to bind copper specifically. We show here that PrPC is present even in mature sperm cells, a polarized cell that retains only the minimal components required for DNA delivery, movement, and energy production. As opposed to PrPC in other cells, PrP in ejaculated sperm cells was truncated in its C terminus in the vicinity of residue 200. Sperm PrP, although membrane-bound, was not released by phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C as well as not localized in cholesterol-rich microdomains (rafts). Although no infertility was reported for PrP-ablated mice in normal situations, our results suggest that sperm cells originating from PrP-ablated mice were significantly more susceptible to high copper concentrations than sperm from wild type mice, allocating a protective role for PrP in specific stress situations related to copper toxicity. Since the functions performed by proteins in sperm cells are limited, these cells may constitute an ideal system to elucidate the function of PrPC.

PrPC is the normal isoform of PrPSc, the protein that is believed to be the major if not the only component of the prion (1Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 337-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Prions cause transmissible neurodegenerative diseases such as scrapie in sheep and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) 1The abbreviations used are:BSEbovine spongiform encephalopathyGPIglycophosphatidylinositolPIPLCphosphatidylinositol phospholipase Cwtwild typemAbmonoclonal antibody1The abbreviations used are:BSEbovine spongiform encephalopathyGPIglycophosphatidylinositolPIPLCphosphatidylinositol phospholipase Cwtwild typemAbmonoclonal antibody in cattle, which may have transmitted to humans as VCJD (2Ironside J.W.

Both PrP isoforms share the same amino acid sequence but, in contrast to PrPC, PrPSc is relatively resistant to digestion by proteases and contains a considerable amount of β-sheet structures insoluble in nondenaturing detergents (3Caughey B.W.

It has been postulated that PrPSc is produced from PrPC by a conformational conversion process that is not fully understood.The function of PrPC, a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored glycoprotein, remains elusive albeit the creation and investigation of several lines of PrP0/0 mice (5Bueler H.

These mice are immune to infection by prions, and none of them develop prion-like disease (7Bueler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C.

However, each line of PrP0/0mice displays diverse phenotypes that, although not severe or fatal, are reminiscent of prion disease symptoms (9Collinge J. Whittington M.A. Sidle K.C. Smith C.J.

Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7185-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), but the significance of this finding remains to be established. As most GPI-anchored proteins, both PrP isoforms are associated with cholesterol-rich membranal microdomains, denominated rafts (14Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avrahami D. Laszlo L. Prusiner S.B. Avraham D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In an effort to elucidate the function of PrPC, we decided to look for its expression in cells that perform only limited functions, such as sperm cells.During spermiogenesis, spermatocytes differentiate into sperm in a process in which the Golgi develops into the large acrosome and mitochondria migrate from the rest of the cytoplasm to form a tightly wrapped sheet around the upper part of the flagellum (15Overstreet J.W. Blazak W.F. Am. J. Ind. Med. 1983; 4: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 16Breucker H. Schafer E. Holstein A.F. Cell Tissue Res. 1985; 240: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After the excess cell cytoplasm is pinched off, the sperm cell only carries with it an acrosome containing enzymes required for the penetration of the membranes covering the egg, as well as those other cellular components essential to provide energy for its movement. Sperm cell become independently motile following an additional maturation step that occurs during their passage through the epididymis and are considered fully mature in ejaculates (17Moore H.D. Andrologia. 1998; 30: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). There is no de novo protein synthesis in mature sperm cells, and therefore changes occurring in protein patterns are due either to protein degradation or protein processing during sperm maturation.In this work we studied the properties of PrP in sperm cells from several species during different stages of maturation. For practical reasons, we only obtained sperm ejaculates containing mature sperm cells from cattle and human, whereas sperm cells isolated from the epididymis (semi-mature) were available from cattle and rodents. Our results show that during the process of sperm maturation, PrPC changes from its regular rafts-associated, GPI-anchored structure to a unique C-terminal-truncated peptide devoid of a GPI group and, as a result of that, is not released from the cell surface by phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (PIPLC). In addition, mature sperm PrP was not longer associated with membranal rafts. Our results also suggest that sperm cells from PrP-ablated mice were more susceptible to copper-induced toxicity than sperm cells from wt mice, although no difference in the motility or survival could be identified when comparing these cells at control conditions. Sperm cells may be the ideal system to investigate whether a protective role against copper toxicity-induced stress situations can be attributed to PrPC.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTissue SamplesHuman ejaculated semen samples were obtained from the laboratory for human fertility in the Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem. The samples received for our experiments tested in the fertility laboratory as normal regarding morphology and motility. Bovine ejaculated semen samples were received from an Israeli company for artificial insemination of cattle.Hamster, mouse, or bovine epididymal sperm samples were obtained by mincing epididymis in saline and subsequently collecting floating cells from the saline suspension as described (18Tash J.S. Bracho G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Samples were looked upon by light microscopy to ensure that most cells are indeed differentiated sperm cells. Hamster nondifferentiated spermatocytes were obtained by a similar procedure, using testis instead of epididymis.Preparation of Cells for Immunoblotting107N2a-C10 cells (an N2a clone expressing a chimeric mouse/hamster PrP or sperm cells reacting with αPrP mAb 3F4(19)) were extracted in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonident P-40. The samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were concentrated by methanol precipitation.Flotation AssayFlotation of detergent-insoluble complexes was performed as described by Naslavsky et al. (19Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A.

Briefly, 100–150 mg of cerebellum or appropriate cells were homogenized in 700 μl of an ice-cold buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100. Insoluble particles were spun down for 5 min at 2000 rpm, 4 °C, and the lysate was loaded at the bottom of Beckman Instruments TLS-55 ultracentrifuge tubes. An equal volume of ice-cold 70% Nycodenz in TNE (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) was added and mixed with the lysate. A 8–35% Nycodenz linear step gradient in TNE was then overlaid above the lysate. The tubes were spun at 55,000 rpm for 4 h at 4 °C in a TLS-55 rotor (200,000 ×g). Fractions of 180 μl each were collected from the top to the bottom of the tube and immunoblotted with the appropriate αPrP antibody.Copper Sensitivity AssayFVB or PrP0/0epididymal sperm cells were resuspended in activation buffer as described (18Tash J.S.

After a 10-min incubation in the activation buffer, sperm cells were separated into 3 wells, to which 0, 50, or 100 μg/ml CuCl2 was added. Every 5 min the percentage of motile to nonmotile cells were established in each of the samples. 100% motile cells represent the percentage of motile cells at time zero for the sample without copper.RESULTSFig. 1 shows anti PrP immunoblots of sperm cells extracts, either mature (human, bovine) or from the epididymis (hamster, mouse, and bovine), as compared with brain membranes of the same species. The antibodies used were 3F4 (directed against residues 108–111) for human and hamsters (20Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 6H4 (“Prionics,” directed against residues 144–152) for bovine samples, 1E (against residue 200 in humans and mice) (21Gabizon R. Telling G. Meiner Z. Halimi M. Kahana I. Prusiner S.B. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and R073 (polyclonal anti-PrP antisera reacting mostly against mouse and hamster PrP (22Serban D. Taraboulos A. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Neurology. 1990; 40: 110-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The molecular weight of PrP in semi-mature (epididymis) sperm cells was similar to that of the brain, whereas in mature sperm cells obtained from ejaculates, it appears as if the apparentMr of PrP was reduced to 24,000. The fact that such a large panel of polyclonal and monoclonal α PrP antisera reacted with the same bands confirms that this is indeed PrP.To test whether the reduced molecular weight of PrP in mature sperm, as compared with epididymal sperm cells and brain samples, is due to a different N-glycosylation pattern of the PrP protein in these cells, human and hamster brain and sperm samples were deglycosylated by endoglycosidase F (Fig.2). The deglycosylated and control samples were subsequently immunoblotted with mAb 3F4. The full-size mature PrP peptide (residues 23–231) encloses twoN-glycosylation sites at residues 181 and 197 and a GPI anchor at its C-terminal (23Kretzschmar H.A. Stowring L.E. Westaway D.

Cell. 1987; 51: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Endoglycosidase F deglycosylation of brain PrPC resulted in a major band of an apparentMr of about 26,000, whereas faint additional bands representing either partial deglycosylation or degradation products of PrPC could also be observed (25Haraguchi T. Fisher S. Olofsson S. Endo T. Groth D. Tarentino A. Borchelt D.R. Teplow D. Hood L. Burlingame A. Prusiner S.B. Arch. Biochem.

Deglycosylation of PrP from hamster epididymis sperm cells produced a major band of the same apparent molecular weight as in brain PrP. These results show that sperm and brain PrP share a similar polypeptide backbone and probably also a similar GPI (glycophosphatidylinositol) anchor, since otherwise their deglycosylation products would not be identical in molecular weight.Figure 2Deglycosylation of sperm PrP. Brain and sperm samples either epididymal (s) or from ejaculates samples (s*) were digested in the presence or absence of endoglycosidase F as described (25Haraguchi T. Fisher S. Olofsson S. Endo T.

Samples were subsequently immunoblotted with mAb 3F4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As opposed to the results with brain and with semi-mature sperm cells, the apparent molecular weight of deglycosylated PrP in mature human sperm from ejaculates, as detected by immunoblotting with mAb 3F4, was of about 17,000. These results raise several interesting points. 1) The lower molecular weight of PrP in untreated mature sperm (24,000) could not be only a result of PrP deglycosylation occurring during sperm maturation, since there is a further reduction inMr of sperm PrP following endoglycosidase F treatment. 2) α PrP mAb 3F4 reacts with a site composed of residues 108–111 in the human or hamster PrP sequence; therefore it is unlikely that a 17-kDa peptide that still reacts with this antibody can be produced by proteolysis of only the N-terminal part of PrP. Indeed, during the normal degradation pathway of PrPC, a 17-kDa peptide, which does not react with mAb 3F4, is produced (14Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avrahami D. Laszlo L. Prusiner S.B. Avraham D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 27Buschmann A. Kuczius T. Bodemer W. Groschup M.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These results suggest the possibility that PrP in mature sperm is truncated in its C terminus.To further delineate the site of such a putative C-terminal trimming, human mature sperm samples were immunoblotted with an antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide comprising residues 195–213 of the human and mouse PrP sequence (1E) and that has been shown to preferentially recognize the glutamate residue at position 200 (21Gabizon R. Telling G. Meiner Z. Halimi M. Kahana I. Prusiner S.B. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3, although human brain PrP reacted readily with both the 1E antisera and the mAb 3F4, sperm PrP reacted only with mAb 3F4. That the 1E antisera can react in principle with sperm PrP can be seen from the fact that PrP from mouse epididymis samples (semi-mature sperm cells) did react with this antiserum (Fig.1). These results show that mature sperm carries a C-terminal-truncated PrP isoform, unlike the previously characterized PrPCdegradation products, that are truncated in the N-terminal part of the protein. Since bovine mature sperm PrP reacted with α PrP mAb 6H4 that is directed against residues 144–152 and, we must assume from the endoglycosidase F digestion results that at least one if not both mature sperm PrP N-glycosylation sites are occupied, it is conceivable that mature sperm PrP is cleaved between residues 181 to 200. The molecular weight of the deglycosylated peptide, which is probably devoided of the GPI anchor attached to the PrP C-terminal, is consistent with such a scenario. To explore whether and how the C-truncated PrP in mature sperm cells is attached to the cell membrane, we tested 1) whether sperm PrP could be released by PIPLC; 2) whether it is located in rafts membranes; 3) or whether it is attached to membranes at all.Figure 3Mature sperm PrP is truncated in its C terminus. Extracts of human brain (b) and ejaculated human sperm samples (s*) were immunoblotted either with mAb 3F4 or with α PrP antiserum 1E (21Gabizon R. Telling G. Meiner Z. Halimi M. Kahana I. Prusiner S.B. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which recognizes glutamate at codon 200 of the wt PrP sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In brain samples as well as in cultured cells, PrPC is linked to the cell membrane through a GPI group attached to its C terminus (28Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5405-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). As other GPI-anchored proteins, PrPC can be released from cell membranes by the enzyme PIPLC (29Borchelt D.R. Scott M. Taraboulos A. Stahl N. Prusiner S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). After cleavage of the lipid group, the remaining protein is converted into a soluble peptide. We therefore tested whether PIPLC can release PrP from sperm cells. Most of the PrP is released by PIPLC from either N2a C10 cells as well as from early, predifferentiated spermatocytes (from the testis). This was not the case for PrP from sperm cells, although, at least in semi mature sperm cells, the molecular weight of PrP suggests the presence of the GPI group on PrP (Fig.4). These results suggest either (i) that the GPI anchor became inaccessible to the enzyme, (ii) that the GPI anchor has been chemically modified to resist PIPLC hydrolysis, or (iii) that PrP, in addition to its GPI-membrane anchoring, is attached to the membrane by an additional mechanism. The fact that PrP in testis spermatocytes is releasable by PIPLC but that this property is lost during cell maturation suggests the appearance of an additional binding site for PrP in the membrane during cell processing. This conclusion was reinforced by the presence of the C-terminal-truncated PrP isoform in ejaculation samples, since this isoform is probably devoid altogether of the GPI anchor and, therefore, must be attached to the sperm outer membrane via a different mechanism. Interestingly, it has been shown lately that also PrP in platelets, another example of cells that do not synthesize new proteins and perform only specific functions, cannot be released from the cell membrane by PIPLC (30Holada K. Mondoro T.H. Muller J. Vostal J.G. Br. J. Haematol. 1998; 103: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As opposed to PrP, other GPI-anchored proteins are normally processed in sperm cells, and some of them are known to play a crucial role in cell maturation (31Kirchhoff C. Osterhoff C. Pera I. Schroter S. Andrologia. 1998; 30: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Thaler C.D. Cardullo A.R.

A, N2a-C10 cells, hamster spermatocytes (st), hamster semi-mature (s), and human mature sperm cells (s*) were resuspended after washing in PBS and digested with PIPLC as described (28Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5405-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). S andP above the mAb 3F4 immunoblots represent supernatants and cell extracts, respectively.

Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2598) Google Scholar). Rafts are insoluble in cold Triton X-100, and as such, proteins inserted in them can be separated from other membrane proteins as well as from soluble proteins by an assay in which the insoluble rafts will float to the top of density gradients and the soluble or detergent-solubilized proteins will remain in the lower fractions of these gradients (19Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6324-6331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). PrP is also a raft protein. In fact, since both prion proteins (PrPC and PrPSc) are colocalized in those membranal microdomains, it has been speculated that the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc occurs in these rafts (19Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6324-6331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 34Vey M. Pilkuhn S. Wille H. Nixon R.

Transfection of genetically engineered transmembrane PrPCinto ScN2a cells (that are not targeted to rafts) has shown that the membrane localization of PrPC is essential for the conversion process, since transmembrane PrPC did not convert into PrPSc (14Taraboulos A.

It is possible that rafts are altogether absent from mature sperm cells as a result of changes in lipid membrane composition, which are known to occur during the different stages of sperm maturation (36Ladha S. J. Memb. Biol. 1998; 165: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 37Cross N.L. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This speculation is reinforced by the fact that ESA, a transmembrane raft protein (38Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13793-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), also changed its membrane association during sperm maturation. It is, however, still conceivable that this is a unique effect for a small group of sperm proteins that includes PrP.Figure 5PrP in sperm cells is not located in membrane rafts.

The intact cell samples digested with proteinase K were immunoblotted with the appropriate anti-PrP antibodies. Sperm PrP was completely accessible to low proteinase K concentrations in all the species studied (Fig.6 A), as can be seen from the fact that after proteinase K digestion, no PrP could be detected with diverse antibodies. The association of sperm PrP with the cell membrane is probably extremely strong, since it is resistant to incubation with 100 mm Na2CO3, a reagent that is known to dismantle protein-protein interactions and that has been used operationally to define integral membrane proteins (Fig.6 B).Figure 6Sperm PrP is attached or integral to the outer plasma membrane. A, intact N2a-C10 or intact sperm cells from different sources as described in the figure and under “Experimental Procedures” were incubated with proteinase K (PK) at 10 μg/ml for 20 min at 37 °C. After this incubation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and processed for immunoblotting with diverse α PrP antibodies. B, intact human and hamster (epididymis) sperm cells were sonicated for 10 s in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, followed by a 10-min centrifugation at 14,000 rpm.

The question of whether sperm PrP can be converted into PrPSc may have important implications for the possible transmission routes of prion diseases. However, as can be seen in Fig.7, PrP in sperm cells of scrapie-infected hamsters is not more resistant to protease digestion than PrP from normal sperm. These results are consistent with the general notion that prion diseases are not transmitted sexually. Interestingly, it has been shown that male mice inoculated with prions loose their fertility before clinical signs of the disease are noticeable (39Taguchi F. Tamai Y. Miura S. Arch.

This study delineates the functional significance of DOC-2/DAB2 protein phosphorylation and demonstrates that in vivo activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induces DOC-2/DAB2 phosphorylation, including a serine residue at position 24.

Since expression of wild-type DOC-2/DAB2, but not the S24A mutant, inhibited TPA-induced AP-1 activity in prostatic epithelial cells, phosphorylation of Ser24 appears to play a critical role in modulating TPA-induced AP-1 activity.

Recently, we demonstrated that DOC-2/DAB2 is up-regulated in degenerated rat ventral prostate induced by androgen deprivation (1Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Li Y. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Histologically, elevated levels of DOC-2/DAB2 are associated with an enriched basal cell compartment, a progenitor cell for glandular epithelium. This suggests that DOC-2/DAB2 may be involved in the homeostasis of prostate regeneration (1Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Li Y. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, stable expression of DOC-2/DAB2 in a prostatic cancer cell line significantly reduces its in vitro growth rate concomitant with an increase in G1 cell fractions. It also decreases anchorage-independent growth on soft agar (1Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Li Y. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Other types of cancer cell lines, such as the SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell line (2Mok S.C. Chan W.Y. Wong K.K. Cheung K.K. Lau C.C. Ng S.-W. Baldini A. Colitti C.V. Rock C.O. Berkowitz R.S.

Therefore, DOC-2/DAB2 appears to be a potent negative regulator of carcinoma cell growth. The primary structure of DOC-2/DAB2 reveals that DOC-2/DAB2 is a putative signaling molecule with protein-protein interaction and protein phosphorylation as two possible mechanisms modulating its activity (1Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Li Y. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The N-terminal phosphotyrosine-interacting domain shares significant homology with mouse DAB1 (4Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Copper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Disruption of the mouseDab1 gene disturbs neuronal layering in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum (5Howell B.W. Hawkes R. Soriano P. Copper J.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The similar phenotypes of mouseDab1 null mice, Reeler, Scrambler, andYotari, indicate that mouse DAB1 functions as a signaling molecule regulating cell positioning in the developing brain (6Sheldon M.

Indeed, the phosphotyrosine-interacting domain of mouse DAB1 is found to bind SRC protein-tyrosine kinase, and therefore, mouse DAB1 may play a key role in key signal transduction pathways involved in the formation of neural networks (4Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Copper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In addition to the phosphotyrosine-interacting domain, DOC-2/DAB2 also contains a C-terminal proline-rich domain that interacts with the SH3 domain of GRB2 and reduces the binding between GRB2 and SOS. This suggests that DOC-2/DAB2 may modulate growth factor/Ras pathways (7Xu X.-X. Yi T. Tang B. Lambeth J.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). DOC-2/DAB2 contains several consensus protein kinase C (PKC),1 casein kinase II (CKII), and cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites (1Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Li Y. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), implying that protein phosphorylation may modulate DOC-2/DAB2 activity.

We also found that the phosphorylation of DOC-2/DAB2 is modulated by receptor protein-tyrosine kinase pathways, such as the epidermal growth factor, 2C.-P. Tseng, B. D. Ely, R.-C. Pong, Z. Wang, and J.-T. Hsieh, unpublished data. and the PKC activation pathway, such as stimulation by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) as described in this study.

This study investigated the impact of DOC-2/DAB2 protein phosphorylation on the PKC-mediated signal transduction cascade. We have mapped the TPA-induced DOC-2/DAB2 protein phosphorylation site to Ser24, which appears to modulate the DOC-2/DAB2 inhibition of AP-1 transcription activity. Results indicate that phosphorylation of Ser24 is mediated by PKCβII, PKCγ, and PKCδ, but not CKII. This suggests that the PKC phosphorylation of Ser24 in DOC-2/DAB2 may be an underlying mechanisms for its tumor-suppressive function. The AP-1 reporter gene construct −73/+63-Col-luc was provided by Dr. Michael Karin (University of California, San Diego, CA). The T7-tagged pRSV-PKCβII, pRSV-PKCγ and pRSV-PKCδ expression plasmids have been described previously (17Tseng C.-P. Verma A.K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 169: 287-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The Ser24 peptide (APS24KKEKKKGSEKTD) and the Ala24 peptide (APA24KKEKKKGSEKTD) were synthesized by Genemed Biotechnologies, Inc. (San Francisco, CA). COS, NbE, and C4-2 cells were maintained in T medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum as described previously (1Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Li Y. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). TheSalI-NotI fragments of pCI-neo-p82 and pCI-neo-p59 (1Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Li Y. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were subcloned into pET-21b(+); and theXbaI-NotI fragments of pET-21b(+)-p82 and pET-21b(+)-p59, containing p82 and p59 cDNA, respectively, were subcloned back into the pCI-neo vector to make the T7-p82 and T7-p59 expression plasmids. The ΔB mutant was created by deleting a 1.2-kilobase Bsu36I fragment from pCI-T7-p82. The ΔN mutant was generated by four-fragment ligation with appropriate restriction enzymes, resulting in the deletion of the first 636 base pairs of p82. Site-directed mutagenesis with polymerase chain reaction was used to create ΔB-S24A, ΔB-S32A, ΔB-S24A,S32A, and ΔB-S241A,S249A. The BsaBI fragments of both p82 and p59 were subcloned into BsaBI-digested ΔB-S24A to create a single amino acid mutant of both p82 and p59. Metabolic labeling of cells was performed as described (18Le Goff P. Montano M.M. Schodin D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4458-4466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitated, 32P-labeled DOC-2/DAB2 was subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis (19Robbins D.J. Cobb M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or cyanogen bromide phosphopeptide mapping (20Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). The immunocomplex PKC assay was performed as described (21Tseng C.-P. Kim Y.-J. Kumar R. Verma A.K. Carcinogenesis ( Lond. ). 1994; 15: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of the activators. The CKII protein kinase assay was performed as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI) with equal molar concentrations of the indicated substrates. C4-2 cells (3 × 105cells/35-mm plate) were transfected with an equal amount of DNA mixture. In every experiment, 0.38 μg of −73/+63-Col-luc and 0.38 μg of pRSV-β-galactosidase plus the indicated amount of DOC-2/DAB2 expression plasmid were included. To ensure that an equal amount of DNA mixture was added to each dish, pCI-neo (control plasmid) was used to make up the differences between each condition. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined as described (21Tseng C.-P. Kim Y.-J. Kumar R. Verma A.K. Carcinogenesis ( Lond. ). 1994; 15: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). -Fold induction = (TPA(luciferase activity (treatment − background))/(β-galactosidase activity (treatment − background)))/(ethanol(luciferase activity (treatment − background))/(β-galactosidase activity (treatment − background))). The recombinant GRB2-GST fusion protein was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4–6 h. The bacteria were spun down, and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was sonicated, and then all insoluble material was spun down. The GRB2-GST protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose for 30 min, washed three times, and resuspended as a 50% slurry in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. Wild-type DOC-2/DAB2 protein and its mutant were expressed in COS cells 24 h after DNA transfection. Cells were collected in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and a mixture of protease inhibitors. After a low speed centrifugation, 0.4 ml of the supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 60 μl of GRB2-GST-glutathione-Sepharose or GST-glutathione-Sepharose alone. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed twice and dissolved in the sample buffer. After electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to a filter and probed with antiserum against the T7 tag. DOC-2/DAB2 appears to be a phosphoprotein (8Xu X.-X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14184-14191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the phosphorylation and the upstream protein kinase that mediates DOC-2/DAB2 phosphorylation have not yet been elucidated. To study DOC-2/DAB2 protein phosphorylation, NbE cells were treated with the PKC activator TPA (100 ng/ml). Both DOC-2/DAB2 (i.e.p82) and its splicing variant, p59, showed a mobility shift on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) within 5 min, and this was sustained for at least 30 min after TPA treatment (Fig.1 A). Transfection of the T7-tagged p82 or p59 expression plasmid into COS or NbE cells (data not shown) followed by TPA treatment also resulted in a similar mobility shift of exogenously expressed DOC-2/DAB2. This finding suggests that a protein modification occurred in DOC-2/DAB2 after TPA treatment. To determine whether the mobility shift of protein on SDS-PAGE is caused by changes in protein phosphorylation, we labeled T7-p59-transfected cells with [32P]orthophosphate, and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with the anti-T7 tag antibody 30 min after TPA treatment. A basal level of p59 phosphorylation occurred in control cells, whereas TPA treatment resulted in an increase in p59 phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B, left panel). The majority of the phosphorylation occurred at the serine residue as determined by phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 1 B, right panel). A series of DOC-2/DAB2 deletion mutants was constructed to map the phosphorylation site (Fig. 1 C, upper panel). Although the basal level of protein phosphorylation was still detected in the N-terminal deletion mutant (ΔN), TPA-induced protein phosphorylation was abolished (Fig.1 C, lower panel). In contrast, TPA induced the phosphorylation of a p82 mutant (ΔB) with a deletion of the majority of the C terminus (Fig. 1 C, lower panel). To avoid possible transfection artifacts, we demonstrated similar levels of protein expression by each transfection as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1 C, lower panel). The higher extra band seen in ΔB experiments by Western blotting is immunoglobulin protein, which has a similar molecular mass compared with ΔB. These results suggest that the N terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 may harbor key phosphoserine residue(s) responsive to TPA. We have further used ΔB to map the TPA-induced protein phosphorylation site with CNBr phosphopeptide mapping (Fig.2 A). TPA treatment enhanced the phosphorylation of at least two additional peptides, with estimated molecular masses of 13.6/13.2 and 7.3 kDa, respectively, compared with the ethanol control (Fig. 2 B). The protein sequence of DOC-2/DAB2 revealed four consensus PKC/CKII phosphorylation sites (i.e. SKKE) at serines 24, 32, 241, and 249. The double mutation of Ser241 and Ser249(ΔB-S241A,S249A) did not affect TPA-induced ΔB phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B). However, the double mutation of Ser24and Ser32 (ΔB-S24A,S32A) completely abolished the protein phosphorylation of ΔB by TPA, indicating that phosphorylation of either Ser24 or Ser32 is induced by TPA (Fig.2 B). Therefore, a single mutation of Ser24 or Ser32 was used to precisely map the TPA-induced protein phosphorylation site in DOC-2/DAB2. As shown in Fig. 2 C, TPA-induced DOC-2/DAB2 protein phosphorylation was detected only in ΔB and ΔB-S32A, but not ΔB-S24A. In p82-S24A and p59-S24A, the 7.3-kDa phosphopeptide induced by TPA was also eliminated (Fig.2 D). Thus, Ser24 is one of the TPA-induced protein phosphorylation sites in DOC-2/DAB2. Since S24KK appears to fit the consensus phosphorylation site for either PKC or CKII, we tested whether PKCβII, PKCγ, PKCδ, and CKII could use the synthetic Ser24 peptide (APS24KKEKKKGSEKTD) of DOC-2/DAB2 as anin vitro substrate. In the presence of PKC activators, all PKC isoforms tested demonstrated comparable PKC activity toward the Ser24 peptide (Fig.3 A). In contrast, CKII failed to phosphorylate the Ser24 peptide, whereas myelin basic protein was phosphorylated significantly (Fig. 3 B). The phosphorylation of Ser24 by PKC was abolished when an Ala24 peptide (APA24KKEKKKGSEKTD) of DOC-2/DAB2 was used (Fig. 3 A), indicating that the Ser24peptide is a specific substrate for PKC. To determine whether PKC directly phosphorylates Ser24 of DOC-2/DAB2 in vitro, the recombinant proteins His-T7-ΔB and His-T7-ΔB-S24A were generated (Fig. 3 C). As shown in Fig. 3 D, His-T7-ΔB was phosphorylated by PKCβII, PKCγ, and PKCδ, whereas His-T7-ΔB-S24A phosphorylation was substantially reduced in vitro. The CNBr phosphopeptide map revealed that the 7.3-kDa phosphopeptide was the key substrate for PKCβII, PKCγ, or PKCδ (Fig. 3 E) and was consistent with the in vivo data shown in Fig. 3 C. Clearly, protein phosphorylation of DOC-2/DAB2 can be controlled by PKC activity. To further delineate the possible impact of Ser24phosphorylation on DOC-2/DAB2 function, we examined the effect of DOC-2/DAB2 on the PKC-mediated signaling pathway. Since TPA enhances the binding of the AP-1 transcription factor to a specificcis-element of many growth-related genes and increases gene transcription, we cotransfected the indicated DOC-2/DAB2 expression plasmids with a luciferase reporter gene construct (i.e.−73/+63-Col-luc) containing a TPA-responsive element derived from the collagenase gene promoter into a human prostate cancer cell line (C4-2). We found that p82 elicited a dose-dependent inhibition of TPA-induced AP-1 activity (Fig.4 A). Similarly, expression of p59 and ΔB, but not ΔN, in C4-2 cells demonstrated the inhibitory effect on TPA-induced AP-1 activity, indicating that the N terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 is critical in regulating AP-1 activity (Fig.4 B). We also observed a significant decrease in the AP-1 activity of the p59-transfected C4-2 sublines (1Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Li Y. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) with TPA compared with that of wild-type or control plasmid-transfected C4-2 cells (Table I). Such a decrease suggests that DOC-2/DAB2 protein can function as a potent negative regulator to modulate TPA-induced AP-1 activity.Table IA significant decrease in TPA-induced AP-1 activity in DOC-2/DAB2-transfected cellsCell linesLuciferase activityExp. 1 plasmid controlaThe plasmid control (pCI-neo; 0.24 μg) was used in these experiments.Exp. 2 plasmid controlaThe plasmid control (pCI-neo; 0.24 μg) was used in these experiments.Exp. 3Plasmid controlbThe plasmid control (pCI-neo; 2.4 μg) and p59-S24A (0.24 μg) were used in this experiment.p59-S24AbThe plasmid control (pCI-neo; 2.4 μg) and p59-S24A (0.24 μg) were used in this experiment.-fold inductionWild-type C4–296 ± 10cThe data were calculated from three independent transfections; the numbers represent the mean ± S.D.120 ± 20106 ± 1298 ± 14Neo-484 ± 15125 ± 1894 ± 1489 ± 15p59–1825 ± 520 ± 731 ± 265 ± 12p59–2316 ± 417 ± 515 ± 840 ± 7a The plasmid control (pCI-neo; 0.24 μg) was used in these experiments.b The plasmid control (pCI-neo; 2.4 μg) and p59-S24A (0.24 μg) were used in this experiment.c The data were calculated from three independent transfections; the numbers represent the mean ± S.D. Open table in a new tab To further determine the significance of Ser24phosphorylation of DOC-2/DAB2, we cotransfected a series of mutants with the reporter gene construct into C4-2 cells. As shown in Fig.4 C, expression of ΔB-S24A, p82-S24A, and p59-S24A showed greater luciferase activity than p82. Thus, Ser24 in DOC-2/DAB2 is critical for maintaining its inhibitory effect on TPA-induced AP-1 activity. Moreover, ΔB-S24A and p82-S24A neutralized the inhibitory activity of ΔB and p82 on AP-1 activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5). In p59-expressing C4-2 cells (Table I), increased expression of p59-S24A also decreased the inhibitory effect of p59 on AP-1 activity. These results clearly indicate that Ser24 phosphorylation of DOC-2/DAB2 plays a critical role in modulating AP-1 inhibitory activity. Previously, DOC-2/DAB2 was demonstrated to interact with GRB2 (7Xu X.-X. Yi T. Tang B. Lambeth J.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which may be a potential underlying mechanism for its AP-1 inhibitory function. Therefore, we tested whether ΔB or ΔN interacts with GRB2. As expected, in the presence of GRB2, p82, p59, and ΔN could be precipitated (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, in the presence of ethanol (Fig. 6 A) or TPA (Fig. 6 B), ΔB failed to be precipitated by GRB2 protein. This indicates that the N-terminal DOC-2/DAB2 protein does not interact with GRB2 (Fig. 6, Aand B). This interaction appears to be specific because GST-glutathione-Sepharose alone did not precipitate any DOC-2/DAB2 protein (Fig. 6 C). Taken together, these data suggest that the mechanism for the AP-1 inhibitory effect of DOC-2/DAB2 may be mediated by GRB2-independent pathway(s). Although DOC-2/DAB2 is believed to be a candidate tumor suppressor in several cancer cell lines (1Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Li Y. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 2Mok S.C. Chan W.Y. Wong K.K. Cheung K.K. Lau C.C. Ng S.-W. Baldini A. Colitti C.V. Rock C.O. Berkowitz R.S.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the mechanism of its inhibition of cell growth is unknown. In this work, we describe the modulation of DOC-2/DAB2 protein phosphorylation by the PKC activator TPA and the critical role of the phosphorylation in determining its function. We demonstrate that DOC-2/DAB2 serves as a negative regulator in the PKC-mediated signaling axis and may inhibit cell growth through inhibiting AP-1 activity that has been associated with cell proliferation and tumorigenicity (23Friedrich E. Vancompernolle K. Huet C. Goethals M. Finidori J. Vandekerckhove J. Louvard D. Cell. 1992; 70: 81-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition to our studies, Xuet al. (7Xu X.-X. Yi T. Tang B. Lambeth J.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) have shown that the C terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 prevents GRB2 from binding to SOS. Although, the functional impact of this interaction is unclear, it suggests that DOC-2/DAB2 may interfere with the signal transduction pathway activated by receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. Several mitogenic stimuli, including colony-stimulating factor-1, TPA, phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, and sphingomyelinase, are known to induce phosphorylation of DOC-2/DAB2. However, unlike the DAB1 protein, which contains a phosphotyrosine moiety, our data and others (8Xu X.-X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14184-14191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the major protein phosphorylation site of DOC-2/DAB2 is the serine residue. We mapped a key PKC-modulated DOC-2/DAB2 protein phosphorylation site to Ser24, a conserved residue of DOC-2/DAB2 among human, mouse, and rat species (1Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Li Y. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The impact of Ser24 phosphorylation on the function of DOC-2/DAB2 is very significant because mutation of Ser24 to Ala abolishes the inhibitory effect of DOC-2/DAB2 on TPA-induced AP-1 activity (Fig. 4). Interestingly., we observed that the Ser24 mutants of DOC-2/DAB2 can compete with their wild-type proteins in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 and Table I), indicating that Ser24 in DOC-2/DAB2 is a critical amino acid motif modulating its activity. Furthermore, TPA-induced AP-1 activity is substantially inhibited in the p59-expressing C4-2 sublines (i.e. p59-18 and p59-23) (Table I). This may be one of the underlying mechanism(s) contributing to the slower growth of both p59-18 and p59-23 in vitro (1Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Li Y. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Similarly, by transfecting the AP-1 reporter construct into NbE cells with detectable endogenous DOC-2/DAB2 levels (1Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Li Y. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we found that TPA failed to increase AP-1 activity in this cell line (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that DOC-2/DAB2 represents a novel factor in the modulation of the PKC-elicited signaling pathway. We still do not know how DOC-2/DAB2 inhibits AP-1 activity in the nucleus, although Xu et al. (7Xu X.-X. Yi T. Tang B. Lambeth J.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) demonstrated that DOC-2/DAB2 can bind to GRB2, which may account for the inhibition of the GRB2-mediated signaling pathway. However, our results indicate that N-terminal DOC-2/DAB2 (i.e. ΔB), with or without phosphorylation, does not interact with GRB2 (Fig. 6). Therefore, this AP-1 inhibitory effect must be mediated by GRB2-independent pathway(s). Alternatively, DOC-2/DAB2 may inhibit the function of signal molecules in PKC-elicited pathway(s). However, we observed that Ser24 and Ser24/Ser32mutants appear to affect the phosphorylation status of other serine residues as indicated by CNBr phosphopeptide mapping (Fig. 2), suggesting a critical role for Ser24 phosphorylation in modulating the protein conformation of DOC-2/DAB2. Moreover, analysis of the amino acid sequence surrounding Ser24 revealed a potential nuclear localization signal (S24KKEKKKG). The sequence KKEK has been shown to associate with the actin-interacting capability of villin (23Friedrich E. Vancompernolle K. Huet C. Goethals M. Finidori J. Vandekerckhove J. Louvard D. Cell. 1992; 70: 81-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), suggesting that the subcellular localization of DOC-2/DAB2 may be affected by protein phosphorylation. Interestingly, we observed that TPA induces accumulation of DOC-2/DAB2 in the particulate fraction (i.e. membrane fraction) of prostatic epithelial cells.2 The accumulated DOC-2/DAB2 protein in the particulate fraction appears to be phosphorylated as determined by the mobility shift on SDS-PAGE. This observation is in accord with reports suggesting that phosphorylation within the sequence immediately N-terminal to the minimal nuclear localization signal modulates the transport kinetics of the respective protein (24Tagawa T. Kuroki T. Vogt P.K. Chida K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 25Leukel M. Jost E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 133-142PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of Ser24 phosphorylation on DOC-2/DAB2 protein localization, which may explain how DOC-2/DAB2 regulates AP-1 activity, warrants further investigation. Another important issue is the mechanism controlling the phosphorylation of Ser24. Among the protein kinases we tested (PKCβII, PKCγ, PKCδ, and CKII), PKC preferentially phosphorylates DOC-2/DAB2 both in vivo and in vitro. PKC has been implicated in many aspects of cellular functions, including cell proliferation and differentiation, T-cell activation, and gene activation (10Choi P.M. Tchou-Wong K.M. Weinstein I.B.

The largest phosphopeptide is not phosphorylated by PKCδ. This suggests the distinct activity of PKC isoforms toward the phosphorylation of ΔB. In addition, there was an increased expression of both DOC-2/DAB2 and PKCδ mRNAs in the enriched basal epithelial cells of degenerated prostate in castrated rat (1Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Li Y. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar),2 suggesting the involvement of PKCδ in the control of DOC-2/DAB2 activity in prostate gland homeostasis. Kinetic studies with purified recombinant PKC will be required to further elucidate whether Ser24 of DOC-2/DAB2 is a preferential substrate for any PKC isoform. In summary, our results indicate that DOC-2/DAB2 is phosphorylated at Ser24 by PKC, which plays a critical role in controlling AP-1 activity. The regulation of DOC-2/DAB2 protein phosphorylation may in turn regulate its inhibitory function in cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. It may define a novel mechanism for the transduction of negative growth signals from the membrane to the nucleus. We thank Dr. Megan J.

It also induces the production of vascular endothelial growth factor. These processes are believed to be important in KSHV-GPCR-related oncogenesis. We have characterized the signaling pathways mediated by KSHV-GPCR in a reconstituted 293T cell model in which the related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK) was ectopically expressed. RAFTK has been shown to play an important role in growth factor signaling in endothelium and in B cell antigen receptor signaling in B lymphocytes. KSHV-GPCR induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK. Expression of wild-type RAFTK enhanced GPCR-mediated JNK/SAPK activation, whereas dominant-negative mutant constructs of RAFTK, such as K457A (which lacks kinase activity) and Y402F (a Src-binding mutant), inhibited KSHV-GPCR-mediated activation of JNK/SAPK. RAFTK also mediated the KSHV-GPCR-induced activation of Lyn, a Src family kinase. However, RAFTK did not mediate the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase induced by KSHV-GPCR. Human interferon γ-inducible protein-10, which is known to inhibit KSHV-GPCR activity, was found to reduce RAFTK phosphorylation and JNK/SAPK activation. These results suggest that in cells expressing RAFTK/proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2, such as endothelial and B cells, RAFTK can act to enhance KSHV-GPCR-mediated downstream signaling to transcriptional regulators such as JNK/SAPK.

KSHV has been shown to induce transformation of endothelial cells. These cells show an up-regulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, Flk-1/KDR and are dependent on vascular endothelial growth factor production (13Flore O. Rafii S. Ely S. O'Leary J.J. Hyjek E.M. Cesarman E. Nature. 1998; 394: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). KSHV contains a number of open reading frames that encode known cellular homologues of various proteins, including cytokines and cell cycle and apoptotic regulatory proteins, as well as chemokines and their receptors (14Nicholas J.

One of these KSHV-encoded genes, open reading frame 74, has been named KSHV G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) because it shows homology to several α-chemokine receptors, including CXCR1, CXCR2, and CXCR3 (21Arvanitakis L.

Transfer of the KSHV-GPCR gene into model cell lines has resulted in a number of cellular responses, including cell proliferation, transformation, and production of vascular endothelial growth factor (21Arvanitakis L.

Despite increasing knowledge about the prominent role of KSHV-GPCR in the pathogenesis of KS, relatively little is known about the signal transduction pathways downstream of this receptor. KSHV-GPCR has been shown to constitutively activate two transcriptional mediators, JNK/SAPK and p38/MAPK (21Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E.

RAFTK, also known as proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2), CAK-β, and CADTK, exhibits about 45% amino acid identity with the focal adhesion kinase (29Avraham S. London R. Fu Y. Ota S. Hiregowdara D.

In the present study, we have addressed whether RAFTK participates in KSHV-GPCR-induced JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK activation. We observed that KSHV-GPCR induced RAFTK activation, which enhanced KSHV-GPCR-induced JNK/SAPK activation. However, RAFTK activation did not lead to p38 MAPK activation. Furthermore, the Src-related kinase, Lyn, was also involved in KSHV-GPCR signaling. Our results suggest that KSHV-GPCR can activate a variety of downstream substrates that lead to activation of JNK/SAPK family members, thereby mimicking pathways of exogenous cytokine stimulation in KS cells. RAFTK antibodies were obtained as described previously (36Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies to Lyn, JNK, p38, and recombinant glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun amino-terminal protein (1–79 amino acids) (GST c-Jun 1–79) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10) was a generous gift from Dr. Brian Druker (Oregon University, Portland, OR). Electrophoresis reagents were obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories. The protease inhibitors and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. The nitrocellulose membrane was obtained from Bio-Rad. The chemokine, human IP-10, was obtained from Peprotech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). 293T cells, known to lack RAFTK, were used for the present studies. These cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were grown to confluence in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and were fed with fresh medium 3 h prior to transfection. KSHV-GPCR was cloned into the expression vector pCEFL, as described (22Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gershengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar), to obtain pCEFL-KSHV-GPCR. Parent pCEFL vector was used as a control. Wild-type RAFTK (RAFTKWT), kinase-dead mutant RAFTK (RAFTKm457), or Src-binding mutant RAFTK (RAFTKm402) was subcloned into a pCDNA expression vector. The dominant-negative kinase mutant RAFTKm457 was generated by replacing Lys-457 with Ala, and RAFTKm402 was obtained by replacing Tyr-402 with Phe by site-directed mutagenesis. Controls consisted of pCDNA vector alone. GST-JNK and GST p38 MAPK were also cloned into pCDNA expression vectors. 293T cells were grown in 100-mm dishes, and transfections with these various vectors were carried out by the calcium phosphate method (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, after 16 h of incubation at 37 °C with transfection medium containing different expression vectors, the medium was replaced and the cells were incubated for another 24–36 h. Total cell lysates were analyzed for expression of proteins by blotting with anti-RAFTK or GST antibodies. 293T cells transiently transfected with KSHV-GPCR, RAFTKWT, and GST-JNK were treated with 100 ng/ml IP-10 for various time periods. The cells were lysed within the culture dish by adding modified radioimmune precipitation buffer as described below. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described (34Ganju R.K. Hatch W.C. Avraham H. Ona M.A. Druker B. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed and lysed with modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 10 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate). For the immunoprecipitation studies, identical amounts of protein from the total cell lysates of each sample were first clarified by incubation with 50 μl of 10% protein A-Sepharose solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein A-Sepharose beads were then removed by brief centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated with different primary antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose and further incubation for 16 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific proteins were removed by washing the Sepharose beads three times with the lysis buffer and once with phosphate-buffered saline. Bound proteins were solubilized in 40 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer and further analyzed by immunoblotting. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (8% polyacrylamide) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk protein and probed with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with JNK/SAPK or p38 kinase antibodies. The immune complexes were washed twice with radioimmune precipitation buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP). The complexes were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and with the substrates GST-c-Jun (1–79) (1 μg) for JNK or myelin basic protein (7 μg) for p38 MAPK. The reaction was stopped by adding 2× SDS sample buffer and boiling the samples for 5 min at 100 °C. The reaction products were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. A Src-related Lyn kinase assay was performed as described (38Ganju R.K. Munshi N. Nair B.C. Liu Z.Y. Gill P. Groopman J.E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6131-6137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the complexes obtained by immunoprecipitating cell lysates with Lyn antiserum were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MnCl2, 10 μmNa3VO4). For the in vitro kinase assays, the immune complex was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in kinase buffer containing acid-denatured rabbit muscle enolase (Sigma) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by adding 2× SDS sample buffer and boiling the samples for 5 min. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. The RAFTK kinase assay was performed as described (36Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, RAFTK immunoprecipitates were washed twice with radioimmune precipitation buffer and once in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 mm Na3VO4, and 5 μm ATP). The immunocomplexes were incubated in kinase buffer containing 25 μg of poly(Glu/Tyr) (4:1, 20–50 kDa, Sigma) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at room temperature. Accruing information indicates that KSHV is involved in the pathogenesis of KS and certain B cell malignancies (11Dupin N. Fisher C. Kellam P. Ariad S. Tulliez M. Franck N. van Marck E. Salmon D.

Recently, it was demonstrated that KSHV-GPCR activated both JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK in a 293T cell model (22Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E.

We have extended these initial observations and characterized intermediate signaling molecules present in endothelium and B lymphocytes that may link KSHV-GPCR to transcriptional activation. We focused on the effects of KSHV-GPCR on RAFTK. RAFTK has been shown to act as a bridge by directing cytokine, chemokine, or stress-activated signaling downstream to the nuclear activating proteins of the AP-1 family via JNK/SAPK activation and to cytoskeletal elements such as paxillin (34Ganju R.K.

Co-transfection of KSHV-GPCR with different RAFTK constructs allowed us to assess how RAFTK might participate in KSHV-GPCR-mediated signaling pathways. As shown in Fig. 1, higher RAFTK phosphorylation was observed in 293T cells co-expressing KSHV-GPCR and RAFTKWT as compared with cells expressing both the control vector (pCEFL) and RAFTKWT. Furthermore, KSHV-GPCR did not induce phosphorylation in the RAFTKm457 mutant that lacks kinase activity. Equal amounts of RAFTK protein were expressed in each transfectant, as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 1. We also found that KSHV-GPCR enhanced RAFTK auto-kinase activity (data not shown). These studies indicate that KSHV-GPCR activates RAFTK and could therefore signal via this kinase. KSHV-GPCR is known to constitutively activate JNK/SAPK (22Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gershengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Because RAFTK/Pyk2 is known to regulate JNK activation in chemokine and stress-induced signaling (41Ganju R.K. Dutt P. Wu L. Newman W. Avraham H. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. Blood. 1998; 91: 791-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate whether RAFTK can modulate JNK activation by KSHV-GPCR. As shown in Fig.2, there was an approximately 4-fold increase in JNK activity in the presence of KSHV-GPCR. However, expression of RAFTKWT led to an approximately 9-fold increase in this activity. Equivalent transfection efficiencies were shown by immunoprecipitating with glutathione-Sepharose beads and then blotting with anti-GST antibody (Fig. 2 A, bottom panel). The JNK activation was found to be dependent on the level of RAFTK expressed in these cells (Fig. 3).Figure 3RAFTK activates KSHV-GPCR-induced JNK activity in a dose dependent manner. 293T cells were transfected with KSHV-GPCR (10 μg), GST-JNK (1 μg), and varying concentrations of RAFTK, and the cell lysates were assayed for JNK activity.

As shown in Fig. 2 A, expression of RAFTKm457 did not enhance KSHV-GPCR-mediated JNK/SAPK activation, suggesting that the kinase activity of RAFTK is required for JNK activation. Prior analyses of RAFTK indicate that the SH2 domain of Src binds to the Tyr-402 residue, which is the autophosphorylation site of RAFTK/Pyk2. This binding leads to the activation of Src and other downstream signaling molecules. In the present studies, we observed that expression of RAFTKm402 failed to mediate KSHV-GPCR-induced JNK activation. Taken together, these studies indicate that RAFTK enhances KSHV-GPCR-induced JNK activation, and this effect is dependent on RAFTK autophosphorylation and kinase activity. p38 MAPK, another member of the mammalian MAPK family, is also known to be activated by KSHV-GPCR (22Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gershengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). p38 MAPK participates in signaling pathways that regulate the activation and phosphorylation of transcriptional factors, including CHOP, Elk-1, and ATF-2 (44Wang X.Z.

Kumar S. Nakazawa A. Place A. Ghanem L. Rana A. Kumar V. Majumder P.K. Avraham H. Davis R.J. Kharbanda S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10140-10144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we therefore investigated whether RAFTK also functioned as an intermediate signaling molecule in the KSHV-GPCR pathway leading to p38 MAPK. We did not observe increased p38 MAPK activity in the presence of RAFTKWT as compared with pCDNA control (Fig. 4). This result indicates that there are distinct downstream pathways mediating GPCR effects on these two transcriptional activators. RAFTK has been shown to act as a “platform kinase” and interacts with several signaling molecules, including Src-related kinases and adaptor proteins in various cell types (34Ganju R.K. Hatch W.C.

Association of RAFTK with the Src-related kinase Fyn plays an important role in mediating T cell receptor signal transduction (34Ganju R.K. Hatch W.C. Avraham H. Ona M.A. Druker B. Avraham S.

Med. 1997; 185: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the role of Src kinases in GPCR-induced signaling. 293T cells were characterized by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation for the expression of Src family kinases and were found to express significant amounts of Lyn. As shown in Fig. 5, RAFTKWT enhanced Lyn activity using enolase as substrate in the presence of KSHV-GPCR, whereas RAFTKm457 and RAFTKm402 had no such effect. This suggests that RAFTK could mediate the activation of Src kinases by KSHV-GPCR. The Src-related kinase 1, Syk, has recently been shown to play an important role in the activation of KSHV gene product (K1) signaling (19Lagunoff M. Majeti R. Weiss A. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5704-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). KSHV-GPCR shows homology to several CXC chemokine receptors, including the IP-10 receptor CXCR3. IP-10 has been shown to inhibit KSHV-GPCR-induced constitutive signaling (25Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Brauner-Osborne H. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 956-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 26Gershengorn M.C. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Clark-Lewis I. J. Clin.

Med. 1998; 188: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We observed a reduction of about 80% in the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK upon IP-10 treatment (Fig. 6 A, top panel). Equivalent amounts of RAFTK were present in each sample (Fig. 6 A, bottom panel). IP-10 treatment also inhibited the increase in JNK/SAPK activity mediated by RAFTK (Fig.6 B). Our results indicate that in cells such as endothelium and B lymphocytes, in which RAFTK is expressed, RAFTK can act as an enhancer of KSHV-GPCR signaling, leading to JNK/SAPK activation, and can mediate the activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, these studies also suggest that distinct signaling pathways may regulate the activation of JNK/SAPK or p38 MAPK in response to this virus-encoded receptor, because RAFTK was found to mediate JNK/SAPK activation, not p38 MAPK activation. These observations provide insight into the molecular mechanisms whereby KSHV, via its constitutively activated GPCR, may be linked to important mediators of cell proliferation, such as JNK/SAPK kinase, and thereby foster the development of KS and B cell lymphoma.

Lu (85 kDa) and Lu(v13) (78 kDa) gps, which differ only in the length of their cytoplasmic domain, are adhesion molecules that bind laminin. In nonerythroid tissues, the Lu/basal cell adhesion molecule antigens are predominantly expressed in the endothelium of blood vessel walls and in the basement membrane region of normal epithelial cells, whereas they exhibit a nonpolarized expression in some epithelial cancers. Here, we analyzed the polarization of Lu and Lu(v13) gps in epithelial cells by confocal microscopy and domain-selective biotinylation assays. Differentiated human colon carcinoma Caco-2 cells exhibited a polarized expression of endogenous Lu antigens associated with a predominant expression of the Lu isoform at the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane and a very low expression of the Lu(v13) isoform at both the apical and basolateral domains. Analysis of transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells revealed a basolateral expression of Lu gp and a nonpolarized expression of Lu(v13) gp. Delivery of Lu(v13) to both apical and basolateral surfaces showed similar kinetics, indicating that this isoform is directly transported to each surface domain. A dileucine motif at position 608–609, specific to the Lu isoform, was characterized as a dominant basolateral sorting signal that prevents Lu gp from taking the apical delivery pathway.

Lutheran basal cell adhesion molecule glycoprotein kilobase(s) monoclonal antibody Madin-Darby canine kidney specific antibody binding capacity The Lutheran (Lu)1 and basal cell adhesion molecule (B-CAM) antigens were recently shown to be carried by a new glycoprotein member of the immunoglobulin superfamily with five extracellular Ig-like domains (two V set and three C2 set domains from the NH2 terminus) (1Parsons S.F. Mallinson G. Holmes C.H. Houlihan J.M. Simpson K.L. Mawby W.J. Spurr N.K. Warne D. Barclay A.N. Anstee D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Lu antigens belong to a highly polymorphic blood group system and were originally shown to be carried by low abundance erythrocyte membrane glycoproteins of 85- and 78-kDa species (3Parsons S.F. Mallison G. Judson P.A. Anstee D.J. Tanner M.J.A. Daniels G.L. Transfusion. 1987; 27: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 4Daniels G. Khalid G. Vox Sang. 1989; 57: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The B-CAM antigen was first identified by monoclonal antibodies raised against human tumor cells and was shown to be overexpressed in ovarian carcinomas in vivo and up-regulated following malignant transformation in some cell types (5Chesa-Garin P. Sanz-Moncasi M.P. Campbell I.G. Rettig W.J. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 5: 1261-1266PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rettig W.J. Garin-Chesa P. Beresford H.R. Oettgen H.F. Melamed M.R. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3110-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the 85- and 78-kDa gps express both the Lu and B-CAM antigens and represent isoforms of the same protein encoded by 2.5- and 4.0-kb mRNAs, resulting from alternative splicing of intron 13 of the unique gene, LU (7Rahuel C. Le Van Kim C. Mattei M.G. Cartron J.P. Colin Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 1865-1872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8El Nemer W. Rahuel C. Colin Y. Gane P. Cartron J.P. Le Van Kim C. Blood. 1997; 89: 4608-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we now refer to these molecules, which differ only in the length of their cytoplasmic tail (59 and 19 amino acids, respectively) as the Lu and Lu(v13) gps. The 40 COOH-terminal amino acids specific to the Lu gp isoform carry a proline-rich motif for binding of Src homology 3 domains and potential phosphorylation motifs that could be involved in intracellular signaling pathways (9Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Both Lu and Lu(v13) gps are adhesion molecules that bind laminin (10Udani M. Zen Q. Cottman M. Leonard N. Jefferson S. Daymont C. Truskey G. Telen M.J. J. Clin.

The use of domain deletion mutants provided important information on the structure-function relationship within the NH2extracellular domain common to Lu and Lu(v13). It has been demonstrated that at least one Lu blood group antigen is located on each of the five Ig-like domains (14Parsons S.F. Mallinson G. Daniels G.L. Green C.A. Smythe J.S. Anstee D.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 4219-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas only the membrane proximal domain 5 is critical for laminin binding (15Zen Q. Cottman M. Truskey G. Fraser R. Telen M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 8: 728-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the functional properties of the intracytoplasmic COOH-terminal domain of Lu and Lu(v13) have not yet been investigated. Besides erythroid cells, the Lu/B-CAM antigens are expressed in a large variety of tissues. However, immunochemical and Northern blot analyses indicated that Lu and Lu(v13) expression are differentially regulated depending on the nature, the developmental stage, and the normal or pathological status of the tissues and cells investigated. Whereas both the 85- and 78-kDa gps could be detected in red blood cell membrane (3Parsons S.F. Mallison G. Judson P.A. Anstee D.J. Tanner M.J.A. Daniels G.L. Transfusion. 1987; 27: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,4Daniels G. Khalid G. Vox Sang. 1989; 57: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the 85-kDa protein species, and accordingly the 2.5-kb mRNA, was predominantly detected in most normal tissues, with a higher expression in fetal versus adult stages (at least in liver, placenta, kidney, and lung) (1Parsons S.F. Mallinson G. Holmes C.H. Houlihan J.M. Simpson K.L. Mawby W.J. Spurr N.K. Warne D. Barclay A.N. Anstee D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Conversely, immunoprecipitation studies using an anti-B-CAM MoAb revealed both Lu and Lu(v13) gps in ovarian cancer cells (5Chesa-Garin P. Sanz-Moncasi M.P. Campbell I.G. Rettig W.J. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 5: 1261-1266PubMed Google Scholar), and Northern blot analysis revealed an up-regulation of the 4.0-kb transcript encoding Lu(v13) in the epithelial colon carcinoma HT29 cell line (7Rahuel C. Le Van Kim C. Mattei M.G. Cartron J.P. Colin Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 1865-1872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, immunohistochemical analysis indicated that B-CAM antigens are expressed with a basal pattern in the epithelium of normal colon, prostate, ovary, and thyroid gland and were up-regulated and nonpolarized in ovarian epithelial cancers (5Chesa-Garin P. Sanz-Moncasi M.P. Campbell I.G. Rettig W.J. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 5: 1261-1266PubMed Google Scholar). Considered together, these results suggest that the predominant expression of the Lu isoform might account for the polarized expression of the Lu/B-CAM antigens observed in normal epithelial cells and that overexpression of the Lu(v13) isoform could be responsible for their nonpolarized expression in epithelial cancer cells. In an attempt to test these hypotheses, we studied the sorting of Lu and Lu(v13) gp isoforms in polarized epithelial cell lines. We found that Lu gp isoform was targeted to the basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells, whereas the Lu(v13) isoform exhibited a nonpolarized expression pattern. In addition, we mapped the basolateral targeting signal of Lu gp to a dileucine motif in the cytoplasmic 40 amino acids specific to Lu gp. Lub and Lub(v13) cDNAs were subcloned in pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands) as described (8El Nemer W. Rahuel C. Colin Y. Gane P. Cartron J.P. Le Van Kim C. Blood. 1997; 89: 4608-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutated cDNAs LuΔ25, L608A/L609A, S621A, P590A/P593A, and S596A/S598A were constructed byin vitro mutagenesis (Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) from Lub-pcDNA3 double strand recombinant DNA according to the supplier's instructions. Briefly, complementary primers (22 nm) and 50 ng of Lub-pcDNA3 cDNA template were used in polymerase chain reactions under the following conditions: 12 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 95 °C and primer annealing and extension at 68 °C for 15 min. Primers used (mutated nucleotides are underlined) were as follows. For LuΔ25: sense primer, 5′-GGGTCGGAGCAACCATAGTAGACCGGCCTTCTCATGGG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CCCATGAGAAGGCCGGTCTACTATGGTTGCTCCGACCC-3′; for L608A/L609A: sense primer, 5′-CCAGAGCAGACCGGCGCTGCCATGGGAGGTGCCTCC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GGAGGCACCTCCCATGGCAGCGCCGGTCTGCTCTGG-3′; for S621A: sense primer, 5′-GCCAGGGGTGGCGCCGGGGGCTTCGG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CCGAAGCCCCCGGCGCCACCCCTGGC-3′; for P590A/P593A: sense primer, 5′-GGGCTCCGCCGGCAGGGGAGGCAGGGCTGAGCCAC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GTGGCTCAGCCCTGCCTCCCCTGCCGGCGGAGCCC-3′; and for S596A/S598A, sense primer, 5′-GGGAGCCAGGGCTGGCCCACGCGGGGTCGGAGCAACC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GGTTGCTCCGACCCCGCGTGGGCCAGCCCTGGCTCCC-3′. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and Caco-2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Glutamax I (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10 and 20% fetal calf serum, respectively. Stable MDCK transfectants expressing wild type and mutated Lu gps were obtained after transfection of the relevant expression vectors using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc). Transfected MDCK cells were maintained in culture medium supplemented with 0.6 g/liter neomycin (G418). Lub-positive cells were detected by flow cytometry using the anti-Lub MoAb LM342 (16Inglis G. Fraser R.H. Mitchell R. Transfus Med. 1993; 3 (suppl): 94Google Scholar) and amplified by a round of selection using magnetic beads coated with anti-mouse IgG (Dynabeads-M-450, Dynal A.S, Oslo, Norway) as recommended by the manufacturer. Stable clones expressing Lu and Lu(v13) were obtained after limit dilutions. At least two clones of each were grown and then analyzed. For mutated constructs, pools with at least 90% of the cells expressing Lu antigens were analyzed. Total RNA from Caco-2 cells was extracted by Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) at day 10 of culture. RNA (50 μg) was resolved on formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane in 10× SSC (1× SSC = 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate). Hybridization with a Lu cDNA probe (7Rahuel C. Le Van Kim C. Mattei M.G. Cartron J.P. Colin Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 1865-1872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was performed using the Express HybTM hybridization solution (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), as described by the supplier. Confluent monolayers of transfected MDCK cells were cultured on 6.5-mm-diameter Costar Transwell polycarbonate filters (pore size, 0.4 mm) (Corning Costar, Acton, MA) for 7 days prior to immunostaining. Cells were fixed in a 1:9 methanol:acetone solution, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with MoAb LM342 from both sides for 1 h at room temperature. Filters were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) (1:200 dilution). Samples were examined by confocal microscopy using a Leica TCS equipped with DMR inverted microscope and a 63/1.4 objective. Wild type and transfected MDCK cells were plated at high density (5 × 105cells) onto 12-mm-diameter Costar Transwell polycarbonate filters and cultured for 5 days; the media were changed daily. The transepithelial resistance was measured daily using a Millipore Electrical Resistance System apparatus (Bedford, MA). Biotinylation was performed after resistance value had reached the plateau indicating that tight junctions were formed (17Hanzel D. Nabi I.R. Zurzolo C. Powell S.K. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 341-353PubMed Google Scholar). Control cells were grown in parallel under the same conditions and analyzed by confocal microscopy to determine that they have formed a polarized monolayer. Cells were metabolically labeled overnight by adding 150 μCi of [35S]methionine to the medium (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline-CM before incubating either the apical or the basolateral side with 0.5 mg/ml NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline with calcium and magnesium (CM) at 4 °C two times 30 min each; the nonbiotinylated surface was incubated with phosphate-buffered saline-CM only. Filters were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline-CM and excised, and cells were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C for 1 h. 100 μl of a 10% suspension of Pansorbin (Staphylococcus aureus cells) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) were added for 20 min, and cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. 10-μl aliquots were counted to ensure that cells had similar total metabolical labeling. Lu gps were immunoprecipitated by incubating the supernatant with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) precoated with 10 μg of mouse MoAb LM342 overnight. The immunocomplexes were eluted with 10 μl of 10% SDS and diluted in 600 μl of lysis buffer. 30-μl fractions were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel, and the cpm of excised Lu gps was counted to ensure that there was no difference in the total amount of Lu proteins in the cells labeled from two different sides. The remaining 570 μl were incubated overnight with immunopure-immobilized streptavidin beads. Beads were washed twice with 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin, twice with 50 mm Tris, pH 8, and boiled for 5 min in 20 μl of Laemmli buffer. 10-μl samples were run on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel under nonreducing conditions, and the gel was dried and exposed for autoradiography. Caco-2 cells were plated at high density (106 cells) onto 24-mm-diameter Costar Transwell polycarbonate filters and cultured for 10 days with the transepithelial resistance measured daily. Filters were used only when the resistance of the monolayer exceeded 250 Ω·cm2. The integrity of the monolayer was assessed by measuring the appearance of [14C]inulin in the basolateral medium after adding the tracer at the apical side. Less than 5% of the total radioactivity was recovered in the basolateral medium after 180 min. Biotinylation assay was performed as above. Delivery of newly synthesized Lu and Lu(v13) gps was followed by performing a membrane targeting assay (18Le Bivic A. Real F.X. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9313-9317Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, polarized MDCK monolayers expressing Lu or Lu(v13) were cultured onto 12-mm-diameter Costar Transwell polycarbonate filters and pulse labeled with [35S]methionine for 20 min. Cells were incubated for different times in a methionine X-10 tissue culture medium and then chilled to 4 °C in NaHCO3-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mmHepes, 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Domain-selective biotinylation and immunoprecipitation were performed as described above. Expression and polarization of endogenous Lu and Lu(v13) gps were studied in the human epithelial adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cell line. These cells differentiate and polarize spontaneously in vitro, between day 7 and day 10 of culture (19Pinto M. Robin-Leon S. Appay M.D. Kedinger M. Triadou N. Dussaulx E. La Croix B. Simon-Assman P. Haffen K. Fogh J. Zweibaum A. Biol. Cell. 1983; 47: 323-330Google Scholar). Flow cytometry analyses, using LM342 and BRIC 108 anti-Lub mouse MoAbs, revealed the presence of Lu antigens on the surface of Caco-2 cells (specific antibody binding capacity (SABC) units ≈ 75,000 versus 2000–4000 for red blood cells). 2W. El Nemer, Y. Colin, C. Bauvy, P. Codogno, R. H. Fraser, J. P. Cartron, and C. Le Van Kim, unpublished results. In order to identify which of the 2.5- and/or 4.0-kb Lu transcripts is (or are) expressed in polarized Caco-2 cells, confluent layers of Caco-2 cells were cultured on plastic dishes for 10 days. Northern blot analysis of RNA extracts revealed a strong expression of the 2.5-kb mRNA encoding Lu gp and a very weak expression of the 4.0-kb mRNA encoding the Lu(v13) isoform (Fig.1 A), strongly suggesting that the Lu gp isoform is predominantly expressed at the surface of polarized Caco-2 cells. The polarization of Lu gps in differentiated Caco-2 cells was analyzed by immunofluorescence combined with confocal microscopy. Confluent Caco-2 cells that had been grown on filters for 10 days were incubated from both sides with anti-Lub MoAb LM342, and Lu gps were visualized after incubating the cells with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. En faceviews of confocal microscopy showed the presence of Lu antigens on the lateral surface of Caco-2 cells (Fig. 1 B, b), and their absence from the apical and the basal surfaces, where no fluorescence was detected (Fig. 1 B, a and c). Vertical sections confirmed this observation and clearly showed a lateral membrane expression of Lu antigens (Fig. 1 B, d). To confirm the immunofluorescence staining results and analyze the steady state distribution of Lu gps, domain-selective biotinylation and immunoprecipitation assays were performed. Polarized monolayers of Caco-2 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and surface-biotinylated either apically or basolaterally. Lu gps were immunoprecipitated using purified MoAb LM342. Fig. 1 C shows that Lu gp isoform of 85 kDa was immunoprecipitated from the basolateral surface but was absent from the apical surface of Caco-2 cells. Conversely, Lu(v13) isoform (78 kDa) was immunoprecipitated from both the apical and basolateral surfaces but was poorly expressed as compared with Lu isoform, which is consistent with the results of the Northern blot analysis (see above). The faint expression of Lu(v13) gp may explain the absence of signal at the apical surface in the confocal microscopy experiment. Altogether, these results indicate that the Lu gp (85 kDa) is the predominant isoform in polarized Caco-2 cells and is responsible for the basolateral expression of Lu antigens. To confirm that Lu gp isoform was expressed in the basolateral domain of epithelial cells and gain further insights into the expression of Lu(v13), the polarization of transfected Lu gps were analyzed in epithelial MDCK cells. Lu- and Lu(v13)-transfected cells strongly expressed the two isoforms as demonstrated by flow cytometry using LM342 MoAb (not shown). Confluent monolayers of clones expressing Lu or Lu(v13) (two clones for each isoform) were filter-grown and allowed to polarize. En face views of confocal microscopy showed a basolateral labeling of Lu gp isoform and a nonpolarized expression of Lu(v13) isoform (Fig.2 A, a–c). Vertical sections confirmed that Lu gp isoform is almost exclusively localized on the basolateral and, more precisely, on the lateral membrane. Conversely, Lu(v13) is expressed on both apical and basolateral surfaces (Fig.2 A, d). However, it is noteworthy that Lu(v13) is overexpressed on the apical membrane when compared with its expression on the basolateral surface. Biotinylation and immunoprecipitation experiments on polarized monolayers of the same clones revealed that the Lu gp isoform (immunoprecipitated with an apparent molecular mass of 85 kDa) is expressed mainly on the basolateral surface (94%), whereas Lu(v13) (78 kDa) is predominantly expressed on the apical surface (72%) (Fig.2 B). The overexpression of Lu(v13) at the apical surface was not due to a general sorting defect or saturation of the basolateral pathway of MDCK-transfected cells because clones used in these experiments expressed similar amounts of recombinant Lu or Lu(v13) gps. These results are in agreement with those of the confocal microscopy and indicate the presence of a basolateral sorting signal in the 40 amino acids specific to the Lu gp cytoplasmic tail, which are absent in Lu(v13) gp. It is known that nonpolar expression in polarized epithelial cells could result from two different mechanisms. First, proteins exhibiting a nonpolar expression at a steady state can be simultaneously targeted from the trans-Golgi network to the apical and the basolateral surfaces through the direct apical and basolateral pathways. Nonpolar proteins can also be directly addressed to the basolateral compartment, endocytosed, and transported to the apical surface via endosomes (for a review, see Ref.20Mostov K. Apodaca G. Aroeti B. Okamoto C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). As Lu(v13) exhibited a nonpolar steady state expression in polarized MDCK cells, it was interesting to examine which of these mechanisms is used. Pulse-chase membrane targeting assay was performed to monitor the delivery of newly synthesized Lu and Lu(v13) proteins using MDCK clones expressing the same amounts of each isoform (SABC ≈ 700,000). Fig.3 A shows that newly synthesized Lu(v13) reached apical and basolateral surfaces simultaneously within 30 min of chase and that delivery to both surfaces occurred with similar kinetics. These results indicated that Lu(v13) was directly transported to each surface domain. In contrast, the Lu gp isoform was predominantly and directly targeted to the basolateral surface domain after 30 min of chase (Fig. 3 B). These data demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal 40-amino acid fragment specific to the 85-kDa Lu gp isoform contains a basolateral sorting signal that acts as a dominant signal, preventing this isoform from taking the apical pathway. However, in contrast to its exclusive basolateral endogenous expression in Caco-2 cells (see above), a small proportion of the recombinant Lu isoform was detected at the apical domain of the transfected MDCK cells. The 10-fold overexpression of transfected Lu gp in MDCK cells (SABC ≈ 700,000) as compared with the endogenous expression in Caco-2 cells (SABC ≈ 75,000) might account for the delivery of small amounts of the Lu gp to the apical surface. Alternatively, because delivery to the cell surface can be influenced by both the cell type and the protein features (20Mostov K. Apodaca G. Aroeti B. Okamoto C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), a fraction of the Lu gp might be delivered to the apical surface in MDCK but not in Caco-2 cells. Confocal microscopy and steady state biotinylation assays demonstrated basolateral sorting of Lu gp isoform and a nonpolar expression of Lu(v13) gp in MDCK cells. To identify the determinant(s) responsible for the sorting of Lu gp to the basolateral surface, mutations were introduced into the 40-amino acid fragment specific to the cytoplasmic tail of Lu gp isoform (Fig.4 A). Pools of enriched transfected cells, with more than 90% of the cells expressing each recombinant protein, were used for immunofluorescent staining and domain-selective biotinylation assay, as described above (two assays for each mutant). In the first mutant (LuΔ25), the cytoplasmic tail of Lu gp was deleted for the terminal 25 amino acids. Confocal microscopy (not shown) and selective biotinylation showed a nonpolar expression of LuΔ25 gp similar to that of Lu(v13), with 68% of the protein expressed on the apical surface (Fig. 4 B). The absence of the basolateral polarization of LuΔ25 gp indicated that the basolateral sorting signal is most probably localized in the 25 amino acids that have been deleted in this mutant. To define which of the 25 terminal amino acids of Lu gp are necessary for basolateral sorting, we constructed two other mutants in which residues were substituted into alanines (L608A/L609A and S621A) (Fig.4 A). The dileucine motif at position 608–609 was substituted to dialanine in L608A/L609A, because it was reported that dihydrophobic motifs, such as leucine-valine and leucine-leucine, might be involved in the basolateral sorting of several proteins (for a review, see Ref. 21Yeaman C. Grindstaff K.K. Nelson W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 73-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In the second construct (S621A), a substitution of the potentially phosphorylated serine to alanine at position 621 was introduced. Confocal microscopy (not shown) and surface biotinylation revealed that the S621A mutant had a polarized expression similar to Lu gp, with 95% of the protein expressed basolaterally (Fig.4 B). This indicates that potential phosphorylation of serine 621 is not required for basolateral sorting. In contrast, the L608A/L609A mutant was expressed in a nonpolarized manner on both apical and basolateral surfaces, with an overexpression at the apical surface (72%), similar to the apical expression of Lu(v13) (Fig.4 B). In order to investigate whether complementary amino acid residues could be involved in the targeting of the Lu gp as it was described for some other proteins (22Reich V. Mostov K. Aroeti B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2133-2139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Maisner A. Zimmer G. Liszewski M.K. Lublin D.M. Atkinson J.P. Herrler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20793-20799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we constructed two other mutants with alanine substitutions in the remaining 15 amino acids specific to the Lu gp (P590A/P593A and S596A/S598A) (Fig. 4 A). Pro-590 and Pro-593 were substituted into Ala-590 and Ala-593 because this motif is a potential binding site for Src homology 3 domains, which could be involved in intracellular signaling pathways (1Parsons S.F. Mallinson G. Holmes C.H. Houlihan J.M. Simpson K.L. Mawby W.J. Spurr N.K. Warne D. Barclay A.N. Anstee D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5496-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The potentially phosphorylated serines (amino acids 596 and 598) were also substituted into alanines. As shown in Fig. 4 B, these two mutants exhibited a polarized expression pattern. More than 92% of the proteins were expressed basolaterally, indicating that neither the potential Src homology 3 binding motif nor the potential phosphorylation site at position 596–598 represent complementary basolateral signals. All of these results clearly indicated the role of the dileucine motif at position 608–609 in the basolateral expression of Lu gp isoform. In this study, we have demonstrated that the two Lu gp isoforms resulting from alternative splicing of the primary LUtranscript, which differ only in the size of their cytoplasmic tail, exhibit different polarization patterns in epithelial cells. We showed that Caco-2 colon carcinoma cells at day 10 of culture expressed almost exclusively the long tail Lu gp and that the localization of this isoform at the basolateral surface of the plasma membrane accounts for the polarized expression of the Lu/B-CAM antigens in these in vitro differentiated cells. In MDCK cells, recombinant Lu gp is also expressed at the basolateral surface, whereas Lu(v13) was expressed in a nonpolarized fashion. This difference in the steady state distribution of the two Lu gp isoforms is associated with the presence of a dileucine motif within the 40 extra amino acids of Lu gp cytoplasmic tail. The targeting features of Lu and Lu(v13) gps were also investigated. The Lu isoform was shown to be targeted directly to the basolateral surface in MDCK cells, and the Lu(v13) isoform was delivered to the apical and basolateral surfaces with the same kinetics. Therefore, Lu(v13) gp takes the direct apical pathway without transiting by the basolateral domain, as was shown for the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) transfected into MDCK cells (24Mostov K.E. de Bruyn Kops A. Deitcher D.L. Cell. 1986; 7: 359-364Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Whether Lu(v13) is delivered in a nonpolarized fashion by default or because it contains both permeable apical and basolateral signals remains to be elucidated. However, Lu(v13) was found to be sorted predominantly apically in MDCK cells, whereas delivery to both surfaces by default should not give more than 50% of Lu(v13) gp on the apical surface as apical:basolateral surface area ratio in MDCK cells is close to 1 (25Butor C. Davoust J. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 203: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is therefore assumed that Lu(v13) might contain cryptic apical sorting information. It has been reported that theN-glycans on the extracellular domain (26Scheiffele P. Peränen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 27Urban J. Parczyk K. Leutz A. Kayne M. Kondor-Koch C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2735-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) or amino acid sequences within the transmembrane domain (28Lin S. Naim H.Y. Rodriguez A.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) of integral proteins represent important determinants for sorting to the apical membrane domain of MDCK cells. Indeed, it has been shown that deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of neural cell adhesion molecule, a basolateral protein that also belongs to the Ig superfamily, resulted in a truncated soluble form that is exclusively secreted apically (29Le Gall A.H. Powell S.K. Yeaman C.A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 14: 4559-4567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Further experiments will be required to determine whether some or all of the five N-glycosylation sites and/or the transmembrane domain of the Lu(v13) gp could play a role in its apical sorting. Mutations into the potential Src homology 3 binding domain, as well as mutations of three potentially phosphorylated serines in the cytoplasmic tail of Lu gp, did not alter the basolateral sorting of this isoform. These results demonstrated that these motifs, which are potentially involved in signal transduction, are not recognized as sorting sequences. In contrast, we showed that the basolateral sorting of Lu gp is attributable to a dominant basolateral sorting signal contributed by the dileucine motif at position 608–609. Disruption of this dileucine lateral sorting motif results in the accumulation of Lu gp predominantly at the apical surface (72%). This dominant signal would prevent Lu gp from taking the apical delivery pathway. Most of the basolaterally targeted proteins rely totally or partially on a tyrosine residue for their basolateral delivery (30Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J.

This tyrosine residue is often part of a β-turn that is required for basolateral expression of these proteins and may, in some cases, be substituted to aliphatic residues, such as phenylalanine or tryptophan, without impeding the basolateral expression (35Pearse B.M. Robinson M.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 151-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). However, some proteins were shown to need a tyrosine-independent motif for their basolateral expression. These basolateral motifs rely on a dileucine motif (36Letourneur F. Klausner R.D.

Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-based, as well as dileucine-based, sorting signals can be recognized by clathrin adaptor protein complexes (for a review, see Ref. 21Yeaman C. Grindstaff K.K. Nelson W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 73-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Interactions between tyrosine-based signals and the medium (μ) chain of these complexes have been demonstrated (42Boll W. Ohno H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29009-29015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and recent evidence indicates that dihydrophobic signals bind to the β-chain rather than the μ-chain of adaptor complexes (44Rapoport I. Chen Y.C. Cupers P. Shoelson S.E. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2148-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A recently described adaptor complex, AP3, also interacts with tyrosine- and dileucine-based signals (45Simpson F. Bright N.A. West M.A. Newman L.S. Darnell R.B. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 46Honing S. Sandoval I.V. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Which of these clathrin adaptor complexes interacts with the dileucine motif present in the cytoplasmic tail of Lu gp is currently under study. In conclusion, the present demonstration that the two Lu gp isoforms exhibit different polarization expression pattern supports our previous hypothesis (7Rahuel C. Le Van Kim C. Mattei M.G. Cartron J.P. Colin Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 1865-1872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that the nonpolarized expression of the Lu/B-CAM antigens observed in some epithelial cancers (5Chesa-Garin P. Sanz-Moncasi M.P. Campbell I.G. Rettig W.J. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 5: 1261-1266PubMed Google Scholar) should result from the overexpression of the Lu(v13) isoform. Further investigations necessary to validate this hypothesis would also help to evaluate the potential role of Lu(v13) in epithelial tumor progression and metastasis.

https://openalex.org/W2023386466,"p53 is a transcription factor that is activated by genotoxic stress and mediates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Here we demonstrate that infection of mouse liver with recombinant E1/E3-deleted adenovirus leads to p53 activation and simultaneously to the down-regulation of albumin gene expression. In vitrotranscription assays indicate that transcriptional mechanisms mediated through the albumin promoter are responsible for reduced albumin mRNA levels during viral infection. Albumin expression is maintained in the liver by a combination of liver-enriched transcription factors such as CAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)α and C/EBPβ. We show that p53 wild type and tumor-derived p53 mutations repress C/EBP-mediated transactivation of the albumin promoter. The binding of C/EBPα or -β to its cognate sequence in the albumin promoter is not inhibited by p53 expression. Deletion analysis and domain swapping experiments show that repression of C/EBPβ-mediated transactivation is dependent on the N-terminal domain of p53 and the transactivation domain, leucine zipper domain, and the inhibitory domain II (amino acids 163–191) of C/EBPβ. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the p53-mediated down-regulation of liver-specific gene expression after viral infection. Additionally, as overexpression of p53 mutants is frequently found in undifferentiated hepatocellular carcinomas, the same mechanisms may contribute to the lack of liver-specific gene transcription in these tumors. p53 is a transcription factor that is activated by genotoxic stress and mediates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Additionally, as overexpression of p53 mutants is frequently found in undifferentiated hepatocellular carcinomas, the same mechanisms may contribute to the lack of liver-specific gene transcription in these tumors. As a “guardian of the genome,” p53 mediates cell cycle arrest and subsequently DNA repair or apoptosis, depending on the cellular environment and the degree of cellular damage (for review, see Refs. 1Selivanova G. Wiman K.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 66: 143-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholarand 2Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Compared with other tumor suppressor genes, p53 has an unusual spectrum of mutations in human tumors. Most of the p53 gene alterations are missense mutations, which occur in the DNA-binding domain of one p53 allele associated with a deletion of the second allele (3Greenblatt M.S. Bennett W.P. Hollstein M. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4855-4878PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hussain S.P. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4023-4037PubMed Google Scholar). The spectrum of p53 gene mutations and the observation that most of the p53 missense mutations are usually strongly overexpressed in human tumors indicate a positive selection rather than a loss during carcinogenesis. Several studies show that the introduction of specific p53 mutations into tumor cells with p53 deletions in both alleles confer increased growth rate, tumorigenicity, metastatic potential, and resistance to chemotherapy (5Dittmer D.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar).The p53 gene appears to be a frequent target for mutations in hepatocellular carcinomas from high risk areas, whereas the average frequency of p53 missense mutations in hepatocellular carcinomas from low risk areas is only 10–30% (11Unsal H. Yakicier C. Marcais C. Kew M. Volkmann M. Zentgraf H. Isselbacher K.J. Ozturk M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12Kubicka S. Trautwein C. Schrem H. Tillman H. Manns M.P. J. Hepatol. 1995; 23: 412-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The p53 alterations in hepatocellular carcinomas from high incidence areas are preferentially G to T substitutions at the third nucleotide pair of codon 249 (13Hsu I.C. Metcalf R.A. Sun T. Welsh J.A. Wang N.J. Harris C.C. Nature. 1991; 350: 427-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). Experimental and epidemiological data indicate that aflatoxin B1 exposure results in mutations at p53 codon 249 (14Aguilar F. Hussain S.P. Cerutti P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Another mechanism for inactivating the function of p53 in hepatitis B associated hepatocellular carcinomas is the binding of p53 wild type by the viral protein HBx and the blockage of p53 entry into the nucleus. As a consequence liver tumors developed without evidence of p53 mutations in a HBx transgenic mouse model (16Ueda H. Ullrich S.J. Gangemi J.D. Kappel C.A. Ngo L. Feitelson M.A. Jay G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Although p53 wild type function was impaired by HBx binding, in some animals a small proportion of cells in advanced tumors acquired p53 mutations, which suggests that p53 missense mutations harbor a selection advantage in hepatocarcinogenesis and may contribute to tumor progression.Actually, it has been shown in several studies that in human hepatocellular carcinomas p53 mutations are closely related to the progression and the dedifferentiation of the tumors (17Oda T.

In contrast, wild type p53 inhibits the C/EBPβ-mediated gene transcription (25Margulies L. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15096-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wang L.

It was recently suspected that p53 wild type decreases sequence-specific DNA binding of C/EBP transcription factors due to protein-protein interaction (27Webster N.J.G. Resnik J.L. Reichart D.B. Strauss B. Haas M. Seely B.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2781-2788PubMed Google Scholar). However, the influence of p53 wild type or hepatocellular carcinoma-derived p53 mutations on liver-specific gene transcription is still unknown.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and PlasmidsThe human hepatoma cell lines HepG2, Huh7 and Hep3B and 293T cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The Hep3B cell line was maintained in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with antibiotics, l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The 293T, HepG2, and Huh7 cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics, l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C.The plasmids used for transfection were CMV promoter-driven expression vectors and a CAT-reporter plasmid. The reporter plasmid contained 400 bp of the human albumin promotor (pAlbumin-CAT) upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene as described before (28Pietrangelo A. Panduro A.

A pCMV-βgal vector (CMVβ;CLONTECH) was used as an internal standard and was cotransfected in each experiment. The CMV-p53wt expression vector (pC53SN3) was generously provided by B. Vogelstein. The expression vectors for the tumor-derived p53 missense mutations Tyr-220 → Cys, Arg-249 → Met, and Arg-249 → Ser were obtained by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis as described before (33Kubicka S. Trautwein C. Niehof M. Manns M.P. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The plasmids for the expression of p53 deletions were kindly provided by S.

Expression vectors for the C/EBPβ deletions (pCRP2Δ116–149, pCRP2Δ163–191) and the C/EBPβ chimeric proteins (pMexCRP2–1-47(VP16), pMexCRP2-GCN4) were kindly provided by P. Johnson (31Williams C.W. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The adenoviral vector Ad5-CMVlacZ was kindly provided by D. Brenner (37Bradham C.A. Qian T.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6353-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar).Transfection Experiments and CAT AssaysHepatoma cells (HepG2, Hep3B and Huh7) and 293T cells were grown on 60-mm dishes to 60% confluence when used for transfection experiments. Hepatoma cell lines were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method and an overnight incubation at 3% CO2 and 35 °C. Transient transfection of 293T cells were performed as described (38Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 54: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The amount of reporter and expression vectors used in the experiments, is indicated in the figure legends. The total DNA concentration was kept constant in each transfection experiment by adding pBSK+ (Stratagene) to a final amount of 6 μg of DNA/dish. All transfection mixtures for CAT assay analysis contained 0.5 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid CMV-β-gal (CLONTECH) as an internal standard for transfection efficacy. CAT assays were performed 48 h after transfection using thin layer chromatography for the separation of the reaction products. CAT assays were quantified by using a Fuji Imager and normalized to transfection efficacies by β-galactosidase assays. All transfection experiments were repeated at least three times.Nuclear Extracts, in Vitro Transcription and Translation of C/EBPβ, and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)Nuclear extracts were isolated from mouse liver as described by Lichtsteiner et al. (39Lichtsteiner S. Wuarin J. Schibler U. Cell. 1987; 51: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) or from hepatoma cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B) transiently cotransfected with 3 μg of the p53 expression vectors and 3 μg of the C/EBPα or C/EBPβ expression vectors, using the Dignam C method as described before (30Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar).For in vitro translation of C/EBPβ, the pet vectors system was used as described earlier (40Trautwein C. van der Geer P. Karin M. Hunter T. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2554-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The cDNA was subcloned into a bacterial expression vector and transformed into E. colistrain BL21/DE-3/pLys S. The protein was induced and purified as described before (40Trautwein C. van der Geer P. Karin M. Hunter T. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2554-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from 293T cells were prepared by the Dignam C method after transfection with 6 μg of the p53 expression vectors.EMSA experiments were performed using nuclear extracts or in vitro translated protein as indicated and 1 ng of end-labeled DNA. The D-site of the human albumin promoter served as the cognate DNA binding sequence for C/EBPα and C/EBPβ in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (41Poll V. Mancini F.P. Cortese R. Cell. 1990; 63: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). For determining the sequence-specific DNA binding capacity of p53, the consensus site of p53 was used (5′-GGGCATGTCCGGGCAT-3′). The oligonucleotides were purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium) and used as 32P-labeled probes.Binding buffer consisted of 25 mm HEPES (pH7, 6), 5 mm MgCl2, 34 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)/μl, and 2 μg of bovine serum albumin/μl. The binding reaction was incubated for 30 min on ice and subsequently separated in a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was carried out for 4 h at 300 V. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed for autoradiography.SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot AnalysisProtein concentrations of nuclear extracts were measured by Bio-Rad Microassay (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). 10 μg of nuclear extracts were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto Hybond N membrane (Millipore, Frankfurt, Germany). As primary antibodies we used p53 pAb240 (Dianova, Hamburg), C/EBPα 14AA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and a polyclonal C/EBPβ antibody as described before (30Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the ECL detection system as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany).Northern Blot AnalysisNorthern blot analysis was performed according to standard procedures. Total RNA was isolated with the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 15 μg of total RNA was analyzed through a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel, followed by transfer to Hybond N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The albumin, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and β-actin cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]ATP according to random priming (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany).In Vitro Transcription AssayIn vitro transcription assays were performed as described by Gorski et al. (42Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schiebler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). As DNA templates we used the G-less cassette-containing constructs Alb 400 and AdML 200 G-free, which were a generous gift from U. Schibler. Nuclear extracts were isolated from rat liver by the method described by Lichtsteiner et al. (39Lichtsteiner S. Wuarin J. Schibler U. Cell. 1987; 51: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts and template DNA were preincubated on ice for 15 min in a total volume of 17 μl. 3 μl of the reaction mix containing 20× NTP, RNasin, and 10 μCi of [32P]UTP were added. The transcription was performed for 45 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding the stop buffer (250 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7, 5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS), 2 μl of 10 mg/ml tRNA, and 4 μl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K solution. After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the RNAs were separated on a 8% polyacrylamide/urea gel, visualized by autoradiography, and quantified by Fuji phosphoimager.Adenoviral Vector, in Vivo Infection of Mouse and Rat LiverTo exclude immunological elimination of infected hepatocytes, we used nude mice and nude rats for our experiments. Female NMRI-nu/nu mice and female NZNU-nu/nu rats were obtained from the Zentrales Tierlaboratorium (Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany).The recombinant, replication-deficient adenoviral vector Ad5-CMV-lacZ was prepared, purified, and titered as described previously (37Bradham C.A. Qian T. Streetz K. Trautwein C. Brenner D.A. Lemasters J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6353-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Ad5-CMV-lacZ is an adenovirus type 5-based, E1/E3-deleted vector, containing the CMV promoter-driven E. coli lacZgene (coding for the β-gal protein) (37Bradham C.A. Qian T. Streetz K. Trautwein C. Brenner D.A. Lemasters J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6353-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The recombinant adenovirus was stored in a buffer solution of 10% glycerol, 10 mmTris/HCl, pH 7,4, and 1 mm MgCl2. In vivo adenoviral infection was carried out by the administration of Ad vector into the tail vein of nude mice or rats at a concentration of 1 × 109 plaque-forming units/g. Mice and rats were injected with 0,3 ml of a solution obtained by dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8,0, 1 mm MgCl2, 140 mm NaCl at 4 °C. To evaluate the efficacy of Ad vectors infecting the hepatocytes in vivo, liver specimen of mice and rats were frozen on dry ice and subsequently frozen sections were stained with β-gal substrate X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside).RESULTSViral Infection of the Liver Is Associated with an Increase in p53 Expression and Repression of Albumin Gene TranscriptionViral infection of the liver triggers mechanisms in hepatocytes that are either directly related to the virus or a consequence of an immune response directed against viral epitopes. To exclude mechanisms related to the immune system, we used nude mice and nude rats for our experiments. In vivo infection of mouse and rat liver with recombinant adenovirus was performed by administration of 0.3 ml of a solution containing 1 × 109 plaque-forming units/g into the tail vein. X-gal staining of a specimen of the liver demonstrated that approximately 80–100% of the hepatocytes are infected with viral particles (Fig.2 A).Figure 2A, staining of mouse liver with X-gal, 24 h after infection with recombinant adenovirus Ad5-CMV-Lacz. Approximately 80–100% of the hepatocytes are infected with the adenovirus and express the β-gal marker gene. B, response of mouse liver after adenoviral infection. Nuclear extracts and total RNA were isolated from mouse livers 8 and 24 h after adenoviral infection. As a control (C), mice were used which were injected with 0.3 ml of the dialyzed puffer without adenoviral particles. Northern and Western blot analysis demonstrate the down-regulation of albumin mRNA, although the protein and the mRNA levels of the transcription factors C/EBPα and -β remain constant. Concurrent with the albumin mRNA down-regulation p53 protein is up-regulated. Gel shift experiments reveal the that the sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 is activated after adenoviral infection. Specific p53/DNA complex formation (black arrow) is confirmed by supershift with p53 antibody pAb421 (Dianova) (white arrow). Positive controls (P) for p53 and C/EBPα and -β Western blots were obtained by isolation of nuclear extracts of 293T cells, 48 h after a transient transfection with 6 μg of p53 and C/EBPα and -β expression vectors. C, transcriptional activity of the albumin promoter after adenoviral infection. In vitrotranscription assays were performed with nuclear extracts, isolated at the time point 48 h after tail vein injection of rats. The construct containing adenovirus major late promoter (AdML 200) linked to a G-less cassette of 200 bp was used as a control (C) and added in all incubation mixes with the construct containing the albumin promoter (Alb 400) linked to a G-less cassette of 400 bp.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mice were sacrificed 8 and 24 h after viral infection, and the livers were harvested for isolation of nuclear extracts and total RNA. Northern blot analysis demonstrated a significant down-regulation of albumin mRNA expression 8 and 24 h after viral infection (Fig.2 B). In contrast, the mRNA and protein levels of the liver-enriched transcription factors C/EBPα and C/EBPβ remained constant. As virus infection may induce genotoxic stress, p53 expression was studied. An increase in nuclear p53 expression was found, which was associated with down-regulation of albumin mRNA levels (Fig. 2 B). Using gel shift experiments, an increase in p53 sequence-specific DNA binding was evident 8 and 24 h after virus infection (Fig. 2 B).To assess whether the decrease of albumin mRNA expression level was transcriptionally mediated through the albumin promoter, in vitro transcription analysis was performed. Albumin-specific transcription was measured using a construct where the albumin promoter was combined with a G-less cassette of 400 bp (Fig. 2 C). As an internal control, the adenovirus major late promoter was included. Fig. 2 C shows that 48 h after adenoviral infection of rat liver the transcriptional activity of the albumin promoter was reduced to approximately 17%, while transcription of the AdML promoter was unaffected. Therefore, these experiments indicate that transcriptional mechanisms mediated through the promoter reduce albumin mRNA levels after adenoviral transduction.p53 Modulates C/EBPβ-dependent Transactivation of the Albumin Promoterp53 wild type represses the activity of a variety of promoters by complex formation with TBP and with other transcription factors. Furthermore, p53 wild type specifically inhibits C/EBPβ-mediated transactivation (25Margulies L. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15096-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wang L. Rayanade R.J. Garcia D. Patel K. Pan H. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23159-23165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our in vivoresults show that down-regulation of albumin gene transcription was associated with p53 overexpression. Therefore, we were interested to study the role of wild type and mutant p53 for the transcriptional control of the albumin promoter.Binding of liver-specific transcription factors to the B- and D-site in the albumin promoter confers high transcription of the gene in differentiated hepatocytes, while this regulation is impaired in hepatoma cells. By cotransfecting expression vectors for either C/EBPα or -β with an albumin promoter construct, higher transcription can be reconstituted in hepatoma cells, as shown in Figs. 3 and4. Three hepatoma cell lines with different p53 status were included in this study. HepG2 cells express wild type p53 and Huh7 cells overexpress the p53–220C mutation, while in Hep3B cells the p53 gene is deleted. Cotransfection experiments were performed in all cell lines with an albumin reporter plasmid and expression vectors for C/EBPβ and p53wt. Additionally, the hepatocellular carcinoma-derived p53 mutations p53–249M, p53–249S, and p53–220C, which are unable to transactivate p53-responsive genes (33Kubicka S. Trautwein C. Niehof M. Manns M.P. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), were included.Figure 3A, effect of p53 wild type and hepatocellular carcinoma-derived p53 mutations on the C/EBPβ transactivation of the human albumin promoter. Three hepatoma cell lines were used with different p53 backgrounds: Hep3B (p53: deleted/deleted), HepG2 (p53: wt/wt), and Huh7 (p53: deleted/220C). Hepatoma cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and transfected with 6 μg of DNA after 24 h, using the calcium phosphate method. All proteins were expressed under the transcriptional control of the CMV immediate early promoter/enhancer. Amounts of expression vectors used are indicated. CAT assays were performed 48 h after transfection. The CAT activity obtained with the C/EBPβ-induced albumin-CAT in the absence of p53 expression vectors was set to 100%. The results shown represent the mean of three independent experiments. B, dose-dependent effect of p53 wild type and p53–249S on transcription of the albumin promoter. Hep3B cells were used for these experiments, which lack any intrinsic p53 expression. Cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and transfected with 6 μg of DNA after 24 h, using the calcium phosphate method. Amounts of expression vectors used are indicated. Albumin promoter activity was stimulated in all experiments by cotransfecting 0.5 μg of C/EBPβ expression vector.

https://openalex.org/W1978581660,"A docking model of the α2 I-domain and collagen has been proposed based on their crystal structures (Emsley, J., King, S., Bergelson, J., and Liddington, R. C. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 28512–28517). In this model, several amino acid residues in the I-domain make direct contact with collagen (Asn-154, Asp-219, Leu-220, Glu-256, His-258, Tyr-285, Asn-289, Leu-291, Asn-295, and Lys-298), and the protruding C-helix of α2 (residues 284–288) determines ligand specificity. Because most of the proposed critical residues are not conserved, different I-domains are predicted to bind to collagen differently. We found that deleting the entire C-helix or mutating the predicted critical residues had no effect on collagen binding to whole α2β1, with the exception that mutating Asn-154, Asp-219, and His-258 had a moderate effect. We performed further studies and found that mutating the conserved surface-exposed residues in the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) (Tyr-157 and Gln-215) significantly blocks collagen binding. We have revised the docking model based on the mutagenesis data. In the revised model, conserved Tyr-157 makes contact with collagen in addition to the previously proposed Asn-154, Asp-219, His-258, and Tyr-285 residues. These results suggest that the collagen-binding I-domains (e.g. α1, α2, and α10) bind to collagen in a similar fashion.

This domain adopts a classic “Rossmann” fold and consists of a hydrophobic β-sheet in the middle and amphipathic α-helices on both sides. Interestingly, the integrin I-domain contains a Mg2+/Mn2+ coordination site at its surface, which is not present in proteins with similar structures (e.g. the NAD binding domain of lactate dehydrogenase) or the vWf A1 and A3 domains (21Emsley J.

The Asp and Thr residues in α2 that have been shown to be critical for ligand binding are involved in the coordination of a divalent cation in the crystal structure (20Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The α2 I-domain has a unique helix (the C-helix) protruding from the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) that creates a groove centered on the magnesium ion. Emsley et al. (20Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) proposed a model in which a collagen triple helix fits into the groove and a Glu side chain from collagen coordinates the metal ion. In this model, the C-helix is a major determinant for collagen binding. It was predicted that the following I-domain residues make direct contact with collagen: Asn-154 (the βA-α1 turn), Asp-219 and Leu-220 (the α3-α4 turn), Glu-256 and His-258 (the βD-α5 turn), and Tyr-285, Asn-289, Leu-291, Asn-295 and Lys-298 (the C-helix, α6 and C-α6 turn). However, these residues are not well conserved among collagen-binding I-domains (e.g.α1, α2, and α10), suggesting that different I-domains interact with collagen in different manners. Here we show that mutation of the residues proposed to be critical for ligand binding or deletion of the entire C-helix did not significantly affect collagen binding to whole α2β1expressed on mammalian cells except for Asn-154, Asp-219, and His-258. In contrast, mutating several conserved MIDAS residues including Tyr-157 significantly blocks collagen binding. We have revised the docking model based on the mutagenesis data. In the revised model, interaction between the α2 I-domain and collagen is mediated by relatively conserved residues in the MIDAS on the N-terminal side of the I-domain. Thus, it is suggested that the collagen-binding I-domains (e.g. α1, α2, and α10) bind collagen in a similar fashion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMonoclonal AntibodiesHAS-3 and HAS-4 (25Tenchini M.L.

Cells were harvested with 3.5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline and washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 105cells (in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) were added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound cells. Bound cells were quantified by assaying endogenous phosphatase activity (26Prater C.A. Plotkin J. Jaye D.

Horjales E. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Graphics. 1984; 2: 53-54Crossref Google Scholar). The glutamate of one of the GER motifs was attached to the Mg2+ion of the MIDAS motif via one of its carboxylate oxygens at a distance of 2.0 Å. Keeping the I-domain fixed, the collagen was then allowed to rotate around a fixed point (the glutamate oxygen) to minimize the distance between the collagen and the side chains of those residues which showed reduced collagen binding when mutated and which were exposed on the surface of the I-domain. Unfavorably close contacts (<2.5 Å) between the collagen and the I-domain were monitored using the program TOM. Because the triple helical nature of collagen generates three chemically distinct strands even for a homo-tripeptide (which we call the leading, middle, and trailing strands) each of these was tested separately.Other MethodsSwapping mutagenesis was carried out using the overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (30Horton R.M. Pease L.R. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis; A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 217-247Google Scholar). The positions of the α2 sequences replaced by homologous αLsequences are residues 152–157, 212–219, and 257–262 (designated βA-α1, α3-α4, and βD-α5, respectively) (see Fig. 1). Deletion of residues 284–291 (designated αC del) and point mutations were created by site-directed mutagenesis using the unique site elimination method with a double-stranded vector (31Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The presence of mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transfection of cDNAs into CHO cells by electroporation, selection of transfected cells with G418, and flow cytometry were carried out as described previously (32Takada Y. Ylanne J. Mandelman D. Puzon W. Ginsberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe MIDAS of the α2 I-domain is composed of four loops (the βA-α1, α3-α4, βD-α5, and βE-α6 loops). The conserved residues Asp-151 in the βA-α1 loop, Thr-221 in the α3-α4 loop, and Asp-254 in the βD-α5 loop are critical for cation coordination and ligand binding (13Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A unique C-helix is inserted within the βE-α6 loop in the I-domains of the collagen-binding integrins α1, α2, and α10 but is not present in the I-domains of αM or αL, or the A3 domain of vWf. This C-helix has been predicted to be a major determinant for collagen binding (20Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).To identify the residues in the MIDAS that are critical for collagen binding, we introduced multiple point mutations into each MIDAS loop. We also included amino acid residues (Asn-154, Asp-219, Leu-220, Glu-256, His-258, Tyr-285, Asn-289, Leu-291, and Asn-295) that have been predicted to make direct contact with collagen (20Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Mutant α2 was transfected into CHO cells together with a neomycin-resistant gene and selected for G-418 resistance. Cells stably expressing the mutant α2 were used for adhesion assays. Fig. 2 shows the adhesion of the mutants to collagen type I expressed as a percentage of cells adherent to collagen per percentage of human α2 positive cells (normalized adhesion to collagen). We found that mutating several residues in the βA-α1 loop (Ser-153 and Tyr-157) and the α3-α4 loop (Gln-215) blocks collagen binding. In addition, mutation of Asn-154 and Ser-155 in the βA-α1 loop, Asp-219 in the α3-α4 loop, and His-258 in the βD-α5 loop produced an inhibitory effect at lower collagen coating concentrations.Figure 2Effects of point mutations on collagen binding. Cells stably expressing wild type or mutant α2 were used to determine adhesion to collagen (at a 10 or 2 μg/ml coating concentration, filledcolumn andblank column, respectively). Data are presented as percent bound cells to collagen per percent human α2 positive cells to normalize α2 expression. Typically 40–60% of cells are positive after selection with G-418. Previously published function-negative mutations (D151A, T221A, and D254A) are included as negative controls. These results suggest that several relatively conserved residues in the βA-α1, α3-α4, and βD-α5 loops are critical for collagen binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also swapped the βA-α1 (residues 152–157), α3-α4 (residues 212–219), and βD-α5 loops (residues 257–262) with the corresponding sequences of αL, which does not interact with collagen (Fig. 1). These swapping mutations did not change the conserved residues Asp-151, Thr-221, and Asp-254, which are critical for cation and collagen binding. Cells expressing mutant α2 were tested for their ability to adhere to collagen. The expression of the α3-α4 swapping mutant was too low to produce reliable adhesion data (data not shown). Other mutants showed a surface-expression level comparable with that of wild type and reacted with multiple monoclonal antibodies against α2 (Fig. 3a). The βA-α1 swapping mutant showed collagen binding at a background level. Also, the βD-α5 swapping mutant showed significantly reduced collagen binding. These results are consistent with those obtained using alanine-scanning mutagenesis.Figure 3Effects of swapping/deletion mutations on collagen binding. A, clonal CHO cells stably expressing wild type or mutant α2 were incubated in the well coated with collagen type I or bovine serum albumin (negative control). After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, non-adherent cells were removed and bound cells were determined by assaying endogenous phosphatase. Under the conditions used more than 80% of cells adhered to fibronectin as a positive control. Solid bar, BSA, bovine serum albumin; hatched bar, collagen;MFI, mean fluorescence intensity. B, adhesion to collagen of wild type and the αC deletion mutant α2 was determined as a function of collagen coating concentrations. The data suggest that the adhesive function of the αC deletion mutant is comparable with that of wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast, mutation of amino acid residues in the βE-α6 loop, including the C-helix, did not have any inhibitory effect on collagen binding. Mutation of Tyr-285, Asn-289, Leu-291, and Asn-295, which are predicted to make direct contact with collagen, did not significantly affect collagen binding, even at low (2 μg/ml) collagen coating concentrations (Fig.2). It is possible that single amino acid substitution may not be enough to induce a detectable effect on collagen binding. So, we deleted most of the βE-α6 loop, including the entire C-helix, to determine whether the C-helix is critical for ligand specificity. These mutant α2 cDNAs were stably expressed on CHO cells and further cloned to obtain high expressors. The αC deletion mutant showed collagen binding at a level comparable with that of wild type (Fig.3 A). Adhesion of the αC deletion mutant as a function of collagen coating concentration was tested. Adhesion to collagen of both wild type and αC deletion mutant α2β1 was saturated at about 1 μg/ml collagen coating concentration, indicating that the affinity to collagen is not affected by the αCdeletion (Fig. 3 B).These results suggest that collagen binding is mediated by relatively conserved MIDAS residues, which are located on the N-terminal side of the I-domain. Ser-153 and Ser-155 are involved in metal coordination, and mutating these residues would disrupt metal binding to the I-domain. Gln-215 is part of the MIDAS face and makes the main hydrogen bond to DXSXS loop. It is likely that mutating these residues blocks collagen binding by disrupting metal binding to the I-domain. Asn-154, Asp-219, and His-258 have been predicted to make direct contact with collagen in the previous model (20Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), although the effects of mutating these residues are moderate. Tyr-157 is totally exposed to the surface, and this residue may make direct contact with collagen. Tyr-157 has not been predicted to make direct contact with collagen. Mutating the other residues that are predicted to be critical for collagen binding in the proposed model (Leu-220, Glu-256, Tyr-285, Asn-289, Leu-291, Asn-295, and Lys-298) has no significant effect on collagen binding. Even deletion of the entire C-helix did not significantly affect collagen binding. These results support the role of the MIDAS motif in collagen binding because many of the mutants that affect collagen binding are predicted to disrupt the MIDAS motif. However, the present results are not fully consistent with the proposed model for collagen/α2 I-domain binding (20Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).We have modified the collagen/α2 I-domain docking model based on the present mutagenesis data (Fig.4). Recently, short synthetic triple-helical peptide corresponding to residues 502–516 of the collagen type I α1 chain, has been shown to bind to purified α2β1 and recombinant α2 I-domain (28Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Onley D.J. Peachey A.R. Messent A.J. Smethurst P.A. Tuckwell D.S. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33287-33294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The Glu and Arg residues in the GER triplet were found to be essential for recognition by α2I-domain (28Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Onley D.J. Peachey A.R. Messent A.J. Smethurst P.A. Tuckwell D.S. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33287-33294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In the current model, we first attached the glutamate side chain of the GER motif to the MIDAS Mg2+ ion. We then rotated the collagen to minimize the distance between the collagen and those surface-exposed residues implicated in collagen binding (His-258, Tyr-157, Asp-219, and Asn-154) while maintaining the 2-Å bond between the glutamate oxygen and the Mg2+ ion and avoiding other close contacts (<2.5 Å) with the protein. It was not initially possible to make favorable hydrogen bonds with all four side chains simultaneously, so the side chains were allowed to rotate about their Cα-Cβ bonds to make plausible hydrogen bonds with the collagen backbone carbonyl oxygens and amide nitrogens. The collagen orientation was then refined to optimize the hydrogen bonding geometry. This procedure allowed all four I-domain side chains to make reasonable hydrogen bonds to the collagen. This model predicts that the side chain of Tyr-285, which projects from the C helix into the groove, makes unavoidable contact with the collagen and that further hydrogen bonds can be made between the Tyr hydroxyl and the collagen main chain. This revised model, which is rotated about 30 degrees from the previously published model, allows the arginine from the GER motif of the preceding strand to make a salt bridge to Glu-256. The previous model would not allow enough space for the arginine side chain without imposing unfavorable side chain torsion angles. Because mutation of Glu-256 does not significantly block collagen binding in the present study, this salt bridge might not be energetically important. The triple helical character of a symmetric collagen trimer generates three chemically distinct strands, which we call the leading, middle, and lagging strands. Attaching either the leading or middle strand glutamate to the Mg2+ ion leads to the same conclusions. Attaching the trailing strand makes a difference because there is no arginine from the preceding strand to form a salt-bridge to Glu-256. The alternative orientation with the collagen rotated by 180 degrees is much less favorable because the arginine of the GER motif would clash sterically with the I-domain. As pointed out in our previous model, an aspartic acid side chain in place of the GER glutamate would be too short to reach the Mg2+ ion without creating a large number of steric clashes. Because Asn-154, Tyr-157, His-258 are conserved in other collagen-binding integrin I-domains (α1 and α10), it is reasonable to assume that these residues are also involved in collagen binding in these integrins (Fig. 4). This model is consistent with the observation that tyrosine and arginine are enriched in hot spots of binding energy in the protein-protein interface (33Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar).Figure 4A revised docking model of theα2 I-domain and collagen.

We have reported that mutating these residues only partially affects collagen binding to the recombinant α2 I-domain fragment (13Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, Bienkowska et al. (23Bienkowska J. Cruz M. Atiemo A. Handin R. Liddington R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25162-25167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) reported that mutating the corresponding residues in the recombinant fragment of the vWf A3 domain does not affect collagen binding. However, the same mutation in the whole α2 molecule completely blocks collagen binding to α2β1 (13Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that cation coordination through these residues is critical for ligand binding in the I-domain of the integrin molecule but not in similar domains in non-integrin structures (e.g. vWf). Consistently, the cation-binding site is not present in the vWf A3 domain (23Bienkowska J. Cruz M. Atiemo A. Handin R. Liddington R. J. Biol.

Structure. 1997; 5: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies would be needed to clarify the role of the conserved Asp residues in integrin I-domains. Several other collagen-binding sites have been reported. A collagen binding surface on osteonectin has been mapped by mutagenesis: it consists of a flat surface 15 Å in diameter containing polar and apolar residues (34Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Gohring W. Timpl R. EMBO. J. 1998; 17: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), a crucial arginine residue, and intriguingly a Ca2+ binding site that might be directly involved in collagen binding. Docking and mutagenesis ofStaphylococcus aureus adhesin identified another crucial arginine and a narrow groove as the binding site for collagen (35Symersky J. Patti J.M. Carson M. House-Pompeo K.

The collagen binding surface on vWF-A3 has not been mapped but the structurally analogous surface lacks the charged residues found in the integrin I-domains (23Bienkowska J. Cruz M. Atiemo A.

Addition of the SL provides each mRNA with an m7G cap as well as four extensively methylated nucleotides, at positions 1–4 within the 39-nt SL RNA (3Bangs J.D. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. McCloskey J.A. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9805-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SL RNA is transcribed from a highly reiterated set of genes. In contrast to the long primary transcripts that form the bulk of the mature mRNA, each SL RNA has a discrete transcriptional start site. α-Amanitin studies show that it is very probable, though not proven, that the SL RNA gene is transcribed by RNA polymerase (pol) II. The primary SL RNA transcript and the transcript present in the trans-splicing spliceosome possess identical 5′- and 3′-ends, indicating that both transcription initiation and termination regulate the accumulation of SL RNA. SL RNA expression has been monitored using independent, tagged gene copies positioned on selectable shuttle vectors that are stably maintained in various trypanosomatids (4Günzl A. Tschudi C. Nakaar V. Ullu E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17287-17291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 5Yu M.C. Sturm N. Saito R. Roberts T. Campbell D. Mol. Biochem.

In the simple trypanosomatid Leptomonas seymouri, a 95-bp region upstream of the SL RNA intragenic region followed by 70 bp of downstream sequence is sufficient to produce properly initiated and terminated SL RNA (7Hartree D. Bellofatto V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results have been recapitulated in vitro using homologous parasite nuclear extracts (8Huie J. He P. Bellofatto V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Unusual promoter architecture in this group of primitive eukaryotes, compared with typical metazoans, appears to be the rule. The U6 small nuclear (sn) RNA gene promoter contains three elements: one located within the 5′-portion of the intragenic region and two located within an upstream, but inversely oriented, tRNA gene. The two intragenic tRNA promoter elements, called A and B boxes, cofunction in both U6 and tRNA expression (9Nakaar V. Dare A.O. Hong D. Ullu E. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6736-6742Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Two abundant cell surface proteins in the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei are encoded by genes with promoter elements that resemble RNA pol I promoters in both structure and α-amanitin resistance. Aside from these two protein coding genes in T. brucei, all other trypanosomatid mRNAs are α-amanitin-sensitive and thus transcribed by RNA pol II (for review, see Refs. 10Graham S.V. Parasitol. Today. 1995; 11: 217-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and 11Cross G. Wirtz L. Navarro M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Transcriptional start sites for primary mRNAs have been extremely difficult to detect. Two putative promoter regions were tentatively defined as transcriptionally void regions upstream from the highly transcribed actin and HSP 70 genes (12Ben Amar M. Jefferies D. Pays A. Bakalara N. Kendall G. Pays E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5857-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Lee M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1220-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, placement of these sequences upstream from a luciferase coding region did not yield even modest levels of reporter gene activity (14McAndrew M. Graham S. Hartmann C. Clayton C. Exp. Parasitol. 1998; 90: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the absence of any putative trypanosome promoter regions, Escherichia coli pBR 322-derived sequences drive expression of reporter genes, such as the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Models to explain these findings suggest that RNA pol II may not be recruited to specific promoter sites to initiate mRNA synthesis. Addition of an SL to these jagged mRNA 5′-ends would polish them as mRNAs mature into translatable units. We present a detailed transcriptional analysis of the SL RNA gene promoter using an in vitro transcription system that faithfully recapitulates in vivo transcription. In a dearth of any previously defined trypanosome transcription factors, PBP-1 and PBP-2 (15Luo H. Bellofatto V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33344-33352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins initially identified in our laboratory, emerge as the first proteins that function to promote efficient SL RNA transcription. These studies also reveal that correct 5′-end formation of the SL RNA, which is crucial to proper capping of the SL, is dependent on the presence of a 5-bp element, the trypanosome initiator (Inrt). Finally, we provide evidence for a trans-acting factor necessary for transcription which binds the Inrt. L. seymouri (ATCC 30220) was grown inTrypanosoma mega medium (16Bellofatto V. Cross G.A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3455-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) at 28 °C to log phase. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,900 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) and washed twice with buffer 1 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2) (7Hartree D. Bellofatto V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All of the following steps were performed at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 packed cell volume of buffer 2 (10 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 150 mm sucrose, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm leupeptin) containing 20 mm potassium glutamate. After swelling cells on ice (10 min), they were Dounce homogenized (size A pestle) until disrupted. After centrifugation, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 5 packed cell volumes of buffer 2 at 20 mm potassium glutamate, and 1 packed cell volume of (NH4)2SO4(4.1 m) was add dropwise. The extract was cleared by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 35 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was fractionated using solid (NH4)2SO4 (0.33 g/ml of solution). 1 n NaOH (0.1 ml/10 g solid (NH4)2SO4) was added to maintain the pH. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation (15,000 ×g, 20 min, 4 °C) and resuspended with 0.10 volume of the high speed supernatant with buffer 2 at 20 mm potassium glutamate and dialyzed against this buffer. The dialysate was cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and aliquots were stored at −70 °C. The nuclear extract protein concentration was 5–10 mg/ml. The P400 fraction was prepared by dialyzing the nuclear extract (∼100 mg of protein) against buffer 2 at 50 mm potassium glutamate and loading onto a 5-ml phosphocellulose (P-11, Whatman) column as described (15Luo H. Bellofatto V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33344-33352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted using a step gradient (200, 400, 600 mm potassium glutamate) in buffer 2. The P400 fraction alone was competent for transcription. It was concentrated using the same (NH4)2SO4 precipitate method described above for the nuclear extract preparation. The final protein concentration of P400 was ∼5 mg/ml. The specific DNA affinity-purified PBP-1 and PBP-2 proteins were prepared as described previously (15Luo H. Bellofatto V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33344-33352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and dialyzed against buffer 2 at 20 mm potassium glutamate (the final protein concentration was ∼1.6 mg/ml) before addition to the transcription reaction. For the sequestration experiments, the acetylated bovine serum albumin was from New England BioLabs, Inc. In all SL RNA gene-containing templates, a tag was present in the coding region between +48 and +69 nt. The sequence of the 10-nt substitutions between −1 to −90 nt of the upstream region of the SL RNA gene has been published (7Hartree D. Bellofatto V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In each case, the substitutions were nucleotide transversions. The linear DNA templates (wild type (wt)) and 10-nt substitution derivatives) were synthesized from their corresponding plasmids using PCR and primers VB 71 (corresponds to the −73/91 nt upstream region of the promoter) and VB 72 (complements the +197/215 nt downstream region of the SL RNA gene). All other mutated linear templates were synthesized by recombinant PCR. Every DNA was sequenced to confirm base alterations. Mutated sequences are shown in Figs. 1 and 5.Figure 5Positioning of the start site is determined by the Inrt element. PBP-2E is boxed. Arrows indicate the position and relative strength of the start sites that were identified in the transcription assays. The 5 nt that precede each start site are underlined. Abroader arrow signifies a stronger start site. The lowercase letters indicate nt mutations.

PBP-1E/2E was a 66-nt (−17/82 nt) DNA; PBP-1E was a 42-nt (−41/83 nt) DNA, and PBP-2E was a 34-nt (−17/50 nt) DNA. Inrt was a 66-nt DNA (5′-TCTAGAACTAGTGGATCCGGGCACCTCGAGACCCTACCATCAAGCTTATCGATACCGTCGACCTCG-3′) which included the −1/20 nt promoter region of SL RNA gene surrounded by part of pBluescript SK II (pBS) polylinker region sequence (Stratagene). The first three DNAs were made by annealing complementary oligonucleotides. The Inrt substrate was amplified by PCR using the top strand as template and SK and KS primers from pBS. The U6 snRNA gene was tagged by insertion of a 21-nt sequence between nt +71/72 by using the wt U6 snRNA gene (a gift from Albrecht Bindereif) and the primers VB 195 (−150/169 nt; 5′-CACTCCTACCTGGACTCGAA-3′) and VB 247 (+58/71 nt; the tag sequence is underlined; 5′-GCTTCAGGGATCCAAGTAAGCGCCTTGCGCAGGGAG-3′) to amplify the −169 to +71 nt region and the primers VB 248 (+72/86 nt; the tag sequence is underlined; 5′-GCTTCATTGGATCCCTGAAGCTGATGTCAATCTTCG-3′) and VB 249 (+86/106 nt; 5′-CGGCGAAAAGCTATATCTCTC-3′) to amplify the +72 to +106 nt sequence of the U6 snRNA gene. The recombinant product was obtained by denaturing and annealing the two PCR products and amplifying the 296-nt product with the VB 195 and VB 249 primers. This 296-nt tagged U6 snRNA gene was cloned into theEcoRV-digested pBS and referred to as pHL-U6. The standard reactions were conducted in 50-μl volume in a buffer containing 10–20 μl of nuclear extract (protein concentration was 5–10 mg/ml), 1 pmol of circular plasmid DNA or 2 pmol of linear DNA, 20 mm potassium glutamate, 3 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3% polyethylene glycol 8000, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 0.48 mg/ml creatine kinase, 1 mm leupeptin, 40 units of porcine RNase inhibitor, 2 mm ATP, 0.8 mm CTP, 0.8 mm GTP, and 0.8 mm UTP. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 28 °C and terminated by adding 400 μl of stop buffer (5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.3m sodium acetate, and 5 μg of tRNA). Protein was extracted with 400 μl of RNase-free phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The RNA was precipitated with ethanol. The pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of primer extension buffer (Promega). To sequester PBP-1 and PBP-2 proteins, a 5-fold molar excess of 66 bp of PBP-1E/2E DNA, relative to the template DNA, was added to the P400 fraction. Primer extension reactions were performed using reagents and protocols obtained from Promega. RNA and 70 fmol of 32P-labeled primer VB 207 (5′-GCTTCAGG GATCCAAGTAAGC-3′) were mixed and heated (5 min, 75 °C) and cooled slowly to 40 °C; 1 unit of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase was added, and the annealed primer was extended at 40 °C for 30 min. The products were denatured in 90% formamide (90 °C, 10 min) and applied to a 10% polyacrylamide denaturing (7 m urea) gel. To ensure that quantitation of primer extension products reflected true differences in transcription efficiencies and not experimental variation, an internal control was added to each reaction. Specifically, the tagged U6 snRNA gene described above was included in each SL RNA transcription reaction. Because this gene contained the same tag as the SL RNA gene templates, the U6 snRNA and SL RNA transcripts were specifically hybridized and reverse transcribed using the same primer. The tag was inserted in the U6 snRNA gene in a position such that the primer extension product from the U6 snRNA gene was 22 nt longer than that from the SL RNA gene. Each product was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis of dried gels. The ratio of the primer extension products from the U6 snRNA and wt SL RNA product was set as 1. The amount of primer extension product from each variant SL RNA gene template was compared with the U6-derived product within each reaction and expressed as a number relative to wt SL RNA transcription. The Ambion RPAII kit was used for the RNase protection assay (Ambion). To obtain a DNA template for the production of the specific riboprobe, a PCR was performed using the plasmid pDEH3, which contains the SL RNA gene, and two SL RNA-specific primers. The sense primer, VB 331, starts at nt +38 of the SL RNA gene; the antisense primer, VB 330, starts at nt +196 and has the T7 promoter at its 5′-end to allow for labeling by in vitrotranscription with T7 polymerase. T7 RNA polymerase-dependent transcription produced a [α32P]UTP-labeled 176-nt riboprobe that could protect 81 nt of the in vitro transcribed tagged SL RNA and 51 nt of the endogenous SL RNA. Trypanosome in vitro transcriptions were performed as described (8Huie J. He P. Bellofatto V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and RNA was precipitated and resuspended in 20 μl of solution A (from the Ambion RPAII kit) with 5 × 104 cpm of riboprobe. The RNAs were hybridized overnight at 42 °C, single-stranded regions were digested using RNase T1 and A, and the resultant RNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in formamide loading buffer. Samples were electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide-urea gel in 1 × TBE, and results were visualized using PhosphorImager analysis. Our investigation of a tractable gene promoter in these ancient eukaryotic protists have established that the SL RNA gene promoter lies within the proximal ∼100 nt upstream of the transcription start site (see Fig. 1) (6Agami R. Aly R. Halman S. Shapira M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,7Hartree D. Bellofatto V. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 1995; 71: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Günzl A. Ullu E. Dörner M. Fragoso S. Hoffmann K. Milner J. Morita Y. Nguu E. Vanacova S. Wünsch S. Dare A. Kwon H. Tschudi C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the limiting component of in vivo analyses is that promoter mutations that produced inaccurately initiated SL RNA, which would turn over rapidly, could not be distinguished from mutations that down-regulated transcription. To investigate the role each promoter element contributes to the transcriptional process, homologous nuclear extracts were produced which could initiate transcription accurately on DNA templates containing the upstream proximal 100 nt adjacent to a guanosine-less coding sequence (G-less cassette) (8Huie J. He P. Bellofatto V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The L. seymouri in vitro transcription extracts contain few RNA-processing enzymes and thus directly assay transcription independently of other nuclear activities. In a recent modification of these assays, shown here, the exogenous SL RNA gene template possesses a 19-nt tag that is transcribed as part of the SL RNA (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 8Huie J. He P. Bellofatto V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). RNAs are detected by primer extension reactions using the complement of the tag sequence as the radiolabeled primer. Fig. 2 A, lane 1, demonstrates that the SL RNA gene was transcribedin vitro to produce an accurately initiated SL RNA. Detailed transcriptional analysis of mutated templates, drawn schematically below the data, revealed that the two upstream elements (PBP-1E and PBP-2E) of the core SL RNA gene promoter were necessary for efficient transcription. However, these mutations did not effect RNA start site selection (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4, 5,7, and 8). This was surprising because an analogy between snRNA gene promoters in higher eukaryotes and the SL RNA gene promoter would have predicted that PBP-1 and or PBP-2 would be directly responsible for determining transcriptional start sites (19Lobo S.M. Hernandez N.T. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, New York1994: 127-159Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, a 10-nt mutation of the third core element, which resides at −1/10 nt, completely abolished proper transcription initiation (lane 2). The in vivo phenotype had been a loss of detectable SL RNA. Clearly, the effect of improperly initiated SL RNAs resulted in their rapid turnover to produce a null phenotype for the −1/10 mutant in vivo. Because the sub −1/10 mutation produced transcripts that initiated at multiple sites, we deemed it interesting to assess if correct 3′-end formation had been affected similarly. An RNase protection assay was performed on in vitro transcripts using an antisense riboprobe that would recognize SL RNA sequences from nt +38 to nt +196 (Fig. 2 B, schematic). The 3′-end of in vivo synthesized RNAs maps immediately upstream of the T stretch beginning at nt +99. Accordingly, the endogenous SL RNAs present within the nuclear extract protected a fragment of 51 nt (Fig. 2 B). Correctly terminated and/or 3′-end processing in vitrotranscribed SL RNAs would protect a larger, 81-nt fragment because of the presence of the internal 19 nt tag. The 81-nt RNA shown in Fig.2 B demonstrated that the 3′-end of the SL RNA, transcribed from a wt SL RNA gene template, was properly generated in vitro. Interestingly, the 3′-end of the SL RNA transcribed from the sub −1/10 DNA template was also correctly formed. Previousin vivo analysis of SL RNAs by Northern blot analysis is consistent with this finding (7Hartree D. Bellofatto V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The significant reduction of the 81-nt product in the right lane (sub −1/10) compared with the left lane (wt) was consistent with the overall reduction in transcription levels from the mutant template. The 51-nt internal control band (which represents the endogenous RNA) demonstrated that equal amounts of total RNA were included in each RNase protection assay. These results demonstrate the requirement for the −1/10 nt region exclusively in transcription start site selection and not in transcription termination of the SL RNA gene. In the absence of a TATA box to direct start site selection in any of the known, albeit few, characterized trypanosome gene promoters, we tested whether that downstream-most element within the tripartite promoter of the SL RNA gene contributed directly to accurate RNA initiation (20Zawel L. Reinberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 533-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). A growing collection of higher eukaryotic and yeast genes relies on an Inr element, often without a nearby TATA sequence, for directing proper initiation (21Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 22Smale S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 23Mosch H. Graf R.

As a result of the data shown in Fig. 2 A, lane 2, the downstream-most element maintains functional homology to the metazoan Inr and is now referred to as a t rypanosome Inr, or Inrt. However, a sequence comparison between the metazoan Inr and Inrt shows a distinct difference. In metazoans, a loose consensus exists of YYA(+1)NT/AYY in which it is crucial for the +3 position to be an A or T for optimal Inr activity (26Lo K. Smale S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 182: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A data base survey of the sequence that flanks SL RNA transcription start sites in related Trypanosomatidae reveals a consensus YYHBYA(+1)ACT in which the C (+3) is invariant. Hence, the A/T (+3) found in metazoans is absent in trypanosomatids. Because of this distinguishing difference between trypanosome and metazoan Inr, it is appropriate to refer the trypanosome Inr as Inrt. To delineate the boundaries of the Inrt element, mutations were introduced in and around the −1/10 nt region (5′-AGACCCTACCA(+1)ACT-3′) of the SL RNA promoter. Initially, each half of the 10 nt region was mutated separately, and mutant templates were used to program nuclear extracts. Fig. 3, lanes 2–4, illustrates the transcription results. Mutation of the −6/10 nt region caused 36% of the transcripts to initiate at the −3 position (lane 4). A comparison of the sequence with the consensus YTHBYA(+1)ACT Inrt showed that a new Inrt had been generated by the substitution of the -6/10 nt region (see Fig. 5). Specifically, the wt sequence from −1/10, which is AGACCCTACCA(+1), had been replaced with TACGTCTACCA(+1). In the mutant construct, a CGTCTA(+1) was recognized at high efficiency to initiate SL RNA transcription. Substitution of the −1/5 nt region (lanes 2 and 3) completely abolished synthesis of properly initiated SL RNAs. Clearly, replacement of the CTACCA(+1) sequence with GATGGA(+1) abolished Inrt function. In the absence of a wt Inrt in the −1/5 mutation, cryptic sites, partially generated by the replacement nucleotides, were recognized by the transcription machinery (see Fig. 5). Consequently, RNAs initiated at several sites, albeit with decreased efficiency. These initiation sites were as follows: CTAACG(+1), located at +8 (relative to the wt (+1) start site); ATGGAA(+1), located at +2; CCGATG(+1), located at −2; AGACCG(+1), located at −5. In the case of the start site utilized with the highest efficiency (the −5 site; 50% of total RNAs produced) the initiating purine (G, in this case), was preceded by an ACC trinucleotide that is identical to that within the wt Inrt. The consistently best utilized start site in the sub −1/10 mutation (the +8 site, 45% of total RNA produced; fastest migrating band inlane 2) also functioned with modest efficiency in the −1/5 mutation (20% of total RNA synthesized; lanes 2 and3). This start site is preceded by a CTAACG(+1) sequence that is identical to the wt CTACCA(+1) region except that the −2 position is an A in place of a C, and the purine that is used as the initiation nucleotide is G in place of A. Thus, conservation of at least three nt within the five nt upstream of the start site is clearly important for Inrt activity. In del-Inrt 2, the nucleotides at positions −6 and −7 nt were altered from CC to GA. This alteration had no effect on start site selection (lane 5), nor did this dinucleotide substitution generate a new Inrt sequence. Taken together, these data show that the Inrt is restricted to the five nt adjacent to the initiating purine. Transcriptional analysis of SL RNA genes in three related trypanosomatids have shown that alterations within the SL RNA sequence had minor effects on both transcription efficiency and start site selection, although these effects were not studied in detail (5Yu M.C. Sturm N. Saito R. Roberts T. Campbell D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 265-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Günzl A. Ullu E. Dörner M. Fragoso S. Hoffmann K. Milner J.

Res. 1999; 85: 700-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As an important component of our Inrt studies, we determined directly if the SL RNA sequence must follow the Inrt immediately. Moreover, by the insertion of four nt, we altered the helical face of the SL RNA sequence relative to the upstream promoter. Any protein-DNA recognition that straddled the upstream and intragenic regions would be disrupted in this mutated template. The insertion mutation, add-C4, did not alter start site"

The results from our functional studies in which we utilized neutralizing antisera against CCR2 are consistent with a multidomain binding model, previously proposed by others. The first extracellular loop was of particular interest, because in addition to a ligand-binding domain it contained also information for receptor activation, crucial for transmembrane signaling. Replacement of the first extracellular loop of CCR2 with the corresponding region of CCR1 decreased the MCP-1 binding affinity about 10-fold and prevented transmembrane signaling. A more detailed analysis by site-directed mutagenesis revealed that this receptor segment contains two distinct microdomains. The amino acid residues Asn104 and Glu105 are essential for high affinity agonist binding but are not involved in receptor activation. In contrast, the charged amino acid residue His100 does not contribute to ligand binding but is vital for receptor activation and initiation of transmembrane signaling.

Chemokines are a rapidly growing family of small proteins that share a high homology in their primary structure and are characterized by their ability to recruit and activate various types of leukocytes (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). Based on the position of the first two cysteine residues, they are subdivided into several subfamilies. In the α- or CXC subfamily, the first two cysteines are separated by an amino acid residue that is missing in the β- or CC subfamily. Lymphotactin lacks some of the cysteine residues and may be the first identified member of a new chemokine subfamily (2Kelner G.S. Kennedy J. Bacon K.B. Kleyensteuber S. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A.

A fourth human chemokine type, called fractalkine, was recently identified (3Bazan J.F. Bacon K.B. Hardiman G. Wang W. Soo K. Rossi D. Greaves D.R. Zlotnik A. Schall T.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). Unlike other chemokines, fractalkine consists of a chemokine domain attached to a mucin-like extension that can function as a membrane anchor.

Like all other known leukocyte chemoattractant receptors, CCR2 belongs to the family of seven transmembrane-spanning receptors that are coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins (11Myers S.J. Wong L.M.

The non-redundant role of the receptor in the host defense mechanism has recently been demonstrated in a CCR2-deficient mouse model. A targeted disruption of the CCR2 gene resulted in a drastic reduction in MCP-1-induced monocyte chemotaxis, and the mice were unable to resolve bacterial infections (13Kuziel W.A. Morgan S.J.

Med. 1997; 186: 1757-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Although the magnitude of an inflammatory response is generally proportional to the concentration of MCP-1, monocyte recruitment is at least in part controlled by the level of CCR2 expression. Recent studies in our laboratory demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines including MCP-1 itself rapidly down-regulated the expression of CCR2, which may aid the retention of monocytes at sites of inflammation after their recruitment from the circulation (16Tangirala R.K. Murao K. Quehenberger O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8050-8056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These cytokines also induced the secretion of MCP-1 by monocytes and initiated the switch from the MCP-1-responsive state to the MCP-1-unresponsive state, which coincided with the loss of CCR2. In contrast, plasma levels of low density lipoproteins that are characteristic for hypercholesterolemia increased monocyte CCR2 expression. As a consequence the chemotactic activity of monocytes was enhanced, which may result in their excessive recruitment to the vessel wall in chronic inflammation and atherogenesis (17Han K.H.

However, the binding of peptide agonists to chemoattractant receptors is very complex. More detailed analyses of the ligand-binding domains of CXCR1, CXCR2 (22Hebert C.A. Chuntharapai A. Smith M.

Similarly, the interaction of MCP-1 with multiple domains of CCR2 may be necessary for intact transmembrane signaling. In this report we describe the functional characterization of the first extracellular loop of CCR2. Our results suggest a dual role for this receptor segment. It contains a site that supports high affinity binding of MCP-1. In addition to this ligand-binding domain, we have identified a primary structure that appears essential for ligand-induced activation of G proteins without affecting the binding affinity. This study provides the first evidence that an extracellular domain of CCR2 distinct from the ligand-binding site is required for functional transmembrane signaling. HEK 293 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). LipofectAMINE, G418 sulfate, and all tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction enzymes and other reagents for the manipulation of DNA were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Life Technologies, Inc., and Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Recombinant MCP-1 was purchased from R & D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN), 125I-MCP-1 (specific activity, 2200 Ci/mmol) and [35S]GTPγS (1300 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. All other reagents were of highest purity available. The cDNAs for CCR2B and CCR1 were obtained from the human THP-1 cell line. Total RNA was isolated, reverse-transcribed, and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Their nucleotide sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing and matched the published results (9Charo I.F. Myers S.J. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2752-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 26Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). For the creation of the chimeric receptor with the first extracellular loop exchanged, the CCR2B cDNA was digested with BalI andClaI which deleted a fragment between nucleotides 254 and 407 of the open reading frame. This fragment corresponds to the first extracellular loop including portions of the adjacent transmembrane domains of the translated protein. A similar fragment was obtained from CCR1 by PCR. No restriction site for ClaI is present in CCR1, and the primers contained a BalI and a ClaI site to yield a PCR product with these restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ end, respectively. The fragment was inserted into the digested CCR2B cDNA, subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the construct was analyzed by DNA sequencing. The resulting chimeric receptor CH1 was composed primarily of CCR2B with the first extracellular loop exchanged. The chimeric receptor also contained some sequence changes in the adjacent transmembrane domains. They were introduced together with the loop, but they were minor because of the high sequence homology G protein-coupled receptors display particularly within these domains and, most likely, did not contribute to any changes in receptor function. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis according to the method of Kunkel (27Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar) was used for the exchange of selected amino acid residues as described previously (25Quehenberger O. Pan Z.K. Prossnitz E.R. Cavanagh S.L. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CCR2B cDNA in the uracil-containing bacteriophage vector M13mp19 (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) was used as a single-stranded template. The selection of the mutants was carried out using the dut−ung− Escherichia coli strain CJ236. The nucleotide sequence of all mutants was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. HEK 293 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium with Earle's balanced salt solution containing 10% horse serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. The coding sequence of the wild type and mutant CCR2B including the optimal sequence for initiation of translation (28Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1. Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol and placed under antibiotic selection with 800 μg/ml G418 sulfate. Cells expressing high levels of CCR2B were identified by reverse transcriptase-coupled PCR, and the surface expression was determined by flow cytometry or by125I-MCP-1 binding analysis. Cells were detached from the culture flask with protease-free dissociation buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), collected by centrifugation, and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were suspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm MgSO4 and a mixture of protease inhibitors (50 units/ml aprotinin, 5 mm benzamidine, 14.5 μm pepstatin, 0.1 mm leupeptin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride), placed on ice, and homogenized. Unbroken cells and cell nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and crude membranes were then isolated by centrifugation at 48,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The membranes were either used immediately or stored at −80 °C. Two antisera directed against the first (AbTM23) and second (AbTM45) extracellular loops and one against the intracellular carboxyl-terminal tail (AbTM7C) of CCR2B were generated. The cDNAs encoding the regions between the amino acid residues Ile93 to His124, Pro174 to Met205, and Gly309 to Leu360, representing the first, second extracellular loops, and the carboxyl-terminal tail, respectively, were amplified by PCR. The amplified fragments were subcloned in frame into the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), sequenced, and expressed as fusion proteins in E. coli. The fusion proteins were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), antisera generated in guinea pigs, and IgG fractions were then isolated. For flow cytometry, 1 × 106 cells were suspended in 100 μl of PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.01% NaN3 (buffer A) and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with 5 μg of primary IgG. After two washes with buffer A the cells were incubated for another 20 min with fluorescein-labeled secondary antibody at a 1:200 dilution, washed twice with buffer A, and analyzed on a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Cells were grown to confluence in a T75 flask, washed once with PBS, and labeled with 5 μm Indo-1 AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in RPMI 1640 without phenol red, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, harvested with protease-free dissociation buffer, and suspended at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 1.25 mm calcium and 0.1% BSA. Changes in the concentration of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) in response to various concentrations of MCP-1 were monitored as described (24Quehenberger O. Prossnitz E.R. Cavanagh S.L. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18167-18175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence was continuously measured simultaneously at 400 and 490 nm on an LS50B luminescence spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer) with the excitation set at 340 nm. The change in [Ca2+]i was expressed as change of the fluorescence ratioF400 nm/F490 nm. Binding assays were performed essentially as described previously (16Tangirala R.K. Murao K. Quehenberger O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8050-8056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with PBS and 0.3 × 106 cells were suspended in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 0.5% BSA. The cell suspension was incubated with 0.02 nm125I-MCP-1 and varying concentrations of unlabeled ligand for 60 min at room temperature. At the end of the incubation the cells were separated from the buffer by centrifugation through 300 μl of an equal mixture of dibutyl phthalate and dioctyl phthalate (Aldrich), and the radioactivity associated with the cell pellet was measured. In the competition assays, the cells were preincubated with IgG fractions of the various antisera (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 30 min prior to the addition of radioactive ligand. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 30 nm unlabeled MCP-1, and the specific binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. All assays were done in triplicate, and the binding data and binding isotherms were determined using the LIGAND program (29Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar). Cell membranes were prepared from transfected cells and resuspended at a protein concentration of 20 μg/ml in 200 μl of reaction buffer consisting of 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 3 μm GDP, 10 mmMgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl. The membranes were prewarmed to 37 °C; [35S]GTPγS was added at various concentrations; and the reaction was started with 30 nmMCP-1. After 30 min at 37 °C, the reactions were cooled to 4 °C; 10 μm unlabeled GTPγS (Sigma) was added; and the tubes were kept on ice for 60 min to reduce the nonspecific binding (30Lazareno S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 83: 107-116PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation period, the membranes were filtered through GF/B filters (Whatman) and washed several times with ice-cold reaction buffer. The radioactivity associated with the filters was determined by scintillation counting. To control for CCR2B-specific GTPγS binding, MCP-1 was omitted, and the values were subtracted from the total binding seen in the presence of MCP-1. In separate experiments, the IgG fraction of the neutralizing antiserum AbTM7C, which is directed against the carboxyl-tail of CCR2B, was included to determine CCR2B-specific activation of G protein. Inclusion of AbTM7C IgG in the binding experiment inhibited receptor-mediated activation of G protein. All assays were done in triplicate, and the binding data were analyzed with the LIGAND program (29Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar). THP-1 monocytes were suspended at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in chemotaxis buffer which consisted of Tyrode's salt buffer (Sigma), 1% NaHCO3, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4. The cell suspension (51 μl) was loaded into the upper chamber of the 48-well microchemotaxis Boyden chamber (Neuroprobe, Gaithersburg, MD), and 10 nm MCP-1 in chemotaxis buffer was added to the lower chamber. Both chambers are separated by a 5-μm pore-size polycarbonate membrane (Poretics Corp., Livermore, CA). After 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere, the side of the membrane that was in contact with the cell suspension was washed to remove any cells. The migrated cells adhering to the underside of the membrane were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde, stained with crystal violet, and counted in four × 400 high power fields of three replica filters. To determine the inhibitory effects of the antisera AbTM23 and AbTM45 on chemotaxis, THP-1 monocytes were first incubated with the IgG fractions of the individual antisera or with a combination of both (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C before their placement into the Boyden chamber. Nonspecific migration was determined by including 1 μg/ml neutralizing mouse anti-human MCP-1 monoclonal antibody (R & D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN). All data were expressed as chemotaxis index defined as the number of cells that migrated in response to MCP-1 divided by the number of cells that migrated in the presence of neutralizing anti-MCP-1 antibody. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (31Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. A hypothetical model for binding of MCP-1 by CCR2 that involves the amino-terminal tail was proposed recently (32Monteclaro F.S. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19084-19092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To identify other extracellular domains that are fundamental for receptor function, we generated antisera against the first (AbTM23) and second (AbTM45) extracellular loops of CCR2. The specificity of the antisera was tested by flow cytometry, and both AbTM23 and AbTM45 IgG recognized CCR2B stably expressed in HEK 293 cells but did not react with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1). Next we tested if the antisera can interfere with ligand binding indicating that these receptor domains are involved in the recognition of MCP-1. The transfected HEK 293 cells expressed on average 6.3 ± 0.6 fmol of CCR2B/106 cells, which was determined by125I-MCP-1 binding analysis. Incubation of the cells with preimmune IgG affected MCP-1 binding only insignificantly. In contrast, AbTM23 or AbTM45 IgG inhibited ligand binding substantially by about 60% when used individually, and by about 80% when used in combination (Fig. 2).Figure 2Inhibition of MCP-1 binding to CCR2B by the antisera AbTM23 and AbTM45. Transfected HEK 293 cells expressing CCR2B were incubated with 125I-MCP-1 and various concentrations of unlabeled ligand for 60 min at room temperature. Ligand binding analysis was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the absence of antibody (▪) or in the presence of preimmune IgG (■), AbTM23 IgG (●), AbTM45 IgG (♦), and a combination of both (▴). The cells were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C with the IgG fractions at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, after which radiolabeled ligand was added. Shown in theinset is the specific inhibition, which was determined after subtraction of nonspecific binding assessed in the presence of 30 nm unlabeled ligand from the total binding. In the absence of antibody, the transfected HEK 293 cells bound on average 6.3 ± 0.6 fmol MCP-1/106 cells which was taken as 100%. No, MCP-1 binding in the absence of antibody;pre, 23, 45, and 23 + 45, MCP-1 binding in the presence of preimmune IgG, AbTM23 IgG, AbTM45 IgG and AbTM23+AbTM45 IgG, respectively. Data represent mean ± S.D. of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results from the binding studies indicated that the first and second extracellular loops might be important for MCP-1 binding and receptor function. Therefore the effect of the antisera on MCP-1-induced chemotaxis of THP-1 monocytes was examined. As shown in Fig. 3, AbTM23 or AbTM45 IgG reduced the chemotactic response by about 50–70% compared with preimmune IgG or no antibody control. The combination of AbTM23 and AbTM45 IgG appeared to reduce chemotaxis even further, but the difference was statistically not significant and reflected the incomplete inhibition of MCP-1 binding by the antisera. To establish more directly that the first extracellular loop is involved in ligand binding and receptor function, we constructed a chimeric CCR2B. The first extracellular loop and the adjacent transmembrane domains between the restriction sitesBalI and ClaI were exchanged with the corresponding region taken from CCR1 (Fig.4 A). Although the amino acid sequence of the first extracellular loop of these two receptors is 50% identical, CCR1 does not bind MCP-1. The chimeric receptor CH1 was stably expressed in HEK 293 cells, and ligand binding analysis was performed. Replacement of the first extracellular loop had a profound effect on the binding affinity (Fig. 4 B) and increased the dissociation constant by about 10-fold compared with that of wild type CCR2B (Table I).Table IBinding and signaling parameters of wild type and mutant receptorsReceptorSequence of 1st loopKdBmaxEC50nmfmol/106cellsnmCCR2B-99AHSAANEWVFGNAMCK114-0.44 ± 0.066.3 ± 0.624.7 ± 4.1CH1-99IDYKLKDDWVFGDAMCK115-4.70 ± 0.806.2 ± 0.5>100MU1-99IDYSAANEWVFGNAMCK115-0.20 ± 0.033.5 ± 0.4>100MU2-99AHKLKNEWVFGNAMCK114-0.24 ± 0.093.9 ± 0.2>100MU3-99AHSAADDWVFGNAMCK114-4.66 ± 0.904.0 ± 0.7>100The amino acid sequences of the first extracellular loops of the wild type and mutant CCR2B are shown.

The EC50 values represent the MCP-1 concentrations that induce half-maximal change of [Ca2+]i in the transfected cells. The values represent the mean ± S.D. of three experiments. Open table in a new tab The amino acid sequences of the first extracellular loops of the wild type and mutant CCR2B are shown. Binding assays were carried out as described under “Materials and Methods” and the dissociation constants (Kd) and maximal binding (Bmax) were calculated using the LIGAND program. The EC50 values represent the MCP-1 concentrations that induce half-maximal change of [Ca2+]i in the transfected cells. The values represent the mean ± S.D. of three experiments. To identify the individual amino acid residues that are necessary for receptor function, we compared the sequences of the wild type CCR2B and the chimeric receptor. We found several non-conservative differences in the amino acid sequence of the first extracellular loop that may be responsible for the diminished function associated with the chimeric receptor. They were located predominantly in the amino-terminal half of the loop proximal to the second transmembrane domain (Table I). This information was the basis for the selection of target amino acid residues, and their relative importance for receptor function was determined by site-directed mutagenesis and functional characterization of the mutant receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells. Three mutant receptors were generated in which amino acid residues of the wild type receptor were replaced by those of the chimeric receptor in clusters of two to three residues at a time. Substitution of the residues Ala99–His100 with Ile-Asp-Tyr in MU1 or Ser101–Ala102–Ala103 with Lys-Leu-Lys in MU2 had no effect on the binding affinity, and the resulting dissociation constants were similar to that of the wild type receptor (Fig. 5). In contrast, changing the residues Asn104–Glu105 to Asp-Asp, as in MU3, increased the dissociation constant significantly by about 10-fold (Table I). Next we examined the ability of the mutant receptors to stimulate agonist-induced transmembrane signaling. MCP-1 induced a dose-dependent mobilization of intracellular calcium in transfected HEK 293 cells expressing the wild type CCR2B. In contrast, the chimeric receptor CH1 did not respond to MCP-1, and little change in [Ca2+]i was observed, even at MCP-1 concentrations well in excess of that of the dissociation constant (Fig. 6). Although the mutations in MU1 and MU2 did not affect the ligand"
https://openalex.org/W2077035056,"Recent mutagenesis and cross-linking studies suggest that three regions of the PTH-1 receptor play important roles in ligand interaction: (i) the extreme NH2-terminal region, (ii) the juxtamembrane base of the amino-terminal extracellular domain, and (iii) the third extracellular loop. In this report, we analyzed the second of these segments in the rat PTH-1 receptor (residues 182–190) and its role in functional interaction with short PTH fragment analogs. Twenty-eight singly substituted PTH-1 receptors were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells and shown to be fully expressed by surface antibody binding analysis. Alanine-scanning analysis identified Phe184, Arg186, Leu187, and Ile190 as important determinants of maximum binding of 125I-labeled bovine PTH-(1–34) and125I-labeled bovine PTH-(3–34) and determinants of responsiveness to the NH2-terminal analog, PTH-(1–14) in cAMP stimulation assays. Alanine mutations at these four sites augmented the ability of the COOH-terminal peptide [Glu22,Trp23]PTHrP-(15–36) to inhibit the cAMP response induced by PTH-(1–34). At Phe184 and Leu187, hydrophobic substitutions (e.g. Ile, Met, or Leu) preserved PTH-(1–34)-mediated cAMP signaling potency, whereas hydrophilic substitutions (e.g. Asp, Glu, Lys, or Arg) weakened this response by 20-fold or more, as compared with the unsubstituted receptor's response. The results suggest that hydrophobicity at positions occupied by Phe184 and Leu187 in the PTH-1 receptor plays an important role in determining functional interaction with the 3–14 portion of PTH. Recent mutagenesis and cross-linking studies suggest that three regions of the PTH-1 receptor play important roles in ligand interaction: (i) the extreme NH2-terminal region, (ii) the juxtamembrane base of the amino-terminal extracellular domain, and (iii) the third extracellular loop. In this report, we analyzed the second of these segments in the rat PTH-1 receptor (residues 182–190) and its role in functional interaction with short PTH fragment analogs. Twenty-eight singly substituted PTH-1 receptors were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells and shown to be fully expressed by surface antibody binding analysis.

Abou-Samra A Bringhurst F. Gardella T. Jüppner H. Segre G. Thakker R. Genetics of Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders. Chapman & Hall, London1997: 389-420Google Scholar). Most of the class II G protein-coupled receptors bind peptide hormones that are similar in size to the PTH-1 receptor agonists PTH-(1–34) and PTHrP-(1–36). Peptide ligands in this class include calcitonin-(1–32), secretin-(1–27), and glucagon-(1–29). The amino-terminal extracellular domains of the class II receptors are typically ∼150 amino acids in length and contain several conserved amino acid sequence elements, including six cysteine residues. With all members of the class II G protein-coupled receptor family, mutagenesis studies have indicated that the NH2-terminal extracellular domain plays a dominant role in determining ligand binding affinity (5Lee C.

Several groups are utilizing a variety of approaches to identify specific points of contact between PTH-(1–34) and the PTH-1 receptor. Both mutational and photochemical cross-linking studies on the PTH-1 receptor have suggested that portions of the NH2-terminal extracellular receptor domain interact with the COOH-terminal (positions 15–34) binding domain of PTH (8Jüppner H.

Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor region at the COOH-terminal base of the extracellular domain (residues 182–190; cf. Fig. 1) was initially identified as a candidate ligand binding site by a homolog-scanning mutagenesis strategy. Replacement of this region of the rat PTH-1 receptor with the corresponding region of the secretin receptor abolished binding of PTH-(1–34) without affecting surface expression (23Lee C. Luck M. Jüppner H. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1269-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Independent studies have demonstrated that a [Lys13(ε-p-Bz2)]PTH-(1–34) analog cross-linked to this same region of the human PTH-1 receptor (24Zhou A. Bessalle R. Bisello A. Nakamoto C. Rosenblatt M.

Rosenblatt M. Suva L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the current study, we explore further the role of nine amino acids in this juxtamembrane segment of the NH2-terminal domain of the rat PTH-1 receptor in determining the functional interaction with PTH-(1–34). The results reveal four receptor residues that modulate interaction with the 3–14 portion of PTH and suggest that hydrophobicity is required for optimal ligand-binding and cAMP-signaling potency at Phe184 and Leu187. [Nle8,18,Tyr34]bPTH-(3–34)NH2(PTH-(3–34)) was purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). [Nle8,18,Tyr34]bPTH-(1–34)NH2(PTH-(1–34)), and [Glu22,Trp23,Tyr36]human PTHrP-(15–36)NH2([Glu22,Trp23]PTHrP-(15–36)) were prepared on an Applied Biosystems model 431A peptide synthesizer using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protecting group chemistry and trifluoroacetic acid-mediated cleavage/deprotection (MGH Biopolymer Synthesis Facility, Boston, MA); these peptide were then purified by high performance liquid chromatography and lyophilized. The peptide rPTH-(1–14)NH2(PTH-(1–14)) was synthesized on a multiple peptide synthesizer (Advanced Chemtech model 396 MBS) and desalted by adsorption on a C18-containing cartridge (Sep-Pak). All peptides were reconstituted in 10 mm acetic acid and stored at ∼80 °C. The purity, identity, and stock concentration of each compound was secured by analytical high performance liquid chromatography, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis. Radiolabeling of PTH-(1–34) and PTH-(3–34) was performed using125I-Na (2200 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) and chloramine-T; the resultant 125I-labeled ligand was purified by high performance liquid chromatography. The construction and initial characterization of the pCDNA-1-based (InVitrogen, San Diego, CA) plasmids encoding the intact epitope-tagged rat PTH-1 receptor (rWT-HA, or wild type) has been described previously (5Lee C. Gardella T. Abou-Samra A.-B. Nussbaum S. Segre G. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H. Jüppner H. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1488-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The HA tag in rWT-HA is a nine-amino acid sequence that replaces residues 93–101 in the receptor's extracellular domain and does not affect receptor function (5Lee C. Gardella T. Abou-Samra A.-B. Nussbaum S. Segre G. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H. Jüppner H. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1488-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Point mutations were incorporated into single-strand wild type receptor plasmid DNA by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (26Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of each mutant plasmid was verified by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using single-stranded plasmid DNA as template. The construction and initial characterization of the pCDNA-1-based plasmid encoding the epitope-tagged amino-terminally truncated rat PTH-1 receptor (rΔNt-HA) has also been described previously (22Luck M.D Carter P.H. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this receptor, residues 23–181 have been removed, and a nine-amino acid HA tag joined to a tetraglycine linker (YPYDVPDYAGGGG-) has been inserted between Ala22 and Glu182. Signal peptidase cleavage is predicted to occur between Ala22 and the tyrosine of the HA tag (27Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar). The Phe184 point mutation was incorporated into rΔNt-HA as described above. Stock solutions of EGTA/trypsin and antibiotics were from Life Technologies, Inc.; fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). COS-7 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%); penicillin G (20 units/ml), streptomycin sulfate (20 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (0.05 μg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Transient transfections of COS-7 cells were performed using DEAE-dextran as described previously (17Bergwitz C. Jusseaume S. Luck M. Jüppner H. Gardella T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28861-28868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected in 24-well plates when the cells were 85–95% of confluency using 200 ng of plasmid DNA that was purified by cesium chloride/ethidium bromide gradient centrifugation for each well. Twenty-four to sixteen hours prior to assay, the cells were treated with fresh media and shifted to a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 that was set at 33 °C (17Bergwitz C. Jusseaume S. Luck M.

Assays were conducted 72–96 h after transfection, at which point ∼20% of the cells were transfected and expressed surface wild type PTH receptors at a density of about 5 × 106/cell (17Bergwitz C.

Binding reactions were performed with transiently transfected COS-7 cells in 24-well plates. Cells were rinsed with 0.5 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 0.5% fetal bovine serum, adjusted to pH 7.7 with HCl) and treated successively with 200 μl of binding buffer and 100 μl of binding buffer containing ∼100,000 cpm of 125I-tracer (∼26 fmol; final volume = 300 μl). The cells were incubated at 15 °C for 4 h and placed on ice; the binding medium was removed, and the monolayer was rinsed three times with 0.5 ml of cold binding buffer and lysed with 0.5 ml of 5 n NaOH. The entire lysate was counted for γ-irradiation. Nonspecific binding was determined in cells transfected with the pCDNA-1 vector and was typically less than 1.5% of the total radioactivity added. Measurements of surface expression for the HA epitope-tagged receptors by indirect antibody binding methods was performed with intact transfected COS-7 cells in 24-well plates. Cells were washed with 0.5 ml of binding buffer and then incubated with 0.25 ml of binding buffer containing the mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 1 μg/ml for 2 h at 15 °C. The buffer was removed, and the cells were then washed three times with 0.5 ml of binding buffer and incubated for an additional 2 h at 15 °C with 0.25 ml of binding buffer containing ∼400,000 cpm of 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (NEN Life Science Products). The buffer was withdrawn, and cells were then washed three times with 0.5 ml of binding buffer and lysed with 5 n NaOH. The entire lysate was counted for γ-irradiation. Nonspecific binding was determined in cells transfected with the pCDNA-1 vector and was typically less than 0.5% of the total radioactivity added. Stimulation of transiently transfected COS-7 cells was performed in 24-well plates. Cells were rinsed with 0.5 ml of binding buffer and treated with 200 μl of cAMP assay buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 35 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4), and 100 μl of binding buffer containing varying amounts of peptide analog (final volume = 300 μl). The medium was removed after incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, and the cells were frozen (−80 °C), lysed with 0.5 ml of 50 mm HCl, and refrozen (−80 °C). The cAMP content of the diluted lysate was determined by radioimmunoassay using unlabeled cAMP as a standard. The cAMP EC50 values were determined using nonlinear regression (see below). The cAMP stimulation protocol described above was utilized for inhibition studies with some minor modifications. Cells were rinsed with 0.5 ml of binding buffer and treated successively with 100 μl of cAMP assay buffer, 50 μl of binding buffer containing varying doses of [Glu22,Trp23]PTHrP (15–36), and 100 μl of cAMP assay buffer containing a 1 nm dose of rPTH-(1–34) (final volume = 250 μl). Cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and processed as above. The dose of [Glu22,Trp23]PTHrP-(15–36) that inhibited the PTH-(1–34)-mediated cAMP response by 50% (IC50A) was calculated using nonlinear regression analysis (see below). All calculations were performed using Microsoft® Excel. Nonlinear regression analysis of binding and cAMP stimulation data was performed using four parameters, defined as the Minimum (Min), Maximum (Max), midpoint (IC50), and slope of the response curve. The predicted response (yp) for a given dose (x) of peptide was calculated using the following equation: yp= Min + ((Max − Min)/(1 + (IC50/x)slope)). The initial parameter values were estimated from the primary data, and the Excel “Solver function” was then used to vary the four parameters in order to minimize the differences between the predicted and actual responses (least-squares method) (29Bowen W. Jerman J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The statistical significance between two data sets was determined using a one-tailed Student'st test, assuming unequal variances for the two sets. We introduced individual alanine substitutions at each position in the 182–190 region of the rat PTH-1 receptor (Fig.1) and analyzed the effects on receptor function in transiently transfected COS-7 cells (Table I). The surface expression of the alanine-substituted mutants ranged from 85 to 113% of the wild type receptor, as judged by antibody-binding analysis (Table I). Four of the mutations (Phe184 → Ala, Arg186 → Ala, Leu187 → Ala, and Ile190 → Ala) reduced the capacity of the receptor to bind the agonist tracer125I-PTH-(1–34) by 4-fold or more (Fig.2). The strongest effect occurred with the Phe184 → Ala mutation, which reduced binding to 4 ± 0.4% of the binding seen with the wild type receptor. A similar pattern was observed when the alanine-substituted mutant receptors were tested for their capacity to bind the partial agonist tracer 125I-PTH-(3–34) (Table I). Each of the nine alanine-substituted mutant receptors mediated a comparable maximal (40-fold) increase in intracellular cAMP in response to high doses of PTH-(1–34), as was observed with the wild type receptor (Table I). The cAMP-stimulating potency of PTH (1–34) with most of the alanine-substituted mutants was similar to the potency seen with the wild type receptor (EC50 1.4 ± 0.3 nm, Table I), but the Phe184 → Ala mutation resulted in an 8-fold decrease in potency of PTH-(1–34) agonist peptide relative to rWT-HA (p = 0.02, Fig.3).Table IBinding and cAMP stimulation properties of PTH-1 receptor mutantsReceptorMaximum specific binding (B0)cAMP stimulation dataAntibody125I-PTH-(1–34)125I-PTH-(3–34)PTH-(1–34), EC50PTH-(1–34), EmaxPTH-(1–14), Maxobs% WT% WT% WTnm% WT% WTrWT-HA100 ± 2100 ± 2100 ± 21.4 ± 0.3100 ± 1100 ± 1EA-182107 ± 3105 ± 295 ± 31.3 ± 0.6115 ± 7113 ± 5VA-183101 ± 291 ± 264 ± 20.6 ± 0.397 ± 1565 ± 4FA-18499 ± 14 ± 0.46 ± 311.0 ± 3.594 ± 814 ± 2DA-185106 ± 2116 ± 4137 ± 40.7 ± 0.393 ± 12133 ± 5RA-186113 ± 325 ± 17 ± 11.1 ± 0.1100 ± 99 ± 1LA-18794 ± 210 ± 123 ± 12.2 ± 0.893 ± 75 ± 1GA-18893 ± 3120 ± 4123 ± 31.0 ± 0.6102 ± 8146 ± 5MA-189102 ± 294 ± 284 ± 30.6 ± 0.2106 ± 1193 ± 6IA-19085 ± 224 ± 216 ± 11.3 ± 0.586 ± 89 ± 1FD-184115 ± 22 ± 0.30.3 ± 0.1111.0 ± 80.178 ± 24 ± 1FE-184107 ± 412 ± 35 ± 140.6 ± 11.866 ± 56 ± 1FG-184113 ± 33 ± 11 ± 0.262.9 ± 18.670 ± 29 ± 2FH-184116 ± 215 ± 28 ± 110.8 ± 0.987 ± 214 ± 2FI-184120 ± 537 ± 236 ± 10.6 ± 0.2112 ± 455 ± 4FK-184110 ± 43 ± 11 ± 0.248.5 ± 10.877 ± 55 ± 1FL-18498 ± 261 ± 231 ± 22.3 ± 0.4105 ± 446 ± 4FM-184103 ± 360 ± 340 ± 31.8 ± 0.590 ± 547 ± 4FR-184119 ± 45 ± 15 ± 133.2 ± 3.695 ± 78 ± 1FV-184111 ± 39 ± 29 ± 28.7 ± 1.284 ± 317 ± 2DI-18597 ± 2108 ± 1122 ± 21.5 ± 0.596 ± 6161 ± 7DK-185103 ± 1107 ± 1126 ± 21.4 ± 0.3108 ± 4181 ± 12RI-186104 ± 252 ± 213 ± 11.1 ± 0.394 ± 625 ± 2RK-186101 ± 2102 ± 2106 ± 11.5 ± 0.2104 ± 7123 ± 6LE-18778 ± 30 ± 0.81 ± 1493.9 ± 19.319 ± 49 ± 1LH-18798 ± 24 ± 14 ± 0.430.4 ± 14.674 ± 411 ± 2LI-187104 ± 2283 ± 187 ± 11.7 ± 0.491 ± 241 ± 3LR-18799 ± 12 ± 17 ± 1406.9 ± 0.827 ± 110 ± 1LV-18799 ± 169 ± 261 ± 14.3 ± 0.492 ± 126 ± 3Maximum specific binding data (n = 3) and cAMP stimulation data (n = 3) were obtained as described under “Materials and Methods.” The maximum specific binding (expressed as percentage of total counts added) to rWT-HA was 2.3 ± 0.1% (antibody), 20 ± 0.5% (125I-PTH-(1–34)), and 26 ± 1% (125I-PTH-(3–34)).

As reported previously (22Luck M.D Carter P.H. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), stimulation of rWT-HA with a 100 μm dose of PTH-(1–14) induced a 14-fold increase in cAMP formation relative to the basal response. Stimulation of the alanine-substituted mutants with the same dose of PTH-(1–14) revealed that Phe184 → Ala, Arg186 → Ala, Leu187 → Ala, and Ile190 → Ala each showed a 7–20-fold reduced responsiveness to this peptide in cAMP assays relative to rWT-HA (p < 0.0001, Fig.4). To analyze the effect of the alanine mutations on interactions involving the COOH-terminal binding domain of PTH-(1–34), we utilized the fragment [Glu22,Trp23,Tyr36]PTHrP-(15–36)NH2(30Gardella T. Luck M. Jensen G. Usdin T. Jüppner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19888-19893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and tested for its ability to block the cAMP response induced by a 1 nm dose of PTH-(1–34) with each mutant receptor. With rWT-HA, a 10 μm dose of [Glu22,Trp23,Tyr36] PTHrP-(15–36)NH2did not significantly inhibit the cAMP response induced by PTH-(1–34) (Fig. 5 A), a result that is consistent with the weak ability of this fragment to inhibit the binding of 125I-PTH-(1–34) to COS-7 cells transfected with rWT-HA (IC50 >1000 nm) (30Gardella T. Luck M. Jensen G. Usdin T. Jüppner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19888-19893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). With the mutants containing alanine-substitutions at positions 184, 186, 187, and 190, a 10 μm dose of [Glu22,Trp23Tyr36]PTHrP-(15–36)NH2significantly inhibited the PTH-(1–34)-mediated response (Fig.5 A). This inhibition was dose-dependent and attained 50% reduction of the control response at doses of 2.9 ± 0.3, 3.8 ± 1.1, and 11.0 ± 2.9 μm, for the Phe184 → Ala, Leu187 → Ala, and Ile190 → Ala mutants, respectively (Fig. 5 B). When a 10 μm dose of [Glu22,Trp23]PTHrP-(15–36) was tested against a full-range dose response curve of PTH-(1–34) with rWT-HA, Phe184 → Ala and Ile190 → Ala, a rightward shift in cAMP-stimulating potency was observed only for the alanine-substituted mutants (data not shown); since this rightward shift was not accompanied by a reduction in cAMP-stimulating efficacy of PTH-(1–34), the inhibition of PTH-(1–34) by [Glu22,Trp23]PTHrP-(15–36) is most likely occurring through a competitive binding mechanism. To determine if other residues in the NH2-terminal extracellular domain of the PTH-1 receptor were required for the functional effects observed for the mutations in the 182–190 region, we utilized a truncated rat PTH-1 receptor (rΔNt-HA) that lacked residues 23–181 and had in their place a nine-amino acid HA epitope tag (Fig. 6 A) (22Luck M.D Carter P.H. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Introduction of the Phe184 → Ala mutation into rΔNt-HA yielded a truncated mutant receptor that was expressed on the cellular surface to the same level as unsubstituted rΔNT-HA (Fig.6 B). The unsubstituted truncated receptor elicited ∼6-fold increases in cAMP levels in response to either 1 μmPTH-(1–34) or 100 μm PTH-(1–14); rΔNt-HA(FA-184) exhibited little or no response to these peptides (Fig.6 C). In order to characterize the chemical basis for the role of the 182–190 region in interacting with PTH-(1–34), we examined the effects of a number of polar and nonpolar mutations in the 184–187 segment of intact rWT-HA (Table I and Fig.7). All of these point mutations yielded mutant receptors that were well expressed on the cell surface (range = 78–120% of rWT-HA, Table I). Substitution of the polar amino acids Glu, Lys, and Arg at position 184 resulted in 10–50-fold reductions in the maximal specific binding of125I-PTH-(1–34), the cAMP-signaling potency of PTH-(1–34), and the cAMP-signaling efficacy of PTH-(1–14) (Table Iand Fig. 7). Substitution of the nonpolar amino acids Ile, Met, and Leu at position 184 resulted in less severe (∼2-fold) reductions in PTH-(1–34) binding and PTH-(1–14) stimulation and did not significantly impact the stimulation by PTH-(1–34). Mutation of Asp185 to either Ile or Lys did not alter the binding or signaling properties of PTH analogs. In accord with the findings of Adams and co-workers (25Adams A. Bisello A. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Suva L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the introduction of lysine at position 186 was well tolerated in both binding and signaling assays. The Arg186 → Ile mutant showed a 2-fold reduction in the maximum specific binding of 125I-PTH-(1–34) and a 7.5-fold reduction in the specific binding of 125I-PTH (3–34), as compared with rWT-HA, but responded normally to PTH-(1–34) in cAMP stimulation assays. Interestingly, the Arg186 → Ile mutant receptor was less functionally impaired than the Arg186 → Ala receptor. Substitution of the polar residue Glu, His, or Arg at position 187 with Ala resulted in severe reductions (>15-fold) in PTH-(1–34) binding capacity and the cAMP-stimulation potency of PTH-(1–34), whereas introduction of Ile and Val at this position resulted in small (∼2-fold) or no reductions in PTH-(1–34)-binding capacity or cAMP signaling potency of PTH-(1–34). The present study was conducted to explore the functional role(s) of individual residues in the (182–190) juxtamembrane region of the NH2-terminal domain of the PTH-1 receptor. The potential importance of this segment of the receptor was recognized previously in a homolog-scanning mutagenesis study (23Lee C. Luck M. Jüppner H. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1269-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has also been investigated by photochemical cross-linking (24Zhou A. Bessalle R. Bisello A. Nakamoto C. Rosenblatt M. Suva L.J. Chorev M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Adams A. Bisello A. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Suva L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and spectroscopic methods (31Pellegrini M. Bisello A. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. Mierke D.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12737-12743Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the current study, we extended the functional analysis by first performing an alanine-scanning experiment, the results of which suggested that Phe184, Arg186, Leu187, and Ile190 played a role in the optimal binding of 125I-PTH-(1–34) (Fig. 2),125I-PTH-(3–34) (Table I), and125I-PTHrP-(1–36) (data not shown). Additional point mutations targeted to this region verified the importance of Phe184 and Leu187 and suggested that side chain hydrophobicity at these positions is a key determinant of ligand/receptor interaction (Table I). All of the mutant receptors in this study were expressed near wild type levels on the surface of transfected COS-7 cells, as judged by antibody binding. The decreases in maximum specific binding of radiolabeled PTH tracers observed for several of these mutants suggest that certain substitutions in the 182–190 region reduce ligand binding affinity. The low specific binding of radiolabeled PTH-(1–34) (less than 3% of total counts added) observed with the key mutants prevented us from performing meaningful competition binding assays. However, Phe184 → Ala, Arg186 → Ala, Leu187 → Ala, and Ile190 → Ala did allow for competitive antagonism of the PTH-(1–34)-induced cAMP response by the weak-binding fragment [Glu22,Trp23]PTHrP-(15–36) (Fig. 5); this is consistent with the weakened binding of PTH-(1–34). In addition, for the mutations that reduced the specific binding of125I-bPTH-(1–34) to less than 6% of that seen with the wild type receptor, the cAMP-stimulating potencies of PTH-(1–34) were 8–300-fold weaker than that seen for the wild type receptor (Table I). These results are consistent with the above mutant receptors exhibiting a reduced affinity for PTH-(1–34), although the possibility of additional activation-specific effects caused by the mutations cannot be excluded. To localize the region of the ligand affected by the mutations in the 182–190 region of the receptor, we examined the ability of the mutant receptors to interact with PTH ligands of varying length. The Phe184 → Ala, Arg186 → Ala, Leu187 → Ala, and Ile190 → Ala receptors each (i) reduced the specific binding of 125I-PTH-(3–34), (ii) reduced the cAMP-signaling responsiveness to PTH-(1–14), and (iii) enhanced the ability of [Glu22,Trp23,Tyr36]PTHrP-(15–36)NH2to inhibit the cAMP response mediated by PTH-(1–34). In addition, every receptor in this study that exhibited impaired capacity to bind125I-PTH-(3–34) also demonstrated reduced responsiveness to PTH-(1–14) (Table I). These data suggest that the mutations in the 182–190 region of the PTH-1 receptor alter interactions with the 3–14 portion of PTH-(1–34). These receptor mutations at the COOH-terminal end of the amino-terminal domain thus stand in contrast to previously described PTH-1 receptor mutations at the receptor's extreme amino terminus (e.g. Thr33 → Ala, which impaired the binding of PTH-(1–34) but did not affect PTH-(1–14) signaling), and in the third extracellular loop (e.g. Trp437 → Ala, which impaired the binding of PTH-(1–34) but not PTH-(3–34)) (15Mannstadt M. Luck M. Gardella T. Jüppner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16890-16896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Luck M.D Carter P.H. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lee C. Luck M. Jüppner H. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1269-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of most of the amino-terminal domain of the PTH-1 receptor (residues 23–181) abolishes detectable binding of125I-labeled PTH analogs; however, we recently showed that surface expression levels and cAMP-signaling responsiveness to PTH-(1–34) and PTH-(1–14) are partially preserved in this truncated rΔ(Nt)-HA receptor (22Luck M.D Carter P.H. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The insertion of the Phe184 → Ala mutation into rΔ(Nt)-HA severely diminished the cAMP-signaling responses to both PTH-(1–34) and PTH-(1–14) without affecting receptor expression. These data indicate that the role of Phe184 in rΔ(Nt)-HA is homologous with its role in the full-length PTH-1 receptors and thus suggest that Phe184does not depend on the major portion of the amino-terminal domain for its interaction with PTH-(1–34). Recently, Pellegrini, et al. (31Pellegrini M. Bisello A. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. Mierke D.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12737-12743Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) determined the structure of a synthetic peptide containing residues 168–198 of the PTH-1 receptor in a micellar solution of dodecylphosphocholine using NMR spectroscopy and demonstrated that residues 180–189 of this receptor fragment formed an amphipathic α-helix, which was lipid-associated. These authors suggested that the solvent-exposed hydrophilic face of this helix interacts with charged residues in the COOH-terminal portion of PTH-(1–34) (31Pellegrini M. Bisello A. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. Mierke D.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12737-12743Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our current functional data are most consistent with the view that residues Phe184, Arg186, Leu187, and Ile190 in the PTH-1 receptor interact with the 3–14 region of PTH-(1–34) and that this interaction is important for ligand binding and ligand-induced cAMP signaling. If the 182–190 region of the intact receptor were to be α-helical, than these four critical residues at positions 184, 186, 187, and 190 would form a contiguous surface; the results of our substitution analysis would suggest that the hydrophobicity of Phe184 and Leu187 and possibly the aliphatic portion of the side chain of Arg186 contribute to the functionality of this surface. Our mutational data do not allow us to distinguish whether or not these four residues exert their effects on ligand function through a direct or an indirect mechanism, but the cross-linking of a [Lys13(ε-p-Bz2)]PTH-(1–34) analog to Arg186 in the PTH-1 receptor (25Adams A. Bisello A. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Suva L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) suggests that some contact could occur between this receptor surface and the ligand. Further work is clearly needed to resolve how the residues in this domain of the PTH-1 receptor contribute to the structure of the receptor and to its interaction with PTH ligands and to determine whether the corresponding regions of other class II receptors are involved in analogous interactions with their respective peptide ligands. We gratefully acknowledge Drs. John T. Potts, Jr. and Ernestina Schipani for reading the manuscript and providing insightful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2105330036,"Mx proteins are large GTPases, which play a pivotal role in the interferon type I-mediated response against viral infections. The human MxA inhibits the replication of several RNA viruses and is organized in oligomeric structures. Using two different experimental approaches, the mammalian two-hybrid system and an interaction dependent nuclear translocation approach, three domains in the carboxyl-terminal moiety were identified that are involved in the oligomerization of MxA. The first consists of a carboxyl-terminal amphipathic helix (LZ1), which binds to a more proximal part of the same molecule. This intramolecular backfolding is a prerequisite for the formation of an intermolecular complex. This intermolecular interaction is mediated by two domains, a poorly defined region generated by the intramolecular interaction and a domain located between amino acids 363 and 415. Co-expression of wild-type MxA with various mutant fragments thereof revealed that the presence of the carboxyl-terminal region comprising the amphipathic helices LZ1 and LZ2 is necessary and sufficient to exert a dominant negative effect. This finding suggests that the functional interference of the carboxyl-terminal region is due to competition for binding of an as yet unidentified cellular or viral target molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2057005727,"Photosystem II catalyzes photosynthetic water oxidation. The oxidation of water to molecular oxygen requires four sequential oxidations; the sequentially oxidized forms of the catalytic site are called the S states. An extrinsic subunit, the manganese-stabilizing protein (MSP), promotes the efficient turnover of the S states. MSP can be removed and rebound to the reaction center; removal and reconstitution is associated with a decrease in and then a restoration of enzymatic activity. We have isotopically edited MSP by uniform 13C labeling of the Escherichia coli-expressed protein and have obtained the Fourier transform infrared spectrum associated with the S1 to S2transition in the presence either of reconstituted 12C or13C MSP. 13C labeling of MSP is shown to cause 30–60 cm−1 shifts in a subset of vibrational lines. The derived, isotope-edited vibrational spectrum is consistent with a deprotonation of glutamic/aspartic acid residues on MSP during the S1 to S2 transition; the base, which accepts this proton(s), is not located on MSP. This finding suggests that this subunit plays a role as a stabilizer of a charged transition state and, perhaps, as a general acid/base catalyst of oxygen evolution. These results provide a molecular explanation for known MSP effects on oxygen evolution."

The insensitivity to insulin and relative insulin deficiency in NIDDM lead to a decrease in glucose utilization by liver, muscle, and adipose tissue and to an increase in the hepatic glucose production (4McGarry J.D. Science. 1992; 258: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Neither the role of hepatic metabolism in the development of type 2 diabetes nor its alterations are well established. The development of diabetes in male Zucker diabetic fatty rats (ZDF rats) has many features in common with human NIDDM (5Peterson R.G. Shaw W.N. Neel M.-A. Little L.A. Eichberg J. ILAR News. 1990; 32: 16-19Crossref Google Scholar). Male ZDF rats develop progressive insulin resistance and glucose intolerance between 3 and 8 weeks of age and usually become completely diabetic between 8 and 10 weeks, whereas their lean counterparts (ZLC rats) develop neither insulin resistance nor diabetes. Therefore, they are considered a genetic model of type 2 diabetes. ZDF rats are hyperinsulinemic throughout development. In mammalian cells, glucose is phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P) by members of the hexokinase family. Hepatocytes from healthy rats contain mainly hexokinase IV, usually called glucokinase (GK), and small amounts of hexokinases I, II, and III. GK differs from the rest of hexokinases in that it is approximately half as large, it is not allosterically inhibited by Glu-6-P, and it has a much higher S0.5 for glucose (8 mm versus50–100 μm). In recent studies, we have shown that overexpression of GK, but not hexokinase I, in healthy Wistar rat hepatocytes by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer leads to marked enhancement of glycolysis and glycogen synthesis (6O'Doherty R.M.

Male ZDF (ZDF/Gmi-fa/fa) and ZLC (ZLC/+/fa and +/+) rats were purchased from Genetic Models (Indianapolis, IN). The animals were used when they were 12–13 weeks old. At this age, the blood glucose levels (9:00–10:00) were 24 ± 4 mm in ZDF and 5.2 ± 0.5 mm in ZLC rats. Hepatocytes were isolated from 24-h fasted animals by collagenase perfusion as described (12Massague J. Guinovart J.J. FEBS Lett. 1977; 82: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Whittaker) supplemented with 10 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum (Whittaker), 100 nm insulin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 100 nm dexamethasone (Sigma) and seeded onto plastic plates of 60-mm diameter treated with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma) at a final density of 6 × 104cell/cm2. After cell attachment (5 h at 37 °C), hepatocytes were treated with stocks of AdCMV-GKL or AdCMV-HKI at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for 2 h at 37 °C. After treatment with the virus, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mmglucose, 1 nm dexamethasone, and 1 nm insulin. Cells were incubated for 16 h, and then experimental manipulations were performed as detailed in the text and figure legends. At the end of each experimental manipulation, cell monolayers were frozen in liquid N2 until analysis. To measure enzyme activities, 100 μl of homogenization buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm KF, 15 mm EDTA, 600 mm sucrose, 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to frozen plates containing the cell monolayers, and cells were collected with a plastic scraper. Cells were lysed by thawing and checked under light microscopy for completeness. Homogenates were collected in Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatants and pellets were used for determinations. Protein concentration was measured as described by Bradford (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad assay reagent.

The activity measured in the absence of Glu-6-P represents the active form of the enzyme (I or a form), whereas the activity tested in the presence of 6.6 mm Glu-6-P is a measure of total activity. The ratio of these two activities is known as the glycogen synthase activity ratio and is an estimate of the extent of the activation of the enzyme. glucose-6-phosphatase activity was measured in both supernatant and pellet fractions as described (16Alegre M.

Frozen plates were scraped with 100 μl of a homogenization buffer at pH 7.4 with 50 mm glycylglycine, 15 mm EDTA, 100 mm KF, and 5 mm potassium phosphate. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and total PK activity and activity ratio (V0.15/V, measured at 0.15 and 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, respectively) were determined in the supernatants as described (17Feliu J.E.

Biochem. 1982; 129: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The intracellular concentrations of Glu-6-P were measured by spectrophotometric assays (20Lang G. Michal G. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974: 1238-1242Google Scholar).l-Lactate levels in the incubation medium were measured as described (21Gutmann I. Wahlefel A.W. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974: 1464-1468Google Scholar). Results are given as the mean ± S.E. for the indicated number of experiments. Comparisons among the different experimental groups were carried out by unpaired Student'st test. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Glucose-phosphorylating capacity and glucose-6-phosphatase activity were measured in homogenates of hepatocytes from ZDF and ZLC rats (Table I). GK activity, measured as the difference between the glucose-phosphorylating capacity of the extract assayed at 100 and 0.5 mm glucose, was about 4.5-fold lower in hepatocytes from ZDF rats than in hepatocytes from ZLC rats (3.5 ± 0.4 milliunits/106 cells compared with 16.2 ± 1.7 milliunits/106 cells). In contrast, hexokinase activity, measured as the glucose-phosphorylating capacity of the extract assayed at 0.5 mm glucose, was higher in ZDF rats than in ZLC rats (6.5 ± 0.9 milliunits/106 cells compared with 3.8 ± 0.6 milliunits/106 cells). Glucose-6-phosphatase activity was not significantly different (Table I). ZDF and ZLC hepatocytes preincubated for 16 h in 1 mm glucose and then transferred to media containing 1, 5, 10, and 25 mm glucose for 2 h showed a glucose concentration-dependent increase in Glu-6-P levels (Fig.1). Glu-6-P rose from 0.27 ± 0.04 nmol/106 cells and 0.38 ± 0.08 nmol/106cells to 0.89 ± 0.09 nmol/106 cells and 0.81 ± 0.08 nmol/106 cells in ZLC and ZDF hepatocytes, respectively, when glucose was increased from 1 to 25 mm. Despite altered ratios of GK to hexokinase activity, no significant differences in Glu-6-P concentration were observed between hepatocytes from ZLC and ZDF rats. This probably reflects the higher efficiency of hexokinase due to its lower Km for glucose.Table IEnzyme activities in ZLC and ZDF hepatocytesGlucokinaseHexokinaseGlucose 6-phosphatasePiruvate kinasemilliunits/106 cellsZLC16.2 ± 1.73.8 ± 0.620.3 ± 2.4310.6 ± 2.4ZDF3.5 ± 0.4ap < 0.001, compared with ZLC cells.6.5 ± 0.9bp < 0.01, compared with ZLC cells.19.6 ± 1.957.9 ± 4.9ap < 0.001, compared with ZLC cells.ZDF and ZLC hepatocytes were incubated for 16 h in the presence of 1 mm glucose.

Cells were then collected for measurement of glucokinase, hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and pyruvate kinase activities. Data represent the mean ± S.E.M. for five independent experiments. To determine the glycolytic flux of the hepatocytes from ZLC and ZDF rats, lactate production, PK activity, and Fru-2,6-P2concentration were analyzed. Lactate accumulation was measured using an experimental approach identical to that described earlier for the determination of Glu-6-P. We found a sharp glucose-dependent increase in lactate production and in Fru-2,6-P2 concentration in hepatocytes from ZLC rats but not in hepatocytes from ZDF rats (Fig.2). Lactate production in hepatocytes from ZLC rats was higher than in hepatocytes from ZDF rats at all glucose concentrations tested. Hepatocytes from ZDF rats hardly modified their lactate production in response to an increase in glucose concentration, and only a slight increase in Fru2,6P2concentration was observed. Total PK activity was 5.4-fold lower in ZDF hepatocytes than in ZLC hepatocytes (Table I). The PK activity ratio was also lower in ZDF than in ZLC hepatocytes (0.20 ± 0.03 versus 0.31 ± 0.04). This activity ratio was not altered when cells were incubated in different glucose concentrations (Fig.3). These results could explain the difference in lactate accumulation observed in ZDF hepatocytes in comparison with ZLC hepatocytes. PK is one of the rate-limiting steps in glycolysis; therefore, a decrease in its activity is clearly reflected in the overall flux of glycolysis. To evaluate glycogen synthesis in ZDF and ZLC hepatocytes, a number of assays were performed. We determined the glycogen content using an experimental approach identical to that described earlier for the determination of Glu-6-P levels. A glucose concentration-dependent increase in glycogen content in ZLC hepatocytes was found. In contrast, ZDF hepatocytes deposited only negligible amounts of glycogen in response to glucose (Fig. 1). In light of this dramatic difference, we determined the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme for glycogenesis, glycogen synthase. Total glycogen synthase activity, measured in the presence of 6.6 mm Glu-6-P, was not significantly different in ZDF and ZLC hepatocytes (2.0 ± 0.2 milliunits/106 cellsversus 2.1 ± 0.2 milliunits/106 cells). Moreover, the amount of glycogen synthase protein measured by immunoblotting was also the same in the two groups (data not shown). In addition, glycogen phosphorylase activity was not significantly different in ZDF and ZLC hepatocytes (data not shown). The glycogen synthase activation state, calculated as the ratio of the enzyme activity measured in the absence of Glu-6-P to that in the presence of Glu-6-P, was determined in the 10,000 × g supernatant and pellet fractions of extracts prepared from hepatocytes treated as described earlier for the Glu-6-P measurements. The glycogen synthase (−Glu-6-P/+Glu-6-P) activity ratio increased in a glucose concentration-dependent fashion in ZLC hepatocytes in both pellet and supernatant fractions (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, the ratio was significantly lower in ZDF hepatocytes and did not change in response to glucose either in the supernatant or in the pellet. These findings explain their low capacity to synthesize glycogen. We have previously shown that GK overexpression greatly enhances glucose utilization and glycogen deposition in hepatocytes from healthy rats (6O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L. Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M.

It was then interesting to study the impact of GK overexpression in hepatocytes of this genetic model of NIDDM and evaluate the possibility that GK overexpression could correct the metabolic alterations observed in ZDF rat hepatocytes. The efficiency of the recombinant adenovirus for overexpression of GK in rat hepatocytes is well documented (6O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L. Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Newgard C.B. J.

This value was 48- and 10-fold higher than in untreated ZDF and ZLC hepatocytes, respectively. Untreated and AdCMV-GKL-treated ZDF hepatocytes preincubated for 16 h in 1 mm glucose and then transferred to media containing 1, 5, 10, and 25 mm glucose for 2 h showed a glucose concentration-dependent increase in Glu-6-P levels (Fig. 5). AdCMV-GKL-treated cells had higher levels than untreated hepatocytes in all conditions studied, but the effect was more pronounced at higher glucose concentration. The maximal difference was observed at 25 mm glucose, where Glu-6-P intracellular concentration was 15-fold higher than in ZDF-untreated cells. In order to evaluate the effect of GK overexpression in ZDF hepatocytes on the glycolytic flux, lactate production, PK activity, and Fru-2,6-P2 concentration were determined. AdCMV-GKL-treated cells produced about 3-fold more lactate and had 6–7-fold more Fru-2,6-P2 than untreated ZDF in all conditions studied (Fig. 6). PK activity ratio was higher in AdCMV-GKL-treated (0.33 ± 0.04) than in untreated ZDF hepatocytes (0.20 ± 0.03) (Fig.7 B). Moreover, PK total activity was also increased at high glucose concentrations in GK-overexpressing cells (80 ± 6.8 milliunits/106 cells) compared with untreated ones (57.5 ± 5.1 milliunits/106cells) (Fig. 7 B). These results may explain the enhanced glycolytic flux observed in AdCMV-GKL-treated cells.Figure 7Effects of GK overexpression on pyruvate kinase in ZDF hepatocytes. ZDF hepatocytes were treated with AdCMV-GKL (■) or left untreated (●) and incubated for 16 h in the presence of 1 mm glucose.

Total glycogen synthase activity was not significantly different in GK-overexpressing and untreated ZDF hepatocytes (2.1 ± 0.1 milliunits/106 cellsversus 2.2 ± 0.2 milliunits/106 cells), and the amount of glycogen synthase protein measured by immunoblotting was also the same in the two groups (data not shown). However, in GK-overexpressing ZDF hepatocytes, the capacity of glycogen synthase to be activated in a glucose-dependent manner in both supernatant and pellet fractions was restored. The glycogen synthase (−Glu-6-P/+Glu-6-P) activity ratio, determined in the 10,000 ×g supernatant and pellet fractions, was much higher in AdCMV-GKL-treated cells than in untreated ZDF cells (Fig.8, A and B). The maximal difference in the activity ratio was observed at 25 mm glucose in supernatants (0.46 ± 0.02versus 0.17 ± 0.02) and in pellets (0.48 ± 0.03versus 0.16 ± 0.02). The higher activation state of glycogen synthase in AdCMV-GKL-treated ZDF hepatocytes explains their enhanced capacity to synthesize glycogen in comparison with untreated ZDF hepatocytes. In our previous work (6O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L. Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol.

We thus attempted to determine whether HK overexpression affects glycogen in hepatocytes from ZDF rats. The efficiency of AdCMV-HKI for overexpression of HK I in rat hepatocytes is well known (6O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L. Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol.

ZDF rats develop type 2 diabetes concomitantly with peripheral insulin resistance. Although a good deal of information about the β-cell function of this model is available, much less is known about the carbohydrate metabolism in the liver of these animals. In this study, we have analyzed the response to glucose of cultured hepatocytes from ZDF rats in comparison with ZLC hepatocytes, their nondiabetic counterparts. ZDF hepatocytes clearly showed a decrease in their capacity to store glucose as glycogen and a fall in glycolytic flux. These result in a low rate of glucose utilization, which is a characteristic pattern of a diabetic phenotype. These defects are probably a consequence of the low activity of GK and PK in these cells. Decreased GK and PK activities have also been observed in the liver of ZDF rats, 2A. Barberà and J. J. Guinovart, unpublished data. and these alterations are preserved when hepatic cells are isolated and cultured. This indicates that ZDF cultured hepatocytes are a good model to study the alterations of carbohydrate metabolism in these animals. In the liver, glucose is stored as glycogen. The synthesis of this polysaccharide is a process that contributes to control of glycemia in the postprandial state. NIDDM is associated with an impairment of glycogen synthesis, which results in a decrease of glucose utilization by the liver, contributing to hyperglycemia. ZDF rat hepatocytes show a clear decrease in the ability to synthesize glycogen, although they have no alteration in total glycogen synthase activity. As described (22Ciudad C.J. Carabaza A. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Carabaza A. Ciudad C.J. Baque S. Guinovart J.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19351-19356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), glucose induces the activation of liver glycogen synthase through an increase in Glu-6-P, which causes the covalent activation of glycogen synthase, thus leading to an increase in glycogen accumulation. Although ZDF and ZLC hepatocytes show similar increases in the intracellular levels of Glu-6-P when incubated with glucose, glycogen synthase is normally activated in ZLC, while it remains essentially inactive in ZDF rat hepatocytes. A critical observation is that GK activity is very low in ZDF cells, while conversely HK activity is higher. Therefore, in ZLC hepatocytes Glu-6-P is mainly produced by GK, whereas in ZDF cells glucose phosphorylation is catalyzed mainly by other hexokinases. These data provide further support for our recent proposal of a differential regulatory impact of Glu-6-P produced by hexokinase versus GK in liver cells (7Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gómez-Ara A.M. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23756-23760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Since Glu-6-P is mainly produced by hexokinase in ZDF hepatocytes, this metabolite is not able to trigger activation of glycogen synthase and for this reason glucose does not induce glycogen synthesis. All of these results suggest that GK plays a key role in the activation of glycogen synthase and that the lack of GK activity is most probably responsible for the deficiency in glycogen synthesis of ZDF hepatocytes. Further support for this hypothesis was obtained by GK overexpression in ZDF hepatocytes. The increase in the intracellular levels of Glu-6-P produced by GK in the diabetic cells led to the activation of glycogen synthase and to an increase in glycogen accumulation, as we have observed in healthy hepatocytes (7Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gómez-Ara A.M. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23756-23760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, GK overexpression is able to rescue the ability of ZDF cells to synthesize glycogen in response to glucose. In clear agreement with our previous results (6O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23756-23760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) overexpression of HK I was without effect on glycogen deposition. On the other hand, glycolytic flux is also decreased in ZDF hepatocytes. Lactate production is much lower in ZDF hepatocytes than in ZLC hepatocytes. This result can be explained by the observed deficit in total and active PK activity and the decrease in the levels of Fru-2,6-P2. This metabolite controls a key step of glycolysis regulating the activity of phosphofructose kinase-1 and phosphofructose phosphatase-1. PK is also one of the limiting steps of glycolysis. PK activity is 5–6-fold lower in ZDF hepatocytes than in ZLC hepatocytes, and, moreover, its activation state is also lower. GK-overexpressing cells showed an increased glycolytic flux. Lactate production was 3-fold higher in ZDF hepatocytes treated with AdCMV-GKL. This result can be explained by the sum of several factors. First, the increase in GK activity produced a great increase in Glu-6-P levels that exerted a push effect and also resulted in an increase in the levels of Fru-2,6-P2, which raised the flux through phosphofructose kinase-1. Second, in GK-overexpressing cells, PK total activity as well as its activation state were increased. This increase in PK total activity can be explained by an enhancement in PK gene transcription by Glu-6-P as described in Refs. 25Vaulont S. Kahn A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar and 26Girard J. Perdereau D. Foufelle F. Prip-Buus C. Ferré P. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar. The net result of all of these factors would be an increase of the rate of lactate production. In summary, GK overexpression induced an increase in glucose utilization both by triggering glucose storage into glycogen and by increasing glycolysis. This finding indicates that GK overexpression can overcome the deficiency in glucose utilization characteristic of the hepatocytes isolated from ZDF rats and suggests gene therapy strategies that may be relevant to type 2 diabetes. In normal fasted animals, the liver has a net glucose synthesis and output, and after feeding it switches to net glucose uptake and storage. In type 2 diabetes, the liver fails to respond to postprandial increases in glucose. Studies in a variety of animal models of diabetes have led to the suggestion that lowering of the GK/glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme activity ratio, whether by a decrease in GK, an increase in glucose-6-phosphatase, or a combination of the two, may impair hepatic glucose metabolism and contribute to the etiology of diabetes (27Burchell A. Cain D.I. Diabetologia. 1985; 28: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 28Barzilai N. Rossetti L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9871-9874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In our model of type 2 diabetes, ZDF rats, we also observed a decrease in the GK/glucose-6-phosphatase ratio caused by the significant decrease in GK activity. Our results suggest that GK supplementation in ZDF rats may enhance hepatic glucose clearance, possibly to an extent that will result in a decrease in circulating glucose concentration. However, a cautionary note in this regard comes from a recent study in normal rats in which adenovirus-mediated overexpression of glucokinase in liver resulted in lowering of blood glucose, but with accompanying increases in free fatty acid and triglyceride levels (30O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L. Telemaque-Potts S. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2022-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether similar complications will arise when glucokinase is overexpressed in liver of NIDDM models such as the ZDF rat.

https://openalex.org/W2093252937,"Abstract Gsα regulates the differentiation of 3T3-L1 mouse embryonic fibroblasts to adipocytes, a process termed adipogenesis. Inducers of adipogenesis lead to a loss of Gsα and derepress differentiation to adipocytes. The broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein is shown to block induction of adipogenesis, suggesting an early role of tyrosine phosphorylation in adipogenesis. Staining of phosphotyrosine identified prominent staining of a ∼70-kDa protein, hypothesized to be the tyrosine kinase Syk. Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction amplification established the expression of Syk mRNA in these embryonic fibroblasts. Immunoprecipitations with Syk-specific antibodies demonstrated the presence of Syk in fibroblasts and a rapid increase in the amount of phospho-Syk, peaking at 24 h post induction. Clones constitutively expressing Gsα, which can no longer be induced to differentiate, no longer display increased phospho-Syk levels in response to inducers. The linkage between Gsα and Syk was probed by immunoprecipitations revealing association of Syk with Gsα in the absence of induction. Upon induction of adipogenesis, Gsα levels decline and phospho-Syk levels as well as Syk kinase activity increase. Expression of wild-type Syk both potentiates the ability of inducers to act as well as induces adipogenesis itself. Expression of the kinase-deficient Syk had no such effects on adipogenesis. These data provide a new insight into the control of adipogenesis, suggesting that Gsα represses adipogenesis via Syk. Treatment with the inducers promotes a decline in Gsα, increases in levels of phospho-Syk, and adipogenesis."

Elucidating the mechanisms regulating MCP-1 expression is important for understanding the interplay between this chemokine and immune responses and for providing possible approaches to block inflammation. Toward this goal, we and others have identified several regulatory regions that are important for MCP-1 expression (11Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M.

Using in vivo genomic footprinting (IVGF) protocols to map regions of factor occupancy and changes in factor occupancy that result from TNF induction in vivo, a distal and a proximal regulatory region separated by 2.1 kilobase pairs of DNA were described (11Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The distal regulatory region contains four elements: site A, κB1, κB2, and HS. Site A, the most 5′ of these sites, was constitutively occupied in vivo and required for maximum induction of the MCP-1 gene by TNF (11Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The protected and hypersensitive banding pattern that defined site A did not change in response to TNF. Two NF-κB binding sites, κB1 and κB2, surrounded a region (HS) that became hypersensitive to dimethylsulfate treatment upon TNF stimulation. The two κB sites and the HS were required for TNF induction and could function as an independent TNF-responsive element (11Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Ping D. Boekhoudt G.H. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar). The proximal region contains multiple elements as well and was required for stress-induced expression of MCP-1in cells derived from human, mouse, and rat tissues (11Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16Shyy J.Y.-J. Li Y.-S. Lin M.-C. Chen W. Yuan S. Usami S. Chien S. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). During TNF induction, three elements within this region become occupied: a GC box, site B, and κB3. The GC box is essential for TNF-mediated induction of MCP-1 (11Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Ping D. Boekhoudt G.H. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of site B and κB3 revealed that these sites were not essential for TNF induction (23Ping D. Boekhoudt G.H. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar). A functional interferon-γ activated site (13Zhou Z.H. Chartuvedi P. Han Y.-L. Aras S. Li L.-S.

A potential AP-1 binding site located just 5′ to the GC box has also been described, but a role for this site and AP-1 in this system is not clear (16Shyy J.Y.-J. Li Y.-S. Lin M.-C. Chen W. Yuan S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9526-9532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MCP-1/JE gene was identified originally because of its induction by the cytokine PDGF-BB (12Cochran B.H. Reffel A.C. Stiles C.D. Cell. 1983; 33: 939-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 29Rollins B.J. Morrison E.D. Stiles C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3738-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Using heterologous expression vectors and BALB/3T3 cells, PDGF-BB induction was mapped to a 240-base pair region encompassing the MCP-1 distal regulatory region (25Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Hwang G.Y. Wrentmore A.L. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17417-17424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Lam K.K. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 315-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that similar elements may control TNF and PDGF-BB regulation. In this report, we have examined whether similar mechanisms and elements controlled TNF and PDGF-BB induction of MCP-1. Three experimental approaches were employed: RNA expression analysis, IVGF, and in vitroDNA-protein binding assays. In contrast, to some previously reported results (25Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Hwang G.Y. Wrentmore A.L. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17417-17424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Lam K.K. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 315-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that PDGF-BB stimulatesMCP-1 through the proximal regulatory region and that the distal κB elements were not involved. PDGF-BB induction ofMCP-1 directed the assembly of the proximal region, including the GC box region. Both Sp1 and Sp3 were found to interact with this sequence in vitro. trans-Retinoic acid (TRA), an agent that inhibits PDGF-BB activity, was found to block Sp1/Sp3 assembly in vivo. With the exception of a slight reduction in total mRNA, TNF induction was unaffected by TRA treatment, including the occupancy of the proximal regulatory region. Treatment of cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), resulted in an immediate but moderate increase inMCP-1 mRNA that correlated with an induced occupancy of the proximal regulatory region. These data divide the various stimuli of MCP-1 induction into distinct groups and show that the mechanism(s) by which PDGF-BB and TNF induce MCP-1 are distinct but are likely to share some elements. Additionally, our data suggest that both cytokines increase the accessibility of the DNA to transcription factor binding and assembly. NIH3T3 and BALB/3T3 clone A31 murine fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Embryonic fibroblast cell lines containing targeted disruptions of the NF-κB subunits p50 and p65 were provided by Drs. A. Hoffmann and D. Baltimore (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). Unless otherwise indicated, all cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Inc., Logan, UT), 1 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. PDGF-BB (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and human recombinant TNF-α (Genzyme, Inc., Cambridge MA) were used at 30 ng/ml and 500 units/ml, respectively, for the time indicated. TRA (Sigma) was prepared as a 10 mm stock in Me2SO and stored at −20 °C. Cells were split and grown to approximately 85% confluency. As described by others (25Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Hwang G.Y. Wrentmore A.L. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17417-17424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Lam K.K. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 315-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), serum was reduced prior to the addition of PDGF-BB and TRA; this resulted in consistent results and responses to PDGF-BB and TRA. BALB/3T3 cells were transferred to media containing 0.5% serum for 24 h prior to the addition of TNF, PDGF-BB, TRA (10 μm), or TSA (50 ng/ml) for the time indicated in the experiment. These concentrations were determined empirically to produce the maximal effect. Total RNA was isolated from cells using the Nonidet P-40 lysis method as described previously (11Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). 12 μg of RNA were separated on denaturing formaldehyde gels, blotted, and probed with random primed labeled cDNA encoding MCP-1 or glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase (GAPDH) following standard procedures as described previously (11Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Ping D. Boekhoudt G.H. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blots were recorded on film as well as processed by PhosphorImager analysis. IVGF assays were done exactly as described (11Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Ping D. Boekhoudt G.H. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar). IVGF assays of the coding strand of the distal regulatory region and the noncoding strand for the proximal regulatory region are shown because these are the most informative strands. In all cases tested, in vivo footprints obtained from the other strands produced the appropriate pattern (11Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Only BALB/3T3 cells were used for these experiments because NIH3T3 cells have sequence polymorphisms in one of their MCP-1 promoter alleles that prevent the reading of the sequence pattern (11Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Ping D. Boekhoudt G.H. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar). The pJECAT2.6, pJECAT2.4, and pJECAT0.3 CAT reporter constructs containing the region from −2642 to +81, −2390 to +81, and −322 to +81 of the murineMCP-1 gene, respectively, were described earlier (11Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The CAT reporter construct p2.6mSP is identical to pJECAT2.6, except that the Sp1 site was mutated randomly as described previously (23Ping D. Boekhoudt G.H. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected by electroporation (Bio-Rad) with the indicated CAT reporter constructions as described previously (11Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Ping D. Boekhoudt G.H. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar). BALB/3T3 cells were not used for transient transfections because of their poor transfection efficiency (11Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Ping D. Boekhoudt G.H. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. J.

As a control for transfection efficiency between samples, all transfections contained 1 μg of pSV2AlkPhos, an alkaline phosphatase reporter vector. At 28 h post transfection, PDGF-BB was added. At 36 h, the cultures were collected and assayed for CAT protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and for alkaline phosphatase activity using a kit from Bio-Rad. Assays were normalized to their alkaline phosphatase reporter activity. The average of three transfections are shown. Nuclear extracts were prepared from twenty 10-cm plates according to the procedures previously described (30Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA. 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 31Hasegawa S.L. Sloan J.H. Reith W. Mach B. Boss J.M.

DNA binding reactions were performed in a solution containing 4 μg of nuclear extract, 0.6 μg of poly(dI·dC):poly(dI·dC), 250 ng of denatured sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.12 mm EDTA, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 12 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm MgCl2 for 30 min on ice. The sequence of the coding strand of MCP-1 GC box specific probe used in the EMSAs was 5′-GCACCCTGCCTGACTCCACCCCCCTGGCTTACAA. Competitor DNA for consensus Sp1 and AP-1 sites were 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAG and 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Valencia, CA), respectively, where the underlined bases represent the consensus sites. Nonspecific DNA competitor encoded Site A of theMCP-1 gene: 5′-AGAACTGCTTGGCTGCAGGCCCAGCATCTGGAGCTCACATT. Sp1 and Sp3 antibody supershift assays were carried out by adding 1 μl of antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to the reaction mixture 5 min prior to the addition of the labeled probe. Samples were separated by electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel (49:1::acrylamide:bis) at 4 °C with recirculating buffer and analyzed by autoradiography. Mechanistic studies of MCP-1 gene in human, mouse, and rat demonstrated that MCP-1 expression is transcriptionally regulated through a distal regulatory region and a proximal regulatory region (11Ping D.

Taubman M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24932-24938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Systematic analysis of the distal regulatory region identified an NF-κB-dependent enhancer that was required for TNF induction of the MCP-1 gene in human and mouse cells (23Ping D. Boekhoudt G.H. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar, 34Ueda A. Ishigatsubo Y. Okubo T. Yoshimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31092-31099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Although the distal element could enhance the activity of a heterologous promoter in response to TNF, the proximal GC box was essential for activity in the context of theMCP-1 gene (23Ping D. Boekhoudt G.H. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, inhibitors of translation induced MCP-1 RNA expression through a mechanism that involved the proximal but not the distal-regulatory elements (11Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, it appeared as if the proximal region might be capable of independent activity. Previous analysis of the PDGF-BB induction of theMCP-1 gene suggested that the distal regulatory region was required for PDGF-BB mediated induction (25Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Hwang G.Y. Wrentmore A.L. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17417-17424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Lam K.K. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 315-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because PDGF-BB signals through a pathway distinct from TNF (35Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 36Heldin C.-H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: 79-113PubMed Google Scholar), experiments were conducted to determine whether each of these cytokines used the samecis-acting control elements to induce the expression of theMCP-1 gene. To compare the induction of MCP-1mRNA by TNF to that by PDGF-BB, murine BALB/3T3 fibroblasts were treated with either cytokine for 4 h. RNA was isolated and probed for the expression of the MCP-1 and GAPDH genes using a Northern blot assay. Both PDGF-BB and TNF were able to stimulate the induction of the MCP-1 gene in BALB/3T3 cells by 14- and 20-fold over untreated cells, respectively (Fig.1 A). To map PDGF-BB-inducible elements and compare them to those used during TNF induction, IVGF of the proximal (Fig. 1 B) and distal (Fig. 1 C) regulatory regions in both treated and untreated control cells was carried out. IVGF provides a snapshot of sites that are protected or altered in vivo from dimethylsulfate attack during the short treatment time (2 min). In vivo footprints and hypersensitive sites have been shown to correspond to sites of transcription factor occupancy (11Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 37Mueller P.R. Wold B.

In vitroprepared DNA was processed to provide a no protein/control pattern (Fig. 1, B and C, lane V). Following PDGF-BB (1 h) or TNF (30 min) treatment, full occupancy of the proximal region site B and the GC box occurred (Fig. 1 B). In the distal regulatory region, site A was fully occupied in control cells and was unchanged during the PDGF-BB or TNF treatment. The occupancy of site A was previously shown to be unaltered during TNF treatment (11Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and most likely does not change during induction of MCP-1under any conditions. In contrast to TNF-treated cells, no occupancy was detected in or around the sequences that encode the two NF-κB binding sites in cells treated with PDGF-BB. These data suggest that 1) the distal κB elements play no role in PDGF-BB induction and 2) the proximal regulatory region alone may contain elements required for PDGF-BB regulation. TRA was shown previously to inhibit induction of MCP-1 in osteoblasts (19Hanazawa S. Takeshita A. Kitano S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21379-21384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether this effect was through the proximal or distal region, cells were pretreated with TRA and then with TNF or PDGF-BB and analyzed for expression of MCP-1 by Northern blot (Fig. 1 A). Changes influenced by TRA in thein vivo occupancy of the MCP-1 regulatory regions were monitored by IVGF (Fig. 1, B and C). TRA treatment had no effect on the basal level of MCP-1 and did not affect the occupancy of site A in the distal region. TRA only slightly inhibited TNF-induced MCP-1 expression, reducing the induction from 20- to 17-fold (Fig. 1 A). However, TRA did inhibit the PDGF-BB-induced induction of MCP-1 mRNA by almost 50% (Fig. 1 A). A concomitant block in the PDGF-BB-induced occupancy of the proximal GC box and site B (Fig. 1, B and C) was observed, suggesting that TRA has a direct effect on the ability of PDGF-BB-activated transcription factors to assemble on the MCP-1 proximal promoter. A slight decrease in the delineation of the TNF-induced footprint in the proximal region was also observed in the TNF/TRA-treated samples (Fig.1 B, lane 3). Thus, it appears as if TNF induction can bypass the TRA inhibition of the assembly of the proximal regulatory region. It is possible that the TNF activation of NF-κB and assembly of the distal regulatory region may allow stable complexes to form between proximal and distal regulatory region factors that make the proximal region resistant to the effects of TRA action. Previous regulatory region analyses and in vitrogel shift assays suggested that a region encompassing the distal regulatory sequences used two NF-κB sites and another factor to regulate PDGF-BB induction of MCP-1 in murine fibroblasts (25Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Hwang G.Y. Wrentmore A.L. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17417-17424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Lam K.K. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 315-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because these results are in conflict with the data presented above, experiments were carried out to assess the involvement of the major NF-κB transcription factor proteins, p50 and p65, in PDGF-BB induction of MCP-1. Murine embryonic fibroblasts derived from p50 and p65 homozygous knockout animals were assessed for their ability to induce MCP-1 in response to PDGF-BB. Northern blot analysis showed that MCP-1 was induced by PDGF-BB equally well in p50−/− and p65−/− cells (Fig. 2 A). PDGF-BB induction in these cells is comparable with that seen in BALB/3T3 cells and NIH3T3 cells. Our previous analysis of these cell lines showed that p65 but not p50 was necessary for TNF induction of MCP-1 (23Ping D. Boekhoudt G.H. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether induction of cells by PDGF resulted in NF-κB binding to the distal regulatory region, an EMSA was performed using the κB-2 sequence as a probe (Fig. 2 B). Extracts from BALB/3T3 cells treated with TNF showed strong induction of NF-κB binding to this site, whereas PDGF treatment shows only weak binding of a different set of complexes, none of which are supershifted by an anti-NF-κB p65 specific antiserum. These results are consistent with the IVGF data presented in Fig. 1 and demonstrate that the predominant cellular NF-κB subunits are not required for PDGF-BB induction ofMCP-1. These data indicate that the proximal regulatory region responds to PDGF-BB signaling in a manner that is independent of NF-κB and the distal regulatory region. To determine whether the proximal region could respond to PDGF-BB independently of the distal sequences, a series of transfections were carried out using plasmids containing just the proximal region or the distal and proximal sequences combined (Fig. 3). The results of these experiments showed that constructions containing either the proximal regulatory region alone or both the proximal and distal regulatory regions w"

These chimeras harbored a cognate domain corresponding to transmembrane regions 6 and 7 as well as the third extracellular loop (EL3) and cytoplasmic tail, a domain referred herein to as the terminal receptor locus (TRL). A chimeric D1A receptor harboring the D1B-TRL (chimera 1) displays an increased affinity for dopamine that is indistinguishable from the wild-type D1B receptor. Likewise, a chimeric D1B receptor containing the D1A-TRL cassette (chimera 2) binds dopamine with a reduced affinity that is highly reminiscent of the dopamine affinity for the wild-type D1A receptor. Furthermore, we show that the agonist independent activity of chimera 1 is identical to the wild-type D1B receptor whereas the chimera 2 displays a low agonist independent activity that is indistinguishable from the wild-type D1A receptor. Dopamine potencies for the wild-type D1A and D1B receptor were recapitulated in cells expressing the chimera 2 or chimera 1, respectively. However, the differences observed in agonist-mediated maximal activation of adenylyl cyclase elicited by the D1A and D1B receptors remain unchanged in cells expressing the chimeric receptors. To gain further mechanistic insights into the structural determinants of the TRL involved in the activation properties of the D1 receptor subtypes, we have engineered two additional chimeric D1 receptors that contain the EL3 region of their respective cognate wild-type counterparts (hD1A-EL3B and hD1B-EL3A). In marked contrast to chimera 1 and 2, dopamine affinity and constitutive activation were partially modulated by the exchange of the EL3. Meanwhile, hD1A-EL3B and hD1B-EL3A mutant receptors display a full switch in the agonist-mediated maximal activation, which is reminiscent of their cognate wild-type counterparts. Overall, our studies suggest a fundamental role for the TRL in shaping the intramolecular interactions implicated in the constitutive activation and coupling properties of the dopamine D1 receptor subtypes.

G protein-coupled receptor terminal receptor locus transmembrane third extracellular loop human embryonic kidney 293 cells The classical paradigm for G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)1 activation is described by the binding of an agonist to an inactive receptor state (R). This process leads to the formation of an active receptor state (R*) which interacts with heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) to initiate a variety of intracellular signaling events. In recent years, however, mutagenesis studies have led to a notion asserting that GPCRs exist in an equilibrium between two interchangeable conformational states, R and R* (1Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol.

In the absence of ligand (agonist), GPCRs are predominantly maintained in an inactive R state by intramolecular constraints that prohibit the interaction with G proteins. These intramolecular constraints are released upon agonist binding or by mutations. Indeed, mutations in the carboxyl end of the third cytoplasmic loop of GPCRs can result in mutant receptors displaying high levels of agonist independent activity or constitutive activation (1Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Cotecchia S. Exum S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16483-16487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutively active GPCRs have a greater propensity to adopt an R* state in the absence of agonists (1Samama P.

Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Most importantly, naturally occurring activating mutations in GPCRs have been shown to underlie various pathological conditions (2Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 7Vassart G. Horm. Res. 1997; 48: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have shown that differences in the degree of constitutive activation may underlie the basis for GPCR multiplicity recognizing the same natural ligand (8Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hasegawa H. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1857-1860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For instance, the dopaminergic D1 receptor subtypes have been demonstrated to display different levels of agonist-independent activity (8Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Charpentier S. Jarvie K.R. Severynse D.M. Caron M.G. Tiberi M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2778-2787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Dopamine elicits its broad physiological effects through the interaction with specific classes of GPCRs: the D1-like and D2-like receptors (12Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2773) Google Scholar). In mammals, the dopaminergic D1-like receptors are divided into two subtypes referred to as D1A (or D1) and D1B (or D5), respectively (12Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2773) Google Scholar). The D1A and D1B receptor subtypes couple to the activation of adenylyl cyclase. The D1B receptor distinguishes itself from the D1A subtype by a higher constitutive activity (agonist-independent activity), an increased affinity and potency for agonists as well as a lower affinity for antagonist drugs (8Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These functional characteristics of the D1B receptor are highly reminiscent of those reported for constitutively active mutant GPCRs (2Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The molecular basis underlying the differences in the ligand binding and activation properties between the D1A and D1B receptor are little understood. In a recent study, we have described that replacement of a variant amino acid found in the carboxyl end of the third cytoplasmic loop of the D1A by the one found in the D1B receptor can induce partially the constitutive activation of the D1A receptor (10Charpentier S. Jarvie K.R. Severynse D.M. Caron M.G. Tiberi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28071-28076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In an opposite fashion, a mutant D1B receptor harboring the variant D1A amino acid exhibits a decreased level of constitutive activity as well as the binding and coupling properties similar to those of the wild-type D1A receptor (10Charpentier S. Jarvie K.R. Severynse D.M. Caron M.G. Tiberi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28071-28076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These mutant receptors display no modification in their ability to interact with antagonists. Overall, these results suggest that the carboxyl end of the third cytoplasmic loop plays a role in constraining the D1A and D1B receptor into their inactive and active allosteric states, respectively. However, the results also indicate that the molecular properties of these two D1 receptor subtypes can only be explained partially by amino acid sequences of the carboxyl end of the third cytoplasmic loop. Therefore, it is likely that other structural determinants within these receptors exist to define the intramolecular interactions responsible for the distinct features of the D1A and D1B receptors. Indeed, studies have shown that mutations occurring in transmembrane regions, extracellular loops, or the cytoplasmic tail of GPCRs can lead to a constitutive activation (2Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 9Hasegawa H. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Biol.

In the present study, we use a chimeric receptor approach (Fig. 1) to delineate further the potential structural determinants that underlie the molecular properties of the human D1A and D1B receptors. We report that chimeric D1A/D1B receptors harboring the terminal receptor locus (TRL) cassette which includes the transmembrane region (TM) 6 and 7, the third extracellular loop (EL3), and the cytoplasmic tail display a constitutive activity, dopamine affinity, and potency that are indistinguishable from their respective cognate wild-type receptors. Furthermore, studies with chimeric D1A/D1B receptors containing only the EL3 region suggest an important role for this region in the agonist-mediated maximal activation (intrinsic efficacy) of the D1 receptor subtypes. The present study identifies an important structural domain regulating the activation process of the D1A and D1B receptor but demonstrates also that the molecular determinants involved in the GPCR activation properties (constitutive activation, agonist potency, and intrinsic efficacy) can be separated. N-[methyl-3H]SCH23390 (84 Ci/mmol), [3H]adenine (24 Ci/mmol), and [14C]cAMP (275 mCi/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Dopamine, deschloro-SCH23390 (SCH23982), flupentixol, and (+)-butaclamol were purchased from Research Biochemicals International. 1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine was obtained from Sigma. To construct the chimeric receptors, we took advantage of the high degree of nucleotide identity between the human D1A and D1B receptor (17Jarvie R.K. Caron M.G. Adv. Neurol. 1993; 60: 325-333PubMed Google Scholar). Using the conserved BclI restriction site located within the nucleotide sequence coding for the TM6, we constructed two chimeric D1A and D1B receptors harboring the TRL cassette of their respective cognate wild-type counterparts (Fig. 1). The TRL cassette includes sequences coding for the TM6 and TM7 as well as the EL3 and carboxyl cytoplasmic tail. Moreover, the EL3 region of the D1A and D1B receptor was exchanged to create two additional chimeric receptors. The swapping of the EL3 region was done by gene splicing using a polymerase chain reaction-based overlap extension approach. The chimeric constructs were subcloned in pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene) and the identity of the chimeras confirmed by dideoxy sequencing using Sequenase version 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Expression constructs for the wild-type and chimeric D1A and D1B receptors were engineered into the expression vector pCMV5. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HEK293 cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (100 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes (2.5 × 106cells/dish) and transiently transfected with 0.25–5 μg of DNA/dish using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation procedure as described (18Didsbury J.R. Uhing R.J. Tomhave E. Gerard C. Gerard N. Snyderman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11564-11568Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). After an overnight incubation with the DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate, HEK293 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, reseeded in 150-mm dishes and grown for an additional 36–40 h. Transfected HEK293 cells were then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA), and centrifuged twice at 40,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer using a Brinkmann Polytron (17,000 r.p.m. for 15 s). The crude membranes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until used. Frozen membranes were thawed on ice and resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EDTA) using a Brinkmann Polytron. Binding assays were performed with 100 μl of membranes in a total volume of 500 μl using N-[methyl-3H]SCH23390 as radioligand. Saturation studies were done using concentrations ofN-[methyl-3H]SCH23390 ranging from 0.01 to 6 nm. Nonspecific binding was delineated using 10 μm flupentixol. For competition studies, membranes were incubated with a constant concentration ofN-[methyl-3H]SCH23390 (∼0.6 nm) and increasing concentrations of competing ligand. Competition studies using dopamine were done in the presence of 0.1 mm ascorbic acid. Binding assays were incubated for 90 min at room temperature and terminated using rapid filtration through glass fiber filters (GF/C, Whatman). The filters were washed three times with 5 ml of cold washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl) and the bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman Counter, LS1701). Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad assay kit with bovine serum albumin as standard. To determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and binding capacity (R) values, binding isotherms were analyzed using the nonlinear curve-fitting program LIGAND (19Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity by wild-type and chimeric D1A and D1B receptors was assessed using a whole cell cAMP assay as described previously (8Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following overnight incubation with the DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate, HEK293 cells were reseeded in 6- or 12-well dishes. The next day, HEK293 cells were cultured in fresh minimal essential medium containing 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, gentamicin (100 μg/ml), and [3H]adenine (2 μCi/ml; 24 Ci/mmol) for 18–24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The labeling medium was then removed and HEK293 cells incubated in 20 mm HEPES-buffered minimal essential medium containing 1 mm1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine in the presence or absence of dopamine for 30 min at 37 °C (in the presence of 0.1 mm ascorbic acid). At the end of the incubation period, the medium was aspirated, and each well filled with 1 ml of lysis solution containing 2.5% (v/v) perchloric acid, 1 mm cAMP, and [14C]cAMP (2.5–5 nCi, ∼5,000–10,000 cpm) for 20–30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were then transferred to tubes containing 0.1 ml of 4.2m KOH (neutralizing solution), and precipitates were sedimented by a low-speed centrifugation (1,500 rpm) at 4 °C. The amount of intracellular [3H]cAMP was determined from supernatants purified by sequential chromatography using Dowex and alumina columns as described before (20Johnson R.A. Salomon Y. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The amount of [3H]cAMP (CA) over the total amount of intracellular [3H]adenine (TU) was calculated to determine the relative adenylyl cyclase activity (CA/TU). Dose-response curves to dopamine were analyzed by a four-parameter logistic equation using ALLFIT (21DeLéan A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor expression was determined using a saturating concentration (∼6 nm) ofN-[methyl-3H]SCH23390. Equilibrium dissociation binding constants (Kd) are expressed using the geometric mean ± S.E. All other data are reported as arithmetic means ± S.E. All statistical tests used in the present study have been described elsewhere (22Sokal R.R. Rohlf F.J. Biometry. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1981Google Scholar, 23Motulsky H. Intuitive Biostatistics. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). Prior to the statistical treatment of data, the homoscedasticity (homogeneity of variances) was assessed using either the Bartlett or Hartley tests. Then, one-sample t test and analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) were performed to determine the statistical significance of the data. To establish the statistical significance of differences between pairs of means, a posteriori comparisons were performed using either the Bonferroni test (nonheterogeneity of variances) or the Games and Howell method (heterogeneity of variances). The level of significance was established at p < 0.05. The binding affinities (Kd values) of the radioligandN-[methyl-3H]SCH23390 for wild-type and chimeric human D1 receptors obtained using saturation studies are summarized in Table I. Results indicate that the chimeric receptors retain their ability to bindN-[methyl-3H]SCH23390 with high affinity. In addition, no statistical differences between the binding capacities of wild-type and chimeric receptors were detected (8–10 pmol/mg of protein). These results suggest that swapping the TRL cassette between the two receptors does not alter significantly the protein folding necessary for appropriate cell surface expression.Table IDissociation constant (Kd) and binding capacity (R) values for binding of [N-[methyl-3 H]-SCH23390 to wild-type and chimeric receptorsKd and R values are expressed as geometric and arithmetic means, respectively. Means are from six to eight experiments done in duplicate determinations. Open table in a new tab Kd and R values are expressed as geometric and arithmetic means, respectively. Means are from six to eight experiments done in duplicate determinations. Competition studies were performed to determine whether the TRL contains the underlying structural requirements involved in the dopamine binding to wild-type human D1A and D1B receptors. Dopamine exhibits a higher affinity for the D1B subtype in comparison with the D1A receptor (Table II) as previously reported (8Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Charpentier S. Jarvie K.R. Severynse D.M. Caron M.G. Tiberi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28071-28076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The chimera 1 displays an affinity for dopamine which is highly reminiscent of the binding affinity observed for the wild-type D1B receptor (Table II). In an opposite fashion, the chimera 2 binds dopamine with an affinity very similar to the one measured for the wild-type D1A receptor (Table II). To strengthen further the dominant role the TRL cassette plays in determining the D1A and D1B receptor conformations responsible for the distinct dopamine binding affinity, we calculated the free binding energy using the relation ΔG = −RT ln (1/Kd) (24Catterall W.A. Science. 1989; 243: 236-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 2 A, the calculated net free energy difference relative to the dopamine binding energy for the wild-type D1A receptor suggests that chimera 1 displays a reduction in the binding energy preference for dopamine. This reduction is statistically different from the wild-type D1A receptor but indistinguishable from the wild-type D1B receptor. Meanwhile, the binding energy preference of chimera 2 for dopamine is not statistically different from the wild-type D1A receptor. In addition, the binding energy preference of chimera 2 for dopamine exhibits an increase that is statistically different from the wild-type D1B and chimera 1 (Fig. 2 A).Table IIDissociation constants (Kd) for binding of dopaminergic ligands to wild-type and chimeric receptorsKd values are expressed as geometric mean ± S.E. of 15–18 experiments done in duplicate determinations.

DA, dopamine; FLU, flupentixol; BUTA, (+)-butaclamol; SCH, SCH23982. Previous studies have shown that antagonists or antipsychotic drugs bind with a lower affinity to the D1B receptor in comparison with the D1A receptor (8Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Charpentier S. Jarvie K.R. Severynse D.M. Caron M.G. Tiberi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28071-28076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We tested the binding affinity of flupentixol and (+)-butaclamol, two antipsychotic drugs having a distinct chemical structure and displaying inverse agonism at the D1A and D1B receptors (8Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Milligan G. Bond R.A. Lee M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 10-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). As shown in Table II, both drugs have lower affinity for the wild-type D1B receptor as reported before (8Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding affinities of flupentixol for the chimera 1 and 2 were not statistically different from the wild-type D1A and D1B receptors, respectively (Table II, Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, the small fold difference in the flupentixol affinity (∼1.5-fold) observed between the wild-type D1 receptors remains unchanged with the exchange of the TRL cassette. In striking contrast to flupentixol, (+)-butaclamol displays a greater fold difference in the binding affinity (∼5-fold) between the two D1 receptor subtypes (Table II). As shown in Fig. 2 C, the wild-type D1B receptor has an increased binding energy preference for (+)-butaclamol in comparison with the wild-type D1A receptor. The chimera 1 binds (+)-butaclamol with an affinity which is not statistically different from the wild-type D1A receptor (Table II, Fig.2 C). However, our binding data indicate that chimera 2 has an increased affinity for (+)-butaclamol (Table II, Fig.2 C). Indeed, the net binding energy preference for (+)-butaclamol of the chimera 2 is decreased in comparison with the wild-type D1B receptor but remains statistically different from the wild-type D1A subtype. We then studied the binding properties of the benzazepine SCH23982 which is structurally different from both flupentixol and (+)-butaclamol. This benzazepine has been described as a classical antagonist that binds preferentially to D1-like receptors (26Niznik H.B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1987; 54: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the present study, SCH23982 exhibits lower affinity for the wild-type D1B subtype (Table II) which correlates with a significant increase in the binding energy preference while contrasted to the wild-type D1A receptor (Fig. 2 D). Surprisingly, chimera 1 and 2 bind to SCH23982 with an increased affinity that is statistically significant in comparison with the wild-type D1A or D1B receptor (Table II, Fig.2 D). This trend is also observed using the radiolabeled benzazepine analogN-[methyl-3H]SCH23390 (Table I). Previous studies have shown that the D1B receptor shares the functional features of constitutively activated mutant GPCRs (8Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Charpentier S. Jarvie K.R. Severynse D.M. Caron M.G. Tiberi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28071-28076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The role of the TRL cassette in the agonist-independent activation of adenylyl cyclase by wild-type and chimeric receptors was assessed using a whole cell cAMP assay. The results are summarized in Fig. 3. In brief, the D1B receptor has a 3.5-fold higher agonist independent activity than the D1A receptor as shown previously (8Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Charpentier S. Jarvie K.R. Severynse D.M. Caron M.G. Tiberi M. J. Biol.

Interestingly, chimera 1 shows an increase in its constitutive activation that is statistically different from the wild-type D1A but indistinguishable from the wild-type D1B receptor (Fig. 3). In striking contrast, chimera 2 exhibits a significant decrease of its agonist independent activity when compared with the wild-type D1B receptor (Fig. 3). In fact, the constitutive activation level of chimera 2 is highly reminiscent of the one measured for the wild-type D1A receptor. Differences in the agonist-mediated coupling properties of the D1A and D1B receptors have been described previously (8Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the TRL cassette delineates the structural requirements for the dopamine potency and intrinsic efficacy, dose-response curves were done in HEK293 cells transfected with the wild-type and chimeric receptors. As depicted in Fig.4 A, the dopamine potency is about 10-fold superior at the wild-type D1B receptor in comparison with the wild-type D1A, a value in agreement with previous studies (8Tiberi M.

Chimera 1 exhibits an increase in dopamine potency as compared with its wild-type D1A counterpart (Fig. 4 A). The potency of dopamine at the chimera 1 is not statistically different from the wild-type D1B receptor. Alternatively, chimera 2 displays a loss of dopamine potency that is significantly different from the wild-type D1A and D1B receptor (Fig. 4 A). Fig. 4 B shows that the maximal stimulation elicited by the wild-type D1A receptor is significantly higher than the wild-type D1B receptors as described before (8Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, chimera 1 and 2 elicited a maximal activation of adenylyl cyclase that is identical to"

RPMS12reporter gene expression in cultured human cells supports the idea that the gene product is mitochondrial and is localized to the inner membrane. Human cells contain at least four structurally distinctRPMS12 mRNAs that differ in their 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) as a result of alternate splicing and of 5′ end heterogeneity. All of them encode the same polypeptide. The full 5′-UTR contains two types of sequence element implicated elsewhere in translational regulation as follows: a short upstream open reading frame and an oligopyrimidine tract similar to that found at the 5′ end of mRNAs encoding other growth-regulated proteins, including those of cytosolic ribosomes. The fully spliced (short) mRNA is the predominant form in all cell types studied and is translationally down-regulated in cultured cells in response to serum starvation, even though it lacks both of the putative translational regulatory elements. By contrast, other splice variants containing one or both of these elements are not translationally regulated by growth status but are translated poorly in both growing and non-growing cells. Reporter analysis identified a 26-nucleotide tract of the 5′-UTR of the short mRNA that is essential for translational down-regulation in growth-inhibited cells. Such experiments also confirmed that the 5′-UTR of the longer mRNA variants contains negative regulatory elements for translation. Tissue representation of RPMS12 mRNA is highly variable, following a typical mitochondrial pattern, but the relative levels of the different splice variants are similar in different tissues. These findings indicate a complex, multilevel regulation of RPMS12 gene expression in response to signals mediating growth, tissue specialization, and probably metabolic needs.

Attardi G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 4: 289-333Google Scholar). Expression of these genes depends upon a dedicated apparatus of transcription, RNA processing, and translation, mainly encoded by nuclear genes. Typically these exhibit clear eubacterial affinities compared with their counterparts that specify cytosolic or nuclear isologues.Genes encoding components of the apparatus of mitochondrial gene expression are regulated in a variety of ways. For example, the mRNA for the mitochondrial (mt)1 transcription factor-A is present at different levels in different tissues (2Larsson N.G. Garman J.D. Oldfors A. Barsh G.S. Clayton D.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and its expression is in turn regulated by transcription factors of the nuclear respiratory factor group (3Scarpulla R.C. J. Bioenerget. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Despite examples such as this, plus some knowledge obtained from studies in yeast (4Graack H.R. Wittmann-Liebold B. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 433-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), rather little is known of how genes for the apparatus of mitochondrial gene expression are regulated in mammalian cells. In principle this may have both developmental and physiological aspects and would be expected to involve regulation at different levels in the pathway of gene expression.We have set out to study a gene encoding a key mitochondrial ribosomal protein, the homologue of Escherichia coli ribosomal protein S12 (rps12). Tentative identification of the single copy gene designated RPMS12 (5Shah Z.H. O'Dell K. Miller S.C.M. An X. Jacobs H.T. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 204: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Shah Z.H. Migliosi V. Miller S.C.M. Wang A. Friedman T.B. Jacobs H.T. Genomics. 1998; 48: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) as encoding the mitochondrial isologue of rps12 in humans was based on phylogenetic analysis of the encoded polypeptide, which groups it with homologues found in eubacteria and plant/protistan organelles, but correspondingly distant from the identified cytosolic homologue in yeast (Rps28p). Moreover, compared with the Rps12 proteins of eubacteria, or those encoded by organelle DNAs, the human gene product shows an N-terminal extension exhibiting features similar to those of mitochondrial targeting peptides. However, formal proof that the RPMS12 gene product is mitochondrially localized is lacking. We therefore set out initially, using a reporter gene approach, to verify thatRPMS12 encodes a mitochondrial protein.Ribosomal protein genes are regulated in unusual ways, perhaps not surprisingly, given their central importance in biosynthesis. In eubacteria and archaea, operons containing ribosomal protein genes are typically autoregulated by one of the proteins they encode (7Zengel J.M. Lindahl L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 47: 331-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The 11 gene S10 operon of E. coli, for example, is regulated by ribosomal protein L4 binding to the S10 leader and simultaneously repressing translation and also promoting transcriptional attenuation (8Freedman L.P. Zengel J.M. Archer R.H. Lindahl L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6516-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In yeast, ribosomal protein expression does not appear to be controlled by such a translational feedback mechanism (9Tsay Y.F. Thompson J.R. Rotenberg M.O. Larkin J.C. Woolford J.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 664-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), although a distinct type of post-transcriptional regulation in which Rps14p binds to its own pre-mRNA has been documented (10Fewell S.W. Woolford Jr., J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 826-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In vertebrate cells, cytosolic ribosomal protein mRNAs are translationally regulated in response to growth status (Ref. 4Graack H.R. Wittmann-Liebold B. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 433-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar and references therein). Such regulation has been demonstrated in response to a number of physiological stimuli, such as serum starvation (11Geyer P.K. Meyuhas O. Perry R.P. Johnson L.F. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3822-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In all these cases the fraction of ribosomal protein mRNA associated with polysomes varies according to cellular need, a higher proportion being loaded on polysomes (translationally active state) in rapidly growing cells as opposed to resting cells, in which most of it is stored in the subpolysomal or mRNP fraction (translationally inactive state, Ref.19Meyuhas O. Biberman Y. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Amaldi F. Krieg P.K. A Laboratory Guide to RNA: Isolation, Analysis and Synthesis. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1996: 65-81Google Scholar). In all cases so far analyzed, a 5′-UTR containing a terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) tract plays a critical role in the translational control of such genes (20Amaldi F. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1997; 18: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Meyuhas O. Avni D. Shama S. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 363-388Google Scholar). This sequence element is believed to act via specific interactions with one or more regulatory proteins (13Loreni F.

It is probable that, like their cytosolic counterparts, mitochondrial ribosomal protein genes are regulated in respect to cellular growth, although other types of regulation are also to be expected, for example in response to cellular bioenergetic state, the availability of different kinds of substrate and cell differentiation. Tissues such as heart, skeletal muscle, or pancreas, which are highly dependent on mitochondrial ATP synthesis or in which rapid response of the bioenergy-generating system is needed, may be predicted to exhibit specific modes of regulation of the mitochondrial translational apparatus. The mRNA for one mitochondrial ribosomal protein (MRPL12) is known to be regulated in mouse cells by growth induction but at the transcriptional rather than the translational level (25Marty L. Fort P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11468-11476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Marty L. Taviaux S. Fort P. Genomics. 1997; 41: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Sequence analysis of a full-length or nearly full-length cDNA derived from the human RPMS12 gene (5Shah Z.H. O'Dell K. Miller S.C.M. An X. Jacobs H.T. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 204: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) revealed a long (>300 nt) 5′-UTR that contains two features strongly suggestive of translational regulation. A short, upstream open reading frame (uORF), potentially encoding the pentapeptide MRACG, is located near the middle of the 5′-UTR. Such uORFs have been demonstrated to play a role in translational regulation of many genes in both fungi and vertebrates (27Cao J.H. Geballe A.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1030-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Imataka H. Nakayama K. Yasumoto K. Mizuno A. Fujii-kuriyama Y. Hayami M. J. Biol.

Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1369-1374PubMed Google Scholar). They are believed to act by facilitating futile ribosome initiation in competition with the real AUG start site and also appear to regulate mRNA stability (30Oliveira C.C. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8936-8943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 34Linz B. Koloteva N. Vasilescu S. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9131-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In some cases the short, encoded peptide also interferes directly with ribosome function (35Lovett P.S. Rogers E.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 366-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′-UTR of the human RPMS12 mRNA furthermore contains a 16-nt oligopyrimidine (oligo(Y)) tract located about 40 nt upstream of the AUG start codon. Although its placement differs from that seen in “classical” TOP mRNAs, the presence of this sequence element and of the uORF prompted us to investigate the translational behavior of the mRNA.In this paper we provide evidence, via a reporter gene approach, supporting the idea that the RPMS12 gene does indeed encode a mitochondrially targeted protein. Transcript analysis via a combination of cyberscreening, Northern blots, and RT-PCR assays reveals a complex set of transcripts generated by alternate splicing within the 5′-UTR as well as 5′ end heterogeneity. Surprisingly, the fully spliced mRNA, which completely lacks the putative elements of translational control (oligo(Y) tract and uORF), is translationally regulated in cultured cells according to growth status, whereas the other mRNA variants are not. The tissue representation of all splice variants follows a typical “mitochondrial” pattern, but one transcript found in cultured cells is absent from solid tissues. Our findings indicate a complex multilevel regulation of the expression of a mitochondrial ribosomal protein gene in response to various physiological and developmental stimuli.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureHEK293-EBNA cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, HyClone), 10% fetal calf serum, supplemented with 50 μg/ml uridine, 1 mm glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate plus 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HeLa, HEK293, and Xenopus kidney B3.2 cultured cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), 10% fetal calf serum, containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin and 2 mm glutamine. To induce a “downshift” to serum starvation conditions, cells were rinsed twice with PBS and detached with a limited amount of trypsin. After resuspension in PBS to dilute the trypsin, cells were centrifuged at 2000 ×gmax for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in serum-free medium, and incubated at 37 °C for a further 4 h.DNA Transfection of Cultured CellsCells were grown to 80% confluence on 100-mm plates and transfected in 6 ml of Opti-MEM serum-free medium (HyClone) with 10 μg of plasmid DNA plus 40 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), following the manufacturer's recommendations. After 5 h of incubation 6 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HyClone) containing 20% fetal calf serum was added. For serum starvation conditions no serum was present in this added medium. Cells were harvested 24 h after the start of transfection. Smaller scale transfections on 35-mm plates used 1 μg of plasmid DNA plus 10 μl of LipofectAMINE.Subcellular FractionationCytoplasmic extracts for Western analysis were prepared from transfected HEK293-EBNA cells grown on 35-mm plates, collected by pipetting up and down in 500 μl of PBS, and centrifugation at 12,000 × gmax for 5 min. The cell pellet was vortexed and lysed in 50 μl of PBS containing 1.5% (w/v) lauryl maltoside and 2.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 16,000 × gmax for 5 min at 4 °C. Ten μl of the supernatant was used immediately for SDS-PAGE. Finer subcellular fractionation of transfected cells was carried out using a standard procedure for mitochondrial isolation (Ref. 36Hauswirth W.W. Lim L.O. Turner G. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 176-177Google Scholar, adapted from Ref. 37Tapper D.P. Van Etten R.A. Clayton D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 97: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Essentially, transfected cells from each 100-mm plate were washed once with PBS, dislodged from the plate by pipetting up and down in 1.3 ml of ice-cold PBS, and centrifuged at 300 ×gmax for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended by gentle pipetting in 10 volumes of ice-cold 0.133m NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mmNa2HPO4, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and centrifuged again at 300 × gmax for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended by pipetting up and down in 500 μl of ice-cold 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, kept on ice for 15 min, and then homogenized in a glass homogenizer with 18–25 strokes of a tight fitting pestle. Disruption of the cells was monitored by microscopy. An equal volume of ice-cold 0.68 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was added, and nuclei and cell debris were pelleted by two sequential centrifugations at 1,200 × gmax for 10 min at 4 °C. The combined pellets (“nuclear fraction”) were washed once with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, resuspended in a final total volume of 300 μl of ice-cold PBS, and repeatedly passed through a syringe needle to shear chromatin. Mitochondria from the post-nuclear supernatants of four 100-mm plates of transfected cells were recovered by centrifugation at 16,000 × gmax for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant from this step was saved as the cytosol fraction. Mitochondria were washed once with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS and finally resuspended by gentle pipetting in 160 μl of ice-cold PBS. From this suspension 20 μl was saved as the mitochondrial fraction, the remainder being further processed to yield various submitochondrial fractions, essentially as described in Ref. 38Ragan C.I. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmar V.M. Lowe P.N. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria, A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 80-81Google Scholar. Briefly, the mitochondrial suspension was adjusted to 350 μl with ice-cold PBS, and an equal volume of ice-cold digitonin solution (4 mg/ml in PBS) was added. The suspension was kept on ice for 5 min, after which 700 μl of ice-cold PBS was added, and mitoplasts were recovered by centrifugation at 16,000 × gmax for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 144,000 ×gmax for 50 min at 5 °C to separate inter-membrane space (supernatant) and outer membrane (pellet) fractions. The outer membrane fraction was resuspended in 20 μl of ice-cold PBS. Mitoplasts were resuspended in 140 μl of ice-cold PBS, and 20 μl was saved as the mitoplast fraction. The remainder was sonicated in a total volume of 300 μl on ice, 30 times for 2 s with 30-s intervals, using a Vibracell High Intensity Ultrasonic Processor (Sonics & Materials, Inc.), fitted with the manufacturer's micro-tip. The suspension was then ultracentrifuged at 144,000 ×gmax for 50 min at 5 °C to separate matrix (supernatant) and inner membrane (pellet) fractions. The matrix fraction was concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and resuspended in 10 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.47-18.75Google Scholar). 2m Tris was added until the yellow color changed to blue, and the volume was adjusted to 20 μl with PBS. The inner membrane fraction was gently resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold PBS. Fractions were stored on ice and generally used for SDS-PAGE the same day (10 μl from each of the above fractions). Samples were stored as pellets (nuclei, mitochondria, mitoplasts, outer and inner membrane) or in suspension (cytosol, matrix) at −80 °C. Protease resistance of imported mitochondrial proteins was verified by incubating mitochondrial suspensions in minimal volumes of PBS for 10 min at room temperature either without any further additions, with 50 μg/ml trypsin (Fluka), or with 0.05% lauryl maltoside plus 50 μg/ml trypsin. For preparing polysomes, the procedure for cell lysis, sucrose gradient sedimentation, and analysis of the polysome/subpolysome distribution of mRNAs was essentially that described by Meyuhaset al. (19Meyuhas O. Biberman Y. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Amaldi F. Krieg P.K. A Laboratory Guide to RNA: Isolation, Analysis and Synthesis. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1996: 65-81Google Scholar). Cells were directly lysed on the plate with 300 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-1000, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 36 units/ml RNase inhibitor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 1 mm dithiothreitol) and transferred to an Eppendorf tube. After 5 min incubation on ice with occasional vortexing, the lysate was centrifuged at 6,000 ×gmax for 8 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C for later analysis or immediately sedimented in a 5–70% (w/v) sucrose gradient in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Fractions, collected while monitoring the optical density at 254 nm, were ethanol-precipitated overnight at −20 °C.Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western BlottingSDS-PAGE used 12% polyacrylamide (Laemmli) gels run under standard conditions (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.47-18.75Google Scholar). Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer prior to loading. Wet blotting to HybondTM-C extra nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was carried out at 100 V for 1 h at 4 °C (40Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (44707) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked 1 h at room temperature in TBS-T (0.1% Tween) containing 0.5% freeze-dried fat-free milk powder, washed several times with TBS-T, and reacted with primary antibody in TBS-T overnight at room temperature. Primary antibodies and dilutions used were mouse anti-Myc monoclonal 9E10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1:15,000 dilution of a 5 mg/ml stock, rabbit anti-glutamate dehydrogenase (kind gift of Dr. R. N. Lightowlers), 1:10,000, anti-complex IV (41Nijtmans L.G.J. Spelbrink J.N. van Galen M.J.M. Zwaart M. Klement P. van den Bogert C. Biochim. Biophys.

Blots were washed 2 times for 10 s, 1 time for 10 min, and 2 times for 5 min in TBS-T and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad), 1:10,000, or anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Inc.)) in TBS-T containing 0.5% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Blots were re-washed as above and finally with PBS. 5 ml of luminol solution (0.25 mg/ml sodium luminol (Sigma), 0.009% H2O2, 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 6.8) and 50 μl of enhancer solution (1.1 mg/ml para-hydroxycoumaric acid (Sigma) in Me2SO) were mixed and incubated on each blot for 1 min. Film (Kodak BiomaxTM ML) was exposed from 15 s to 45 min, as necessary.Plasmid DNA ConstructsThe RPMS12 coding region was amplified from a previously characterized full-length cDNA clone (5Shah Z.H. O'Dell K. Miller S.C.M. An X. Jacobs H.T.

The PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and HindIII and ligated into the pcDNA3.1(−)/Myc-His B vector DNA (Invitrogen) cut with the same enzymes, to generate the RPMS12-Myc/S plasmid, encoding the RPMS12-Myc fusion protein. A similar strategy was employed for cloning of the full mRNA sequence, i.e. including the entire 5′-UTR, to generate plasmid RPMS12-Myc/B, except that the 5′ PCR primer used was S12–58 (CGGGATCCCGCCGCGACCTCACCTTTAGGTC). All constructions were verified by complete DNA sequencing on both strands, using dye-terminator chemistry on the Perkin-Elmer ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer, with kit reagents supplied by the manufacturer.In Vitro Translation1 μg of circular plasmid DNA of construct RPMS12-S/pcDNA3.1(−)/Myc-His B was used as template in the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega), in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1000 Ci/mmol), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five μl of the in vitro translation reaction was adjusted to a final volume of 15 μl by the addition of PBS, plus lauryl maltoside to 1.5% (w/v) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 2.5 mm, and then centrifuged at 16,000 ×gmax for 1.5 min at 4 °C. The mitochondrial pellet from one plate of RPMS12-Myc-transfected cells was lysed in 25 μl of PBS containing 1.5% (w/v) lauryl maltoside and 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 × gmax for 1.5 min at 4 °C. 150 μl of each supernatant (in vitrotranslate and mitochondrial lysate) were used immediately for SDS-PAGE, in adjacent tracks of a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was blotted to HybondTM-C extra nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as above, autoradiographed to detect the35S-labeled translation product, and then processed for immunodetection of the Myc-tagged polypeptide.Oligonucleotides and PCRSequences of oligonucleotides used to create PCR probes for Northern blots and for RT-PCR analysis ofRPMS12 mRNAs were as shown in the figures and legends. Those used for rpL4 transcript analysis were rpL4-A (CATCGTATTGAGGAGTTCC), representing nucleotide pair (np) 439–458 of the rpL4 cDNA (42Bagni C. Mariottini P. Annesi F. Amaldi F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and rpL4-B (TGGTGCTCGAAGGGCTCT), corresponding with np 927–909, for β-actin transcript analysis β-ACT-A (CGCTCGTCGTCGACAACG) and β-ACT-B (AGGTCTCAAACATGATCT), which amplify a 360-bp PCR product (43Rapanotti M.C. Pucci B. Amaldi F. Loreni F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 154: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). For the control rpL22 transcript used in RT-PCR assays, the primers were rpL22 (CGTGGGCACGTCAGTCAC) (np 57–75, Ref. 44Ponte P. Ng S.Y. Engel J. Gunning P. Kedes L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 1687-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) and the KS vector primer (Promega), which amplify a 600-bp PCR product encompassing the cloned cDNA and a small portion of the pBSK plasmid (Promega), thus avoiding the amplification of the endogenous rpL22 mRNA. Probes for Northern analysis ofRPMS12 mRNAs were derived by PCR amplification of a full-length RPMS12 cDNA clone and were gel-purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) before radiolabeling. PCR was carried out on HeLa cell genomic DNA (200 ng) to check the specificity of the various primer pairs designed for transcript analysis. Products were purified using either the QIAquick PCR purification or QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and were sequenced by means of the Amplicycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer). For RT-PCR total RNA samples were reverse-transcribed into cDNA by the random hexanucleotides technique (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 90 min. Four of the 20 μl of the reverse transcriptase reaction were PCR-amplified in a final volume of 50 μl, using 20 pmol of each specific primer, 200 mm of each dNTP, and 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Here we show that these arrested extracts have high levels of M-phase promoting factor (MPF, Cyclin B/Cdc2) activity, stabilized levels of Cyclin B, and sustained M-phase-specific phosphorylations. We also examined the role of p42 MAPK in DNA damage checkpoint-arrested extracts that were induced to enter M-phase by the addition of Cdc25C protein. In these extracts, Cdc25C protein triggers the abrupt, premature activation of MPF and entry into M-phase. MPF activity then drops suddenly due to Cyclin B proteolysis, just as p42 MAPK is activated. Unexpectedly, however, M-phase is sustained, as judged by maintenance of M-phase-specific phosphorylations and condensed chromosomes. To determine if this M-phase arrest depended on p42 MAPK activation, we added PD98059 (PD), an inhibitor of p42 MAPK activation, to egg extracts with exogenous Cdc25. Both untreated and PD-treated extracts entered M-phase simultaneously, with a sharp peak of MPF activity. However, only PD-treated extracts subsequently exited from M-phase and entered interphase. In PD-treated extracts, p42 MAPK was not activated, and the transition to interphase was accompanied by the formation of decondensed nuclei and the disappearance of M-phase-specific phosphorylation of proteins. These results show that although entry into M-phase requires the activation of MPF, exit from M-phase even after cyclin destruction, is dependent on the inactivation of p42 MAPK.

Cell. 1998; 90: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 10Walter S.A. Guadagno T.M. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2157-2169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that activation of p42 MAPK by Mos can lead to an M-phase arrest that is maintained even after the inactivation of MPF. We have further shown that MPF levels fall in these extracts due to mitotic cyclin proteolysis (7Chau A.S.-S. Shibuya E.K. Biol. Cell. 1998; 90: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the inactivation of p42 MAPK is required for exit from an M-phase arrest that is sustained after mitotic cyclin degradation and Cdc2 inactivation. In the process of initially characterizing recombinant Cdc25C proteins (wild type and a mutant that cannot be inhibited by 14-3-3 protein binding (11Kumagai A. Yakowec P.S. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol.

Shibuya, unpublished observations.), we have found that these proteins were able to drive interphase checkpoint-arrested egg extracts into an M-phase arrest as determined by cytology (NEBD and CC, see Refs. 11Kumagai A.

Unexpectedly, although MPF was activated to high levels on entry into M-phase in these extracts, Cyclin B was rapidly proteolyzed leading to an abrupt fall in MPF levels, just as p42 MAPK activity appeared. The p42 MAPK activation was sustained throughout the M-phase arrest. To determine the role of p42 MAPK in this M-phase arrest, we added an inhibitor of MAPK activation to interphase extracts that were then driven into M-phase by the addition of Cdc25C protein. These extracts did not show p42 MAPK activation and did not arrest in M-phase. Instead, after a brief M-phase, the extracts entered interphase. These results suggest that although the activation of MPF is required for entry into M-phase, p42 MAPK can sustain M-phase after MPF inactivation. Moreover, the inactivation of p42 MAPK, rather than MPF, is required for exit from M-phase. CyclingXenopus egg extracts were prepared as described previously (5Bitangcol J.C. Chau A.S.-S. Stadnick E.

Nature. 1989; 339: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Briefly, dejellied Xenopus eggs were activated by electrical shock. At 21–23 min after activation, eggs were packed in extraction buffer (with protease inhibitors and cytochalasin B), over silicon oil, and extracts were made by centrifugation twice at 10,200 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. An ATP-regenerating system was added immediately, and supplemented extracts were kept on ice and used within 1 h. Egg extracts for DNA damage checkpoint and Cdc25 protein addition experiments were prepared in the same way, except the extraction buffer was chilled to 4 °C. Sperm nuclei were prepared as described previously (14Vigers G.P. Lohka M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and quantified prior to addition to extracts. For low sperm addition, preparations were diluted to 14,000 sperm nuclei/μl, and for high sperm additions, stocks of 49,000 nuclei/μl were prepared. Extracts of unfertilized eggs that are arrested at metaphase of meiosis were made as described previously (5Bitangcol J.C. Chau A.S.-S. Stadnick E. Dicken B. Lohka M.J. Shibuya E.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 451-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and used as M-phase controls. Constitutively active MEK protein (MEK(QP)) was expressed as an N-terminal glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein and purified fromEscherichia coli by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography and then concentrated to 0.8–1.0 mg/ml, as described previously (5Bitangcol J.C.

A BamHI toClaI fragment of Cdc25C with the Ser-287 to Ala substitution was generated using two sets of oligonucleotides (ATGCCAGAGAAGCTTGACAGGCCA and GGATAACGACAATCGATTATAAAG) to introduce an internal HindIII restriction site, and ATATAAGCTTCTCTGGCATAGCAGGTGAGCGGTA and GATGAATATCTTGGGATCCCCCAT to introduce the T to C transition, resulting in a Ser to Ala substitution. These two polymerase chain reaction fragments were ligated together and then inserted into pMALCdc25C(wild-type) in which the internal BamHI to ClaI fragment had been deleted. Mutant Cdc25C(S287A) protein was expressed as an N-terminal maltose-binding fusion protein in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography using amylose resin according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein preparations were concentrated to 0.2 mg/ml. In MEK(QP)-added reactions, 66 μl of supplemented extract was transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube; 0.5 μl of sperm suspension was added (final concentration of 100 nuclei/μl), and reactions were incubated in water baths between 21 and 22 °C. At 0 or 40 min after start of incubation, 3.5 μl of either buffer or protein was added (to 5% volume in a final reaction volume of 70 μl), and the reaction was mixed with wide-bore pipette tips, and initial samples were taken as described previously for H1 kinase assays, blot analysis, and cytology (5Bitangcol J.C. Chau A.S.-S. Stadnick E. Dicken B. Lohka M.J. Shibuya E.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 451-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Samples were taken every 10 min thereafter. For DNA damage checkpoint and Cdc25 protein addition experiments, nuclei were treated with UV irradiation as described previously (11Kumagai A. Yakowec P.S. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol.

For these assays, 62 μl of supplemented extract was transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube; 1.0 μl of sperm nuclei was added (to a final concentration of 700 sperm nuclei/μl), and 7.0 μl of maltose binding protein-Cdc25(S287A) protein preparation was added to achieve a final concentration of 0.16 μm. Reactions were incubated for 60 min at 21–22 °C before initial samples were taken for H1 kinase activity assay, blot analysis, and cytology. Samples were taken every 10 min for up to 120 min. Experiments using the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (17Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

MPM-2 antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Detection of primary antibody binding was by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma). Histone H1 kinase assays were done exactly as described (5Bitangcol J.C. Chau A.S.-S. Stadnick E. Dicken B. Lohka M.J. Shibuya E.K. Mol. Biol.

Nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) and chromosome condensation (CC), markers of M-phase were maintained, with the condensed chromosomes associated with spindles (Fig. 1 b) (5Bitangcol J.C.

These results are similar to those obtained when the spindle assembly checkpoint and p42 MAPK activation are induced by high concentrations of nuclei and microtubule depolymerization (2Minshull J.

Cell. 1998; 9: 451-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the extent of the other M-phase-specific phosphorylations in the arrested extract is shown by the sustained presence of MPM-2-reactive phosphoproteins, whereas these proteins are detected only transiently during M-phase in cycling extracts (Fig. 1 c). The MPM-2 monoclonal antibody recognizes proteins when they undergo M-phase-specific phosphorylations (7Chau A.S.-S. Shibuya E.K. Biol.

It has been previously shown that egg extracts containing unreplicated or damaged DNA have an extended interphase and can be driven into M-phase by the addition of excess recombinant Cdc25C protein (11Kumagai A.

In the current study, we observed that egg extracts with unirradiated sperm nuclei added to 700 sperm/μl cycled slowly and did not enter M-phase until 140 min of incubation (Fig.2 a), a delay consistent with previous observations (11Kumagai A.

These extracts were arrested in interphase for at least 180 min of incubation, as judged by low levels of histone H1 kinase activity, interphase nuclei, and lack of MPM-2 reactive phosphoproteins (Fig. 2 b).

When recombinant Cdc25C(S287A) protein was added to interphase-arrested extracts, the DNA damage checkpoint was overcome, with the activation of histone H1 kinase activity inducing entry into M-phase (Fig. 2 c) (11Kumagai A. Yakowec P.S. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 12Kumagai A. Guo Z. Emami K.H. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We observed that the Cdc25C(WT) protein could also rescue the checkpoint-arrested extracts, but entry into M-phase occurred 20–30 min later than with Cdc25C(S287A) protein (data not shown), as has been previously reported (11Kumagai A. Yakowec P.S. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The S287A mutation abolishes the inhibition of Cdc25C by 14-3-3 protein binding (11, 15, 16, and data not shown), which explains why the addition of Cdc25C(S287A) to extracts induces M-phase earlier than the addition of Cdc25C(WT). However, the fact that Cdc25C(WT) addition to extracts is also able to induce M-phase suggests that the total level of Cdc25C (both endogenous and exogenous) exceeds the ability of the extract to inhibit all of the Cdc25C. Both Cdc25C proteins drive the interphase-arrested extracts into M-phase by removing the inhibitory tyrosine and threonine phosphorylations on Cdc2 (reviewed in Ref. 26Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The Cdc25(S287A)-rescued extracts were arrested in M-phase, showing certain features that were similar to those we observed in the MEK(QP)-induced M-phase-arrested extracts in Fig. 1. In both types of M-phase-arrested extracts, Cdc25C hyperphosphorylation was maintained (data not shown), MPM-2-reactive phosphoproteins persisted, and condensed chromosomes were associated with spindles. In contrast to the MEK(QP)-induced M-phase-arrested extracts, however, in the Cdc25C(S287A)-rescued extracts, histone H1 kinase activity dropped abruptly to interphase levels, and Cyclin B2 was was proteolyzed (Fig.2 c). Interestingly, p42 MAPK was fully activated after the peak of histone H1 kinase activity in these Cdc25C(S287A)-rescued extracts (Fig. 2 c, 90 min), and p42 MAPK activation was maintained throughout the M-phase arrest. Thus, in these extracts, maintenance of M-phase was correlated with sustained p42 MAPK activation, not high levels of MPF activity or stabilized Cyclin B. To determine if activation of the p42 MAPK pathway was responsible for the M-phase arrest in egg extracts that had undergone cyclin destruction, the MEK-specific inhibitor, PD98059 (PD (5Bitangcol J.C.

As we observed with DNA damage checkpoint-arrested extracts, Cdc25C(S287A) and Me2SO addition to egg extracts caused an accelerated entry into M-phase (data not shown) and subsequent arrest. In this reaction, the M-phase arrest was accompanied by maintenance of p42 MAPK activation, MPM-2-reactive phosphoproteins (Fig.3 a), hyperphosphorylated Cdc25C (both endogenous and exogenous, not shown), and NEBD and CC (Fig. 3 d). Similar to the DNA damage checkpoint-arrested extracts rescued by Cdc25C(S287A) (Fig. 2 c), histone H1 kinase activity levels peaked on entry into M-phase, abruptly dropped to interphase levels, and then started to increase slowly (Fig.3 a). Again, p42 MAPK was fully activated just after the peak of histone H1 kinase activity. The fall in histone H1 kinase activity coincided precisely with proteolysis of Cyclin B2, and then Cyclin B2 began to accumulate as levels of histone H1 kinase activity rose (Fig.3 a). When PD was added to egg extracts with 700 sperm/μl and Cdc25C(S287A), entry into M-phase occurred at the same time as in extracts without PD, with a peak of histone H1 kinase activity followed by a sudden drop to interphase levels (Fig. 3, a andb). In these PD-treated extracts, Cyclin B2 was proteolyzed, and then Cyclin B2 accumulated later than in extracts without PD (Fig.3 b). In contrast, however, p42 MAPK activation was completely inhibited by PD in these extracts (5Bitangcol J.C. Chau A.S.-S. Stadnick E. Dicken B. Lohka M.J. Shibuya E.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 451-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and after entering M-phase (as determined by the appearance of MPM-2-reactive phosphoproteins, and NEBD and CC (Fig. 3 e)), the extracts exited M-phase and entered interphase. Transition to interphase was accompanied by decondensing nuclei (Fig. 3 f), disappearance of M-phase-specific phosphoproteins (Fig. 3 b), and dephosphorylation of Cdc25C (both endogenous and exogenous, not shown). Taken together, our results show that although the activation of Cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes is required for entry into M-phase, p42 MAPK inactivation is required for exit from M-phase and transition to interphase. Moreover, these results also suggest that although entry into M-phase is required for the phosphorylation of Cdc25C and other MPM-2-reactive phosphoproteins, the sustained phosphorylations observed in M-phase arrest are maintained by p42 MAPK activation. The major findings of this study are that the activation of p42 MAPK maintains M-phase arrest after the inactivation of MPF by Cyclin B destruction and that the inactivation of p42 MAPK is necessary for exit from M-phase. Recently, we have shown that when p42 MAPK is constitutively activated in cycling Xenopus egg extracts after the peak of MPF kinase activity, there is brief drop in Cdc2 activity due to Cyclin B (7Chau A.S.-S. Shibuya E.K. Biol. Cell. 1998; 90: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These results and those of the present work are unexpected given that the M-phase arrest in egg extracts previously observed in response to activators of the p42 MAPK (see Refs. 4Walter S.A.

There are similarities between the M-phase-arrested extracts as represented in Fig. 1, and the M-phase-arrested extracts in Figs. 2 and3 of this study. In all of the extracts, MPF is activated on entry into M-phase, and M-phase-specific phosphoproteins appear and are sustained. In addition, nuclei undergo NEBD and CC and remain in this state. By these criteria alone, it would be reasonable to predict that maintenance of MPF activity was solely responsible for the M-phase arrest in all of these extracts. However, the data in Figs. 2 and 3clearly demonstrate that M-phase can be sustained by p42 MAPK after Cyclin B proteolysis and the fall of MPF activity to interphase levels, suggesting that p42 MAPK has additional functions later in M-phase that can maintain cell cycle arrest. Differences in the timing of p42 MAPK activation in these extracts may account for these apparent contradictory findings. When the activation of p42 MAPK by MEK(QP) occurs during entry into M-phase coincident with MPF activation, high levels of MPF activity are maintained, and Cyclin B is stabilized (Fig. 1). In contrast, when interphase extracts are driven into M-phase by Cdc25(S287A) (Figs. 2 and 3), p42 MAPK is fully activated after the peak of histone H1 kinase activity, at a time when MPF activity is rapidly falling. Therefore, in extracts driven into M-phase by Cdc25C protein addition there appears to be a dissociation between the cycle of MPF activation and inactivation and the timing of p42 MAPK activation. Under these conditions, p42 MAPK clearly sustained M-phase even after cyclin destruction. Similarly, in all of our cycling extracts studied to date (5Bitangcol J.C. Chau A.S.-S. Stadnick E. Dicken B. Lohka M.J. Shibuya E.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 451-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 7Chau A.S.-S. Shibuya E.K. Biol. Cell. 1998; 90: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the transient activation of p42 MAPK always occurred after the peak of MPF activity, and nuclei in M-phase continued to be present (post-cyclin destruction) in all samples that contained active p42 MAPK. Also, the addition of PD to cycling extracts shortened the duration of M-phase (judged by cytology) as compared with that observed in untreated cycling extracts (data not shown, see Ref.10Walter S.A. Guadagno T.M. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2157-2169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together with the results presented here, these observations suggest that the brief transient of p42 MAPK activation in normally cycling extracts can also extend M-phase after the inactivation of MPF by cyclin destruction. After proteolysis, Cyclin B2 reappeared sooner in untreated extracts than in PD-treated extracts, suggesting that the duration of cyclin destruction in extracts with activated p42 MAPK was shorter than in extracts with unactivated p42 MAPK. These results are consistent with the results of previous studies that p42 MAPK activation can prevent the initiation of cyclin destruction (Fig. 1, this study, and Refs. 2Minshull J. Sun H. Tonks N.K. Murray A.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 475-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholarand 3Abrieu A. Lorca T. Labbe J.C. Morin N. Keyse S. Doree M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 239-246PubMed Google Scholar). Our results further suggest that p42 MAPK activation can also turn off the destruction pathway once it has been activated (Figs.2 c and 3). We also observed that histone H1 kinase activity reappears sooner in untreated extracts than in PD-treated extracts (Fig. 3). One explanation for this increase in activity could be that Cdc25C (both endogenous and exogenous) is stabilized in an active state by p42 MAPK in untreated extracts. As a result, as newly synthesized B-type cyclins (mitotic cyclins are continuously synthesized throughout the cell cycle, see Ref. 27Evans T. Rosenthal E.T. Youngbloom J. Distel D. Hunt T. Cell. 1983; 33: 389-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar) form complexes with Cdc2, these complexes could be activated immediately due to the activated exogenous and endogenous Cdc25C. There are two p42 MAPK consensus sites in Cdc25C, and we are presently exploring the possible role of these sites in the stabilization of Cdc25C hyperphosphorylation and activity. Recently, it has been shown that activated MAPKs (p42 and p44) have been detected at kinetochores and at the periphery of condensed chromosomes during M-phase in somatic mammalian cells (28Shapiro P.S.

These results suggest that active p42 MAPK in Xenopus egg extracts could be similarly localized to chromatin during M-phase in cyclingXenopus egg extracts and in the Cdc25-induced M-phase-arrested extracts reported here. However, the maintenance of MPM-2-reactive phosphoproteins in p42 MAPK-arrested extracts suggests that M-phase conditions are uniform throughout the extract and extend beyond a simple localized effect on chromatin. Our results provide strong evidence that although the activation of MPF-Cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes is required for entry into M-phase, once established M-phase can be sustained by p42 MAPK activation and does not require the maintenance of MPF activity. Therefore, whereas the activation of MPF drives the cell cycle from interphase into M-phase, it appears that the inactivation of p42 MAPK, in addition to inactivation of MPF, is required for exit from M-phase.

Based on the activity toward the α-ketosides of Neu5Ac and KDN, sialidases can be divided into: (a) conventional sialidase, which efficiently cleaves Neu5Ac with very little or no activity toward the hydrolysis of KDN; (b) KDN-sialidase, which hydrolyzes both KDN and Neu5Ac; and (c) KDNase, which efficiently cleaves KDN with very little activity toward Neu5Ac (13Li Y.-T.

While further surveying the distribution of KDN-cleaving enzymes in the animal kingdom, we found that the hepatopancreas of the oyster, Crassostrea virginica, was a convenient source rich in KDN-sialidase and devoid of conventional sialidase.

(Torrance, CA). Fluorometric assay of MU-KDN- or MU-Neu5Ac-cleaving activity was carried out essentially according to the procedure described by Potier et al. (20Potier M. Mameli L. Bélisle M. Dallaire L. Melançon S.B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). The enzyme was incubated with 0.5 mm MU-KDN or MU-Neu5Ac in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, in a total volume of 100 μl at 37 °C. After a set time, 1.5 ml of 0.2 m sodium borate buffer, pH 9.8, was added to the reaction mixture to stop the reaction. The released MU was determined using a Sequoia-Turner Model 450 fluorometer. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount that liberates 1 nmol of MU/min at 37 °C. For detecting free Neu5Ac or KDN released from water-soluble sialoglycoconjugates by TLC, 30 nmol of substrate in 30 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, were incubated with an appropriate amount of enzyme at 37 °C. After incubation, 30 μl of ethanol were added to the reaction mixture, and 15 μl-aliquots were analyzed by TLC. For glycolipid substrates GM3 and KDN-GM3, the reaction mixture contained 10 nmol of the substrate in 30 μl of the same buffer. The reaction was stopped by adding 30 μl of ethanol, dried under vacuum, redissolved in 10 μl methanol:water (1/1, v/v), and applied onto a TLC plate. The tube was rinsed twice with 10 μl of chloroform:methanol (2/1, v/v) to solubilize any remaining glycolipids, and the rinse was also applied onto the same positions on the TLC plate, as described previously (14Yuziuk J.A. Nakagawa A. Hasegawa A. Kiso M. Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The plates were developed by 1-butanol:acetic acid:water (2/1/1, v/v/v), sprayed with diphenylamine reagent (21Harris G. MacWilliams I.C. Chem. Ind. (Lond.). 1954; : 249Google Scholar), and heated at 115 °C for 20 min to visualize glycoconjugates. The quantitative estimation of the stained bands on a TLC plate was accomplished by scanning the plate using a Scan Jet 2C/ADF scanner (Hewlett-Packard) and NIH Image 1.41 program. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Doucet and Trifaro (22Doucet J.-P. Trifaro J.-M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) using Bio-Rad Mini-Protein cell. Native PAGE was carried out on Phast System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using high density gel, reversed polarity electrode assembly (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and acidic buffer strips, pH 4.1, made according to Pharmacia Phast System application file number 300. IEF-PAGE was performed on Phast System using IEF 3–9 gels. Proteins were visualized with Coomassie Blue and silver staining. The initial rates for the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of MU-KDN and MU-Neu5Ac were evaluated from kinetic curves of product accumulation measured at least in duplicate experiments as described by Boeker (23Boeker E.A. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The reactions with 0.4 units of the enzyme were carried out at a fixed concentration of each substrate in the range between 0.025 and 0.85 mm. For inhibition assays, the solutions also contained a defined amount (0.02–0.1 mm) of the substrate analog Neu5Ac2-en or KDN2-en. The initial rates were analyzed by using multivariable nonlinear regression data analysis programs for determining the kinetic parameters of enzymatic hydrolysis and inhibition, kindly provided by Dr. A. R. Pavlov, Department of Ophthalmology, Tulane University School of Medicine. Microsequencing was carried out by the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory of Yale University. The gel slice containing the protein was digested with trypsin, and the eluate was subjected to microbore HPLC. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry was used to evaluate peak purity and identify candidate peaks suitable for sequencing. The sequences obtained were compared with GenBank™ and EST data bases. Exoglycosidases were assayed using MU- and p-nitrophenylglycosides in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, as described previously (24Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 702-713Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The proteolytic activity was assayed using Azocoll as a substrate (25Moore G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or using BCA protein microassay method according to the user's guide. Unless otherwise indicated, all operations were performed at 0–5 °C. Chromatofocusing, octyl-Sepharose, and hydroxyapatite chromatographies were carried out at room temperature. Centrifugations were routinely carried out at 20,000–30,000 × g for 30 to 40 min using a Sorvall RC5C refrigerated centrifuge. Unless otherwise indicated, an Amicon stirred cell with a PM-10 membrane was used for concentration. Each hepatopancreas was manually removed from oyster with scissors. The hepatopancreas (500 g) derived from 1.5 gallon (about 210 oysters) of fresh oysters were homogenized with 3.5 liters of cold acetone, immediately filtered with a Buchner funnel, and dried under vacuum to obtain 135 g of oyster hepatopancreas acetone powder (27Nakagawa H. Asakawa M. Enomoto N. J. Biochem. 1987; 101: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This acetone powder can be kept in a freezer (-20 °C) for at least a year without losing the MU-KDN-cleaving activity. The acetone powder was homogenized with 3.4 liters of water containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as protease inhibitors using a Polytron (Brinkmann), followed by centrifugation to obtain the acetone powder extract. The pH of the extract was adjusted to 4.0 with saturated citric acid, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was brought to 45% saturation (277 g/liter) with solid ammonium sulfate. After 2 h, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was further brought to 85% saturation (295 g/liter) with ammonium sulfate. After standing overnight, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and dissolved in 40 ml of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.2. This crude enzyme preparation was used for further purification of the two KDN-cleaving enzymes. The crude enzyme preparation was applied onto a Sephacryl S-200 column (5 × 100 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.2, containing 0.15 m NaCl. The column was eluted with the same buffer at 1 ml/min, and 20-ml fractions were collected. The fractions containing both MU-KDN- and MU-Neu5Ac-cleaving activities, as shown in Fig. 1 A, were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The enzyme preparation obtained from Sephacryl S-200 filtration was equilibrated with 1.5m ammonium sulfate using an Amicon stirred cell with PM-10 membrane, adjusted to 3 ml, and applied onto an octyl-Sepharose column (1.5 × 46 cm) equilibrated with 1.5 m of ammonium sulfate. The column was eluted with 1.5 m ammonium sulfate at 2 ml/min, followed by 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.2, and 3-ml fractions were collected. The fractions containing KDN-cleaving activity, separated into two portions as shown in Fig.1 B, were concentrated and desalted using an Amicon stirred cell with PM-10 membrane. The leading edge of the ammonium sulfate-eluted peak, containing MU-KDN-cleaving activity with very low MU-Neu5Ac-cleaving activity (Fig. 1 B, fractions 16 to 19), was used for the isolation of KDNase. The main fraction (Fig.1 B, fractions 20 to 29), containing both MU-KDN- and MU-Neu5Ac-cleaving activity, was used for the purification of KDN-sialidase. The enzyme preparation obtained after octyl Sepharose chromatography (Fig. 1 B, fractions 20 to 29) was applied onto a Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration column (1.5 × 90 cm) equilibrated with 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7. The column was eluted with the same buffer at 0.3 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The fractions containing both MU-KDN- and MU-Neu5Ac-cleaving activities were pooled and concentrated to 0.2 ml using a Centricon-10 microconcentrator. This preparation was further purified by FPLC chromatofocusing using a Mono P HR 5/20 (0.5 × 20 cm) column. The starting buffer was 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.6, and the running buffer was Polybuffer 96, adjusted to pH 7.0 using acetic acid according to the Pharmacia (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) manual. Both starting and running buffer contained 10% sucrose to protect the enzyme from losing activity at high pH. The Mono P column was eluted with running buffer at 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The major activity peak (Fig. 1 C) was concentrated to 0.1 ml using a Centricon-10 microconcentrator. For further purification of KDN-sialidase, the Mono P purified preparation was dialyzed against 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and applied onto a Macro-Prep ceramic hydroxyapatite column (0.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer at 1 ml/min. After washing the column with the same buffer, the column was eluted stepwise with 20, 50, 80, and 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and 2-ml fractions were collected (results not shown). The KDN-sialidase activity eluted by 20 mm of sodium phosphate was adjusted to pH 4.6 by adding 0.5 msodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0. To prevent the loss of the activity due to low protein concentration, this preparation was applied onto a small Fractogel EMD SP-650(S) column (100 μl of gel) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6. Under these conditions, the enzyme was completely retained by the column and was subsequently eluted by 1 ml of 0.5 m NaCl in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6. This preparation was concentrated and desalted using a Microcon 10 micro-concentrator. The leading edge of the ammonium sulfate-eluted peak of the octyl-Sepharose column (Fig. 1 B; fractions 16 to 19) was concentrated, dialyzed against 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6, and divided into three portions. Each portion was separately applied onto an FPLC SP-Fractogel 650S column (0.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing with the same buffer to remove unadsorbed proteins, the column was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.5 m in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6 (total volume 15 ml), at 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected (Fig.1 D). Two resolved peaks (I and II) with MU-KDN-cleaving activity were concentrated separately by Centricon-10. Peak II was found to contain MU-KDN-cleaving activity with very low MU-Neu5Ac-cleaving activity. This peak was further purified by chromatofocusing using the conditions identical to that for the purification of KDN-sialidase to obtain KDNase.

Open table in a new tab The purification and enzymatic assays were carried out as described in the text. Steps 1–6 and 5′–7′ show a representative purification of KDN-sialidase (KS) and KDNase from 135 g of oyster hepatopancreas acetone powder. Steps 1–6 represent the purification of KDN-sialidase, whereas steps 5′–7′ were carried out for the purification of KDNase, using a different fraction from step 4 (Fig. 1 B). By IEF-PAGE and agarose gel substrate overlay (28Tronsmo A. Harman G.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) using MU-KDN and MU-Neu5Ac as substrates, the enzyme preparation obtained by octyl-Sepharose chromatography (Fig.1 B, fractions 20 to 29) was found to contain multiple isoelectric forms of KDN-cleaving activity. The pI of the isoelectric forms ranged from 4.5 to 8.8 (Fig.2, lane 7), with a major form focused at a pI in the vicinity of 8.4. Because of the heterogeneity of KDN-cleaving activity, the purification of KDN-cleaving enzymes from the hepatopancreas of oyster proved to be a challenge (Table I). Using Sephacryl S-200 chromatography, MU-KDN- and MU-Neu5Ac-cleaving activities were coeluted as one peak (Fig. 1 A). By subsequent octyl-Sepharose chromatography (Fig. 1 B), the major MU-KDN- and MU-Neu5Ac-cleaving activities were eluted slightly behind the breakthrough protein peak. This step effectively removed the contaminating exo-glycosidases and the bulk of proteins that were retained by the column along with the rest of the MU-KDN- and MU-Neu5Ac-cleaving activities. Examination of the activity peak revealed that the leading edge of the peak (Fig.1 B, fractions 16 to 19) contained a high ratio of MU-KDN- to MU-Neu5Ac-cleaving activity. Therefore, the front portion of this peak was pooled separately and subjected to FPLC SP-Fractogel chromatography. As shown in Fig. 1 D, two well separated peaks, I and II, with MU-KDN-cleaving activity were eluted by linear NaCl gradient. Peak I also exhibited some activity toward MU-Neu5Ac (the ratio of MU-KDN- to MU-Neu5Ac-cleaving activity was 10:1), whereas in peak II the MU-Neu5Ac-cleaving activity was extremely low. The ratio of MU-KDN- to MU-Neu5Ac-cleaving activity in this preparation was greater than 500:1. For comparison, the ratio of MU-KDN- to MU-Neu5Ac-cleaving activity of C. perfringens andArthrobacter ureafaciens sialidases has been found to be 1 to 350 and 1 to 60, respectively (14Yuziuk J.A. Nakagawa A. Hasegawa A. Kiso M. Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, enzyme eluted in peak I represents a KDN-sialidase, whereas that from peak II, a KDNase. The main enzyme preparation obtained from the octyl-Sepharose column (Fig. 1 B, fractions 20 to 29) was found to contain multiple isoforms (Fig. 2, lane 7). This preparation was subjected to a second gel filtration followed by chromatofocusing. The second gel filtration resulted in a 2-fold increase in specific activity (see Table I). Based on the results obtained by IEF-PAGE, an eluent with a pH range of 8.6 to 7.0 was chosen for chromatofocusing. The elution profile from a Mono P column (Fig. 1 C) was in agreement with that of isoelectric focusing (Fig. 2, lane 7). As shown in Fig. 1 C, one major KDN-sialidase peak was focused at pH 8.4, whereas a number of other minor peaks were focused over a lower pH range. KDN-sialidase obtained from the major peak was found to be essentially free of other exo-glycosidases and proteases. Chromatofocusing enabled us to purify the major isoform of the enzyme, which contained about 15–20% total MU-KDN-cleaving activity as determined by IEF-PAGE and substrate overlay. To prevent the inactivation of the enzyme due to high pH, chromatofocusing was performed in the presence of 10% sucrose. Table Isummarizes the results of a typical purification of KDN-sialidase from 135 g of the acetone powder. This purification scheme has been repeated more than 10 times and has been found to be quite reproducible. The preparation obtained by chromatofocusing could be further purified by ceramic hydroxyapatite chromatography. The main isoform of KDN-sialidase activity was eluted by 20 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and was purified more than 12,000-fold (results not shown). When examined by IEF-PAGE and substrate overlay, this preparation was found to contain two isoforms focused around pH 8.4. No other proteins were detected in this preparation (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5). However, the recovery of this step was less than 5%. Therefore, the ceramic hydroxyapatite step was not practical for obtaining the pure enzyme. By native PAGE at pH 4.1, the KDN-sialidase purified by chromatofocusing (Fig. 1 C) moved as a single protein band (Fig. 3 A, lane 1) coincident with the MU-KDN-cleaving activity, as revealed by the agarose-gel substrate overlay (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). However, by IEF-PAGE (Phast system), it gave a closely spaced doublet of MU-KDN-cleaving activity together with several pr"

In the case of the Hb from Ascaris suum, the extraordinarily high O2 affinity and extremely low O2 off-rates have been attributed to a distal H bonding interactions for the Tyr30(B10) and Gln64(E7) side chains with bound O2. Stabilizing H bond interactions of Gln64(E7) and Tyr30(B10) with ligated O2 are supported by the observations of enhanced O2 off-rates upon mutating either residue (5De Baere I. Perutz M.F. Kiger L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2377-2379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The positions of these two key residues are clearly defined in the crystal structure of A. suum HbO2, in which the two residues are appropriately poised to serve as H bond donors to bound O2, with the Gln64(E7) additionally providing an H bond to the Tyr30(B10) side chain O that stabilizes the optimal dispositions of these two residues (8Yang J. Kloek A. Goldberg D.E. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92 (s): 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Resonance Raman spectroscopy has confirmed the role of Tyr30(B10) as a H bond donor (18Huang S.C. Huang J. Kloek A.P. Goldberg D.E. Friedman J.M. J. Biol.

Resonance Raman spectroscopy has shown that A. suum HbCO exhibits the lowest reported CO stretching frequency (19Peterson E.S. Huang S.C. Wang J.Q. Miller L.M. Vidugiris G. Kloek A.P. Goldberg D.E. Chance M.R. Wittenberg J.B. Friedman J.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13110-13121Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The strong modulation of the CO stretching frequency by globin distal environment has been discussed in the context of both steric tilt/bending of the Fe-CO unit from the heme normal and pocket dielectric effects (20Vangberg T.

Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 516-520Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the currently accepted interpretive basis is that the latter effect is the major determinant of νCO (7Springer B.A. Sligar S.G.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, crystal structures of myoglobins invariably find the carbonyl oxygen placed off-axis from the heme normal, indicating that the Fe-CO unit is bent/tilted from the heme normal (7Springer B.A. Sligar S.G.

The cyanomet derivatives of globins can serve as valuable structural (but not functional) (28Brancaccio A. Cutruzzolá F. Travaglini Allocatelli C. Brunori M. Smerdon S.J. Wilkinson A.J. Dou Y.

La Mar G.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 7219-7220Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and, like FeIICO, prefers to bind normal to the heme in the absence of distal steric interactions (31Slebodnick C. Ibers J.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 521-525Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the one case where the crystal structures of both the carbonyl and cyanomet globins have been reported, there is a good correlation in the degree and direction of the off-axis placement of the terminal atoms (26Steigemann W. Weber E. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 127: 309-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Theoretical considerations have indicated that distal ligand tilt could be modulated by tilt of the proximal His (32Jewsbury P. Yamamoto S. Minato T. Saito M. Kitagawa T. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 12677-12685Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the crystallographically and NMR characterized globins to date, the axial His is essentially normal to the heme. The crystal structures ofA. suum HbO2, on the other hand, show that the axial His imidazole plane is tilted some ∼8 ° in the direction of pyrrole C with respect to the heme plane (8Yang J. Kloek A. Goldberg D.E. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92 (s): 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus a determination of orientation of the FeIIICN or FeIICO units relative to the heme in A. suum Hb would indicate whether the axial His could contribute to distal ligand tilt and provide some insight as to whether there is likely to be a large Fe-CO tilt that could contribute to the reduced value for νco. Solution 1H NMR of the paramagnetic cyanomet Hb derivatives can provide significant structural details on the distal pocket in relation to both stabilizing H bonding and destabilizing steric interactions with the bound ligand (30Lecomte J.T.J. La Mar G.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 7219-7220Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Rajarathnam K. Qin J. La Mar G.N. Chiu M.L. Sligar S.G.

On the one hand, the dipolar shifts and moderate relaxation imparted to distal residues and their labile protons facilitate their detection, identification, and detailed placement relative to the bound ligand (35Bertini I. Turano P. Vila A.J. Chem. Rev. 1993; 93: 2833-2932Crossref Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 36Yamamoto Y. Ann. Rpts. NMR Spectros. 1998; 30: 1-77Google Scholar). On the other hand, the sizable dipolar shifts for active site residues allow the quantitative determination of the orientation of the paramagnetic susceptibility tensor, for which the major magnetic axis can be correlated to the degree of Fe-CN tilt from the heme normal (34Emerson S.D. La Mar G.N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). There is generally very good agreement in the magnitude and direction of Fe-CN tilt observed in crystal structure and the orientation of the major magnetic axes determined by solution 1H NMR (26Steigemann W.

Lastly, the expanded chemical shift scale for heme pocket residues because of the hyperfine interaction increases the prospect for measuring rapid dynamic processes, such as ring orientation, that can constitute probes for the constraints in the heme pocket (42Emerson S.D. Lecomte J.T.J. La Mar G.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 4176-4182Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We report herein on the solution 1H NMR characterization of the cyanomet complex of the D1 domain of A. suum metHbCN, which demonstrates that the distal H bonding network is essentially identical to that in HbO2, that the Fe-CN unit appears tilted strongly away from the heme normal in the direction of the observed terminal oxygen in HbO2, and that the distal pocket is sufficiently crowded to strongly tilt the Fe-CN vector and to impede the reorientation of the Tyr30(B10) ring. Native protein samples were prepared as described previously (15Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Frieden C. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2377-2379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cyanide complexes were prepared by adding KCN to the protein solution approximately in a molar ratio of 10:1 buffered with 50 mm phosphate, 200 mm NaCl at pH 7.2. 2H2O sample was prepared by repeatedly washing protein with 2H2O in the same buffer with a Centricon (Amicon Inc.), and pH was read directly from the pH meter without the isotope effect correction; the final protein concentration was ∼2 mm. All 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a GE Ω 500 spectrometer operating at 500 MHz. Chemical shift values were referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-pentane-5-sulfonate (DSS) through the residual water signal. Reference spectra were collected with1H2O saturation. Steady-state NOE and inversion-recovery spectra were collected at a repetition rate of 3 s−1 (34Emerson S.D. La Mar G.N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The residual water signals were removed from the free induction decay by convolution difference. The nonselective spin lattice paramagnetic relaxation times for the resolved peaks were derived from two-parameter exponential least square fits using only short (≤50 ms) delays. Estimates for distance to the iron for protoni, RFe-i were obtained from the nonselective paramagnetically dominated T1values using the following relation.T1i/T1j=RFe­i6/RFe­j6(Eq. 1) where the reference T1j = 150 ms (RFe-j = 6.1 Å) for a heme methyl, orT1j = 30 ms (RFe = 5.1 Å) for the His(F8) NδH, provided upper and lower limits, respectively (44Zhang W.

Interproton distances, rij, were estimated from steady-state NOEs, ηi-j to protons with paramagnetically dominated (nonselective)T1 values, via the following two equations.ηi→j=σijT1j(Eq. 2) whereσij=−0.1γ4ℏ2rij−6(Eq. 3) NOESY (45Jeener J.

Reson. 1987; 74: 557-564Google Scholar) spectra were collected over a temperature range of 20–35 °C in 1H2O. Two different spectral windows and mixing times were used for NOESY 25.0 KHz using 2048 complex points at 3 scans/s with a mixing time of 35 ms to optimize the observation of the hyperfine shifted signals and 10.0 KHz at 1 scan/s with a mixing time of 100 ms to cover the diamagnetic window at optimal digital resolution. The clean TOCSY spectra were collected over 12.0 KHz at 2 scans/s with a spin locking time of 35 ms using the MLEV-17 mixing scheme (47Davis D.G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 2820-2821Crossref Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). All the two-dimensional data sets were processed on a Silicon Graphics workstation either using the software package FELIX from Biosym/MSI (San Diego, CA) or AZARA generously provided by Wayne Boucher (Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge). To increase the resolution, data sets were apodized with a sine-bell-squared function shifted by 20–40 ° in both dimensions and zero-filled once in t1dimension. The spectral assignments were largely facilitated with the aid of ANSIG package (49Kraulis P.J. Domaille P.J. Campbelburk S.L. Vanaken T. Laue E.D.

Experimental dipolar shifts, δDSS(obs), for protons on nonligated residues for structurally conserved portions (relative to A. suumHbO2) of the heme environment were used as input to search for the Euler rotation angles, Γ (α, β, γ), that transforms the iron-centered pseudo-symmetry coordinates (x′, y′, z′, or R, θ′, Ω′) (Fig.1 C)), readily obtained from the AscarisHbO2 (domain I) crystal coordinates (8Yang J. Kloek A. Goldberg D.E. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The tilt of the major magnetic axis, z, from the heme normal is given by β, the projection of this tilt on the heme plane relative to the x′ axis is given by α, and the location of the rhombic axes projected on the heme plane is approximated by κ = α + γ, as labeled in Fig. 1 C. δdip(obs) is given by the following equation.δdip(obs)=δDSS(obs)−δDSS(dia)(Eq. 6) δDSS(obs) is the observed chemical shift referenced to DSS. δDSS(dia) is the isostructural diamagnetic shift, which, in this case, was calculated by using: δDSS(dia) = δtetr + δsec+ δrc, where δtetr is the shift in an unfolded tetra peptide (54Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley & Sons, New York1986: 131-158Google Scholar), δsec is the shift of an amino acid proton resulted from the protein secondary structure (55Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar), and δrc is the heme-induced ring current shift (56Cross K.J. Wright P.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 220-231Google Scholar). Minimizing the error function, F/n, in Equation 4was performed over five parameters, Δχax, Δχrh, α, β, and γ, using the HbO2crystal coordinates. For the iron ligated porphyrin and axial His, the hyperfine shift is obtained via the following equation.δhf(obs)=δDSS(obs)−δDSS(dia)(Eq. 7) which yields the contact shift via the following equation.δcon(calc)=δhf(obs)−δdip(calc)(Eq. 8) Protons were added to the crystal coordinates of A. suum HbO2 using the program INSIGHT II (MSI). This provided unique coordinates for all protons of interest except the Tyr30(B10) hydroxyl proton; hence its position was determined from the 1H NMR spectral parameters. A schematic representation for selected heme cavity proximal (squares) and distal (circles) residues and their disposition relative to the heme is shown in Fig.1. The heme is shown in Fig.1 A seated as reported in the crystal structure of HbO2 (8Yang J. Kloek A. Goldberg D.E. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92 (s): 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and in Fig. 1 B as found in the solution structure of metHbCN. The resolved portions of the1H NMR spectra of A. suum D1 metHbCN in1H2O and 2H2O are shown in Fig. 2 (A and B, respectively). The region downfield of ∼9 ppm resolves four three-proton (methyls) and four single-proton signals as well as one two-proton peak at 11 ppm that overlaps a methyl peak. Ten single-proton peaks and four methyl peaks can be resolved at some temperature in the upfield portion of the spectra. The comparison between 1H2O and 2H2O reveals that three of the most strongly relaxed resolved protons are labile. Although the present 1H NMR data on metHbCN confirm a highly conserved arrangement relative to each other, of both proximal and distal residues (see below), the data also demonstrate that the heme is oriented differently in the cavity from that originally reported in the crystal structure (8Yang J. Kloek A. Goldberg D.E. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92 (s): 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus assignments for the heme and axial His are pursued first, followed by the key residues (i.e. Phe44(CD1) and Met103(FG5)) that invariably place strongly relaxed protons in resolved spectral windows and hence can be unambiguously assigned based solely on the conserved globin fold. These two residues are then used to uniquely orient the heme in the cavity. The remainder of the assignments are then presented on the basis of characteristic TOCSY-detected spin systems, with heme contacts expected on the basis of the heme orientation deduced above. Because the protocol for heme and resolved residue assignments in similar cyanomet globins has been described in detail (13Qin J. La Mar G.N. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 597-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), NMR data are illustrated only for the key heme-Phe44(CD1) contact that determines the heme orientation and for the distal H bond donors, Tyr30(B10) and Gln64(E7). The heme substituents could be unambiguously assigned as described in detail elsewhere (13Qin J. La Mar G.N. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 597-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Two TOCSY-detected vinyl and one propionate groups exhibit NOESY cross-peaks to low field resolved methyls that pair 1-CH3, 2 vinyl and 3-CH3, 4 vinyl; NOESY cross-peaks between two of the heme methyls (Fig. 3 D) assign the 1-CH3 and 8-CH3, and a NOESY cross-peak between the remaining methyls and the one detected propionate uniquely assigns the pyrrole substituents.

https://openalex.org/W1996210894,"Modification of muscular contractile patterns by denervation and chronic low frequency stimulation induces structural, physiological, and biochemical alterations in fast twitch skeletal muscles. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is a potent activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, a key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis in animal tissues. The concentration of Fru-2,6-P2 depends on the activity of the bifunctional enzyme, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2), which catalyzes the synthesis and degradation of this metabolite. This enzyme has several isoforms, the relative abundance of which depends on the tissue metabolic properties. Skeletal muscle expresses two of these isoforms; it mainly contains the muscle isozyme (M-type) and a small amount of the liver isozyme (L-type), whose expression is under hormonal control. Moreover, contractile activity regulates expression of muscular proteins related with glucose metabolism. Fast twitch rabbit skeletal muscle denervation or chronic low frequency stimulation can provide information about the regulation of this enzyme. Our results show an increase in Fru-2,6-P2 concentration after 2 days of denervation or stimulation. In denervated muscle, this increase is mediated by a rise in liver PFK-2/FBPase-2 isozyme, while in stimulated muscle it is mediated by a rise in muscle PFK-2/FBPase-2 isozyme. In conclusion, our results show that contractile activity could alter the expression of PFK-2/FBPase-2."
