The Juno mission set out to probe the hidden properties of Jupiter, such as its gravitational field, the depth of its atmospheric jets and its composition beneath the clouds. A collection of papers in this week's issue report some of the mission's key findings. Jupiter's gravitational field varies from pole to pole, but the cause of this asymmetry is unknown. Rotating planets that are squashed at the poles like Jupiter can have a gravity field that is characterized by a solid-body component, plus components that arise from motions in the atmosphere. Luciano Iess and colleagues use Juno's Doppler tracking data to determine Jupiter's gravity harmonics. They find that the north–south asymmetry arises from atmospheric and interior wind flows. To determine the depths of these flows, Yohai Kaspi and colleagues analyse the odd gravitational harmonics and find that the J3, J5, J7 and J9 harmonics are consistent with the jets extending deep into the atmosphere, perhaps as far as 3,000 kilometres. They conclude that the mass of Jupiter's dynamical atmosphere is about one per cent of Jupiter's total mass. The composition of Jupiter beneath its turbulent atmosphere remains a mystery. If different parts of a spinning object rotate at different rates, then the object probably has a fluid composition. Tristan Guillot and colleagues study the even gravitational harmonics and find that, below a depth of about 3,000 kilometres, Jupiter is rotating almost as a solid body. The atmospheric zonal flows extend downwards by more than 2,000 kilometres, but not beyond 3,500 kilometres, as is also the case with the jets. The depth to which Jupiter’s observed east–west jet streams extend has been a long-standing question1,2. Resolving this puzzle has been a primary goal for the Juno spacecraft3,4, which has been in orbit around the gas giant since July 2016. Juno’s gravitational measurements have revealed that Jupiter’s gravitational field is north–south asymmetric5, which is a signature of the planet’s atmospheric and interior flows6. Here we report that the measured odd gravitational harmonics J3, J5, J7 and J9 indicate that the observed jet streams, as they appear at the cloud level, extend down to depths of thousands of kilometres beneath the cloud level, probably to the region of magnetic dissipation at a depth of about 3,000 kilometres7,8. By inverting the measured gravity values into a wind field9, we calculate the most likely vertical profile of the deep atmospheric and interior flow, and the latitudinal dependence of its depth. Furthermore, the even gravity harmonics J8 and J10 resulting from this flow profile also match the measurements, when taking into account the contribution of the interior structure10. These results indicate that the mass of the dynamical atmosphere is about one per cent of Jupiter’s total mass."

The atmospheric zonal flows extend downwards by more than 2,000 kilometres, but not beyond 3,500 kilometres, as is also the case with the jets. The gravity harmonics of a fluid, rotating planet can be decomposed into static components arising from solid-body rotation and dynamic components arising from flows. In the absence of internal dynamics, the gravity field is axially and hemispherically symmetric and is dominated by even zonal gravity harmonics J2n that are approximately proportional to qn, where q is the ratio between centrifugal acceleration and gravity at the planet’s equator1. Any asymmetry in the gravity field is attributed to differential rotation and deep atmospheric flows. The odd harmonics, J3, J5, J7, J9 and higher, are a measure of the depth of the winds in the different zones of the atmosphere2,3. Here we report measurements of Jupiter’s gravity harmonics (both even and odd) through precise Doppler tracking of the Juno spacecraft in its polar orbit around Jupiter. We find a north–south asymmetry, which is a signature of atmospheric and interior flows. Analysis of the harmonics, described in two accompanying papers4,5, provides the vertical profile of the winds and precise constraints for the depth of Jupiter’s dynamical atmosphere."

The atmospheric zonal flows extend downwards by more than 2,000 kilometres, but not beyond 3,500 kilometres, as is also the case with the jets. Jupiter’s atmosphere is rotating differentially, with zones and belts rotating at speeds that differ by up to 100 metres per second. Whether this is also true of the gas giant’s interior has been unknown1,2, limiting our ability to probe the structure and composition of the planet3,4. The discovery by the Juno spacecraft that Jupiter’s gravity field is north–south asymmetric5 and the determination of its non-zero odd gravitational harmonics J3, J5, J7 and J9 demonstrates that the observed zonal cloud flow must persist to a depth of about 3,000 kilometres from the cloud tops6. Here we report an analysis of Jupiter’s even gravitational harmonics J4, J6, J8 and J10 as observed by Juno5 and compared to the predictions of interior models. We find that the deep interior of the planet rotates nearly as a rigid body, with differential rotation decreasing by at least an order of magnitude compared to the atmosphere. Moreover, we find that the atmospheric zonal flow extends to more than 2,000 kilometres and to less than 3,500 kilometres, making it fully consistent with the constraints obtained independently from the odd gravitational harmonics. This depth corresponds to the point at which the electric conductivity becomes large and magnetic drag should suppress differential rotation7. Given that electric conductivity is dependent on planetary mass, we expect the outer, differentially rotating region to be at least three times deeper in Saturn and to be shallower in massive giant planets and brown dwarfs."

https://openalex.org/W2791039182,"The composition of natural calcium silicate perovskite, the fourth most abundant mineral in the Earth, found within a diamond indicates an origin from oceanic crust subducted deeper than 700 kilometres into the Earth’s mantle. Within the Earth's transition zone and lower mantle, the high-pressure perovskite-structured polymorph of calcium silicate (CaSiO3) is thought to be the main host of calcium, as well as the heat-producing elements potassium, uranium and thorium. Despite being considered as the fourth most abundant mineral in the Earth, it has never been found in nature. Fabrizio Nestola and co-authors document the perovskite-structured polymorph of CaSiO3 included within a diamond from Cullinan kimberlite mined in South Africa. The authors conclude that the bulk composition of material within the diamond is consistent with derivation from basaltic oceanic crust subducted to pressures equivalent to those present at the depths of the uppermost lower mantle, providing additional evidence for the recycling of oceanic crust and carbon from the surface to lower-mantle depths. Laboratory experiments and seismology data have created a clear theoretical picture of the most abundant minerals that comprise the deeper parts of the Earth’s mantle. Discoveries of some of these minerals in ‘super-deep’ diamonds—formed between two hundred and about one thousand kilometres into the lower mantle—have confirmed part of this picture1,2,3,4,5. A notable exception is the high-pressure perovskite-structured polymorph of calcium silicate (CaSiO3). This mineral—expected to be the fourth most abundant in the Earth—has not previously been found in nature. Being the dominant host for calcium and, owing to its accommodating crystal structure, the major sink for heat-producing elements (potassium, uranium and thorium) in the transition zone and lower mantle, it is critical to establish its presence. Here we report the discovery of the perovskite-structured polymorph of CaSiO3 in a diamond from South African Cullinan kimberlite. The mineral is intergrown with about six per cent calcium titanate (CaTiO3). The titanium-rich composition of this inclusion indicates a bulk composition consistent with derivation from basaltic oceanic crust subducted to pressures equivalent to those present at the depths of the uppermost lower mantle. The relatively ‘heavy’ carbon isotopic composition of the surrounding diamond, together with the pristine high-pressure CaSiO3 structure, provides evidence for the recycling of oceanic crust and surficial carbon to lower-mantle depths."
